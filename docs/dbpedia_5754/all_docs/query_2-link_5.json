        "text": "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. – Lionel Messi did not have to travel far Monday to report to Argentina’s Copa América training.\n\nArgentina, the reigning 2021 Copa América and 2022 World Cup champions, are holding their Copa América training sessions in South Florida at Inter Miami, the MLS club which Messi calls home.\n\nMessi, the eight-time Ballon d’Or winner who turns 37 on June 24, will captain Argentina again for Copa América. He’ll play in two friendlies − June 9 in Chicago and June 14 in the Washington D.C. area − before the tournament begins on June 20 when they face Canada at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta.\n\nAnd Messi appears fit and in shape, according to Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni.\n\n\"I think the good thing is that he has had continuity, that after the injury he has played and that is important,\" Scaloni told reporters on Sunday night. \"We can see that he is fit and well.\"\n\nMessi reported to the team hotel on Monday, after spending Sunday hanging out with fellow Inter Miami star Luis Suarez and their families, playing some indoor soccer and paddleball, while his Argentine teammates and coaches arrived in South Florida.\n\nArgentina’s training at Inter Miami this time around feels like a full-circle moment. They first used the club’s facilities in September 2022 before their World Cup run − which proved to be a key selling point before Messi joined the club last year.\n\nMessi is in the twilight of his storied career. The World Cup win cemented Messi’s place as one of the best − if not, the best − in the sport’s history. Messi also repeatedly said his 2022 World Cup run would be his last.\n\nThis likely will be Messi’s last Copa América, given the next one is in 2028. It could also be Messi’s last major tournament he’ll play for Argentina.\n\nMessi will likely continue helping Argentina qualify for the 2026 World Cup later this year, but he’ll be turning 39 when that tournament begins − if he wants to play.\n\nMessi’s stats with Inter Miami since July\n\nDoes Messi have another dominant tournament run in him? His play with Inter Miami shows he does.\n\nMessi has shown he’s still in his prime with Inter Miami − when he’s been fit and not dealing with the lingering effects of a groin pull like he was last September to October, or a hamstring strain like he had from mid-March until April began.\n\nMessi has played in 29 of 43 possible matches with Inter Miami since last July − missing 14 games due to rest or injury, including seven this season. Inter Miami has been unbeatable in 25 of 29 matches Messi has played, with 20 wins, five draws and four losses.\n\nMessi isn’t playing with Kylian Mbappé or Neymar anymore, so he’s had to score more: Messi has 25 goals with 16 assists, including five assists in a match on May 4. He scored a goal in 19 of the 29 games, and assisted in 10 of his 29 games.\n\nMessi had a goal or assist in 23 of the 29 games he’s played. Messi had a goal and an assist in six games, including a four-game stretch from April 13-May 4 − where he scored six goals with eight assists.\n\nIt was Messi’s best stretch with Inter Miami since his first best stretch, when he had 10 goals and an assist en route to the Leagues Cup title in the first seven games of his tenure.\n\nMessi re-joins Argentina after scoring a goal in his last two matches last week. He finished play with Inter Miami in a 3-3 draw against St. Louis last Saturday. And Inter Miami’s 3-1 loss to Atlanta United last Wednesday was the first match where he scored a goal but his team lost since the 2-1 loss Argentina suffered to Saudi Arabia to begin the Qatar World Cup on Nov. 22, 2022.\n\nHow dominant has Messi, Argentina been?\n\nSpeaking of Argentina losses, there haven’t been many in recent years.\n\nArgentina lost 2-0 to Uruguay last November during World Cup qualifying − their first loss since the Saudi Arabia defeat.\n\nBefore that, Messi’s last Argentina defeat was at the 2019 Copa América semifinal against Brazil.\n\nIn other words, Messi and Argentina have been dominant − losing just three times in their last 46 matches together.\n\nThis Copa América run, which could last seven matches if Argentina reaches the final, is another chance for Messi and the world champions this summer to defend their crown and exert their recent dominance."
