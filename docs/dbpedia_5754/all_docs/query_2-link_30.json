        "text": "Lionel Messi was not on the Argentina team bus when players sang a racist song about France players following their Copa America success, it has been claimed.\n\nArgentina secured their record 16th Copa America triumph with a 1-0 win over Colombia in extra-time, thanks to a Lautaro Martinez strike. But the Albiceleste’s record-breaking victory has been overshadowed after several players were accused of singing a discriminatory song on the team bus.\n\nSeveral players from the Argentina squad were heard singing a chant that mocked French players for their national identity. Footage of the chants and dancing was captured on Chelsea midfielder Enzo Fernandez’s live stream broadcast on the national team’s coach.\n\nThe clip has been slammed by those who viewed it and fellow Chelsea teammate Wesley Fofana was vocal in his criticism of the chant, as he shared footage of the song on X, writing: “ Football in 2024: uninhibited racism”.\n\nREAD MORE: Chelsea star issues public defence of Enzo Fernandez as dressing room divided\n\nREAD MORE: Full lyrics to 'racist' chant Chelsea are investigating after Enzo Fernandez video\n\nIt’s been claimed that Messi wasn’t among those involved after he picked up an ankle injury during the second half that curtailed his final.\n\nAccording to ESPN, Messi didn’t travel with his team-mates to return to Buenos Aires on Monday, instead staying in Miami where he currently plays to receive treatment on the injury he sustained during the game and appears to have not been on the team bus.\n\nMessi was withdrawn in the 63rd minute and was spotted in tears on the bench with a swollen and bruised right ankle. He gave an update on his condition to Instagram, as well as a message to his team-mates, he wrote: \"The Copa América is over and the first thing I want is to thank everyone for the messages and greetings.\n\n\"I'm fine, thank God, and I hope I can soon be on the pitch again enjoying what I like to do most. I am happy, very happy, especially because we achieved the goal we had and Fide [Di Maria] leaves us but with another Cup.\n\n\"The older ones, like him, [Nicolás] Ota [Otamendi] or me, experienced it [Copa América] with special emotion, with other teammates who have already played several tournaments and added their experience as well, and with a group of young people who give their all in every ball.\"\n\nInter Miami released an assessment on the eight-time Ballon d’Or winners’ injury in a statement, which read: “Inter Miami CF has provided an injury update presented by Baptist Health for captain Leo Messi.\n\n“After a medical evaluation, it has been determined that Leo Messi has suffered a ligament injury in his right ankle. The captain's availability will be determined by periodic assessments and the progress of his recovery.”\n\nMeanwhile at Chelsea, it’s reported the club are facing a major rift inside the dressing room with the French contingent including Fofana, Malo Gusto, Lesley Ugochukwu, Christopher Nkunku, Axel Disasi and Benoit Badiashile all furious with Fernandez.\n\nThe midfielder posted an apology on his social media which read: “I want to apologise for a video posted on my Instagram channel during the national team celebrations. The song includes highly offensive language and there is absolutely no excuse for these words.\n\n“I stand against discrimination in all forms and apologise for getting caught up in the euphoria of our Copa America celebrations. That video, that moment, those words, do not reflect my beliefs or my character. I am truly sorry.”\n\nChelsea have also issued a statement to condemn Fernandez’s behaviour and have started a disciplinary procedure internally. FIFA and the Argentine FA are yet to respond to the request from French FA president Philippe Diallo to respond to the footage."
