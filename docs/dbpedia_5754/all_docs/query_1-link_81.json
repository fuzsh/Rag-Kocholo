        "text": "Inter Miami and Argentina men’s national soccer team star Lionel Messi has been ruled out of the upcoming U.S. tour, including the March 26 game at the L.A. Coliseum against Costa Rica.\n\nArgentina kicks off its U.S. international exhibition schedule on Friday in Philadelphia against El Salvador and four days later, Argentina faces Costa Rica at the Coliseum (7:30 p.m.).\n\nThe Argentine Federation confirmed the news Monday afternoon via its X account (formerly Twitter): “The captain of @Argentina, Lionel Messi, will not be able to be in the squad for the friendlies in #USA due to a minor injury to the hamstring of his right leg suffered in his team’s @InterMiamiCF match against Nashville SC.”\n\nMessi was subbed off early in the second half of last week’s CONCACAF Champions Cup game against Nashville SC. Coach Tata Martino said it was due to a “physical issue” with his right leg.\n\nMessi also missed Inter Miami’s game against D.C. United on Saturday.\n\nAccording to Ticketmaster, the lowest-priced tickets available for the Costa Rica match are $120."
