        "text": "Lionel Messi has reportedly given his thoughts on whether or not he wants to play for Argentina next month against Chile.\n\nThe Inter Miami captain has not played since the Copa America final after the forward twisted his ankle in Argentina’s win against Colombia, with Messi expected to be back on the pitch in training later this week for the Herons.\n\nWith Argentina’s 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifying process resuming next month, the reigning world champions will want Messi involved with the squad to face Chile and Colombia, with La Seleccion currently leading the group.\n\nAnd Messi himself now has indicated if he wants to play or not for Argentina next month.\n\nMessi wants to play for Argentina vs Chile and Colombia in September\n\nAccording to Gaston Edul, Messi has shared his openness to playing for Argentina against Chile and Colombia next month if the attacker is fit enough to compete for the reigning South American champions.\n\nEdul wrote: “Leo Messi, as always when he plays Argentina, wants to take part in the FIFA matchday in September. If everything continues with his rehabilitation process, Messi should be fit to participate. There is still a month left until Argentina – Chile.”\n\nMORE INTER MIAMI STORIES\n\nWith Messi not featuring for Inter Miami in the last four games, the prospects of the 37-year-old playing on international duty next month currently seem low given the attacker’s fitness situation and lack of match sharpness.\n\nHowever, if Messi can return within the next two weeks and get some games under his belt for Inter Miami, a return to the national team could be likely, especially with the forward keen on playing next month.\n\nMessi’s club and country need to keep an eye on his fitness\n\nHaving missed almost a month of action, Messi’s fitness is once again under the microscope, with Inter Miami keeping a close eye on the Argentine’s condition ahead of a potential return this month.\n\nAnd if Messi is called up for international duty in September, Argentine also need to ensure that they’re doing everything possible to keep their captain and star attacker fully fit.\n\nIndeed, Messi needs to be taken care of if Inter Miami and Argentina want to get the best out of the veteran attacker, and managing his fitness and his workload will be key in the forward playing as much as he physically can this year."
