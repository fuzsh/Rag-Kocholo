        "text": "Lionel Messi flirted with a hat trick near the nation’s capital, scoring two goals and reaching second place on the all-time international goals list, in Argentina’s 4-1 victory over Guatemala on Friday night.\n\nMessi answered an early deficit with a goal in 12th minute, and scored another goal in the 77th minute at Commanders Field in Landover, Maryland, to reach 108 career goals in 182 international matches.\n\nMessi is tied for second place with Iran’s Ali Daei, who scored 108 in 148 matches, while archrival Cristiano Ronaldo leads all players with 130 goals in 207 games before his Euro 2024 run begins with Portugal.\n\nMessi also finished with an assist as he went the distance Friday in the match, which served as a final warmup before the Copa América. Argentina kicks off the tournament, facing Canada in Atlanta next Thursday.\n\nArgentina is the defending 2021 Copa América and 2022 World Cup champions, eyeing another championship.\n\n“We are going to continue putting in the effort and trying to win, as always,” Messi told TYCSports after the game. “Winning again is increasingly difficult, but we are going to try again.”\n\nArgentina scored all five goals against Guatemala, an own goal by Lisandro Martínez in the fourth minute causing the world champions to play from behind early.\n\nMessi, the Inter Miami star, answered in the 12th minute, stealing a poor clearance by Guatemala goalie Nicholas Hagen, who plays with the reigning MLS Cup champion Columbus Crew.\n\nLautaro Martinez scored a penalty in the 39th minute, and scored from Messi’s assist in the 66th minute before Messi delivered the final score – the final two scores orchestrated by Argentine standout Angel Di Maria.\n\nMessi nearly converted a hat trick in the 83rd minute, using a crossover to fire away toward the net with his legendary left leg, but missed.\n\nDespite the victory, Argentina’s front line appeared to be out of sync at times before Di Maria’s entrance in the second half.\n\nWhile Lautaro Martinez, Enzo Fernández and Valentin Carboni were aggressive, there were a few instances where they were unable to get on the same page with Messi in the first half.\n\nMessi also had a moment where his age – he’s turning 37 on June 24 – showed. He was unable to speed away from a defender during a straightaway run toward the net after receiving an outlet pass from Di Maria in the 70th minute.\n\nStill, Messi and Argentina appear in prime shape for Copa América.\n\nIt will be Messi’s final Copa América (the next one is in 2028), while Messi has left the door open to playing in the 2026 World Cup.\n\nMessi nearly has hat trick: Argentina 4, Guatemala 1\n\nMessi nearly notched a hat trick, but his fire toward the net was deflected away in the 84th minute.\n\nMessi was on the right side of the penalty area, and hit his defender with a crossover dribble to fire off his legendary left boot. But to no avail.\n\nMessi received a beautiful pass dropped in his path by Angel Di Maria, and was one-on-one with Guatemala’s goalie. Messi has a brace, scoring in the 77th minute to increase Argentina’s lead to 4-1 over Guatemala.\n\nMessi to Enzo Fernández, back to Messi to set up Lautaro Martinez for his second goal of the match.\n\nIt was a beautiful goal sequence by Argentina in the 66th minute to take a 3-1 lead over Guatemala.\n\nMessi picks up the assist, while Martinez has a brace for the world champions.\n\nMessi’s genius with the ball nearly resulted in another goal just before halftime.\n\nMessi lined up for a free kick, and attacked the left goal post. It appeared Messi’s kick was deflected by Guatemala goalie Nicholas Hagen and hit the post.\n\nIt was nearly a brace for Messi, and nearly a two-goal lead. Instead Argentina leads Guatemala 2-1 at halftime.\n\nLautaro Martínez converts a penalty kick, and Argentina is up 2-1 in the 39th minute.\n\nMessi misses free kick: Argentina 1, Guatemala 1\n\nMessi didn’t have enough range or bend on a free kick opportunity, just outside the penalty area, for a second goal. His kick was caught by Guatemala goalie Nicholas Hagen in the 30th minute.\n\nThe opportunity was created when Guatemala defender Marco Dominguez-Ramirez grabbed Messi from behind and received a yellow card in the 29th minute.\n\nLionel Messi to the rescue.\n\nAfter a poor clearance by Guatemala’s goalie, Messi found the back of the net with a touch from his legendary left boot.\n\nIt was an easy goal for the World Cup champion to tie the match against Guatemala in the 12th minute.\n\nFour minutes in, and the world champions are down.\n\nArgentina was unable to handle Guatemala’s free kick sequence, and Lisandro Martínez was credited with the own goal.\n\nGuatemala is up 1-0, while Messi’s first touch came before the third minute, as Guatemala’s defense kept Argentina around the midfield area to start this match.\n\nYes, Messi will play in the Argentina-Guatemala match tonight. Argentine coach Lionel Scaloni said Messi will start and could play the entire match.\n\nThe match is available on TruTV and Max in English, and here on Fubo.\n\nDC TICKETS: Experience Messi and Argentina vs. Guatemala\n\nThe match begins at 8 p.m. ET, 9 p.m. in Argentina.\n\nMessi is in Argentina’s starting lineup\n\nHere is Argentina’s lineup for the Guatemala match, which includes Messi.\n\nWhat did Scaloni say about Messi?\n\n\"Leo is going to play from the start,\" Scaloni said at a press conference after arriving in the Washington D.C. area Thursday night.\n\n“Based on how he is, we will see the amount. If he can play everything, even better. We expect the same from him as always: that he plays football, that he associates with his teammates and that he be himself. On the field, in the end what we need is that he is comfortable, that he is comfortable with the team that we put out.\"\n\nHow did Messi fare in his last match?\n\nMessi entered as a substitute in the 56th minute and played the rest of last Sunday’s match between Argentina and Ecuador in Chicago. Argentina won 1-0 after Ángel Di Maria scored in the first half.\n\n“The other day it was decided that he play a few minutes,“ Scaloni said.\n\nMessi and Argentina take center stage in the Copa America opener on June 20 against Canada at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta.\n\nArgentina will conclude play in Group A with matches on June 25 vs. Chile at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, and against Peru on June 29 at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Fla.\n\nSHOP INTER MIAMI: Messi gear from the MLS Store\n\nSHOP ARGENTINA: Messi and Argentina gear from Amazon\n\nNo, Messi will not join Argentina for the Olympics this summer in Paris. He will return to MLS club Inter Miami after Copa America."
