This was due to a hormone deficiency that stunted his growth.\n\nIn order to solve his condition, Messi’s parents, Jorge and Cecilia, decided to give him hormone injections every night.\n\nHowever, medication became a financial struggle for his family.\n\nWhen Messi turned 13, he was offered an opportunity to do soccer training in FC Barcelona’s youth academy in La Masia.\n\nThe team covered Messi’s medical bills while he was training.\n\nHis family followed him and moved to Spain.\n\nMESSI’S FOOTBALL CAREER\n\nMessi’s first team where he plays was FC Barcelona – the team he signed him at the age of 13.\n\nMessi also plays for the Argentina National Team.\n\nOn May 1, 2005, Messi’s first appearance in FC Barcelona immediately made him popular.\n\nAt the age of 16, he was the youngest player to ever score a goal for the franchise.\n\nIn the same year (2005), Messi led Argentina to the title in the under-20 World Cup, where he scored two penalty kicks to win against the team from Nigeria.\n\nIt was 2009 when Messi became a successful soccer star.\n\nIt was the year when his team won the Champions League, La Liga, and Spanish Cup titles.\n\nIt was also in 2009 when Messi received his first FIFA “World Player of the Year” honor or Ballon d’Or award.\n\nLionel Messi, being the soccer wizard that he already was, did not stop improving as he discovered new strategies to distract opponents.\n\nIn the following years of 2010 and 2011, Messi successfully led Barcelona to La Liga and Spanish Super Cup championships.\n\nHe also led his team to win the Champions League title in 2011.\n\nMessi’s expertise in the field of football allowed him to be deemed as legendary.\n\nIt was in early March of 2012, when he set a record for being the first player who scored five goals in a Champions League.\n\nIn the following weeks of March, Lionel Messi had already surpassed the record of Cesar Rodriguez, who scored 232 goals, to be known as Barcelona’s all-time leading scorer.\n\nAs 2012 ended, Messi had recorded an outstanding 91 goals.\n\nHis record surpassed another that was set by Gerd Muller in 1972, who only accumulated 85 goals in a single year\n\nMessi once again broke another record when he received his fourth Ballon d’Or honor in January 2013.\n\nHowever, Messi rested in 2013 due to the pain from a hamstring injury.\n\nMessi’s proved his recovery time was worthwhile the following year (2014) as he become the all-time leading scorer in La Liga and Champions League.\n\nIn 2015, he again received—now his fifth—Ballon d’Or honor.\n\nARGENTINA NATIONAL TEAM\n\nAlthough Messi was known for leading FC Barcelona to success, he was criticized for his inability to help Argentina’s National team to win a major title.\n\nIn the finals of the 2014 World Cup, Messi led Argentina to the title of “La Albiceleste.”\n\nHowever, his team failed to win against the team from Germany.\n\nLionel Messi announced that he would end his run as a captain for Argentina’s National Team in 2016, right after it lost against Chile in the final of the Copa America tournament.\n\nHowever, he did not quit. But the major title in the World Cup 2018 remained elusive for his team.\n\nLionel Messi faced a three-game ban by the South American Football Confederation in 2019, after he heavily criticized the referees in the wake of a 2-0 loss to Brazil in the Copa America semifinals.\n\nLIONEL MESSI’S STATS\n\nMessi has a total of 687 game appearances.\n\nHis goals accumulate to a total of 603.\n\nMessi has a record 251 assists.\n\nHe has a 48 percent shot accuracy.\n\nWIFE AND SONS\n\nOn June 30, 2017, Messi married Antonella Roccuzzo, his longtime girlfriend and the cousin of his best friend and fellow soccer player Lucas Scaglia.\n\nThey have two sons together: Thiago, born in November 2012 , and Mateo, born in September 2015.\n\nLionel Messi Worksheets\n\nThis is a fantastic bundle which includes everything you need to know about Lionel Messi across 20 in-depth pages.
