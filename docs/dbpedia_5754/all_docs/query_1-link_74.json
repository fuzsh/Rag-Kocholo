        "text": "Preseason came and went. Now come the games that matter, starting with Wednesdayâs standalone 2024 MLS regular-season opener vs. Real Salt Lake (8 pm ET | MLS Season Pass).\n\nChase Stadium will be rocking as the Herons put their high-profile lineup to the first of many tests.\n\nItâs the dream scenario for every Argentina fan: Messi lifting yet another trophy with his beloved national team â in front of a âhometownâ crowd, no less.\n\nThe highly-favored Albiceleste, reigning Copa AmÃ©rica and World Cup champs, could very well go all the way at 2024 Copa AmÃ©rica with Messi pulling the strings. And if they do, itâll happen at Miamiâs Hard Rock Stadium â the site of the July 14 final.\n\nMessiâs magical first half-season in Miami largely revolved around his inspired Leagues Cup 2023 play, leading the club to their first-ever trophy during a sensational title run.\n\nThis year, theyâll have to navigate past two Liga MX opponents â Tigres UANL and Puebla â in the group stage to reach the knockout rounds. Will the Herons stand on the champion's podium once again come the Aug. 25 final?\n\nMiami host the New England Revolution (6 pm ET | MLS Season Pass) in their final game of the regular season, complete with Audi MLS Cup Playoffs implications and more on the line.\n\nLest there be any doubts, head coach Gerardo Martino insists the Herons âat the very leastâ must make the postseason this year.\n\nSome would go a step further than Tata and say the Herons at the very least need to make MLS Cup presented by Audi, if not win it altogether.\n\nRemember the date: Dec. 7, 2024 could be one more for Messi, Inter Miami and the history books.\n\nConcacaf Champions Cup Final - June 2\n\nMartino went on record last week saying Concacaf Champions Cup could be the most important tournament Miami play in 2024. The champion qualifies for the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup, a competition Messi has won on three occasions.\n\nThe Herons have a Round One bye and will face either Nashville SC or Moca FC (Dominican Republic) in the Round of 16, starting March 7. The CCC final is set for June 2.\n\nMenâs Soccer Gold Medal Match, 2024 Paris Olympic Games - Aug. 9\n\nArgentina U-23 head coach Javier Mascherano recently fueled speculation about Messi possibly representing his country at the Olympics, saying the âdoor is openâ for his former Barcelona and Albiceleste teammate to join the squad in France.\n\nMessi, an Olympic champion at Beijing 2008, could theoretically play for another gold medal on Aug. 9.\n\nBallon dâOr Award ceremony - Date TBD\n\nThe GOAT made it a world-record eight Ballon dâOr trophies after last yearâs capture of the consensus top individual prize in global soccer.\n\nAn unprecedented ninth Ballon dâOr canât be ruled out should Messi win some of the trophies listed above between now and this yearâs award ceremony."
