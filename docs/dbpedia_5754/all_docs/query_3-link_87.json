        "text": "Lionel Messi will not be part of Argentina’s squad for the upcoming Paris 2024 Olympic Games.\n\nU23’s head coach Javier Mascherano had hoped to get the football legend on board, but the 36-year-old has now ruled himself out of contention.\n\nAfter representing his homeland at the Copa América between 20 June and 14 July, Olympic gold medallist Messi believes the Olympics would just be ‘too much’ for him at his age.\n\nIt would also mean several months away from his club, Inter Miami, which was among the factors in his decision making.\n\n\"I talked to Mascherano and the truth is we both understood the situation,\" he told ESPN.\n\n\"I have to choose carefully, and it would be too much to play two straight tournaments.\n\n“I've been very lucky to play in the Olympics, of winning it together with Masche. It was a wonderful experience on a football level.”\n\nOlympic Football at Paris 2024\n\nThe pair were part of Argentina’s 2008 squad that topped the podium in Beijing, beating Nigeria 1-0 in the gold medal match.\n\nWhile disappointed he won’t get another chance to add to his medal tally from the Games, Messi is hopeful the squad who do head to Paris will enjoy it just as he did.\n\n“It’s spectacular to be fortunate enough to go through all that,” he added.\n\n“I hope that the guys who get to go enjoy it in the same way that I did because it was special.\n\n“The Olympics are special, different from anything else.”"
