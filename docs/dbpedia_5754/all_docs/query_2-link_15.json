        "text": "Argentina are aiming to make it three successes in as many major tournaments at the Copa America in the United States.\n\nThe world champions kicked off a glorious era by beating Brazil on home soil in the final of the 2021 tournament, laying the groundwork for their stirring march to World Cup glory in Qatar, where they beat France on penalties in the final.\n\nInspirational captain Lionel Messi has returned to try to add another medal to his collection, with head coach Lionel Scaloni once again tasked with blending youth and experience into a winning formula.\n\nOn June 15, Scaloni named his 26-man squad for Argentina's tournament this summer. Messi, of course, was included, but there were one or two more surprising decisions.\n\nMORE: Key dates and schedule for Copa America 2024\n\nHow many players are in Copa America 2024 squads?\n\nTeams had the opportunity to name provisional squads of up to 55 players for pre-tournament training camps and friendly matches. These groups had to be a minimum of 35 players and contain at least four goalkeepers.\n\nThe final rosters, which were confirmed by June 15 (except for Paraguay, who had until June 18), comprise a maximum of 26 players. At least three of these players must be goalkeepers, and they must all be selected from the provisional squad, except in exceptional circumstances.\n\nArgentina Copa America squad 2024: Official roster\n\nHere is the full squad named for Argentina's 2024 Copa America.\n\nManchester United defender Lisandro Martinez made the cut despite an injury-ruined season, although there was no place for Paulo Dybala.\n\nAges, caps are correct as of provisional squad announcement on May 20, 2024.\n\nPositionPlayerClubAgeCapsGKFranco ArmaniRiver Plate (ARG)3719GKEmiliano MartinezAston Villa (ENG)3137GKGeronimo RulliAjax (NED)324DEFMarcos AcunaSevilla (SPA)3256DEFLisandro MartinezManchester United (ENG)2616DEFNahuel MolinaAtletico Madrid (SPA)2535DEFGonzalo MontielNottingham Forest (ENG)2724DEFNicolas OtamendiBenfica (POR)36111DEFGerman PezzellaReal Betis (SPA)3240DEFLucas Martinez QuartaFiorentina (ITA)2812DEFCristian RomeroTottenham (ENG)2630DEFNicolas TagliaficoLyon (FRA)3157MIDGiovani Lo CelsoTottenham (ENG)2850MIDEnzo FernandezChelsea (ENG)2319MIDAlexis Mac AllisterLiverpool (ENG)2525MIDExequiel PalaciosBayer Leverkusen2528MIDLeandro ParedesRoma (ITA)2960MIDRodrigo De PaulAtletico Madrid (SPA)2962MIDGuido RodriguezReal Betis (SPA)3029FWDJulian AlvarezManchester City (ENG)2429FWDValentin CarboniMonza (ITA)191FWDAlejandro GarnachoManchester United (ENG)195FWDNicolas GonzalezFiorentina (ITA)2632FWDAngel Di MariaBenfica (POR)36138FWDLautaro MartinezInter Milan (ITA)2656FWDLionel MessiInter Miami (USA)36180\n\nCan Argentina replace players on Copa America roster?\n\nCompetition regulations state that once the final roster has been made official, changes can only be made due to injury or illness up until the team's opening match of the tournament.\n\nCONMEBOL's tournament regulations also state: \"In case of serious injury or detection of pathological clinical elements of any player, after the submission of the squad list, and which prevents the player from playing in the tournament, the replacement of such player by another player included in the provisional squad list will be allowed up to 24 hours before the first match of the team in the competition, subject to the approval of the CONMEBOL Medical Commission.\"\n\nMORE: Will Messi win the MLS Golden Boot?\n\nArgentina Copa America 2024 schedule, matches\n\nArgentina played two Copa America warm-up matches in early June against Ecuador (on June 9) and Guatemala (June 14).\n\nThey beat Ecuador 1-0 thanks to Angel Di Maria's first-half strike before they went on to put four past Guatemala, where Messi bagged a brace.\n\nTheir tournament then began against Canada at Mercedes Benz Stadium on June 20 — the opening match of Group A and the competition as a whole — before they faced Chile at MetLife Stadium and Peru at Hard Rock Stadium.\n\nArgentina Copa America 2024 match schedule\n\nDateMatch TypeOpponentVenueTime (ET)June 9Warm-up1-0 vs. EcuadorSoldier Field, IL6 p.m.June 14Warm-up4-0 vs. GuatemalaFedExField, MD8 p.m.June 20Group Stage MD 12-0 vs. CanadaMercedes Benz Stadium, GA8 p.m.June 25Group Stage MD 21-0 vs. ChileMetLife Stadium, NJ9 p.m.June 29Group Stage MD 32-0 vs. PeruHard Rock Stadium, FL8 p.m.July 4Quarterfinalsvs. EcuadorNRG Stadium, TX9 p.m."
