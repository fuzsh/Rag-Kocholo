        "text": "Atlanta gears up to host the first of two Copa América games Thursday, Jun. 22, as Argentina and Canada kick off the first game of the tournament at Mercedes-Benz Stadium at 8 p.m.\n\nWant more local sports news? Subscribe to Sideline, a pop-up newsletter for the summer.\n\nThis major men’s soccer championship features South American national teams with a select group of North American and Caribbean teams. The 2024 event, with a total of 32 matches played across 14 U.S. cities, is only the second time the tournament has been held outside of South America in the past 50 years.\n\nAmericans have jumped at the chance to see these international soccer stars in action, especially the opening match. With the notion of Lionel Messi playing in the ATL making nosebleed ticket sales rival the price of last year’s Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour, local fans are sure to bring high energy to this anticipated game.\n\nGroup A\n\nIn Copa América Group A, which includes Argentina, Canada, Peru and Chile, all eyes immediately go to Argentina, the defending FIFA World Cup champions. Still ranked No. 1 in the world after winning 13 of 14 matches since their 2022 World Cup victory, “La Albiceleste” are favored to repeat as South American champions.\n\nIn contrast, Canada’s road to their first-ever Copa América has been tumultuous. First, the young squad fell short of the hype they received going into the 2022 World Cup when they were knocked out in the Group Stage of the tournament. Then, in 2023, Canada barely qualified for this tournament by defeating Trinidad and Tobago following a loss to Jamaica in the CONCACAF Nations League quarterfinal.\n\nOff the pitch, Canada Soccer has been grappling with financial woes and disputes with the women’s team over equal pay. Now, with American coach Jesse March at the helm for his first competitive match with the team, Canada strives to make a statement against Messi and crew.\n\nPlayers to Watch on Thursday\n\nOf course, it’s hard to think of Argentinian soccer without Lionel Messi coming to mind. Often heralded as the “GOAT” of soccer, the captain of Argentina has recently transitioned his illustrious career from Barcelona and Paris to MLS team Inter Miami FC. To say Messi has made a mark on this new team would be an understatement; in just 12 games this 2024 season, Messi has scored 12 goals and assisted 13.\n\nOther notable Argentine players include forward Julian Alvarez and defender Cristian Romero. Alvarez had a stellar season, helping secure his English Premier League team Manchester City a record fourth straight English top flight title this past year. Alvarez had 11 goals and 9 assists in 36 matches. Also playing for an English side, Cristian Romero has been a defensive powerhouse for Tottenham Hotspur this year and should be a force to reckon with this Copa América.\n\nUnfortunately, Atlanta United’s best and brightest, Thiago Almada, will not make an appearance in this tournament as he prepares for the 2024 Olympic Games with Argentina’s U-23 squad. Back in February, Almada was instrumental in leading the Argentina national men’s U-23 team to a 1-0 victory over Brazil to secure tickets to Paris.\n\nOn Canada’s side, international stars Alphonso Davies and Jonathan David are hard to miss. Davies, named team captain for this tournament despite being a young defender, has established himself as a crucial player for powerhouse German team Bayern Munich. His leadership will undoubtedly fortify Canada’s often weaker back line. Meanwhile, forward David in his season for Ligue 1 side Lille has been none other than impressive, scoring 26 goals in all competitions. David’s ability to find the back of the net should give Canada the edge they need going forward in the tournament.\n\nWhere to Watch\n\n“Atlanta’s ultimate soccer bar,” Brewhouse, promises a high-energy crowd for this game.\n\nFadó Buckhead will be showing all European Championship and Copa América games.\n\nWild Leap will host a pregame party starting at 4 p.m. It is walking distance from Mercedes-Benz, so either grab a bite to eat before heading to the game or stay for the celebration.\n\nMARTA and Soccer in the Streets will host a watch party at West End Station to kick off the Copa América international men’s soccer tournament.\n\nTV\n\nAll games will be televised live on FOX Sports (FOX and FS1) and on TUDN."
