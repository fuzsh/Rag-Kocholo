        "text": "Will Argentina football icons Lionel Messi and Angel Di Maria go for a second Olympic gold medal at Paris 2024?\n\nIf it was up to under-23 coach Javier Mascherano, the answer would be yes.\n\nArgentina defeated reigning gold medallists Brazil 1-0 at 2024 CONMEBOL Pre-Olympic Tournament on Monday (12 February) to secure a quota for the upcoming Games in France.\n\nThe victory paves a path for Messi and Di Maria to add another Olympic gold to their Beijing 2008 glory.\n\n\"Everyone already knows my relationship with Leo [Messi] and with Angel [Di Maria]: We are friends. As a coach, I have an obligation to invite them,\" Messi's former Argentina and Barcelona teammate Mascherano told reporters after the game. \"But we also understand they have other commitments, and it will depend on that too.\"\n\nMessi captained Argentina to their third FIFA World Cup title in December 2022 and was also part of the team that won Olympic gold at Beijing alongside Di Maria.\n\nMen's football teams at the Games must be made up of under-23 players with a maximum of three overage players allowed, meaning both Messi and Di Maria could play should they want to.\n\nâ€œI hope Messi has the desire and can be at the Olympic games, it would be a dream,\" current under-23 captain Thiago Almada said, suggesting he would be happy to hand his armband over to Messi.\n\nWhile excitement brews, both Di Maria and the eight-time Ballon d'Or Messi have yet to comment on whether they would suit up for their country in Paris.\n\nMessi has also signalled his intentions to compete at the 2024 Copa America from June 20 - July 14, finishing less than two weeks before the Games start."
