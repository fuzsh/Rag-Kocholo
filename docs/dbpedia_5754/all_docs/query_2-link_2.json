        "text": "Inter Miami CF captain Lionel Messi and midfielder Facundo FarÃ­as have been called up to represent the Argentine National team for their 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifying matches this month.\n\nLa Albiceleste will play the first host Paraguay at the Estadio Monumental in Buenos Aires, Argentina on Thursday, Oct. 12 at 7 p.m. ET. The 2022 World Cup winners will then travel to Peru for the teamâs second qualifying match during the international break on Tuesday, Oct. 17 at 10 p.m. ET at the Estadio Nacional de Lima in Lima, Peru.\n\nFor Argentina, Messi holds the records for most caps (175), most goals (103), and most World Cup goals (13), while also holding the international record for most World Cup match appearances (26) and being the only player to score in the World Cup group stage, round of 16, quarterfinals, semifinals and final. He has also been key in making history for La Albiceleste, leading the teamâs historic 2021 CONMEBOL Copa AmÃ©rica, 2022 Finalissima and 2022 FIFA World Cup title wins. Messi most recently represented his countryâs national team during the Aug. international window, starting and scoring the winner from a set piece in a 1-0 win over Bolivia in the teamâs first 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifying fixture.\n\nFor FarÃ­as, meanwhile, the call up is his first for Argentinaâs senior side after previously representing Argentina at various youth levels.\n\nOn the club side, Messi has 12 appearances across all competitions so far since joining Inter Miami in the summer, registering an impressive 11 goals and eight assists. FarÃ­as, who also joined the Club in the summer, has registered three goals and three assists in 11 appearances so far this season. Notably, the Argentines helped Inter Miami to a historic win in the 2023 Leagues Cup to clinch the First Teamâs first official title in Club history, with Messi registering 10 goals and four assists en route to clinching the title."
