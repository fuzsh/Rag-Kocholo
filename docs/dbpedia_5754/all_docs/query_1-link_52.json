        "text": "Soccer fans around the world are rejoicing with the world's best on display in two separate tournaments across the globe − the UEFA European Championship taking place in Germany, and the Copa America across 14 different cities in the United States as it's now down to the semifinals in Copa America and a championship matchup between Spain and France in the UEFA European Championship on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nOne of the players competing in the Copa America semifinals is none other than Argentina's Lionel Messi, who set a record by playing in his 35th Copa America match earlier in the tournament.\n\nMessi and his fellow countrymen have a rematch against fellow Group A members Canada in New Jersey on Tuesday at MetLife Stadium with a spot for the Copa America Final on the line at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami on Sunday, July 14.\n\nIn group play, Messi recorded an assist on the opening goal in the 49th minute as Argentina defeated Canada 2-0 on June 20 at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta. Argentina advanced to the semifinals after winning 5-3 on penalties over Ecuador in the quarterfinals on the Fourth of July at NRG Stadium in Houston.\n\nWhile Messi, who turned 37 two weeks ago, will be back in the Meadowlands on Tuesday night, there's already some doubt he'll suit up for his country two years from now when the 2026 World Cup will be back in the Garden State, including the World Cup Final taking center stage at MetLife.\n\nHere's what we know about Messi's current status to suit up for the 2026 World Cup:\n\n'I don't know how I'm going to be at that moment'\n\nDespite saying the 2022 World Cup − where Argentina defeated Kylian Mbappe and France, 4-2, on penalties − would be his final one, Messi didn't rule out the possibility earlier this month in an interview via Infobae.co about being part of helping his country defend the title in North America in 2026.\n\n\"It depends on how I feel, how I am physically and being realistic with myself. And to know if I am up to the task of being able to compete and help the colleagues next to me,\" Messi said on June 7.\n\n\"There's a while left and I don't know how I'm going to be at that moment.\"\n\nWill Lionel Messi play in 2024 Olympics?\n\nThe eight-time Ballon d'Or winner has already ruled out representing Argentina for the 2024 Olympics in Paris later this month due to playing in Copa America and the Leagues Cup tournament coming up for his MLS squad Inter Miami.\n\nA reason why Messi would choose the MLS over the Olympics is that the Leagues Cup is sponsored by Apple, his media partner who played a pivotal role in getting him to come to the United States and play for Inter Miami.\n\nIt's clear that Messi had to choose one or the other here, with the Leagues Cup taking place July 26-Aug. 25 and the Olympics starting July 24 and going through Aug. 10.\n\nWill he or won't he: Messi playing in World Cup 2026\n\nAs of now, this truly feels like a toss up.\n\nWith the World Cup victory in 2022, Messi has accomplished just about everything you can in his 20-plus years at the professional level.\n\nThe only individual and team awards absent from his trophy case are the Coupe de France and the FIFA Puskas Award, which recognizes the best goal of the year despite having been nominated multiple times.\n\nThere's a good chance Messi will want to close the World Cup chapter on top, going out victorious in the most watched World Cup Final in history.\n\nMy true gut feeling tells me that despite him saying no more in the past and if he avoids a major injury over the next two years, Messi goes for one more run at the highest level, this time aiming to be a back-to-back, two-time World Cup winner for Argentina, who currently has the fourth-shortest odds at 10/1 (tied with Germany and Spain) on DraftKings Sportsbook in New Jersey.\n\nIf Messi does indeed participate and leads Argentina to another World Cup victory, it would be the first time since Brazil (1958, 1962) and just the third time in history a nation would win consecutive World Cups."
