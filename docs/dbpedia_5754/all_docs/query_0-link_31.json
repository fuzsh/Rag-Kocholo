        "text": "Immediately after Argentina’s U-23 men’s team qualified for the Paris Olympics, stories began to swirl about Lionel Messi’s possible inclusion in the squad as an over-age player – one of the three players over the age of 23 allowed for each team in the men’s tournament.\n\nOn Feb. 12, after Argentina defeated arch-rivals Brazil on the last day of the South American Pre-Olympic tournament in Venezuela to secure qualification, Argentina U-23 head coach Javier Mascherano addressed the possibility head-on.\n\n“I’ll talk to Leo. I’ve said that already,” Mascherano said. “Obviously he has an open invitation, but it will depend on his commitments. He has Copa América and a bunch of other important things in between. We’ll talk.”\n\nMessi is indeed set to feature at this year’s Copa América, in which Argentina will be the defending champions. Messi’s commitments there could last until July 14, the date of the final in Miami. The 36-year-old will then rejoin Inter Miami to defend another trophy — the MLS / Liga MX Leagues Cup that Inter Miami won last summer. That competition begins on July 26, the same day as the Olympics.\n\nLogistically, it’s impossible for Messi to commit to the Copa América, the Olympics and the Leagues Cup. And of those three, the Olympics is the clear outlier – there’s simply no reason why he’d consider playing in a U-23 tournament that he has already won (Messi won a gold medal with Argentina at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing).\n\n“That was another one of those great things that football has given me,” Messi said of the Olympics title to TyC Sports in 2019. “Everyone had told me that (the Olympics) were different, special and personally I agree with that.”\n\nAn Olympic gold medal is certainly prestigious, but Messi doesn’t need two. A second Copa América would be a far greater achievement, and the Leagues Cup will be the primary focus during Olympics time for Inter Miami – the club that pays his salary regularly.\n\nThat reality hasn’t stopped the Argentine press and other global outlets from fanning the flames of an unlikely story, with Mascherano at the center of it all.\n\nThe former FC Barcelona and Liverpool defensive midfielder benefits from the association, as he has been heavily criticized in his home country since taking charge of Argentina’s U-20s in 2021. Replacing Fernando Batista, who is now the head coach of the Venezuela senior men’s national team, Mascherano has looked in over his head in his first head coaching job.\n\nAfter crashing out of the South American U-20 Pre-World Cup tournament in 2023, losing three of four matches, Mascherano told reporters that he was willing to resign. His contract expired that February and he refused to extend his employment with the Argentina Football Association (AFA). But a sit down with Argentine head coach Lionel Scaloni and Messi changed everything.\n\nNot only did Messi and Scaloni urge Mascherano to stay, but they convinced him to take charge of the U-23 team, as well. Argentina was then named host of the U-20 World Cup last summer after FIFA stripped Indonesia of the designation. But even that gift from FIFA couldn’t prevent Argentina from disappointing again. Mascherano’s side were eliminated in the round of 16 by Nigeria.\n\nAfter a distinguished playing career with the national team, Mascherano remains highly respected in Argentina, but as a coach, the verdict isn’t as clear cut. Mascherano’s teams have scrapped and clawed their way to wins. They’ve played poorly at times and struggled to establish a tactical identity, despite a squad that features young players like MLS star Thiago Almada, Brighton’s Valentín Barco, Matías Soulé of Juventus (on loan with Frosinone), Tottenham’s Alejo Veliz (on loan with Sevilla), and new Inter Miami midfielder Federico Redondo.\n\nWith qualification now secured, adding Messi to the squad would provide a huge boost to Argentina’s chances – and Mascherano’s stock as a coach.\n\nIn October of last year, Mascherano gave an interview in Argentina and said that “the doors are open” for Messi to do as he pleases with the national team. “If we qualify and (Messi) wants to come with us, he’ll be welcome,” said Mascherano. “We have a very strong relationship and I would absolutely love it.” Mascherano’s close relationship with Messi – having been his teammate for years with Barcelona and Argentina – gives credence to the notion that Messi may actually consider going to Paris. When Mascherano mentions Messi, people listen.\n\nInter Miami manager Tata Martino, though, would feel differently, as would MLS and league broadcaster Apple TV, which will carry the Leagues Cup on its Season Pass streaming channel. In the inaugural edition last summer, Messi scored 10 goals in seven matches.\n\n“Honestly no, I haven’t talked about (the Olympics) with him,” Martino said with a laugh when asked earlier this month. “But I’ve read the reports. I’ve learned over the years that I shouldn’t pay attention to everything that I read.”\n\nA week later, Martino told Deportes Total USA that Inter Miami’s Paraguayan midfielder Diego Gómez would have to choose between playing at the Olympics or featuring for his country at the Copa América. The question, though, was about whether Messi would have to decide between the two competitions. Clubs can’t hold players from playing at the Copa América, Martino said, but they won’t be obligated to release them for the Olympics.\n\n“I have no problem with the players choosing, but they can only play in one,” said Martino. “They can’t be gone for two months. No one would do that.”\n\nMartino knows better than to make a public decision for Messi. It’s a negative headline that Martino doesn’t want any part of. Ultimately, Messi, Mascherano or Scaloni will have to end all speculation. Messi doesn’t speak to reporters very often, and so it’s Mascherano who should end this situation, one that has gone as far as placing Messi as Argentina’s flag bearer in Paris.\n\nIn the end, even if Messi were to go to the Olympics, he might not be welcomed with open arms given his disappointing stint at Paris Saint-Germain. Former PSG winger Jerome Rothen, now an outspoken pundit in France, urged fans to jeer Messi if he were to play at the Olympics.\n\n“We should not forget what he has not given,” Rothen said on his podcast. “As a French and a Parisian, seeing him parading with Argentina? Guys, if there is any way to dispute the fact that Messi took the piss on us for two years, boo him.”\n\nSince leaving PSG and joining Inter Miami, Messi has said that living in Paris was a challenge for him and his family. Surely he’ll want to avoid being an unnecessary distraction for a young Argentina team that wants to make a name for themselves. That’s one more reason for Mascherano and AFA to put an end to the rumors.\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nLionel Messi's jersey is Adidas' top seller across all sports, MLS commissioner says\n\n(Top photo: Roman Kruchinin/Getty Images)"
