        "text": "Lionel Messi does not stop achieving records with the Argentina National Team, in addition to everything he contributes to the achievements that the Albiceleste has achieved since he made his debut against Hungary on August 17, 2005.\n\nThe new one was achieved by the Inter Miami star against Ecuador in the friendly match that Argentina won 1-0 in front of 85,000 spectators at the Soldier Field stadium (Chicago) in the 56th minute of the match, when Lionel Scaloni put him on in place of Angel Di Maria.\n\nWith this appearance, Messi's first with the Albiceleste in 2024, he played his 181st match for a World Cup-winning country, leaving behind Sergio Ramos, who has made 180 appearances with Spain. It is a record which will continue to be extended at the Copa America, that Cristiano Ronaldo could never match due to the obvious fact that he has not yet won a World Cup with the Portugal national team.\n\nThe anecdotal and curious fact is that Messi also managed to add another record in the match he played against Ecuador in the Conmebol qualifiers by scoring the only goal in the Albiceleste's 1-0 victory."
