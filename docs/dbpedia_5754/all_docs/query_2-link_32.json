        "text": "Jason Pettigrove@ @jaypetti1971Contributor I\n\n6 Little-Known Facts About Barcelona's Lionel Messi\n\n0 of 6\n\nUSA TODAY Sports\n\nLionel Messi has had so much written about him over the years that you wonder if there is anything left to uncover, or some little details that may have been overlooked.\n\nPerhaps there are the odd few facts that are not known to the masses.\n\nOver the next six slides, B/R attempt to uncover something that you might not have previously known, either personally or professionally, about the world's greatest footballer.\n\nLet's take a look...\n\nHis Favorite Food Is Milanesa Napolitana\n\n1 of 6\n\nThere would appear to be one particular food that Lionel Messi has enjoyed throughout his life: Milanesa Napolitana.\n\nA favourite in Argentina, the dish is made with a variety of ingredients such as ham, salt, oregano, fried beef, chopped tomatoes, onions, cheese and sugar.\n\nIn Luca Caoili's book \"Messi,\" Lionel's mother Celia describes how she cooks her son's favourite dish and notes:\n\nLionel has simple gastronomic tastes: schnitzel, but not made with ham or horsemeat; chicken with a sauce made of pepper, onions, tomatoes and oregano. He doesn't care much for elaborate dishes.\n\nHungry yet?!\n\nCould Have Played for Spain\n\n2 of 6\n\nDavid Ramos/Getty Images\n\nLionel Messi is heading for Brazil this summer looking to spearhead Argentina's charge to glory in the backyard of their fiercest rivals.\n\nPopular opinion would suggest that if the albiceleste are able to emerge victorious in the tournament that Messi will cement his place in history as the best footballer to have ever played the game.\n\nHowever, things could've been much different.\n\nIn Spain since the age of 13, Messi has dual nationality and qualified to play for Spain. Per Biography Online, he was asked to play for the Spanish U20 side in 2004 but turned down the opportunity and instead turned out a year later and led Argentina to victory in the FIFA Youth Championship.\n\nGraham Hunter noted in his book \"Barca - The making of the greatest team in the world\" via Nicky Salapu of The Guardian:\n\nJust imagine it for a second – Messi up front for this Spain team. He'd have been more appreciated, he'd have won more trophies, he'd have been playing with club-mates and friends and he'd have been far from the first Argentinian to jump ship to La Roja.\n\nIt was never an option however, as Messi himself said:\n\nI would have never played for Spain. I'm Argentinian and no one and nothing can change what I feel for the Argentinian colours.\n\nSent off After 44 Seconds of His Argentina Senior Debut\n\n3 of 6\n\nAugust 2005, in the 65th minute of a match against Hungary, an 18-year-old Lionel Messi replaced Lisandro Lopez to make his debut at senior level for the Argentinian national side.\n\nJust 44 seconds later his match was over. Sent off for a flailing arm in the direction of Hungary's Vilmos Vanczak.\n\nNicky Salapu of The Guardian notes:\n\nLionel Messi is sitting in the corner of the Argentina dressing room in the Ferenc Puskas Stadium. His head is in his hands, tears are in his eyes. It is not supposed to end like this.\n\nVideo of the incident (above) showed the youngster was only trying to escape the shirt tugging of his opponent and the referee Markus Merk was all too ready to brandish the red card.\n\nNot the way you imagine Messi expected his debut to pan out.\n\nHis Real Name Is Luis\n\n4 of 6\n\nGonzalo Arroyo Moreno/Getty Images\n\nKnown all around the world simply as Lionel Messi, the player was actually born into this world on June 24, 1987 in Rosario, Argentina as Luis Lionel Andres Messi, per Biography.com.\n\nIt's unclear why the player, or indeed his parents, chose for him to be known as Lionel, so various accounts—including Sam Kelly's at ESPN—that he was named after American crooner Lionel Richie are therefore incorrect.\n\nHis Heritage Is Italian\n\n5 of 6\n\nDavid Ramos/Getty Images\n\nBorn and raised in Argentina. Now holds dual nationality as a naturalised Spaniard. But Lionel Messi's family heritage actually belongs in Italy.\n\nRecanati is a town in the Province of Macerata in the east of the country and it is here where the paternal ancestors of Barcelona's No. 1 son have their origins, according to the town's Wikipedia page.\n\nRajath Kumar of Forza Italian Football actually suggests it is Ancona where the Messi family were based, with ancestor Angelo Messi emigrating to Argentina in 1883.\n\nHe Is Related to Bojan Krkic\n\n6 of 6\n\nX"
