Messi has scored seven goals from seven games in Qatar.\n\nThe PSG star is no stranger to trophy-deciding matches, but even with his win in Qatar he boasts a mixed record on the big stage for club and country.\n\nMORE: Messi breaks another record at Qatar 2022\n\nLionel Messi in finals with Argentina\n\nMessi's international career began in sensational fashion when he fired Argentina to the Under-20 World Cup crown in 2005.\n\nThree years later, Messi would then assist the winning goal as Argentina also claimed gold at the 2008 Olympic Games.\n\nSilverware wasn't so easy to come by at senior level though, as Messi lost his first four finals with the team before finally lifting the Copa America title in 2021.\n\nMessi scored his first goals for Argentina's senior team in a final with his double against France at Qatar 2022.\n\nDate Competition Result Messi goals Messi assists Messi minutes July 2,\n\n2005 U20 World Cup Argentina 2\n\nNigeria 1 2 0 90 July 15,\n\n2007 Copa America Argentina 0\n\nBrazil 3 0 0 90 Aug. 23,\n\n2008 Olympics Argentina 1\n\nNigeria 0 0 1 90 July 13,\n\n2014 World Cup Argentina 0\n\nGermany 1 0 0 120 July 4,\n\n2015 Cope America Argentina 0 (1)\n\nChile 0 (4) 0 0 120 June 27,\n\n2016 Copa America\n\nCentenario Argentina (2)\n\nChile (4) 0 0 120 July 11,\n\n2021 Copa America Argentina 1\n\nBrazil 0 0 0 90 June 1,\n\n2022 Finalissima Argentina 3\n\nItaly 0 0 2 90 December 18, 2022 World Cup Argentina 3 France 3 (Argentina win 4-2 on penalties) 2 1 120\n\nMessi's finals record overall with Argentina\n\nGames Wins Losses Goals Assists 9 5 4 4 3\n\nLionel Messi in 2014 World Cup final\n\nOne of Messi's most painful defeats came in the 2014 World Cup final against Germany.\n\nArgentina wasted a number of great chances to open the scoring before conceding the only goal in extra time.\n\nWhile Messi had starred at the tournament in Brazil and won the Golden Ball as a result, he wasn't at his best in the final.\n\nThe attacker had just 66 touches of the ball and put his one real opportunity to score wide of goal in the final.\n\nMessi will be hoping to avoid a repeat of the 2014 result and performance when Argentina compete in the 2022 World Cup final.\n\nMORE: Latest on Messi injury scare ahead of 2022 World Cup final\n\nLionel Messi in finals with Barcelona, PSG\n\nMessi's success rate in finals at club level is much better than his international one.\n\nWhile his first final with Barcelona ended in a 3-0 defeat in the UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla in 2006, the Argentine would win his next four finals.\n\nOverall, Messi has been victorious in 18 of the 23 single-leg finals he's played in at club level to date and scored an impressive 19 goals across those matches.\n\nMessi has also never been subbed off in a final for club and country - a sign of his importance and determination to win when a trophy is on the line.\n\nDate Competition Result Messi goals Messi assists Messi minutes Aug. 25,\n\n2006 UEFA Super Cup Barcelona 0\n\nSevilla 3 0 0 90 May 13,\n\n2009 Copa del Rey Barcelona 4\n\nAthletic 1 1 1 90 May 27,\n\n2009 UEFA Champions League Barcelona 2\n\nManchester United 0 1 0 90 Aug. 28,\n\n2009 UEFA Super Cup Barcelona 1\n\nShakhtar Donetsk 0 0 1 120 Dec. 19,\n\n2009 Club World Cup Barcelona 2\n\nEstudiantes 1 1 0 120 Apr. 20,\n\n2011 Copa del Rey Barcelona 0\n\nReal Madrid 1 0 0 120 May 28,\n\n2011 UEFA Champions League Barcelona 3\n\nManchester United 1 1 0 90 Aug. 26,\n\n2011 UEFA Super Cup Barcelona 2\n\nPorto 0 1 1 90 Dec. 18,\n\n2011 Club World Cup Barcelona 4\n\nSantos FC 0 2 0 90 May 25,\n\n2012 Copa del Rey Barcelona 3\n\nAthletic 0 1 0 90 Apr. 16,\n\n2014 Copa del Rey Barcelona 1\n\nReal Madrid 2 0 0 90 May 30,\n\n2015 Copa del Rey Barcelona 3\n\nAthletic 1 2 0 90 June 6,\n\n2015 UEFA Champions League Barcelona 3\n\nJuventus 1 0 1 90 Aug. 11,\n\n2015 UEFA Super Cup Barcelona 5\n\nSevilla 4 2 1 120 Dec. 20,\n\n2015 Club World Cup Barcelona 3\n\nRiver Plate 0 1 0 90 May 22,\n\n2016 Copa del Rey Barcelona 2\n\nSevilla 0 0 2 120 May 27,\n\n2017 Copa del Rey Barcelona 3\n\nAlaves 1 1 1 90 Apr. 21,\n\n2018 Copa del Rey Barcelona 5\n\nSevilla 0 1 2 90 Aug. 12,\n\n2018 Supercopa Barcelona 2\n\nSevilla 1 0 2 90 May 25,\n\n2019 Copa del Rey Barcelona 1\n\nValencia 2 1 0 90 Jan. 17,\n\n2021 Supercopa Barcelona 2\n\nReal Sociedad 3 0 0 120 Apr. 17,\n\n2021 Copa del Rey Barcelona 4\n\nAthletic 0 2 0 90 July 31,\n\n2022 Trophee des Champions PSG 4\n\nFC Nantes 0 1 0 90\n\nMessi's finals record overall at club level"
