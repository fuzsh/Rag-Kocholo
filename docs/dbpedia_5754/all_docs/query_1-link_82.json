In total, 13.6 million people tuned into the tournament.\n\nFor regular season matches in the MLS that were broadcast on national television before Messi’s arrival, the average viewership was 250,000 viewers.\n\nNot only is the left-winger changing the sport for the country, he is changing the culture that surrounds it."
