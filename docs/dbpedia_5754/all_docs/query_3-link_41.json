I know when I am good, when I am bad, when I play well, when I play badly... And when I feel it is time to take that step, I will take it without thinking about age. If I feel good, I will always try to continue competing, because it is what I like and what I know how to do.\"\n\nAn eight-time Ballon d'Or winner, Messi, who captained Argentina to World Cup glory in 2022, is expected to lead his national team at this summer's Copa Am√©rica.\n\n\"Had things not gone the way they did [in the tournament in Qatar], I would have left the national team,\" Messi said.\n\nMessi is sidelined with a hamstring injury and missed his national team's two international friendly wins over El Salvador and Costa Rica.\n\nArgentina coach Lionel Scaloni said Messi is the only player to have a guaranteed place in his squad.\n\n\"I keep analysing everyone, but no one has a guaranteed place, except for the one who couldn't be here,\" Scaloni said in reference to Messi after Tuesday's 3-1 win against Costa Rica in Los Angeles.\n\nInter Miami coach Gerardo \"Tata\" Martino recently said Messi has the same desire to win now as he had when he coached him at Barcelona.\n\nMessi became the most decorated football player of all time when he won his 44th trophy after helping Inter Miami lift the 2023 Leagues Cup in August.\n\n\"On a sporting level I was lucky to be able to achieve everything in my career, to have achieved my dreams and the truth is that I couldn't ask for more both from a professional and human level, as well as with my family, my friends. I try to enjoy everything that God has given me so far, which is a lot.\"\n\nMessi said he has not decided what he will do once he stops playing football.\n\n\"The truth is I haven't thought about it yet,\" he said. \"Today I try to enjoy the day to day, the moments, without thinking about what comes after.\n\n\"I don't have anything clear yet, I hope to continue playing for a while longer, which is what I like. When the time comes, I will surely find the way to what fulfills me, what I like and a new role.\""
