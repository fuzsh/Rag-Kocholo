The games that I am going to play are not the same as the ones I played when I was in Europe in competition, which were every three days, or in the UEFA Champions League or in the league where I was, both in France [with Paris Saint-Germain] and in Spain [with Barcelona].\n\n“But it depends on how I feel and how I feel when I'm next to my team-mates and see if I'm still up to the task or not.”\n\nFor now, Messi’s focus is on the retaining the Copa America, which begins on June 20 when Argentina face Canada in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nLUSAIL CITY, QATAR - DECEMBER 18: Lionel Messi of Argentina celebrates with the World Cup Trophy during the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 Final match between Argentina and France at Lusail Stadium on December 18, 2022 in Lusail City, Qatar.

Uruguay is very good, Colombia, Ecuador. Then it becomes very difficult to play all the games, but I think it will be a very equal Copa America.”\n\n- - -\n\nTNT Sports presents the premium live sports rights previously carried by BT Sport including the Premier League, UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League, UEFA Conference League, Gallagher Premiership Rugby, Investec Champions Cup, EPCR Challenge Cup, MotoGP, Cricket, UFC, Boxing and WWE.
