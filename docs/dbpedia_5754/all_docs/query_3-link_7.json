        "text": "Megan Briggs/Getty Images\n\nAfter previously declaring that the 2022 World Cup would be his last, Lionel Messi has left the door open for him to compete for Argentina in 2026.\n\n\"It depends on how I feel, how I am physically and knowing whether I'm at the level to be able to compete and help my teammates,\" Messi said in an interview with InfoBae, per The Athletic's Colin Millar.\n\nAfter scoring twice in the World Cup final against France and also scoring in the penalty shootout to give Argentina its first World Cup title since 1986, it seemed like Messi would ride off into the sunset. However, he's still active in international football and will represent Argentina as they try to defend their Copa America title this summer.\n\nMessi would be 38 years old by the 2026 World Cup, which is set to be hosted across the United States, Mexico and Canada, and he would turn 39 during the tournament.\n\nThe legendary footballer added that his battle with Father Time is not an easy one, especially considering that he's still active with the MLS club Inter Miami.\n\n\"There is still a long time until the tournament, but it goes quickly. I don't know how I will be in that moment and if I feel I will be at the level to help my teammates,\" Messi said. \"Age is also a reality, even if it is a number, and then there are my (club) games. They're not going to be the same as when I played in European competition, which were every three days; in the Champions League or league, either in France or Spain.\"\n\nMessi's Argentina teammate Alexis Mac Allister said last year that the team is pushing for him to return for the 2026 World Cup."
