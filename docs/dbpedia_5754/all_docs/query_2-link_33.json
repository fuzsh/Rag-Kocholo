        "text": "World Champions Argentina are one step closer to sealing another major international title following their 2-0 win over Canada to reach the Copa America final.\n\nLionel Messi scored his first goal of the tournament to double Argentina’s advantage after Manchester City’s Julian Alvarez gave Lionel Scaloni’s side a first-half lead.\n\nAfter the match, Messi praised the nation's “old guard” who have reached yet another final, which “gives more importance” to what they have achieved before.\n\nCopa América\n\nMessi named in Copa America Best 11 alongside Premier League stars Martinez and Romero\n\n01/08/2024 at 10:42\n\n“What this team has done, what the Argentina national team has done, because after this everyone gives more importance to all the finals that me and the 'older guys' have played,” the former Barcelona great said.\n\n“Me, Fide [Angel Di Maria], Ota [Nicolas Otamendi], and that Argentina can play another final is amazing.”\n\nArgentina had already beaten Canada by the same scoreline in the group stages, before overcoming Chile and Peru to top Group A with a perfect record.\n\nThey were held by Ecuador in the first knockout round before eventually advancing on penalties, despite Messi missing his spot-kick.\n\nHowever, the 37-year-old made up for it in the semi-final against Canada with a goal to put the country in their 30th Copa America final as they chase a record-extending 16th title.\n\n“To be honest it has been a difficult tournament, the level has been as equal as ever, very bad surfaces, high temperatures that make it hard to play, very tough rivals,” Messi added.\n\n“So the fact we made it and we are here again playing a final is something to enjoy and highlight.\"\n\nArgentina head coach Scaloni insisted it is “super difficult” to reach the Copa America final, especially with their illustrious record in the competition.\n\n“It's something to be proud of and grateful to the players for. Yesterday, a colleague asked me if we normalize this, but the question was good and I wasn't clear.\n\n“It's super difficult to be in a final, especially coming in the way we did with previous success and triumph. It's double as hard.\n\n“The ones on the inside know how difficult it is to reach this point. It's a sensation of happiness, but also worry because it costs more.”\n\nArgentina will play either Uruguay or Colombia in the final this weekend, which could be Messi or Angel Di Maria’s final game for the national side.\n\n“You know how I think, we wait and see how he plays,” Scaloni said on 36-year-old Di Maria.\n\n“We won't retire him early before the game, then the tears will start and everyone, his family, will get melancholic.\n\n“We'll see later if we convince him or not convince him, but for now we let him play.\n\n“It's the same case for Messi. We leave them calm from our part, we won't be the ones to close the door on them.\n\n“He can be with us until he wants, and even after he retires he can join me if I'm still coach. And if not I'll take him where I go. He would be a great help.”\n\ndiscovery+ is the streaming home of the Olympic Games, and the only place you can watch every moment of Paris 2024 this summer.\n\nOlympic Games Paris 2024\n\nFootball at the Olympics: Who has won most titles?
