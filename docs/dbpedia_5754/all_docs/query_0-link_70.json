        "text": "Former Argentina manager Marcelo Bielsa had had more than enough of his job long before he left it, but he didn't want to leave it \"without winning something\". So he led the country's football squad to Olympic gold in Athens in 2004 and promptly quit saying \"I have what I came for\".\n\nMany felt his performance at the 2002 World Cup - when Argentina didn't even make it past the first round - was the main legacy of his tenure, but others took the victory at the Olympics as a return to the comfort zone of 'best in the world' category Argentinians so relish.\n\nOlympic football has always been a bit of an oddity. Even this year the number of competing countries (16) dictates that the men's group stages kick off today - a whole day before the inaugural ceremony of the actual Olympics, thereby giving the football bit a kind of 'fringe' flavour.\n\nBut in fact Olympic football, on the handful of occasions in which it has been on the nation's radar, has been revered by Argentina as part and parcel of all things football; the country's favourite game. Daniel Passarella's side won silver in Atlanta 1996 - again a super antidote to 1994's excruciating World Cup failings. And for all that the tick would have us believe there's no such thing as winning silver ('just losing gold'), the trophy cabinets of the Argentinian Football Association are lined with the silver medals of the 1928 squad, when Domingo Tarrasconi became the top scorer of the event with nine goals. On the other two occasions in which medals were collected for the national coffers, players of the ilk of Hernan Crespo (1996) and Carlos Tevez (2004) also topped the goal scoring charts. With only five participations in the Olympics to date, that record is brilliant.\n\nSo when current national manager Coco Basile turned down the Olympic campaign preferring to concentrate on the World Cup qualifiers instead, youth manager Sergio 'Checho' Batista was more than ready for the challenge. A World Cup-winning player in 1986, Batista was appointed to take charge of youth football at the end of last year, and the Olympics - arguably the most important sporting event the world knows - will provide the ideal launch pad for him.\n\nThe expectation of success is huge - and the squad he has assembled more than fit to deliver. He first gathered a working draft of what would become the Olympic squad at the end of May in Barcelona. Then, Sergio Agüero, widely lauded as the next best player in the world, was joined by the likes of Fernando Gago, Gonzalo Higuaín, and none other than Lionel Messi. In a friendly against Catalunya, Messi played only 70 minutes by agreement with Basile, who wanted him fit and rested for an important fixture against Brazil a fortnight later. And when he came off, the only goal of the match came courtesy of Ezequiel Lavezzi, who is making an impact with Napoli.\n\nPerhaps that was the first taste Batista had of the nuances that come along with having Messi in a squad; up until now he has spent most of his press conferences fielding questions about the shared nature of his star player. This time, it is not the World Cup qualifiers and Basile who claim a slice of the young prodigy but rather Barcelona. Even back in May the Spanish giants were making no effort to hide their discontent at the idea of Messi missing out on pre-season training, and more crucially they want him available for the Champions League third qualifying round first-leg tie next week.\n\nAt the time, Messi spoke candidly of his dream of participating in the Olympics; of how his team-mates who had done so - both at club level as was the case with Ronaldinho for example, and at national level - had spoken to him of the superbly unique nature of the experience, and of how for him the national strip was an honour not to be easily snubbed. \"As a manager I would love to count with him in the squad,\" Batista told me, also back then, adding that he was confident the issue would be resolved between the relevant authorities.\n\nAnd that is the saga that has unfolded since, drip by drip, with one relevant authority after another taking it in turns to pronounce, appeal, refute and over-rule each other. The AFA, Fifa and the IOC have now been joined by the CAS - the Court for the Arbitration of Sport, who have been holding the trump card: yesterday they ruled that Messi should abide by his contract and Barcelona can demand he returns to Spain.\n\nThe argument in favour of Messi staying with the Olympic squad is based on the notion that an under-23 player should always be available for Olympic duty. Barcelona's argument is more reflective of the contractual nature of their relationship with Messi, looking to start the season as their most veteran and coveted professional. A new take on the old 'club versus country' tug with the twist of 21st-century Olympic reality, which is that everyone is a pro and the purity of the sporting spirit is becoming elusive.\n\nEither way, the issue has rather stolen the limelight from the squad as a whole, and it's impossible not to feel that to some extent preparations for their first game against Ivory Coast today will have been marred by the will-he-won't-he be staying nature of Messi's participation. Currently it looks set to continue as Messi and Batista claim the player will stay in China despite the CAS ruling.\n\nIt's a shame, I fear, because Argentina have enough talent and enough stories to keep the momentum going even without him."
