        "text": "Lionel Messi stated in an interview with ESPN on Wednesday that Inter Miami in the MLS will be his last team before ending his professional career. When asked about this final phase of his career, and whether he was “assuming there is less time,” the ESPN journalist commented that “the soccer world is not prepared” for when Messi retires. “I don't think I am either. I have done this all my life, I love playing soccer, I enjoy training, the day-to-day of the matches... And yes, there is always a bit of fear that it will all end,” Messi pointed out.\n\nThe genius from Rosario, who will turn 37 in a couple of weeks, is the standout player for Inter Miami, where he shares a dressing room with former teammates and friends from Barcelona such as Luis Suárez, Sergio Busquets, and Jordi Alba.\n\nI have to choose the right moments and I think it would be too much to do two tournaments in a row”\n\nLionel Messi also confirmed that he will not be part of the Argentine national team for the Paris Olympics because he is no longer of age to play in all tournaments. “I spoke with 'Masche' and the truth is that we both understood the situation,” Messi told ESPN.\n\nThe 36-year-old striker from Inter Miami is currently preparing to defend Argentina's title in the Copa America, which will take place from June 20 to July 14 in the United States. In February, the U-23 coach, Javier Mascherano, stated that Messi, who won the gold medal with Argentina at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, had an invitation to join the squad in Paris.\n\n“It's a tough moment because now we have the Copa America. It would be two, three months straight away from the club, and especially at this age, I'm not up for playing non-stop.”\n\n“I have to choose the right moments, and I think it would be too much to do two tournaments in a row. I was very fortunate to be in an Olympic Games, to have won it alongside 'Masche'.”\n\n“Olympic Games, Under-20 World Cup... memories I will never forget.” The men's football tournament at the Olympic Games takes place in July and August. Teams can include three players over the age of 23 in their squads."
