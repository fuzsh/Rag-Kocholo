        "text": "Messi ended the season as the top scorer in Spain and Europe with 50 goals, a record in La Liga, while his 73 goals in all competitions surpassed 67 goals from Gerd Muller in the 1972-73 Bundesliga season, making Messi the best scorer in European football history in a single season.\n\nAt the end of the year, Messi had a record of 91 goals in all competitions with Barcelona and Argentina, surpassing Gerd Muller’s 85 goals in 1972 for Bayern Munich and Germany.\n\nIn the 2022 FIFA World Cup final, Messi made his record 26th World Cup finals appearance at Lusail Stadium.\n\nMessi scored Argentina's opening goal with a penalty but after Argentina's eventual two-goal lead was erased by France forward Kylian Mbappe, who scored twice inside two minutes, Messi would score again in extra-time to restore Argentina's lead, before Mbappé again drew France level. Tied 3-3 after extra-time, the match went to a penalty shoot-out. Messi scored Argentina's first goal in the shoot-out, with Argentina eventually winning 4-2, ending the nation's 36-year wait for the trophy.\n\nMessi, who broke many records in the tournament also won the Golden Ball as the best player with 7 goals and 3 assists."
