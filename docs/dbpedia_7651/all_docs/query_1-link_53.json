        "text": "For regulars on the UK house music scene, Lauren Lo Sung will be household name. The Liverpool-born DJ, producer and club promoter cut her teeth with LOLiFE, the no-frills, stripped-back house and techno night she launched over a decade ago at the age of 18, and her prowess as an artist has, alongside the fortunes of her club night, skyrocketed ever since.\n\nLOLiFE now ships its house party charm to clubs all over Europe and has expanded into a mix series and label. Lauren has explored new horizons as an artist, too, honing in on deeper, peak-time grooves and grabbing studio time in around a heavy touring schedule, a residency at Birmingham's TRMNL, and her involvement with E1even Records alongside Sian Bennett.\n\nWith extra time on her hands recently, Lauren has been weaving her production magic. A new track called Lucid Dreams – a gloriously trippy blend of gutsy kicks, shimmering pads and synths – landed on the charity compilation CARE4LIFE, which also featured The Chemical Brothers, Daniel Avery and Groove Armada. And she recently announced LOLiFE 003 – a new EP, titled Momentum, set to drop later this year featuring a remix from East End Dubs.\n\nTo get us back in the groove, Lauren has also put together an exclusive Choice Mix for us that expresses our shared longing to get back on the dancefloor.\n\n“I’m really liking a lot of ‘90s-style electro house at the moment,” she explains, “so there’s quite a bit of that in the mix as well as my usual deep, groovy bits. There’s also four of my own productions: Momentum and Hypnotise, both out on LOLiFE with Miss B, and Cosmic Flow, coming later in the year on one of my all-time favourite labels… to be announced! I hope you guys like it.”"
