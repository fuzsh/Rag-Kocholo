[laughs]\n\nAnd my drag name the first night I went out was\n\nJizzney Princess. [crew laughing]\n\nAnd I quickly dropped it after the first time.\n\nWhat's next? [electronic music]\n\n[Queen] Yes! [Dax gasps]\n\nMy name is Kim Chi\n\nand I came here to destroy everyone.\n\nI made onto the show first time I applied.\n\nIt was very surreal,\n\nand also I'm like naturally a very cautious person.\n\nPart of me is like, Am I getting scammed right now?\n\nLike If I go to LA, like will I get kidnapped\n\nand like wake up in a bathtub with my organs missing?\n\n[Kim laughs]\n\nI think my personal favorite look that I wore\n\nis the hanbok I wore in like the book ball challenge.\n\nYou know, that is like the one look like,\n\neven if I go home first,\n\nlike I hope I get to show this look on television\n\nbecause I have to show a traditional Korean outfit\n\non like a national television.\n\nI mean to be honest, like when I went on 'Drag Race',\n\nmy goal was never to win.\n\nMy goal was just like,\n\nmake it far enough to be remembered. [laughs]\n\nBecause it doesn't matter like how great you are.\n\nEvery winner gets so much hate from people saying like\n\nSo and so should have won.\n\nAnd that just kind of like follows them\n\nfor like the rest of their career.\n\nMaybe the only exception is maybe Bianca Del Rio.\n\nBut like everybody else, you know.\n\nAnd I just like didn't want to deal with that.\n\nThe real race is after 'Drag Race'\n\nand like what happens after that.\n\nAnd if you had a bad week,\n\nyour inboxes get just like filled with like\n\nhate messages from like random people.\n\nAnd then if you had a great week,\n\nyour like tagged photos are just like filled with fan art.\n\n[Kim laughs]\n\nSo after I won the first episode, I got $3,000 as a prize\n\nand I knew at the time I was talking to my mom\n\nand she was like struggling financially.\n\nSo I sent her the money and I told her it was\n\nmoney I earned through doing like makeup gigs.\n\nAnd then she googled the email address,\n\nlike where the money was from\n\nand then she found all this stuff about Kim Chi.\n\nAnd then she calls me up\n\nand the first thing she asked was,\n\nHow much money do you make doing this?\n\nAnd I told her and she was like,\n\nKeep living your dream. [laughs]\n\n'Cause for Asian parents, you know like,\n\nfinancial success equates to success.\n\nAnd I think at the end of the day\n\nthey just wanna see us like live comfortably\n\nand not struggle like the way they did.\n\nOh, I know what's coming up.\n\n[electronic music] ♪ Yeah, fat, fem and Asian ♪\n\n♪ Fat, fem and Asian ♪\n\nWhen I first started performing,\n\nI would only purposely pick Korean pop songs.\n\nAnd this is before like BTS and like,\n\neven American public knew about K-pop.\n\nIn my own way, I was forcing my culture\n\ninto the gay night life.\n\nSo when people come to the drag show\n\nand I'm performing a K-pop song,\n\nthey have no choice but to listen to the K-pop song.\n\nSo the moment that inspired the song 'Fat Fem and Asian'\n\nwas when on 'Drag Race', when I talked about how\n\nin a lot of gay dating apps,\n\na lot of people would have in their profile\n\nNo fats, no fem, no Asian.\n\nAnd this is before like the woke culture.\n\nAnd nowadays like you don't find that\n\nlike in the gay dating profile,\n\nbut back then that was just like a common thing.\n\nNo spice, no rice, no fats, no fem, no Asian.\n\nAnd as a person who is like pretty much like all the above,\n\nyou know, you always feel like alienated\n\nand you almost don't feel like welcome in gay spaces.\n\nSo then I talked about that moment in the show\n\nand then that inspired the whole\n\n'Fat Fem and Asian' performance.\n\nSo I was very nervous when I performed this.\n\nI'm like scared shitless the entire time.\n\nAnd on top of that, when we were rehearsing,\n\nthe cage of the skirt kept catching into my heel,\n\nwhich like sunk the entire skirt like in half.\n\nThe whole time I'm just wishing like,\n\nOh my God, I hope I don't step on the skirt,\n\nI hope I don't fall.\n\nI was like a nervous wreck.\n\nBut then afterwards a lot of people loved this performance,\n\nwhich thank you. [laughs]\n\nThank you.\n\nAnd with that, let's talk about my favorite makeup line,\n\nKim Chic Beauty.\n\n[bright music]\n\n[indistinct vocalizing]\n\nSo when I first started doing drag,\n\nat the time there weren't that many products in the market\n\nthat were super pigmented.\n\nYou get a big variety and cheap at the same time.\n\nIf you want to get good products you'd have to pay so much.\n\nAnd I want to try as many different products as possible.\n\nBut you know, on a poor drag queens budget,\n\nlike that just wasn't possible.\n\nSo when I told myself like if I ever built a makeup company,\n\nI want to create makeup from someone who works like\n\na nine to five corporate job to like, clowns can wear.\n\nI want to be all inclusive.\n\nWith drag becoming like so popular nowadays,\n\nlike normalization of like makeup being unisex,\n\nyou know like makeup doesn't have gender\n\nand anyone can wear makeup.\n\nI think like that allows for like more kids to\n\nbe able to like be themselves nowadays,\n\nyou know, compared to like how we were.\n\nBut I don't think that's just like makeup alone,\n\nbut that goes for like a lot of other things.\n\nWhen I was in middle school,\n\nI brought like Korean food to school for lunch\n\nand all the kids were like,\n\nEw, that's disgusting, like what is that smell?\n\nWe call it like the lunchbox trauma.\n\nAnd ever since then, like I had never brought\n\nKorean food to school like till the day I graduated.\n\nBut nowadays kids are bringing Korean food to school\n\nand the other kids are like, Oh I know what that is.\n\nLike Can I, you know, can I have some?\n\nAnd when I hear stories like that like,\n\nit's like the world is changing for the better,\n\nlittle by little. [laughs]\n\nAnd same goes for makeup, you know.\n\nI feel like back in the like the 90s and even early 2000s,\n\nif you were a guy that wore like makeup day to day,\n\nyou were either seen as just like really gay\n\nor you know, like out there.\n\nBut nowadays if you see men with makeup,\n\nlike you don't even think much of it.\n\nNext! [upbeat music]\n\nGet that cheese pool.\n\nWait, what is that? [dramatic music]\n\n[Kim] Hardboiled egg. Oh, okay.\n\nSo obviously I've known Trixie for a long time\n\nand I know her eating habits very well.\n\nI know eating habits of all of my friends really well.\n\nAnd I knew Trixie wouldn't like most of the food\n\nI ordered for her, but you know,\n\nI still wanted her to try it.\n\nYou know, whether you like it or not,\n\nyou gotta try everything at least once\n\nto know that you don't like it for sure.\n\nBecause her reaction is like so genuine\n\nwhen she like doesn't like something,\n\nit's extra hilarious because it's so like apparent\n\nthat she genuinely from the bottom of her heart\n\nwill never eat this again. [laughs]\n\nAnd maybe I secretly enjoy torturing Trixie a little.\n\nI feel like more people have seen this video\n\nthan me on 'Drag Race'.\n\nLike I get so many random people like coming up to me\n\nand saying, Oh, I saw your video with Trixie\n\nand they're always referring to this particular video.\n\nI think because Trixie was on 'Drag Race' first,\n\na lot of fans are like,\n\nYou're just like a Trixie like copycat.\n\nBut it's like not true at all.\n\nI just wanna make it clear here\n\nthat we were both doing the white under-eye liner thing.\n\nAnd I think just working with each other we just like,\n\nyou know, like amplified each other.\n\nTrixie and I talk about to this day,\n\nlike doing drag back in that day\n\nwas some of the most fun we've ever had in drag.\n\nThe audience just like, loved whatever you're doing.\n\nAnd there was like no preconceived notion of like,\n\ndrag performing has to be like this or this or that.\n\nWe did crazy things like Celine Dion shows and\n\nor a pizza themed show where every number is about pizza.\n\n[Kim laughs]\n\nEven though drag has like evolved so much,\n\nI feel like because like a lot of people's like exposure\n\nto drag is through 'Drag Race',\n\nI think a lot of people have a hard time seeing like\n\ndrag outside of like that format.\n\nYou'll see like a lot of people like,\n\nOh I need my drag performers, you know,\n\nto be able to like dance or like do these tricks.\n\nOr some people are like,\n\nOh I want my drag queens to be like extremely funny.\n\nTo me what makes a great show is a variety\n\nof like different talents, like coming together.\n\nSo if I go to a drag show, I wanna see like, you know,\n\none queen who's like an amazing dancer\n\nthat turns and did tricks.\n\nI wanna see like a look queen come out in like\n\na really cool look that I would've like\n\nnever thought of on my own.\n\nAnd maybe, you know, lip sync toss down\n\nto like a beautiful ballad.\n\nAnd then I wanna see like a funny queen come out\n\nand you know, just make me laugh.\n\nI wanna see like a messy queen come out\n\nand just give me like dirty grungy drag.\n\nLike I want to see a little bit of everything.\n\nI don't want to see just one thing like the entire time.\n\nAnd I feel like that makes for a very boring show.\n\nMoving on. [upbeat music]\n\nWelcome to another episode of 'One for the Table'.\n\nJon, I met during Motor City Pride in 2016.\n\nIt was actually one of like the first gigs I did\n\nafter I was on 'Drag Race'.\n\nAnd I was just like chilling in the dressing room\n\nand Jon Kung just like stumbled in drunk with his friend\n\nand I'm like, Who is this Asian guy and why is he in here?\n\nI'm like, Are you gay and single?\n\nAnd he's like, No.\n\nSo now I was like, Oh, okay, well get out of here.\n\n[Kim laughs]\n\nAnd then the tour organizer was like,\n\nDo you want me to take you out for dinner tonight\n\nor do you want me to get like a private chef\n\nto cook you a dinner?\n\nAnd I'm like, Private chef to cook me a dinner!\n\nI'm like, Yes, that sounds amazing.\n\nAnd turns out that chef was Jon.\n\nAnd then his friend drove his drunk ass to Whole Foods\n\nand he just bought like a lot of random ingredients\n\nand then just like started cooking.\n\nAnd I came over later that night. [laughs]\n\nAnd ate all the food that he made and it was amazing.\n\nAnd then we became friends since that day.\n\nAnd then whenever we get together,\n\nwe were always talking about food\n\nand then we realized like a lot of people just like\n\nlove to listen to us talk about food.\n\nSo I was like, Well why don't we do a podcast,\n\nput our talks on a global level? [laughs]\n\nAnd yeah, that's how our podcast happened.\n\nJust like how we travel,\n\nwe don't like planning things like too crazy.\n\nIt's more like two friends, you know, sitting at a table,\n\nyou know, catching up on our lives, discussing food.\n\nI've always been a... I hate the term Foodie, but...\n\n[laughs] I've always been like a foodie my entire life\n\nbecause I'm very passionate about food.\n\nAnd then during pandemic I was like,\n\nWell I'm not getting into drag every day,\n\nwhy don't I just make like random food content?\n\nSo it just kind of like started as a hobby.\n\nAnd I'm not trying to like take it too seriously\n\nbecause I don't want it to turn into work.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nI wanna be so rich to a point where\n\nI don't know how to use ATM.\n\nOr if someone asks me like,\n\nHow much does like a bag of potato chips cost?\n\nI have no idea.\n\nLike I wanna be out of touch rich.\n\nBut a realistic answer is\n\nI wanna have like a nice two bedroom home, maybe a pool\n\nand a big yard for my dog, puppy to run around.\n\nIt's the small things in life, you know?\n\nBut even that is like not possible in LA right now\n\nbecause of the housing prices and the interest rates, woof!\n\nThank you, Them, I had so much fun with you.\n\nThis has been 'Becoming Kim Chi'.\n\n[groovy music]"
