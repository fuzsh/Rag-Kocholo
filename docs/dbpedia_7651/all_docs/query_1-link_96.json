        "text": "These ‚ÄòDrag Race‚Äô original songs really snapped!\n\nVH1 / BBC / Logo TV\n\nOriginal songs on RuPaul‚Äôs Drag Race have historically been hit-or-miss, but quite a lot of them were actual certified bops that have us watching and streaming on repeat for years to come.\n\nFrom premiere episodes to girl-group challenges to Rumixes to semifinals to the grand finales, original songs have been featured in many different forms on Drag Race. These songs are always meant to serve the contestants who are performing them, in a way that really brands these queens with their unique drag perspectives and talents.\n\nAttaching great musicians, producers, and songwriters like Leland, Freddy Scott, MNEK, Todrick Hall, and AB Soto over different seasons of Drag Race has definitely improved the quality of the original songs to come out of the show in recent seasons. And yet, we still have our favorites, because duh!\n\nScroll through to find out our favorite original songs from RuPaul‚Äôs Drag Race, which is available for streaming on Paramount+.\n\n‚ÄúGoddess‚Äù - Sasha Colby\n\nwww.youtube.com\n\nSasha Colby Performs ‚ÄúGODDESS‚Äù üêç | RuPaul‚Äôs Drag Race Season 15\n\nShe didn't have to spell it out, but we are obsessed that she did. There's no denying that Drag Race season 15 winner Sasha Colby is a certified \"G.O.D.D.E.S.S,\" so this grand finale song was the perfect fit for the drag superstar that we humbly call MOTHER!\n\n‚ÄúUK Hun?‚Äù - United Kingdolls\n\nwww.youtube.com\n\nRuPaul's Drag Race UK Series 2 United Kingdolls \"UK Hun?\"\n\n\"UK Hun?\" by the United Kingdolls played a large role in establishing the girl-group challenge on Drag Race UK as a fan-favorite every single season. Tayce, Bimini, A'Whora, and Lawrence Chaney really snapped on this performance and turned \"UK Hun?\" into what is arguably the most popular and commercially successful song in the entire Drag Race franchise.\n\n‚ÄúI Hate People‚Äù - Willow Pill\n\nwww.youtube.com\n\nWillow Pill Performs ‚ÄúI Hate People‚Äù üòÇ RuPaul‚Äôs Drag Race Season 14\n\nWhen Willow Pill came out on stage with three heads and talking about how much she hates people, we could relate to it on such a deep level. \"I Hate People\" is a hilarious and campy song that definitely solidified Willow even further as the frontrunner to win season 14.\n\n‚ÄúFat, Fem & Asian‚Äù - Kim Chi\n\nwww.youtube.com\n\nRuPaul's Drag Race (Season 8 Finale) | Kim Chi's 'Fat, Fem & Asian' Performance | Logo\n\nKim Chi spent most of Drag Race season eight trying to prove herself as a compelling performer and entertainer ‚Äì not just a look queen. When she performed \"Fat, Fem & Asian\" at the grand finale, not only were we gagged by the spectacle of it all, but also by the subversive message in the song that felt so empowering.\n\n‚ÄúLucky‚Äù - Season 13 Finalists\n\nwww.youtube.com\n\n'Lucky‚Äô ft. Gottmik, Kandy Muse, Ros√©, & Symone! üçÄ RuPaul‚Äôs Drag Race\n\nWhile most Drag Race finalists perform Rumixes of existing RuPaul songs (not original tracks), the top four of season 13 actually got an original song to add their own verses and perform at the semifinals episode. As expected, Symone, Ros√©, Kandy Muse, and Gottmik did a phenomenal job with \"Lucky,\" which instantly makes you want to listen to it over and over and over again.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Giving Fashion‚Äù - Luxx Noir London\n\nwww.youtube.com\n\nLuxx Noir London Performs ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Giving Fashion‚Äù üë† | RuPaul‚Äôs Drag Race Season 15\n\nShe might not have gotten the chance to lip sync for the crown, but Luxx Noir London's finale song \"It's Giving Fashion\" was giving us everything! The supreme references queen also delivered a stellar performance. While we've seen and heard many songs on Drag Race about \"fashion,\" this is absolutely the best one of the bunch.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm That B*tch‚Äù - Season 12 Cast\n\nwww.youtube.com\n\nThe Queens Perform 'I'm That B*tch' During The Season 12 Premiere üíÖ RuPaul‚Äôs Drag Race\n\nHow can we explain the power, the impact, and the international implications of \"I'm That B*tch\" as the grand premiere song of season 12? This season had a split premiere, and episode one had none other than Nicki Minaj as the guest judge. Despite the pressures to deliver something great in front of Queen Minaj, it's safe to say that Brita, Nicky Doll, Widow Von'Du, Jackie Cox, Gigi Goode, Crystal Methyd, and Heidi N Closet turned \"I'm That B*tch\" into a fan-favorite Drag Race bop.\n\n‚ÄúI Don‚Äôt Like To Show Off‚Äù - Bob the Drag Queen\n\nwww.youtube.com\n\nRuPaul's Drag Race (Season 8 Finale) | Bob the Drag Queen's 'I Don't Like To Show Off' Performance\n\nAfter being accused of \"showboating\" throughout season eight, Bob the Drag Queen performed the hilarious track \"I Don't Like to Show Off\" at the grand finale. The sense of humor of the song, along with Bob's fierce dancing and lip syncing, turned this into a victory lap for a queen who was destined to become America's Next Drag Superstar.\n\n‚ÄúBreak Up (Bye Bye)‚Äù - Frock Destroyers\n\nwww.youtube.com\n\nRuPaul's Drag Race UK Series 1 Frock Destroyers \"Break Up Bye Bye\"\n\nThe OG girl-group challenge that had Drag Race UK viewers gagging came right in season one from Blu Hydrangea, Divina de Campo, and Baga Chipz. Together, they formed the girl group Frock Destroyers and gave us a funny and entertaining performance of an original song titled \"Break Up (Bye Bye).\" We love this so much!\n\n‚ÄúLegs‚Äù - Naomi Smalls\n\nwww.youtube.com\n\nRuPaul's Drag Race (Season 8 Finale) | Naomi Small's 'Legs' Performance | Logo\n\nFor anyone who ever said that Naomi Smalls was just a model and a great pair of legs, well, here came this fierce season eight finalist with an original song all about \"Legs.\" With that performance, Naomi not only celebrated her clear talents, but she also proved that she was so much more than what some fans were giving her credit for."
