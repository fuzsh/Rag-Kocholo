        "text": "Editor’s note: Throughout the summer, RED’s Denver After Dark series will look at fun nocturnal activities in and around the Mile High City.\n\nIn the past couple of decades, Denver’s LGBTQ+ and sex-positive communities have blossomed from the occasional underground bar to vibrant and inclusive spaces for all, including queer, trans and gender-nonconforming folks.\n\nDenver’s inclusive and thriving drag scene has even proudly produced a few superstars. Yvie Oddly, beloved seventh-season champion of “RuPaul’s Drag Race” and a former Theatre student at Metropolitan State University of Denver, and the show’s current winner, Denver native Willow Pill, both began performing drag at Tracks.\n\n“What makes the Denver drag scene so special, or at least at the time I was kind of coming up, is that there wasn’t a whole lot of structure or rules,” Pill told the List.\n\nIn honor of Pride Month, RED is highlighting the best venues for drag and burlesque performances, which are enjoyed by LGBTQ+ and straight people alike. See for yourself how far Denver has come.\n\nTracks\n\n3500 Walnut St.\n\nTracks is one of the oldest LGBTQ+ nightclubs in Denver and aims to be one of the best in the country. This massive dance hall includes multiple stages and rooms, each one hosting its own DJ, theme and dance floor, so there’s always something for everyone. Tracks has offered a safe space for members of the local LGBTQ+ scene to build community for more than 40 years. Located in one of the hottest nightlife spots in Denver, the River North Art District, Tracks hosts local, national and international LGBTQ+ events and performers on its stages. Every month, you’ll find recurring dance parties and drag shows, including regular “Their Parties” — safe and inclusive dance parties for the gender-nonconforming — and themed “Drag Nation” shows, spotlighting the biggest drag entertainers in Denver. Tracks is open late-night Wednesday through Saturday.\n\nThe Clocktower Cabaret\n\n1601 Arapahoe St.\n\nThis Denver standby has been a staple of the local drag-and-dance community since 2006. Tucked away beneath the historic Daniels & Fisher clocktower on the 16th Street Mall, this hidey-hole is a throwback to a bygone era, with an intimate showroom draped in rich velvet and bathed in dim mood lighting. The clocktower is best known for its themed burlesque shows and drag performances but also offers entertainment each weekend, including live music, sketch comedy, aerial acrobatics and stripteases. The iconic downtown cabaret has nearly completed a makeover under the direction of esteemed local artist Lonnie Hanzon, the original designer of the venue 16 years ago.\n\nHamburger Mary’s\n\n1336 E. 17th Ave.\n\nThough this national franchise didn’t originate in Denver, it certainly has made itself a home in the Mile High City. Hamburger Mary’s brings a quirky, comfortable and delicious take to the local drag scene. With all the familiarity of your favorite greasy-spoon diner, plus an unabashed love for all things fabulous and flamboyant, Hamburger Mary’s offers drag in a safe, casual and fun-focused environment. Stop in every week for “Dinner With a Side of Drag,” drag brunches, drag bingo and “So You Think You Can Drag” competitions. Hamburger Mary’s is open for good food and great entertainment afternoons and evenings Wednesday through Friday and all day Saturday and Sunday.\n\nRELATED: 25 years of Pride\n\nFive Nines\n\n233 Clayton St.\n\nNestled deep inside the Clayton Members Club & Hotel, Five Nines is the hottest new cocktail lounge in Cherry Creek. Sleek, sexy and dressed to the nines, this discreet little gem feels like something secret — but this lounge isn’t a speakeasy. The plush, velvety banquettes and moody, noir-inspired décor ooze class. Though you might come for the craft cocktails and posh bar bites, you’ll stay for the entertainment. Performers from local burlesque troupe Hard Candy Dancers take to an intimate ground-level stage for provocative mini-performances every 45 minutes that include aerial routines, pole dances and contortion. Five Nines is open evenings Wednesday through Saturday.\n\nX Bar\n\n629 E. Colfax Ave."
