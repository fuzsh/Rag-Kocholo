        "text": "As far as I could discover, prior to the 60s the term pop was practically non-existent as people were still listening and making songs that were more orchestral (like film scores), jazzy or straight up Vaudeville. There was Folk music, but anything could be considered as folk because any songs that were easy-listening and easy to be remembered by any generations could be considered as folk. Then, Rock blossomed and became the earliest usage of \"pop\" as a shortened call for \"popular\" music. By the end of the 60s, Disco found its way from Italy to America and the rest of the world. Not only that, musicians started to experiment with Jazz, Funk, and Country to make music that could be considered as \"pop\" as much as Disco music was. Japan even had a music genre called City Pop.\n\nThen, Madonna appeared and completely changed what pop music means. She revolutionized Disco to Dance, even when Donna Summer had made the first ever Techno song out of Disco long before Madonna. But after Madonna, Pop became more pronounced as a genre: Dance-Pop. Until you realize...it never stood alone. Madonna's Like a Prayer literally had a lot of R&B tones all throughout as well as her usual synth-based dance songs, not to mention the Prog. Rock elements that were more popular than Pop itself was outside the U.S.A.\n\nThen, Whitney Houston came along and changed it again. Pop literally became Adult Contemporary, which is quite confusing since it could mean anything. Even Barbra Streisand could mean Pop by using this definition. Whitney was a Soul singer who had R&B music, but somehow the public considered her to be a Pop artist a.k.a. white-pandering artist. We also witnessed the short prime of Cyndi Lauper, which included elements of Rock within her Synthpop music until she changed route and basically became a Folk singer.\n\nJanet Jackson who made R&B and Funk music, which stylistically originated from Prince's music, early in her career was also considered a Pop artist, so was Mariah Carey who made R&B and Soul music. Mariah's Music Box, her most Adult Contemporary album to date, even still maintained some R&B elements like doo wop arrangements and soulful singing a la Aretha Franklin rather than Janis Joplin. Many Rock and Country singers that blossomed throughout history have also been classified as Pop artists when they didn't fit the \"traditional characteristics\".\n\nToday, we listen to mainly Dance-pop songs and classify them as \"real pop music\" while dismissing songs that come from other genres as \"not pop at all\". We always seem to long for the comeback of Pop music; this forum I could say was built on the basis of Dance-pop artists which we happily call Pop Icons/Legends, while other artists/musicians have quite suffered because their music often considered less Pop a.k.a. less or not Mainstream. This mainly affects the Hip-Hop artists that don't necessarily rap. African-American/Black musicians who feel that they are making pop records have spoken about this. Their music often considered as Urban music just because they're black, while white artists seemingly easy to be categorized as Pop.\n\nSo, what is Pop? Is it a genre? Is it a sub-genre? Is it a movement? Is it an archaic form of art? Is it only about Dance? Let's talk about it.\n\nI definitely think it's more of a blanket term than an actual genre. The thing is, as you pointed out, the characteristics of pop music have changed overtime, because pop largely depends on what is popular at the time. \"Pop\" became more broadly defined after the rock n roll era. Before rock n roll, jazz and swing music was the standard popular music, as well as \"traditional pop\" which was a blend of jazz, swing, showtunes, Broadway, tin-pan-alley and such. \"Crooner\" Frank Sinatra type music. Rock n roll paved the way for more modern pop music which really began in the 1960s and the Beatles. They were really the architects of modern pop. \"Pop\" music today is much more simplistic than the \"pop\" music of the past which was all orchestra based. Also, I totally agree that Madonna's debut album totally changed the game and reinvented what we define as pop music. In particular the use of drum machines on the songs was kind of ahead of it's time. Disco relied on real drums as well as \"post-disco\". Now, there's almost no dance-pop song that doesn't use drum machines or sampled drums.\n\nAnother point I just thought of: alot of \"pop\" music is made for dancing. Waltzes were made for dancing, and jazz and swing is dance music, too. I think popular music more often times than not is dance-friendly and played in night clubs.\n\nOn 6/8/2020 at 3:39 AM, Cl!t said:\n\nSo what category would you put the faves in if Pop isn’t one? There are so many types I have heard of like Katy is bubblegum pop Gaga electronic dance pop etc..\n\nFOTP Faves? Ariana mostly makes lite R&B songs and dance songs. Beyoncé has always made R&B songs with occasional experiments of cross-genres. Both Britney and Xtina have made bubblegum pop which basically are dance songs but in a less club-y fashion. They also have experimented with their dance songs as well as created R&B songs, more pronounced in Xtina's career though.\n\nKaty has been described as a bubblegum pop artist but her pop songs are always rooted in rock mannerisms, while Kylie and Gaga are primarily dance-pop artists. I would say that Kylie has made some interesting R&B-in-disguise type of songs whereas Gaga has made A Star is Born soundtrack and Joanne which are more Americana/folk-based American music. She did also record her takes on some jazz music and traditional vocal pop songs with Cheek to Cheek.\n\nLana is a baroque pop/rock singer in the styles of Joni Mitchell and Linda Ronstadt combined with the dream pop aesthetics a.k.a. those baroque and chamber strings sounds. Madonna is a dance-pop artist who has experimented with a lot of sounds while still maintaining her primary dance music root. She also has made some very left-field moments such as jazz, soft rock, R&B, hip-hop soul, and folk-tronica.\n\nMariah always makes R&B songs but with variant shades for mainstream appeal. Her first two albums are comprised of R&B/soul songs with little rock and dance moments, while Music Box and Merry Christmas are adult contemporary music with few R&B elements still included in them. Daydream borrowed her first two records overall sound but still possessed that adult contemporary appeals, while Butterfly fully turned her into an R&B artist again with elements of hip-hop soul. This continued till now, even Glitter is still considered R&B despite its synth-pop based funky songs.\n\nRihanna is a dance artist who has experimented with rock, hip-hop, R&B and reggae. Taylor Swift is a country and pop-rock artist. Speak Now is filled with country and pop-rock music, so is Red. 1989 is also able to be considered as a prog. rock record with few exceptions, such as for Shake It Off which is a bubblegum pop/dance-pop song and Bad Blood which is essentially a hip-hop song. She has also made a lot of old school country songs with folk-y arrangement before and she has experimented with electronic music, which was still in the domain of dance music, for Reputation.\n\nWhoa, that was a lot .\n\n3 minutes ago, SeekingThrill said:\n\nBut it is. Sure, it often includes elements of other music genres, but the same can be said for other genres.\n\nBesides, just because there are some rock elements in a pop song, doesn't make the song rock if we try to ignore pop as a genre.\n\nEvery genre can be accessible or not, but for pop music it is almost always a rule.\n\nYou mentioned dance as a genre, but it isn't a genre. The opposite of that is a ballad. Although, there are dance genres like EDM, disco...\n\nHit Me Baby One More Time is pop in every way. It isn't rock, it isn't r'n'b, it isn't hip hop...\n\nThat’s all well and good but “pop music” is and always has been a general term that refers to music that exists outside of traditional styles and rock ‘n’ roll. What we recognize as pop music originated in the same place as rock ‘n’ roll: in the 50s and the 60s and has it’s origins in mostly the blues. At the time, the blues was a predominantly African American genre but white artists were finding interest in it. So in the 50s and 60s, white artists began to build careers off of covering old blues standards. Elvis, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones...their early work consisted of mostly covers of classic blues songs, but they weren’t straight covers they were adapted and changed around to have a more upbeat and easily digestible sound. That sound continued to build until in the mid 60s, there was a split between the softer sound and the harder sound. At the end of the 60s, the “flower power” era ended and from it emerged two dominant sounds: hard rock and what we now refer to as adult contemporary (which was representative of anything that wasn’t rock music). Through most of the 70s hard rock dominated but later in the decade, the Disco scene rose to cultural and commercial dominance. That led to the domination of softer music through the 80s and that’s where we began to make the distinction of calling something “pop music”. But the truth is that pop in and of itself has never been a specific genre, it’s been a general term for a certain style of music that catered to a mass audience. For awhile it was the blues, for awhile it was disco. Now it’s more referring to mainstream dance (which is a genre by the way), mainstream electronic, soft R&B (along the lines of Rihanna), and what remains of disco’s influence. We now see it and refer to it as a genre in general but the term itself isn’t technically a genre which is why we make distinctions within pop i.e. dance pop, hyper pop, alt pop, etc."
