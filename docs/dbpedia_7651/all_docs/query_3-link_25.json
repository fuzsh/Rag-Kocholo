        "text": "This introduction provides an account of the motivations – both personal and academic – which led me to decide to analyse the Electronic Dance Music (EDM) scene and the role of the audience in live performance. Bogdanovic and Longhurst state that “it is significant that, despite the importance of performance to music… it is only relatively recently that it has come under sustained academic scrutiny” (Bogdanovic & Longhurst, 2014: 190). Although EDM is a relatively new genre in the world of music, it has grown and evolved exponentially since its birth in the late 1970s and the establishment of its foundations throughout the 1980s, so much so that there are now innumerable subgenres and sub-subgenres within the sphere of EDM. The genre is subject to constant evolution and as such, there is always the need for updated analysis. Lofland (1971: 3) states the need for proximity to the culture under examination. The researcher should be “close in the physical sense… over some significant period of time and variety of circumstances”. I have personally been involved as an audience member at EDM concerts and performances for the last six or seven years now, and have often considered how drastically different the structure of live EDM performances are to traditional models of performer and audience. My hometown of Glasgow has a wonderful affiliation with live music, with an abundance of EDM clubs and globally-recognised institutions such as The Arches and Sub Club. I have spent many nights in these dark, sweaty and stifling clubs, and taken from them experiences and memories which will always live with me. Often, the music itself is secondary in these performances. The real performances come from the interactions between myself and other clubbers, peers and friends, and it is those memories that always stick out most vividly. The following paper will argue that it is those social relations which define the events more so than any other factor. This report was constructed as a piece of desk-based research, undertaking the methodology of theoretical analysis which involves selection and discussion of theoretical and descriptive material, and detailed comparison and reference to relevant theories. Chapter one is focussed on defining the concept of genre, before outlining the genre of EDM in the modern musical landscape, and with it all those subgenres and sub-subgenres which come under the umbrella term of EDM. Chapter two focusses on the concept of live musical performance, with detailed explanation of the research of Christopher Small and his theories of ‘musicking’ and the role of the audience, before outlining Walter Benjamin’s arguments of authenticity and ‘aura’ in media reproduction. Finally, chapter three applies these theories to the EDM genre, arguing for the importance of the audience and human interactions in live EDM performances. Constant reference is made in every chapter, and throughout the report, to the theories of Theodor Adorno and his work On Popular Music (1941). EDM definitely falls into the category of ‘popular music’ as outlined by Adorno, but rather than his theories being a hindrance like in many other aspects of popular music research, this paper argues for a celebration of the inherent standardisation of EDM.\n\nThis article offers detailed comment on the vibe of the exiles, a socio-sonic aesthetic infused with the sensibility of the exile, of compatriotism in expatriation, a characteristic of psychedelic electronica from Goatrance to psytrance and beyond (i.e. psyculture). The commentary focuses on an emancipatory artifice which sees participants in the psyculture continuum adopt the figure of the alien in transpersonal and utopian projects. Decaled with the cosmic liminality of space exploration, alien encounter and abduction repurposed from science fiction, psychedelic event-culture cultivates posthumanist pretentions resembling Afrofuturist sensibilities that are identified with, appropriated and reassembled by participants. Offering a range of examples, among them Israeli psychedelic artists bent on entering another world, the article explores the interface of psyculture and Afrofuturism. Sharing a theme central to cosmic jazz, funk, rock, dub, electro, hip-hop and techno, from the earliest productions, Israeli and otherwise, Goatrance, assumed an off-world trajectory, and a concomitant celebration of difference, a potent otherness signified by the alien encounter, where contact and abduction become driving narratives for increasingly popular social aesthetics. Exploring the different orbits from which mystics and ecstatics transmit visions of another world, the article, then, focuses on the sociosonic aesthetics of the dance floor, that orgiastic domain in which a multitude of “freedoms” are performed, mutant utopias propagated, and alien identities danced into being.\n\nConnecting three generations of music enthusiasts, Goa Gil is an imposing figure in the world of psychedelic trance. If the title of his 2007 compilation registers intent, he is a Worldbridger. Bristling with motifs of world sacred sites and appropriated \"tribal\" icons, with Gil seated cross-legged upon the apex of a Mayan temple, the album's cover artwork confabulates the physical, spiritual and cultural worlds he professes to bridge. Leading world-wide \"trance dance rituals\" Goa Gil operates under the guise of a \"techno-shaman\", a \"cyber-baba\" and a selector/mixer of traditions whose rituals are reputedly timeless and universal. But this intent is performed amid a highly mobile lifestyle spread across diverse psychedelic music cultures, scenes and sensibilities in discrete times and places. From the 1960s Haight-Ashbury psychedelic rock scene, to the psychedelic jam band scene on Anjuna beach, Goa, India, in the 1970s, to the adoption of electronic music in a DJ-led scene in the 1980s, to the birth of \"Goa trance\" in the 1990s, to his selection, production and performance of dark psychedelic trance in the 1990s/2000s onwards, DJ Goa Gil's life spans a breathtaking panorama of this-worldly psychedelic scenes. Gil is a freak bricoleur, an anomalous figure who evades modest circumscription. A Californian exile and sanctioned Shaivite practitioner with a professional hankering for darkpsy (as a DJ-producer), a hippie broker of the \"Cosmic Spirit\" and a post-apocalyptic punk, he is a spiritual authority and cultural outlaw touring the planet with an improbable mix of semiotic and sonic baggage. What's more, celebrated as a champion of the \"Goa vibe\" or derogated as an accomplice to its demise, Gil is a controversial figure who is the embodiment of considerable ambivalence. This article explores this holiest of anomalies in the world of DJing.\n\nIn this article, spirituality is explored within a post-human context through a case study of the contemporary post-industrial dancing body at post-rave dance clubs and parties characterised by DJ produced techno-house music. The mental state of this body is driven outside of daily perceived psychological boundaries by an amplified pulsating electronic rhythm, whereby such altered states of consciousness can be chemically enhanced by the use of dance drugs. As the dance floor ‘peaks’, in the words of its technician, the DJ, the dancing crowd can reach a transcendental moment perceived as a timeless forever now. For example, Sylvan notes in Traces of Spirit that: ‘The first theme that stands out as nearly universal in the dance floor experience of the rave subculture is that of trance’ (2002: 127). Such a state of trance, or peak experience, produces a subjective perception of spirituality that seems to exist outside of the boundaries of material reality. However, the discussion will show that experiences of spirituality are nevertheless produced within the embodied lived experience of specific material and cultural contexts. In this case, these contexts are provided by the gendered discursive field of global post-rave cultures and the politics of the music genre aesthetics of techno-house."
