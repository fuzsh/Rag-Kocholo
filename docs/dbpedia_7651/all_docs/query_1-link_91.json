        "text": "Hi there, treasures.\n\nWe are the queens from RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars.\n\nAnd we are about to take you through a brief history--\n\nof drag culture. Oh, fabulous.\n\n(upbeat techno music)\n\nMen have been dressing in what's considered\n\nwomen's clothes, and vice versa,\n\nfor probably as long as human beings\n\nhave been wearing clothes.\n\nBut where did the term 'drag' originate?\n\nThe term 'drag' was primarily used as a theater term\n\nto describe a man or woman who was dressed in clothing\n\ntypically worn by the opposite sex.\n\nBefore women were allowed to perform in theater,\n\nmen played females parts, cross-dressing in women's clothes.\n\nIt's thought that 'drag' was chosen\n\nbecause it describes the action\n\nof long skirts draggin' on the stage floor.\n\nDrag eventually made its way\n\ninto American vaudeville shows\n\nin the late 19th, early 20th centuries.\n\nIn 1911, Julian Eltinge, often referred to\n\nas the greatest female impersonator in theatrical history,\n\nwon critical acclaim for his cross-dressing role\n\nin the play The Fascinating Widow.\n\nWhen homosexuality was outlawed,\n\nmany decided it was safer to do\n\ntheir cross-dressing behind closed doors.\n\nBut when Prohibition rolled around,\n\nmen found plenty of underground places popping up\n\nout of the sight of the law where they could drink booze,\n\nbe openly homosexual, and, of course, dress in drag.\n\nThe rise of these underground gay bars\n\nwhere drag was commonplace\n\nwas then known as the Pansy Craze.\n\nYes! The Pansy Craze\n\ncontinued to grow until, in the 1950s and '60s,\n\nlaw enforcement cracked down on the members\n\nof the LGBT community, includin' us drag queens.\n\nThen, drag balls sprung into existence\n\nand became like mini-societies for drag queens everywhere.\n\nDrag queens could join up with local houses\n\nfor moral support and shelter\n\nif they'd been thrown out of their own homes.\n\nBy July 1966, there were an estimated 500\n\nopen and regularly performing drag queens\n\nin the United States.\n\nNow, somethin' tells me that number's probably bigger,\n\nbut you know, we don't be on too many registries.\n\nMother Flawless Sabrina, RIP,\n\nwas a leader for the transgender and gay communities\n\nand one of the first widely known drag queens\n\nin the United States.\n\nShe organized multiple drag queen pageants\n\nacross the United States, was arrested numerous times,\n\nand even appeared in drag on several talk shows,\n\nwhich was groundbreaking for the time.\n\nIn the 1950s and '60s,\n\ndrag queens began to protest unfair police treatment.\n\nThese efforts came to a head\n\nwith the famous Stonewall riots,\n\nwhich lasted six days and are believed to have begun\n\nthe modern gay rights movement in the United States.\n\nBarry Humphries, Dame Edna Everage,\n\nhousewife and superstar character,\n\nrose to fame first in the United Kingdom\n\nand then across the world. (crowd applauds)\n\nIn 1972, Indy filmmaker John Waters\n\nmade drag queen Divine the star of his film Pink Flamingos.\n\nAnd Divine, who is iconic,\n\nif you don't know her, you better look her up,\n\nshe soon became a counterculture icon.\n\nIn 1975, Tim Curry famously played\n\nDr. Frank-N-Furter in the cult movie classic\n\nThe Rocky Horror Picture Show.\n\nThe '80s gave rise to the trend\n\nof pop music stars dressing in full or semi-drag,\n\nincluding Philip Oakey, Pete Burns, and Boy George.\n\nIn 1985, the New York drag festival known as Wigstock\n\nwas founded by drag queen legend Lady Bunny,\n\nknown for her signature, insanely large, blonde wigs.\n\nIn 1988, Divine famously starred\n\nas Tracy's mother in the movie musical Hairspray.\n\nAnd to this day, it's been a tradition\n\nthat a male in drag plays that part.\n\n1980s drag ball culture is also where the phrase\n\n'yassssssss' or 'yasss queen' caught on\n\nand became more widely used outside the drag community.\n\nIn 1990, Jennie Livingston released\n\nher documentary Paris Is Burning,\n\nwhich offered an in-depth look\n\nof what it took to become a drag queen\n\nin Harlem's predominantly African-American\n\ndrag ball culture.\n\n(upbeat electronic music)\n\nThe '90s kicked off a new era of drag in pop culture.\n\nIt saw the rise of many drag queens\n\nin film, television, and theater,\n\nincluding Coco Peru, Hedda Lettuce,\n\nMiss Understood, Candis Cayne, and Joey Arias.\n\nRuPaul, the most famous and influential\n\ndrag queen in history,\n\nis largely credited for bringing drag\n\ninto mainstream popular culture.\n\nHis reign began in the 1990s\n\nwith his hit 1994 song Supermodel You Better Work.\n\nIn 1996, RuPaul got his own talk variety show on VH1,\n\nThe RuPaul Show, which ran for 100 episodes.\n\nRuPaul, the drag mother of all drag queens,\n\npaved the way for prominent drag\n\nin popular culture in the 2000s and beyond.\n\nHoney, if wasn't for RuPaul, I wouldn't be here.\n\nRuPaul's Drag Race, created in 2009,\n\nI was very young then, now gives a national platform\n\nfor up-and-coming drag queen performers everywhere\n\nto earn their spots as top influencers in the community.\n\nThe show has taken home numerous awards,\n\nincluding not one but two Primetime Emmy Awards\n\nfor outstanding host for reality\n\nor reality-competition program.\n\nHuh, how 'bout that?\n\nAnd that's why we are here right now.\n\nSee now, I hope you learned\n\na thing or two about drag culture.\n\nAnd now that you got all that knowledge in your noggins,\n\ngo forth and bring it into the world.\n\n(upbeat house music)"
