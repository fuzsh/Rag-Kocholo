        "text": "CHICAGO—Chicago Live! at Navy Pier will bring together the legends and top names of Chicago House music at this year’s festival, Sept. 21-22. Capping off the city’s summerlong celebration of the 40th anniversary of the genre, the two-day tribute will feature iconic Chicago House singers Dajae, Suzanne Palmer, Andrea Love, Shawn Christopher, and the first lady of disco, Linda Clifford, sharing the bill with pioneering DJs Ralphi Rosario, Derrick Carter, Psycho Bitch, Lady D, Ron Carroll, Michael Serafini and Ca$h Era.\n\n“These are the local names that revolutionized dance music globally,” said Erika Taylor, Navy Pier’s Vice President of Arts, Culture, and Engagement. “With Chicago Live! we strive to shine a spotlight on all facets of Chicago’s vibrant performing arts community – none of which has been more intrinsically linked to our city’s unique rhythm for the past four decades than Chicago House music.”\n\nAccording to Frederick Dunson, president and executive director of The Frankie Knuckles Foundation, a collaborating partner in the Chicago Live! tribute, “House music brings people together in ways few other mediums can. It’s meant to be felt. At Chicago Live!, we’ll have the best-of-the-best pumping up the music to help people feel it…in their hearts and souls.”\n\nThe largest free performing arts festival in the Midwest, this year’s fourth-annual Chicago Live! will welcome more than 100 Chicago-centric artists and performing groups in back-to-back performances across five Pier stages. The 40th Anniversary Tribute to Chicago House Music will take place on the Wave Wall Stage from 3 p.m. to 9 p.m. on Saturday, and 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. on Sunday. The current line-up includes:\n\nDJ Michael Serafini 3:00 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 21\n\nProprietor of legendary record store Gramaphone, Michael Serafini got his start in the ’80s as a video jockey and remixer at Berlin nightclub and Boom Boom Room, the city’s longest running house night. He’s currently in residence at Smart Bar, where he hosts the weekly, LGBT-oriented Queen! party along with Garret David and Derrick Carter.\n\nDajae 4:00 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 21\n\nChicago-born R&B and dance music singer Dajae established herself as a soul band vocalist before teaming with House music producer Cajmere, who featured her in his 1992 single “Brighter Days.” Peaking at number two for two weeks on the American dance chart, “Brighter Days” is among a powerhouse roster of Dajae’s hit singles that became dancefloor anthems, including “Time,” “U Got Me Up,” “Is It All Over My Face,” and “Day by Day.”\n\nDJ Psycho Bitch 4:30 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 21\n\nFor the past three decades, DJ Psycho Bitch has cultivated a homegrown fanbase in Chicago, garnering acclaim for her relentless DJ sets. She cut her chops at legendary mixed/alternative venues like Medusa’s, learning from master spinners like Mark Stephens, before developing inclusive gay nights at spaces like Crobar with longtime collaborator, the late Teri Bristol.\n\nLinda Clifford 5:30 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 21\n\nLinda Clifford has made her mark among the classic R&B singers and legendary disco divas. Her landmark recordings have spent a total of 60 weeks at #1 on Billboard Magazine’s dance charts. As a live performer, she has sold out concerts at the world’s top venues, including New York City’s Lincoln Center. Her hit single, “Red Light,” appeared on the multi-million selling, Oscar-winning movie soundtrack album Fame.\n\nDJ Ralphi Rosario 6:00 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 21\n\nDJ, music producer, Grammy nominee, and LGBT Hall of Fame honoree, Ralphi Rosario began his career in 1981 as the youngest member of Hot Mix 5, one of the leading forces in early Chicago House music. A sought-after music producer and remixer, he still works his magic for such mega recording artists as Lady Gaga, Ariana Grande, Billy Porter, Rihanna, Katy Perry, Mariah Carey, Madonna, Ricky Martin, and Beyoncé.\n\nAndrea Love 7:00 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 21\n\nAn undeniable musical force, Andrea Love is best known as a featured artist on dozens of European House and Dance music hits, including “Shined On Me” with the Praise Cats. Boasting a five-octave range and a unique vocal profile influenced by gospel, jazz, soul, and funk, Love has performed alongside various legendary artists including Chaka Khan. She has just released her newest track in collaboration with Ralphi Rosario.\n\nDJ Lady D 7:30 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 21\n\n“Chicago’s House Music Queen” Lady D has played internationally as well as in Chicago’s major nightclubs for the better part of two decades. A prominent representative of Black women in electronic music, she was featured alongside Chaka Khan, Nile Rodgers, and other music superstars in a 2016 book and 2023 PBS American Experience documentary exploring the cultural significance of the infamous Disco Demolition.\n\nDJ Derrick Carter 2:00 p.m. Sunday, Sept. 22\n\nA pioneer of the reemergence of Chicago House music in the ’90s, Derrick Carter’s undeniable passion and talent for House music is evident in his impressive catalogue. After graduating from college in 1987, he released his debut single, “Love Me Right,” followed by several singles and an album under the pseudonym “Sound Patrol.” Carter currently runs his own label, Blue Cucaracha.\n\nShawn Christopher 3:00 p.m. Sunday, Sept. 22\n\nStarting her career as a touring backup vocalist for Chaka Khan in 1982, Shawn Christopher has been a staple in the Chicago House music scene for more than four decades. Still wowing crowds with her powerhouse vocals, Christopher’s Chicago Live! appearance will coincide with the release of her latest music, while paying homage to her chart-topping anthems, including “Another Sleepless Night,” “French Kiss,” “Don’t Lose the Magic,” and “Sweet Freedom.”\n\nDJ Ron Carroll 3:30 p.m. Sunday, Sept. 22\n\nNicknamed “The Minister of Sound,” Chicago native Ron Carroll has earned a following on the international House music circuit as a DJ, singer, songwriter, and producer. His prolific discography spans two-and-a-half decades, including collaborations with E-Smooth, Maurice Joshua, Bob Sinclar, and other of House music’s most famous producers.\n\nSuzanne Palmer 4:30 p.m. Sunday, Sept. 22\n\nSuzanne Palmer’s 2021 recording of “Hide U” with producer/DJ Peter Rauhofer for Rauhofer’s Star 69 label was a meteoric success, quickly breaking into the Billboard Club Play chart’s top 5. The daughter of a jazz pianist on Chicago’s South side, Palmer attracted the attention of Earth, Wind & Fire’s Maurice White, who signed the then-teenager to a solo recording project after hearing her winning performance on the nationally televised Show Time at the Apollo. Equally at home singing R&B, gospel, House, pop, jazz, or cabaret, Palmer’s live performances are always in-demand, electrifying audiences at major venues and festivals throughout the world.\n\nDJ Ca$h Era 5:00 p.m. Sunday, Sept. 22\n\nCaSera Heining, best known as DJ Ca$h Era, is a resident DJ for Chicago’s hottest venues including Broken Shaker, Scarlet Bar, The Promontory, and Soho House, among others. Winning the title of Chicago’s Best Hip-Hop DJ since 2021 from the Chicago Reader, she has performed at Lollapalooza, My House Music Festival, and Pitchfork, and opened for well-known artists including G Herbo, CeeLo Green, Project Pat, Taylor Bennett, Jamila Woods, and Ghostface Killah.\n\nNavy Pier announced last month that Wilco front man Jeff Tweedy will headline this September’s Chicago Live! festival. Featured artists will range from Chicago’s world-class stalwarts, including The Joffrey Ballet, Hubbard Street Dance Chicago, Second City, Chicago Shakespeare Theater, Chicago Philharmonic, Black Ensemble Theater, and the perennially popular Blue Man Group, to pop culture icons like Ginger Minj from RuPaul’s Drag Race, Tony-nominated Felicia Fields, The Voice’s Oliv Blu, and many exciting up-and-comers. More than 50,000 Chicago-area residents and out-of-town guests are expected to take in free Chicago Live! performances over the course of the two-day festival.\n\nSupported by the Pritzker Foundation and Peoples Gas, Chicago Live! was launched in 2021, following the pandemic, to reconnect audiences with Chicago’s performing arts community after a devastating 18-month closure that left many in the industry in limbo. Exclusively showcasing Chicago-based artists, the festival has grown from 43 performing companies in its inaugural year to 111 groups and individual artists on-deck to appear at this September’s event."
