        "text": "Nineteen area venues played host to 157 total teams who showed up for Pour House Trivia on Thursday. Coincidentally enough, nineteen of those teams packed Aslin Beer Co for the game there!\n\nFIRST ROUND:\n\nAs a bit of irony, the game began with the easiest wagering question and the hardest bonus question of the night. While almost every team correctly named singer Adele from the question, only 12 teams knew her last name of Adkins for two big bonus points. We followed with a trip to the children’s book department:\n\nThe title characters in this children’s book were not given individual names in the original story. Instead, author Maurice Sendak created names for a 1980s operatic adaptation of which book?\n\nA little less than three-quarters of the field knew that book is Where the Wild Things Are. The round concluded with a trip to France and a three-parter on current TV character trios. Speaking of trios, perfect scores in the first were attained by Washington Foreskins (Loudoun Kitchen), Pearl Onions (Aslin), and Redneck Yacht Club (Preston’s).\n\nSECOND ROUND:\n\nWe spelled it out for Thursday’s players in the audio question with the songs Respect (Aretha Franklin), R.O.C.K. in the U.S.A. (John Mellencamp), and Hollaback Girl (Gwen Stefani). After that, teams had questions about the Roomba vacuum cleaner, NFL Hall of Famer Jim Brown, and the words latte and Platte which you’d think would rhyme. Round two wrapped up with the most difficult wagering question of the first half:\n\nIn yet another action film role that has been panned by critics, which Star Wars actor portrays an aging hitman in the current film Memory?\n\nMany teams focused on the original trilogy, but that actor is Qui-Gon Jinn himself, Liam Neeson. Wagering points were taken by 44% of teams, with a majority of them tacking on two bonus points by identifying his only Oscar nomination as the title character in Schindler’s List. Fourteen teams achieved perfect scores in the round.\n\nHALFTIME:\n\nFor the halftime page, the tasks were to name zombie films by their screenshots and five-letter song titles by a short description. Teams averaged 14.8 points out of 20, and eight teams scored the maximum 20 on the page. As teams prepared for the second half, this was the top of the leaderboard:\n\nWashington Foreskins (Loudoun Kitchen): 89\n\nPower Vacuum (Champion): 89\n\nThe Gang Plays Bar Trivia (Olde Mother): 88\n\nTeachers Have Class (Solace Brewing): 88\n\nYOLO Swaggins (Crooked Run): 88\n\nTHIRD ROUND:\n\nA Three Clues question on the South American country of Ecuador proved to be the toughest bonus chance of the third round; just under a quarter of the field only needed two clues to name it for bonus points. Topics like the Exxon Valdez oil spill of 1989 and top-listed Fortune 500 companies Walmart, Amazon, and Apple preceded the most difficult wagering question of the game:\n\nWhich man became the youngest player to ever be elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1972, at the age of 36? This pitcher had to retire in 1966 due to complications from arthritis, despite winning three Cy Young Awards in the last four years of his career.\n\nA game-low 37.5% of teams knew that man to be Dodger great Sandy Koufax. One more third-round question concerned the video game and Netflix series The Witcher and its lead actor Henry Cavill. A group of seven teams on Thursday got all 36 points in the round.\n\nFOURTH ROUND:\n\nThe evening’s 6-4-2 question took more than just one clue for a vast majority of teams, but two groups earned their six points by naming Canada from just one clue regarding its gold-medal futility as Olympic host country in 1976. An opening question on the alloy brass was the bonus toughie here, with 21% of teams knowing the alloy is made up of both copper and zinc for two more points. We hit the drop on the next question:\n\nFeaturing syncopated drum patterns with bass lines that contain sub-bass frequencies, which subgenre of electronic dance music can be associated with artists such as Skrillex and Knife Party?\n\nThis was the hardest wagering question of the round, but 65% of teams knew that EDM subgenre is dubstep. The round ended after topics like photographer Ansel Adams and Ferris Bueller‘s post-credits signoff to film audiences. Eleven teams boosted their fortunes with perfect fourth rounds. These were the top-scoring teams before the final question:\n\nPower Vacuum (Champion): 163\n\nThe Gang Plays Bar Trivia (Olde Mother): 162\n\nWhat About Dave? (Mark’s): 161\n\nCat in the Chat (Loudoun Kitchen): 160\n\nYOLO Swaggins (Crooked Run): 160\n\nJust Good Enough (O’s Nest): 160\n\nFINAL QUESTION (24.2% success rate):\n\nThe two most populous cities in this U.S. state have respectively lent their names to a Tony-winning musical and an Oscar-winning film. Name that state that lies in both the Central and Eastern Time Zones.\n\nAlmost one-fourth of Thursday’s field got their final wager by correctly answering Tennessee; the musical is Memphis and the film is Nashville. Two teams capped off a Perfect 21 with correct final answers: Power Vacuum (Champion) and Purr and the Kitty Cats (Solace Outpost) answered every wagering question correctly in the game. Thursday’s game came to a close with these teams riding high on the scoreboard:\n\nThe Gang Plays Bar Trivia (Olde Mother): 171\n\nFamily Ties (Aslin): 171\n\nAlcoholics Unanimous (Olde Mother): 170\n\nCat in the Chat (Loudoun Kitchen): 170\n\nWashington Foreskins (Loudoun Kitchen): 169\n\nTeachers Have Class (Solace Brewing): 167\n\nEducated Friends (Fourscore): 167\n\nThe Owls Are Not What They Seem (Mark’s): 166\n\nPower Vacuum (Champion): 166\n\nFIVE TEAMS TIED WITH 165 POINTS\n\nTHURSDAY’S WINNERS:\n\nSmoketown Brewing Station in Brunswick, MD: Second Half Sarcasm (NEXT WEEK’S FIRST CATEGORY: Justin Wilson)\n\nPour Dog House in Millersville, MD: Running on Empty (NEXT WEEK’S FIRST CATEGORY: Pokemon)\n\nChampion Billiards in Frederick, MD: Power Vacuum (NEXT WEEK’S FIRST CATEGORY: Our Flag Means Death)\n\nLoudoun Kitchen and Bar in Leesburg, VA: Cat in the Chat (NEXT WEEK’S FIRST CATEGORY: Dylan O’Brien)\n\nOlde Mother Brewing in Frederick, MD: The Gang Plays Bar Trivia (NEXT WEEK’S FIRST CATEGORY: Czech Beer)\n\nBelly Love Brewing in Purcellville, VA: Hillbilly Geniuses (NEXT WEEK’S FIRST CATEGORY: Code 8 — film)\n\nSolace Brewing in Sterling, VA: Teachers Have Class (NEXT WEEK’S FIRST CATEGORY: RuPaul’s Drag Race)\n\nBad Habits Bar & Grill in Martinsburg, WV: Jones Springs Hooligans (NEXT WEEK’S FIRST CATEGORY: Top Gun)\n\nBrewery Fire in Taneytown, MD: Hokies (NEXT WEEK’S FIRST CATEGORY: Brat Pack)\n\nFourscore Beer Co. in Gettysburg, PA: Educated Friends (NEXT WEEK’S FIRST CATEGORY: TV Theme Songs — audio)\n\nCrooked Run in Sterling, VA: YOLO Swaggins (NEXT WEEK’S FIRST CATEGORY: Willow — film)\n\nSolace Outpost in Falls Church, VA: Purr and the Kitty Cats (NEXT WEEK’S FIRST CATEGORY: They Might Be Giants)\n\nHomaide Brewing in Williamsport, MD: Here for the Beer (NEXT WEEK’S FIRST CATEGORY: Triple 50/50: Van Halen Songs — Roth or Hagar?)\n\nBear Brick Oven Pizza in Silver Spring, MD: Flux Capacitors(NEXT WEEK’S FIRST CATEGORY: Olympic Skiers)\n\nPreston’s Pubin Manassas Park, VA: Pew Pew Pew (NEXT WEEK’S FIRST CATEGORY: Harry Potter)\n\nCasita Romos in Mount Airy, MD: NO GAME (NEXT WEEK’S FIRST CATEGORY: Motown)\n\nQuinn’s in Arlington, VA: NO GAME (NEXT WEEK’S FIRST CATEGORY: Harry Potter)\n\nAslin Beer Co in Alexandria, VA: Family Ties (NEXT WEEK’S FIRST CATEGORY: Heisman Trophy Winners)\n\nKalypso’s Sports Tavern in Reston, VA: Here For the Beer (NEXT WEEK’S FIRST CATEGORY: Units of Measurement)"
