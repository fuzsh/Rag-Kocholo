Along the way, they'll detour into how every single one of 'Play''s 18 tracks were licensed out to film, TV, and commercials -- some of them multiple times -- and how Moby gradually ascended to the top of the fin de siecle electronica heap, finding himself a lonely, whiny -- and possibly stingy -- king.
