        "text": "This may be an odd takeaway from such a grim release, but Garbage gives hope to other veteran bands with its new “No Gods No Masters.”\n\nMore than a quarter century after forming, the rocktronica quartet is neither chasing after music fads nor stubbornly sticking to the stale sound from its early days. Instead, Garbage is making vibrant music for the 2020s.\n\nIt helps that the band got the chemistry right from the get-go: The group’s lineup has remained unchanged from the start – three innovative producers (Duke Erikson, Steve Marker and Butch Vig) who have crafted a signature style out of rock fundamentals and electronic foundations plus firebrand singer Shirley Manson, whose distinctly powerful voice conveys the lyrics with punk cynicism and rage tempered by vulnerability.\n\nWorking again with longtime co-producer Billy Bush, Garbage finds specific targets on “No Gods No Masters” for its sometimes-broad anger. The track “The Men Who Rule the World” is a call to action supported by the restless fidget and rumble of sound (“destroy the violator”), the industrial agitation of “Godhead” is a roiling foundation for Manson’s bluster against patriarchy, and the methodical meditation of “Waiting for God” underscores bloody injustice: “smiling at fireworks that light all our skies up while Black boys get shot in the back.”\n\nElsewhere on “No Gods No Masters,” Mason rolls out her trademark charisma, copping to her insecurities alongside the chunky beat and waves of synths on “Uncomfortably Me,” embracing responsibility for her own destiny in the careening shimmer of the title track and channeling Liz Phair in the defiance of “Flipping the Bird.”\n\nPlus, on the straightforward “Wolves,” Manson admits her role as an antagonist and adds a wry apology: “No one can say that I didn’t love you.” &mldr; And in turn, that winking nonchalance is what makes fans love her back.\n\nGarbage\n\n\"No Gods No Masters\"\n\nRating: 4 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nBo Burnham is hilariously sobering\n\nOn his new Netflix special and related music/comedy release “Inside,” Bo Burnham talks and sings about dropping out of public five years ago and staying gone till now. He addresses his panic attacks and depression, paints the future (his own and the world’s) as doomed, questions the audacity of comedians for thinking they serve value to humanity during bleak times, feels guilt that privileged white men such as himself should feel entitled to, or even crave, the spotlight and warns of the grim effects of social media-fueled narcissism and distraction on society.\n\nIt’s hilarious.\n\nBurnham takes the inherent sadness and outrage of this existential drama – produced during a pandemic, no less – and grinds it through the 20 songs of “Inside” by using his uncanny wit and savvy observation.\n\nThe music is mostly an offbeat combination of theater and 1980s synth-pop/Goth. Somehow it fits.\n\nHighlights include a “White Woman’s Instagram” that skewers the way shallow personalities are camouflaged by artificial joy on social media (a phenomenon not limited to white women), from a “coffee table made out of driftwood” to “some random quote from ‘Lord of the Rings’ incorrectly attributed to Martin Luther King.” Also, “Problematic” spirals out of control in the futile energy of accepting endless accountability in a world with an ever-shifting moral compass – “I feel I must address the lyrics from the previous verse,” a fretful Burnham apologizes mid-song, “My actions are my own, I won’t explain them away.” Then there’s the eerie campfire folk song “That Funny Feeling” with its talk of disassociation and decentralization and an iffy future.\n\nBut “Welcome to the Internet” is the showcase of “Inside” as Burnham reels through rapid-fire subjects (from legit to absurd and from cute to disturbing) that keep us online: “Could I interest you in everything all of the time?”\n\nUltimately, “Inside” is layered, complex, incisive &mldr; and vastly entertaining.\n\nBo Burnham\n\n\"Inside\"\n\nRating: 4-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nMax Jury charms with 'Shade'\n\nMax Jury’s alluring new “The Shade and the Grass” might be the well-crafted introduction to the well-mannered singer-songwriter that could in turn inspire an audience to want to hang out longer with the Des Moines, Iowa, native.\n\nJury is a bit of a stylistic pop/folk throwback to the 1970s &mldr; so much so that the EP’s opening track, “Leaving Song,” echoes the often-covered Loggins & Messina classic “Danny’s Song,” which is 50 years old this year (about twice the age of Jury). However, under “Leaving Song’s” classic melodies and gentle acoustic strains, Jury’s raspy voice conveys a bleakness tied to his optimism: “Faded jeans and overcoats/Soon the rain will turn to snow/It’s hard to face the world alone/Give it a try, give it a try &mldr;”\n\nStill waters run deep throughout this EP, which includes an “Orange City Blues” where the rocking-chair cadence of guitar and Western-flavored nuance lead to a bridge of la-la-las and the sobering conclusion: “I don’t want to fight, I just don’t want to hurt.”\n\nIn contrast, Jury projects a sunnier disposition in the fanciful tones of the lulling “Highway Song,” though even that come with a disclaimer: “Love’s the sweetest thing around, but it won’t last too long if I don’t get it right.” At least he reiterates his aim with, “Human kindness, that’s what I want.”\n\n“The Shade and the Grass” also features Jury’s collaboration with English singer-songwriter Fenne Lilly on an engaging cover of P.J. Harvey’s “Desperate Kingdom of Love,” the new version a comparatively lush reinvention of the stark original.\n\nOverall, this release is humble in tone and length, yet it’s subtly mesmerizing.\n\nMax Jury\n\n\"The Shade and the Grass\"\n\nRating: 4 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nAmbar Lucid will get you lost\n\nGen Z upstart Ambar Lucid shows flashes of millennial icons ranging from Lady Gaga to Selena Gomez on her new EP “Get Lost in the Music,” but the 20-year-old doesn’t sound like she’s aiming for their mainstream success.\n\nInstead, Lucid’s world is a trippy place with tarot cards, drug-influenced reflection and metaphysics. Add to that the retro elements conjured in this genre-nonconforming EP and you can practically smell the incense burning.\n\nThe Dominican-Mexican American singer from New Jersey sets the table with first track “Space Cowgirl,” an aptly titled folkie ballad that sounds like a protracted intro as she sings about “traveling through space and time like a true space cowgirl” and wondering, “How do I stop myself from floating away too far?”\n\nFortunately, Lucid never floats away too far.\n\nInstead, she immerses herself in the unhurried trip-hop/R&B Spanish-language “Un Animal (Divina Existencia)” and escorting the Latin kick of the title track into a 1970s funk/rock throwback, listening to the magic mushrooms in her soul and concluding, “What’s the point of living if you’re already dead?”\n\nAlso, there’s a soothing, albeit quirky, roll to the pensive “Lizard,” where she gently withdraws into herself and shuts down outside interference, explaining, “I’ve been smokin’ just a little too much/But it’s all OK, ’cuz it has me thinkin’.”\n\nLucid’s allure comes from the mystique of showing just enough to prove she’s deeper than an ordinary vocalist, but also holding back, teasing at more. As she sings in the gutsy, if slightly restrained, discordant closer “The Door,” “I’m just tryin’ to get your attention.”\n\nWell, she got it.\n\nAmbar Lucid\n\n\"Get Lost in the Music\"\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nRodrigo earns her license to seethe\n\nDespite the bitter and mournful tone of most of Olivia Rodrigo’s new debut album, “Sour,” she’s having a great year. In January her breakout single “Drivers License” debuted at No. 1, where it stayed for a couple of months, and now “Sour” proves the 18-year-old Disney actress is likely to be active in music for years to come.\n\nDan Nigro produced the album with intriguing eclecticism and hit-friendly arrangements, laying the groundwork for the robust-voiced Rodrigo to focus on the resentment and heartbreak of being the dumped partner in a breakup.\n\nAlthough the golden-hooked “Drivers License” captures the exquisite pain of realizing “forever” in a relationship really just means “for as long as it seems like a good idea,” other downcast songs on “Sour” are almost as powerfully defeatist. For example, the guitar ballad “Enough for You” finds her confessing, “All I ever wanted was to be enough for you,” and “Favorite Crime” finds her defiantly taking a share of the blame for his abuse of her.\n\nOn the flipside, the angry Rodrigo is a force of nature – beyond the piercing jabs dished out by her hero Taylor Swift and into the fury of the Alanis Morissette rager “You Oughta Know.” Rodrigo’s spite is magnetic on “Déjà Vu” as she calls out her ex for recycling his old moves on his new girlfriend (Rodrigo even takes credit for teaching him his best trick), and she issues a warning on “Traitor”: “Don’t’ you dare forget about the way you betrayed me.”\n\nAlthough Rodrigo is obsessed with the ill-fated relationship on “Sour,” she opens the album with “Brutal,” a dynamic blast of punkish pop where the self-aware singer embraces a flurry of awkward thoughts endemic to teens: “They say these are the golden years, but I wish I could disappear.”\n\nThe hurt of “Sour’s” bad relationship won’t last forever, and Rodrigo seems braced for whatever comes next.\n\nOlivia Rodrigo\n\n\"Sour\"\n\nRating: 4 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\n'Soberish' Liz Phair is still bold\n\nMusic fashion may have passed her by, but Liz Phair remains a pioneer in the industry thanks to her plainspoken (blunt) indie releases from the 1990s that set the prototype for individualistic young artists.\n\nPhair’s “Soberish,” her first new album in more than a decade, is a surprisingly close cousin, stylistically, to 1993’s “Exile in Guyville” and 1994’s “Whip-Smart,” and she’s as seemingly straightforward now, at 54, as she was in her 20s – though her head’s in a different space these days.\n\nDissatisfaction, bad luck/judgment and flashes of optimism permeate the lo-fi setting as Phair embodies a woman struggling to cope with the mental chaos of separation/divorce (on “Spanish Doors”), the disorienting effects of a reliably unreliable partner (on “The Game”) and the helplessness of being tethered to a social pariah (on “Hey Lou,” where she sings, “We’re losing all of our friends/Pretty soon it’s gonna be just you and me across the table”).\n\nOn the flipside, Phair is determinedly upbeat by greeting a breakup up with a shrug and a smile on “Good Side,” she’s giddy (if tentative) about a romance on a “Ba Ba Ba” punctuated by escalating drums, and she battles self-destructive tendencies to enjoy infatuation on the title track.\n\nAnd wherever the mood takes her, it always feels visceral and real.\n\nHowever, apart from a few touches like the subtle hook of “In There” and the slinky arrangement of the insinuating “Soul Sucker,” the songs here are sonically underwhelming, and Phair’s vocal delivery is limited. In the past her emotional depth and provocative attitudes elevated her shortcomings into gritty chic, yet that doesn’t feel like adequate compensation in the hyper-stimulated 2020s.\n\nStill, Phair’s relentless relatability is as alive as ever.\n\nLiz Phair\n\n\"Soberish\"\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nLang's 'Makeover' is a 'freshen up'\n\nThe unconventional glam look that k.d. lang sports on the cover of her new “Makeover” album is pointedly symbolic for what’s inside: Things may appear different on the surface, but the fundamentals haven’t changed.\n\n“Makeover” features remixes of lang singles from about 20 to 30 years ago. The vocals are essentially the same, yet the new arrangements vary from a little tweaked to moderately overhauled.\n\nThe remixes aren’t shocking – if anything, they’re rather standard as remixes go – but lang’s vocals remain dramatically clean and worth revisiting, plus longtime fans will appreciate the new contexts (as fans tend to do) and the electronic reworkings will win over new followers.\n\nOther than a beefed-up revamp of “Miss Chatelaine” and a dark-humming spin on lang’s version of “Theme From the Valley of the Dolls,” the other six songs on “Makeover” are offered in two versions. For example, “Sexuality” is first featured with more rhythmic bump than on the original (on a “Tony Maserati Final Radio Remix”) and later with a rumbling rendition that de-emphasizes the vocals (a “DJ Krush Full Mix”). Likewise, “Just Keep Me Moving” is presented with an emphasis on atmosphere over vocals (on a “Movin’ Mix”) and then in an earthier version (on “Wild Planet Mix”).\n\n“Makeover” also includes an anesthetized spin (“Club Xanax Mix”) on the jazzy original of “Lifted By Love,” and “If I Were You” is presented with a weightier, more methodical arrangement (“Close to the Groove Edit”). And the release ends with some of the longest new versions strung together to create a mini-EDM party.\n\nWhat’s “new” about “Makeover” isn’t innovative, but nevertheless it’s good to hear these songs freshened up and compiled like this.\n\nk.d. lang\n\n'Makeover'\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nSo Zuppy is surprisingly sweet\n\nSo Zuppy’s “Blindly, Pt. 2” is a quintessential indie release.\n\nLate in 2020, the Milwaukee-based experimental act, aka Micah Foust, told alternative media outlet Shepherd Express that his then-new “Blindly, Pt. 1” was inspired by a real-life break-up but also that he had since moved on to a new relationship and would release an appropriate follow-up. And thus here’s “Blindly, Pt. 2,” a five-song EP about love that sounds like the painfully introverted guy at the party suddenly taking center stage and singing quirky, but sweet, ditties. Or maybe he’s the eccentric folk singer in a surreal coffeehouse.\n\nFoust uses homemade instruments, found sounds and a demure voice to deliver strangely effective sentiments in a context that feels a little like children’s music and a little like an adult carnival, and the songs are all to the point and brief.\n\nIn the humming blur of soft opener “Eachother,” Foust sings of how “It’s beautiful the way we unwind” and about “Telling stories to my doggie” (that doggie has a response, by the way). With the support of acoustic guitar and peculiar percussion on “Familiar Smile” he wonders “What’s the nomenclature for the way that our hearts communicate?” and adds, “When you notice me, I see the joy that it brings.”\n\n\"Blindly, Pt. 2” rolls on through the lullaby-like electro-for-kids “Fool’s Gold” and the uncertain reverberations of “Running” before it slides into the dreamy notions of buzzing closing cut “Silverline” and lines like “Tell me what the stars look like in your eye. &mldr;”\n\nThe release is steadfastly unconventional, and each of the slight songs are just a couple of thoughts or observations, not whole concepts. But they’ll make you feel something in the moment before that fade away.\n\nSo Zuppy\n\n\"Blindly, Pt. 2\"\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nUnion of Knives returns with impact\n\nJust go for it.\n\nThat seems to have been the motto for Union of Knives when the Glasgow-based band was making the propulsive new electronic/rock/dance album “Endless from the Start.”\n\nThe release is the group’s first since its 2006 debut, “Violence and Birdsong,” though the act’s members have all been busy in other projects in the interim. And Union of Knives comes at its audience full tilt, engaging its artillery of electronics, rhythms and vocals to such an extent that the churning stomp-and-saunter of the beat-frenzied “Like Butterflies” feels like a relative ballad in the mix.\n\nThe brews sometimes take a minute to reach a boil: Opening cut “There’s a River” originally relies on a heavy vibrating current until a dramatic upheaval results in a stormy sonic sea; the electricity of “Whispering on the Curves” ultimately generates an ethereal glow for the refrain “Have you never wanted more?”; and the purposeful sprawl of final track “Close” is a display of escalating entrancement.\n\nFrontman Chris Gordon shares vocal duties with Anthony Thomas as the two men plus Peter Kelly create soundscapes from the beatdown “Something in Your Rhythm” to the comforting hypnosis of “Minneapolis.” Ladytron’s Helen Marnie provides additional diversity, singing lead on the undulating circus of “A Tall Tale” and the phantasmagorific dance song “A Little Life.”\n\nHowever, no track eclipses the impact of the epic “A Moth That Found a Flame,” a layered showcase with NIN-like emotional aggression, Bono-like plaintive singing and multiple incendiary climaxes.\n\nFrom start to finish, “Endless from the Start” is full of life\n\nUnion of Knives\n\n\"Endless From the Start\"\n\nRating: 4-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nDiGirolamo's 'Paper Boats' holds water\n\nNashville-based session player James DiGirolamo has played in the studio and on the road with a busload of artists, and another busload of disparate performers come into play as influences on his new “Paper Boats,” all of which explains the EP’s dramatic sonic shifts.\n\nHappily, the adaptable DiGirolamo makes it all work: Despite the track-to-track differences, he never seems out of place on “Paper Boats,” and in the EP’s short time he even manages to carve out a well-rounded performance character for himself.\n\nHe’s a gentle artist, well-spoken through his lyrics and soft-spoken in his vocals.\n\nLeadoff track “Same Boat” is a call for togetherness, comfortable old-school adult pop anchored to an electronic hum that finds him singing, “If we’re gonna be in the same boat/Let’s start rowin’/If we’re gonna get where we’re goin’, we’ve gotta learn to row together.” He subsequently eases into the subtleties of the ’70s-style piano ballad “The Girl Who Has Everything,” complete with a Burt Bacharach-ish horn arrangement.\n\nElsewhere, listeners might hear echoes of early Paul Simon in the folkie “Sail Away,” find themselves mesmerized by DiGirolamo’s crooner turn on “Pure Joy” (“Now that I’m with you &mldr; life is pure joy”) and enchanted by the banjo-flavored Americana lilt of “Top of the World,” where he sweetly sings, “I love you, hold no one above you in the whole wide world.”\n\nAnd to avoid being pigeonholed as too sugary, DiGirolamo smartly shifts into a darker tone on the melancholy closer “On Paper,” where he wistfully sings, “On paper, everything was right.” (Spoiler alert: It wasn’t right.)\n\nAll told, “Paper Boats” is smooth sailing into the spotlight for DiGirolamo.\n\nJames DiGirolamo\n\n\"Paper Boats\"\n\nRating: 4 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nBoone is back in Rehab with 'Danny'\n\nAtlanta act Rehab emerged in 2000 with “Southern Discomfort,” which still ranks as one of the best rock/rap hybrid releases popular music has seen.\n\n“Southern Discomfort” champions the underdog with a collection of smart and wry lyrics conveyed by soulful singing and focused raps as searing guitars and rocking beats drive addictive hooks.\n\nFounder and frontman Danny Boone was Rehab’s focal point, a sad sack who was hard on his luck and a little self-destructive, but an amply sympathetic old soul with a lived-in voice.\n\nOver the years Rehab delivered a disarmingly moving single in “It Don’t Matter” as well as the hilarious revenge-themed 2008 underground hit, “Bartender Song (Sittin’ at a Bar).”\n\nAs fate would have it, Rehab fizzled over the years and disbanded in 2014.\n\nBut as destiny would have it, Rehab is now reborn as a solo Boone project with “Danny Boone EP 2.”\n\nBoone is finally the age he always seemed to be, a middle-age man who’s both weary and wary, though he hasn’t given up on the world despite being knocked around more than his share.\n\nHis wailing soul is as effective as ever on the new release’s opening cut, “Bazooka Tubes,” and his self-effacing humor is intact, as evidenced in the woozy strains of “So Dope” that echoes shades of “Rump Shaker” as Boone proclaims “I’m dope! &mldr; I mean dopamine, ‘dope’.” Our hero is also open about being forced to survive on his own in the hypnotic wobble of “No Rebuttal,” and in the bass-heavy closer “Kill the Static” he waves off critics with, “Lotta rappers really don’t have a murderous purpose, believe it or not.”\n\nWith any luck these four new songs are just an appetizer for something more filling.\n\nRehab\n\n\"Danny Boone EP 2\"\n\nRating: 4 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nGrace Aimi's 'Picnic' is a random buffet\n\nEPs – shorter releases than LPs, but longer than a single song - have become powerful tools in an industry once built on full-length albums. EPs are quicker and less expensive to make, plus artists don’t have to create as much material &mldr; and frankly, even some of the best albums in popular music have had their share of filler tracks.\n\nEstablished artists record an EP to explore a theme, knock out a series of related EPs or create an EP to promote a tour. Meanwhile, new artists can quickly introduce themselves by way of EP, and with less effort than an LP.\n\nBut just as short stories and short films generally can’t establish the depth of a novel or full-length movie, an EP is limited – especially a hodgepodge collection like the new “Picnic” from Gen Z upstart Grace Aimi.\n\nAimi proves herself a bold vocalist with “Picnic,” starting with strumming opener “Eternal Sunshine,” where cartoonish effects ricochet around while the singer simmers in lines like, “I don’t need nothing but you in this moment” and the Bill Withers-inspired, “Ain’t no sunshine when you go.”\n\nThe EP then zigs and zags, from the polite, bloopy-electronic pep and quirky fluff of “Open” to the growling/purring cold shoulder of the dancehall “Friend Zone,” where she declares, “You can take me out to eat, but you can never take me home.”\n\nAfter just a few tracks, Aimi is already mired in disconnected songs, chugging off the rails like a slow, wobbly train in the melancholy “Rainbow” and pounding through the off kilter, but wry, “My Eyes.”\n\nClosing track “True Feelings” is just as incongruent, though more satisfying, as Aimi channels a soulful cocktail-lounge chanteuse, gliding alongside sweet guitar and piano to sing of the pain in her eyes.\n\nUltimately, “Picnic” is like spending random moments with a stranger that raise more questions than they answer. You think you might want more, but you aren’t convinced.\n\nGrace Aimi\n\n\"Picnic\"\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nWeezer reinvents heavy metal glory\n\nIt would have been a mistake to take 1980s heavy metal too seriously back in the day, and it would likewise be a mistake to take Weezer’s tribute to the genre, “Van Weezer,” too seriously today.\n\nIt would also be a mistake not to appreciate it.\n\nThe release of “Van Weezer” was postponed a year because of the pandemic, but we can finally enjoy it in all its bombastic silliness – and not just for the retro, searing electricity, but also for the melodic choruses more typical of Weezer frontman Rivers Cuomo than that of a rank and file metal band.\n\nFor that matter, opening track “Hero” is as instantaneously infectious as most every heavy metal hit thanks to its bracing guitars and disarmingly complex perspective: “I tried to be a hero, but I was lying to myself,” sings Cuomo, adding, “I walk alone.”\n\nRemnants of 80s bands (and older) – from Metallica to Motley Crue to (of course) Van Halen – blow through the mixes of “Van Weezer,” be it in the crushing groove of the infatuation-based “All the Good Ones,” the blustering rock-opera stylings of “The Beginning of the End” or the chugging locomotive grind of “1 More Hit.”\n\nCuomo isn’t one to yelp and scream – plus he digs deeper on the lyrics than two- or three-word hooks – and “Van Weezer” is all the better for it, whether Cuomo is anchoring into the careening “Blue Dream” to wallow in rejection or finding purpose in opening a jar of peanut butter for his sweetheart on the charming “She Needs Me.”\n\nUltimately, as Weezer’s nostalgia-inspired projects go, “Van Weezer” serves a satisfying feast of empty calories.\n\n1980s metal didn’t change the world, yet it made it a better place to live. And the same goes for “Van Weezer.”\n\nDon’t read too much into it.\n\nWeezer\n\n\"Van Weezer\"\n\nRating: 4 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nBala cracks through hard-rock 'Maleza'\n\nSpanish duo Bala doesn’t go on any wild diversions with its new “Maleza,” but the act keeps the ball rolling for the album’s 24-minute span.\n\nIt’s a blistering ride through a grimey storm of electricity that blurs the atmosphere with distorted sonics and edgy narration by Anxela Baltar (guitar) and Violeta Mosquera (drums), who deliver vocals in Spanish and English.\n\nThe women rage through dense arrangements that channel punk and stoner rock, respectively, as the cadence swings from careening to molten. There’s an overriding grunge atmosphere, too – and sure, Generation X Americans are likely to hear echoes of early Hole.\n\nYet “Maleza” transcends predecessors and eras to deliver a raw hybrid of doom and liberation, a dream within a nightmare or a nightmare within a dream, be it in the near-out-of-control, yet impressively harmonized, vocals of “Hoy No” or the gorgeous wrath of the full-grip chokehold “Mi Orden.”\n\nFrom the shout-along refrain that erupts out of the aggressively primal chaos of the high-voltage “Cien Obstaculos” to the relentless heart-pounding beat that counter-punches the odd melodicism of “Una Selva” to the danceable rhythmic allure that tethers the bulldozing grinder “Rituais,” Balta and Mosquera balance their songs with contradictions.\n\nSo, when the track “Quieres Entrar” starts with an eerily calm introduction, don’t be surprised when the most unhinged vocals on the album rudely interrupt.\n\nBala may not have invented anything new here, but they’re keeping alt-rock alive.\n\nBala\n\n\"Maleza\"\n\nRating: 4 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nKid-friendly 'Slow Clap' earns applause\n\nListeners will be confused if they take a spin through Koo Koo Kanga Roo’s new “Slow Clap” without knowing anything about the Minnesota duo.\n\nThe release is categorized as comedy, though it’s a music album rather than standup, and it’s more weird than laugh-out-loud funny. Meanwhile, the duo, who simply go by the first names Bryan and Neil, are rappers – but more representative of old-school, wide-eyed rap with wholesome lyrics (think: the theme song of “The Fresh Prince of Bel Air”) than anything new you’d hear in the 2020s.\n\nAlso, “Slow Clap” is labeled as “kid friendly,” which is Koo Koo Kanga Roo’s clever way of saying it’s an album for kids that adults will also enjoy rather than merely tolerate.\n\nIndeed, it could serve as good music for a summer party, hokey and clean with dance-able rhythms. Producer Lazerbeak gives the guys a solid foundation for their silly themes, be it electronic tinged for the frenetic “Ice Cold Lemonade” (which celebrates “the official beverage of sunshine”), a slinky “Sneakin’ Downstairs” about slipping away for a midnight glass of milk (“I’m in the mood to moo”) or a funky-lite “Pranks a Lot.”\n\nThe inane release also merrily bounces through playfully manic cuts like the percussion-heavy “Forklift” and squid-starring “Ink,” yet adults may feel stuck in a quicksand of hokum elsewhere, as in the addled “Putt Putt Butt Butt,” in the slumping reverberations of “Backyard Swimsuit” and in the grainy snoozer “Lazy Life.”\n\n“Slow Clap” certainly offers more sustained all-ages excitement than many children’s albums, yet some of these songs are strictly kids’ stuff.\n\nKoo Koo Kanga Roo\n\n\"Slow Clap\"\n\nRating: 3 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nSlenderbodies ties to yacht-rock sound\n\n“Yacht rock” was just “rock” in its time, and it was a dominant force on the charts and airwaves in the 1970s and ’80s. It never really died, but rock got harder, pop got crisper and the mainstream rise of other genres like country and hip-hop eventually diminished its impact.\n\nYet the nostalgia for yacht rock, aka soft rock, has been strong in the past few years, and elements of the style continue to find their way into new music.\n\nFor instance, Slenderbodies – the Los Angeles duo of Max Vehuni and Benji Cormack – build on a foundation of soft-rock basics like gentle vocals and hooks, freeing grooves and a romantic atmosphere for the new “Are We?” They also deviate from the formula to enrich the sound with layers of light jazz and folk plus persistent electro touches that create a meditative, New Age ambience.\n\nThe net result is a consistently intoxicating escape featuring Vehuni’s falsetto vocals and charming subtleties.\n\n“Are We?” ingratiates with the breathy singing and stirring cadence of the fluid “Lime Ocean,” the warmly inviting “Favorable Colours” and the truncated rhythm of “Mirror.”\n\nElsewhere, the track “Heartbeat” billows with urgency, “Summer Lost” is guided by a near-subliminal pulse, and the lulling cadences of highlight tracks “Superpowerful” and “Easier” are suitable music for dancing and drinks at an upscale cocktail lounge.\n\nAs with original yacht rock, there’s a hokey vibe to “Are We?” that calls for a suspension of adherence to the gritty realities of life. But the smooth music here is all the motivation listeners will need to set themselves free.\n\nSlenderbodies\n\n\"Are We?\"\n\nRating: 4 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nSt. Vincent's home doesn't feel homey\n\nIt’s OK if you don’t get St. Vincent.\n\nThe performer also known as Annie Clark doesn’t seem all that interested in being mainstream accessible. She’s a bold artist inspired by strokes of genius, yet she always brings something a little extra to the mix that feels off.\n\nThe well-versed provocateur, accompanied by producer Jack Antonoff (known for his work with Taylor Swift, but don’t read too much into that), spins through the early 1970s on her new “Daddy’s Home,” crushing an eclectic soul/funk woe-is-me flashback on “Pay Your Way in Pain” and taking the post-hook-up walk of shame in the languid psychedelia of “Down and Out Downtown.”\n\nThere’s a trippy air through most of “Daddy’s Home,” enhanced by prominent sitar. Clark is unhurried in the intoxicating allure of “Live in the Dream,” surreal in the steel-girded woozy memories of “The Laughing Man” (“We were kids, best of friends &mldr; Half pipes and Playstations/Suicidal ideation”). And “My Baby Wants a Baby,” Clark’s addled interpolation of Sheena Easton’s chirpy “Morning Train,” is a wry subversion of Easton’s idealism.\n\nAlso, “&mldr; At the Holiday Party,” supported by a percussive groove, is a poignant recognition that materialism can’t mask emptiness, “Candy Darling” is an endearing eulogy to the trans actress and muse, and “The Melting of the Sun” recognizes fearless women artists from Nina Simone to Joni Mitchell.\n\nApart from the enervating drain of the alt-jazz title track and the uncomfortable glitchy energy of “Down,” “Daddy’s Home” is aurally welcoming, even if Clark projects an unempathetic vibe.\n\nListeners may feel like they’re unwelcome guests at an insider party, but it’s worth crashing – though if you can’t get by her chilly eccentricities, don’t sweat it. She doesn’t care.\n\nSt. Vincent\n\n\"Daddy's Home\"\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nTrixie Mattel is the full package\n\nMost contestants on the reality show “RuPaul’s Drag Race” get an automatic career boost just by being on the show, and they can ride out their heightened profile by performing at bigger venues for higher prices than before their time on TV. Many also make appearances at fan conventions and land endorsements deals and modeling gigs.\n\nMany also record music – singles, EPs and albums – despite the fact most have singing skills that are average at best. But with the right studio work and a built-in fan base, there’s always a chance at a modest novelty hit, right?\n\nThen there’s Trixie Mattel, a two-time contestant on “Drag Race” (including a winning run on the third season of “RuPaul’s Drag Race: All-Stars” in 2018). Beyond doing drag, the well-rounded performer is a legitimate comedian, actor, talk-show host/podcaster and musician/singer.\n\nYet the new EP “Full Coverage Vol. 1” demonstrates Trixie Mattel could be a full-time singer without any of those other talents.\n\nThe vocalist doesn’t attempt to feminize his voice for the satisfying opening cut, a cover of Lana Del Rey’s “Video Games,” lending an earthy sincerity to the air (compared to Del Rey’s mystique) while dealing out lines like, “I’m in his favorite sundress &mldr; watching me get undressed” and “I hear you like the bad girls – honey, is that true?”\n\nThe EP also includes a soft, folk-pop spin on Cher’s “Believe” as well as a buzzing/freewheeling take on “Blister in the Sun” by fellow Milwaukee natives, Violent Femmes.\n\nYet the most natural fit of all for Mattel is the duet with alt-country singer Orville Peck on the Johnny Cash/June Carter classic “Jackson,” a full-bodied rendition with all of the lively sass of the original.\n\nWhen you can sing like this, you don’t need to lip synch for your life.\n\nTrixie Mattel\n\n\"Full Coverage, Vol. 1\"\n\nRating: 4 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nTeen rapper disarms with maturity\n\nSome listeners will flinch when they initially hear potential breakout rapper Melvoni’s “Get Money,” the first song on his EP “Return to Sender.”\n\nThe 17-year-old Brooklyn artist and his two guest rappers on the song – DDG and Tyla Yaweh – tempt cancel culture with misogynistic language and objectification of women plus a DDG assertion that it’s gay to want friends. Is this OK in 2021? Will they get a pass because the track is intended to be a tribute to hedonism?\n\nQuestions aside, the song’s message is emphasized by Melvoni’s blunt checklist of all the joys that money can bring, a playful realization most people have, even if the language here is objectionable.\n\nMeanwhile, it’s worth pointing out that other tracks on “Return to Sender” show Melvoni to be remarkably sensitive.\n\nBacked by acoustic guitar on the textured “Million Dollar Peasant” he earnestly offers reassurance to a young ally while confessing his own vulnerabilities: “If I tell you I got you, I got you. &mldr; You don’t got to ask me no questions.” And on “Call” he shows affection and kindness to a woman who has been wronged by a heartless man: “Save your love for someone else &mldr; You don’t deserve this,” adding, “If you ever need a shoulder, just give me a call.”\n\nBoth cuts feel disarmingly sincere, and Melvoni’s vocals are nuanced beyond the delivery of performers twice his age. Plus on closer “Blaze of Glory” his layered lines are overdubbed into rich harmonies in the chorus as he declares his self-reliance, not with theatrical overconfidence, but with convincing poise.\n\nSure, the gist of “Get Money” might be tacky celebration of sex and weed with over-the-line lyrics. But “Return to Sender” proves Melvoni to otherwise be a mature and multi-dimensional performer.\n\nMelvoni\n\n\"Return to Sender\"\n\nRating: 4 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nMoon shines with kindness\n\nMoon will rattle your cage and give you a hug with the powerful new “Shine.”\n\nThe Los Angeles-based duo of Chelsea Dawn (vocals, drums) and Dan Silver (guitars, synthesizers) brings the firepower of Dawn’s classic raw vocals (she echoes the likes of Janis Joplin and Adele), Silver’s high-voltage electric guitars and an array of songs tied to stomp-and-clap styled rhythms that put an exclamation point on every hook.\n\nAt the same time, Silver’s electronic touches accessorize the arrangements with a bit of mannered appeal that, when combined with Dawn’s soulful and improbably kind lyrical bents, lend a near-spiritual atmosphere to Moon’s concoctions.\n\nAs a result, the rattling wake-up call of “Shine’s” title track steers its grain and grit into lyrics like, “If we can find the time, we can make it right.” And closer “My Oh My (I’ll Take You Home)” is a tough-but-caring show of support from Dawn, whose voice is an unwavering beacon in the grip of escalating rock paralysis. “You dug your grave this time, you don’t even know,” she sings, motivating her listener to crawl out of the pits by offering follow-up lines like, “I’ll take you home or wherever you need to go ...”\n\nDawn does have a dangerous side, which she teases at in the bluesy warnings of the grandiose “Never Cross Me” (“I’ve got my finger on the trigger,” she warns). She also shifts into a curious hybrid of surrealism and earthiness on the evocative “Down By the Water,” and she uses an uncharacteristically reserved vocal delivery to underscore confidence on “Sweetest Magic”: “There comes a day you will know you’re mine.”\n\nUltimately, the refreshing release feels both modern and classic, which isn’t an easy tone to accomplish.\n\nMoon\n\n\"Shine\"\n\nRating: 4 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nScottish producer tests waters with 'IV'\n\nYoung Scottish DJ/producer Sam Gellaitry offers an aural resume of sorts with the new EP “IV,” a four-song show of diversity in advance of his upcoming full-length debut.\n\nGellaitry has had his hand in many subgenres of electronic music, and those influences surface on “IV” in the form of a hybrid genre that imagines a 1970s/1980s world where dubstep and trap music have already been born, intermingling with peak-era disco and early New Wave. And the result feels alternately retro and dated.\n\nHe also flexes four different moods for the four-track “IV,” so the songs stand apart in tone but stand together to give a multi-dimensional portrait of the artist.\n\nThe EP opens on the upswing with “A New Dawn,” Gellaitry boosted by awakening awareness and exhilarated lines like, “I can feel a new beginning” as the vocals are swarmed by a garden of sound effects that are generally untethered apart from periodic blasts of bass.\n\nThe old-school-synth-powered “Duo” follows with a trippy fusion of R&B and French house music, a radio-friendly plucky/funky pop confection that finds Gellaitry at odds with the friends of a new sweetheart: “Why are your friends paranoid? &mldr; Just because they think you can do better?”\n\n“Games” takes a darker lyrical tone that complements the hazy wobble of the arrangement, Gellaitry sounding like an adrift version of The Weekend against an earthy foundation. On the flipside, he’s practically giddy as he straddles the manic bassline and dodges the icy sonic spears of the disco homage “Assumptions,” which closes the EP.\n\nOverall, “IV” isn’t consistently great – it’s shrill at times and sometimes sounds anachronistic – but it displays flashes of Gellaitry’s creative vision and builds an appetite for more of his work.\n\nSam Gellaitry\n\n\"IV\"\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)"
