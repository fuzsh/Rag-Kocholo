        "text": "German DJ and producer (born 1975)\n\nNot to be confused with Mark Schultz or Markus Schulze.\n\nMusical artist\n\nMarkus Schulz ( SHUULTS, German: [ˈmaʁkʊs ˈʃʊlts]; born 3 February 1975) is a German DJ and record producer based in Miami, Florida. Best known for his weekly radio show titled Global DJ Broadcast that airs on Digitally Imported radio, ah.fm and other online stations,[2] Schulz is also the founder of the label Coldharbour Recordings[3] and Schulz Music Group (SMG), an artist management company that manages rising stars in the industry.[4] In September 2012, Schulz was crowned America's number one DJ by DJ Times.[5]\n\nIn early 2013, after several spontaneous back-to-back performances, Schulz and Ferry Corsten announced they would be producing and touring together as the new EDM group New World Punx. Their debut arena show was held at Madison Square Garden.\n\nProductions\n\n[edit]\n\nSchulz has released 15 mix compilations and seven artist albums under his own name. He has also released productions and albums, Thoughts Become Things, Thoughts Become Things II and The Nine Skies, under the alias Dakota.[citation needed] Through his work with remixing tracks, he has had the opportunity to work with such artists as: Depeche Mode, Madonna, Everything but the Girl, Jewel, OceanLab, Gabriel & Dresden, Télépopmusik, Fatboy Slim, Miro, Book of Love, Blue Amazon and PQM.[2] His remixes of \"Intuition\" and \"Stand\" by Jewel both hit #1 on the Billboard club chart.[6]\n\nHis seventh studio album, We Are The Light, released on 12 October 2018.[7]\n\nPerformances\n\n[edit]\n\nWhen not in the studio working on new mixes, Schulz maintains an extensive international touring schedule. He originally held a seven-year residency at The Works in Scottsdale, Arizona, where he developed his style. Since then, he has continued to perform at clubs all over the world including stereo nightclub Avalon, Club Space, Green Valley, Ministry of Sound,[8] Ruby Skye and Zouk.\n\nHe has performed DJ sets at some of the largest festivals and events: Electric Daisy Carnival; Electric Zoo; Monster Massive; Together As One; Ultra Music Festival; Amsterdam Dance Event; Nature One; Dance Valley; Love Parade; Global Gathering; Creamfields; ETD Pop; Transmission; Trance Energy 2010; Bang Music Festival; Future Music Festival; Bal en Blanc;[2] on Episodes 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, 600 and 650 (as New World Punx) of A State of Trance; and at Summafieldayze on the Gold Coast, Australia. In 2013, Schulz launched a North American tour with the M Machine called Scream Tour.[9] A second North American tour started in April 2014 following the release of Scream 2.[10]\n\nOn 28 October 2010, DJ Magazine announced the results of their annual Top 100 DJ Poll, placing Schulz at number 8 in the world.[11] In September 2012, Schulz was crowned America's Number 1 DJ by DJ Times.[5] In DJ Magazine's 2013 poll, he was number 21 in the ranking.[12]\n\nSchulz is known amongst his fans as the \"Unicorn Slayer\". Many EDM artists nowadays tend to fall back on light, upbeat melodies, nicknamed \"unicorn melodies\", but Schulz prefers to use square waves and pitch bends. After somebody tweeted, \"Markus Schulz: the unicorn slayer of trance,\" Schulz retweeted it and the nickname caught on.[13]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter a relationship of more than seven years, Schulz married Romanian singer Adina Butar on 1 June 2019, in Ibiza.[14]\n\nMarkus married his first wife Heather in 1993. They had a son Alex in 1995. Markus and Heather were divorced in 2015.\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nStudio albums (as Markus Schulz)\n\n[edit]\n\nWithout You Near (2005, Armada Music)[15]\n\nProgression (2007, Armada Music)\n\nDo You Dream?
