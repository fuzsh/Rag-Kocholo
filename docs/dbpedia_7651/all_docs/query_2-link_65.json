        "text": "The Big Idea: P.H. Low\n\nThere is the myth of being forever young — but what about the forever that comes after that? P.H. Low has given this some thought in These Deathless Shores, and in this Big Idea, is here to speculate about what comes after, and what it means for those who live it.\n\nP.H. LOW:\n\nOur culture is obsessed with childhood. The romantic ideal of it, anyway—as this innocent, pure, magical state that’s a tragedy to lose. You hear it in the wails of book banners (think of the children!); see it in intense skincare routines and workout regimens and TikTok wars where millennials are burned for looking (gasp!) older than twenty.\n\nAnd it’s everywhere in fiction — at least the books I read growing up, which pitted downtrodden but plucky kids and teens against adults who were, if not dead parents or outright villains, then dull bureaucrats, cruel teachers, or neglectful guardians, too cowardly or stodgy or just disappointing to be heroes — or even fully people. As J. M. Barrie, the original creator of Peter Pan, learned when his older brother David died in a skating accident at age thirteen — when little James dressed in David’s clothes to comfort their depressed mother, despite his own inevitable growing-up, year by year — to die as a child is to stay perfect forever. To become an adult is to stop deserving love.\n\nBut what happens when your childhood falls short of the ideal — especially, as Cathy Park Hong writes about in Minor Feelings, if you’re queer and/or BIPOC and/or have a disability,* and your youth is refracted through the lens of an idyll you’re told you should have but never receive? What happens when you age straight from victimhood into villainy?\n\nDo you deserve magic at all? Do you even deserve your own narrative?**\n\nThese Deathless Shores, my genderbent Captain Hook origin story,raises the stakes of these questions to the level of lethality. Here, when the Lost Boys grow up, Peter “thins them out” (a real quote from the original); the Boys are thus terrified of crossing that fateful line, lest they get their throats sliced — or worse, are exiled and forced to go to school in the real world.\n\nThese Deathless Shores opens on two of these Boys having aged into unfortunate adulthood: Jordan runs drugs and fights in an underground ring to appease a landlord-cum-handler who might turn on her at any time; Baron— nearly crushed by the pressure to get through college, find a job, and make enough to, at the end of sixty years, “at least afford a hospital bed to die on” (dress to depress, as they say) — walks the edge of suicidal ideation.\n\nIt was important to me that I could write this book for adults, as well as kids who’ve been forced to take on similar burdens. To evoke that visceral urgency of scrounging for rent and healthcare; of the free fall that gapes behind you if you miss a step. My background is in YA, which also often treats survival and self-sufficiency as a primary concern. But for this book, I found myself shaping my plot and characterization around a fundamental loneliness I experienced more acutely after I hit eighteen: that I can no longer fall asleep in the backseat as someone I trust drives us to our destination; that if there’s nothing in my fridge but a half-loaf of bread, no one will remind me, no one will ask.\n\nI also grappled with how my characters might struggle against the idea of growing up without the significant presence of parents to push against in-scene. Fortunately, at least for my plot, the grown-up world already permeates so many aspects of Peter’s supposedly child-centric idyll: Peter pretending to be a father, for example, or the way girls are (so Innocently! Naively!) treated as mothers — as passive things to be protected, and mindless doers of chores.\n\nAnother challenge for me was writing toward resolution — an ending that looked forward instead of just nailing the coffin shut; that pointed toward what things could be instead of only what they are.*** Because the worship of childhood — again, the cherub-faced ideal rather than the messy, screaming, political reality — is so deeply ingrained in the fabric of our stories, both the ones we consume and the ones we tell ourselves. Because when I was six or seven, accidentally unfolding my mother’s shorts in the closet instead of mine, I was already so imbued with the poison that I dreaded the day I would fit into them.\n\nBecause amid the slow exhausting scrabble for car insurance and rent money, the question pressed in: do I deserve a story, if the only thing I am is fighting to survive? What ending could I write for Jordan and Baron that felt both satisfying and true, when I’d dropped them in a pit I hadn’t crawled out of myself? To slightly misquote Sofia Samatar’s The Winged Histories, how can our stories remember without leaving a scar — how can they forget without “destruction, burial, loss” ?\n\nI don’t think These Deathless Shores provides a perfect answer — in fact, I hope it doesn’t, because an ending too neatly wrapped in a bow would feel untrue — but there might be a seed of one in the relationships that form over the course of the story. Jordan and Baron, Chay and Tier — romantic and platonic bonds, chosen slapdash out of convenience or forged over long, hard years. It’s in the ways they come to see and save each other; to say, in the end, that even if you’ve grown old — even if childhood is a locked door you can never reopen — maybe there’s still a story you can belong to; maybe there’s a chance you still deserve to be loved.\n\n*My addition.\n\n**Given the recent discourse on the aging up of YA, I would like to add that it’s urgent and necessary to have novels centering children and teens, stories that help them name the ways adults have failed them, and the shapes of their own desires. But for that to be the only narrative—for eighteen to be framed as the end—seems like its own kind of tragedy.\n\n***Shoutout to Hadestown — love us some myth-rooted capitalism commentary.\n\nThese Deathless Shores: Amazon (US)|Barnes & Noble|Bookshop| Powell’s|Blackwells|Waterstones\n\nAuthor socials: Website|Instagram|Twitter/X\n\nRead an excerpt.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nA Reminder About Things Allegedly in Development\n\nOccasionally, things of mine are optioned for film or television, and they are either announced in the trades or information about them is posted on IMDb or IMDb Pro. This will occasionally prompt people to ping me about the possibility of getting hired onto the things presumably in development. So this is a good time to remind people of a couple of things:\n\n1. The information on IMDb or IMDb Pro about things in development is sometimes substantially off (for example, the current IMDb Pro listing for Old Man’s War features a screenwriter who has not been associated with the project for more than a decade), so you should take that information with a grain of salt. Moreover, “development” is not “production,” and most of the general casting/staffing decisions are not going to be made in the development stage of things.\n\n2. Even if the IMDb information were correct, I am never the person to send head shots/show reels/sample scripts to, since I am not going to be the person who is going to make the casting or staffing decisions. I am out here in Ohio writing novels, not in LA. I am indeed often some flavor of producer on these projects (usually an executive producer, sometimes a different kind), but that still doesn’t mean I am making casting/staffing decisions.\n\n3. Furthermore, even if I were substantively involved in casting/staffing, there’s a process through which all casting/staffing happens, which does not involve some variation of cold calling me. There are actual departments those run through, and showrunners (which I am not) who make the call about whom to hire. Hitting me up is a waste of time, as I am not going to respond or do anything with the information you’ve sent, except delete it. Please wait for casting/staffing announcements and then apply that way.\n\n4. Finally, even if I were the person who made the final call on casting/staffing, i.e., the showrunner, I would still run it through the traditional channels of casting and staffing, because those are designed to get the most options on the table in the most efficient manner. So again, going through the known channels is the best way to do things.\n\nI realize this is not what people want to hear, but look: I don’t want you to waste your time, sending information to someone who can’t and won’t do anything with it, i.e., me. You deserve better!\n\n— JS\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nMichael and Lynne Thomas on Uncanny Magazine’s Year 11 Kickstarter\n\nAs many of you know, for the last year I’ve been writing a column on SF/F film for Uncanny Magazine, and it’s been a fabulous experience (for me, anyway). Now Uncanny is running a Kickstarter to fund their eleventh year of publication, with new writers and stories and essays (and art!), and I’ve invited editors Michael and Lynne Thomas to come chat about their goals for the year with the magazine, and why they hope you’ll consider contributing to the Kickstarter.\n\nMichael and Lynne Thomas:\n\nFirst, the happy news: Uncanny Magazine just launched its new Kickstarter, Uncanny Magazine Year 11: This One Goes to ELEVEN! We’re working on funding our 11th year!\n\nNow, the less happy news.\n\nA decade ago, Publishers/Editors-in-Chief Lynne M. Thomas and Michael Damian Thomas launched Uncanny Magazine, an online science fiction and fantasy magazine that features passionate SF/F fiction and poetry, gorgeous prose, provocative nonfiction, and a deep investment in diverse and inclusive SF/F culture—a magazine that believes there’s still plenty of room in the genre for tales that make you feel.\n\nThe year 2014 was in the middle of a beautiful era filled with vast, promising internet resources that made launching such a magazine possible. Magazine eBooks were rising in popularity, mostly thanks to a Large Online Retailer selling popular eReaders and providing easy-to-use periodical eBook subscriptions. (Many magazines built their business models around this funding source.) New community funding models like Kickstarter and Patreon appeared, making it possible to directly fund magazines like ours and keep the content free on our website. Crowdfunding dreams blossomed as robust social networks like Twitter and Facebook informed readers about awesome content and ways to make things happen financially.\n\nThe internet was people, talking to one another!\n\nTen years later, everything is crashing down around us. We went from an internet of abundance to one of scarcity; from hanging out in Avatar’s Pandora to something that feels much more like we’re starring in a Mad Max film. As Cory Doctorow put it, enshittification took hold.\n\nPlatforms and communication options went from gathering as people to their well-maintained platforms to extracting gobs of money from those folks—locking them into poorly working, difficult-to-escape platform ecosystems. They tweaked and automated algorithms to force paid-for visibility over everything, decimating the naturally popular organic messaging. The Large Online Retailer turned on its content creators. And finally, many tech companies unleashed the boondoggle of “Artificial Intelligence.”\n\nThe Enshittification Robots started taking over.\n\nUncanny is locked in battles with the following Enshittification Robots:\n\nThe Breakdown-of-Social-Media Robot\n\nLet’s be honest, Uncanny wouldn’t exist without Twitter’s existence a decade ago. Twitter’s reach and ease of use meant promotion there worked. Awesome stories, essays, interviews, and podcasts could reach outside the initial SF/F bubble, finding more readersin widespread communities. Librarians, writers, fans, and casual readers talked to one another about stuff that interested them! And those folks went to other platforms like Facebook or Instagram or Reddit and shared things they found and enjoyed on Twitter. Or it flowed the other way! A wonderfully organic ecosystem. People functioned as though there was plenty of story hangout space on the internet to go around. We shared. And shared. And shared. (Though we must acknowledge toxicity was always an issue.)\n\nRiding the wave of that enthusiasm, the magazines using social media encouraged folks to pay for that content via crowdfunding or subscriptions. Another healthy ecosystem developed, and science fiction short fiction and nonfiction could spread across the globe unlike any other time in history, and folks knew how to financially support it.\n\nThen sites began to compete harder for eyeballs (which drive ad revenue), locking out their competition wherever possible, and cross-platform sharing and promotion got more and more difficult. Even if you post everything everywhere in the most time-consuming ways, your content is less likely to be seen unless you’re willing to pay for promotional space (that is, formally advertise). For businesses the size of SF/F magazines, that just isn’t economically feasible.\n\nThen, a total asshat bought Twitter, making it worse and worse as a user experience. Please imagine us headdesking using the GIF of your choice. So many new social media platforms launched as Twitter/X alternatives, but none of them have become a true replacement with Twitter’s former numbers and reach.\n\nPromoting the work Uncanny published got a lot more difficult in every way. We often joke about promotion being an act of screaming into the void. Now we find ourselves trying to scream into multiple voids that refuse to talk to one another, run (in many cases) by promotional robots (aka algorithms) that don’t want you to see the cool shit we’re doing unless we pay for the privilege. This is especially disastrous when you’re also trying to point everybody toward important ways to fund the work and make sure everybody gets paid.\n\nThe Changing-Terms-for-eBook-Sales-and-Distribution Robot\n\nOne trend over the past decade was the consolidation of eBook sales for individual issues and subscriptions, with the vast majority of them—particularly for buyers who didn’t have direct contact with creators over the internet—coming through one website. You know the one. It’s named for a big river in South America. They captured the vast majority (depending on the analysis you look at, from 67 to 83%) of the global eBook market. They made sales and distribution super easy for both the buyers and the sellers.\n\nThe problem is, they aren’t particularly interested in sharing their capitalist wins with anyone who isn’t them, including the writers and publishers that create the eBooks. Having that much of the market means they can unilaterally change their terms, and that’s exactly what they did to all of us.\n\nThey closed their magazine subscription service that made them and us decent money, and forced the magazines onto their “streaming for books” service instead. Suddenly, magazines had no choice but to leave this website or accept a whole different payment structure that’s heavily balanced in the retailer’s favor. That change cost us over half of our subscription revenue from that retailer, without any way to directly contact the folks who subscribed in the old system. We couldn’t explain the changes and let them know better ways to support us. The money-making robots are taking a much bigger cut of the pie for just allowing us to exist. Except the way they’re running things, we won’t exist much longer without rapidly finding a different solution.\n\nThe AI-and-its-Discontents Robot\n\nAnd then, as the shit candle on the garbage cake, “AI” happened. On the word end of the AI landscape, large language models scraped a whole lot of (often copyrighted) words across the internet (without permission or payment), and vomited them back out with great force but very little sense, usefulness, or accuracy. We enjoy stories about artificial intelligences, but those stories are fiction. What we have now calling itself “AI” is nowhere near as sophisticated as what we see in fiction. Instead, we got a robot-driven nonsense factory of crap.\n\nNonsense AI submissions now flood Uncanny when we’re open to submissions. This costs us an extremely valuable resource: time. We, of course, reject those terrible AI-written stories. We pay the human writers we publish for the actual words they thought of with their own brains. Nonsense that comes from human brains is intentional and way, way less boring than whatever a large language model spits out in response to a prompt.\n\nAnd that’s not even taking into account the fact that “AI” is really bad for the environment. Supporting human short fiction, poetry, and essay writers by funding the markets that publish them is much more eco-friendly!\n\n#\n\nUncanny Magazine is a mom-and-pop business, run at our kitchen table with enthusiasm, a laptop, and a very small paid part-time staff. After a decade, we’re feeling kinda outnumbered by these three groups of robots that don’t worry overly much about our collective welfare.\n\nWELL, THAT JUST WON’T DO. WE ARE NOT ABOUT TO LET THE ROBOTS WIN, SPACE UNICORNS!\n\nThat is where you come in, you fabulous Space Unicorns! We’re ready to battle the robots for another year, and we need your help!\n\nWe got here by building a community of people who love the work we put into the world. This spectacular group of discerning readers is called the Space Unicorn Ranger Corps. With their support, we’ve published stories of community. Stories of friendship and love. Stories of dissent and resistance. Stories that give needed and welcomed hugs. Stories that constantly challenge expectations. We’ve published numerous award-winning stories over the last few years including Naomi Kritzer’s “The Year Without Sunshine,” P. Djèlí Clark’s “How to Raise a Kraken in Your Bathtub,” John Chu’s “If You Find Yourself Speaking to God, Address God with the Informal You,” R.S.A. Garcia’s “Tantie Merle and the Farmhand 4200,” Samantha Mills’s “Rabbit Test,” and Sarah Pinsker’s “Where Oaken Hearts Do Gather.” These stories reached the folks who needed them because of your support, Space Unicorns.\n\nPlease consider joining the Space Unicorn Ranger Corps by backing Uncanny Magazine Year 11: This One Goes to ELEVEN! Kickstarter!\n\nSpace Unicorns always deserve treats and joy, and we have lots and lots of goodies to add to that warm fuzzy feeling of banding together to fight evil robots. We offer all six Year 11 issues, delivered directly to you before they’re available on our website and at retailers. We have sixty autographed books! SIXTY! We have plushies of unicorns and Hugo the Uncanny Cat! We have opportunities to hang out with authors online, play games with them, and even have them critique your own stories! It’s a Space Unicorn party and you’re all invited!\n\nIt’s up to you, Space Unicorns. Let’s shine on together, and take this next year of Uncanny Magazine to ELEVEN.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThe Big Idea: Sarah Beth Durst\n\nIt’s time to save the universe! Or is it? In this Big Idea for The Spellshop, author Sarah Beth Durst makes the argument that sometimes you don’t have to save the whole universe to have a terrific story, and to have that story make a difference for its characters.\n\nSARAH BETH DURST:\n\nYou remember the scene in the Studio Ghibli movie Spirited Away where Chihiro rides the train? It’s a peaceful several-minute-long interlude: the girl and the spirit sit silently side by side as the train moves through the ocean while gentle music plays. I love that scene. It’s a deep-breath moment.\n\nMy Big Idea was to write a book that feels like a deep breath.\n\nI started with a librarian. She’s perfectly content to live the rest of her life secluded in the stacks of the Great Library of Alyssium, curating spellbooks for the elite sorcerers of the Crescent Islands Empire. But then there’s a revolution, and the library begins to burn. She rescues as many books as she can and flees, along with her library assistant (her best and only friend), a sentient spider plant named Caz.\n\nThey sail to Kiela’s childhood home, a remote and beautiful island, where they open a rather illegal spellshop that also sells raspberry jam.\n\nMy book, The Spellshop, is cozy fantasy. A deep breath. An escape. A sanctuary. A paean to the glory of jam and cheese and quirky friendships and love.\n\nIf you haven’t run across the term “cozy fantasy” before, it’s a type of comfort read, a descendant of optimistic fantasy. Think Lord of the Rings but you don’t leave the Shire. It’s low-stakes — in cozy fantasy, there’s no saving the world. Instead, you save a heart.\n\nAnd it’s both incredibly fun to write and surprisingly difficult from a sheer technical standpoint. As writers, we’re taught (or teach ourselves through a whole lot of trial and error) how to raise the stakes — how to rachet up the tension with each scene, each plot twist, each bit of dialogue. We strive to keep a reader breathlessly turning pages, to make our story un-put-down-able. We learn how to quicken the pace, heighten the emotions, and deliver the shocks.\n\nBut to write a book that feels like a warm hug… you need to unravel all of that.\n\nYou need to pick up each moment by the scruff of the neck and hold it until it calms the f- down.\n\nI honestly don’t think I could have written a book like this if I hadn’t written epic fantasy first. My epic fantasy novels have bloodthirsty nature spirits, leviathan-size sea monsters, bone armies… I’d last about five minutes in any of my epic fantasy worlds. The Queen of Blood, as the title implies, has a very high body count. Race the Sands… monster racing. The Bone Maker… yeah, that one starts with stealing a dead child’s bones in an attempt at necromancy — and that’s the hero. I raised the stakes as high as I could raise them.\n\nAnd this let me see how it was all woven together — to look at the threads on the reverse side and pick them apart.\n\nA moment is too tense? Go ride a merhorse.\n\nA bit of dialogue ramps up? Toss in a non sequitur. Add humor. Add banter. Or add an anecdote — throw a wrench into the gears.\n\nA scene moves too fast? Focus on the details, especially sensory details. Feel the breeze, smell the salt air, taste the sweet tang of the raspberry jam. Lengthen the sentences. Embrace adverbs. Revel in the here and now.\n\nWhy do this? The last few years — well, they’ve been rough on pretty much everyone… I wanted to write a book that would be not only an escape but also (hopefully) at least a little bit healing, that would allow readers a chance to take the deep breath they need.\n\nThe Spellshop is about kindness, empathy, and connecting with other people.

Song\n\nFor The Night Ends With Fire, author K.X. Song turns her eye to a strong human emotion and follows where having it leads, and what having it does to those who experience it. Which emotion is it? Read on to discover.\n\nK.X. SONG:\n\nIt all started with a journal entry, penned several years before the idea for The Night Ends With Fire came to me: “To want something so badly, even the wanting becomes beautiful. (Inherent.) To be alive is to desire.”\n\nFrom a young age, I was obsessed with wanting. I wanted to be somewhere I was not. I wanted to be someone I was not. I wanted less of one bad thing and more of another good thing. I was not unique in this regard, of course, but perhaps more than others, I condemned this aspect of myself. Either because of my conservative upbringing, my Chinese roots, or simply because I was a young woman growing up in the 21st century, I saw my desire as evidence of my immorality and tried my hardest to be content with what I already had.\n\nIt was a huge change, then, to reframe this core belief of mine—to decide that the act of wanting was not proof of my ingratitude but rather a beautiful and necessary part of myself that had contributed to my various successes in life. In many ways, it was the fervor of my wanting to be a storyteller that led me to publish my first novel at a young age. It was the intensity with which I wanted to run that led me to complete my first marathon. This quality of wanting could lead to unhappiness if coaxed too far, but it could also lead to tremendous happiness.\n\nSeveral years later, amidst the global pandemic and the grim news cycle, I was craving escape from reality. At the time I was finishing up edits for my first novel, a YA contemporary set during the 2019 Hong Kong protests. While the story was deeply important to me because of its personal significance, it was also draining to work on–perhaps for the same reason. One night, as I was falling asleep, an idea for an escapist fantasy novel came to me in a half-dream. Groggily, I grabbed my phone off my nightstand and wrote a few words. “Girl hungry for power” was one of them. “Dragon who feeds off greed” was another.\n\nI was fascinated by the core question of ambition: Was it a strength or a weakness? Could you possess too little or too much? And how did society treat you differently if you were an ambitious woman rather than an ambitious man? As I said, it is hard to know why I found my ambition (back then, I simply called it “wanting”) so depraved. To be clear, I’m not sure if it was because of my gender or other factors. But in The Night Ends with Fire, which is based on the Three Kingdoms period in ancient China, I created a world in which women are treated as secondary citizens to men. In this fantasy world, there is a quote from a made-up ancient text, inspired by the real Chinese language: “The Tian word for slave is made of two characters: girl and hand. For the girl is the slave, and the hand is the means with which she serves.”\n\nIt is beliefs like these that have been deeply ingrained in my protagonist, Meilin, so that she believes she should not want anything more than to serve her masters—her father, her husband, and one day, her son. The fact that she wants more than this is a sign of her corruption. And yet, she does want more. She burns with want. And it is this want that draws the sea dragon spirit to her; that lures her to join the army and change the fate of the Three Kingdoms.\n\nIn terms of the magic system, I knew I wanted to base the mythological creatures on the Four Auspicious Beasts in Chinese mythology: the Azure Dragon, the Vermillion Phoenix, the Ivory Tiger, and the Black Tortoise. These four creatures represent the four directions, the four seasons, and the four elements. I knew they would be background characters that would influence the humans on center stage. However, one of my pet peeves in reading fantasy is when mythological beasts or gods benevolently offer their power to humans without any strings attached or hidden motives. In our real world, when does this ever happen? (Do leaders with immense power simply donate large sums of money to certain individuals without any conditions or obligations?) So, I wanted to subvert this trope and give agency to my mythological creatures—to give them their own goals and motives, which may or may not align with our protagonist’s.\n\nAnother pet peeve of mine in fantasy worlds is when characters can draw upon their magical abilities without any consequences or limitations. For example, if I were to sit for hours for a mentally challenging exam or run twenty-six miles in a race, I would feel the effects of this effort in the days following. In a similar manner, I wanted magic use to wear on my characters; the greater the magic use, the longer lasting the consequences.\n\nInspired by my core question of ambition, I decided to make my mythological creatures feed off human emotion—otherwise, why would they need people at all? The Azure Dragon, who becomes bonded to Meilin, feeds off her greed. Meilin calls on her innate greed to harness her magic, and as she increasingly relies on her magical powers, her greed and ambition grow accordingly. Thus, as she changes the direction of the war, so too does the war change her.\n\nI never try to be didactic in my novels. There are no easy answers to these questions surrounding the merit of ambition, the immorality of greed. But through Meilin’s journey in The Night Ends with Fire, I aimed to ask what drives us in times of crisis. What is the true cost of ambition, and what price do we pay when we finally obtain the power we so desperately sought? Regardless of how pure our intentions, does that power ultimately change us? And in the aftermath of war, as we examine history in its black and white terms, what truly separates heroes from villains?\n\nThe Night Ends With Fire: Amazon|Barnes & Noble|Bookshop|Powell’s\n\nAuthor Socials: Web site|Instagram\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThe Big Idea: Benjamin Liar\n\nIn this Big Idea for his debut novel The Failures, author Benjamin Liar wishes for a particular machine beloved by science fiction — just not necessarily for the reasons you might expect.\n\nBENJAMIN LIAR:\n\nAnybody got a time machine?\n\nNot that there’s anything even remotely like time travel in The Failures; it’s just that with a time machine, I could get back to my eighteen-year-old self, peek inside his malnourished brain, and take a guess as to what the initial Big Idea for this book was.\n\nThirty years and what feels like a million drafts later, I couldn’t even hazard a guess. This was the nineties, so it probably had something to do with cramming Dinotopia into Wheel of Time and then dunking it in some Neuromancer. Was there a big idea there? A singular, compelling vision that’s carried me through all these years? A thematic flash of light so brilliant that it illuminated all paths?\n\nI doubt it. I think I still liked hair metal back then. I was not to be trusted with delicate things like ‘theme’.\n\nEven from my lofty height up here in the future, full of all this wise, bearded wisdom and able to casually leaf through my finished novel as if I’d intended the whole thing from the start, it’s hard to say what the central big idea is. Something pompous like ‘the perils of entrenched power systems’ would be true, but ‘hey, friends are important’ is equally true. For now, I’ll lean on the cover art: Look, gears!\n\nMachinery has fascinated me for a long time; both physical and spiritual. I like the making of things; one of the ‘magic’ systems in The Failures is of a very mechanist sort, articulated by the crafting of devices. But I also grew up very religious (and am now very not) and the machines we build out of social constructs—be it families, churches, politics, or book clubs—are endlessly captivating to me. As is the effort, lies, betrayal, love and sacrifice it takes to keep those machines running.\n\nThe Failures is, to some degree, about people caught up in those sorts of machines. Sophie Vesachai was a child hero, but is now trapped in the structure of her own myth. Two brothers, James and Chris, get caught up in a spectacularly convoluted system of plots and betrayals, thanks to an unlucky discovery. A group of would-be power players scheme to build a machine made of people to achieve their inscrutable ends—but machines made of people never run very well. The Deader might be a machine himself; how far down can you reduce a thinking creature before they become nothing more than gears and cogs, safe and predictable in their thoughts and actions?\n\nAnd then there’s Gun and Jackie; two indestructible jerks from our world, the proverbial grit in the gears. Show them the true nature of the world, and they’re liable to just kick the machine apart.\n\nIndeed, the world of The Failures might just be a mechanism itself. Scratch anywhere through the story’s skin and you’ll find gears, metal sinews, cogs; machines within machines. And all of them are, in their own way, accidental.\n\nWhen I began fleshing out this story, and this world, I didn’t have any big idea with the word ‘machine’ in it. All I was trying to do was to whisk my ideal reader away on a fun, fraught, complicated, dark adventure, to take you on a twisty little rollercoaster, and I hope I accomplished that part. There were some hardy, tenacious little thematic weeds that grew up in the cracks, though, and if you take away any thoughtful frowns on the subjects of social machinery, entrenched power systems, or the value of friendship, that’s just a bonus.\n\nStill, I can’t help but feel that I cheated on the assignment. You came here for a Big Idea and I hand-waved some theme and mimed some allegory.\n\nI’ll say this: my Big Idea wasn’t something that walked on stage, fully formed. It took many years of cutting, crafting, breaking off parts and sticking them different places. Kicking the machine apart and starting again. Being surprised by connections and linkages I’d never planned. I can feel the edges of it, a vague and shadowy shape, a machine made for some uncertain purpose, but the Big Idea still isn’t clear to me. Perhaps I’ll only see the whole thing when I get to the end of the tale—and then I’ll race on down to the Time Machine Dealership, dial a course for the nineties, and go whisper it in the ear of a scared, eager, naïve little eighteen year old.\n\nAnd while I’m there, I’ll chill to some absolutely sick hair metal guitar solos.\n\nThe Failures: Amazon|Barnes & Noble|Bookshop\n\nAuthor Socials: Website|Instagram\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThe Big Idea: Owen B Greenwald\n\nThe universe is filled with many wondrous things, but perhaps the most wondrous is when two authors can meld their visions together to create a single, unified work. Owen B Greenwald explains how, for Weapons of the Mind, he and his co-author Paul Kivelson collaborated for the novel, even when sometimes their initial visions were far apart.\n\nOWEN B GREENWALD:\n\nSpace is not only mind-bogglingly large, but mind-bogglingly strange. I came to this realization as a teenager, through an article about cool, exciting, unexpected things scientists had discovered in space—among them planets made of diamond, vast clouds of water vapor, and eternal electrical storms. I was stunned by what I read; my mind raced with possibility. If we had found these wondrous things in such a small slice of a single galaxy, what other marvels might the stars hold?\n\nThat question is the bedrock of Weapons of the Mind. My coauthor/best friend Paul Kivelson and I envisioned a sprawling, fantastical galaxy bursting with possibility. We untethered ourselves from any expectations placed upon us by genre or audience and let our imaginations run wild. Our goal was to transport the audience to impossible vistas on faraway worlds, introduce them to aliens unlike anything they’ve imagined, and take them aboard spaceships small and large, packed with technology that feels refreshingly magical. We wanted to inspire in our readers the same feeling as when we first looked at the night sky and imagined themselves in orbit around a distant planet.\n\nWeapons of the Mind is the story of a young woman taking her first real steps into this vast, beautiful, dangerous galaxy—but not by choice. Agent Tala Kreeth is on the run, her squad murdered, with all the evidence pointing to her as their killer. One step ahead of her is the murderer, orchestrating an enigmatic plan that only she can stop. One step behind is her former mentor, the warrior who shaped her into a living weapon through training in the paranormal art of Enhancement. As she simultaneously chases and flees across the galaxy, she grapples with test after test of the moral precepts she learned within her monastery, blurring the line between justice and revenge. No matter where her adventure takes her or how conflicted she becomes, the backdrop is always a galaxy far bigger than anything her life prepared her for.\n\nWhen writing within a setting of this scope, it’s easy to watch these large set pieces leap off the page and thus lose sight of the smaller details: the weathering, connections, and jagged edges that add verisimilitude to the backdrop and make the world feel “lived in”. We came up with so many little details that the story could hold only a fraction. (Readers interested in exploring the setting further can access the GIAB Portal page through my website; I encourage you to see what you can discover!) Early drafts had less of this verisimilitude than we were happy with, and cultivating it became a top priority as we realized how its deficit left our galaxy feeling sterile. Together, we developed this maxim: However big the situation, it’s only as compelling as its most mundane element. Striking that balance between fantastical, ass-kicking adventure and grounded, realistic detail was the subject of multiple revisions.\n\nBut while the setting and aesthetic are straight out of science fiction’s golden age, the story takes its cues from (and explores, and challenges, and interrogates…) the classic hero’s journey. I almost prefer to classify Weapons of the Mind as fantasy, since its veneer of futurism feels less important than the mysterious power Tala wields, or her quest to right a galaxy gone wrong, or the evil she must confront to do so. Yet just as a grand setting will feel inauthentic without careful attention to its facets, so too will a heroic struggle between good and evil feel trite and unsatisfying without real depth of feeling. Tala’s greatest conflicts come not from the enemies in her way, but from her internal struggle to reconcile her monastic teachings with her new circumstances, and how far down this new, darker path she’s willing to tread. How much of herself is she willing to sacrifice to pursue her goals? At what point do her boundaries start to look more like limitations? And when she’s given all she can, what parts of her will remain?\n\nWeapons of the Mind is a journey of discovery, both for the reader dipping their toe into this strange new galaxy, and for Tala laying bare the secrets that pump the lifeblood of her society. But writing it was its own strange adventure as Paul and I got accustomed to writing together. We had just graduated from college, and when we casually made an agreement to co-write a novel, we had no idea what we’d just signed up for. This experience taught us so much about the craft of writing, the art of collaborating, and the grace necessary to give and receive feedback. Working together has not always been easy, and finding our rhythm was part of the learning curve.\n\nWhen one person sets out to write something strange, they can follow their imagination to its limits. When two people must agree on the details of that strangeness, that journey becomes less about imagination and more about litigation. Never before has my best friend seemed so alien as when he sent me a chapter taking place on a certain train, the broad strokes of which we had agreed on when we outlined the plot—but which now looked, to my eyes, unrecognizable. We spent hundreds of hours in calls reconciling our respective opinions and placing every word exactly where we wanted it to be. In the end, thankfully, our love for our vision and for each other got us through even the worst of these disagreements, and we are very proud to present the fruit of our effort: a story fantastical and adventurous, but at its core human, where however grand the scope, the most important battles are fought within.\n\nWeapons of the Mind: Amazon|Barnes & Noble\n\nAuthor Socials: Web Site (Owen)|Web Site (Paul)|Facebook|Threads\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThe Big Idea: Tiffani Angus & Val Nolan\n\nThere’s so much to speculative fiction that you could write a book about it. And that’s exactly what authors Tiffani Angus and Val Nolan did! In fact, they did it twice. Today they’re here to tell you about their newest book, Spec Fic for Newbies: A Beginners Guide to Writing More Subgenres of Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Horror, Volume 2, which is not so much a sequel to Volume 1 as it is a continuation.\n\nTIFFANI ANGUS & VAL NOLAN:\n\nWe’re just gonna put it out there: We freakin’ love teaching. Our ideal jobs would be a spot at Xavier’s School for Gifted Youngsters or on the faculty of Starfleet Academy (come on, you know they absolutely have a legit Literature and Creative Writing Department!). Specifically, we love teaching Science Fiction, Fantasy, Horror, and all the uncategorizable crannies of weirdness and wonder that surround them. These subjects draw in the best students; they draw the best students out of themselves. Walking into a classroom and getting to discuss how these stories are made with novice writers who genuinely love genre fiction and seek to wield its power? Well, if that’s not the greatest job in the world then we don’t know what is (seriously, sometimes there are pizza parties; and, yes, with veggie and GF options!).\n\nSpec Fic for Newbies (which we discussed on this honorable blog last year!) was our effort to share the excitement of those classes with everybody who sought it. Our Big Idea in Volume 1 was to break down the genres we love into their constituent parts and explore just how they worked. We wanted to do this as a book in order to blow the doors off the university classroom and give anyone who wanted it access to robots and vampires and sundry blood-splattered horrors on demand. So, we dismantled our lesson plans and refashioned them into short and accessible introductions to thirty subgenres/major tropes and how one might go about starting to write them.\n\nBut you know what? Thirty wasn’t enough.\n\nThe magical gourd of our enthusiasm (eew?) has even more to share.\n\nAnd so we have spent the last year writing Spec Fic for Newbies: A Beginners Guide to Writing More Subgenres of Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Horror, Volume 2. We got to return to the haunted well and haul out a whole new bucket of subjects to discuss (which, as the kind of teachers who seriously dig the Dungeon Master vibe of curriculum design, was more of a treat than anything else!). Some are core subgenres and tropes such as Space Opera, or Dragons, or Ghost Stories. Others are topical matters fueling some of the most striking fiction being written today such as Biopunk and Ecohorror. Honestly, a few were because we wanted to nerd out about specific topics such as Submarine Stories (Val will forever be a SeaQuest DSV fan!) or Enchanted Clothing (Tiffani always wants to know how the costumes are made!). In all cases they are subjects that students have asked about or raised in the classroom.\n\nYet it’s not all fun and games (okay, it’s, like, 30% fun and games). One of the genuinely Big Ideas that teaching has taught us—and one of the things we in turn have brought into Spec Fic for Newbies—is how crucial SFF/H literacy is in the modern world. Teaching people to write these stories involves, as much as anything, teaching them how to read and interpret the way these subgenres and tropes have developed over time and how influential they have been (and still are!).\n\nBecause stories aren’t just stories, they’re the means by which we shape the world around us. Someone makes something up, it becomes embedded in culture, and, suddenly, everyone just seems to accept it (indeed, some people seem to straight-up believe it as fact!). That’s half of everything from politics to religion to economics to big tech! But learning to become a better SFF/H writer is all about learning to question these accepted norms. Consider the grifters shilling so-called “Artificial Intelligence” right now: you’re less likely to get taken in by their relentless sales pitch if you’ve familiar with the Mechanical Turk (admittedly real-life history) or The Wizard of Oz or basically any variety of Star Trek.\n\nBut we covered AI in Volume 1! In Volume 2 we look at some other subgenres that speak directly to the present troubles of the world. Consider Pandemic Fiction. In some ways, the greatest educational tools we had to help people understand the COVID-19 pandemic were novels including Colson Whitehead’s Zone One or Emily St. John Mandel’s Station Eleven, because as much as they sketched out imaginary pandemics (and so weren’t scientifically useful), what they excelled at was in modeling how people responded (positively and negatively) to such crises. Fiction offers, on the one hand, spaces where such ideas can be tested and, on the other hand, a ready and easily accessible vocabulary to help frame the problems.\n\nConsider Climate Fiction: Something like climate collapse is too big, too vast for many people to instinctively grasp its many (sometimes contradictory) implications (philosopher Timothy Morton calls it a “Hyperobject”, which is one of a few downright science-fictional—and super-useful—notions of literary criticism we try to point people towards). But when you break it down into stories of individuals faced with extraordinary challenges, you can then convey the dangers in emotionally comprehensible fashion. That’s how you can help readers or viewers to understand the ways this vast disruption will interact with their own particular slices of spacetime. That’s how you take complicated scientific ideas and make them accessible to wide audiences. And that’s not nothing.\n\nThus, teaching people the histories of these genres and how they typically manifest is equipping them with a toolkit not just to write great fiction themselves (though we hope they do!) but, also, to better survive in a world that is increasingly beset by issues and problems and villains that seem to have slithered straight from the pages and screens of Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Horror. These genres are important (arguably far more so than literary realism). They are machines for killing fascism. They are shields to defend your trans family and friends. They are a way of fighting for the future of every living thing on our planet. Teaching about them and how to use them means something to us, because it’s not just helping people to write any story, it’s about helping them to write their story, the one that reflects their world and their challenges and their anxieties and, crucially, their hopes.\n\nAt its heart, then, Spec Fic for Newbies Volume 2 is another part of our effort to do just that. It’s designed to be welcoming (and entertaining!) to both students in formal education (maybe writing students who don’t have an instructor with SFF/H sympathies?) and, indeed, to novice writers at any level. It follows the same format as Volume 1 (a BSFA Finalist also included on the Locus Recommended Reading List!). You can seamlessly move from any section of this book to that book and back again. They’re both part of a continuum. We’ve just expanded it a bit!\n\nWe hope you love it!\n\nWe hope you find it useful.\n\nWe’re sorry we couldn’t include the pizza party.\n\n—-\n\nSpec Fic for Newbies: A Beginners Guide to Writing More Subgenres of Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Horror, Volume 2: Amazon UK Preorder|Blackwell’s UK Preorder|Waterstone’s UK Preorder|Luna Press Publishing\n\nAuthor socials: Tiffani’s Site|Val’s Site|Tiffani’s Bluesky|Val’s Bluesky\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nNew EP: “The Wave Returns to the Water”\n\nToday is the first day of the second half of 2024, so it seems like a fine time to drop another EP of electronic/ambient music. So here you go: Five tracks of quality space-out music for your listening enjoyment, three of which I have not previously released. Let’s go through the tracks, shall we?\n\nYou Didn’t Know You Didn’t Know: Seeing that I now have a ridiculous number of guitars, I thought I should start incorporating them more into my original music. So this one has me twanging away on both my Acoustasonic and octave guitar. I like this track and may one day revisit it to put lyrics on it, but for now, it works without them.\n\nThe Wave Returns to the Water: Anyone who has watched the final episodes of The Good Place remembers Chidi’s monologue about waves and water, and the phrase stuck with me as something I wanted to do something with. This is it. What’s kind of wild is that track is based on me singing a lyric about the subject (the actual lyric I sang, which I made up on the spot, was “The wave returns to the water/The river returns to the sea/The moon returns to the open sky/And you will return to me”), which I then turned manipulated in a number of ways: Stretched it out, converted it to a couple of MIDI tracks, slathered both with effects, and so on. It makes for a track that rises and falls, like, well, a wave. I like it a lot.\n\nThe Wave (Reprise): I took some of the elements of “The Wave Returns to the Water” and made a somewhat darker and more dissonant version (it’s also a bit shorter). Fun fact: I actually compressed the running time of this piece and pitch-shifted it down a semi-tone, but then accidentally uploaded the longer, unshifted original version. Whoops! This version is perfectly good, however, promise.\n\nTake Only What You Can Carry: I made a joke on the Bluesky social media service about wanting to make an entire album of prog rock, which of course everybody there dared me to do. Well, I didn’t do that (I need, uhhh, more competence with more instruments first), but I did make this, which is kind of like what I expect “prog ambient” might sound like, down to the free-form synth solo in the back two-thirds of track. If you’re feeling proggy, this is for you.\n\nGood Friday: A pleasantly tinkly-and-drone-y way to close out this particular set of tracks.\n\nAs of this very moment, Wave is available on YouTube/YouTube Music and TIDAL and Amazon Music, and the other streaming services will have it up probably in the next day or so. I continue to be impressed at how quickly YouTube in particular gets this stuff up. I sent it in to DistroKid (my music distribution service) at about 11, they pushed it to the streaming services at 11:30, and YouTube (and YT Music) had it up less than fifteen minutes later. We live in an age of wonders. These wonders do not mitigate every other irritating thing, mind you. But at least they are something.\n\nIn any event, I hope you enjoy The Wave Returns to the Water. I enjoyed putting it together for you.\n\n— JS\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nState of the Scalzi, First Half of 2024 Edition\n\nToday is June 30th, which means that we have half of 2024 in the books, and so it feels like a good time and place to have a quick review of how things have been for me so far. And, well, it’s been mostly good! Indeed, in some ways it’s been spectacular. But there have been some less-than-great things as well.\n\nFirst, the good things: The first half of 2024 was extremely productive creatively. I wrote a novel, a novella, several movie columns, and two EPs of electronic music. The novella, the details of which I can’t reveal yet, will be out in the early fourth quarter of this year; the novel, When the Moon Hits Your Eye, will be out in March of 2025. The EPs, Difficult Time and Totality, are already out on all the streaming services. This is a pretty solid rate of output for a whole year, much less a half of one.\n\nThat said, that productivity does come at a cost. When I finished the novella, which I wrote fairly quickly after I wrote the novel, my noodle was definitively baked. As noted earlier, I am giving myself a summer vacation to let my brain recuperate, and two weeks in, I’m enjoying doing nothing. Well, that’s not true, I am not doing nothing, since I’m doing some creative stuff. But I’m not doing it with any aim in mind other than my own amusement. When I’m not amused with it anymore, I stop doing it, and watch a movie or nap or play with my cats or whatever.\n\nI feel pretty fortunate to be able to take a bit of time off. I’m already getting a bit creatively restless, however, so when I finally come back to actual paid writing when I return from Worldcon in August, I suspect I will be raring to go.\n\nThere was other good news, including Starter Villain winning a couple of awards and being nominated for others, including the Hugo, and the announcement of the book being in development at Ryan Reynolds’ production company. Some other very good things happened in the first half of the year but won’t be announced until the second half, so all I can say is wait for them, I think you’ll like them, and if nothing else they will confirm I am a lucky son of a gun.\n\nPlus! We had an eclipse right over my house, which was an excuse to throw a party for a bunch of friends, the annual JoCo Cruise was a delight as always, and Krissy and I got to go to Iceland, which we had planned to go to for our 25th anniversary but then COVID happened. We made up for lost time in that respect. All of these were wonderful and I recommend them all to anyone, although admittedly the eclipse one is harder to schedule than the other two.\n\nOh, and I bought some new guitars. Only one of which has arrived yet (I knew the other two had later delivery dates, it’s okay). You’ll see the other ones once they show up.\n\nSo, that’s the good stuff!\n\nWhat’s the less-than-great stuff? Mostly, I’ve physically let myself go for a bit, and it finally caught up with me in the first half of this year. I can actually pinpoint the moment it started: When I caught COVID while writing Starter Villain. I’ve talked about how it set my brain back for a couple of months, but I’ve talked less about how I cut back the physical exercise I had been doing, at first to make sure I wasn’t overtaxing my body, and then because I am a creature of inertia and once I stopped paying attention to the physical side of my health, it was easier to just keep not paying attention. I also stopped paying as much attention to what I was putting into my body. This is not great, because my natural setting when it comes to food is “graze,” especially when I’m writing books and I convince myself my brain is burning a huge amount of energy thinking of plot stuff.\n\nAll of which is to say that over the last couple of years I gained 30 pounds, getting close again to my all-time top weight. Which I do not love! My mental image of myself is at odds with my actual physical appearance, I’m tired out a lot, and my clothes shockingly did not adjust themselves to my new body shape, which was rude of them, honestly. I can blame COVID for being the precipitating incident in this downward physical slide, but ultimately I did this to myself. And while I am not here to comment on anyone else’s relationship to their own physical state, I know when I’m unhappy with my body, and when I feel that I’m at less than perfect health.\n\nAnyway, remember that summer vacation I mentioned? Well, in addition to using it to give my brain a rest, I’ve also been using it to reset my physical health as well: I’m both getting more, and more regular, exercise in, and paying rather closer attention to what I’m eating and how much of it – not just keeping an eye on intake but also eating less junk (not no junk — I like junk — but a lot less of it).\n\nI’m not driving myself to lose that 30 pounds in six weeks or anything silly like that. I am losing weight, but at a measured pace. It will take a while to get back down to where I’m happy, and I’m perfectly fine with that. I am using this time to get back in the habit of tending to myself better, so I can keep at it when I put my brain back to work.\n\nSo you will, with some effort on my part, see less of me in the second half of 2024, and that will be a good thing.\n\nThat’s where I am, mid-2024. There’s a lot going on in the second half of the year, for me and for the world — oh boy, is there — but for the first half of it, I’m happy to say that it’s mostly been good for me. With any luck, we can keep this rolling through to the end of the year.

The Hugo Award-winning author Allen Steele is your guide to this pulpy future past, as he tells you about the world of Captain Future, a hero from a bygone age, and why he’s resurrected this avatar of a long-gone future to live again in new adventures, including the latest, Lost Apollo.\n\nALLEN STEELE:\n\nNow that I find myself — unexpectedly and much to my own surprise — publishing my sixth Captain Future adventure, I’m also discovering that I’m at risk of repeating myself when it comes to discussing how and why I came to revive this classic character in the first place.\n\nIt would be easy to reiterate the story how I discovered a science fiction pulp hero of the 1940’s as a teenager in the 70’s, later satirized him in 90’s in my novella “The Death of Captain Future”, and finally decided to resurrect and reinvent the character himself in 2017 in a novel, Avengers of the Moon, followed by series of long novellas (short novels, really) published by Amazing Selects as Edmond Hamilton’s Captain Future, a semi-regular series of illustrated ebooks and trade paperbacks emulating the pulps of a bygone era .\n\nBut this is all stuff I’ve written about before, and if you’re a fan of the series then you probably know these things already. I’ve previously discussed the origins of the revision in the afterword to Avengers of the Moon that was later followed by another essay published in the first issue of EHCF (along with the novella “Captain Future in Love”) and yet another tracing the history of the original Edmond Hamilton version that’s on the EHCF website, https://captfuture.com). If you want the full backstory about the genesis of Hamilton’s character and my efforts to bring back him and his crew more than sixty years after their final Hamilton-canon appearance in the May 1951 issue of Startling Stories, then I recommend that you find and read those essays. Your time will be well spent if this is news to you and won’t be wasted if you’ve heard it all before.\n\nInstead, I’m going to talk about the new novel, Lost Apollo.\n\nAfter I finished the previous novel, The Horror at Jupiter (EHCF 4), I thought I was done with Captain Future. I’d achieved my primary goal, writing an epic space adventure that would bring back a favorite pulp hero of my youth and send him on a long story arc which would pit him against his arch enemy and send them both across the solar system and beyond. I’d also managed to complete the trilogy, albeit in a different form than originally intended, that I’d begun with Avengers of the Moon. Shortly before the novel was published by Tor, my editor David Hartwell suddenly died. He was replaced by an inexperienced assistant editor who didn’t get what I was doing and didn’t like Captain Future either, so despite the fact that Avengers had solid sales and earned outstanding reviews, she abruptly cancelled the rest of the trilogy, forcing me to find another publisher for the remaining two books, which were eventually published over the next three years as four episodic installments. Well then, so be it; I’d accomplished my mission, and now it was time to move on.\n\nThe audience occasionally get the last word when it comes to things like this, though, and it wasn’t long after The Horror at Jupiter came out that I began to get feedback from my readers. There had been only a couple of reviews — most SF critics ignored my Captain Future novels just as they’d ignored Edmond Hamilton’s original series — but nonetheless I received supportive fan mail from readers, and the royalty statements showed that the books were selling solidly, and this proved that the project had definitely been worth completing with a smaller publisher.\n\nBut besides that, I’d really enjoyed writing these stories. They weren’t radical, cutting-edge SF that pushed the envelope, but there’s a place in the world for traditional space opera, and plainly there are readers who want that button pushed. Curt Newton and the Futuremen are a fun bunch of guys to write about and I was sorry to be done with them. So why not continue?\n\nBy then, I’d had a brainstorm for a new story arc that would depart from what I’d done before. I told Amazing’s publisher Steve Davidson and editor Kermit Woodall that I’d come up with another Captain Future storyline and asked them if I could write another novel (well, maybe two). They were a little uncertain, so I waited awhile for sales to continue to build and then asked again, and once they finally gave me the green light, I finished another project and went to work on the next adventure.\n\nI’ve been a space buff all my life, starting with the original Project Mercury flights in the 60’s and continuing through the Gemini and Apollo programs. I was in middle school when NASA’s last manned lunar mission, Apollo 17, returned to Earth, and I was frustrated and angry when I heard the news that the next three Apollo missions had been cancelled for shortsighted political reasons. Yet it wasn’t until just a few years ago that I learned that the original final mission, Apollo 20, was tentatively planned to land in Tycho Crater … which, as all Captain Future fans know, is where the Futuremen have their hidden moon base.\n\nSF writers frequently play the “what if” Q&A game, and in this case the question was, “What if Apollo 20 had landed in Tycho and found Captain Future?” Of course, this meant I’d have to contrive a reason for an Apollo mission from the 20th century to land on the Moon in the 24th century … besides the fact, of course, that there had never actually been an Apollo 20 mission in the first place.\n\nI was still mulling this over when I learned something else that I hadn’t known before. I knew that the original NASA astronaut corps of the 60’s included several Black military pilots who’d been in training but had never got tapped for any of the early Mercury or Gemini missions because of racial internal politics too complex (and odious) to get into here. What I didn’t know, though, was that one of the cancelled Apollo flights might’ve included a Black astronaut … which meant that, if history had been different, a person of color could’ve walked on the Moon in the 70’s, something that we’ll see a few years from now when Artemis 1 reaches the Moon but should’ve happened much earlier.\n\nSince I was already working with alternate history, I decided to put a Black astronaut aboard my fictional Apollo 20 flight and even make him the mission commander (I also named him after a couple of teenage friends of mine from Nashville, my hometown). Then I continued to play the What If game by doing what Theodore Sturgeon said ought to be done, and followed the first question by asking the next logical question: what would happen if the astronaut whom NASA intended to be the first Black man to walk on the Moon suddenly found that his singular role in history was going to be denied to him?\n\nLost Apollo turned out to be a deeper novel than I originally thought it would be. It has plenty of good ol’ New Pulp action and adventure, with everything from a drag race on the Moon to a big space battle (look out for a cameo by the country-punk band The Chicks making a walk-on as a fighter squadron). But there’s also some things here that go beyond space opera.\n\nA quick pitch, then I’m done. The new issue of EHCF also includes, along with interior illustrations by M.D. Jackson, a spectacular cover by my all-time favorite comics artist, Michael W. Kaluta. It’s one of the best covers I’ve ever had for a book, and I’m really proud of it. And there’s also a long-lost interview with Captain Future’s original author, Edmond Hamilton, and his wife and fellow space-op pioneer Leigh Brackett, that was conducted by Darrell Schweitzer in 1978 for Amazing.\n\nHope you pick it up, and that you enjoy it.\n\nLost Apollo: Amazon\n\nAuthor Socials: Web site|Facebook\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading..."
