        "text": "BEFORE most summer music festivals, the questions are simple: What will the weather be? Who's performing? How much are tickets? But with reggae, it's a little different. New York City's biggest reggae concert of the season takes place on Sunday on Randalls Island, and some fans may have another question on their minds: Will any of the performers be booed offstage, or perhaps even attacked with beer bottles? It's a rare occurrence, but not unheard-of.\n\nThe question was put to Elephant Man, one of the headliners of the concert, the Guinness Reggae Carifest 2K2. \"You know, you don't think about bottles; I'm not into the war and the passa-passa,\" he said, using the slang term for gossip. \"Whosoever wants to go and get bottled, he can go and get bottled, but I'm coming to perform for the people.\"\n\nTo anyone who thinks of reggae as a laid-back relic of the 1970's, Sunday's concert might be a surprise. In its current incarnation, reggae — sometimes known as dancehall reggae — is a fierce, restless genre where creativity and competitiveness are closely linked. \"This is a younger generation of reggae music,\" said Beenie Man, another of the Carifest headliners. \"It's faster, more lyrics, more things to talk about, a better groove, something to jump to.\"\n\nReggae itself is relatively young. The first reggae records came out in the late 1960's, and the combination of soulful vocals and exaggerated backbeat was so popular that the term reggae became synonymous with Jamaican music. The name stuck even as the sound began to evolve.\n\nThe Jamaican record industry has historically been driven by D.J.'s, not consumers, and the D.J.'s required a constant stream of records that sounded new and different. So vocalists and producers embarked on a series of experiments. In the early 70's, producers experimented with radical remixes of popular songs (thereby creating a subgenre, dub reggae); later, they began to incorporate electronic sounds and samples. At the same time, vocalists were trying out a more declarative style — a combination of singing, talking and shouting.\n\nThe music-making process that has emerged is at once innovative and old-fashioned. Every week, a new batch of songs are pressed onto 45-r.p.m. vinyl records and snatched up by club D.J.'s, radio D.J.'s and a relatively small number of consumers. These singles are grouped by the musical backing track they use; the track is known as a rhythm, and when there's a really popular rhythm, virtually all the leading vocalists will record their own versions of it. It's not unusual for a leading vocalist to produce two or three discs' worth of material in a single year.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
