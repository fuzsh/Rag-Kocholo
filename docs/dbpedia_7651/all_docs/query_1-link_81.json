        "text": "RuPaul has forced the queens to do her songs 36 times\n\n1 year ago\n\nAfter 15 years of RuPaul’s Drag Race, which has seen the show become a cultural juggernaut and a global franchise with queens performing the house down BOOTS in multiple countries, it’s fair to say that there have been a ton of lip syncs. All kinds of songs have been performed – even some spoken word numbers. But which artists have been lip synced to the most on Drag Race? Here’s a rundown of the top 11 most performed pop icons who’ve had their songs lip synced to on RuPaul’s Drag Race.\n\nAretha Franklin (Seven times)\n\nThe queen of soul has been featured seven times on the show, with my favourite embedded above – Latrice Royale literally mothering. The Aretha Franklin lip syncs are as follows:\n\nSomething He Can Feel (Jujubee VS Tatianna)\n\nNatural Woman (Latrice Royale VS Kenya Michaels)\n\nThink (Adore Delano VS Joslyn Fox)\n\nJump To It (Monet X Change VS Manila Luzon)\n\nPride [A Deeper Love] (Brooke Lynn Hytes VS Vanessa Vanjie Mateo)\n\nRESPECT (Daya Betty VS Jasmine Kennedie)\n\nSisters Are Doin It (Raja VS Yvie Oddly)\n\nMadonna (Seven times)\n\nThe queen of pop and best artist of all time only having seven songs performed? This must change. She did get a full Rusical in her honour and two runway categories, but the point still stands. Madonna’s seven lip sync moments are:\n\nVogue (Milan VS Kenya Michaels)\n\nExpress Yourself (Vivacious VS Kelly Mantle)\n\nCommotion (Naomi Smalls VS Acid Betty)\n\nMusic (Peppermint VS Cynthia Lee Fontaine)\n\nOpen Your Heart (Shea Coulee VS Vanessa Vanjie Mateo)\n\nBurning Up (Heidi N Closet VS Brita)\n\nExpress Yourself (Megan VS Roem)\n\nDua Lipa (Seven times)\n\nIt’s a bit of a slay that Dua Lipa has two albums but is already tied with Madonna on this rundown of most lip synced artists on Drag Race? Her bangers that have featured are:\n\nNew Rules (Vinegar Strokes VS Gothy Kendoll)\n\nDon’t Start Now (Tia Kofi VS Asttina Mandela)\n\nBreak My Heart (Symone VS Olivia Luxx)\n\nPhysical (Laganja Estranja VS Trinity K Bonet)\n\nPhysical (Reggie B VS Juicy Couture)\n\nHallucinate (Krystal Versace VS Vanity Milan)\n\nSweetest Pie (Jaxx VS Aura Mayari)\n\nCeline Dion (Seven times)\n\nIt feels both random AND correct that Celine Dion didn’t get lip synced to until Canada’s Drag Race kicked off?\n\nI Drove All Night (Priyanka VS Kiara)\n\nIt’s All Coming (Icesis VS Kendall VS Pythia)\n\nIt’s All Coming (Ivy-Louise VS Love Masisi)\n\nPrière païenne (La Kahena VS Lova Ladiva)\n\nA New Day Has Come (Gisele Lullaby VS Jada Shaida Hudson)\n\nRiver Deep, Mountain High (Silky Nutmeg Ganache VS Ra’Jah O’Hara)\n\nIt’s All Coming (Salina EsTitties VS Luxx Noir London)\n\nBeyoncé (Eight times)\n\nJust had so much joy rewatching Jasmine gobble Maddie right up after the Untucked drama… Beyoncé’s eight also include any time a Destiny’s Child song popped up.\n\nCrazy in Love (Dearis Doll VS B Ella)\n\nBootylicious (Brooke Lynn Hytes VS Silky Nutmeg Ganache)\n\nSurvivor (Jaida Essence Hall VS Crystal Methyd VS Gigi Goode)\n\nSuga Mama (Jasmine Kennedie VS Maddy Morphosis)\n\nRadio (Jorgeous VS Angeria Paris VanMichaels VS Lady Camden)\n\nTelephone (Willow Pill VS Angeria Paris VanMichaels)\n\nGreen Light (Jaida Essence Hall VS Trinity The Tuck)\n\nSingle Ladies (Salina EsTitties VS Malaysia Babydoll Foxx)\n\nKylie Minogue (Eight times)\n\nShocked that it took until I Was Gonna Cancel for Ar Kylie to arrive for a Drag Race lip sync, but she’s quickly solidified herself as one of the most lip synced artists. And with a discography like that, can you blame anyone?\n\nI Was Gonna Cancel (Jasmine Masters VS Kennedy Davenport)\n\nI Love It (Maddy Morphosis VS June Jambalaya)\n\nBetter The Devil You Know (Scarlett Adams VS Maxi Shield)\n\nSupernova (Blu Hydrangea VS Mo Heart)\n\nSupernova (Shea Coulee VS Monet X Change)\n\nGet Outta My Way (Spankie Jackzon VS Faux Fur)\n\nStarstruck (Beverly Kills VS Pomara Fifth)\n\nWow (Spankie Jackzon VS Kween Kong VS Hannah Conda)\n\nAriana Grande (Nine times)\n\nShockingly, after the “I’d like to keep it on please” fiasco Ariana Grande didn’t get cursed off and her bangers still get lip synced to now.\n\nBreak Free (Jaidynn Diore Fierce VS Kandy Ho)\n\nGreedy (Nina Bonina Brown VS Valentina)\n\nBang Bang (Aquaria VS Eureka VS Kameron Michaels)\n\nInto You (Valentina VS Monet X Change)\n\nProblem (Nicky Doll VS Dahlia Sin)\n\nOne Last Time (Roxxxy Andrews VS Miz Cracker)\n\nNo More Tears Left To Cry (Symone VS Utica)\n\nFocus (Silky Nutmeg Ganache VS Pandora Boxx)\n\n7 Rings (Amethyst VS Irene Dubois)\n\nWhitney Houston (Nine times)\n\nI will think about the rose petals falling from Sasha Velour’s scalp as So Emotional booms out til the day I die and I am NOT joking.\n\nGreatest Love Of All (Shannel VS Akashia)\n\nSo Emotional (Sasha Velour VS Shea Coulee)\n\nIt’s Not Right But It’s Okay (Sasha Velour VS Peppermint)\n\nHow Will I Know (Manila Luzon VS Trinity the Tuck)\n\nI’m Your Baby Tonight (Shuga Cain VS Ariel Versace)\n\nI Learned From The Best (Symone VS Rosé VS Kandy Muse VS Gottmik)\n\nI Wanna Dance (MaMa Queen VS Madame VS Miss Abby OMG\n\nHeartbreak Hotel (Jorgeous VS Bosco)\n\nLove Will Save The Day (The Vivienne VS Jinkx Monsoon)\n\nLady Gaga (10 times)\n\nIf anyone was going to crop up in most lip synced to artists on Drag Race, everyone would expect Mother Monster in the mix – Lady Gaga has had 10 lip syncs done to her tunes. Kylie recovering from the Stupid Love performance love fall… wow.\n\nBad Romance (Delta Werk VS Phoenix)\n\nBorn This Way (Milan VS Jiggly Caliente)\n\nApplause (Laila McQueen VS Naysha Lopez)\n\nThe Edge of Glory (Yvie Oddly VS Brooke Lynn Hytes)\n\nBorn This Way (Morrigan VS Meannie Minaj)\n\nBorn This Way (Envy Peru VS Janey Jacke)\n\nStupid Love (Kylie Sonique Love VS Ra’Jah O’Hara VS Ginger Minj VS Eureka O’Hara)\n\nTelephone (Willow Pill VS Angeria Paris VanMichaels)\n\nJudas (Jinkx Monsoon VS Shea Coulee)\n\nDance In The Dark (Minnie Cooper VS Beverly Killz)\n\nBritney Spears (12 times)\n\nFrom season one til now, Britney has always gobbled her way to the top of artists with the most songs lip synced to on Drag Race, and she deserves even more – let’s face it.\n\nStronger (Bebe Zahara Benet VS Ongina)\n\nToxic (Jiggly Caliente VS Alisa Summers)\n\nOops (Honey Mahogany VS Vivienne Pinay)\n\nI Wanna Go (Trinity The Tuck VS Charlie Hides)\n\nStronger (Peppermint VS Trinity The Tuck)\n\nWork Bitch (Mercedes Iman Diamond VS Kahanna Montrese)\n\nIf You Seek Amy (Denali VS Rosé)\n\nTil The World Ends (Symone VS Kandy Muse)\n\nToxic (JAJA VS Annee Maywong VS Petra)\n\nWomanizer (Jessica Wild VS Jan)\n\nWork Bitch (Kandy Muse VS Rosé)\n\nGimme More (Symone VS Gottmik)\n\nRuPaul (36 times – lol)\n\nIf there’s one thing mother knows how to do, it’s promo. I will save both you and me from typing out all 36 times RuPaul has got the queens doing Supermodel and Sissy That Walk, but yeah – THIRTY SIX TIMES.\n\nRuPaul’s Drag Race season 15 continues to air exclusively in the UK on the streamer of all things drag, WOW Presents Plus.
