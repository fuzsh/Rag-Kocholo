Large tempo differences can sometimes indicate the song was originally intended to be played at half or double the speed you're hearing it now.\n\nHalf-time: If the song is actually half-time, it would feel slower because the underlying beat is being counted at half its speed.\n\nDouble-time: Conversely, the song might be double-time, making it sound faster because the underlying beat is being counted twice as fast.\n\nIt's important to listen to the song itself to determine the intended tempo and feel.\n\nSongs in the tempo of 118 BPM\n\nKey: G minor Camelot: 6A\n\nThis is track No. 4 on the album Black Butta . The track duration is : 3 minutes 13 seconds\n\nListen on Spotify\n\nAudio preview: Your browser does not support the audio element."
