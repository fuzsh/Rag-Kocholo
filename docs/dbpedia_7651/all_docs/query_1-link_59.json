        "text": "March 14, 2024\n\nIt is hard for me to put into words why it is this memoir did not resonate with me, and why I didn’t feel it succeeded. Still, this is a review, so I’ll try.\n\nFirstly, it felt like Rupaul cared more about being quotable than about being vulnerable. His writing style was so flowery and focused on being quotable, it distracted from him actually telling his story. It felt like he was preaching about life instead of just telling us about his. There were moments throughout where it felt a bit more authentic, specifically when he was speaking about his now husband, but for the most part, there seemed to me an undercurrent of marketing over truth. I suppose, it’s on brand for Rupaul, but I’m disappointed the memoir wasn’t a bit more raw and vulnerable. Everything that happened had a quotable sentiment afterwards about life’s hidden meanings, and deep thoughts, and word play word play word play\n\nSecondly, I think this memoir alienates Rupaul from the rest of drag culture even further than he has started to become. The memoir paints a very removed drag queen from the real drag scene of the world. Rupaul admits that drag for him was never about community or creativity but about being famous. Drag was a means to get famous and he even admits that becoming the polished “supermodel” version of Rupaul that ultimately led to his fame, was all because he saw power and money in changing. Essentially to me the memoir is about a boy who wants to be famous, and the steps they take to become famous. Drag was never about the art, the community, the defiance for Rupaul. It was a means in which he saw a path to stardom.\n\nWith this information, it’s harder for me to accept their personal narrative of being Queen of Drag. This does however, explain more about why Rupaul is so rarely in drag anymore.\n\nI think I went in with higher hopes than I should have and this ultimately felt like a let down.\n\nFebruary 28, 2024\n\nDon't go into 𝗧𝗛𝗘 𝗛𝗢𝗨𝗦𝗘 𝗢𝗙 𝗛𝗜𝗗𝗗𝗘𝗡 𝗠𝗘𝗔𝗡𝗜𝗡𝗚𝗦 looking for celebrity dirt (although there is one telling story about Madonna). Instead, RuPaul uses this memoir to reflect on his dysfunctional upbringing and the battles he fought to not only to become a star, but just to survive.\n\nListening to him tell his story, it's not the hyped up, over-the-top superstar you see on Drag Race. This is the vulnerable and scarred queer black boy who grew up in the South. He stresses the importance of taking what makes you different and finding a way to making it your superpower, and also how much of a role self-belief plays in finding your way. Ru had to reinvent himself over and over in order to achieve what he has, and there's a lesson in that for all of us - it's never too late to start again.\n\nMarch 28, 2024\n\nquite a nice read and I learnt a lot I didn’t know about Ru. I feel like we only scratched the surface though. Surely this memoir could be triple the size and really give us the nitty gritty. Still, I enjoyed it and am happy I read it.\n\nMarch 11, 2024\n\n4 fabulous stars for Ru’s new memoir - a growing up gay, Black & poor journey filled with trauma, courage & especially perseverance. The focus here is less on celebrity and stardom, and more on becoming, striving, surviving, acceptance & self awareness. We’re of a similar age, so I also really enjoyed the look back at specific time periods (plus disco, punk & New Wave). I would have liked a bit more of an ending and more of Ru’s later, more recent years, but I did enjoy & recommend.\n\nJuly 27, 2024\n\nRu Pau’s The House of Hidden Meanings: A Memoir is a deep dive into RuPaul's life. But this isn't the book for you if you're looking for a book about the movies they are in, the celebs they know, drag races, or award shows. It is about sobriety, generational trauma, abuse, a very traumatic childhood and finding a way through that with nothing but belief in himself. I love that we get the backstory of how RuPaul and the legendary Lady Bunny became lifelong friends, but this book was very different than I thought it would be. It was a challenging, sad read, but I'm glad I made it to the other side. Ru's story will break your heart, but it also seems to inspire, especially with their constant search and celebration of love, light and joy.\n\nA side note that this is not celebrity gossip; this is the life and the struggles Ru went through to be the RuPaul you see today. I paired my library copy with the audio, creating an emotional and immersive experience. I cried many times throughout the struggles he endured with addiction, and when he spoke of his childhood, that was heartbreaking.; you could hear the pain and joys he experienced in his voice. I highly recommend the audio.\n\nMarch 18, 2024\n\n'The awareness didn’t take long. It came on strong and clear and loud, almost instantaneously. This was where I belonged. When you hear your story told through someone else’s mouth, you know you’ve arrived at the right place.\n\nThis was where I belonged.\n\nIt felt like a fantastical trick had been played on me. Georges was the one in rehab. And yet I was also hitting rock bottom.\n\nI had walked right into the house of hidden meanings.\n\nI took a seat.'\n\nAn extra star for Mean Mother Charles.\n\nMarch 10, 2024\n\n2 stars\n\nI have long been a fan of RuPaul’s music and a recent watcher of drag race. I was expecting to learn more about his life and delve into what led him along his career and I have to say I’m disappointed.\n\nI think he covered a lot of his youth and adolescence fairly well but he didn’t really delve that deep into his emotions or really let the reader into his life. It was very guarded and curated and then it was summarized with a very deep and resonating statement that commentated on the experience without really reflecting deeply on it.\n\nI also think the time frame was quite odd, only focusing on his life ascending to fame and not past age ~35. He also often glossed over deeply traumatizing or really upsetting situations (e.g. his first sexual experience). I just didn’t really see the value of writing a memoir if you’re not going to really get into it. Overall felt like this was another endeavor from our capitalistic bestie - can’t say I don’t respect the grind but wasn’t great as a reader.\n\nApril 19, 2024\n\nI'm unsure about this one. RuPaul has been famous pretty much my entire life. I remember seeing the video for Supermodel on VH1 as a kid( that song still goes off). I've obviously seen Drag Race but it's been years since I've watched it. RuPaul has just always been around.\n\nWhen I read a memoir I want to leave it feeling like I know this person on a personal level. With this book I just didn't feel anything about RuPaul. This book just didn't feel personal. I never felt anything on a vulnerable level. I also think it's weird that despite coming up during a pivotal moment in the history of Drag, the 70's and 80s he barely mentions the scene. Who did he look up to as a young Drag Queen? It's as if RuPaul feels like he invented Drag. It's weird.\n\nI didn't like this book but I'd still recommend it if you want something quick to read. But it's mostly just a disappointment.\n\nJune 12, 2024\n\nI have no intention of bashing this book, but it 100% did not meet my expectations. I don’t really care for the most part if a celebrity chooses to gloss over some of the more personal aspects of parts of their life or any traumatic experiences of their upbringing and instead focus on their journey to fame and fortune, but they have to give me something.\n\nRuPaul was coming into his own in New York Freaking City during the time of Club Kids, the AIDS crisis, closeted lifestyles, you name it. I didn’t just want to hear how/why he decided to become the “prettiest girl in the room” – I wanted to get to know him. Although well-written, this felt more like an extended fluff piece for a publication like Vanity Fair.\n\nThe one good thing? The audio was great and it certainly helped me get more than 5 miles in while listening and attempting to . . . .\n\nApril 19, 2024\n\n3.5 stars\n\nRuPaul is an American drag queen, singer, television personality, fashion icon, and writer. Among other accomplishments, RuPaul produces, hosts, and judges the reality competition 'RuPaul's Drag Race', which began airing in 2009 and is still going strong. In this memoir, RuPaul writes about his family; his life; his struggles; and his road to becoming a successful entertainer.\n\nRuPaul Andre Charles\n\nRuPaul judging 'RuPaul's Drag Race'\n\nRuPaul was born in 1960 in San Diego, where he lived in a little house with his parents, Ernestine (Toni) and Irving, and his three sisters. As a boy RuPaul liked to watch television, which was \"a window into something greater, a portal to new worlds.\" Inspired by television programs, RuPaul would put on shows for his mother, impersonating Tina Turner, or Carol Burnett, or LaWanda Page (who played Aunt Esther on Sanford and Son).\n\nRuPaul's parents Ernestine and Irving\n\nYoung RuPaul\n\nRuPaul with his sisters Renae, Rozy, and Renatta\n\nRuPaul's mother was a strong flinty woman who taught him independence and self-sufficiency, while RuPaul's father - who was charismatic but self-centered and a cheater - went off with his mistress when RuPaul was a boy. RuPaul saw little of his dad after that, and the loss was deeply felt by both RuPaul and his mother, who took to her bed for years when her husband left.\n\nRuPaul's mother Ernestine Charles\n\nYoung RuPaul wasn't like most other boys. He writes, \"Most queer people understand the experience of growing up feeling that you are a little bit different. But I was REALLY different.....I had been codified in the neighborhood consciousness from a young age as a sissy.\"\n\nAdolescent RuPaul\n\nRuPaul had some friends, but he felt depressed; bored at school; and trapped in provincial San Diego. By the time RuPaul was in 10th grade, he would skip class and sit in the quad smoking cigarettes until it was time to go home.\n\nDuring high school RuPaul moved in with his sister Renatta and her husband Gerald, but he still cut classes and smoked weed. Soon afterwards, Gerald, Renata, and RuPaul moved to Atlanta, so Gerald could build up a business, which involved flipping luxury cars.\n\nRuPaul observes that Atlanta was everything San Diego was not - Atlanta was progressive, cosmopolitan, and had a large Black population. RuPaul enrolled in the Northside School of Performing Arts, where he was in the chorus and took acting classes before he just stopped going to school. RuPaul then began helping Gerald with his business, driving cars back and forth across the country.\n\nAtlanta had a large Black population\n\nWanting to break into show business, RuPaul worked up an act for an Atlanta public access television show called 'The American Music Show.' RuPaul notes, \"The aesthetic of the American Music Show was unorthodox and raw....the guests would sing a song while playing guitar or perform a dance number or just it and chat.\" RuPaul and some girls he knew formed a punk rock group called 'RuPaul and the U-Hauls' and RuPaul made all the costumes. He recalls, \"I'd buy cheap fabric and fashion a dress or a top from it, tie bands of fabric around my arms, make a headband.\"\n\nRuPaul early in his career\n\nRuPaul early in his career\n\nRuPaul and the U-Hauls\n\nIn Atlanta, RuPaul felt like he'd found his community, that he belonged, that he was understood. RuPaul writes a good deal about this period of his life, when he hung out with friends, struggled with poverty, did his show around town, worked as a go-go dancer, formed a new punk rock group called Wee Wee Pole, dated some boys, and used a lot of substances, like alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, acid, sleeping pills, LSD, etc.\n\nAtlanta had a lively party scene\n\nRuPaul singing with Wee Wee Pole\n\nWee Wee Pole\n\nRuPaul worked as a go-go dancer early in his career\n\nRuPaul wanted to be a success in New York City, but had to hone his act in Atlanta before he could make it big up north. RuPaul went from 'Boy George' type drag to high-femme drag, and finally found his niche. Around this time, RuPaul decided he was going to stop using chemicals and clean up his act, but the reforms didn't last.\n\nRuPaul in the 1980s\n\nRuPaul doing a nightclub act in Atlanta n the 1980s\n\nRuPaul got his big break with his 1992 song \"Supermodel', which changed his life in many ways. Rupaul writes, \"For the first time in my life, I had some money - which is not to say I was instantly rich. But since that day, I'd never again felt the fear of homelessness or poverty.\"\n\nRuPaul hit it big with his song 'Supermodel'\n\nRuPaul became a very popular entertainer\n\nOn the downside, RuPaul's alcohol and drug use crept back little by little. RuPaul remembers, \"I was doing my nightclub act, promoting my products, and shooting movies. I was exhausted all the time. And the only way I knew to feel connected to the little part of me that was still left was to get high.\"\n\nConcurrently, RuPaul was searching for romantic love, which added to his stress. RuPaul mentions a number of boyfriends that didn't work out, and writes about the ups and downs of his relationship with (his now husband) Georges Lebar, which was derailed (for a time) by their mutual substance abuse.\n\nRuPaul and Georges Lebar early in their relationship\n\nRuPaul and Georges Lebar\n\nThe book ends before the advent of 'RuPaul's Drag Race', and before RuPaul's marriage, so (I imagine) there might be a sequel.\n\nThis memoir feels like an honest depiction of RuPaul's life, without sugar coating. RuPaul was determined to be a star from the time he was a child, and he worked hard to achieve his goals while he struggled with family problems; used alcohol and drugs; had little or no money; saw the ravages of the AIDS epidemic; had runs in with police; mourned his mother's death; and more.\n\nI'm a fan of RuPaul's Drag Race, and I'm always struck by RuPaul's empathy for the contestants, who - as gay men (for the most part) - often suffered rejection growing up. RuPaul's own background probably contributes to his understanding and good will.\n\nContestants on 'RuPaul's Drag Race'\n\nRuPaul and the 'Pit Crew' on RuPaul's Drag Race\n\nIf you're a fan of RuPaul, this is a must read. Even if you're not a fan, this is still an interesting story. My major quibble would be that some of the philosophical insights, which are abundant, feel a bit tacked on.\n\nYou can follow my reviews at https://reviewsbybarbsaffer.blogspot....\n\nAugust 12, 2024\n\n3.5 stars. reading vlog: https://youtu.be/9FFZU3SUmHk\n\na fascinating life that i feel like we didn't go into enough depth of! I think rupaul could've written like 3 memoirs of different periods in his life that this book included. loved the audiobook just felt a bit rushed\n\nMay 20, 2024\n\nEhhhhhhh\n\ni'm a big fan of RuPaul, and I'll watch/listen/read to anything he creates, but The House of Hidden Meanings was a slow go for me.\n\nFirst of all, Rupaul is a fantastic audiobook narrator. If you have the chance to get this book in audio format, this is the way to go. I don't know if I would have finished it in ebook form. He is clearly used to preforming, and does a great job with emotion and inflections in his voice.\n\nBut the content...\n\nThis book mainly focuses on Rupaul's childhood and his desire to be famous. There is a lot of flowery, sound-bitey talk about Rupaul's development in his early ages, but that's really it. My favorite parts of the story were the later ones when we saw Rupaul meeting his current husband and how their relationship grew and changed, but then the story cuts off. I honestly thought it would be more current information included, not just ages 5-35.\n\nOverall, I found it to be a worthwhile listen, but it didn't touch upon the growth of Rupaul into television or his later music career, and really skimmed over most of what it means to be a drag queen these days. I found myself wanting more.\n\n*~*Follow me on instagram for more reviews, book talk, and deals posts*~*\n\nFebruary 1, 2024\n\nThe House of Hidden Meanings is RuPaul's memoir.\n\nI am obsessed with RuPaul's Drag Race so naturally I had to read Mama Ru's memoir. This was such a good memoir. I only really know Ru from Drag Race and I loved getting to learn more about them. I loved that Ru narrated the audiobook. It seemed like they were in the room with me. Not only does this book talk about RuPaul's life but it also goes into the LGBTQ history. Many times I found myself laughing out loud while listening to this. RuPaul is just so iconic and this book shows how special they really are. This memoir is a good mix of very serious topics to more light-hearted ones. This book just made me love RuPaul even more. You know what they say if you can't love yourself, How in the hell you gonna love somebody else? Can I get an amen?\n\nThank you so much, RuPaul, Harperaudio, and Librofm for the ALC of this book.\n\nMarch 21, 2024\n\nThank you to @libro.fm for an ALC of this precious memoir. I find it weird to rate a memoir, but definitely 5 stars.\n\nNot a celebrity tea book, but a story about survival in an environment set up to fail. ❤️ Highly recommend.\n\nApril 9, 2024\n\nI struggle writing reviews with memoirs. It’s hard for me to judge someone personal’s experiences. However, I felt like Rupaul’s House of Hidden Meaning was very personal. On Rupaul’s Drag Race episode Booked and Blessed - the queens had to come up with their own books. Which was a great way for Rupaul to plug his own memoir. He did mention that to be successful- you have to be vulnerable and reveal a side of yourself that not everyone is familiar with. I think he nailed it was this book. This memoir read like a diary- he talked about a lot hard, heavy topics that he faced. That isn’t easy for to share- I definitely do like that I have deeper understanding of him besides what I see and of him on TV.\n\nThis memoir is him pre-fame. His story, growing up and finding himself in the south.\n\nThe only negative I had with this book was keeping up with all the people that Rupaul names. Yes, he writes over a time span over several years but I get lost after so many people are constantly getting introduced.\n\nMarch 17, 2024\n\nI’m sad I didn’t like this more than I did. I really like rupaul and was excited to read his memoir. To be honest it was a little dull and meandering - i was confused with people and places a lot of the time. I love his voice and enjoyed listening to him tell his story but it didn’t keep my attention enough for me to really love it. It was interesting to hear how he got to where he is now, but not my favorite storytelling.\n\nJuly 15, 2024\n\nI was hoping it would be more compelling. We certainly could use more LGBTQ+ voices. But it was as exciting or as interesting as if I had written a memoir of my own life. The material was there, but the storytelling was weak.\n\nMarch 27, 2024\n\nTo be clear, this is not a memoir of RuPaul's entire life. It begins in his childhood and ends shortly after his rise to fame from Supermodel with some rushed bits about recovery and falling in love. There is not one mention of RuPaul's Drag Race, or Michelle Visage, or what will ultimately be—whether he likes it or not—Ru's lasting legacy.\n\nBecause you almost get the sense that he doesn't want it to be (and by \"it\" I mean bringing drag into the mainstream and all of the good and bad that has come with that). And sure, when it's your memoir, you get to pick and choose which parts of your story you tell and how you tell them. I guess I was just a little disappointed with this one. This book was at times too self-congratulatory and condescending—I got tired of hearing how much of a joke the world is from someone who has profited entirely from the way it works.\n\nI hesitate to say this, because a Black man rising to meteoric fame as a drag queen in this country is nothing short of miraculous, and Ru has his own guts, guile, and belief in himself to thank, no question. And any good drag queen (or superstar for that matter) will tell you an important key to their success is just the right amount of delusion. What \"just the right amount\" is, though, is the question. I can’t help but imagine Ru telling a fellow queer or POC who is struggling to make ends meet or afford healthcare, “Stop taking life so seriously!”\n\nRead\n\nFebruary 9, 2024\n\nMy pop culture knowledge of RuPaul is limited to the single season of Drag Race All Stars I watched in college with one of my roommates, but even as a casual observer, I was still immediately pulled into Ru's world and moved by the emotional narration.\n\nI love memoirs that are narrated by the authors themselves (particularly when the author is a performer/artist by trade), as you get a tenderness and vulnerability that a different narrator simply wouldn't be able to convey. The House of Hidden Meanings on audio is no exception to this, and I found myself both tearing up when Ru's voice would crack and getting hyped when he passionately described a memorable performance or career breakthrough.\n\nA heartfelt read for fans and casuals alike, and I'm glad I was able to experience it :\")\n\n(Thank you to libro.fm for providing me an ALC of this book!)\n\nRead\n\nApril 17, 2024\n\nI don't rate biographies and memoirs.\n\nIm absolutely fascinated with Rupaul and how they've grown to be this absolute juggernaut with such a choke hold over the drag industry. Growing up the only drag icons I really knew about were Lily Savage and Ru, and what made Ru all the more powerful and intriguing was that they were so beautifully and intentionally Black and gay, and proud of it. This was at a time in the 90s when representation was abysmal. So I was really interested to read a memoir from that time that promised to explore the inner monologue of Ru and their experiences. Did it meet my expectations? Not fully - this feels very stream of conscious at times, very guarded and deliberately selective in what is presented. However I enjoyed my time seeing some of RuPaul's more personal stories and experiences.\n\nApril 7, 2024\n\nmama, kudos for saying that… for spilling 😍\n\nJune 29, 2024\n\nI liked this one, but if I have one complaint, it’s that it seems like Ru was holding back; like he was being intentionally withholding. I mean surely Ru went through more struggles of becoming a drag queen in the 80s and 90s than what he lets on here. It felt like so many insightful details were glossed over, making it appear that Ru’s life was much “easier” than reality would suggest.\n\nI did like the writing from start to finish. Learning about his childhood years was definitely the highlight for me. And it was nice to see that he had a mostly supportive family (his sisters and mother).\n\nI expect there will be a Part 2 to come. The book stops before anything RuPaul’s Drag Race related. So, if you’re looking for insight on the show, you’re not going to find that here. Perhaps this book is meant to be the first part of a duo or trilogy. That’s what I’m thinking.\n\nThis memoir is also surprisingly low on celebrity dirt. Well, except that one Madonna mention. Woof.\n\nEnjoyed my time with this one. Wish it had gone deeper. I’m sure there were rougher times than what Ru eludes to, but I guess it’s his prerogative to not want to share it. For what it’s worth, I still got something out of it.\n\nMarch 17, 2024\n\nRuPaul as a person?: 5 stars\n\nThis memoir?: a sensible 3 stars\n\nA good read, but I was hoping for more details and insights. It gradually devolves into a laundry list of “and then this happened, then this happened, then I met this person..” I can’t help but feel like focusing on more precise moments and fleshing those out in more detail may have left more of an impact? I still enjoyed it for what it is, though.\n\nMarch 7, 2024\n\n4 stars\n\nI am, have been, and always will be obsessed with Ru.\n\nMarch 27, 2024\n\nUnfortunately could not sashay away from this memoir fast enough :-(\n\nMarch 18, 2024\n\nThe House of Hidden Meanings is a testament to the power of resilience, self-discovery, and the bonds that unite us. Through introspective reflection and a series of anecdotes, RuPaul takes the reader on an incredibly transformative voyage into his personal / professional life. He explores a series of themes throughout all the memoir, including identity, authenticity, and the relentless pursuit of one’s dreams. Along the way, he reveals the hidden meanings that are embedded within his iconic drag persona and offers a glimpse into the complexities that lie beneath the surface.\n\nThe memoir is one huge emotional rollercoaster which effortlessly evokes feelings of laughter, sadness, and profound inspiration. RuPaul’s vulnerability and honesty creates an intimate connection with the reader, allowing them to witness his struggles, triumphs, and the impact he’s made on the world.\n\nRuPaul’s writing style is almost as captivating as many of his drag performances, seamlessly blending wisdom, wit, and a touch of Southern charm. Each chapter flows beautifully, carrying readers through the ups and downs of his extraordinary journey. The prose is eloquent and accessible, making the memoir a pleasure to read for readers of all different backgrounds and experiences. I found the pacing of the memoir to be both steady and engaging, gradually building momentum as RuPaul’s career begins to take off. The narrative structure allows the reader to witness RuPaul’s evolution from a shy and insecure teenager to the confident and highly influential figure that he is today.\n\nIt’s important to note that the memoir primarily focuses on RuPaul’s individual journey, with limited coverage on the behind-the-scenes of RuPaul’s Drag Race. Whilst some readers may be disappointed by this decision, it ultimately allows RuPaul to delve deeper into the many transformative experiences that have shaped him as an artist, an activist, and a cultural icon. I think one of the main standout aspects of the memoir is how RuPaul is able to weave personal anecdotes with the wider social commentary. He addresses important issues, including racism, homophobia, and the AIDS epidemic, therefore providing a poignant and thought-provoking perspective on the many challenges faced by members of the LGBQ+ community.\n\nOverall, The House of Hidden Meanings is very much a captivating and inspiring memoir which invites readers to embrace their individuality, all while challenging the norms of society, and celebrating the transformative power of self-expression. It is a must read for anyone who is interested in books that revolve around themes of LGBTQ+ culture, self-acceptance, and the power of pursuing one’s dreams\n\nMarch 5, 2024\n\nOn Friday nights at my home, you can usually find my husband and me glued to the TV, catching the latest episode of RuPaul's Drag Race. This reality competition, hosted by the legendary drag queen RuPaul, is a joyous celebration of queer art, expression, and identity, making it not only culturally significant but also incredibly entertaining. RuPaul has mesmerized audiences for years with his drag persona, delivering a unique blend of humor and fantastical charm. Still, the man behind the supermodel has remained relatively veiled. In his memoir, The House of Hidden Meanings, RuPaul extends an intimate invitation, offering readers a glimpse into his life and laying bare his soul. It gives us a chance to finally meet the authentic RuPaul.\n\nRuPaul always stood out. As a young black boy in San Diego, he grappled with his queer identity in an era when such struggles weren't widely accepted. With his father intermittently present and his mother contending with her own emotional challenges, one thing was evident—RuPaul was destined for stardom. He reflects on the laughter he could evoke from his mother, who predicted his future fame. Despite the hardships, RuPaul embarked on a journey of self-acceptance, learning to embrace and express his true self.\n\nThe House of Hidden Meanings doesn't offer a current behind-the-scenes glimpse of RuPaul's life, and there's no mention of the reality show that has dominated his recent career. Instead, the memoir delves into RuPaul's coming-of-age narrative, unfolding alongside significant moments in queer history. As the emerging superstar shaped his identity as a drag performer within the punk scenes of Atlanta and New York, he also played a pivotal role in bringing queer art to the forefront.\n\nIn this deeply personal memoir, RuPaul candidly shares his story, steering clear of the glamorous façade of his current stardom. Listening to the audiobook, narrated by the author himself and provided by the publisher, I felt the passion, pride, and pain that underscored his life story. RuPaul confronts the hurdles he faced during his rise to celebrity, offering unfiltered accounts of his struggles with relationships, the challenges of the entertainment industry, and his battle with drug addiction. Ultimately, he discovered strength through his chosen family, self-acceptance, and confronting his demons. The telling of this story makes for an insightful and inspirational read.\n\nRead\n\nMarch 10, 2024\n\nA bit disappointed, tbh. Not to say I didn’t enjoy the book. What was given was entertaining. However, the book is quite slim and font rather large, leading to a saddeningly brief memoir that feels like it does little to share new stories. It also ends early in Ru’s life, never really getting into details of his life in the 2000s. Potentially a set up for another book? Maybe. Nonetheless, I hoped for more.\n\nRead\n\nJune 28, 2024\n\nIm feeling a bit mixed about this memoir. I think that I enjoyed most of the first half of the book. I especially enjoyed the relationship that RuPaul had with his mother and how he managed to capture her essence - the beautiful, sometimes volatile, caring and supportive mother she was.\n\nIn general hearing about his childhood and adolescent life was very well written. I think that the second part of the book felt a bit rushed. Like he gave us samples of these periods of his life. Hey, he’s entitled to his privacy and share what he wants, but some of the experiences felt lacking. I think that the book was ended somewhat oddly as well. Throughout most of the book, he discusses his drug use that was so engrained in his life. Then towards the end of the book, he explains his journey to recovery. While it is a very important part of his journey, it felt like the memoir led up to this, and then just ended abruptly. And then he didn’t even talk about the beginnings of his biggest success, drag race. I know he’s written other books so maybe they’re in there? Idk\n\nIt’s still worth a read or listen. I was entertained by most of it and it was fun to hear some of his stories. Listening to as an audiobook narrated by him was also helpful\n\nSome favorite quotes\n\n“[death] remains taboo in our culture because we are ruled by our ego. And our ego wants to believe that we can cheat death, that we can find some path to immortality”\n\n“For the first time I found myself wondering,…radically, what would it be like to give someone else everything I have ever wanted to be given to me. My whole life I had been skeptical…a suspicion of others intentions.”\n\nCan’t find the otherssss\n\nEdit - I remembered that I really liked how rupaul would talk about his relationship with drag. And how he felt more masculine dressed as a woman because he knew the power that women hold."
