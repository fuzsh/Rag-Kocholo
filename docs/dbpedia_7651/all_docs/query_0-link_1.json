        "text": "2005 single by RuPaul\n\n\"WorkOut\" is the second single from RuPaul's album Red Hot. The song is a dance/house song about feeling liberated while dancing. The expression \"work out\" is (not exclusively) gay slang for expressing one's self exuberantly; it is similar to RuPaul's coined phrase \"You better work!\". Two versions of the single were made available; one version, with 8 tracks, was released by RuPaul on her own RuCo, Inc. label. The other version, a 3 track version released only in Germany, was released on the Dance Street label.\n\nMusic video\n\n[edit]\n\nThe music video was catered to club play and features a montage of RuPaul in different outfits singing the song in locations such as a rooftop and a dance club.\n\nTrack listings\n\n[edit]\n\nWorkOut (The RuMixes) (Ruco, Inc.
