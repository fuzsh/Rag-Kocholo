        "text": "Recommendations for the Week of: January 19th - January 26th, 2018​\n\nHey everyone, we're back again for 2018 with a whole new staff body who are eager to share their tastes with everyone! We should be going back to weekly once again, remember these will be posted every Friday at midnight (12AM MT)! Along with our new recs, don't forget about our old recs either... we have revamped the very first posts in the thread containing our collection of staff recs. Our current staff recs collection will be updated for the new current staff, and we've added a former staff section as well, so you can check out what the old Studio staff listened to! Don't forget to check in every once in a while for new recommendations and also feel free to drop your own music / song recommendations in the thread as well!\n\n(#) Brandon~\n\nSong: Charli XCX - Femmebot (feat. Dorian Electra and Mykki Blanco)\n\nGenre: Electronic Pop/Experimental Pop\n\nDescription: Charli XCX released another mixtape, and it’s amazing! The whole thing is really exploratory and experimental. Femmebot in particular is really clever in its lyrics, the song is really catchy, I can get down to it. The theme of being a “femmebot” really works in with the electronic and (intentionally) glitchy parts of the song too. If you like the sound of the song, definitely check out the mixtape!\n\n(@) Arrested\n\nSong: Portugal. The Man - Live in the Moment\n\nGenre: Alternative / Indie / Rock\n\nDescription: Been re-listening to Portugal. The Man's latest album Woodstock lately, and aside from Feel It Still, this is definitely my favorite track.\n\n(@) Paradise\n\nSong: Joyner Lucas - I'm Sorry\n\nGenre: Hip-Hop\n\nDescription: Warning: This song handles the topic of suicide. That being said, Joyner Lucas has probably made one of the most impactful pieces of art in hip-hop that I’ve personally ever heard with this song. It’s heavy, but it’s definitely worth a listen.\n\n(%) KingSwordYT\n\nSong: Imagine Dragons - Believer\n\nGenre: Pop / Rock\n\nDescription: Nice song for Imagine Dragons, one of the best song they’ve released since Not Today…\n\n(%) babsus\n\nSong: The AAA Girls - Pride Or Die\n\nGenre: Pop\n\n(%) 1Surgeon\n\nSong: Mariah Carey - Dedicated (feat. Nas)\n\nGenre: Hip-Hop / R&B\n\nDescription: Interesting collaboration that makes constant references to 80s and 90s hip hop music. The song samples Inspectah Deck’s verse on Wu-Tang Clan’s “Da Mystery of Chessboxin’” and makes other references to their debut album “Enter the Wu-Tang Clan (36 Chambers)”. Also references Doug E. Fresh and Slick Rick’s 1985 track “La Di Da Di”. Really enjoyable track overall.\n\n(%) rovietsussia\n\nSong: Nick Drake - Pink Moon\n\nGenre: Contemporary Folk\n\nDescription: This song was on a Volkswagen commercial back in 1999, and it gave Nick Drake a bit of popularity, 25 years after his death. With the exception of this song’s bridge having a bit of piano, this album was entirely Nick Drake and his guitar. It is a very bare record that reflects the depression he suffered throughout his life. He died just 2 years after this was released, in 1974.\n\n(%) vivalospride\n\nSong: Lil Wayne - Big Bad Wolf\n\nGenre: Hip-Hop\n\nDescription: New Wayne record following the amazing (in my opinion) Dedication 6.\n\n(%) coin sassy boy (coinboy)\n\nSong: On the Might Of Princes - For Meg\n\nGenre: Emo / Screamo / Post-Hardcore\n\nDescription: exceptionally written piece of screamo with amazing build up and production. when someone becomes everyone. when somewhere becomes everywhere.\n\nRecommendations for the Week of: January 26th - February 2nd, 2018\n\n​\n\n(#) Amingo\n\nSong: Every Time I Die - Map Change\n\nGenre: Metalcore\n\n(@) StarBlim\n\nSong: Oshwa - Genie\n\nGenre: Art Pop\n\n(@) Arrested\n\nSong: The Beatles - Paperback Writer\n\nGenre: Rock\n\nDescription: Been listening to The Beatles for several months now, can't get enough of them. This is one of my more recent favorites, and one of my favorites from The Red Album as a whole.\n\n(@) Doom Metal\n\nSong: Eternal Wheel\n\nGenre: Psychedelic Rock\n\n(@) Paradise\n\nSong: Breakbot - Fantasy (feat. Ruckazoid)\n\nGenre: Funk / 90's Pop\n\nDescription: Chances are you've run into Breakbot's music from multiple memes/vines over the years, but this is one of his songs that personifies what most of his music is like: very good attempts at the Michael Jackson sound.\n\n(@) John (John76)\n\nSong: Endon - Your Ghost Is Dead\n\nGenre: Noise\n\nDescription: Noise rock / Hardcore from Japan. Chaotic but strangely melodic at the same time. FFO: Boris, walls of sound.\n\n(@) painted toenails (bumbadadabum)\n\nSong:of Montreal - long pretentious title or some shit\n\nGenre: hipster trash\n\n(@) Mezari\n\nSong:The Brian Jonestown Massacre - Anemone\n\nGenre: Psychedelic Rock\n\nDescription: sexy.\n\n(%) vivalospride\n\nSong: Migos - Too Playa\n\nGenre: Hip-Hop\n\nDescription: New song from the Migos project Culture II featuring 2 Chainz and an amazing saxophone.\n\n(%) AlphaWittem\n\nSong: Astrix - Deep Jungle Walk\n\nGenre: Psy-trance\n\n(%) rovietsussia\n\nSong: ミドリ - 凡庸VS茫洋\n\nGenre: art punk, post-avant jazzcore\n\n(%) babsus\n\nSong: Kylie Minogue - All The Lovers\n\nGenre: Pop\n\n(%) KingSwordYT\n\nSong: Drake - God's Plan\n\nGenre: Drake (Trap)\n\nDescription: OMG im posting Drake!? this is going to be a hit. F-I-R-E\n\n(%) Alapse\n\nSong: Surf Curse - Christine F\n\nGenre: Alternative/Indie\n\nDescription: The introduction for their newest release \"Nothing Yet\". Annoyingly catchy.\n\n(%) 1Surgeon\n\nSong: Mary J. Blige - Real Love\n\nGenre: Hip Hop / Soul\n\nDescription: This is one of MJB's first hits, bringing together elements from Hip Hop and Soul music, which she's known for doing. It samples Audio Two's '87 hit, Top Billin' and MC Lyte's 10% Diss. The song's more or less about a heartbreak, and the struggle of finding true love. It has, however, a very optimistic view on it, being composed in an up-tempo sound and having a very positive message throughout the record about perseverance and resilience.\n\n(%) coin sassy boy (coinboy)\n\nSong: TOPAZ - Cross\n\nGenre: electronic chillwave organic idk\n\nDescription: it's really good.\n\n(Also, obligatory call-out that Brandon~ was the only staff member not to get a rec in this week!)\n\nRecommendations for the Week of: February 2nd - February 9th, 2018​\n\n(%) AlphaWittem\n\nSong: Sagi Abitbul & Guy Haliva - Stanga\n\nGenre: Electronic Dance\n\nDescription: Totally addicted to this mix, it's a continous crescendo that won't disappoint you.\n\n(%) vivalospride\n\nSong: Fabolous & Jadakiss - F vs. J Intro\n\nGenre: Hip-Hop\n\nDescription: From Fab and Jada's horror movie based collab album late 2017, this intro is nothing but bars. \"Now he in a awkward room tryna lock a goon/ Like the shooter had a hood on, mighta been Dr. Doom/ Sounded like a fifth or a nine, couldn’t tell though/ All a sudden, thunder, it mighta been Hoodie Melo\". Thats so clean lmao.\n\n(&) not a shit user (bumbadadabum)\n\nSong: of Montreal - Derek I Wish You Were Born a Girl\n\nGenre: Psych Pop\n\nDescription: I dedicate this to EV.\n\n(@) Doom Metal\n\nSong: Return to the Origin by Mike Oldfield\n\nGenre: Ambient\n\nDescription: Famous prog artist makes music for a computer game with excellently relaxing results.\n\n(%) coinboy\n\nSong: autechre - LCC\n\nGenre: idm\n\nDescription: extremely detailed idm with godly percussions.\n\n(#) You Know Whoooooooo It Is (do we?) (Brandon~)\n\nSong: SZA - Drew Barrymore\n\nGenre: R&B\n\nDescription: One of my favorite songs of SZA's. I love how vulnerable and personal the song gets about the follies of love and when it doesn't work out. Check out the rest of the album CTRL as well!\n\n(%) rovietsussia\n\nSong: weezer - across the sea\n\nGenre: alternative rock, emo-ish\n\nDescription: rivers wants to date an 18 year old japanese girl but he can't because he's a creepy weird dude in america, so he writes a song about it.\n\n(@) Mezari\n\nSong: Julia Holter - So Humble the Afternoon\n\nGenre: ambient pop, dream pop\n\nDescription: chill bro, just chill.\n\n(#) Amingo\n\nSong: Carpenter Brut - Meet Matt Stryker\n\nGenre: Electro\n\n(%) babsus\n\nSong: RuPaul - Glamazon\n\nGenre: Pop\n\n(@) StarBlim\n\nSong: Twiabp - Eyjafjallajokull dance\n\nGenre: Emo\n\n(%) 1Surgeon\n\nSong: N.E.R.D. - Lemon ft. Rihanna\n\nGenre: Hip Hop / Rap\n\nDescription: Pretty political song about the current US president, filled with a bunch of double entendres. The word \"Lemon\" is usually used to describe a broken car, which in this context might just be a reference to Donald Trump. Overall really cool production + interesting lyrics makes this song worth a listen (not to mention that seeing Rihanna rapping is very refreshing).\n\n(%) KingSwordYT\n\nSong: Dua Lipa - IDGAF\n\nGenre: Pop\n\nDescription: Dua Lipa is never wrong. Amazing the way she has grown up, on my personal top right now. Myst Listen\n\n(@) Arrested\n\nSong: Nym - Come Back\n\nGenre: Downtempo\n\n(@) Paradise\n\nSong: Joey Bada$$ - Paper Trail$\n\nGenre: Hip-Hop\n\nDescription: From Joey's album, B4.Da.$$ (Before the money), Paper Trail$ takes money related cliches regularly found in hip hop and flips them to discuss what money and making it big really means to someone.\n\nRecommendations for February 9th, 2018 - February 16th, 2018​\n\n(%) AlphaWittem\n\nSong: Blastoyz & Skazi - Fear\n\nGenre: Psytrance\n\nDescription: Don't Fear Psytrance. Embrace it.\n\n(%) corn bassy soy (coinboy)\n\nSong: death grips - spread eagle cross the block\n\nGenre: experimental hip hop\n\nDescription: I FUCK THE MUSIC\n\n(&) bumbadadabum\n\nSong: MGMT - not Kids or Electric Feel\n\nGenre: pure genius\n\nDescription: ok hand sign emoji\n\n(%) vivalospride\n\nSong: SOB X RBE\n\nGenre: Hip-Hop\n\nDescription: Black Panther soundtrack is amazing, but this song is fuckin nuts.\n\n(%) 1Surgeon\n\nSong: Kendrick Lamar, SZA - All The Stars\n\nGenre: Hip Hop / Rap\n\nDescription: This is from the new Black Panther soundtrack, so obviously has a lot of references to the comic book, and also the bible. Kendrick raps about love, fame, and God, while SZA's chorus is about achieving our dreams.\n\n(%) babsus\n\nSong: Alaska Thunderfuck ft Gia Gunn - Stun\n\nGenre: Dance / Electronic\n\n(%) rovietsussia\n\nSong: built to spill - car\n\nGenre: \"'\"'\"indie rock\"'\"'\", and i guess chamber pop because there are violins thrown in there so it sounds nice\n\nDescription: the vocals are kind of whiny which is grating at first, but if you look past that this is a great song. built to spill are great at writing catchy hooks, and this is one is no exception\n\n(#) Amingo\n\nSong: Perturbator - Sexualizer\n\nGenre: Synthwave? idfk\n\n(@) StarBlim\n\nSong: The Salty Suites - Seattle\n\nGenre: Bluegrass\n\n(%) Alapse\n\nSong: MGMT - Little Dark Age\n\nGenre: Synth Pop // Alternative\n\nDescription: Weird funk / synth vibe to it. Super strange and addicting. The rest of the album is a must listen also.\n\n(@) Doom Metal\n\nSong: Falling forever- Paradise Lost\n\nGenre: Gothic Metal\n\n(#) Brandon\n\nSong: Whitney Houston - I Wanna Dance With Somebody\n\nGenre: Dance-pop/ R&B\n\nDescription: An oldie, but a really fun and timeless song that talks about wanting to find the one that you want to dance with forever. Houston has an amazing voice, and it really works well with the funky undertones of the song.\n\nAlso, help us in congratulating Arrested on getting Room Owner!\n\nIronically enough, he also didn't link a song recommendation this week.​\n\nRecommendations for the Week of: February 16th - February 23rd, 2018​\n\n(%) AlphaWittem\n\nSong: Seven Lions - Worlds Apart with Kerli\n\nGenre: Dubstep\n\nDescription: This is easily Seven Lions' best work, and his best collaboration with Kerli. Her voice is just perfect for this beat, angelic and powerful. The drop is beyond words, you gotta listen if you wanna experience one of the best work of Dubstep.\n\n(%) cornlad (coinboy)\n\nSong: Everyone Asked About You - Paper Airplanes, Paper Hearts\n\nGenre: lo-fi twee pop/emo\n\nDescription: girls r cute\n\n(%) KingSwordYT\n\nSong: Julia Michaels - Heaven\n\nGenre: Pop\n\nDescription: Amazing soundtrack for Fifty Shades, pretty catchy song.\n\n(%) rovietsussia\n\nSong: Q and not U - hooray for humans\n\nGenre: post-hardcore, dance-punk\n\nDescription: one of my favorites from dischord records, if you enjoy this song you should check out that label, influential stuff from DC. anyway this song is a lot of fun, 2 spazzy guitar leads over a really strong rhythm section. q and not u were always better as a four piece like on this record because they had the neat intertwining guitar parts, they went to a trio after this album and never were as interesting.\n\n(%) coinboy\n\nSong: autechre - LCC\n\nGenre: idm\n\nDescription: extremely detailed idm with godly percussions.\n\n(&) bumbadadabum\n\nSong: Queens of the Stone Age - Villains of Circumstance\n\nGenre: kinda like qotsa and the mars volta had a baby\n\nDescription: Other than being a relentless shitposter on PS I'm also really sensitive and emo and this song reflects that side of me well.\n\n(%) vivalospride\n\nSong: Keylontix - Anti(x)\n\nGenre: Electronic\n\nDescription: This is Kink's music and I was tryna find some shit to rec this week and I've been enjoying this song for a while and encourage everyone else to listen to it as well, I think it's dope. n_n\n\n(@) Doom Metal\n\nSong: Linkin Park - Numb\n\nGenre: Teenage Angst\n\n(#) Brandon~\n\nSong: Dua Lipa - Be The One\n\nGenre: Pop\n\nDescription: Dua Lipa is a new artist of 2017/2018, and honestly I really love her voice. She has a much deeper voice than most female artists, and I find it really compelling. This song in particular is a song that really showcases her vocals well in my opinion and really shows the heart and sincerity that she puts in her must. She's just really chill and cool tbh, but if you like this song, I'd definitely recommend the album!\n\n(#) Arrested\n\nSong: Lil Skies - Nowadays (feat. Landon Cube)\n\nGenre: Hip-Hop/Rap\n\nDescription: One of my favorite tracks from Life of a Dark Rose.\n\nRecommendations for February 23rd - March 1st, 2018​\n\n(%) babsus\n\nSong: Katy B - 5 AM\n\nGenre: Pop\n\nDescription: Bop\n\n(%) AlphaWittem\n\nSong: The Eden Project - Jupiter\n\nGenre: Chillstep\n\nDescription: One of my favorite track by EDEN. His voice is simply amazing, and his ability to mix such a beat with classical instruments like violins gives me chills every time I listen to it.\n\n(%) 1Surgeon\n\nSong: Camila Cabello - Consequences\n\nGenre: Pop\n\nDescription: Camila's debut album is fantastic, and Consequences is one of the best tracks for me. It sort of falls into the album's main theme, being the contrast between being in love and breaking up, and she even mentions issues related to her mental issues (OCD). Very chill ballad overall.\n\n(%) rovietsussia\n\nSong: dads - get to the beach!\n\nGenre: midwest emo, math rock\n\nDescription: fun fact, the song before this on the album is titled \"if your Song Title Has the Word \"Beach\" in It, I'm Not Listening to It\" so the Dads Lads really were pulling all of our legs with that funny joke.\n\n(%) coinboy Formerly known as born cassy soy\n\nSong: LSD and the Search for God - Starting Over\n\nGenre: shoegaze\n\nDescription: music for sleep\n\n(&) bumbadadabum\n\nSong: Leslie Hall - Tight Pants/Body Rolls\n\nGenre: Experimental\n\n(#) Amingo\n\nSong: He Is Legend - Gold Dust\n\nGenre: some subgenre of rock\n\n(%) vivalospride\n\nSong: Lil Wayne - Young\n\nGenre: Hip-Hop\n\nDescription: I think im lowkey addicted to this song rn holy shit, so catchy.\n\n(%) KingSwordYT\n\nSong: Perfect - Topic & Ally Brooke\n\nGenre: Dance/Electro\n\nDescription: Ally got talent! Nice song with good vibes and cool message\n\n(#) Arrested\n\nSong: Big Wild - When I Get There\n\nGenre: Electronic\n\nDescription: When will the beat drop?\n\n(@) Paradise\n\nSong: Dilated Peoples - This Way Ft. Kanye West\n\nGenre: Hip-Hop\n\nDescription: A nice gospel feel from Dilated Peoples and pre-Kardashian Kanye rhyming on a 90's hip hop beat.\n\n(#) Brandon~\n\nSong: Taylor Swift - Call it What You Want\n\nGenre: Pop\n\nDescription: While Reputation is much better than I predicted it'd be, I find myself gravitating towards the 1989-esque songs, and this is one of the songs that long-time Taylor fans can really come to appreciate and love. It's a standard Taylor love song, but I find it to be really catchy and fun to listen to!"
