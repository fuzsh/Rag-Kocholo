MEDIA GIANTS — West Hollywood, Calif. (April 29, 2011) *** Confirming she is “America’s Next Drag Superstar,” Raja, winner of season three on Logo’s “Rupaul’s Drag Race,” is delivering a fierce new single titled “Diamond Crowned Queen” from Citrusonic Flavor Recordings. Raja teamed up with producers Eddie Amador and Josh Peace for the track, which has all the edge and sass that her fans are hungry for. “Diamond Crowned Queen” will be available for purchase on iTunes and other digital retail outlets beginning May 3.

“When I wrote and recorded ‘Diamond Crowned Queen’ with Eddie Amador and Josh Peace, I made sure to inject my own unique flavor throughout,” states Raja. “The club track is a new fusion of electro house with a touch of disco sleaze to shake up the landscape of dance music. Performing it LIVE when I am on the ‘Drag Race’ tour is going to be brilliant!”

The avant-garde single “Diamond Crowned Queen” was written by Anthony Garza, Raja, Eddie Amador and Josh Peace and is the first release from Citrusonic’s Flavor imprint.

“Working with drag superstar Raja on Citrusonic Flavor’s first release is an exciting collaboration,” states Orlando Puerta, Head Honcho at Citrusonic. “The entire team gravitated together magically and we produced a fresh and unexpected single, which I believe will catch fire with Raja fans and through club play worldwide.”

Raja will headline Logo’s Drag Race Tour at venues in Denver (May 5/14), Miami (5/20), Dallas (5/26), Los Angeles (6/3), Boston (6/8), Philadelphia (6/10), San Francisco (6/15) and Chicago (6/16). Visit http://LogoTV.com for tour locations and details.
