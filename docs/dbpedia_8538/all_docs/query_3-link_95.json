        "text": "The pyloric sphincter serves as a kind of gateway between the stomach and the small intestine. It allows the contents of the stomach to pass into the small intestine. It also prevents partially digested food and digestive juices from reentering the stomach.\n\nThe lower parts of the stomach contract in waves (called peristalsis) that help to mechanically break down food and mix it with digestive juices. This mixture of food and digestive juices is called chyme. The force of these contractions increases in the lower parts of the stomach. With each wave, the pyloric sphincter opens and allows a little bit of chyme to pass into the duodenum.\n\nAs the duodenum fills, it puts pressure on the pyloric sphincter, causing it to close. The duodenum then uses peristalsis to move the chyme through the rest of the small intestine. Once the duodenum is empty, pressure on the pyloric sphincter goes away, allowing it to open again.\n\nBile reflux\n\nBile reflux happens when bile backs up into the stomach or esophagus. Bile is a digestive liquid made in the liver that’s usually found in the small intestine. When the pyloric sphincter doesn’t work properly, bile can make its way up the digestive tract.\n\nThe symptoms of bile reflux are very similar to those of acid reflux and include:\n\nupper abdominal pain\n\nheartburn\n\nnausea\n\ngreen or yellow vomit\n\ncough\n\nunexplained weight loss\n\nMost cases of bile reflux respond well to medications, such as proton pump inhibitors, and surgeries used to treat acid reflux and GERD.\n\nPyloric stenosis\n\nPyloric stenosis is a condition in infants that blocks food from entering the small intestine. It’s an uncommon condition that tends to run in families. Around 15% of infants with pyloric stenosis have a family history of pyloric stenosis.\n\nPyloric stenosis involves a thickening of the pylorus, which prevents chyme from passing through the pyloric sphincter.\n\nSymptoms of pyloric stenosis include:\n\nforceful vomiting after feeding\n\nhunger after vomiting\n\ndehydration\n\nsmall stools or constipation\n\nweight loss or problems gaining weight\n\ncontractions or ripples across the stomach after feeding\n\nirritability\n\nPyloric stenosis requires surgery to create a new channel that allows chyme to pass into the small intestine.\n\nGastroparesis\n\nGastroparesis prevents the stomach from properly emptying. In people with this condition, the wave-like contractions that move chyme through the digestive system are weaker.\n\nSymptoms of gastroparesis include:\n\nnausea\n\nvomiting, especially of undigested food after eating\n\nabdominal pain or bloating\n\nacid reflux\n\nsensation of fullness after eating small amounts\n\nfluctuations in blood sugar\n\npoor appetite\n\nweight loss\n\nIn addition, certain medications, such as opioid pain relievers, can make symptoms worse.\n\nThere are several treatment options for gastroparesis, depending on the severity:\n\ndietary changes, such as eating several smaller meals per day or eating softer foods\n\ncontrolling blood glucose levels, either with medication or lifestyle changes\n\ntube feeding or intravenous nutrients to make sure the body gets enough calories and nutrients"
