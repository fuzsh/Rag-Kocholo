The esophagus is about 8 inches.\"— Presentation transcript:\n\n1\n\n2 Digestive System BY:\n\n3 jjj\n\n4 Esophagus The esophagus is a muscular tube connecting the throat pharynx with the stomach. The esophagus is about 8 inches long, and is lined by moist pink tissue called mucosa. The esophagus runs behind the windpipe trachea and heart, and in front of the spine. Just before entering the stomach, the esophagus passes through the diaphragm.\n\n5 Stomach The stomach is a muscular hollow, dilated part of the Digestion System which Orgon functions as an important of the digestive tract in some animals including vertebrates echinoderms insects mid-gut and molluscs. It is involved in the second phase of digestion following mastication chewing.\n\n6 Small Intestine The intestines are a long continuous tube running from the stomach to the anus. Most absorption of nutrients and water happen in the intestines. The intestines include the small intestine large intestine, and rectum. The small intestine small bowel is about 20 feet long and about an inch in diameter. Its job is to absorb most of the nutrients from what we eat and drink. Velvety tissue lines the small intestine, which is divided into the duodenum Jejunum and Ileum.\n\n7 Large Intestine The mucosa of the large intestine is punctuated with numerous crypts that absorb water and are lined with mucus secreting goblet cells. At the lower end of the rectum the circular and longitudinal muscle layers terminate in the internal and external anal sphincters.\n\n8 Liver The liver is a large meaty organ that sits on the right side of the belly. Weighing about 3 pounds the liver is reddish brown in color and feels rubbery to the touch. Normally you can't feel the liver because it's protected by the rib cage. The liver has two large sections, called the right and the left lobes. The gallbladder sits under the liver along with parts of the pancreas and intestines. The liver and these organs work together to digest absorb, and process food.\n\n9 Appendix The appendix sits at the junction of the small intestine and large intestine. It’s a thin tube about four inches long. Normally the appendix sits in the lower right abdomen.\n\n10 Pancreas\n\n11 Gall Bladder\n\n12 Enzymes.\n\n13 Bile/ Bile Duct\n\n14 Mucus Mucus is a germy not like healthy thing\n\n15 Chemical Digestion\n\n16 Absorption\n\n17 Mechanical Digestion\n\n18 Salivary Amylase\n\n19 Villi\n\n20 Gastric Juices\n\n21 Duodenum\n\n22 Chyme The Chyme\n\n23 Bibliography What is the human Mouth /what is the human Esophagus/ what is the human Large Intestine/ what is the human Small Intestine/ what is the human Stomach/ what is the human Liver/ what is the human Appendix/ what is the human Pancreas/ what is the human Gall Bladder/ what is the human Enzymes/ what is the human Bile/ Bile Duct/ what is the human Mucus/ what is the human Chemical Digestion/ what is the human Absorption / what is the human Mechanical Digestion/ what is the human Salivary Amylase/ what is the human Villi/ what is the human Gastric Juices/ what is the human Duodenum/ what is the human Chyme.What is the human Mouth /what is the human Esophagus/ what is the human Large Intestine/ what is the human Small Intestine/ what is the human Stomach/ what is the human Liver/ what is the human Appendix/ what is the human Pancreas/ what is the human Gall Bladder/ what is the human Enzymes/ what is the human Bile/ Bile Duct/ what is the human Mucus/ what is the human Chemical Digestion/ what is the human Absorption / what is the human Mechanical Digestion/ what is the human Salivary Amylase/ what is the human Villi/ what is the human Gastric Juices/ what is the human Duodenum/ what is the human Chyme."
