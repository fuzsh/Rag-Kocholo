        "text": "156 Phases of Digestion\n\nCephalic Phase\n\nThe cephalic phase of gastric secretion occurs before food enters the stomach due to neurological signals.\n\nLearning Objectives\n\nOutline the cephalic phase of digestion\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nKey Points\n\nThe cephalic phase of gastric secretion is initiated by the sight, smell, thought or taste of food.\n\nNeurological signals originate from the cerebral cortex and in the appetite centers of the amygdala and hypothalamus.\n\nThis enhanced secretory activity is a conditioned reflex.\n\nThis phase of secretion normally accounts for about 20 percent of the gastric secretion associated with eating a meal.\n\nKey Terms\n\nconditioned reflex: A response, to a stimulus, that has been acquired by operant conditioning.\n\ncephalic phase: This occurs before food enters the stomach, especially while it is being eaten.\n\nThe cephalic phase of gastric secretion occurs before food enters the stomach, especially while it is being eaten. It results from the sight, smell, thought, or taste of food; and the greater the appetite, the more intense is the stimulation.\n\nNeurogenic signals that initiate the cephalic phase of gastric secretion originate from the cerebral cortex, and in the appetite centers of the amygdala and hypothalamus. They are transmitted through the dorsal motor nuclei of the vagi, and then through the vagus nerve to the stomach.\n\nThis phase of secretion normally accounts for about 20% of the gastric secretions that are associated with eating a meal. Since this enhanced secretory activity is brought on by the thought or sight of food it is a conditioned reflex—it only occurs when we like or want food. When one’s appetite is depressed this part of the cephalic reflex is inhibited.\n\nThe cephalic phase causes ECL cells to secrete histamine and increase HCl acid in the stomach. There will also be an influence on G cells to increase gastrin circulation.\n\nChain of Events for the Nervous System and Hormone System\n\nThinking of food (i.e., smell, sight) stimulates the cerebral cortex.\n\nThe cerebral cortex sends messages to the hypothalamus, the medulla, and the parasympathetic nervous system via the vagus nerve, and to the stomach via the gastric glands in the walls of the fundus and the body of stomach.\n\nThe gastric glands secrete gastric juice.\n\nWhen food enters the stomach, the stomach stretches and activates stretch receptors.\n\nThe stretch receptors send a message to the medulla and then back to the stomach via the vagus nerve.\n\nThe gastric glands secrete more gastric juice.\n\nChemical stimuli (i.e., partially digested proteins, caffeine) directly activate G cells (enteroendocrine cells) that are located in the pyloric region of the stomach to secrete gastrin; this in turn stimulates the gastric glands to secrete gastric juice.\n\nGastric Phase\n\nThe gastric phase is a period in which swallowed food activates gastric activity in the stomach.\n\nLearning Objectives\n\nOutline the gastric phase of digestion\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nKey Points\n\nThe gastric phase accounts for about two-thirds of gastric secretions.\n\nIngested food stimulates gastric activity by stretching the stomach and raising the pH of its contents; this causes a cascade of events that leads to the release of hydrochloric acid by the parietal cells that lower the pH and break apart the food.\n\nGastric secretion is stimulated chiefly by three chemicals: acetylcholine (ACh), histamine, and gastrin.\n\nBelow pH of 2, stomach acid inhibits the parietal cells and G cells; this is a negative feedback loop that winds down the gastric phase as the need for pepsin and HCl declines.\n\nKey Terms\n\ngastric phase: The second phase of digestion that follows mastication (chewing) and takes place in the stomach.\n\nThe gastric phase is a period in which swallowed food and semi-digested protein ( peptides and amino acids ) activate gastric activity. About two-thirds of gastric secretion occurs during this phase.\n\nIngested food stimulates gastric activity in two ways: by stretching the stomach and by raising the pH of its contents.\n\nStretching activates two reflexes: a short reflex is mediated through the myenteric nerve plexus; and a long reflex is mediated through the vagus nerves and brainstem.\n\nGastric Secretion\n\nGastric secretion is stimulated chiefly by three chemicals:\n\nAcetylcholine (ACh). This is secreted by the parasympathetic nerve fibers of both the short and long reflex pathways.\n\nHistamine. This is a paracrine secretion from the enteroendocrine cells in the gastric glands.\n\nGastrin. This is a hormone produced by enteroendocrine G cells in the pyloric glands.\n\nAll three of these stimulate parietal cells to secrete hydrochloric acid and intrinsic factor. The chief cells secrete pepsinogen in response to gastrin and especially ACh, and ACh also stimulates mucus secretion.\n\nAs dietary protein is digested, it breaks down into smaller peptides and amino acids that directly stimulate the G cells to secrete even more gastrin: this is a positive feedback loop that accelerates protein digestion.\n\nSmall peptides also buffer the stomach acid so the pH does not fall excessively low. As digestion continues and these peptides empty from the stomach, the pH drops lower and lower. Below pH of 2, stomach acid inhibits the parietal cells and G cells: this is a negative feedback loop that winds down the gastric phase as the need for pepsin and HCl declines.\n\nIntestinal Phase\n\nThe intestinal phase occurs in the duodenum as a response to the arriving chyme, and it moderates gastric activity via hormones and nervous reflexes.\n\nLearning Objectives\n\nOutline the intestinal phase of digestion\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nKey Points\n\nStretching of the duodenum (the first segment of the small intestine ) enhances gastric function via the vagal nerve, as the chyme causes the secretion of gastrin, which stimulates the stomach.\n\nThe acid and semi-digested fats in the duodenum trigger the enterogastric reflex: the duodenum sends inhibitory signals to the stomach by way of the enteric nervous system.\n\nThe newly arrived chyme also stimulates enteroendocrine cells of the intestine to release compounds that stimulate the pancreas and gall bladder, while also suppressing gastric secretion and motility to allow the duodenum to process the chyme before receiving more from the stomach.\n\nKey Terms\n\nchyme: The thick, semifluid mass of partly digested food that is passed from the stomach to the duodenum.\n\nenterogastric reflex: One of three extrinsic reflexes of the gastrointestinal tract that is stimulated by the presence of acid levels in the duodenum or in the stomach that cause the release of gastrin from the G cells in the antrum of the stomach.\n\nenteroendocrine cells: Specialized endocrine cells of the gastrointestinal tract that produce hormones such as serotonin, somatostatin, motilin, cholecystokinin, gastric inhibitory peptide, neurotensin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, and enteroglucagon.\n\nExamples\n\nIndividuals with diabetes have a higher probability of suffering from delayed clearance of chyme from the duodenum. This slows down the full digestive process and could eventually necessitate medical intervention.\n\nThe intestinal phase occurs in the duodenum as a response to the arriving chyme, and it moderates gastric activity via hormones and nervous reflexes. The duodenum initially enhances gastric secretion, but soon inhibits it. The stretching of the duodenum accentuates vagal reflexes that stimulate the stomach, and peptides and amino acids in the chyme stimulate the G cells of the duodenum to secrete more gastrin, which further stimulates the stomach.\n\nSoon, however, the acid and semi-digested fats in the duodenum trigger the enterogastric reflex. That is, the duodenum sends inhibitory signals to the stomach by way of the enteric nervous system, while also sending signals to the medulla that inhibit the vagal nuclei. This reduces vagal stimulation of the stomach and stimulates sympathetic neurons that send inhibitory signals to the stomach.\n\nChyme\n\nChyme also stimulates duodenal enteroendocrine cells to release secretin and cholecystokinin. These hormones primarily stimulate the pancreas and gallbladder, but they also suppress gastric secretion and motility. The effect of this is that gastrin secretion declines and the pyloric sphincter contracts tightly to limit the admission of more chyme into the duodenum. This gives the duodenum time to work on the chyme it has received before being loaded with more.\n\nThe enteroendocrine cells also secrete glucose -dependent insulinotropic peptide. Originally called gastric-inhibitory peptide, it is no longer thought to have a significant effect on the stomach. Rather, it probably stimulates insulin secretion in preparation for processing the nutrients that are about to be absorbed by the small intestine.\n\nHormones of the Digestive System\n\nThere are five main hormones that aid and regulate the digestive system in mammals.\n\nLearning Objectives\n\nDifferentiate among the hormones of the digestive system\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nKey Points\n\nThe five major hormones are: gastrin ( stomach ), secretin ( small intestine ), cholecytokinin (small intestine), gastric inhibitory peptide (small intestine), and motilin (small intestine).\n\nGastrin is in the stomach and stimulates the gastric glands to secrete pepsinogen (an inactive form of the enzyme pepsin) and hydrochloric acid. The secretion of gastrin is stimulated by food arriving in the stomach.\n\nSecretin is in the duodenum and signals the secretion of sodium bicarbonate in the pancreas and it stimulates the secretion of bile in the liver.\n\nCholecystokinin (CCK) is in the duodenum and stimulates the release of digestive enzymes in the pancreas and the emptying of bile from the gall bladder.\n\nGastric inhibitory peptide (GIP) is in the duodenum and decreases the stomach churning in order to slow the emptying of the stomach.\n\nMotilin is in the duodenum and increases the migrating myoelectric complex component of gastrointestinal motility and stimulates the production of pepsin.\n\nKey Terms\n\nmotilin: A polypeptide that has a role in fat metabolism.\n\ngastrin: A hormone that stimulates the production of gastric acid in the stomach.\n\nsecretin: A peptide hormone secreted by the duodenum that serves to regulate its acidity.\n\nThere are five main hormones that aid in regulation of the digestive system in mammals. There are variations across the vertebrates, such as birds, so arrangements are complex and additional details are regularly discovered. For instance, more connections to metabolic control (largely the glucose – insulin system) have been uncovered in recent years.\n\nGastrin is in the stomach and stimulates the gastric glands to secrete pepsinogen (an inactive form of the enzyme pepsin) and hydrochloric acid. The secretion of gastrin is stimulated by food arriving in the stomach. The secretion is inhibited by low pH.\n\nSecretin is in the duodenum and signals the secretion of sodium bicarbonate in the pancreas and it stimulates the secretion of bile in the liver. This hormone responds to the acidity of the chyme.\n\nCholecystokinin (CCK) is in the duodenum and stimulates the release of digestive enzymes in the pancreas and stimulates the emptying of bile in the gallbladder. This hormone is secreted in response to the fat in chyme.\n\nGastric inhibitory peptide (GIP) is in the duodenum and decreases stomach churning in order to slow the emptying of the stomach. Another function is to induce insulin secretion.\n\nMotilin is in the duodenum and increases the migrating myoelectric complex component of gastrointestinal motility and stimulates the production of pepsin.\n\nAppetite-Regulating Hormones\n\nThere are hormones secreted by tissues and organs in the body that are transported through the bloodstream to the satiety center, a region in the brain that triggers impulses that give us feelings of hunger or aid in suppressing our appetite. Ghrelin is a hormone that is released by the stomach and targets the pituitary gland, signaling to the body that it needs to eat.\n\nPYY is a hormone that is released by the small intestine to counter ghrelin. It is released by the hypothalamus and signals that you have just eaten and helps to suppress our appetite.\n\nThe pancreas releases the hormone insulin that targets the hypothalamus and also aids in suppressing our appetite after we have just eaten and there is a rise in blood glucose levels.\n\nThe last hormone is leptin, which also helps to suppress appetite. Leptin is produced by adipose fat tissue and targets the hypothalamus."
