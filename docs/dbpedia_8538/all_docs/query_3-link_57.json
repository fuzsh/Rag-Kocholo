        "text": "Digestion is the breaking down of the food we eat into other substances that our bodies can absorb and use.There are mechanical and chemical digestive processes.Mechanical digestion includes:\n\nchewing in the mouth with the teeth.\n\nchurning in the stomach.\n\nWithout digestion, we could not absorb food into our bodies and use it.Digestion happens in the digestive system, which begins at the mouth and ends at the anus.\n\nFood enters the digestive system through the mouth. This process is called ingestion. Once in the mouth, the food is chewed to form a ball of food called a bolus. This passes down the oesophagus and into the stomach.\n\nPeristalsis\n\nFood is moved through the digestive system by a process called peristalsis. Two sets of muscles in the gut wall are involved\n\nThey work together to produce wave-like contractions. These have a âsqueezing actionâ that pushes the bolus through the digestive system.\n\nOur teeth break food down into small pieces when we chew. This is only a start to the process of digestion, as chewed pieces of food are still too large to be absorbed by the body. Food has to be broken down chemically into really small particles before it can be absorbed. This is called chemical digestion.\n\nEnzymes\n\nEnzymes are chemicals which help to speed up the breakdown of large food molecules.\n\nEnzymes are not living things. They are just special proteins that can break large molecules into small molecules. Different types of enzymes can break down different nutrients:\n\namylase and other carbohydrase enzymes break down carbohydrates into sugar e.g. starch into glucose.\n\nprotease enzymes break down proteins into amino acids.\n\nlipase enzymes break down lipids (fats and oils) into fatty acids and glycerol.\n\nThe saliva in your mouth contains amylase, which is another starch digesting enzyme. If you chew a piece of bread for long enough (about 60 seconds), the starch it contains is digested to sugar, and it begins to taste sweet.\n\nProteins\n\nProteins are digested in the stomach and small intestine. Protease enzymes break down proteins into amino acids. Digestion of proteins in the stomach is helped by stomach acid, which is strong hydrochloric acid. This also kills harmful microorganisms that may be in the food.\n\nLipids (fats and oils)\n\nLipase enzymes break down fat into fatty acids and glycerol. Digestion of fat in the small intestine is helped by bile, made in the liver. Bile breaks the fat into small droplets that are easier for the lipase enzymes to work on. Bile is not an enzyme.\n\nSubstances that are not digested\n\nMinerals, vitamins and water are already small enough to be absorbed by the body without being broken down, so they are not digested.Digestive enzymes cannot break down dietary fibre, which is why the body cannot absorb it.\n\nDigested food molecules are absorbed in the small intestine. This means that they pass through the wall of the small intestine and into our bloodstream. Once there, the digested food molecules are carried around the body to where they are needed.\n\nOnly small, soluble substances can pass across the wall of the small intestine. Large insoluble substances cannot pass through. The slideshow shows how this happens:\n\nIf the small intestine had a thick wall and a small surface area, a lot of digested food might pass out of the body before it had a chance to be absorbed.\n\nThe villi (one of them is called a villus) stick out of the inside surface of the small intestine and give a big surface area. They also contain blood capillaries to carry away the absorbed food molecules.\n\nExcess water is absorbed back into the body in the large intestine. What is left then is undigested food. This is stored in the rectum, the lower part of the large intestine, until we are ready to go to the toilet. It then comes out of the rectum through the anus as faeces.\n\nThe process of passing out the remains of food that has not been digested, as faeces, through the anus is called egestion.\n\nTake care not to confuse egestion (removal of undigested food from the body) with excretion (removal of waste products from chemical reactions from the body).\n\nAim of the experimentTo use Visking tubing to model the digestive system and show what substances can pass through its lining.\n\nVisking tubing is a material that has very small holes. The holes are so small that large molecules, such as starch, cannot pass through. However, small molecules like water or glucose are small enough to diffuse through.\n\nHow much dietary fibre do I need?\n\nThe recommended daily intake of fibre varies with age:\n\n11 to 16 year olds â 25g per day\n\n16 year olds and above â 30g per day\n\nA diet that is high in fibre can help to reduce hunger and help you to feel fuller for longer."
