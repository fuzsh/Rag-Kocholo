        "text": "Digestive enzymes play a key role in breaking down the food you eat. These proteins speed up chemical reactions that turn nutrients into substances that your digestive tract can absorb.\n\nYour saliva has digestive enzymes in it. Some of your organs, including your pancreas, gallbladder, and liver, also release them. Cells on the surface of your intestines store them, too.\n\nDifferent types of enzymes target different nutrients:\n\nAmylase breaks down carbs and starches\n\nProtease works on proteins\n\nLipase handles fats\n\nSome digestive disorders prevent your body from making enough enzymes, such as:\n\nLactose intolerance. This is when your small intestine doesn't make enough of the enzyme lactase, which breaks down the natural sugar in milk called lactose. With a shortage of lactase, lactose in dairy products that you eat travels straight to your colon instead of getting absorbed into your body. It then combines with bacteria and causes uncomfortable stomach symptoms.\n\nThere are three kinds of lactose intolerance:\n\nPrimary. You are born with a gene that makes you lactose intolerant. The gene is most common in people of African, Asian, or Hispanic background. Your lactase levels drop suddenly as a child. Then you're no longer able to digest dairy as easily. This is the most common type of lactose intolerance.\n\nSecondary. Your small intestine makes less lactase after an illness, injury, or surgery. It can also be a symptom of both celiac disease and Crohn's disease.\n\nCongenital or developmental. From the time you are born, your body doesn't make lactase. This is rare. You have to inherit the gene for this from both your mother and father.\n\nPeople with lactose intolerance need to move their bowels a lot and have gas and bloating after eating or drinking dairy products like milk and ice cream. Some people can manage symptoms by eating smaller amounts of dairy. Others avoid dairy completely or choose lactose-free foods and drinks.\n\nExocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI). This can happen when another condition damages the pancreas. Common causes of EPI include:\n\nPancreatitis, or inflammation of the pancreas\n\nPancreatic cancer, which starts in the tissues of your pancreas\n\nCystic fibrosis, a genetic condition that damages the lungs, digestive system, and other organs\n\nTo treat EPI, your doctor may suggest lifestyle changes, such as:\n\nIf you smoke, quit\n\nAvoid drinking alcohol\n\nEat a low-fat diet\n\nTake vitamin and mineral pills\n\nPrescription medicine may also improve your symptoms.\n\nAlways talk to your doctor before trying any kind of supplement. More research is needed to study how safe they are and how well they work. But over-the-counter lactase supplements help many people with lactose intolerance, and there is a supplement that seems to help people digest the sugars that are in beans.\n\nExperts do not recommend lactase supplements for children under age 4. Also, talk to your doctor about the pros and cons if you're pregnant or breastfeeding.\n\nRight now, most enzyme products are animal-based. Researchers predict that plant and bacteria-based products could be more common in the future."
