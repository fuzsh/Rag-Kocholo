This checks the secretion of gastric juice before the content becomes sufficiently corrosive to damage the mucosa. Pure gastric juice can destroy the mucosa and produce a peptic ulcer. An ulcer forms when gastric secretion is stimulated by agencies other than food and when its buffering effect is absent or inadequate."
