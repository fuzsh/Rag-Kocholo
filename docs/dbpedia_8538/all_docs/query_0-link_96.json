XII. Now you are familiar to the subject of Biology as a separate discipline in standard XI. You have already been acquainted with many concepts of Biological Sciences from Standard six onwards, especially in the subject of General Science up to standard Eight and Science and Technology for standard Nine and Ten. This textbook aims to create awareness about the biological sciences specially Botany, Zoology and allied aspects of biological sciences. The National Curriculum Framework (NCF) was formulated in 2005, followed by the State Curriculum Framework (SCF) in 2010. Based on the given these two frameworks, reconstruction of the curriculum and preparation of a revised syllabus has been undertaken which will be introduced from the academic year 2019-20. The textbook incorporating the revised syllabus has been prepared and designed by the Maharashtra State Bureau of Textbook Production and Curriculum Research, (Balbharati), Pune. The subject biology intends to give students understanding, and appreciation of the vast diversity of living beings, their special adaptations to their environments and evolutionary relationships. No compromise is made in any manner over the use of language in the Biology context, but at the same time, the textbook is presented in a simple licid language. In addition, relevant diagrams, graphs, tables used in the textbook will bring about more clarity in the understanding of various terminologies and biological concepts. All the illustrations are in colour form. This will surely enable students to understand various concepts of botany and zoology thoroughly and correlate this with their day-to-day practical life. The new syllabus focuses on the conceptual principles of overall life processes, its understanding, and application in day-to-day life and ability to solve different upcoming problems and issues like inheritance and its significance, conservation; different diseases and remedies, the application of technology, etc. The general teaching-learning objectives of the revised syllabus are further determined based on the âprinciple of constructivismâ i.e. self-learning. The curriculum and syllabus confirms to the maxims of teaching such as moving from concrete to abstract, known to unknown and from part to whole. For the first time, in the syllabus of biology various independent activities have been introduced. These activities will not only help to understand the content knowledge but also provide scope for gaining relevant and additional application based knowledge on your own efforts. Q. R. Code have been introduced for gaining the additional information, abstracts of chapters and practice questions/ activities. The efforts taken to prepare the textbook will not only enrich the meaningful learning experience of the students, but also benefit other stakeholders such as teachers, parents as well as those aspiring candidates preparing for the competitive examinations. We look forward to a positive response from the teachers and students. Our best wishes to all!

The sperms swim at the uterus. an average speed of 1.5 to 3.0 mm/min. Extracellular space Sperm nucleus Sperms reach upto the ampulla as a result of Corona radiata 1. After the sperm their own swimming and partly by contraction Zona pellucida penetrates the secondary of uterus and fallopian tubes stimulated by Second meiotic oocyte, the oocyte oxytocin of female. After capacitation the completes meiosis II, sperms may reach ampulla within 5 minutes. division of oocyte forming the ovum and Sperms can remain viable for 24-48 hours Second meiotic second polar body. (Ovum for about 24 hours). division of first 2. Sperm and ovum Polar body nuclei swell, forming b. Entry of sperm into the egg : Out of 200 to Male pronucleus pronuclei. 400 million sperms, only few hundred manage Female pro-nucleus 3. Pronuclei approach to reach the ampulla. Though many sperms each other and mitotic reach the ampulla but only a single sperm (swollen ovum nucleus) spindle forms between fertilizes the ovum. A sperm after reaching Polar bodies them. the egg / ovum comes to lie against it. Its 4. Chromosomes acrosome releases lysins : hyaluronidase and Male pronucleus of both pronuclei corona penetrating enzymes. They separate Mitotic spindle intermix. Fertilization is and dissolve the cells of corona radiata, so the accomplished. sperm head passes through the zona pellucida Centriole of egg. The zona pellucida has fertilizin Female pronucleus receptor proteins (ZP3, ZP2). The fertilizin binds to specific acid protein- antifertilizin Zygote of sperm. It brings about attraction of sperms to the egg to enhance fertilization. Fertilizin- Fig. 2.13 : Process of Fertilization antifertilizin interaction is species specific. Thus, the fertilizin-antifertilizin reaction is also Mechanism of fertilization : called compatibility reaction. Semen released during ejaculation has sperms and some secretions. The coagulated semen now undergoes liquification and sperms become active. The mechanism of fertilization is as follows : a. Movement of sperm towards egg: "
