        "text": "The table shows the main structures and associated organs of the human alimentary canalThe digestive tract which runs from mouth to anus. (or gut), and their functions.\n\nFood is broken down into smaller pieces in the mouth by chewing. This is an example of mechanical digestion. The teeth cut and crush food, and the pieces are mixed with saliva to form a ball of food called a bolus. This is then swallowed and is carried down the oesophagus by peristalsis.\n\nFood is moved through the digestive system by a process called peristalsisWave-like muscular contractions in the smooth wall of the gut which move food through the alimentary canal.. The muscles in the oesophagus contract above the bolus to push food down the oesophagus.\n\nThe stomach produces hydrochloric acid. It kills many harmful micro-organismAnother name for a microbe. It is microscopic and is an organism, such as a virus or bacteria. that might have been swallowed along with the food. The enzymes in the stomach work best in acidCorrosive substance which has a pH lower than 7. Acidity is caused by a high concentration of hydrogen ions. conditions â at a low pH. Protein digestion starts here.\n\nAfter it has been in the stomach, food travels to the small intestine. The enzymes in the small intestine work best in alkalineHaving a pH greater than 7. conditions - but the food is acidic after being in the stomach. bileA substance produced in the liver. It emulsifies fats to prepare them for digestion. is a substance produced by the liver and stored in the gall bladder. It passes down the bile duct into the small intestine.\n\nThe small intestine is the region where digested food is absorbed. The small intestine has a large internal surface area for absorption to happen quickly and efficiently. This large surface area is due to the presence of many finger-like projections called villiFinger-like projections in the small intestine that provide a large surface area for the absorption of food.."
