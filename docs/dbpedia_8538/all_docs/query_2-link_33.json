        "text": "The digestive system\n\nThe digestive system runs from the mouth to the anus. It includes the stomach, the large and small bowel. In addition, several other organs, including the salivary glands, liver, gallbladder and pancreas. These other organs are called accessory organs, as they also play a role in digestion. The job of the digestive system is to turn food and fluids into the building blocks that the body needs to work well. To do this, it produces and uses a variety of enzymes and other substances that aid digestion. Digestion means breaking food down to smaller molecules (parts) to help them be taken into the body.\n\nOn average food moves through the digestive system in the following times:\n\n2 hours to pass through the stomach.\n\n2 hours to pass through the small bowel.\n\n20 hours through the large intestine and into the rectum.\n\nBut these are averages. It can take longer or shorter times for food to travel though. This is part of normal variation between people.\n\nThe length of the digestive tube from mouth to anus is 8 to 9 metres on average. Approximately seven litres of fluid are secreted by the digestive system and its accessory organs each day. When the system works correctly, food is broken down. This is so the nutrients can be absorbed into the body and unwanted products excreted. When one or more of the functions of the digestive system fail, symptoms and disease can develop.\n\nThere are many different processes which contribute to a healthy digestive system:\n\nIngestion (putting food in your mouth) and digesting food.\n\nMechanical digestion (chewing and food being mixed inside the digestive tract).\n\nChemical digestion (digestive enzymes and substances breaking food down).\n\nAbsorption (small molecules passing from digestive system into the body).\n\nMaking and passing poo (stool or faeces).\n\nKey components of the digestive system\n\nMouth\n\nThis is the beginning of the digestive tract. Food that is put into the mouth is broken down by chewing. This is called mechanical digestion. Various enzymes are secreted to help this breakdown. Saliva secreted in the mouth contains ‘salivary amylase’. This helps the digestion of carbohydrates to simple sugars. This is called chemical digestion.\n\nGullet (oesophagus)\n\nSwallowed food and liquid are transported from the mouth to the stomach. This is through a tube called the gullet. Food is pushed down the gullet by muscular waves. The passage of contents is also helped by sitting upright when eating.\n\nStomach\n\nThe stomach stores and mixes food and liquid. Churning and mixing motions happen due to muscle contractions which is also part of mechanical digestion. Chemical digestion also occurs in the stomach. Food is mixed with gastric juices and digestive enzymes which help to break down food into smaller components. Hydrochloric acid is released by cells in the stomach wall. This is a strong acid which helps enzymes work and kills some unwanted bacteria. The surface of the stomach is protected from the action of the acid by a layer of mucus. The stomach then slowly lets the mixed food and liquid out into the top of the small bowel.\n\nSmall Bowel (intestine)\n\nThe main function of the small intestine is absorption of nutrients and minerals. Most of digestion and absorption occurs in the small intestine. This includes the digestion of proteins, fats and carbohydrates, which are called macronutrients. Some vitamins and minerals are also absorbed in the small intestine. These are called micronutrients because only small amounts of them are needed for a healthy body. Co-ordinated contractions of the small bowel wall squeeze to move food through. This action is called peristalsis. These movements happen in a wave pattern travelling down from one section to the next. The contractions occur behind the food (bolus), pushing it through the digestive system.\n\nA balanced diet is essential for good health. Include a variety of foods from each group to achieve this. Starchy foods, vegetables, and fruit should make up the bulk of meals. They contain fibre, an important nutrient in a healthy diet. Fibre is important for good gut health and functioning. It also provides other benefits, such as a lower risk of developing heart disease, Type 2 diabetes, and bowel cancer.\n\nGreen Section – fruits and vegetables\n\nFruits and vegetables should be eaten regularly. At least five portions per day. A portion is either 80g, small handful or 2 to 3 tablespoons. You should aim for as much variety as you can. It also includes frozen and tinned options in natural juice. This might include mixed frozen fruit and vegetables for example.\n\nYellow section – starchy carbohydrates\n\nStarchy foods should be consumed regularly. Include one option per meal. Include wholegrain versions of bread, rice, oats and other grains.\n\nPink section – protein foods\n\nProtein foods such as beans and pulses are also good sources of fibre. This group also includes fish, eggs, and meat. The World Health Organisation recommends avoiding processed meat. Examples are such as sausages, ham, bacon, salami, and cured red meat. There is an increased risk of developing bowel cancer with these foods. Red meat should be limited to no more than three portions per week. A portion is 350-500g per portion – the size of a pack of cards. To avoid excess fat in the diet, choose lean meat or remove excess fat and the skin from chicken.\n\nBlue section – dairy foods\n\nDairy foods are rich in calcium, needed for healthy bones and teeth. It is recommended to have three servings a day from this food group.\n\nHigh-fibre foods\n\nHigh-fibre foods are beneficial. They have a lower glycaemic index. This index measures how fast foods cause blood sugar to rise after eating. There are different types of fibre. Each type behaves differently in your gut. Fibre types, such as cellulose, aid in stool size and passage, preventing constipation. Gut microbes digest prebiotics. This produces beneficial substances for gut health but can cause bloating. People respond differently to different fibre types. Many foods contain more than one type. Increase intake slowly to allow your gut to adjust. Guidelines recommend aiming for 30 grams of fibre a day for adults and adolescents aged 16-18 years.\n\nPurple section – fats and spreads\n\nOnly a small proportion of foods should be made up of foods high in fat.\n\nTo maintain a healthy diet and lifestyle, it is important to be aware of other factors. These are:\n\nMaintaining a fluid intake of around two litres per day.\n\nMonitor portion sizes. A meal rule of thumb is this: use a fist-sized of carbohydrate and a palm-sized of protein.\n\nMinimizing fizzy or sugary drinks. Limit fruit juice to a small glass (100ml).\n\nLimiting alcohol intake to no more than 14 units weekly.\n\nReducing intake of high fat and high sugar foods.\n\nAim for less than six grams of salt per day.\n\nEating at least two portions of fish per week. One choice should be oily fish. For example, salmon, mackerel, and trout are oily fish. You can also eat sardines, pilchards, kippers, or fresh tuna.\n\nReplace butter and lard with olive oil and vegetable oil. These are polyunsaturated or mono-unsaturated fats.\n\nCan a vegetarian diet be healthy?\n\nA balanced vegetarian diet can be healthy. The aim is to also to eat a variety of foods. For example, beans, lentils, pulses, cheese and eggs. These foods are good sources of protein. Vegans need to consider their diet carefully. A vegan diet excludes all animal products. If you are vegan, you should take a multivitamin. If you are struggling to eat a variety of foods, consult a dietitian. Your GP can refer you.\n\nIs a ‘clean diet’ healthy?\n\nMany people follow the popular trend of a ‘clean’ diet. They focus too much on foods considered good for health. They restrict their diet in other areas. But, it is crucial not to cut or remove needed food groups. This can cause malnutrition. It can also lead to long-term health problems. ‘Clean’ assumes that there are bad and good foods. Some people take this to the extreme. They may develop an eating disorder. It is called orthorexia. Orthorexia is an excessive focus on healthy food. It is best to avoid diets by unqualified influencers. Instead, eat a balanced diet and live a healthy lifestyle. This is best for ongoing health. All diets need research. This research ensures their effectiveness and safety. If you are concerned about disordered eating, ask your GP for help.\n\nDo I need to take vitamins or supplements?\n\nA healthy diet is key. It has a balance of vitamins and minerals. But supplements have no value for healthy people. They can cause side effects too. Vitamin D is an exception for UK residents. This is especially true in autumn and winter. The sun is not strong enough for skin to produce enough. The NHS recommends adults to take a vitamin D supplement. It should contain 10 micrograms/400IU. This is especially important during these months. Others who may need more vitamin D include:\n\nThose who cover up.\n\nPeople that live in care homes or shared accommodation.\n\nPeople who have darker skin. For example, people of African, African Caribbean, or South Asian descent.\n\nThose who were told by a doctor or dietitian to take it.\n\nFood monitoring – how and why?\n\nA food diary can help show where diet improvements are needed. You can track your food and drink for two weeks and one weekend. Check this against the Eatwell guide image. Then make improvements to your diet. This can help you eat more fibre. It can also help you eat less red and processed meat. Changes can improve your health.\n\nIf you have stomach problems or suspect food intolerance, keep a food and symptom diary. It can help find the problem food. Record the food and type of symptoms and timings. The same food type can cause symptoms one day and not the next. This could be because you have eaten more of it. Check the amount you eat too. Don’t change your diet without asking your GP. They may need you to eat specific foods for tests. An example is gluten for coeliac disease. Plus, don’t buy food intolerance tests, as they won’t show the problem. A dietitian can help you to identify food intolerances. Your GP can refer you to one."
