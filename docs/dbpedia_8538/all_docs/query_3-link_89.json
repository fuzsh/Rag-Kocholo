        "text": "What Are Some Causes of Gastrointestinal Issues During Pregnancy?\n\nWhile many gastrointestinal issues are very common, you may not have experienced any before becoming pregnant. Because they vary, the causes can vary as well. Some common causes or risk factors of gastrointestinal conditions during pregnancy can include:\n\nChanges in hormones\n\nGI motility disorders\n\nObesity\n\nCertain medications\n\nPoor diet\n\nThyroid disorders\n\nPhysical internal changes as the uterus grows\n\nLack of exercise or activity\n\nStress\n\nHistory of overusing laxatives\n\nTaking antacid medicines containing calcium or aluminum\n\nViral or bacterial infection\n\nFood intolerance or allergy\n\nHow Can Gastrointestinal Issues During Pregnancy Be Treated?\n\nGastrointestinal issues are common during pregnancy and, for the most part, do not cause a serious health risk. However, if you experience any symptoms, you should inform your doctor. He or she will be able to help you manage your symptoms, monitor you for worsening symptoms and determine if additional treatment is required. Different gastrointestinal issues respond to different treatments, so your doctor will be able to suggest the best option for you.\n\nMaking changes at home can also help you manage your symptoms. Some of these changes include:\n\nEat a healthy diet: Changing what, how often, and how much you eat can help manage or relieve your GI symptoms. Depending on your issue, you may need to increase the amount of fiber in your diet, avoid sugary, processed foods, or limit the amount of caffeine and dairy in your intake. Ask to speak with a registered dietitian to determine an individualized healthy eating plan that would most benefit you.\n\nDrink lots of fluids: Increase the amount of fluids you take in, including water, fruit juice and clear soups. Getting lots of fluids can help your digestion and keep your GI tract moving regularly. Certain GI issues can also cause you to become dehydrated, so taking in fluids is very important to avoid any additional health issues cause by dehydration.\n\nExercise: Regular exercise boosts blood circulation and brings more oxygen to organs, including the bowels, to help them move efficiently and smoothly. Aim for at least two and a half hours a week of moderate exercise, or 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week. Speak with your doctor to find the best workouts that would be safe and appropriate for you.\n\nMedication: If your GI symptoms are severe, persistent, or unmanageable with lifestyle modification, your doctor may prescribe medication, which may include antacids, digestive enzymes, antidiarrheals, GI stimulants, and antiemetics, among others. Your doctor will prescribe you the safest medication at the most appropriate dosage.\n\nWhen Should I see My Doctor for Gastrointestinal Issues During Pregnancy?\n\nEven if you experience only mild symptoms of gastrointestinal issues, it is important to inform your doctor. He or she can recommend the best methods to manage those symptoms and can then monitor you throughout your pregnancy for worsening symptoms.\n\nIf your symptoms are severe, become severe, and are persistent or prolonged, call your doctor right away. You should call your doctor and seek immediate medical care if you experience:\n\nVomiting blood\n\nBloody or black stools\n\nDramatic weight loss\n\nSevere discomfort that interferes with daily activities\n\nEpisodes of choking\n\nPain or difficulty when swallowing\n\nExtreme fatigue\n\nRelated Links"
