        "text": "We help treat symptoms commonly associated with intestinal motility disorders such as bloating, nausea, abdominal discomfort, weight loss, and diarrhea.\n\nTypes of Intestinal Motility Disorders\n\nThere are several types of motility disorders that can occur in the intestines:\n\nIntestinal pseudo-obstruction\n\nColonic inertia\n\nScleroderma\n\nIrritable bowel syndrome\n\nIntestinal amyloidosis\n\nSpinal Muscular Atrophy\n\nShort bowel syndrome\n\nLactose intolerance\n\nFructose intolerance\n\nSmall intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO)\n\nSmall intestinal fungal overgrowth\n\nMegacolon\n\nIntestinal Motility Procedures\n\nThe small intestine can be a challenging area of the body to see for clear diagnosis. New technology is changing the course of intestinal diagnoses, offering advanced measuring capability of the rate of gut transit time and muscle contractions through the small bowel.\n\nTo diagnose an intestinal motility disorder, our team might perform one or several of the following procedures:\n\nBacterial and Yeast/Fungal Overgrowth Test\n\nOvergrowth of bacteria in the small intestine is known as small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). It can cause symptoms such as:\n\nFatigue\n\nSudden onset of bloating\n\nDiarrhea\n\nExcessive flatulence\n\nNausea\n\nSince symptoms of SIBO overlap with other common digestive conditions such as gastroparesis and IBS, it's important to get a definitive diagnosis. SIBO can be associated with certain vitamin deficiencies and autoimmune conditions.\n\nTo check for SIBO, liquid is collected from your small intestine using a special tube that's inserted endoscopically into your duodenum (first part of your small intestine). This liquid is examined for excessive amounts of bacteria and fungus.\n\nSmartPill Wireless Motility Capsule\n\nThe SmartPill wireless motility capsule is a pill-sized sensor that is swallowed.\n\nIt measures:\n\nTemperature\n\npH\n\nPressure\n\nHow quickly the stomach empties\n\nHow quickly the small intestine and colon empty\n\nThe capsule transmits these measurements to a receiver you carry with you for five days. The test records and helps diagnose conditions including intestinal pseudo-obstruction, gastroparesis, colonic inertia, rapid gastric emptying and constipation.\n\nThere are several types of motility disorders that can occur in the stomach, such as gastroparesis and dumping syndrome. Under normal conditions, the stomach empties its contents at a controlled rate.\n\nBut in some people, the rate at which their stomach empties its contents into the small intestine is not normal.\n\nTypes of Gastric Motility Disorders\n\nOur team diagnoses and treats the following gastric (stomach) motility disorders:\n\n• Gastroparesis or delayed gastric emptying\n\n• Rapid gastric emptying (dumping syndrome)\n\n• Idiopathic vomiting\n\n• Functional dyspepsia\n\n• Cyclic vomiting syndrome\n\nGastric Motility Procedures\n\nTests used to diagnose a motility disorder of the stomach include:\n\nSmartPill Wireless Motility Capsule\n\nThe SmartPill wireless motility capsule is a pill-sized sensor that is swallowed.\n\nIt measures:\n\n• Temperature\n\n• pH\n\n• Pressure\n\n• How quickly the stomach empties\n\n• How quickly the small intestine and colon empty\n\nThe capsule transmits these measurements to a receiver you carry with you for five days. This test records and helps diagnose conditions including gastroparesis, colonic inertia, rapid gastric emptying and constipation.\n\nHelicobacter Pylori (H. Pylori) Testing\n\nH. pylori is a bacteria found in the stomach that can cause inflammation, peptic ulcers and even gastric cancer.\n\nChecking for H. pylori can be done with a blood antibody test, breath test, stool antigen test or stomach biopsy. Our team uses the noninvasive breath test.\n\nBreath Testing\n\nHydrogen and methane breath testing is a noninvasive diagnostic test that can help detect:\n\n• A food intolerance\n\n• Bacterial overgrowth\n\n• Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)\n\n• Fructose intolerance\n\n• Lactose intolerance\n\n• Constipation\n\nPelvic floor conditions impact both men and women. The pelvic floor refers to the connective tissues, nerves and muscles (e.g., sphincter muscles, puborectalis muscle) that support functions of the bladder and rectum; and the uterus and vagina in women.\n\nAlso see Urogynecology and Reconstructive Pelvic Surgery\n\nOur specialists provide comprehensive evaluation and care for pelvic floor disorders, such as fecal incontinence and constipation.\n\nTypes of Pelvic Floor Motility Disorders\n\nThe GI motility team diagnoses, treats and researches pelvic floor disorders such as:\n\nAnal fissure\n\nAnal sphincter dysfunction\n\nConstipation\n\nFecal incontinence\n\nHirschsprung's disease\n\nPoor or impaired rectal sensation\n\nStool leakage\n\nChagas disease\n\nScleroderma\n\nLevator ani syndrome\n\nPelvic Floor Procedures\n\nAnorectal Manometry:This procedure is used to evaluate conditions associated with constipation or fecal incontinence.\n\nBy inserting a thin tube containing many sensors into the rectum, this test assesses nerve and muscle function as well as the coordination and strength of the pelvic floor.\n\nBalloon Expulsion Test\n\nDuring anorectal manometry, a balloon expulsion test may be performed.\n\nWhat to expect:\n\nA thin tube with a balloon attached is inserted into the rectum.\n\nThe balloon is filled with water.\n\nThe patient is asked to expel the balloon into the toilet.\n\nThe length of time it takes to expel the balloon is recorded.\n\nElectromyography Testing\n\nThis procedure tests to see if the nerves that serve the anorectum are functioning normally. Similar to an EKG of your heart, electrodes are placed on the skin that painlessly record the electrical potentials produced by the nerves firing.\n\nPelvic Floor Disorder Treatment\n\nWith careful examination, and collaboration with colorectal surgeons, our specialists provide advanced diagnostics and comprehensive care for pelvic floor disorders.\n\nTreatment may include biofeedback therapy, tissue expander injection, motility medications and surgical treatment such as sacral nerve stimulator placement.\n\nGI Comprehensive Biofeedback Program\n\nBiofeedback therapy is an educational and physical therapy program occurring over several sessions. It is highly effective in helping patients retrain their pelvic floor muscles and regain control over their bodily functions.\n\nIn our physician-led program, you will be shown how to improve the strength and coordination of the muscles in the anorectum. Training will include instruction on breathing exercises and postural techniques, such as foot evaluation with the Squatty Potty system. Biofeedback is very safe and effective in relieving symptoms of incontinence and constipation."
