        "text": "The contractions of the circular and longitudinal muscles are regulated by electrical impulses that begin with the passage of calcium ions into the muscle cell. The duodenal pacemaker sends electrical impulses down the small intestine at a rate of 11 cycles per minute in the duodenum, gradually decreasing to 8 cycles per minute in the ileum. These electrical changes are propagated in the longitudinal muscle layer of the wall of the small intestine. Occurring simultaneously with the slow-wave electrical activity may be fast, spikelike electrical charges. This type of electrical activity originates in the circular muscle layer of the intestinal wall and occurs when the circular layer contracts to form a segmenting contraction. The depolarization of the muscle cell membranes, or an excess of positive charges on the inside of the cell, causes the myofibrils (the contracting components of the myofilaments that constitute the muscle tissues) to contract. The rate of these contractions is governed by the rate of depolarization of the muscle cell membrane. The two spiral muscle layers then contract, causing the motor activity that permits the mixing and transporting of the food in the small intestine.\n\nThe primary purposes of the movements of the small intestine are to provide mixing and transport of intraluminal contents. A characteristic of small intestine motility is the inherent ability of the smooth muscle constituting the wall of the intestine to contract spontaneously and rhythmically. This phenomenon is independent of any extrinsic nerve supply to the small intestine. In the myenteric plexus (a network of nerve fibres in the wall of the intestine), there are several other messenger substances and receptors capable of modulating smooth muscle activity, including somatostatin, serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine), and the enkephalins. With at least seven such substances in and around the smooth muscle, there is some confusion as to their respective roles. The contractions of the small intestine create pressure gradients from one adjacent segment of the organ to another. The pressure gradients, in turn, are primarily responsible for transport within the small intestine. Two types of motor activity have been recognized: segmenting contractions and peristaltic contractions.\n\nThe predominant motor action of the small intestine is the segmenting contraction, which is a localized circumferential contraction, principally of the circular muscle of the intestinal wall. Segmenting contractions mix, separate, and churn the intestinal chyme. The contraction involves only a short segment of the intestinal wall, less than 1 to 2 cm (about 1 inch), and constricts the lumen, tending to divide its contents. As the chyme moves from the duodenum to the ileum, there is a gradual decrease in the number of segmenting contractions. This has been described as the “gradient” of small intestine motility. Although segmenting contractions usually occur in an irregular manner, they can occur in a regular or rhythmic pattern and at a maximum rate for that particular site of the small intestine (rhythmic segmentation). Rhythmic segmentation may occur only in a localized segment of small intestine, or it may occur in a progressive manner, with each subsequent segmenting contraction occurring slightly below the preceding one (progressive segmentation).\n\nA peristaltic contraction may be defined as an advancing ring, or wave, of contraction that passes along a segment of the gastrointestinal tract. It normally occurs only over a short segment (approximately every 6 cm) and moves at a rate of about 1 or 2 cm per minute. This type of motor activity in the small intestine results in the transport of intraluminal contents downward, usually one segment at a time."
