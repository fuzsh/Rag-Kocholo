King Vidor directed longer then most, but Love Never Dies (1921) is not one he'll be remembered for. The plot is heavily contrived by model disasters to twist it's progress. At least there is some action even if it fails to convince much. What impression it does make is how handsome the leading couple were in their younger days, especially Lloyd Hughes being almost vibrant before he turned into one of the biggest stiffs in talkies.
