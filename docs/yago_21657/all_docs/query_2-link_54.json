        "text": "Love Never Dies continues the story of the Phantom Of The Opera, who has moved from his lair in the Paris Opera House to haunt the fairgrounds of Coney Island, far across the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nSet 10 years after the mysterious disappearance of the Phantom from Paris, Andrew Lloyd Webber’s new show is a rollercoaster ride of obsession and intrigue in which music and memory can play cruel tricks and the famous masked murderer sets out to prove that Love Never Dies.\n\nLove Never Dies stars Ramin Karimloo, who became London’s youngest Phantom when he took on the iconic role at Her Majesty’s theatre in 2007. The Iranian-born Canadian has also played Raoul in Lloyd Webber’s most famous musical and Christine’s Father in the Joel Schumacher-directed film adaptation.\n\nSierra Boggess, who plays Christine in Love Never Dies, also returns to a character she played in the original, having created the part for Phantom – The Las Vegas Spectacular.\n\nFor more about Love Never Dies at the Adelphi theatre, read the First Night Feature or the Big Interview with current Raoul, David Thaxton."
