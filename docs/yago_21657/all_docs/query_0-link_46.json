Many moviegoers find less-celebrated Vidor films among their most vivid memories—from The Champ to Ruby Gentry. Perhaps we may be forgiven for thinking that a full-length study of Vidor's work is astonishingly overdue—a situation for which we are not entirely blameless. A few words on our book's long genesis and its angle of approach: In 1973 Richard Corliss, editor of Film Comment, took the bold step of devoting most of two consecutive issues to a fifty-thousand-word study of eighteen King Vidor films by one of the authors of the present work, Raymond Durgnat.1 Restricted to Vidor's most readily available films, it was at once tentative, as a first reconnaissance; and digressionary, because it differed from many then-common assumptions: about how far movies are shaped by directorial self-expression, and how far by craftsmen working to a market consensus, by the studios, and by an everevolving public. In particular, it developed the work on structures of narrative form, meaning, and \"ideology\" in the last sections of Durgnat's Films and Feelings.1 Awkward and \"centrifugal\" as it was, however, the essay was accorded a gratifyingly generous reception. Its author's plans to return to it were thwarted partly by other pursuits and partly by irruptions in film theory. Academic film culture got knocked sideways by dogmas from radical politics; by paradigms hastily imported from, of all irrelevant fields, structural linguistics; by a semiotics clearly vii\n\nviii\n\nPreface\n\ninnocent of fifty years' w o r k in semantics; a n d by a clutch of youthfully aggressive feminisms. If the resultant emphasis on m e a n i n g as the p r o d uct of power relationships could be culturally very useful indeed, the penalty was a weirdly forced perspective, a n a l o g o u s to reading the history of democratic t h o u g h t as if its principal aim were the continued e n s e r f d o m of the reader. T h u s it's hardly surprising that certain feminist theorists (including those of the masculine gender) t o o k a further, richly m a s o chistic, step—resorting to Jacques Lacan, surely the most phallocentric figure in the history of those w h o m Freudians class as rogue psychoanalysts (and w h o s e notions of male desire and manliness rule o u t any possible u n d e r s t a n d i n g of King Vidor). M e a n w h i l e , Durgnat's collaboration with Scott S i m m o n on some studies of the Western film led to Vidor's Westerns a n d back to Vidor. ! S i m m o n drafted chapters on every other Vidor film e x t a n t in the United States a n d Britain, a n d revised the original text in the light of i n f o r m a l conversations with King Vidor and access to his papers. T h e new text m a d e m o r e transatlantic crossings t h a n w e ' d care to c o u n t , with each of us a d d i n g o n , hacking away, doodling polite a n d ornery marginalia. T h o u g h we've seld o m been less t h a n five t h o u s a n d miles a p a r t , there's n o sentence that doesn't bear the m a r k s of b o t h of us. T h e end result is less a revision by t w o heads of a b o o k by one t h a n a largely new w o r k . By a sort of a m o e b i c r e p r o d u c t i o n , the original w o r k has split into t w o halves, the \" a u t e u r i s t \" half having g r o w n into the present volume, the theoretical digressions being destined for a purer, m o r e sustained f o r m . T h e theoretical traditions u n d e r p i n n i n g Durgnat's original text remain vigorous, having acquired the merit of avoiding the p r o b l e m s that led a so-called \" s t r u c t u r a l i s m \" into the \" p o s t - s t r u c t u r a l i s t \" fetishization of a m biguity that emptied movies of authorial m e a n i n g a l t o g e t h e r — w h e r e a s we believe, on the contrary, that m u c h of art's interest for the reader lies in reaching the author's meaning. Ideally, the author's separate films f o r m one body of w o r k , with all its cross-correlations a n d cross-contradictions, on the basis of \"internal evidence\" within the films themselves, a n d not of \" t h e n a m e of the a u t h o r . \" If Vidor h a d n ' t existed, his films would m a k e it necessary to invent him. To that extent, we incline to the traditional linkage of \"life and w o r k s , \" with a pair of easy provisos: (1) that the life is germane only insofar as it s o m e h o w touches the w o r k s , so that (2) the w o r k s are devised less by the \" w h o l e m a n , \" neuroses and all, t h a n by his encounters with cultural a g e n d a s — i n this case, H o l l y w o o d ' s a n d America's. T h e movie \" a u t h o r \" is n o m o r e given to uninspected self-expression t h a n the poet. M o r e conspicuously (but not more radically) t h a n artists in m o r e \"individualistic\" media, he edits his o w n experience in view of\n\nPreface\n\nix\n\nwhat he shares with his target audience. His persona is not exactly a \"false self\" but a \"spokesman,\" constructed lucidly, frankly, in the light of what his \"unknown friends\" in the audience will find of interest. In other words, self-expression involves the artist in first censoring most of himself out—just as the traditional actor must assume a mask, to filter out \"noise\" from what he really is, most of which is normally irrelevant to his themes. It's curious how quickly certain critical schools treat artistic texts as if they were naive effusions of the self. If from time to time we call Vidor \"intuitive,\" it's in that rather technical sense in which a composer or a chess player performs his preconscious analyses on the basis of experience. Though we are interested in distinguishing what's unique to Vidor's films from what American films share, we're equally interested in what artists share with one another; and both interests have urged us to compare Vidor's perspectives and his topics with works by fellow artists and craftsmen. Vidor's films are also his audience thinking its ongoing experience through, not merely its repetitious \"myths,\" but its agenda of cultural problems. Had we but world enough and time, this book would move freely from Vidor's films to others, whether tracing a common genre, or cycle (a time-sliced slew of films), or mode (melodrama, comedy), or atmosphere (like film noir, in the sense of a mood shared across many genres). In practice, we've rested content to include just enough Hollywood patterns to establish Vidor's variations. An artist's themes can get lost among film lists and side issues, but the more common failure of auteurism is to imply, by omission, that one's subject is romantically original. However, an attraction of Vidor is the way he holds his own within two histories—of American social thought and of Hollywood filmmaking. In this respect, we're very traditional; the best auteurists, like Andrew Sarris, have delighted in explaining the similarities that establish a school or a culture, as well as the distinctions that establish the individual subject. Movie auteurism has regularly sacrificed negative criticism to romantic enthusiasm, as if the critic's principal role were to further his client's title to a place on Parnassus. For such \"enthusiasmism\" some historical justification exists (film's low status on the cultural totem pole). Alas, the reaction came. The Brechtians persuaded the Marxists, who persuaded many film theorists, that the key function of criticism was \"deconstruction,\" a wholesale skepticism—as if alienation from bourgeois art were a rare and prodigious feat, as if art and ideology somehow imprisoned the reader's judgment more firmly than straightjackets encased Houdini, and that long courses were required before your typical student could escape entrapment by discourse. To us, the problem has always seemed to lie not\n\nx\n\nPreface\n\nin criticizing a text but in reading it with such sympathy and rigor that one's criticisms apply to the text, not to some reductionist stereotype allegedly common to \"bourgeois ideology.\" After considerable hesitation, we decided to let this volume, short as it had to be, stress narrative and philosophy, rather than the mixtures of performance art and visual style that count for so much more in a film. It's partly a question of the gross inefficiencies of verbal language in relation to visual forms and their richness of meaning. Our experience increasingly teaches us that the detailed analysis of film in sequence can only be done in the presence of the film itself.* We hope, however, that sufficient traces of our approach to visual meaning remain (notably in discussing Our Daily Bread and An American Romance) to indicate how we derive meaning from visual form-as-style. As Vidor's films never quite cluster into standard genres, we have followed Vidor's production in loose chronology, shifting around a title here and there, and relegating a few minor works to annotations in the filmography. The auteur of this critical text likes to think that the differences between its two heads have generated a new synthesis, and that its outsider/insider perspective on the United States has been fruitful. We hope others will develop the work done here, in many, even contrasting, directions. King Vidor's work is too rich and teasing for any one book to be \"definitive\" about it.

The trade-off, familiar in film studies, is between productionstill sharpness and a necessarily hazier truth to the original image. Except as otherwise noted, the smaller (paired) photos are frame enlargements; the larger are production stills.\n\nxiii\n\n1 Introduction Vidor times Four\n\nA congressional medal struck after John Wayne's death has been jangling in our minds for some time. \"John Wayne, American,\" it reads—as if being a gutsy winner were certifiably the essence of the United States. Our title recasts the medal to honor diversity. Sure, King Vidor's sweep honors the American dream, that sometimes ferocious religion, but it also ascends to its higher, more ambivalent, forms. Critics during Hollywood's \"classic\" days were rightly severe about the spiritual rigidities of the studio system. But they often lost sight of veterans like Vidor, who never let Hollywood eclipse America. While the auteur theories of the 1960s corrected many injustices, they nonetheless cherished directorial consistency, not to say monotony, over diversity and intricacy, and found Vidor's very variety hard to handle. And wasn't there, also, a certain misogyny, or adolescent cult of toughness, in many auteurist selections (Hitchcock, Ford, Hawks, Walsh)? Generally, auteurists shared with genre theorists a preference for either hard-edge stoicism or soap-opera softness, a love of clear distinctions between men's and women's films (Hawks or Sirk, Ford or Cukor, Walsh or Minnelli). Until it became a \"politique,\" the auteurism of Cahiers du Cinéma was a fine, adventurous thing, alive to genre flexibilities, studio policies, the market, and the public. But it rapidly turned rigid. Whether through moviebuff affection for reliable craftsmen or through Marxist-structuralist notions of bourgeois ideology, too many auteurist studies treat some runof-the-mill assemblage of Hollywood clichés as a \"personal vision\" or as a \"structure\" constituted by \"the name of the author.\" More sweeping devaluations of art, as witness, would be hard to find. And they eclipse, 1\n\n2\n\nK i n g Vidor, A m e r i c a n\n\nabove all, the \"chameleons.\" Jean Renoir was almost the only exception, thanks to André Bazin, whose every reflex was nonauteurist, nongenrist. The narrow-angle lenses that film culture finds so congenial split Vidor into fragments. There's (1) the radical maverick of Our Daily Bread and The Crowd. There's (2) MGM's contract man, whose talent withers within its studio system. There's (3) the \"humanist\" of The Big Parade and Hallelujah. There's (4) the propagator of \"hysteric\" and \"delirious\" sexual struggles, leading off with Duel in the Sun and reaching a camp height in The Fountainhead and Beyond the Forest. Or then again: liberals had their Vidor, the socially conscious realist; French surrealists had their Vidor, the tempestuous subversive; middle-era Cahiers-ists had theirs, a muscular poet of elemental vigor. And we agree with them all— as far as they go. Vidor's own philosophy has conspired here. From The Jack-Knife Man through War and Peace, he accepted widely divergent, even opposite, moral attitudes as spiritual integrity. He celebrated that as \"relativism.\" His cinematic style can look no less inconsistent. Vidor # 1 , independently producing Our Daily Bread, refined \"Russian\" cutting, since he hadn't to fend off \"the over-ambitious editor or producer.\" Vidor # 2 devised what he called \"flowing composition\" that could only be used as shot, not cut up by some producer's editor.1 \"Contradictory\" styles! But one logic, one mind, one man. All these little Vidors cry out to be reassembled. The early, affirmative films link closely with his penultimate films noirs: as closely as aspiration with disillusion, confidence with tragic waste, thwarted energy with spectacular morbidity. It's tempting to reassemble the work in the way shared by the French right, ever quick to celebrate violent change, and by Marxist notions that bourgeois ideology is deconstructible by its concealed contradictions. By both logics, Vidor shrinks to an insular, schizophrenic mix of Will Rogers and Audie Murphy. And that is part of him: his smalltown goodwill remembers how to clench a cocked fist. But much more important is the mix of instinct and judgment that brought Vidor to that key crossroads—between idealism and aggression, between immigrant and nativist, between rural and urban life—where America knowingly picks all its crucial quarrels with itself. To borrow Manny Farber's distinction, Vidor's art is termite art; but he's a volatile termite. To be sure, a too-quick look at his epics could suggest white elephant art.2 Well, he hails from Texas. In certain art forms, genius has to be opportunistic. Begin by imagining Norman Mailer warbling Hank Williams . . . and vice versa. Vidor's forays into independent production—before, during, and after Hollywood—exemplify his ideals. And yet certain studio assignments, such as The Champ and Beyond the Forest, now look much closer to his\n\nI n t r o d u c t i o n : V i d o r t i m e s Four\n\n3\n\nsoul t h a n c o n t e m p o r a r y critics, including Vidor himself, assumed. N o d o u b t it was his hard luck to w o r k the studio system w h e n it was most rigidly an assembly line, and w h e n the Hays Office ensured a n a r r o w spiritual monopoly, a kind of screen theocracy. M a n y a promising director came to fit the studio cocoon so perfectly that f r e e d o m , w h e n they f o u n d it, seemed to bewilder them. Vidor zigzagged between gambles with his o w n cash, wrestling against the formulae, and flowing with the river. His films are American at heart whether or not they have H o l l y w o o d gloss on top. Whatever advantages Hollywood's standardized culture h a d , its usurpation of the older, grass-rootsier, American cinema was a cultural disaster. Vidor's wily and diverse career makes a first history of the survival of that other American c i n e m a — p o p u l i s t , rascally, and religious. To start with, let's divide his career into six main periods:\n\nFigure 1.\n\nVidor (center) and slateboard, in an unidentified Texas film (1914).\n\n1. Early Silents, 1913-1925. Following the dissolution of his tiny independent c o m p a n y in Texas, Vidor moved to H o l l y w o o d , w h e r e he peddled a few scripts, directed shorts, a n d (in 1919) m a d e his inspirationalist first feature, The Turn in the Road.

M o s t of this period's movies are only resourcefully executed samples of thenpopular cycles. The earlier and independently financed features have worn best, or, shall we say, become more picturesque. The dominant model was D. W. Griffith, and the locale is rural, midwestern or southern, with social pressures presented as minimal. The individual triumphs over himself, the villains functioning largely as catalysts of interior \"soul fights.\" Vidor's first inspiration was Christian Science, explicitly.\n\nFigure 2.\n\nVidor and an alter ego, James Murray, star of The Crowd (1928)\n\n2.

The keynote here is an optimistic view of the ordinary individual's spiritual survival, irrespective of worldly success, and of the adaptability of his \" r o o t s \" to a new family, or squad, or street, or moral community.\n\nIntroduction: Vidor times Four\n\nFigure 3.

The period from Hallelujah through the \"back-to-the-land\" trilogy of The Stranger's Return, Our Daily Bread, and The Wedding Night is predominantly \"populist,\" in both senses of that w o r d — t h e strictly political sense of the turnof-the-century radical agricultural movement and the looser filmhistory sense of a concern with the lower-middle classes. Populist hopes dominate even Billy the Kid and The Champ, but get disturbing qualifiers in Street Scene, Cynara, and The Wedding Night.\n\n6\n\nKing Vidor, A m e r i c a n\n\nFigure 4.\n\nOn location for The Texas Rangers (1936).\n\n4.

With the system's tightening grip everyw h e r e evident, it was his least personal, artistically weakest, a n d most spiritually confused.

Vidor's last t w o epics ( W a r and Peace, Solomon and Sheba) moved outside America, for their financing, their locations, their storylines, their themes, b u t are alm o s t the apotheosis of \" H o l l y w o o d \" style.

It's a spiritual education in itself to watch Duel in the Sun a n d Ruby Gentry a n d b r o o d over h o w Christian Science could get a r o u n d to this. King Vidor always responded to his times, while he f o l l o w e d — m o r e or less stealthily a n d alongside commercial calculations—a personal evolution that was never a betrayal.\n\n2 Hollywood versus America\n\n\"Vidor is far more an epic poet, given to large, almost abstract expressions of man's role in nature and society,\" writes Clive Denton, in one of the two short, interesting English-language studies of King Vidor. 1 Similarly the French: \" O n the name Vidor, cinema historians have once and for all stuck the label 'epic poet,'\" notes Etienne Chaumeton, whose dissatisfaction we share. 2 In film criticism \"epic poet\" still suggests a certain simplicity of message that Vidor's films, however powerful, never quite accept, even on first viewing. Is \"epic\" lyricism, a narrow fidelity to strong experience, artistically more valid than a structure sufficiently tensionriddled to undermine intense, obvious moods? This auteurist question still hasn't been resolved.3 Our operating aesthetic is that the most valuable works of art allow one neither just a pleasant wallow in one's favorite emotions nor just an intellectual diagram of some thematic circuitry. One example: William Wellman's The Public Enemy is built on contradictory ideas about violence, about ethnic and family life, and seems to us more interesting—and more moving—than Howard Hawks's Scarface, whose perfection of atmosphere goes along with a single-minded put-down of a scapegoat in place of more diversified corruption. Both partisans of lyricism (those who prefer the Hawks to the Wellman) and aesthetic structuralists (whose connections with the political left might have been expected to breed a preference for structures involving strong contradictions) tend to assume that ideas and emotions, ideology and lyricism, are separate realms rather than closely integrated ones. Vidor's own integration of those two poles is suggested by two of his reputations. On one hand, he was among Hollywood's resident intellec9\n\n10\n\nKing Vidor, American\n\ntuals, who subtitled a 1964 independent film \"An Introduction to Metaphysics.\" On the other, he was a neo-primitive prophet of sensuality and eroticism, ever ready to indulge his heroes' (or, more often, heroines') moral failings that arise from excesses of vitality. Still more schizo seems the gulf between the libidinous abandon of so many of Vidor's climaxes and the stream of gentle, almost pious, scruples of his autobiography.4 Oddly assorted, too, his democratic \"humanism\" before World War II and his noir-era adaptation of Ayn Rand. And while Vidor's contention that he \"always attempted to adhere to the 'earthier' themes\" hints at a link between the land-reform theorizing of Our Daily Bread and the Lust in the Dust of Duel in the Sun, the complications that rapidly appear are not just between films but within them, at their very core.5 Our sense is that both reputations are deserved. One does Vidor equal injustice by approaching him either as a purely transcendental thinker or as merely a kind of epic lyricist of sensuality, devoid of ideas. Vidor's deft manipulation of Hollywood entertainment patterns can disguise his bond to American thought. But, as he never tired of pointing out, his relationship to Hollywood was one thing, his relationship to his audience quite another. Some of the fun, we hope, in the following chapters comes from watching the ways in which Vidor's more personal themes have interacted with a sometimes profound, sometimes merely professional or playful, response to a variety of genres, cycles, and themes, as well as to Hollywood's constantly evolving collective iconography. Hollywood's set genres are like the stars and stripes—a hard-edged, stylized pattern that every American can stand up and salute. But the real American flag should be a patchwork quilt of subcultures where every thread, stripe, blotch, and patch of bare canvas jostles all the others as in a Jackson Pollock—something pretty and rich, but so disorderly that it hints at an early death. Vidor's films don't fit the critical categories. They relate to producers' categories, such as \"action film\" versus \"women's drama.\" But they rarely belong within them. Their characters are too mercurial, their space too open, their tone too restless; they never quite settle. We're left thinking about strains more than genres—the populist strain, the American regional strain, or the noir strain, crisscrossing within one story. The Hollywood movie is collaborative. That's its weakness, that's its strength. Vidor's producers usually set initial limits and determined the final cuts. Yet Vidor's copies of the scripts reveal just how much he wrote; and he almost always sat beside his editors. Such facts of production support our sense that his films are usually Vidor constructions, not just collective products branded with two or three characteristic \"touches.\" To be sure, our focus on Vidor himself risks the usual reduction of collaborators to puppets—as if the only paradigm for creativity were Svengali.\n\nHollywood versus America\n\n11\n\nN o r was Cahiers the only critical school to attribute a film's best ideas to whichever creator had so few that he kept repeating them. The problems dog our discussion of Duel in the Sun, Vidor's most troubled collaboration. His mid-thirties \"back-to-the-land trilogy\" proves instructive here. The three films share an identical motivating theme—city folk, faced with vanishing employment options, grab at a fresh agrarian start—filtered through a major studio (MGM's The Stranger's Return), an independent producer (Samuel Goldwyn's The Wedding Night), and King Vidor's own company (Viking's Our Daily Bread). Collaborators, we ourselves have learned in the course of producing this book, must share certain affinities if their various qualities are to \" t a k e , \" even against their wills. The oddity of Hollywood, as hermetically sealed against certain American realities as it is, is its capacity for anticipatory, swift, and almost collective responses to moods and themes in the American air—to, one might well say, changing ideology. W h a t first look like cases of auteurist obsession, or influence, or plagiarism, often turn out to be public property—themes and motifs that are a culture's iconography, beyond all possible copyrighting, legal or spiritual (for example, the affinities we note between Duel in the Sun and John Huston's The Unforgiven). Although \" H o l l y w o o d \" is definable as a homogeneous climate of opinion, it also unites different backgrounds, and the crisscrossings make collaborations as unpredictable as marriages. Certain pressures made Hollywood's agenda much narrower and more consensual than America's. The Production Code quite artificially curtailed shared themes and genres, slightly in 1924 and deeply in 1933. So did Hollywood's rightward bias, a more undercover affair, except, for example, in the movie campaign against Upton Sinclair in his bid for the California governorship, and the relatively easy success of blacklists. 6 Consider the gangster genre. M u c h in Vidor made him a \" n a t u r a l \" director of low-class violence on city streets. However, he never contributed to the genre, instead working all around it. Cagney as The Public Enemy (1931) may now seem a safely narrow focus for social criticism, more sop than substance. Yet much Hays Code ire was directed at The Public Enemy—ostensibly for its violence. Yet Vidor's Billy the Kid (1930) had just celebrated another serial killer, also Mom-fixated, without Hays Code objections. Presumably the gangster film's real offence was its contemporary city settings, which evoked contemporary social issues: slums, bootlegging, crooked and ineffectual cops. But if the gangster genre was one critical response to city poverty, Vidor's Our Daily Bread proposed another. Vidor's version of the Dead End Kids (the \"innocent delinquents\" in Wyler's Dead End, 1937) is in The Champ (1931). Its streetwise kid commits peccadilloes, not crimes, and quite enjoys his bad environment. We could posit some indirect suppression by the Production\n\n12\n\nKing Vidor, American\n\nCode, via its pressure on everybody, of a certain potential in Vidor's themes from the mid thirties through the war years. But, just as likely, Vidor censored himself. Until after World War II, and noir, when the underlying questions reemerge. When does energy become ferocity, or remorselessness amorality? When does one person's life force cannibalize another's? Vidor's Ruby Gentry (1952) ties those questions so fully into a socioeconomic structure that, as an American tragedy, it's arguably worth ten Gildas, five Maltese Falcons, two Lady from Shanghais—as much as we love those films. Most Hollywood movies are affirmative exercises in \"received tensions.\" The spectator can select whichever meanings help him to enjoy a film, and overlook as merely circumstantial detail the issues that might offend him. This ambiguity is the result of an only too careful, only too clever, technique, inherited by Hollywood from show business generally (and indeed from political rhetoric itself), of seeking out and dwelling on factors common to as wide a range of opinions as possible, while omitting or skimming lightly over divisive or embarrassing options. Consider Vidor's most ferocious film, Northwest Passage (1940)—which can be read as a call to World War II intervention by interventionists, and as a call to strenuous self-reliance by isolationists. Just as ambiguous is his most radical film, Our Daily Bread (1934). Our discussions center on his ways of incorporating this underlying political ambiguity without impairing a politically salutary shock. For art can be \"consciousness raising\" (what a phrase!) even when it's \"politically incorrect\" (what a phrase!). The Hollywood challenge is to so blend opposing political attitudes that they cancel each other out ideologically while producing a double surprise dramatically. Ironically, the Hollywood practice is a lot more like the genuine ambivalence of art, and the deep structures of thought, than many courageously partisan political statements. That's another subject, and, just now, in the eighties, a sad one. Meanwhile, it's essential to weigh such genuine ambivalence against assumptions that entertainment films are never political (as to that, we agree with Peter Biskind's Seeing Is Believing)7 and against militant tastes for the knockdown non-ambiguity of agitprop. Clearly the whole question of what constitutes a film's \"real\" meaning is problematic. Is it the meaning that only one critic has been able to see, by the light of a uniquely accurate reading? Or that which most of its spectators saw, even if they were leaping to unjustified conclusions? Or some compromise between these positions? Even when we carefully distinguish an \"intrinsic\" (textual) reading from a \"prevalent contemporary\" reading, further complications must appear. How to acknowledge the plurality of cultures and views among spectators, but without reverting to a pseudo-objectivity that in practice denies all subjectivities but\n\nHollywood versus America\n\n13\n\none? In the following essays, we've assumed that Vidor had learned, by experience and craft, to anticipate usual, or average, or in some sense normative, audience reactions pretty accurately—even though our words risk endowing with an impossible precision what spectators consciously experience as small surprises and displaced tonalities. Questions of finesse and precision are central because so many of Vidor's films are unapologetic melodramas. This is not surprising in his early silents, made for an audience, a culture, so naive and so tolerant that it may now seem to be lost, lost, lost. It can take a kind of mental archeology to see those films as Vidor proposed and the era's ideology disposed. M o r e troublesome yet is that even in Vidor's postwar noir epoch, from Duel in the Sun on, his films retained traits of \"primitive\" or, let's say, Griffithian melodrama. Thus their idiom was wildly out of sync with reviewers and English-language critics, w h o generally demanded a combination of underplayed, \" t o u g h \" emotion and poetic realism, with the social compassion of neorealism the only recognized form of social consciousness. Critics reacted as if The Big Sleep (deadpan and lyrical) was just good, healthy all-American thrills, whereas The Fountainhead was out of Grand Guignol by Kraft-Ebbing. Indeed, the melodramatic mode of Vidor's best films throughout his career still presents difficulties to those who are inclined, or taught, to expect from art a fastidious mixture of earnestness, education, and what is sometimes called \" h u m a n i s m . \" Exacting critics may experience as lack of motivation or implausibility, what Hollywood, Vidor, the popular audience, and critics like ourselves experience as sharp shocks that exhilarate and ring true. When confronted by melodramas with the violent and scandalous elements for which Vidor's are infamous, viewers may reject the kiss-kissbang-bang confrontation-climaxes (or, in the case of Duel in the Sun, the bang-bang-kiss-kiss) and fail to notice any subtler challenges. \" M e l o d r a m a \" normally revolves around either some violent physical action (as in Vidor's early silents) or some knockdown emotional equivalent ( \" p a s s i o n \" in some imprecise, global sense, as in Stella Dallas). There's nothing to prevent a film from being both a melodrama and a drama, which is where many of Vidor's fall. They expect their audiences to understand that conflicting emotions comprise a kind of dialectic (one excessive reaction provoking another) rather than a logical consistency—an understanding that tends to disappear as art comes under the aegis of academic rationalism. Vidor's \"strong d r a m a s \" had a curious, almost unique, way of straddling the division between \"men's films\" and \"women's films.\" His unabashed way with emotion is nearer to D. W. Griffith and Charlie Chaplin than to his closer contemporaries William Wellman and Howard Hawks. John Ford, like Vidor, also comes between the two generations.\n\n14\n\nKing Vidor, American\n\nBut if Ford is a \"man's m a n , \" or the caricature of it, whether stiffly spanking women ( T h e Quiet Man, Donovan's Reef) or stiffly saluting them, Vidor is more fluid, smiling, slick, vulnerable. If there's less suffering, there's more responsiveness; less slapstick, more adaptive humor. O f course, Vidor's studies of enthusiasm maturing haven't the compassion of Ford, who, as master of the male tearjerker, knows that even hard-asnails working-class audiences will accept a lachrymose hero so long as his enduring toughness has been established, and especially when his grief is occasioned by some stout-hearted desire, like never retiring from the Seventh Cavalry. Ford settles for elegiac tradition, and a foursquare compassion for misfit victims of economic circumstance, while Vidor, always so close to Horatio Alger, thinks about strenuous self- and group-help. We detail this comparison with Ford in discussing Our Daily Bread. Country and Western music is full of tearstained bars. Vidor's heroes cry, but not for long. M a y b e his country and Western roots in Texas have something to do with his continuous willingness to bare male \" w e a k n e s s \" and female volatility in family and love situations. If his films spanned the \" w o m e n ' s \" and \" m e n ' s \" categories, it's because he accepted, not matterof-factly but quite lyrically, the strengths of women and the weaknesses of men. He's unafraid of their weakness, because (whereas tough deadpans from Hawks to Peckinpah are as drearily restrictive as the English stiff upper lip) grief and volatility are forms of strong life force. Like Hawks and that generation, Vidor delights in knowing just how to hit, peak, and cut the emotional climaxes, to \" b a t it and g o . \" In discussing the climax of The Champ, we suggest how a brusque style can be made to balance decisive feelings, in place of Hawks's only-too-consistent steely eyes. O r contrast their World War I films—Vidor's The Big Parade and Hawks's Sergeant York. Hawks's initially rustic, puritan, pacifist hero makes his private's progress to an Old Testament doctrine. He picks off dozens of evil Huns from the rear, as slick as shooting ducks, and finally enters the presence, if not exactly of God, at least of God's O w n Country's president. But it's something in Hawks, rather than the requirements of wartime propaganda, that leaves his straightforward conversion story with a sense of deep problems slickly solved. Hasn't The Big Parade, for all its facile slapstick and a surface texture only intermittently more perfect, a profounder movement? Given his frequent assignments to showcase such stars as Laurette Taylor, Lillian Gish, Marion Davies, Barbara Stanwyck, and Jennifer Jones, it's remarkable that Vidor contrived to avoid the \"women's direct o r \" pigeonhole. (There is little parallel in any assignments for male stars.) However, that label secretly implies cozy interiors, domestic anxiety, a soft romance-novel f o c u s — a l l of which could hardly be further removed from either Vidor's typically elemental milieus (notably, swamps\n\nHollywood versus America\n\n15\n\nand mountaintops) or the swaggering, potentially destructive heroines in his postwar films. Vidor is a natural feminist, not an ideological one. T h a t is to say, his women drive men crazy, and/or inspire them, and do what they want, without becoming superior beings. Conquering the Woman is one of his silent titles, and a frequent theme. Collaterally, Vidor's emphasis on energy leads to problems not so much of dominance, as of tense negotiations in response to virile fraternity. We'll have something to say in our notes on Our Daily Bread and The Fountainhead about the ways in which Vidor needs to be distinguished from the \"male feminist.\" His idea of sexual roles is both traditional and none too rigid. Reciprocity constitutes its mainspring, not least in the mutual slap-downs that punctuate his work. And of the ways in which Vidor should be counted a m o n g the feminists, we'll say something in connection with Stella Dallas (its prominence in recent feminist analyses reinforces how the ostensibly confining \"weepie\" allows very wide angles on sexual politics). Pointedly independent professional women feature in several Vidor movies, including the early (and unfortunately no longer extant) Poor Relations and The Real Adventure* N o other Hollywood director of his era so often called on women collaborators—two-thirds of Vidor's films not written by him alone involved women screenwriters. To that extent, Vidor's women were written by women and watched by women. An oddly persistent motif running through Vidor's work could be labeled \" M o m i s t \" if that term didn't risk shortchanging the magic prescience of maternal figures—notably in Proud Flesh, The Big Parade, Hallelujah, Billy the Kid, So Red the Rose, An American Romance, Duel in the Sun, and Ruby Gentry. We'll defer detailed discussion of this, but one can't help but be struck by how often female strength and resolution revive the temporarily deadened life force of Vidor's heroes. While the box office might explain this \"mother's angle\" in the days of family audiences, something more personal looms through these idealized or sacrificing mothers, particularly next to stark views of marriage. One might take a tip from an F. Scott Fitzgerald story, \"Crazy Sunday\" (1932), which was based on the confidences of Vidor's second wife and star of several of his late silents, Eleanor Boardman. \" T h e psychoanalyst told Miles that he had a mother complex. In his first marriage he transferred his mother complex to his wife, you see—and then his sex turned to me. But when we were married the thing repeated itself—he transferred his mother complex to me and all his libido turned toward this other w o m a n . \" 8 Whatever the \"gibberish level,\" suspected by Fitzgerald's hero, the expla*See the the text.\n\nfilmography\n\nfor brief notes o n these and other lost films not discussed in\n\n16\n\nKing Vidor, A m e r i c a n\n\nnation parallels David Thomson's conception of \"women's pictures\" as \"maddened extensions of the Western cult of the Madonna,\" and as an ideal form for male filmmakers to \"protect and project\" emotional lives forbidden them—and doubly forbidden Vidor as a Hollywood intellectual. 9 (Vidor took a friendly revenge on Fitzgerald through the character details given the blocked novelist in A Wedding Night.) It's not that Vidor's films aren't just as true to Leslie Fiedler's American novelist psychopathy of strained marriages and idealized mother figures as is typical among Hollywood's \"men's directors.\" 10 But Vidor arrives at that pattern by the opposite route, via tales of men who are hard pressed to match their women. One could be forgiven for following the lead of the Directors Guild eulogy and dismissing Vidor as more \"ladies' man\" than feminist.\" To put it gently, he was never the most enduring of partners. The evident flagging of his inspiration in the decade beginning in the mid thirties corresponds to a particularly frenzied era in his private life, including several well-publicized affairs, two marriage announcements, and a headlinemaking custody battle over his two daughters by Eleanor Boardman, complete with accusations of international kidnapping. By Vidor's own account, location shooting on The Stranger's Return proceeded while he was (a) having an affair with its star Miriam Hopkins and (b) commuting back to L.A. for six-evenings-a-week psychoanalysis. (Amazingly, the finished film is far better than routine, and King's reaction to the end of his affair with Hopkins—sawing the legs off their couch—has a batty flair worthy of his own melodramas.) Perhaps his strength and weakness, as a man and artist, came from the Westerner's restlessness he everywhere displayed—in genres, in studios, in his life. When Vidor spoke with us in 1982 (a few months before his death at eighty-seven), he chose to bring up his mother's example as the guiding influence in his own lifelong fascination with Christian Science—a fascination that, frustratingly to him, stopped short of belief. The following pages repeatedly evoke the links between three American attitudes often treated as incompatible: the Puritan ethic, Emersonian transcendentalism, and a secular, enterprising dynamism. Much of Vidor's inspiration was generated by the tension between these three outlooks. Their common factor is man's role as the expansion of God's or nature's energies— and they even aggravate man's sins, as energy misled. Christian Science comes near to being the religion (made-in-U.S.A., and woman-made) that unifies such outlooks, even in defiance of that male concoction, \"rigorous logic.\" 12 Mary Baker Eddy's was a Massachusetts reaction, not unlike Emerson's, against evangelical revivalism and toward a natural pantheism. And yet Christian Science is best known for its rigid dismissal of scientific\n\nHollywood versus America\n\n17\n\nmethod, in place of which it puts an optimistic, not to say Panglossian, faith in the world and in mankind as God's direct reflection. Vidor prepared a biopic about Mrs. Eddy, Bright Answer, in which she calmly corrects the Sage of Concord in the midst of a somewhat unlikely social meeting: \" M r . Emerson, please forgive me, but you speak of sin as if it were a reality. . . . This seems to me to be the basis of our dilemma, trying to make evil an equal force.\" 13 In Hollywood, Vidor could hardly go so far as Mrs. Eddy in treating sin as \"mortal illusion,\" 14 but his way with villains and destructive heroes/heroines makes the sins of energy virtues by contrast with the absence of sin in a repressed, or dead, soul. If that idea is occasionally stressed by orthodox Christians like Georges Bernanos, it nonetheless runs counter to the normal Christian emphasis on restraint and immaculacy. In light of the contrast between Vidor's nearly pious autobiography and the complex morality of, say, Hallelujah or Beyond the Forest, one has to suspect that, like Blake's Milton, he's of the Devil's party without knowing it. And many Vidor films quietly repudiate orthodox or narrowly doctrinal Christianity (as in The Sky Pilot, The Stranger's Return, Ruby Gentry, War and Peace, and Solomon and Sheba). Without denying the existence of the puritan strain to which French Catholic and Cahiers critics have rightly pointed, their general description of Vidor's films as \" p u r i t a n \" begs too many questions about varieties of puritanism—questions we address in connection with Hallelujah. If we more often label Vidor's thought as \"transcendental,\" it's to incorporate the usual attributes of the N e w England movement—Thoreau's idealism about nature and rural communities, Emerson's individual intuition as a guide to the spiritual, Bronson Alcott's reformable democracy of selfreliant citizens. Still, it's also with the understanding that Vidor's was a strikingly nervous, restless transcendentalism, dissociated from the idealism of bodiless spirit, and related to the categorical imperatives of the life force itself. The wilderness in Northwest Passage isn't evil, as it was for the original Puritans; it's the challenge, the test, and in that sense, the road to God, that marks America's turn from puritanism to optimism. Another of Vidor's unproduced projects, a quite faithful adaptation of Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Marble Faun, reminds us of their affinities. Hawthorne, too, was a melodramatic moralist, impatient with the ethereal hokus-pokus of a shallow transcendentalism, and mislabeled a Puritan perhaps because an American optimism made the very concept of sin touchy and reproachful. But for both artists, \"sin\" is usually redemptive. Vidor's script (first drafted, with Harry Behn, in 1954, and at one time titled The Sinner) centers on Hawthorne's Miriam and thus would have extended Vidor's postwar line of perhaps-justified murderesses—Pearl in Duel in the Sun, Rosa in Beyond the Forest, and Ruby in Ruby Gentry. Vidor's transcendentalism was wide open to the pragmatism that looms\n\n18\n\nKing Vidor, A m e r i c a n\n\nso large in American culture. It affected his sense of w h a t was reasonably possible, b o t h for himself as a H o l l y w o o d artist and for his characters in their situations. Unlike puritanism, transcendentalism a n d p r a g m a t i s m are u n d o g m a t i c and adaptive creeds, particularly w h e n combined with an individualism whereby each m a n must follow his o w n moral destiny. Each creed has its \" h e r b i v o r o u s \" and \" c a r n i v o r o u s \" forms, its reformist, responsible aspects and its laissez-faire ones, its moral uses and abuses. In their combination lies d y n a m i s m . For example, theories of evolution enable an apparently idealistic transcendentalism to a c c o m m o d a t e the savageries of Social D a r w i n i s m , and thence to accept realpolitik a n d ratrace egotism. To put it a n o t h e r way, the Christian Science idealism of \" W h a t e v e r is, is r i g h t \" could mask the m e a n i n g of \"Tough shit, b u t that's the way the cookie crumbles.\" T h e transcendentalist M a r g a r e t Fuller was m o c k e d by Carlyle for saying she accepted the universe: \"By G o d , she'd better!\" Would Vidor line up with Carlyle? Yes a n d no. At any rate, the unresolved tensions in the p o p u l a r morality along w h o s e wavelength he moves are dramatically expressed in his characters' incessant switching between resilience and sensitivity. His films pursue their tension-ridden course between social concern (rather t h a n conscience) a n d optimism, between generosity a n d ruthlessness, between rugged self-reliance a n d brutal egoism. N o t that the p r o b l e m s a p p e a r as brutally as they d o in the films of Joseph Losey. But Vidor's p r o f o u n d e s t films are those in which his transcendentalism knuckles d o w n to grin and bear it, a J o b w h o has to s h o w a salesman's smile. Since Vidor believes that each m a n m u s t w o r k t h r o u g h his o w n destiny w h e r e he is placed, he must give as m a n y answers as there are places. Like W h i t m a n , he \"contains multitudes.\" But if he accepts p o p u l a r assumptions, it is usually in an a t t e m p t to push things to some spiritual crisis. Ambivalent as the answers may be, this separates him f r o m d i r e c t o r s — like, say, Raoul Walsh a n d H o w a r d H a w k s — w h o , if genuine auteurs, are narrow, even m o n o t o n o u s in their repetitions. It puts him with people like Jean Renoir, w h o explore the contradictions of felt experience, never d e m o n s t r a t i n g cut-and-dried moralities. T h e chapters that follow try to clarify some of the p a r a d o x e s — t h e central conflicts a n d small p r i n t — t h a t comprise Vidor's love affair w i t h America. It's easily assumed that troubled emotions are less discriminating t h a n rational t h o u g h t . O u r a s s u m p t i o n has been that t r o u b l e d e m o tions are signals f r o m intuitive t h o u g h t — t h e kind that only seems vague because of the genuine difficulty of dramatizing it. Vidor's love affair with America was variously (or simultaneously) idyllic, recriminatory, indulgent, and imbued with a passion as subtle as philosophy.\n\n3 1913 to 1925 \"Into the Vale of Soul Making\"\n\nWhatever the freedoms of early Hollywood, it was not until The Big Parade (1925) that Vidor felt able to \"break out.\"' Of the twenty feature films he directed in the six years before then, ten are known to survive— an unusually high percentage. Of those, most are of only historical or auteurist interest, although The Jack-Knife Man, Wild Oranges, and The Sky Pilot are more than that. King Wallis Vidor, born February 8, 1894, was a third-generation Texan.2 His paternal grandfather, Charles Vidor, had emigrated from Hungary during the Austrian reprisals against Kossuth's revolution and eventually settled in the port city of Galveston, where he worked as a cotton factor, becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1868. King's father, Charles S. Vidor, was quite prosperous at the time of the birth of his son, the first of two children with his wife, Kate Wallis, and named in honor of her brother, King Wallis. The Wallis family were of venerable American stock, descendants of Davy Crockett's wife Elizabeth by her first marriage. (She was the mother of King's maternal grandmother.) Charles S. Vidor owned a hardwood forest in the Dominican Republic and sawmills in East Texas and Louisiana, and had introduced another mill to a small Texas community that took the name Vidor in 1910. But, soon after, his fortunes declined through an insurance business and oil speculation. After grade school at the Peacock Military Academy in San Antonio, King Vidor's formal education continued at a private high school in Maryland. But at sixteen, he dropped out and entered the movie business as a ticket taker and occasional projectionist in a storefront nickelodeon 19\n\nFigure 7.\n\nKing Vidor as a child.\n\n1913 to 1925\n\n21\n\nin Galveston. A 1913 hurricane provided the subject for his first film, shot with a friend's homemade camera. Some actualities, beginning with a troop parade in Houston, were sold to the Mutual Weekly newsreel. To judge from Vidor's own anecdotal account, his first stab at fictional filmmaking, a two-reel comedy, In Tow, was in all respects incompetent. Matters improved when he was approached for collaboration by another Galvestonian, Edward Sedgwick, who, with his vaudeville family, had worked in some regional films. (Sedgwick also went on to a Hollywood directorial career, but is now remembered mainly for shepherding Buster Keaton through his decline at MGM.) Together they formed the Hotex Motion Picture Company, the name conflated from their office in Houston, Texas. Although their letterhead proclaimed Hotex \"Producers of High Class Motion Pictures,\" their stock offerings stated an average cost of $350 to $500 for one- or two-reelers: \"We have found that a location with maximum days of sunshine, such as that of Southern California and OUR OWN SOUTH, offers opportunity and the most profit from film production.\" Among the Hotex comedy-adventures, all directed by Sedgwick and co-written with Vidor, were such unremarkable-sounding offerings as The Heroes, about the capture of a convict, and Beautiful Love, a \"European\" intrigue with a kidnapped countess, which must have taxed such company wardrobes as are on display in surviving stills (fig. 9). After failing with such entrepreneurial innovations as films free to theaters to advertise Texas products—signed in promotional letters by \"K. W. Vidor, Gen. Mgr., King Service Dept.\"—they sought national distribution. On the day of Vidor's marriage to Florence Arto, the couple set off for New York. A brief item in Moving Picture World (17 October 1914), probably the first mention of Vidor in a national publication, mangled his company name, but made things sound promising: Hotel Will Release Through Sawyer King W. Vidor, of the Hotel Film Manufacturing Company,\n\nHouston\n\nTexas, has been in New York City to arrange for a market for his company. He finally closed a contract with Sawyer, Inc., which firm will handle his company's pictures.\n\nBut only the following week, Moving Picture World announced that Sawyer's assets would be taken over by something called \"The Colossus Feature Film Company.\" A slippery colossus, it took the prints and negatives and never returned a cent in royalties. As Vidor must have been discovering, the end was near for independent regional production. For the past year, he had been sending off scenarios to Hollywood and receiving only rejection slips. After picking up some money for an industrial documentary about sugar refining in Houston, it was time to try the West Coast in person.\n\nTHE HOTEX MOTION PICTURE COMPANY HOUSTON, TEXAS\n\nPRODUCERS OF\n\nMOTION PICTURES\n\nKING W.

Vidor is the cop on the left.\n\nThere, another of Vidor's old Texas flames, Corinne Griffith (herself just starting a major career in silents) found Florence Vidor a steady acting job at the Vitagraph studios, while Vidor took every picture-business odd job he could scare up, primarily at Vitagraph and nearby \"Inceville\"—prop boy, script clerk, bit actor. The titles of these are lost, as are most of the films themselves, no doubt. However, at least one survives, a harmless spy drama called The Intrigue (directed by Frank Lloyd; 1916), in which Florence, as the heroine's maid, opens doors inside the mansion (fig. 10a), while King, as a chauffeur, opens doors outside (fig. 10b). After months of script rejections, he sold his first, When It Rains, It Pours (1916), a comic romance about two lovers locked out on a wet night, to Vitagraph (for $30) because—so he claimed—they needed one that could be shot in the rain. Vidor's storyline for Dan's Daring Drama (a two-reeler directed by A1 Santell; 1917?) seems to be a satire of his own frustration: one \" H a r m o n Naigs, extra man at the Bunko Moving Picture C o m p a n y \" imagines a wild Arabian adventure, only to be booted out by a director more concerned with having props moved. \"That's the trouble with these picture companies,\" complains Naigs, \"They won't buy a good story when they see it.\" But soon enough, Vidor was hired as a writer in Universal's shorts department, where his efforts—to judge f r o m synopses—seem to have been workmanlike. His unlikely first opportunity to direct narrative films in Hollywood\n\n24\n\nKing Vidor, A m e r i c a n\n\na\n\nFigure 10. The Intrigue (1916).

Vidor made ten of these into two-reelers (all released between January and May 1918) before money problems interrupted the series. A reel from the first, Bud's Recruit, survives, and reveals a serviceably theatrical style, at its best with the child-hero (who subverts both his draft-age brother's shirking of the Great War and his society mother's \"peace advocacy\"). Bud's Recruit was the only episode not to include the judge himself, who at some point in each subsequent film is called on to resolve the crisis. As Father Knows Best— like as these sound, Vidor \"deeply believed\" in them, and the trade notices were, with few exceptions, excellent. A number of the episodes do have fascinating social content: The Chocolate of the Gang, about a black boy wrongly denied membership in an all-white club (with, significantly, \"an excellent Chocolate and other colored performers, including Chocolate's mother\",' not the whites in blackface still the rule for lead roles); Thief or Angel, involving a tenement girl arrested for stealing milk; and the final episode filmed by Vidor, I'm a Man, about a boy who proves his German-immigrant parents are more loyal to the United States than is a false Frenchman. With financing from some of the same doctors and dentists who'd backed the Judge Brown series, Vidor was able to begin feature filmmaking. Nine physicians invested a thousand dollars each, incorporated as \"Brentwood Films\" (from the name of their country club), leased a building on Fountain Avenue as \"Brentwood Studios,\" and left Vidor to make The Turn in the Road. It was an immediate success. He had only been able to afford to strike one print, but after an eight-week house-recordbreaking run in Los Angeles, the film was purchased for national release\n\n1913 to 1925\n\n25\n\nby Robertson-Cole. Although not contractually b o u n d , he stayed with the doctors t h r o u g h o u t 1919, making Better Times, The Other Half, a n d Poor Relations. Using advance m o n e y f r o m the newly f o r m e d N e w York-based exhibitors' conglomerate First N a t i o n a l (through w h o m he released his next three films—The Family Honor [1920], The Jack-Knife Man [1920], a n d The Sky Pilot [1921]), Vidor was able to build his o w n studio, d u b b e d \" V i d o r Village,\" on fifteen acres along Santa M o n i c a Boulevard in Hollyw o o d . Further reverses h a d necessitated his family moving f r o m Texas to Arkansas, and Vidor n o w b r o u g h t them o u t to Los Angeles, with his father to serve as \"Vice President of King Vidor P r o d u c t i o n s . \" As with the old H o t e x company, Vidor raised operating capital t h r o u g h public shares, some stockholders investing as little as ten dollars. But, again, independent p r o d u c t i o n proved financially impossible, a n d within t w o years Vidor Village faced court-ordered confiscation of its movable property. T h e breaking point came with the troubled location s h o o t i n g o n The Sky Pilot (no snow w h e n it was needed, and then blizzards w h e n it came), exacerbated by Vidor's infatuation with his star, Colleen M o o r e . \" K i n g Vidor P r o d u c t i o n s \" retained only enough m o n e y for a single d e m o n s t r a tion scene f r o m his next picture, Love Never Dies ( 1 9 2 1 ) — a l t h o u g h that scene, a spectacularly effective train crash created in miniature, was suffi-\n\nFigure 11.\n\nVtdor Village (1921).\n\n26\n\nKing Vidor, A m e r i c a n\n\ncient to convince Thomas Ince to finance the remainder. (Vidor did regain control of his studio, but made no more films there and sold it in January 1923.) As in their first months in Los Angeles, Florence Vidor was again their salvation. She had become a leading player at Paramount, and the couple now arranged a four-picture contract with Associated Exhibitors. King Vidor directed the first three: The Real Adventure, Dusk to Dawn, and Conquering the Woman (all 1922). But, with their marriage breaking up, he assigned direction of the fourth, Alice Adams (1923), to Rowland V. Lee. At Metro, Vidor reached probably the lowpoint of his early career, transferring three stage plays to the screen: Peg o' My Heart (1922), Laurette Taylor's film debut; Happiness (1924), also with Taylor; and The Woman of Bronze (1923) for longtime star Clara Kimball Young. Intermixed were two films for the Goldwyn studios: Three Wise Fools (1923), starring his second wife to be, Eleanor Boardman, and Wild Oranges (1924), filmed in Florida at a time when such distant location shooting was becoming rare. When those studios merged in April 1924 under Louis B. Mayer's control as Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Vidor came along through his Goldwyn contract. Wine of Youth, His Hour, Wife of the Centaur (all 1924), and Proud Flesh (1925) were his four M G M assignments before he was allowed The Big Parade.\n\nThe Rudiments of Vidor's Political Philosophy \"Try and secure a list of the members of the Christian Science churches and mail them a special invitation to see their beliefs demonstrated in a photoplay,\" exhibitors were instructed by Motion Picture News upon release of Vidor's second feature, Better Times, in 1919. 4 It's not easy to spirit oneself back to an era in American moviemaking that allowed the philosophic range implied by such advice. Vidor's first five features are lost, and many of his subsequent silents from the first half of the twenties are decidedly minor, but whatever else one can say of them, they seldom lack a religious idealism about the moral strength of the mind, or a \"middle-American\" faith in rural society. In the early features, an individualistic Christianity is mixed with an American version of the agrarian myth, persistent since Jefferson, of the healing open spaces. The resulting values are close to those of the Populist movement, which, strictly speaking, was an agrarian reform program of the 1890s although with ideals that permeated first the Democratic party and then the Republican Pro-\n\n1913 to 1925\n\nFriday, July\n\n$\n\nACJ2-\n\n3-cdtc..\n\nFigure 12.\n\n17, 1014\n\n\"\"fcikix,\n\nH - C l a v c L fej;\n\nCUxilGiAvg. >vn£u t o\n\n* u I r v •-.

Of all Vidor's features, the loss of his first, The Turn in the Road, is most to be regretted. From all reports it was dramatically successful and heartfelt, something of a bare draft for the spiritual crisis in The Crowd. The storyline is quite frank: 5 Paul, overprotected son of a grasping capitalist who controls their isolated company steeltown, marries the more beautiful of the town minister's two daughters and lives happily, until his wife dies in childbirth. Already disillusioned with his father's materialism, he looks for solace from his father-in-law, who can only repeat the Calvinist sermons about \"the will of God\" that he has been delivering for thirty-five years. Anguished over the nature of a God who would permit such sorrow, Paul, now dubbed \"the Searcher,\" flees to Chicago, where city temptations lead him lower and lower. Meanwhile, the minister's other daughter, June, also seeking to know \"What is God?\" finds a mentor in a \"Mrs. Edmunds\" (whose name may suggest Mrs. Eddy) who \"calmly and confidently informs her that the answer is 'within you'\" (as Vidor's original story put it). June raises Paul's abandoned son as a natural pantheist (dramatized through an improvised scene in which sevenyear-old Ben Alexander demonstrated to the film crew his fearlessness of bees by letting them swarm over him). The boy softens his steel-baron grandfather, who has previously proved impervious to suggestions that he get \"closer to nature,\" and so averts brewing violence over a wage strike. On a rainy night, the boy finds Paul, now a tramp, hiding in their barn, and brings him food—and the spiritual answers he's been seeking. When June discovers the two, she introduces them as father and son. Together the three begin a new family. Similar elements infused The Other Half (1919), Vidor's third feature, which sounds like an entry in the class-conscious cycle of industrial melodramas that survives in such fascinating Thomas Ince productions as Dangerous Hours (1919) and William S. Hart's The Whistle (1921). A pair of war buddies turn civilian enemies when one accepts a job as a machinist in the other's company. The owner's refusal to make repairs results in an accident that blinds his former friend. And so it falls to their respective sweethearts—Florence Vidor and ZaSu Pitts—to restore harmony, the former writing newspaper exposés that lead the industrialist to \"see\" the error of his ways. Although doctors have despaired, the machinist simultaneously wills back his sight. About this picture's Christian Science, Motion Picture News commented, hopefully, \"Even those opposed to it like doctors, etc., will be curious to know to what lengths this director will go.\" 6 With Better Times Vidor lightened the tone into a rural comedy, without altering the philosophy. ZaSu Pitts helps her layabout father run a\n\nFigure 13. The Turn in the Road (1919).

Several of Vidor's early unproduced scenarios follow such storylines: Caviar and Cabbage; or, Love's Sanitarium has another \"pampered son of the idle rich\" discover health only after his car breaks down on the way to a doctor's sanitarium. He's invited into a small community for some positive thinking supplemented with bowls \"heaped high with steaming cabbage.\" Such plotlines may well reflect Vidor's disillusion with doctors when, around the time he quit school, he developed a \"nervous problem\" none could diagnose—\"dizzy spells, palpitations and the like.\" 7 The Denver specialist consulted by his parents employed experimental treatments; the swallowing of a rubber hose proving particularly traumatic. It's reasonable to suppose that the \"doctors and dentists\" financing Brentwood Films must have been Christian Science healers to have stood for such productions. But Vidor says not, and that he felt trepidation about how they would react to the films' \"anti-materia medica.\" 8 They must have been impressed by success. Even Vidor's first feature away from Brentwood, The Family Honor (1920), ended its complicated \"Southern\" plotline with what reviewers took for Christian Science sentiments that \"defy logic.\" 9 Such overt Christian Science reflects a phase Vidor soon abandoned, both publicly and privately, and almost never discussed in later years, even when he flirted with it again in the sixties. But a sense of how persistent the individualist idealism behind it was is given by his most deeply felt unproduced post—World War II project, also titled The Turn in the Road, which he began in 1 9 4 5 , pushed strongly in 1 9 5 4 , and got as far as casting at Allied Artists in 1 9 6 0 . Its storyline bears little resemblance to his first feature, and its \"searcher\" is eventually embodied in a disillusioned Hollywood director. Still, bees again swarm harmlessly, this time over a mysteriously visionary girl, who also talks a temporarily blinded man back into sight. An alternate title relates the project to Vidor's first Hollywood optimism: So Long Remembered. Indeed. All of these lost 1 9 1 9 Brentwood films, as well as the features soon to follow, asked the same question, \"Is Real Life Interesting?\" which is the opening title of True Heart Susie (also 1 9 1 9 ) , the D. W. Griffith film they most resemble. \"Real life\" in both cases meant melodramas of midwestern and southern country life, with a Populist esteem for that world in contrast with inhumanities born of the city. Fortunately, The Jack-Knife Man (1920) survives to suggest the visual pattern of Vidor's best early work. Without its survival, the homages paid Griffith by Vidor in interviews could seem merely the genuflecting of\n\nPirall'\n\n111\n\nMlaHa\n\nA Creed and a Pledge— I BELIEVE in t h e m o t i o n picture that carries a message to humanity.

From the Vidor Village investment brochure. More than fifty years later, Vidor commented: \"I might have been stupid enough in my first few pictures to put out a creed that I wouldn't make pictures with violence or sex. . . . It was an advertisement, you know. . . . Right after it came out in the paper, I got arrested for playing poker in a sixty-cent game. The headlines were pretty awful. It didn't go with this idealistic statement\" (DGA).\n\n32\n\nKing Vidor, American\n\nevery director of his era. But whatever his oft-repeated admiration for Intolerance (whose sets dominated Hollywood when the Vidors arrived from Texas and in which he may have picked up a few days' work as an extra), we can't help agreeing with those who see Griffith's genius as more lyrical than epic, his ambitions notwithstanding.\"' Only chronologically was Griffith \"the founding father of Hollywood\"; as an artist he never accommodated its patterns. Although The Jack-Knife Man has a pace and spirit quite in sync with the Griffith of True Heart Susie, both directors were returning to the mode of Griffith's Biograph one-reelers of a decade before. Vidor's recollection that First National was displeased with the lyrical film he gave them, under budget, is supported even by favorable contemporary reviews, which found it \"a pleasing reaction against\" styles of the year.\" Griffith's shadow falls heavily on a bedraggled mother and child whose outlandish entrance into the methodical domesticity of a Mississippi river tramp, \"Peter Lane,\" sets The Jack-Knife Man into action (fig. 15). Flinging open his houseboat door, she's silhouetted by lightning, then collapses down the steps in a soaking black mass at his feet. Griffith even works such an entrance, and the lingering death that follows, into the otherwise idyllic True Heart Susie. In tortured posture, \"Liz\" in the Vidor film duplicates Lillian Gish's exhausted faint through the doorway into the shelter of the Chinaman's shop in Broken Blossoms, released fifteen months earlier. Liz's wild, rain-soaked hair and delirious pleading of \"I'll be good! Don't take him!\" might additionally remind one of Gish's tainted mother fighting storms and river ice-floes in Way Down East (released three weeks after The Jack-Knife Man). However, straining for parallels with Gish's orphan of many storms isn't essential, as Vidor cast Claire McDowell, who also played leads for Griffith at Biograph, as his fighting mother. It's typical that Vidor would fasten on McDowell, who (unlike other early Griffith heroines, Mary Pickford, Mae Marsh, or the Gish sisters) was a tall and strikingly strong-looking woman in her Biograph days, with huge eyes and an angular jaw that telegraphed determination. One of Griffith's harshest—and strangest—films, The Female of the Species (1912), has her turn from strangling another woman at the cries of an abandoned infant. Some such tension between fierceness and maternal instincts supercharges her scenes in The Jack-Knife Man and makes her the perfect foil for the deliberation in Peter's every move. Even as he cradles Liz's head on his lap, her tangled black hair and desperately leaping eyes bring into his boat a new energy. Claire McDowell returns twice again for Vidor as a vital mother, memorably in The Big Parade. After Liz's death, her young son stays on with Peter, who comes to be known as \"the jack-knife man\" because of the wooden animals he first carves to amuse the boy. Another tattered hobo, \"Booge,\" steals the boat\n\n1913 to 1925\n\nFigure 15.\n\nThe Jack-Knife Man (1920). Claire McDowell\n\nand Bobby\n\n33\n\nKelso.\n\nand boy, but the men unite against a common e n e m y — a river town's intrusive orphans' aid society. With its orphan inspiring a tramp, The JackKnife Man links The Turn in the Road with Chaplin's The Kid (released six months later; although in light of the eighteen-month production of The Kid, the rampant speculation in Hollywood over Chaplin's \" b i g \" picture, and the fact that the Vidor and Chaplin films were both financed by First National, some conscious connection is not impossible). T h e longshots of Peter walking from civilization to the horizon down dirt roads do remind one now of Chaplin's favorite closing shots. Both films were no doubt emotionally boosted by the decline in the U.S. population following World War I, the 1 9 1 8 influenza epidemic, and the first real push for birth control. T h e resulting higher status of children, and the increased number of orphans, may also have had something to do with prolonging the infantilism in M a r y Pickford's persona. One might cynically propose that the sentimental sympathy for the lower classes in both Griffith and Chaplin pandered to the audiences they began with, but something more fundamental made both artists cling to such populist (in the film sense) sympathy long after audience demographics had shifted upward. Griffith's ideology, of course, was close to that of an unreconstructed Southerner (resulting in those painful justifications in chapter 2 of every film history text). Nevertheless, Griffith is also\n\n34\n\nKing Vidor, American\n\nthe first master of a pre-Hollywood \" A m e r i c a n \" cinema of Populist (in the political sense) idealism, of social concerns dramatized through rural lyricism. While Vidor retains a certain southern provincialism, it is this larger tradition of small-scale rural dramas that inspired his first features. T h e panoramic closing shots of such Griffith one-reelers as The Country Doctor ( 1 9 0 9 ) and A Corner in Wheat ( 1 9 0 9 ) universalize the confined melodramas that precede them. With feature length, but small budgets, Vidor returned to this line. The Jack-Knife Man's progress is interrupted by lyrical longshots of the loner gliding along the smooth river or struggling over rutted roads. \" V i d o r Village\" was self-consciously guided by the midwestern spirit of \" B o o t h Tarkington, M a r k Twain and James Whitcomb Riley.\" 1 2 Continuing in that milieu and spirit, if less successfully, is Love Never Dies ( 1 9 2 1 ) , a homespun North Carolina variant on Griffith's thricefilmed \" E n o c h Arden\" formula. A husband (Lloyd Hughes), mistaking his wife's abduction for desertion, flees town by train and reports his own death in its wreck as a way of denying everything about his rural hometown. As any Populist could have told him, this can lead to no good. After years spent in Chicago, with sterile financial success, his longing calls him back to \"Ridgeville\" to find a remarried wife and a son whose existence he has never suspected. Played straight, the storyline taxes even silent film's proclivity for characters who never get around to explaining things to each other. Leo McCarey's comedy version, My Favorite Wife ( 1 9 4 0 ) , makes more sense. T h e film is structured by \" J o h n ' s \" denials—of his mother, his rural trash sister, his wife's love, his hometown itself—until this man of little faith gets the ordeal he deserves by denying he's alive. O n misunderstanding that his wife has chosen to leave him, he curls up in dejection on their bed and toys with and talks to her nightgown into the night (fig. 16a). A long take details his slow awakening in the same fetal passivity, which matches his wife's posture in her father's home (fig. 16b). Whatever the curiosity value of this humanization of melodrama, the sequence is just the sort that Karl Brown managed to more purpose in his rural melodrama Stark Love ( 1 9 2 7 ) when he fashioned a context—rising floodw a t e r s — t o make us doubly anxious over his hero's fetal-posture despair in place of any active search for his love. N o doubt an unfair anticipation of Vidor's vital tragic lovers to come (in Hallelujah, Duel in the Sun, and Ruby Gentry particularly) makes the mutual debility here even more annoying. T h e hometown itself is given a distinct visual treatment upon John's return—less a matter of constricting nights in cluttered rooms than of open pastures and rushing rivers. T h e conflict between past and present husbands turns into a class conflict, fought with clothing, gestures, and\n\n1913 to 1925\n\nFigure 16.\n\nLove Never Dies (1921). Lloyd Hughes and Madge\n\n35\n\nBellamy.\n\nmanners. Right from the first shot of John's disgusted gaze into the street, he's too good for his \" m o t h e r \" — a l t h o u g h audiences might accept that as a right conferred by ambition and his architectural talent (and, we discover, by her lie: she's not really his mother). Later, when John has prospered into immaculately pressed suits, the second husband, Joel, has degenerated to the rural trash level that John's sister's clothing had hinted of as a possible fate for John himself. Joel skulks a r o u n d dressed like a Griffith tramp in tattered shirt, suspenders, and floppy hat, quite understandably distressed at the return of his wife's dead husband. John meets him with the essence of city civility, offering a firm handshake while expressing sorrow at mucking up his life. T h a t kinda stuff doesn't cut it with Joel, w h o tries pathetically to muscle John out of town at gunpoint. By this point, our sympathies are thoroughly confused. Eventually John throws off his city duds and turns man of action again, attempting (but failing, luckily for the resolution) to save Joel f r o m a river suicide. M a n y of Vidor's favorite Populist motifs are here, but strangely mixed. Even A Modern Prodigal (1910), Griffith's odd \"story in symbolism,\" combines motifs of city temptations, rural honesty, and river rescue in more involving ways. The genre, in its silent form, reached maturity with Stark Love and Frank Borzage's Back Pay (1922) and The River (1928). The stage plays Vidor was assigned to bring to the screen after the collapse of his independent production company necessarily afforded fewer opportunities. Still, even within a severely restrictive assignment like Peg o' My Heart (1922), touches of his political philosophy shine through. The play had been a hugely successful vehicle for toast-of-Broadway Laurette Taylor. This was her first film, and her husband, also the play's author, J. Hartley Manners, took the role of producer, no doubt restraining Vidor from any thoroughgoing tampering with the well-known source,\n\n36\n\nKing Vidor, American\n\nwhich had played something like ten thousand English-language performances by various companies within six years of its 1912 debut. It was hardly a smooth s h o o t — V i d o r temporarily walked off the picture after the first day's chaos of location work with the stage-trained actress. What was left him were choices of how to open up a one-set play and how to convey banter through pantomime. Both play and film chart the cultural comedy arising from the introduction (via bank failures and dying last wishes) of free-spirited, uneducated, Irish Peg into the stodgy British m a n o r of her aunt, Mrs. Chichester. The play's trick, long in the tooth even by 1912, is to have British high society shown up by young Peg's moral honesty and sentimental love philosophy (which, naturally in the context, are indistinguishable). And, for good measure, she's the real moneyed heiress, condescending unbeknownst. It was exactly the sort of thing Mary Pickford had been regularly cleaning up with, most recently in Little Lord Fauntleroy (1921). Vidor's film was another box-office hit. From the play's throwaway details, Vidor fleshes a sharp contrast. Introduced, after an early-Griffith pan across the landscape, is Peg's father (Russell Simpson), not as the blarneying jack-of-all-trades gone off to America implied in Peg's rosy recollections in the play, but as a revolutionary Fenian, rousing peasants for land reform from the back of his wagon (fig. 17a) and only feigning the irresponsible gypsy when colonial police gallop up. Thus, in the film, Peg's moral superiority is allowed to come less from \" h o n e s t \" sentimental love and more from being her father's daughter, following in his commitment to rural self-reliance. The impression of the film version as a Populist revision is reinforced by the figure of \"Jerry,\" the Chichesters' neighbor, w h o introduces himself to Peg as \"a farmer.\" He is said to be a farmer in the play as well, but there it's as a whim in the jack-of-all-trades characterization parallel to Peg's father (\"I can do a whole lot of things fairly well, and none of them\n\nFigure 17.\n\nPeg o' My Heart (1922).\n\n1913 to 1925\n\n37\n\nwell enough to brag about\").\" Vidor covers our suspicions of anyone cozy with the Chichesters through a new scene in Jerry's orchard (fig. 17b) and by making him an agrarian at ease with Latin botanical usage. When he's finally unmasked as \"Sir Gerald,\" there's been (literal) groundwork for a synthesis lacking in the play between classes and countries, rural and society life, peasant and aristocracy. And when Sir Gerald comes from England to Ireland, asking amid the goats for Peg's hand, it's consistent as a peace treaty capper to politics-as-melodrama. Vidor, like Peg herself, managed here to hold onto a bit of himself within an alien world. A second version of this storyline appears in Vidor's Happiness (1924), again based on a Hartley Manners play, and another vehicle for Laurette Taylor, with Brooklyn and uptown Manhattan standing in, respectively, for rural Ireland and England. Taylor's \"Jenny\" is another impoverished spitfire adopted by a bored socialite (Hedda Hopper) and given a dream future by marriage to yet another Renaissance man (\"I'm an electrician, and a musician, and a poet, and an inventor, and a lot of other things\"). The pattern was creaky in Peg o' My Heart and hardly bears repeating. But the parallels, and changes, do retain one interest: Vidor's political Populism, so tied to support of the country world, could grow into film populism, with its support of underdog vitality anywhere. His altered philosophy seems less arbitrary if one recalls how the Progressive movement tamed the reforms of the Populists into urban labor proposals. Happiness opens promisingly with what turns out to be the film's best sequence—a Thanksgiving Day dance on a Brooklyn side street, where a mix of nationalities and races compete casually, each dancing a few characteristic steps as Jenny, budding entrepreneur, passes through the crowd, collecting change in a tambourine. The sequence looks forward to Street Scene in both its facade staging and a certain stoopfront tension among the immigrant types. After a plotline of lost mothers and dying fathers that only Dickens could have pulled off, the coda puts Jenny, now settled into Coolidge-era business success, face-to-face with \"herself\"—another girl named Jenny, fresh off the Brooklyn streets, and as literally sniveling, but ambitious, as she once was. Vidor much later sheepishly admitted that the closing title (\"And the endless chain of Jennys goes on in all big cities . . .\") \"sounds very much like me at the time.\" 14 But not until The Crowd does his populist generalizing, forcing New York's \"little man\" face-to-face with a clown who is \"himself,\" find its coherent framework. Vidor's fondness for disguised or blatant religious themes in these early silents was nothing like the subject of such wonder among reviewers as it would be today. The surprising range of allowable philosophies narrowed with each year of silent filmmaking, but the real rigidification be-\n\n38\n\nKing Vidor, American\n\ngan with the initial Hays Code—essentially set in place by 1924 through the trade organization \" T h e M o t i o n Picture Producers and Distributors of America,\" following a series of Hollywood scandals in 1922. Only Vidor's lost Dusk to Dawn (1922) prompted unanimous critical response that his way with the philosophic had gotten the better of him. It does seem to have been a highly curious item, crafted to use existing footage of a huge procession in India. Florence Vidor plays a dual role as an American and an Indian who, somehow, share the same soul. When the American sleeps, her soul shuttles off to India, but she experiences her other life in the form of dreams, or through some sort of \"plasmic memory,\" to use the term of the Theosophists, w h o had done much to popularize Eastern notions of metempsychosis in America. Embarrassment over a bigamous soul is resolved when the Indian woman's husband the rajah dies and she throws herself on his pyre, thus freeing the American to marry her sweetheart. While Theosophical belief in faith healing parallels Christian Science, and Theosophical ideas about migrating souls have a c o m m o n source with the transcendentalists' fascination with the \"over-soul,\" perhaps Vidor didn't take these ideas too seriously. Even trade journals admitted that it was \"unusually hard . . . to follow\" and that, in any case, audiences wouldn't fall for the premise. \"Pretty deep stuff, as it were.\" 15 M o r e successful with its religious theme is a surviving film, The Sky Pilot (1921). For a variety of reasons its raving sentiment and clichés don't strike the predominant notes, and it remains a compelling melodrama, with some startling stuntwork and unconventional characterizations that set the Western genre on its ear. As it incorporates elements of both Vidor's early individualist faith and fondness for rural self-help, we'll use it to close out this look at his early political philosophy. When soft-jowled, clear-eyed John Bowers, in high-buttoned coat, bow tie, and umbrella, saunters into a \"primitive, godless\" small town, it looks like a stark clash. And when he's announced as a \"sky pilot\" (seaman's slang for preacher, but common in early Westerns), we anticipate a William S. Hart—style conflict between a minister's rigid, but fragile, puritanism and a rough cowpoke's flexible honor. An equally soft-faced preacher buggy-rides into a small town to open Hart's Travelin' On the same year, but with a shifty-eyed anxiety missing from Bowers's performance. The first surprise here is how the Pilot (as the cowboys call him) treats himself with the same lightness as Vidor's camera. He appreciates the joke of cowboys tip-toeing into the saloon-as-church in heavengazing, clasped-handed mock piety. From the first shot he's clearly not of the praise-the-lord-and-pass-the-ammunition Fighting Father D u n n e school. Neither is he an evangelical \"sin killer\" of the type Vidor later scrutinizes in Duel in the Sun and Ruby Gentry.\n\n1913 to 1925\n\n39\n\nFigure 18. By the waters of Swan Creek I sat down and wept, a: John Bowers (\"the Pilot\"); b: with David Butler (Bill), in The Sky Pilot (1921).\n\nHis loaves-and-fishes sermon ends in chaos with a fistfight a n d the cowboys pelting him with stones to the edge of t o w n ( \" H a r d ridin' and soft religion d o n ' t mix, M r . Parson\"). His despair clashes with a glistening stream (fig. 18a). W h e n Bill, the f o r e m a n , with w h o m he has f o u g h t , b u t w h o has admired his spunk, comes to ask forgiveness a n d offer w o r k as a c o w h a n d , there's a suggestive m o n t a g e of images as the Pilot turns Bill's other cheek, to wash off the blood f r o m their fight with river water, using the h a n k y that in the opening shots seemed one m o r e e m b l e m of his prissiness (fig. 18b). Already the film is well beyond w h a t the \" m y t h i c \" Western t o o k f r o m its literary model in O w e n Wister's The Virginian, w h e r e a minister's p u r i t a n rantings a b o u t innate sin provoke the Virginian to trick him off the ranch. There's a shifting of expectations in The Sky Pilot: its genre leads us to expect individualism t r i u m p h a n t ; a minister leads us to expect p u r i t a n ism embattled. But o u r h e r o turns out to possess a positive t h i n k i n g vitality that coalesces a g r o u p into a community. His ministry has such b l a s p h e m o u s f r e e d o m that it's fitting w h e n the cowboys secretly build him a church, with no cross in evidence and a horseshoe as pulpit icon. Transcendentalist ministry comes full circle w h e n Bill gives his o w n loaves-and-fishes sermon. A rustling scheme h a d been discovered by G w e n (Colleen M o o r e ) , daughter of the \" O l d T i m e r , \" w h o is in reluctant league with the outlaws, b u t in her attempt to w a r n the c o w h a n d s , she has been t h r o w n f r o m her horse and left p a r a l y z e d — a n d t h u s useless in the physical West. H e r desperate father pulls his Bible f r o m the fireplace, w h e r e he'd tossed it after having grown angry with a G o d t h a t w o u l d permit his wife's death, and pleads with the Pilot to pray over his d a u g h t e r . But we never see him give any o u t w a r d hint of prayer. H e has that within\n\n40\n\nK i n g Vidor, A m e r i c a n\n\nwhich passes show. His ministry is closer to psychiatry—helping a cowhand over the d.t.'s; explaining the nature of suffering to bedridden Gwen. Befitting a Western, he must prove himself physically, but the genre's expected machismo is finessed. The Pilot's wit is a match for Bill's attempt to disrupt the first loaves-and-fishes sermon (well, yes, \"that fella Jesus\" could liquor us up if he'd a mind t o — h e did turn water into wine), but he must immediately turn fighting padre by besting Bill. This is the classic Western hero's union of moral right with organic excellence, except that there's something about a long, almost equal fight that punctures the mythic West. Exhaustion is pacifism's intrusion by way of realism, as in the epic fistfight between Gregory Peck (as the pacifist sea captain out West) and Charlton Heston in William Wyler's The Big Country. Bill has recourse to the guns unavailable to God's man, though that's acknowledged as a false victory in the riverside scene. Still, Vidor succumbs to the weaknesses of the genre in avoiding all the worthy questions that could have come up if the Pilot had, as the casting of Bowers leads us to expect, been knocked cold by the first punch. His heroism against facial type valorizes a dangerous-looking stunt that succeeds because it's so clearly performed by Bowers himself: Gwen is knocked unconscious by the fall from her horse and the Pilot straddles her body, shooing off the stampeding cattle. Vidor recalled that he first filmed the stunt with a dummy, but it looked unconvincing, whereupon Bowers volunteered.\" 1 His soft face becomes tied to a courage antithetic to the genre's \"mythic\" bravado. From Hallelujah it's clear that Vidor was conscious of the temptations that seduce a merely vitalist ministry. The Sky Pilot is nowhere as fascinating as the 1 9 2 9 film, but it touches on the temptations with visual subtlety. Again William S. Hart provides a useful contrast. The minister in Hell's Hinges (1916) is seduced by woman's ways and by his own repression. It's the opposite of Hallelujah's temptation through vitality, and opposite also to the role of the woman in The Sky Pilot, who turns savior in pulling her parson from the water, without denying her sexuality. In the film's final moments, she recovers from paralysis in time to save him again, this time from the fire of his burning church. Colleen M o o r e had been in Westerns with Tom Mix, but she's used here with a knowing sophistication—straddling the Pilot as he lies unconscious and keeping a protective arm around him even after he's able to get on her horse. The intermittent sensuality of the film is doubly fascinating because of the genre's usual sexual sterility, and Vidor's mastery of the gestural stands out as it doesn't elsewhere. It's possible to imagine, from the example of the woman-shunning minister who dies in his burning church in Robert Altman's McCabe and Mrs. Miller, how a frontier minister could be beaten back by his community's sins into heartless pacifism.\n\n1913 to "
