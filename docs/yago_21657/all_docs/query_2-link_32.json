I like the old Broadway Cares one with Howard McGillin better.\n\n~Madame~\n\nRe: Love Never Dies - all views allowed\n\nstarryeyed Tue Feb 01, 2011 2:09 am\n\nNice to hear your opinions Helen.\n\nI wanted to post my own updated thoughts. I had an almost full cast (Friday) except Tam Mutu was The Phantom and Louise Madison was Fleck. First off, I think I may actually prefer both to their principal counterparts. Tam was a bit too similar to Ramin (in voice) to be markedly different but he carried himself better in my opinion. Louise also moved a lot better than Niamh as Fleck in my opinion.\n\nIn general I think, yes they have improved the show, I fully admit there's some bits I really love now. I like the new opening however I agree with Helen it drags from around the new \"Only For You\" up until \"Dear Old Friend.\" There's a really odd bit in the middle of act 1 that's a mish-mash of every POTO tune under the sun (apart from Masquerade) and I really did not like that Madame Giry/ Meg Giry now can't sing the \"Confronts the Phantom...\" actually to him, it makes the song very clunky. I quite liked the solo bit Meg did though about how excited she was for Christine to come to America. Now, I don't believe this is standard blocking but there was a bit in BAMS where Tam literally grabbed Sierra's waist and pulled her ummmm into him. I hope people get what that means but I really didn't like it, it was a bit too OTT in my opinion. I don't know about the Freaks now being present in TBU, it was a bit odd, they appeared to be miming along to the track but there was nothing they were actually singing, rather random.\n\nInterval: I heard one person say they liked it, one idiot saying that Ramin MUST be ill because they'd NEVER let him take a Friday night off would they, and I heard many many bad comments. \"Sequels never work\"...\"This is truly awful\"...\"I'm bored.\" I had two people near me who were partaking in such comments asleep by the end of it so they clearly didn't think it had improved. The shock of the evening was my mum, she who had the fabulous one liner last year turned and said to me \"I am really liking this.\" My jaw almost hit the floor, so ALW you have one full convert.\n\nThe second act was much the same as before, I think I liked the revised lyrics. Bathing Beauty was Bathing Beauty and I saw far more than you're meant to of Meg. That's what I get for sitting to the side. Sigh. Much of my opinions of Act 2 are as before, I liked it a lot more than the first act. I especially liked The Phantom's appearance in the dressing room, definitely one of the best of the show, he literally did seem to appear from nowhere.\n\nNow, the ending, in my opinion (despite the out of character letting her murderer go) it is a lot better now. It is also a lot more depressing, there is literally no happiness that can be taken from it. Joseph Millson is fabulous at the end, I admit I cried, I don't know why I think it was something about his mannerisms towards the end of the show really reminded me of my favourite Raoul and for the ending scene he looked utterly deflated. I couldn't help but think of that when the next night I watched as Will Barratt's Raoul went off in the boat looking longingly at Christine...\n\nRe: Love Never Dies - all views allowed\n\nScorp Tue Feb 01, 2011 8:57 am\n\noperafantomet wrote:\n\nThey both look like they're in their mid or late 20s... God, I don't know why it annoys me so much, but it does. Andrew Lloyd Webber's statement of \"Can't get away with a 30-year-old Phantom\" gave me some hope of a more grown up lead (or leads) in Australia. And then this? I mean, I think some of the casting for the original Phantom is too young. And this is 12 23 42 10 years later, right?\n\nPerhaps the reason why they have to cast so young despite ALW's recent comments is because no seasoned performer would go near it...\n\nRe: Love Never Dies - all views allowed\n\nstarryeyed Tue Feb 15, 2011 3:18 am\n\nNot that many people on here will really care but hey it's related to the topic, David Thaxton is going to be the new Raoul in Love Never Dies. I'm in two minds over this, with the new (more fleshed out and less \"messed up\" to put it lightly) Raoul characterization I think he could do a lot with the role. He is an extremely talented actor. However, after seeing him in Passion I'd really have liked to see him go into something else that required such intensity, I really thought he was fantastic with that and I just worry he may be a little wasted in Love Never Dies. On the other hand, it's nice to see him get a good run of principal roles\n\nRe: Love Never Dies - all views allowed\n\nScorp Tue Feb 15, 2011 10:27 am\n\nstarryeyed wrote:Not that many people on here will really care but hey it's related to the topic, David Thaxton is going to be the new Raoul in Love Never Dies.

Or gone back to Les Mis?\n\nSays something about the state of musical theatre if there are so few decent roles out there.\n\nBoth he and Joseph Millson are very talented actors. The material that they are having/going to have to perform is beneath them.\n\nRe: Love Never Dies - all views allowed\n\nstarryeyed Wed Feb 16, 2011 1:34 am\n\nCelia is being promoted to principal and Ramin is now staying until September (apparently; though it is almost definitely confirmed.)\n\nRe: Love Never Dies - all views allowed\n\nPMB1034 Wed Feb 16, 2011 2:01 am\n\nstarryeyed wrote:Celia is being promoted to principal and Ramin is now staying until September (apparently; though it is almost definitely confirmed.)\n\nI'd hoped that, however unlikely, Tam Mutu would get a crack. I know some people have quibbles over his youth but I just found his performance oh so compelling. His take connected with me more & afterwards I thought \"yeah that's it\". With Tam showing off for ALW a little closer than your average understudy at the Radio 2 concert - thought maybe his chances had improved.\n\nI'm surprised at Ramin staying tbh, a few folks I know who stage doored it said he implied he was ready for a break. As a relative fan of the piece, I think it would be a good thing for a change in lead...proving (or not as the case may be) that it can stand on it's own two feet, without the relatively starry names of Boggess & Karimloo.\n\nRe: Love Never Dies - all views allowed\n\nstarryeyed Wed Feb 16, 2011 2:28 am\n\nI know exactly what you mean, Ramin himself said to me he was looking forward to going back home and taking time out for a bit. However, recently there has indeed been a change in what he's been saying publically, maybe not put too much weight on it but he had been talking about his last show for a while and now you'd have to go back quite a bit to find a mention of it again.\n\nAdd to that Adelphi employees themselves have spoken out saying that this cast change has a few new faces, a few understudies being promoted and someone \"staying longer than they were supposed to. It seems to be he's now strangely not leaving, I can't think why but I guess we'd never know the reason behind it if it materialises.\n\nI completely agree on what you say about Tam, the thing with Ramin is I've always found when watching him (the few times in LND and previously in POTO) that it is very much \"Ramin playing The Phantom\" where when I saw Tam I genuinely did feel a bit more \"watching The Phantom on stage.\"\n\nRe: Love Never Dies - all views allowed\n\noperafantomet Wed Feb 16, 2011 6:52 am\n\nstarryeyed wrote:Celia is being promoted to principal and Ramin is now staying until September (apparently; though it is almost definitely confirmed.)\n\nTo be honest, I'm not surprised. I had a feeling Celia Graham would be bumped up. I know several said it's unlikely for understudies to get promoted, but I don't think there were too many alternatives. Somehow they need a well-known old-school Christine to tie it together, I don't think a brand new one would have worked at this point.\n\nMore surprised about Ramin Karimloo, I must admit. At best I would have thought he and Tam Mutu would share the role of Mr. Y. Karimloo has been off quite a bit, from what I've heard, and I had the feeling he had taken the role as far as he wanted. But I'm guessing he genuinely want to see the show pull through, and I guess there'll be fun times with the 25th anniversary of the original and all. But I'm also guessing a decent pay check is involved.\n\nWhat about the supporting characters - any big changes there?\n\nRe: Love Never Dies - all views allowed\n\nScorp Wed Feb 16, 2011 9:33 am\n\nThat Ramin is staying doesn't surprise me at all, actually. He's been nominated for a Larry and he hasn't got Broadway or Toronto to look forward to any more, plus he seems to be the one thing about this show that gets consistent raves, despite the age problem. Unlike PMB1034, I don't think this show can stand on its own two feet without a strong cast and I think the producers have realised that. There's even a rule for this production that Sierra and Ramin cannot be off at the same time -- what does that tell you about the quality of the show?\n\nAlso starryeyed, the whole \"this is Ramin playing the Phantom\" thing rather than \"this is the Phantom\" is exactly how I felt when seeing him at Her Majesty's.\n\nRe: Love Never Dies - all views allowed\n\nstarryeyed Wed Feb 16, 2011 2:16 pm\n\nWell I did actually think of the award thing too, I think either Ramin or David are guaranteed to win that category so they can be billed as \"winner\" and \"nominee\" if needs be to try drum up some extra publicity. Almost a, we have award winning cast members, the show can't be that bad sort of thing. And I'll re-iterate this is coming from someone who doesn't completely hate the show.\n\nAnd operafantomet, I've heard it's mainly understudy bumping with new people going into the ensemble. I know someone new (Charles Brunton) will be Gangle and I've heard Hayley Flaherty (from my hometown) is going to be Meg. She's been Roxie in Chicage and is very Lindsey Wise-ish for anyone who saw her in the original.\n\nRe: Love Never Dies - all views allowed\n\nstarryeyed Sun Feb 20, 2011 10:21 pm\n\nYes all the principals are leaving, and although we already knew this, Celia herself just confirmed that tomorrow if her first day of rehearsals as Christine.\n\nRe: Love Never Dies - all views allowed\n\nPMB1034 Mon Feb 21, 2011 10:13 pm\n\nTam Mutu confirmed as alternate = big bucket of win!\n\nhttp://www.loveneverdies.com/latest-news/love-never-dies-announces-new-cast/\n\nRe: Love Never Dies - all views allowed\n\nMasqPhan Wed Feb 23, 2011 7:01 pm\n\nTelegraph article on ALW. Thought this quote was interesting...\n\n“Of course there have been shows that could have worked better – Love Never Dies, for instance.” When it first opened, in March 2010, the show was extensively panned. Lloyd Webber then reworked it, hiring a new director and a new lyricist and reopening the Mark Two version last December. Earlier this month, it was nominated for seven Olivier awards.\n\n“We didn’t get that right to start with, although it’s much better now. But I’ve been fortunate enough always to have done the thing I loved – to make the kind of living out of it which has allowed me to indulge in things like this.”\n\nLinky\n\nRe: Love Never Dies - all views allowed\n\noperafantomet Wed Feb 23, 2011 7:16 pm\n\nMasqPhan wrote:“We didn’t get that right to start with, although it’s much better now.

Actually a peculiar thing to say, that it's \"much better now\". He's not saying it's brilliant, or even good, but it's \"much better\" than the original draft he's now trashing.
