        "text": "This is one I’ve been sitting on for a really long time. Since 2012, to be exact, when I was first given my copy of Australia’s production of the Phantom of the Opera sequel.\n\nWhen Lloyd Webber and Co announced that they would be bringing out a sequel to one of the most acclaimed musicals of all time I shared the opinion of many – “are they insane?”\n\nThey were going to expand a story that had been given a very definitive ending, and was already loved in its entirety by a vast percentage of the population. Why ruin such a beautiful thing by tarnishing it with a sequel?\n\nIt’s fair to say, like my fellow avid theatregoers, I was in denial at how such an abomination should be granted existence.\n\nThen I realised how wrong I was.\n\nThe very first time I listened to Ramin Karimloo sing ‘Til I Hear You Sing’, I was won. It is, without a doubt, one of the most well-written, enrapturing pieces of music I have ever had the pleasure to be introduced to. It’s heartfelt and agonising and truly captures the Phantom’s pain at being separated from the woman he loves. It’s as haunting as he is, and just as much of a masterpiece.\n\nSo I watched the trailer for Love Never Dies in London, and by God did it suck. The set was a mess, they’d not harnessed the same gothic feel as Phantom did, and the songs, while brilliant, weren’t quite audience-ready. Yet this one damn song just kept dragging me back to the promise of a better musical than what had been produced back in 2010.\n\nI waited patiently and my prayers were answered.\n\nThe Australian production of Love Never Dies directed by Brett Sullivan and Simon Phillips is the only version worth watching. It is a spectacle – a sensational reimagining of what the show should have been from the start.\n\nI now actually prefer Love Never Dies to Phantom of the Opera – I know, controversial, indeed.\n\nHere’s why:\n\nThe story\n\nI’m typically one to give away a lot of spoilers – especially when I’m critiquing shows and films – but this is one production I want people to actually give a go, so I won’t reveal as much as I usually would, though a lot of it is relatively predictable following the events of its prequel.\n\nSo, where we’ve left off with Phantom is that the Phantom captured Christine, took her down into his “dungeon of my black despair” and essentially blackmailed her to love him and stay with him or he’d kill Raul who comes to try and save her. That’s the Phantom we all know and love: ‘Marry me, or I’ll murder your boyfriend…’ Anyway, regardless, Christine shows some sympathy for Phantom (or to those who know the original story, Erik), and he’s suddenly overcome with guilt and lets both her and Raul escape. He then swiftly disappears, never to be seen again. Applause.\n\nLove Never Dies then picks up some 10 years later, where on Coney Island, NY, Phantom is desperately suffering being apart from Christine and decides to hatch a plan to bring her back. Under the guise of a sideshow owner, Mr. Y, he manages to trick her into coming to Coney Island to sing for him one last time. She’s a highly successful opera star, Raul is a gambling drunk, and they both have a little boy called Gustave. Without giving too much away, that is pretty much the story. There’s a side-plot with Meg and Madame Giry, who followed Phantom to Coney Island and now work for him – Meg basically wants all of his attention, but because he still loves Christine, she’s getting none of it.\n\nBecause of the sheer gap of time this show leaves since the original, the storyline really does work. It’s very cleverly handled, and you get a very different impression of the characters as they have grown, or not in some cases, over the years.\n\nThe characters\n\nChristine\n\nIn LND, we see Christine no longer as a naive victim, but rather as a mature, caring and rather wise mother-figure, which only demonstrates her resilience and strength given everything that happened to her in her youth. She’s far more responsible and less easily led – in fact it could even be said that the power play shifts entirely. Phantom is no longer the one holding all of the cards, instead Christine is the defiant one with a lot more sway than she ever had. Anna O’Byrne plays her like a dream. She’s sometimes coy and obedient to her abusive husband Raul, but equally as admirable and courageous when faced with adversity. She’s torn between two men, but makes her own decisions as to who is worthy of her affection.\n\nRaul\n\nRaul is a fantastic character in this continuation of the beloved story. He’s a sort-of-hero in the prequel Phantom, but let’s be honest, ladies, you’d always choose Phantom over Raul. Why? Because Raul’s too devoted, too flippant about the whole situation – it’s almost as if his interest in Christine has ulterior motives, beyond getting into her pants. He’s just that nice boyfriend you had once that is great to please the folks but doesn’t really get the heart racing.\n\nIn Love Never Dies he becomes far more interesting. There’s a lot of self-deprecation there – he gambles his life away, so much so that Christine’s career has to save him from the debts he’s accrued, and is never without a drink or else the mention of going to a bar. His main song in LND is ‘Why does she love me?’, recognising that he’s not the man he was and can’t live up to Christine’s expectations. It seems that her foray with the Phantom took more of a toll on him than once thought, and that he feels like a bit of a second banana to the enigmatic musical genius. Best character in the show.\n\nPhantom\n\nThere have been a lot of mixed reviews about how the Phantom is portrayed in LND. The main complaint seems to be that he’s not as gritty or powerful as he was in the musical of his namesake. Which, to an extent, I agree with. He’s not. He’s still ambiguous and morose and a little psychotic, but admittedly, the fear that he once created amongst audiences is severely lacking. But look at it from his perspective – he is completely beaten. He’s been apart from the woman of his dreams for ten long years, and is at the end of his tether, so he tries one last ditch attempt to see her again. He’s putting all of his eggs into one basket, and doesn’t have anything left to lose. Maybe he doesn’t have that same fire and passion as he once did, because he’s setting himself up, yet again, for potential rejection. And there is plenty of fire between him and Raul in the racy number ‘Devil Take the Hindmost’, wherein they practically throw down a gauntlet at each other. Give the man a break.\n\nGustave\n\nGustave is probably the only thing in the show that I’d consider losing. He is literally just an annoying child. He runs off a lot, gets himself into trouble, and is the type of kid that turns on the heroes in a horror movie. Unfortunately, he’s a key plot element, so has to stay.\n\nMadame and Meg Giry\n\nI’m doubling up here because they’re practically the same. Meg Giry is great in this musical – she’s not the wet sidekick who kisses Christine’s boots and yells “He’s here, the phantom of the opera!” every five minutes, but is a seriously messed up and unstable wannabe star who wants nothing more than the Phantom to watch her perform. This creates lovely tension between her and Christine, whose shadow she’s lived under her whole life. She’s also exceptionally played by Sharon Millerchip.\n\nThe relationship that evolves between Madame Giry and the Phantom is one of the most interesting of all. Giry feels as though she is responsible for Phantom’s survival from the attack on the opera house ten years ago, having “concealed him safe away, smuggled him up to Calais” and “helped him buy his first sideshow” when he was really down on his luck. She thinks she is owed for this kindness, and fully expects him to give over control of the sideshow to her and Meg. The faux-French accent from actress Maria Mercedes isn’t great, but what she lacks in accent she makes up with in presence and influence.\n\nThe set\n\nI’m not usually a huge fan of sets – I like my imagination to do most of the work, but this was something else. I’d never seen anything like it on stage. In particular, the way in which the number ‘Beauty Underneath’ is staged is creepy and confusing and oddly enthralling, with towering prisms containing the Phantom’s freaks spinning around the characters with remarkable vigor. The circus tent, too, at the very beginning of the musical during the number ‘Coney Island Waltz’ is also very cleverly choreographed, opening up to reveal an intricate revolving carousel.\n\nMy favourite set piece, however, is Christine and Raul’s hotel apartment. It is stunning. Perfectly designed for the sophisticated lifestyle of a well-to-do power couple, with elaborate, intricate mirrored doors and an elegant baby grand. This also later revolves to reveal a beautiful balcony that becomes the perfect setting for an intimate number between Christine and Erik, ‘Once Upon Another Time’. It’s a truly gorgeous feast for the eyes throughout – but knows its limits – stalling in occasional minimalism to capture the stillness and emotion that surrounds the characters’ interweaving lives.\n\nThe music\n\nThe music in this musical is incredible. From start to finish. Some songs are perhaps not in-keeping with the same brooding tone as Phantom, but nonetheless, each has a place. The only song I’d say really sticks out like a sore thumb is ‘Bathing Beauty’ – it’s far too upbeat and has no real relation to the rest of the story, other than it’s Meg’s big shot to sing for the Phantom and relates to the seaside setting of Coney Island.\n\nBut in spite of this small step out of the Phantom zone, the rest of the score does align very nicely with the original, without relying too heavily on repeating the same melodies all the way through. In fact it does this exceedingly subtly – it’s very difficult to pick apart which bits of the score actually nod to the prequel and which are brand new.\n\nThe set-up of the song ‘Dear Old Friend’ is clever and witty, and reminiscent of the same overlapping conversational wordplay as ‘Notes’ or ‘Masquerade’ in Phantom. The quartet also highlights the underlying bitterness between Meg, Mme. Giry, Raul and Christine of being reunited in such mitigating circumstances.\n\nThe greatest song in the musical, though, apart from ‘Til I Hear You Sing’, which I’ve already praised to death, is the duet ‘Beneath a Moonless Sky’. It swells and quickens, then slows and softens, and plays haphazardly with its dynamics until you feel as though you’re spinning in some sort of wild hurricane of mixed emotions. It gives you a glimpse into what could have been if only Christine had stayed with Phantom, willingly. It is overflowing with feeling, and unbelievable passion.\n\nWatch out, also, for the number ‘Before the Performance’ – it is a magical display of the turbulent love triangle.\n\nThe Secret of the Opera\n\nMy absolute favourite fact about Love Never Dies is how Andrew Lloyd Webber manages to tie the two stories together in the 25th anniversary production of Phantom of the Opera. This starred both Ramin Karimloo and Sierra Boggess – the two original cast members of the debut run of Love Never Dies in London, who played the Phantom and Christine respectively and can be heard on the soundtrack.\n\nI don’t know for sure that this was Lloyd Webber’s call, but I like to think that it was. If you watch the 25th anniversary of POTO very carefully, you will see that just before Christine is addressed by the Phantom with ‘Insolent boy! This slave of fashion, basking in your glory’, she says the line “Things have changed Raul”. Now, I’m not sure that this has ever been part of the script before now (if so, please do let me know in the comments section, I’d love to find out), but it wasn’t in the script of the 2004 Joel Schumacher film.\n\nIn Love Never Dies, just after the Phantom has visited Christine in their hotel room, Raul returns in a foul mood, and what does Christine say? “Things have changed Raul”. Shivers.\n\nEven better than that is what happens right at the end of the 25th anniversary production of Phantom. When Christine and Raul are about to leave the Phantom during the Finale, instead of them singing the reprise of ‘All I Ask of You’ to each other, Christine actually stops on her way up the stairs and begins singing behind her – directing the song to Phantom, not to Raul. Raul has to come in and essentially convince her to leave with him! This is a beautiful, barely noticeable piece of direction that leaves the ending far more open to interpretation.\n\nSo what’s missing?\n\nThe delivery of certain lines is stinted – particularly by Ben Lewis, who plays our Aussie Phantom. The way he says “Oh, but I can – believe me, a man as hideous as this is capable of anything” is unfortunately laughable. He also plays the part just a little too pathetically – the strength we expect from the Phantom is lost on occasion due to this.\n\nIt seems to me that the one integral thing missing from Love Never Dies is comic relief. There isn’t any. It’s gruelling, and heavy, and deep, but there is no real light to alleviate the impending darkness of the story.\n\nWhere in Phantom, you have Monsieur Andre and Monsieur Firman, not to mention La Carlotta, as relatively prominent and humorous characters, in Love Never Dies, it’s comparatively all doom and gloom.\n\nThe Verdict"
