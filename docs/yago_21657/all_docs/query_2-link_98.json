        "text": "Share this Article:\n\nFollowing the huge success of Phantom Of The Opera’s release, Andrew Lloyd Webber will be making Love Never Dies available for free streaming on Friday.\n\nThe ongoing programme of free musicals being made available on YouTube by Andrew Lloyd Webber has proven a staggering success. Last week, the 25th anniversary concert of Phantom Of The Opera was made available for free, and some 11 million views have been notched up.\n\nThe idea is that Lloyd Webber will make a recording of one of his musicals available for free each Friday, and it’s now been announced what’s coming this week.\n\nIt’s the sequel of sorts to Phantom, Love Never Dies, that’s going to be available. It’ll go live on Friday April 24th at 7pm, and will be available for 48 hours for free streaming.\n\nIt’s a recording that was done in 2012 that’s going to be shown, with Ben Lewis and Annie O’Byrne in the lead roles.\n\nYou’ll find the show at the The Shows Must Go On YouTube channel, here.\n\nAnd we’ll leave you with the official synopsis…\n\nFrom the composer of some of the greatest musicals of all time, comes Andrew Lloyd Webber’s breathtaking new musical – Love Never Dies.\n\nDirected by Simon Phillips, with spectacular set and costume designs by Gabriela Tylesova and choreography by Graeme Murphy, Love Never Dies was the winner of 3 prestigious 2010 Helpmann Awards for Best Scenic Design, Best Costume Design and Best Lighting Design.\n\nLove Never Dies continues the story of The Phantom of the Opera… featuring one of Lloyd Webber’s finest musical scores performed by a 21 piece orchestra, a stunning cast of 36 including Ben Lewis and Anna O’Byrne, over 300 incredible costumes and a magnificent set illuminated by over 5000 dazzling light bulbs.\n\nThe year is 1907. It is 10 years after his disappearance from the Paris Opera House and the Phantom has escaped to a new life in New York where he lives amongst the screaming joy rides and freak-shows of Coney Island.\n\nIn this new electrically-charged world, he has finally found a place for his music to soar. All that is missing is his love – Christine Daaé.\n\nNow one of the world’s finest sopranos, Christine is struggling in an ailing marriage to Raoul. So, it is with excitement she accepts an invitation to travel to New York and perform at a renowned opera house. In a final bid to win back her love, the Phantom lures Christine, her husband, and their young son Gustave from Manhattan, to the glittering and glorious world of Coney Island… not knowing what is in store for them….\n\nImage: Really Useful Group\n\n—\n\nThank you for visiting!
