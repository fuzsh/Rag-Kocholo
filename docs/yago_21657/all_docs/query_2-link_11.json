        "text": "After a mixed London reception in 2010, Lloyd Webber gave his blessing for a new Australian creative team to take a fresh look at the lushly scored musical, which now takes a darker, more menacing approach to the physical production.\n\nPriscilla Queen of the Desert director Simon Phillips staged the Coney Island-set sequel, which first premiered at the Regent Theatre in Melbourne last spring. It will officially open in Sydney Jan. 12, 2012, for a run through April 1, 2012.\n\nNBC Universal Pictures International filmed the Melbourne production of Love Never Dies, which will be released globally on DVD and Blu-ray Feb. 1, 2012.\n\nThe original Melbourne cast will make the Sydney transfer, with the addition of local boy sopranos to take on the role of Gustav.\n\nLove Never Dies has a score by Lloyd Webber and lyrics by Tony nominee Glenn Slater (Sister Act, The Little Mermaid). The book is by Lloyd Webber, Ben Elton and Slater. Phantom lyricist Charles Hart is also credited with additional lyrics for the latest incarnation of the sequel. Ben Lewis, who appeared in the original Australian casts of Priscilla Queen of the Desert and Spamalot, stars as the Phantom, opposite Anna O'Byrne as soprano Christine Daa√©. O'Byrne previously played the role in an Australian tour of The Phantom of the Opera.\n\nJoining them are Sharon Miller Chip, who originated the role of young ballerina Meg Giry in the Australian premiere of Phantom, and returns to the role for the sequel; Simon Gleeson as Raoul; and Maria Mercedes as Madame Giry.\n\nThe cast also features Emma J. Hawkins as Fleck, Paul Tabone as Squelch and Dean Vince as Gangle.\n\nCompleting the ensemble are Andrew Broadbent, Renee Burleigh, Colin Dean, Andrew Dunne, Giordano Gangl, Stephanie Grigg, Erin Hasan, Matt Holly, Ben Hudson, Erin James, Adele Johnston, Claire Lyon, Kristy Mackenzie, Matthew McFarlane, Jessica Mechielsen, Meredith O'Reilly, Adam Rennie, Lisa Reynolds, Pharic Scott, Kathryn Sgroi, Ellen Simpson, Tod Strike and Brendan Yeates.\n\nLove Never Dies has choreography by Graeme Murphy, with new set and costume designs by Gabriela Tylesova. The production has lighting by Nick Schlieper (War of the Roses, Priscilla Queen of the Desert), with original London sound designer Mick Potter and orchestrator David Cullen also on board. Guy Simpson (The Phantom of the Opera) serves as musical supervisor.\n\nSet ten years after the conclusion of The Phantom of the Opera, Love Never Dies follows soprano Christine Daae to New York's Coney Island, where she is invited to perform for the mysterious Mr. Y. Characters from her past begin to emerge, including one with whom she shares a dark secret."
