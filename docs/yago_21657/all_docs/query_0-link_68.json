        "text": "2 April\n\nSodom and Gomorrah: The Legend of Sin and Punishment (Dir. Michael Curtiz, Aust, 1922) (Screening format – not known, 180(?) mins) In 1920s America, Mary, a young girl exposed from her infancy to evil influences, is in love with Harry, a sculptor, but for the sake of financial gain becomes engaged to be married to the rich banker Jackson Harber, a much older man, and the former lover of her mother. Harry attempts suicide. By her subsequent behaviour, including her attempted seduction not only of Harber’s adolescent son, Eduard, but also of Eduard’s tutor, a priest, Mary drives Harber to the verge of suicide as well. But as Mary sleeps, her dreams cast her back first as the queen of ancient Syria and then as Lia, the wife of lot and we witness the wickedness and destruction of Sodom. Made on an epic scale, Sodom and Gomorrah rivals not only earlier Italian blockbusters such as Quo Vadis or Cabiria but also the work of Griffith and de Mille in Hollywood, with estimates of a cast and crew of up to 14,000 people and a main set towering 230feet high. Then there was the pyrotechnician, missing fingers from both hands and part of his nose due to earlier accidents, but who still handled explosives with an air of casualness….and with a lighted cigar in his mouth. In charge of all this, director Curtiz apparently had little regard for the money he was spending or the well being of cast and crew. The end result was a three hour monster, eventually cut down as a result of marketing and censorship issues to little more than 90 minutes. Long thought to have survived in just fragments, a restored version of the film now runs to around 140 minutes. To find out more go to encyclopedia.com. With live musical accompaniment. Austrian Cultural Forum, London SW7 Link\n\n3 April\n\nAnother evening of 9.5mm films from Kevin Brownlow’s collection. As regular attendees will know, 9.5mm was the pioneering amateur film gauge that enabled film enthusiasts to make and project their own films and also screen commercial popular films of the day in their own homes. The 9.5mm gauge preserved many subjects that are now either lost or difficult to obtain in 35mm. 9.5mm has a frame size similar to 16mm and was usually copied from the original 35mm elements, thus providing superb quality images. Highlights tonight will include the German mountain drama The White Hell of Piz Palu (1929), directed by Arnold Fanck and G. W. Pabst, starring Leni Riefenstahi, Gustav Diessl, Ernst Petersen, and World War 1 flying ace Ernst Udet; and the 1927 French drama La Glu, directed by Henri Fescourt (Les Miserables (1925)), with Germaine Rouer and Francois Rozet in the lead roles. Presented by the Kennington Bioscope. With live piano accompaniment. Cinema Museum, Lambeth, London Link\n\n6 April\n\nKing of Kings (Dir. Cecil B DeMille, US, 1927) (Screening format – not known, 120mins) King of Kings is the Greatest Story Ever Told as only Cecil B. DeMille could tell it. In 1927, working with one of the biggest budgets in Hollywood history, DeMille spun the life and Passion of Christ into a silent-era blockbuster. Featuring text drawn directly from the Bible, a cast of thousands, and the great showman’s singular cinematic bag of tricks, the film is at once spectacular and deeply reverent—part Gospel, part Technicolor epic. King of Kings was first released in the spring of 1927, and it was the middle chapter in a sort of informal biblical trilogy that DeMille produced, beginning with the original, silent version of The Ten Commandments (1923) and ending with the early talkie The Sign of the Cross (1932), which depicts Nero’s persecution of the early Christians. Despite being a silent film itself, The King of Kings remained popular well into the sound era, so much so that no other major Hollywood movie about the life of Christ was made for over 30 years, until Nicholas Ray directed the similarly-titled King of Kings in 1961.

He is entranced by the beautiful mission worker and organist, Edna Purviance. Passing a police recruiting notice he decides to join but his ‘beat’ is Easy Street, terrorised by giant bully Eric Campbell! Upon its release, Easy Street was hailed as a watershed moment in Chaplin’s career. Find out more at silentsaregolden.com. In Angora Love (Dir. Lewis R Foster, US, 1929) Laurel and Hardy are adopted by a runaway goat, whose noise and aroma in turn get the goat of their suspicious landlord.

Maurice Elvey, UK, 1928) (Screening format – 35mm, 94mins) Cinderella is at the wrong kind of Ball in this romance of a night-watchman’s daughter who takes a job as ‘No.16’ in a sleazy London dance hall. Maurice Elvey is at his best in this lively drama with nice Mabel Poulton and naughty Chilli Bouchier.

Franz Osten, 1928) (Screening format – not known, 118mins) Based on a play by Indian author Niranjan Pal, Shiraz tells the fictionalised love story of the 17th-century princess who inspired the construction of the Taj Mahal. It was directed by Germany’s Franz Osten, one of at least 17 films he made in India between 1925 and 1939, best known of which are The Light of Asia (1925) and A Throw of Dice (1929). Shot entirely on location in India with an all-Indian cast, it features lavish costumes and gorgeous settings – all the more impressive in this restoration by the BFI National Archive with specially-commisioned score. The film was the brainchild of producer Himansu Rai, who also stars as humble potter Shiraz, who follows his childhood sweetheart (Enakshi Rama Rau) when she’s sold by slave traders to the future emperor (Charu Roy).Upon its release Shiraz was a considerable critical and popular success and received rave reviews when the restored version was screened at the 2017 London Film Festival.

Taking in maharajas and viceroys, fakirs and farmhands, as well as personalities such as Sabu and Gandhi, this compilation by award-winning filmmaker Sandhya Suri explores not only the people and places of over 70 years ago but asks us to engage with broader themes of a shared history, shifting perspectives in the lead up to Indian independence and the ghosts of the past.

William Haggar, UK, 1914) + Jessica’s First Prayer (Dir. Bert Wynn, UK, 1921) (Screening format – Digital/35mm, 40/38 mins) The Maid of Cefn Ydfa is a traditional Welsh folk tale of the thwarted romance between a thatcher and an heiress in 17th-century Cefn Ydfa. Long believed lost, an incomplete nitrate print in poor condition was discovered in 1984. The print was found in the stairwell of a house near Swansea and was donated to the BFI National Archive by a descendant of the filmmaker’s family. Jessica’s First Prayer is an unknown drama starring Warrick Ward. Presented as part of the British Silent Film Festival Symposium. With live musical accompaniment. King’s College, London Link\n\nKing of Kings (Dir. Cecil B DeMille, US, 1927) (Screening format – not known, 155mins) It was the biggest silent-era blockbuster of its time. The film blended spectacle and reverence, with text taken directly from the Bible and featuring a cast of thousands. The film cost at least $1,265,000 (inflated by press agents to $2,300,000), with sets and crowd scenes rivaling D.W. Griffith’s Intolerance (1916) in scale and ornateness. The King of Kings is the height of cinematic and photographic sophistication in 1920s Hollywood. This brand new restoration from Lobster Films, Paris, is scanned in 4K direct from the tinted nitrate, as well as surviving two-colour Technicolor footage from UCLA Film & Television Archive, with a few brief shots from other sources. This new restoration also features a digital recreation of the hand-coloured effects from Gustav Brock, which have likewise not been seen since 1927. When it comes to Cecil B. DeMille’s King of Kings, seeing is believing! Find out more at criterion.com.. With live organ accompaniment by David Bednall. Bristol Cathedral, Bristol Link\n\n12 April\n\nThe City Without Jews (aka Die Stadt ohne Juden) (Dir. Hans Karl Breslauer, Aus, 1924) (Screening format – not known, 80mins) A dystopian prophecy of intolerance, Die Stadt ohne Juden is ominous, portentous, and completely unforgettable. H K Breslauer’s satirical dystopia shows the cultural and economic impoverishment of a city that expels its Jewish population, and is disturbingly prophetic in its depiction of the murderous anti-semitism in Vienna in the wake of the First World War. And the story of the film is almost as remarkable as its content. Lost during the Second World War, this version was only rediscovered in a Paris flea market in 2015. The political message is more sharply articulated in this newly restored version, with a hitherto lost ending and other sequences. For anyone interested in 20th-century history, this Austrian expressionist film is essential viewing.Find out more at theguardian.com. Presented by South West Silents.

Buster Keaton/Edward F Cline, 1921) + Neighbours (Dir.

When his fiancée (Kathryn McGuire) is robbed by a local thief (Ward Crane), the poor projectionist is framed for the crime.

Disheartened, he returns to his movie theatre, where he falls asleep and dreams that he is the great Sherlock Holmes.

While trying to prevent a robbery Buster is caught with a gun stuck in one hand and cash stuck to the other, leading the owner of the bank to suspect Buster of the crime. But when Buster takes refuge in a supposedly haunted house which is also doubling as the hideout for his crooked co-worker and gang the fun really starts.

Fred C Newmeyer/Sam Taylor, US, 1925) (Screening format – not known, 76mins) Harold Lloyd’s biggest box-office hit was this silent comedy gem, featuring the befuddled everyman at his eager best as a new college student. Though he dreams of being a big man on campus, the freshman’s careful plans inevitably go hilariously awry, be it on the football field or at the Fall Frolic. But he gets a climactic chance to prove his mettle—and impress the sweet girl he loves—in one of the most famous sports sequences ever filmed.

Director Schnéevoigt (cinematographer on a number of Carl Dreyer films including The Parson’s Widow), captures the imposing vastness of the stunning snow and ice landscape, the fascinating way of life of a still beleaguered minority people, and the intimate narrative of a father who sacrifices his own happiness for that of his daughter.

When Paul goes to complain to Georgette and Maurice, he realizes that she is an old flame. Thus begins a series of marital mishaps that try the fidelity of both couples. When Ernst Lubitsch joined Warner Brothers in 1923 with a three-year, six-picture deal, he moved away from the kind of historical epics he had produced previously in Germany and began a remarkable series of marital comedies that earned him the reputation of Hollywood’s most elegant and sophisticated director, encapsulated in “the Lubitsch touch.” Like Cecil B. DeMille before him, Lubitsch became the foremost commentator of gender relations in the Jazz Age. So This is Paris, the last film on his Warners contract, is a trifle, but light as a feather and twice as funny. Credited as the first film to feature a choreographed dance scene, as one couple (Patsy Ruth Miller and Monte Blue) enter a Charleston contest. Voted one of the ten best films of 1926 by the New York Times. Find out more atsensesofcinema.com. Presented as part of the Kennington Bioscope Silent Comedy Weekend. Introduced by Michelle Facey.

G W Pabst, Ger, 1929) (Screening format – not known, 135mins) Based on two plays by the German author Frank Wedekind, Erdgeist (Earth Spirit, 1895), which Pabst himself had directed for the stage, and Die Büchse der Pandora (Pandora’s Box, 1904), the silent drama follows Pthe tumultuous life of the showgirl Lulu whose unselfconscious sexuality brings about the ruin of all those that fall for her and eventually her own. In a daring move, Pabst chose a little known American actress over the more experienced Marlene Dietrich for the part of Lulu, a decision that made the young Louise Brooks an international star. Her innocent looks paired with her natural erotic allure and sense of movement – Brooks was also a dancer – perfectly matched Pabst’s idea of his heroine as unwitting seductress. Subjected to cuts to eliminate some of its “scandalous” content and unfavourably reviewed by critics at the time, it is now considered one of the boldest and most modern films of the Weimar era highlighting Pabst’s command of camera language and montage.

Karel Lamac, Cz, 1924) (Screening format – not known, 73mins) The heroine of this social melodrama, set in a desolate region “where people were born with solitude in their hearts”, is the naive orphan Nina (Anna Ondry), who stumbles upon an escaped prisoner intent on seeing his dying mother one last time. With its classic story and advanced technical quality, this low-budget picture was a hit with audiences both at home and abroad. Its success was due in part to the involvement of Der starke Vierer (the strong four), one of the most distinctive creative teams to come out of early Czechoslovak cinema: director and actor Karel Lamač, cameraman Otto Heller, actress Anny Ondra and, later on, scriptwriter Václav Wasserman.

Featuring some of Buster’s finest and most dangerous stunts, it’s a health and safety nightmare maybe but it’s entertainment that will live forever. The final storm sequence is still as breathtaking today as it was on first release. Not a commercial success at the time, this is now rightly regarded as a Keaton classic. Find out more at Wikipedia.
