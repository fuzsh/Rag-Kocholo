        "text": "Prepare to be transported to New York’s iconic Coney Island where the masked Phantom of the Opera is eagerly awaiting your arrival! Love Never Dies, Andrew Lloyd Webber’s spellbinding sequel to The Phantom of the Opera, plays Starlight Theatre for six performances, Aug. 14–19.\n\nSet 10 years after the Phantom of the Opera’s disappearance from the Paris Opera House, Love Never Dies follows the Phantom’s new life in New York where he lives among the joy rides and freak shows of Coney Island. Although he has finally found peace and acceptance within his new world, the Phantom still desperately yearns for his one true love and musical protégée, Christine Daaé. Now an internationally-acclaimed soprano, Christine receives an invitation to open Oscar Hammerstein I’s new Manhattan opera house. With her marriage to Raoul crumbling and the couple’s finances on the brink, Christine jumps at the chance and travels from Paris to New York with her young family and the hope of a fresh start.\n\nIn a final attempt to win back Christine’s love, the Phantom lures her, Raoul and their young son, Gustave, from Manhattan to the glittering and glorious world of Coney Island. Will the Phantom succeed in his romantic endeavor or has his chance at love passed “The Point of No Return?”\n\nWith a soaring new score by legendary composer Andrew Lloyd Webber and direction by Simon Phillips, Love Never Dies takes audiences on a thrilling roller coaster ride of intrigue, obsession and romance. Be entranced by the musical’s beautifully poetic score featuring such songs as “Beneath a Moonless Sky,” “Love Never Dies,” “The Beauty Underneath” and “Til I Hear You Sing.”\n\nSince its premiere in 2010, Love Never Dies has enjoyed productions worldwide in London, Australia, Denmark, Japan and Germany, as well as multiple cast recordings. A DVD release of the Australian production has delighted fans globally, and now the North American tour brings the musical to the US for the first time. The Telegraph dubbed Love Never Dies as “One of the greatest of all Andrew Lloyd Webber musicals,” while Sunday Express called the show “A masterpiece.”\n\nDirect from playing Raoul in the long-running production of The Phantom of the Opera on Broadway, Bronson Norris Murphy stars as the Phantom in Love Never Dies. Murphy previously appeared in the 30th Anniversary Company of Cats (Gus, Growltiger and Bustopher Jones) and in multiple US productions of West Side Story (Tony). Meghan Picerno portrays songstress Christine Daaé. Much like her character, Picerno’s operatic talents have taken her across the world with select performances at the Canadian Institute of Vocal Arts Festival in Montreal, the Barcelona Opera Studio’s summer concert series and the iSing Festival at The National Center of Performing Arts in Beijing, China.\n\nLove Never Dies opens at Starlight Theatre on Tuesday, Aug. 14 and runs for six performances through Sunday, Aug. 19. All shows start at 8 p.m. Tickets start at $14 and are available at www.kcstarlight.com, by calling 816.363.7827 or visiting the ticket office at 4600 Starlight Road, Kansas City, Mo., 64132.\n\nCan’t wait for the tour?
