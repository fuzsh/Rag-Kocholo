        "text": "1921 film\n\nLove Never DiesDirected byKing VidorWritten byKing Vidor (adaptation)Based on\"The Cottage of Delight\"\n\nby William Nathaniel HarbenProduced byCathrine CurtisStarringLloyd HughesCinematographyMax DupontDistributed byAssociated Producers\n\nRelease date\n\nRunning time\n\n60 minutesCountryUnited StatesLanguageSilent (English intertitles)\n\nLove Never Dies is a 1921 American silent drama film directed by King Vidor.[1] Prints of the film survive in several film archives.[2]\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nAs described in a film magazine,[3] John Trott (Hughes) overcomes the bad influence of a wretched home, becomes successful as a contracting engineer, and marries the beautiful Tilly Whaley (Bellamy). They settle down to a happy existence in their own cottage. Then a specter of his past appears, a drunken mother, and during his absence his wife is rushed home by her sanctimonious father Ezekiel Whaley (Brownlee) and is granted a divorce. John, accompanied by his foster sister, goes to a distant city. En route, the train is wrecked and he reports himself and the child killed. His wife marries a former sweetheart. Years later, John returns to the town and old love is renewed. The jealous husband attempts to kill John but is whipped in the encounter. The husband then decides to kill himself and is successful, despite John's valiant attempt to stop him. The couple are then reunited in their \"cottage of delight.\"\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nLloyd Hughes as John Trott\n\nMadge Bellamy as Tilly Whaley\n\nJoseph Bennett as Joel Eperson\n\nLillian Leighton as Mrs. Cavanaugh\n\nFred Gamble as Sam Cavanaugh (credited as Fred Gambold)\n\nJulia Brown as Dora Boyles\n\nFrank Brownlee as Ezekiel Whaley\n\nWinifred Greenwood as Jane Holder\n\nClaire McDowell as Liz Trott\n\nMaxine Elliott Hicks as Dora Boyles as a Teenager (uncredited)\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nVidorâ€™s spectacular cattle stampede in his previous picture The Sky Pilot (1921) was admired by critics. Hoping to capitalize on that success, Vidor designed and built an elaborate model replica of a train and trestle and used it to stage a dramatic derailment. Impressed by this special effect demonstration, Thomas H. Ince agreed to finance the completion of Love Never Dies.[4][5]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nBaxter, John. 1976. King Vidor.
