        "text": "“Love Never Dies,” Andrew Lloyd Weber’s sequel to “The Phantom Of The Opera,” played a limited engagement at Houston’s Hobby Center For Peforming Arts in Houston, TX from June 17-22nd after a run in Hamburg, Germany.\n\nThis version of “Love Never Dies” was re-written after the original was released in 2010.\n\nThe opening revealed that the Phantom, played by Bronson Norris Murphy, is not dead but instead has escaped to New York and lives amongst the freak shows and joy rides of Coney Island, where he still pines for his love Christine.\n\nWhen The Phantom finds out that his obsession Christine (Meghan Picerno) has been invited to New York to perform at a famous Opera House, he devises a plot to lure Christine, husband Raoul (Sean Thompson) and young son Gustav (Jake Heston Miller) to Coney Island.\n\nThe Phantom easily lures Raoul away from Christine long enough to drop in on her (through her mirror of course, in keeping with the style he’s known for) at her hotel room. He proposes that if she sings for him at his venue, he will double the price being offered by the more famous house.\n\nMeghan Picerno delights with her incredibly strong vocals as she sings her way through the intrigue, romance and obsession of a relationship with a man who, as it turns out, left her with more than even he knew. It’s easy to guess what that was as the plot thickens – her young son Gustav displays some strange tendencies, and is very unlike his father Raoul. Raoul for his part maintains an emotional distance from Gustav, preferring drinking and gambling to family duties.\n\nThe score is tremendous, as to be expected with Andrew Lloyd Webber, the set is sumptuous, and the vocals are at times truly astounding.\n\nBut nowadays with the #metoo movement in full swing, The Phantom of The Opera and his ilk are more likely either behind bars or headed for a courtroom date for less shenanigans than what is perpetrated on the object of his affection – but with that being said, a production of “The Phantom of The Opera” will come to Houston as part of a brand new North American Tour for the 2018-2019 season.\n\nFor more information, please visit www.loveneverdies.com.\n\nCameron Mackintosh’s spectacular new production of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERAwill come to Houston as part of a brand new North American Tour.\n\nCritics are raving that this breathtaking production is “bigger and better than ever before” and features a brilliant new scenic design by Paul Brown, Tony Award®-winning original costume design by Maria Björnson, lighting design by Tony Award®-winner Paule Constable, new choreography by Scott Ambler, and new staging by director Laurence Connor.\n\nThe production, overseen by Matthew Bourne and Cameron Mackintosh, boasts many exciting special effects including the show’s legendary chandelier. The beloved story and thrilling score – with songs like “Music of the Night,” “All I Ask Of You,” and “Masquerade” – will be performed by a cast and orchestra of 52, making this PHANTOM one of the largest productions now on tour."
