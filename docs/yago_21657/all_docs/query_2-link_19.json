Unknown to them, the show's impresario is the Phantom (Ramin Karimloo). It is revealed in the first act that the scarred composer and his muse shared a night of passion before she got married and went away, and the question of who is the boy's father drives the story.\n\nFurther complications come from the current star of the Phantom's show, Meg (Sierra Russell), whose mother Madame Giry (Liz Robertson) fears that Christine's arrival will lead to their being abandoned.\n\nLloyd Webber gives credit to comedian/writer Ben Elton for coming up with the plotline for the show and he brings not the guile of \"Blackadder\" but the simplicity of another hit stage musical he wrote, the Queen show \"We Will Rock You.\"\n\nIt's pure romantic melodrama but the lack of complexity leaves Lloyd Webber free to concentrate on the music, which he does with extraordinary vigor. His melodies radiate immediately and Glenn Slater's no-nonsense lyrics don't get in the way at all.\n\nIranian-born and Canada-based Karimloo has the strut and posture the Phantom needs and he has full command of a rich and subtle voice. Colorado-born Boggess' delivery of the title song alone is worth the price of admission. Its simple lyric becomes heart-rending as Boggess caresses and sculpts the song in a spotlight moment that in times gone by would have been called a showstopper. Millson, Robertson and Strallen also have their moments to shine as Lloyd Webber shakes up the musical tone with lively dancing girls and even some prog-rock.\n\nHis rousing and moving orchestrations with David Cullen lean less to his traditional keyboards and more toward strings and brass with exceptional playing by seasoned professionals including one of Britain's top flugelhorn players John Barclay, familiar from many James Bond movie scores.\n\nThe whole thing is rendered in a magnificent design that combines video projection; smoke and mirrors; beguiling illusions; and mischievous devices to create a vital atmosphere where love, jealousy and death can play out with sumptuous musicality.\n\n(please visit our entertainment blog via www.reuters.com or on http://blogs.reuters.com/fanfare/)\n\nhttp://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wirestory?id=10080614&page=1\n\nAnother article:\n\nDoes Love Never Dies tell us what the voters want?\n\nGreat cartoon by Garland today on the comment pages - have you seen it? - niftily tying in the opening of Love Never Dies with the nightmare prospect of a sequel to the Brown government. Cue picture of a half-masked Gordon with his fingers in full throttle-position around the neck of the electorate, envisaged as the ravishing young soprano Christine. “Coming Soon! The Phantom of the Soap Opera - Starring The Same Old Cast” runs the sharp wording, and below: ‘Return by Popular Demand”.\n\nThose of us who fear that the past few years have just been a dress-rehearsal for an even bigger catastrophe should cut it out and frame it.\n\nI have to say that I think he’s got it in one. I haven’t yet read all the reviews of Love Never Dies - and I think it’s beyond ordinary mortal power to wade through all the commentary that has been spewing forth in the blogo-sphere ever since the curtain went up on the show’s first preview, two weeks ago.\n\nTo my knowledge, though, no one has yet highlighted the peculiar way in which Love Never Does does indeed appear to capture the particular political mood of the moment. It’s no secret that Andrew Lloyd Webber, having mulled over the idea of a sequel to Phantom of the Opera for at least the past decade, only properly got to grips with the project during the last two years - ie, under the full gothic gloom of the Brown premiership. And so many parallels come into play when considering the affinities between Number 10’s main occupant and the figure who flits, in Phantom Mark 2, to Coney Island, that it’s very tempting to conclude that Lloyd Webber was inspired, albeit at a subconscious level, by our brooding, reclusive, scheming PM.\n\nWithout wishing to give away too much of the sequel’s storyline - although there are so many spoilers running amok in cyberspace, not to mention fully edited Wikipedia articles, that coyness is futile - the grim truth lurking in Love Never Dies is that the sinister anti-hero of the musical is endowed with a fatal attraction the heroine can’t resist. Whatever dastardly ploys he uses to secure his power over her, it’s what she wants, at the end of the day, that proves the clinching factor - and that boringly ordinary, potentially decent aristocrat husband Raoul (yep, let's read that as David Cameron) isn’t in the frame of her desires. Beauty will have her Beast, you see. And that grisly insight made musical flesh should send as many shivers down the collective spine of the Conservative Party as any dire opinion poll. Love Never Dies may or may not last forever, but it's a product of its age.\n\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/...-Never-Dies-tell-us-what-the-voters-want.html\n\nAbsolutely fantastic thread!

It basically nullifies and contradicts everything that made the first one great. The characters go from being meaty, real and complex to one dimensional soap opera, contrived cheap romance novel archetypes, 1907 is not ten years after 1870-80, whichever it is depending on the play or movie, and at the end of the day it contradicts what the original story is about, that no one is perfect and there are no perfect endings. Christine's decision is not easy in the end of the original, it's a really intense dilemma. Here it's practically handed to her.\n\nSome of the music is fine but it's not Phantom. The lyrics aren't even haunting or clever like the first, I'm sick of hearing the word beauty/beautiful now. Phantom was actually one of Michael's favorite plays and I doubt he would like it either (I cringed listening to Bathing Beauty). Not to mention the Phantom goes from a creative, passionate but tortured and damaged person who we all feel compassion and tragedy for, he becomes a deformed Edward Cullen knock off (sorry twilight fans). Meg goes from being a sweet best friend to a jealous skank and Raoul is a typical drunken, gambling, wife abusing jerk and we don't know why.\n\nBack to my point, they go from being characters love and could know to soap opera characters to make the decisions easy in the end. Life is not like that, they did to this story what they tried to do to Michael, label him, make him a villain without any of the truth that made him a great human at his core with his own flaws. The media and shallow ignorant people wanted Michael to be a superficial,greedy, womanizing self-righteous playa and make music encouraging others to be that way, when he wasn't they had to make him a crazy sick freak because god forbid a major talent could be flawed and human or want more than selfish gain. He can only be one thing or another. Don't support this play if you support the message of the original, accepting all the different possibilities people can be. People are not labels and we need to stop putting them on each other.\n\n^^ Where did ALW call the fans \"a sad culture\"? I read almost every article I can find on him but never saw that! I'm a HUGE Andrew Lloyd Webber fan -- he's the reason I am in theatre today -- and if he did say that it must have been taken out of context. I have heard him really marvel at the idea that it's become such a phenomenon, such as the woman who legally changed her name to Christine Daae. Andrew is really not a greedy person at all; I believe he continues to compose only when he feels moved to, not to \"cash in\" on anything, and I truly believe he thought he was giving fans a gift by continuing the Phantom story. Many have not been happy with it, and that's okay; everyone's allowed to have their own opinion.\n\nI actually know several of the bloggers who were quoted in the English papers reviewing early previews of LND, and many actually are great ALW fans and their comments were never intended to be picked up by the mass media. One of them was even the admin of an ALW forum (now defunct though) that was much like MJJC in it's day in the 90s. They weren't intending to cause such a firestorm!\n\nI have listened to the full cast album of LOVE NEVER DIES and I like it. I think it's some of Andrew's best music in years. I don't think the lyrics are anything more than serviceable, which is a shame because I think Glenn Slater is otherwise promising (from his other work). The thing people have to remember is that two and a half decades have passed since the original Phantom, the ONLY member of the creative team that both shows have in common is ALW (different director, designer, lyricist, etc), and the previous was an adaptation while this show is technically an \"original\" musical in that it's not adapted from an existing story, although it does use existing characters. I expected LND to be even MORE different from the original than it actually is; without giving anything away, I'll say I found lots of structural things about LND similar to POTO including Christine's 11-o'clock number performing a song written by the Phantom, an ultimatum between Phantom and Raoul, etc.\n\nWhile I don't think LND will ever match the success of the original (and really, what could? It's the most successful musical of all time, the THRILLER of musicals I sometimes say!), but I'm happy it finally happened. I will be the first on line to see it when it comes to New York in the fall. I respect the differing opinions of others but upon hearing this score, I'm really glad it saw the light of day!"
