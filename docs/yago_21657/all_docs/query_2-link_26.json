Initially announced to open in London, New York, and Sydney in quick succession, Love Never Dies was scaled back due to Lloyd Webber’s ill health .\n\nLove Never Dies premiered in London on March 9, 2010, at the Adelphi Theatre starring Ramin Karimloo and Sierra Boggess. Directed by Jack O’Brien, the production received mixed though mostly negative reviews. The show’s opening night garnered more attention for its celebrity audience than for the show itself.\n\nEven so-called “Phans,” fans of Phantom of the Opera, attempted to sabotage Love Never Dies by protesting the sequel, posting negative reviews, and calling for a boycott.\n\nThe London production closed briefly and was re-written, but closed after “just” a year on the West End.\n\nWhen the Australian company of Love Never Dies was announced, it was revealed that the production would receive a new staging under the direction of Simon Phillips. The revamped production, starring Ben Lewis and Anna O’Byrne.\n\nThe revised Australian production of Love Never Dies opened on May 28, 2011 at the Regent Theatre in Melbourne. Lloyd Webber stated it was “one of the finest productions I’ve ever seen of my work, anywhere.”\n\nJason Blake, writing for the Sydney Morning Herald, gave the show a lukewarm review. While praising the talents of the cast, Blake stated that the “star of the show is Gabriela Tylesova's design.” Although the production was “inspired [and] often ravishing,” Blake felt the musical was not strong.\n\nDespite the critics’ opinions, the Australian production of Love Never Dies was received enthusiastically by audiences.\n\nThe production received 10 Helpmann Award nominations, including Best Musical. It won 3, with Gabriela Tylesova taking home Best Scenic Design and Best Costume Design, and Nich Schlieper winning for Best Lighting Design.\n\nLove Never Dies toured around Australia, and also in Germany and Japan. A separate production was also performed in Denmark.\n\nA North American tour of the production has been announced for the 2017-18 season. ​\n\nFilmed Production Notes\n\nThe Australian production was filmed at the Regent Theatre in Melbourne on September 15, 2011.\n\nAccording to interviews with Erin James and Paul Tabone, some aspects of Love Never Dies were altered for the filmed version. Actors were asked to “pull back,” and some blocking was adjusted to accommodate the cameras.\n\nIn a review of the film for Indy Week, Zach Smith noted “It is the closest I’ve ever seen to a live performance translated into a cinematic experience,” and claimed the most “intriguing” aspect of Love Never Dies was “what it could represent for the future of musicals in the age of new media.”\n\nThe DVD was released internationally in 2012, and reached number 4 on the UK DVD charts.\n\nThe film was also released in cinemas through Fathom Events in 2012.\n\nLove Never Dies is available on DVD and to stream on Apple TV, Amazon Video, and BroadwayHD.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 shutdown in April 2020, Love Never Dies will be streamed for free on Andrew Lloyd Webber's new YouTube channel The Shows Must Go On.
