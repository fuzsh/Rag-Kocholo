        "text": "Andrew Lloyd Webber has confirmed that his sequel to Phantom of the Opera - Love Never Dies will not premiere on Broadway on 11 Nov 2010 as previously announced.\n\nThe delay has been caused by post-operative problems which have plagued Lloyd Webber since his operation for the treatment of prostate cancer earlier this year.\n\nA statement from the show's US producers says, \"These have been aggravated by recent air travel and Lloyd Webber's doctors have requested that he does not take any further long-haul flights for the time being and until the problem has been investigated. This prevents him attending auditions and being part of the pre-production process in New York on the original schedule.\"\n\nLloyd Webber added: \"I am extremely frustrated that I cannot travel to New York for the time being. I will be focusing my time on producing The Wizard of Oz in London now, and plan to be available for the creative process of bringing Love Never Dies to Broadway as soon as possible. I'm grateful that Jack [O'Brien, director] and Jerry's [Mitchell, choreographer] schedules can allow me to do this juggling act.\"\n\nHowever, there are rumours that the \"juggling act\" that Lloyd Webber is referring to is one that may not be so welcomed by Jack O'Brien and Jerry Mitchell. The duo are also working on the musical \"Catch Me If You Can,\" which many were predicting would arrive on Broadway in the spring of 2011. Michael Riedel of the New York Post speculates that upcoming production meetings between Lloyd Webber, and O'Brien and Mitchell may not go amicably.\n\nThe news follows rumors that the London production of Love Never Dies may already be struggling to draw in theatregoers. For a long time after Phantom of the Opera opened in London, one had to wait up to six months to purchase tickets for a Saturday night performance. Just weeks after Love Never Dies opened tickets are readily available, with some London ticket agents promoting special offers for Saturday evening performances.\n\nLove Never Dies has been famously dubbed by one blog site as, \"Paint Never Dries.\" The New York Times chief critic, Ben Brantley, wrote in his review: \"this poor sap of a show feels as eager to be walloped as a clown in a carnival dunking booth.\"\n\nIt is reported that the savage review by Broadway's top critic has set alarm bells ringing for Lloyd Webber, and the composure is demanding major changes to the show before its Broadway opening.\n\nLove Never Dies opened at the Adelphi Theatre on 9 March 2010, following previews from 20 Feb 2010.\n\nThe show, directed by Jack O'Brien and choreographed by Jerry Mitchell, features Ramin Karimloo as 'The Phantom', Sierra Boggess the role of 'Christine' and Summer Strallen as 'Meg Giry'.\n\nTen years after the mysterious disappearance of The Phantom from the Paris Opera House, Christine Daae accepts an offer to come to America and perform at New York's fabulous new playground of the world - Coney Island. Christine arrives in New York with her husband Raoul and their son Gustave. She soon discovers the identity of the anonymous impresario who has lured her from France to sing."
