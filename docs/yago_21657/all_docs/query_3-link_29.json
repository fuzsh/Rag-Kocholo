Following hugely successful runs in North America, Japan and Finland receiving acclaim from both audiences and critics alike, Love Never Dies will open in Shanghai in Autumn 2023.\n\nLove Never Dies has music by Andrew Lloyd Webber, lyrics by Glenn Slater, book by Ben Elton, based on The Phantom of Manhattan by Frederick Forsyth, additional lyrics by Charles Hart, orchestrations by David Cullen and Andrew Lloyd Webber.\n\nWith original direction by Simon Phillips, set and costume design by Gabriela Tylesova, choreography by Graeme Murphy, lighting design by Nick Schlieper and sound design by Mick Potter, the China premier will brought to stage by Love Never Dies Associate Director Gavin Mitford, Associate Choreographer Simone Sault and Music Supervisor Simon Lee.\n\nThe year is 1907. It is 10 years after his disappearance from the Paris Opera House and the Phantom has escaped to a new life in New York where he lives amongst the screaming joy rides and freak shows of Coney Island. In this new, electrically charged world, he has finally found a place for his music to soar, but he has never stopped yearning for his one true love and musical protégée, Christine Daaé.\n\nThis dazzling new production takes audiences on a thrilling rollercoaster ride of intrigue, obsession and romance, where you’ll be seduced by the beautiful; sometimes magical and poetic; sometimes joyful; and occasionally melancholic score. Don’t miss this magnificent continuation of one of the world’s greatest love stories of all time."
