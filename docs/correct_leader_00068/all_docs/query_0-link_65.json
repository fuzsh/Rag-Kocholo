        "text": "TOKYO, Sept. 16 (Xinhua) -- Japan's National Diet started an extraordinary session on Wednesday, in which the newly elected president of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) Yoshihide Suga is expected to be officially named as the country's new prime minister.\n\nThe House of Representatives and the House of Councilors are convening to each name their choice for the successor of outgoing Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, whose Cabinet resigned en masse Wednesday morning.\n\nSuga is certain to be chosen as the next prime minister owing to the LDP's dominance in both chambers of Japan's bicameral parliament.\n\nLater in the day, Suga will announce the members of his new cabinet before being formally inaugurated at a ceremony at the Imperial Palace.\n\nAt the age of 71, Suga will be the oldest prime minister to take office since Kiichi Miyazawa in 1991. His premiership will last through the remainder of Abe's term as LDP leader until Sept. 2021.\n\nIn the run-up to his inauguration, Suga said he would continue to promote Abe's policies, including his \"Abenomics\" of aggressive monetary easing, fiscal stimulus and structural reforms, to breathe life back into the recession-hit Japanese economy.\n\nSuga will also continue the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, utilizing the 230 trillion yen (2.2 trillion U.S. dollar) package allocated for tackling the COVID-19 outbreak.
