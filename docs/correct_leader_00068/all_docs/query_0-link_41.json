        "text": "In this Japanese name, the family name is Hosokawa.\n\nPlantilla:Infobox officeholder/Personal data\n\nMorihiro Hosokawa (細川 護煕 Hosokawa Morihiro, born January 14, 1938) is a Japanese politician who was the 79th Prime Minister of Japan from August 9, 1993 to April 28, 1994. His coalition was the first non-Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) government since 1955.\n\nEarly life[]\n\nHosokawa Morihiro was born in Tokyo as the eldest son of Marquis Morisada Hosokawa, the head of the Hosokawa clan. He is the grandson of former Japanese Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe. Owing to his birth, he was born a marquis, but lost the title in 1947 at the age of nine when the kazoku, or peerage was abolished by the American occupation government.\n\nHe received his LL.B. from Sophia University in 1961. After working for the newspaper the Asahi Shimbun as journalist for several years, he was elected to the House of Councillors of Japan as a member of the LDP in 1971, representing Kumamoto Prefecture.\n\nAfter serving two terms in the National Diet, he left in 1983 to become the governor of Kumamoto, where he served until 1991.\n\nIn 1992, he announced that he could no longer stand the corruption in the LDP and left in order to found the reformist Japan New Party (JNP).\n\nPrime minister[]\n\nIn the summer of 1993, in a change very few had foreseen even a year earlier, the LDP lost its majority in the Diet for the first time in thirty-eight years and was replaced by an eight-party coalition government which promised a series of social, political, and economic reforms. Excluding the JCP, the coalition was backed by all of the former opposition parties, which included the newly formed JNP, the Japan Socialist Party, the Japan Renewal Party (Shinseito), Komeito, the Democratic Socialist Party, the Socialist Democratic Federation, the RENGO and the New Party Sakigake. Hosokawa, one of the major voices in forming the coalition, was chosen as the new Prime Minister.\n\nOne of the first things the newly elected PM did was to say what no other Japanese leader, including the Emperor, had said for forty-eight years.[1] In his August 15, 1993 speech at the annual war memorial services, he publicly acknowledged that World War II was a \"war of aggression, a mistaken war\" and expressed responsibility and condolences to the war victims and survivors, in Japan, its Asian neighbors, and the rest of the world.\n\nOn November 6, 1993, he visited South Korea. On March 19, 1994, he visited China, and the two governments signed an agreement of cooperation in environmental protection.\n\nAlthough his coalition managed to secure passage of legislation to reform the electoral system in 1994, the subject of a long-running national debate, Hosokawa’s run as PM was short lived. Under allegations that he had misused personal funds in the 1980s,[2] he was forced to resign later that year, just eight months after taking office. After his resignation, the coalition was taken over by the Shinseito president Tsutomu Hata.\n\nCabinet[]\n\nCabinet of Morihiro Hosokawa Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura (Sakigake) Foreign Affairs Tsutomu Hata (Shinseito) Justice Akira Mikazuki (non-affiliated) Finance Hirohisa Fujii (Shinseito) Education Yoko Akamatsu (non-affiliated) Health and Welfare Keigo Ouchi (Democratic Socialist) Labor Chikara Sakaguchi (Komeito) Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Eijiro Hata (Shinseito) International Trade and Industry Hiroshi Kumagai (Shinseito) Transport Shigeru Ito (Socialist) Construction Kozo Igarashi (Socialist) Home Affairs and National Public Safety Commission Kanju Sato (Socialist) Posts and Telecommunications Takenori Kanzaki (Komeito) Management and Coordination Agency Koshiro Ishida (Komeito) Japan Defense Agency Hiroyoshi Nakanishi (Shinseito) until December 1, 1993\n\nKazuo Aichi (Shinseito) after December 2, 1993 Hokkaido and Okinawa Development, National Land Agency Kosuke Uehara (Socialist) Economic Planning Agency Manae Kubota (Socialist) Environment Wakako Hironaka (Komeito) Council for Science and Technology Policy Satsuki Eda (Social Democratic) Minister of State Sadao Yamahana (Socialist)\n\nLater political life[]\n\nHosokawa joined Shinshinto in 1996, and later moved to the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) in 1998 from which he retired from politics in May of that year.\n\nIn his retirement, he has taken up pottery which has been exhibited in Japan and Europe. He is also a special consultant to The Japan Times. Upon his father's death in 2005, Hosokawa succeeded him as the head of the Hosokawa family.\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]\n\nPolicy speech to the 127th Session of the National Diet August 23, 1993\n\nPolicy speech to the 128th Session of the National Diet September 21, 1993\n\nPolicy speech to the 129th Session of the National Diet March 4, 1994\n\nPlantilla:S-dip\n\nPolitical offices Preceded by\n\nKiichi Miyazawa Prime Minister of Japan\n\n1993–1994 Succeeded by\n\nTsutomu Hata Preceded by\n\nKiichi Miyazawa Chair of the G8\n\n1993 Succeeded by\n\nSilvio Berlusconi\n\nPlantilla:Prime Ministers of Japan\n\nPersondata Name Hosokawa, Morihiro Alternative names Short description Date of birth January 14, 1938 Place of birth Tokyo, Japan Date of death Place of death\n\nar:موريهيرو هوسوكاوا de:Morihiro Hosokawa es:Morihiro Hosokawa fr:Morihiro Hosokawa ko:호소카와 모리히로 it:Morihiro Hosokawa la:Morihiro Hosokawa ja:細川護熙 no:Morihiro Hosokawa pl:Morihiro Hosokawa pt:Morihiro Hosokawa ru:Хосокава, Морихиро su:Morihiro Hosokawa fi:Morihiro Hosokawa sv:Morihiro Hosokawa th:โมะริฮิโระ โฮะโซะกะวะ vi:Hosokawa Morihiro yo:Morihiro Hosokawa zh:细川护熙"
