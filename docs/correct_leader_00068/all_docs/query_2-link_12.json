        "text": "Becoming prime minister was in a sense a brilliant political comeback for Miyazawa Kiichi. He had been at the centre of political decision-making for decades, and had started to be seen as a bit worn-out as a politician. Now, it was Rie, his modelling daughter who made the public pay attention to the Miyazawa name. Yet, suddenly he found himself premier, at the age of 72 the oldest to assume this office in the postwar period.1 The contrast to his predecessor could not have been greater. While Kaifu was comparatively young and inexperienced when he became prime minister, Miyazawa had an impressive record as a key decision-maker; while Kaifu was a rank-and-file member of the smallest faction of the governing party, Miyazawa was the leader of one of the largest factions in the parliament; while Kaifu was seen as a ‘clean’ politician, Miyazawa’s involvement in a scandal had forced him to resign as finance minister in 1988. He had served as minister no less than 13 times and held several key posts in the LDP (Rekidai naikaku sōran, 1991, p. 403). Nevertheless, in a curious — and demeaning — way his proficiency in English was often made his main qualification as a politician (see for instance Kiyomiya, 1982, p. 239)."
