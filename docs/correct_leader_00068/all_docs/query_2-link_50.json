        "text": "The JSPP21 (Japan-Singapore Partnership Programme for the 21st Century) is Singapore's largest and most successful joint training programme to date. Since the cooperation began in 1994 under the Japan-Singapore Partnership Programme (JSPP), more than 3,000 officials from all major regions of the world have been trained in courses covering diverse areas like IT, trade promotion, industrial development, healthcare, education, urban planning and the environment.\n\nThe JSSP was first mooted in May 1993 when the former Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong and the late Japanese Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa agreed to commence a Partnership Programme. Subsequently, the JSPP was signed in 1994. In 1997, former Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda and former Singapore Foreign Minister S. Jayakumar signed a Memorandum of Understanding establishing the JSPP21 to renew the focus of cooperation towards the needs of developing countries in the 21st century. 2007 marks the 10th anniversary of JSPP21.\n\nOne of the major objectives of the JSPP21 is to narrow the development gaps among ASEAN countries. The major recipients of JSPP21 training courses are Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and Myanmar. The targeted and resource-maximisation approach of the JSPP21 has been singled out by Japan as a good reference model for their partnerships in the region.\n\nTo celebrate the 10th anniversary of the JSPP21 in the year 2007, Singapore and Japan are currently working to enhance the long-standing cooperation and partnership between Singapore and JICA. The enhanced JSPP21 will accord greater priority to human resource capacity building programmes for third countries in the areas of trade and investment facilitation, information and communications technology development, and energy security. Both sides will also seek to deepen cooperation in providing joint training programmes for third countries in infectious disease management, corporate governance and the maintenance of stable financial systems, and environmental protection.\n\nAbout the Singapore Cooperation Programme\n\nSingapore's technical assistance programme is based on the training and development of human resource in competencies useful to developing countries. As a country whose only resource is its people, Singapore believes that human resource development is vital for economic and social progress. Singapore itself has benefited from training provided by other countries and international organisations. Through the SCP, Singapore shares its development experiences with other developing countries.\n\nThe SCP was formally established in 1992 to bring together under one framework the various technical assistance programmes offered by Singapore. Over the years, the range and number of training programmes have been increased to meet the training needs of developing countries. To date, Singapore has sponsored training courses and study visits for over 48,000 officials and individuals from 166 developing countries in the Asia-Pacific, Africa, Eastern Europe, Middle East, Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\nMore details are available on the Singapore Cooperation Website at www.scp.gov.sg.\n\n. . . ."
