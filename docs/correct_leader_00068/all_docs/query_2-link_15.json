This office was created in 1919 following the establishment of the Republic of Japan. The official office and residence of the President of the Republic of Japan is formally called as the Presidential Office of the Republic of Japan (Japanese: ミンコクソウサイコウテイ; Kanji: 民國總裁公邸 Minkoku Sōsai Kōtei), located on Shirokanedai, Minato, Tokyo, the national capital of Japan. But, the office is usually (and popularly) referred as the Teien (Japanese: テイエン; Kanji: 庭園) which means 'garden' in Japanese, simply because the office building is surrounded by a traditional Japanese garden.\n\nDuties and functions[]\n\nThe President of the Republic is elected by the National Congress for a four-year term and can be re-elected indefinitely. According to the Constitution of Japan, the office of President is the head of state of the Republic of Japan and the political commander-in-chief of the armed forces. The President of the Republic is responsible for conducting foreign relations, such as concluding treaties, declaring war, and making peace. The President has no right to veto any Congress decisions. Other powers of the President include granting amnesty, pardon or clemency, declaring martial law, and conferring honors and decorations.\n\nPrior to World War II, the Constitution did not clearly defines the office of President as the powerful position in the country. However, the multiple political posts which held by Nagayama Yoshida in the government and in the Party, made the office quite powerful through Nagayama's charismatic authority. Its established a political precedent which makes the State Presidency as the supreme political office in the country. Following the 1946 constitutional amendment, the Presidential authorities are slightly reduced to less powerful than before and the President serves primarily as a ceremonial position. The office can be powerful depends how much the influence of office-holder has within the Nationalist Party.\n\nList of Presidents of the Republic of Japan[]"
