        "text": "50. Memorandum From the President’s Assistant for National Security Affairs (Kissinger) to President Nixon1\n\nSUBJECT\n\nSecretary Stans’ Report on Textile Negotiations\n\nSecretary Stans has forwarded a day-by-day account of his textile negotiations with the Japanese Minister of Trade and Industry, Kiichi Miyazawa, June 22–24.2\n\nIt is clear that the principal problem was the length of the agreement, and that compromises on the other points had either been reached or seemed attainable.\n\nOn timing, the Japanese were willing to agree to restraints for twelve to eighteen months, provided the United States would agree not to expand the time limit of the agreement or expand the concept of voluntary restraints to other industries. The U.S. insisted on an agreement lasting at least until 1973. The Japanese argued that they could not accept the longer period without a justification beyond the timing of U.S. elections.\n\nOn other key elements:\n\nOn the purely diplomatic side, Secretary Stans apparently indicated to Miyazawa that he based his position on what he understood were specific points that had been agreed to last November by you and Prime Minister Sato. Miyazawa said he had questioned Sato on this, and that Sato said there had been no explicit understanding on specifics—that he had simply promised “to do his utmost” to reach satisfactory agreement. Miyazawa claimed that his sole reason for coming was to fulfill that promise—not to forestall the Mills bill, nor to meet the demands of the U.S. textile industry. Miyazawa said that his coming should be construed as representing the Prime Minister’s promise “to do his utmost.”\n\nComments\n\nWhen we approach the Japanese again on textile negotiations, the situation will be very much influenced by the status of the Mills bill and your position on it. However, part of the situation brought out in the Miyazawa–Stans conversation will remain the same.\n\nIn an effort to help re-start the negotiations, and help head off restrictive U.S. legislation, GATT Director-General Long has personally offered an informal proposal which meets our position on most counts—including duration. Our people are assessing it in detail, as are the Japanese. If it looks acceptable to us, we will see whether the Japanese are sufficiently interested to make new talks worthwhile.\n\nAn agreement by mid-October with Japan, if one were possible, would put you in the best possible position to veto the trade legislation which is likely to reach your desk about that time—since your textile commitment would have been taken care of by other means. We could also begin negotiations shortly with Hong Kong, Korea, and Taiwan, to demonstrate action and perhaps to make it easier for the Japanese to negotiate."
