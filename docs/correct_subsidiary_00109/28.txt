The growing importance of search engines has given rise to a new type of spam: Link exchange offer spam. If you own a site listed by search engines, sooner or later you will end up getting offers to trade links with largely unrelated sites you probably never heard of before.

The value of a website to its owner is based on how many vistors access its content. These days, unless you are a big brand name such as Yahoo, Microsoft or Google or anyone with a large non-internet presence, the stream of visitors to your site is largely determined by search engine results. Visitors consult Google or another service about certain keywords and whatever that search engine happens to come up with will be amongst the most frequently visited sites for those particular terms.

Users judge search engines by the relevance of the hits they present first. If a search engine wants to succeed (as Google did), it needs to be able to judge relevancy. One good way of doing so is by taking into account the human factor: How many other Internet users have linked to that page yet? The more links to a site and the "better" the ranking of those sites, the better the ranking of the linked site will be too. So to get good ranking, there are two ways:

You create a good site with interesting content that you maintain and update and people will link to you on their own.

You take a shortcut and ask others to trade links, whether your site is relevant to their vistors or not.

While link exchanges are nothing new, these days website owners often use harvesting software to extract contact email addresses from highly ranked pages found on Google or in web directories (DMOZ). They then spam those webmasters using bulk email software to offer link swaps. Here are some examples of such link swap offers.

The following example received on 11-June-2004 (left hand side) looks like a well-written letter, but I found it curious because it seemed almost too well written, better than what most people could come up with... A quick Google-search found a remarkably similar request for a link to a totally different website in some guestbook on the WWW, posted on 2-August-2003 by a totally different person. Compare for yourself:

Dear Webmaster,

My name is Irene Holm, and I'm one of the owners of Grateful Hippie. I wanted to let you know that I've just placed a link to taima.org.

You can find the link to your site here: http://links.gratefulhippie.com/hemp.htm

I've used this text to link to your site:

title line of homepage of contacted site

This is the description I've used for your site:

slight variation of title line

Let me know if you want to change the description of your site.

I really liked your site :) So, I thought why not add it?

At my site http://gratefulhippie.com we mostly sell incense and oils. But we wanted to have links to other products of interest to our visitors.

Anyway I would really appreciate it if you could give me a heads up if you move or change link locations, or if you post any new material that you think my visitors would be interested in.

A link back to my site would also be nice. :-) If you link back to me, I'll put your site at the top of its category and I'll mark it with a

special "TIP" image.

Again, awesome site!

Sincerely,

Chris & Irene Holm

I found the identical passages too much of a coincidence and so I googled some more. I came across a page that provided the template for both of these, as well as instructions on how to proceed. Here is it:

http://www.svend.com/page-rank-explained.html:

So... now that you know a bit more about this... what can you do to get a better page rank (ie link popularity). Well, you could hire me to do it for you, but the cost would be surely higher than you would want to pay! :) - My suggestion is to write web masters & contact people at web sites that would be a good match for you, and send them an email something like this:

Hello owner/webmaster,

My name is _________, and I am the Internet marketing director of ________.

The importance of building solid link exchange partners can not be stressed enough these days, it is the key to higher page ranking on many top search engines! I wanted to let you know that I will be placing a link on

http://www.synthium.net/ to your site: www.svend.com

You can find the link to your site here:

http://www.yourdomain.com/links/

link text: Svend Design: web design, SEO - search engine optimization, logo design, graphic design, web hosting, ecommerce and shopping carts (an example)

Depending on your websites exact category I could place it elsewhere thats more appropriate for it.

Let me know what you would like for a description of your site. Your site is a useful and favorable resource on the Web! I would really appreciate it if you could give me a heads up if you move or change link locations, or if you post any new material that you think my visitors would be

interested in.

A link back to my site would also be nice. :-) If you link back to me, I'll place your site up fast and accurately for its category.

Here is our linking data:

<a href="http://www.his-domain" target="_blank">Vancouver Web Design, Web

Something like that... If you make it a part of your week to do this often, you will start to build a good page rank for your web site which will go hand in hand with search engine optimization.

You will find plenty of hits looking for people who have followed this advice:

The following two spams are more conventional and quite typical. The product being advertised had no connection whatsoever to the site being asked for a link exchange:

This link exchange spam was somewhat unusual, in that the spammers posed as university students doing a project:

DATE: 2 February 2005 SUBJECT: www.joewein.de/sw/spam-fraud-paypal.htm (Link Request For Study Project) FROM: Richard and Suzanna BSC Rhodes University To whom it may concern We are a group of students from Rhodes University who have set up a forum to talk about payment services on the internet. Our forum will be a place for users to post remarks, praise or yell at the various services they have used as well as to recommend these services to other users. Your site has been identified as recommending your users to use Western Union as a payment option. Would you be willing to direct your users to us using the following banner? http://www.international-money-transfers.com/images/payments-banner-wu.gif and from your site. (alternativly a text link would suffice: TITLE: International Money Transfers Forum DESCRIPTION: Talk about International Money Transfers and Wire Transfer Services. LINK: http://international-money-transfers.com/wire-transfer-service/index.php This will be a place for them to voice their opinion on the Western Union Service. In return you are free to post in our partner forum a short or a long blurb about your business. You are even welcome to refer your customers to this page to post their praises about your excellent service! Your help would be greatly appreciated in our study. Regards Richard and Suzanna BSC students info@international-money-transfers.com

This message was not sent to the email address listed on my contact page but to an address I mention somewhere on my website that no human would find. Only an address harvesting spider would come across it. Automated address harvesting of websites is a US federal felony under the CAN SPAM ACT of 2003.

If you look at the page on my site mentioned, it talks about how Western Union is used in online fraud. It doesn't seem like whoever sent this email had personally visited the site. More likely they had done an automated Google search for the highest ranking sites mentioning Western Union and then spidered those sites for contact infomration. By getting high-ranking sites mentioning this term to link to the spammers' brand new site (created 2005-01-28, about two weeks ago), they are hoping to get a high ranking for themselves for this term.

The domain doesn't look like a university project. It's registered to a company on the British Virgin Island, not to anyone called "Richard" or "Suzanna".

Link exchange spam from "fraudwatchernetwork.com"

The following link exchange spam is from what claims to be an anti-fraud site. However, it's mostly a catcher site for search engines in order to sell ads. Some of sites listed on the "fake rolex" page of this supposedly anti-fraud site are sites selling counterfeit goods. Text on site has been directly lifted from other sites that document online scams. Email address webmaster@joewein.de is not listed as a valid contact address on our contact page. This person never bothered to visit our website, he probably produced this spam using only software.
