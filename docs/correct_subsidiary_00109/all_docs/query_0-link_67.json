        "text": "Will portals emerge as the real winners in the emergence of e-commerce? That depends on whether they can build a strong, personal relationship with their users, analysts say.\n\nBut that's harder than it sounds. Right now, the portals have plenty of users, but relatively poor loyalty -- it's no great matter to switch from Yahoo! (Nasdaq:YHOO) to Netscape's (Nasdaq:NSCP) Netcenter to AOL.com (NYSE:AOL).\n\nThe sites are convenient, but to position themselves as shopping brands, the portals will have to build reputations based on trust and customer service.\n\n\"They have to build that sense of trust on a day-to-day basis, by offering personalized features that appeal to my preferences,\" said Melissa Bane, an analyst at Yankee Group in Boston. \"If I feel that the portal site knows enough about me, I will assume that they will have deals with the kinds of shopping sites I'm interested in.\"\n\nIn particular, it will be a challenge to assure users their personal information will not end up in the hands of advertisers or be otherwise abused.\n\nOverextended?\n\nThere is also the possibility that the sites could be overextending themselves by plunging into too many businesses.\n\nThe overarching portal business model is to increase advertising effectiveness by encouraging users to return often -- daily, if possible -- and to spend more time on the site.\n\nThat has led to a proliferation of \"sticky\" applications, such as e-mail and personalization. Sticky, because once you have an e-mail account on one site, the thinking goes, you're more likely to check that site often.\n\nBut this approach might have its limits when it comes to the complex matter of creating a trustworthy commerce brand.\n\n\"An emerging issue is how long these sites can effectively play the Swiss Army knife role,\" said Drew Ianni an analyst at Jupiter Communications.\n\n\"They're trying to be a lot of things to a lot of people,\" he said. \"But online shoppers are picky and finicky ... the portals will have to do a good enough job that users don't believe they have better options open to them.\"\n\nA simpler experience\n\nStill, the portals are pushing for this market. Some of the other e-commerce activity among the portals:\n\nYahoo! has operated an online store in cooperation with Visa International for four years.\n\nYahoo!'s online-auction subsidiary is positioning itself for the gift-giving season, hawking everything from trading cards to video games to Beanie Babies.\n\n\"As companies like ourselves and online retailers get more experience and understand how users consume on the site, the user experience will only get simpler,\" said Tim Brady, Yahoo! executive producer. \"It's the job of the CDNows of the world to simplify buying and shipping. Yahoo! helps users find things more easily.\"\n\nYahoo! acquired Viaweb -- now Yahoo! Store -- earlier this year, to make it easier for small businesses to set up online shops hosted by Yahoo!\n\nMSN, which includes such e-commerce sites as Expedia and CarPoint, has its own shopping guide; sponsors include Eddie Bauer, BarnesandNoble.com (NYSE:BKS), Amazon.com (Nasdaq:AMZN) and Micro Warehouse.\n\n\"Our goal is to give consumers the insight they need for the purchasing process -- what information do I need to make this decision, what do I buy, where do I get it, whether it's an online or a bricks-and-mortar store,\" said Nichole Hardy, product manager for MSN.com.\n\nOther plans\n\nMicrosoft (Nasdaq:MSFT) recently acquired LinkExchange, widely seen as a move to bring more small businesses on board for advertising and hosting services.\n\nInfoseek Corp. (Nasdaq:SEEK) is expected to launch Go Network, its joint venture with Walt Disney Co. (NYSE:DIS), before Christmas.\n\nLycos Inc. (Nasdaq:LCOS) has announced plans to diversify into a \"network\" of sites, to include new acquisition Wired Digital. Wired's HotBot includes a number of shopping tools aimed at more Net-savvy users.\n\nNetcenter, the portal run by Netscape, has said that a major focus of its revamped site will be consumer-oriented services."
