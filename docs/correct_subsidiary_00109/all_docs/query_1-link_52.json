        "text": "The growing importance of search engines has given rise to a new type of spam: Link exchange offer spam. If you own a site listed by search engines, sooner or later you will end up getting offers to trade links with largely unrelated sites you probably never heard of before.\n\nThe value of a website to its owner is based on how many vistors access its content. These days, unless you are a big brand name such as Yahoo, Microsoft or Google or anyone with a large non-internet presence, the stream of visitors to your site is largely determined by search engine results. Visitors consult Google or another service about certain keywords and whatever that search engine happens to come up with will be amongst the most frequently visited sites for those particular terms.\n\nUsers judge search engines by the relevance of the hits they present first. If a search engine wants to succeed (as Google did), it needs to be able to judge relevancy. One good way of doing so is by taking into account the human factor: How many other Internet users have linked to that page yet? The more links to a site and the \"better\" the ranking of those sites, the better the ranking of the linked site will be too. So to get good ranking, there are two ways:\n\nYou create a good site with interesting content that you maintain and update and people will link to you on their own.\n\nYou take a shortcut and ask others to trade links, whether your site is relevant to their vistors or not.\n\nWhile link exchanges are nothing new, these days website owners often use harvesting software to extract contact email addresses from highly ranked pages found on Google or in web directories (DMOZ). They then spam those webmasters using bulk email software to offer link swaps. Here are some examples of such link swap offers.\n\nThe following example received on 11-June-2004 (left hand side) looks like a well-written letter, but I found it curious because it seemed almost too well written, better than what most people could come up with... A quick Google-search found a remarkably similar request for a link to a totally different website in some guestbook on the WWW, posted on 2-August-2003 by a totally different person. Compare for yourself:\n\nDear Webmaster,\n\nMy name is Irene Holm, and I'm one of the owners of Grateful Hippie. I wanted to let you know that I've just placed a link to taima.org.\n\nYou can find the link to your site here: http://links.gratefulhippie.com/hemp.htm\n\nI've used this text to link to your site:\n\ntitle line of homepage of contacted site\n\nThis is the description I've used for your site:\n\nslight variation of title line\n\nLet me know if you want to change the description of your site.\n\nI really liked your site :) So, I thought why not add it?\n\nAt my site http://gratefulhippie.com we mostly sell incense and oils. But we wanted to have links to other products of interest to our visitors.\n\nAnyway I would really appreciate it if you could give me a heads up if you move or change link locations, or if you post any new material that you think my visitors would be interested in.\n\nA link back to my site would also be nice. :-) If you link back to me, I'll put your site at the top of its category and I'll mark it with a\n\nspecial \"TIP\" image.\n\nAgain, awesome site!\n\nSincerely,\n\nChris & Irene Holm\n\ngratefulhippie.com\n\nHello,\n\nMy name is Robert Dharmabudi, and I'm the owner of Bali Paintings Art Gallery. I wanted to let you know that I've just placed a link to jasonbeale.com.\n\nThanks for putting such a useful site on the Web! I would really appreciate it if you could give me a heads up if you move or change link locations, or if you post any new material that you think my visitors would be interested in. A link back to my site would also be nice. :-)\n\nBali Oil Paintings and Acrylic Fine Art Gallery - offers oil paintings and acrylic fine art including abstract, classical, wildlife and floral, people, and traditional themes.\n\nAgain, thank you very much for your great web site.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRobert Dharmabudi\n\nI found the identical passages too much of a coincidence and so I googled some more. I came across a page that provided the template for both of these, as well as instructions on how to proceed. Here is it:\n\nhttp://www.svend.com/page-rank-explained.html:\n\nSo... now that you know a bit more about this... what can you do to get a better page rank (ie link popularity). Well, you could hire me to do it for you, but the cost would be surely higher than you would want to pay! :) - My suggestion is to write web masters & contact people at web sites that would be a good match for you, and send them an email something like this:\n\nHello owner/webmaster,\n\nMy name is _________, and I am the Internet marketing director of ________.\n\nThe importance of building solid link exchange partners can not be stressed enough these days, it is the key to higher page ranking on many top search engines! I wanted to let you know that I will be placing a link on\n\nhttp://www.synthium.net/ to your site: www.svend.com\n\nYou can find the link to your site here:\n\nhttp://www.yourdomain.com/links/\n\nlink text: Svend Design: web design, SEO - search engine optimization, logo design, graphic design, web hosting, ecommerce and shopping carts (an example)\n\nDepending on your websites exact category I could place it elsewhere thats more appropriate for it.\n\nLet me know what you would like for a description of your site. Your site is a useful and favorable resource on the Web! I would really appreciate it if you could give me a heads up if you move or change link locations, or if you post any new material that you think my visitors would be\n\ninterested in.\n\nA link back to my site would also be nice. :-) If you link back to me, I'll place your site up fast and accurately for its category.\n\nHere is our linking data:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.his-domain\" target=\"_blank\">Vancouver Web Design, Web\n\nSite Designer, Vancouver Internet Marketing</a><br>\n\n-Synthium Design Studio, a Vancouver Web Design firm. We create professional\n\nweb sites, graphics, logos, Ecommerce solutions. Internet marketing experts!\n\nThanks in advance\n\nSincerely,\n\nYour Name Here\n\nCompany Name.\n\nSomething like that... If you make it a part of your week to do this often, you will start to build a good page rank for your web site which will go hand in hand with search engine optimization.\n\nYou will find plenty of hits looking for people who have followed this advice:\n\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=%22heads+up+if+you+move+or+change+link+locations%22&lr=&ie=UTF-8&filter=0\n\nThe following two spams are more conventional and quite typical.

Steve http://www.changing-winds.com\n\ninternational-money-transfers.com\n\nThis link exchange spam was somewhat unusual, in that the spammers posed as university students doing a project:\n\nDATE: 2 February 2005 SUBJECT: www.joewein.de/sw/spam-fraud-paypal.htm (Link Request For Study Project) FROM: Richard and Suzanna BSC Rhodes University To whom it may concern We are a group of students from Rhodes University who have set up a forum to talk about payment services on the internet. Our forum will be a place for users to post remarks, praise or yell at the various services they have used as well as to recommend these services to other users. Your site has been identified as recommending your users to use Western Union as a payment option. Would you be willing to direct your users to us using the following banner? http://www.international-money-transfers.com/images/payments-banner-wu.gif and from your site. (alternativly a text link would suffice: TITLE: International Money Transfers Forum DESCRIPTION: Talk about International Money Transfers and Wire Transfer Services. LINK: http://international-money-transfers.com/wire-transfer-service/index.php This will be a place for them to voice their opinion on the Western Union Service. In return you are free to post in our partner forum a short or a long blurb about your business. You are even welcome to refer your customers to this page to post their praises about your excellent service! Your help would be greatly appreciated in our study. Regards Richard and Suzanna BSC students info@international-money-transfers.com\n\nThis message was not sent to the email address listed on my contact page but to an address I mention somewhere on my website that no human would find. Only an address harvesting spider would come across it. Automated address harvesting of websites is a US federal felony under the CAN SPAM ACT of 2003.\n\nIf you look at the page on my site mentioned, it talks about how Western Union is used in online fraud. It doesn't seem like whoever sent this email had personally visited the site. More likely they had done an automated Google search for the highest ranking sites mentioning Western Union and then spidered those sites for contact infomration. By getting high-ranking sites mentioning this term to link to the spammers' brand new site (created 2005-01-28, about two weeks ago), they are hoping to get a high ranking for themselves for this term.\n\nThe domain doesn't look like a university project. It's registered to a company on the British Virgin Island, not to anyone called \"Richard\" or \"Suzanna\".\n\nHere are message headers:\n\nReceived: from [66.232.22.11] (helo=mail.whsecure.net) by mxeu9.kundenserver.de with ESMTP (Nemesis), id 0MKt64-1Cyn0R13TE-0001k5; Wed, 09 Feb 2005 09:15:27 +0100 Received: (qmail 4227 invoked by uid 399); 9 Feb 2005 08:15:25 -0000 Received: from unknown (HELO BENNIE-HILL) (217.44.179.38) by mail.whsecure.net with SMTP; 9 Feb 2005 08:15:25 -0000 From: \"Richard\" <info@international-money-transfers.com> Subject: Please Link to our Money Transfer Talk Forum To: \"Spamtrap\" <spamtrap@domain> Date: Wed, 9 Feb 2005 08:15:25 +0000 Message-ID: <0MKt64-1Cyn0R13TE-0001k5@mxeu9.kundenserver.de>\n\nRegistrar Name....: Register.com Registrar Whois...: whois.register.com Registrar Homepage: http://www.register.com Domain Name: international-money-transfers.com Created on..............: 28 Jan 2005 15:13:00 Expires on..............: 28 Jan 2007 15:13:00 Administrative Info: Five Beans Limited Brendan Nash 24 De Castro Street,Wickhams Cay, Road Town, Tortola, TO BVI IO Phone: +246.447786195350 Fax..: +442079003407 Email: brendan@southeaster.com Billing Info: Five Beans Limited Brendan Nash 24 De Castro Street,Wickhams Cay, Road Town, Tortola, TO BVI IO Phone: +246.447786195350 Fax..: +442079003407 Email: brendan@southeaster.com Technical Info: Five Beans Limited Brendan Nash 24 De Castro Street,Wickhams Cay, Road Town, Tortola, TO BVI IO Phone: +246.447786195350 Fax..: +442079003407 Email: brendan@southeaster.com Registrant Info: Five Beans Limited Brendan Nash 24 De Castro Street,Wickhams Cay, Road Town, Tortola, TO BVI IO Phone: +246.447786195350 Fax..: +442079003407 Email: brendan@southeaster.com Status: Locked Domain servers in listed order: ns1.bigbighosting.com ns2.bigbighosting.com\n\nLink exchange spam from \"fraudwatchernetwork.com\"\n\nThe following link exchange spam is from what claims to be an anti-fraud site.
