        "text": "Introduction and Audio Quality Disclaimer\n\nPodcast hosts A (Ben Gilbert) and B (David Rosenthal) introduce the show and provide a disclaimer about audio quality issues in the second half of the episode.\n\nThey apologize for the audio quality but emphasize the value of the interview content.\n\n\"David and I wanted to give you a heads up that the audio quality is pretty rough in the second half.\" \"We had a problem that we didn't catch until afterwards that makes it sound like a conference call with a poor connection.\" \"However, the interview content is just awesome, so we thought it'd be a shame not to share it with all of you.\"\n\nThe hosts acknowledge the importance of audio quality and considered not releasing the episode.\n\nThey ultimately decided to share the episode due to the excellent content of the interview.\n\nIntroduction of Hosts and Guest\n\nHosts A and B introduce themselves and the show, Acquired, which covers technology, acquisitions, and IPOs.\n\nGuest C (Alfred Lennon) is introduced as a special participant in the episode.\n\n\"Welcome to season two, episode one of Acquired, the show about technology, acquisitions, and IPOs.\" \"And I'm Alfred Lennon.\"\n\nThe hosts and guest exchange greetings and express excitement about the episode's content.\n\nThe episode focuses on Zappos, and Alfred Lennon is identified as someone who can provide detailed insights into the company.\n\nAlfred Lin's Background and Role at Zappos\n\nAlfred Lin is a VC at Sequoia Capital and was the chairman and COO of Zappos prior to its acquisition by Amazon.\n\nThe hosts discuss Alfred's college days with Tony Hsieh, including a humorous anecdote about being the \"human trash compactor of pizza.\"\n\n\"Alfred is a VC at Sequoia Capital, where he is the co-head of their US venture business and represents Sequoia on the boards of many great companies such as Airbnb, Houzz, Doordash, Zipline, and many others.\" \"But today we're going to talk about his time before Sequoia, when he was the chairman and COO of Zappos.\"\n\nAlfred's role at Zappos and his relationship with Tony Hsieh are highlighted as significant to the episode's theme.\n\nThe discussion sets the stage for exploring Alfred's experiences and the history of Zappos.\n\nThe Founding of Zappos\n\nThe founder of Zappos was not Tony Hsieh but Nick Swinmurn, who started the company after a frustrating experience trying to find a specific pair of shoes.\n\nIn 1999, Swinmurn left his job as a webmaster to create Zappos, an online shoe retailer.\n\n\"The founder of Zappos was Nick Swinmurn. He had started the company because he was looking for a particular pair of shoes.\" \"This was 1999. He thought it was a good idea, and he was a webmaster. He thought it was a good idea to just quit his job and create a website and start Zappos.\"\n\nNick Swinmurn's personal shopping experience led to the creation of Zappos.\n\nThe story of Zappos' founding emphasizes the impact of individual experiences on entrepreneurial ventures.\n\nAdvertisement: Statsig\n\nHosts discuss Statsig, a company specializing in data-driven product decisions and experimentation, as a sponsor.\n\nStatsig's growth, capabilities, and customer base are highlighted, including processing 130 billion events per day.\n\n\"Statsig now processes about 130 billion events per day.\" \"They then take all the data from them, run huge statistical jobs across the whole corpus to compute the experiment results that their customers are running.\"\n\nThe hosts provide a detailed overview of Statsig's services and success.\n\nThe advertisement showcases the company's scale and the breadth of its operations.\n\nMisconceptions about Zappos and Tony Hsieh\n\nHosts discuss common misconceptions about Zappos and Tony Hsieh, including the origin of the company and Hsieh's involvement.\n\n\"When most people think of Zappos, they probably imagine it was started by a guy named Tony Hsieh who lived in Las Vegas, loved shoes, and he probably named it Zappos because he had some lifelong obsession with weird and quirky company culture.\" \"Yeah, that's right. That's not quite accurate.\"\n\nThe dialogue corrects misconceptions and provides accurate information about Zappos' beginnings.\n\nThe exchange emphasizes the importance of understanding the true history behind well-known companies.\n\nEarly Entrepreneurial Ventures and Link Exchange\n\nThe hosts and Alfred Lin discuss the early business ventures at Harvard, including the pizza business that brought Alfred, Tony Hsieh, and Sanjay Madan together.\n\nThe conversation transitions to the creation of Link Exchange, an early Internet company founded by Tony Hsieh and Sanjay Madan.\n\n\"So you were an undergrad, and you had two friends, Tony Hsieh and Sanjay Madan. And you guys decided you would develop a business together.\" \"Link Exchange came about as a fluke because when they started, Tony and Sanjay were bored at Oracle.\"\n\nThe story of the pizza business and Link Exchange provides context for the entrepreneurial spirit of Alfred and his colleagues.\n\nLink Exchange's origin story is tied to the early days of the Internet and the founders' desire to create interconnected websites.\n\nVenture Frogs and Investment Strategy\n\nAfter selling Link Exchange to Microsoft, Alfred Lin and Tony Hsieh started Venture Frogs, an investment fund.\n\nThe fund focused on concentrated investments in Internet companies, with 27 investments made over one year.\n\n\"We raised $27 million from friends and family of Link Exchange after the liquidity event.\" \"We ended up making 27 investments, but it was over one year.\"\n\nThe investment strategy of Venture Frogs is discussed, including the pace and focus of their investments.\n\nThe conversation sheds light on the early days of venture capital for Internet startups.\n\nReflections on Sequoia Capital and Michael Moritz\n\nAlfred Lin reflects on his experiences with Sequoia Capital and Michael Moritz, who mentored him and served as interim CEO of Link Exchange.\n\nThe discussion highlights Sequoia's approach to partnering with founders and the hands-on involvement in portfolio companies.\n\n\"I developed a great relationship with Sequoia and Sequoia partners. I know how they operate.\" \"The success of Sequoia has a lot to do with partnering with the founders and the management teams of their companies.\"\n\nAlfred's reflections provide insight into the venture capital industry and the role of mentorship.\n\nThe narrative underscores the importance of investor-founder relationships in the success of startups.\n\nVenture Frogs' Portfolio Management and Zappos Involvement\n\nAlfred Lin and Tony Hsieh evaluated their Venture Frogs portfolio, identifying companies that could benefit from their involvement, including Zappos.\n\nThey decided to focus their efforts on Zappos and Tellme Networks, believing they could make a significant impact.\n\n\"We looked at the portfolio and there were basically three sets of companies.\" \"There were two companies we felt like if we helped, we could make a lot of impact in those companies.
