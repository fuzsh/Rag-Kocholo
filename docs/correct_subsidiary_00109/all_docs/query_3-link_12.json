RECITALS WHEREAS, Centraal (i) is the developer and operator of an Internet service known as the \"REALNAMES SERVICE\" (defined below), (ii) maintains associated databases of such relationships which include, without limitation, directories of the registered words and phrases (each a \"REALNAME\"), if appropriate, the URL of the unique Web page associated with each RealName and related content and/or commentary. Each and every RealName is assigned to the unique registered user either (i) with a subscription paid by the registrant to Centraal, whether such subscription is paid as a fixed annual subscription fee, as a \"per resolution\" royalty, or as any other form of payment (such a RealName being referred to herein as a \"SUBSCRIBED REALNAME\") or (ii) under certain circumstances, without any compensation paid to Centraal. The RealNames Service also includes RealNames Extensions (as defined below). WHEREAS, Microsoft desires to obtain from Centraal the below specified grant of certain license rights to the Namespace (as defined below) database solely as necessary to provide the RealNames Service on the Authorized Microsoft Products (as defined below), as it is updated and enhanced throughout the term of this Agreement, and Centraal is willing to grant such rights to Microsoft, on the terms and conditions set forth herein. NOW THEREFORE, the Parties agree as follows: AGREEMENT 1. DEFINITIONS. As used herein, the following terms shall have the following meanings: 1.1 \"AFFILIATES\" means, with respect to a party, a person or entity (i) which directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries controls, or is controlled by, or is under common control with, such party, or (ii) which beneficially owns or holds 20% or more of any class of the voting stock of such party or (iii) 20% or more of the voting stock (or in the case of a person or entity which is not a corporation, 20% or more of the equity interest) of which is beneficially owned or held by such party. The term \"control\" means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person or entity, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise. 1.2 \"AUTHORIZED MICROSOFT PRODUCTS\" shall mean MSN Search and the AutoSearch feature of Microsoft Internet Explorer, as they may exist and/or evolve from time to time throughout the Term, and such other Microsoft owned or controlled online properties as the Parties may hereafter agree upon in writing. For the purposes hereof, \"MSN Search\" and \"AutoSearch\" shall mean the Web-based search engines currently available at http://search.msn.com and http://auto.search.msn.com, respectively, wherever and however such search engines may be accessed in whole or in part (including without limitation through Web sites other than those specifically referenced in this sentence). 1.3 \"COMMAND LINE\" shall mean the address line of Microsoft's Internet Explorer v5 (and all future versions thereof) (\"IE5\"), where a user may currently enter a unique URL and via AutoSearch be directed directly to the World Wide Web site associated with such unique URL. 1.4 \"DOCUMENTATION\" shall mean the materials listed in EXHIBIT A hereto and any updates thereto provided by Centraal. [*] CERTAIN INFORMATION IN THIS EXHIBIT HAS BEEN OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE COMMISSION. CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT HAS BEEN REQUESTED WITH RESPECT TO THE OMITTED PORTIONS. PAGE 1 OF 1 <PAGE> 1.5 \"MICROSOFT\" shall mean Microsoft Corporation and any and all Affiliates of Microsoft. 1.6 \"NAMESPACE\" shall collectively refer to any and all RealNames and certain information associated with each of the RealNames such as whether the RealNames are subscribed or not, the description of the Web Site or Web page associated with the RealNames, the prefix and rules associated with RealNames Extensions (if applicable). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the following fields will be included in the Namespace: (1) Subscribed RealNames sold under various pricing models; (2) other unsubscribed RealNames incorporated into the database through editorial work designed to offer a comprehensive Namespace to users; (3) a description of the Web site or Web page associated with each subscribed and unsubscribed RealName; (4) the prefix and rules associated with RealNames Extensions; (5) the MSN ID; (6) subscription status; (7) type of subscription (e.g., free, flat fee or price-per-resolution (\"PPR\")); and (8) language. 1.7 \"REALNAMES EXTENSION\" shall mean a Centraal approved RealName prefix followed by a rules-based dynamic syntax query to be applied at the host (subscriber) Web site. The Centraal resolvers will recognize the format of a RealNames Extension from a user's query, transform the RealNames Extension into an appropriate query for the host Web site for the RealName Extension subscriber, and, following such host Web site query, redirect the World Wide Web user directly to the third party URL appropriate to such RealNames Extension. By way of example \"SEC [Ticker]\" would be a RealNames Extension with SEC serving as the RealName prefix and [Ticker] serving as the dynamic syntax query that would be processed by the server located at the URL associated with the SEC RealName. RealNames Extensions may either be with or without compensation to Centraal. Fees, if charged, may be on a PPR basis (a \"PPR-based RealNames Extension\"), on an annual subscription fee basis, or by another method. 1.8 \"REALNAMES RESULT\" shall mean the appearance of a particular RealName as a result of a search query on an Authorized Microsoft Product (or Command Line query on IE5). A RealNames Result will be a precise match to the search or Command Line query (a \"PRECISE MATCH\") or, in the event that there is no Precise Match, a match or matches which are close to such search or Command Line query (a \"CLOSE MATCH\"). 1.9 \"REALNAMES SERVICE\" means Centraal's proprietary Internet addressing and search service whereby Centraal (i) assigns a particular word or phrase, in any language, to a unique Web page to assist in and allow Web navigation to such page using such word or phrase, and (ii) reviews, approves, and includes such approved word or phrase in the name of the owner of such Web site in the Namespace, and (iii) resolves a RealName such that an Internet user's browser is directed to the unique Web page associated with such RealName. 1.10 \"RESOLUTION\" shall mean the process by which a search query or Command Line query that generates a RealNames Result may be used by a user of an Authorized Microsoft Product to direct such user to the URL associated with the RealName. A Resolution also occurs when a user inputs a Precise Match Command Line query and the user is directed to the URL associated with such RealName. The mere display of a RealNames Result shall not constitute a Resolution unless the user is directed to the URL associated with the RealName. 1.11 \"TERM\" shall mean the term of this Agreement, which shall commence on the Effective Date and continue thereafter for two years, subject to earlier termination pursuant to Section 11. Following the initial Term, this Agreement may be renewed for successive one year Terms upon the written consent of both Parties at least 90 days prior to the end of the then-current Term. 1.12 \"URL\" means a unique uniform resource locator address for a World Wide Web Site, e.g., www.msn.com and www.msn.com/news and www.carpoint.msn.com are each a URL. All other capitalized terms shall have the meanings herein assigned to them herein. 2. USE OF THE NAMESPACE AND SOFTWARE. [*] CERTAIN INFORMATION IN THIS EXHIBIT HAS BEEN OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE COMMISSION. CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT HAS BEEN REQUESTED WITH RESPECT TO THE OMITTED PORTIONS. PAGE 2 OF 254 <PAGE> 2.1 DELIVERY. On the first business day after the Effective Date, Centraal agrees to deliver to Microsoft (i) one (1) copy of the Namespace, current as of the Effective Date, in the manner set forth in EXHIBIT A (which is attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference) (ii) one copy of the software described on EXHIBIT A (\"SOFTWARE\") in object code form; and (iii) one copy of the Documentation. Each day thereafter, throughout the term of this Agreement, Centraal will deliver to Microsoft a version of the Namespace current through the immediately preceding day, in the manner set forth in EXHIBIT A. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Centraal will use reasonable commercial efforts to provide to Microsoft the Namespace such that it will be possible for Microsoft to compare search queries and command queries against the then-current Namespace so as to redirect such queries to Centraal's resolvers. 2.2 DISPLAY OF REALNAMES RESULTS IN SEARCH RESULTS. Microsoft, at its own expense (except for Centraal's reasonable technical assistance which shall be provided at Centraal's reasonable expense) may, but is not obligated to, integrate the RealNames Service with the Authorized Microsoft Products, such that the Authorized Microsoft Products will access and use the Namespace to provide and display RealNames Results, in connection with end user searches and Command Line queries undertaken through the Authorized Microsoft Products as follows: (a) the Authorized Microsoft Products may include an input mechanism to prompt the user for a key word or search term; (b) Microsoft may, but is not obligated to, cause the Authorized Microsoft Products to determine which key words are appropriate for RealNames Resolutions based upon the Namespace provided to Microsoft hereunder; (c) to the extent that Microsoft integrates the RealNames Services, Microsoft shall cause its computer servers processing such determination to communicate such key words to the computer servers of Centraal, at an address and according to specifications reasonably required by Centraal; (d) Centraal, upon receipt of such key word, will cause its computer servers to perform RealNames Resolutions, and will communicate to the applicable Authorized Microsoft Product a list of the RealNames Results that correspond with such key word or search term and corresponding URLs. Nothing contained in this Agreement will be deemed to obligate Microsoft to display or use any RealName or the RealNames Service or to process or present a search string in any particular manner, except that Microsoft agrees, that if it causes any RealName to be displayed in any search result using the RealNames Service, then such RealName will appear with an \"RN\" superscript. The Parties agree to use good faith efforts to provide for the reporting of tracking of impressions of RealNames on the Authorized Microsoft Products, and the provision of such data to Centraal under mutually acceptable terms. Subject to Section 7, to the degree that Microsoft elects to integrate the RealNames Service with the Authorized Microsoft Products, Microsoft will endeavor to implement the RealNames Service on MSN Search by September 1, 1999 and on AutoSearch by August 1, 1999. 2.3 PROVISION OF REALNAMES RESOLUTIONS. In the event a user of an Authorized Microsoft Product clicks on a RealNames Result, as displayed in Section 2.2 above, or if such user has entered a query that is a Precise Match on the Command Line and is to be sent to the unique URL associated with the applicable RealName, Microsoft will direct a query which includes the RealName associated with such RealNames Result to Centraal's resolvers in a manner more fully described in EXHIBIT B (or as otherwise agreed in writing by the parties), and the user of the Authorized Microsoft Product will be directed to the unique URL associated with such RealName. 2.4 LICENSE. In furtherance of the foregoing, and subject to the limitations expressly set forth herein, Centraal grants to Microsoft and its Affiliates (i) a non-exclusive, non transferable license (without the right to sub-license except as provided below) to access, display and transmit portions of the Namespace data (as updated periodically as set forth herein), solely as necessary to provide the RealNames Service on the Authorized Microsoft Products in accordance with this Agreement; (ii) a non-exclusive, non-transferable license (without the right to sub-license except as provided below) to use, display or perform the Software, in object code or binary code form only, only as part of providing the RealNames Service on the Authorized Microsoft Products; (iii) a non-exclusive, non-transferable license (without the right to sub-license except as provided below) to use the Software solely to provide technical support for the RealNames Service on the Authorized Microsoft Products; (iv) a non-exclusive, non-transferable license (without the right to sub-license except as provided below) to use and reproduce the Software, in object code or binary code form only, solely for Microsoft's own internal business purposes in providing the RealNames Service on the Authorized Microsoft Products and solely as necessary to exercise the rights granted in this Section 2; (v) a non-exclusive, non-transferable license (without the right to sub-license [*] CERTAIN INFORMATION IN THIS EXHIBIT HAS BEEN OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE COMMISSION. CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT HAS BEEN REQUESTED WITH RESPECT TO THE OMITTED PORTIONS. PAGE 3 OF 254 <PAGE> except as provided below) to use and reproduce the Documentation, solely for Microsoft's own internal business purposes in providing the RealNames Service on the Authorized Microsoft Products and solely as necessary to exercise the rights granted in this Section 2; and (vi) a non-exclusive, non-transferable license (without the right to sub-license except as provided below) to use, reproduce, transmit, and distribute those portions of the Documentation applicable to the promotion and marketing of RealNames and the RealNames Service, solely in connection with Microsoft's promotion and marketing activities contemplated hereunder. Microsoft may sublicense the foregoing rights in connection with the distribution of the MSN portal or other services, products, or technologies that incorporate the Authorized Microsoft Products provided (i) any sublicenses shall be under terms and restrictions at least as protective of Centraal's interests as those set forth herein and (ii) Microsoft shall not be entitled to sublicense its rights to use Namespace database. 2.5 OWNERSHIP IN CENTRAAL MATERIALS. As between Centraal and Microsoft, Centraal will retain all right, title, and interest in the Namespace, the Software, the Documentation, other Confidential Information (as defined in Section 9 below) disclosed by Centraal (collectively, \"CENTRAAL MATERIALS\") and all intellectual property rights therein. Microsoft will not, and will not authorize any third party to translate, disable, decompile, disassemble, reverse compile, reverse engineer, or decode the Software or in any other manner reduce the Software to human perceivable form, except and only to the extent that such activity is expressly permitted by applicable law notwithstanding this limitation. Microsoft will not, and will not authorize any third party to (i) create derivative works of, or alter or ha any way modify the Centraal Materials without the prior written consent of Centraal, or (ii) use any proprietary Centraal Materials or other proprietary Namespace data to construct, reverse engineer or assemble any database or Internet addressing tool, including without limitation, a URL database, except and only to the extent that such activity is expressly permitted by applicable law notwithstanding this limitation. Microsoft shall not export the Namespace outside of the United States without Centraal's prior written permission, which permission shall not unreasonably be withheld or delayed, provided that the foregoing shall not be deemed to restrict or prohibit the ability of Microsoft to allow end users outside the United States to access or use the Namespace or the RealNames Service via Authorized Microsoft products. Centraal hereby reserves all rights not expressly granted to Microsoft in this Agreement. On each copy of the Centraal Materials reproduced or displayed, Microsoft shall reproduce all copyright or other proprietary notices contained on Centraal Materials.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or any other agreement between Microsoft and Centraal, during the term of this Agreement, Microsoft shall not be obligated to pay Centraal any compensation whatsoever (including without limitation PPR subscription royalties) in connection with any Resolution of any RealName subscribed by Microsoft, if such Resolution is generated through a search request submitted through an Authorized Microsoft Product. 3. MAINTENANCE AND GROWTH OF NAMESPACE. Centraal agrees to use all commercially reasonable efforts to expand, distribute, and manage and maintain the Namespace and the RealNames Service.

Any Net Additional Resolution Fees shall not be considered in determining whether a subscriber has reached a Centraal-negotiated, PPR based cap. 6.3 Accountings. Centraal shall develop, implement and maintain the technology required to track Resolutions. Within fifteen (15) days following the end of each month beginning with the Effective Date, Centraal will deliver to Microsoft a complete and accurate written report covering such month, including, the amount payable to Microsoft and sufficient detail to reasonably calculate the basis for such payment. Concurrently with the submission of each such written report by Centraal, Centraal shall pay to Microsoft all amounts then owed to Microsoft pursuant to Sections 6.1 and 6.2. Each party shall raise any questions or issues regarding the accuracy of such report (and payments in accordance therewith) within two years following the submission of such reports or payments. Failure to raise any question or issue within such two year period, shall be deemed acceptance of such report and payment. 6.4 Audits. During the period in which Centraal is required to account to Microsoft pursuant to Section 6.3, and for one year thereafter, Central agrees to keep all usual and proper entries relating to the calculation of amounts owed to Microsoft by Centraal hereunder. During the above-referenced period, Microsoft shall have the right to cause an audit and/or inspection to be made of the applicable records of Centraal in order to verify statements issued by Centraal (an \"Audit\"). Any such Audit shall be conducted by an independent certified public accountant (other than on a contingent fee basis) mutually acceptable to the parties (the \"Auditor\"). Except as specified herein, Microsoft shall be responsible for all costs and attorney fees related to such Audits. Centraal agrees to provide the Auditor reasonable access to the relevant records upon reasonable notice and during regular business hours. Such Audits shall be made no more often than once every twelve (12) months. If an audit reveals that reports provided by Centraal are inaccurate in the amount of by ten percent (10%) or more then the reasonable cost of such Audit shall be paid by Centraal. In the event that the Audit establishes that Centraal owes additional amounts to Microsoft, then Centraal shall promptly pay such amounts to Microsoft. In the event that the Audit establishes that Centraal has overcompensated Microsoft, then Centraal shall have the right to withhold such amounts from future payments to Microsoft.

DELIVERY PROCESS Real Names System Data Format and Delivery Process Real Names System Data Format The Real Names System will be presented in the format known to the parties as \"Orbiter\" or such other format which is subsequently mutually agreed upon by the parties. There will be five fields per record: cn = the common name in its presentation form (also known as a RealName) dsc = the Web page description lc = the locale (e.g. \"en:US\" the US English language) pm= pricing model (\"flt\" is flat rate, \"ppr\" is price per resolution) ns = namespace (\"rn.0\" is a paid RealName, \"rn.1\" is a editorialized RealName, \"rn.2\" is a crawled RealName) Example: < rn cn=\"Disney\" dsc=\"The Web Site For Families.\" lc=\"en-US\" pm=\"ppr\" ns=\"rn.0\"/ > Delivery Process A data file containing the entire RNS (Real Names System) will be delivered from Centraal Corporation to Microsoft. The data file will conform to the layout described in the above section called RNS Data Format. Centraal assumes responsibility for the delivery of this data file, and will manage the processes around its successful delivery. Centraal will build this data file every 24 hours, from its primary RNS database. After the successful completion of the build, Centraal will compress the file using PKZip. Centraal will FTP the file to a designated, Microsoft controlled FTP server. The file name inside of the pkzip will be rn.xml. The ZIP file will be named rn-mmddyy.zip (where mm=month, dd=day, yy=year is the date when the upload occurs). It is the responsibility of Microsoft to provide Centraal's primary technical contact with the hostname, user name and password to enable the upload. The account should have write capabilities at all times. The desired upload path should be set to the default login path of the user account supplied. The user account/machine should have sufficient disk space available to upload a file size of 150 Megabytes daily. It is also Microsoft's responsibility to designate a time of day for the file to be uploaded, and communicate such time to Centraal's primary technical contact. In the event that Centraal encounters a problem delivering the data file that is not surmountable within 1 hour of scheduled delivery time (e.g. insufficient disk space, machine unreachable, invalid account, etc.), it is the responsibility of Centraal to contact the Microsoft Technical Point of Contact within 24 hours of encountering the problem. In the event that Microsoft encounters a technical problem (e.g. file was not delivered at the mutually agreed upon time, data file incomplete, etc.), it is the responsibility of Microsoft to contact the Centraal Technical Point of Contact within 24 hours of encountering the problem.

DESCRIPTION OF DOCUMENTATION Materials useful and necessary to the marketing of RealNames and materials useful and necessary for technical implementation of the RealNames Services by Microsoft. [*] CERTAIN INFORMATION IN THIS EXHIBIT HAS BEEN OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE COMMISSION. CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT HAS BEEN REQUESTED WITH RESPECT TO THE OMITTED PORTIONS. PAGE 16 OF 254 <PAGE> EXHIBIT B PROCESS FOR GENERATING REALNAMES RESOLUTIONS EXPLANATION OF REALNAMES RESOLVERS To the extent that Microsoft implements the RealNames Services in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, the provisions of this EXHIBIT B shall be applicable. If Microsoft does not implement the RealNames Service, none of the provisions of this Exhibit B shall be applicable. Microsoft will implement Centraal's resolution process methodology (the \"Ternary Responder\") for exact matches. Exact matches will be determined by comparing the user query to the static and rule based RealNames supplied by Centraal as part of the periodical RealNames database updates. Centraal will provide Microsoft with an initial electronic dump of the RealNames Database and then with an electronic update of the RealNames database. The RealNames database updates will be periodically propagated to Microsoft live implementation of the ternary responder. The RealNames database provided by Centraal will include the following fields: RealName: The RealName string (e.g. \"Internet Explorer 5\") Locale: The language of the Web page (e.g. \"en-US\") RealNames link: The resolver URL. This URL points to the RealNames resolver and embeds the RealName string, provider identifier and locale information. RealNames Pricing Model: The type of pricing model for the RealName. The possible values are PPR (priced per resolution) or FLT (flat maintenance fee). RealNames Namespace Code: A namespace identifier code (e.g. \"rn.0.s\" means paid for static RealNames \"rn.0.r\" rule based RealNames, rn.l\" means editorialized RealNames, \"rn.2\" means crawled RealNames) Microsoft will provide a schema specification for serializing and encoding the RealNames data. When a user performs a search, Microsoft's implementation of the Ternary Responder will assess whether there is an exact match in the RealNames database. If there is, two different cases need to be considered. The first case occurs in the context of an IE5 auto-search where Microsoft's implementation will immediately redirect the user to the RealNames URL. In turn, the RealNames resolver will redirect the user to the URL associated with the specified RealName. For example, a user types the query string \"Internet Explorer 5\" in IE5. \"Internet Explorer 5\" is an exact match. Microsoft will redirect the user to RealNames link for \"Internet Explorer 5\": http://navigation.realnames.com/Resolver.dll?action=navigation&providerID= 15&realname=internet+explorer+5+&locale=en-US The second case occurs in the context of a traditional search on MSN. When a user performs a search query on the search engine, if there is an exact match, Microsoft will display the RealNames text on the results page. The RealNames text is made of the RealNames string with the RN superscript, and a brief description of the RealName. The RealNames string is hyper-linked using the RealNames link URL. For example, a user types the query string \"Internet Explorer 5\" on MSN. \"Internet Explorer 5\" is an exact match. Thus, MSN displays the RealNames text that contains the RealNames link. The RealNames text at the MSN site can be displayed as agreed upon by both Microsoft and Centraal. INTERNET EXPLORER 5RN [*] CERTAIN INFORMATION IN THIS EXHIBIT HAS BEEN OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE COMMISSION. CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT HAS BEEN REQUESTED WITH RESPECT TO THE OMITTED PORTIONS. PAGE 17 OF 254 <PAGE> The RealNames link takes you directly to Internet Explorer 5. The URL associated with the RealNames link \"Internet Explorer 5\" that identifies MSN as the source of the resolutions is: http://navagation.realnames.com/Resolver.dll?action=navigate&providerID= 101&realname=internet+explorer+5 When the user clicks on the RealNames link for \"Internet Explorer 5\", a resolution request is sent to the RealNames resolver located on Centraal servers. This request embeds the RealName \"Internet Explorer 5\" as well as a provider ID that uniquely identifies MSN as the originator for the resolution. The RealNames resolver located on Centraal server looks up the URL associated with the RealName address \"Internet Explorer 5\", logs the resolution parameters and redirects the user to that URL.

PAGE 18 OF 254 <PAGE> EXHIBIT C FORM OF SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT REALNAMES SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT A. INTRODUCTION. This RealNames Subscription Agreement (\"Agreement\") is submitted to CENTRAAL CORPORATION (\"CENTRAAL\") for the purpose of subscribing to CENTRAAL's RealNames Service (SM) on the Internet through CENTRAAL's subscription system also known as the RealNames System (SM). If this Agreement is accepted by CENTRAAL, and a RealNames (SM) address is allocated in CENTRAAL's Web address system to the Subscriber (\"Subscriber\"), Subscriber agrees to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. B. FEES AND PAYMENTS. Subscriber agrees to pay a NON-REFUNDABLE fee of one hundred United States dollars (US $100) per year in consideration of each subscribed RealNames address. The payment may be made payable either directly to \"CENTRAAL Corporation,\" or indirectly to CENTRAAL through a certified reseller. This NON-REFUNDABLE fee covers a period of one (1) year for each new subscription or reservation of a RealNames address. This NON-REFUNDABLE fee includes any permitted modification(s) to the RealNames address record during the subscription or reservation. It also covers up to ten thousand (10,000) uses of the RealNames address per calendar month; CENTRAAL reserves the right to stop processing uses of the RealNames address after ten thousand (10,000) uses in a calendar month. Subscribers will be notified by CENTRAAL when a RealNames address usage exceeds ten thousand (10,000) uses per calendar month. Subscribers of a RealNames address which usage exceeds ten thousand (10,000) uses per calendar month will be subject to additional usage fees, at a rate to be agreed upon by CENTRAAL and Subscriber in advance of such charges. In the event that CENTRAAL and Subscriber cannot agree on such fees, Subscriber understands and agrees that CENTRAAL may terminate this Agreement without liability, including Subscriber's use of any RealNames address. All payments will be due within thirty (30) days from the date of invoice. Subscriber understands and agrees that CENTRAAL may cancel Subscriber's subscription or reservation in the event that any payment is not made when due. On the date of expiration, RealNames address subscriptions will be automatically renewed for the period of one year, unless the Subscriber notifies CENTRAAL in writing of its intention not to renew the RealNames subscription. Notification to cancel automatic renewals must be communicated to CENTRAAL by fax (1-650-298-8085) or email (sales@centraal.com) at least ten days prior to the RealNames subscription expiration date. Automatic renewals will be billed at CENTRAAL's then-current annual subscription price. C. ALLOCATION OF REALNAMES ADDRESSES BY CENTRAAL. Subscriber agrees that allocation of RealNames addresses by CENTRAAL is subject to CENTRAAL's discretion. CENTRAAL may at any time, with notice to Subscriber that is reasonable in the circumstances (including immediate notice when that is appropriate) reallocate a RealNames address previously or currently used by Subscriber. Any notice provided to Subscriber will be at the last address furnished by Subscriber to CENTRAAL. Subscriber understands that all systems of address with respect to the Internet are subject to varied and occasionally inconsistent principles, jurisdictions, and claims of right. Subscriber understands and agrees that CENTRAAL requires absolute discretion over the allocation of RealNames addresses in light of the uncertain and often conflicting principles that are at work in the current state of the Internet. Subscriber understands and agrees that, because of CENTRAAL's discretion, CENTRAAL has the absolute right to allocate RealNames addresses, withdraw them, and reallocate them according to its own judgment as to what constitutes an optimal service and system. Subscriber further recognizes that CENTRAAL, with a view to optimizing its RealNames Service and RealNames Services, may apply standards of decision [*] CERTAIN INFORMATION IN THIS EXHIBIT HAS BEEN OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE COMMISSION. CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT HAS BEEN REQUESTED WITH RESPECT TO THE OMITTED PORTIONS. PAGE 19 OF 254 <PAGE> regarding allocation, reallocation, or withdrawal of RealNames addresses that evolve or change over time. If CENTRAAL does not approve any RealNames address requested by Subscriber, or withdraws approval of, a RealNames address, CENTRAAL will attempt to provide an alternative RealNames address that is acceptable to both CENTRAAL and Subscriber. Subscriber accords to CENTRAAL the right to make decisions that it deems best in each context. Subscriber understands that CENTRAAL has no dispute resolution system. Subscriber also agrees that all goodwill in any RealNames address as an address in the RealNames Service, and all property rights in any RealNames address as an address in the RealNames Service, belong exclusively to CENTRAAL. Subscriber's use of the RealNames Service confers no property, business, or competition rights upon Subscriber. D. DISPUTES.
