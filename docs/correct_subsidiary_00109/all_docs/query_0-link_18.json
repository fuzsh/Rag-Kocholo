        "text": "Operational Transactions\n\nIn November 1998, Microsoft acquired LinkExchange, Inc., a leading provider of online marketing services to Web site owners and small- and medium-sized businesses. Microsoft paid $265 million in stock.\n\nIn November 1999, Expedia, Inc. completed an initial public offering of its common stock. Expedia, which is majority-owned by Microsoft, is a leading provider of branded online travel services for leisure and small business travelers. Expedias financial results and financial condition are consolidated with the operations of Microsoft.\n\nIn January 2000, the Company merged with Visio Corporation in a transaction that was accounted for as a pooling of interests. Microsoft issued 14 million shares in the exchange for the outstanding stock of Visio. Visios assets and liabilities, which were nominal, are included with those of Microsoft as of the merger. Operating results for Visio from periods prior to the merger were not material to the combined results of the two companies. Accordingly, the financial statements for such periods have not been restated.\n\nIn July 2000, the Company acquired an interest in Telewest Communications plc for approximately $2.6 billion in stock. Telewest is a leading broadband cable communications operator in the United Kingdom.\n\nIn April 2001, the Company acquired Great Plains Software, Inc. for approximately $1.1 billion in stock. Great Plains is a leading supplier of mid-market business applications. The acquisition was accounted for by the purchase method and operating results for Great Plains subsequent to the date of acquisition are included with those of Microsoft. The pro forma impact of Great Plains operating results prior to the date of acquisition was not material."
