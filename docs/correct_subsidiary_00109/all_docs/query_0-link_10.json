The annual meeting of the shareholders of the Corporation for the election of directors and for the transaction of such other business as properly may be submitted to such annual meeting, shall be held at the hour and on the date designated by the Board of Directors or an authorized committee of the Board of Directors, such date to be within 150 days of the end of the fiscal year. 1.2 Special Meetings. Special meetings of the shareholders of the Corporation, for any purpose or purposes, may be called at any time by the Board of Directors or an authorized committee of the Board of Directors. 1.3 Place of Meetings. Meetings of shareholders shall be held at such place within or without the State of Washington as determined by the Board of Directors, or an authorized committee of the Board, pursuant to proper notice. 1.4 Notice. Written or electronic notice of each shareholders' meeting stating the date, time, and place and, in case of a special meeting, the purpose(s) for which such meeting is called, shall be given by the Corporation not less than ten (10) (unless a greater period of notice is required by law in a particular case) nor more than sixty (60) days prior to the date of the meeting, to each shareholder of record, to the shareholder's address as it appears on the current record of shareholders of the Corporation. 1.5 Quorum of Shareholders. At any meeting of the shareholders, a majority in interest of all the shares entitled to vote on a matter, represented by shareholders of record in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum of that voting group for action on that matter. Once a share is represented at a meeting, other than to object to holding the meeting or transacting business, it is deemed to be present for quorum purposes for the remainder of the meeting and for any adjournment of that meeting unless a new record date is or must be set for the adjourned meeting. At such reconvened meeting, any business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified. If a quorum exists, action on a matter is approved by a voting group if the votes cast within the voting group favoring the action exceed the votes cast within the voting group opposing the action, unless the question is one upon which by express provision of the Washington Business Corporation Act, as amended (\"WBCA\"), or of the Articles of Incorporation or of these Bylaws a different vote is required. 1.6 Adjournment. A majority of the shares represented at the meeting, even if less than a quorum, may adjourn the meeting from time to time. At such reconvened meeting at which a quorum is present any business may be transacted at the meeting as originally notified. If a meeting is adjourned to a different date, time, or place, notice need not be given of the new date, time, or place if a new date, time, or place is announced at the meeting before adjournment; however, if a new record date for the adjourned meeting is or must be fixed in accordance with the WBCA, notice of the adjourned meeting must be given to persons who are shareholders as of the new record date.\n\n1.7 Record Date and Transfer Books. For the purpose of determining shareholders who are entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of shareholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend, or in order to make a determination of shareholders for any other proper purpose, the Board of Directors may fix in advance a record date for any such determination of shareholders, such date in any case to be not more than seventy (70) days and, in case of a meeting of shareholders, not less than ten (10) days prior to the date on which the particular action, requiring such determination of shareholders, is to be taken. If no record date is fixed for such purposes, the date on which notice of the meeting is given or the date on which the resolution of the Board of Directors declaring such dividend is adopted, as the case may be, shall be the record date for such determination of shareholders. When a determination of shareholders entitled to vote at any meeting of shareholders has been made as provided in this section, such determination shall apply to any adjournment thereof, unless the Board of Directors fixes a new record date, which it must do if the meeting is adjourned more than one hundred twenty (120) days after the date is fixed for the original meeting. 1.8 Voting Record. The officer or agent having charge of the stock transfer books for shares of the Corporation shall make at least ten (10) days before each meeting of shareholders a complete record of the shareholders entitled to vote at such meeting or any adjournment thereof, arranged by any applicable voting groups and in alphabetical order, with the address of and the number of shares held by each. Such record shall be produced and kept open at the time and place of the meeting and shall be subject to the inspection of any shareholder or any shareholder's agent during the whole time of the meeting for the purposes thereof. 1.9 Proxies. Shareholders of record may vote at any meeting either in person or by proxy. A shareholder may appoint a proxy to vote for the shareholder by submission of (a) an appointment form signed by the shareholder or the shareholder's attorney-in-fact, or (b) an electronic transmission sent in accordance with the provisions for electronic notice under Section 3.3. An appointment of proxy is effective when an appointment form or an electronic transmission (or documentary evidence thereof, including verification information) is received by the person authorized to tabulate votes for the Corporation. The proxy has the same power to vote as that possessed by the shareholder, unless the appointment form or electronic transmission contains an express limitation on the power to vote or direction as to how to vote the shares on a particular matter, in which event the Corporation must tabulate the votes in a manner consistent with that limitation or direction. An appointment of proxy is valid for eleven (11) months unless a longer period is expressly provided in the appointment form or electronic transmission. 1.10 Organization of Meeting. The officer designated by the Chief Executive Officer (or in his absence, any other officer designated by the Board of Directors) may call any meeting of shareholders to order and shall be the Chairman thereof. The Secretary of the Corporation, if present at any meeting of its shareholders, shall act as the Secretary of such meeting. If the Secretary is absent from any such meeting, the Chairman of such meeting may appoint a Secretary for the meeting. 1.11 Order of Business. The Chairman of a meeting of shareholders, determined in accordance with Section 1.10, shall have discretion to establish the order of business for such meeting subject to any specific order established by the Board of Directors. Bylaws of Microsoft Corporation--Page 2\n\nARTICLE II Board of Directors 2.1 Number and Qualifications. The business affairs and property of the Corporation shall be managed by a Board of not less than three directors nor more than eleven directors. The number of directors may at any time be increased or decreased by resolution of the Board of Directors or by the shareholders at the annual meeting. Directors need not be shareholders of the Corporation or residents of the State of Washington. 2.2 Election - Term of Office. The directors shall be elected by the shareholders at each annual shareholders' meeting to hold office until the next annual meeting of the shareholders and until their respective successors are elected and qualified. If, for any reason, the directors shall not have been elected at any annual meeting, they may be elected at a special meeting of shareholders called for that purpose in the manner provided by these Bylaws. 2.3 Regular Meetings. Regular meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held at such places, and at such times as the Board may determine, and, if so determined, no notice thereof need be given. A regular meeting of the Board of Directors may be held without notice immediately after the annual meeting of shareholders at the same place at which such meeting was held. 2.4 Special Meetings. Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be held at any time or place upon the call of a majority of directors, the Chief Executive Officer or the Chief Operating Officer. 2.5 Notice. No notice is required for regular meetings of the Board of Directors. Notice of special meetings of the Board of Directors, stating the date, time, and place thereof, shall be given in a manner described in Section 3.3 at least two (2) days prior to the date of the meeting. The purpose of the meeting need not be given in the notice. 2.6 Waiver of Notice. A director may waive notice of a special meeting of the Board of Directors either before or after the meeting, and such waiver shall be deemed to be the equivalent of giving notice. The waiver must be in given in accordance with the requirements of written or electronic notice in Section 3.3. Attendance or participation of a director at a meeting shall constitute waiver of notice of that meeting unless said director attends or participates for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of business because the meeting has not been lawfully called or convened. 2.7 Quorum of Directors. A majority of the members of the Board of Directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, but if at any meeting of the Board there shall be less than a quorum present, a majority of those present may adjourn the meeting from time to time until a quorum shall have been obtained. When a quorum is present at any meeting, a majority of the members present shall decide any question brought before such meeting, except as otherwise provided by the Articles of Incorporation or by these Bylaws. 2.8 Adjournment. A majority of the directors present, even if less than a quorum, may adjourn a meeting and continue it to a later time. Notice of the adjourned meeting or of the business to be transacted thereat, other than by announcement, shall not be necessary. At any adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present, any business may be transacted which could have been transacted at the meeting as originally called. Bylaws of Microsoft Corporation--Page 3\n\n2.9 Resignation. Any director of the Corporation may resign at any time by giving written notice to the Board of Directors, the Chairman, the President, or the Secretary of the Corporation. Any such resignation is effective when the notice is delivered, unless the notice specifies a later effective date. 2.10 Vacancies. Unless otherwise provided by the WBCA, in case of any vacancy in the Board of Directors, including a vacancy resulting from an increase in the number of directors, the remaining directors, whether constituting a quorum or not, may fill the vacancy. 2.11 Compensation. The Board of Directors shall have the sole authority to fix the amount of compensation of directors. 2.12 Committees. The Board of Directors, by resolution adopted by a majority of the full Board, may designate from among its members one or more committees, each of which: a. Shall have two (2) or more members; b. Shall be governed by the same rules regarding meetings, action without meetings, notice, and waiver of notice, and quorum and voting requirements as applied to the Board; and c. To the extent provided in such resolution, shall have and may exercise all the authority of the Board, except no such committee shall have the authority to: (1) Authorize or approve a distribution except according to a general formula or method prescribed by the Board; (2) Approve or propose to shareholders action which the WBCA requires to be approved by shareholders; (3) Fill vacancies on the Board or on any of its committees; (4) Amend the Articles of Incorporation; (5) Adopt, amend, or repeal the Bylaws; (6) Approve a plan of merger not requiring shareholder approval; or (7) Authorize or approve the issuance or sale or contract for sale of shares, or determine the designation and relative rights, preferences, and limitations on a class or series of shares, except that the Board may authorize a committee, or a senior executive officer of the Corporation, to do so within limits specifically prescribed by the Board. ARTICLE III Special Measures Applying to Meetings of Shareholders, the Board of Directors and Committees of the Board 3.1 Action by Unanimous Consent. Any action required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of the Board of Directors or a committee of the Board may be accomplished without a meeting if the action is taken by all the members of the Board or all the members of the committee, as the case may be. The action must be evidenced by one or more consents describing the action to be taken, given by all directors or all members of the committee, as the case may be, to the Corporation for inclusion in the minutes in a manner equivalent to written or Bylaws of Microsoft Corporation--Page 4\n\nelectronic notice under Section 3.3. Directors' consents may be given either before or after the action taken. Action taken by unanimous consent is effective when the last director consents to the action, unless the consent specifies a later effective date. 3.2 Use of Communications Equipment. Meetings of the shareholders, the Board of Directors and committees of the Board may be effectuated by means of a conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other during the meeting. Participation by such means shall constitute presence in person at such meeting. 3.3 Oral, Written and Electronic Notice. Terms used in this Bylaw shall be as defined in the WBCA. Oral notice may be communicated in person or by telephone, wire or wireless equipment that does not transmit a facsimile of the notice. Oral notice is effective when communicated if communicated in a comprehensible manner. Written notice may be transmitted by mail, private carrier, or personal delivery; telegraph or teletype; or telephone, wire, or wireless equipment that transmits a facsimile of the notice and provides the transmitter with an electronically generated receipt. Written notice is effective at the earliest of the following: (a) when received; (b) five (5) days after its deposit in the U.S. mail if mailed with first-class postage, to the address as it appears on the current records of the Corporation; (c) on the date shown on the return receipt, if sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, and the receipt is signed by or on behalf of the addressee. Written notice to a shareholder is effective (a) when mailed, if mailed with first class postage prepaid; and (b) when dispatched, if prepaid, by air courier. Notices to directors and shareholders from the Corporation and from directors and shareholders to the Corporation may be provided in an electronic transmission which contains or is accompanied by information from which it can be reasonably verified that the transmission was authorized by the shareholder or by the shareholder's attorney-in-fact. Subject to contrary provisions in the WBCA, notice to shareholders or directors in an electronic transmission shall be effective only with respect to shareholders and directors that have consented, in the form of a record, to receive electronically transmitted notices and that have designated in the consent the address, location, or system to which these notices may be electronically transmitted and with respect to a notice that otherwise complies with any other requirements of the WBCA and any applicable federal law. A shareholder or director who has consented to receipt of electronically transmitted notices may revoke this consent by delivering a revocation to the Corporation in the form of a record. The consent of any shareholder or director is revoked if (a) the Corporation is unable to electronically transmit two consecutive notices given by the Corporation in accordance with the consent, and (b) this inability becomes known to the Secretary, the transfer agent, or any other person responsible for giving the notice. The inadvertent failure by the Corporation to treat this inability as a revocation does not invalidate any meeting or other action. ARTICLE IV Officers 4.1 Positions. The officers of the Corporation may consist of a Chairman, a Chief Executive Officer, a President, one or more Vice Presidents (who may be designated as Corporate Vice Presidents, Senior Vice Presidents, Executive Vice Presidents or Group Vice Presidents), a Secretary and a Treasurer as appointed by the Board of Directors or the Chief Executive Officer. The Corporation may have such additional or assistant officers (sometimes referred to as \"additional officers\") as the Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer or Chief Bylaws of Microsoft Corporation--Page 5\n\nOperating Officer may deem necessary for its business and may appoint from time to time. The Board of Directors shall also have the authority, but shall not be required, to designate officers as the Chief Operating Officer, the Chief Financial Officer or similar such titles. Any two or more offices may be held by the same person. If a director/officer has not been designated as Chairman, or if the designated Chairman is not present at a meeting, the Board of Directors shall elect a Chairman from amongst its members to serve as Chairman of the Board of Directors for such meeting. The Chairman shall preside at all meetings of the Board of Directors, and shall have such other powers as the Board may determine. 4.2 Appointment and Term of Office. The officers of the Corporation shall be appointed annually by the Board of Directors at the first meeting of the Board held after each annual meeting of the shareholders. If officers are not appointed at such meeting, such appointment shall occur as soon as possible thereafter, or may be left vacant. Each officer shall hold office until a successor shall have been appointed and qualified or until said officer's earlier death, resignation, or removal. 4.3 Authority and Duties of the Chief Executive Officer. The Chief Executive Officer shall have general charge and supervision of the business of the Corporation, shall see that all orders, actions and resolutions of the Board of Directors are carried out, and shall have such other authority and shall perform such other duties as set forth in these Bylaws or, to the extent consistent with the Bylaws, such other authorities and duties as prescribed by the Board. 4.4 Authority and Duties of Other Officers. Each officer other than the Chief Executive Officer shall have the authority and shall perform the duties set forth in these Bylaws or, to the extent consistent with the Bylaws, the duties prescribed by the Board of Directors, by the Chief Executive Officer, or by an officer authorized by the Board to prescribe the duties of such officer. Any designation of duties by the Chief Executive Officer or other officer shall be subject to review by the Board of Directors but shall be in full force and effect in the absence of such review. 4.5 Compensation and Contract Rights. The Board of Directors shall have authority (a) to fix the compensation, whether in the form of salary, bonus, stock options or otherwise, of all officers and employees of the Corporation, either specifically or by formula applicable to particular classes of officers or employees, and (b) to authorize officers of the Corporation to fix the compensation of subordinate employees. The Board of Directors shall have authority to appoint a Compensation Committee and may delegate to such committee any or all of its authority relating to compensation. The appointment of an officer shall not of itself create contract rights. 4.6 Resignation or Removal. Any officer of the Corporation may resign at any time by giving notice to the Board of Directors or the Corporation. Any such resignation is effective when the notice is given, unless the notice specifies a later date, and shall be without prejudice to the contract rights, if any, of such officer. The Board of Directors, by majority vote of the entire Board, may remove any officer or agent, with or without cause. An officer or assistant officer, if appointed by another officer, may also be removed by any officer authorized to appoint officers or assistant officers. The removal shall be without prejudice to the contract rights, if any, of the person so removed. 4.7 Vacancies. If any office becomes vacant by any reason, the directors may appoint a successor or successors who shall hold office for the unexpired term or leave such office vacant. Bylaws of Microsoft Corporation--Page 6\n\nARTICLE V Certificates of Shares and Their Transfer 5.1 Issuance; Certificates of Shares. No shares of the Corporation shall be issued unless authorized by the Board of Directors. Such authorization shall include the maximum number of shares to be issued, the consideration to be received, and a statement that the Board of Directors considers the consideration to be adequate. Shares may but need not be represented by certificates. Certificates for shares of the Corporation shall be in such form as is consistent with the provisions of the WBCA or the law of a predecessor corporation and after the effective date of these Bylaws shall state: a. The name of the Corporation and that the Corporation is organized under the laws of the State of Washington; b. The name of the person to whom issued; and c. The number and class of shares and the designation of the series, if any, which such certificate represents. The certificate shall be signed by original or facsimile signature of two officers of the Corporation, and the seal of the Corporation may be affixed thereto. 5.2 Rules and Regulations Concerning the Issue, Transfer and Registration of Shares. The Board of Directors shall have power and authority to make all such rules and regulations as the Board may deem proper or expedient concerning the issue, transfer and registration of shares of stock. In case of the loss, mutilation, or destruction of a certificate of stock, a duplicate certificate may be issued upon such terms as the Board of Directors shall authorize. The Board of Directors shall have power and authority to appoint from time to time one or more transfer agents and registrar of the shares of stock. 5.3 Shares without Certificates. The Board of Directors may authorize the issue of some or all of the shares without certificates. Within a reasonable time after the issue or transfer of shares without certificates, the Corporation shall send the shareholder a written statement of the information required on certificates by the WBCA. ARTICLE VI Books and Records 6.1 Books of Accounts, Minutes, and Share Register. Except as otherwise provided by law the Corporation: a.

Continuous Status as a Consultant or Advisor shall not be considered terminated if such person accepts employment with the Company, and thereafter a person's Continuous Status as an Employee, and the effects of an interruption or termination thereof (including by reason of death or disability), shall be determined with reference to the Company's 1991 Stock Option Plan.

The Shares may be authorized, but unissued, or reacquired Common Stock. If an Option should expire or become unexercisable for any reason without having been exercised in full, the unpurchased Shares which were subject thereto shall, unless the Plan shall have been terminated, become available for future grant under the Plan. 4. Administration of the Plan. (a) Procedure. The Plan shall be administered by the Board of Directors of the Company. (1) The Board of Directors may appoint a Committee, consisting of not less than two members of the Board of Directors, to administer the Plan on behalf of the Board of Directors, subject to such terms and conditions as the Board of Directors may prescribe. Once appointed, such Committee shall continue to serve until otherwise directed by the Board of Directors. (2) The Board of Directors may, from time to time, increase the size of the Committee and appoint additional members thereof, remove members (with or without cause) and appoint new members in substitution therefor, fill vacancies however caused, or remove all members of the Committee and thereafter directly administer the Plan. (b) Powers of the Board. Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Board shall have the authority, in its discretion: (i) to grant Nonqualified Stock Options; (ii) to determine, in accordance with Section 8(b) of the Plan, the fair market value of the Common Stock; (iii) to determine, in accordance with Section 8(a) of the Plan, the exercise price per share of Options to be granted, (iv) to determine the individuals to whom, and the time or times at which, options shall be granted and the number of Shares to be represented by each Option; (v) to interpret the Plan; (vi) to prescribe, amend, and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan; (vii) to determine the terms and provisions of each Option granted (which need not be identical) and, with the consent of the holder thereof, modify or amend each Option; (viii) to reduce the exercise price per share of outstanding and unexercised Options; (ix) to accelerate or defer (with the consent of the Optionee) the exercise date of any Option; (x) to authorize any person to execute, on behalf of the Company, any instrument required to effectuate the grant of an Option previously granted by the Board; and (xi) to make all other determinations deemed necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan.

(a) Options may be granted to consultants and advisors who provide consulting services to the Company. In no event shall any employees (full-time or part-time) of the Company be eligible for the grant of an Option under the Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the fact that an Optionee subsequently becomes an employee of the Company shall not affect 2.\n\nsuch Optionee's Option, so long as the Optionee's Continuous Status as a Consultant or Advisor was uninterrupted prior to his or her commencement of employment with the Company. (b) Nothing in the Plan or any Option granted hereunder shall confer upon any Optionee any right to continue or require the continuance of the Optionee's consulting or advisory relationship with the Company, nor shall it interfere in any way with the Optionee's right or the Company's right to terminate such relationship at any time, with or without cause. 6. Term of Plan. The Plan shall become effective upon its adoption by the Board and shall continue in effect for ten (10) years, unless sooner terminated under Section 14 of the Plan. 7. Term of option. The term of each Option shall be no more than ten (10) years from the date of grant. 8. Exercise Price and Consideration. (a) The per Share exercise price under each Option shall be such price as is determined by the Board, which price may be less than, equal to, or greater than the fair market value per Share on the date of grant. (b) The fair market value per Share shall be the closing price per share of the Common Stock on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation (\"NASDAQ\") National Market System on the date of grant. If the Common Stock ceases to be listed on the NASDAQ National Market System, the Board shall designate an alternative method of determining the fair market value of the Common Stock. (c) The consideration to be paid for the Shares to be issued upon exercise; of an Option, including the method of payment, shall be determined by the Board at the time of grant and may consist of cash and/or check. Payment may also be made by delivering a properly executed exercise notice, together with irrevocable instructions to a broker to promptly deliver to the Company the amount of sale proceeds necessary to pay the exercise price. (d) Prior to issuance of the Shares upon exercise of an Option, the Optionee shall pay any federal, state, and local withholding obligations of the Company, if applicable. 9. Exercise of Option. (a) Procedure for Exercise; Rights as a Stockholder. Any Option granted hereunder shall be exercisable at such times and under such conditions as determined by the Board at the time of grant, and as shall be permissible under the terms of the Plan. An Option may not be exercised for a fraction of a Share. An Option shall be deemed to be exercised when written notice of such excercise has been given to the Company in accordance with the terms of the Option by the person entitled to exercise the Option and full payment for the Shares with respect to which the Option is exercised has been received by the Company. Full payment may, as authorized by the Board, consist of any consideration and method of payment allowable under Section 8(c) of the Plan. Until the issuance (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company) of the stock certificate evidencing such Shares, no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a stockholder shall exist with 3.\n\nrespect to the Optioned Stock, notwithstanding the exercise of the Option. The Company shall issue (or cause to be issued) such stock certificate promptly upon exercise of the Option. No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which the record date is prior to the date the stock certificate is issued, except as provided in Section 11 of the Plan. The exercise of an Option in any manner shall result in a decrease in the number of Shares which thereafter may be available, both for purposes of the Plan and for sale under the Option, by the number of Shares as to which the Option is exercised. (b) Termination of Consulting Relationship with Optionee. In the event of termination of an Optionee's Continuous Status as a Consultant or Advisor, such Optionee may exercise stock options to the extent exercisable on the date of termination. Such exercise must occur within three (3) months (or such shorter time as may be specified in the grant), after the date of such termination (but in no event later than the date of expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Option Agreement). To the extent that the Optionee was not entitled to exercise the Option at the date of such termination, or does not exercise such Option within the time specified herein, the Option shall terminate. (c) Termination of Consulting Relationship Due to Disability of Optionee. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 9(b) above, in the event of termination of an Optionee's Continuous Status as a Consultant or Advisor as a result of total and permanent disability (i.e., the inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of twelve (12) months), such Optionee may exercise stock options to the extent exercisable on the date of termination. Such exercise must occur within eighteen (18) months (or such shorter time as may be specified in the grant), after the date of such termination (but in no event later than the date of expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Option Agreement). To the extent that the Optionee was not entitled to exercise such Option within the time specified herein, the Option shall terminate. (d) Death of Optionee. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 9 (b) above, In the event of the death of an Optionee: (i) who is at the time of death a consultant or advisor to the Company, the Option may be exercised, at any time within six (6) months following the date of death (but in no event later than the date of expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Option Agreement), by the Optionee's Personal Representative or by a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option by bequest or inheritance, but only to the extent of the right to exercise that had accrued as of the date of death; or (ii) whose Option has not yet expired, but whose Continuous Status as a Consultant or Advisor terminated prior to the date of death, the Option may be exercised, at any time within six (6) months following the date of death (but in no event later than the date of expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Option Agreement), by the Optionee's Personal Representative or by a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option by bequest or inheritance, but only to the extent of the right to exercise that had accrued at the date of termination. (e) Notwithstanding subsections (b), (c), and (d) above, the Board shall have the authority to extend the expiration date of any outstanding option in circumstances in which it 4.\n\ndeems such action to be appropriate (provided that no such extension shall extend the term of an option beyond the date on which the option would have expired if no termination of the Optionee's Continuous Status as a Consultant or Advisor had occurred). 10. Non-Transferability of Options. The Option may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution and may be exercised, during the lifetime of the Optionee, only by the Optionee. 11. Adjustments Upon Changes in Capitalization or Merger. Subject to any required action by the stockholders of the Company, the number of shares of Common Stock covered by each outstanding Option, and the number of shares of Common Stock which have been authorized for issuance under the Plan but as to which no Options have yet been granted or which have been returned to the Plan upon cancellation or expiration of an Option, as well as the price per share of Common Stock covered by each such outstanding Option, shall be proportionately adjusted for any increase or decrease in the number of issued shares of Common Stock resulting from stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, combination, or reclassification of the Common Stock, or any other increase or decrease in the number of issued shares of Common Stock effected without receipt of consideration by the Company; provided, however, that conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not be deemed to have been \"effected without receipt of consideration.\" Such adjustment shall be made by the Board, whose determination in that respect shall be final, binding, and conclusive. Except as expressly provided herein, no issuance by the Company of shares of stock of any class, or securities convertible into shares of stock of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment by reasons thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or price of shares of Common Stock subject to an Option. In the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company, the Option will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed action, unless otherwise provided by the Board. The Board may, in the exercise of its sole discretion in such instances, declare that any Option shall terminate as of a date fixed by the Board and give each Optionee the right to exercise an Option as to all or any part of the Optioned Stock, including Shares as to which the Option would not otherwise be exercisable. In the event of a proposed sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, or the merger of the Company with or into another corporation, the Option shall be assumed or an equivalent option shall be substituted by such successor corporation or a parent or subsidiary of such successor corporation, unless such successor corporation does not agree to assume the Option or to substitute an equivalent option, in which case the Board shall, in lieu of such assumption or substitution, provide for the Optionee to have the right to exercise the Option as to all of the Optioned Stock, including Shares as to which the Option would not otherwise be exercisable. If the Board makes an Option fully exercisable in lieu of assumption or substitution in the event of a merger or sale of assets, the Board shall notify the Optionee that the Option shall be fully exercisable for a period of fifteen (15) days from the date of such notice, and the Option will terminate upon the expiration of such period. 12. Time of Granting Options. The date of grant of an Option shall, for all purposes, be the date on which the Board makes the determination granting such Option. Notice of the determination shall be given to each consultant or advisor to whom an Option is so granted within a reasonable time after the date of such grant. 5.\n\n13. Substitutions and Assumptions. The Board shall have the right to substitute or assume Options in connection with mergers, reorganizations, separations, or other transactions to which Section 424(a) of the Code applies, provided such substitutions and assumptions are permitted by Section 424 of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder. The number of Shares reserved pursuant to Section 3 may be increased by the corresponding number of Options assumed and, in the case of a substitution, by the net increase in the number of Shares subject to Options before and after the substitution. 14. Amendment and Termination of the Plan. (a) Amendment and Termination. The Board may amend or terminate the Plan from time to time in such respects as the Board may deem advisable. (b) Effect of Amendment or Termination. Any such amendment or termination of the Plan shall not affect Options already granted and such Options shall remain in full force and effect as if this Plan had not been amended or terminated, unless mutually agreed otherwise between the Optionee and the Board, which agreement must be in writing and signed by the Optionee and the Company. 15. Conditions Upon Issuance of Shares. Shares shall not be issued pursuant to the exercise of an Option unless the exercise of such Option and the issuance and delivery of such shares pursuant to thereto shall comply with all relevant provisions of law, including, without limitation, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and the requirements of any stock exchange upon which the Shares may then be listed, and shall be further subject of the approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such compliance. 16. Reservation of Shares. The Company, during the term of this Plan, will at all times reserve and keep available such number of Shares as shall be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Plan. [The number of shares in Section 3 has been adjusted for stock splits in 1992, 1994, 1996, 1998, and 1999.] 6.\n\nExhibit 10.8 TRUST AGREEMENT This TRUST AGREEMENT is made on June 1, 1993, between MICROSOFT CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (\"Grantor\"), and FIRST INTERSTATE BANK OF WASHINGTON, N.A. (\"Trustee\"), whose address is P.O. Box 21927, Seattle, Washington 98111, and William G. Reed, Jr. (the initial \"Beneficiaries' Representative\"). WHEREAS Grantor has agreed to indemnify \"Beneficiaries\" as defined in Section 1.1, including but not limited to the Directors and certain executive officers listed in Exhibit A, in accordance with its statutory and contractual obligations, including, but not limited to, those assumed in indemnification agreements in the form attached as Exhibit B to this Agreement or such other forms of indemnification agreement as may be entered into between Grantor and Beneficiaries; and WHEREAS Grantor desires to create a trust (the \"Trust\") to fund its obligations for indemnification of the foregoing directors and officers. NOW, THEREFORE, the Trustee accepts the trust created hereby and agrees that it will hold all property which it may receive hereunder, IN TRUST, for the purposes and upon the terms and conditions hereinafter stated and Grantor and Trustee agree as follows:\n\nARTICLE I THE BENEFICIARIES AND THE BENEFICIARIES' REPRESENTATIVE 1.1 The Beneficiaries. All present and future members of the Board of Directors or executive officers of Grantor who are specifically given the benefits of this Trust Agreement pursuant to an indemnification agreement substantially similar to the form attached as Exhibit B shall be \"Beneficiaries\" of the Trust, provided, however, that if there is a \"Change in Control\" of Grantor no officers or directors elected or appointed after or in connection with such Change in Control shall be entitled to be Beneficiaries who were not Beneficiaries prior to such Change in Control. For purposes of this Agreement, the term \"Change of Control\" shall mean (a) a tender offer or exchange offer where the purpose of such offer is to take over and control the Company and such offer is accepted by owners of securities of the Company representing 50% or more of the combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding voting securities, (b) the Company is merged or consolidated with another corporation and as a result of such merger or consolidation less than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of the surviving or resulting corporation shall then be owned in the aggregate by the former stockholders of the Company, (c) the Company transfers substantially all of its assets to another corporation which is not a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, or (d) during any period of twelve consecutive months, individuals who at the beginning of such twelve month period were directors of the Company cease for any reason to 2\n\nconstitute at least a majority of the Board of Directors of the Company. The Beneficiaries' Representative shall promptly notify the Trustee of a Change in Control. A list of the Beneficiaries as of the date of this Agreement is annexed hereto as Exhibit A. Any individual who is or becomes a Beneficiary shall remain so despite his resignation, removal, or other failure to continue to be an officer or member of the Board of Directors during the term of this Agreement. 1.2 New Beneficiaries. If an individual not listed in Exhibit A is duly elected to the Board of Directors of Grantor or appointed as an executive officer, Grantor agrees to notify the Trustee promptly of such election or appointment by delivering to the Trustee an updated Exhibit A which has been certified by the Secretary of Grantor to be accurate and to have been prepared in good faith. The Trustee shall have the right to rely on the accuracy and completeness of the most recent Exhibit A so provided. 1.3 Beneficiaries' Representative. All communications or demands made by and among the Trustee and the Beneficiaries are to be made through the individual then designated as the Beneficiaries' Representative. The Beneficiaries' Representative shall have the exclusive right to make demands from time to time on the Trustee to direct payment to one or more of the Beneficiaries. 1.4 Identity of Beneficiaries' Representative. The Beneficiaries' Representative shall be a present or past non-employee director of Grantor, designated in writing to the Trustee 3\n\nand Grantor by a majority of the then living past and present nonemployee directors who are Beneficiaries under this Agreement. The Trustee and Grantor shall be entitled to rely on the original appointment of that individual as the Beneficiaries' Representative unless notified in writing of a change in the Beneficiaries' Representative, which writing must be signed by at least a majority of the then living past and present nonemployee directors who are Beneficiaries under this Agreement. The Trustee shall then be entitled to rely on such subsequent appointment as of the date such writing is received by the Trustee. The Trustee shall be entitled to rely on the accuracy and completeness of a written list delivered to the Trustee by Grantor, and certified by the Secretary of Grantor to be accurate and to have been prepared in good faith, identifying the individuals who constitute the then living past and present nonemployee directors who are Beneficiaries under this Agreement. In the absence of an effective appointment of a Beneficiaries' Representative, the Trustee or any Beneficiary may, after ten days' written notice to all Beneficiaries, petition a court of competent jurisdiction at the expense of the Trust for appointment of a Beneficiaries' Representative who need not be a Beneficiary (if none are willing or able to serve), but shall in no event be an officer or director elected or appointed after a Change in Control who was not a Beneficiary prior to such Change in Control. The designation or appointment of a successor Beneficiaries' Representative shall become effective only upon the execution of a counterpart of this Trust Agreement whereby such successor Beneficiaries' 4\n\nRepresentative shall assume and become bound by all the duties and responsibilities under this Trust Agreement and each indemnification agreement covered by this Trust Agreement. 1.5 Right of Beneficiaries to Receive Payments. The rights of the Beneficiaries to demand and receive distributions from the Trustee shall not be affected or diminished in any way by the existence of any dispute between Beneficiaries and Grantor, and the Trustee shall be entitled to rely upon the simple demand of the Beneficiaries' Representative pursuant to Section 2.7 in making distributions from the Trust Fund. Such distributions shall be made notwithstanding any notice or demand by or on behalf of Grantor that the distributions should not be made, whether based on Grantor's claim that any Beneficiary is not entitled to some or all of the amount of such distributions or otherwise. The Trustee shall have no responsibility or liability to Grantor for making any payment despite having received any such notice or demand by or on behalf of Grantor. The Trustee shall have no responsibility to inquire into the accuracy or truthfulness of any such notice or demand, whether from the Grantor or the Beneficiaries' Representative. ARTICLE II THE TRUST FUND 2.1 Trust Fund. The Trustee shall hold all property received by it hereunder as one fund which, together with the income and gains therefrom and additions thereto, shall constitute the Trust Fund. 5\n\n2.2 Minimum Balance. Grantor hereby delivers to the Trustee the sum of $7,000,000 in cash (the \"Minimum Balance\"), the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged by the Trustee, to be held IN TRUST in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Nothing contained herein shall preclude Grantor from making additional deliveries of funds from time to time to the Trustee, whether required under the terms of this Agreement or not, to be held IN TRUST as part of the Trust Fund. 2.3 Maintenance of Minimum Balance. The Trustee agrees to provide monthly reports to Grantor and the Beneficiaries' Representative showing the current fair market value of the Trust Fund. If any such report shows that the current fair market Value of the Trust Fund is less than the Minimum Balance, then within ten days after such report, Grantor agrees to deliver cash funds to the Trustee equal to the difference between the fair market value of the Trust Fund and the Minimum Balance so that the thrust fund balance is at least equal to the Minimum Balance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Grantor shall have no obligation to make payments to the Trustee in excess of $100,000,000 over the term of this Trust Agreement. 2.4 Additional Contributions. Subject to the aggregate limitations of $100,000,000 for all Beneficiaries as set forth in Section 2.3, Grantor further agrees to make additional contributions to the Trust Funds within ten (10) days after receipt of a written request from the Beneficiaries' Representative certifying in good faith that Claims have or are reasonably expected to be asserted against Beneficiaries and that 6\n\nestimated Losses and Expenses for all pending, threatened or anticipated Claims against all the Beneficiaries are reasonably expected to exceed the then Trust Fund balance. A copy of such written certification shall be provided to the Trustee at the same time and in the same manner as it is provided to Grantor. Such written certification shall be accompanied by an opinion of independent counsel to the effect that based on the information made known to such counsel that the Claims are not Excluded Claims and that the amount requested is reasonable. Independent counsel shall be selected by the Beneficiaries' Representative and shall have no present or past professional relationship to the Beneficiaries who are the subject of the Claims. The terms \"Claims,\" \"Losses,\" \"Expenses\" and \"Excluded Claims\" shall have the same meaning as defined in the Indemnification Agreement attached as Exhibit B. 2.5 Excess Balance. If the fair market value of the Trust Fund shall exceed the Minimum Balance, plus any additional contributions which continue to be required pursuant to Section 2.4, Grantor shall be entitled to withdraw an amount equal to the excess over the Minimum Balance with the written consent of the Beneficiaries' Representative. 2.6 Direction of Investment. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, Grantor retains the right to direct the investment of the Trust Fund and the Trustee shall have no duty to review or recommend investments. In the event the Trustee is required to make a distribution pursuant to Section 2.7 hereof at a time when the Trust Fund has insufficient cash to 7\n\ncover such distribution, the Trustee shall seek the advice of the Grantor with regard to which Trust investments to liquidate in order to cover the required distribution; if the Grantor does not respond to the Trustee's inquiry within forty-eight (48) hours the Trustee shall use its discretion in choosing which investments to liquidate. 2.7 Distributions From Trust Fund. The Trustee shall make distributions to a Beneficiary from the Trust Fund only upon demand of the Beneficiaries' Representative. Each such demand shall be submitted to the Trustee, in writing, signed by the Beneficiaries' Representative, and shall state (i) that such demand is being made pursuant to an indemnification agreement between Grantor and the Beneficiary, (ii) that the demand is for satisfaction of indemnification obligations and the amount being demanded by a Beneficiary, (iii) that, pursuant to the Indemnification agreement, the Beneficiary has certified that he or she is entitled to payment of at least the amount demanded, (iv) that the Beneficiary has previously made demand for payment upon Grantor, and (v) that no part of the amount then being demanded from the Trust Fund has been previously received from the Grantor. A copy of each demand shall be delivered to Grantor by the Trustee. As soon as practicable after such demand is made by the Beneficiaries' Representative, subject to the provisions of Section 1.5, the Trustee shall distribute funds to the Beneficiary specified in such demand in the amount and manner set forth therein. If the Trustee does not have sufficient funds to satisfy all pending demands of Beneficiaries in full, the Trustee shall 8\n\nmake all reasonable efforts to make pro rata payments, less any amounts due the Trustee, to the Beneficiaries as specified by the Beneficiaries' Representative. Upon the replenishment of the Trust Fund, in accordance with Section 2.3, the Trustee shall continue to make pro rata distributions, less any amounts due the Trustee, until such demand is satisfied or to satisfy subsequent demands. 2.8 Taxes. The Grantor agrees to pay any and all taxes on the Trust Fund or the income thereof or which the Beneficiaries or the Trustee would otherwise be required to pay with respect to the interest of any person or persons therein, and to provide the Trustee with proof of payment. 2.9 Duties and Responsibilities of Beneficiaries' Representative. The Beneficiaries' Representative (and any successor Beneficiaries Representative) shall have the following affirmative duties and responsibilities: 2.9.l to demand deposits from the Grantor so as to maintain the Minimum Balance of the Trust in accordance with Section 2.3 and any Additional Contributions required by section 2.4 and any indemnification agreement with any Beneficiary; 2.9.2 to demand payment by the Trustee to a Beneficiary who has made a demand and who, in the good faith judgment of the Beneficiaries' Representative, has satisfied the conditions for indemnification as set forth in this Agreement and the indemnification agreement between the Beneficiary and the Grantor; 9\n\n2.9.3 to generally cause the Grantor and Trustee to discharge their respective responsibilities under this Agreement and the responsibilities of the Grantor under each indemnification agreement, including the bringing of legal actions and proceedings to enforce such agreement. 2.10 Investment Powers of the Trustee. In addition to any powers which the Trustee may have under Washington law, the Trustee shall have, with respect to any property at any time held by him and constituting part of the Trust Fund, the power (subject to Grantor's right pursuant to Section 2.6 to direct the investment of the Trust Fund) to do any of the following: 2.10.1 To retain any property at any time received by the Trustee; 2.10.2 To sell or exchange any property at public or private sale for cash or on credit and to grant options for the purchase or exchange thereof; 2.10.3 To participate in any plan of reorganization, consolidation, merger, combination, liquidation, or other similar plan relating to any property held in the Trust Fund, and to consent to or oppose any such plan or any action thereunder, or any contract, lease, mortgage, purchase, sale, or other action by any person or corporation; 2.10.4 To exercise conversion and subscription rights pertaining to any property held in the Trust Fund; 2.10.5 To extend the time of payment of any obligation held in the Trust Fund; 10\n\n2.10.6 To enter into stand-by agreements for future Investment, either with or without a standby fee; 2.10.7 To lend securities held in any Investment Fund to broker-dealers with whom the Trustee may from time to time conclude securities lending agreements on behalf of the Trust Fund, and to receive collateral for such securities; provided, however, the Trustee shall not lend securities if such lending activity would violate any State or Federal law; 2.10.8 To exercise all voting rights with respect to any investment and to grant proxies, discretionary or otherwise; 2.10.9 To settle, compromise, or submit to arbitration any claims, debts, or damages due or owing to or from the Trust; to commence or defend suits or legal proceedings to protect any interest of the Trust; and to represent or cause to be represented the Trust in all suits or legal proceedings in any court or before any other body or tribunal; and 2.10.10 For the purpose of the Trust, to borrow money from others, to issue its promissory note or notes therefor, and to secure the repayment thereof by pledging any property in Trustee's possession; provided, however, that no such loan or advance shall be made by the Trustee hereunder other than temporary advances to the Trust Fund, on a cash or overdraft basis, on which no interest is payable. 2.11 Administrative Powers of Trustee. The Trustee shall have power, in its sole discretion, to do any of the following: 2.11.1 To cause any investment to be registered and held in the name of one or more of its nominees, or one or more 11\n\nnominees of any system for the central handling of securities, without increase or decrease of liability; 2.11.2 To collect and receive any and all money and other property due to the Trust Fund and to give full discharge therefor; 2.11.3 To organize under the laws of any state a corporation for the purpose of acquiring and holding title to any property which Trustee is authorized to acquire under this Agreement and to exercise with respect thereto any or all of the powers set forth in this Agreement; and 2.11.4 To hold uninvested, without liability for interest thereon, such monies received by the Trustee as the Trustee considers necessary to meet anticipated and imminent disbursements.

The Trustee shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted by him in good faith and believed by him to be authorized hereby or within the rights or powers conferred upon him hereunder, or taken or omitted by him in accordance with advice of counsel (which counsel may be of the Trustee's own choosing and which may be house counsel of the Trustee), and shall not be liable for any mistake of fact or error of judgment or for any acts or omissions of any kind unless caused by willful misconduct or gross negligence.

If Grantor finds the account to be correct, Grantor shall sign the instrument of settlement annexed to one counterpart of the account and return such counterpart to the Trustee, whereupon the account shall become an account stated as between the Trustee and Grantor. If within ninety days after receipt of the account or any amended account Grantor has not signed and returned a counterpart to the Trustee, nor filed with the Trustee notice of any objection to any act or transaction of the Trustee, the account or amended account shall become an account stated as between the Trustee and Grantor. If any objection has been filed, and if Grantor is satisfied that it should be withdrawn or if the account is adjusted to its satisfaction, Grantor shall deliver to the Trustee its written 17\n\napproval of the account and it shall become an account stated as between the Trustee and the Grantor. When an account becomes an account stated, such account shall be finally settled, and the Trustee shall be completely discharged and released, as if such account had been settled and allowed by a judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction in any action or proceeding in which the Trustee and Grantor were parties. The Trustee, the Beneficiaries' Representative, or Grantor shall have the right to apply at any time to a court of competent jurisdiction for judicial settlement of any account of the Trustee not previously settled as hereinabove provided. In any such action or proceeding it shall be necessary to join as parties only the Trustee, the Beneficiaries' Representative, and Grantor (although the Trustee may also join such other parties as he may deem appropriate), and any judgment or decree entered therein shall be conclusive.

The validity, interpretation, performance, and enforcement of this Agreement and the Trust created hereby shall be governed by the laws of the state of Washington. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the rights of the Beneficiaries to receive indemnification from Grantor are governed by the laws of the state of incorporation of Grantor. The parties irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction and venue of any Washington 18\n\nState or United States Federal Court sitting in Seattle, Washington. 4.2 Successors.

(\"Trustee\") /s/ Joan Robinson By: /s/ Pamela A. Jorgenson - -------------------------------------- ----------------------------- Attest: Assistant Corporate Secretary MICROSOFT CORPORATION (\"Grantor\") By: /s/ William H. Neukom By: /s/ William H. Gates ----------------------------- ----------------------------- (\"Beneficiaries' Representative\") /s/ William G. Reed, Jr. --------------------------------- WILLIAM G. REED, JR. 20\n\nExhibit 10.9 INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT This Agreement is made this 1st day of June, 1993, by and between Microsoft Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the \"Company\") and ______________ (\"Indemnitee\"), a director and/or executive officer of the Company and William G. Reed, Jr. (the initial \"Beneficiaries' Representative\"). WHEREAS, there is a general awareness that competent and experienced persons are becoming more reluctant to serve as directors or executive officers of publicly-held corporations unless they are protected by comprehensive policies of insurance or indemnification, due to the increasing number of lawsuits against such corporations and their directors and officers, the attendant expense of defending against such lawsuits, and the exposure of such directors and officers to unreasonably high damages; WHEREAS, present laws and interpretations are frequently too uncertain to provide such officers and directors with adequate, reliable knowledge of the legal risks to which they may be exposed as a result of serving the corporation; WHEREAS, the Board of Directors has concluded that its directors and executive officers should be provided with protection against such risks in order to insure that the most capable persons will be attracted to such positions; and, therefore, has determined to contractually obligate itself to indemnify in a reasonable manner its directors and executive\n\nofficers and to assume for itself the liability for expenses and damages in connection with claims lodged against its directors and executive officers as a result of their service to the Company. WHEREAS, applicable law empowers corporations to indemnify persons serving as a director, officer, employee, or agent of the corporation or a person who serves at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise, and further empowers a corporation to purchase and maintain insurance (on behalf of such persons) against liability which may be asserted against Indemnitee or incurred by Indemnitee in any such capacity, or arising out of Indemnitee's status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify against such liability under the provisions of said laws; WHEREAS, the Board of Directors has concluded that, due to the high cost and other negative features of the coverage under presently available directors and officers liability insurance, at this time it would not be in the best interest of its shareholders for the Company to purchase and maintain such insurance in the amounts customarily held by similar corporations and that its shareholders' interest would be better served by contracting to indemnify its executive officers and directors thereby reasonably self-insuring against such potential liabilities; -2-\n\nWHEREAS, the Company desires to have Indemnitee serve or continue to serve as a director or executive officer of the Company free from undue concern for damages by reason of Indemnitee being a director and/or executive officer of the Company or by reason of his or her decision or actions on its behalf, and Indemnitee is willing to serve, or to continue to serve, only if he or she is furnished the indemnity provided for hereinafter in one or more of such capacities; and WHEREAS, the parties believe it appropriate to memorialize and reaffirm the Company's indemnification obligations to Indemnitee and, in addition, to set forth the agreements contained herein. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises, conditions, representations, and warranties set forth herein, including the Indemnitee's continued service to the Company, the Company and Indemnitee hereby agree as follows: 1.

The Company shall have no obligation to indemnify Indemnitee for and hold him or her harmless from any Loss or Expense which has been Ultimately Determined to constitute an Excluded Claim or to the extent that Indemnitee has received the proceeds of D&O Insurance or to the extent that Indemnitee has otherwise been indemnified. -6-\n\n4. Indemnification Procedures. 4.1 Notice. Promptly after receipt by Indemnitee of notice of the commencement of or the threat of commencement of any Claim, Indemnitee shall, if Indemnitee intends to seek indemnification with respect thereto from the Company under this Agreement, promptly notify the Company and the Beneficiaries, Representative of the commencement thereof and shall keep the Company generally informed of, and consult with the Company with respect to, the status of any such Claim. 4.2 D&O Insurance Applicable. If, at the time of the receipt of such notice, the Company has D&O Insurance in effect, the Company shall give prompt notice of the commencement of such Claim to the insurers in accordance with the procedures set forth in the respective policies in favor of Indemnitee. The Company shall thereafter take all necessary or desirable action to cause such insurers to pay, on behalf of Indemnitee, all Losses and Expenses payable as a result of such Claim in accordance with the terms of such policies. 4.3 Advances of Expenses. The Company agrees to pay the Expenses of any such Claim in advance of the final disposition thereof to the extent payment for such Expenses is not promptly received from D&O Insurance or any other source of indemnity. The Company, if appropriate, shall be entitled to assume the defense of any Claim, with counsel satisfactory to Indemnitee, upon the delivery to Indemnitee of written notice of its election to assume the defense. After delivery of such notice and so long -7-\n\nas the Company continues such defense, the Company will not be liable to Indemnitee under this Aqreement for any legal or other Expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with such defense other than Expenses of investigation and any out-of-pocket personal expenses incurred in preparing for and participating in the Claim. Indemnitee shall have the right to employ his or her counsel in any such Claim but the fees and expenses of such counsel incurred after delivery of notice from the Company of its assumption of such defense shall be at the Indemnitee's expense provided that if (i) the employment of counsel by Indemnitee has been previously authorized by the Company, (ii) Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict of interest between the Company and Indemnitee in the conduct of any such defense or (iii) the Company shall not, in fact, have employed counsel which has assumed and continues the defense of such action, the fees and expenses of counsel shall be at the expense of the Company. 4.4 Payment of Expenses. All payments on account of the Company's indemnification obligations under this Agreement shall be made within sixty (60) days of Indemnitee's written request therefor unless an Ultimate Determination is made that the claims giving rise to Indemnitee's request are Excluded Claims or otherwise not payable under this Agreement, provided that all payments on account of the Company's obligations under Section 4.3 of this Agreement prior to the final disposition of any Claim shall be made within 20 days of Indemnitee's written -8-\n\nrequest therefor and such obligation shall not be subject to any such Ultimate Determination but shall be subject to this Agreement. 4.5 Indemnitee's Obligation to Reimburse. Indemnitee agrees that he will reimburse the Company for all Losses and Expenses paid by the Company, or any Trustee of a Trust created by the Company, in connection with any Claim against Indemnitee in the event and only to the extent that an Ultimate Determination shall have been made that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company for such Expenses because the claim is an Excluded Claim or because Indemnitee is otherwise not entitled to payment under this Agreement. 5. Settlement. The Company shall have no obligation to indemnify Indemnitee under this Agreement for any amounts paid in settlement of any Claim effected without the Company's prior written consent except to the extent it is Ultimately Determined that such settlement is reasonable and in good faith. The Company shall not settle any Claim in any manner which would impose any Fine or any obligation on Indemnitee without Indemnitee's written consent. Neither the Company nor Indemnitee shall unreasonably withhold their consent to any proposed settlement. 6. Partial Indemnification. If Indemnitee is entitled under any provisions of this Agreement to indemnification by the Company for some or a portion of Expenses and Losses but not, however, for the total amount thereof, the Company shall -9-\n\nnevertheless indemnify Indemnitee for the portion of such Expenses and Losses to which Indemnitee is entitled. 7. Enforcement. 7.1 Burden of Proof. Indemnitee's right to indemnification shall be enforceable by Indemnitee in any court of competent jurisdiction and shall be enforceable notwithstanding any adverse Determination (pursuant to clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) but not (iv) of the definition of Determination in Section 1). In any action in which Indemnitee seeks indemnification, the Company shall have the burden of proving that indemnification is not required under this Agreement. The termination of any Claim by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not of itself create a presumption that Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful. 7.2 Enforcement Expenses. In the event that any action is instituted in which Indemnitee or the Beneficiaries' Representative seeks indemnification of Indemnitee under this Agreement, or to enforce or interpret any of the terms of this Agreement, Indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, incurred by Indemnitee with respect to such action, unless the -10-\n\ncourt determines that such action was not brought in good faith or was frivolous. 8. Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is determined by a court to require the Company to do or to fail to do an act which is in violation of applicable law, such provision shall be limited or modified in its application to the minimum extent necessary to avoid a violation of law, and, as so limited or modified, such provision and the balance of this Agreement shall be enforceable in accordance with their terms. 9. Choice of Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware. 10. Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be (i) binding upon all successors and assigns of the Company (including any transferee of all or substantially all of its assets and any successor by merger or otherwise by operation of law) and of the Beneficiaries' Representative and (ii) shall be binding on and inure to the benefit of the spouses, heirs, personal representatives, and estate of Indemnitee. The Company shall not effect any sale of substantially all of its assets, merger consolidation, or other reorganization unless the surviving entity agrees in writing to assume all the obligations of the company under this Agreement and to indemnify Indemnitee and advance Expenses in accordance with this Agreement. 11. Amendment. No amendment, modification, termination, or cancellation of this Agreement shall be effective unless made in -11-\n\na writing signed by each of the parties hereto. No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of any other provision of this Agreement (whether or not similar) nor shall such waiver constitute a continuing waiver. 12. Deposit in Trust. The Company has created a Trust (the \"Trust\") for the benefit of the Indemnitee and others (Collectively, including Indemnitee, the \"Beneficiaries\") in the form of Exhibit A (the 'Trust Agreement\"). Indemnitee is specifically acknowledqed as a third party beneficiary of the Trust Agreement, and therefore, in addition to Indemnitee's rights under this Agreement and any applicable insurance policy, Indemnitee shall also have the right to receive indemnification from the Trust in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and of the Trust Agreement. The Company agrees to fund and maintain the Trust Fund in accordance with the procedures set forth in Article II of the Trust Agreement and to discharge all its other ,obligations pursuant to the Trust Agreement. 13. Procedure for Making Demand. Indemnitee shall first make demand upon the Company in accordance with the Indemnification Procedures of Section 4 to honor its indemnity obligation under this Agreement. If the Company shall fail to indemnify on a timely basis, the Beneficiary shall deliver a certificate to the Beneficiaries' Representative settinq forth the information required pursuant to Section 2.7 of the Trust Agreement. Indemnitee shall not be required to institute a -12-\n\nlawsuit or take other actions against the Company or any insurer to recover the unpaid amount prior to the Beneficiaries' Representative making a demand and receiving payment from the Trustee on his or her behalf. 14. Duties and Responsibilities of Beneficiaries' Representative. The Beneficiaries' Representative (and any successor Beneficiaries' Representative) shall have the following affirmative duties and responsibilities: 14.1 to demand deposits from the Company so as to maintain the Minimum Balance and make any Additional Contribution as required by Sections 2.3 and 2.4 of the Trust Agreement; 14.2 to demand payments by the Trustee to Indemnitee upon demand by Indemnitee where, in the good faith judgment of the Beneficiaries' Representative, the Indemnitee has satisfied the conditions for indemnification as set forth in this Agreement and the Trust Agreement. 14.3 to generally cause the Company and Trustee to discharge their respective responsibilities under this Agreement and the Trust Agreement, including the bringing of legal actions and proceedings to enforce such Agreement. 15. Other Indemnity. The provisions in this Agreement are intended to be nonexclusive of indemnity granted pursuant to the Company's Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, other agreements, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise. All applicable indemnity shall be interpreted and applied so as -13-\n\nto provide Indemnitee with the broadest but nonduplicative indemnity to which he or she is entitled. 16. Notices, Consents, and Other Communications. All notices, consents, or other communications required or contemplated by this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been given when delivered either by (a) personal delivery, (b) overnight courier, or (c) postage prepaid return receipt requested certified mail to the last address given to the Trustee by each respective Beneficiary.
