Microsoft appears to be dominant in this area. Microsoft possesses monopoly power in the market for operating systems 4) Threat of new entrants (Low): • A new competitor would face a number of entry barriers before entering this market.

More than 500 million devices all around the globe use the Windows Operating system. • Large product/services portfolio: operating systems; productivity applications; server applications; business solution applications; desktop and server management tools; software development tools; video games; and training and certification of computer system integrators and developers.PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, cloud computing services.\n\n13. Strength: Growing cloud business: The cloud industry has achieved faster growth in the recent years fueled by a huge investment in innovation. Focus on innovation: Microsoft is working to stay ahead of its competitors in several areas including AI and Mixed reality. It is investing heavy sums in Research and development in these areas. Brand image/ Customer Loyalty: Microsoft software can help its users achieve very high degree of efficiency and productivity which has led to a high level of trust among Microsoft users whether individuals or businesses.\n\n14. Weaknesses: Declining PC market: The PC market has been through severe decline in the recent years fuelled largely by the rising sales of smartphones and tablets. Since Microsoft is a major provider of software and devices, it also found its sales being affected by the reducing sales of computers. Slower in terms of innovation: when you compare MS with its nearest competitors like Amazon and Apple, you will find its speed of innovation slower. Its search engine and browsers are also not as powerful as the ones created by Google. Smaller advertising market share: Advertising revenue of Microsoft has grown in the recent years, but yet its share is much smaller compared to the other major players in the online advertising industry like Google and Facebook. Lacking market leadership in Internet browser segment : Microsoft Edge had very weak position with only 2% of users. When we look at comparison worldwide, Google Chrome is leader again in web browsers\n\n15. Weakness: Cybercrime theft: The increasing cybercrime cases have left Microsoft in a vulnerable state. Hackers have reportedly attacked the cyber security of the Windows Operating System several times. Unsuccessful acquisitions: Microsoft’s fewer acquisitions like WebTV, LinkExchange, Nokia, and Skype resulted in failures and divestitures. Such unprofitable investments are the biggest weaknesses of Microsoft\n\n16. Opportunities Innovation and Artificial Intelligence : Microsoft has a massive opportunity in many innovative areas like AI and game technology. Investing in these areas can give an upper hand to Microsoft. Partnerships and Acquisitions : Microsoft can focus on entering into new strategic alliances and partnerships. It will enable the company to gain high market share. Acquiring major hi-tech firms will also be a profitable opportunity for Microsoft. Smartphone industry :The fast-growing market of smartphones and tablets offer an excellent opportunity for Microsoft. It can capitalize on the rising demands of these products. Reducing Cost: Microsoft can gain the opportunity of increasing its sales and revenue by offering its products at low prices. It may also prevent the hackers to use its software illegally.\n\n17. Threat Aggressive competition :Microsoft is in intense competition with Google and Apple. These companies’ established positions can be a threat to Microsoft’s market position. Changing preferences of consumers : People are highly attracted to the market of smartphones, notepads, and laptops. Microsoft has modest shares in these markets. Open source projects : Like Linux OS and Open Source Office, many new open source projects have successfully entered into the market offering similar services for free. It can threaten Microsoft that offers these products at an expensive rate. Cybercrime and piracy : Rising cybercrime thefts and software piracy issues have dramatically affected Microsoft’s security network system\n\n18. Recommended Strategies Growth through Product development: The most suitable strategic option for Microsoft Corporation is to make smart phones and hardware devices for the customers as because this is the ever challenging as well as demanding market. Growth through mergers and acquisitions: Acquisition plays an instrumental role to connect the world’s professional cloud and the world’s professional network. The list of the most notable recent acquisitions includes Nokia Corporation business and LinkedIn. Growth through Market Penetration: This intensive growth strategy involves selling more products to the markets where the company currently has operations through online marketing and advertising.
