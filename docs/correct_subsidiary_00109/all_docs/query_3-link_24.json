Advert is i ng sales advertidrtg@wired.com General questions infoPwired.com Email server info-rama@wired.com Boom Bloom i hope you're right about the Long Boom (Wired 5.07, page 115). But doesn't it strike you that the assump¬ tion that openness, multicu1turalism,and hybridity are good - an assumption critical to the success of your Long Boom - is itself an ethnocentric product of a Western liberal-democratic worldview? Would such ideas ever arise independently in a Confucian culture or a fundamentalist Islamic society? Not that I think those values are bad - just the opposite, In fact. They're great values. Moreover, they're my values. But I do think that Peter Schwartz and Peter Leyden's boom might be perceived by many people as the triumph of values belonging to a given culture rather than an idyllic conversa¬ tion among civilizations. The challenge Is to give people from Albania to Zimbabwe a stake in the creation of such a civilization, despite the real and irreducible dif¬ ferences in their own beliefs and values, rather than leaving them with the feeling that the Long Boom has been shoved down their collective throat. But, hey, as for me - where do I sign up? Adam Greenfield carbon@holonet.net I read \"The Long Boom\" with great Interest and appre¬ ciate ItsTofflerian worldview. Few utopian perspec¬ tives, however, address the mental strain of accessing, filtering, processing, and retaining the onslaught of knowledge-information overload. As we approach critical mass in our ability to cope with the related info-stress, it is easy to feel that we are each alone and treading water in a tsunami of must-know-to-be-current-and-Mp data. Acknowl¬ edging, reconnecting, and living with the oneness honored in most spiritual paths allows us to flow with the tide - to truly be data surfers. To paraphrase many a sage, the digital era is, to date, largely an exercise In \"doing.\" Our psychologi¬ cal survival in these frenzied advances - and the other issues of the new millennium - rests instead in our way of being with it all In technology^ in all walks of life, this distinction makes the difference between a stressful, obligatory challenge and a joy¬ ous, empowered journey. Jeff Burger jeff@sedona.net I must take serious exception to Peter Schwartz and Peter Leyden's claim that Alan Greenspan's retirement will be a good thing. Greenspan's retirement should be viewed as a serious risk factor, not as an opportu¬ nity for unbridled prosperity. During his tenure as chair of the Federal Reserve, the US economy has experienced a remarkable period of monetary and price stability that has made pos¬ sible the boom of the '90s.This \"Goldilocks economy\" - not too hot, not too cold - is engineered to enable sustained economic growth without the wild ups and downs that characterized the American business cycle in the 70s and '80s (and still persist in econo¬ mies around the world, including many in Asia). The benefits of this stable platform for growth are often underestimated, but to the business planner it is as important as reliable communications, power, and transport. It is particularly important in the US because of the dollar's special status as the de facto global currency. Ordinary citizens benefit most of all: we don't have to worry about losing our savings to inflation. In today's economy, there are jobs available 02 for even the least skilled, with real wages rising again. We can only hope that Greenspan's successor will be as effective as he has been. Andrew Sullivan celebes@ welLcom What a wonderful world it's going to be - provided, of course, that all of it comes true. Although the article touched on important aspects of global transition, it skimmed over agriculture. Urban sectors of society will continually compete for water, since irrigated agriculture consumes 80 percent of water resources in an average agricultural/metro- politan region. An expanding industry is drip irrigation, or micro- irrigation. This process saves water, reduces fer¬ tilizer consumption, and assists farmers during drought periods. Micro- irrigation will become a bigger player in states such as California where urban sprawl will gobble up prime farmland, no matter how rosy the sce¬ nario. It has helped trans¬ form countries like India from food importers just a generation ago to food exporters today. While I was a soil scien¬ tist at the US Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research Service, I initia¬ ted an Internet discussion list focusing on microirriga- tion Today, that list has grown to 600 subscribers in 32 nations. Individuals in developing countries with Internet access are tapping in to this list of experts and industry reps and discovering that online answers are quick and the information is deep, f can only ima¬ gine what things will be like in agricultural technol¬ ogy in 20 years.

James Strocel rogue1@rogers.wave.ca See *Dawn of the Hydrogen Age* in this issue of Wired. Cemex's Success The neat thing about seeing complexity theory in action (\"Bordering on Chaos,\" Wired 5.07, page 98) is that Cemex uses the common law (which permits what it doesn't prohibit) to create great new operat¬ ing procedures in a country that uses the Roman law (which prohibits what it doesn't permit). Of course, applying free-market management in firms typically produces the kind of results that can grow a tiny business to the world's third-largest cement company in a decade. Cemex's top execs and engineers use the conver¬ sation to make commitments.This style is more than just the right way to implement technology; it's the right way to run a business or a society. You create an architecture of human behaviors when employees can make commitments that satisfy their clients. To succeed, companies must empower employees, since each worker knows his own client's needs and wants best That's a big change from Mexican tradition, Cemex operates in a country that empowered the politicians and the bosses, but never the clients and the employees - until Lorenzo Zambrano came along and turned the world upside down. Or. Mark White white@profmexis.sar.net Spam Scam Brock N. Meeks's article on antispam legislation (\"Stomping Out Spam,\" Wired 5.08, page 82) falls to address the most critical issue for many people: cost- shifting. Traditionally, the cost of advertising is paid by the advertiser, and in many media subsidizes the cost to the consumer Advertising, for example, keeps television free and newspapers cheap. This economic model does not apply to spam. Instead, the advertiser pays a fraction of what It would pay for a traditional marketing campaign, and the recipient pays to pick up the pieces. Spam dogs networks, delays mail, takes down servers, and dominates administrator time. All that raises your ISP's operating costs - costs that ultimately trickle down to the consumer in the form of increased fees. This is important, because no scheme that involves recipient-level mail filtering really addresses the cost- shifting issue. Any solution that permits spammers to send out advertisements, requiring them merely to adopt a content-tagging system and honor unsub¬ scribe requests, won't have a significant effect on the amount of spam received by a service provider, and therefore will not reduce the ISP's costs or yours. Neither Senator Robert Torricelli's nor Senator Frank Murkowski's bill will have much effect on the addi¬ tional costs borne by consumers. Tim Pierce twpierce@midway.uchicago.edu Brock N. Meeks selects Senator Torricelli's Electronic Mailbox Protection Act of 1997 as the most \"Internet- friendly\" of the three pieces of upcoming antispam legislation.] disagree.Torricelli's bill prohibits spam¬ mers from using false From addresses, creating new domain names, or moving operations overseas. Speaking in terms of the Constitution, it Is difficult to justify imposing these restrictions on spammers and not on any other Internet user (let alone pre venting private business from moving overseas). Or does Torricelli plan to restrict everyone? It doesn't sound very Internet-friendly to me. Representative Chris Smith's amendment to the Consumer Protection Act of 1991 is much more respectful of cyber rights. It would merely treat junk email as junk faxes are treated. The ban on junk faxes was upheld in court because, although the advertis¬ ing is a form of speech, the recipient must pay for an unwanted message. Email isn't free, either - even if an Internet user doesn't pay for his spam with an hourly rate, his ISP spends money to make the con¬ nections happen. And although the courts have ruled that the internet differs from the phone sys tern,junk email is just as unwanted as junk faxes. Smith's bill will be more effective than Torricelli's, simpler, and - more important - less intrusive, in a domain where intrusion is death. Jonathan R, Schwanbeck ack@tiac.net Librarian Longevity I enjoyed \"Morphing the Librarians\" (Wired 5.08, page 64). As a librarian, I am thrilled at the changes my profession is going through. Indeed, far from swapping public service for money and power or even becoming extinct, many of us in public libraries find ourselves busier than ever. In Augusta, Maine,the staff at Lithgow Public Library serves its clientele with an online public catalog and an interlibrary loan system dependent on email and listservs. We answer many reference questions using the Internet and CD-ROM sources. We train library users to answer their information and entertainment needs using technology. Public libraries are in the unique position of being able to offer high tech services and training to everyone, even those who cannot afford a computer at home or have never touched a computer before. It Is extremely gratifying to see the light and excitement In someone's face when they grasp the wealth of free information at their fingertips. Tech¬ nology is a happy extension of the publ ic service we have been providing ali along. Jodi Johnson lpl@biddeford.com Don't buy the extinction myth. Educated and trained librarians will be needed to help users sift through and locate appropriate information regardless of format. A number of students come to the library to find specific information and haven't the foggiest idea how to do it. This profession has changed rapidly over the last decade.The profession isn't ruled by the Dewey Decimal System (ever hear of the Library of Con¬ gress?), it is ruled by a desire to meet users'needs, whether by modern or traditional methods. We will survive! Tracey Cuellar tcuellar@campus.mainland.cc.tx.us Integration^ Integrity How delightful that the wired world is so fabulous and that Larry Summers is leading the charge to a bold new land of prosperity and retro-smiling faces (\"The Integration^ vs. the Separatists,\" Wired S.07, page 53). Why, with my Pentium Pro 200 MHz surf¬ ing the Club Med homepage while downloading my soon-to-be-decimalized-8 r 000-Dow-make-me- snappy-happy fund closing price, l, too, can close the door on reality and drive into Wired 's perfect future. Needless to say, we must not s!ow down to note that the United Nations Development Program just reported that 19 percent of Americans live in poverty. Nor should we consider that Summers and his ilk don't give a hoot about the distribution of wealth, only the abundance of it for some. The editors of Wired and Summers should take a look at the living conditions of the 1 billion people who have access to just a fraction of the wealth they describe before judging the planet's future so rosy. There is a lot we can do to bridge the gap between rich and poor.Technology can play a vital role in the struggle for justice, while arrogance has no role in our quest for survival.

He complains about limits in purchasing desire. And yet, if everyone were to reach a point where they have everything they want, we would finally have achieved true wealth as a society.

But unlike most people, Kashpu reff decided to do something about it: he rerouted traffic from Network Solutions' and InterNICs sites to his own AlterNIC server on two separate occasions this summer.

Today, most links are ads, paid for by other Web sites that need traffic to sell traffic. That surreal mathematics creates a huge opportunity; a chance to reintroduce purposeful connectedness. Thus, Alexa (www.alexa.com/) - a new navi¬ gation service conceived by Brewster Kahle, inventor of Wais and cofounder of Thinking Machines. Alexa is an application that works in cooperation with your browser. It analyzes every site you visit - who owns It, how many sites link to it, and how popular it is. More important, it suggests where to go next based on which sites are similar and which sites other Alexa users have linked to. Along, of course, with others who've paid Alexa to be mentioned. Some might be impressed by Alexa’s instant-messaging add-on or its archive service, which strives to eliminate 404s forever.

N I The THE E T fl Z IE N eneration^ The Old Guard wants to ban strong cryptography to protect the national security state.The Young Turks want to unleash strong crypto to protect the national economy - and our privacy. A report from the front lines of a struggle for the future. :vj a By Rebecca Veseiy It s a sweltering July afternoon in Washington, DC, as a dozen lawmen dressed in dark blue suits file into a meeting room on Capitol Hill. The broad-shouldered cops stroll confidently through a crowd of lobbyists, journalists, and congressional staffers, push aside the “reserved” cards placed before their front-row seats, and settle into their chairs. The men are supercops - bigwigs from the FBI, the National Security Agency, the Drug Enforcement Agency, and the Commerce Department - and they’ve come to Congress to declare war on strong encryption. On this particular day, the lawmen are on hand at a meeting of the House International Relations Commit¬ tee, which is poised to vote on the Security and Free¬ dom through Encryption Act, better known as SAFE. Sponsored by Representative Bob Goodlatte (R-Virginia), SAFE would prohibit the government from imposing any controls on the use of strong encryption within the US and relax the export regulations that bar Amer- Rebecca Veseiy (rebecca@wired.com) is Washington bureau chief for Wired News. ican firms from selling such software internationally. The bill is a darling among high tech companies and civil libertarians, but to the law enforcement guys, SAFE is a nightmare. As the Feds settle into their seats, lobbyists from Netscape, Microsoft, and Pretty Good Privacy huddle along the side wall, biting their nails and seething about the supercops in hushed, nervous tones. Although SAFE has attracted strong support in the House, the massive show of institutional force by the national security apparatus is a grim indication that the tides have turned in the encryption debate. Only a few months ago, high tech lobbyists were prodding the White House to relax its encryption export controls. Now, they’re fighting to keep the technology legal. Surprisingly, however, the ominous, front-row pres¬ ence of the supercops was not enough to sway the Inter¬ national Relations Committee. Nor was the flurry of anti-SAFE letters sent by Defense Secretary William Cohen and Attorney General Janet Reno. At the end of the day, the committee passed SAFE by a voice vote. Yet much greater challenges lie ahead. The ongoing battles over encryption policy have exposed a glaring rift between two vastly different political camps inside the Beltway - each fighting to uphold a different vision of the future. For the aging Cold Warriors who fantasize that crypto can be closely controlled, the future looks ► B3 WIRED OCTOBER 1997 THE NETIZEN like a reprint of an old James Bond movie, replete with heroic cloak-and-dagger struggles against drug lords, terrorists, and rogue foreign governments. But for those with a deeper understanding of digital technology, the future brings the growing invisibility of national bor¬ ders, a distributed realignment of political and eco¬ nomic power, and an increasing vulnerability to forms of espionage that have little to do with national gov¬ ernments and everything to do with the global economy. Meanwhile, civil libertarians say that recent efforts by Lhe Cold Warriors to mandate the use of encryption key recovery systems within the United States pose a mon¬ umental threat to a basic civil liberty: privacy. \"This debate is no longer about export controls,” says Alan David¬ son of the Center for Democracy and Technology. \"It’s becoming clearer and clearer that we’re talk¬ ing about what’s going to happen domestically with encryption.” Such suspicions were confirmed by FBI assistant director Jim Kail- strom, the agency’s foremost wire¬ tapping authority, when he told the House International Relations Committee: “We don’t give a damn about export We care about protect¬ ing people domestically.” Trouble is, Kail strom and his allies want to \"protect” Americans with an unwieldy, insecure, and potentially unconsti¬ tutional encryption key recovery scheme that would require citizens to make their private communications accessible to law enforcement in advance of any evi¬ dence that they have participated in a crime. The crypto debate is no longer about export controls. We're now talking about policies that will have a clear impact within the United States. Big Brother reanimated Admittedly, the strong-arm lobbying tactics used by the Clinton administration’s national security all-stars have not yet proven effective in the House, where SAFE now enjoys a full majority. But over in the Seriate, the story is entirely different. The reigning chair of the encryption debate is Sena¬ tor John McCain, the powerful Arizona Republican who heads the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. McCain is widely known as a free-inarket iconoclast - a reputation he solidified in February 1996, by becoming the lone GOF senator to vote against the Telecommunications Act that ostensi¬ bly deregulated the telecom industry McCain opposed the act because, he said, it didn’t do enough to create competition and keep the government’s hands off Lhe market. But as a former US Navy pilot who spent more than five years in a North Vietnam POW camp, McCain takes a hard line on national security issues, and the cry pto debate has forced him to make an awkward choice between his free-market idealism and his hawk¬ ish national security instincts. Ultimately, his Cold War anxieties prevailed. McCain signaled bis new resolve last spring, when he joined forces with Senator Bob Kerrey (D-Nebraska), the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Com¬ mittee, to introduce S 909, the Secure Public Networks Act - a crypto bill so restrictive that it could cost the US software industry billions of dollars in lost sales while also creating a national system for online wiretapping that would breathe new life into the tired Big Brother cliche. The McCain-Kerrey bill reinforces existing encryption controls that limit the strength of exported software to only 56 bits for companies that promise to install key recoveiy features within two years. (For those that refuse to make such a promise, the export limit will remain at a feeble 40 bits.) The bill also creates a domestic key recovery scheme that would effectively require anyone who wants to buy or sell products on the Internet to give up a copy of their encryption keys to a \"key recovery agent” approved by the US government. (Imagine being required to hand over a copy of your front door keys to a government- certified locksmith.) Any law enforcement agency would then be able to obtain quick and easy access to encrypted data by getting copies of private keys from key recovery agents with only a subpoena - a legal hurdle that is much less stringent than a search war¬ rant because it does not require police to rigorously demonstrate \"probable cause” that an individual has been involved in a crime. To accomplish the monumental task of providing police with this access, key recovery centers would be set up across the country and - the Clinton admin¬ istration hopes - around the world. These centers would handle and store keys to encrypted data for the sole purpose of allowing law enforcement agencies quick access to any suspicious information traveling over networks. But with billions of transactions and communications stored on individual hard drives and zipping through cyberspace, the system envisioned in the bill - and endorsed by the White House - would rival the US post office in scale. However, unlike the post office, privacy would in no way he assured. In a day-to-day sense, the McCain-Kerrey bill is tantamount to ordering the US Postal Service to ban envelopes and requiring everyone to send all their mail on postcards. Meanwhile, the post office would also make a copy of each card and keep it in a central database that would, by its very nature, be vulnerable to mismanagement by postal officials with all the intelligence and integrity of Cliff Clavin from Cheers. \"We don’t believe it will work ” Michael Mac Kay, vice president of Novell, flatly told die Senate Judiciary Committee this summer. Peter Neumann, principal scientist at SRI International, calls the idea of govern¬ ment-mandated domestic key recovery \"ludicrous ” ► ILLUSTRATION BY SCOTT MENCHlN WIRED OCTOBER 1997 THE NETIZEN The steady drumbeat offear sounded by the FBI and NSAhas inspired members of Congress to propose unworkable solutions to a dubious crisis. Even Dorothy Denning, a professor of computer sci¬ ence at Georgetown University and a vocal proponent of key recover, says in a recent study on encryption and organized crime published by the National Stra¬ tegy Information Center, “Mandatory key recovery would force users to take risks they might consider unacceptable, particularly with respect to their com¬ munications where they might not need key recovery for their own purposes .” Denning's study also throws into doubt the FBI's assertions that it needs access to crypto keys to solve crimes. Worldwide, she reports, the total number of criminal cases in which encryption has been used hovers at about 500. But in many of those cases, crypto did not pre¬ vent or even slow crime-solving efforts by law enforcement. AlLhough Denning and study coau¬ thor William Baugh, a former assistant FBI director, warn that the use of encryption by organized criminals and terrorists is on the rise, they also doubt that domestic key recovery and export controls will do much to stop this trend. Nevertheless, the drumbeat of fear sounded by the FBI and NSA has inspired several members of Congress to propose unworkable solutions to a dubi¬ ous crisis. Senator McCain's recent conversion to the side of the crypto hardliners has been particularly damaging, and it has left many observers wondering what prompted his sudden about-face. The answer, it turns out, is blandly familiar. Last spring, national security officials visited McCain to give him the latest version of their crypto glooin-and-doom scenario. The Briefing, as it is called, has become a rite of passage in Congress, as almost every member has been subjected to it in one form or another. Some report that the meeting begins with a dramatic Cold War song and dance, during which agents sweep the meeting room for bugs. They then talk about the use of encryption technology by the Cali drug cartel. They discuss PGFs worldwide availability and its use by terrorists, pedophiles, and illegal gamblers - and so on and so on, with the purpose of instilling a neurotic fear that the American way of life will go to hell in a handbasket unless police are somehow given access to the keys that protect encrypted data. Of course, law enforcement has a legitimate interest in trying to prevent crime. But other factors may be at work as well. FBI director Louis Freeh, for example, has a few skeletons in his closet: no explanation for the crash of TWA Flight 800, no resolution in the Saudi bombing, no more suspects in the Atlanta Olympic Park bombing, reports of mishandled evidence at the FBI crime lab - the list goes on. Implicitly, at least, strong encryption provides Freeh with a plausible explana¬ tion for some of the FBI's recent failures while also raising the specter of a new and unseen criminal menace. As Republican Senator Jon Ryl of Arizona fretted, “I don't want to be sitting here a few years from now having law enforcement tell us we had the opportunity to stop terrorism and did not ” Such arguments struck a chord with McCain. “This is not something I say often, but the three senators cosponsoring this bill: myself, Kerrey, and Massachu¬ setts Senator John Kerry, all have one thing in common: we all served in Vietnam \" the spry Arizonan told me while I visited him on Capitol Hill, “The strongest opponents to this bill have never heard a shot fired.\" That is the fault line that divides the old guard from the new. Four long years after the White House's for¬ mer crypto flack, Mike Nelson, first called encryption “the Bosnia of telecommunications policy,\" the analogy still holds true. For the grizzled Cold Warriors, enciyp- tion is a fixed opponent to be surrounded, rolled back, and conquered. But for the high tech industry, private sector businesses, and millions of individual Internet users, strong encryption provides a powerful defense against the anarchic jungle combat of eco¬ nomic espionage and computer fraud. In the digital age, crime has less to do with criminals using the sys¬ tem than with criminals breaking into the system. Yet the law enforcement community and its sympa¬ thizers envision their criminal foes as looming Death Stars - large, easily identifiable targets equipped with ample resources and big guns - not as small, distrib- * uted guerrilla fighters armed with nothing more than a decent PC and modem, some patience, and lots of guile. Political calculus In fairness, worries about crime must be taken seri¬ ously by any elected official. In a society infected by an undercurrent of nervous fear, taking a tough stance on crime wins more votes than serving as a poster child for civil liberties. It would be career suicide for any politician to appear as if his or her views on crypto liberalization facilitated an incident like the 1994 World Trade Center bombing. (Ramsi Yousef, who was convicted for the bombing, had encrypted infor¬ mation on his computer that outlined plans to blow up 11 US-owned commercial airliners, although that information was also found in decrypted form.) As Peter Harter, global public policy counsel for Netscape, puts it, looking strong on encryption “allows the Cold Warriors to get on their horses and trot off into the sunset in the name of law and order and the American way.\" Inside the Clinton administration, the rift that divides those w r ho want fewer controls on crypto and those ► 06 WIRED OCTOBER 1997 Muiu£ The Glenlivet Single Malt.

Our heroes this time are Sanjay Madan and Tony Hsieh, two com¬ puter science grads from Harvard who started a side business devel¬ oping Web sites while working their first postcollegiate jobs at Oracle. In an effort to help their small-business clients generate traffic, the entrepre¬ neurial pair hit upon the simple but effective idea of a banner-exchange program*That way, they figured, par¬ ticipating sites could get more expo¬ sure without having to pay for it. The idea caught on immediately - within a couple of days, dozens of sites had joined the network. Within a week, Madan and Hsieh decided to put everything else aside to con¬ centrate solely on their new project. A little more than a year later, their company, LinkExchange, has become the Web's largest ad network, with about 100,000 member sites and 800 new sites added each day. According to a March audit con¬ ducted by Web statistics firm 1/PRO, those 100,000 sites deliver about 4 million ad views per day.The daily impressions are sliced up three ways: half are devoted to promoting mem¬ ber sites, a quarter go toward pro¬ moting LinkExchange itself, and the remaining quarter are earmarked for sale to paying customers* With 25 workers jammed into a San Francisco warehouse, Link- Exchange's headquarters has the ragtag look of either a low-budget volunteer operation or The Next Big Thing. In a way, the company is both. \"From the start, our goal has been to make our members happy,\" Hsieh says.\"Our company has grown by providing the services our members have asked for.\" Venture capitalists are beginning to knock on LinkExchange's door, but Its founders insist they're more concerned with customer service than selling out.\"We want to bring banner advertising to everyone on the Web, not just the big corpora¬ tions,\" says Madan. \"Everything we do is guided by that goal.\" - G .

Based on sales of Schwa paraphernalia, lings continue to wonder what the hell it is. What is known is this: Schwa began on Bill Barker's drawing table in the summer of 1992. Barker, 40, a conceptual artist and former advertising art dir¬ ector, had been looking for a way to satirize the marketing industry when a pal supported Barker ever since The recently published Schwa World Operations Manual trans¬ forms the Schwa mystery into a profound critique. The book (\"banned on over 13,000,000 planets!\") offers step-by-step instructions on how to take over and govern your own world.

Then, a few days later, the ovoid insignia was staring back at him. And within a year, the logo had become the basis of a mail-order company peddling Schwa para¬ phernalia - a business that has charts.Through our allegiance to such standardized forms and marketing campaigns. Barker suggests, we surrender our¬ selves to a dehumanizing force - a force that is alien only on the face of It. - Brad Wieners him a copy of The Secret Government-a book that details how an alien conspiracy parodies a menu of \"official\" documents: permits, surveys, warranties,contracts,and flow created whenever President Clinton's motorcade come"
