In this manual, I will teach you all there is to achieve 100% financial freedom. This is no mambo jambo self improvement book you normally see in the stores. I will present you clear strategies in fact very simple straightforward strategies to achieve FULL FINANCIAL FREEDOM in 3 years time. This is my pledge to you. This is indeed the first time ever you’ll ever see such a manual in Malaysia. Written for the layman, to make sure you fully understand and ready to implement all that has been taught. In 90 days time, you will start to see money coming your way. It has been my passion of showing other people to achieve the same financial freedom I have enjoyed. I have learned from many people, from books, from gurus like Tony Robbins, Robert Kiyosaki and many others. What you get in this manual you will not be able to find in those books. It is a combination of all the skills gained and a real working methodology suited only for Malaysia. If you are from outside Malaysia, you may try to suit these methods. It can be used anywhere but is more suited to the Malaysian climate. I must say we are all blessed to be born in Malaysia. Whether as a bumi or not, everyone has the opportunity to live in peace and harmony with all the vehicles available to achieve financial freedom. The capitalization of Malaysia coupled with our open economy and infrastructure allows us to not only venture domestically but also globally. I have actually put power of Internet as Chapter 9, but it is in fact the most important part of this manual without doubt. I have explained the other money making strategies first so that in combination you can use them with the power of the Internet. Internet allows us to connect with other people in this world within seconds. It is indeed a gift from god in many ways. It allows us to sell and break all the barriers that have engulfed us all these decades. We should have no more reason not to make money from the comfort of our home. I suggest you concentrate fully on this magic power of Internet money making machine. I also urge you to read every single word in this manual. Do not skip any of the pages. Every single sentence I wrote is there for a reason. You can also read this manual again and again or make photocopies and bring along in your wallet for easy reference. Do the exercises and use the tools in your real life. You will start to realize within 30 days if you fully utilize all these tools, in 3 years time you will be living your life the way you please. Going anywhere you like, doing the things you love most and not having to answer to anyone. This manual can be used by anyone of any race and creed or by whatever status in society. By whatever education you’ve received, by whatever salary you’re earning. No matter you’re a housewife or a school teacher, these methods will definitely help you. I also urge you to become a member of my website as will be explained later. Things change at light speed these days.

Good luck!\n\nHal [email protected]\n\n6\n\nCHAPTER 1 Fundamentals of Success - 9 Day Review There are 9 fundamentals of success you must be able to understand and be the best you can be for each of them. I suggest you print these nine fundamentals and stick them to a wall so that you can see them everyday. You will need to concentrate on them and believe that these will be the nine areas that will impact your life. You will target and practice each fundamental in 9 days for each one of them. Allocate one day each on what needs to be done for each fundamental.\n\nEmotional Mastery Relationship Mastery\n\nTime Mastery\n\nPhysical Mastery\n\nSUCCESS\n\nFinancial Mastery Rest&Play Mastery\n\nGoalsetting Mastery Computer Mastery\n\nFIGURE 1.0\n\nPrioritizing Mastery\n\nNINE FUNDAMENTALS OF LIFE\n\nDAY ONE : EMOTIONAL MASTERY Virtually everything we do is to change the way we feel. In many instances including from my own experience, this is perhaps the most important mastery you must possess. In many cases people with so many talents, skills, education background fail miserably in their lives because they were not able to control their emotions. When I first achieved my full financial independence, I didn’t know what else to do with my life and was looking for directions as to the meaning of life. Within an instant I destroyed all that I achieved then. I didn’t need to work because money was coming in every month and I had all I needed, nobody to work for and didn’t need to go anywhere. It can actually destroy you. Too many people let outside events take control of our emotions for no reason. Let me give you an example, the fact that your friend has now become more richer or more successful than you has left you ashamed and with a sense of defeat. Whereas this event is quite insignificant as you can change yourself and perhaps become even more successful in your life or perhaps you are already achieving more successes in other areas of\n\n7\n\nyour life. Take advantage of your emotions and do not use it as hindrance to improve yourself. Give also priority on your spiritual needs. Visit more of your mosque, church, temple or whatever your beliefs are. Without this as a fundamental to your life, you will not find a purpose to your being, and everything else will fail automatically before you can even start realizing it. DAY TWO : PHYSICAL MASTERY This is quite an important mastery which many somehow forget or simply ignore. I’ll ask you a simple question. Is it worth it to have everything you’ve ever dreamed of, yet not have the physical health to be able to enjoy it? Do you wake up every morning feeling refreshed and energized? Or do you wake up feeling just as tired as before. We cram our bodies with high-fat, poison our systems with cigarettes, alcohol and drugs and sit passively in front of our TV sets. You will need to control your health and your looks as this will inadvertently control your emotions and the other masteries explained in this chapter. You must put priority on health over anything else because without it you may not achieve the success and financial freedom we so eagerly try to teach you here. I guess you can easily go out and buy any book on fitness and health. But I can teach you some fundamental steps to increase your health. When I complained to my doctor last time about me always being tired or how to reduce weight, he always advised me to eat as you need and exercise everyday. These are actually the two only ways to actually increase your health. Reducing weight is the best way to tell whether you have improved your health. However, to let you start of with something, let me guide you the steps you can straight away do. Remember I am not a doctor, so please go and get a professional’s advice for this area. Step 1 : Go and see a doctor and do a full blast medical examination and perhaps ask for the doctors advise. This is the first step. You can actually deduct this from your tax or if you’re covered by your company better still. The main things you need to look at is your cholesterol levels, your sugar level and others. Step 2 : Calculate your Body Mass Index (BMI). Ask your doctor about this. BMI is made up of your weight and height. If you are overweight, work to achieve your optimum BMI level ie. reduce your weight to achieve that. Step 3 : Try controlling your intake of fat and cholesterol. I promise you’ll feel better not stuffing your stomach with too much intake. In other words, try to eat less but more frequent and don’t skip any of the 3 main meals. Take more fish and vegetable and take less meat. Step 4 : Drink at least 8 glasses of plain water daily. This is not air limau, soya bean or whatever. Just get as much liquid into your body as possible. Step 5 : Exercise daily. People always complain about not having the time to exercise. That is perhaps the worst myth possibly created by mankind. All you need is 15 minutes a day doing simple exercises like taking a jog. Better still you can allocate 10 minutes in the morning before taking your shower and 10 minutes after coming back from work. If you can allocate more time the better. But again start slow and faster as you go. If you prefer other sports like swimming, tennis or golf by all means do but again jogging (aerobic activity) is the best sport to burn your fat. You’ll learn about making time later on from Time Mastery covered later. Step 6 : Stop smoking and drinking. This way you save money as well as save yourself and others. I know it’s difficult and you may have heard this like 1 million times but this is the only way. I do not wish to dwell to much in this step. Step 7 : Make sure you get enough rest and sleep. At least get 7 hours daily. Your brain work best once you get enough rest. It’s not the quantity that matters, it’s the quality. Once in school, I asked someone who scored 102% in Add Maths, what was the secret? He said he had enough sleep before the test. Step 8 : Take holidays, hiking the jungle or walks along the beaches. It not only improves your physical well being but also your emotional well being.\n\n8\n\nDAY THREE : RELATIONSHIP MASTERY What’s the use of all the wealth and success if you can’t share it with someone. Would you want to have all the money to travel around the world but with no one to go with. Sometime ago, I went to Paris somewhere in the 1990s. It was my dream then to see Paris, to go to the museums etc2. But as I was alone, I got bored fairly quick and went back to my hotel room for a nap. Therefore, you must master your relationships – romantic, family, business, friends and social. I’ve found that for myself, it is the greatest resource because it opens up the door to all the other resources I’d need. Give priority over this as it will be very important to your life. DAY FOUR : FINANCIAL MASTERY 95% of this manual will be talking and giving tools and strategies to achieve this strategy. I will be explaining very much more in the later part of this manual. However, again money is not everything. But whatever comes second is far from it. We always fantasize that money will solve all our problems and relieve all our pressures. The key is not the mere pursuit of wealth, but changing your beliefs and attitudes about it so you see it as a means of contribution, not the endall and be-all happiness. Gain wealth and financial freedom so that you can contribute to your society, family and religion. DAY FIVE : TIME MASTERY This is the mastery that is most lacking for most Malaysians. We are known worldwide for not being able to keep to time. Always blaming on some other thing like the traffic jam. We are so used to it that we think there is absolutely nothing wrong with it. We always make fun of the phrase “Malaysian time”. We also most of the time just go on with our lives and without noticing it, time just pass by. You’ve heard the saying Oh! there goes my weekend again. Well, without time management all other things can never be achieved. There must be like dozens of books out there teaching everything you need to know about Time Management. But in summary let me give you some steps to control your time. Step 1 : Analyse your current life and see how much time you are allocating for each activity. Take some time sitting down and preparing list of activities you do and time you’ve been spending for each. For instance, what time do you normally wake up and what time do you sleep. How many hours do you spend in a week for TV, traveling to work, eating, holidaying, etc2. Locate the gaps in times taken for each activity and improve time taken to do them. For instance, you may want to reduce time for TV to just 1 hour for the TV3 news each day. Step 2 : Prioritize your time and allocate number of hours for activities you think that is most important to you. Collect all the gaps in the times and allocate more time to activities you think which is more important. Example, let’s say you normally spend 15 minutes after work watching the 6 o’clock news, why not spend the time to exercise and watch just the 8 o’clock news on prime time. Step 3 : Plan your times and activities. You can start allocating more time for exercise and Internet surfing from cutting times from watching TV for instance. For example on a normal weekday, you can plan like below :11:00 am 6:00 am 6:30 am 7:00 am 5:30 pm 7:00 pm 7:30 pm 9:00 pm FIGURE 1.1\n\n-\n\n6:00 am 6:30 am 7:00 am 7:30 am 7:00 pm 7:30 pm 9:00 pm 11:00 pm\n\nSleep Jog Shower and coffee Go to work Arrive home and exercise Shower and rest Eat, news and talk to family Internet, making money\n\n1 hour ½ hour ½ hour ½ hour 1 ½ hour ½ hour 1 ½ hour 2 hours\n\nTIME TABLE OF LIFE\n\n9\n\nStep 4 : Write out your plan and stick it on a wall. And make sure you stick to them. After each week analyse whether you are able to meet them and try to improve on them. Time is money, time is gold…. Especially in this era of globalization and internet, time is of essence. Later I’ll you many other ways to save time by jumping into the Internet. Chores normally needing your Saturdays or lunch hour to do can all be done from the comfort of your office or home. I’ll guarantee you’ll be able to save almost half a day if you creatively optimize your time by using new methods I’ll explain later. So you may think that you’ll just have 2 hours a day to make money. Reality is you have the weekends to play around with. Let’s look at it in more detail. In a month, you have 4 weeks with 2 days off being Saturdays and Sundays. Let’s assume Sundays is your day off to concentrate on your social life, family life and holidays. So you have 4 days in a month. In a year you should have 48 days. Then normally, you should have 15 days a year of leave. Combine that then you’ll have 63 days in a year time for your money making business. Malaysia is blessed because we have nearly 15 days of public holidays each year. Add that up you’ll have 78 days. Therefore, the 2 hours on weekdays you spend adds up to 480 hours a year of almost 20 full days. All together you have 98 full days for your own business or 3½ months to fully concentrate your efforts on your own business. I’m sure you can build many businesses in 1 years time with all this time in hand. DAY SIX : GOAL SETTING MASTERY Success is goals, and all else is commentary. All successful people are intensely goal oriented. They know what they want and they are focused single-mindedly on achieving it, every single day. Be absolutely clear what exactly are your goals. Set a long term goal with short term goals within it. Think about the future and create a Five-Year Fantasy. Imagine what your life would be in 5 years time. Take some time to close your eyes and imagine it as though it were so real. Therefore, everything you do from now is to attain those goals. How would it look like if you have full financial freedom? Will you still wake up early morning? Where would you go at 9 am? Will you still buy the papers or busy going to see people and planning your business empire with your employees. Imagination makes things happen. Without it Columbus wouldn’t have sailed to America. Parameswara might have not reached Melaka! Man might not have reached the moon! DAY SEVEN : REST AND PLAY MASTERY All work makes Jack a dull boy! Stress and tension will destroy you. Take some time off! Exercise is one good way. Perhaps plan for a holiday once in 2 months to anyone of the Malaysian islands. Plan it properly so that you don’t overspend. Or go for weekend picnics or to a waterfall. Or even just go window shopping at one of the many KL shopping centres. If you’re stressed out, take a short walk and enjoy nature and surely take some time to think and reflect on life. Stress kills… I’ll explain more at the end of this manual after learning all the methods and strategies. DAY EIGHT : COMPUTER MASTERY Finally, Computer Mastery is something you cannot live without. I would like to spend more time explaining how important this mastery is these days. If you do not master this skill, you’ll be left out completely. My entire manual will depend on your mastery of computer skills. You need this in your job, your expenses, budgeting, paying taxes, doing online-banking, paying your bills, paying utilities, paying your summonses, reading the news, hearing music, entertainment and finally most importantly making money on the internet. You’ll save a lot of time. Time you can spend to do more important things. For example, you used to have to go to Kedai Telekom to settle your bills every month. If you pay online, you can already save at least 1 hour a month already, time which you can spend trying to make money online. With this you’ll save petrol\n\n10\n\nmoney by not getting stuck in traffic jams, money you can use to invest instead. I’ll try to give simple steps you can take to master this as quickly as possible. Those who are masters of the universe in IT can skip this else, follow these simple steps : Step 1 : Obvious enough. Buy a computer. You won’t need all the fancy graphics cards and biggest monitor or the flattest most colourful PC you can find. All you need is a fit for purpose PC that can run Windows, Words, Excel, Internet and more. A package consisting of 1.70GHz Intel Celeron with 40GB Hardrive and 15” Monitor is all you need. As I’m speaking it would cost you only RM 800.00 for everything at Low Yat Plaza, Imbi KL. So go and get one, just to start! Step 2 : It would take some time to be good in Windows, Excel, Words, Internet Explorer and the likes. For me it has always been trial and error. Sooner or later I’ll learn it. But that’s me. For you perhaps a 2 day class on a weekend to cover everything is necessary. These courses range between RM150-RM300 for everything, Windows, Words, Internet etc2. It’s worth the investment. Buy also a book on learning Words, Excel etc2. A Dummies Guide to learning Windows should be sufficient. Remember again you can claim this book expense as a tax deduction. Step 3 : Get your required softwares from Low Yat Plaza. Spend some time browsing the area and talking to the store keepers. You’ll be surprised you’ll learn a lot from them. Step 4 : Finally, start allocating at least 1 hour a day just playing around with your PC. I’m sure you’ll use a PC at work also, so you can do plenty of trials and errors there as well. Step 5 : Get Internet Access. I’ll explain why Internet is so important in later part of this manual. I’ve dedicated one entire chapter just to explain this. But basically, a dial-up account with Tmnet is not enough. Get Streamyx ie. broadband access. You just need to pay RM66 per month to get unlimited access with download speeds up to 380 kbps. Your normal dial-up is 56kbps speed with sometimes problematic access. This is money worth spending as Internet will be one of your most important Money Making Tool in order to achieve financial freedom in 3 years time! Check whether your area is serviced for Streamyx by going to your nearest Kedai Telekom. You can also get more information by going to http://isp.tm.net.my Step 6 : Create networking with friends or joint ventures and share computer skills or ask them for tips on problems you may encounter while online or using your PC. Step 7 : Make sure you learn Excel. It is a very important tool. Majority people don’t really know how to use spreadsheet. What a pity this must be one of the most important softwares ever created in the PC era. You’ll learn how to budget, properly cut your expenses and calculate revenues and more. Make sure you master Word as well. Notice that a lot of Malaysian governmental bodies, banks, companies etc2 only take action if you send a formal letter copied to their supervisors. By a laser printer as well, cost you RM200 if it helps. All in all you might have to spend at most RM1,200 on a PC and training and RM66 per month on internet access. This is a worthwhile investment to achieve your early retirement I assure you. DAY NINE : PRIORITIZING MASTERY I will show you later on how important this rule is on other things to achieve success in financial freedom. But briefly for a start, let me explain this very important rule. The 80/20 principle or better called the Pareto principle was founded by an Italian sociologist or postman nearly 100 years ago. It says that actually 80% of things we do are actually trivial and 20% are actually critical. So, 20% of our efforts will be the one that is making the 80% of our revenue. This is true for anything else, if you look at statistics, 20% of population are also the ones earning 80% of wealth in the country. 20% of nations on earth being USA, Japan and Europe are the ones with 80% of the world’s GDP. Look at our expenses too, if you look back at Figure 1.7 of Chapter 4, 80% of our total expenses is in just two things accommodation and transport! If you concentrate and tackle that 20% and devote most of your time and effort on that 20%, you’ll make 80% most of your income from that. I will show you later at the end of this chapter what you’ll need to concentrate on.\n\n11\n\nCHAPTER 2 Every Single Sen Counts : Savings Strategy Every single sen counts! This is a very important lesson indeed. Every single ringgit is a money seed to your financial freedom. Every single ringgit you throw, you just lost your opportunity to be a millionaire. This principle is called “Financial Freedom on a Ringgit a Day”. I will illustrate to you by giving this very simple example. Let’s suppose you take a single ringgit and put it into a special bank account that will let the ringgit grow, untouched by taxes and fees. How long will it take for this single ringgit to grow into RM 1 million? That depends on the interest rate that the bank account pays. If it’s a normal bank account, normally it would take a long time. Table below illustrates how long one ringgit can turn to RM 1 million at various interest rates: Interest Rate 0% 3% 5% 10% 15% 20% FIGURE 1.2\n\nTime in Years Never 468 284 145 99 75\n\nONE RINGGIT GROWS TO RM 1 MILLION\n\nWhat if you put a ringgit a day or RM 30 a month. Look below : Interest Rate 3% 5% 10% 15% 20% FIGURE 1.3\n\nTime in Years 147 100 56 40 32\n\nONE RINGGIT A DAY GROWS TO RM 1 MILLION\n\nWow! Means if you started saving one ringgit a day since you were born means at 15% interest, you should be a millionaire by 40 years old. Now suppose you plant several seeds and save up to RM 10 day. Look : Interest Rate 3% 5% 10% 15% 20% FIGURE 1.4\n\nTime in Years 74 54 34 25 20\n\nTEN RINGGIT A DAY GROWS TO RM 1 MILLION\n\nSo it’s actually possible to become a millionaire in Malaysia after 20 years by just keeping RM10 a day. Of course you’ll say it’s difficult getting 20% returns from any bank. If you were to put it into unit trusts or real estate, history shows clearly in 20 years time 20% per annum return is normal.\n\n12\n\nHowever, the purpose of this exercise is to change your attitude about money especially those RM 1 you normally throw away. I’ll bet you’ll think twice from now on before throwing away one of those silly single ringgits. It’s as though throwing away a million ringgit seed. The real key is to keep socking away the money. Let the numbers whisper their silent but relentless message. Consistency. Day in, day out. Save. Invest. Save. Invest. One example is a couple combining their incomes and putting all their savings into well selected unit trusts while buying a cheap car and a house. Saving everything and watched cash starting to pile up in 10 years time. They were able to already retire and never to work anymore and of course buy a bigger house and a way bigger car. While another couple spent all their savings on expensive cars and bigger houses in popular areas while stretching themselves too thin. They had to stress out their lives for the next 30 years. Therefore, live on less than you earn, invest the surplus, avoid debt and build a long term security. Now let’s set some specific and realistic financial goals for you. Follow these steps : Target Amount Rate Time Purpose\n\n: : : : :\n\nHow much money you want to accumulate? How much ringgit can you squeeze a day? What interest rate can you earn? How long do you want to achieve your goal? What is your financial purpose?\n\n: : : : :\n\nRM 1 million RM 10 a day 20% 20 years Educate the youth in Malaysia.\n\nFor example : Target Amount Rate Time Purpose\n\nStart saving. Do it now. Do it regularly. I’ll give you one very simple exercise for self discipline to achieve and ponder about this. Go out and buy a piggy bank perhaps a plastic one. Every single day try to put RM10 into it. By the end of the month, save it into your unit trust or invest it. Take down the exact amount you’ve saved and the amount you’ll make from compounding interest in the next 10 years time. Make it a habit to also drop any money change into the piggy bank. Even 1 sen is worth something if for 100 days you keep dropping one into it. Well this is one of the most easiest and practical ways. In the later chapter we’ll show you some effective savings method to learn.\n\n13\n\nCHAPTER 3 The Six Money Secrets Now that you’ve learned the true value of every single sen, I’ll show you the six money secrets the prosperous and the wealthy practice in their lives. I call them secrets because not many realize the simplicity of the concepts and use them in their everyday lives. These are essentially money skills to achieve whatever you want : houses, cars, travel and most importantly FINANCIAL FREEDOM.\n\nShare it Make it Invest it Save it Control it Value it\n\nFIGURE 1.5\n\nSkill 1 : Value It Neccessity for work: Importance of charity: The need for saving: Accountability:\n\nSIX ESSENTIAL MONEY SKILLS\n\nWhen you earn it, you value it. Give away the first 10% to charity. Put away the next 10% for savings. Account for every single sen.\n\nSkill 2 : Control It Set up a simple system to organize your financial life. Use Excel to organize your expenditure. Basically you must try to control the leaks in your spending system and get in more income coming in. I’ve dedicated one whole chapter later on to explain tools and methods dealing with this subject. However, follow this simple plan for Control It and you should be okay : 1. Plan your purchase in advance. Your estimate budget or the lowest you can go. Write it down on a piece of paper. 2. Spend some time to do market research before purchasing. For example, at least go to 4 places and get the lowest from there. 3. Negotiate and get a discount or find all the bargains you can get.\n\n14\n\n4. 5. 6. 7. 8.\n\nGet a receipt. Ask for it. Examine your receipt. Sometimes they make a mistake. Categorize your receipt. I’ll explain more in the next chapter. Balance your accounts. File your receipt.\n\nSkill 3 : Save It The object of the money game is to accumulate enough investments so that the income from these investments will eventually support you. So save your surplus. Most people save money by buying something on bargain but end up spending that money on something else. I’ll give you an example, if you managed to save RM10 from negotiating with the seller, when paying sock up the RM10 into a “savings envelope” and dump it into your piggy bank. At the end of the month, dump your piggy bank into a unit trusts. Planning is also a key method for saving. Spend a few minutes a day planning your day. Once you’re successful plan your month and then start planning the next 90 days and so on so forth. Means you’ll spend more time planning your purchases. For example, plan exactly when you do your groceries. If you purchase at Tesco, Giant or the other hypermarts, you’ll save at least by 20% your expenses but it would be a hassle to go far to get your groceries. So plan exactly when you need to go and buy in bulk. Avoid impulse buying and plan every single time. One other major money saver is to cut up your credit cards and keep at least one for emergencies or business. Pay the annual fees from your points. With this alone you’ll save money at least by 10%. Have you ever walked past 10 sen and not picked it up because it was just 10 sen? The truth is that sen is worth 1 million times. So pick it up, save and invest it. 53 Ways to Save RM53 a Month 1. Shop with a list and stick to only it. 2. Say no to ATM fees, plan ahead for your cash needs. Don’t pay RM1.50 for nothing. 3. If your bank charge fees, close it and maintain just one. 4.

Skip roti canai and nasi lemak… Just buy a toaster and whole grain bread! We’ll discuss much more about controlling your spend in Chapter 5 - Understanding Your Expenses later on. Skill 4 : Invest It We will elaborate this more in the later chapters. There are many investment instruments available in Malaysia such as Amanah Saham, Koperasi Bank Rakyat, stock market, real estate etc2. Kiyosaki said the best way to become wealthy and sustain it forever is by becoming an investor. Don’t become a sole proprietor or a maintenance contractor, you never know what’s going to happen next. RM 500,000 put into a unit trust that gives 15% per annum will sustain your monthly expense for RM 5,500 per month forever. Do the calculations! I’ll show you how in the next chapter. Let someone else do all the dirty work for you, there are many accountants, lawyers, engineers, managers out there willing to work you. Just invest in them! Why would you want to supervise workers or pay their salaries where there is someone else who can better do it for you while you concentrate your efforts in finding other profitable businesses, going through all opportunities and listening to other people trying to sell and convince you. Being an INVESTOR is your number ONE goal. Skill 5 : Make It In this manual, I’ll concentrate on Internet, real estate & stocks as your money makers. There are actually more, but we’ll just concentrate on these for the time being. Your first target is to make\n\n16\n\nmoney before you can save or invest it. You should have many sources of income and not simply rely on a single source of income. A lot of people all their lives put their faith in one single job and try to grow only that while relying on their EPF savings for their retirement. In this day of globalisation, you can never rely on a company or other people to be charitable to you and maintain you as an employee for life. As time goes by they expect that you do more and more until you can never sustain. And let me tell you about job security. There is absolutely none. If you still believe it than you must be living in the middle ages. Factories, businesses always move places. If they see there is an opportunity to save money elsewhere for instance going to China they will do it and will find all means necessary to let you go. But having said this, you will still definitely need a JOB. But let this just be just another source of your income in the short term. While your main goal is achieve LONG TERM FINANCIAL FREEDOM. Plus, you learn a lot while on the job. Many companies train their staff well. You’ll get to develop people skills, computer skills, formal writing skills, communication skills and more. So don’t miss out finding that job for short term money and the only best training you’ll ever get…better than going to a university. Best thing is you get paid for being trained by them! I elaborate more on this in Chapter 5. Don’t miss out on Chapter 9 – Internet, this will be your key money making machine. Skill 6 : Share It Don’t be greedy with this knowledge. Share it with people just like what I’m doing now. If you can help others with this god given knowledge, they will come back to you and give more. Now that you’ve understood all the skills that is required let’s get down to the dirty work in the next chapter.\n\n17\n\nCHAPTER 4 Understanding Your Expenses This is one of the important parts of this manual. Take a day or two to fully understand your needs and expenses. Identify your current expenses and work out your short term goals and the kind of expenses you would want once you’ve retired. But your target from now on is to have a expense target that secures your financial freedom first. Once you’ve attained that, you can slowly raise the bar and enjoy the more expensive things in life. I’m not teaching you to not enjoy life but to delay it just in the short term to enjoy later forever. We’re blessed in Malaysia because we live in a social free market that is those who work hard and smart can live a life of abundance while freely going anywhere we want and practicing our faith and our own way of life. First let’s really understand the definition of debts or loans. They’re the good loans and they’re the bad loans. What are the good loans? They’re money you owe to pay off an asset that earns and gives you a return in the future. For example, housing loan is a good loan because you’ll sell the house for a huge profit that is more than your interest on the loan. Also, if you take a personal loan to invest in a business that returns higher than the interest you pay, that is a good loan. Then there’s the bad loans, which money you borrow just to pay off your expenses such as car loans, furniture and electrical appliances. You won’t get a return from the loan. Instead the asset depreciates in value. But you need them anyway. You need that car but don’t borrow money to pay for a big car. Live within your means. Get the car that is suited to your current income. So let’s start moving with these steps : Step 1 : Analyze your current expenses Take at least one day or two to sit down and go through your receipts, your bank statements, your credit card statements or even spend a day going to the grocery and putting a budget to how much you really spend in a month. Use Excel to list all of them down and make sure you print them and stick it on a wall. Let’s categorize them as follows :1. Accomodation You’ll need somewhere to live, eat and sleep while planning your financial freedom. This should be a comfortable house and an affordable one at that. With streamyx and easy access to groceries and your workplace. But don’t kill yourself by trying to stay in Damansara Heights or Bangsar. As long as you can easily perform all that has been taught in this manual, you should be okay. And the number one thing is to BUY that first house. Use a loan and buy the house. I will explain in the later chapter about real estate and why you need to do this. But get a bank/company/government loan for that first house. If you are currently renting, please straight away now try to get a place of your own. Many people would say I can’t afford an apartment in KL or I’ll wait until I can afford that house and rent in the meantime. The more you delay, the more it will cost you and the more difficult you are to be financially free. Well just let me show you how to own your house within minutes by doing this simple exercise below : Let’s say your current rent is RM600 for a 3 bedroom apartment in Cheras. A 3 bed apartment in Cheras/Bukit Jalil would normally cost around RM75,000 (including legal and MRTA). At 95% loan of RM 71,250 with cash downpayment of just RM 3,750 and with a loan of 6% per annum ie. at BLR+1 for 30 years you should be paying to the bank at RM 427.18 per month. With RM100 maintenance fee, you should already be saving RM 72.82 per month and just imagine if you compound this in a unit trust earning 15% per annum, how much you’ll make in\n\n18\n\n3 years time. Let’s not forget assuming that house prices increase by nearly 20% per annum. If you sell this apartment in 3 years time now valued at RM 129,600 after deducting the principle installments you’ve paid per month, you would’ve made a clean RM 64,600 by just deciding to buy a house instead of renting. If it’s your first house, there is no capital gains tax. I’ll explain later on how to use your EPF funds to also profit from this. But for now let’s assume your monthly accommodation cost with cukai pintu will cost you about RM 550 per month. 2. Transport Well… for financial freedom in 3 years time get a Proton and a used car if possible. A 3 year old Proton Iswara 1.3 Aeroback cost just RM 24,559. Your monthly would be just RM 313.44 per month. Add in your annual insurance of RM 600 which works out to RM 50 per month. Also, add in your car maintenance cost of RM 400 per year which works out to RM33.33 per month. So everything all added up works out to RM 400 per month. Of course you can get a motorbike, but still a car is still a necessity for groceries etc2, something you cannot live without these days. 3. Petrol Let’s allocate RM 160 per month for this. Again, plan your journey and use Bonuslink/Real Rewards everytime. You may also want to go to work on a motorbike and to use your car only for groceries or others. Up to you! You can save more on this. 4. Food & Groceries Again, buy bulk at Tesco/Giant or why not try the Tesco/Giant brand once in a while. Get a big trunk, allocate a store room at your house and get a big fridge. This expense also includes your gas cost and more. Also we’ll include other costs such as tooth paste, soaps, etc2 into this cost. You may one day try going out to the pasar and Tesco and start taking all the prices down and know exactly how much you need in a month. If you eat in and carry a lunch bag to work daily, let’s assume a budget of RM 180 per month on this. This can be adjusted according to your needs. Don’t eat out. Take breakfast at home and bring a lunch bag to work. This will cover your children’s expenses as well. Work out every single item you buy monthly. For example : Purchase Every Two Weeks (For consumption of a couple and 1 child) No. Item 1. 2 Chicken 2. Beef 3. Fish 4. Vegetables 5. Bread Total….\n\nAmount (RM) 10.00 10.00 15.00 10.00 3.00 …….\n\nPurchase Every Month (For consumption of a couple and 1 child) No. Item 1. Rice 20kg 2. Onions and other herbs 3. Dishwasher 4. Dynamo 5. Bathing Liquid and Colgate Total….\n\nAmount (RM) 15.00 10.00 8.00 10.00 15.00 ……\n\nFIGURE 1.6\n\nITEMISE YOUR GROCERY ITEMS\n\n19\n\nAlso, before going to Tesco/Giant, set out your budget from your list of items to purchase. You can use this as a control to check against any errors at the counter. Then, double check your receipt again before going back home. 5. Handphone Charges Something you cannot live without these days. Use prepaid and sms a lot. Let others call you instead. Get an IDD calling card if you want to call long distance or have a long chat with friends. Try to just meet up with friends rather than calling. Make house visits more often. Let’s assume a monthly expense of RM 30 per month. 6. Telekom Fixed Line Charges You need this for emergencies. Pay the fixed rental of RM 27.30 per month. Again use cheap calling cards if you need to call long distance. Allocate RM 30.00 per month. 7.\n\nTNB – Electricity Try going with electricity for one day and you’d be crazy without it. Pay RM 25 per month for this. Avoid using air conditioning and always try to save your energy bills.\n\n8.\n\nWater & Sewerage Allocate RM 30 per month for this. You can’t live without it.\n\n9.\n\nInternet Access - Broadband As I said earlier just get it. Don’t think twice. This will be your money making machine and will help you to get that retirement much earlier than you imagined. Cost is RM 66 per month with Tmnet Streamyx. It’s that important that please find a house in an area that can have this installed.\n\nThat’s all you’ll need to spend to be alive and start making money. Now let’s list them all down and analyze them in more detail. No. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9.\n\nExpense Category Accomodation Transport Petrol Food and Groceries Handphone Charges Telekom Fixed Line Charges TNB – Electricity Water and Sewerage Internet Access – Broadband Total Necessities\n\nFIGURE 1.7\n\nAmount per month (RM) 550.00 400.00 160.00 180.00 30.00 30.00 25.00 30.00 66.00 1,471.00\n\n% of Spend 37% 27% 11% 12% 2% 2% 2% 2% 4% 100%\n\nYOUR NECESSITY EXPENSES\n\nFrom above, let’s work out further below to the other additional expenses you will have :-\n\n20\n\nNo. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6.\n\nExpense Category Total Necessities Savings (assume RM 10 a day rule) Insurance and medical Leisure and Entertainment Charity Business Expenses for Skill 5 : Make It Total Necessities\n\nFIGURE 1.8\n\nAmount per month (RM) 1,471.00 300.00 80.00 100.00 50.00 100.00 2,101.00\n\n% of Spend 70% 14% 4% 5% 2% 5% 100%\n\nYOUR OVERALL EXPENSES\n\n10. Savings As discussed in the previous Chapter, set a target for savings on a 10 day rule. This is the expense you will try to increase more if you get that pay raise. Everything else should be maintained while you increase this further not decrease it. 11. Insurance and medical This consist of your life insurance or medical insurance to cover you in case anything out of the ordinary happens. Search for the best premiums you can get. 12. Leisure and Entertainment You can try to control this. But this is still an important portion of your expenses. You still need this. Perhaps a movie a month would be sufficient or buy a DVD a month. Also, your holidays etc2. Limit your entertainment expenses to a certain amount. 13. Charity Don’t forget to give! Your mosque, your church, temple, the needy etc2…. 14. Business Expenses You’ll learn that you need to allocate some money in order to make more other than your day job salary. For example, buying this manual is one example. Step 2 : Organise Your Expenses Setting up a filing system is simple. Just get 14 manila folders and number them 1 to 14. At the end of the day, quickly file your categorized expenses. At the end of the month, balance your accounts, list all your expenses and your revenue. That’ll leave you with your surplus money. Step 3 : Compare and Improve After each month compare your actual expenses against your budgeted expenses and see where the gaps are and improve on weaknesses in your spend. Step 4 : Expense Target So with that, your current job must at least give you a monthly salary after taxes and EPF of RM 2,100 per month. If you cannot reach this together with your bonuses you can either cut some of the expenses like leisure or transport down. But please don’t cut your savings. That should be your priority number one in your spending plan. If you still can’t, then try to move to another job that can pay you to sustain that. I’ll talk more about short term job requirement and security in the next chapter.\n\n21\n\nAgain, if you are currently earning more than RM2,100 per month or perhaps far more, than allocate the extras into savings until you achieve your financial freedom in 3 years time. By that time you can perhaps start increasing your luxuries but always sustaining lifetime financial freedom in the process. Also please do not try to utilize Skill 5 : Make It to just meet the RM 2,100 per month expense target. Your day job must be able to cover your overall expense. All the money making methods I’ll show you later should be on top of this. If you follow this closely you will get that retirement in 3 years time. You may think it’s almost impossible with your education background to get a RM 2,100 per month from a day job. Well, I can easily give you an example, a clerk in a KL private firm can earn as much as RM 1,600.00 per month with 2 months bonus. That’s about RM 1,900 per month. If you adjust a bit on your expenses, you could easily meet that. If you combine with your spouse’s income, this target is can be easily achieved. Furthermore, remember that those earning RM 2,500 and below are not taxable. Again, if you’re earning way more, than you have nothing to worry about. Step 5 : Use Credit Cards Yes, I earlier said throw your credit cards away and leave only one somewhere safe. But there are so many advantages of using credit cards to achieve your financial freedom and as a utility for you as well. Only problem is people misuse this facility and either use it to overspend beyond their means or being late in their payments and get charged late fees for no reason. I say make use of credit cards but make sure you pay the full amount every time and don’t procrastinate to the last minute. Pay your bills as soon as you get the statement so that you are sure to pay them. Make also a post dated check to make sure you pay not too early but just in time before it’s due date. This way you’ll earn some interest on your savings/current accounts. You need discipline to the extreme when using credit cards. Keep it in a safe vault somewhere, after you’ve planned your purchase, take it out and use it than keep it into the safe vault again. Don’t leave your credit card in your wallet. Also, don’t use your credit card when someone wants to charge 3% to you for using it. It’s actually against the law, and simply just ignore them. Here are the advantages of using credit cards : 1. Earn points Everytime you use your credit card, you’ll earn points on them. The points is the same of the ringgit amount you spend. So for example, you buy your groceries every month worth RM 180 using your credit card. You’ll get 180 points already. Your petrol budget is RM 160 a month, that’s 160 points already. Your TNB bills, Telekom bills, Insurance premium, Handphone bills and more all get points everytime. For example, monthly you get 571 points. In a year you should be getting 6,852 points just for choosing your credit card instead of paying cash. Normally, annual fees are free for the 1st year. So you can actually use the points you gained for fee waiver. For example, for HSBC credit card, you get a fee waiver for 7,000 points. That means now if you collected anything above that you’ll get some more things in return. If you used your card to purchase furniture etc2, you might get the chance to go on holidays with the points. For example, 11,000 points can get you a RM 50 voucher at MPH Bookstores. That’s like free money already! So make sure you use it everytime you spend.\n\n22\n\n2. For Budget Tracking Keep all your statements and try to balance your receipts with your statements everytime. You can also track your expenses online these days. So you won’t get lost to your current standing in the middle of the month. 3. For online business To purchase web hosting, domain names, memberships you’ll need a credit card for your online businesses. 4. Take advantage of interest on your savings/checking accounts A lot of people don’t realize this. If you delay payment, you’ll earn some interest on your spend. For example, let’s say all your money is currently in your ASB account. You decide to buy furniture worth RM2,000 that month. You use your credit card on the 17th of March. The bill comes only on 11th of April and due date is 31st of April. So your money in ASB with 10% pa dividend will earn you an extra RM17 free money. That RM17 invested into high risk unit trust might earn you RM1 million one day! You’ll make a huge saving there plus you get points on top of that. So insist on using your card if possible. But make sure you pay on time or you get charged late payment and this defeats the entire idea of savings all together. Step 6 : Use Online Payment Facilities To pay your expenses and bills, utlize fully payments via online. You can use the bill payment facility in Maybank2u but better use your credit card instead to pay for savings and points as explained above. To pay your TNB, Telekom, Tmnet, Astro bills using credit card go to http://www.payonline.com.my. Make sure you print out the email receipts and file this. You can straight away go to your credit card website to check out whether payments have been captured by your credit card. For HSBC credit cards go to http://www.hsbc.com.my. You can also use Maybank credit cards. Check your statement in http://maybank2u.com.my. You can also check your latest statements all here. If you use Maybank HomeLoan, you can use Maybank2u to track your housing loan payments online. Charge your insurance to your credit card and track payments online. Rebates are also normally given for payments if you made them autopaid online like TNB and Telekom. Take up all these for the savings you can gain. There are other online bill payment facilities like http://www/billcentre.com. Make use all of them. Pay for petrol using credit cards and use bonuslink for points. Track your points at http://www.bonuslink.com.my. Your points will get you things here. You’ll save time and petrol and this can be considered already a savings. Step 7 : Furniture & Electrical Appliances We’ve so far been talking about monthly expenses but what about money to spend on your furniture and electrical appliances like washing machine and refrigerator. If you already have all these home necessities than skip this step else continue. Number one rule don’t take up a personal loan to buy off all these items. Pay them as you can afford them using Skill 5 : Make It. For first time home buyers who are just starting out, installing home appliances can be a huge sum to pay. Most of you will end up using your credit cards or taking up personal loans to pay off everything monthly with interest on it. So why not simply pay off everything with cash (actually try use credit cards and pay them before due date) since you need this but delay buying them until you have the cash. If you’ve saved a lot of money previously, than congratulations you’ve solved your problem. But if you have almost nothing and about to move into a new home, there will be a problem there. So let’s figure how to solve the problem if you just moved into a new house and\n\n23\n\nyou have not a single sen in your savings to pay for the appliances. Since you’re just starting off, start small first. Let’s go one by one by sequence of importance : 1. Window and door grill - this looks like a necessity these days. If you’re staying in a 3 bed apartment, should cost you about RM 500 to have them installed. Plus, you have security so you don’t have to go overboard with this. 2. Lighting and fan - don’t go overboard. Just install the necessary. Allocate RM 200 for this. 3. Kitchen cabinet with gas stove - Buy a mobile kitchen with a stove from Tesco. Overall will cost you RM 200. 4. Washing machine - Cheap one cost just RM 200 non automatic. 5. Refrigerator - Cost about RM 600. 6. Living room set - Buy the cheap set of RM 600 where you’ll get the TV cabinet, 2+3 sofa and a coffee table. In fact you might not need this yet, until you make money via my methods. 7. Bedroom set - There’s one bedroom set that will cost you just RM 800. 8. Office room set - Quite important, because you need this in order to operate your businesses etc2. Buy a set at Macro would cost you around RM300 that comes with a study table, study chair, cabinets for filing and a computer table. If you’re starting off, you can move into a 3 bedroom apartment fully complete for just RM 2,800. You don’t have to pay all these in one go. You can slowly work on these. As time goes by and you start making money from the businesses I teach you here, you may want to upgrade a little. Perhaps you can now afford to install a real kitchen cabinet. Or change to a bigger refrigerator or get an auto washing machine. Now that you’ve analysed your expenses and startup cost for your furniture, electrical appliances, computers and more, you’ll definitely need a day job to cover all these in the short term. Let’s move on to the next chapter to cover this.\n\n24\n\nCHAPTER 5 Short Term Job Requirement Whatever you think, getting a job is the most important thing to start things off with. But do not treat your job as the final solution. Your job is simply a temporary solution for you to meet the end. Your end game is the goal to achieve full financial freedom and retire in free with nobody to report to and no worries about meeting your next months installments etc2. Treat career development as a training opportunity for you. History of Employment/Jobs Nobody knows exactly how jobs or employment got started. But I have a theory and I’m sure you’ll agree with me. In the past, man used to collect food and hunt on their own. Then they started to discover farming and fishing. Then someone who was much stronger and powerful decided they’ll provide protection for the weaker in exchange for them serving the master. As times goes by the stronger gets more stronger while the weaker gets more comfortable and start to forget that he doesn’t really need that protection. So the system evolves to a more modern version today. You feel comfortable having a job security and if possible don’t want the hassle or risk of obtaining your financial freedom and therefore sleep for the rest of your lives. I’m not saying you are weak for having to go to work for someone or they are exploiting you. It works both ways you need them for now, they need you because you’re willing to follow their system. Therefore, your strategy is to temporarily work with the system but fully concentrating your efforts to achieve FULL FREEDOM as your set target time. Let me explain the benefits of having a DAY JOB. 1.\n\nDAY JOB pays the bills Your day job pays all the necessity expenses for now until you achieve your goals.\n\n2.\n\nDAY JOB qualifies you for a loan You need a day job to get your J Form and EA Form in order. This way you can easily get your housing and car loans. All this helps you achieve your target.\n\n3.\n\nDAY JOB helps build up your savings for investment You can start with the 10 ringgit savings a day rule with your day job.\n\n4.\n\nDAY JOB provides training A day job should provide you with all the computer skills, office skills, negotiation skills, organization skills, filing skills, people skills, communication skills and more. Make use of all the development the company provides to you. Try to also learn how your company operates as this will help in your own businesses.\n\n5.\n\nDAY JOB instill self discipline You’ll have to wake up early and follow the 8-5 schedule every day. This give you some sense of consistency in your life.\n\n6.\n\nDAY JOB builds up your EPF/KWSP Yeah, you would think that my idea is to keep all the amount in EPF until you’re 55 years old and enjoy all your savings for the next 30 years with 4.5% compound interest and you’re okay. While you can simply squander your day job salary on big cars and big homes. Well, this manual is teaching about you being financially free in 3 years time.\n\n25\n\nUsing this powerful tool call EPF, I will teach you how. That is for now, unless the government decides to change anything. So keep up to date with the latest laws on your EPF. I’ll explain later in the Chapter 8 on Real Estate the many ways you can use Account 2 of your EPF to get your home. But for now let me explain the basics of EPF or KWSP because I know many out there don’t know exactly how it all works. The law can change anytime, whatever I tell you now might no longer be true. So check out their website at http://www.kwsp.gov.my What is Employee Provident Fund (EPF)? It is a forced saving scheme by the government for private sector employees so that you and I can have a lump sum nest egg or a big sum of money at our retirement age, ie. in Malaysia’s case it’s 55 years old… for now! It is grand scheme indeed and I fully support it for your retirement age. But there are some loopholes in there where you can fully make use of for your early retirement. How it works? Every month your employer is suppose to deduct 9% of your salary into EPF. So for example, if your salary is RM 3,000 per month. Every month RM 270 is deducted into your EPF. And if your bonus is two months salary then from your bonus of RM 6,000, RM 540 is deducted into your EPF. This deduction is tax free up to the amount of RM5,000 per year. Then your employer is suppose to top up another 12% salary into your EPF. Therefore, if your salary is RM3,000 per month, your employer will need to provide RM 360 per month into your EPF by law. On top of this, your employer might decide to add another percentage over this into your EPF. Some employer can go as high as 5%. However, let’s assume your employer decides to add another 3% into your EPF, from a salary of RM3,000 per month that should be another RM90 per month. So in summary it would look like below :Assume your monthly salary is RM3,000 No. 1. 2. 3.\n\nDetails Your salary of 9% is deducted from your salary Employer top up required by government of 12% Employer provides additional 3% (not required by government) Total per month going to your EPF\n\nFIGURE 1.9\n\nAmount (RM) 270 360 90 720\n\nYOUR MONTHLY EPF CONTRIBUTION\n\nSo every month RM 720 is going to your EPF. You also get a dividend of 4.5% pa* over this. (*Dividend changes from year to year) Let’s see what happens in a year with an assumption that your salary is RM3,000 per month with a dividend of 4.5% per annum. Also assume you’re getting a two months bonus at the end of the year ie. in December.\n\n26\n\nMonth\n\nTotal EPF amount per month (RM) 720 720 720 720 720 720 720 720 720 720 720 2,160 10,080.00\n\nJAN FEB MAR APR MAY JUN JUL AUG SEP OCT NOV DEC Total FIGURE 2.0\n\nDividends (RM) 29.70 27.00 24.30 21.60 18.90 16.20 13.50 10.80 8.10 5.40 2.70 178.20\n\nYOUR ANNUAL EPF CONTRIBUTION\n\nSo at the end of the year you should be getting RM 10,080.00 plus RM 178.20 of RM 10,258.20. Make sure you track exactly whether your employer is contributing correctly into your EPF. Many employers have been known to be quite slow with this. The employer can get fined or even a jail sentence for not complying to the law regarding this. So you go to your nearest EPF to check your balances. But thanks to the wonders of Internet, you can now check your balance online at http://www.kwsp.gov.my. Register yourself and get a userid and password for this. So every month while doing your bills, you can just have a quick look whether your EPF has been contributed on time, or give your employer a kick in the but. You can tell the Personnel guy horrific stories about employers who go to jail for not contributing to their employees EPF. If they are still not contributing, better just find another job. Okay, now let’s see how much you’ll get in three years. Let’s assume 2004 is Year 1 and 2005 is Year 2 and 2006 is Year 3. Year 1 Month Balance from previous years JAN2004 FEB2004 MAR2004 APR2004 MAY2004 JUN2004 JUL2004 AUG2004 SEP2004 OCT2004 NOV2004 DEC2004 Total\n\nTotal EPF amount per month (RM) 0 720 720 720 720 720 720 720 720 720 720 720 2,160 10,080.00\n\nDividends (RM) 0 29.70 27.00 24.30 21.60 18.90 16.20 13.50 10.80 8.10 5.40 2.70 178.20\n\n27\n\nYear 2 Month Balance from previous years JAN2005 FEB2005 MAR2005 APR2005 MAY2005 JUN2005 JUL2005 AUG2005 SEP2005 OCT2005 NOV2005 DEC2005 Total\n\nTotal EPF amount per month (RM) 10,258.20 720 720 720 720 720 720 720 720 720 720 720 2,160 20,338.20\n\nDividends (RM) 461.62 * 29.70 27.00 24.30 21.60 18.90 16.20 13.50 10.80 8.10 5.40 2.70 639.82\n\n* Dividend earned in 2005 for balance from previous years.\n\nYear 3 Month Balance from previous years JAN2006 FEB2006 MAR2006 APR2006 MAY2006 JUN2006 JUL2006 AUG2006 SEP2006 OCT2006 NOV2006 DEC2006 Total\n\nTotal EPF amount per month (RM) 20,978.02 720 720 720 720 720 720 720 720 720 720 720 2,160 31,058.02\n\nDividends (RM) 944.01 * 29.70 27.00 24.30 21.60 18.90 16.20 13.50 10.80 8.10 5.40 2.70 1,122.21\n\n* Dividend earned in 2006 for balance from previous years. FIGURE 2.1\n\nTHREE YEARS EPF CONTRIBUTION\n\nSo at the end of the third year, your overall balance in EPF is RM 32,180.23. Now this amount will be divided intro Three Accounts as explained below :No. 1. 2. 3.\n\nDetails Your Final Balance in 3rd year Account 1 (60%) Account 2 (30%) * Account 3 (10%)\n\nAmount (RM) 32,180.23 19,308.14 9,654.07 3,218.02\n\n* so the amount of RM 9,654.07 in Account 2 can be taken out to clear/reduce of your housing loan in 3 years time. FIGURE 2.2\n\nALLOCATION OF EPF CONTRIBUTIONS\n\nThis concept will be explained in more detail in the Chapters ahead covering real estate strategies. In summary, you can take out Account 2 amount of RM 9,654.07 to reduce your housing loan before you sell it for cash. The strategy is leave this amount in a unit\n\n28\n\ntrust that can earn you at least 20% dividends than the one offered by EPF. You can also actually take out some amounts from Account 1 and dump into a unit trust. But again, you can only withdraw this amount at retirement age. What we’re teaching in this manual is for you to enjoy your retirement in 3 years time. I won’t spend time explaining what other amounts you can take out. Just go to your local EPF office and ask all the silly questions you want. It’s totally free consulting over there. They have a motto to serve customers there. 7.\n\nDAY JOB builds up your confidence A day job builds up you confidence to take on more riskier ventures like real estate ventures or the stock market or even putting your money into stable unit trusts. You’ll have the security in trying new things like trying to build up a business selling information or a business in reselling items bought on ebay or lelong.com.my. Because by the end of the month you know your nest egg in EPF and your own savings is still growing.\n\n8.\n\nDAY JOB allows you to get to know people Well, you can also get to know people not working but at least you get to see other people during your office hours time and get paid for it too. You get to meet your customers, your suppliers, your colleagues and more. You can start selling them life insurance, unit trust, MLMs and more. Meantime you get to socialize with people while getting paid a monthly salary. You can also learn a lot from your colleagues and people you meet while at job.\n\n9.\n\nDAY JOB allows less complication with LHDN on taxes It will take out all the head-aches dealing with income tax. While building your nest egg and trying to meet your financial freedom, you can start preparing building your tax planning strategies. Plus, filing your previous years income tax helps to train you preparing for your retirement. You can also spend some time just going to your local LHDN office and simply asking all the silly questions to the staff there. ps. If possible don’t visit them in April ie. during their peak months. Go for visits in Octobers perhaps. You’ll be surprised they are quite accommodating actually and can sometimes spend extra effort providing service to you. They’re paid to do that anyway. However, worse comes to worst, you can build up a nest egg later on to just hire a tax planning consultant to help you.\n\n10.\n\nDAY JOB allows get a credit card You need a credit card for your internet business which I will explain more later.\n\nSo enough proving why you need a day job. It’s quite clear already. However, you need not worry too much about increments or bonuses or the office promotions. Because your purpose being there is for the above only. Preparing to get your full financial freedom in 3 years time. You’ll just go to be patient for awhile until then. So enjoy your work and give the best you can give and earn your ringgit working there. Make sure you give value to your employer but don’t expect much from them. Though pay raise and bonuses helps in terms of building your nest egg in savings and EPF, your number one strategy is to build up your outside businesses which will pay you sometimes ten times your salary and are residual income. Your day job salary is just to pay your necessity expenses as in Figure 1.8 of RM 2,100.\n\n29\n\nWhat if your salary cannot meet the above target and you are totally expandable. If the company decides to layoff, you’ll be amongst the first to go. Even if you go out to market, nobody wants you. The trick to this is to create value for the company to hire you. Companies hire employees so that the company can make profits yearly. So each staff has a contribution to make to the bottomline. No company in this world would hire you for no reason whatsoever. It’s always the bottomline that matters. If they start to see you no longer can contribute to their bottom-line, they’ll try to find a way to boot you. Here’s some tip for you to at least improve your salary and make yourself more marketable outside : 1. I assume if you arrived here, you should be good in English. Try to improve further on your English language. Perhaps some speaking courses to improve your pronunciation etc2. 2. Make yourself as skillful as possible. Go to trainings, computer skills training, SAP, Words, Excel, negotiation skills and more. Go to as much as training as you can and always demand a certificate. Go and see HR and your boss and demand for more trainings. 3. If you can’t get enough company training, try going to trainings on your own and demand the certificate. 4. Ask your boss for a pay raise and if cannot ask what needs to be done to get it. 5. Come to work early and don’t go back that early. 6. Attend all meetings. 7. Always put a cheerful face and be enthusiastic about things eventhough you don’t feel like it…pretend! 8. Update yourself, go for a part time diploma or part time degree or part time Masters. Go for another 2nd diploma perhaps. 9. Learn a second language like Mandarin or French. 10. Try to speak up more in meetings eventhough you’ll sound stupid as long as you’re seen you should be okay. 11. Update your resume and ask for friends advise regarding it. Include all your training, diplomas certificates. Send them out just to test the market. 12. Make yourself more presentable, looks, hair, dress and more. 13. Make friends with head hunters and recruitment agencies. 14. Read the classifieds everyday eventhough you’re not really looking. 15. Even if you’re not really looking, go for interviews to train yourself. I’ve explained why you need a day job, but wouldn’t it be okay if I worked all my life and get those annual increments and bonuses and my EPF might be worth 1 million ringgit someday when I’m 55 years old basing on the compound interest. If you bought this manual, obviously you must really believe that you want financial freedom fast. Just in case you start believing a DAY JOB is good from my points above, here’s why you can’t rely on a day job security : 1. DAY JOB is bad because LIFE IS NOT FAIR Life is simply not fair, if you leave your future on other people’s hands then something might happen. If everything is always fine, then they wouldn’t be having a HR dept with lots of people just to deal with you wouldn’t they? 2. DAY JOB is bad because COMPANIES GO BANKRUPT EVERYDAY If you rely on a company for your whole life, just imagine what would happen if your companies go under. In this day of globalization, companies whether they are Fortune 500 or just your crony backed company like Renong can simply collapse overnight. The easiest examples being Enron and Arthur Anderson. Arthur Anderson used to be the most prestigious accounting firm in the world with nearly 100 years of experience. Who would’ve imagined they’ll fold up that quick and start laying off their employees overnight. Just imagine your in\n\n30\n\nthe finance department of Enron and get laid off. Would any company in their right mind hire you? Eventhough it’s nothing to do with you. It’s just that. It will take you sometimes 6 months to 1 year to get rehired back into the system. What if you’re so specialized that nobody in the industry would hire you. Then, you’ll need to go back to school and learn some new skill to get hired right from the bottom. What if your house and car currently eats up your salary by almost half as they normally do. Your savings can just last you another 6 months. That’s when you start selling your home and car at dirt cheap prices. That is why making money from real estate is one of the best ways to make an easy buck because they’re always unlucky buggers like you wondering this earth. My brother last time was an overseas graduate in Computer Engineering and got laid, took him nearly 8 months to find a job and that was because he knew the chap who was to be his employer. 3. DAY JOB is bad because GLOBALISATION CUTS JOBS EVERYWHERE Companies move location almost everyday. One day they’re in country. Then when costs start rising, in order to compete they’ll move elsewhere. Malaysia is an example. In the late 80’ many companies like Motorola, Panasonic and others decided to locate to Malaysia because of the low wages here. Then after 10 years they started realizing they can make more margin by moving to China or Vietnam, within months all their employees were offered VSS and then they moved on. Not only from the point of relocating but also globalization make certain jobs more productive therefore, they need to cut off staff. Many companies who were also previously very decentralized are centralizing with 1 job covering 4 or 5 countries whereas the 4 were either laid off or moved to some other job until being laid off. 4. DAY JOB is bad because of OFFICE POLITICS Politics exist everywhere. Just because your colleague has a higher need to cover their expense you become the victim. Or because the system doesn’t allow you to be seen, you’re seen as though unproductive eventhough you meet your job targets or even exceed them and provide the value to the company but certain people are using that for their own interest. 5. DAY JOB is bad because of PEOPLE’S GREED Let’s face it people are greedy. Therefore, the system is not perfect. Eventhough you may try to do your job, but if someone else wants to meet their own targets they’ll make use of you. One good example is, your boss needs your support technically in his or her department. However, there is another opening somewhere in the organization for a managerial position. Your boss needs you, so he’ll make sure your promotion is slow or will not recommend you until his or her needs are met first. You complain to HR, who will the HR hear first you or your boss? This is typical anywhere! 6. DAY JOB is bad because BOSSES CHANGE One day you’re doing just right, next day you’re the worst performer in the company. Things can turnaround really fast. 7. DAY JOB is bad because IF YOU GO SICK, THEY’LL KICK YOU OUT! Let’s face it, if you start falling sick or you start having family problems. They’ll start creating something for you to leave the company. A company is there to make profits, they can’t afford to have someone sick in the workforce. 8. DAY JOB is bad because YOU HAVE TO WAKE UP EARLY! On some days you simply don’t have the mood to work and would be far more productive working on another day. But you’ll still just need to show up for the sake of it. So on some\n\n31\n\ndays you’re basically not doing a thing at work. Some days you’re too busy to even talk to anyone. The system simply cannot recognize when you are productive or not. 9. DAY JOB is bad because YOU ARE NOT DOING WHAT YOU ARE GOOD AT Most people are doing jobs they don’t really like. A lot of people work simply for being in a company because of the name and security it provides. Or simply just of the money or their benefits. 10. DAY JOB is bad because of the NEED TO REDUCE COST EVERY YEAR Just imagine, companies every year want growth in profits or revenues. While cost are rising every year ie. employment costs, inflation, production costs and etc2, the company is targeting to reduce cost by at 5% every year so that profits rise 10% yearly. They’ll start working up some mambo jambo management approach and cut people, combine jobs and force people to do more than what is possible. Sooner or later you’re bound to get laid off at this rate. 11. DAY JOB is bad because of BUREACRACY AND INFLATION If you’re a government employee than you have nothing to worry about with regards to layoffs and retrenchments. But you have the bureaucracy to deal with regarding promotions, pay rise etc2. And imagine this, inflation has been going up every year while a government officer never gets a pay raise or a limited one at that. Just imagine if you’re a school teacher, at the start of your pay at 20 years old you would get around RM 1,000 per month salary. By the time you retire at 55 years old, your salary would reach at most RM2,500 per month. That’s a 50% increase. Inflation is about on average 2% - 4% per year. Let’s assume an inflation of 4% per annum due to other cost increase such as car, house, petrol and more. So assume your expenses per month at the beginning of your career is RM 900. If you normalize that, at the end of your career your expenses should already be valued at RM 3,551. That’s RM 1,051 more from your salary during retirement. Assume you paid off your house and car of RM900. That’s still not enough to cover your expenses. So have you seen the enormity of the problem being in employment for life. After your retirement age, your pension is half your salary at RM 1,250 per month. To sustain your necessity expenses of RM 2,651 per month, you’ll need to work again after 55 years old to get a salary at least RM 1,401per month until you die!! But you may ask me, since you’ve shown me exactly how to make money part time, why not I stick to my day job and continue making money part time until I retire at 55 years old. What I’m saying is you can retire in 3 years time and concentrate on what you love most in your life and can allocate more time to better work on the money making machines I’ll show you later. So the 9am to 5pm daily you can actually 100% concentrate to make way more money than you can ever get from your day job. You might be making more money than your company CEO! No worries about layoffs, company profits, globalization (in fact globalization is good for you) or even the economy because the financial freedom I’ll teach you should shield you against fluctuations of the economy. Need I say more? Then again, I might be preaching to the converted. So continue your efforts going through this manual. Let’s move on to the most important chapter in this Manual… Setting the stage to your early retirement.\n\n32\n\nCHAPTER 6 The Financial Freedom Goal : Setting the Stage The only way to ensure 100% guaranteed FULL FINANCIAL FREEDOM is via CAPITAL INVESTMENT. A lot has been said about residual income and making money from your home as a means of FINANCIAL FREEDOM. But I believe that having CAPITAL and being an investor as the only way to achieving financial freedom. You may tell me but I don’t have capital and even if I work for the rest of my life I still wouldn’t have that much capital to sustain me to eternity. Besides isn’t being able to make money from home or earning residual income from network marketing is having financial freedom. Well, put it this way if you fall sick in a month, you will stop earning income. What if your network marketing company goes bust, what’s going to happen to your income. Just like big corporations like Enron and Arthur Anderson, MLM companies can disappear over night. I believe you must make money via all these mechanisms to BUILD enough CAPITAL so as to sustain you till death! So the objective of this manual is really to learn to save and make money to build a huge sum of CAPITAL so that you become an investor that can sustain you to eternity. But are there instruments in Malaysia that can give a stable and safe returns that can sustain your monthly expenses forever. I will show you a few and make comparisons between them. Some of them might be suited for others and some may not. For Bumi’s they are many safe instruments such as ASB and Bank Rakyat. For non-bumi’s they are the unit trusts and others. Method of achieving financial freedom consist of THREE basic steps. They are : 1. STEP 1 : SUSTAINING YOUR FINANCIAL FREEDOM WITH CAPITAL. 2. STEP 2 : IDENTIFYING YOUR IDEAL RETIREMENT EXPENSE. 3. STEP 3 : HOW TO ACHIEVE YOUR FINANCIAL FREEDOM IN 3 YEARS. Looks so easy. Let’s go step by step : STEP 1 : SUSTAINING YOUR FINANCIAL FREEDOM WITH CAPITAL. 1. SUSTAINABLE TOOL 1 : AMANAH SAHAM BUMIPUTERA (BUMI ONLY) Provides you with security of your money up to RM 200,000. Returns between 9%-12% pa. On average 10% pa. If you have RM200,000 invested, and your monthly expenses comes to RM 1,500 per month… you should be set for life! Check out Attachment 7.1 for example of calculations. 2. SUSTAINABLE TOOL 2 : MEDIUM TO LOW RISK UNIT TRUSTS (ANYBODY) There are many in the market. Your money is invested in combination of long term stocks and fixed income securities such as bonds. Capital is unlimited with returns between 9%-20% pa. Let’s assume 10% pa. With RM 200,000 invested, and your monthly expenses comes to RM 1,500 per month… you should be set for life! Exactly the same as Attachment 7.1 for example of calculations. 3. SUSTAINABLE TOOL 3 : KOPERASI BANK RAKYAT (BUMI ONLY) Gives 15% pa returns. Limited to RM 100,000 only. Can only withdraw in 3 - 6 months time. If you withdraw every 6 months and put into another tool like ASB, you should be set for life. If you have RM 130,000 (couple combined) invested and withdrawn every six months to be put into ASB and your monthly expenses is RM 1,500 per month… you should be set for life!\n\n33\n\n4. SUSTAINABLE TOOL 4 : LOW RISK FIXED INCOME SECURITIES (ANYBODY) 100% fixed income securities like bonds, money market etc2, can provide returns of between 5%-6% pa. Let’s assume 6% pa returns. Capital is unlimited and very liquid. With capital of RM 310,000 invested and and your monthly expenses is RM 1,500 per month… you should be set for life! 5. SUSTAINABLE TOOL 5 : BANK FIXED DEPOSITS (ANYBODY) Bank’s fixed deposits can provide returns of around 4.5% pa. Capital is unlimited and very liquid. With capital of RM 410,000 put into fixed deposits and and your monthly expenses is RM 1,500 per month… you should be set for life! 6. SUSTAINABLE TOOL 5 : REAL ESTATE (ANYBODY) This is more of the money making machine rather the sustainable tool. But it can work that way too and a really good one at that. Let’s not talk about using financing to buy the houses for now. Let’s assume you have accumulated cash of RM 300,000. Because you have instant cash, you can negotiate good deals and obtain 2 storey terrace houses in Puchong worth RM 150,000 each (let’s assume all in with legal fees and renovations). You can collect rentals for RM900 for each house. So that’s RM 1,800 per month to cover your expenses forever! The best thing is your RM 300,000 is increasing in value. So if you sell these two in 5 years time, the house might have doubled in value already. But again, you’ll need to deal with problems of collecting rent and all the bathroom leaks etc2. Also, rental is actually taxable, but you can always charge expenses of maintaining the house to the rentals. Another thing is your money will not be liquid, so if you have emergencies you’ll get stuck. So you can make it like your second sustainable tool. The first one can be sustainable tool 1 perhaps.You might put RM 150k in real estate and another RM 150k in ASB/unit trusts. We’ll discuss about real estate in the later chapter more. The above are perhaps the most common and simplest sustainable tools around in Malaysia. Of course you can have combinations of these. You can mix them just like I did for the real estate tool I explained above. For example, you may want to mix your risks with combinations of tools, you might want to put for example RM50k into risky unit trusts that might give you up to 25% pa returns and put the rest of RM110k into fixed income securities of returns around 7% pa. So basically with this combination and your expenses of RM1,500 per month, you should be okay for life provided the riskier unit trust can continue it’s performance.\n\n34\n\nAttachment 7.1 Calculations for Sustainable Tool 1 No. Month\n\n1 Jan-05\n\nBalance b/f in ASB (RM)\n\nFeb-05\n\n3 Mar-05\n\n4 Apr-05\n\n5 May-05\n\n6 Jun-05\n\n7 Jul-05\n\n8 Aug-05\n\n9 Sept-05\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\nOct-05\n\nNov-05\n\nDec-05\n\nJan-06\n\n200,000\n\n198,500\n\n197,000\n\n195,500\n\n194,000\n\n192,500\n\n191,000\n\n189,500\n\n188,000\n\n186,500\n\n185,000\n\n183,500\n\n1,500\n\n1,500\n\n1,500\n\n1,500\n\n1,500\n\n1,500\n\n1,500\n\n1,500\n\n1,500\n\n1,500\n\n1,500\n\n1,500\n\n198,500\n\n197,000\n\n195,500\n\n194,000\n\n192,500\n\n191,000\n\n189,500\n\n188,000\n\n186,500\n\n185,000\n\n183,500\n\n201,025\n\n1,654.17\n\n1,641.67\n\n1,629.17\n\n1,616.67\n\n1,604.17\n\n1,591.67\n\n1,579.17\n\n1,566.67\n\n1,554.17\n\n1,541.67\n\n1,529.17\n\n1,516.67\n\nExpenses per month (RM) Balance c/f in ASB (RM) Dividend earned per month (RM)\n\n2\n\nStarting Capital at Year 1 Expenses per month Dividend per annum Total Dividend per year Average Dividends per month\n\n: : : :\n\nRM 200,000.00 RM 1,500.00 10% per annum RM 19,025.00 RM 1,585.42\n\nCapital Position at Year 2 Capital Position at Year 3 Capital Position at Year 4\n\n: : :\n\nRM 201,025.00 RM 203,652.50 RM 206,542.75\n\n201,025\n\nRemarks Therefore, if you have a capital of RM 200,000.00 invested in ASB which provides dividends of 10% per annum at the end of the year and you withdraw your monthly expenses of RM 1,500.00 every month from ASB, your capital will remain fixed or appreciates every year. This appreciation of capital will reflect the inflation rates for those years. Assumptions 1. Dividend is assumed at 10% per annum, however based on historical data it has been fluctuating from one year to another. The way to solve this is to combine your investments in many tools to diversify your risks accordingly. 2. Your monthly expenses is assumed fixed at RM 1,500 per month. You will need the discipline to withdraw this amount at the bank at the beginning of the month just like taking your salary.

In Chapter 4, we discussed in detail what your current expenses are and what your current targeted expenses should be. If you can see from Step 1 above, I chose RM 1,500 per month as the retirement expense target for financial freedom. I simply used the total necessities of RM 1,471 per month from Figure 1.7 from Chapter 4. Basically, it’s saying that with RM 200,000 you will be able to pay all your monthly necessities of RM 1,500. But perhaps you disagree with me, you would want more money allocated as your monthly retirement expense due to many reasons of your own. But’s let’s assume now for argument sake that RM 2,000 will be able to pay all your expenses if you are not working or having a day job. I’m saying you will continue working on your money making machine as I will explain in the later Chapters, but RM 2,000 is the amount of money that will be able to sustain you even if you sleep, eat and watch TV all day long! This will give you the total freedom to be active and make way more money on your own. FULL PROOF EXPENSE TARGET You might be worried in case the economy starts slowing down or interest rates start shooting up and your home loan start to bubble or your groceries start to go up or you suddenly fall sick and need a lot of medical expenses or fuel price goes up or ringgit starts to depreciate again or your car starts to break down or your children need to go to university or any other uncertainties that may happen once you retire. Work out a full proof expenses target that will fully cover all angles in the future. For example, take a loan or refinance your home to a fixed interest rate loan. If you take a housing loan, your house will be fully covered in case of fire or whatever by your MRTA. Buy a car at most 3 years old and do proper maintenance. Switch cars every 3 years. Buy brand new if it helps! Groceries should go up according to our official government inflation rate between 1% to 2% per year. Besides most items that we need most are controlled by the government anyway. Your luxuries may increase but prices for things like CDs, co"
