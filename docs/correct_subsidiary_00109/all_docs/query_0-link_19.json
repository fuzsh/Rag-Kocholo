It Is How Time Forces Us To Move Forward\n\nFake Information On The Internet. It All Goes Down To How We Perceive Them\n\nDecentralized, The Internet Should Not Be Controlled By Companies Or The Governments\n\nPeople Share Everything On The Web. This Is Because We Love Free Things\n\nNot Doing Something New Seems Like a Crime\n\nAccess to the Internet Should be Regarded as a Basic Human Right\n\nThe Web is Better If You Let Websites Personalize it for You\n\nAdvertising is the Original Sin of the Web\n\n\"The Web We Want\" and Magna Carta for the Internet"
