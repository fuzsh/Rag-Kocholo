        "text": "Tony Hsieh in \"Delivering Happiness\", exposes to us the sense of success experienced by him and all employees of Zappos, where he is CEO. Amazon e-commerce had just bought the company for about $1 billion, the largest acquisition in Amazon's history.\n\nThe author recalls that in 1998, the company he co-founded, LinkExchange, was sold to nothing less than Microsoft for $265 million after 2 and a half years of history.\n\nIt may be thought that Tony has always chosen the right business choices and was far from wrong, but his path has been trailed by failure and learning. Want to know how Tony Hsieh achieved success and became a millionaire with just a few years on the market? Continue reading!\n\nAbout the book \"Delivering Happiness\"\n\nThe book \"Delivering Happiness\" is divided into 3 sections and was first published in 2010. It is a handbook on how to be an entrepreneur who brings happiness to the business.\n\nFor him, the customer should be received in the best way and be positively contaminated by the treatment of the team.\n\nIt is a worldwide sales success for its easy and intimate language.\n\nHe was nominated for the Goodreads Choice Award for Best Non-Fiction.\n\nAbout the author Tony Hsieh\n\nTony Hsieh was the founder of large companies such as LinkExchange and the e-commerce giant, Zappos. com - an online store for general footwear and clothes, in 2009, reached the $1 billion mark in sales, and, as he said, it's a company that \"delivers happiness\".\n\nTony had a degree in Computer Science from Harvard University and gained prominence in the media and became a world reference in customer service due to the excellent service provided by Zappos and the publication of his book Delivering Happiness.\n\nThe author died in November 2020 from injuries caused by a fire in his home in the USA.\n\nTo whom is this book indicated?\n\nEntrepreneurs who want to change the way they relate to their customers and revolutionize buying.\n\nIt is a necessary bestseller for all those who work in commerce or who wish to work with the general public for purchasing or selling products.\n\nMain ideas of the book \"Delivering Happiness\"\n\nTrials and errors are required for the learning process;\n\nRunning after your passion instead of chasing money is what will bring you true happiness;\n\nAct weak when strong and act strong when weak;\n\nIt is good to differentiate yourself from others, being unusual is a quality;\n\nLearn by doing, nothing replaces practical experience, although theory is extremely necessary;\n\nBuilding a network of friends is much richer than having many business acquaintances.\n\nDownload the \"Delivering Happiness\" Book Summary in PDF for free\n\nDo you have no time to read now? Then download the free PDF and read wherever and whenever you want:\n\nOverview: First steps\n\nTony Hsieh's entrepreneurial story began with an unusual birthday wish he made to his parents as a child: an earthworm with about a thousand worms. I had the idea of selling them and profiting from it, but of course, it didn't work out.\n\nAfter spending a hard childhood with his parents, who forced him to study hard and practice music, sports, and other activities exhaustively, Hsieh went to college and, in addition to having to meet Harvard's requirements, was able to focus on his own interests (finally).\n\nAs he was very easy with technology and this was a booming area at the time, he joined a dorm roommate from the University and together decided to participate in interviews with technology companies.\n\nBoth his friend and he received offers from Oracle (a multinational technology and computer company specializing in hardware, software and database development). A great job for college graduates.\n\nHe says in \"Delivering Happiness\" that despite the achievement, time went on showing that it was not what the two really wanted. So, they decided to start a business of their own: create websites for companies. They set it as a next step to resign from Oracle and pursue their convictions. They thought they had risked too much, but it was already done.\n\nOverview: The search for gold\n\nUnfortunately for the two friends, the idea did not go much further. They were thrilled with the notion of owning and running a business of their own, but the reality ended up disenchanting the fantasy and it was getting harder and harder to capture new customers.\n\nThey sought to come up with a new idea for an internet business, and eventually formulated it after a while. The big LinkExchange, which came out of the idea of Hsieh and his friend, was a way for sites that couldn't afford advertising to get free advertising. The idea was successful.\n\nAfter five months of operation he goes to say in \"Delivering Happiness\", that they received an offer to sell LinkExchange for $1 million. They thought how exciting this was, but declined the offer. Believing that the company had the potential to grow much more, and a right assumption indeed.\n\nThey gathered friends and acquaintances to be part of the ever-growing company. Shortly thereafter, it was Yahoo! give the faces with the intention of buying. $20 million was the amount they were willing to pay.\n\nThey decided to dare. They did not accept the offer and relied on advancing the initial idea.\n\nOverview: Fast growth is not synonymous with certain success\n\nThe company expanded, the network of friends ran out, and they began hiring strangers who wanted to join the company. The problem was that many of these people were not there to work as a team, but to make money and build resumes.\n\nThe company's culture began to be overshadowed, and the urge to go to work was no longer the same as it had been for Tony Hsieh. One and a half years later, the company moved from an environment with a team united to one that was now made up of policies and positions.\n\nThere was not a single factor responsible for the deterioration of the company's culture and he was not quite sure how to act. The economy was not doing well and going broke became a concern.\n\nTo everyone's happiness, they built very good relationships with Yahoo!, Netscape, and Microsoft, and that relationship yielded LinkExchange's buying interests. Microsoft offered $265 million, and they accepted, there was no other way out.\n\nOverview: The idea of success\n\nIt all started when Tony Hsieh received audio from a guy named Nick, saying he had just created a website called shoesite. com and wanted to turn it into an Amazon of shoes.\n\nHe wasn't interested at first, but after seeing the data he changed his mind: shoes represented a $40 billion industry in the United States, it was the fastest-growing segment of the industry.\n\nThey decided to stay in touch and shortly afterward the company earned the name Zappos and was already accumulating $2, 000 orders per week. How to refuse such a brilliant idea?\n\nAfter many investments, failures, meetings, and work, Tony and his friends involved in creating Zappos were pleased.\n\nThe company went through many ups and downs, had its headquarters moved from one city to another to improve the logistics of services, and many people joined the team as well as many lefts.\n\nOver the years he shows in \"Delivering Happiness\", Zappos' main growth guideline has been customer recurrence and word of mouth. The company's philosophy was to retain the money that would be spent on advertising and invest it in customer service and customer experience, so they marketed themselves, and that was great in every way.\n\nThere are assistants at the call center 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Zappos' concern with the customer made it take off.\n\nOverview: Achieve happiness\n\nHappiness is usually tied to achieving something, achieving good, or fulfilling desires. But studies show that for many, finally achieving their goal in life would not bring sustainable happiness, yet many people have spent their lives in search of what would make them happy.\n\nTony Hsieh shows us at the end of \"Delivering Happiness\" that there are 3 types of happiness:\n\nPleasure;\n\nPassion;\n\nHigher Purpose.\n\nPleasure and Passion are part of a comfort zone that has the shortest duration, while the Greater Purpose of happiness is related to being part of something larger than itself and meaningful.\n\nFollowing this thought, people should go in search of a Higher Purpose, instead of settling for short spaces where they are happy for pleasure or passion. The author concludes the work with the question:\n\n\"What is your highest purpose?\"\n\nWhat do other authors say about it?\n\n\"From the Ground Up\" is a biography of Howard Schultz that tells how the businessman turned Starbucks into one of the largest franchises in the world. He says his responsibility to Starbucks goes far beyond simply making money. Their intentions are to apply the company's profits in a transformative purpose to its audience in a balanced manner.\n\nLuciana Medeiros's \"Let's Have a Coffee?\" Tells the story of the businesswoman, Maria Luisa, who brought this franchise to Brazil. In the work, she advises: do not hurry; You have to take it one step at a time to avoid running over in the process.\n\nThe owner of Cacau Show, Alexandre Tadeu, in his work \"A Truffle and... 1000 Stores Later!\" Considers passion as the beginning of everything, including in professional life. From a young age, he was convinced that accomplishment at work was fundamental in his pursuit of happiness.\n\nOkay, but how can I apply this to my life?\n\nNow that you are more into the subject matter explored in the book, how about we recap some ideas?\n\nThe work is divided into 3 parts that discuss the author's history and his entrepreneurial journey until he finds himself in his current successful company Zappos. Throughout the book, we find that success depends heavily on willpower, study, and good company.\n\nBeing true to what you do, believing in your ideas, and striving for fulfillment are essential to achieving the glorious outcome.\n\nDid you like this summary of the book \"Delivering Happiness\"?\n\nWe hope this content was helpful to you and we look forward to your feedback in the comments!
