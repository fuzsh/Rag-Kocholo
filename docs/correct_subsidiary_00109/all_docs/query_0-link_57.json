        "text": "Tony Hsieh was a fast moving entrepreneur and venture capitalist who caught the internet wave in 1996 when he was just 23. His first project was LinkExchange, if you can remember that. Before being able to Google everything, you had to rely on discoverability via everyone else through linking with each other, either by straight URL or banner advertising. In 1998, Microsoft acquired the company for a cool $265 million, of which Hsieh netted $40 million. He used this capital to co-found a venture capital company that invested in the likes of Ask Jeeves, OpenTable and Zappos – the latter company he would become CEO of. As an early clothing item seller, Zappos was a trailblazer in online retail. Amazon took notice and acquired the company in 2009 for $1.2 billion, leaving Hsieh with a $214 million cut.\n\nHe remained as CEO until a few months before he passed away at the end of 2020.\n\n“Chase the vision, not the money, the money will end up following you.”\n\n– Tony Hsieh, Zappos\n\n“I’m not an inventor. I just want to make things better.”\n\n– Daniel Ek, Co-founder & CEO of Spotify\n\n“If you tune it so that you have zero chance of failure, you usually also have zero chance of success. The key is to look at ways for when you get to your failure checkpoint, you know to stop.”\n\n– Reid Hoffman, Co-founder of LinkedIn\n\n“It seems like the right thing to do is tackle problems other people aren’t working on.”\n\n– Sean Parker, Founder of Napster\n\n“Desperation sometimes drives innovation.”\n\n– Dara Khosrowshahi, CEO of Uber\n\n“No matter how successful you are, the haters will never go away.”\n\n– Sam Altman, CEO of Open AI"
