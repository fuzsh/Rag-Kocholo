        "text": "Trying to figure out what to call this new decade we're a week into?\n\nYou can cast your vote on http://namethedecade.com. But don't vote for \"aught.\"\n\n\"Anything but that,\" said Ali Partovi, who, with fellow Microsoft LinkExchange veterans Alan Shusterman and Sanjay Madan, started the site.\n\nTheir site is the offspring of a lunch-hour discussion last November in San Francisco that turned from the potential for Y2K-related computing problems to musings about the future.\n\n\"Suddenly, we started asking each other what life would be like in the . . . Then we just drew a blank, not knowing what to call the next decade,\" Partovi recalled.\n\nSoon, the trio set up their cyber-voting booth, offering visitors choices ranging from the dreaded \"Zeroes\" to \"The Double-O's,\" \"The Millies,\" \"The Double-Aughts\" and \"The 2-Ks\" to \"The Two-Thousands\" and \"The Naughties.\"\n\nIn the more than 50,000 ballots cast, three favorites emerged: The 2Ks is holding a narrow lead, while The Naughties and The Double-O's were close behind. NameTheDecade.com will cut off voting Jan. 20 _ already extended once, from Jan. 1, due to heavy Web site traffic _ and announce the winner shortly thereafter.\n\nNot on the ballot but appearing as a popular write-in was \"The Zippers,\" if you liked none of the above. Other suggestions making the rounds include \"The Millenni-os,\" \"The Dread Naughts\" or \"The Oh-Ohs.\"\n\nCertainly, if the 1890s era of post-pioneer lavishness and explosive urban and industrial growth was worth calling the Gay '90s, and 1920s speakeasies and bathtub gin earned the label the Roaring '20s, the Third Millennium's first 10 years would seem to deserve a sparkling moniker of their own.\n\nOr perhaps we should just wait to see what happens.\n\nAfter all, The Great Depression was synonymous with the 1930s; the Turbulent '60s became the platform for free love, riots and the agony of Vietnam; and the Disco Decade was a cultural wasteland so tainted as to generate the unobtrusive '80s and '90s the next two decades out."
