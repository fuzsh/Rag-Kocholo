Don’t count on it. Even though a new study pre¬ dicts that online revenues will more than double this season compared with last year, many Internet-based stores simply aren’t ready to capitalize on all those eager holiday shoppers. “You would be surprised how many sites have not bothered to support very basic features that are necessary for gift buying,\" said Nicole Vanderbilt, an ana¬ lyst at Jupiter Communications Inc. in New York.

The extent to which that will hurt vendors’ sales is becoming a hot topic. Although there’s no research that quantifies how widespread a year 2000 systems lockdown will be, Computerworld inter¬ views with nearly two dozen CIOs and Wall Street and mar¬ ket research analysts suggest that even a partial IT spending freeze “is going to be a real negative” for application soft¬ ware providers and systems integrators.

New fee plans promise flexibility Value-based idea Licensing models aimed at upgraders could cost more By Craig Stedman erp and supply-chain applica¬ tion vendors increasingly are pitching new pricing schemes that base license fees on a buy¬ er’s revenue, total employee head count or even the financial return expected from using the software. But the reaction of software buyers has been decidedly mixed. So-called value-based pricing often requires compa¬ nies to kick in extra payments if their revenue — or number of employees, in the case of hu¬ man resources applications — surpasses negotiated levels (see chart, page 104). However, they don’t typically get money back if the opposite happens and their business shrinks. For application vendors, val¬ ued-based pricing erases the need to keep tabs on whether customers are exceeding the Value-based plan, page 104 By Jaikumar Vijayan companies are starting to get more flexible software licensing options as major vendors ham¬ mer out new pricing models aimed at answering long-stand¬ ing concerns about cost, sim¬ plicity and portability. Big-shop software vendors BMC Software Inc. and Candle Corp. are quietly testing new, long-term software licensing agreements that they claim will make it cheaper for some users to upgrade or change platforms. The new licensing models are based on users’ purchasing points for software packages running on large systems.

Online this week www.computerworld.com/more Computerworld November 9, 1998 (www.computerworld.com) More opportunity, fewer women in IT Unlike some women in IT, Pauline Nist of Compaq's Tandem division says the industry is \"much more concerned about your ability than whether you are a man or a woman.\" By Barb Cole-Gomolski opportunities may abound in information technology, but the number of women in the field is dwindling. Compared with io years ago, women make up a smaller per¬ centage of computer science graduates, and the percentage of women in IT has shrunk from 35% in the early 1990s to 29% today, according to recent data from the U.S. Department of Labor. Observers cited several rea¬ sons for the shift, though there are no definitive answers. Some cited the long-held belief that girls aren’t encouraged at the same rate as boys to pursue sci¬ ence and math in school. In ad¬ dition, few opportunities for management jobs and the need to juggle job and family cause women to abandon their IT ca¬ reers, observers said. “We’re losing in a number of places,” said Pauline Nist, vice president for product and tech¬ nology at the Tandem division of Compaq Computer Corp. in Cupertino, Calif. Few women study computer science, and of those who do, many end up leaving the field, she said. ENROLLMENT DROPPING According to the U.S. Depart¬ ment of Education, the number of women graduating with bachelor’s degrees in computer science has dropped from about 37% in 1984 to 28% in 1995. Some said young women are put off by the stereotype of the computer geek who lacks social skills and is focused on techni¬ cal duties. Denise Gurer, chairwoman of Committee on Women at the Association for Computing Machinery, a New York-based computing professionals’ soci- Corrections A Nov. 2 Servers & PCs sec¬ tion story (“Publishing: Mac Nation,”) misidentified Ed Manel’s company affiliation.

Later, as they go through col¬ lege, women may find that com¬ puter labs may have a locker room mentality. “Things like screen savers of scantily clad women are common,” said Gurer, who has a doctorate in computer science and works as a researcher at SRI Interna¬ tional in Menlo Park, Calif. During her career, Gurer said she has often felt that she “had to prove herself more” than her male colleagues. Not so for Nist, who said one of the things she loves about the industry is that “it’s much more concerned about your ability than whether you are a man or a woman.” The down¬ side is that to get ahead, you have to be willing to make some sacrifices, she said. “Some of By Bob Wallace cisco systems inc. last week sought to advance the case for complete data, voice and video convergence with an array of offerings it says will help users reduce the total cost of network ownership. Cisco’s enhancements and new products come at a time when it and its rivals 3Com Corp., Nortel Networks and Ca¬ bletron Systems Inc. have been preaching the benefits of con¬ vergence.

He is Robert Haar. the really great women I’ve had working for me left to have babies and then reevaluated whether they wanted such de¬ manding careers,” she said. Niss said because of short- agement issues, as obstacles. “Convergence is a good idea, but the technology is still new and very expensive,” said Dean Qualls, network operations manager at J. C. Bradford & Co., a regional investment bank in Nashville. Qualls, who is skeptical that phone users will be satisfied with voice over Internet Proto¬ col connections, for example, said he couldn’t speculate as to when his company, which has 82 branch offices and five main sites in the Nashville area, would have a single network for voice, data and video. Some of them are starting with branch offices on the road to conver¬ gence, said John Morency, a vice president at Newton, Mass., consulting and research firm Renaissance Worldwide Inc. A company with 100 branch offices can expect to pay roughly $1.5 million for the capital equipment needed to support voice over frame relay alone, Morency estimated. At the cen¬ tral site, a company with 500 to 1,000 employees can expect to spend $250,000 to $300,000 for the “network”-based phone branch exchanges (PBX) and gateways needed to support voice over the LAN. ened product cycles and corpo¬ rate downsizing, IT depart¬ ments have become less “family friendly” in the past few years. For instance, Christine Fin- layson left her job as a software Cisco announced add-ons to its 7200 high-end routers and its AS5300 Access Concentra- Virqil Palmer of Air Products & Chemicals: \"We’re not about to throw out our telephone equipment” tors, and enhancements to its Catalyst 8540 and Lightstream 1010 LAN switches that will en¬ able them to support converged traffic. The vendor also plans to offer network-PBXs once its ac¬ quisition of Celsius Systems Inc. is approved. Cisco recom¬ mends that users with heavily used Ethernets move to switched Ethernet to get top voice quality from network- based PBXs. But branches with lightly used LANs can often get by without an upgrade. Despite the evolution of net¬ work-based phone systems, engineer at Santa Cruz, Calif.- based The Santa Cruz Opera¬ tion Inc. after the birth of her second child a few years ago. “I needed something less stress¬ ful, and I only wanted to work part time,” said Finlayson, who now spends about 20 hours per week managing software beta programs from her home in the Seattle area. The declining presence of women in IT hasn’t gone unno¬ ticed, and some schools are try¬ ing to do something about it. For instance, at Carnegie Mel¬ lon University in Pittsburgh, the percentage of women in the computer science program has jumped from 8% to 20% dur¬ ing the past three years, said Allan Fisher, associate dean at the university’s School of Com¬ puter Science. The increase is partly because the school has become more flexible about the progression of courses students have to take. “It makes it easier for male and female students who may not have that much prior experience with computers to enter the cur¬ riculum,” Fisher said. □ Frank Soltis isn’t ready to pen an obituary for PBXs. Soltis, senior vice president of opera¬ tions at Lake City Bank in War¬ saw, Ind., is running voice over the company’s massive Ti frame network, a project that emphasized the need for team¬ work. “You have to sit down and spend time planning with the networking and telecommu¬ nications people and telephone company people to make sure it’s a cooperative effort,” he said. Although he benefits from running a converged wide-area network, Todd Dion, vice presi¬ dent of technology at TutorTime Learning Systems Inc. in Boca Raton, Fla., came upon a “gotcha” that’s keeping him from extending video to LANs. Dion found that he can’t send video traffic through his firewall because the device doesn’t sup¬ port the H.323 protocol for videoconferencing. Convergence isn’t a good idea if it means swapping out equip¬ ment that’s still being paid for, said Virgil Palmer, networks director at Air Products and Chemicals Corp. in Allentown, Pa. “We’re not about to throw out our telephone equipment just to jump on something new. We need systems that will let us maximize the value of our origi¬ nal investment.” The bottom line: “We'll wait for someone else to take the first step,” Palmer said. □ ENTERPRISE NETWORKING Convergence isn’t cheap or easy The productivity of one CFO, dozens of VPs and hundreds of end users lies in your hands With the leading messaging server behind you, relief is at hand. 1 ISasiiang? « excnS^w As the industry’s current top-selling messaging server? and the leader in mail standardization among Fortune 50 companies?

Computerworld November 9, 1998 (www.computerworld.com) NT to enter embedded arena ► To offer static devices connection to a network By Sharon Gaudin corporate users and industry watchers say Microsoft Corp.’s Windows NT operating system — not exactly known for being lightweight — may have been trimmed down enough to com¬ pete in the embedded arena. Microsoft announced Win¬ dows NT Embedded 4.0 at the Embedded Systems West Con¬ ference in San Jose, Calif., last week. The new operating sys¬ tem — weighing in at 12M bytes of ROM compared with Windows NT 4.0, which totals about 125M bytes — is based on Windows NT 4.0 technology in¬ stead of the upcoming Windows 2000. The embedded operating system is slated for beta-testing early next year and shipment in the first quarter. By Matt Hamblen utilities started monitoring electricity meters via wireless networks and the Web two years ago. But technology trials announced last week by IBM will allow companies to actually watch vending machines, copi¬ er machines and even trash re¬ ceptacles around the globe. By reducing the need for rou¬ tine checks on all types of equipment, corporations could save 30% or more per year on such costs, analysts said. Data gathered by a processor on a trash compactor, for exam¬ ple, would save a truck driver from making regular checks. Instead, the driver would be dis¬ patched when the compactor needed to be emptied. BIG SUPPORTER IBM is lending its name to the effort to monitor embedded sys¬ tems in all types of mundane devices, announcing that it will use its global network to con¬ nect to software from EmWare Inc. within eight- and 16-bit microcontrollers being added to the latest machines. Several small companies manufacture devices to allow network monitoring, but IBM is the first to give an existing net¬ work such remote capabilities. Other major data carriers are expected to follow suit, analysts said. It’s also significant that Embedded NT was designed to be used in routing switches, high-end copiers, manufactur¬ ing machines and point-of-sale terminals. The operating system gives once-static machines the intelligence to connect with a network for receiving and send¬ ing information. Windows 2000 was designed for backward-compatibility with NT 4.0, Microsoft spokesmen said. That means companies that use NT 4.0 for embedded devices should have no trouble using them with Windows 2000 servers and workstations. \"This is definitely going to work for us,” said Donal Byrne, senior director of product mar¬ keting at Pittsburgh-based Fore Systems Inc., a networking company. “We’re using NT to make our switches application- EmWare’s software lets the de¬ vices be accessed by any type of network, they added. Officials at the two compa¬ nies said trials will begin this week with a large elevator com¬ pany and an international vend¬ ing machine company. FEWER TRIPS CellNet Data Systems’ technology for wireless remote reading of electric meters has made a big difference at St. Louis utility AmerenUE 1994 Field workers made 2,500 trips per year to read meters and talk to custom¬ ers about bill complaints 1998 With the technology, work¬ ers make about 700 trips per year CellNet Data Systems Inc. in San Carlos, Calif., has begun work with Xerox Corp. in Rochester, N.Y., to monitor copiers over a cellular network and track when they need toner, paper or maintenance. “IBM’s announcement, with its huge network, brings this technology more into the mainstream,” said Ellen Carney, an analyst at Dataquest in Lowell, Mass. But companies are unlikely to aware. It will enable our switch¬ es to prioritize traffic based on the importance of the user or the application. NT will inte¬ grate the switch, with the net¬ work and the applications run¬ ning across it.” A SURE THING? Byrne said he’s confident that NT can be trimmed down enough to run on small systems such as switches because he’s already made it happen. “We basically took Windows NT 4.0 and started disabling services and getting it into a for¬ mat that is very close to what Microsoft has announced. We embedded it in our switches, and it’s working very, very well,” he said. John Frederiksen, Microsoft’s group product manager for Windows NT, said Embedded NT also was designed to enable embrace it for three to five years, she added. “Even IT man¬ agers look at you like you have two heads when you talk about this,” she said. CellNet officials have begun to market their services beyond connecting electricity meters to utility central offices, the com¬ pany said. CellNet already has 1.5 million meters online and has contracts to add another 4 million meters with at least seven utilities, the officials said. One of the utilities, Amer¬ enUE in St. Louis, has nearly 800,000 electricity and some natural gas meters in homes and businesses being moni¬ tored daily using CellNet tech¬ nology. Every 24 hours, a meter is read remotely, although Cell- Net has the ability to read a me¬ ter every 2.5 minutes. “It allows us a faster response to disruptions and eliminates the manual reading of meters,” said Susan Gallagher, a spokes¬ woman for AmerenUE. In July, AmerenUE installed CellNet technology at Ford Mo¬ tor Co.’s Ford Explorer assem¬ bly plant in St. Louis to monitor and report on energy consump¬ tion at 50 points in the plant. The energy consumption data is used by Ford executives in Detroit to analyze whether work processes or production machines need to be changed to cut energy costs, spokesmen said. □ Features of Microsoft's Embedded NT ► Beta software due early next year ► Shipment expected in Q1 1999 ► Based on Windows NT 4.0 technology ► Takes advantage of NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 up¬ dates and additions ► Geared toward five areas: retail point-of-sale termi¬ nals, medical devices, industrial automation, office automation and telecommunications a printer, for example, to keep track of which employees send jobs to the printer, so the appro¬ priate departments can be billed for the work. And it should en¬ able a machine that builds wid¬ gets to keep track of the parts being used and automatically put in an order request when inventory hits a certain point. GOOD CITIZENS “There’s a huge opportunity for products and devices to become part of the networked commu¬ nity,” said Greg Blatnik, vice president at Zona Research Inc. in Redwood City, Calif. “Realistically, well probably see By Carol Sliwa SUN MICROSYSTEMS INC. last week jumped back into the Web browser market with an offer¬ ing aimed at network comput¬ ers, kiosks and other non-PC devices. Sun is pitching its new browser, due next year, as an al¬ ternative for companies that may be worried that Microsoft Corp.’s expanding interests in real estate, auto retail and trav¬ el will encroach on their own business interests, said Jonathan Schwartz, director of Sun’s Java enterprise products group. Written in Java, one of the potential advantages of Sun’s new browser is its ability to run on myriad embedded devices — from soda machines to gas pumps — that have widely vary¬ ing operating systems. Having a Web browser at the gas pump could, for instance, let a customer withdraw money from a bank account. “You could consolidate all of your lit¬ tle service interactions in one place,” Schwartz said. products emerge around the middle of next year.” Both Blatnik and Dwight Davis, a Microsoft analyst at Summit Strategies Inc. in Kirk¬ land, Wash., said Microsoft is entering a market in which Sun Microsystems Inc. has had a head start with its platform- independent Embedded Java. Hewlett-Packard Co. has long been a major player in the em¬ bedded market, especially be¬ cause its printers account for a major chunk of its revenue. “Both Embedded NT and Embedded Java are pretty new out of the gate,” Davis said. “There’s a huge embedded mar¬ ket out there. I see both grab¬ bing their own share of the market.” But Howard Green, market¬ ing manager at San Jose, Calif- based Cell Computing Inc., a company that builds small motherboards, said NT has one strong advantage over Java — NT applications. “There’s a lot of software on the market for NT,” he said. “If you can have all your devices on your network on one user inter¬ face and on one operating sys¬ tem with all the same operating system internals, you’ve got it going on.”D Users worry about NT management; new tools are meant to help. Page 63. “The designer of the embed¬ ded hardware could pick any processor chip they would want, and then once you have a [Java] virtual machine for it, the rest of your software would run,” said David Folger, an analyst at in Stamford, Conn.-based Meta Group Inc. Although device makers may benefit, Folger foresees few end- user companies finding a direct need for a Java browser. Sun’s existing Hotjava brows¬ er has been hampered by its limited feature set. The new one will add support for Hyper¬ text Markup Language (HTML) 3.2, JavaScript and plug-ins, Schwartz said.

Co m p u t e r wo r I d November 9, 1998 (www.computerworld.com) Apple claims bullying by Microsoft ► Gates evasive when shown E-mail evidence By Kim S. Nash and Patrick Thibodeau Washington the government continued to pick apart Microsoft Corp.’s business methods in court here last week, as an Apple Computer Inc. executive testi¬ fied that Microsoft strong-armed Apple into making software deals it wouldn’t have made otherwise. Yet as the trial starts its fourth week, several informa¬ tion technology managers said it hasn’t changed their views of Microsoft much. Daily court- Notes on Netscape As expected, Microsoft last week appealed a Boston judge’s ruling barring it from getting at taped interviews and written notes gathered by two local professors who wrote a book about Net¬ scape’s business ups and downs. Microsoft wants to use the material in its government antitrust trial, to show that it was mistakes by Netscape’s own executives — not any il¬ legal doings by Microsoft — that account for Netscape losing ground to Microsoft in the browser war. A decision isn’t expected for several weeks. room events are too frustrating to track closely because it’s hard to tell what’s true and what isn’t, they said. “I haven’t seen anything that I didn’t know or suspect or believe in the first place,” said Don Stroud, director of MIS at the Plain Dealer Publishing Co. in Cleveland. “One would have to be naive to believe that all these people are angels,” he said of executives at Microsoft and its industry rivals. TOUGH SELL But Chris Horrocks, CIO at Commercial Financial Services Inc. in Tulsa, Okla., said he was surprised by the lengths to which Microsoft apparently has gone to compete in the Internet software market. “The evidence is demonstrat¬ ing that they have been tougher than I thought,” Horrocks said, citing Microsoft’s alleged bully¬ ing of Apple as an example. Avie Tevanian, senior vice president of software engineer¬ ing at Apple, testified that his company was forced last year to make Microsoft’s Internet Ex¬ plorer its default Web browser or risk losing Microsoft’s sup¬ port for its Office for Macintosh application suite. “It was a matter of [Microsoft] using extreme power in the market to try to affect the terms of another business deal,” Tevanian said. “That seemed inappropriate.” Microsoft countered in court that it was simply trying to head off the possibility of Apple filing a $1.2 billion patent infringe¬ ment suit against it. Without saying outright that Microsoft had threatened to kill Mac Office, Microsoft lawyer Theodore Edelman sought to put negotiations about the fu¬ ture of the suite within the framework of the patent issue. In August 1997, the compa¬ nies agreed on a deal that made Internet Explorer Apple’s de¬ fault browser and guaranteed continued development of Mac Office for five years. Microsoft bought $150 mil¬ lion of Apple stock and agreed not to sell it for a period of three years. The two companies also set¬ tled the ongoing patent dispute, with Microsoft paying Apple an undisclosed sum. Tevanian also charged that Microsoft tried to coax Apple into dividing the multimedia market by asking Apple not to make its QuickTime audio and video software available on Mi¬ crosoft’s Windows platform. Ap¬ ple rejected that idea, he said. Microsoft has denied making the proposal. Also last week, U.S. Depart¬ ment of Justice lawyer David Boies played about two of 20 hours of videotaped testimony from Microsoft Chairman and CEO Bill Gates in which Gates was confronted with a series of seemingly damaging internal E-mail messages. Gates often was evasive, claiming that he didn’t know what was being discussed in the E-mail. That tack isn’t unusual — es¬ pecially in antitrust trials — ac¬ cording to George Cumming, a lawyer at Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison LLP in New York. When a company is confront¬ ed with hurtful internal docu¬ ments, it may adopt a “crazy middle-management defense,” in which underlings are said to do and say things that more re¬ sponsible top executives would not. “The idea is to have the per¬ son at the top with ‘Godfather’- like deniability,” said Cumming, a former special trials lawyer at the Justice Department. □ Let's go to the videotape Government lawyers made much of the disparity between Bill Gates’ internal E-mail and his August deposition, under questioning by lead U.S. lawyer David Boies. E-MAIL \"Do we have a clear plan on what we want Apple to do to undermine Sun?” - Gates, in Aug. 8, 1997, E-mail to Senior Vice President Paul Maritz and other Microsoft executives VIDEO DEPOSITION Q. What did you mean when you asked Mr. Maritz whether or not \"we have a clear plan on what we want Apple to do to undermine Sun? A: I don't remember. E-MAIL lOj VIDEO DEPOSITION \"Getting Apple to do anything that significantly/materially disadvantag¬ es Netscape will be tough. Do you agree that Apple should be meeting the spirit of our cross license agree¬ ment and that MacOffice is the per¬ fect club to use on them?” - A Feb. 13, 1998, E-mail from Don Bradford, a Microsoft manager, to Gates 0. Do you have an understanding of what Mr. Bradford means when he refers to MacOffice as \"the per¬ fect club to use on Apple\"? A: No. E-MAIL L0J VIDEO DEPOSITION \"When I met with you last, you had a lot of pretty pointed questions about Java, so I want to make sure I understand your issues/concerns. Here’s a start, can you please add any that I’m missing. 1. What is our business model for Java? 0: Do you have any reason to be¬ lieve that he [Slivka] would have misstated what you told him when you met with him last before April 14, 1997? A: In no way does this purport to be a restatement of things I said to Ben Slivka. Leaked memo praised open source ► Microsoft identifies Linux as potential threat By David Orenstein the competition between Mi¬ crosoft Corp. and open software code came long before a pair of leaked Microsoft memos de¬ scribed such code as a threat. That was the word from prominent open-source and free software advocates, who used the posting of two Microsoft memos on the Web last week to call for Microsoft to join them rather than fight. The memos, dubbed Hal¬ loween I and Halloween II, were published by open source advocate Eric Raymond. They first appeared Oct. 31 at www. opensource.org. The memos were confirmed as genuine internal reports by Microsoft, whose response is at mvw.microsoft. com/ntserver/highlights/editorletter. asp. Halloween II, on which Mi¬ crosoft hadn’t commented at press time, zeroes in on the free and open Linux operating system. The memos praise open- source development, in which the source code for software is freely distributed, for encourag¬ ing large numbers of developers to solve problems and make im¬ provements. The process has helped products such as Linux and the Apache Web server become credible, high-performance competitors to Windows NT, the memos said. “Due to its Unix heritage, Linux represents a lower switch¬ ing cost for some organizations than NT,” Halloween I said. To Microsoft, the Halloween I memo “is a snapshot in time — one person’s view,” said Colleen Beauregard, a Microsoft spokes¬ woman. “It is not Microsoft’s official response to Linux.” Bob Young, president of Lin¬ ux vendor Red Hat Software Inc. in Research Triangle Park, N.C., said the memo added lit¬ tle new information to the com¬ petition story. Red Hat and Microsoft have been competing for sales to In¬ ternet service providers for 2. How do we wrest control of Java away from Sun? 3. How do we turn Java into just the latest, best way to write Win¬ dows applications?” - April 14, 1997 E-mail from Ben Slivka, a senior Windows program manager, to Gates more than two years, he said. Linux has risen in a climate of Microsoft strength and does not depend on Microsoft failure for its own success, Young said. Michael Goulde, an analyst at Patricia Seybold Group in Boston, said Microsoft’s best de¬ fense against open or free soft¬ ware is obvious: Produce good products with better support than free software’s scant sup¬ port and charge a reasonable price for the added value. Tim O’Reilly of O’Reilly & Associates Inc., a major backer of the popular and free Perl scripting language, urged Mi¬ crosoft to embrace the opportu¬ nities created by open source platforms rather than viewing open software as a threat. Richard Stallman, founder of the Free Software Foundation in Boston, said Microsoft’s strategy alone makes little difference in the debate between advocates of free software and proprietary software. Stallman said software firms, including Microsoft, can stifle free software development with restrictive licenses and patents, but Microsoft’s individual strat¬ egy is a relatively insignificant part of the greater debate. □ 1998 Unisys Corporation.

The venture would enable a single device to act as pager, cell phone and handheld computer using the Windows CE platform, said analyst Dan Briere at TeleChoice Inc. in Stafford Springs, Conn. Microsoft also is developing a “micro¬ browser” for enabling smart cellular phones to access E-mail and the Web, analysts said. Wireless wide-area networks are an immature technology but sought after by corporations that want to connect sales forces and even remote offices to enter¬ prise resource planning data and more if it can be done efficiently and securely, analysts said. “Today, you can’t take raw data and send it efficiently over a wireless network since it can cost 30 cents a minute,” compared with 5 cents a minute for some landline long-distance connections, said Alan Reiter, an analyst at Wireless Internet & Mobile Computing in Chevy Chase, Md. The Qualcomm-Microsoft venture will compete against the Symbian joint ven¬ ture announced in June by Motorola Inc., Nokia AB in Finland, Ericsson AB in Sweden and Psion PLC in the U.K. □ Microsoft snags Web ad company By Kim S. Nash Microsoft corp.’s acquisition last week of LinkExchange Inc., a Web advertising company, will help keep the www.msn. com portal competitive with rivals such as Yahoo Inc., analysts said. The deal could also help msn.com make money — something Microsoft officials have acknowledged hasn’t yet happened. For example, Microsoft could start charging LinkExchange customers who want to advertise on Microsoft’s msn.com portal sites, such as CarPoint and HomeAdvisor. But more likely, analysts said, is that Microsoft will benefit from the increased traffic to msn.com and its sites from vis¬ itors who see a CarPoint ad on a Link- Exchange customer’s site and then buy a car there. Through LinkExchange’s Ban¬ ner Network program, more than 400,000 Web sites trade and sell adver¬ tising space at one another’s sites. Microsoft has already sold some ad¬ vertising banners at its msn.com Web sites, but with the addition of LinkEx- change-generated traffic, Microsoft will get more visitors to its sites, said Vernon Keenan, an analyst at Keenan Vision Inc. in San Francisco. Neither party would disclose how much Microsoft paid for San Francisco- based LinkExchange, which was founded in March 1996 and is one of the oldest online advertising companies. But press reports last week pegged the deal at being worth $250 million in Microsoft stock. □ Other Guys N© N© N© N© N© N© N© 4-1©© Round-trip Wizards. .Push-button Deployment. .Patented Partitioning Technology.

IRBA V-\\ i‘'\\: Computerworld November 9, 1998 (www.computerworld.com) % . -8 Vt&A LY $ P e a k Nightmare on the Net FRANK HAYES Last Monday, ABC News got hit by every Web site’s nightmare. Some¬ thing that wasn’t supposed to appear — Tuesday’s election results — went live on ABCnews.com the day be¬ fore the polls opened. Complete results of Senate and governors’ races were available for hours to anyone hitting the site before the net¬ work spotted the glitch and pulled the plug. Tire results weren’t real, of course. For ex¬ ample, ABC had New York Sen. Alfonse D ’Amato trouncing Charles Schumer, who later turned in a 54% to 45% vic¬ tory, and put actual winner Jesse Ventu¬ ra trailing in third place in the Min¬ nesota governor’s race. The “early results” were part of a test, using dummy numbers apparently based on recent polls. ABC won’t con¬ firm the source of the phony results, except to say they “do not reflect the reporting or news judgment of ABC News.” Well, of course they don’t. They reflect an embarrassing screwup in which information that was supposed to stay under wraps became very, very public. Who’s at fault? ABC offi¬ cially blames “human error.” That’s diplomatic, but let’s cut to the chase: If the IT people responsible for the jgIT people know the rules - and should have enforced them at ABC. site had done their jobs right, that screwup never would have happened. Hey, that may not be kind or reason¬ able or even fair — but it’s true. Maybe the test could have been kept away from the live systems entirely. Or it could have used what was more obviously test data or dummy names. Certainly it should have been monitored continu¬ ously. IT people know those rules — and should have enforced them. We’ve got decades of experience mak¬ ing sure data doesn’t fall into the wrong hands. We’ve always built staging areas and safeguards of every kind to make sure tests can’t spill over into produc¬ tion systems. If we aren’t the ones re¬ sponsible for blocking this kind of in¬ formation leak, who is? Management? Forget it. It would never occur to top brass that mixing Web site tests with live systems puts the business at risk. Users? Get real. They want their new Web site features to happen right now, and they’ll keep pushing the limits and cutting comers and bend¬ ing rules as long as they can get away with it. That leaves to IT the nightmarish task of pro¬ tecting clueless executives and reckless users from themselves. Funny thing is, we’ve been doing this for decades, since the days when our main job was guarding and dispensing data. Back then, IT was buried deep in the organization, far from the front lines of business. That was before companies got turned inside out by the Internet. Now we are the front lines of busi¬ ness. And whether they like it or not, when it comes to the Web and elec¬ tronic commerce, business users and managers don’t just need our wires and servers and software. They also need our expertise at keeping them from shooting themselves in the foot — or the head — when it comes to how those systems are used. They may not like what we’ll do. Mat¬ ter of fact, they’ll probably hate it — even more than when IT took control of PCs and LANs away from users. They’ll resent the restrictions and chafe against the controls. They’ll accuse us of being power-hungry control freaks — and it’s up to us to make sure that’s not true. But unless we take a firmer hand, and lend users a hand in understanding how to develop and use their Internet- based information systems — that’s what they’re doing, after all, developing systems to distribute information — well be condemning them to relearn, by painful experience, the past half- century of IT practice. That would be a real nightmare. □ Hayes is Computerworld ’s staff colum¬ nist. His Internet address is frankjkayes @ cw.com. Digicash files Chapter 11 FBI investigates Web hack Micropayment vendor Digicash Inc. has filed for Chap¬ ter n bankruptcy protection, the company confirmed last week after closing its offices in Amsterdam and laying off all but six people at its Palo Alto, Calif., head¬ quarters. The company’s E-Cash software lets Internet shoppers conduct small transactions over the Web without using their credit cards for each one. But so far, market acceptance of such offerings has been limited. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is investigating an Oct. 17 attack on The Boston Globe Web site (www.boston.com) and its possible connection to simi¬ lar incidents at a handful of area companies. An E-mail message — with pornographic references in the text of the memo and www.boston.com in the “from” line — was sent to thousands of Internet users. A Globe spokesman said the E-mail addresses were gen¬ erated randomly and many didn’t exist, so the E-mail was bounced back to the Globe’s mail servers. Stanford systems hacked * o o Hackers penetrated systems at Stanford Uni¬ versity last month during a 15-day period and modified some system binaries and log files but didn’t damage user data or files. The uni¬ versity said it believes the hackers entered its sys¬ tems from Sweden and Canada via the Internet and installed a sniffer program that steals data. The securi¬ ty breach started Oct. 11 and was discovered Oct. 26. The systems became vulnerable when security patches for two workstations used for coursework and non- sponsored research were improperly installed, accord¬ ing to the university. of Customer: Consolidated Freightways Corp., Menlo Park, Calif. Prime contractor: IBM Global Services Terms: $110 million, five years Highlights: Except for new system devel¬ opment, contract covers just about everything, including recruiting, management of staff turnover, all desktop computing services, help desk support, data center operations and voice and data networks. The prime motivator was staying ahead of competitors, CIO Matt Saikkonen said. NT data hard to recover Windows NT servers are more susceptible to data loss than those using other operating systems, according to a report by Broadcasters Network International Inc., a Glendale, Calif., consultancy. Because NT doesn’t track deletions, it’s harder for systems managers to re¬ cover users’ accidental file deletions. The report cites two surveys of about 100 systems administrators and one of 228 administrators. A spokesman said recreat¬ ing 100M bytes of data can cost as much as $100,000. Data mining for insurers IBM has introduced a data mining system aimed at the insurance industry. Winterthur Swiss Insurance Croup in Switzerland plans to use the system, part of the DecisionEdge family, to determine which customers are the most likely candidates for other insurance offerings. Pricing will start at $1 million. DecisionEdge systems for the telecommunications and utility indus¬ tries were introduced last year. IBM plans a version of the system for retail banking in the next 30 days. Optical fiber patent sought Start-up SilkRoad Inc. in San Diego demonstrated last week that it could transmit data at 93c bit/sec. over a single wavelength using a single optical fiber 100km long, using a process called Refractive Synchronization Communication. Analysts said other fiber-optic vendors are testing similar bandwidth capacity, but only with multiple waves traveling together over a single fiber. SilkRoad applied for patents on the process last month and announced its first trial customer will be San Diego State University.

All rights reserved Computerworld November 9, 1998 (www.computerworld.com) se CEO leaves top job at NCI Sybase Inc.’s chairman and for¬ mer CEO Mitchell Kertzman ten¬ dered his resignation last week to become president and CEO at Network Computer Inc. (NCI), a Redwood Shores, Calif.-based maker of information appliance software launched in 1996 by rival Oracle Corp. In an interview with senior writer Stewart Deck, Kertzman spoke about his move and his plans for the future. On how NCI caught his attention: My wife says the three things I like to do best are watch tele¬ vision, surf the Web and play with gadgets. And she said, “This job, they pay you to do that!” This company has real products, real technology, real customers and real revenues, so I saw it as a great opportunity. On NCI's challenges in the coming year: We have to deliver products on time and do a better job of explaining who we are and what we do. The whole area of information appliances isn’t very well understood. The general public thinks of it as a toaster with an RJ-11 [telephone jack] on the back — so we need to help better define it. On NCI’s independence from Oracle: NCI is still majority-owned by Oracle, but that stake has been declining and will continue to decline as we bring in addition¬ al investment. [Other investors include Netscape Communica¬ tions Corp., Sony Corp., Sega Enterprises Ltd. and Nintendo Co.] The goal is to have an inde¬ pendent public company. I've seen very few traces of Oracle; there is no management-level integration with Oracle, and only two of the directors, [Chair¬ man] David Roux and [Oracle CEO] Larry Ellison, are from \"Hiring me is an affirmation of NCI’s independence [from Oracle].\" - Mitchell Kertzman, CEO, Network Computer Inc. Oracle. Hiring me is an affir¬ mation of NCI’s independence. On leaving Sybase: Obviously, I wish the finan¬ cial results were better. I have the traditional view that most people coming into a turn¬ around situation have: I wish I had been more aggressive when I took over. But I think I helped stabilize the company in a diffi¬ cult market condition, and I’m optimistic about Sybase going forward. My leaving here has been long-planned. We’ve been on a succession path with John Chen since I brought him in [from Siemens-Nixdorf Inc. in July 1997]. I’m happy, John’s happy and the board is happy. □ Boole users gird for BMC price hikes A list of BMC’s most significant acquisitions I Date Company Price 1 November 1998 Boole & Babbage Inc. $900M March 1998 BGS Systems Inc. $285M May 1997 Data Tools Inc. $81M January 1994 Patrol Software $36M ► Help with product integration strategies might placate users By Cynthia Boumellis the details were sketchy, but that didn’t worry customers much last week when BMC Software Inc. announced plans to acquire San Jose, Calif.-based networking veteran Boole & Babbage Inc. Users told Computerworld they were happy with the deal despite the lack of information about BMC’s plans, because the alliance could help them man¬ age a broad range of applica¬ tions from a central location. Yet the merger could have customers paying more for products; BMC officials said they have a reputation for being a high-value vendor rather than a low-priced one. Some users weren’t sure how they would respond to possible price hikes. “Boole has been more flexible than BMC in terms of price and conditions,” said Larry Dysin- ger, assistant vice president at Insurance Services Office Inc. in Pearl River, N.Y. Yet he added that BMC has made dramatic technological improvements over the years, which in some cases might make up for high¬ er prices. MORE MONEY? MORE VALUE Meanwhile, other Boole cus¬ tomers, such as Andie Shih, manager of automation and process engineering at Ontario Hydro in Toronto, are willing to consider higher prices if BMC offers incentives. “Now that they are married, it is their obligation to help me converge to their future direc¬ tion,” Shih said. “I would expect that they would give me a trade- in value for that.” Command/Post is the core product behind Boole’s end-to- end management offerings. It lets users view an entire net¬ work infrastructure from one console. Combined with BMC’s Patrol tools, which monitor ap¬ plications and databases, it will help customers automate the process of correlating informa¬ tion from those sources back to Command/ Post to determine where problems might lie. However, some Boole and BMC products don’t integrate. Bert Cooley, a technical leader at New York State Electric & Gas in Ithaca, uses automation tools from Boole and recovery tools from BMC. He said he wants to tie those tools together on the company’s IBM OS/390 platform and hopes the merger will strength¬ en this integration. Integration occurs when Patrol agents feed information to Command/ Post. □ Microwave systems deliver big bandwidth By Bob Wallace users looking to extend the reach of their Fast Ethernet campus networks without ex¬ pensive local carrier services or construction can turn to 100M bit/sec. microwave systems from start-up WinNet MCS Inc. Where today most users are forced to funnel traffic from high-speed campus networks onto low-speed and costly local carrier pipes, the Sunnyvale, Calif., vendor’s systems, due out next week, will let users main¬ tain high speeds to sites up to six miles away. “This is an ideal way to ex¬ tend a iooM-bit campus backbone network be¬ cause of its simplicity,” said Sam Alunni, president of Ster¬ ling Research in Sterling, Mass. Most users aren’t interested in digging and burying cable between buildings, he added. “Getting up on the roof and in¬ stalling a microwave system is much more compelling,” Alun¬ ni said. Price is also a factor. The Win-100 packages, with one starting at $60,000, plug in directly to switches and routers. The vendor claims 94M bit/sec. throughput on the connection. By comparison, users can expect to pay a local carrier $5,000 per month for a 45M bit/sec. line, which means that the Win-100 pays for itself in a year while providing more than twice the bandwidth, Alunni said. Carriers don’t offer Fast Ethernet services. GOOD PRICE One user thinks $60,000 for 100M bit/sec. of bandwidth is more than reasonable. “We have two locations we could use more bandwidth between, and 100M bits would satisfy them for quite a while,” said Mike Felerski, systems network manag¬ er for Butler County, Ohio. “The [WinNet] pricing isn’t bad for that kind of bandwidth. [The Win-100] is a reasonable alter¬ native to laying fiber between locations.” But microwave isn’t for every¬ one. For starters, systems require a clear line of sight between rooftop antennae. And bad weather, such as rain, can temporarily hurt performance. And many mi¬ crowave packages, including the Win-ioos, require users to get radio frequency licenses from the Federal Communications Commission, which can take weeks or months. □ FAST ETHERNET NETWORKS Card makes old PCs new again By April Jacobs EVERGREEN TECHNOLOGIES INC. plans to release a PCI-card- based product that will let PC users upgrade their desktop PCs to Intel Corp.’s latest Celeron processor models. The Corvallis, Ore., company will make the upgrade cards available midmonth with a start¬ ing price of about $350. In ad¬ dition to offering 333- and 400- MHz versions of the Celeron, Evergreen will offer the K6-2 processor from Sunnyvale, Calif. -based Advanced Micro Devices Inc. Initial benchmarks provided by Evergreen indicate that an upgraded PC will have about 95% of the performance of a new, similarly configured PC. If that holds in real-world use, the PCI-based upgrade will deliver more speed than most upgrades provide. Company of¬ ficials said the upgrade achieves that speed by being coupled with a 100-MHz bus on the PCI card, rather than using the 66- MHz bus on older PCs. Howev¬ er, the card must still communi¬ cate with the rest of the system over the PCI bus at its 33-MHz speed. That communication could slow down overall perfor¬ mance, although Evergreen offi¬ cials said they have figured out how to avoid that. Using the PCI slot is a new approach to upgrades. Most upgrades today require replac¬ ing the existing processor or re¬ placing the motherboard and of¬ ten replacing Windows drivers, which “is a very expensive proposition,” according to Kevin Knox, an analyst at Gartner Group Inc. in Stamford, Conn. The card could be a worth¬ while investment for some com¬ panies if it proves easy to install and actually lives up to the per¬ formance gains that users expect, he said. □ 1 MISSION: Tackle the tough computing jobs, from the Apollo program to muirinanorut corporations.

A majority (59%) of 2,100 Web shoppers surveyed said gift buying accounts for less than 10% of their overall Internet purchases, in part because Internet-based stores haven’t effectively gone after the mar¬ ket, the market research firm concluded. The good news for Web re¬ tailers lies in the potential to convert those “self-buyers” into gift buyers, Vanderbilt added. Despite the relative scarcity of gift buying online to date, Jupiter predicts that online holi¬ day shopping will more than double this year compared with last year, to $2.3 billion. Others are even more optimistic, with the electronic-commerce trade association Shop.org predicting that revenues will triple, based on a survey of about 100 online retailers. “We are expecting Christmas to be really large this year — By Craig Stedman San Francisco peoplesoft inc. is charting a course that goes beyond back- office enterprise resource plan¬ ning into data analysis and elec¬ tronic commerce. Now the com¬ pany has to persuade users to go along for the ride. At PeopleSoft’s annual user conference here last week, a half-dozen attendees said they weren’t instantly sold on the new applications that the Pleasanton, Calif., vendor plans to release next year. The challenge for PeopleSoft is twofold, analysts said. Much of its user base consists of hu¬ man resources departments that need to do just such basics as benefits administration. And many of the manufacturers that have bought PeopleSoft’s newer planning and production man¬ agement applications are still busy installing them. For example. Corning Inc. is making a huge commitment to PeopleSoft’s applications, which run the Coming, N.Y., manufac¬ turer’s corporate human re¬ sources and finance systems and are starting to be installed at its 10 manufacturing units. double to triple,” said Steve Hamlin, vice president and gen¬ eral manager at IQVC, the In¬ ternet arm of the TV shopping channel QVC Inc. in West Chester, Pa. He was speaking at last month’s Shop.org confer¬ ence in New York. Online auc¬ tioneer Onsale Inc. in Menlo Park, Calif., also expects its November and December sales to double or triple. Although the electronic- commerce elite such as Amazon.com Inc. and Garden Escape Inc. boast features such as gift registries, online gift cer¬ tificates and gift wrapping, many other shopping sites don’t. Gift registries are particu¬ larly useful in helping Web re¬ tailers develop more revenues from existing customers, Van¬ derbilt said. Experts said sites can still add features such as gift registries, where users can post items they want. Clinique.com last year launched a service offering to But that rollout could take five years or more to finish, said Rick Beers, strategic process leader for supply-chain opera¬ tions at Coming. And the focus is more on improving inventory planning and on-time order delivery than on adding even more applications, he said. “Right now, we’re going to be looking at the basics.” PeopleSoft's new analysis software \"could let us know how much profit we're going to make going into a sale.\" - Eric Bur, American Century On the other hand, Borden Chemicals and Plastics gets all it needs from PeopleSoft’s human resources and payroll applications. The Baton Rouge, La., company even outsourced its PeopleSoft systems because those functions “aren’t core to us,” said Cris Dunn, director of information services at Borden Chemicals. For its more vital finance and manufacturing applications, Borden Chemicals is installing software from PeopleSoft rival E-mail users’ prospective “San¬ tas” with gift suggestions. Few sites offer the options that some mail-order catalogs do, such as allowing an impulse buyer to purchase an item in early November but schedule shipment in mid-December. That’s mainly because of the complexity of systems integra- J. D. Edwards & Co. Up to 700 employees will have access to the J. D. Edwards One World system, compared with about 15 for PeopleSoft’s applications, Dunn said. Included in PeopleSoft's plans are a data warehouse, a series of packaged analytic ap¬ plications and personalized intranet software akin to Yahoo and other Internet portal sites. Much of that isn’t due until late next year, though. One user that expects to be onboard is American Century Investments. The Kansas City, Mo. -based mutual funds com¬ pany, which uses PeopleSoft’s finance and human resources software, is beta-testing an ac¬ tivity-based costing application that is scheduled for release in the first quarter of next year. Installing the analysis soft¬ ware would be like putting in “a whole new accounting system,\" said Eric Bur, chief accounting officer at American Century. “But it could let us know how much profit we’re going to make going into a sale. Pricing decisions are just made by intu¬ ition now.”D PeopleSoft, other vendors pitch value-based soft¬ ware pricing at users. Page 1 tion that such service entails. Many Internet stores have expe¬ rienced only one or two holiday shopping seasons and are loath to jump into such projects. They are more concerned about issues such as handling high- volume transactions and keep¬ ing up crucial links. “It's too complex from an operations standpoint,” said Phil Polishook, vice president of marketing at EToys Inc. in Santa Monica, Calif. Instead, EToys is working on setting up a second cluster of servers on the East Coast to boost perfor¬ mance for shoppers there and to provide redundancy. The toy retailer is also adding a backup system in case the direct link to its credit-card authorization goes down, as it has occasion¬ ally done. BAD TIMING “If it goes down two hours on Dec. 12, we’re really screwed,” Polishook noted. EToys, which was still new during last year’s holidays shopping period, could see a twentyfold increase in sales, Polishook said. EMarketer, a consulting firm in New York, recently predicted that this year’s overall consumer online retail sales will hit $4.5 billion. However, that’s still a tiny percentage of annual overall retail sales — Wal-Mart Stores Inc. last week said it alone posted $12.4 billion in sales for just the five weeks ended Oct. 2. A National Retail Federation survey conducted with Deloitte & Touche in New York, esti¬ mated that the average Internet holiday shopper will spend $270, or 27% of his total gift budget, online. About 30% of all Internet users are expected to buy holiday gifts on the Web, the survey said. □ PeopleSoft casts a wider net ► But users aren’t clamoring for new apps yet Fears mount on splintering of Java platform By Carol Sliwa end users’ fears of a fractured Java community resurfaced last week, as Hewlett-Packard Co. and more than a dozen other vendors announced plans to work on their own real-time extension to the Java platform. The next day, Sun Microsys¬ tems Inc., creator and steward of the programming language, also detailed plans to work on a real-time Java specification through its controversial evolv¬ ing process [CW, Oct. 19]. Some companies unhappy over Sun’s level of control have chosen to go with the HP-led group. Others said they’ll stick with Sun, and some said they plan to support both groups to meet their customers’ needs. REALLY CRITICAL That splintering of the real-time community raised concerns among users contemplating the use of Java in their embedded devices. The real-time Java extension is critical for embed¬ ded devices that need to be able to predict when certain events stop and start. Once you choose one group’s embedded Java version “you can’t switch,” said Karl Mason, a software engineer at Allied- Signal Inc.’s aerospace division. Mason can’t use regular Java because the aircraft engine con¬ trollers he programs need to re¬ spond quickly to changing con¬ ditions. Right now Mason uses C++, but he said he’s consider¬ ing Java for portability reasons. Joe Sullivan, a software devel¬ oper at Argonne National Labo¬ ratory in Illinois, said the duel¬ ing standards might make his group delay a decision on Java. Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia, Ill., which has selected Java as the pre¬ ferred implementation language for its next-generation system, simply plans to stick with Sun. “We’re committed to 100% Pure Java. We want ‘write once, run anywhere,’ ” said Duane Voy, a programmer at the lab. James Bell, general manager of HP’s embedded software operation, charged that Sim has no intention “to genuinely open the process.” \"We invented Java. We prose¬ lytized it. It’s got real value out there in the world. And now other people want it,” Sun Vice President Jim Mitchell said. □ ^51 issues for $4fi(o $39.95 YCS, I want to receive my own copy of COMPUTERWORLD each week.

Last week, EMC Corp. in Hopkinton, Mass., announced software to boost storage-area networking (SAN) security as well as support for several SAN hubs. And networking giant 3Com Corp. in Santa Clara, Calif., announced its entry into the SAN fray with a product line due early next year. Analysts said the news sup¬ ports projections for a booming SAN market. “[We] forecast that 37% of external server stor¬ age sold in 2002 will be in a storage network,” said Robert MOREONUNE* For white papers, articles, organizations and resources related to storage and storage-area networks, visit Computeru/orld online. www.eomputerworld.eom/more Gray, an analyst at Internation¬ al Data Corp. in Framingham, Mass., a Computerworld sister company. A SAN is like a back-end LAN that connects servers or clients with shared storage de¬ vices. Users can build SANs with other interfaces, such as Escon, but Fibre Channel is generally favored due to im¬ proved maximum distances and transfer rates (iokm and 100M byte/sec., respectively). EMC’s new software, called Volume Logix, mediates access to storage volumes in shared subsystems. It is targeted at Windows NT storage networks because NT servers lack secure volume sharing and try to “own” all connected storage. NO MORE OVERWRITES With Volume Logix, EMC offi¬ cials said users can connect multiple NT servers to a single port on an EMC Symmetrix ar¬ ray, via a hub, without the worry of overwrites. Fibre Channel hubs now supported by Sym¬ metrix include those sold by Hewlett-Packard Co., Compaq Computer Corp., Dell Comput¬ er Corp. and Siemens AG. “We have a few NT servers connected to Symmetrix right now, and as we get more, it will make sense to go in through one point of contact, such as a hub,” said John A. Hanaberry, CIO at Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. in Louisville, Ky. “But we’ll need software to manage it.” In September, Hanaberry’s group consolidated 1.4T bytes of multiplatform storage on several EMC boxes. He said the effort was his first step to¬ ward a Fibre Channel SAN. Thomas Lahive, an analyst at Dataquest in Westboro, Mass., said EMC’s Volume Logix an¬ nouncement is the first of its kind among the major disk ar¬ ray suppliers. “It will make EMC’s penetration of the NT- based SAN market much easi¬ er,” he said. 3Com said it plans to release both a Fibre Channel hub and a Source: Dataquest, San Jose, Calif. server host adapter in the first quarter of next year. Developed through partnerships with Fibre Channel veterans such as Gad- zoox Networks Inc. in San Jose, Calif., the products will start 3Com’s new StorageConnect line and work with 3Com’s Transcend network manage¬ ment software. The goal is to integrate all aspects of LAN, WAN and SAN management. Mark Purdy, chief technology officer at Bloomberg LP’s stock- ticker plant in New York, called the announcement “critical.” “I think people are looking to mix IP and SAN protocols on the same physical layer, and splicing these two together is a nasty subject,” Purdy said. “We’ll need experienced compa¬ nies to help untangle the mess.” Lahive said the 3Com news means “users can now capital¬ ize the ‘N’ in ‘SAN.’ ”□ Introducing DateWizard a everyday tool for a not so standard problem DateWizard FIs Help 2000/01/01 SAT CCYY/MM/DD * 1998/12/31 THU CCYY/MM/DD 366D 2000/122 MON CCYY/DDD + 25W HOL: Calendar f> HEX 9 DEC CTORO • GRE CCYYDDD ~fflAV 4 5 6 ■» JUL AUS 5fJ>~ 1 2 3 = f act ' NOV ' DEC 0 <-_ C F DATEWIZARD fast, accurate date calculations for year 2000 testing efforts $39.95 H Data Dimensions' i Data Dimensions, Inc.. 1998.

The No. i consumer inducement isn’t better security or more user-friendly sites, according to a survey by Jupiter Communications Inc. and NFO World¬ wide Inc. It’s lower prices. In fact, the 77% of Internet surfers who haven’t bought anything online said better discounts could persuade them to buy. Sixty-five percent cited more se¬ curity, followed by ease of finding items (35%), comparative product data (30%) and easier ordering (15%). But that doesn’t mean Web sellers should slash prices across the board, said Evan Cohen, a research director at Jupiter in New York. “We recommend strategic discounting,” he said. That’s similar to retailing in the physical world, where an electronics store might slash prices on music CDs to get consumers through the door. Targeted discounts have proved very effective at Garden Escape Inc., said CEO Cliff Sharpies. The company offers free gardening information as well as products for sale. In one promotion, Garden Escape selected registered members who regu¬ larly visited the site but hadn’t bought anything and offered them a $20 dis¬ count for a first purchase. More than 20% of those members then placed an order — a huge response for a direct- marketing campaign — and some have already made repeat purchases. Features that could convince online window-shoppers to buy something: Better prices 77% More security 65% Easier-to-find items 35% Comparative information 30% Easier to order 15% Faster delivery 14% Better presentation 12% Nothing 6% Base: Survey of 3,500 youths and adults; multiple responses allowed Source: Jupiter Communications Inc., NFO Worldwide Inc., both in New York Garden Escape in Austin, Texas, is now tracking those newly acquired buyers to determine their “lifetime value” to the site, Sharpies said. Garden Escape also discovered that many first-time buyers were calling for help with ordering because the process was too complex. But the $20 discount had encouraged them to try to learn it. \"That was a real eye-opener for us,” Sharpies said. Garden Escape subse¬ quently overhauled its online ordering. Daily specials at IBaby.com “do drive trial purchases,” said Elaine Rubin, chairman of baby products retailer I Baby Inc. in New York. “But there are other ways. How do you do it in the real world? With some kind of offer. It doesn’t have to be price.” It can be con¬ venience — a big plus for new parents — selection or a service such as gift reminders, she said. Clothing retailer Eddie Bauer Inc. in Redmond, Wash., determined early on that it would keep prices consistent across its stores, catalogs and Web site, but its site does have a small “weekly special” bargain area. □ Look what happened when Lexmark pot a clearer picture of their business. Recently, Lexmark International, a leading provider of printing solutions, made a decision that made everyone a lot happier. They decided to integrate every stage of their supply chain to assure customers consistent, on-time product delivery. The solution? Customer focused processes and enterprise software from J.D. Edwards. Says Dr. Paul J. Curlander, President and Chief Executive Officer, “Keeping promises and delivering the best solutions is what Lexmark is about. J.D. Edwards is about the same thing. Every contact we had with them was with people who were committed to making Lexmark a success.\" And that it is. The J.D. Edwards solution is key to helping Lexmark make major improvements in customer responsiveness, paving the way for long-term relationships. Things keep looking better for Lexmark and its customers. Deliveries have improved three fold. Cycle times have been reduced by over 701. As Dr. Curlander says, “Because J.D.

IS join¬ ing a growing number of multi- bill ion-dollar manufacturers testing the electronic-commerce waters and selling directly to con¬ sumers. But like most, the company is still cautious about preserving lucrative, long-term relationships with retailers. “You’ve always got to remember who brought you to the dance,” said Angela Kapp, vice president of special markets and new media at the New York cosmetics firm. Estee Lauder’s upscale Bobbi Brown line launched an online store last month, but the site doesn’t bypass department stores. Instead, Neiman Marcus Group, the Dallas-based retail chain, will handle all shipping and customer service for the Bobbi Brown site. But when the larger Clinique brand debuts its commerce site this month, Clinique will over¬ see its own shipments. Clinique originally planned to parcel out orders to various ma¬ jor department stores but scotched that idea because of customer-service concerns and problems with exchanging or¬ der information. “Data transfer is never an easy issue. When you add mul¬ tiple partners, it becomes more complicated,” Kapp said. Different Estee Lauder's Angela Kapp: Pre¬ serving retailer relationships is key as most now buy products from more than one store. Channel conflicts are crop¬ ping up across the Internet, dis¬ rupting everything from auto dealer territories to stores facing first-time competi¬ tion from manufac¬ turers of the prod¬ ucts they sell. In the case of the cosmetics and skin- care industry, the retail channel is crucial because the sales associates be¬ hind the counter not only advise women on prod¬ ucts, but often also persuade them to buy more than they had planned. Clinique will start selling products on its Web site be¬ cause many users were asking to buy online, according to Kapp. But the site will continue to work to drive foot traffic into the stores. 7’ And, when asked if Clin¬ ique’s popular free gift offers will be available on the Web, Kapp responded, “Over my dead body.” KIND TO RETAILERS “Channel conflict will continue to be a real issue for these kinds of companies,” said Nicole Van¬ derbilt, an analyst at Jupiter Communications Inc. in New York. But “Clinique is being very careful not to threaten their re¬ tailers ... by not offering gift promotions on their own site and by not advertising the on¬ line storefront off-line,” she said. Avon Products Inc. faced an¬ other type of channel issue when it started selling products online last year, because much of its business comes from local sales representatives. Avon accommodated the sales representatives in part by creating special areas of the site for them, with updated infor- S200M $230M 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 Source: Jupiter Communications Inc., New York mation and places to exchange messages with other reps. In addition, consumers can use the site to request a visit from an Avon representative. Avon.com has 300,000 regis¬ tered users and receives 1,500 to 2,000 E-mail messages a month. “It’s a small percentage of our business today, but it’s growing rather exponentially,” said Adrian Dessi, senior direc¬ tor of direct access at Avon in New York. Jupiter predicts that, overall, online sales of health and beau¬ ty products will rise from $8 million this year to $230 mil¬ lion by 2000. □ Consumer Reports bucks Web trend ► Subscribers ponying up for online information By Sharon Machlis Consumers can use Avon's site to request a visit 7 : from a local stores have varied data formats for handling or¬ ders, and de¬ vising a sys¬ tem to accommodate them all was a challenge. Retailers ultimately un¬ derstood the problem, according to Kapp. In fact, Macys.com will launch a revamped shopping site this fall that will sell Clin¬ ique products. “In the long run, people will buy Clinique from more than one site,” Kapp predicted, just despite the widespread belief that people won’t pay for infor¬ mation on the Web, Consumer Reports Online said it has signed up 180,000 subscribers in its first year. “If the information is really good and people really want it, that’s certainly going to make it attractive,” said Nancy Macagno, director of new media at Con¬ sumers Union, the Yonkers, N.Y., nonprofit organization that publishes Consumer Reports. “If they want it in their real lives, [they'll pay for it]. That’s true in any medium.” POPULAR SITE The site is adding about 5,700 subscribers per week, making it one of the most popular sub¬ scription services on the Web (unvw.ConsumerReports.org). Consumer Reports magazine offers articles, advice, recom¬ mendations and product test re¬ sults. Online subscribers pay $2.95 per month or $24 annually; for those who already receive the print magazine, online sub¬ scriptions cost $19 annually. In general, it hasn’t been easy to persuade people to buy news online. “There aren’t too many success sto¬ ries in people charging for con¬ tent,” said Patrick Keane, an analyst at Jupiter Communi¬ cations Inc. in New York. Consumer Reports’ proprietary test data on high-ticket items such as cars and home appli¬ ances is attractive to people who like to use the In¬ ternet for researching major purchases. A few other specialized sites also are making inroads. The Wall Street Journal Inter¬ active Edition, considered the genre’s biggest success, has more than 250,000 paying sub- Consumer Reports' Nancy Macagno said people will pay for good content scribers. Analysts say the finan¬ cial news area is one of the most promising because in¬ vestors have been willing to pay money to potentially earn more money. Another niche player attract¬ ing paying users is Ancestry.com Inc. in Orem, Utah, which charges $59.95 per year for genealogy re¬ searchers to access multiple historical names databases. The company doesn’t release sub¬ scription figures, although one out¬ side estimate pegs them at around 50,000. Consumer Reports Online isn’t breaking even yet, but it has been beneficial in generating new business for the organization, Macagno said. “There’s a very small overlap with our magazine subscribers. We believe we are attracting new people to Consumer Re¬ ports,” she said. □ HP reorg to focus on visibility At $15 billion and 40,000 employees, Hewlett-Packard Co.'s new Enterprise Com¬ puting Solutions Organiza¬ tion, which merges its hard¬ ware and software divisions, is larger than Sun Microsys¬ tems Inc. It will be responsi¬ ble for delivering integrated hardware, software and con¬ sultancy services targeted at markets such as enterprise resource plan¬ ning and Web commerce, said Ann Liv¬ ermore, the group’s vice president and general man¬ ager. Liver¬ more, 40, discussed the reor¬ ganization with senior editor Jaikumar Vijayan. On the task of integrat¬ ing HP's highly auto¬ nomous business units: One of the most important things is getting the balance between what needs to be centralized and what need not be centralized. We will continue to have a lot of [unit-level] decision-making decentralized . . . but it is im¬ portant to have some of the business planning and some of the marketing strategies and outbound marketing messages be more central¬ ized in execution. On making HP a more visible industry player: One of our objectives is to get more mind share around our products. . . . You are go¬ ing to see us get a lot more aggressive and clear in our messages. You will definitely see people like myself mak¬ ing sure that HP has a more visible presence. On what drove the reor¬ ganization: When you’ve got different groups that work a lot to¬ gether, have a common cus¬ tomer base, common set of competitors, common prod¬ ucts and services . . . then you should manage them as one business. It [allows you] to put all your wood behind one arrow. □ J Instinct may lead you to the right server OS. Or, you can always fall back on data, reason, and logic. Microsoft® Windows NT® Server 4.0 was released two years ago. Today, 61% of networked companies in the U.S. are using it. And, Windows NT Server 4.0 currently outsells all other server operating systems. Why? First, it covers the basics. Many companies choose Windows NT Server for great file and print. In fact, LAN administrators pick it 3 to 1 over NetWare for their basic LAN OS. But many companies also rely on Windows NT Server for much more than file and print. That’s why it’s called a multipurpose server OS, and why research shows that more companies choose it for their intranet platforms and commercial Internet platforms.

Although a plethora of health-related sites have sprout¬ ed in the past year, most physi¬ cians and hospitals have yet to move online. “The reality is that most of us are playing catch-up on some basic systems that we’ve ne¬ glected,” said Terry Wilk, CIO of Fairview Health System, which operates two hospitals in Cleve¬ land. Wilk said Fairview has a basic Web site, which “hasn’t received many hits.” But building a By Nancy Dillon removable-storage vendor Sy¬ Quest Technology Inc. an¬ nounced last week that it is re¬ moving itself from the industry it helped create. Officials said the Fremont, Calif., company had suspended operations and is considering bankruptcy. The company asked the Nasdaq Stock Market Inc. to halt trading of its stock, which last closed at 34 cents, down from a 52-week high of $4.44. Some industry watchers said the death knell first sounded in August, when SyQuest let go 80% of its workforce. “SyQuest’s problems started three years ago when the Zip more elaborate site — which could highlight the hospital’s services and staff and provide general health information — is out of the question for at least the next two years, he said. NOT HIGHEST PRIORITY Aside from completing year 2000 work, the bulk of the hos¬ pital’s information technology budget is going toward network upgrades, Wilk said. Many hospitals are in the same position, dealing with lim¬ ited budgets and antiquated sys¬ tems. That presents a challenge because, increasingly, patients are turning to the Web when selecting a physician, research¬ ing a disease or looking for a first came out,” said Fara Yale, an analyst at Dataquest in San Jose, Calif. SyQuest tried to re¬ act by pricing its EZ135 hard drive to compete against the Zip floppy drive from Iomega Corp. in Roy, Utah, “but essentially they were selling it at a loss,” Yale said. She said other factors con¬ tributing to SyQuest’s failure in¬ cluded an industrywide over¬ supply of fixed, rigid disk drives; the rise of rewritable CDs; and SyQuest’s failure to establish a strong brand name. Jim Porter, an analyst at Disk- Trend Inc. in Mountain View, Calif., said SyQuest is the casu¬ alty of an overhyped and under¬ delivered market. Only about patient-related support group. According to the U.S. Depart¬ ment of Health and Human Services, the number of people using the Internet for health care information rose 39% from 15.6 million last year to 21.7 million this year. At an Intel Corp. press con¬ ference about health care and the Internet, former U.S. Sur¬ geon General C. Everett Koop said the Web will result in a power shift in medicine. “In the past, the doctor was the author¬ ity, and the patient was passive,” Koop said. “Now, the patient comes to the doctor with infor¬ mation he has collected on the Internet.” But even some of the nation’s top medical facilities are strug¬ gling in the Net arena.
