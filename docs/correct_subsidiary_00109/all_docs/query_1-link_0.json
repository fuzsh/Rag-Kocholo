        "text": "LinkExchange was a popular Internet advertising cooperative, similar in function to a webring, originally known as Internet Link Exchange or ILE.\n\nIt was founded in March 1996 by 23-year-old Harvard graduates Tony Hsieh (who later went on to invest in and become the CEO of Zappos) and Sanjay Madan.[1] Ali Partovi later joined them as a third partner in August 1996.[2] Alfred Lin dropped out of his Stanford PhD program to join as CFO.[3] In November 1996, when the company consisted of about 10 people, it moved from Hsieh's and Madan's living room to an office[4] in San Francisco. In May 1997, the company received US$3 million in funding from Sequoia Capital.[5]\n\nIn June 1998, LinkExchange acquired MerchantPlanet, an early shopping cart and credit card application.[6] That same month it also acquired Submit It! Inc., developers of Submit It!, ClickTrade, and ListBot.[7]\n\nIn November 1998, when LinkExchange had 100 employees, it was acquired by Microsoft[8] for US$265 million.[9]\n\nLinkExchange stopped taking new applications on November 15, 2006. On June 4, 2007 it stopped serving banners.[10]"
