has adopted the Microsoft Corporation Savings Plus 401(k) Plan effective January 1, 1987, for the exclusive benefit of its employees. The Microsoft Corporation Savings Plus 401(k) Plan is restated by this document to incorporate prior amendments since the last restatement, effective March 25, 1999. [Note: As explained in the preceding sentence, the last restatement of the Plan was as of March 25, 1999. This document is an updated restatement, and incorporates the amendments to the Plan that were adopted by Microsoft Corporation between March 25, 1999 and July 1, 2000.] 1\n\nARTICLE I DEFINITIONS ----------- The following words shall have the following meanings unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. 1.1 BENEFICIARY means a person designated by a participant, or by this ----------- Plan if there is no effective designation, to receive benefits payable under this Plan in the event of the participant's death. 1.2 CODE means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. ---- 1.3 COMPENSATION is defined and limited as set forth in Appendix I, ------------ attached hereto and incorporated herein. 1.4 EMPLOYEE means any common law employee of the employer who receives -------- remuneration for personal services rendered to the employer, and any \"leased employee\" as defined in Code (S) 414(n)(2). For purposes of this Section 1.4, a \"`leased employee' as defined in Code (S) 414(n)(2)\" means any person who is not an employee of the employer (as defined in Plan Section 1.6, \"recipient\") and who provides services to such recipient if (i) such services are provided pursuant to an agreement between the recipient and any other person (\"leasing organization\"), (ii) such person has performed such services for the recipient (or for the recipient and related persons) on a substantially full-time basis for a period of at least 1 year, and (iii) such services are performed under primary direction or control by the recipient. The definition in the preceding sentence shall be interpreted by applying the definition of \"leased employee\" under Code (S) 414(n)(2) and any Treasury Regulations thereunder. 1.5 ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEE means a regular employee of the employer who ----------------- satisfies the eligibility requirements of section 2.1. For purposes of this Plan, a \"regular employee\" of the 2\n\nemployer is an employee who is in an approved headcount \"regular\" employment position with the employer and on the employer's U.S. payroll. An approved headcount \"regular\" employment position is one that is (1) authorized in writing during the annual or out-of-cycle budgeting process as a \"regular\" employment position and approved by an officer of Microsoft (or by a Regional Director for positions in subsidiaries of Microsoft) and (2) reflected on the official human resources database of Microsoft or one of its subsidiaries as a \"regular\" employment position (e.g., \"hourly regular\" or \"salaried regular\"). For example, a worker who is reflected on the human resources database as \"contingent\" or an \"agency temp\" is not in an approved headcount \"regular\" employment position even though the contingent or agency temp position was authorized as part of Microsoft's budgeting process. An employee is on an employer's U.S. payroll if the employee is paid from a payroll department of the employer where such payroll department is located within the United States of America, and the employer withholds U.S. employment taxes (e.g., income tax, FICA) from the employee's pay. Under no circumstances are the payroll departments of the employer's foreign branches and subsidiaries treated as U.S. payroll departments of the employer for purposes of this Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following persons are not eligible employees and are not eligible to participate in this Plan even if they meet the definition of regular employee of the employer: a. interns and visiting researchers; b. cooperatives; c. apprentices; d. nonresident aliens with no U.S. source income; 3\n\ne. employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement resulting from negotiations in which retirement benefits were the subject of good faith bargaining and participation in this Plan was not provided for; f. leased employees. For purposes of this Section 1.5(f), a leased employee includes any person who provides services to the employer (as defined in Plan Section 1.6, which in the rest of this Section 1.5 may also be referred to as \"recipient\" or \"recipient employer\") pursuant to an agreement between such recipient and any other person (\"leasing organization\"), regardless of (i) the length of time the person has performed such services for the recipient (or for the recipient and related persons), (ii) whether or not the person is an employee of the recipient, (iii) whether or not the person has performed such services for the recipient (or for the recipient and related persons) on a part-time or full-time basis, and (iv) whether or not the person performed services under the primary direction or control by the recipient. This definition of leased employee includes, without limitation, \"leased employees\" as defined in Code (S) 414(n)(2) and any Treasury Regulations thereunder. g. temporary workers engaged through or employed by temporary or leasing agencies, irrespective of the length of time that the workers perform or are expected to perform services at or for the recipient employer, and even if the workers are, or may be reclassified by the courts, the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") or the U.S. Department of Labor (\"DOL\") as, employees of the recipient employer; 4\n\nh. temporary employees of the employer. For purposes of this Plan, a temporary employee of the employer is an employee of the employer who is hired by the employer to work on a specific project or series of projects which in the aggregate is not expected to exceed six (6) months; and i. workers who hold themselves out to the recipient employer as being independent contractors, or as being employed by another company while providing services to the recipient employer, even if the workers are, or may be reclassified by the courts, the IRS or the DOL as, employees of the recipient employer. 1.6 EMPLOYER means MICROSOFT CORPORATION and any subsidiary or affiliate -------- --------------------- of Microsoft Corporation which, with MICROSOFT CORPORATION's approval, elects to adopt the Plan for its employees. Employers maintaining the Plan are listed in Appendix II, attached hereto and incorporated herein. No participating employers (other than Microsoft Corporation and its delegates) shall have discretionary authority over the Plan, including, without limitation, the authority to amend the Plan and appoint fiduciaries. The Plan Administrator (and his or her delegates) has discretionary authority under the Plan as provided elsewhere in this Plan. For purposes of applying to this Plan Code (S)(S) 401, 410, 411, 414, 415 and 416, which sections relate to tax-qualified plans generally, to minimum participation standards, to minimum vesting standards, to compensation, to limitations on benefits and contributions, and to top-heavy requirements under qualified retirement plans, all employees of businesses under common control, as defined in Code (S)(S) 414(b) and (c), employees of affiliated service groups under Code (S) 414(m), and employees of any group of employers who must be aggregated and treated as one employer pursuant to Code (S) 414(o), shall be considered to be employed by the employer. 5\n\n1.7 ERISA means the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as ----- amended. 1.8 PARTICIPANT means an employee who meets the eligibility requirements ----------- of Article II and who has entered the Plan. An employee shall be considered a participant as long as one or more accounts are maintained under this Plan on his or her behalf. 1.9 PLAN means the MICROSOFT CORPORATION SAVINGS PLUS 401(k) PLAN. ---- 1.10 PLAN ADMINISTRATOR means the 401(k) Administrative Committee, which ------------------ shall consist of the following three positions at Microsoft Corporation: Vice President, Human Resources Deputy Chief Financial Officer Tax and Audit Vice President Any references in this Plan to the Plan Administrator as \"he\", \"she\", \"him\" or \"her\" or references to \"his\" or \"her\" with respect to the Plan Administrator shall be deemed to refer to the 401(k) Administrative Committee or a member of the 401(k) Administrative Committee, as appropriate under the circumstances. 1.11 PLAN YEAR means the twelve month period beginning January 1 and --------- ending December 31. 1.12 TRUST FUND means the assets of the trust established and maintained ---------- according to the provisions of this Plan. 1.13 TRUSTEE means any individual, life insurance company, bank or trust ------- company or a combination of the foregoing, which the employer has designated to manage and invest the assets of the Plan. 6\n\nARTICLE II ELIGIBILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN PLAN ---------------------------------- 2.1 ELIGIBILITY AND ENTRY DATE. Each eligible employee who is 18 years of -------------------------- age or older shall be eligible to participate in this Plan except as provided in this Article II. The eligible employee shall be eligible to elect to defer a percentage of his or her compensation on the first entry date occurring after the date the eligibility requirements (e.g., meeting the definition of an eligible employee in Section 1.5 and being at least 18 years of age) are met. The participant's salary deferrals shall commence with the payroll period beginning on the first day of the month that falls after the participant has properly completed and submitted an enrollment application and such application has been processed by the Plan Administrator and the employer's payroll department. It may take several days after an employee becomes an eligible employee before the employee will be able to enroll in the Plan. The Plan Administrator shall establish the enrollment procedures (e.g., require on-line enrollment) from time to time in its sole discretion. 2.2 REEMPLOYMENT. If a former plan participant is reemployed as an ------------ eligible employee, that person shall immediately renew participation in the plan as of his or her date of rehire. 2.3 ELECTION AGAINST PARTICIPATION. Any eligible employee may elect not ------------------------------ to participate in the Plan at any time for any reason in writing signed by the eligible employee, a copy of which is delivered to the employer. 2.4 ENTRY DATES. Plan entry dates shall be the first day of each month. ----------- 7\n\nARTICLE III EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS ---------------------- 3.1 ELECTION TO DEFER. Each participant may elect, in the manner provided ----------------- by the Plan Administrator, to contribute from 1% to 15% of each of his or her compensation payments to a salary deferral account under the Plan, except that the aggregate of such contributions shall not for the plan year exceed the annual limitation on elective deferrals under Code (S) 402(g) in any taxable year, which limitation is increased as permitted by Internal Revenue Service publication to reflect cost-of-living adjustments ($9,500 for 1997). The employer may, from time to time, change the percentage of salary that may be deferred. Except as authorized by the Plan Administrator, all such contributions shall be by payroll reduction. Contributions shall be transferred to the trust fund on the earliest date by which they can reasonably be segregated from the employer's general assets, but in no event later than the 15th business day of the month following the month in which the employer receives or withholds the employee contributions. For purposes of determining the amount which may be deferred, only compensation earned while the participant is an eligible employee and making salary deferral contributions to the plan shall be considered. A participant may not defer more than 15% of any paycheck or other compensation payment. The 15% maximum limit on deferrals is applied per pay period not to the participant's annual compensation nor his or her total compensation earned while making salary deferral contributions to the Plan. 3.2 DEFERRAL ELECTION DATES. Upon reemployment, an employee may elect to ----------------------- contribute as of the day he or she is eligible to enter the Plan. All other employees or participants, including employees entering the plan initially, may elect to contribute effective as of the first day of the month that falls after the employee or participant has properly completed 8\n\nand submitted an enrollment application and such application has been processed by the Plan Administrator and the employer's payroll department. It may take several days after an employee becomes an eligible employee before the employee will be able to enroll in the Plan. The Plan Administrator shall establish the enrollment procedures (e.g., require on-line enrollment) from time to time in its sole discretion. Participants may change their contribution percentage effective as of the first day of any month subsequent to the date they request the change, provided, however, that the first month in which the change may apply shall not be earlier than the first month in which the change to the participant's payroll withholding can reasonably be made. An election to contribute may be made on any date prior to the effective date of the election, in the manner provided by the Plan Administrator. 3.3 TERMINATING AN ELECTION TO DEFER. A participant may terminate an -------------------------------- election to contribute as of the first day of any month, provided notice of termination has been given by the fifteenth day of the previous month in the manner provided by the Plan Administrator. If an employee terminates an election to contribute, he or she must wait until the next entry date before being eligible again to elect to contribute to the Plan. 3.4 DISTRIBUTION OF EXCESS DEFERRALS. Notwithstanding any other provision -------------------------------- of the Plan, excess deferrals (amounts in excess of the annual limitation on elective deferrals under Code (S) 402(g), as increased by a cost of living factor) and income allocable thereto may be distributed no later than April 15 to participants who claim for the preceding calendar year such excess deferrals under two or more plans or to participants who have such excess deferrals under this Plan. A participant may allocate excess deferrals to this Plan by submitting to the Plan Administrator no later than March 1 a statement specifying the excess deferral amount for the preceding calendar year and stating that, if such amount is not 9\n\ndistributed, such excess deferral, when added to amounts deferred under other plans, exceeds the applicable annual limit. The excess deferrals distributed to a participant with respect to a calendar year shall be adjusted for income and, if there is a loss allocable to the excess deferral, shall in no event be less than the lesser of the participant's account under the Plan or the participant's elective deferrals for the calendar year. 10\n\nARTICLE IV EMPLOYER MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS AND FORFEITURES ----------------------------------------------- 4.1 EMPLOYER MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS. The employer shall contribute funds ------------------------------- to the Plan, from its current or retained profits, and use forfeitures to match a portion of each of a participant's salary deferral contributions. The employer contribution shall match 50% of each of a participant's salary deferral contributions up to six percent of the participant's compensation for the pay period for which the participant's salary deferral is made, for a maximum employer matching contribution of three percent of the compensation paid to the participant for such pay period. The matching contribution shall be allocated to the participant's employer contribution account. The employer may from time to time change the amount of the employer matching contribution, provided any decrease in the matching contribution formula must be effective only for matching elective deferrals after the date of change. Total employer contributions for any plan year shall not exceed the maximum amount which is deductible by the employer for federal income tax purposes. The employer contribution shall be transferred to the trust fund at such times as the employer determines, but such contributions shall in no event be transferred to the trust fund later than the time prescribed by law for the employer to obtain a federal income tax deduction for the plan year for which the contribution is made. Employer contributions shall be credited to participants' employer contribution accounts as of the date of receipt by the plan. For purposes of determining the amount of matching contributions a participant will receive, only compensation earned while the participant is an eligible employee and making salary deferral contributions to the Plan shall be considered. The 3% limit on employer matching contributions is applied to each paycheck given or other compensation payment made to the participant. The 3% limit on matching contributions is applied per pay 11\n\nperiod, and not to the participant's annual compensation nor his or her total compensation earned while making salary deferral contributions to the Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any participant whose salary deferrals cease because the Code Section 402(g) limit is reached, and not because the Participant terminated his or her election to defer, shall have his or her compensation earned after the Code Section 402(g) limit was reached considered when determining the maximum amount of matching contributions to be allocated to his or her account. Matching contributions will continue to be made to such participant's account until the match equals the lesser of 50% of his or her deferrals or 3% of the participant's compensation earned while the participant's salary deferral election was in effect (including compensation earned after deferrals reached the applicable 402(g) limit). The amount of the matching contributions made for pay periods occurring after the participant's salary deferral amount reached the 402(g) limit shall be calculated by multiplying the lesser of (i) 3% or (ii) one half of the participant's salary deferral election which was in effect when the 402(g) limit was reached, by his or her compensation for each pay period occurring after the limit was reached. 4.2 ALLOCATION OF FORFEITURES. As of the end of each plan year, ------------------------- forfeitures which have become available for allocation during such year because of the completion of benefit distributions to terminated participants or terminated participants' completion of a one-year period of severance pursuant to Section 5.6 shall be used first to restore previously forfeited amounts to the employer contribution accounts of former employees who are reemployed before sustaining five consecutive one-year periods of severance. Any remaining forfeiture amounts shall be used to reduce the employer matching contribution for the subsequent plan year. While this Plan is a multiple employer plan (as described in Code (S)413(c)), forfeitures with respect to employees who terminate employment with one employer (as defined in Treasury Regulation 12\n\n(S)1.413-2(a)(2)) shall be used first to restore previously forfeited amounts to the employer contribution accounts of former employees of such employer who are reemployed before sustaining five consecutive one-year periods of severance. Any remaining amounts from such forfeitures shall be used to reduce the employer matching contribution for the employees of such employer for the subsequent plan year and, if any forfeitures remain after the employer matching contributions for that employer are made for such plan year, such remaining forfeitures shall be used to reduce the employer matching contributions of other employers in the Plan. 13\n\nARTICLE V VESTING - YEARS OF SERVICE -------------------------- 5.1 EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS. Each participant shall be 100% vested in all ---------------------- amounts in his or her salary deferral account. 5.2 EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS. A participant whose employment is terminated ---------------------- on or after reaching age 65, whose employment is terminated because of a total and permanent disability, or who dies while employed, shall be 100% vested in all amounts in his or her employer contribution account. All other participants who terminate shall be entitled to the vested percentage of their employer contribution account determined in accordance with the following schedule: Years of Service Vested Percentage Forfeited Percentage ---------------- ----------------- -------------------- Less than 2 0% 100% 2 or more years 100% 0% In computing years of service, all of an employee's years of service shall be taken into account, except that if an employee has five or more consecutive one- year periods of severance, years of service after such period of severance shall not be taken into account for purposes of determining the nonforfeitable percentage of the employee's accrued benefit derived from employer contributions which accrued before the period of severance. Preparticipation service with certain companies as set forth in Appendix II, attached hereto and incorporated herein, shall be counted toward vesting. Effective July 8, 1997, an employee who (i) first becomes employed by Microsoft Corporation (\"Microsoft\") or one of its affiliates (within the meaning of Code Sections 414(b), (c), (m) or (o)) on or after July 8, 1997, and (ii) was previously employed by a company (or a trade or business thereof, hereinafter \"Former Employer\") which was acquired by or merged with 14\n\nMicrosoft (or an affiliate of Microsoft), shall receive credit for his or her period of service with such Former Employer towards satisfying the vesting service requirements of this Plan, provided, however, that the credit shall only be given to those employees whose employment with Microsoft or one of its affiliates is connected with Microsoft's (or its affiliate's) acquisition of or merger with such Former Employer. This vesting service credit shall be granted effective as of the effective date of the closure of the acquisition of the Former Employer by, or the merger of the Former Employer with, Microsoft (or its affiliate). For informational purposes, the list of Former Employers for which vesting service credit is granted after July 8, 1997 shall be added to Appendix II from time to time, but pursuant to this Section 5.2, the grant of such service credit shall be effective regardless of whether or when the name of the Former Employer is added to Appendix II. In the event a plan of the Former Employer is merged into this Plan, any service credit shall be as specified in Appendix V hereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no vesting service credit shall be granted under this paragraph for service with any Former Employer to the extent that this Plan is amended, prior to the closure of the acquisition of or merger with such Former Employer, to expressly deny service credit with respect to service with such Former Employer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each participant with a positive employer contribution account balance in the Plan on or after March 2, 2000 shall be 100% vested in all amounts that are in his or her employer contribution account on or after March 2, 2000. 5.3 YEARS OF SERVICE. An employee's years of service at any date shall ---------------- equal the number of years, including fractional portions of years, which have elapsed between the date the employee first performed an hour of service, or first performed an hour of service upon reemployment, and the date a period of severance begins. If a period of severance is less than twelve months, the period of severance shall be included in determining years of service. 15\n\n5.4 HOUR OF SERVICE. An hour of service means each hour for which an --------------- employee is paid or entitled to payment for the performance of duties for the employer. 5.5 PERIOD OF SEVERANCE. A period of severance is a period which begins ------------------- on the earlier of (i) the date the employee quits, is discharged, retires, dies; or (ii) the first anniversary of the date the employee is absent from service for any other reason, such as disability leave, vacation, or leave of absence; and which ends when the employee performs an hour of service upon reemployment. However, if an employee is absent from employment for maternity or paternity reasons, the period of severance shall begin on the second anniversary of the first date of such absence. The period between the first and second anniversaries of the first date of absence from work is neither a year or fractional year of service, nor a period of severance. An absence for maternity or paternity reasons includes an absence because of the following: pregnancy of the individual, birth of a child of the individual, placement of a child with the individual in connection with the adoption of such child by such individual or caring for such child for a period beginning immediately following such birth or placement. 5.6 FORFEITURES. If, prior to incurring a one-year period of severance, ----------- a participant who is zero percent vested in his or her employer contribution account receives a distribution of his or her entire vested interest in the Plan (e.g., salary deferrals, rollovers) on or due to his or her termination of participation in the Plan, the participant's entire employer contribution account shall be forfeited as of the date of such distribution. If a terminated participant who is zero percent vested in his or her employer contribution account does not receive a distribution of his or her entire vested interest in the Plan prior to incurring a one-year period of severance, his or her entire employer contribution account shall be forfeited as of a date chosen by the Plan Administrator which is on or after the date the participant completes a one- 16\n\nyear period of severance. Forfeited amounts shall be transferred to a separate forfeiture suspense account and made available for allocation as set forth in Article IV. If a terminated participant whose employer contribution account has been forfeited due to either the receipt of a distribution or the occurrence of a one-year period of severance is reemployed before sustaining five consecutive one-year periods of severance, any amount forfeited shall be restored to his or her employer contribution account, unadjusted by any gains or losses. If a reemployed participant's forfeiture was due to receipt of a distribution, the participant shall have neither the right nor obligation to repay the distributed amount to the Plan. Restorations of accounts shall be funded first from forfeitures held in the suspense account, and if such forfeiture amounts in the suspense account are not sufficient to restore the accounts, then from additional Company contributions. While this Plan is a multiple employer plan, the employer with the primary responsibility to make any Company contributions that are required to restore a rehired employee's account shall be the employer from which the employee terminated prior to being rehired. Upon the complete termination of the Plan, any terminated participant who, prior to the Plan's date of termination, had not (i) incurred five consecutive one-year periods of severance, nor (ii) received a distribution of his or her entire vested interest in the Plan, shall have any amount which was forfeited due to the prior occurrence of a one-year period of severance restored, unadjusted by any gains or losses, and such restored amount shall be nonforfeitable. 17\n\nARTICLE VI PARTICIPANTS' ACCOUNTS AND INVESTMENTS -------------------------------------- 6.1 INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNTS. The trustee shall maintain records to show ------------------- the interest in the Plan of each participant and former participant. Such records shall be in the form of individual accounts. When appropriate, a participant shall have two accounts, a salary deferral account and an employer contribution account. The maintenance of individual accounts is only for accounting purposes, and a segregation of the assets of the trust fund to each account shall not be required. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent provided in a written loan policy, a loan made to a participant will be treated as a participant direction of investment. The participant alone shares in any principal and interest paid on the loan, and he or she alone bears any expense or loss incurred in connection with the loan. The Trustee will reflect the participant's loan on his or her account. Distributions and withdrawals made from an account shall be charged to the account as of the date paid. Each participant and former participant shall be advised from time to time, but at least once a year, as to the status of his or her account or accounts. 6.2 INVESTMENT FUNDS. The trust fund shall consist of the following ---------------- investment funds: common stock funds, bond funds, income funds, money market funds, the Microsoft Corporation stock fund, and any other funds or investment vehicles selected by the employer, including without limitation participant directed brokerage accounts. The employer may change the investment funds from time to time. Each participant and former participant shall direct the trustee as to what portion of his or her accounts shall be deposited in each fund (or, in the case of a Participant loan pursuant to Article XIX, what portion of his or her account shall be loaned). If a participant or former participant wishes to utilize more than one investment fund, he or she shall designate the percentage of his or her account balances to be invested in each fund, and the 18\n\npercentages designated shall be in 1% increments. The trust fund may hold qualified employer securities and qualified employer real estate in any amount. The Plan is intended to constitute a plan described in ERISA (S) 404(c), and the fiduciaries of the Plan may be relieved in accordance with ERISA (S) 404(c) of liability for any losses which are the direct and necessary result of investment instructions given by a participant or former participant. 6.3 CHANGING ACCOUNT INVESTMENTS. Up to six times in any plan year, a ---------------------------- participant may change his or her direction as to the funds into which his or her account will be invested. The Plan Administrator may change the number of times that changes may be made, and the procedures for making changes in investment elections, at any time and from time to time. 6.4 PROCEDURES. The Plan Administrator shall adopt such rules and ---------- procedures as it deems advisable with respect to the direction of Plan investments by participants, including without limitation the procedure for allocating and charging fees, expenses or other charges connected with certain investment funds to the accounts of those participants who choose to invest in such funds. Any such rules and procedures shall be applied in a nondiscriminatory manner. 6.5 VALUATION OF ACCOUNTS. As often as directed by the employer, the --------------------- trustee shall value the trust fund assets at fair market value and the Plan Administrator shall adjust the net credit balances in the accounts of participants and former participants, upward or downward, to reflect the allocation to the participant's or former participant's account of investment earnings, gains and losses, expenses paid out of the trust fund, and contributions made and allocated to and distributions and withdrawals from the participant's or former participant's account. In addition, as of the end of the fiscal quarter of each plan year and at such 19\n\nother times as the Plan Administrator shall reasonably determine, the Plan Administrator shall adjust the net credit balances in the accounts of participants and former participants in the trust fund, upward or downward, pro rata, so that the aggregate of such net credit balances will equal the net worth of each investment fund of the trust fund, using fair market values as determined by the trustee and after such net worth for the appropriate investment fund has been reduced by any expenses (to the extent not paid directly by the employer), withdrawals, distributions and transfers chargeable to that investment fund which have been incurred but not yet paid. All determinations made by the trustee with respect to fair market values and net worth shall be made in accordance with generally accepted principles of trust accounting, and such determinations when so made by the trustee shall be conclusive and binding upon all persons having an interest under the Plan. 20\n\nARTICLE VII PAYMENT OF ACCOUNT BALANCES UPON TERMINATION, DEATH, DISABILITY, ---------------------------------------------------------------- QUALIFIED DOMESTIC RELATIONS ORDERS, ------------------------------------ SALE OF TRADE OR BUSINESS ------------------------- 7.1 TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT. Upon termination of employment for any ------------------------- reason other than death or disability, the participant shall elect to receive his or her balances upon termination or upon reaching age 65, or on any date between termination and age 65 at the participant's election, except that if the value of the participant's accounts does not exceed $5,000 (and did not exceed $5,000 at the time of any prior distribution), payment shall be made as soon as practicable after termination. Account balances shall be valued as of the most recent valuation date prior to date of payment and shall be paid in a single cash payment, except that the participant or former participant may elect to receive any or all of the shares allocated to him or her in the Microsoft Corporation stock fund. Account balances shall be distributed no later than 60 days after the latest of (i) the plan year in which the participant terminates or (ii) the plan year in which the participant reaches age 65. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a person's entire interest must be distributed, or must begin to be distributed, no later than the first day of April following the calendar year in which the participant reaches age 70-1/2. Furthermore, benefit payments will not be made to a participant who has a vested account balance greater than $5,000, prior to the participant attaining age 70 1/2 unless and until the participant files a proper claim for benefits with the Plan Administrator. 7.2 PAYMENT AT 59-1/2. A participant may elect to receive a distribution ----------------- of all or a portion of his or her vested account balance or balances under this Plan upon or after reaching age 59-1/2. Payment shall be made in a single cash payment, except that the participant may 21\n\nelect to receive any or all of the shares allocated to him or her in the Microsoft Corporation stock fund. 7.3 PAYMENT OF ACCOUNT BALANCES UPON DEATH. If a participant dies while -------------------------------------- employed, his or her employer contribution account shall be 100% vested. Each participant shall designate a beneficiary or beneficiaries to receive all amounts credited to his or her accounts in the event of the participant's death. The accounts shall be valued as of the most recent valuation date prior to payment and shall be paid to the designated beneficiary or beneficiaries as soon as feasible after the death. Payment shall be made in a single cash payment, except that the beneficiary or beneficiaries may elect to receive any or all of the shares allocated to him or her in the Microsoft Corporation stock fund. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the deceased participant's vested account balance exceeds $5,000 and the designated beneficiary is the participant's spouse, the spouse may elect to delay distribution of the lump sum amount until any date on or before the date the Participant would have been age 65. If the deceased participant's vested account balance exceeds $5,000 and the beneficiary is a designated beneficiary who is not the participant's spouse, the beneficiary may elect to delay distribution of the lump sum amount until any date on or before the end of the calendar year in which the fifth anniversary of the participant's date of death occurs. Beneficiaries who are not designated beneficiaries may not delay distribution of the death benefit. If a participant is married, the participant may not designate a beneficiary other than his or her spouse without the spouse's written consent which has been witnessed by a plan representative or a notary public. If a participant fails to designate a beneficiary, or the participant has no surviving beneficiary, the amounts payable to a married participant shall be distributed to his or her spouse and the benefits of a single participant shall be distributed to his or her estate. 22\n\n7.4 PAYMENT OF ACCOUNT BALANCES UPON DISABILITY. If a participant's ------------------------------------------- employment is terminated prior to retirement because of a total and permanent disability, the employer contribution account shall be 100% vested and payment of the participant's account balances shall be made as soon as practicable. A participant shall be deemed to be totally and permanently disabled if the participant meets the definition of having a total disability under the employer-provided long-term disability plan. The participant's accounts shall be valued as of the most recent valuation date prior to payment and shall be paid in a single cash payment within sixty (60) days after the disability has been established under this section, except that the participant may elect to receive any or all of the shares allocated to him or her in the Microsoft Corporation stock fund. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the value of the disabled participant's accounts exceeds $5,000 (or exceeded $5,000 at the time of a prior distribution), the participant may elect to delay receipt of the balance of his or her accounts until reaching age 65. Notwithstanding the foregoing, benefit payments will not be made to a participant who has a vested account balance greater then $5,000, prior to the participant attaining age 70 1/2 unless and until the participant files a proper claim for benefits. 7.5 EARLY RETIREMENT. Upon reaching age 55, a participant may elect early ---------------- retirement and terminate employment. Each such participant shall receive the value of his or her salary deferral account and the vested portion of his or her employer contribution account, which shall be paid in the time and manner described in Section 7.1. 7.6 DISTRIBUTIONS UNDER QUALIFIED DOMESTIC RELATIONS ORDERS. Distribution ------------------------------------------------------- to an alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order as defined in Code (S) 414(p) may be made at any time, including prior to the participant's attainment of earliest retirement age if the court order specifies distribution at an earlier time or permits an agreement 23\n\nbetween the Plan and the alternate payee to authorize an earlier distribution and the alternate payee consents to the distribution. 7.6.1 Qualified Status of Order. The Plan Administrator shall ------------------------- establish reasonable procedures to determine the qualified status of a domestic relations order. Upon receiving a domestic relations order, the Plan Administrator shall promptly notify the participant and any alternate payee named in the order in writing of the receipt of the order and the Plan's procedures for determining the qualified status of the order. Within a reasonable period of time after receiving the domestic relations order, the Plan Administrator shall determine the qualified status of the order and shall notify the participant and each alternate payee in writing of its determination. The Plan Administrator shall provide notice under this paragraph by mailing to the individual's address specified in the domestic relations order, or in a manner consistent with Department of Labor regulations. 7.6.2 Amounts Payable During Determination Process. If any portion of -------------------------------------------- the participant's nonforfeitable accrued benefit is payable during the period the Plan Administrator is making its determination of the qualified status of the domestic relations order, the Trustee shall make a separate accounting of the amounts payable. If the Plan Administrator determines the order is a qualified domestic relations order within 18 months of the date amounts first are payable following receipt of the order, the amounts shall be payable in accordance with the order. If the Plan Administrator does not make its determination of the qualified status of the order within the 18 month determination period, the amounts shall be payable in the manner in which they would be distributed if the order did not exist. The order shall be applied prospectively if the Plan Administrator determines after the 18 month period that the order is a qualified domestic relations order. 24\n\n7.6.3 Investment of Amounts Payable. To the extent it is not ----------------------------- inconsistent with the provisions of the qualified domestic relations order, any partitioned funds payable to the alternate payee(s) may be invested in a segregated subaccount and may be invested in fixed income investments or, at the direction of the alternate payee(s), in any investment funds available to participants. If an order specifies that the alternate payee is entitled to any portion of the account of a participant who has an outstanding Plan loan, the loan will continue to be held in the participant's account and will not be transferred to an account for the alternate payee. A segregated subaccount shall remain a part of the Trust, but it alone shall share in any income it earns, and it alone shall bear any expense or loss it incurs. The Trustee shall make any payments or distributions to the alternate payee(s) by separate benefit checks or other separate distribution. 7.7 SALE OF TRADE OR BUSINESS. Distributions may also be made in the event -------------------------- of termination of the Plan, or any part thereof, as described in Code (S) 401(k)(a)(A)(i) and the regulations thereunder, or a disposition of the assets of a trade or business or the stock of a subsidiary with respect to employees who continue employment with the acquiring corporation or subsidiary as described in Code (S) 401(k)(10)(A)(ii) and (iii) and the regulations thereunder. In no event may amounts attributable to 401(k) elective deferrals be distributed earlier than upon one of the following events: (a) Retirement, death, disability or separation from service (see Code (S) 401(k)(10)(A)(i)); (b) Termination of this Plan without establishment of a successor plan (see Code (S) 401(k)(10)(A)(i)); (c) The employee's attainment of age 59-1/2; 25\n\n(d) The sale or other disposition by a corporation to an unrelated corporation, which does not maintain this Plan, of substantially all of the assets used in a trade or business, but only with respect to employees who continue employment with the acquiring corporation (see Code (S) 401(k)(10)(A)(ii)); (e) The sale or other disposition by a corporation of its interest in a subsidiary to any unrelated entity which does not maintain this Plan, but only with respect to employees who continue employment with the subsidiary (see Code (S) 401(k)(10)(A)(iii)). 7.8 NOTICE OF RIGHT TO DEFER PAYMENT. A participant whose total account --------------------------------- balances exceed (or have exceeded at the time of a prior distribution) $5,000 shall be given an explanation of the optional forms of benefit available, and of his or her right to defer receipt of distribution. If a participant fails to consent to an immediate distribution, it shall be deemed an election to defer the commencement of payment of any benefit. However, any election to defer the receipt of benefits shall not apply with respect to distributions which are required under Code (S) 401(a)(9). Notice of the rights specified under this Section 7.8 shall be provided no less than 30 days and no more than 90 days before the \"Annuity Starting Date.\" The \"Annuity Starting Date\" is the first day on which all events have occurred which entitle the participant to receive a distribution (e.g., termination of employment, consent to distribution). Distribution may commence less than 30 days after the notice required under Section 1.411(a)-11(c) of the Income Tax Regulations is given if: (A) the plan administrator clearly informs the participant that the participant has a right to a period of at least 30 days after receiving the notice to consider the decision of whether or not to elect a distribution (and, if applicable, a particular distribution option), and 26\n\n(B) the participant, after receiving the notice, affirmatively elects a distribution. Written consent of the participant to the distribution must not be made before the participant receives the notice and must not be made more than 90 days before the Annuity Starting Date. No consent shall be valid if a significant detriment is imposed under the plan on any participant who does not consent to the distribution. Consent to an immediate distribution is not required after the participant has reached age 65 or has died. 7.9 DIRECT ROLLOVER DISTRIBUTIONS. Notwithstanding any provision of the ----------------------------- Plan to the contrary and subject to the following limitations, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the Plan Administrator, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan. Direct rollovers may not be divided among several plans. A participant may elect to receive a distribution partly as a direct rollover and partly in a direct payment to the participant only if the direct rollover amount equals or exceeds $500. The following definitions shall apply to this section 7.9: (a) Eligible Rollover Distribution. An eligible rollover distribution ------------------------------ is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include: (i) any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten years or more; 27\n\n(ii) any mandatory minimum distribution at age 70 1/2 under Code (S) 401(a)(9); and (iii) the portion of any distribution that is not includible in gross income (determined without regard to the exclusion for net unrealized appreciation with respect to employer securities). (b) Eligible Retirement Plan. An eligible retirement plan is an ------------------------ individual retirement account described in Code (S) 408(a), an individual retirement annuity described in Code (S) 408(b) (other than an endowment contract), an annuity plan described in Code (S) 403(a), or a qualified trust described in Code (S) 401(a) of a defined contribution plan, that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. However, in the case of an eligible rollover distribution to the surviving spouse, an eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity. (c) Distributee. A distributee includes an employee or former ----------- employee. In addition, the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse and the employee's or former employee's spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order, as defined in Code (S) 414(p), are distributees with regard to the interest of the spouse or former spouse. 28\n\nARTICLE VIII HARDSHIP WITHDRAWALS -------------------- If a participant has a financial hardship, the participant may withdraw so much of the following amount as is necessary to meet the hardship: (a) his or her salary deferral contributions plus net investment gains and earnings on such deferrals as of December 31, 1988, plus (b) his or her salary deferral contributions made after December 31, 1988, minus (c) any prior withdrawals, distributions, assignments via qualified domestic relations orders, expenses and net investment losses made or incurred with respect to the amounts described in (a) or (b) above. The salary deferral contributions will be valued as of the valuation date on or immediately before the withdrawal. Hardship withdrawals may not be made from net investment gains and earnings which have accrued after December 31, 1988 on salary deferral contributions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a participant who has an outstanding loan from the Plan (or must take such a loan prior to the hardship distribution pursuant to this Article VIII) may not take a hardship distribution in an amount which exceeds 40% of his or her vested account balance. A hardship withdrawal shall be available for any of the following reasons: (a) Medical expenses incurred by the participant, the participant's spouse, or any dependents of the participant or expenses necessary for those persons to obtain medical care; (b) Purchase (excluding mortgage payments) of a principal residence for the participant; 29\n\n(c) Payment of tuition, related educational fees, and room and board expenses, for the next 12 months of post-secondary education for the participant, his or her spouse, children or dependents; (d) Preventing the eviction of the participant from his or her principal residence or foreclosure on the mortgage of the participant's principal residence; or (e) Need due to critical financial emergencies, defined as circumstances of sufficient severity that a participant is confronted by present or impending financial ruin. The need shall be based on the participant's net worth statement, which shall form an objective criterion for determining hardship. A participant who receives a hardship distribution (a) shall not receive a distribution in excess of the participant's immediate and heavy financial need; (b) shall, prior to the distribution, have exercised all vested stock options and received all other distributions and loans available under all plans maintained by the employer; (c) shall not make elective contributions or have nonelective participant contributions made to this Plan or any other retirement plan, stock purchase plan, stock option or similar plan of the employer, until the first January 1 or July 1 following the one-year anniversary of the date the hardship distribution is made; and (d) shall not make contributions to any plan of the employer, including this Plan, for his or her tax year immediately following the tax year in which the hardship distribution was received, in excess of (i) the annual limit applicable under Code (S) 402(g) ($9,500 for 1997), as increased by a cost of living factor, minus 30\n\n(ii) the amount of participant contributions in the tax year of the hardship distribution. Hardship withdrawals may not be taken from a Participant's employer contribution account, rollover account, or acquisition rollover account. Amounts transferred from the plans of other employers pursuant to a plan merger (e.g., see Appendix V to this Plan) or plan-to-plan transfer of plan assets may in some cases by held in the acquisition rollover account, and therefore be unavailable for hardship withdrawals. 31\n\nARTICLE IX LIMITATIONS ON EMPLOYEE AND EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS -------------------------------------------------- 9.1 LIMITATIONS ON TOTAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO ACCOUNTS. Notwithstanding ---------------------------------------------- anything in this Plan to the contrary, the total of employee and employer contributions and forfeitures allocated to a participant's accounts under this and any other employer sponsored defined contribution plan for any year shall not exceed the applicable limits described in Code (S) 415 (e.g., the lesser of (i) 25% of the participant's compensation (as defined in Section 9.9), or (ii) $30,000). Effective March 31, 1988, the year used to determine the limits on annual additions shall be the calendar year. If such additions exceed the limitation, the Plan shall distribute to the participant the participant's elective deferrals to this Plan (within the meaning of Code (S) 402(g)(3)) and any gains attributable thereto to the extent that the distribution would reduce the excess amounts in the participant's account (see Treasury Regulations (S) 1.415-6(b)(6)(iv)). Any remaining excess annual additions to the participant's account for the year shall be used to reduce future employer contributions pursuant to Treasury Regulation (S) 1.415-6(b)(6)(ii). 9.2 AVERAGE ACTUAL DEFERRAL PERCENTAGE TESTS. With respect to participant ---------------------------------------- contributions in a plan year, the actual deferral percentage shall satisfy one of the tests described in (a) or (b) below. (Definitions of words used in the tests are given in Section 9.9.) (a) The average actual deferral percentage for eligible participants who are highly compensated employees for the plan year shall not exceed the average actual deferral percentage for eligible participants who are non-highly compensated employees for the plan year multiplied by 1.25; 32\n\n(b) the average actual deferral percentage for eligible participants who are highly compensated employees for the plan year shall not exceed the average actual deferral percentage for eligible participants who are non-highly compensated employees for the plan year multiplied by 2, provided that the average actual deferral percentage for eligible participants who are highly compensated employees does not exceed the average actual deferral percentage for eligible participants who are non-highly compensated employees by more than two (2) percentage points or such lesser amount as the Secretary of the Treasury shall prescribe to prevent the multiple use of this alternative limitation with respect to any highly compensated employee. 9.3 ELECTIVE DEFERRALS OR QUALIFIED EMPLOYER DEFERRAL CONTRIBUTIONS UNDER --------------------------------------------------------------------- TWO OR MORE PLANS OR ARRANGEMENTS. The actual deferral percentage for any - --------------------------------- eligible participant who is a highly compensated employee for the plan year and who is eligible to have elective deferrals or qualified employer deferral contributions allocated to his account under two or more plans or arrangements described in Code (S) 401(k) that are maintained by the employer or an affiliated employer shall be determined as if all such elective deferrals and qualified employer deferral contributions were made under a single arrangement. 9.4 ELECTIVE DEFERRALS, QUALIFIED EMPLOYER DEFERRAL CONTRIBUTIONS, AND ------------------------------------------------------------------ COMPENSATION OF FAMILY MEMBERS. For purposes of determining the actual deferral - ------------------------------ percentage of a participant who is a highly compensated employee subject to the family aggregation rules of Code (S) 414(q)(6), the elective deferrals, qualified employer deferral contributions and compensation of such participant shall include the elective deferrals, qualified employer deferral contributions and compensation of family 33\n\nmembers, and such family members shall be disregarded in determining the actual deferral percentage for participants who are non-highly compensated employees. The determination and treatment of the elective deferrals, qualified nonelective contributions and actual deferral percentage of any participant shall satisfy such other requirements as may be prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury. 9.5 ACTIONS AVAILABLE WHEN TESTS UNSATISFIED. In the event that the Plan ---------------------------------------- Administrator shall at any time have reasonable cause to conclude that neither of the tests will be satisfied for a plan year, then the Plan Administrator shall take such actions as the Plan Administrator deems necessary in accordance with Appendix III, attached hereto and incorporated herein. 9.6 DISTRIBUTION OF EXCESS CONTRIBUTIONS. Excess contributions and income ------------------------------------ allocable thereto shall be distributed no later than the last day of each plan year to participants on whose behalf such excess contributions were made for the preceding plan year. \"Excess contributions\" shall mean the difference between the participant contributions made by highly compensated employees and the maximum amount of allowable participant contributions for those employees. The income allocable to excess contributions shall be determined by multiplying income allocable to the participant's elective deferrals and qualified employer deferral contributions for the plan year by a fraction, the numerator of which is the excess contribution on behalf of the participant for the preceding plan year and the denominator of which is the sum of the participant's account balances attributable to elective deferrals and qualified employer deferral contributions on the last day of the preceding plan year. The excess contributions which would otherwise be distributed to the participant shall be adjusted for income; shall be reduced, in accordance with regulations, by the amount of excess deferrals 34\n\ndistributed to the participant; shall, if there is a loss allocable to the excess contributions, in no event be less than the lesser of the participant's account under the Plan or the participant's elective deferrals and qualified employer deferral contributions for the plan year. Amounts distributed under this section shall be treated as distributions from the participant's elective deferral account and shall be treated as distributed from the participant's qualified employer deferral contribution account only to the extent such excess contributions exceed the balance in the participant's elective deferral account. 9.7 AVERAGE CONTRIBUTIONS PERCENTAGE TESTS. With respect to participant -------------------------------------- contributions and employer matching contributions, the average contribution percentage shall satisfy one of the tests described in, (a) or (b) below (definitions of words used in the tests are given in Section 9.9). (a) The average contribution percentage for eligible participants who are highly compensated employees for the plan year shall not exceed the average contribution percentage for eligible participants who are non-highly compensated employees for the plan year multiplied by 1.25; (b) the average contribution percentage for eligible participants who are highly compensated employees for the plan year shall not exceed the average contribution percentage for eligible participants who are non-highly compensated employees for the plan year multiplied by 2, provided that the average contribution percentage for eligible participants who are highly compensated employees does not exceed the average contribution percentage for eligible participants who are non-highly compensated employees by more than two (2) percentage points or such lesser amount as the Secretary of the Treasury shall prescribe to 35\n\nprevent the multiple use of this alternative limitation with respect to any highly compensated employee. 9.8 DISTRIBUTION OF EXCESS AGGREGATE CONTRIBUTIONS. Excess aggregate ---------------------------------------------- contributions and income allocable thereto shall be distributed no later than the last day of each plan year to participants to whose accounts employee contributions or matching contributions were allocated for the preceding plan year. \"Excess aggregate contributions\" shall mean the amount described in Code (S) 401(m)(6)(B). The income allocable to excess aggregate contributions shall be determined by multiplying the income allocable to the participant's employee contributions and matching employer contributions for the plan year by a fraction, the numerator of which is the excess aggregate contributions on behalf of the participant of the preceding plan year and the denominator of which is the sum of the participant's account balances attributable to employee contributions and matching employer contributions on the last day of the preceding plan year. The excess aggregate contributions to be distributed to a participant shall be adjusted for income, and, if there is a loss allocable to the excess aggregate contribution, shall in no event be less than the lesser of the participant's account under the Plan or the participant's employee contributions and matching contributions for the plan year. Excess aggregate contributions shall be distributed from the participant's matching contribution account in proportion to the participant's employee contributions and matching contributions for the plan year. 9.9 DEFINITIONS APPLICABLE TO DISCRIMINATION TESTS. For purposes of this ---------------------------------------------- Article, the following definitions shall be used: 36\n\nActual deferral percentage shall mean the ratio (expressed as a percentage) -------------------------- of effective deferrals and qualified employer deferral contributions on behalf of the eligible participant for the plan year to the eligible participant's compensation for the plan year. Average actual deferral percentage shall mean the average (expressed as a ---------------------------------- percentage) of the actual deferral percentages of the eligible participants in a group. Compensation shall mean wages within the meaning of Code (S) 3401(a) and ------------ all other payments of compensation to an employee by his employer (in the course of the employer's trade or business) for which the employer is required to furnish the employee a written statement under Code (S)(S) 6041(d), 6051(a)(3), and 6052. Compensation excludes amounts paid or reimbursed by the employer for moving expenses incurred by an employee, but only to the extent that at the time of the payment it is reasonable to believe that these amounts are deductible by the employee under Code (S) 217. Compensation shall be determined without regard to any rules under Code (S) 3401(a) that limit the remuneration included in wages based on the nature or location of the employment or the services performed (such as the exception for agricultural labor in Code (S) 3401(a)(2)). For purposes of performing the average actual deferral percentage test and the average contributions percentage test, the annual compensation of each employee taken into account shall not exceed the limitation under Code (S) 401(a)(17), which is the OBRA '93 annual compensation limit. The OBRA '93 annual compensation limit is $150,000 ($160,000 in 1997), as adjusted by the Commissioner for increases in the cost of living in accordance with Code (S) 401(a)(17)(B). In addition, in performing the average actual deferral percentage test and the average contributions percentage test for any year, Microsoft Corporation may elect to include in the definition of compensation for all employees the elective contributions that are made by the 37\n\nemployer on behalf of its employees that are not includible in gross income under Code (S) 125 (cafeteria plan) or Code (S) 402(e)(3) (cash or deferred arrangement). Elective deferrals shall mean contributions made to the Plan during the ------------------ plan year by the employer, at the election of the participant, in lieu of cash compensation and shall include contributions made pursuant to a salary reduction agreement. Eligible participant shall mean any employee of the employer who is -------------------- otherwise authorized under the terms of the Plan to have elective deferrals or qualified employer deferral contributions allocated to his or her account for the plan year. Family Member shall mean an individual described in Code (S) 414(q)(6)(B). ------------- Highly Compensated Employee shall mean an individual described in Code (S) --------------------------- 414(q). Inactive Participant shall mean any employee or former employee who has -------------------- ceased to be an eligible employee and on whose behalf an account is maintained under the Plan. Matching contribution shall mean any contribution to the Plan made by the --------------------- employer for the plan year and allocated to a participant's account by reason of the participant's employee contributions or elective deferrals. Non-highly compensated employee shall mean an employee of the employer who ------------------------------- is neither a highly compensated employee nor a family member. Participant shall mean any employee of the employer who has met the ----------- eligibility and participation requirements of the Plan.

This Article XX applies only to those accounts described in Appendix V that were transferred from the prior plan in a plan merger, plan-to-plan asset transfer or other transfer for which the annuity distribution option is required by law to be preserved with respect to the transferred accounts. Thus, for example, this Article XX does not apply to regular rollovers. 20.2 DEFINITIONS. ------------ (a) ANNUITY STARTING DATE means the first day of the first period for --------------------- which an amount is paid as an annuity. (b) ELECTION PERIOD means the period beginning on the first day of the --------------- plan year in which a participant attains 35 and ending on the date of the participant's death. If a participant separates from service before the first day of the plan year in which he reaches age 35, the election period with respect to his or her account balance as of the date of separation shall begin on the date of separation. A participant who will not attain age 35 as of the end of a plan year may make a valid waiver election to waive the qualified preretirement survivor annuity for the period beginning on the date of the election and ending on first day of the plan year in which the participant will attain age 35. Qualified preretirement survivor annuity coverage will be 53\n\nautomatically reinstated as of the first day of the plan year in which a participant attains age 35. Any new waiver on or after that date shall be subject to the full requirements of this Article XX. (c) QUALIFIED JOINT AND SURVIVOR ANNUITY means an immediate annuity ------------------------------------ purchasable with the participant's vested account balance which provides a life annuity for the participant and a survivor annuity payable for the remaining life of the participant's surviving spouse equal to at least 50% and not more than 100% of the amount of the annuity payable during the life of the participant. (d) PRERETIREMENT SURVIVOR ANNUITY means an annuity which is purchasable ------------------------------ with 100% of the participant's vested account balance (as determined on the date of the participant's death) and which is payable for the life of the participant's surviving spouse. (e) SPOUSE means the current spouse or surviving spouse of a participant ------ except that a former spouse will be treated as a spouse or surviving spouse (and a current spouse will not be treated as the spouse or surviving spouse) to the extent provided under a qualified domestic relations order. 20.3 DISTRIBUTION IN THE FORM OF A JOINT AND SURVIVOR ANNUITY. -------------------------------------------------------- A participant who is married shall receive his or her vested account balance in the form of a joint and survivor annuity unless the participant completes a valid waiver election within the 90-day period ending on the annuity starting date. The participant's waiver election will not be required to meet the spousal consent requirements if: (1) the participant does not have a spouse; (2) the Plan is unable to locate the participant's spouse; (3) the participant is legally separated or has been abandoned (within the meaning of state law) and the participant has a court order to that effect; or (4) other circumstances exist under which the Secretary of the Treasury will excuse the 54\n\nconsent requirement. If the participant's spouse is legally incompetent to give consent, the spouse's legal guardian (even if the legal guardian is the participant) may give consent. 20.4 DISTRIBUTION IN THE FORM OF A PRERETIREMENT SURVIVOR ANNUITY. If a ------------------------------------------------------------ married participant dies prior to his or her annuity starting date, the participant's surviving spouse shall receive a portion of the participant's vested account balance in the form of a preretirement survivor annuity, unless the participant had a valid waiver election in effect, or unless the participant and his or her spouse were not married through a one year period ending on the date of the participant's death. 20.5 WAIVER ELECTION - QUALIFIED JOINT AND SURVIVOR ANNUITY. ------------------------------------------------------ During the 90-day period prior to the participant's annuity starting date, a participant may waive the requirement to receive his or her benefit under the Plan in the form of a joint and survivor annuity. In order to waive the election, the participant must have received a written explanation of the terms and conditions of the qualified joint and survivor annuity as described in Section 20.7. A married participant's waiver election shall not be valid unless the participant's spouse: (1) has consented in writing to the election waiver and a notary public or the plan administrator (or his or her representative) witnesses the spouse's consent; (2) the spouse consents to the alternate form of payment designated by the participant or to any change in the designated form of payment; and (3) unless the spouse is the participant's sole beneficiary, the spouse consents to the participant's beneficiary designation or to any change in the participant's beneficiary designation. 55\n\n20.6 WAIVER ELECTION - PRERETIREMENT SURVIVOR ANNUITY. A participant's ------------------------------------------------ waiver election of the preretirement survivor annuity is not valid unless: (1) the participant makes the waiver election during the election period as defined in this section; and (2) the participant's spouse (to whom the preretirement survivor annuity is payable) satisfies the consent requirements described in Section 20.5, except that the spouse need not consent to the form of benefit payable to the designated beneficiary.
