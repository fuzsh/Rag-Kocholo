        "text": "1. Microsoft Page 1 Microsoft Corporation Strategic Analysis Report (2013-2014) Chinmay Chauhan\n\n2. Microsoft Page 2 Company Summary and History Microsoft began in 1975, with a vision by a Harvard drop-out, to see a PC on every desktop. Today, Microsoft is a dominating the world and a leader in multiple industries. Microsoft is listed in the Fortune 100 and has amassed an impressive portfolio of resources, alliances, global operations, customers and critics. Mission Statement \"Our vision is to create innovative technology that is accessible to everyone and that adapts to each person's needs. Accessible technology eliminates barriers for people with disabilities and it enables individuals to take full advantage of their capabilities.\" —Bill Gates, Chairman, Microsoft Corporation Microsoft Corporation manufactures, licences, and supports software products for computing devices and games solutions. Its most profitable products are both Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Office suite. Since the 1990’s, it is the most profitable IT company worldwide. It is 93,000 employees. Supported by a partnership with IBM, Microsoft progressively dominated the home computer operating system market, first with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, second with Windows. Microsoft is also present in cable TV with MSNBC cable television network and Internet accesses with the MSN Internet portal. The company also markets computer hardware as well as home entertainment products such as the Xbox, Xbox 360. The company's initial public stock offering (IPO) was in 1986; the ensuing rise of the company's stock price has made four billionaires and an estimated 12,000 millionaires from Microsoft employees. Through several analysis tools this report will make recommendations for Microsoft’s business strategy in the near future in the enterprise software industry\n\n3. Microsoft Page 3 Environmental Analysis (SWOT analysis) Strengths Weaknesses Opportunities Threats Strengths  Brand loyalty & reputation. Over the years, Microsoft has been the leading OS and software provider, which resulted in more than 90% market share for PC OS. Few other brands are capable to compete with Microsoft for this reason. Even open source OS, which are completely free and well suited to use for common user, find it hard to attract users. Microsoft’s brand is the 5th most valuable brand in the world, valued at $ 57.8 billion. Brand reputation leads to higher sales and greater market share.  Tie ups with Hardware manufacturers. The company works with all the major computer hardware producers like Dell and Samsung and major computer retailers to make sure computers would be sold with already pre-installed Windows software. The company also invested in Dell and Nokia to tighten its relationships with these companies.  Easy to use software. Microsoft products including its flagship Windows operating system are popular among the masses because of great quality and many decades of experience that Microsoft has put into its development.  Strong Financial surplus. Microsoft grew its revenues by 20% from 2008 to 2012 and holds more than $63 billion of cash and cash equivalents that can be used for acquisitions and substantial investments into R&D.  Acquisition of Skype. With nearly 300 million users, Skype is a significant boost to Microsoft’s online presence and have a lot of potential in generating income from online advertising.  Brand loyalty & reputation  Easy to use software  Tie-ups with hardware industry  Robust financial performance  Acquisition of Skype  Poor acquisitions and investments  Dependence on hardware makers  PC markets have matured  Slow to innovate  Cloud based services  Mobile advertising  Mobile device industry  Growth through acquisitions  Intense competition  Changing consumer behavior  Open source projects  Potential lawsuits\n\n4. Microsoft Page 4 Weaknesses  Bad Investment Decisions. Many of Microsoft’s acquisitions were not successful. Massive, Link Exchange, WebTV, Danger are just few examples of multimillion acquisitions made by Microsoft but soon shut down or divested.  Dependence on hardware manufacturers. Microsoft is a giant software corporation but it does not produce its own hardware and depends on computer hardware manufacturers to develop products that run Windows OS. If cheap and popular alternative OS would appear, hardware manufacturers may simple choose the alternative and Microsoft could do little to change the situation.  PC market has matured. Only recently has Microsoft entered the mobile technology sector and still heavily depends on its OS and software sales for standalone and laptop computers. The market for these products has matured and Microsoft will find it harder to grow revenues in these sectors.  Slow in Innovation. Microsoft has huge R&D resources and great position to enter new markets with innovative products but constantly failed to do so. It had an opportunity to be the first player in online advertising but missed the opportunity. Its entrance to mobile OS was also too late, while Google and Apple captured the market share.  Acquisition of Nokia. With nearly 18,000 layoffs planned in FY 2014, 12,500 of which will be from Nokia division, there are speculations that Acquisition of Nokia has been a bad move for Microsoft in the short term leading to a drop in share prices. The company is expected to recover the costs by 2016. However, Microsoft is playing a long strategy in this case seeing growth potential of the Smartphone market. Opportunities  Cloud based services. Microsoft could expand its range of cloud services and software as the demand for cloud-based services is expanding.  Mobile advertising. Mobile advertising markets are expected to grow in double digits over the next few years and Microsoft has a great opportunity to tap into these markets with its mobile OS.  Mobile device industry. Smartphones and tablets markets will grow steadily over the next few years and Microsoft could exploit this opportunity by introducing more of its own tablets and a new company phone.  Growth through acquisitions. With a huge reserve of cash Microsoft could start acquiring new startups that would bring new technology, skills and competences to the business.\n\n5. Microsoft Page 5 Threats  Intense competition in software products. Microsoft is more than ever on the pressure to introduce successful OS both in PC and mobile markets as such competitors like Google and Apple have already established positions.  Changing consumer habits. Customers shift from buying laptops and standalone PCs to buying smartphones and tablets, the markets, where Microsoft has only a modest market share and may never establish itself.  Open source projects. Many new open source projects are coming to the market and some of them became quite successful, such as new Linux OS and Open Source Office. Open source projects are free and so they can become an alternative to expensive Microsoft’s products.  Potential lawsuits. Microsoft has already been sued for many times and lost quite a few large scale lawsuits. Lawsuits are expensive as they require time and money. And as Microsoft continues to operate more or less the same way, there is high probability for more expensive lawsuits to come.\n\n6. Microsoft Page 6 Enterprise Software Industry Analysis (Five Forces Analysis) Industry rivalry: HIGH There is considerable rivalry within the enterprise software industry. The intensity of industry rivalry within the enterprise software industry is affected by several factors: (1) the concentration of competitors, (2) diversity of competitors, (3) product differentiation and (4) price differentiation. First, there is a high concentration of competitors within the industry. Several large multinational vendors and a handful of smaller localized firms compete in the enterprise software industry. Many of the companies have very specific skill sets that concentrate on segments of the industry while a few have very general skills that apply across the board. Since the edges of the industry are not clearly defined, several of the larger companies not only produce and consult on hardware and software, but also manufacture operating systems, general computer software, and development platforms. Third, there is Threat of Substitutes Brand loyalty: High Switching Costs: High Close relationships: High Bargaining Power of Suppliers Switching costs: Low Industry Rivalry Concentration of competitors: High Diversity of competitors: High Product/price differentiation: High Bargaining power of Buyers Switching Costs: High Buyer concentration: High Threat of New Entrants Cost of entry: High Economies of scale: High Brand loyalty: High Product differentiation: High Proprietary knowledge: High Potential Retaliation: High\n\n7. Microsoft Page 7 considerable product differentiation within the industry. Enterprise software applications can be tied together in a myriad of ways and run of various platforms. The products are differentiated by being focused on different size enterprises, levels of customizability, and varying deployment and development times. Fourth, considerable variation in price exists within the industry and there is a significant amount of price competition. The boundaries of the industry are blurred and companies tend to vary their pricing schemes depending on the total number of licenses purchased. Prices vary depending on the size of the client, the clients systems, the types of software required, the amount of consulting required, the amount of training required, and the amount of technical support required. Threat of New Entrants: LOW For several reasons, the threat of new entrants to the industry is somewhat low. First, the capital requirements to enter the industry are very large. The cost to design and develop enterprise software is extremely high due to the large amount of time it takes to do so successfully and the limited availability of people who possess the required proprietary knowledge. The software development process is quite long and expensive due to the reality of the software development lifecycle. There is also a limited amount of skilled personnel who can successfully develop and consult on enterprise software. Such skilled employees also come at great expense. Second, the companies within the industry have already achieved economies of scale, thereby reducing the potential profit that a new entrant could obtain. In general, the companies within the industry have already achieved absolute cost advantages because of the length of time that they have been participating in the industry. Third, there is considerable product differentiation within the industry. The major companies have very strong brand names and tend to invoke strong customer loyalty. Compatibility issues also play a role in loyalty because of the high switching costs associated with changing vendors. Lastly, proprietary knowledge and existing intellectual property are important components of competing in this industry, which inhibits new entrants. If a new company were to attempt to enter, the major players would most likely react immediately. Since the technology used in the software industry requires it to be compatible with other software and continue to be supported, the existing companies could intentionally create compatibility issues by altering their platforms or halting the support of platform or hardware. However, if a new company had a promising piece of software or skilled employees, it is most likely that one of the major companies would take over the new firm in order to acquire the technology for themselves. Threat of Substitutes: LOW There are few substitute products that compete with enterprise software.\n\n8. Microsoft Page 8 The old way of maintaining and sharing company information was manual paper archival systems or printed reports from separate databases. The modern way of connecting all of a business’s information requires enterprise software. A business could continue with building multiple disparate systems, however, they would never be able to achieve what an enterprise software business solution could provide. Therefore, enterprise software is more flexible, scalable, and less expensive than the older types of solutions. The near absence of modern substitutes in the industry is a good sign for the companies within the industry. Bargaining Power of Suppliers: LOW Within the industry, the bargaining power of suppliers is quite minimal. The main reason is because there are few suppliers with whom the companies must negotiate. The fact that enterprise software applications are an intellectual and intangible product rather than a physical product minimizes the number of suppliers required. Bargaining Power of Buyers: LOW The bargaining power of buyers within the enterprise software industry is fairly minimal for several reasons. First, the concentration of buyers is growing quickly; however, they are a very diverse and non-unified group, because they all have different backgrounds and needs. Second, more companies are deciding that enterprise software is a necessity for their business. Therefore, they are often willing to pay the going rate. Lastly, there are extremely high switching costs from one supplier to another, due to the high cost of the related infrastructure for these types of systems\n\n9. Microsoft Page 9 Capabilities & Core Competencies Identifying a firm’s resources and capabilities, and thus its core competencies, is a vital step to establishing corporate strategy and to achieving profitability. Resources and capabilities, in order to be strategically valuable, must be superior to those of competitors. Resources include assets specific to the firm and capabilities are the ability to utilize these resources effectively Tangible Resources  Cash Reserves: Microsoft has approximately $67 billion in cash reserves, giving them a large amount of financial flexibility.  Operating Revenue: Microsoft reports revenue in FY 2013 as $86 billion. Microsoft ranks #34 in the Fortune 500.  Financial Leverage: Microsoft is currently not highly leveraged with a leverage ratio of 0.79 in 2014. Therefore they have the option of pursuing further debt financing in order to finance growth, if necessary in the future.  Property and Equipment: Of Microsoft’s net physical assets, almost half, is related to computer equipment and software. Additional holdings include land and buildings, totalling $9.9 billion before depreciation expenses.  Distribution Channels and Customers: Microsoft has established distribution channels for its products, including online vendors and retailers. Microsoft also has an established customer base. All of these tangible resources indicate that Microsoft has significant borrowing capacity, resilience, investment capacity and reserves Intangible Resources Intangible resources include technology, reputation and corporate culture. Microsoft’s technological resources include its research capacity and intellectual property portfolio.  Research and Development: Microsoft employs almost 1100 people purely dedicated to long-term future focused research in lab facilities throughout the world, and spent more than $9 billion in FY’14 for these activities.  Intellectual Property: Microsoft maintains a large patent portfolio. Microsoft has 40,000 patents and many other forms of intellectual property In addition to technological resources, Microsoft’s primary intangible resources lie in its reputation and brand. The Financial Times ranks Microsoft just after Apple, as the number two most valuable brand name in the world Additionally, Microsoft’s reputation is another of its strongest resources.\n\n10. Microsoft Page 10 Microsoft’s unique culture is an additional intangible resource. It can be described as casual, fun, team-oriented and intense. Employees are valued for their contributions. Such a highly dedicated workforce, developed through a strong culture and identity, represents a significant competitive advantage. Intangible resources are immeasurably more important than tangible resources because they are less easily copied by competitors. Microsoft is in a strong position regarding intangible resources due to its technological capacities, brand equity and cultural intensity. Human Resources A company’s human resources can be measured in terms of its employee’s qualifications, commitment. Microsoft is able to attract and retain the best talent in the information technology business. Their employees are educated, dedicated and committed to their company, and this loyal and intelligent employee base is a very strong resource for Microsoft. Capabilities Beyond identifying resources, a firm should leverage those resources into capabilities, in order to determine competitive advantage. Microsoft has many capabilities that enable them to use their resources effectively by being embedded in company routines, including:  Financial control  Capacity for decision making  Continuous improvements  Brand management  Ability to identify and respond to market trends and adapt  Engineering and technical know-how  Research capability Microsoft’s core capabilities allow the company to dominate the market and to shape the direction of the technological future.\n\n11. Microsoft Page 11 Strategic Groups in Software Industry Figure 1 : Strategic Map  Cloud Databases (DaaS): Companies in the Cloud databases (aka Database-as-a-Service or DaaS) strategic group provide on-demand relational database software, available on a pay-as-you-go basis, based on an elastic architecture. This enables users to employ a relational database without having to purchase any software or servers, or manage the configuration.  Cloud Platforms (PaaS): Companies in the Cloud platforms (aka Platform-as-a-Service or PaaS) strategic group provide complete on-demand development environments and tools, including an abstracted Cloud infrastructure layer and Cloud database, enabling enterprise IT groups develop, test, and deliver custom on-demand business applications without investing in traditional Systems Software or infrastructure. Cloud platforms, such as Microsoft Azure, also offer a stand-alone relational Cloud database, putting them in direct competition with pure-play DaaS firms.  Traditional Software: Companies in the traditional Systems Software strategic groups provide programming languages, relational database software, Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), private Cloud environments, middleware, and other tools enabling enterprise IT groups to develop, test, host and manage custom on-premise business applications.\n\n12. Microsoft Page 12 Strategic Partnerships Strategic alliances are unique organizational structures that enable cooperation between companies. They help to spread risk, mitigate costs, and shape future opportunities. Microsoft maintains many partnerships and alliances to help further its goals. Enterprise Software Alliances In the enterprise software arena, Microsoft maintains significant alliances with Dell, HP and IBM. Each provides co-specialization benefits for both Microsoft and the partner.  HP: The HP and Microsoft global strategic alliance is one of the longest standing alliances of its kind in the industry, with more than 25 years of combined marketplace leadership focused on helping customers and channel partners around the world improve productivity through the use of innovative technologies. HP and Microsoft are working together and combining their respective strengths to deliver innovative technologies to help advance businesses. Together they take familiar platforms from mobile devices and desktops to data centre and cloud - and build integrated solutions; Microsoft won PartnerOne Alliance Partner of the Year – Americas from HP in FY 2013  IBM: The alliance with IBM allows Microsoft enterprise applications to run on IBM servers. For customers, the benefit of the alliance is that all parts of your solution hardware, software, and middleware will install quickly, start up easily, and run reliably.  Dell: Additionally, Microsoft maintains an alliance with Dell which is designed to help business reduce the complexity and cost of deploying a server based environment and to create a comprehensive and integrated set of distributed computing services using both Dell and Microsoft technologies.  Facebook: Under the strategic alliance, Microsoft is the exclusive third-party advertising platform partner for Facebook, and sells advertising for Facebook internationally in addition to the United States.\n\n13. Microsoft Page 13 Current Business Models Microsoft largely pursues a long-term positioning strategy of differentiation, emphasizing branding, software design, quality service and innovation, as opposed to a low-cost strategy, which emphasizes economies of scale and reduction of input costs. Companies that pursue a differentiation strategy, such as Microsoft, are common in that they have access to research, highly skilled employees, a strong sales team and a reputation of excellence. Microsoft has been a market leader in the Enterprise software industry. However, the PC market revenues are declining because of market saturation. Microsoft’s late entry into the mobile market might is already haunting the company executives. “One Microsoft, One Strategy” – Alignment Strategy Microsoft previously operated its business under five segments: the Windows Division, Server and Tools Division, Online Services Division, Microsoft Business Division, and Entertainment and Devices Division. In July 2013, management announced a change in organizational structure as part of its transformation to a devices and services company under the “one strategy, one Microsoft” banner. The realignment aims at improving revenues due to declining PC sales and reducing the duplication of efforts across various divisions. Although Microsoft revenues increased for the year ending June 2013, a fall in PC sales continued to impact earnings. For fiscal year 2013, the company’s revenue grew 6%, to $77.85 billion. Microsoft said 2013 revenue increased, primarily due to higher revenue from Server and Tools as well as revenue from new products and services, including Windows 8, Surface, and the new Office. These gains\n\n14. Microsoft Page 14 were offset in part by the impact on revenue of a decline in the x86 PC market. It seems that Microsoft is trying to end its dependence on the saturated and now declining PC market by shifting to new markets such as mobile, cloud services, gaming, search, and tablets. Mobile First, Cloud First world The industry is moving from PCs to Mobile / Tablets / Other devices, from Licensing to Licensing & Subscription, from On-premise software to Cloud computing. Microsoft is currently in the process of transforming itself from a software player to a “devices and services company” in an organizational overhaul aimed at improving sales and MSFT’s competitive position. Microsoft’s $7.2 billion acquisition of Nokia’s devices and services business last year is in line with this transformational move. By transforming into a devices and services company, Microsoft aims to primarily monetize high-value activities by leading with devices and enterprise services. The consumer x86 PC market is declining, as users have continued to prioritize devices with touch and mobility. At the same time, Microsoft’s enterprise products and cloud solutions are seeing continued strength, and adoption of Microsoft’s consumer services has increased. After missing revenue expectations in four out of the five previous quarters, Microsoft beat analyst expectations in 1Q 2014 earnings on the back of strong growth in the company’s enterprise and consumer segments. Microsoft’s consumer services, such as Bing and Skype, will differentiate Microsoft’s devices and serve as an on-ramp to its enterprise services while generating some revenue from\n\n15. Microsoft Page 15 subscriptions and advertising. Enterprise services will remain an area of growth and opportunity as businesses of all sizes look to move to a cloud, manage a growing number of devices and tap into big data. Microsoft’s current CEO Satya Nadella announced that it would be making Windows free for phones and tablets (< 9” screens). Free Windows licenses factor into Nadella's plan to make Windows ubiquitous. This is consistent with the fact that Windows Phone OS growth hasn’t been gaining momentum among the phones and tablets market.\n\n16. Microsoft Page 16 Future Recommendations Microsoft has been a technology industry leader and has strong capabilities and resources to make anything possible. We recommend it to make improvements in the following areas: “Mobile First, Cloud First” strategy Microsoft has been lagging behind in the mobile markets (vis-à-vis smartphones, tablets, etc.). Its Windows Phones which come with a Windows Phone OS constitute only 3.6% of the entire market. It has acquired Nokia in hope of improving its market share and making a turnaround. We recommend it to invest and innovate more in the mobile market segment purely because of the growth potential this segment has and also since it seems to be the future of personal computing. Product Innovation and Invention Microsoft has been the industry leader because of the constant research and innovation and the wide range of products and services it provides. Trend suggests that in house developed products have been Microsoft’s strength: Windows OS, Office Suite, Windows Server, etc. Instead of focusing on acquiring new companies it should invest more internally to come up with new products. Reduce Poor Investments Microsoft has been making too many blunders while acquiring new companies. It should improve its investment research and try to cut down on the rate of poor acquisitions. More often than not, Microsoft has been bad at making the acquired companies profitable. It should be more investigative before acquiring any company in the future. Strengthen Strategic alliances One of the few ways to sustain the market dominance and leadership is to make many strategic business alliances in the industry. This has been Microsoft’s strength since its existence and it should try to keep the existing partners while trying to find new partners for competing in the industry. Cut down unprofitable Products For example Bing search engine. Despite having 18.1% of market share, it has been a bleeding investment for Microsoft for many years. It should decide the strategy for such products, and possibly cut down on loss generating services. Microsoft Research Division Microsoft has been spending huge amounts of money on general computer science research, which might be good for the future but doesn’t lead to any significant returns in the short term. It’s necessary to be more efficient while investing in research like it’s competitors such as Google and Apple."
