Many other properties followed—and The Lego Movie, out in February, features many of our favorite modular heroes meeting for the ﬁrst time. Here are some of the character lines that helped make it happen. —\n\ntodd tankersley\n\n0\n\n2\n\n1\n\nargument\n\nBy PAUL FORD\n\n“THE PAST IS A FOREIGN COUNTRY,”\n\nnovelist L. P. Hartley wrote. “They do things differently there.” He penned that in 1953, but in the digital era the past is now present and all around us: Millions of out-of-print books and historical videoclips, black-and-white movies, nearly forgotten TV shows and pop songs are all available with a credit card or in many cases for free. It used to be that, for economic and technological reasons, this cultural history was locked away. Libraries and corporate archives kept a small subset of it available, but the rest was in storage, out of reach. The reversal has happened in just the past decade. We are now living in a history glut; the Internet has muddled the line between past and present. The transformation was slow at first, and hardly anyone besides librarians noticed. Project Gutenberg, founded in 1971, was a cheerfully radical effort to turn old books into text ﬁles. When the web came along, the Online Books Page appeared and began listing links to thousands of digitized titles. Then, after the turn of the millennium, the pace rapidly accelerated: Google set up Google Books, Amazon launched Kindle, and Archive.org started scanning public-domain works from libraries. Meanwhile, shifts in the economics of music, ﬁlm, and video set off an explosion in the digitization of back catalogs, until then the furtive territory of file-sharing pirates. Spotify and Netﬂix, Apple and YouTube have all now built enormous businesses based on organizing the past for commercial exploitation. Suddenly we ﬁnd ourselves living in an online realm where the old is just as easy to consume as the new. We’re approaching an odd sort of asymptote, as our past gets closer and closer to the present and the line separating our now from our then dissolves.\n\nFEB 2014\n\nSix decades after Hartley wrote his famous line, the past is no longer a foreign land. Instead we’ve brought a weirdly literal truth to William Faulkner’s famously sphinxlike aphorism: “The past is never dead. It’s not even past.” Take the Kennedy assassination, for instance. In honor of the event’s 50th anniversary last November, CBS streamed four straight days of its news broadcast from the period surrounding the killing so you could experience what it had been like in real time. Or consider this: World War II buffs can download radio broadcasts and listen to the rise of Hitler or the news from D-Day as you would have heard them back then. More often, though, we don’t immerse ourselves in history; it’s just there whenever we want it, living right alongside the present. We can trace ideas backward in time, either by searching Google Books or (for a sum) through thousands of academic journals, using a few keywords to ﬁnd sources that once were the sole domain of historians. Pick any historical subject and the Internet will bring it to life before your eyes. If you’re interested in vaudeville, you’ll ﬁnd videos galore, while college football scholars can browse Penn State’s 1924 yearbook, complete with all the players’ names and positions. And every day, more history keeps washing up. Not long ago the news went out that a Philadelphia woman named Marion Stokes had recorded 140,000 VHS tapes of local and national news from 1977 to her death in 2012. Her collection has been acquired by the Internet Archive, and soon it will trickle onto the web. This omnipresence of the past has weird effects on contemporary culture. Take any genre of music, from death metal to R&B to chillwave, and the cloud directs you not just to similar artists in the present but to deep\n\nwells of inﬂuence from the past. Yes, people still like new things. But the past gets as much preference as the present—Mozart, for example, has more than 100,000 followers on Spotify. In a history glut, the idea of fashionability in music erodes, because new songs sit on the same shelf as songs recorded ﬁve, 25, and 55 years ago, all of them waiting to be discovered. In this eternal present, everything can be made contemporary. Perhaps the biggest result of the history glut is that managing all that history becomes the crucial act, both commercially and intellectually. Wikipedia is cataloging history, but to do so it needs to keep up an epic accounting of its own history—the billion-plus edits, each a record of human activity, that have built the encyclopedia over the years. Companies like Spotify and Netﬂix are mining the past as they host it, looking at their own enormous usage logs and analyzing that data to draw connections between types of people and types of music. There’s an irony here: All of the data we’re collecting, all of the data points and metadata, is history itself. Much as we marvel at Babylonian clay tablets listing measures of grain, future generations will ﬁnd just as much meaning in our log files as they will in the media we consume. Sure, Frank Sinatra sang a bunch of songs; sure, Jennifer Lawrence was a big star in 2014. But the log ﬁles tell you who listened, and when, and where they were on the planet. It’s these massive digital archives—and the records that show how we used them—that will be the deﬁning historical objects of our era.

But his work shows that we are more like them than we thought. ¶ After 20-plus years of pioneering techniques for extracting DNA from bones, Pääbo led the group that sequenced the first extinct hominid genome in 2010. What he found upended dogma: Humans migrating out of Africa interbred with Neanderthals rather than merely replacing them, and people of Eurasian descent could carry a whopping 4 percent Neanderthal DNA. ¶ Next up is sequencing Neanderthal predecessor Homo heidelbergensis. At 400,000 years old, the DNA samples could be four times older—and are far more degraded—than any previously sequenced hominid’s, but Pääbo’s team has a new method that can recover genomes more easily than ever before. Ultimately, he wants to pinpoint why it was our ancestor who took over instead of another primate. Not that we’re complaining.

Born between roughly 1961 and 1981, they lacked any political idealism— “stuck in a terminal cynicism,” as The Dallas Morning News observed. Gormless narcissists, their “intimacy and communication skills remain at a 12-year-old level,” one expert wrote. Even Matt Groening, creator of The Simpsons—one of Generation X’s most inﬂuential masterworks—complained that “there’s no intellectual pride or content to this generation. The dominant pop culture is MTV and the Walkman.”\n\nBen wiseman\n\nIndeed, MTV was frequently blamed for turning Xers into “a post-literate generation,’’ as a Random House publicist sniffed. And if their moronic, ironic pop culture wasn’t grating enough, they were constantly whining about their economic lot, having graduated into the recession of the early ’90s. A typical headline in The Washington Post snarled, “ , .” Now, I’m 45 years old, which places me right in the middle of Generation X. I remember reading these sneering op-ed pieces all the time. But then something funny happened. Gen X punditry died—very suddenly. Check the data. If you plug “Generation X” into Google’s Ngram search engine—which tracks the occurrence of words and phrases in books—you find that the term exploded in use around 1989, climbing steeply throughout the ’90s. But in 2000 it peaked and began declining just as rapidly. You see a similar pattern in major newspapers, where the term boomed to more than 2,000 in 1995, then declined to just over 800 last year. It’s been years since I’ve heard it as an insult. What changed? Well, it probably wasn’t the actual personality traits of Gen Xers. Despite constant handwringing over generational shifts, the basic personality metrics of Americans have remained remarkably stable for decades, says Kali Trzesniewski, a scholar of life-span changes. And anecdotally, nobody I knew in the ’90s is much different now. Grayer, maybe. No, only one thing has changed. Generation X stopped being young. By the turn of the millennium, Gen Xers were rounding the corner into their thirties and forties. They started buying houses, getting into government, and running businesses, and the emptiness of the\n\nMINT: ALAMY\n\nfashion\n\nlibels thrown at them soon became screamingly obvious. Think about it: Barack Obama, born in 1961, is a Gen Xer—which kind of makes the whole “slacker” label bankrupt. The real pattern here isn’t any big cultural shift. It’s a much more venerable algorithm: How middleaged folks freak out over niggling cultural differences between themselves and twentysomethings. In the ’50s, senators fretted that comic books would “offer courses in murder, mayhem, [and] robbery” for youth. In the ’80s, parents worried that Dungeons and Dragons would “pollute and destroy our children’s minds”—and that the Walkman would turn them into antisocial drones. This pattern is as old as the hills. As Chaucer noted in The Canterbury Tales, “Youth and elde are often at debaat.” I bring this up because it seems that we Gen Xers are now doing our part to perpetuate the cycle. We write many of today’s endless parade of op-eds snarking at “millennials,” intoning darkly about the perils of Snapchat and sighing nostalgically over the cultural glory of the mixtape. Again, just look at the data: In Ngram, the term “millennials” begins to explode in the late ’90s —just before “Generation X” collapses. We passed the baton to the next sucker. My prediction? Hold fast, millennials. This current wave of punditry will peak and then start declining six years from now. In 2020, about half of you will have turned 30. You’ll no longer be young—and therefore no longer scary—and today’s rhetoric about your entitlement and narcissism will evaporate. You’ll be in charge. I can’t imagine what you’re going to say about the kids being born today.\n\nThe same coating that’s on your nonstick pans make these pants spill-proof. Scented jeans don’t smell on the hanger.

Though he’s not up for an award himself, the producer and Def Jam Recordings cofounder could earn some thank-yous for his work on nominated albums like Black Sabbath’s 13 3 and Kanye West’s Yeezus. That he had a hand in West’s most divisive album to date shouldn’t surprise; the éminence grise has been ahead of the curve for three decades now, whether pioneering compression techniques that kicked off the “loudness war” of the mid-2000s or agitating for subscription-based music models well before Spotify. He sat down with at his Malibu home to discuss his three-decade career as guru, executive, seer, and onetime honorary Beastie.\n\nYou’ve been predicting a subscription-based music model for more than a decade. Is Spotify what you’d hoped for?\n\nalways listening to good music. The last one I discovered that way was an English singer and producer named Sampha. I heard about him through Chance the Rapper.\n\nWe hired a lot of great people, signed a lot of great artists; we took a company that was creatively dormant and turned it into what’s probably the most viable of the major labels today.\n\nDid you clash with the old guard while you were there? There were clashes of ideas. I saw so much potential, but there was a sort of resistance to change: “Well, we don’t do it that way.” I wouldn’t say I fought about things, because I wasn’t there to ﬁght. It’s the same in the studio: If an artist brings me in, they want me there for my opinion. Sometimes they take it, sometimes they don’t. That’s their prerogative.\n\nCan you give an example? Yes and no. Now you can hear anything you want, whenever you want, wherever you want—that’s great. But knowing what to listen to hasn’t been completely ﬁgured out yet. What I originally thought was, if I had a service like that, all I’d want to do is DJ all day. But once I had it, I realized that I really don’t like having to DJ. I like being surprised by what comes on next. I like it coming to me.\n\nSo until that happens, how do you discover new artists?\n\nYou were cochair of Columbia Records from 2007 to 2012. When you ﬁrst started, you arranged for several employees to get a private tour of New York City’s Museum of Modern Art. Why? The idea was to remind everyone: We’re in the art world. It’s not purely a business transaction that we’re thinking about. We’re curators of great art. Surround yourself with great art; feel the power of it and how it’s presented. That’s how we treat our artists, and that’s how we treat our music.\n\nI don’t look at music blogs much. I still feel like the best way to hear about things is word of mouth. Luckily, I get to talk to a lot of artists, and they’re\n\nWhy’d you take the job?\n\nContributing editor BRIAN RAFTERY (@brianraftery) wrote about Bob Odenkirk in issue 21.11.\n\nI thought it would be a challenge, doing what I do with artists on more of a company level.

What were your expectations when you put them out? Zero—we were making records to make our friends laugh. I always thought I’d have a real job and music would be my hobby.\n\nWhat did you think your real job would be?\n\nULTRA\n\nFEB 2014 ANGRY NERD 032\n\nAfter a rift with the Beasties, you patched things up over the years. Were you in touch with Adam Yauch before he passed away in 2012? I was. More via email, but yeah. We all grew up together, and we all think of each other as we were then. It’s probably different for those guys, because they spent more time together. But for me, it’s like a time capsule.\n\nWhat happens when you ﬁrst sit down with an artist? The first step is conversation and feeling—getting a sense of rapport, a feeling of likemindedness. Discussing material and helping edit what’s best are next, and then developing more, if needed.\n\nDid that change on Eminem’s Marshall Mathers LP 2? Usually, with rap artists, we start from scratch—talking about music or maybe listening to music. Then I’ll play some rough sketches. If they have a vocal idea, I might say, “Let me hear\n\nhow you’re going to phrase over this, and then I’ll develop it into more of a song.” With Eminem, he has a very clear vision of what he wants to do vocally. We were working in two different rooms—me on tracks and him on vocals. We got a lot done.\n\nWith Yeezus, though, Kanye came in having already recorded much of the music. My role on that was different. He and I went through loads of different producers’ versions of the songs, picking and choosing—and in some cases doing additional new production—to create new tracks for these songs. He’d say, “Instead of adding things, try taking things away.” He thought of it as a minimal album.\n\nROBOCOP, STAY IN COSTUME!\n\nWill you go to the Grammys? [Shakes head.] I went once, in the ’80s. I don’t make music to win something. It’s about self-expression and making these beautiful things. Someone coming up to me in the street and saying, “Wow, I heard so-and-so: That really moved me.” I know how much of a role music played for me as a kid. I didn’t have a lot of friends; I didn’t feel connected to a lot of things. I felt most at home in my life with my eyes closed connecting to music.\n\nA REMAKE OF ROBOCOP?! I would\n\nRubin with Jay Z and Def Jam cofounder Russell Simmons in 2011.\n\nnot buy that for a dollar. It’s enough of an outrage that the new ﬁlm replaces the scathing satire of Reagan-era privatization and vigilantism with dumb commentary about drones. But I have some serious doubts about how well star Joel Kinnaman can ﬁll Peter Weller’s helmet. It’s not the performance I’m worried about; Kinnaman’s an excellent actor. But when RoboCop’s face is the moviegoer’s only link to his onetime humanity, there had better be a hyper-photogenic jaw peeking out—even though the helmet in the remake is retractable and RoboCop doffs it as casually as if he’s opening the sunroof on his car. I get it: Hollywood pays big bank for a bankable star, so it wants to highlight his mug. And Kinnaman’s is ﬁne. But Weller’s? Weller’s was magniﬁcent. Perfect lips that weren’t too plump or too thin. Chin, teeth, philtrum—all ﬂawless. Give him a Kirk Douglas dimple and he’d have the whole package. (This isn’t homoeroticism. It’s canon!)

A COMBINATION OF deadpan humor and old-timey drawings has\n\ntransformed Someecards into the Hallmark of the web, with 7 million unique visitors a month. How else could you deliver a romantic note like “Just sending a preemptive apology, since Valentine’s Day can’t possibly live up to your expectations”? Cofounder and head writer Brook Lundy designed the cards to be the antithesis of the musical color-bomb ecards of yesteryear. He issues a daily assignment to contributors and matches the wittiest responses to anachronistic illustrations culled from image databases. We talked to Lundy about how Someecards has redeﬁned (and proﬁted from) the lowly ecard. — What’s the Someecards style? Sarcastic? Cynical? I’d say honest. It’s probably closer to Curb Your Enthusiasm and Seinfeld, because it’s a bit absurd too. We like to play off the minutiae of life and call attention to it in a funny way. When you’re being honest, stuff comes out that people usually don’t talk about because it’s dark, dirty, or inappropriate.\n\nYou’re trying to be more honest than funny? It’s the goal. Does everyone really hate Red Sox fans? Do women’s nipples get erect when it’s cold? That’s the factchecking we’re always doing. If you nail the honesty, you don’t have to work too hard at the make-it-funny part.\n\nSUBSCRIBE NOW.\n\nAnd you make money this way? The cards are free, but we make money from the ones we create for advertisers like Ford and Clorox. We’ve made them for shows like The Walking Dead and Modern Family. We combine the tone of Someecards with the voice or plot points of the show and release them online the same way as our other cards.\n\nHow many cards do you create each day? We aim for six to 10, but it depends on the day and what’s happening. Ecards about Obamacare, no one gives a shit about. But if Miley Cyrus does something crazy, that can give us fodder for the day. Kim Kardashian getting engaged, that was a gold mine.\n\nPRINT AND DIGITAL ACCESS INCLUDED.\n\nWIRED .com/subscribe\n\nPowered by Condé Nast.\n\nULTRA\n\nTIME TO BUILD\n\n50 D AY S\n\nFEB 2014\n\n5 YEARS 037\n\nALAMY\n\nFLIGHT SIMULATOR THE ULTIMATE PAPER AIRPLANE\n\nBOEING CAN BUILD a 777 in 50 days. Luca Iaconi-Stewart can build one too—in five years. True, IaconiStewart made his 1:60-scale jetliner out of manila folders and dabs of glue, but it’s almost as complicated as the real deal, down to the retractable landing gear. The idea for the project grew out of his love of airplanes—and the “massing models” he made from manila paper in a high school architecture class. Soon after he found a super-detailed diagram online of an Air India 777-300ER, Iaconi-Stewart was drawing forms in Adobe Illustrator, printing them on manila, and wielding his X-Acto knife. “There’s something rewarding about being able to replicate a part in such an unconventional medium,” he says. Iaconi-Stewart devoted an entire summer just to the seats (20 minutes for an economy seat, four to six hours for business class, and eight hours for first class). Tweezers helped. He designed the engines in about a month and assembled them in four. The tail he rebuilt three times. When his classes at Vassar took up too much time—he actually stopped work on the 777 for two years because of college— Iaconi-Stewart dropped out. “I’m fortunate to have parents willing to give me a fair amount of latitude,” he says. They’re going to have to give a little more: When this project is ﬁnished, probably early this year, he might start building an even bigger model. —\n\nMark Mahaney\n\nULTRA\n\nFEB 2014\n\nWAYPOINTS LOS ANGELES\n\n038 MOST POPULAR FILMING LOCATIONS IN 2013, B Y\n\nNUMBER\n\nOF\n\nPRODUCTION\n\nD AY S :\n\nVENICE BEACH 3 7 6 , GRIFFITH PARK\n\n2 9 1 , DISNEY’S GOLDEN OAK RANCH 2 2 6 , HERALD EXAMINER BUILDING 1 2 9 , DOCKWEILER STATE BEACH 1 2 8 , WILL ROGERS STATE BEACH 1 2 5 , LOS ANGELES CENTER STUDIOS 1 1 7 , POINT DUME BEACH PARKING LOT 1 1 2 , LINDA VISTA COMMUNIT Y HOSPITAL 1 0 8\n\nSECRETS, STARS, AND BONES AN INSIDE LOOK AT L.A.\n\nLA drivers will have to contend with an extra commute challenge: 2,000 trucks carrying concrete for the new Wilshire Grand.

The Baltika can crack through ice about 2 feet thick, but the ship’s patent holder, Aker Arctic, has a larger ship in the works to cut trade routes through heavier Arctic ice. —\n\n042\n\nOLYMPIC TRICKS THE KEY TO SLOPESTYLE IF YOUR WINTER-OLYMPICS meh has been frozen in place ever since you watched curling in 2010, we’ve got good news. Slopestyle, a new freestyle skiing/snowboard event in which riders ﬂy through an obstacle course, will blow the broom right out of your hand. Unlike other events based on speed or a speciﬁc course design, slopestyle is about originality—the tricks that athletes can manage on courses that change with each competition. That’s the challenge facing Sochi course designer Anders Forsell. “We try to create something that offers as many options as possible,” he says of building the 550-meter run. Forsell generally tries to visit the site in summer to get a good look at the terrain. Then he turns to AutoCAD software to design the slope and jumps, which he usually builds ﬁrst with dirt. Once it’s go time, snowcats push the white stuff into place. —\n\nThe event draws a lot of inspiration from urban skateboarding; in addition to several types of rails, slopestyle can even include staircases.\n\nJumps lead to more speed, more air, and cooler tricks. Forsell puts the bigger ones at the bottom of the course, so the spectators have a great view.\n\nForsell builds courses about 10 days before an event; that way he can adjust everything based on snow conditions. For example, he might change the angle of a jump so riders don’t overshoot the next one.\n\nNine times out of 10, Forsell works with artiﬁcial snow. It contains less air, it’s more solid, and it gives him better control over quality.\n\nWhen Forsell manages to ﬁt a fourth jump (courses normally have three, including Sochi’s), riders can build up enough speed to execute ultratricky moves like the triple cork.\n\nD A T A S T R E A M // A V E R A G E T O O T H F A I R Y P A Y O U T P E R T O O T H , B Y U S R E G I O N N E W E N G L A N D : $ 5 . 0 0 // S O U T H C E N T R A L : $ 4 . 6 0 // P A C I F I C : $ 4 . 3 0 // M I D A T L A N T I C : $ 3 . 8 0 // U P P E R M I D W E S T : $ 3 . 7 0 // S O U T H A T L A N T I C : $ 3 . 1 0 // S O U T H E A S T : $ 3 . 1 0 // G R E A T P L A I N S : $ 2 . 8 0 // M O U N T A I N W E S T : $ 2 . 3 0\n\nkagan mcleod\n\nWho’s trolling who?\n\nTHE PATENT TROLL CAMPAIGN ISN’T JUST ABOUT PATENT TROLLS\n\nIt’s about a group of companies that want patent law rewritten in their favor to weaken the patent rights of all inventors.\n\nGet the facts.

A friction ﬁghter here, dimethicone really gets around. Short-molecularchain variants can be found in breast implants; networks of rubbery longchain dimethicone comprise the silky skin of sex dolls. Not in the mood? You can also ﬁnd it in a wide variety of household caulks.\n\nDIMETHICONOL This kissing cousin of dimethicone is added to lotions and conditioners, because it leaves a satiny coating on skin and hair. Like dimethicone, it has a backbone of alternating silicon and oxygen atoms and comes in a range of viscosities. The difference is that dimethiconol has had its tips snipped off and replaced with hydroxyl groups— oxygen atoms bound to hydrogen. It puts the –OH, –OH in your personal lubricant.\n\nBest known for creating a cool sensation in consumer products like cigarettes and cough drops, menthol triggers TRPM8—also known as cold and menthol receptor 1—an ion channel protein that alerts nerve cells when it detects coldness. So why is this pepperminty substance in a warming lubricant? It likely provides that promised tingly feeling. Plus, menthol can moderate the imaginary heat generated by this product, so your skin doesn’t feel like it’s on ﬁre.\n\nVANILLYL BUTYL ETHER It smells like dessert and can trick nerves into perceiving heat, probably by ﬂipping the switches of the protein TRPV1, which lets calcium penetrate nerve cell membranes. VBE’s hexagonal head is identical to that of capsaicin, the molecule that gives peppers their punch, so both substances push the same biochemical buttons. Luckily, the sweet ether is far less intense and irritating than its spicy brother.\n\nFor more WHAT’S INSIDE, go to video.

KNOW-IT-ALL CAN WHALES BE AUTISTIC? question to Laurel Braitman, author of the forthcoming Animal Madness: How Anxious Dogs, Compulsive Parrots, and Elephants in Recovery Help Us Understand Ourselves. Her book chips away at the prejudicial idea that humans are the only animals to feel and express emotion in complex and surprising ways and shows that animal minds can be just as diverse as our own. “Why not?” Braitman answered gleefully. This was followed by a long chain of other, more nuanced thoughts and historical anecdotes. And then, ﬁnally, Braitman told me about A27. I PUT THIS\n\nA27 was an orca, one of 32 that a marine biologist named Naomi Rose studied for several years in British Columbia while investigating the social dynamics of male orcas in the wild. There was something very different about this guy. He behaved oddly—inscrutably. Rose explained, for example, that he’d go on “tail-slapping jags” for several minutes, repeatedly smacking the water with his rear ﬁn. Orcas are normally extremely social animals. But A27 didn’t interact much with other orcas except his mom. “I ended up thinking he was developmentally stunted,” Rose told Braitman.\n\nSo, was A27 autistic? Who the hell knows? Does the story of A27 present only the most excruciatingly thin evidence that a whale could be autistic? Yes, it sure does. But as Braitman asks, what would it even mean to apply a human label like “autism” to an animal? We have only the most hesitant understanding and deﬁnition of autism in our own species, and the barest concept of the inner lives of nonhumans. So listen, here’s your answer: The world is full of difference and mystery. Certainty surfaces only intermittently, like blackﬁsh spouting from beneath a deep blue tide. Christoph Niemann\n\nfeb 2014\n\nFriends often ask me to mention their project or cause in my social media streams, but I feel that promoting their art opening or charity 10K or posting pictures of their baby will demean my brand. How do I deﬂect these requests?\n\nIf I’m waiting at an airport gate for my ﬂight, is tweeting about the horrible smell of egg salad the woman next to me is eating an acceptable way to vent? Or is it an act of moral cowardice? Picture it: California, 1878. A new and curious device, the “telephone,” is popping up across the state. And this thing is really stupendous—“an unmistakable success,” one newspaper raves. Other papers print a poem—Whitmanesque in its exuberant use of exclamation points—that says the telephone can be used by lovers to express their longing when separated by great distances! (“The humblest of words like angels fly / A thousand miles in the ﬂash of an eye, / You hear before they are said!”) The climate of telephone wonder is so adrenalized that when a man claims to receive phone calls from the dead, it does not seem impossible. Now look at our phones. Really look at them. They’re incredible! I’m reading that terrible poem from 136 years ago on my telephone right now! Just conjured it out of the ether, like the voice of a dead man! And yet we take it all for granted. Which is to say: Tweeting about that woman and her egg salad is an act of moral cowardice. Actually, it’s worse. It’s a betrayal of your fellow human being but also, somehow, a betrayal of your phone—of its potential, its capacity for good. You’re using technology that’s meant to cohere people over long distances to callously alienate yourself from a person next to you. You’re taking something beautiful and using it to ﬂing something ugly. We’ve come a long way since 1878. We’re so staggeringly interconnected now. There’s no such thing as time and space. It’s all been smashed, jumbled, and melded together. In this new dimension we inhabit, a tweet can stink worse and waft farther than the stench of any egg salad.\n\nDo you know what happens when a hippopotamus dies? Well, it falls over, ﬁrst of all. But then the carcass gradually ﬁlls with gasses as the animal’s insides rot. It sounds gruesome, but that decomposing corpse also represents upwards of 2 million calories—a big bonanza of nourishment—and all the vultures and hyenas and scavenging big cats that happen across a dead hippo would love nothing more than to break in and start digesting that good stuff. Sometimes, however, they can’t. Sometimes the hippo hide is too thick and rubbery for any animal to tear into. And if nothing can puncture the skin— if the hippopotamus proves impenetrable—it will simply get more and more bloated until, ﬁnally, it explodes. Sounds to me like your social media presence is like that hippopotamus: a lockbox of very special material that everyone wants a piece of. The only way to keep it that way is to thicken your skin. Say no, ﬁrmly, and don’t let those hyenas and vultures get to you. On the other hand, you may just be awfully pompous. If you’re truly so concerned with bolstering your authority as a “curator” and defending the integrity of your “brand” from frivolous “asks”—if you’re being so calculated and cynical about the whole thing—then, I’d argue, your Facebook, Instagram, and whatever else is basically dead inside. It’s as dead as that hippo, bloated and sprawled in the dust. Stop walling it off from the Circle of Life. Let a baby picture or a charity 10K pop it from time to time. Let all that gas rush out.

These are ﬁxed focal length cameras (they don’t zoom), so your lens should match your shooting needs. The Coolpix A has wide-angle 28-mmequivalent optics that work best for group shots and scenic vistas; they’re not optimal for tight shots. The Coolpix A’s respectable f/2.8 aperture can’t quite match the X100S’s bright lens, and its autofocus lags a bit. Still, it’s the clear choice if you want a smaller camera with straightforward operation. It’s lighter and simpler, and its control scheme is perfectly painless.\n\n$1,100\n\n2\n\nFUJI FILM X100S\n\nBEST FOR: Seasoned shutterbugs who want a fast-focusing low-light shooter.\n\nIt’s bulkier and pricier than the Coolpix A, but Fujiﬁlm’s big-sensor X100S also offers superior performance. The beneﬁts start with the glass—a ﬁxed 35-mm-equivalent ﬁeld-of-view lens with an f/2.0 aperture that yields excellent low-light shots. Fujifilm’s autofocus system is also noticeably faster than Nikon’s, and you’ll generally get better macro performance.

It’s a vestige of an earlier era, when a large service had thousands of users. Today, despite the billions of people online, we’re still designing for the sparse old days. ¶ “In the late ’90s, I would have thought MetaFilter might have like 10,000 users max,” says Matt Haughey, creator of the popular online community. Haughey was also an early designer for Blogger, one of the ﬁrst democratized online publishing platforms. “For Blogger, I thought, this is pretty amazing, and wouldn’t it be great if millions of people used it? I thought, someday we might reach 5 million or so.” ¶ Those kinds of numbers, ambitious at the time, seem like nothing now. Blogger, which was acquired by Google, currently hosts tens of millions of blogs;\n\nMetaFilter has upwards of 60,000 accounts. But while we’ve built these systems to scale for machines, we’ve generally done a poor job of scaling them for humans. We haven’t really gotten our heads around what having much of the planet online means, and nothing reﬂects this better than the username quandary. When online communities were just starting out, our digital watering holes relied on unique usernames—and not only for person-to-person interaction. The servers used them to ID people logging on. This became the established practice, and it wasn’t a problem in those early days, when it could take months or even years for the good names to get snapped up. Now that can happen in a day. Take the selﬁesharing service Shots of Me. It is … precious. But because Justin Bieber backs the company, his horde of Beliebers jumped on it almost instantly; within hours of the launch, I couldn’t get the username I wanted. That sucks. One of the best things about the online world is how it lets us be whoever we want to be. We shouldn’t have to sacriﬁce that just because someone else got there ﬁrst. Facebook is handling this problem pretty well—an infinite number of John Smiths can use the service with no confusion. On Twitter, conversely, demand for its supply of usernames is so high that people routinely buy, sell, and even steal valuable handles— company names, ﬁrst names, celebrity names, and so on. The solution—and the key to Facebook’s success—is surprisingly simple: Identity online should take a cue from the physical world. You are more than your name; your face, your birthday, your location, and the company you keep all help others figure out who you are. “Oh, you’re Mat’s friend Joe from New York? That’s right, I remember you.” We can use all those same cues digitally, as Facebook does. Yes, our data has to attach to unique identifiers to live on a server, but only the machines need to see those. They’re just like the Social Security numbers we use in meatspace to differentiate people with the same name. Ultimately we’re all just numbers to computers anyway. It’s kind of counterintuitive, but the best way to be whoever you want to be is to be nothing more than a number to everyone but your friends. That means there can always be more than one Mat Honan—which, trust me, is an awesome idea. Email mat_honan@\n\n.com. TAV I S CO B U R N\n\n3G to 4G. Change for the better.

Now, collaborating with documentary filmmaker and Snowden confidante Laura Poitras, he was going to extend the story to Silicon Valley. Gellman wanted to be the ﬁrst to expose a top-secret NSA program called Prism. Snowden’s files indicated that some of the biggest companies on the web had STEVEN LEVY (@stevenlevy) is a\n\nsenior staff writer at the author of Crypto.\n\nand\n\ngranted the NSA and FBI direct access to their servers, giving the agencies the ability to grab a person’s audio, video, photos, emails, and documents. The government urged Gellman not to identify the firms involved, but Gellman thought it was important. “Naming those companies is what would make it real to Americans,” he says. Now a team of Post reporters was reaching out to those companies for comment. It would be the start of a chain 0\n\n6\n\nreaction that threatened the foundations of the industry. The subject would dominate headlines for months and become the prime topic of conversation in tech circles. For years, the tech companies’ key policy issue had been negotiating the delicate balance between maintaining customers’ privacy and providing them benefits based on their personal data. It was new and controversial territory, sometimes eclipsing the substance of current law, but over time the companies had achieved a rough equilibrium that allowed them to push forward. The instant those phone calls from reporters came in, that balance was destabilized, as the tech world found itself ensnared in a fight far bigger than the ones involving oversharing on Facebook or ads on Gmail. Over the coming months, they would find themselves at war with their own government, in a fight for the very future of the Internet. But ﬁrst they had to ﬁgure out what to tell the Post. “We had 90 minutes to respond,” says Facebook’s head of security, Joe Sullivan. No one at the company had ever heard of a program called Prism. And the most damning implication—that Facebook and the other companies granted the NSA direct access to their servers in order to suck up vast quantities of information—seemed outright wrong. CEO Mark Zuckerberg was taken aback by the charge and asked his executives whether it was true. Their answer: no. Similar panicked conversations were taking place at Google, Apple, and Microsoft. “We asked around: Are there any surreptitious ways of getting information?” says Kent Walker, Google’s general counsel. “No.” Nevertheless, the Post published its report that day describing the Prism program. (The Guardian ran a similar story about an hour later.) The piece included several images leaked from a 41-slide NSA Power Point, including one that listed the tech companies that participated in the program and the dates they ostensibly began fully cooperating. Microsoft came first, in September 2007, followed the next year by Yahoo. Google and Facebook were added in 2009. Most recent was Apple, in October 2012. The slide used each company’s corporate logo. 4\n\nIt was like a sales force boasting a series of trophy contracts. Just a day earlier, the public had learned that Verizon and probably other telephone companies had turned over all their call records to the government. Now, it seemed, the same thing was happening with email, search history, even Instagram pictures. The tech companies quickly issued denials that they had granted the US government direct access to their customers’ data. But that stance was complicated by the fact that they did participate—often unwillingly—in a government program that required them to share data when a secret court ordered them to do so. Google and its counterparts couldn’t talk about all the details, in part because they were legally barred from full disclosure and in part because they didn’t know all the details about how the program actually worked. And so their responses were seen less as full-throated denials than mealymouthed contrivances. They hardly had the time to figure out how to frame their responses to Gellman’s account before President Obama weighed in. While implicitly confirming the program (and condemning the leak), he said, “With respect to the Internet and emails, this does not apply to US citizens and does not apply to people living in the United States.” This may have soothed some members of the public, but it was no help to the tech industry. The majority of Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, and Yahoo customers are not citizens of the US. Now those customers, as well as foreign regulatory agencies like those in the European Union, were being led to believe that using US-based services meant giving their data directly to the NSA. The hard-earned trust that the tech giants had spent years building was in danger of evaporating— and they seemed powerless to do anything about it. Legally gagged, they weren’t free to provide the full context of their cooperation or resistance. Even the most emphatic denial—a blog post by Google CEO Larry Page and chief legal officer David Drummond headlined, “What the …”—did not quell suspicions. How could it, when an NSA slide indicated that anyone’s personal information was just one click away? When Drummond took questions on the Guard-\n\n“Every time we spoke it seemed to make matters worse,” one tech executive says. “We just were not believed.”\n\nzohar lazar\n\nian website later in the month, his interlocutors were hostile: “Isn’t this whole show not just a face-saving exercise … after you have been found to be in cahoots with the NSA?” “How can we tell if Google is lying to us?” “We lost a decade-long trust in you, Google.” “I will cease using Google mail.” The others under siege took note. “Every time we spoke it seemed to make matters worse,” an executive at one company says. “We just were not believed.” “The fact is, the government can’t put the genie back in the bottle,” says Facebook’s global communications head, Michael Buckley. “We can put out any statement or statistics, but in the wake of what feels like weekly disclosures of other government activity, the question is, will anyone believe us?” At an appearance at a tech conference last September, Facebook’s Zuckerberg expressed his disgust. “The government blew it,” he said. But the consequences of the government’s actions—and the spectacular leak that informed the world about it—was now plopped into the problem set of Zuckerberg, Page, Tim Cook, Marissa Mayer, Steve Ballmer, and anyone else who worked for or invested in a company that held customer data on its servers. Not just revenue was at stake. So were ideals that have sustained the tech world since the Internet exploded from a Department of Defense project into an interconnected global web that spurred promises of a new era of comity. The Snowden leaks called into question the Internet’s role as a symbol of free speech and empowerment. If the net were seen as a means of widespread surveillance, the resulting paranoia might affect the way people used it. Nations outraged at US intelligence-gathering practices used the disclosures to justify a push to require data generated in their countries to remain there, where it could not easily be hoovered by American spies. Implementing such a scheme could balkanize the web, destroying its open essence and dramatically raising the cost of doing business. Silicon Valley was reeling, collateral damage in the war on terror. And it was only going to get worse. steve brodner\n\nW WHILE TECH COMPANIES didn’t know\n\nthe name Prism before June, they came to understand that it refers to a program several years old, in which they turn over speciﬁed data to the government, often without formal warrants, for national security purposes. The program’s legal justiﬁcation derives from a series of laws, renewals, and extensions. The Foreign Intelligence Security Act of 1978, widely referred to as FISA, created a secret court that blesses information requests. The FISA Amendments Act of 2008 carved out a new section of the law, 702, which gave legal cover to the warrantless surveillance programs operated in total secrecy under President Bush; queries are often called 702s. The NSA cites the FISA Amendments Act as the speciﬁc legal basis for Prism. More covert surveillance practices (outside of Prism) are justiﬁed under Reagan-era Executive Order 12333, which authorized the NSA to collect pretty much any data from outside the US that concerns foreign persons. In a sense, Prism is a child of the Patriot Act, which set a post9/11 tone for the sacriﬁce of some civil liberties in service of national security. “It was passed in the middle of a huge, understandable fear,” says US senator Ron Wyden (D–Oregon), who voted for it and is a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee. “I felt it had a time stamp on it. Nobody reading it would be inclined to think of bulk collection of data on millions and millions of Americans.” Some companies seemed perfectly comfortable turning over information about their customer bases to the NSA. Verizon has never denied passing along its key billing information, including the number and duration of every call made by each of its millions of customers. In a way, this isn’t surprising. Telephone companies don’t sell themselves on trust, and customers have few expectations of their relationship with those quasi-monopolistic behemoths. Instead of catering to consumers, telcos seem to pri-\n\noritize winning favor with the government that regulates them. Technology companies are another matter. It’s almost a cliché when tech CEOs claim that without the trust of their users, they would have no business. They depend on customers’ willingness to share information. In exchange, those customers receive more and better services, and expect that the companies will keep their personal data private and secure and will be transparent about any exceptions. Users had no reason to think their information would be handed over to the government without a warrant. At least one company challenged those requests as unconstitutional. Yahoo waged a secret battle in the FISA court to resist turning over user data. But it was for naught. An August 22, 2008, order determined that the government’s interest in national security, along with safeguards in the program, outweighed privacy\n\nto Snowden’s communications. Lavabit could not do so without exposing the information on all its customers and ultimately folded rather than comply. There appear to be smaller ways to resist, though. “The government can request the information, but they can’t compel how the information is given,” says Twitter’s general counsel, Vijaya Gadde. “You can make it easy or you can make it hard.” Google also says it pushes back when a request is “overly broad.” Pocketbook issues present a subtler means of resistance. FISA requires the government to reimburse companies for the cost of retrieving information. Google says that it doesn’t bother to charge the government. But one company says that it uses that clause, hoping to limit the extent of the requests. “At ﬁrst, we thought we shouldn’t charge for it,” says an executive of that company. “Then we realized, it’s good— it forces them to stop and think.”\n\nnot just revenue was at stake. so were ideals that have sustained the tech world since the internet exploded from a deFense departMent project. concerns in a manner consistent with the law. A subsequent appeal went nowhere. Yahoo’s unsuccessful challenge set a marker for those who might resist in the future: The FISA request program was legal, and any company that failed to cooperate would risk the contempt charges speciﬁed in the law. Th e re q u e s ts m i g h t h ave offended some of the large tech companies but weren’t logistically challenging. None say they were forced to make significant infrastructure changes as a result. Generally they would divert requested data to special equipment owned by the government. In some cases they even hosted the equipment on company property. But compliance wasn’t always as easy for smaller companies. For example, the government demanded that Lavabit—a secure email startup that allowed users, including Snowden, to encrypt messages—hand over the keys\n\nIn the end, though, there is a greater financial motive to cooperate. “Large companies do a lot of business with the government,” one top technology executive points out. “It’s hard to look at the government officers and say, ‘We’re ﬁghting you on this—oh, and can I have that $400 million contract?’” Tech companies also grew more vocal in their requests to publicize the number of FISA requests they received. They were only allowed to release reports that tally all government requests, including those from civil court and law enforcement. (The raw numbers, often in the low thousands, don’t seem scary, but they lack context.) Google, Yahoo, Facebook, and Microsoft petitioned the FISA court to loosen the gags, and a long list of technology firms, including Apple and LinkedIn, submitted amicus briefs in support. But the government ﬁled passionately opposing briefs and prevailed. 0\n\n6\n\n7\n\nThe clash illustrates a seemingly irresolvable conﬂict. While Silicon Valley must be transparent in many regards, spy agencies operate under a cloak of obfuscation. There is certainly a reason for the secrecy; evildoers who use an Internet service presumably might be less likely to keep using it if they were aware that the company was sharing communications with the NSA. But one of the disturbing consequences of secret programs is the destructive shroud of doubt they cast over everything they touch. Months after Snowden’s leak, basic facts about Prism remain elusive. How much information is actually collected by the program? Exactly what kind of cooperation did the companies offer after those dates speciﬁed on that NSA PowerPoint slide? The companies contend that in addition to what they can’t say, there’s plenty they don’t know. “We’re still guessing,” says Richard Salgado, Google’s director of information security and law enforcement. “We’re not the author of those slides. We have no idea where they got some of that information.” “The question goes to issues of a highly classiﬁed nature,” says Tekedra Mawakana, Yahoo’s head of global public policy.\n\nA\n\nALL SUMMER, the tech companies\n\ntried to deal with the fallout from Prism, while the NSA tried to ﬁgure out how to respond to the Snowden leaks. And then things got uglier for both sides. In October, a Snowden leak exposed a program in which the NSA, without the knowledge or cooperation of the companies involved, managed to collect the address-book data of millions of people. The Washington Post reported that over the course of a single day, the NSA had collected “444,743 email address books from Yahoo, 105,068 from Hotmail, 82,857 from Facebook, 33,697 from Gmail, and 22,881 from unspeciﬁed other providers.” The practice was\n\ncategorized internally at the NSA says Eric Grosse, Google’s head of as an upstream method to collect security. “Then we found ourselves data as it ﬂows through the Inter- in an arms race with certain nationnet, as opposed to downstream state actors [with a reputation methods, like Prism, in which for cyberattacks].
