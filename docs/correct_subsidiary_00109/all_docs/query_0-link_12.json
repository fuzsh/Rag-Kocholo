These divisions include:[3]\n\nWindows & Windows Live Division\n\nServer and Tools\n\nOnline Services Division\n\nMicrosoft Business Division\n\nEntertainment and Devices Division\n\nHistory\n\nCompany Beginnings\n\nThe idea of establishing Microsoft began in 1971 when Paul Allen found an article in an electronics magazine about Intel's 4004 chip, the world's first microprocessor. Allen thought that this microprocessor will become better and better. After a year, Intel came up with 8008, which gave Paul Allen and Bill Gates the idea on How Moore's Law really worked. They learned that each generation of microprocessor chip was twice as fast as the previous.They decided to buy the 8008 microprocessor which became the core of a special computer designed to do traffic volume count analysis and which they would to traffic departments. Paul Allen and Bill Gates formed Traf-O-Data, their first company.[4]\n\nIn 1973, Allen read an article from a popular electronics magazine about Altair 8800, the world's first microcomputer kit. Allen and Gates took it as a big opportunity. They wrote Altair BASIC, a true programming language, and the first commercial Microsoft computer product.[5] In 1975, the two persuaded MITS to sell Altair Basic. Allen and Gates signed their first contract with MITS as \"Paul Allen & Bill Gates doing business as Micro-Soft.[6] Allen and Gates shared the title General Partner.

The two licensed Q-DOS to IBM, which became the deal of the decade. This transaction paved the way for Microsoft to dominate the PC Software Industry.[8] Microsoft developed a new operating system called MS-DOS (Microsoft Disk Operating System).[9]\n\nMicrosoft Corporation\n\nOn June 25, 1981 Microsoft was officially incorporated in Washington as a privately held corporation with Bill Gates as President and Chairman of the Board while Paul Allen as Executive Vice President.[10] On August 12, 1981, IBM introduced its new Personal Computer using Microsoft's 16-bit computer operating system called MS-DOS 1.0.[11]\n\nIn 1983, Paul Allen was diagnosed with Hodgkins disease and resigned as executive vice-president, but he remained member of the board.

Grove partnered in developing the next wave in personal computing, called Digital Video Computing.[17] The company released Windows 3.0 and 3.1, and sold 10 million copies during the first two years. The following year in 1993, Microsoft completed the Windows NT, a project that began in the 1980s. The NT 3.1, a strategic business platform that supports high-end engineering and scientific programs in a 32-bit operating system. In 1995, the company launched the Windows 95 and sold 7 million copies within the first five weeks. It was followed by the release of other Microsofts products such as the Internet Explorer, Windows 98, Windows Me, Windows Media Player and others.[18]\n\nRapid Growth from 2000 to Present\n\nBill Gates created a new position in the company and assumed the role of Chief Software Architect from 2000 until 2006,[19] he dedicated his time to developing the next generation of Windows Internet platform and services. While serving as Chief Software Architect, Gates remained Chairman of the company.

The company also expanded its operations, and now maintains offices in more than 100 countries worldwide.

The Federal Trade Commission's inquiry lasted for more than three years.[23]\n\nIn 1994, the U.S. Department of Justice investigated Microsoft regarding allegations that the company is involved in monopolistic practices in the PC software market.[24] The investigation was triggered by the complaints filed by Novell, a software company, for allegedly monopolizing the word processing and spreadsheet market.[25]\n\nIn 1998, the Justice Department filed charges against the company for allegedly engaging in a pattern of anticompetitive acts.[26] Microsoft allegedly violated a 1994 consent decree regarding the licensing of the Windows operating system to computer manufacturers, and violations of Section 1 and Section 2 of the Sherman Act for illegal business practices and for illegally protecting and extending the Windows software monopoly respectively.[27]\n\nIn 2003, the European Commission won the monopoly abuse case against Microsoft for linking its media player to Windows and fined the company 497 million euros.[28]\n\nMicrosoft and ICANN\n\nOn January 24, 2001, Microsoft Benelux Support Manager Ruud de Jonge confirmed that the majority of Microsoft websites were down due to a problem in the system that maps Web addresses to IP addresses. In a statement Jonge said, \"It can be a system or human error, but somebody could also have done this intentionally. We don't manage the DNS ourselves, it is a system controlled by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) with worldwide replicas.\"[29] This sparked comments from the Internet community and some concluded that Microsoft blamed ICANN for the failures of its domain name servers.[30]\n\nAfter the failures were resolved, Microsoft issued an apology to its customers and explained that the operational errors were not caused by any third party instead a Microsoft technician made a wrong configuration change to the routers on the edge of Microsoft's Domain Name Server network which caused limited communication between DNS servers on the Internet and Microsoft's DNS servers.[31]\n\nIn 2006, Microsoft became an ICANN accredited registrar for .biz, .com, .info, .name, .net, .pro and .org.[32]\n\nIn 2009, the company collaborated with ICANN, AOL, Verisign, Afilias, and with security researchers and operators within the DNS, to implement a coordinated global response to the Conficker Worm. It coordinated a response designed to disable domains targeted by Conficker and offered a $250,000 reward for information that results in the arrest and conviction of those responsible for illegally launching the Conficker malicious code on the Internet.[33][34]\n\nNew gTLD Program\n\nGoogle's application for the .search new gTLD includes a proposal for a \"dotless\" TLD, which has been with significant objection from Microsoft and other companies.[35] An excerpt from Google's application explains the proposal: \"Charleston Road Registry will provide a service on the dotless search domain that will allow users to designate the search functionality of their choice and then perform queries that will automatically be redirected to the appropriate website. This facility should provide simple, consistent access to the userʹs preferred search functionality that does not exist today.\"[36]\n\nMicrosoft and ISOC\n\nMicrosoft is a sponsor of a component of ISOC's Next Generation Leaders Programme, which is an academic and field-based program, launched in 2010 in conjunction with the DiploFoundation, intended to further the skills of promising Internet professionals and individuals working in Internet governance.
