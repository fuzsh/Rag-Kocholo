Consulting Chemist to the Textile Industries FOURTH EDITION REWRITTEN AND ENLARGED NEW YORK JOHN WILEY & SONS, Ine. Lonpon: CHAPMAN ‘& HALL, Limrrep Coprricut 1904, 1907, 1918, 1924 BY J. MERRITT MATTHEWS Printed in U.S. A. PRESS OF BRAUNWORTH & CO., INC. BOOK MANUFACTURERS BROOKLYN, NEW YORK PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION Since the last edition of this volume of ten years ago there has been so much new matter appearing in the field of textile fibers that the author has been under the necessity of entirely rewriting and rearranging the book. In the present edition, therefore, the reader will find that a great deal of new matter has been introduced and the general plan of the book has been readjusted to meet the demands of a logical development of the subject. The field of textile chemistry and the processing of textile fibers has taken on new proportions during the past ten years. To mention only one branch of the subject, the artificial silk industry, for example, has expanded until at the present time more artificial silk is made than is obtained as a natural product from the silkworm. The use of mercerised cotton has become an established factor in the cotton industry and has become stabilised into a standard process. The World War caused much research into the possibilities of utilising other fibers than those normally employed, and we find a great variety of experimenting, such as in the spinning of the so-called ‘‘ staple” fiber yarns. Some of these sporadic attempts have passed out with the necessity of their use, while others have shown themselves to be of sufficient worth to remain in the general body of textile products. The fact that several reprintings were called for in the third edition of this book has encouraged the author to feel that his attempt to bring together such a large mass of scientific and technical data concerning the textile fibers has been more or less appreciated by those interested in the fiber industries. He has scoured the literature of this country and Europe rather thoroughly in the search for information, and anything of interest or value he has not hesitated to take and has endeavored to fit it in its proper place in this volume. The patent literature has also been thoroughly digested, though it has been the author’s experience that in this province great care must be exercised so as not to distort in one direction or the other the technical values in a patent. Believing that proper illustration of technical books is of extreme importance, the author has been at great pains to select from his own ll SOT iv PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION rather large collection of fiber micrographs those which possess some interest in relation to the present subject matter. Furthermore he has picked out wherever he could find them fiber micrographs appearing in the general technical literature and has endeavored to give full credit wherever possible to the original source. In addition to the fiber micro- graphs endeavor has been made further to illustrate the text with suitable figures of apparatus and machinery so that the reader may better visualise the descriptions of the processes involved. When the eye can see a picture the interest is more easily aroused and the attention is more readily held, and the fact that is seeking to be elucidated is more clearly presented to the understanding. The field of textile chemistry as a profession is growing, and it is in the hope of furthering the dignity of this province of science that the author presents this present volume to those whose work is related to this branch of the subject, whether in the scientific, the technical, or the commercial aspect. Textile fibers extend into many lines of our industrial and com- mercial activity, and knowing that the great majority of his readers are neither chemists nor scientists, the author has been careful to avoid a mere scientific presentation of the subject matter and has endeavored to express himself in a manner that is clear even to those without a scientific education. J. Merritt Matrrurws. New York City, 1923. PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION Tur present book, it is hoped, will be of assistance to both the practical operator in textiles and the student of textile subjects. It has been the outgrowth of a number of years of experience both in the teaching of tex- tile chemistry and in the practical observation in the many mill problems which have come under the notice of the author in the practice of his profession. The textile fibers form the raw materials for many of our greatest industries, and hence it is of importance that the facts concerning them should be systematised into some form of scientific knowledge. The author has attempted, however, not to allow the purely scientific phase of the sub- ject to overbalance the practical bearing of such knowledge on the every- day problems of industry. Heretofore, the literature on the textile fibers has been chiefly confined to a chapter or two in general treatises on dyeing or other textile subjects, or to specialised books such as those of Héhnel, Hanausek and Wiesner on the microscopy of the fibers. It has been the author’s endeavor, in the present. volume, to bring together, as far as possible, all of the material available for the study of the textile fibers. Such material is as yet incomplete and rather poorly organised at its best; but it is hoped that this volume may prove a stimulus along the several lines of research which are available in this field. Unfortunately, the subject of the textile fibers has been lamentably neglected by chemists, although there is abundant indication that a fertile field of research is open to them in this direction, and such work would have not only a scientific value, but would also be of great industrial worth. There is, as yet, relatively little known con- cerning the chemical constituents of the fibers, and the manner in which the varying chemical conditions of bleaching and dyeing and other chemical treatments affect the composition and properties of these con- stituents. The action of various chemical agents on the fiber as an individual has been but very imperfectly studied. More work has been done in the microscopical field concerning the properties of the fibers; but even here the knowledge is very incomplete and disjointed, and especial attention is drawn to the fact that there is yet a large amount of work to be done in the microchemistry of the subject. Vv PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION The author has endeavored to emphasise throughout this volume the importance of the study of the fiber as an individual, for in many cases it is misleading to assume that the behavior of the individual fiber is identical with that of a large mass of fibers in the form of yarn or cloth. In the latter case, the difference in physical condition and the action of mechanical forces have an important influence. By going back to the study of the individual fiber as a basis, many explanations can be given which could not otherwise be discovered. It is hoped that this book may afford instruction both to the manu- facturer and to the student; assisting the former in solving some of the many practical problems constantly occurring in the manufacture of textiles, and urging the latter on to an increased effort in the scientific development of the subject.

Fibers Chiefly Used for Textiles——In order to be serviceable in a textile fabric, a fiber must possess sufficient length to be woven and a physical structure which will permit of several fibers being spun together, thereby yielding a continuous thread of considerable tensile strength and pliability. Although there are several fibers, such as spun glass, asbestos, various grasses, etc., which are used for the manufacture of textiles in peculiar and rare instances, yet the fibers which are employed to the ereatest extent and: which exhibit the most satisfactory qualities are wool, silk, cotton, and linen. All of these possess an organised structure, and are the products of a natural growth in life processes. 9. Historical.—The study of the various textile fibers employed by different nations throughout the ages is an excellent commentary on the progress of civilisation and affords a good idea of the industrial life and economic condition of the peoples concerned. It is an interesting fact that most of the commercial fibers that are in use at the present time were also prominent in the industrial life of past ages. Cotton, flax and hemp were apparently known and utilised in past ages in much the same manner as they are to-day, and we find them well distributed among the various nations of the world. The animal fibers of wool and various hairs were also utilised for the making of fabrics and other materials in the earliest ages. Silk seems to have been more recently recognised and to have been developed for a long period in one nation exclusively, namely, China. The use of flax or linen perhaps dates back to a greater antiquity than that of any other fiber, or at least it is the fiber of which we possess the most ancient records. The cultivation of flax and the utilisation of its fiber goes back to the Stone Age of Europe. Remnants of flax fabrics have been found in the remains of the Swiss Lake Dwellers, who were apparently a people contemporaneous with the mammoth in Europe. Well-authenticated specimens of these fabrics are to be found 2 GENERAL CLASSIFICATION in our present museums. Four or five thousand years later the Egyptians are known to have cultivated flax also, and in fact the species of plant so utilised appears to be almost identical with the common flax plant of the present day. The culture and manufacture of flax as well as the spinning and weaving of the yarn is shown in the pictorial carvings on the walls of Egyptian palaces, temples and tombs. Also linen fabrics probably 4500 years old have been found in Egyptian tombs, employed as mummy cloths, and these fabrics show a wide variety of structures, from very fine delicate cloth to coarse sail cloth or canvas. As much as 300 yds. of cloth was used to wrap one mummy; consequently these mummy cloths, which are still in a fine state of preservation, have been handed down to us in considerable quantity and may be seen in almost any museum. Much of the cloth was evidently undyed, but a considerable part was colored, chiefly in red, yellow and purple. From the historical records of the Babylonians it is also apparent that their textile industries were in a high state of development and they were well acquainted with the use of flax, cotton and wool. The early Greeks were evidently more familiar with wool as a textile than with either linen or cotton, though later these were brought in from other countries. The same is also true of the early Romans. In ancient America, flax and hemp were both known to the Aztecs of Mexico, and cotton was also known to the ancient Incas of South America. In ancient India, cotton seems to have been the national textile fiber, and the expert use of this fiber in the weaving of fine and delicate fabrics became famous, if we can believe the extreme praise of them to be met with in poetry and legend. The Hindoo muslins were said to be so fine that when laid on the grass and wet with the dew they became invisible. It is not possible for us to say just how far back in history the use of cotton was first known in India, but we have records of 800 B.C., which indicate that the cotton industry at that time was well known and long established. Cotton was not introduced into Greece until about 200 B.C. The use of hemp among the ancients was apparently very limited; the hemp plant grows wild throughout India, but it was regarded more as a source of a drug (hasheesh) than as a fiber plant. We find no mention of hemp in the Bible, and it is very seldom referred to by other writers of antiquity. In the Sanskrit Institutes of Menu, however, we find mention of sana as a fiber from which certain sacrificial threads were prepared. This sana has been supposed to refer to Sunn Hemp, which is one of the commercial fibers even of the present time in India. Hemp was used by the Scythians in 500 B.C. for cordage, and apparently it was aiso known to the Chinese at a very early period. PROPERTIES REQUIRED IN A TEXTILE FIBER 3 One of the oldest fibers of Oriental nations was China grass or ramie. The utilisation of this fiber antedates the written records of history both in China and in India, and it may have been used in Egypt for mummy cloth contemporaneous with flax. This fiber was not known to the ancient Americans, but these people used the fiber from the agave (sisal hemp or henequen) for the making of cordage.! 3. Properties Required in a Textile Fiber—The availability of a fiber for textile purposes must be considered with reference to its adapta- tion to the various operations and processes through which it is required to pass in the formation of a woven fabric. Preliminary to the operation of weaving (or other similar operation by which a fabric is made) it is neces- 1]7t is impossible to state what was the first fiber employed for textile purposes, and how it came to be used. Weaving seems to have existed long before writing; consequently it is hopeless to expect any historical record of the origins of textile fibers. Probably the use of fibers in weaving developed out of the ancient art of basket making. Many primitive races early discovered that the stems of plants could be twisted together to form a framework which could be used for many purposes, such as stockades to protect them from wild animals and enemies, rush huts to protect them from the inclemencies of the weather, baskets to hold and carry food, and various other materials. It may have been that through wear and the action of the weather a basket made from - flax stems changed its nature and became a bag. The thoughtful savage, no doubt, discovered that by weathering the flax straw long lustrous fibers could be obtained, which could then be twisted together to form a thread or cord, and this could be inter- laced to form a new material, cloth. Flax seems to be found in all remains of pre- historic people, and it is very likely that this was man’s first textile fiber. Wool would probably be the next textile fiber that came into use, as primitive man long employed sheep skins as a garment, and it would be natural to expect that he would soon become aware of the possibilities of using the fiber independent of the skin. In the Middle Ages wool became the staple industry of England, and its importance is handed down in the legend of the “woolsack” in Parliament. It seems that Edward III did not wish his Parliament to forget that the country’s prosperity depended on its commerce, of which wool was then the principal item, so he ordered that sacks of wool should be placed in the House of Lords. A Lord Chancellor evidently found that these sacks were comfortable to sit on, and in time the “woolsack”’ became the recognised seat of this official. It is probable that cotton did not come into use as a textile fiber until long after both flax and wool. It was evidently first used in India thousands of years ago. Its introduction into European trade is of comparatively recent date, it being first imported and spun into yarn in the early part of the eighteenth century. At first it was used only as a filling yarn with a linen warp, and it was not until 1783 that the first all-cotton cloth was made in Lancashire. The use of silk was discovered in historic times, being used at a very early period in Asia, and only came into Europe in the Middle Ages. At first it was used only as embroidery and decorative material, but ultimately was used for weaving. During the World War the Germans fell back on the use of paper for the making of textile yarns. This, however, was not a very new invention, as paper yarns have long been used by the Japanese, and it is also probable that something similar was employed by the ancients. Wires of metal have also been used for weaving; threads of gold and silver having long been employed as decorative material in the weaving of cloth. 4 GENERAL CLASSIFICATION sary that a continuous thread or yarn be prepared from the fiber and for the manufacture of such a yarn certain qualities are necessary and certain others are desirable. 4. Tensile Strength.—Probably the most important quality is tensile strength, for if the individual fiber does not possess in itself considerable strength it will not be possible to make from it a yarn suitable for use in the arts. There are a number of fibers, especially among the vegetable class (such as those of the common milkweed, etc.), which might prove of considerable value but for their lack of sufficient tensile strength. The four fibers mentioned in a preceding paragraph as the most important are all characterised by a high tensile strength. Although dependent also on other qualities, the resistance of a fiber to use and wear is primarily dependent on its tensile strength. 5. Length of Fiber.—The second important quality which determines the usefulness of a textile fiber is its length. It is, of course, very easy to understand even without resort to technical explanations, that where a continuous thread is to be made up of a large number of individual elements, these elements must possess a considerable length with reference to their thickness, otherwise it would not be possible to make a thread that would hold together. In a general way and other conditions being equal, the strength of such a thread will be directly proportional to the length of the individual fiber elements employed. On this account a yarn composed of the long fibers of Sea Island cotton is much stronger than a similar yarn prepared from the relatively short fibers of upland cotton. The lowest economic limit in length for fibers to be employed for purposes of spinning is about 5 mm. Fibers of less length than this, however, are available for paper making. During the recent war, when suitable fibers were not available in Germany, processes were developed for the spinning of very short staples from waste and reworked materials. 6. Cohesiveness.—A third essential quality for a textile fiber is cohe- siveness. By this is meant the property of the individual fibers cohering or holding on to one another when spun into a yarn. This is usually brought about by the surface of the fibers possessing a high degree of frictional resistance. The surface of wool, for instance, is quite rough and serrated by reason of the projecting edges of its epidermal scales, the same as the surface of a fish. These projections easily catch in one another, so that when several wool fibers are twisted. together they offer con- siderable frictional resistance to being pulled apart. Cotton also possesses an irregular surface which manifests a high degree of friction and this is greatly accentuated by the occurrence of many twists in the fiber which interlock when several fibers are spun together, and thus prevent the elements of the yarn from slipping apart when subjected to strain. Linen (and other analogous vegetable fibers) has also a roughened surface, and PLIABILITY; ELASTICITY 5 furthermore possesses knot-like formations throughout its length which, of course, greatly enhance the surface friction of the fiber. Silk, on the other hand, when considered as the purified fiber, has a comparatively smooth surface, and its cohesiveness when employed as a spun fiber, as in the case of waste silk, is chiefly due to its great length in proportion to its thickness which allows of the fiber elements of the yarn wrapping around one another a great number of times, giving rise in this manner to great frictional resistance. When silk is not employed as a spun fiber as in the case of thrown silk yarns, the individual elements of the yarn must be considered as practically continuous filaments. The lack of cohesiveness in many minor vegetable fibers, such as ramie and the several varieties of so-called vegetable silks, greatly reduces their other- wise practical value as spinning fibers. The latter fibers more especially possess very smooth surfaces, and consequently they slip over one another in a yarn and are easily pulled apart. 7. Pliability; Elasticity—Another quality which is very essential to a satisfactory textile fiber is pliability, which permits of one fiber being easily wrapped around another in the spinning operation. The stiffer and more wiry the nature of a fiber, the less is it adapted to the purposes of textile use. The fibers of ordinary wool, for instance, are very pliable, and are employed in the production of a wide variety of fabrics for which a stiff wiry fiber, such as horsehair, would be entirely unsuitable. The pliability of a fiber also determines in great measure its elasticity and resiliency, qualities which are often of prime importance in the manufacture of textile fabrics. Lack of these properties will make the fiber and its result- ing products brittle and unyielding, and hence greatly limit the field of its usefulness. Fibers of glass, for instance, however fine they may be prepared, have a very narrow range of utility. 8. Fineness of Staple—Furthermore, a fiber must possess sufficient fineness of staple to be useful in the production of spun yarns. The principal fibers all have very small diameters and a large number of them can be twisted together to yield a fine thread. Other things being equal, the finer the staple of the fiber, the finer the yarn which can be produced from it. The coarse vegetable fibers, such as jute, hemp, sisal, etc., can only be used for textile purposes in the production of crude, low-grade fabrics; the chief uses of such fibers being for the manufacture of bagging, cordage, etc. 9. Uniformity of Staple-—Besides these more properly termed essential qualities, there are a number of others which more or less determine the value of a fiber for textile purposes. Uniformity of staple is a valuable property; by this is meant evenness in the length and diameter of the individual fibers. This enhances the spinning quality very much and aids in the production of an even thread. If in one variety of cotton, for 6 GENERAL CLASSIFICATION instance, the individual fibers vary widely in their length and diameter, its value will be much less than another variety in which these dimen- sions are more uniform. As both wool and cotton in their natural state show considerable variation in the size of the individual] fibers, in order to heighten the quality of the yarns produced a process known as “combing” is utilised, whereby the longer fibers are separated from the shorter ones, and hence much greater uniformity in staple is obtained. The more uniform the length of the fibers, the more even, and hence stronger, will be the resulting yarn. 10. Porosity; Capillarity— Another desirable quality for a textile fiber to possess is that of porosity or capillarity. By this is meant that the fiber should be capable of easily absorbing liquids and solutions and of permitting these thoroughly to permeate its substance.! This property is important as it allows of the dyeing, bleaching, and otherwise pre- paring the fibers by modifying their natural condition. Fibers that could not be dyed or bleached would have but a limited application in the manu- facture of textiles. ' 11. Luster—A further quality, which under certain conditions enhances the value of a textile fiber. is luster. Fibers possessing this quality to a marked degree, such as silk, mercerized cotton, and certain kinds of wool, are capable of producing a wide variety of beautiful effects. Luster, however, is not an essential quality in a fiber as regards usefulness; it is only an ornamental quality which adds to the beauty of the product. 12. Durability—There are two other features which must also be considered with reference to the textile fibers as well as to any other manu- | factured article. The first of these is durability, by which is meant that the substance of which the fiber is composed must possess a degree of permanence which permits of its general use; it must be capable of with- | standing the conditions of wear to which it may be reasonably subjected. The use of artificial silk (lustra-cellulose), for instance, is greatly limited by reason of the fact that this fiber becomes much weakened and is liable to undergo disintegration when moistened with water. The principal textile fibers are all very resistant to the ordinary conditions of wear, more so, in fact, than many of the raw materials used in the preparation of most manufactured articles. 13. Commercial Availability—The second feature to which reference | is made has principally an economic significance. In order to possess commercial value a fiber must be available in large quantity, and its supply must be more or less constant and readily marketed; it furthermore must. | 1Gaidukov (Zeit. Farb. Ind., 1908, p. 251) has made an extensive study of various textile fibers by ultramicroscopic methods and has confirmed the opinion that the — fibers are of a colloidal character. The ultramicrophotographs published by Zeiss & Co., in connection with this research, are very instructive and interesting. CLASSIFICATION OF FIBERS BY ORIGIN | be cheap. It is possible to use spider's silk, for example, as a textile fiber for certain purposes, but the supply of this material is small and uncertain, and there are many difficulties in the way of its production which would doubtless prevent it ever becoming a staple article of commerce. ‘There are a large number of vegetable fibers which examination shows to possess many valuable properties for textile purposes, but the practical supply of which is so uncertain as to render them unworthy of commercial consideration. . 14. Classification of Fibers by Origin.—Though textile fibers in general consist of a wide range of materials, for convenience in study they may be Fig. 1.—Wool Fiber Emerging from Skin Tissue. divided into four distinct classes, as follows: (a) animal fibers, (b) vege- table fibers, (c) mineral fibers, (d) artificial fibers. According to a very complete compilation of M. Bernardin in his Nomenclature uselle des fibers tertiles, the number of plant fibers used by the human species is more than 550 and perhaps about 700. Calculating in addition thereto the mineral fibers (asbestos and kindred substances) as well as the various packing materials, spun fibers, brush materials, and animal hairs, and silk, the number of single substances would probably amount to 1000, if not more. 8 GENERAL CLASSIFICATION These raw materials can occur in different forms, and many of them are important. Sheep’s wool, for instance, is known in as many as 50 different varieties. It is clear that the various characteristics of all these forms would be very difficult to delineate and to differentiate from each other. The solution of such numerous questions as would be raised by the com- parative investigation of so many objects would necessitate the accumu- lation of a large mass of unimportant details and divert the attention of the observer from the main points. In fact most of the exotic fibers are unimportant or are only employed in the localities in which they are grown. 15. Animal and Vegetable Fibers.—According to their origin, we may divide the principal fibers into two general classes, those derived from animal and those derived from vegetable life. The former includes wool and silk, and the latter cotton and linen. . Animal fibers are essentially nitrogenous substances (protein matter), and in some cases contain sulfur. Protein matter is of the character of albumen, and forms one of the principal ingredients of animal tissues. It is essentially nitrogenous in composition and is especially characterised by the peculiar empyreumatic odor evolved when it is burned. One of the readiest and most conclusive tests, in fact, which may be used to distinguish between an animal and a vegetable fiber is to notice the odor evolved on | burning in the air. With regard to their physical condition, it may be said that the proteids composing the animal fibers are essentially of a colloidal nature; that is, they resemble a solidified jelly in condition. This property of the fibers may be used, to a great extent, to explain their action with solutions of dyestuffs and metallic salts, in which the theory of solid solution, adsorption, and osmosis comes into play. Alkalies readily attack the animal fibers, causing them to be dissolved, but they. withstand the action of mineral acids to a considerable degree. Contrary to the vege- | table fibers, they are readily injured if exposed to elevated © temperatures. 16. Vegetable Fibers.—These consist of plant cells usually rather simple in structure and forming an integral part of the plant itself. Plant cells are of different character and size depending on the part of the plant in which they Fia. 2—Cells of occur and the office or function they perform in the develop- Wood Tissue. ment of the plant tissue. These cells consist of tubes gener- (X500.) ally between 0.001 in. and 0.002 in. in diameter; their ends are usually pointed and in their arrangement overlap one another. (See Fig. 2.) In the fibrous layers occurring in plants these cells are sufficiently long and so interlaced as to give a fiber of considerable purposes. In monocotyle- dons, according to Dr. Morris, the fibrous cells are found built up with vessels into a composite structure known as fibrovascular bundles; these bundles occur in the leaves and stems, but not in the outer bark of plants (see Fig. 3), and are usually found imbedded in a soft cellular tissue known as parenchyma. The vegetable fibers are cap- able of withstanding rather high temperatures, and are not weakened or disintegrat- ed by the action of dilute alkalies. They consist essen- tially of cellulose, which may be in a very pure form or be mixed with its various alteration products. In some cases the fiber consists _ chemical means, alkalies produce alteration products with the vegetable fibers.

Concentrated Free - sulfuric or hydrochloric acid, even if only moderately strong, will quickly attack the fiber, disintegrating its organic structure and forming hydrolysed products. Nitric acid, on the other hand, forms nitrated celluloses (the so-called nitro-celluloses) and various oxidation derivatives. It is generally considered that the animal fibers have a lower conduc- tivity for heat’ than have the vegetable fibers, and in consequence fabrics made from wool and silk are warmer than those made from cotton and linen. From actual tests, however, it would seem that this quality was due more to the structure of the fabric than to the character of the fiber. According to Dietz the specific heats of the various fibers are as follows: 1) Spice: 1) 10,8 eee aes eee Boiled-off silk......... Worsted yarn.......... Artificial silk. ........ GENERAL CLASSIFICATION Asbestosis 55 Glass wool Straw Count Rumford made some interesting experiments relative to the “heat-retaining value” of various clothing materials. He heated a large thermometer to a given temperature and then ascertained the length of time required for the thermometer to fall to a given point when surrounded with the various materials experimented upon. The times taken by the thermometer in falling from 70° to 10° Réaumur, when surrounded with various substances, were as follows: Seconds. In another series of experiments, however, using the same materials differently arranged, very different results were obtained: Seconds. Sheep’s wool, loosely arranged Woolen thread, wound round bulb Cotton, loose Cotton thread, wound round bulb Lint, loose Linen thread, wound round bulb Linen cloth, ditto From these experiments, Rumford showed that the heat-retaining value of clothing depends more on its texture than on its actual material. For further consideration of this subject, see. Mattieu Williams’ book on The Philosophy of Clothing. 17. Mineral Fibers.—The mineral. fibers are of rather rare occurrence in the textile industry as compared with the extensive use of the preceding classes of fibers. The mineral fiber asbestos, however, is finding an : increased use for certain purposes, and consequently deserves to be classi- fied and considered in a comprehensive study of the textile fibers. Asbestos SPUN GLASS 11 is practically the only natural mineral fiber with which we are acquainted, the other mineral fibers, such as spun glass and mineral wool or slag fiber, are all artificial fibers, and are better considered under that class. 18. The Artificial Fibers.—These may be divided into two groups: (a) those of mineral origin and (6) those of animal or vegetable origin. In the first division may be classed such fibers as spun glass, metallic threads, and slag wool; in the second division may be put the various artificial silks, such as lustra-cellulose and gelatine silk. 19. Spun Glass.—Fibers of spun glass are prepared by drawing out molten glass in the form of very fine threads. It is said that such threads can be drawn out so fine that it takes about 1400 miles of the fiber to weigh 1 lb. Colored glasses may be used to give rise to variously colored threads. Owing to its brittle nature and lack of elasticity, spun glass receives a very limited application, it being made into various ornamental objects, and sometimes into cravats. Though fabrics composed entirely of glass are rare, yet colored glass threads are somewhat used for the weft in silk materials for the purpose of producing novel effects, as the glass gives the fabric great luster and stiffness. A variety of spun glass known as glass wool is used to some extent in the chemical laboratory as a filtering medium for liquids which would destroy ordinary filter paper. Glass wool is curly, this property being given to it by drawing out the glass thread from two pieces of glass of different degrees of hardness; and by unequal contraction on cooling, this double thread acquires a set curl. Spinning glass for commercial uses is an important new industry which has been developed in Venice within the past several years. The spun glass is marketed in three forms—hanks of spun glass thread of straight fiber called Cotone di Vetro (glass cotton), masses of spun glass curled fiber ealled Lano di Vetro (glass wool), and either of the above qualities pressed into sheets or pads from #4 to 4 in. in thickness that resemble white felt pads. At present the principal use made of this product is for insulation, and especially for making separators for accumulators of electricity; but the glass wool would serve admirably for making artificial hair, wigs, perukes, dolls’ hair, Santa Claus beards, and other purposes, and in the pad form it serves as a hygienic filter. The processes of manufacture are simple. Solid glass rods, about 2 ft. 6 ins. long and of the thickness of a lead pencil, are made of pure soda glass that contains no adulteration of lead or other metal. The absence of. lead and adulterations gives the quality of perfect flexibility to the fiber. On a simple.desk is mounted a Bunsen burner or gas flame and blowpipe. By the side of the desk is mounted an ordinary bicycle wheel, minus the rubber tire, that revolves rapidly and regularly at rhyth- mic’ speed under power furnished by a small electric motor. A girl sits at. the desk, melts the end of the glass rod in the flame of the gas burner, 12 GENERAL CLASSIFICATION draws it to a thread and throws the thread around the wheel. If the thread breaks, she must repeat the process; if not, she slowly revolves the end of the rod in the constant flame, and it is automatically spun to a very thin filament. The hank of thread on the wheel, when it has assumed the dimensions of a bicycle tire, is taken off. Separated with the fingers, it curls and fluffs out like wool if the thread is sufficiently fine. It is packed in the hank as glass cotton, in the fluff as glass wool, and in the compressed form as glass wool or cotton according to the fineness of the fiber. The cheaper grades of spun glass formerly came from Germany; it is claimed that the Italian article is superior. 20. Metallic Threads.— Metal yarns or threads consisting of various metals drawn out into filaments are used in decorative fabrics. Gold, silver, copper, and various alloys are used for this purpose, the metals being heated to redness or until they are in a softened condition. At the present time metallic threads are largely imitated by coating linen yarns with a thin film of gold or silver. Threads of pure gold are seldom made; what is known as pure-gold thread is a fine silver wire covered with a thin layer of gold. Silver thread is sometimes made with a core of copper and a layer of silver. Lyon’s gold thread consists of copper faced with gold. Metallic threads are usually made into a flattened or band-like form by rolling, By twisting with silk or woolen yarns, the so-called brilliant yarns are made. The Cyprian gold thread of old embroideries consists of a linen or silk thread around which is twisted a cover of gilded catgut. Bayko metal yarn is a textile product recently introduced. It consists of a core of cotton, silk, or other thread, which is coated with a solution of cellulose acetate containing in suspension finely divided particles of metals. The yarn is thus given a metallic coating, yet furnishes a durable and flexible thread. Microscopical examination of this yarn shows each filament to consist of a core or nucleus, and an enveloping layer. The core is usually a twofold cotton thread, while the envelope is a colorless to pale yellow substance. The average cross-section of a single filament is 0.0372 sq. mm. The cross-section of the envelope is 0.0133 sq. mm., or 35.8 percent of the total. The metric size averaged 29.6; the thickness of the filament 0.191 mm.; the tensile strength averaged 462 gms., and the elasticity 4.9 percent. Another process of metallising yarn consists in coating the yarn with a solution containing a metallic powder and an adhesive liquid. Casein has been used, but the adhesion is not durable. Others have preferred gelatin which adheres to the yarn more firmly, but is open to the objection of being very hygroscopic, causing mold. Attempts have been made to protect the metallised yarn against the action of moisture by applying a transparent solution of celluloid or collodion, but this gives the SLAG WOOL 13 yarn a lustrous appearance different from that of metal. Edmond Dhun- nausen has found after repeated experiments that casein glue adheres firmly when the yarn has been previously treated with a mixture of gelatine and a powder insoluble in that material. The casein glue is loaded with the metallic powder to give the desired appearance. The yarn is passed through a bath consisting of: aa alasal alah «4 9) ¢ 0in a ee 25 parts Miotalle powder. 2.2. ee ee ee eine D5i (OOS 1) SRR AE UP OM OE 25 ae After drying for about twenty minutes the yarn is passed through a bath made up as follows: UR oi 0 Gil RS A Os Pd RR kh 15 parts RN in cs «sz babes ceipets Wis ie hs 5 =e > ee Be os Rais occ c's cg hone eee orton Wie) +01 » 2 = facgealaReeeas RO Metallic POWdEr. .. . ee ne oe oe a ae = 0 aig After drying a second time very rapidly the yarn is passed through a second bath of the same composition. The weight of the metallic powder used varies according to the specific gravity and the nature of the material. The effect can be varied by adding different colors to the last bath. Probably the most successful method for metallising yarns or fabrics, and for the making of metallic prints, is the use of Bakelite (a formaldehyde condensation product of phenol) as a medium and binder for the metallic powder. This process was developed by Zundel at Moscow. Another process for the metallisation of fabries is described by Lang! as follows: “4 golution of India rubber in naphtha or other solvent is prepared and a metallic powder added and the whole mixed until a homogeneous liquid is obtained. ‘The fabric is wetted in the liquid and dried. A trace of amyl acetate may be added to the liquid to give a better luster. An example is given in which 16 parts by weight of naphtha, 2 of India rubber, 2 of metallic powder and 0.5 of amyl acetate are used.” Metallic threads are used for quite a large number of fabrics, such as passementerie work, trimmings, brocades, decorative embroidery, church vestments, fancy costumes, tapestries, fancy vestings, etc. 21. Slag Wool.—Slag wool is prepared by blowing steam through molten slag; it can scarcely be called a textile fiber, but it is used in some degree as a packing material. It (also known as mineral wool and in England as silicate cotton) is an interesting by-product from the blast furnace. The process of manufacture consists in subjecting a small stream of molten slag to a strong blast of steam or compressed air. This has the effect of breaking it up into minute spherules, and each small bead particle as it is blown away carries behind it a thread of finely drawn-out 1 Fr, Pat. 509,492. 14 GENERAL CLASSIFICATION slag, thus forming extremely delicate filaments resembling fine glass threads. These fine threads are often 2 to 3 ft. in length, but readily break up into smaller ones and in bulk look like a mass of cotton of a dingy white color. The fiber is classified according to fineness into two grades (1) ordinary, including all fiber weighing over 14 lbs. and less than 24 lbs. per cubic foot; and (2) extraordinary, includ‘ng fiber weighing less than 14 lbs. per cubic foot. Slag wool has the property of great lightness combined with that of being absolutely fireproof; it is also a very good non-conductor of heat and sound. Slag wool is not spun into yarns or made into fabrics after the manner of asbestos, but is used as a felt consist- ing of fine, interlocking mineral fibers enclosing a mass of minute air cells which gives it the property of being such a good non-conductor of heat. Coleman, in this connection, gives the following table showing the relative heat-conducting powers of various materials: Slag wool Hair felt The fibers of slag wool are very brittle and the fine, sharp points readily cut into the skin. In factories making this material care should be taken to properly protect the workmen from getting the fine needlelike particles into the eyes and lungs. Another disadvantage of slag wool is that it usually contains sulfur, so when it is in contact with water or moisture, sulfuric acid is gradually formed, which may result in the corrosion of metallic surfaces. This defect may be obviated by the selection of slag free from sulfur for the preparation of the fiber. 22. Artificial Silks.—Artificial silks are made from cellulose derivatives by forcing solutions of these through fine capillary tubes, coagulating the resulting threads, and subsequently subjecting them to various processes of chemical treatment. As these belong more strictly to the class of true textile fibers, they will be given a more extensive consideration, in a further section, as being derivatives of cellulose. 23. Other Forms of Artificial Fibers.—During the World War a number of different artificial fibers were developed in Germany. One of these is interestingly described as follows: By grinding with water in a ball-mill or other suitable means, wool, hairs, horn, leather, and their wastes, such as dust, clippings, and short fibers which are too small of themselves to permit of their use in the ordinary way, can be very finely divided. While finely ground substances of this kind cannot be used for the manufacture of paper except under great difficulties, as there is no cohesion between the individual particles, nor can they be used for artificial silk manufacture, FIBER MICROSCOPY 55 ‘t has been found that it is possible to produce from these substances fibers which can be spun. This is done by making films by forming a solution of the wastes in question with suitable substances such as gelatine, size, acetyl cellulose, or other viscous solutions of cellulose or cellulose compounds. The films are cut up into fine fibers which are suitable for spinning, or the films are cut into strips, or produced in strip form so that these can be spun in the manner adopted for paper yarns. By this method new fibers and spun yarns can be produced which—especially when gelatine or size is the binding medium—possess the properties of wool to a very high degree. In order to render gelatine or size (glue) insoluble, the necessary quantity of a chrome compound (bichromate or chrome alum) is added to the mixture. Materials for producing pliability can be added, such as glycerol or certain ester compounds, such as triphenyl phosphates. Oils and fats can also be added, especially those that do not dry and that form emulsions easily. The film may be experimentally produced as follows: Upon a 13X18 em. glass plate covered with a thin layer of wax the following mixture is worked up, evenly distributed and then dried at a moderate temperature: 2 ec. of a 5 percent solution of gelatine. 3 ec. of a 10 percent paste of the finest ground wool. 0 1 ec. of glycerol. ec. of a 5 percent chrome alum solution. When this mixture is dry it forms a non-curling elastic film about 0.07 mm. thick, which can easily be removed from the wax coating. Thin or thick films can be obtained according to the quantity of the mixture. Even films of 0.03 mm. have been found to be of use. These films can be cut into extremely fine fibers by employing suitable cutting devices; and then they may be spun alone or mixed with other fibers. Instead of using the binding medium mentioned above, the finely ground wastes can be mixed with paper pulp, paper being obtained from the mixture; this is then parchmented in the ordinary manner with a sulfuric acid of 1.7 sp. gr. or with a warm solution of zine chloride of 1.9 sp. gr., and then washed. In this way parchment papers can be obtained which have a wool content of 50 percent and more, and which by suitable treatment and additions can be made pliable and waterproof. 94. Fiber Microscopy.—The examination of textile fibers under the microscope is a very important and essential aid to a study of these materials. Microscopy in any case requires the acquisition of a certain amount of delicate technique and skill on the part of the observer, and this is particularly true in the case of fiber microscopy. A knowledge of the proper methods of preparing specimens for examination, of mount- 16 GENERAL CLASSIFICATION ing them and of the proper selection of lenses, is of importance. The markings and the structure of the various fibers can only be brought out in their characteristic appearance by the employment of careful skill and this can only be developed by considerable practice and a close knowledge of the possibilities of the microscope. The preparation of micrographs and of microphotographs so as to bring out the characteristic features of the specimens under examination also requires considerable study and experience, and in the latter case, an additional knowledge of the possi- bilities and limitations of photography. It is not possible at this point to take up in detail the subjects of microscopy and its related branches, although it will be well to present to the reader some of the leading features relating particularly to the field of fiber microscopy, with a brief consideration of the apparatus required and the methods of preparing and examining the specimens. In the first place, a fairly good microscope is required, with a good system of the best lenses. While excessive magnification is not neces- sary, the lens system should be selected so as to obtain a clear flat achro- matic field which will admit of a good focus over a considerable area. It must be borne in mind that fibers are more or less rounded filaments and are not thin, flat specimens like the delicate cross-sections of objects that are mostly the subjects used in microscopy. On this account it is necessary to have a good depth of focus in order to prevent undue distor- tion of the fiber which might lead the unskilled observer to a very errone- ous idea of the markings on the subject. A very complete range of mag- nifications may be obtained with the use of No. 5 and No. 10 eye-pieces in combination with the following objectives: 2 in. (16 mm.), 3 in. (4 mm.) and 7g in. (1.9mm.). The last-named objective requires an oil immersion system and is only used for very high powers and delicate work which would be somewhat out of the ordinary. The following table gives the various magnifications available with the objectives and eye-pieces mentioned: Objective. Kye-pieces. No. 5. No. 10 3 in. or 16 mm. 50 100 4 in. or 4 mm. 215 430 7s in. or 1.9 mm. 475 950 It is well to have a microscope set fitted with a revolving nose-piece for two or three objectives so that the fiber may first be picked up with a low power and then observed finally with a suitable high power. An adjustable stage is also convenient for moving the specimen mount and for locating positions. The use of a sub-stage diaphragm and condenser for obtaining proper conditions of illumination is also quite important in FIBER MICROSCOPY 3 17 good fiber microscopy, as very frequently important points of observation can only be brought out by adjusting the illumination of the specimen. An achromatic sub-stage condenser and an iris diaphragm are usually supplied with the better sets of microscopes. The accompanying illus- tration (Fig. 4) shows a popular form of microscope with the necessary accessories suitable for E a . 4 m —Eyepieee fiber investigations. itl | Fiber specimens may | | D-Draw Tabe be mounted in various fle > ways; for temporary fi mounts and rapid ob- servation an ordinary water mount may be used. The fibersshould be well separated so that as few as possible cross over one another, and if necessary cut in short lengths to come within the area of the cover glass. These fibers are then laid neatly on the glass slide, a drop of water is touched to them by means of a dropper or a glass rod, and then the cover glass Pillar P}|\\2 is laid over them and Mik gently pressed down so as to flatten out the specimen. In making observations under high | om power it is especially mh necessary thatthe fibers Fic. 4—Diagram of Microscope Showing Essential Parts. be as single as possible, for if. several are piled up across one another the focus becomes distorted, and unless the observer is skilled in these observations he may mistake shadows for important markings. The water mount is only of a temporary character, as the cover glass is just loosely held in place and the water quickly evaporates. Where a permanent mount is desired, or where it is necessary to have a very flat field for high power observation, the speci- men may be mounted in Canada Balsam, which dries like a varnish and cements the cover glass firmly in place. This kind of mounting, however, | ill T-Body Tube IH Revolving I))|: ‘li Nosepiece <= O-Objectives [l]s-Staze em = TS 11M|_ SS-Sub Stage B-Base 18 GENERAL CLASSIFICATION generally makes the fiber very transparent and may obliterate many of the characteristic markings both on the surface and in the interior. To bring out these markings it may be necessary to first treat the speci- men with certain reagents, such as various stains used especially in micros- copy, silver nitrate and other chemicals. Glycerol, cedar oil and some other mediums are also used at times for mounting fiber specimens. The effect of mounting in different media is shown in F ig. 5, which shows a fiber of Egyptian cotton mounted as follows: (1) plain air mount; (2) ‘ he . f = b et 254 Fia. 5.—Cotton Fibers Mounted in: (A) Air, (B) Water, (C) Glycerol, (D) Cedar oil, (Z) Anisol, (F) Mono-bromnaphthalene, (Herzog.) in water; (3) in glycerol; (4) in cedar oil; (5) in anisol; (6) in mono- bromnaphthalene. It is often desirable to draw the appearance of the fiber under the microscope so as to preserve a permanent record. For this purpose several forms of projection attachments to the microscope are available, such as the Abbe ocular shown in Fig. 6. Another form of apparatus is shown in Fig. 7. Both of these instruments project the image down on a piece of paper on which the outlines are drawn. A more satisfactory though more complicated and costly equipment for projection drawing is FIBER MICROSCOPY 19 shown in Fig. 8. In making these drawings or micrographs, however, a certain amount of skill and talent at drawing is required, but this can be developed with experience and painstaking care. It is usually necessary Fic. 6.—Abbe Projection Apparatus for Drawirg from Microscope. (Bausch & Lomb.) for the observer to possess good draughting abilities, however, to obtain satisfactory results. A polariscopic attachment is also of considerable use in the observa- tion of fibers under the microscope, as this brings out the interior structure of the fiber in a remarkable manner; it is especially useful in obtaining good micro-photographs where struc- tural qualities are desired (see Fig. 9). To obtain permanent records of fiber microscopy so that the appear- ance of the specimen may be studied and observed at leisure, it is neces- sary to use a photographic attachment whereby a real photograph may be taken of the magnified object. A very useful form of such an apparatus is shown in Fig. 10, and it is well to use a special electric lamp for illumina- Fic. 7—Attachment used for Projection Drawing.

Further details as to such preparations will be considered under the microscopic examination of the various fibers. Fia. 9.—Polariscopic Attachment for Microscope; (A) Polariser, (B) Analyser. (Bausch & Lomb.) A very necessary adjunct for the measurement of fiber diameters is the micrometer ocular. This not only serves for the simple observation of fibers, but also for their measurement. For this purpose, a glass plate on which a small scale is etched is placed between the ocular and the con- densing lens. Sometimes the scale is photographed on the plate. It is FIBER MICROSCOPY 21 usually a centimeter divided into 100 parts, or a half-centimeter divided into 50 parts. If a fiber of a certain thickness is examined several times successively with this micrometric ocular, but with different objectives, it will be noticed that the divisions on the scale always remain the same size, but the fiber will appear larger or smaller depending on the strength Fic. 10.—Installation for Preparing Photomicrographs of Fibers. (Bausch & Lomb.) of the objective. From this it is evident that a division on the micro- metric scale will have different values, depending upon the lens system with which it is used. The ocular micrometer is therefore standardised for each system on an objective micrometer, which is a very finely divided scale ruled on glass. 25. Statistical—The industries related to the preparation and utilisa- tion of textile fibers rank among the most important in the industrial life 22 GENERAL CLASSIFICATION of all nations. In the United States the cotton, wool and silk industries are of vast extent, not only with respect to the manufacturing part, but also to the merchandising and distribution of the products. In England the cotton and woolen industries form the chief sources of the wealth of the nation. In our own country the cotton industry ranks easily first with a capital investment of nearly two billions of dollars and with a yearly value of products exceeding this sum. Second in importance come the industries related to the wool fiber, including woolen and worsted goods. A very close third is the silk industry, with a capitalisation of over half a billion dollars, and with a present output of about three-fourths of a Fie 11—Microtome for Cutting Fiber Sections. (Bausch & Lomb.) billion dollars in value of manufactured goods. To the fiber industries proper must also be added that relating to the manufacture of artificial silk, though this is considered more specifically under the term of chemical industry. The size of this latter industry is growing with great rapidity in this country, and will soon rank with the silk industry itself in importance and economic value.

The word is derived from the Greek and was used by Dioscorides and other Greek writers as a term for quicklime, but Pliny fixed its meaning in its modern sense. It is a fibrous silicate of magnesium and calcium, though often containing iron and aluminium in its composition, especially in the dark-colored varieties. The general term “asbestos” includes the fibrous varieties of both serpentine and hornblende. Serpentine is a compound silicate of magnesium and calcium, always containing iron, and generally also some manganese. Hornblende (also known as amphibole) is very similar in composition, but often contains aluminium. The composition of asbestos from different parts of the world differs considerably, as the following analyses indicate: Thetford, Canada, Percent. Cyprus, Italy, Percent. Percent. Templite, Percent. Silica (SiO2) 40.50 40.30 40.57 40.52 Alumina (Al.O3) 1.09 2: Be 0.90 2:10 Tron oxide (Fe.O;) 4.87 0.87 2.81 1.97 Magnesia (MgQ) 39.02 43 .37 41.50 42.05 Water (H.O) 13.47 13.72 1305 13.46 Canadian asbestos is considered best, and provides about 75 percent of the world’s consumption of this material. The asbestos mineral, though in the form of a hard rock, can be easily separated into slender white fibers (Figs. 12, 13 and 14), sometimes inclin- ing toward a greenish color. The asbestos mineral has a density of 2.5 to 2.8, and a hardness of 3 to 5. The individual fibers of asbestos are so fine as to approach the limits of microscopic measurement, which is 2 micron=0.0005 mm.! There is no reason for supposing that these ‘The micron is a unit of measurement much used in microscopic work; it is equivalent to one-thousandth millimeter. The symbol mu or Greek letter u is often | used for the term micron, 24 VARIETIES OF ASBESTOS 25 extremely fine fibers of asbestos may not be capable of still further sub- division; in fact, there appears to be scarcely any limit to this possible subdivision (see Fig. 15). The asbestos fiber, however, is evidently a crystal and is angular and not round; pre- sumably the cross- section is square, though this has yet to be definitely estab- lished. Owing to the unlimited splitting of the fiber it is difficult under the microscope to determine its proper Fia. 12.—Chrysotile Asbestos from Canada. form. 2. Varieties of Asbestos.—The fibers of some varieties are curly, and afford the best material for spinning. Italy was perhaps the first of modern nations to use asbestos as a textile material. Experiments in this line were encouraged in Lombardy by Napoleon I, but it was not until about 1866 that any practical commercial results were obtained, and both asbes- tos cloth and paper were made. No serious at- tempt was made to mine Canadian asbestos until 1878, when the valuable deposits at Thetford and Black Lake in Quebec wereexploited. The finest quality of long “floss ”’ asbestos fiber is still ob- tained from the Italian mineral. There is a piece of asbestos cloth in the Fig. 13.—Piece of Asbestos Rock as Mineral. Vatican Museum said to (Johns-Manville Co.) date from Roman times; it is of rather coarse con- struction and was evidently made by spinning the asbestos with vege- table fiber (linen). Asbestos cloth was noted by Marco Polo (thirteenth century) in his travels in Tartary and China. The lamp wicks men- tioned by Plutarch as used in the ‘“‘nerpetual” lamps of the Vestal Virgins were made of asbestos fiber. Pausanias refers to such wicks 26 ASBESTOS AS A TEXTILE FIBER as made from ‘“Carpasian” linen, evidently meaning the mineral fiber obtained from Carpasius in Cyprus. Asbestos fiber is known in Germany as “steinflachs” (stone-flax), in Italy as “amiantho,” and the French Canadian calls it ‘pierre & coton” (cotton-stone). The Italian asbestos (see F ig. 16) is mineralogically distinct, both in form and appearance, from the Canadian chrysotile. Notwithstanding their physical differences, however, their chemical composition is very Fie. 14.—Asbestos Rock Broken Apart Showing Fine Fibrous Structure. (Johns-Manville Co.) similar, and when reduced to commercial fiber, they are practically identical. The blue asbestos of South Africa is the mineral crocidolite. The fiber is easily separated by the fingers; the sp. gr. is 3.20 to 3.30 ; the luster is very silky and the color is a dull lavender blue, due to the presence of ferrous oxide. The fibers are quite elastic and often several inches long. Its chemical composition is quite different from either chrysotile or Italian hornblende, being as follows: Percent. 1 EAT RC i i nn A el eo 49.6 Tron sesquioxide Iron protoxide VARIETIES OF ASBESTOS 27 As compared with Canadian asbestos it has a high tensile strength but poor heat-resisting qualities, and this greatly limits its commercial value. There is considerable confusion and misconception as to the proper mineralogical character of asbestos, and this has probably arisen from the use of the name in a somewhat generic sense. Dana, in his Mineralogy, says that asbestos is a finely fibrous form of hornblende, but much that is so called is fibrous serpentine. This statement seems to have divided most writers on the subject into two camps, the one calling the mineral a variety of hornblende, while the other claims it to be derived from. serpentine. The asbestos of commerce is really a hydrated silicate: of: magnesium, of the same com- pies position as ordinary serpen- tine rock; in other words, it is a fibrous serpentine. In a mineralogical sense the term asbestos is really a generic one, and the mineral occurs in a variety of species, some of which are much more valuable than others for fiber purposes. In some the fibers are slender and easily separ- able, and of a white or green- ish color. A variety known as amianthus gives fibers of a fine silky quality. Ligni- form asbestos 18 a hard com- Fic. 15.—Asbestos Fiber. (X5.) (Micrograph by author.) pact variety, resembling petri- fied wood in appearance, and brownish to yellowish in color; a wool-like variety found near Vesuvius is known as breislakite. Mountain flax, mountain cork, and mountain leather are all varieties of asbestos, the last consisting of a naturally felted mass of asbestos fibers. The chief commercial variety of asbestos is a form of serpentine and it differs from the hornblende variety in that it contains about 14 percent of water in its composition. Picrolite is another fibrous variety of ser- pentine and closely resembles coarse asbestos (see Fig. 17). It occurs in nearly all Canadian asbestos mines and is known as bastard asbestos. The fiber is sometimes very long (over a foot) but is harsh and brittle and unsuited for commercial purposes. Chrysotile asbestos furnishes the most valuable commercial fiber as it combines the best length and fineness of fiber with infusibility, tensile strength and flexibility.

With a small percentage of water the fiber becomes brittle and will not spin. The softness of the fiber is proportional to the water content; a very silky asbestos may contain 15 percent of water, whereas that containing 11 percent or less is brittle Fic. 18.—Crushed Asbestos Previous to Carding and Spinning. (Johns-Manville Co.) and harsh. If a soft-fibered variety of asbestos is subjected to a high heat, a portion of its combined water will be driven off, and the fiber will then lose its flexibility and spinning qualities. The fibers of chrysotile are to be distinguished from those of horn- blende by the fact that the fiber-bundles of the former are partly decom- posed by hydrochloric acid and completely so by sulfuric acid, whereas 30 ASBESTOS AS A TEXTILE FIBER hornblende (or amphibole) asbestos is not acted upon by either acid. Chrysotile asbestos is also the denser, and is of a white, straw-yellow to brown, or bluish color, depending on the content of iron oxide (which is sometimes as much as 30 percent). The amphibole asbestos is of less density, contains only about 5 percent of chemically combined water, and - on account of its very brittle fiber is not capable of being spun; the color is gray-white to pink. It occurs in commerce chiefly in the powdered form, and is used in the manufacture of heat-insulating materials. Chryso- tile can only withstand a temperature of 300° to 500° C. without loss in strength, but amphibole may be heated to 1000° to 1200° C. without essential alteration. Canadian asbestos is the most valuable as a source for textile purposes, as it yields a curly fiber easily spun into threads. Fig. 19.—Fiberised Asbestos ready for Market. The length of the fiber varies with the thickness of the rock, and this runs from a fraction of an inch up to about 43 inches (see Figs. 18 and 19). Some Italian varieties are said to reach the exceptional length of 5 to 6 ft., but are harsh and brittle. The serpentine asbestos usually occurs in rather narrow veins and yields fibers of but 2 to 3 ins. in length. 3. Grading of Asbestos.—Asbestos fiber is usually graded into three qualities according to the length of staple ; Grade No. 1 is valuable for spinning; while No. 2 and No. 3 are used for making mill-board or insu- lating materials. The different grades of fiber are separated by shaker machines and air: blowers. Asbestos fiber is divided into four distinct groups: (a) Cross fiber, which has the greatest commercial importance, occurs in distinct veins extending from wall to wall of the serpentine rock. The fibers vary in length from a fraction of an inch to about 2 ins. (6) Slip fiber runs parallel GRADING OF ASBESTOS 31 with the fracture planes produced by the crushing and shearing of the rocks. This fiber is not as well adapted as the foregoing to spinning purposes. (c) Mass fiber,as the name suggests, does not occur in fissures, but in masses. The conditions which produce mass fiber are essentially different from those which produce cross and slip fibers, and when mass fiber is found it is rarely that the other forms occur in the same rock. (d) Shear fiber is made up of cross fiber that has been sheared by a subsequent movement of the rocks. ‘These fibers are found lying parallel with the fracture planes, but evidently altered in their direction after formation. The shear fiber is equal in strength, fineness and flexibility to the best cross fiber, and may sometimes be found as long as 6 ins. There can be little doubt that there is a definite relation between the softness of the asbestos fiber and the quantity of water of constitution it contains; 14.38 percent water has been found in very silky fiber, while a harsh, brittle sample gave only 11.7 percent. This will explain the extreme brittleness of the amphibole fiber, some samples of which contain only 5.45 percent water. The effect of high temperatures on very soft fiber also demonstrates this fact. When part of the combined water has been driven off by excessive heat, the fiber loses its flexibility and becomes harsh and brittle; and the variations in strength and silkiness in various deposits of the mineral are best explained by assuming that the water content was originally nearly the same in all cases, and that the movement of associated rocks or the injection of molten rock has furnished sufficient heat to drive off part of the water. The world’s consumption of asbestos (1912) was about 100,000 tons, of which about 75,000 tons came from Canada. In 1918 the production of Canadian asbestos amounted to 143,743 tons, and in 1920 to 174,521 tons. Asbestos produced in the United States in 1918 amounted to only 800 tons. About 50,000 tons of short-fiber asbestos mill-board and paper are used each year in building construction. It was formerly claimed that Canadian asbestos was inferior to that from Italy, and that it was also a different species of mineral. This, however, has long been proved to be erroneous, and the identity of the two may be seen by reference to their chemical analysis. Up to about 1875, nearly all the commercial asbestos came from Italy, but the cost of producing it, due to the local difficulties in mining, made it too costly for general use; a considerable quantity, however, still comes on the mar- ket from this source. The Italian asbestos is mostly amphibole and is not as valuable as the chrysotile variety. The Canadian supplies are derived from quarries in the neighborhood of Quebec. The deposits occur in a narrow zone of serpentine rocks extending from about 40 miles south of Quebec to a point within the United States. Asbestos also occurs in many other parts of the world, though not of the proper quality 32 ASBESTOS AS A TEXTILE FIBER to make it commercially useful. It is found in the vicinity of Port Bag, Newfoundland, but the locality so far is very inaccessible. It also occurs in various parts of the United States, in Russia, Siberia, F inland, Cyprus, Queensland, South Australia, New South Wales, New Zealand, Rhodesia and China. A _lavender-blue variety which is obtained from South Africa is said to possess great strength and may in time compete with the Canadian variety. A rather recent im- portant field of asbestos is in western Spitzbergen. It is being quite exten- sively operated and yields a highly fibrous, pure amphibole asbestos. 4. Asbestos Yarns and Fabrics.— In general the fibers of asbestos are straight and glassy in structure and are difficult to spin into a coherent thread. In order to enhance its spin- ning qualities it is mixed with a little cotton or linen, the latter fiber being subsequently destroyed by heating the woven fabric to incandescence. By improved methods of handling, however, it is now possible to spin asbestos directly without admixture with cotton. The ‘asbestos rock igs first run through a crusher where it is fiberised (see Figs. 20 and 21). By the use of special machinery it is then separated into long and short fiber; the latter is utilised for the manufacture of mill-board and asbestos paper, while the former is further processed by carding and spinning to make a twist- ed yarn. The numbering of asbestos yarn is based on the number of lengths of 100 yds. that weigh 1 lb.; thus No. 2 yarn indicates that 200 yards weigh 1 lb. As single yarns lack uniformity, all asbestos yarns come into the market as ply yarns, up to 6 or 8 threads. Summers states that asbestos yarn can be spun to weigh less than an ounce to a length of 100 yds. and fine asbestos cloth can be made weighing only a few ounces to the square yard. Such fabrics, however, are curiosities rather than commercial articles. The asbestos yarns and fabrics appearing on the market would Fig. 20.—Rotary Crusher for Asbestos. (Butterworth & Lowe.) 9 ASBESTOS YARNS AND FABRICS 33 be classed as crude and coarse in quality as compared with ordinary tex- tile fabrics. For special purposes a fine brass wire is sometimes twisted with the yarn. At the present time quite a variety of fabrics are manufactured from asbestos fiber, and the high quality of many articles appearing on the market shows that the art of manipulating this substance has reached a high degree of perfection. On account of its incombustible nature, and as it is a very poor conductor of heat, it is made into fabrics in which these qualities are especially desired. Thus it is frequently manufactured into gloves and aprons, packing for steam-cylinders, theatrical curtains and scenery, lamp wicks, etc. The use of asbestos in lamp wicks was Fig. 21—Cyclone Fiberiser for Asbestos. (Laurie) known to the ancients, who employed it for the wicks of the perpetual lamps in their temples, and it was also used as a shroud for the cremation of the kings. It is from this fact, indeed, that it received its name, the word “‘asbestos” meaning ‘‘unconsumed.”’ In later times it was known as “salamander wool,” being known by this term in China, where it was used as early as 1600 for the weaving of napkins. It was also said to be employed for napkins on account of being readily cleansed, it only being necessary to heat the fabric in a flame to make it clean again. This statement, however, is without doubt mythical, together with a similar one regarding the asbestos table cloth of Charlemagne. In this connection it may be noted that there is considerable misconception as to the effect of high temperature on asbestos. It is true that asbestos is infusible except at very high temperatures, and also that it is perfectly non-com- bustible and non-inflammable; nevertheless, it requires only a moderate 34 ASBESTOS AS A TEXTILE FIBER degree of heat (dull redness, for example, in a crucible), to entirely destroy the flexibility of the fiber and to render it so brittle that it may be easily crumbled to a powder. This is due to the fact that the heat drives off the water of hydration from the asbestos, and in this state the fibrous structure easily breaks down. At the present time one of the principal uses of asbestos yarns is in the manufacture of cloth for: the lining of brake bands for automobiles. Asbestos cloth is also used quite extensively in a number of chemical operations, especially for the filtering of acids or other corrosive liquids. In some cases asbestos is spun directly around a copper wire for pur- poses of insulation. Asbestos, in general, is not dyed, and do"
