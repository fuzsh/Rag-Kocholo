        "text": "Amman - A report prepared by the Arab Archives Institute in Jordan found an estimated 72 Arab journalists killed between 2001 and 2006 for reasons directly related to their work. Twelve of the dead were women. This means that at least one journalist was killed every month in an Arab country in the last six years.\n\nIraq is clearly the most dangerous country in which to work, but North Africa has also claimed more than its share of victims.\n\nThe high number of Arab journalists killed in six years overshadowed their accomplishments and their legacies, according to the AAI report, which was carried out in cooperation with the IFEX network and UNESCO. The main motive behind the killing of these journalists was intimidation.\n\nThe report serves as a reminder to activists around the world of the highly dangerous circumstances in which Arab journalists are working, not only in Iraq, but also in other places where enemies of freedom find words too much to be tolerated.\n\nIraq is the country where journalists are most prone to being attacked, but journalists from other Arab countries are also harassed, tortured and killed for their beliefs and for expressing them.\n\nAlgeria: Abdel Hai Bilyardoh, Murad Belqasem (43), Hamid l'reibi Fadila Nejma, Adel Zerrouk\n\nJordan: Riham Farra (29), Tareq Ayyoub (34)\n\nSudan: Mohammad Taha (50)\n\nKuwait: Hidaya Salem (65)\n\nPalestine: Mazen Da'na (38), Nazeeh Darwazeh (44), Khalil Ziben (59), Zakaria Ahmad (45), Imad Abu Zahra (28), Amjad Allami (20), Othman Qatnani, Issam Tillawi (30), Mohammad Bishawi (27)\n\nLebanon: Jubran Tweini (48), Samir Kassir (45), Layal Najeeb (23)\n\nLibya: Deif Al Ghazal (29)"
