        "text": "The study aims at identifying the nature of the Palestinian press discourse, defining its attributes, actors, reference frameworks and arguments. It also tries to find out the similarities and differences between the two selected newspapers in this study, Al-Hayat Al-Jadida (The New Life) and Palestine. This descriptive study uses several methods including discourse analysis, comparative interrelationship as well as the use of frame analysis theory. Data collection involves using discourse analysis and content analysis tools. The researchers choose samples from Al-Hayat Al-Jadida and Palestine, and their issues are collected in systematic random sampling according to the artificial week approach over a year started from 1/1/2012 to 31/12/2012. The study concludes that the thesis of \"Prisons' Hunger Strike\" in Al-Hayat Al-Jadida and \"The Torture of Israeli Occupation against Prisoners\", in Palestine have received the highest percentage of discussion among other theses that tackled civil and political human rights issues. There is a convergence between the study papers in the use of arguments. Discourse producers in Palestine newspaper depended on \"Legal Reference\" and \"Historical Reference\" as the most prominent references.\n\nThe complex relations between the Palestinians and Israel and the Fatah-Hamas conflict have created a varied media discourse in the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip. This paper aims to show the origins, the characteristics and the consequences of the contemporary Palestinian media discourse in light of the developments in the Palestinian arena in recent years. The study shows how various Palestinian factions use the media discourse, in wartime and peace, and include common terms in the Palestinian media discourse.\n\nThis study explores the use of social media platforms by Palestinian journalists covering events in Jerusalem within the context of the asymmetrical conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. Our findings, based on data gathered from 10 in-depth interviews, reveal that social media platforms allow journalists to construct an autonomous space for sharing witnesses&#39; accounts while enabling them to partially avoid restrictions on reporting stemming from conditions of the asymmetrical conflict. The interviewees perceive social media platforms as a potential gateway for spreading alternative narratives to both local and international news arenas, however, our findings suggest that authorities in power still manage to impose restrictions on journalists that mirror the reporting restrictions that existed prior to the advent of social media.\n\nThis study sheds light on the unprecedented complexities of the Israel-Gaza war, offering insights into the challenges that journalists face in this conflict zone. It employs the Hierarchy of Influences Model to analyze the factors influencing conflict reporting within the dynamic landscape of contemporary war journalism. Design/methodology/approach: Rooted in the Hierarchy of Influences Model, the research is informed by interviews with 18 Palestinian journalists in Gaza. It examines the multifaceted influences on war coverage, encompassing individual, media routines, organizational, and societal factors, offering detailed insights from journalists' firsthand experiences. Findings: The research unveils semi-hierarchical influences within the model, illustrating the intertwined nature of micro and macro-level factors impacting war reporting. It sheds light on the complexities of journalistic practices amidst conflicts, underscoring the importance of safety, ethics, and the intricate relationship between personal experiences and professional duties as well as the evolving role of technology, acting both as a facilitator and a limitation in journalistic endeavors. Practical implications: The study holds substantial implications for war journalism practices, providing valuable perspectives for educators, policymakers, stakeholders, and media practitioners engaged in conflict reporting. It highlights the Article Note: This article underwent double-blind peer review."
