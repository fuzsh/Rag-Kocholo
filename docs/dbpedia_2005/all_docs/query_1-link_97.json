(Read photo caption)\n\nThe occupation army also arrested dozens of people in a major sweep for Resistance activists across the West Bank, including more than 50 men taken from the city of Jenin in a bus, Palestinian witnesses said.\n\nPalestinian security sources said Israeli occupation troops entered the town of Deir al-Balah in central Gaza and fired at a police station, killing policeman Khaled al-Khatib. Muain al-A'daini, 13, was shot dead as the troops withdrew, they said.\n\nHospital officials in Jenin said Imad Abu Zahra, 35, a Palestinian freelance reporter, died in hospital after he was shot on Thursday as the occupation army reimposed a curfew without warning.\n\nThey said he lost a lot of blood and fell into a coma before reaching hospital. A Palestinian press photographer was also wounded but survived.\n\nTensions remained high in the West Bank, where Israeli forces have reoccupied seven of the eight Palestinian-ruled cities.\n\nPalestinian witnesses said the occupation army carried out new raids on Palestinian-ruled cities and villages. The army confirmed 15 arrests but Palestinian witnesses put the figures much higher.\n\nResidents of Jenin, which Israel calls a hotbed of Resistance, said occupation soldiers called men aged 15 to 50 to the center of the city and then took more than 50 away in a bus.\n\nIt was not known where they were taken.\n\nAt least 1,442 Palestinians and 549 Israelis have been killed since the Palestinians rose up against Israeli occupation in the Gaza Strip and West Bank in September 2000 after peace talks on statehood froze.\n\nNabil Abu Rdeinah, an aide to Palestinian President Yasser Arafat, condemned the killings in Gaza. He said the bloodshed and continued Israeli occupation were a \"serious challenge\" to a meeting of major powers on the Middle East conflict next week.\n\nARAB FOREIGN MINISTERS MEET IN CAIRO TO COORDINATE POSITIONS\n\nRepresentatives of the United States, the United Nations, the European Union and Russia will meet on Tuesday in New York.\n\nA U.S. official said the foreign ministers of Jordan, Egypt and possibly Saudi Arabia could meet the group on Monday.\n\nArab foreign ministers met in Cairo on Friday to discuss President Bush's vision of a Palestinian state, after Palestinian leaders change, they end violence and reform.\n\nHis vision was greeted coolly by most Arab leaders.\n\nARAFAT SAYS HE WON'T STEP ASIDE\n\nPalestinian leader Yasser Arafat meanwhile vowed Friday to resist international pressure to step down but at the same time said he had made no decision on seeking re-election in January.\n\n\"It is not only up to me. It will be up to many people,\" Arafat said in an interview with The Associated Press and Bahrain television at his Ramallah compound. He has been periodically confined to the compound for months, ringed by Israeli tanks and soldiers.\n\nIn remarks that left room for interpretation in both directions, Arafat also said it would be cowardly to step down.\n\nPHOTO CAPTION\n\n(Top Left) Hospital workers prepare the bodies of Palestinians for their funeral in Deir al-Balah near Gaza city, July 12, 2002.
