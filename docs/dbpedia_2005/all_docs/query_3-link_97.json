        "text": "JERUSALEM - Human rights watchdog Amnesty International has condemned Palestinian suicide attacks against Israeli civilians as crimes against humanity and demanded they end immediately.\n\n\"We urge the Palestinian Authority to arrest and bring to justice those who order, plan or carry out attacks on civilians,\" Amnesty said in a hard-hitting report.\n\nThe criticism of the Palestinians was unusual from a group that has often faulted Israel over its use of force to try to quell the 21-month-old Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.\n\nYet Israel still found itself under fire. The United States rebuked it over a raid this week in which police closed the office of moderate Palestinian official Sari Nusseibeh, adding its voice to the criticism of some leftist government ministers.\n\nIsrael signalled its own determination to deter Palestinian militants by saying it would take the unusual step of giving jailed Palestinian leader Marwan Barghouthi a public trial in a civilian court on allegations of orchestrating attacks.\n\nPalestinians charged with involvement in attacks against Israelis are usually tried in military courts. Giving Barghouthi a civilian trial will raise publicity for the case against the general secretary of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement in the West Bank.\n\nAmnesty took aim at Palestinian militants in its seventh report on the human rights situation since the September 2000 eruption of the Palestinian uprising for an independent state.\n\nIt said the Palestinian attacks on civilians violated \"fundamental principles of humanity which are reflected in international humanitarian law. In the manner in which they are being committed ... they also amount to crimes against humanity\".\n\nMahmoud al-Zahar, a senior leader of the Islamic militant group Hamas, said it rejected Amnesty's appeal.\n\n\"We reiterated our right to self-defence. This is not a war between two Armies and should not be viewed as such,\" he said. \"The communique ... deliberately ignores the legitimate motives of our struggle.\"\n\nIn the West Bank town of Jenin, Israeli troops shot and wounded two Palestinian press photographers yesterday after reimposing a curfew without warning, witnesses said.\n\nThe Army said its troops fired after coming under attack.\n\nSaid Dahla and Imad Abu Zahra, both of the Palestinian news agency WAFA, went out to work in the afternoon after the Army said its more than three-week-long curfew in Jenin had been lifted until evening, the witnesses said.\n\nBut Israeli armoured columns rolled into town from two directions without warning, they said, and troops shot the two men in the legs.\n\nAn Army spokesman said there was shooting after two of its armoured vehicles were disabled after hitting an electricity pole, drawing a crowd of angry, armed Palestinians.\n\n\"The mob threw stones and firebombs at the vehicles, and then gunmen opened fire at them as well,\" the spokesman said. \"Our troops had no choice but to return fire.\"\n\nFrom Jerusalem it was reported that a group of Los Angeles Jews has offered to train and provide sniffer dogs to Israel to help find Palestinian suicide bombers and attack them before they kill.\n\nThe group, which calls the project \"Pups for Peace\", has offered to buy the dogs and set up a school in the Golan Heights to train them and their Israeli handlers, said Public Security Minister Uzi Landau.\n\n- REUTERS\n\nFeature: Middle East\n\nRelated links"
