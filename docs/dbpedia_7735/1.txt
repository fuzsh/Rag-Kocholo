Self-Hosting is the practice of locally hosting(on premises & private web servers) and managing software applications by a person or organization instead of monthly subscriptions from Software as a service (SaaS) providers.

Most self-hosted software can be installed using Docker, a packaging system which allows software to bundle their configuration and dependencies and isolate them from your operating system. Software using docker can be installed using the command line or via graphical interfaces such as Portainer. Software is installed with Docker by downloading an image file containing the application, then creating a copy that sets up its own dependencies and configuration within what is called a container. Without containers you would often need to install different versions of the same programming languages or tools to satisfy the dependencies for the software you want to use which can get complicated.

Build locally with Docker:

1. Clone Project Repo

git clone https://github.com/mckaywrigley/chatbot-ui.git

2. Install Dependencies

npm i

3. Provide OpenAI API Key

Create a .env.local file in the root of the repo with your OpenAI API Key:

OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY

You can set OPENAI_API_HOST where access to the official OpenAI host is restricted or unavailable, allowing users to configure an alternative host for their specific needs.

Launching Demo Locally

Try out the demo demo.py on your local machine by running

python demo.py --cfg-path eval_configs/minigpt4_eval.yaml --gpu-id 0

Here, the demo loads Vicuna as 8 bit by default to save some GPU memory usage. Besides, the default beam search width is 1. Under this setting, the demo cost about 23G GPU memory. If you have a more powerful GPU with larger GPU memory, you can run the model in 16 bit by setting low_resource to False in the config file minigpt4_eval.yaml and use a larger beam search width.

It's one of the fastest object storage platforms globally, with a read/write speed of 183GB/s-171GB/s if you use standard hardware. It can function as the main storage tier for many workloads like Spark, TensorFlow, Presto, Hadoop HDFS, and H2O.

MinIO UI

Run the following command to run the latest stable image of MinIO as a container using an ephemeral data volume:

If you're using an SSD mounted at /mnt/sdd, then we can run the following to use it instead:

Architecture URL 64-bit Intel/AMD https://dl.min.io/server/minio/release/linux-amd64/minio 64-bit ARM https://dl.min.io/server/minio/release/linux-arm64/minio 64-bit PowerPC LE (ppc64le) https://dl.min.io/server/minio/release/linux-ppc64le/minio IBM Z-Series (S390X) https://dl.min.io/server/minio/release/linux-s390x/minio

To run MinIO on 64-bit Windows hosts, download the MinIO executable from the following URL:

https://dl.min.io/server/minio/release/windows-amd64/minio.exe

Use the following command to run a standalone MinIO server on the Windows host. Replace D:\ with the path to the drive or directory in which you want MinIO to store data. You must change the terminal or powershell directory to the location of the minio.exe executable, or add the path to that directory to the system $PATH:

minio.exe server D:\

Use the following commands to compile and run a standalone MinIO server from source. Source installation is only intended for developers and advanced users. If you do not have a working Golang environment, please follow How to install Golang. The minimum version required is go1.19.

go install github.com/minio/minio@latest

After you install MinIO:

The MinIO deployment starts using default root credentials minioadmin:minioadmin. You can test the deployment using the MinIO Console, an embedded web-based object browser built into MinIO Server. Point a web browser running on the host machine to http://127.0.0.1:9000 and log in with the root credentials. You can use the Browser to create buckets, upload objects, and browse the contents of the MinIO server.

When you run Minio you will be issued a key and a secret. These are used by the client or the web front-end to connect securely. I found my codes by typing in docker logs minio.

If you'd like to learn more then most of the Minio client commands support a help flag or give info on the command line:

You can have your client point to multiple Minio servers, which is really neat especially if you're working on a distributed team.

Minio's test-server called "play" is already configured in the default client, you can see all the servers you have configured with mc config host list.

To upload the photo to Minio's "play" S3 server just type in:

# mc mb play/somebucketname

# mc cp ~/Downloads/IMG_2016120-25.jpg play/somebucketname

Recursive uploads:

If you want to test something larger out you could try uploading your entire Downloads photo, and then you should use the --recursive flag to make sure nothing's missed:

# mc cp --recursive ~/Downloads/IMG_2016120-25.jpg myminio/photos
