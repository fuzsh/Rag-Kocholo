        "text": "The use of virtual reality games, known as “exergaming”, is gaining more and more interest as a mobilization tool and as a key piece in the delivery of quality health, especially in elderly people. Mobility tracking of elderly people facilitates the extraction of useful spatiotemporal characteristics regarding their activities and behavior at home. Currently, the analysis of human mobility is based on expensive technologies. In this paper, we propose a semantic interoperability agent which exploits mobility tracking and spatiotemporal characteristics to extract human profiling and give incentives for mobilization at home. The agent exploits an extended ontology which facilitates the collation of evidence for the effects of exergaming on the movement control of older adults. In order to provide personalized monitoring services, a number of rules are individually defined to generate incentives. To evaluate the proposed semantic interoperability agent, human mobility data are collected...\n\nThe international tourism competition poses new challenges to the cruise sector, such as the achievement of the tourists’ satisfaction and the increase in on board comfort. Moreover, the growing sophistication of tourists’ needs leads to a more user-centric touristic offer. Consequently, a personalized cabin environment, which fits the users’ activities and their characteristics, could be a plus value during the cruise vacation. These topics, however, are strictly connected with the diffusion of digital technologies and dynamics, which represent the tools to achieve the goal of a customized on-cruise experience. This paper presents E-Cabin, a novel Internet of Things (IoT) framework architecture that has at its core a reasoning system tuned on data gathered from the environment and from each specific passenger and the activities he/she performs. The framework leverages on knowledge representation with ontologies and consists of a publisher–subscriber communication framework that all...\n\nMost of the countries with elderly populations are currently facing with chronic diseases. In this regard, Internet of Things (IoT) technology offers promising tools for reducing the chronic disease burdens. Despite the presence of fruitful works on the use of IoT for chronic disease management in literature, these are rarely overviewed consistently. The present study provides an overview on the use of IoT for chronic disease management, followed by ranking different chronic diseases based on their priority for using IoT in the developing countries. For this purpose, a structural coding was used to provide a list of technologies adopted so far, and then latent Dirichlet allocation algorithm was applied to find major topics in literature. In order to rank chronic diseases based on their priority for using IoT, a list of common categories of chronic diseases was subjected to fuzzy analytic hierarchy process. The research findings include lists of IoT technologies for chronic disease m..."
