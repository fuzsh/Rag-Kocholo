        "text": "Dec 01 » Network Clients » VPPPN\n\nVPPPN stands for virtual peer to peer private networking, the project provides a VPN client using a custom protocol to be able to setup up a point to point dynamic virtual network. This differes from openvpn in that it does not need a central server to pass the network's traffic. A central server exists to allocate IP addresses and provide a point of contact for the clients but once connections are established these services are no longer needed. This means that a VPPN network is free (as in beer) since to set up a network you do not need to invest in an always on Internet server. The project is open source and GPL (free as in speach) and runs on Linux and Windows XP, support for other operating systems is planned. Once established a VPPPN network behaves in a similar way to a normal IP network. To the end user this means you can setup an office network and drag and drop files between computers in a secure manner over the internet.\n\nGo To VPPPN\n\nJul 12 » General Purpose » ZXing\n\nZXing (pronounced \\\"zebra crossing\\\") is an open-source, multi-format 1D/2D barcode image processing library implemented in Java, with ports to other languages.

This is done by splitting an application into smaller parts that can be executed simultaneously on different machines. How it works There are 2 aspects to this: Dividing an application into smaller parts that can be executed independently and in parallel. JPPF provides facilities that make this effort a lot easier, faster and much less painful than without them. The result is a JPPF object called a \\\"job\\\", itself made of smaller independent parts called \\\"tasks\\\". A JPPF Grid is made of a server, to which any number of execution nodes are attached. A node is a JPPF software component that is generally installed and running on a separate machine. This is commonly called a master/slave architecture, where the work is distributed by the server (aka \\\"master\\\") to the nodes (aka \\\"slaves\\\"). In JPPF terms, a unit of work is called a \\\"job\\\", and its constituting \\\"tasks\\\" are distributed by the server among the nodes for parallel execution.\n\nGo To JPPF\n\nJul 12 » Geospatial » Gisgraphy\n\nGisgraphy is a free, open source framework that offers the possibility to do geolocalisation and geocoding via Java APIs or REST webservices.

It is similar in spirit to JUnit in that if factors out most of the repetitive programming logic that is necessary to write micro-benchmarks. This logic includes loading and initializing multiple drivers, warming up the VM, forking multiple threads, timing the inner loop, etc. One of the key design goals for Japex was extensibility.

GUI objects described in the scripts are identified and located directly at runtime during the test scripts execution. Avoiding GUI Maps testers have the possibility of starting automation early in the software lifecycle, long before the application is released for testing. GUI objects identification is performed by an intelligent Finder powered by a highly configurable set of searching algorithms. Maveryx supports also approximate matching to identify the GUI objects even in case of few or partial information given in the test scripts (this is typical when deriving test scripts from lacking or partial applications specifications or in testing non-mature/early software). Maveryx is OS independent and works with the most used free and commercial IDE such as Eclipse, NetBeans, JUnit, IBM Rational Functional Tester, etc.\n\nGo To Maveryx\n\nApr 08 » Crawlers » Ex-Crawler\n\nEx-Crawler is divided into three subprojects.
