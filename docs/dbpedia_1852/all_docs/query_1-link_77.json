I had an interesting exchange over text message yesterday. With all of the recent news and stories showcasing the challenges in community pharmacy, I reached to a few colleagues I go waaaaaay back with. One in particular mentioned they had lost 7 techs in the last few months. There is an important concept to understand here. It requires some self reflection and can be a bitter pill to swallow. People don't leave companies. People leave leaders. Yes, there are some downright terrible companies out there. But there are also a lot of people who work for bad companies. What keeps them there? Their leader does. Perhaps you have encountered a scenario where support staff will not work with certain pharmacists. \"If <pharmacist A> is going to be here tomorrow, I am not.\" I have heard countless stories along these lines. People don't leave companies, they leave leaders. It is one thing to see this with someone else, it is a completely other thing to see this in yourself. It hurts. It hurts deeply. Things are burning down around you, and now you have even less help. When I first started scheduling pharmacists, it took less than 72 hours for the first pharmacist to give his notice. At the time, I was naive enough to think it was just the ways things were. And sometimes it is. Sometimes a family must move or sometimes a new addition to the family creates a situation that requires more flexibility. I have learned to never fault someone for making choices that brings a better situation for their family. But I have also learned to become a better leader. I had a very small clinical team and we were doing big things. We were training thousands of pharmacists for various activities and making good progress. Then I got a call. A member of my team was giving notice. Up to that point, I thought I was a good leader. I probably arrogantly thought I was an above average leader. Reflecting on how I handled my team member's departure, I can now see how horrible of a leader I was. People don't leave companies, they leave leaders. With all of the challenges that pharmacy faces, the impact of poor leadership may be the most detrimental. It undermines the impact you and your team can have. It impacts the care and service you provide your patients. What have you done and what are you doing to improve your leadership skills? #forpharmacy #forpharmacists #pharmacists #pharmacyleadership #leadwell #KeepPharmacistsImproving #AmericanPharmacistsMonth #EveryoneDeservesToBeLedWell\n\nWe were working with the founder of a Series A digital healthcare company focused on #valuebasedcare. After securing funding, their initial plan was to recruit several mid-market account executives to aggressively sell their platform to physicians' offices and clinics. However, this strategy often falls short. It's a familiar scenario: Secure funding, assemble a team of mid-level AEs, and hope they'll navigate the market successfully. Here's the issue: In digital healthcare, commercial leadership is paramount. You can't simply wing it when discussing value-based care and healthcare trends with doctors. You can be the smoothest talking sales person on the planet but you can't bs your way through a VBC conversation, insurances, risk models etc. You need someone who's taken a product like this to market. None of the founders possessed true commercial leadership skills. While they managed to sell the platform to large clinics through their connections from their ivy league universities, they lacked a seasoned sales leader. Selling to independent medical practices is HAAARD, ask anyone that's ever worked at Zocdoc.. What's needed is a leader who can craft effective messaging, develop a solid go-to-market (GTM) strategy, and can identify what works before expanding the team with less experienced AEs. That's why they called us and within 4 weeks, they had their CRO. Whether you're a sales leader looking to explore what's next or you need to ramp up your organization, we're here.\n\n#hiring Center Operations Director, Los Angeles, United States, fulltime #jobs #jobseekers #careers #LosAngelesjobs #Californiajobs Apply: https://lnkd.in/eMhcj6QN Overview: Please be advised, if you are viewing this position on Indeed, that the salary rate/range set forth herein was provided by Indeed.
