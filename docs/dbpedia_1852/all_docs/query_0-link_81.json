That would assure that any regulatory steps in this area would be taken as part of an integrated effort to respond to the broad concerns being expressed by both Houses of Congress with regard to forbearance-related issues, including those associated with a closer alignment of regulatory accounting procedures with GAAP.

N.W Washtngton, D.C. 20552 Federal Home Loan Bank Board F•deral Home Loan Bank Systern Federal Hom• Loan Mortgage Corporation Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation EDWIN J. GRAY CHAJRMAN March 9, 1987 The Honorable Fernand J. St Germain Chairman, Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs United States House of Representatives Dear Chairman St Germain: The following seeks to lay before you, in as plain-spoken a manner as possible, the current condition of the FSLIC and my views about our situation. The General Accounting Office (\"GAO\"), the auditor designated by you in the Congress to audit the books of the FSLIC, has determined that the insurance fund was insolvent at the end of 1986 by over $3 billion, using generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). On that basis, the. FSLIC is even more insolvent today. Within the next month or so, based on anticipated expenses, the fund may he insolvent by over $4 billion, on a GAAP basis. The FSLIC's liquidity has been significantly reduced. We currently have approximately $3.7 billion in cash and investment securities. Within a month or so, that liquidity mav well be much closer to $2 billion, based on anticipated expenses. As you know, deposits at FSLIC-insured institutions exceed $9no billion. One area of concern is the impact of GAO's opinion on the secondary reserves. The secondary reserves of the FSLIC fund are currently counted as assets by insured institutions that have provided such reserves. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the accounting profession are likely to require that these reserves be written off because of FSLIC's insolvency. The overall impact would be an $817.4 million reduction in the industry's net worth. Individual impacts include four institutions that would become insolvent and twenty-four additional institutions that https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis 4 2 would fail their minimum net worth requirements because of the write-off of their secondary reserves. One institution alone would see its net worth fall by S48 million. FSLIC-guaranteed advances will pose troubling issues for the boards of directors and auditors of the Federal Home Loan Banks (\"FHLBanks\"). As of February 20, 1987, the FHLBanks had total outstanding advances of $3,499,872,000 to 83 institutions. These advances are guaranteed by the FSLIC. The FHLBanks have advanced an additional $2,447,477,000 to these same institutions without FSLIC guarantees. This leads to a grand total of outstanding advances to these 83 institutions of $5,947,349,000. Of these advances, the overall collateral deficiency is slightly over billion. One FHLBank has a collateral deficiency of $795,650,000 -- a Si very large percentage of its capital. Much of the collateral is of unknown quality. This FHLBank, therefore, is depending on the FSLIC guarantee as its only realistic source of prampt, full repayment of advances. There can be no assurance that the boards of directors of the FHLBanks, in the exercise of their fiduciary duties to their shareholders, will be willing to make uncollateralized advances to troubled thrifts on the strength of a guarantee of an insolvent FSLIC fund. Scale of the FHLBanks in particular would face a major dilemma. If they made further advances, and if the FSLIC were unable to honor its guarantees, the solvency of the entire bank would be at risk. If the FHLBank did not make advances, it might be unable to stem a liquidity crisis. The accountants who audit FHLBank financial statements will face the issue of whether uncollateralized advances require establishment of loss reserves. If loss reserves were required, the capital of the affected banks would fall, and the net worth of insured institutions that are members of such banks would also be reduced. The total potential writeoff would be slightly over Si billion. An immediate problem may also arise with respect to FSLIC's notes. FSLIC has approximately S4.5 billion in notes outstanding payable to troubled thrifts and de novo federal mutual associations chartered as part of asset backed transfers. Once again, accountants will face the question of whether the notes of an insolvent corporation (FSLIC) can continue to be treated as assets by these associations or whether substantial loss reserves are required. Any write-off required could force some already troubled thrifts into insolvency. Write-offs could also cause a crisis of confidence in other thrifts holding FSLIC notes. I am also concerned about the potential impact of FSLIC's growing CAP insolvency on public confidence. We have been fortunate thus far. https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis 3 Net operating losses (this does not include any losses from write-downs) at institutions in our significant supervisory caseload are running at over $6 million a day, more than S2 billion a year. That number is greater than FSLIC's entire annual operating income. FSLIC will have to pay these net operating losses. Due to the weakness of the FSLIC fund, thrifts have to pay higher interest rates to attract depositors than paid by their FDIC insured competitors. Industry wide, this extra cost to FSLIC insured institutions is at least S4 billion per year. FSLIC's GAAP insolvency is likely to increase that cost. Every day of delay raises the present value cost to the FSLIC -- and to the thrift industry. As I mentioned, the FSLIC will soon be down to near $2 billion in liquidity ($5 billion GAAP insolvent) to protect an industry with approximately Si trillion in liabilities. This is untenable. Moreover, there are severe constraints on FSLIC's ability to draw upon other sources of liquidity. FSLIC receiverships hold approximately $7.1 billion in assets. Approximately 50% of these assets are located in Texas. FSLIC is by far the largest creditor of such receiverships. Receivership assets, however, are extremely illiquid. Any effort to improve FSLIC's liquidity through accelerated liquidation of receivership assets would lead to charges that FSLIC was \"dumping\" assets. I do not believe selling off such assets at \"fire sale\" prices -- even for the sake of liquidity -- makes any sense at all; rather, it could only exacerbate the present situation. FSLIC could improve its liquidity by seeking to use its claim against receivership assets as collateral for loans for Federal Reserve advances to insured institutions. Such arrangements, however, could not be made without substantial delay. In addition, we do not know how much \"over collateralization\" would be required by the Federal Reserve, or to what extent it would lend. In other words, the Federal Reserve may advance only Si for every S2 of receivership assets -- or less -- given the poor quality of receivership assets. A very large percentage of the best receivership assets are already pledged as collateral for prior loans. 12 U.S.C. Section 1727(i) provides that the Rank Board may require insured thrifts to deposit with the FSLIC not more than one percent of all deposits in insured institutions. This would produce approximately S8.9 billion in liquid funds. The legislative history of this statute indicates that these funds can be used solely for liquidity purposes -not for resolving cases. Also, the Board can use these deposits only for the purpose of its own liquidity; whether the Board can legally use the deposits to stop a run on an insured institution is unclear at best. By statute, the FSLIC can obtain $750 million in advances from the Treasury. Some members of Congress have questioned whether Treasury must obtain an appropriation before it makes such advances to the FSLIC. We have requested a ruling from the Attorney General. https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis 4 The FSLIC is authorized to make loans or contributions to any insured institution to prevent its default or to lessen the risk to the insurance fund. In other words, for FSLIC to provide financial assistance to an institution, the Bank Board must be able to find that the cost of providing such aid to the institution would be less than the cost of liquidation (12 U.S.C. Section 1729 (f)(4)(A)). This could be a very difficult finding for the Bank Board to make for the very institutions most vulnerable to severe liquidity pressures. Therefore, even if the FSLIC had adequate sources of liquidity, it could not necessarily use them. FSLIC must have the capability to resolve problems. This requires that the FSLIC maintain funds sufficient to resolve problems, not simply liquidity. The FSLIC could not call on enough liquidity to resolve problems resulting from any material loss of public confidence. Temporary closures proved necessary in both Ohio and Maryland. Any systemic Loss of public confidence in FSLIC insured institutions could also spread to individual FDIC insured problem institutions. After the collapse of Ohio and Maryland insurance funds, legislators of both states complained bitterly that state regulators had not alerted them to the problems of those funds in advance so that the legislatures could avert the crisis. There was criticism that the regulators had misled the legislatures through repeated assertions that the Ohio and Maryland insurance funds were strong and improving. I have been consistently candid with Congress about the problems besetting the FSLIC and the urgent need to recapitalize the fund. For this, I have been criticized by many in the industry. Your own GAO auditors also have been strongly criticized because of their candid reports to the Congress. (See Exhibit 1 to this letter.) Some claim there would not be a problem if the GAD and I were to simply stop talking about it -- as though, by not addressing it, the problem would go away. I have never sought to hide the facts from, or to mislead, the Congress. Nor do I intend to do so now. The FSLIC recapitalization plan we have proposed asks very little from Congress. No appropriation of public funds is requested. No public funds are borrowed. No federal guaranty is requested. It is not a government bailout. Nor is any increase in premium authority requested. Indeed, the plan we have proposed will permit FSLIC to reduce existing insurance premiums by phasing out the special assessment. No adverse budgetary impact is involved. GAO and investment bankers have determined that this plan is viable, and thet it is the cheapest way to raise the necessary funds. We need your approval to put our recapitalization plan into operation. In the meantime, I would request that this Congress consider readopting its full \"faith and credit\" resolution of March, 1982. We https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis 5 also need a Congressional directive to operate the FSLIC fund and resolve problem thrift cases despite the GAAP insolvency of the fund. Immediate action on all these measures is needed promptly. In recent months, reasons have been advanced for delaying passage of FSLIC recapitalization and for reducing dramatically the funds available to FSLIC under the plan. The first argument is that the FSLIC does Dot need $15 billion to resolve coming losses. Congress' auditors -- your own auditors at GAD -- strongly disagree with that argument. GAD's concern is that FSLIC's losses could ultimately exceed our current estimates. The second argument is a variant of the first. It is argued that our plan to borrow $15 billion could be excessive, and that Congress should not \"lock\" itself into a S15 billion/5-year plan. Putting aside that your own GAD auditors have confirmed that $15 billion is essential, even if the problems facing the FSLIC were to diminish dramatically, the Bank Board/Treasury plan does not lock into place a $15 billion financing. We have made it quite explicit that the markets will not accept, at reasonable interest rates, more than approximately $3 billion a year in bond issuances. Bonds will be issued only to the extent the funds are necessary. Your GAD auditors will review periodically the issue of what funds are necessary. Congress will have ample opportunity and means to ensure that excessive bonds are not issued under the Bank Board/Treasury plan. I have endorsed Senator Gramm's proposed measure that would provide for Congressional hearings and reports within two years of the enactment of our plan to assure that Congress would have a formal means of reexamining the plan. In my own view, which I respectfully offer, the adoption of plans involving lesser recapitalization resources (i.e. $5-7.5 billion) would be tantamount to the adoption of a continuous crisis resolution. No one has demonstrated that such sums are even remotely adequate to meet the full magnitude of the FSLIC's problems. All such plans would leave the FSLIC fund deeply insolvent, using generally accepted accounting principles. An investment banker has already testified before the House Ranking Committee that investors will view such plans as risky, becauc they are clearly inadequate. In addition, they would force investors to rely on the hope that a future Congress would take timely and affirmative action two years from now to pass legislation allowing FSLIC to raise enough funds to recapitalize itself. After more than a year of discussion, Congress has not yet shown its willingness to pass recapitalization legislation, even where it has been conceded by all that we confront a critical problem -- yes, a crisis. The very act of Congress' passing a deficient recapitalization alternative would convince investors of the added seriousness of the risk two years hence. In my view, investors will surely demand higher interest rates under alternative plans involving lesser recapitalization resources. This https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis 6 higher interest expense would be wasteful. It would harm the FSLIC (in the form of lower net proceeds from the financing corporation) and the cost would be borne eventually by the thrifts, and ultimately by the taxpayers. The third argument advanced to delay passage of the Bank Board/ Treasury plan has been forbearance for economically distressed areas. I have attached as Exhibits 2,3, & 4 the press release, policy statement and appraisal clarification that we have issued in response to these requests for forbearance. The pressure f^r a formal Rank Board forbearance policy statement frankly began with a myth. The claim was that the Comptroller of the Currency followed a liberal forbearance policy while the Bank Board mechanically insisted on strict cumpliance with its capital requirements. I was asked by members of Congress to adopt a capital forbearance policy essentially identical to that the Comptroller issued. I reexamined the Comptroller's statement and determined that was simply not appropriate. It was inappropriate because no thrift in Texas would have qualified for forbearance under the Comptroller's policy. This is because the weakest bank qualifying for forbearance would have capital in excess of our normal capital requirements. Exhibit 5 presents data demonstrating the problem. Exhibit 5 also belies the myth that the Bank Board has not been following a policy of forbearance. The commercial banking regulators do not permit banks to operate with negative primary capital. As a general rule, bank regulators take action to merge or remove FDIC insurance of accounts to a bank with 3% or less primary capital. Tangible net worth is the closest equivalent to primary capital in the commercial banking system. If we followed the practices of the federal commercial banking regulatory agencies, roughly 106 thrift institutions in Texas (38 percent of the total number of Texas thrifts) would be closed immediately and we would take action such that an additional 66 institutions (24 percent) would be merged out of existence. Exhibit 5 demonstrates that the Rank Board was following and has followed a practice of extraordinary forbearance, well before the current focus on the issue. The Bank Board's policy statement on forbearance is far more liberal than the Comptroller's. First, t-o qualify for the Comptroller's program, a commercial bank must have generally 4 percent primary capital. The analogous threshold under our forbearance policy is 0.5 percent regulatory capital. Thus, our policy is 8 times more liberal on its face. In fact, because -less than one dollar in three of thrift regulatory capital would qualify as primary capital for banks, our policy is really about 24 times as liberal. Our program is also more liberal in defining the other key aspect of eligibility for forbearance. The Comptroller's policy generally restricts eligibility to those banks that have more than 25% of their loans in energy or agricultural sectors. Very few Texas banks have qualified for forbearance. Our policy gives much broader forbearance to thrifts with loans in depressed regions. https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis 7 The third major area of greater regulatory forbearance is noted in our policy statement -- we do not automatically appoint receivers, even for insolvent thrifts. This is contrary to the practice of the commercial banking regulators. At the same time that we adopted our formal capital forbearance policy statement, we also took action on the subject of real estate appraisals. The staff issued clarifications of the existing appraisal standards that addressed the reasonable concerns which had been raised by some in the industry. I announced my intention of bringing a proposal to the Bank Board to request public comment on what appraisal standards the Board should follow. Contemporaneously, I announced my intent to ask the Bank Board to seek public comment on whether the Bank Board should adopt a classification of assets system that is less appraisal-driven and more uniform with the system used by commercial banking regulators. Staff work on both of these proposals is well underway. In short, we have taken, reaffirmed, or committed ourselves to rational devices of forbearance. We have gone well beyond the commercial banking regulators. We have shown very significant forbearance and discretion in dealing with institutions in states with depressed economies. Indeed, other regions of the country could complain vigorously about the degree of forbearance we have shown in some states. Exhibit 6 lists all recent FSLIC takeovers. It is apparent even from a cursory review that there have been disproportionately few FSLIC takeovers in Texas particularly when contrasted to the number of insolvencies in Texas. The contrast to a state such as California is startling. Forbearance means different things to different people. Under the rubric of forbearance a number of actions have been advanced that I oppose. The head of one major industry group has stated that our policy statement is inadequate because we have not allowed the industry to use \"rinky-dink\" accounting, i.e., Loan loss amortization (See Exhibit 7). I I inherited a system that had a lot of oppose \"rinky-dink\" accounting. \"rinky-dink\" accounting which I have tried very hard to eliminate. Let me tell you, from experience, that not only does \"cooking the books\" not work, it makes things worse. I have detailed my objections to loan loss amortization in pages 2 and 3 of Fxhibit 8. To others, forbearance means that FSLIC should not place hopelessly insolvent thrifts into receivership. They reason that time heals all wounds, and that if FSLIC were simply to wait, property values would recover in five or ten years. This view requires the propagation of another myth: the theory that thrifts in some depressed regions are in trouble solely and exclusively because of the steep decline of the price https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis 8 of oil in 1985, and because of deregulation. The truth is more complicated. Property values have fallen sharply in some parts of the southwest. Many thrifts that followed prudent underwriting policies in these areas are solvent but have inadequate capital. A smaller group of thrifts, however, followed terrible underwriting and disbursement practices. As a result, the loans and direct investments they made were losses even during the boom times. There will be losses whatever happens to the price of oil. These thrifts were characterized by extraordinarily excessive growth. They largely stopped making home mortgage loans. They invested in the riskiest loans and direct investments. They loaned not just 100% of the value of the project, but also the money to pay for the fees and the first two or three years of interest. The borrowers rarely had any equity in the projects. The data on the bottom half of Exhibit 5 are instructive. Banks have a much higher capital requirement than thrifts: 6 percent capital, virtually all of it primary capital, as compared to 3 percent regulatory capital for FSLIC insured thrifts. Nevertheless, only 4 percent of all Texas banks are failing their capital requirement. Contrast this with the top half of Exhibit 5, which reveals the condition of Texas thrifts. The depressed Texas economy has caused less injury to banks because of their larger capital level and better underwriting practices. On average, the weakest 40 Texas thrifts grew 8 times faster than the national average from 1980 to 1986. Most of them grew more than 100 percent in some years. On average, this group is insolvent on a tangible basis by over 17 percent of liabilities. Their nonperforming assets are over 10 times the national average. Over 37 percent of the assets of this group are delinquent loans and real estate that the thrifts have had to take back through foreclosure. Their ongoing net operating losses (again, this does not include losses from writedowns) are running at over 6 percent of their assets. Whereas the group placed approximately 70% of its assets in 1-4 family mortgages in 1980, by 1985 it placed 22% of its assets in such loans. In 1980, this Texas group placed only 2.4 percent of its assets in high risk land loans. By 198, the group was placing 20 percent, almost eight times the national average, in such loans. The same group placed almost three times the national average of direct investments in their portfolios. This relatively small group of thrifts sowed the seeds of their own destruction in 1982 and 1983 and had already reaped a bitter harvest by 1984 -- well before the sharp fall in oil prices. By December 1984 this group had over 4 times the national average in foreclosed properties and delinquent loans, and it was suffering substantial net operating losses. On a tangible net worth basis, this group had already become insolvent by December 1984. This group of thrifts paid massive dividends on the basis of artificially generated fee income. In 1983, the group paid out 18.7 percent of its reported tangible net worth out as dividends -- compared to a national average of 3.8 percent. In the https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis 9 first quarter of 1984, the group paid dividends at nine times the national rate. Even after the group was, on average, insolvent on a tangible basis it continued to pay substantial dividends in 1984, 1985 and the first half of 1986. Supervisory orders were generally required to halt further dissipation. There are tremendous costs to the FSLIC of delay in closing hopelessly insolvent thrifts. Time cannot heal the wounds of sudh thrifts. Let me illustrate this problem with respect to one institution that is a part of this group of 40. It is currently reporting approximately $1 billion in assets and a negative GAAP net worth of over $450 million. On a tangible basis, it is insolvent by over $0.5 billion. Over 40 percent of its assets are non-performing. If we were to go into a holding pattern for 5 years, its estimated net operating losses would be as follows (in millions): $125 1987 $156 1988 S175 1989 S193 1990 $204 1991 TDTAL....$853 By the end of 1991, this one thrift would be over $1.3 billion insolvent. This one thrift's net operating losses would represent roughly one-fifth of FSLIC's annual premium in 1991. In my opinion, the systemic and individualized attempts to prevent the Bank Board from resolving such hopelessly insolvent thrift cases must stop. No rational regulatory system or insurance fund can survive if efforts to undermine its effectiveness and credibility are allowed to succeed. Congress criticized us sternly for not being sufficiently firm in preventing unlawful and unsafe practices in the Dallas district. Roy Green and Joe Selby of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas are under slanderous attack because they are doing their duty as regulators. The Bank Board has gone to the outer limits of rational forbearance. We seek your support for our forbearance policy and for our plan to provide funds sufficient to perform our regulatory duties and resolve hopelessly insolvent thrift cases. Another reason offered by some for delaying passage of an adequate FSLIC recapitalization bill is the issue of whether the FSLIC is capable of spending the new funds wisely and effectively. I agree that FSLIC recapitalization requires a capable system for utilizing the funds in case resolution and liquidating assets over a period of time. I have made clear many times, in testimony before the Congress and in numerous speeches to industry groups, that constraints on FSLIC by the Office of Management and Budget (\"OMB\") and the Office of Personnel https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis 10 Management (\"OPM\") have severely impaired our ability to attract and maintain the numbers and quality of FSLIC staff we need to accamplish these goals. The response to our critical needs in this regard has been thoroughly inadequate. This is why I joined with my fellow federal financial regulators in strong support of the Carper-Lundine legislation in the last Congress. This legislation is still desperately needed by the Bank Board to achieve far greater flexibility in our effort to attract and retain the kind of staff necessary in adequate numbers to meet the critical challenges we face. FSLIC has had to handle the liquidation of assets of approximately the same dollar amount as the FDIC with a staff that has scores of people instead of the thousands of FDIC personnel assigned to liquidation efforts. FDIC is not under the same crippling staffing and salary constraints imposed on the Bank Board and FSLIC by OMB and OPM. This is why I spearheaded the effort to charter the Federal Asset Disposition Association (\"FADA\"), to be able to attract the quality of personnel needed to assist the FSLIC in the most cost-effective asset disposition program. FADA has made tremendous strides already in helping us to achieve this objective. I am confident that our future liquidation efforts will be of the highest caliber. We have also taken measures to improve FSLIC case processing. Last year I requested a comprehensive study of the FSLIC function by an independent management consultant. The firm of Booz Allen & Hamilton completed its study late last September and recommended that, given the constraints on FSLIC's resources, much of the FSLIC case resolution staffing function should be delegated to the Federal Hone Loan Banks, with principal oversight and quality control over the function to be assigned to the FSLIC staff and Board in Washington. A Federal Home Loan Bank System-wide task force has nearly completed its work on how best to implement recommendations of the Booz Allen study. The task force will report to the Bank Board within the next few weeks. I am confident implementation of the task force recommendations will Q0 a long way toward reassuring all parties of the increased capability of the FSLIC function in managing recapitalization funds and disposing of assets carefully and wisely in the future. The Bank Board has already demonstrated the fruits of similar initiatives taken over the past several years. These initiatives came as a result of our frustration with the same kinds of crippling OMB and OPM constraints I have already mentioned. Delegation of the examination function to our Principal Supervisory Agents in the 12 Federal Home Loan Bank districts more than doubled our field examination staff in little more than a year and a half. Our professional supervisory staff in the Federal Home Loan Bank districts more than tripled in two and half years. Oversight of these critical functions -- in defense of the resources of the FSLIC -- has been significantly strengthened with the https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis 11 establishment of the new Office of Regulatory Policy, Oversight and Supervision in Washington, a Federal Hare Loan Bank System entity that reports directly to the Bank Board. The Bank Board's growth, direct investment, and capital regulations are examples of very significant progress on the regulatory front, despite the opposition to them by certain powerful segments of the thrift industry. We are taking the personnel and regulatory steps essential to ensure that FSLIC funds are spent wisely, and that future thrift failures are minimized. Particularly given the obstacles we faced, I am proud of the advances we have made. Further delay in oassing the Bank Board/Treasury recapitalization plan is unwarranted. Further delay is also dangerous. The Ohio and Maryland thrift insurance funds failed to maintain public confidence before they became insolvent. If FSLIC fails to maintain public confidence the resulting crisis could require a taxpayer bailout. Prompt action by Congress assuring that the FSLIC fund will, indeed, be adequately recapitalized over the next five to seven years is today's necessity if we are to maintain and restore confidence in the thrift system and the FSLIC. The recapitalization plan we have proposed will go a very long way now to meet that critical need, and achieve that extremely important objective. I invite, indeed I strongly encourage, continuing strong oversight by the Congress over the FSLIC recapitalization process in all its dimensions. Thank you very much for your help and continued support. Sincerely, Edwin J.

Cray today announced issuance by the Board of a formal policy statement on forbearance for FSLIC-insured savings institutions experiencing temporary financial difficulties due to distressed regional economies. Mr. Gray said the forbearance statement is modeled closely after a policy statement issued last year by the federal commercial banking regulatory agencies dealing with energy and agricultural banks'. The Bank Board Chairman also announced the issuance by the staff of revised appraisal guidelines (revisions in R-41c). In a related step, he said he intends to ask the Board to propose promptly a rule, the purpose being to elicit the widest possible public comment on what appraisal standards should be used in the savings institutions industry. He said the revised appraisal standards that would result would take into account appropriate concerns of FSLIC-insured institutions and professional appraisal organizations. Mr. Gray also said he intends to recommend to the Bank Board amendments to its classification of assets rule that would generate public comments on the desirability of making the Board's rule more uniform with longstanding commercial banking regulatory agencies' practices. Reproposal of the Bank Board's Classification of Assets Rule The Chairman said he believes greater uniformity among federal financial regulators and insurers is generally desirable and he looks forward to receiving broad public comments on such a proposal. Mr. Gray said such a move toward closer uniformity would make the Bank Board's classification of assets practices less appraisal-driven and would emphasize greater discretion and judgment. For example, he said, a \"doubtful\" classification would no longer require a specific loss reserve that reduces the net worth of an institution. He said such a proposal would allow savings institutions, like banks, to count general reserves towards capital and thereby help encourage the establishment of adequate general reserves for losses in the savings institutions industry. It could lead to the requirement for increased capital only where it makes sense to impose such requirement. In moving the Bank Board's classification of assets practices much closer to commercial banking regulatory practices, hence emphasizing greater discretion and judgment and less reliance on property appraisals, the Chairman said the proposal would provide the following important characteristics: https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis 2 Examiners, and ultimately supervisory agents, would have more flexibility in determining whether a loss exists, since the system would be less appraisal-oriented; There would be no specific loss reserves created when an asset is classified as \"doubtful;\" Where the principal supervisory agent required additional general reserves as a result, in part, of assets classification, such general reserves could be counted towards the thrift's capital requirement; and The principal supervisory agent could order a greater capital requirement if the particular portfolio of a thrift indicates a need for additional capital. Appraisal Reforms Chairman Gray announced an important staff action taken in response to concerns that have been raised regarding certain aspects of appraisal guidelines contained in R -41c. The Office of Regulatory Policy, Oversight and Supervision (\"ORPOS\") has today issued a clarification intended to alleviate those concerns. Today's ORPOS memorandum seeks to clarify four important matters: 1. Compliance with Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae underwriting appraisal and appraisal reporting guidelines (and standard form reports) is considered sufficient for appraisals on one-to-four family dwellings and multi -family properties. 2. In order to assist in cost control of appraisal services, the Bank Board encourages the appraisal industry to develop standardized forms that are consistent with uniform appraisal standards, for use wherever possible. Sucn for.r.s would have to be pre-approved by the Bank Board. 3. It is not intended that the appraiser become enmeshed :n aspects of the underwriting process other than those necessary to perform the appraisal. 4. An appraiser shall report a present market value for botn existing properties and for proposed developments. The appraiser may also report a value as of the conclusion Df construction and as of the projected date when stabilize2 occupancy is achieved. The Congress has complimented the Bank Board's appraisal standards. The Bank Board has taken the lead in seeking to develop appropriate appraisal standards. A recent House Committee report concluded: \"Among all the Federal banking agencies, only the FHLBB has a highly developed and comprehensive system regarding appraisal policies, practices and procedures.\" https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis 41111. 3 Indeed, the House Committee report recommended that all federal financial institution insurers and regulators should undertake \"the development and dissemination of appraisal guidelines utilizing the FHLBB's Memorandum #R-41b, as a model\". Chairman Gray expressed his belief that, as clarified, R-41c is an important safeguard for the industry. The clarifications to R-41c are designed to reduce costs to the industry. The Chairman is hopeful that standardized appraisal forms can be developed promptly that will significantly reduce the costs and delays of obtaining an appraisal. Chairman Gray also indicated his desire to move even more broadly to enhance the Bank Board's appraisal standards. In announcing that he will ask the Bank Board to propose a rule, whose purpose would be to revise, as appropriate, its appraisal standards, the Bank Board Chairman said again he would press for the broadest possible range of public comments on what appraisal standards should be used in the thrift industry. Policy Statement on Forbearance Chairman Gray said the Bank Board has long followed a policy of forbearance toward well run savings institutions experiencing temporary financial difficulties due to distressed regional economies. The Board's formal policy statement on forbearance tracks closely a policy statement on capital forbearance issued by the commercial banking regulatory agencies in April of last year for energy and agricultural commercial banks. Mr. Gray said the Bank Board does not support the creation of accounting gimmicks or any moves that could have the result of effectively \"cooking the books\" of federally-insured savings institutions. Moreover, he said, the Bank Board will continue to take action to reduce existing problems that are the product of fraud, insider abuse, self dealing, imprudence or incompetence and prevent the creation of new problems. He emphasized, however, that considerable number of savings institutions, with good managements, are experiencing problems that are principally the result of temporarily depressed regional economies. He said the Bank Board n3s long worked with such institutions to help turn them around, wl.:1 the goal of ultimately restoring them to health. Mr. Gray said the Bank Board has taken steps to raise capital requirements generally and to bring its definition of capital more in line with that used by commercial bank regulators. Increased capital and supervision, he said, are vital to protect savings institutions and the FSLIC fund from the effects of regional economic downturns.

The statement outlines a capital forbearance policy designed generally to benefit insured instit utions having sufficient capital to absorb loan losses and reasonable prospects to replenish capital, and it reiterates previous Board statements regarding the restructuring of loans and accounting for them.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Introduction: The last few years have proved to be a particularly difficult period for insured institutions and their borrowers in region s suffering from lower energy prices. During this period, an histpri- cally large number of insured institutions have failed and an even larger number have developed serious problems. Similarly, insured institutions and borrowers dependent on the agricultural and natural resources sectors of the economy have been experiencing seriou s financial difficulties. In light of these problems, the Board believes it approp riate to employ supervisory policies that will support basica lly sound, well-managed thrifts in weathering what is expected to be a difficult https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Amr Page 3 but temporary period. Implementation will be accomplished by encouraging thrifts to work with their troubled borrowers; by establishing a capital forbearance policy; and by reaffirming that generally accepted accounting principles can be used to permit loan restructuring without loss recognition, where approp riate. In response to this situation, the Board encourages thrifts to develop work-out strategies with their troubled borrowers in appropriate situations. Entering into work-out plans with borrowers who are experiencing temporary difficulties in meeting their debt service obligations is often in the best interests of all partie s. Although examiners will point out to managements the weakne sses that may be present in loans, the Board does not automatically require foreclosure on collateral or acceleration of the maturi ty of loans. The Board recognizes that downturns in certain sectors of the economy are expected to be transitory. Therefore, lenders may find that the most prudent policy is to restructure loan terms rather than to take more precipitous action, such as foreclosure. II. Capital Forbearance Policy Despite the difficult problems facing many thrifts in the oil and gas, agricultural, or natural resources sectors, the Board believes that most have sound prospects for the future. https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Even with F Page 4 the losses suffered by these thrifts and the likelihood that losses will continue to occur, these thrifts possess inherent value and capable management that adheres to sound lending policies. Accordingly, the Board is implementing a capital forbearance policy that will benefit basically well-managed thrifts that have reasonable prospects of turning around. Capital forbearance formally acknowledges that capital replenishment takes time. The capital forbearance policy should provide greater incentives to thrifts to recognize promptly losses arising in their loan portfolios, to work with borrowers to restructure loans, and to rebuild their strength. Under the capital forbearance policy, the Board is unlikely to take administrative action to enforce the minimum capital requirements in 12 CFR 563.13 (\"section 563.13\") against a thrift whose regulatory net worth ratio declines below its minimum requirement to no less than 0.5 percent before December 31, 1987, provided the thrift meets the following qualifications and conditions: 1. The weakened capital position of the thrift must be largely the result of problems in the energy, agriculture, natural resources, or other distressed sectors of the economy and not due to excessive thrift operating expenses, imprudent operating practices, excessive https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Page 5 growth, highly speculative ventures, insider abuse, excessive dividends, or actions taken solely for the purpose of qualifying for capital forbearance. 2. The thrift must be well-managed. In reaching determinations about the quality of a thrift's management, the Board will take into account existing management's past record of performance in guiding the thrift, including its timely recognition of loan losses and other weaknesses. The Board will also consider the thrift's past compli- ance with any agreements with, commitments to, or orders from the Board. Further, the Board will consider the capability of management to develop and implement an acceptable turn-around plan. 3. The thrift must submit an acceptable plan for restoring capital within a reasonable time period to the minimums required by section 563.13. The plan should describe the means and schedule by which capital will be increased. address dividend levels; This plan should also specifically compensation of directors, executive officers, or individuals having a controlling interest; asset and liability growth; and payments for services or products furnished by affiliated companies. The plan should provide for improvement in the thrift's regulatory capital on a continuous or periodic basis from earnings, capital injections, liability and asset shrinkage, combination thereof. or A plan that projects no significant improvement in capital until near the end of the forbearance period will not https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis a Page 6 generally be acceptable. The Board may require modification of a thrift's plan in order for the thrift to receive, or to continue to receive, capital forbearance. 4. The thrift must commit to filing annual progress reports regarding compliance with its capital plan. Depending on an individ- ual thrift's progress, more frequent reports may be required. Moreover, any contemplated actions that would represent a material variance from the capital plan must be submitted to the Principal Supervisory Agent (\"PSA\") for review. Thrifts with capital levels below the minimums established in section 563.13 seeking capital forbearance must file a written request no later than December 31, 1987, with the PSA for the District in which the thrift is located. The request must include a certification and explanation of its eligibility to participate (covering items 1 through 3 above), its plan, and its commitment to file the required reports. Capital forbearance will be considered granted unless, within 60 days of receipt of the request, the PSA notifies the thrift that its request has been denied or that add tional information or time is required. Pursuant to section 563.13, during the period covered by this capital forbearance, 3 thrift granted capital forbearance and in compliance with an accepta- https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Page 7 ble capital plan will not be subject to the corrective actions provided for violation of the minimum capital ratios required by section 563.13. Upon written request by the thrift and at the discretion of the Board, the capital forbearance policy may be extended in special circumstances to a thrift with a regulatory net worth level lower than 0.5 percent. While this policy remains in effect, the Board reserves the right to terminate capital forbearance for any thrift engaged in unsafe or unsound or other objectionable practices, or where it is apparent to the Board that the thrift is unwilling or unable to comply with an acceptable capital plan. The Board also expressly reserves the right to modify or terminate capital forbearance at any time for any thrift that was granted capital forbearance because it was not notified of denial or the need for additional information within 60 days, as provided above. Some thrifts are at present subject to capital requirements higher than those specified in section 563.13 by a capital directive, an effective order issued pursuant to statute, or a formal agreement between a thrift and the Board, if they are eligible to participate in the Board's forbearance program. Thrifts that have experienced losses and are subject to a capital ratio higher than the https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Page 8 minimums set forth in section 563.13 may request a modification from the Board, if they are eligible to participate in the Board's forbearance program. The Board will reconsider the higher require- ment in light of the capital forbearance policy. In addition, the Board's capital forbearance policy extends to well-managed thrifts whose regulatory capital ratios decline , as a result of problems In the oil and gas, agricultural, or natural resources sectors of the economy, from historic levels to levels above the minimum capital requirement. These thrifts do not have to apply for capital forbearance, and the Board will not require them to take any action solely on the basis of that decline in capital. These thrifts will be expected to maintain adequate capital for the nature of their operations and, if appropriate, to increase their capital over time back to historic levels. In addition, these thrifts must recognize that asset growth should be accompanied by appropriate increases in capital. All thrifts that are operating with capital levels below those that would be expected under normal economic conditions should be aware that the Board will be unlikely to approve applications by them to acquire other thrifts. Similarly, the Board will be likely to object to changes in control or acquisitions of such thrifts unless the transaction will clearly strengthen their financial condition. https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Page 9 The implementation of the Board's capital forbearance policy has no effect on balance sheet or income statement items reported in reports or other financial statements, nor does it allow thrifts to report, as assets, loans (or portions thereof) considered losses. On the contrary, the policy retains existing financial presentation rules and creates no inconsistencies with generally accepted accounting principles. The Board believes that maintaining the integrity of financial statements is vital to assuring confidence in the thrift system. III. Accounting For Troubled Debt Restructurings The Board has followed, and will continue to follow, generally accepted accounting principles with respect to loans that have been formally restructured to enable the borrower to service the debt. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 15 (FAS 15), Accounting by Debtors and Creditors for Troubled Debt Restructurings, governs the accounting for such restructurings. This Standard allows a loan to continue to be carried on the thrift's books without any loss recognition if the loan is formally restructured so that it Is probable and estimable that the borrower can repay the loan under the new terms and that the total future cash payments by the borrower (principal and interest combined) at least equals the loan amount on the thrift's books. https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Page 10 Accordingly, a thrift that reasonably expects a borrower's future cash payments to equal or exceed the loan amount does not need to recognize a loss on the restructuring. In those situations where it is expected that the future cash payments on the restructured loan will be less than the loan amount, the loss recognized is limited to the expected cash flow deficiency. IV. Forbearance With Respect to Insolvent Insured Institutions It has been and is the practice of the Board not to place insured institutions into receivership automatically upon their reporting negative regulatory net worth. Instead, the Board examines the integrity and effectiveness of management, management's compl _ ance with applicable law and regulation, and the quality of the underlying assets. Where the Board believes that management is capable and the underlying assets may recover sufficiently in value if there is an economic recovery in the affected sectors, the Board's policy is to work with such institutions to seek to turn them aroJnd and restore them to health. https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis By the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.

Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis https://fraser.stlouisfed.org EXHIBIT # 8 1 700 G Street N W VVasmington. 0 C 20552 Federal Home Loan Bank Board Federal soma Loan Bank System Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ederai Sayings and Loan insurance Corporation EDWIN J GRAY CHAIRMAN March 2, 1987 Honorable Steve Bartlett United States House of Representatives 1709 Longworth House Office Building Washington, DC 20515 Dear Congressman Bartlett: In response to your request for comments of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (\"Bank Board\" or \"Board\") on H.R. 1063, the Thrift Forbearance and Supervisory Reform Act (the \"Act\"), I offer the following points on the Act and on the issue of forbearance. The Board recognizes that severe economic conditions may periodically create additional financial pressure for insured institutions and has exercised forbearance in such situations. In response to suggestions that the Board make its policy more formal, we have taken three significant initiatives: First, the Board has prepared a formal statement on forbearance. The Board has long followed a policy of extraordinary forbearance toward well-run savings and loan associations experiencing temporary financial difficulties due to distressed regional econamics. The Board will continue to take vigorous action to reduce problems that are the result of fraud, insider abuse, or incampetence; however, the Board will continue to work with savings and loans whose problems are primarily the result of inadequate capital and temporarily depressed regional economics. That continued policy of rehabilitation will be made explicit through issuance of the statement. Second, I am asking the Board to consider a regulatory proposal, for public comment, containing the standards used by the Bank Board to evaluate the soundness of real estate appraisals. The Board's appraisal standards are crucial for sound underwriting and supervision. Moreover, the Board has taken the lead in developing appropriate appraisal standards and has been praised by congressional committees for having done so. However, it is critical that such appraisal standards not result in inaccurate valuation of real estate, nor should such standards cause undue delay and expense to the industry. Accordingly, the rulemaking, which I 33K the Board to consider, should provide the fullest opportunity for all interested parties to assist the Board in evaluating the effectiveness of our current appraisal standards and in shaping any refinements deemed appropriate. https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis interested parties to assist the Board in evaluating the effectiv eness of our current appraisal standards and in shaping any refinements deem ed appropriate. Finally, I plan to seek Board consider ation of proposed amendmen our classification of assets rule. ts to Again, I cannot help but beli eve that the widest range of public comm ent will enhance the Board's demonstrated responsiveness to exis ting economic conditions as we consider the desirability of making the Board's classification of assets rule uniform with the commercial banking more regulatory agencies' longstan ding classification of assets practice s. In summary, we agree with the spon sors of the Act that there is important role for rational forbeara an nce. We appreciate the dili gence of their efforts and their request for our assistance in formulating a rational approach to forbearance. Some of the mechanisms in the Act are consistent with our existing rule s and the initiatives I have proposed. Other provisions, however, could cause unintentional injury to the FSLIC fund. My specific comments on the provisions of the Act are as follows: [DAN rags AMDFCIZATICN I cannot support the Act's prop osal to allow thrifts to amortize qualified loan losses over five to ten years. As you know, this would be improper under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GM?\" ). The effect is to allow an institution to fail to report currently its losses when calculating its regulatory capital requirement. My objectio ns are as follows: https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis 1. The resulting financial stat ements could mislead the public. GAAP forbids such loan loss amortization because it causes an inaccurate report of the current financial cond ition of the institution. I know you share my belief that it is cont rary to public policy to mislead the depositing and investing publ ic. I inherited a system that had many non-GAAP accounting provisio ns that could mislead the public by overstating the true financial cond ition of thrifts. I have successfully led the fight to abol ish many of these so-called crea tive regulatory accounting principles. I am firmly opposed to \"cooking the books.\" 2. The resulting financial stat ements would not be comparable. An important reason for the creation of GAAP was to make financial statements of different entities comparable. The proposed loan amortization harms comparabilit y in three ways. First, many thrifts are subject to GAAP reportin g rules. Their financials will be prepared under GAAP and they will not be able to amortize loan losses. Many non-GAAP reporting thri fts would probably amortize loan loss es. Second, thrifts outside the desi gnated depressed regions who do not have substantial loans to thos e regions will not be able to amortize loan losses. In addition, because only some loans would qualify for amortization, the financials of thrifts would be a hodgepodge of \"full\" and amortized losses. 3. The proposed exception for institutional responsibility for losses would be unworkable. I applaud the obvious intent of Congressman Bartlett's proposed exception. I know the purpose of the Act is to prevent abuses. Unfortunately, I believe that it is unworkable. As I read subsection (5), the Board could order a thrift to cease amortizing losses from particular loans meeting the specified standards. It is not clear whether the Board would bear the burden of proof. We do not have the resources to review the tens of thousands of loans that might be amortized. Under an order to end amortization, financials would have to be reissued, probably with an explanation that the Bank Board had found the losses to be the result of criminal acts or other acts warranting a cease and desist order. The effect of such a financial restatement could be devastating. 4. Amortization would be counter-productive to weak thrifts. Bad accounting drives bad decision making. Amortization could delay, sometimes for years, the Board's ability to take effective action against a thrift that was in fact hopelessly insolvent, but was reporting positive regulatory capital because amortization delayed the recognition of those losses. Moreover, the Bank Board's experience is that markets are not easily fooled by relative regulatory accounting principles. Indeed, we believe that markets react adversely to \"cooked books\" and increase the cost of capital to industries employing such techniques. The Bank Board and the thrift industry fell into disrepute with the Congress, investors, the accounting profession, and other financial institutions when my predecessors embraced creative regulatory accounting principles. We cannot survive a continuation, much less an increase, in accounting principles that hide the true financial condition of thrifts. Worse, like price subsidies, phony accounting is addictive. I recognize that the Act has a 1991 sunset date, but passage of the Act would create tremendous pressure to extend that date. My experience at the Bank Board in trying to wean thrifts from their addiction to creative regulatory accounting principles has taught me how difficult it is for a thrift to go \"cold turkey\" and report its true financial condition after years of reporting an artificially inflated net worth. My overall position is that it is critical that associations report, and that the Bank Board be able to act on the basis of, the true financial condition of each thrift. Rational forbearance requires accurate accounting. TROUBLED DEB'r RESTRUCIURING The Bank Board's accounting principles already incorporate GAAP's provisions for troubled debt restructuring (\"TDR\"). Thrifts can account for TDRs under GAAP at this time. The Bank Board's policy statement on capital forbearance reaffirms this. https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis GAAP APPLICABLE OOR CERTAIN REGULATORY PURPOSES This provision raises three substantial concerns. First, a classification of assets system has been used by commercial banking regulators for several decades. The Bank Board has adopted a similar system, and I am proposing that our system be made more uniform with the banking regulators' approach. Classification of assets is not an accounting principle; therefore, I presume that it is not \"inconsistent with [(IMP].\" If, however, the Act is intended to bar or restrict the use of a classification of assets system, then I am substantially troubled. GAAP simply does not address many issues--it was never designed to be the regulatory system for insured financial institutions, and it would not be adequate to protect the safety and soundness of thrifts or banks. Second, it appears to bar the effective use of reappraisals to establish loan losses. Appraisals try to find market values. They measure the economic loss when it is present. Appraisal methodology is not an accounting principle. It is not \"inconsistent with [GNU].\" Rather, it is a different system—one whose importance to protect FSLIC from losses has been recognized by Congress. Third, I find unacceptable the requirement that no \"procedure, standard, or interpretation\" of any of our regulation on loss reserves, classifications of assets, or appraisals may be implemented other than by regulation. It would severely handicap the Board's examination and supervisory efforts. This provision is not a forbearance measure. It would prevent a supervisory body from reacting responsibly to a rapidly changing environment. Neither the FDIC, the Comptroller of the Currency, nor the Federal Reserve are so impeded from giving guidance to their examiners, supervisors and regulated industries as would be the Board under this provision. No regulation can answer every question. A regulation that tries to define every term and foresee every contingency becames a hypertechnical nightmare in terms of length and complexity. Staff interpretations and general counsel opinions interpreting a regulation are vital to the effectiveness of any regulation. They are viewed by the industry as an important service for a regulatory body to provide. Indeed, this provision would have shackled the Board from issuing timely interpretations or procedures implementing forbearance. Serving as but one example is a staff interpretation in August of 1986 (SP-68) granting forbearance in the determination of the amount of doubtful classifications which would be reserved from capital accounts. More recently a staff interpretation clarified certain misinterpreted sections of R-41c guiding appraisal standards. This relief would have been much longer in arriving had the Bank Board been powerless to act, other than through rulemaking. This provision is an undue and unacceptable restriction to the Board's effective supervision of the thrift industry. https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis LOAM LOSS RESERVES TREATED AS CAPITAL FOR CERTAIN PURPOSES The commercial banking regulatory agencies all general reserves to be reported as primary capital. This is very controversial, and the Federal Reserve has solicited comment on whether this provision should be ended. Nevertheless, I am proposing that the Bank Board amend its classification of assets regulation to end the current provision that creates specific loss reserves for assets classified \"doubtful.\" The Bank Board's capital regulations already allow general reserves to be treated as regulatory capital. APPEAL OF CERTAIN ADVERSE DETERMINATIONS I believe that the proposed arbitration mechanism would impose undue delay and confidentiality problems and is inconsistent with proper accountability of the Principal Supervisory Agent. I have attached a copy of an alternative proposal designed to meet these policy goals without running afoul of these concerns. REVIEW OF REGULATIONS I have no objection to this provision of the Act. FLEXIBILITY IN RENEGOTIATION OF CERTAIN LOANS I agree that unnecessary regulatory delays should be avoided. I do not understand the provision of the Act dealing with treatment as \"new loans.\" I would appreciate further guidance on what change this language is intended to accamplish. FLEXIBILITY IN ANALYZING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY OF A BORROWER The Bank Board's current rules do give supervisory agents the flexibility this provision of the bill seeks. I am taking steps to reemphasize the flexibility available to our supervisory agents, stressing the need to consider all sources of credit pledged to secure the loan. GUIDELINES CN REAPPRAISALS UPON FORECLOSURE I have no objection to providing such guidelines. fair market reappraisal upon foreclosure. https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis GAAP requires a MAXIMUM AMOUNT umrrATIoN FOR CERTAIN COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS I agree that such limits should be tightened. I would propose that the Bank Board address this issue by regulation. My only concern with the draft language in the Act is that it could be read as prohibiting the Bank Board from adopting a more stringent regulation requiring that the borrower place real equity into the project. ENDEPENDENT AGENCY STATUS FOR FSLIC I agree that the budgetary and personnel limits imposed on the FSLIC, create an unacceptable burden given the crisis we face. These limits are not necessary to protect the taxpayer; indeed, they are counter productive. The cost of FSLIC's operations are funded by the industry, not by the taxpayers. FEASIBILITY STUDY RELATING TO ESTABLISHMENT OF ASSET ACQUISITDON OORPORATION I agree that a study could be useful. In conclusion, the Board looks forward to working with you, Congressman Bartlett, the co-sponsors of H.R. 1063, members of the Banking Committee, and others in the 100th Congress as we address one of the financial legislative imperatives of our time--the FSLIC recapitalization. While all related issues should be and will be addressed responsibly and efficiently, as I believe the Board demonstrates in response to this bill, we at the Board cannot underscore enough our view that it is of utmost importance to the public good that the primary focus remain on recapitalization until the FSLIC receives those desperately needed funds. Sincerely, Edwin J. Gray Chairman https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis 1700 G Street, N.W.

GRAY CHAIRMAN January 12, 1987 Chairman Paul A. Volcker Federal Reserve System 20th Street and Constitution Ave., N.W. Washington, D.C. 20551 Dear Paul: Thank you for your continuing interest in our FSLIC Recapitalization Bill. As you know, I strongly believe that this Bill must be passed as soon as possible if we are to maintain the viability of the FSLIC fund. • Permit me to summarize the risks from our perspective if this proposal is indefinitely delayed. The U.S. League of Savings Institutions has developed a plan with much less resources than the Treasury/Bank Board Plan, which will, if fully considered by Congress, exacerbate this time delay. These risks are treated in more depth in the attached letter to Ken McLean (Attachment I) of November 26, 1986. They are: 1. The risk of a liquidity crisis brought on by an inability of our Federal Home Loan Banks to renew and issue new FSLIC guaranteed advances. Such advances are currently at $3.6 billion with pending requests of over $2 billion. We are currently difficient $2 billion in collateral for existing advances alone. (Attachment II Guaranteed Advance memorandum of January 8, 1987.) 2. A risk that is not adequately considered in the U.S. League Plan is the cost of delay. We are currently losing over $6 million per day in operating losses on FSLIC and other supervisory cases. This does not include the deterioration of asset quality, which the U.S. League assumes will inflate over time. In other words, there is a significant time premium in resolving problems as soon as possible to stop the hemorrhaging as opposed to the U.S. League's more leisurely approach of providing $10 billion less in funds over the first five years. 3. The third risk is that further delay and Congressional \"wrangling\" created all or in part by a competing recapitalization plans, may doom all such plans to failure. Since both these plans now depend on borrowing, further delays in addition to the inability of the 99th Congress to pass such legislation as well as a continued deterioration in the fund may make external borrowing impossible or very costly. Wall Street may not have the patience or confidence to market such blemished agency paper. • https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis 2 4. The risk of a rise in interest rates must be considered when evaluating such plans. The GAO has estimated that the cost of only a 200 basis point rise in rates could raise costs to the FSLIC by $7 billion over two years. The advantage of our $15 billion borrowing program spread over 5 or 6 years as compared to the U.S. League $5 billion program locked into two years provides more funds up front as needed and the flexibility of working with the inevitable interest rate cycles. 5. The tax bill is also a consideration in this matter. As of December 31, 1988, some key provisions related to the tax treatment of the acquisition of troubled by healthy financial institutions expires. 6. A final risk is the continuation of higher deposit cost that FSLIC institutions are paying over FDIC institutions. This is estimated at greater than $4 billion at this time. A more rapid resolution of this Bill could have savings for this year as well as the future. • I have also attached for your review copies of our latest cash flow for a $15 billion borrowing program (Attachment III), our best attempt to put the U.S. League Plan in a cash flow format (Attachment IV) and finally a comparison of our respective plans (Attachment V). Some key differences in the two plans are: • 1. Additional funds from our plan of $3.2 billion over the first three years, $9.5 billion over the first five and $9.5 billion over the first seven years. 2. Additional cases resolution of $2.1 billion over the first three years, $6.8 billion over the first five years and $9.6 billion over the first seven years. 3. Fund reserves grow to $5.4 billion by year eight under our plan, while staying low and flat at $3.0 billion under the League plan. 4. The cost of delays from operating losses alone is over $3 billion under the U.S. League plan over a ten year horizon. I believe that each of these plans will be implemented credibility in such a careful consideration of the financial structure of in the context of the dynamic environment in which they is what is needed at this time. Your knowledge and matters is greatly needed at this time. Sincerely, Edwin J. Gray Chairman • Attachments cc: George Gould https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis C 11 I https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Personal and Confidential 1700 G Street.

McLean Minority Staff Director Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Senate Dirksen Office Building Washington, D.C. 20510 Dear Mr. McLean: We appreciated your recent mee ting with us to present perspective of the current con a comprehensive dition of the FSLIC. The first line staff perspective is viewpoint from the that the passage of the recapitalization of the plan at the beginning of the 100th Congress is cri tical. Waiting six months or more could irreparab ly harm our plan which inv olves capital market borrowing because investors wou ld have little confidenc e in the strength of the Congressional support beh ind the plan. Als o, GAO has indicated that absence of early Congressional act ion in 1987 would cause difficulty in rendering a it to have great clean opinion for its audit ending December 31, 1986. Absence of a clean opinion would further harm our successful offering in the changes of a market. Worse yet, we are running the very real risk of a liquidity crisis in the thrift industry, partic ularly with some of our problem institutions that require FSLIC guaranteed advances. As we stated at our recent meeting, we need additiona resolve current and projec l funds now ted cases. These cases are now prTribir to asset-quality cases. .ily Unlike the spread cases of the early 1980s, the condition of these asset qua lity cases do not improv e over time. critics of the recapitalizatio Some n plan point to Talman Home Savings and Loan, the $5.8 billion \"phoenix\" instit ution in the process of issuing stock to the public, as an example of the advantages of waiting to res olve cases. Talman would have cost FSLIC $1 bil lion to liquidate in 198 2; it is now costing roughly one-half of that amo unt and 1985.) Even with additiona (including $350 million contributed in 1984 l resources, this is not the type of problem institution the FSLIC would rus h to close. Today's cases are more lik e Sunrise Savings, the institution placed in receivers $1.5 billion hip in September 1986, as a result of rapid growth (from $5 million in 1980), poor underwriting, mismanagement, and a large amount of acquisition, development and construct ion loans (ADC) which would now be classified as dir ect equity investments. This case is expected to cost the FSLIC approxima tel delay will cause further los y $680 million to resolve. In such cases, ses, due to management costs, taxes, insurance and the risk of projects bei ng characterized in the market as a \"white elephants\". https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis 2 • Some have suggested that the closing of these asset quality problem cases will lead to \"dumping\" of real estate in already depressed markets and to subsequent failure of additional thrifts. Such comments indicate a lack of understanding of the receivership process. FSLIC and its contractors, including the Federal Asset Disposition Association (FADA), attempt to maximize recovery of asset values -- not to maximize disposition speed. Business plans for each asset and the entire entity must be developed, reviewed and approved before any action can be taken. Assets can and have remained in receivership for a number of years until local market conditions accommodate disposition. We believe recapitalization of the FSLIC will have the effect of reducing any tendency to dump assets as the need for up front cash will be abated by recapitalization. The purpose of this letter is to further discuss the risks facing FSLIC if recapitalization is not passed early in the session. We would also like to emphasize the need for accompanying legislation to allow the Bank Board to assess an exit fee on healthy thrifts choosing to leave the FSLIC System. Such flight could lead to a reduction in the FSLIC premium base to a level insufficient to cover long-term debt service obligation on the Financing Corporation's bonds. After discussion of risks, we will provide some detailed background information you requested and supporting graphs. Risks The major risk in failure to pass the recapitalization plan early is the risk of a liquidity crisis for the FSLIC. The Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBanks) have been lending funds to institutions that are FSLIC cases and do not have adequate collateral on the condition that FSLIC provides a guarantee to the FHLBanks. Currently, there are approximately $3 billion of these advances outstanding ($2.3 billion are backed by collateral with a market value of only $600 million). They had been making these guaranteed loans under the assumption that FSLIC would be recapitalized. Since the current level of FSLIC's total reserves is only $3.5 billion (primary reserves of $2.7 billion) and is expected to decline to as low as $1 billion as early as January, passage of recapitalization early in 1987 is crucial if the FHLBanks are to continue lending to weak institutions. These guaranteed loans are essential. No other funds are available. The Federal Reserve Banks will only lend if eligible collateral is present. (While a Treasury line of credit is authorized by the National Housing Act, it is only $750 million.) The FHLBanks' boards of directors and managers have fiduciary responsibility to their members and may require repayment of existing loans and refuse to make new loans if recapitalization is not passed soon. Without this continued source of funds, a liquidity crisis may ensue. • We had previously only disclosed this information to your and Senator Garn's staff in the closing days of the 99th Congress. This was done primarily because we did not want to precipitate the liquidity crisis such information could entail. Also, at that time this was only a potential problem because our independent FHLBank district boards of directors were still approving such transactions and had expressed no reluctance to do such. Since that time our twelve Federal Home Loan Bank presidents have informed us that this is a major issue with these Boards in the absence of FSLIC recapitalization and that they are reconsidering such transactions. https://fraser.stlouisfed.org Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis 3 • The second important concern is the increased costs to FSLIC resulting from ongoing operating losses experienced by failing institutions. FSLIC cases (Management Consignment Program and other FSLIC cases) are currently sustaining operating losses of $4.3 million per day; additionally, significant supervisory cases that are expected to fail within a year are losing $1.9 million per day -- for a total of over $6 million per day. The longer these institutions continue to operate, the more losses they accumulate. In fact, these operating losses will actually exceed the regular and special premiums and other income of FSLIC for 1986 by over $150 million. Without recapitalization, we are simply \"treading water', solving few if any cases, while the total caseload, and attendant costs, builds. This becomes analogous to the federal deficit, where we are borrowing money to pay the interest on the deficit, and not the deficit itself. With the passage of time, resolution costs for known cases are growing -- leaving no funds for new cases. This fact refutes the feasibility on any pay-as-you-go strategy that has been mentioned by some in the industry. The third risk is that further delay in the passage of legislation will actually doom the recapitalization plan to failure. The plan depends on the ability to access the capital markets at a reasonable cost. Ongoing adverse publicity concerning the shrinking FSLIC fund, the weak 20 percent of the thrift industry and the conversion by some thrifts to FDIC insurance may well cause investors to insist on very high rates on the bonds. If the bonds were to effectively deteriorate in quality to the essence of \"junk\" bonds, the plan fails because premium income will no longer cover interest payments. Of initial importance is the investors' perception of Congressional support behind the FSLIC since these lenders will not have the \"full faith and credit\" of the U.S. Government. Investors could well see cause for concern due to Congressional inaction in 1986. delVery prompt action in the new Congress would alleviate this concern, ay could exacerbate it. In addition, delaying implementation of the plan pushes back the receipt of funds. A market for the obligations will have to be developed and an investor base built up. The longer this is delayed the less funds will be available (this topic is discussed further below). The fourth risk is"
