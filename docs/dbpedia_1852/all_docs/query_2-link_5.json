        "text": "The Power of Recurring Donors with Abby Jarvis\n\nAugust 5 | 0:17:13 In this episode of the First Day Podcast, host Bill Stanczykiewicz, Ed.D. is joined by Abby Jarvis, Head of Content for Neon One. They discuss Neon One's new Recurring Giving Report, revealing significant trends and insights into the world of repeat donations. Abby breaks down the concept of recurring giving, explaining it as donations set to repeat at regular intervals, typically monthly. Surprisingly, the report shows a 127% increase in recurring donors between 2018 and 2022, suggesting that many donors are opting into these programs organically, without targeted fundraising efforts.\n\nOne standout finding is the remarkable long-term value of recurring donors. While annual donors might give more in a single year, they typically engage for just under two years. In contrast, recurring donors stay engaged for an average of eight years, creating a more stable and reliable funding stream for nonprofits. Abby emphasizes the emotional and personal connection these donors have with their chosen causes, which fosters long-lasting relationships. This deep connection is further evidenced by an analysis of over 13,000 donor notes, showing that recurring donors often express their personal identities and emotional investments in their contributions.\n\nThe conversation then shifts to the nonprofit organizations themselves. The data encompasses over 2,000 nonprofits of various sizes and sectors, revealing that larger nonprofits tend to capitalize more on recurring donations due to their greater resources and staff dedicated to these programs. However, Abby encourages smaller and mid-sized nonprofits to take cues from their larger counterparts and begin asking for recurring gifts. She highlights the importance of simply starting – enabling recurring donations on forms and communicating this option to donors through various channels.\n\nAs they wrap up, Bill and Abby discuss practical advice for fundraisers. The key takeaway is to start asking for recurring donations and to incorporate this option into regular fundraising appeals. By doing so, nonprofits can build deeper, long-term relationships with donors, leading to sustained support and increased funding over time. The episode underscores the potential of recurring giving programs to transform fundraising efforts and ensure the longevity and stability of nonprofit organizations.\n\nFundraising Training: Research Required with Amir Pasic, Ph.D.\n\nJuly 29 | 0:14:06 In this special 50th-anniversary episode of the First Day Podcast, host Bill Stanczykiewicz, Ed.D. welcomes Amir Pasic, Ph.D., Dean of the Indiana University Lilly Family School of Philanthropy.

Dr. Pasic points out that having academic and professional development programs under one roof enables immediate collaboration and synergy, enhancing the relevance and application of their research.\n\nAs the conversation unfolds, Bill and Dr. Pasic discuss the evolution of fundraising as a global profession. Dr. Pasic reflects on the international growth and professionalization of the field, fueled by cultural exchanges and the universal human inclination towards generosity. He discusses the dynamic nature of fundraising, likening its development to the global expansion of industries like music and film. This analogy underscores the burgeoning opportunities for learning and innovation in diverse cultural contexts, driven by shared principles of relationship-building and public service.\n\nLooking ahead, Dr. Pasic offers a thoughtful perspective on the future of fundraising amidst rapid technological advancements and societal changes. He underscores the importance of choice and agency in philanthropy, encouraging fundraisers to embrace the evolving landscape with a sense of purpose and adaptability.

They discuss the art of storytelling to enhance fundraising efforts, emphasizing its power in connecting with donors on a human level. Julia underscores that stories are fundamental to human communication and processing complex information, which is why they are so effective in fundraising.\n\nJulia addresses common challenges fundraisers face, such as determining which stories are worth sharing and navigating confidentiality issues. She highlights the importance of focusing on the \"why\" of an organization’s mission—its vision for the future and the problem it aims to solve—over the \"what\" and \"how.\" She suggests thinking like journalists and looking for everyday anecdotes that reflect the mission’s impact, even if they don't involve direct client interviews.\n\nThe conversation moves to the ethical considerations of storytelling in fundraising. Julia advocates for a \"Storyteller Bill of Rights\" to ensure the subjects of stories have control over their narratives. Trust between the organization and the storytellers is crucial, as is the respect for their autonomy. She shares her own experience in developing trust with program participants and stresses the importance of evaluating whether the stories would make the storytellers proud if shared publicly.\n\nFinally, Julia discusses the value of stories that don’t have happy endings. These narratives can be powerful fundraising tools by illustrating the ongoing challenges and needs within the organization’s mission. Authenticity about the difficulties faced and the progress being made helps donors understand the complexity of the issues and motivates continued support. The episode wraps up with a reminder of the practical courses offered by the Fundraising School, designed to equip nonprofit professionals with skills to enhance their fundraising strategies.\n\nFundraising Starts With Your Strategic Plan with Bill Stanczykiewicz, Ed.D.\n\nJuly 15 | 0:9:25 In this episode of the First Day Podcast, host Bill Stanczykiewicz, Ed.D. emphasizes the critical role of a strategic plan as the foundation for successful fundraising efforts. He begins by likening the strategic plan to a \"Big Bang\" moment for nonprofits, stressing its pivotal role akin to the genesis of relationships or partnerships. Bill highlights a surprising statistic from his extensive nonprofit experience: many organizations lack a formal, written strategic plan, hindering their ability to articulate their mission, goals, and impact effectively.\n\nDrawing on his own leadership experience, Bill recounts the impact of strategic planning on nonprofits, citing a significant foundation's insistence on seeing a strategic plan before awarding grants. He underscores how a well-documented strategic plan not only guides organizational strategy and programmatic decisions but also serves as a vital tool for fundraising, enabling nonprofits to clearly demonstrate to donors and stakeholders where their contributions will make a meaningful difference.\n\nBill walks listeners through the essential components of a strategic plan, including vision statements, mission statements, declarations, goals, and objectives. He emphasizes the importance of these elements in crafting compelling fundraising appeals and engaging with donors and volunteers effectively. By involving a broad range of stakeholders in the strategic planning process, including board members, staff, and external partners, nonprofits can ensure alignment with their mission and enhance their organizational governance and fundraising effectiveness.\n\nUltimately, the episode underscores the strategic plan's foundational role in nonprofit sustainability and growth, positioning it as not just a document but a roadmap for achieving impactful results and fostering donor confidence and support.\n\nFifty Years Of Fundraising Wisdom with Gene Tempel, Ed.D.\n\nJuly 8 | 0:21:25 In this episode of the First Day Podcast, host Bill Stanczykiewicz, Ed.D. is joined by Dr. Gene Tempel, the founder of the Indiana University Lilly Family School of Philanthropy.

They discuss the 2023 findings from the Giving USA report. The total charitable giving in the United States reached a record high of $557 billion in current dollars, showcasing a 2% increase from the previous year. However, when adjusted for inflation, there was a slight decline, highlighting the impact of economic factors on philanthropic trends.\n\nThe breakdown of charitable sources revealed a significant milestone as foundations surpassed $100 billion in donations for the second consecutive year, representing a steady increase in their share of total giving. Despite this growth, individual giving, which remains the largest segment at $374 billion, saw fluctuations influenced by economic conditions and personal income levels.\n\nCorporate giving also showed resilience, closely tied to GDP growth and corporate profits, although it did not keep pace with inflation-adjusted terms. Among the nine sub-sectors of charitable recipients, seven sectors experienced growth even after adjusting for inflation, with notable increases in areas linked to stock market performance and high-net-worth giving.\n\nLooking back at multi-year trends, the data indicated that charitable giving in 2023 surpassed pre-pandemic levels, reflecting ongoing support despite global uncertainties. The episode underscored the importance of strategic fundraising planning based on these insights, emphasizing the role of Giving USA data in guiding nonprofit strategies for donor engagement and sustainability.\n\nPersonalizing Donors Relationship with Angelica Suarez-Trujillo\n\nJune 24 | 0:14:28 In this episode of the First Day Podcast, host Bill Stanczykiewicz, Ed.D. is joined by Angelica Suarez-Trujillo, a seasoned advisor at Resilia specializing in nonprofit capacity building.

She emphasizes the importance of genuine human connections amidst the distractions and fast-paced nature of modern nonprofit work, drawing from her extensive experience in both coaching nonprofits and leading fundraising efforts herself.\n\nAngelica underscores the common pitfalls nonprofits face in prioritizing tasks over relationships, highlighting her own past mistakes and those she's observed in her coaching role. She advocates for fundraisers to start by understanding themselves and their attitudes towards relationships and money, suggesting introspective exercises to overcome barriers to effective donor engagement. Angelica shares practical strategies for fostering meaningful connections, such as active listening, personalizing interactions based on donor interests, and demonstrating genuine appreciation beyond financial contributions. She encourages fundraisers to balance organizational goals with the quality of donor relationships, navigating pressures for quick results by staying true to core values of stewardship and genuine connection.\n\nWhat Do Nonprofit Fundraisers Need to Know About AI with Karen Boyd, Ph.D.\n\nJune 17 | 0:22:15 In this episode of the First Day Podcast, host Bill Stanczykiewicz, Ed.D. is joined by Karen Boyd, Ph.D., Economist and Director of Research at the Policy and Innovation Center, and discuss the evolving intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and fundraising. She highlights the rapid advancements in AI technologies, emphasizing their potential to augment rather than replace human fundraisers. Addressing concerns around AI's capabilities and limitations, Boyd stresses the importance of understanding that AI tools are built on human-generated data, which inherently carries biases. She advocates for ethical use, urging fundraisers to leverage AI for tasks like initial draft writing and data analysis, thus freeing up time for more personalized donor interactions.\n\nBoyd underscores the concept of \"moral imagination\" as crucial in philanthropy, distinguishing human abilities from AI's computational processes.

Stanczykiewicz begins by dissecting the oft-cited statistic that only 50% of households make charitable donations, suggesting that this figure may not accurately reflect the willingness of individuals to give. He challenges fundraisers to adopt a more inclusive approach, emphasizing the importance of reaching out to donors across all economic strata and recognizing the generosity of donors regardless of the size of their contributions.\n\nFurthermore, Stanczykiewicz explores alternative perspectives on household giving behavior, pointing to the phenomenon of \"bunching\" where donors strategically consolidate their contributions to maximize tax benefits. He highlights the significant increase in donor-advised funds as another factor influencing charitable giving patterns. Despite varying survey results, which paint a nuanced picture of giving rates, Stanczykiewicz urges fundraisers to maintain a growth mindset, emphasizing the potential for impactful fundraising efforts to inspire generosity.

Dr. Rooney shares insights from decades of research, revealing that presidential campaign contributions have a negligible effect on overall philanthropic donations. Despite record amounts spent on elections, these contributions remain a small fraction of total household giving, and people typically separate political donations from their charitable contributions.\n\nDr. Rooney also addresses the effects of natural and man-made disasters on charitable giving. While such events often lead to a temporary increase in donations, this surge usually lasts only a few months and does not significantly impact long-term giving trends. He emphasizes that philanthropy is a core American value that persists through economic cycles and personal financial disruptions. Even during major economic downturns, like the Great Recession, charitable donations decrease but do not disappear, reflecting the resilience of philanthropic behavior.\n\nThe episode concludes with a discussion on the importance of fundraisers maintaining an abundance mentality. Dr. Rooney encourages fundraisers to focus on building long-term donor relationships and to seize opportunities to engage donors, even during election years or in response to disasters.

They are emerging as significant donors, surpassing Generation X in charitable giving per household.\n\nOne key indicator of Millennials' growing influence is their increasing homeownership rates, signaling stability and potential for increased charitable contributions. Surprisingly, Millennials also show a preference for traditional fundraising methods, particularly direct mail, amidst the digital age.\n\nFurthermore, research highlights Millennials' inclination towards cause-driven and relational giving, emphasizing hands-on involvement and impact in philanthropy. They seek meaningful engagement and are eager to contribute their expertise and resources to charitable causes.\n\nThe podcast emphasizes the importance of recognizing and engaging Millennials as prospective donors, challenging outdated perceptions, and tapping into their philanthropic potential.

The Foundation under Kaplan’s leadership, utilized collaboration as a key mechanism to expand its influence and effectiveness in serving the community.\n\nKaplan elaborates on the Foundation’s strategic approach to broaden its reach and impact through active collaborations across Alaska and beyond. By initiating the \"educational tour of Alaska for grantmakers,\" the Foundation not only showcased the unique challenges faced by the Alaskan communities but also successfully attracted substantial external funding. This innovative approach resulted in over $400 million in contributions aimed at addressing local needs, demonstrating the significant potential of well-orchestrated partnerships in philanthropy.\n\nHighlighting the lessons learned through these collaborations, Kaplan stresses the importance of having all parties involved contribute and learn from the philanthropic process.

Their innovative approach is centered around training leaders to conduct their own donor interviews, thus maintaining transparency and strengthening donor relationships, a stark contrast to conventional consultant-led interviews where a third-party intermediary might inhibit open communication.\n\nDuring the discussion, concerns about donor candidness in the presence of nonprofit representatives were addressed. Contrary to the worry that donors might withhold true opinions, Amy and Steven argued that direct interactions actually enhance dialogue authenticity and effectiveness. They asserted that familiar faces can elicit more genuine and detailed feedback, which is vital for the success of any campaign. This method not only builds trust but also fortifies long-term donor relationships; pivotal for ongoing support.\n\nThe podcast also looked into recent empirical research conducted by Capital Campaign Pro, which underscores the effectiveness of their methods. The study indicated a high success rate of 96% for campaigns utilizing their model, with the majority of these campaigns not negatively impacting the organizations’ annual funds. Interestingly, the data revealed that campaigns are equally successful regardless of the organization's size, encouraging smaller nonprofits that they too can achieve significant fundraising goals. This insight is particularly impactful, demonstrating that strategic, direct engagement and tailored support can empower all nonprofits to successfully navigate the complex landscape of capital campaigns.\n\nDonor Advised Funds: The Latest Data with Danielle Vance-McMullen, Ph.D., and Dan Heist, Ph.D.\n\nApril 29 | 0:17:04 In this episode of the First Day Podcast, host Bill Stanczykiewicz, Ed.D. is joined by Danielle Vance-McMullen, Ph.D., Assistant Professor at DePaul University and Dan Heist, Ph.D., Assistant Professor at Brigham Young University shared key findings from their extensive research on Donor Advised Funds (DAFs).

These grants support various charitable causes, with a significant portion being unrestricted, allowing for flexibility in addressing community needs. Additionally, the study revealed that most DAFs have succession plans in place, ensuring continued charitable impact even after the original donor's passing.\n\nOverall, the episode provides valuable insights into the behavior of DAF donors and emphasizes the importance of understanding the evolving landscape of philanthropy. The findings underscored the diverse motivations driving charitable giving and the role of DAFs in facilitating impactful grant-making to support communities and causes.\n\nPlanned Gift Fundraising: Busting the Myths with Christy Boysen, MA, CFRM, FCEP\n\nApril 22 | 0:18:24 In this episode of the First Day Podcast, host Bill Stanczykiewicz, Ed.D. is joined by Christy Boysen, MA, CFRM, FCEP, the founding CEO of Apex Legacy Consulting, who has extensive experience in advising nonprofits on planned gifts. Boysen emphasized that while planned giving, such as setting up charitable remainder trusts, appears complex due to its involvement of various professionals like lawyers and financial advisors, the process can be simplified through collaborative efforts. She highlighted the benefits of planned giving not only for the donors, who can make significant tax-efficient contributions, but also for their families and the charities they choose to support.\n\nThroughout the discussion, the need for education and engagement in planned giving was stressed as essential for overcoming the common reluctance among fundraisers. Boysen suggested that fundraisers should be proactive in learning about different planned giving vehicles and engage with donors through open-ended questions that align with their values and interests. This approach helps in uncovering opportunities for planned gifts, which are often overlooked due to the myths surrounding their complexity and the upfront effort required to understand and manage them.\n\nLastly, the podcast addressed the strategic importance of incorporating planned giving into overall fundraising efforts. Boysen argued that by educating both staff and donors about the simpler forms of planned giving, such as including a nonprofit as a beneficiary in wills or insurance policies, organizations can expand their support base significantly. The episode concluded with a call to action for fundraisers to adopt a more comprehensive and inclusive approach to fundraising, recognizing the potential of every donor to contribute through planned gifts, thus ensuring the financial sustainability and growth of their organizations.\n\nDonor Stewardship After the Event with Jamila Trimuel\n\nApril 15 | 0:20:06 In this episode of the First Day Podcast, host Bill Stanczykiewicz, Ed.D. is joined by Jamila Trimuel, Founder and CEO of Ladies of Virtue, an organization dedicated to empowering young girls in Chicago.

He highlights a significant finding: engagement in nonprofits can positively impact life expectancy, underscoring the personal benefits donors derive from their involvement.

Through his insights, he reveals the complexity of human behavior, emphasizing the role of social comparisons and the desire to maintain status within social groups as key drivers of charitable giving.\n\nMoreover, Fulton addresses the pressing issue of income inequality and its implications for fundraising efforts. He notes a concerning trend where lower-income individuals, despite potentially having a higher propensity to give, may feel economically marginalized and less inclined to donate. This insight underscores the importance of inclusive fundraising strategies that reach donors across all income levels. Fulton advocates for approaches like peer-to-peer fundraising, which not only engage donors but also provide opportunities for them to connect with the organization's mission on a personal level, thus fostering long-term relationships.\n\nLastly, Fulton emphasizes the need for fundraisers to shift their focus from immediate returns on investment (ROI) to the long-term value of donors. He argues that while ROI is relevant in the for-profit world, the nonprofit sector should prioritize cultivating lasting donor relationships. By adopting a holistic view of fundraising that emphasizes lifetime donor value, organizations can ensure sustained support and engagement from donors, thereby fulfilling their mission more effectively.

While emphasizing the importance of fostering strong donor relationships, the discussion highlights the significant influence of economic indicators, such as wealth metrics and personal income levels, on shaping charitable contributions.\n\nThe study forecasts a 4% growth in total charitable giving for both 2024 and 2025, adjusting for inflation, indicating stability in the philanthropic landscape despite recent economic fluctuations. Notably, foundations are expected to experience robust growth, driven by the expansion of their asset bases. Projections suggest a substantial increase in foundation grants by 10% in 2024 and 5% in 2025, underscoring their pivotal role in driving philanthropy forward.\n\nConversely, individual giving is anticipated to grow at a slower pace of around 3% annually, reflecting broader economic trends such as wage growth and income disparities. Corporate giving is also expected to rise, albeit at a more modest rate compared to foundations and individuals.\n\nThe episode emphasizes the importance of incorporating inflation into fundraising budgets to ensure nonprofits remain financially resilient amid an evolving economic landscape.

The experiment compared the impact of two main messaging strategies: a video showcasing the nonprofit's work and an email describing the hardships faced by its clients.\n\nResults revealed that the video message was significantly more effective in increasing donor connections, particularly among women, while the email's impact was negligible. Importantly, the study highlights the need for fundraisers to be mindful of unintentionally evoking negative feelings in their messaging, as this can undermine effectiveness. By understanding the emotional and moral responses of donors, fundraisers can design more impactful and engaging campaigns.\n\nOverall, the podcast underscores the importance of innovative approaches to donor engagement in the face of changing trends in charitable giving. By leveraging research-based insights and understanding donor behavior, fundraisers can adapt their strategies to effectively attract and retain donors, ultimately advancing the missions of nonprofit organizations in a challenging landscape.\n\nHigher Fundraising by Developing Community with Katrina VanHuss\n\nMarch 4 | 0:19:20 In this episode of the First Day Podcast, host Bill Stanczykiewicz, Ed.D. is joined by Katrina VanHuss, Founder and Partner at Turnkey. Katrina highlights the critical shift away from transactional donor interactions towards fostering genuine connections among donors themselves, emphasizing the need to move beyond one-way communication models.\n\nThe conversation underscores the common oversight in nonprofit strategies, where considerable resources are invested in communicating with donors but little attention is given to enabling donors to engage with each other. Katrina explains the profound impact of community-building efforts, which not only deepen donor engagement but also foster trust and loyalty towards the organization and its mission. Drawing on examples like Relay for Life, the episode illustrates how nurturing a sense of community among donors can lead to significant fundraising success and provide invaluable support to individuals facing personal challenges.\n\nThe episode advocates for a strategic shift in fundraising practices, urging fundraisers to integrate community-building initiatives into their strategic plans.

Jay emphasizes the necessity of prioritizing donor stewardship to improve retention rates. He suggests personalized approaches such as handwritten thank-you notes and phone calls, as well as involving board members in expressing gratitude to donors. Additionally, Jay stresses the significance of recognizing donors of all gift sizes, as major donors, although constituting a small percentage, provide the majority of funds. By implementing comprehensive stewardship strategies, organizations can build stronger relationships with donors and mitigate donor fatigue.\n\nThe episode highlights the nonprofit sector's deplorable state with an average retention rate of only 43-44%, significantly lower than what is required for commercial businesses to thrive. This discrepancy is attributed to various factors, including high turnover rates among fundraising professionals and a lack of expertise in donor nurturing among board members. Despite the immense importance of retaining donors, many organizations find themselves on a constant treadmill of seeking new donors rather than fostering relationships with existing ones.\n\nThe episode underscores the importance of treating donors as valued members of the nonprofit's family and acknowledges the need for consistent communication and recognition. Strategies such as segmenting donors and maintaining a communication plan are recommended to ensure that donors feel appreciated and engaged with the organization's mission. Ultimately, fostering a culture of gratitude and stewardship can lead to higher donor retention rates and sustained support for the nonprofit's initiatives.\n\nWhat are Donors Thinking with Erinn Andrews\n\nFebruary 19 | 0:17:38 In this episode of the First Day Podcast, host Bill Stanczykiewicz, Ed.D. is joined by Erinn Andrews, the founder and CEO of GiveTeam, a consulting firm specializing in philanthropic advising. Andrews identifies a crucial gap in the philanthropic advising profession, particularly in supporting donors in the top 2 to 10% bracket. While much attention is given to the top 1% of donors, those in the slightly lower bracket often lack tailored support despite their significant contributions. Recognizing this opportunity, Andrews established GiveTeam to cater to the needs of this segment and unlock their hidden generosity.\n\nAndrews explains GiveTeam's advising model, which focuses on guiding donors through a reflective process to develop a charitable mission statement aligned with their values. Additionally, the team assists in structuring financial strategies and presents nonprofit options based on donors' priorities. By addressing the challenges donors face in strategic giving, GiveTeam aims to empower them to make more informed and impactful philanthropic decisions.\n\nThe discussion emphasizes the importance of ongoing engagement and stewardship post-donation. Andrews underscores the need for nonprofits to maintain regular communication with donors, providing updates on how their contributions are making a difference. This approach not only fosters stronger donor relationships but also encourages continued support and potentially increased giving over time. Through thoughtful reflection, personalized advising, and effective stewardship, GiveTeam seeks to maximize the philanthropic impact of donors in the top 2 to 10% bracket.\n\nFundraising Campaigns: For the Right Reason with Gene Tempel, Ed.D.\n\nFebruary 12 | 0:23:02 In this episode of the First Day Podcast, host Bill Stanczykiewicz, Ed.D. is joined by Gene Tempel, Ed.D. to discuss the foundational aspects that drive the success of nonprofit fundraising efforts. Central to the discussion is the concept of the \"case for support,\" which underscores the necessity for nonprofits to articulate a clear and compelling rationale for their fundraising initiatives. This rationale is not just a narrative but a strategic alignment of the organization's mission with societal needs, serving as the cornerstone for both annual and capital campaigns. The emphasis is on the importance of this case for support, especially in capital campaigns, where the urgency and scope of fundraising are magnified to meet specific organizational expansions, such as new facilities or equipment, which directly address pressing societal needs.\n\nThe conversation broadens the understanding of capital campaigns, challenging the notion that they are exclusive to large entities like universities or hospitals. It is argued that capital campaigns are a viable strategy for nonprofits of all sizes, including local theaters and homeless shelters, all of which may require significant resources to expand their services or infrastructure. This inclusivity highlights the versatility of capital campaigns as a tool for organizational growth across the nonprofit sector. The dialogue underscores the importance of strategic vision in these endeavors, positing that a forward-looking perspective, one that promises an improvement over the present state, is critical in mobilizing donor support and achieving the campaign's objectives.\n\nThe podcast also addresses common pitfalls and misguided motivations that can derail fundraising campaigns, such as initiating a campaign based on envy or a perceived need to match the efforts of others without a solid case for support. Such motivations risk the credibility and effectiveness of the campaign, underscoring the need for a well-founded rationale rooted in the organization's mission and societal contributions. Moreover, the episode illuminates the broader impacts of successful campaigns, beyond financial achievements, highlighting how they can energize stakeholders, enhance the public image of the nonprofit, and lay a solid foundation for future growth and impact. This comprehensive discussion offers valuable insights into the strategic planning and execution of fundraising campaigns, emphasizing their critical role in enabling nonprofits to fulfill their missions and address societal needs effectively.\n\nFundraising When Leadership Changes with Gasby Brown\n\nFebruary 5 | 0:16:59 In this episode of the First Day Podcast, host Bill Stanczykiewicz, Ed.D. is joined by Gasby Brown.

The central theme is how to ensure a smooth transition and maintain fundraising efforts during leadership changes.\n\nGasby Brown emphasizes that succession planning should be a proactive and strategic process, not a reactive replacement of leaders. It involves identifying and nurturing potential leaders from within the organization, ensuring a strong bench of capable individuals who can step up when needed. Brown also stresses the importance of ethical practices, emphasizing that donors support the mission of the organization, not individual leaders. She recommends sharing donor information with the team and introducing them to donors during the transition to foster a sense of team spirit.\n\nInclusive leadership, where leaders involve their teams in decision-making and empower others, is highlighted as a key element in ensuring the organization's continuity and strength after a leader departs. The podcast underscores the ethical responsibility of leaders to develop successors and to focus on the greater mission of fundraising and philanthropy. Overall, it provides valuable insights into the importance of succession planning and maintaining donor relationships during leadership transitions in the nonprofit sector.\n\nHispanics and Philanthropy with Hilda Vega\n\nJanuary 29 | 0:15:57 In this episode of the First Day Podcast, host Bill Stanczykiewicz, Ed.D. is joined by Hilda Vega, Deputy Vice President, Philanthropic Practice. The organization, celebrating its 40th anniversary, commissioned a significant study through the Indiana University Lilly Family School of Philanthropy. The study, titled \"Latinx Philanthropy: Understanding Generosity Trends Across Latinx Communities in the United States,\" aimed to refresh and deepen the understanding of Latino donors' roles in philanthropy. This comprehensive study was designed to answer frequent questions about the philanthropic behaviors and challenges of Latinx communities and to contribute to the broader understanding of philanthropy's diversity and evolution.\n\nThe study brought to light several critical findings about Latinx philanthropy. It revealed that Latinx donors, like donors across the U.S., often give based on their values, family connections, and community needs. The research provided a unique blend of quantitative data and qualitative insights from focus groups, highlighting long-term trends in Latinx giving. Interestingly, it showed that Latinx giving mirrors broader U.S. trends, with a strong emphasis on family and community investment. However, the study also pointed out challenges, such as a decline in institutional trust and economic changes post-pandemic. Notably, the role of peer-to-peer giving, mutual aid, and remittances were underscored as significant aspects of Latinx philanthropy, with remittances playing a vital role in supporting entire communities in the donors' countries of origin.\n\nThe episode also looked into the implications of these findings for fundraisers and the importance of inclusivity in philanthropic efforts. As the Latinx population continues to grow and diversify within the U.S., understanding these trends is crucial for fundraisers, particularly those from different ethnic backgrounds. The study highlights the necessity for fundraisers to build genuine relationships with donors, understand their interests, and include Latinx communities in their efforts. The research indicates that as Latinx individuals establish themselves longer in the U.S., their capacity to donate increases. This generational and residency duration factor is essential for understanding donor behavior. The episode concludes with a call for more inclusive fundraising practices that recognize the unique and evolving role of Latinx donors in philanthropy.\n\nStorytelling for Diverse Fundraising with Nikole Collins-Puri\n\nJanuary 22 | 0:21:26 In this episode of the First Day Podcast, host Bill Stanczykiewicz, Ed.D. is joined by Nikole Collins-Puri, former CEO and current adviser to Techbridge Girls, to discuss the pivotal role of storytelling in the realm of fundraising. Nikole, recognized as a leader in the philanthropic sector, provides insight into Techbridge Girls, a nonprofit with a 25-year history, dedicated to empowering black and brown girls in STEM education. The episode emphasizes while facts and numbers have their place in conveying impact, storytelling is equally vital for advancing an organization's mission, amplifying its message, and securing the resources needed to bring about societal transformation.\n\nNikole elaborates on Techbridge Girls' deliberate approach to collecting and organizing stories in a systematic \"story bank\" that includes categorization with keywords. This enables them to retrieve and share compelling stories tailored to different audiences, including donors, partners, and educators, to reinforce specific messages and goals. The organization's strategy involves training its entire staff to contribute to the story bank, ensuring that stories are gathered from various sources and channels. The podcast sheds light on the pragmatic use of Dropbox for this purpose, dispelling the notion that sophisticated, expensive tools are necessary for effective storytelling in nonprofits.\n\nNikole highlights an equity issue in the nonprofit sector, emphasizing that stories hold cultural significance and offer a more inclusive perspective on impact, particularly in communities of color. She advocates for a broader recognition of storytelling alongside quantitative data as a valid and meaningful way to measure impact. Her advice to nonprofits seeking to establish their own story bank is refreshingly straightforward: don't overthink it; stories are everywhere, and it's crucial to capture them in whatever way possible to share the transformative work being done.\n\nThis podcast episode not only underscores the importance of storytelling in fundraising but also provides practical insights on how nonprofits can implement a storytelling strategy to advance their missions and foster engagement with their supporters.\n\nKPIs and other Measurement Metrics for Fundraisers with Muhi Khwaja, MPA, CFRE, CFRM\n\nJanuary 15 | 0:13:12 In this episode of the First Day Podcast, host Bill Stanczykiewicz, Ed.D. is joined by Muhi Khwaja, MPA, CFRE, CFRM, co-founder of the American Muslim Community Foundation (AMCF), discusses the organization's role and growth since its inception in 2017.

The Foundation's unique approach integrates Islamic charitable practices, like zakat, with modern philanthropy, thereby aligning donors' faith with their philanthropic endeavors.\n\nThe episode emphasizes the crucial role of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in assessing and enhancing fundraising effectiveness. KPIs serve as vital tools for predicting future performance and evaluating past results. Specific metrics like year-over-year donor retention are highlighted, showcasing their importance in setting accurate and informed fundraising goals. The conversation underscores the necessity for organizations to strike a balance between tracking these metrics and maintaining strong, personal donor relationships, a challenge that is often faced in the nonprofit sector.\n\nAddressing nonprofits at various stages of development, the episode provides practical guidance on setting up systems to track KPIs. For organizations with adequate resources, investing in Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems is recommended to efficiently manage donor data and fundraising activities. For those with limited budgets, simpler methods such as Excel spreadsheets are suggested. The key is to focus on essential metrics like cost per dollar raised and fundraising return on investment, ensuring a strategic and data-driven approach to donor management and fundraising activities.\n\nFundraising for the New Year with Bill Stanczykiewicz, Ed.D.\n\nJanuary 8 | 0:11:23 In this episode of the First Day Podcast, host Bill Stanczykiewicz, Ed.D., shares his thoughts on fundraising prospects for 2024.

Additionally, Stanczykiewicz touches on the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in fundraising, as it continues to evolve rapidly, helping automate various operational tasks and allowing fundraisers more time to engage with donors. Lastly, the episode highlights the historical trend that charitable giving tends to increase during presidential election years, dispelling concerns that political campaign donations might negatively impact charitable contributions.\n\nListeners can benefit from Stanczykiewicz's deep insights into the economic landscape and its implications for fundraising in 2024, along with valuable advice on maintaining strong donor relationships and leveraging AI for more efficient fundraising efforts.\n\nFundraising During Challenging Times (first aired January 9, 2023) with Elizabeth A.M.

The discussion centers on the multifaceted motives that drive individuals to contribute to charitable causes. Mark identifies two primary categories of motives: collective motives, where people engage in philanthropy to create a collective product for the greater good, and private benefit motives, which encompass personal feelings of duty, satisfaction, or self-improvement. This categorization underscores the importance of recognizing the unique motivations of donors.\n\nThe conversation looks at the dynamic nature of charitable giving, challenging the notion of a static donor base. Mark emphasizes that donor behaviors can change over time, and fundraisers should focus on transitioning occasional donors into regular contributors. He likens fundraising to a dynamic motion picture, urging fundraisers to adapt to evolving donor motives and behaviors.\n\nTo effectively engage donors, the podcast suggests a personalized approach.

They recognize the evolving nature of faith and giving, with many religious institutions rethinking how they utilize their resources, including property and endowments. To address this, they have launched the \"Story Shelf,\" an online resource library containing stories of faith communities reimagining their resources, forging new partnerships, and engaging in creative acts of generosity. These stories serve as inspirational tools for religious leaders to spark imagination and foster discussions on how they can align their resources with their values.\n\nThe podcast also touches on various stories available on the Story Shelf, such as a Lutheran congregation in Washington, D.C., partnering with a Jewish congregation to share their space and an Episcopal Church in Cincinnati using part of its endowment to support local social entrepreneurs.

The episode looks at a study aimed at mapping nonprofit spending on climate change in the United States. This research seeks to understand the amount of money U.S.-based nonprofits are allocating towards climate change initiatives, dividing these efforts into two primary categories: mitigation, which focuses on preventing the impacts of climate change, and adaptation, which involves adapting to its effects. The primary purpose of the study is to establish a baseline for understanding which efforts receive the most attention and funding, aiding fundraisers, funders, and policymakers in directing resources effectively.\n\nThe methodology of the study involved a survey of 130 U.S. nonprofit organizations of various sizes and budgets, ranging from under $500,000 to over $20 million. These organizations were selected to represent a broader spectrum of about 3,200 U.S.-based nonprofits partly or wholly involved in climate change or environmental work. The survey data was weighted against this larger sample to ensure representativeness. The sample included not only environmental nonprofits but also organizations from other sectors like education and arts, which have programs related to the environment or climate change. This comprehensive approach underscores the interconnected nature of different sectors in addressing climate issues.\n\nThe study's findings reveal significant insights into nonprofit spending on climate change. It estimates that U.S. nonprofit organizations spend between $7.8 and $9.2 billion annually on climate change-related programs and activities, with philanthropic sources contributing approximately 88% of this funding. The breakdown of climate expenditure shows that about 49% is spent on mitigation activities, 14% on adaptation, and 15% regranted to other organizations. An interesting aspect highlighted is the reliance of the climate change sector on philanthropic funding, which is significantly higher than in other sectors of U.S. nonprofits. Additionally, the study identified a funding gap in certain tactics, with policy-based approaches being the most utilized yet also the most in need of additional funding. This comprehensive analysis provides a valuable baseline for understanding and enhancing philanthropic efforts in combating climate change.\n\nBusiness Sector Fundraising with Dwight F.

Four primary models were highlighted: corporate responsibility, ethical and altruistic, political, and stakeholder. The corporate responsibility model underscores a company's societal obligations, linking its community contributions to its core mission of profitability. The ethical and altruistic model debates the true nature of altruism in corporate giving, focusing on community well-being. The political model explores corporate giving as a means to gain political advantage, either internally within the company or externally. Lastly, the stakeholder model, which has gained popularity over the last three decades, emphasizes the importance of considering all stakeholders of a company, including customers, vendors, and employees, and how these relationships intertwine with the company's overall business strategy.\n\nThe discussion also ventured into the practical realm, addressing how nonprofits can effectively approach and engage with the business sector for fundraising. Emphasizing the alignment of nonprofit missions with corporate philanthropic values, the podcast underlined the importance of developing a strategic fundraising plan that caters specifically to the business sector.
