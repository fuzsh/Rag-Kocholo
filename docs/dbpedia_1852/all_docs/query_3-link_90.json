        "text": "How would you use your words if you only had a few to share each day? It‚Äôs questions like this one that my brother Vikram and so many #nonspeakers face every day. Imagine having an active mind that understands and memorizes everything, yet you cannot speak - you cannot tell the people around you what you think or how you feel for 27 years üò≤ We don‚Äôt talk enough about how human adversity can also forge incredible resilience. Sometimes our greatest challenges reveal our true potential. ‚ö°Ô∏è It‚Äôs ironic - while the world pitied him for his inability to speak, Vikram's profound use of language became his defining asset. Today, he shares his poetry at events like the Glass House Festival in Bangalore, giving this speech using #AAC #technology. ‚å®Ô∏è He‚Äôs also working on a book titled: ‚ÄúWhile I might not speak, I have a lot to say‚Äù. Now if the world was relentlessly focused on uncovering talents? If every one of us is asking these questions üëÜ, chances are, the answer is more likely to reveal itself. It‚Äôs important for us to talk about that because had the world begun asking those questions sooner in Vikram‚Äôs life, it may have changed everything. As you turn 32 this month Vikram, know that your journey has been a true testament to the human spirit. This month, let‚Äôs move from #autismacceptance to #autismempowerment üöÄ While acceptance focuses on no longer dismissing people due to their challenges, let‚Äôs focus on trying to #uncoverstrengths through empowerment. Share this post and spread the word - let‚Äôs make a difference. üí™\n\nREQUEST FOR 15 MINUTES HELP FROM MY NETWORK. SEE BELOW ON HOW YOU WILL BENEFIT. EVERYTHING I DO IS WIN-WIN. IF YOU KNOW ME, YOU'LL KNOW THAT'S A GIVEN! I need as many people as possible, as quickly as possible, to reach out, who have an interest or level of curiosity around the following areas - across both personal and/or professional dimensions: * Empathy, Rapport and building instant Trust - a better understanding of, and an upskilling in these areas. * Human Connection and ways of increasing/deepening it for better relationship-building. * Familiarity with the vibrational or energetic element of communication, or curious about what that is, and how it could benefit them. * Intuition from a non-mystical perspective - we are talking a grounded, well-rounded approach that supports you in areas such as decision making, creativity, complex problem solving and relationship-building. * Spiritual Intelligence. An understanding or sense that this is a component of who we are and should be integrated into what we do at home and work. I'm NOT talking about anything affiliated with religion. This is work done by #Zohar #thinkers50 who did Physics and Philosophy at MIT and postgrad work in Philosophy, Religion & Psychology at Harvard. * Personal development - emphasis on productivity, focus, developing closer relationships, personal effectiveness, creative output, better communication. I am an expert in these areas, spanning 35 years of research and daily experience and application, and have taught them to over 17,000 clients. I will have a recorded conversation with you, where you can learn about these areas for your benefit (and take advantage of my extensive knowledge and experience) or use my prepared questions as prompts. This is to support the current research and development of my emerging course. Please forgive me for tagging, it's not something I do often, but it's URGENT.\n\nüíú At the heart of a Silent Journey event lies the introductory circle ‚Äì a pivotal component that invites parents to immerse themselves in their own childhood memories. This intentional journey serves not merely as an icebreaker but as a meditative practice, creating an atmosphere of comfort and ease. Some parents may find themselves unexpectedly moved to tears, while others experience a heightened sensitivity. Once, amid the circle, a mother, fluent in English, chose to express her childhood memories in Chinese. She explained this by the fact that she can best convey her memories in her native language, because when she was 3 or 4 years old, she did not yet know any other languages. During our most recent Silent Journey at the UES campus, we encountered parents who were initially unfamiliar with one another. Because of that, they were not necessarily relaxed and open to an experience. Knowing this, we departed from the usual routine and turned off all the lights, illuminating the space with candles, in advance instead of doing it in the process. This simple yet symbolic gesture set the stage for a meditation, gently guiding these apprehensive parents into a tranquil state üßò‚ôÄÔ∏è Ask your parents to close their eyes, take deep breaths and take this journey into the past, sharing a memory from the age of their children. After that, they will be more open to having sincere conversations, giving you insights and even participating in a music circle :) In the next post, we'll share how to collect feedback effectively once your event is over! #hopscotchhub #leadership #education #montessorieducation #business #entrepreneurship\n\nLovely piece from #SethGodin today on the absence of proof which is well worth a read. With a masters in Philosophy, Rhetoric & Religion (specialising in the establishment of orthodoxy & heresy in the late antique era) I love these sorts of articles. The discussion about the significance of belief in human life, its historical & evolving role, & the interplay between belief and proof is always fascinating! Questions & reflections I've had on this so far üü° Seth mentions instances where experts resist new research that challenges their beliefs. Why do people sometimes hold onto beliefs despite contradictory evidence? ‚û° My experience in #StrategicTransformation and #CultureChange tells me people often develop deep attachments to their beliefs because these beliefs might be intertwined with their identities, experiences & social groups they belong to. Challenging long-held beliefs can be uncomfortable & may require reevaluating one's self-concept or expertise. üü° With the increasing availability of information & evidence, how can individuals ensure they are making informed choices without dismissing the value of belief? ‚û° By seeking diverse perspectives, staying open to new evidence, & recognising the emotional & personal aspects of belief, individuals can strike a balance between informed decision-making & valuing belief. üü° The passage suggests that as proof emerges in certain areas, belief can be redirected to other aspects of life. Where does belief continues to play a crucial role for me? ‚û° In my creative pursuits - writing & painting - belief in my capabilities & the power of self-expression is pivotal. This belief fuels my motivation & helps me overcome self-doubt, even when immediate external proof isn't evident. Who needs likes & shares anyway right? üòÉ üü° How do you navigate conversations with others who hold strong beliefs that seem to contradict established evidence or facts? ‚û° I try to approach with curiosity to explore their reasoning & experiences rather than challenging head-on. I also accept sometimes you just have to agree to disagree! üü° How can society encourage a healthy balance between openness to evidence & the importance of personal belief? ‚û° Society can promote education that emphasises critical thinking, helping individuals distinguish between evidence-based decisions & matters of belief. Encouraging respectful discourse & understanding differing perspectives can also foster a culture where people feel comfortable discussing their beliefs while being receptive to new information. I believe these \"soft skills\" are going to be evermore important as the pace of change accelerates in the digital age & we become more dependent on #AI Would be keen to hear your thoughts on Seth's piece. I do love that final sense \"Belief needs proof like fish need a bicycle\" What a way with words! #Diversity #Inclusion #LeadershipDevelopment #LearningAndDevelopment #EmWilson\n\nExcited to Share My TEDX Talk on Neurodivergence, hosted by University of the Pacific, on a topic very close to my heart‚Äîneurodiversity. This presentation is a pivotal moment in my journey, enabling me to express my perspectives and illuminate the dynamic complexities of neurodivergent brains. As a Black woman, this conversation holds profound significance for me. Numerous underfunded communities encounter substantial obstacles in obtaining diagnoses and accessing resources for my fellow neurospicy family to reach full potential. This challenge is both personal and widespread, necessitating empathy and understanding. I‚Äôve aimed to uncover these challenges while also celebrating the extraordinary capabilities within the neurodivergent community. It's an exploration not just of the hurdles but of the strengths, creativity, and innovativeness that neurodiverse individuals contribute to our world. The time has come to dismantle the stigmas and negative perceptions surrounding neurodiversity. By sharing on this platform, I hope to contribute to a broader understanding and appreciation for the diverse intricacies of the human mind. Progress beyond stereotypes and assist each other in recognizing and leveraging the unique talents and perspectives associated with neurodivergence. My deepest gratitude to TEDxUoPacific DISRUPT for providing a platform to bring this important conversation to a worldwide audience. My talk is more than a personal narrative; it is a call to action. By inviting you to engage with and share this message, this influential platform can initiate discussions, promote education, and establish opportunities that celebrate neurodiversity. Amplify messaging and instigate the transformation we aim to achieve in the world. If you are passionate about neurodiversity, education, and fostering inclusive communities, I would love to have a conversation with you. By working together, we can strive for a more understanding and inclusive world.\n\nGanesh Chaturthi is very close to my heart. Every year I eagerly wait for this festival. While this festival is close to my heart, there are many things I look up to as I resonate with the qualities of Lord Ganesha. Here are 5 key aspects that resonate deeply with me: 1. Wisdom: Lord Ganesha's wisdom is an inspiration. It reminds me of the importance of continuous learning and seeking knowledge in both personal and professional life. 2. Better Listening: The elephant-headed deity's large ears symbolize the art of listening attentively. I believe that being a better listener fosters stronger relationships and effective communication. 3. Problem Solving: Ganesha's ability to overcome obstacles, represented when the learned sage Vyasa was dictating Mahabharata to Lord Ganesh, his pen broke but so broke his tusk and continued to write without stopping. It teaches us resilience and creative problem-solving. It's a valuable lesson for navigating life's challenges. 4. Art: Lord Ganesha's association with art and creativity reminds us of the beauty in self-expression. Embracing creativity can enhance innovation and enrich our lives. 5. Valuing Your Strengths: His unique form, combining both human and animal attributes, illustrates the importance of recognizing and embracing our individual strengths and differences. Let's celebrate these qualities of Lord Ganesha not just during this festival but throughout our journey in life. What aspects of Ganesh Chaturthi resonate with you, and how do they inspire your personal and professional growth? #GaneshChaturthi #Inspiration\n\nIs anyone familiar with this Zen Parable? Two men come to visit a Zen teacher to inquire about moving to his village. The first man enters and says, \"I am thinking of moving to this village, how is it here?\" The teacher replies, \"Well, how is your current village?\" The man responds, \"It‚Äôs terrible, I hate it there.\" The Zen teacher answers, \"This village is the same, you won‚Äôt like it.\" The second man enters and says, \"I am thinking of moving to this village, how is it here?\" The teacher replies, \"Well, how is your current village?\" The man responds, \"It‚Äôs wonderful, I love it there.\" The Zen teacher answers, \"This village is the same, you will like it.\" The lesson: Our internal reality creates our external reality. If you want a beautiful, fulfilling external world, first turn inward and create a beautiful, fulfilling internal world. In Kevin Kelly‚Äôs latest advice column, he stated simply: \"To clean up your city, sweep your doorstep first.\" Thank you, Sahil Bloom for sharing these this week in your Curiosity Chronicles üôè We can take this principle into any organization we are a part of, even our relationships within our family. Let's start with us. Our mindset, our attitude, our responsibility. And let's watch the world blossom beautifully around us! TruPotential Group #leadershipdevelopment #corporatetraining\n\nDear African youth, I have been thinking back on how I started from Techimantia in Ghana to Canada. üá®üá¶ I would be starting an initiative geared towards becoming a strong force that drives change for the youths in the world. Although I had some difficult and unpleasant experiences in my childhood, I also emulated some practical wisdom and affection from my parents and those I grew up with in my community. I treasure those memories of failures, rejections, and setbacks since they were essential to my development and maturity as a person. I developed perseverance, discipline, and strategic relationships and acquired important life skills and understanding through setbacks and victories. These encounters are where I discovered the foundation of my life. I welcome the uncertainty that comes with starting a new chapter and am excited about the possibilities and difficulties that lie ahead. It matters more how I plan to use my degree to create a significant impact, and challenge people to think twice than merely what degree I possess. The foundation of my education in North America is to discover new things, develop, and keep making a positive impact, shaping and re-engineering the mindset of the youth around the world. Key tips for you. Things I have learned so far. 1. Time is not waiting for you. Until you start using your brains, you will be a slave and will never become valuable. 2. You can't do it alone, you need people in your life. One call from a person can change your entire life, learn to humble yourself. 3. Sometimes, develop the habit of being patience. Don't rush, allow life to teach you wisdom. Patience will help you to pass through the thorns of life. Keep refining yourself. Change your housing that covers your life like you do your mobile phones. 4. Your ideas are valid. Don't allow what people will say about you to cage your potential. Your impact counts, don't box yourself. 5. Be a nice person. Laugh and be polite. It paves the way for opportunities. 6. Jealousy can kill your vision. Be proud of others and keep clapping for others until it is your turn. 7. Never stop trying, you fail, fail again. Until the world sees your input, never stop. Peter Bawuah Inspirational speaker."
