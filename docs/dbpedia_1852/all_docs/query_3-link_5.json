        "text": "Introduction\n\nBipolar disorder (BD) is a clinically severe, episodic, lifelong mood disorder (Fagiolini et al., 2013). This disorder is associated with cognitive, behavioral, psychosocial, and functional impairment (Carvalho et al., 2020), reduced life expectancy, and higher risk of suicidal attempts (Anderson et al., 2012). According to the DSM-5, patients with BD experience mood states and energy swings between depression and emotional highs, which vary from manic to hypomanic episodes in BD type I (BD-I) or type II (BD-II), respectively (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).\n\nAlthough the etiology of BD is largely unknown, some factors have been linked to the onset of this disorder. The heritability of BD ranges between 70 and 90% (Gordovez & McMahon, 2020) and it is hypothesized to follow mainly a common disease/common variant model with several genes, each with a small effect explaining the risk (Sullivan et al., 2012). Some of the risk genes, including CACNA1C, CHRNA7, TCF7L2, NCAN, FGF-2, and MAPK1, belong to pathways involved in neurodevelopment, neurodegeneration, neuroplasticity, and normal brain function in BD (Bem et al., 2019; Calabrò et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2018). Among them, previous evidence have highlighted the crucial role of Wnt signaling pathways underlying the pathogenesis of mood disorders, specifically for BD (Miola et al., 2022a; Sani et al., 2012), with one of its key enzymes, glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta, which regulates synaptic plasticity, cell survival, and circadian rhythms, involved in the pathophysiology and treatment of BD (Dandekar et al., 2018; Muneer, 2017). Furthermore, the Wnt pathway has also been reported as a regulator of crucial processes in the development of the mammalian nervous system and cortical gyrification (Chizhikov et al., 2019).\n\nSeveral studies have shown that BD could be associated with neurodevelopmental alterations (Fornito et al., 2007; Sanches et al., 2008). Such variations, combined with unfavorable postnatal environmental factors during childhood and adolescence (Bortolato et al., 2017; O’Shea & McInnis, 2016) may lead to an early onset of BD with the first episode usually occurring around the age of 20 years (Carvalho et al., 2020). Indeed, adolescents who will develop BD may already show prodromal cognitive symptoms (Olvet et al., 2013), such as soft neurological symptoms (Mrad et al., 2016), which may be due to a deviation from the regular development trajectory. These changes are found more frequently in patients with early-onset BD (< 18 years) or BD with psychotic symptoms (Arango et al., 2014; Sigurdsson et al., 1999) that have had neurodevelopmental insults during fetal and early postnatal life (Canetta et al., 2014; Hozer & Houenou, 2016).\n\nGyrification is the process of brain remodeling of surface morphology to create sulci and gyri, thus expanding the cortical surface area (White et al., 2010). Cortical folding starts between 10 and 15 weeks of intrauterine life, reaches its peak during the third trimester of pregnancy (Sasabayashi et al., 2021), and continues until early infancy when it starts decreasing (White et al., 2010). Abnormalities of gyrification and of its trajectory are often associated with major psychiatric disorders, thus suggesting a role of aberrant neurodevelopment (Sasabayashi et al., 2021). Indeed, patients with psychiatric disorders may exhibit atypical primary gyri formation under neurodevelopmental genetic control in their fetal life and infancy, and then display higher-order gyral changes that are mainly due to mechanical stress derived from active brain changes rather than genetic load (Sasabayashi et al., 2021). Three hypotheses have been proposed to explain the gyrification process: The axons drawing highly interconnected regions of gray matter may cause tangential force components contributing to developing cortical folds (Essen, 1997); Reaction–diffusion mechanisms involving morphogens may cause a differential growth of sulci and gyri (Lefèvre & Mangin, 2010); Surface shell growing more than subcortical layers may result in a mechanical buckling that shapes the cortex (Toro & Burnod, 2005).\n\nThus, the gyrification index (GI), defined as the ratio between the perimeters of the pial and outer hull from structural T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images (Zilles et al., 1988) could be particularly relevant for the analysis of the neurobiological changes underlying BD. GI can reflect both early alterations in neurodevelopmental trajectories and neuroprogression processes due to disorder-related mechanisms. Contrary to volume-based measures, which can be greatly influenced by the effects of age, illness process, and by the exposure to psychotropic treatment, cortical GI appears to be a more stable marker of neurodevelopment over time (Sasabayashi et al., 2021). The GI is generally computed on a slice-by-slice basis from a coronal projection in a two-dimensional space similarly to the approach used to calculate this index for post-mortem brains (Zilles et al., 1988). Since this approach could produce biased estimates in the case of slice orientation differences, three-dimensional surface-based or curvature-based measurements (3D-GI) have been proposed (Magnotta et al., 1999; Toro et al., 2008). GI can be computed as a global measure, calculated as the mean GI across the whole brain, as well as a regional measure, the local GI (LGI) (Schaer et al., 2008).\n\nUnfortunately, previous studies employing this measure in BD revealed controversial results and the literature related to gyrification measures in this disorder has not been systematically evaluated so far. Therefore, this systematic review aimed to summarize available published MRI research reporting GI in patients with BD compared to healthy controls (HC) and/or other psychiatric groups.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this paper, we systematically examined all the existing literature on gyrification abnormalities in BD. In general, a heterogeneous picture of decreased, increased, or similar gyrification between BD and HC emerged. Seemingly, an increase or no differences in GI were observed in BD relative to SCZ or SZA, while relatives of BD showed lower or similar GI compared to healthy subjects without a family history of BD.\n\nRegarding the comparison between BD and HC, the results are mixed and heterogeneous. Some studies did not find abnormalities in cortical GI (Cao et al., 2017a; Drobinin et al., 2019; Janssen et al., 2014; Liao et al., 2008; Madre et al., 2020; Mirakhur et al., 2009; Nanda et al., 2014), while others reported significant regional differences (Choi et al., 2020; McIntosh et al., 2009; Nenadic et al., 2015; Palaniyappan & Liddle, 2014). Interestingly, from a topological point of view, the findings of altered gyrification are widespread. Indeed, reductions in GI were observed in the frontal (Choi et al., 2020; McIntosh et al., 2009; Palaniyappan & Liddle, 2014), parietal (Choi et al., 2020; Palaniyappan & Liddle, 2014), temporal (Choi et al., 2020) and occipital lobes (Palaniyappan & Liddle, 2014). Furthermore, an increased GI in BD was described in CC and DLPFC (Nenadic et al., 2015), temporal and OFG (Palaniyappan & Liddle, 2014), as well as in the left supramarginal gyrus and bilateral cuneus (Madre et al., 2020). These observations support the evidence that the pathogenesis of BD is characterized by an alteration of large anatomical and functional neural networks, which span across the default mode, the cognitive control, and the salience networks. Interestingly, changes in local gyrification have been suggested to represent an indirect sign of altered underlying connectivity in the corresponding areas, which in turn appears to be associated with changes in cognitive functioning and clinical symptoms (White & Hilgetag, 2011). In particular, our results showed a pattern of abnormalities in BD in areas encompassing the fronto-parietal cognitive control network, a brain circuit involved in several executive functions, including attention, planning, and working memory (Breukelaar et al., 2016). As deficits in these cognitive domains have been commonly reported in BD (Bora, 2018), we could hypothesize that abnormalities in gyrification could be involved in the development of cognitive alterations in BD. In addition, we also found differences in GI in areas included in the default mode and the salience networks, particularly in the precuneus, the ACC, the DLPFC, and the insula, possibly underlying deficits in the processing and regulation of affective stimuli (Rai et al., 2021).\n\nCortical gyrification patterns in BD were also compared with other psychiatric disorders, including SCZ and SZA that are thought to be associated with alterations in neurodevelopmental trajectories (Parellada et al., 2017), and gyrification may represent an important and relatively stable biomarker of neurodevelopment (Sasabayashi et al., 2021). Neurodevelopmental deviations, including neuromotor and cognitive impairment, although marked and severe in SCZ (Betts et al., 2016; Cannon et al., 2002; MacCabe et al., 2008; Parellada et al., 2017; Seidman et al., 2013) are also present in BD. Several regions, including the cingulate, insular, frontal, parietal, and occipital cortices, showed an increase in LGI in BD relative to SCZ (Madeira et al., 2020; Madre et al., 2020; Nenadic et al., 2015; Palaniyappan & Liddle, 2014) and only two studies failed to show any difference in this measure (Nanda et al., 2014; Nenadic et al., 2015),\n\nOverall, these studies support the presence of greater alterations in GI in SCZ in large-scale brain networks, which could be due to the presence of more pronounced early developmental alterations or more dramatic neuroprogression phenomena in SCZ (Palaniyappan et al., 2013a, b; Sasabayashi et al., 2021) and could result in cognitive and affective symptoms in this population (Orliac et al., 2013). The current literature does not allow us to clearly distinguish whether gyrification abnormalities occur before the onset of BD or if they result from neuroprogression mechanisms. Furthermore, although gyrification is considered rather stable during brain development, it has been shown that GI changes quite rapidly in response to variations in nutritional status or hydration (Bernardoni et al., 2018). Since patients with BD are subject to even very rapid fluctuations in these parameters (Bernardoni et al., 2018), future research should consider these parameters.\n\nLastly, the role of GI as a potential biomarker of risk for BD remains unclear. Among the two studies that explored GI in relatives of BD, the first did not report differences between affected and unaffected offspring of BD and HC without a family history of BD in the IFG (Drobinin et al., 2019), a region previously proposed as a candidate endophenotype for BD (Cattarinussi et al., 2019), while the second showed a nearly significant reduction in GI in first-degree relatives of BD with cluster A personality disorder compared to HC (Nanda et al., 2014). These results should be interpreted in light of some factors: first, the sample of the study by Drobinin et al. (2019) was relatively small and included young adults, while Nanda et al. (2014) explored GI in a considerably larger and older sample of relatives (mean age = 39.8 ± 16.1 years) (Nanda et al., 2014). Furthermore, the investigation by Nanda et al. (2014) observed differences in GI only between relatives of the schizophrenic bipolar spectrum with cluster A personality disorder, with a small number of relatives of BD and HC, while they reported no differences between the general sample of relatives and HC, suggesting that the decrease in GI in relatives could be associated with the presence of a cluster A personality disorder (Nanda et al., 2014). Overall, these studies did not show alterations in GI in unaffected first-degree relatives, while the picture was mixed for affected relatives. Since volumetric alterations in affected and unaffected relatives of BD have been consistently reported (Cattarinussi et al., 2019, 2022), future studies with larger sample sizes should explore cortical measures in relatives to clarify their possible role in increasing the risk of the disorder. Indeed, as a more stable neurodevelopmental marker compared to gray matter volume-based measures (Sasabayashi et al., 2021), the brain gyrification pattern could provide a promising biomarker potentially useful for early identification of BD in those individuals at-risk mental state (Sasabayashi et al., 2017).\n\nUnfortunately, only one study explored GI in BD-I and BD-II and found no differences (Choi et al., 2020). Since BD subtypes have distinct clinical and epidemiological features, the study of cortical measures, particularly gyrification, could help in exploring possible underlying differences in neurodevelopment. In this regard, larger studies on BD subtypes are needed.\n\nOur qualitative synthesis presents highly heterogeneous findings as a result of different methodological approaches and different BD phenotypes. From a methodological perspective, some studies reported GI using an ROI-based approach (Drobinin et al., 2019; McIntosh et al., 2009; Mirakhur et al., 2009; Nenadic et al., 2015), while others conducted whole-brain analyses (Cao et al., 2017a, b; Choi et al., 2020; Janssen et al., 2014; Liao et al., 2008; Madeira et al., 2020; Madre et al., 2020; Nanda et al., 2014; Palaniyappan & Liddle, 2014; Palaniyappan et al., 2019). Furthermore, most MRI investigations used a cross-sectional design (Cao et al., 2017a, b; Choi et al., 2020; Drobinin et al., 2019; Janssen et al., 2014; Madeira et al., 2020; Madre et al., 2020; McIntosh et al., 2009; Nanda et al., 2014; Nenadic et al., 2015; Palaniyappan & Liddle, 2014; Palaniyappan et al., 2019), and only one longitudinal study (Mirakhur et al., 2009) has been conducted. Furthermore, some works were performed using 1.5 T MRI (Cao et al., 2017a, b; Drobinin et al., 2019; Janssen et al., 2014; Liao et al., 2008; Madre et al., 2020; McIntosh et al., 2009; Mirakhur et al., 2009), while other studies were conducted with 3 T MRI scan (Choi et al., 2020; Madeira et al., 2020; Nanda et al., 2014; Nenadic et al., 2015; Palaniyappan & Liddle, 2014; Palaniyappan et al., 2019), as already reported for other surface-based measures (Han et al., 2006). Lastly, some of the studies included young patients with BD (Cao et al., 2017b; Janssen et al., 2014), while others focused on adult BD. In addition, the clinical characteristics of patients with BD were highly heterogeneous. Some studies reported GI findings among patients with BD without specifying whether BD-I or BD-II patients were included (Choi et al., 2020; Drobinin et al., 2019; Madeira et al., 2020; Madre et al., 2020; McIntosh et al., 2009; Nanda et al., 2014; Palaniyappan & Liddle, 2014), while others focused specifically on BD-I (Cao et al., 2017a, b; Liao et al., 2008; McIntosh et al., 2009; Mirakhur et al., 2009), BD with psychotic symptoms (Nenadic et al., 2015; Palaniyappan et al., 2019), and first episode BD-I with psychotic symptoms (Janssen et al., 2014). Additionally, only a few studies specified the mood state of the patients with BD (Cao et al., 2017a; Choi et al., 2020; Janssen et al., 2014; Liao et al., 2008; Madeira et al., 2020; McIntosh et al., 2009; Nenadic et al., 2015). After this, four studies included outpatients (Choi et al., 2020; Drobinin et al., 2019; Liao et al., 2008; McIntosh et al., 2009), and two reports explored inpatients with BD (Madeira et al., 2020; Palaniyappan & Liddle, 2014), two investigations were carried out in a mixed population setting of BD (Janssen et al., 2014; Nenadic et al., 2015), and for six the setting was not specified (Cao et al., 2017a, b; Madre et al., 2020; Mirakhur et al., 2009; Nanda et al., 2014; Palaniyappan et al., 2019). Only half of the included studies provided details about the duration of illness of patients with BD (Choi et al., 2020; Drobinin et al., 2019; Liao et al., 2008; Madeira et al., 2020; Madre et al., 2020; Mirakhur et al., 2009; Palaniyappan et al., 2019), with previous MRI studies revealing a negative correlation between GI and stages of BD (Cao et al., 2017a) and a negative correlation between the duration of illness and GI in the right limbic lobe (Liao et al., 2008).\n\nBD is characterized by a high rate of medical comorbidities, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome (Kemp et al., 2010; Miola et al., 2022a, 2022b; Sinha et al., 2018; Sylvia et al., 2015), as well as comorbid psychiatric disorders such as anxiety, substance or alcohol use, and eating disorders that can also occur before the onset of BD and act as confounders or can alter neurodevelopment in patients with BD (McElroy et al., 2001; Nabavi et al., 2015). Only a few studies reported comorbid conditions (Cao et al., 2017a; Palaniyappan & Liddle, 2014), thus hampering the possibility of exploring the effects of specific comorbidities on GI.\n\nNotwithstanding the heterogeneity of findings that limits the potential clinical impact of the GI evaluation in BD, the implementation of such a measure could represent a valuable tool not only for the differential diagnosis of bipolar-spectrum disorders but also for the prediction of treatment response in BD. Indeed, GI has been shown to be a useful predictor of antipsychotic treatment response for both affective and nonaffective psychoses, with nonresponders showing prominent hypogyria in the bilateral insular, left frontal and right temporal regions compared to responders (Palaniyappan et al., 2013b).\n\nThis systematic review presents some limitations that must be acknowledged. First, the cross-sectional design of most included studies limits the generalizability of our results and our ability to make inferences about the causality of neurodevelopmental alterations and BD. Second, differences in the estimation of gyrification, whole brain vs. regional approaches, and field strength of the MRI scanners could have contributed to the heterogeneity of the findings. Third, the demographics of the sample, including age and sex, in addition to medical and psychiatric comorbidities, could partly explain these mixed findings. Fourth, in the included investigations, no information was reported on early life adverse events or childhood adversities, which may be associated with structural alterations in the brain of patients with BD (Janiri et al., 2019; Zovetti et al., 2022). Fifth, only a few studies evaluated the effect of medications on GI. Again, given the paucity of studies that have longitudinally tested the effects of medication use on the morphology of gyrification, it is difficult to assess the role of medications as confounders of gyrification over time. Moreover, it remains a challenging to unravel the effects of the disease itself, neuroprogression, and chronicity. Future studies are needed to better clarify these aspects."
