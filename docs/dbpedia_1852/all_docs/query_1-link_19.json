        "text": "Abstract\n\nThe management of acute necrotizing pancreatitis (ANP) has changed dramatically over the past 20 years including the use of less invasive techniques, the timing of interventions, nutritional management, and antimicrobial management. This study sought to create a core outcome set (COS) to help shape future research by establishing a minimal set of essential outcomes that will facilitate future comparisons and pooling of data while minimizing reporting bias.A modified Delphi process was performed through involvement of ANP content experts. Each expert proposed a list of outcomes for consideration, and the panel anonymously scored the outcomes on a 9-point Likert scale. Core outcome consensus defined a priori as >70% of scores receiving 7 to 9 points and <15% of scores receiving 1 to 3 points. Feedback and aggregate data were shared between rounds with interclass correlation trends used to determine the end of the study.A total of 19 experts agreed to participate in the study with 16 (84%) participating through study completion. Forty-three outcomes were initially considered with 16 reaching consensuses after four rounds of the modified Delphi process. The final COS included outcomes related to mortality, organ failure, complications, interventions/management, and social factors.Through an iterative consensus process, content experts agreed on a COS for the management of ANP. This will help shape future research to generate data suitable for pooling and other statistical analyses that may guide clinical practice.Therapeutic/Care Management; Level V.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1097/TA.0000000000004281\n\nView details for PubMedID 38407209\n\nAbstract\n\nMinimally invasive distal pancreatectomy (MIDP) has established advantages over the open approach. The costs associated with robotic DP (RDP) versus laparoscopic DP (LDP) make the robotic approach controversial. We sought to compare outcomes and cost of LDP and RDP using propensity matching analysis at our institution.Patients undergoing LDP or RDP between 2000 and 2021 were retrospectively identified. Patients were optimally matched using age, gender, American Society of Anesthesiologists status, body mass index, and tumor size. Between-group differences were analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for continuous data, and the McNemar's test for categorical data. Outcomes included operative duration, conversion to open surgery, postoperative length of stay, pancreatic fistula rate, pseudocyst requiring intervention, and costs.298 patients underwent MIDP, 180 (60%) were laparoscopic and 118 (40%) were robotic. All RDPs were matched 1:1 to a laparoscopic case with absolute standardized mean differences for all matching covariates below 0.10, except for tumor type (0.16). RDP had longer operative times (268 vs 178 min, p < 0.01), shorter length of stay (2 vs 4 days, p < 0.01), fewer biochemical pancreatic leaks (11.9% vs 34.7%, p < 0.01), and fewer interventional radiological drainage (0% vs 5.9%, p = 0.01). The number of pancreatic fistulas (11.9% vs 5.1%, p = 0.12), collections requiring antibiotics or intervention (11.9% vs 5.1%, p = 0.12), and conversion rates (3.4% vs 5.1%, p = 0.72) were comparable between the two groups. The total direct index admission costs for RDP were 1.01 times higher than for LDP for FY16-19 (p = 0.372), and 1.33 times higher for FY20-22 (p = 0.031).Although RDP required longer operative times than LDP, postoperative stays were shorter. The procedure cost of RDP was modestly more expensive than LDP, though this was partially offset by reduced hospital stay and reintervention rate.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1007/s00464-024-10728-8\n\nView details for PubMedID 38438677\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID 1877036\n\nAbstract\n\nAdherence to prehabilitation is crucial for optimal benefit, but reasons for low adherence to home-based programs remain unexplored. Our aim was to identify and explore barriers and facilitators to prehabilitation adherence among patients undergoing abdominal surgery.Nested in a single-center randomized controlled trial on prehabilitation (Perioperative Optimization With Enhanced Recovery (POWER)), this study had an explanatory sequential design with a connect integration. Patients randomized to the intervention arm were included in the quantitative analysis, and a subset of them was invited for a semi-structured interview. The exposure was the frequency of barriers to physical activity and healthy eating, and the outcome was adherence to those components of prehabilitation. Logistic or linear regression was used as appropriate.Among 133 participants in the intervention arm, 116 (87.2%) completed the initial survey ((56.9% women, median age 61 years old (IQR 49.0; 69.4)). The most frequent barriers to exercise and healthy eating were medical issues (59%) and lack of motivation (31%), respectively. There was no significant association between the barriers to physical activity score and adherence to this component of the program (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.78-1.02, p=0.09). Higher barriers to healthy eating scores were associated with lower Mediterranean diet scores pre- and post-intervention (coef.: -0.32, 95% CI: -0.49; -0.15, p<0.001; and coef.: -0.27, 95% CI: -0.47; -0.07, p=0.01, respectively). Interviews with 15 participants revealed that participating in prehabilitation was a motivator for healthy eating and exercising through goal setting, time-efficient workouts, and promoting self-efficacy.We identified key barriers to be addressed and facilitators to be leveraged in future prehabilitation programs.NCT04504266.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1007/s11605-023-05857-9\n\nView details for PubMedID 37848690\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID 7165160\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND & AIMS: Parenteral nutrition (PN) is commonly utilized to support patients in the perioperative period of major gastrointestinal (GI) surgeries. This study sought to evaluate PN utilization based on malnutrition status and duration of PN use in a single academic institution to evaluate baseline ASPEN recommendation concordance and identify opportunities for quality improvement.METHODS: Patients who had undergone major GI surgical oncology operations and received PN were identified over six months. The medical charts were reviewed for clinicopathologic variables, nutrition status, and the initiation and duration of PN. The cohort was stratified by PN recommendation concordance, and intergroup comparisons were made to identify factors associated with non-concordant utilization of PN.RESULTS: Eighty-one patients were identified, 38.3% of patients were initiated on PN due to dysmotility. Other indications were: intra-abdominal leak (27.2%), mechanical obstruction (18.5%), and failure to thrive (16.0%). Non-concordant PN utilization was identified in 67.9% (55/81) of patients. The most frequent reason for non-concordance was initiation outside the recommended time frame due to severity of malnutrition; well-nourished patients started \"too soon\" accounted for 29.0% (16/55), and 61.8% started \"too late,\" most of whom were moderately or severely malnourished (34/55). In 16.0% (13/81) of the overall cohort, PN was administered for fewer than five days.CONCLUSIONS: PN use during the perioperative period surrounding major GI oncologic operations is clinically nuanced and frequently not concordant with established ASPEN recommendations. Quality improvement efforts should focus on reducing delayed PN initiation for nutritionally at-risk patients without increasing premature PN use in well-nourished patients.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.clnesp.2023.06.019\n\nView details for PubMedID 37739662\n\nAbstract\n\nSpleen-preservation during minimally invasive distal pancreatectomy (MIDP) can be technically challenging and remains controversial. Our primary aim was to compare MIDP and splenectomy with spleen-preserving MIDP. Secondarily, we compared two spleen-preserving techniques.Adults undergoing MIDP (2007-2021) were retrospectively included in this single-center study. Intraoperative and postoperative outcomes between spleen-preservation and splenectomy and between the two spleen-preserving techniques were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test for continuous data, and Fisher's exact test for categorical data.Of the 293 patients who underwent MIDP, preservation of the spleen was intended in 208 (71%) patients. Spleen-preservation was achieved in 174 patients (84%) via the Warshaw technique (130; 75%) or vessel-preservation (44; 25%). The spleen-preserving group had shorter length of stay (3 vs 4 days, p < 0.01), fewer conversions to open (1 vs 12, p < 0.01) and less blood loss (p < 0.01) compared to the splenectomy group. Operative (OR) times were comparable (229 vs 214 min, p = 0.67). Except for the operative time, which was longer for the Warshaw technique (245 vs 183 min, p = 0.01), no other differences between the two spleen-preserving techniques were found. At a median follow-up of 43 (IQR 18-79) months after spleen-preservation, only 2 (1.1%) patients had required splenectomy (1 partial splenectomy for infarct/abscess after Warshaw, 1 for variceal bleeding after vessel-preserving).Spleen-preservation is not associated with increased risk of blood loss, longer hospital stay, conversion, nor lengthy OR times. Late splenectomy is very rarely required. Given the immune consequences of splenectomy, spleen-preservation should be strongly considered in MIDP.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1007/s11605-023-05809-3\n\nView details for PubMedID 37653153\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID 3912973\n\nAbstract\n\nCharacterize the determinants, all-cause mortality risk, and healthcare costs associated with common bile duct injury (CBDI) following cholecystectomy in a contemporary patient population.Retrospective cohort study using nationwide patient-level commercial and Medicare Advantage claims data, 2003-2019. Beneficiaries ≥18 years who underwent cholecystectomy were identified using Current Procedure Terminology (CPT) codes. CBDI was defined by a second surgical procedure for repair within one year of cholecystectomy.We estimated the association of common surgical indications and comorbidities with risk of CBDI using logistic regression; the association between CBDI and all-cause mortality using Cox proportional hazards regression; and calculated average healthcare costs associated with CBDI repair.Among 769,782 individuals with cholecystectomy, we identified 894 with CBDI (0.1%). CBDI was inversely associated with biliary colic (odds ratio [OR] = 0.82; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.71-0.94) and obesity (OR = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.59-0.84), but positively associated with pancreas disease (OR = 2.16, 95% CI: 1.92-2.43) and chronic liver disease (OR = 1.25, 95% CI: 1.05-1.49). In fully adjusted Cox models, CBDI was associated with increased all-cause mortality risk (hazard ratio = 1.57, 95% CI: 1.38-1.79). The same-day CBDI repair was associated with the lowest mean overall costs, with the highest mean overall costs for repair within 1 to 3 months.In this retrospective cohort study, calculated rates of CBDI are substantially lower than in prior large studies, perhaps reflecting quality-improvement initiatives over the past two decades. Yet, CBDI remains associated with increased all-cause mortality risks and significant healthcare costs. Patient-level characteristics may be important determinants of CBDI and warrant ongoing examination in future research.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1097/AS9.0000000000000238\n\nView details for PubMedID 37600869\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC10431520\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: The most used pancreatic cancer (PC) resectability criteria are descriptive in nature or based solely on dichotomous degree of involvement (<180° or >180°) of vessels, which allows for a high degree of subjectivity and inconsistency.METHODS: Radiographic measurements of the circumferential degree and length of tumor contact with major peripancreatic vessels were retrospectively obtained from pre-treatment multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) images from PC patients treated between 2001 and 2015 at two large academic institutions. Arterial and venous scores were calculated for each patient, then tested for a correlation with tumor resection and R0 resection.RESULTS: The analysis included 466 patients. Arterial and venous scores were highly predictive of resection and R0 resection in both the training (n=294) and validation (n=172) cohorts. A recursive partitioning tree based on arterial and venous score cutoffs developed with the training cohort was able to stratify patients of the validation cohort into discrete groups with distinct resectability probabilities. A refined recursive partitioning tree composed of three resectability groups was generated, with probabilities of resection and R0 resection of respectively 94 and 73% for group A, 61 and 35% for group B, and 4 and 2% for group C. This resectability scoring system (RSS) was highly prognostic, predicting median overall survival times of 27, 18.9, and 13.5 months respectively for patients in RSS groups A, B, and C (p<0.001).CONCLUSIONS: The proposed RSS was highly predictive of resection, R0 resection, and prognosis for patients with PC when tested against an external dataset.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1245/s10434-023-13120-3\n\nView details for PubMedID 36792768\n\nAbstract\n\nThe aims of the study are to describe the growth kinetics of pathologically proven, treatment-naive pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (panNENs) at imaging surveillance and to determine their association with histopathologic grade and Ki-67.This study included 100 panNENs from 95 patients who received pancreas protocol computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging from January 2005 to July 2022. All masses were treatment-naive, had histopathologic correlation, and were imaged with at least 2 computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging at least 90 days apart. Growth kinetics was assessed using linear and specific growth rate, stratified by grade and Ki-67. Masses were also assessed qualitatively to determine other possible imaging predictors of grade.There were 76 grade 1 masses, 17 grade 2 masses, and 7 grade 3 masses. Median (interquartile range) linear growth rates were 0.06 cm/y (0-0.20), 0.40 cm/y (0.22-1.06), and 2.70 cm/y (0.41-3.89) for grade 1, 2, and 3 masses, respectively (P < 0.001). Linear growth rate correlated with Ki-67 with r2 of 0.623 (P < 0.001). At multivariate analyses, linear growth rate was the only imaging feature significantly associated with grade (P = 0.009).Growth kinetics correlate with Ki-67 and grade. Grade 1 panNENs grow slowly versus grade 2-3 panNENs.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1097/MPA.0000000000002221\n\nView details for PubMedID 37523605\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: There are many well-described potential gastrointestinal (GI) side effects of pancreatic resection that can cause patients to suffer from chronic malabsorption, diarrhea, and persistent nausea. These GI symptoms can affect postoperative recovery, initiation of adjuvant therapy, and overall quality of life (QOL). The purpose of this study is to quantify the incidence of post-procedural complications and identify patients at higher risk for experiencing GI dysfunction after pancreatectomy.METHODS: A retrospective review of patients who underwent pancreatic resection at a single institution between January 2014 and December 2019 was performed. Demographics, operative factors, and postoperative gastrointestinal symptomatology and treatments were obtained by chart review. Significance tests were performed to compare GI dysfunction between patient subgroups.RESULTS: A total of 545 patients underwent pancreatic resection; within the cohort 451 patients (83%) underwent a pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) and the most common indication was pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Two-thirds of patients (67%) reported gastrointestinal symptoms persisting beyond hospitalization. Only 105 patients (20%) were referred to gastroenterology for evaluation with 30 patients (5.5%) receiving a formal diagnosis. Patients who underwent PD were more likely to report GI symptoms and patients who identified as Caucasian were more likely to be referred to gastroenterology for evaluation.CONCLUSIONS: Gastrointestinal dysfunction after pancreatic resection occurs frequently yet only a small percentage of patients are referred for formal testing and diagnosis. There also appears to be a racial difference in referral patterns. Patients would benefit if earlier attention was dedicated to the diagnosis and corresponding treatment for postoperative digestive health disorders to optimize treatment planning and QOL.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1186/s12876-022-02565-7\n\nView details for PubMedID 36435757\n\nAbstract\n\nPancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs) are described by the World Health Organization (WHO) classification by grade (1-3) and degree of differentiation. Grade 1 and 2; well differentiated PNETs are often characterized as relatively \"indolent\" tumors for which locoregional therapies have been shown to be effective for palliation of symptom control and prolongation of survival even in the setting of advanced disease. The treatment of liver metastases includes surgical and non-surgical modalities with varying degrees of invasiveness; efficacy; and risk. Most of these modalities have not been prospectively compared. This paper reviews literature that has been published on treatment of pancreatic neuroendocrine liver metastases using surgery; liver directed embolization and peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT). Surgery is associated with the longest survival in patients with resectable disease burden. Liver-directed (hepatic artery) therapies can sometimes convert patients with borderline disease into candidates for surgery. Among the three embolization modalities; the preponderance of data suggests chemoembolization offers superior radiographic response compared to bland embolization and radioembolization; but all have similar survival. PRRT was initially approved as salvage therapy in patients with advanced disease that was not amenable to resection or embolization; though the role of PRRT is evolving rapidly.\n\nView details for DOI 10.3390/cancers14205103\n\nView details for PubMedID 36291892\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: The optimal surgical management of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 is controversial. This study sought to compare clinicopathologic characteristics and outcomes of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1-associated and sporadic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors from a large multi-national database.METHODS: A multi-institutional, international database of patients with surgically resected pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors was analyzed. The cohort was divided into 2 groups: those with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 versus those with sporadic disease. Clinicopathologic comparisons were made. Overall and disease-free survival were analyzed. Propensity score matching was used to reduce bias.RESULTS: Of 651 patients included, 45 (6.9%) had multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 and 606 sporadic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1-associated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors were more common in younger patients and associated with multifocal disease at the time of surgery and higher T-stage. Lymph node involvement and the presence of metastasis were similar. Total pancreatectomy rate was 5-fold higher in the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 cohort. Median survival did not differ (disease-free survival 126 months multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 vs 198 months sporadic, P > .5). After matching, survival remained similar (overall survival not reached in either cohort, disease-free survival 126 months multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 vs 198 months sporadic, P > .5). Equivalence in overall survival and disease-free survival persisted even when patients who underwent subtotal and total pancreatectomy were excluded.CONCLUSION: Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1-associated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors are more common in younger patients and are associated with multifocality and higher T-stage. Survival for patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1-associated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors is comparable to those with sporadic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, even in the absence of radical pancreatectomy. Consideration should be given to parenchymal-sparing surgery to preserve pancreatic function.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.surg.2022.04.011\n\nView details for PubMedID 35577612\n\nAbstract\n\nThe introduction of robotics in living donor liver transplantation has been revolutionary. We aimed to examine the safety of robotic living donor right hepatectomy (RLDRH) compared to open (ODRH) and laparoscopic (LADRH) approaches. A systematic review was carried out in Medline and six additional databases following PRISMA guidelines. Data on morbidity, postoperative liver function, and pain in donors and recipients were extracted from studies comparing RLDRH, ODRH, and LADRH published up to September 2020; PROSPERO (CRD42020214313). Dichotomous variables were pooled as risk ratios and continuous variables as weighted mean differences. Four studies with a total of 517 patients were included. In living donors, the postoperative total bilirubin level (MD: -0.7 95%CI -1.0, -0.4), length of hospital stay (MD: -0.8 95%CI -1.4, -0.3), Clavien-Dindo complications I-II (RR: 0.5 95%CI 0.2, 0.9), and pain score at day > 3 (MD: -0.6 95%CI -1.6, 0.4) were lower following RLDRH compared to ODRH. Furthermore, the pain score at day > 3 (MD: -0.4 95%CI -0.8, -0.09) was lower after RLDRH when compared to LADRH. In recipients, the postoperative AST level was lower (MD: -0.5 95%CI -0.9, -0.1) following RLDRH compared to ODRH. Moreover, the length of stay (MD: -6.4 95%CI -11.3, -1.5) was lower after RLDRH when compared to LADRH. In summary, we identified low- to unclear-quality evidence that RLDRH seems to be safe and feasible for adult living donor liver transplantation compared to the conventional approaches. No postoperative deaths were reported.\n\nView details for DOI 10.3390/jcm11092603\n\nView details for PubMedID 35566727\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Robotic pancreatoduodenectomy (RPD) technology is developing rapidly, but there is still a lack of a specific and objective difficulty evaluation system in the field of application and training of RPD surgery.Methods: The clinical data of patients who underwent RPD in our hospital from November 2014 to October 2020 were analyzed retrospectively. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to determine the predictors of operation difficulty and convert into a scoring system.Results: A total of 72 patients were enrolled in the group. According to the operation time (25%), intraoperative blood loss (25%), conversion to laparotomy, and major complications, the difficulty of operation was divided into low difficulty (0-2 points) and high difficulty (3-4 points). The multivariate logistic regression model included the thickness of mesenteric tissue (P1) (P=0.035), the thickness of the abdominal wall (B1) (P=0.017), and the preoperative albumin (P=0.032), and the nomogram was established. AUC=0.773 (0.645-0.901).Conclusions: The RPD difficulty evaluation system based on the specific anatomical relationship between da Vinci's laparoscopic robotic arm and tissues/organs in the operation area can be used as a predictive tool to evaluate the surgical difficulty of patients before operation and guide clinical practice.\n\nView details for DOI 10.3389/fsurg.2022.916014\n\nView details for PubMedID 35722537\n\nAbstract\n\nWe review our institution's experience in treating leiomyosarcomas involving the inferior vena cava, and we offer guidance on the management.A text-based search was performed to identify all patients who underwent surgical resection between January 2002 and October 2020. Clinicopathologic data, intraoperative variables, and outcomes were extracted from chart review.Twelve of 16 patients (75%) had localized disease; the remaining had limited metastatic disease. Seven of 16 patients (44%) received neoadjuvant chemotherapy or radiation; three patients had partial responses, and four patients had stable disease using RECIST 1.1 criteria. IVC reconstruction was performed in 14 of 16 patients (88%); IVC was ligated for the remaining two patients. Half of all patients had R0 resection on final pathology; the remaining had R1 resections. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were not statistically different between patients with R0 and R1 resection. Median PFS was 1.8 years (95% CI 0.89 - not reached); median OS was 6.5 years (1.8 - not reached). Only one patient (6%) experienced local disease recurrence; 4 of 16 patients (25%) experienced disease recurrence distally without local recurrence.Resection of IVC leiomyosarcomas at a sarcoma referral center with experience in vascular reconstruction can lead to many years of recurrence-free survival. Surgical resection should be offered to patients with a low volume of metastatic disease to reduce local complications from the primary tumor, many of which exert significant mass effect on surrounding organs. For patients with metastatic disease or large, high-risk tumors, neoadjuvant chemotherapy can provide a biologic test of disease stability prior to resection.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.suronc.2021.101670\n\nView details for PubMedID 34710646\n\nAbstract\n\nSurgical resection of colorectal liver metastases is associated with greater survival compared with non-surgical treatment, and a meaningful possibility of cure. However, the majority of patients are not eligible for resection and may require other non-surgical interventions, such as liver-directed therapies, to be converted to surgical eligibility. Given the number of available therapies, a general framework is needed that outlines the specific roles of chemotherapy, surgery, and locoregional treatments [including selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) with Y-90 microspheres]. Using a data-driven, modified Delphi process, an expert panel of surgical oncologists, transplant surgeons, and hepatopancreatobiliary (HPB) surgeons convened to create a comprehensive, evidence-based treatment algorithm that includes appropriate treatment options for patients stratified by their eligibility for surgical treatment. The group coined a novel, more inclusive phrase for targeted locoregional tumor treatment (a blanket term for resection, ablation, and other emerging locoregional treatments): local parenchymal tumor destruction therapy. The expert panel proposed new nomenclature for 3 distinct disease categories of liver-dominant metastatic colorectal cancer that is consistent with other tumor types: (I) surgically treatable (resectable); (II) surgically untreatable (borderline resectable); (III) advanced surgically untreatable (unresectable) disease. Patients may present at any point in the algorithm and move between categories depending on their response to therapy. The broad intent of therapy is to transition patients toward individualized treatments where possible, given the survival advantage that resection offers in the context of a comprehensive treatment plan. This article reviews what is known about the role of SIRT with Y-90 as neoadjuvant, definitive, or palliative therapy in these different clinical situations and provides insight into when treatment with SIRT with Y-90 may be appropriate and useful, organized into distinct treatment algorithm steps.\n\nView details for DOI 10.21037/jgo.2020.01.09\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000529848600022\n\nView details for PubMedID 32399284\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC7212103\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are rare mesenchymal tumors, most commonly arising in the stomach. Surgical resection remains the mainstay of cure, and can often be accomplished laparoscopically. Tumor size and location guide selection of appropriate resection technique.METHODS: A retrospective review of all patients undergoing surgery at a single academic center between 2000 and 2018. Comparisons and descriptive statistics performed using student's t test and chi2 test.RESULTS: 77 patients underwent resection for gastric GIST, 53 (68%) laparoscopic. Patients undergoing open operations had significantly larger tumors (4cm vs 7cm, p<0.001). Operative time was not significantly different between the two groups (117min vs 104min, p=0.26). Median length of stay was significantly shorter for laparoscopic resection, and postoperative complication rate was lower. A review of the operative notes revealed four types of resection: non-anatomic stapled wedge resection, resection of a full-thickness \"disk\" of stomach around the tumor with primary closure, formal partial gastrectomy with reconstruction, and laparoscopic transgastric (endoluminal) resection.CONCLUSION: Non-anatomic resection (wedge or disk) is most feasible for tumors on the greater curve or gastric body, far enough from the pylorus and gastroesophageal junction to avoid narrowing inflow or outflow. A partial gastrectomy may be required for large tumors or those encroaching on the esophagus or pylorus. For small intraluminal tumors, a laparoscopic transgastric approach is ideal. This review of the technical details of each type of resection can aid in selecting the ideal approach for difficult tumors.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1007/s00464-020-07510-x\n\nView details for PubMedID 32221752\n\nAbstract\n\nAlthough outcome of surgical resection of liver metastases from pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs) has been extensively studied, little is known about surgery for locally advanced PNETs; it was listed recently by the European neuroendocrine tumor society as a major unmet need.To evaluate the outcome of patients who underwent surgery for locally aggressive PNETs.This retrospective single-center case series reviewed consecutive patients who underwent resection of T3/T4 PNETs at a single academic institution. Data collection occurred from 2003 to 2018. Data analysis was performed in August 2019.Disease-free survival (primary outcome) and overall mortality (secondary outcome) were assessed with Kaplan-Meier analysis. Recurrence risk (secondary outcome, defined as identification of tumor recurrence on imaging) was assessed with Cox proportional hazard models adjusting for covariates.In this case series, 99 patients with locally advanced nondistant metastatic PNET (56 men [57%]) with a mean (SEM) age of 57.0 (1.4) years and a mean (SEM) follow-up of 5.3 (0.1) years underwent surgically aggressive resections. Of those, 4 patients (4%) underwent preoperative neoadjuvant treatment (including peptide receptor radionuclide therapy and chemotherapy); 18 patients (18%) underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy, 68 patients (69%) had distal or subtotal pancreatic resection, 10 patients (10%) had total resection, and 3 patients (3%) had other pancreatic procedures. Additional organ resection was required in 86 patients (87%): spleen (71 patients [71%]), major blood vessel (17 patients [17%]), bowel (2 patients [2%]), stomach (4 patients [4%]), and kidney (2 patients [2%]). Five-year disease-free survival was 61% (61 patients) and 5-year overall survival was 91% (91 patients). Of those living, 75 patients (76%) had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score of less than or equal to 1 at last followup. Lymph node involvement (HR, 7.66; 95% CI, 2.78-21.12; P < .001), additional organ resected (HR, 6.15; 95% CI, 1.61-23.55; P = .008), and male sex (HR, 3.77; 95% CI, 1.68-8.97; P = .003) were associated with increased risk of recurrence. Functional tumors had a lower risk of recurrence (HR, 0.23; CI, 0.06-0.89; P = .03). Required resection of blood vessels was not associated with a significant increase recurrence risk.In this case series, positive lymph node involvement and resection of organs with tumor involvement were associated with an increased recurrence risk. These subgroups may require adjuvant systemic treatment. These findings suggest that patients with locally advanced PNETs who undergo surgical resection have excellent disease-free and overall survival.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.24318\n\nView details for PubMedID 33146734\n\nAbstract\n\nAssessment of treating metastatic ileal neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) with complete resection of primary tumor, nodal and liver metastases, plus administration of long-acting somatostatin analogues (SSAs).A prospective database was queried for patients with ileal or pancreatic NETs with pathology-confirmed liver metastases and tumor somatostatin receptors. Patients did not have MEN-1 and had no previous treatment. The impacts of SSA treatment on the primary outcome of survival and secondary outcome of progression-free survival were assessed with Kaplan-Meier analysis. Log rank test was used to compare overall and progression-free survival among groups.Seventeen ileal NET patients and 36 pancreatic NET patients who underwent surgical resection between 2001 and 2018, who had pathology-confirmed liver metastases and confirmed tumor somatostatin receptors, did not have MEN-1, and had no previous treatment were identified. Median follow-up for patients with ileal NETs was 80 months (range 0-197 months) and 32 months (range 1-182 months) for pancreatic NETs. Five-year survival was 93% and 72% for ileal and pancreatic NET, respectively. Progression-free 5-year survival was 70% and 36% for ileal and pancreatic NET, respectively. Overall 5-year survival for pNETs was greater in those patients treated with SSA (79%) compared to those who underwent surgery alone (34%, p < 0.01). The average ECOG score was low for surviving patients with ileal (0.15) and pancreatic NET (0.73) indicating a good quality of life.Resection of primary lymph node and liver metastatic ileal or pancreatic NETs followed with continued SSAs is associated with an excellent progression-free and overall survival and minimal side effects.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1007/s11605-019-04309-7\n\nView details for PubMedID 31346887\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Severe necrotizing pancreatitis may result in midbody necrosis and ductal disruption leaving an isolated pancreatic tail. The purpose of this study was to characterize outcomes among patients with an isolated tail remnant who underwent transgastric drainage or necrosectomy (endoscopic or surgical) and determine the need for subsequent operative management.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with necrotizing pancreatitis and retrogastric walled-off collections treated by surgical transgastric necrosectomy or endoscopic cystgastrostomy± necrosectomy between 2009 and 2017 were identified by a retrospective chart review. All available preprocedure and postprocedure imaging was reviewed for evidence of isolated distal pancreatic tail remnants.RESULTS: Seventy-four patients were included (40 surgical and 34 endoscopic). All the patients in the surgical group underwent laparoscopic transgastric necrosectomy; the endoscopic group consisted of 26 patients for pseudocyst drainage and eight patients for necrosectomy. A disconnected pancreatic tail was identified in 22 (29%) patients (13 laparoscopic and nine endoscopic). After the creation of the \"cystgastrostomy,\" there were no external fistulas despite the viable tail. Of the 22 patients, four patients developed symptoms at a median of 23months (two, recurrent episodic pancreatitis; two, intractable pain). Two patients (both initially in endoscopic group) ultimately required distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy at 24 and 6months after index procedure.CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a walled-off retrogastric collection and an isolated viable tail are effectively managed by a transgastric approach. Despite this seemingly \"unstable anatomy,\" the creation of an internal fistula via surgical or endoscopic \"cystgastrostomy\" avoids external fistulas/drains and the short-term necessity of surgical distal pancreatectomy. A very small subset requires intervention for late symptoms.\n\nView details for PubMedID 30278917\n\nAbstract\n\nOBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of surgical transgastric necrosectomy (TGN) for walled-off pancreatic necrosis (WON) in selected patients.BACKGROUND: WON is a common consequence of severe pancreatitis and typically occurs 3 to 5 weeks after the onset of acute pancreatitis. When symptomatic, it can require intervention.METHODS: A retrospective review of patients with WON undergoing surgical management at 3 high-volume pancreatic institutions was performed. Surgical indications, intervention timing, technical methodology, and patient outcomes were evaluated. Patients undergoing intervention <30 days were excluded. Differences across centers were evaluated using a P value of <0.05 as significant.RESULTS: One hundred seventy-eight total patients were analyzed (mean WON diameter = 14 cm, 64% male, mean age = 51 years) across 3 centers. The majority required inpatient admission with a median preoperative length of hospital stay of 29 days (25% required preoperative critical care support). Most (96%) patients underwent a TGN. The median duration of time between the onset of pancreatitis symptoms and operative intervention was 60 days. Thirty-nine percent of the necrosum was infected. Postoperative morbidity and mortality were 38% and 2%, respectively. The median postoperative length of hospital length of stay was 8 days, with the majority of patients discharged home. The median length of follow-up was 21 months, with 91% of patients having complete clinical resolution of symptoms at a median of 6 weeks. Readmission to hospital and/or a repeat intervention was also not infrequent (20%).CONCLUSION: Surgical TGN is an excellent 1-stage surgical option for symptomatic WON in a highly selected group of patients. Precise surgical technique and long-term outpatient follow-up are mandatory for optimal patient outcomes.\n\nView details for PubMedID 30216220\n\nAbstract\n\nINTRODUCTION: Post-operative delayed gastric emptying (DGE) is a frustrating complication of pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD). We studied whether monitoring of post-operative gastric motor activity using a novel wireless patch system can identify patients at risk for DGE.METHODS: Eighty-one patients were prospectively studied since 2016; 75 patients were analyzed for this study. After PD, battery-operated wireless patches (G-Tech Medical) that acquire gastrointestinal myoelectrical signals are placed on the abdomen and transmit data by Bluetooth. Patients were divided into EARLY and LATE groups, by diet tolerance of 7 days (ERAS goal). Subgroup analysis was done of patients included after ERAS initiation.RESULTS: The EARLY and LATE groups had 50 and 25 patients, respectively, with length of stay (LOS) 7 and 11 days (p<0.05). Nasogastric insertion was required in 44% of the LATE group. Tolerance of food was noted by 6 vs 9 days in the EARLY vs LATE group (p<0.05) with higher cumulative gastric myoelectrical activity. Diminished gastric myoelectrical activity accurately identified delayed tolerance to regular diet in a logistical regression analysis (area under the curve (AUC), 0.81; 95% CI, 0.74-0.92). The gastric myoelectrical activity also identified delayed LOS status with an AUC of 0.75 (95% CI, 0.67-0.88). Stomach signal continued to be predictive in 90% of the ERAS cohort despite earlier oral intake.CONCLUSIONS: Measurement of gastric activity after PD can distinguish patients with shorter or longer times to diet. This non-invasive technology provides data to identify patients at risk for DGE and may guide timing of oral intake by gastric \"readiness.\"\n\nView details for PubMedID 30048596\n\nAbstract\n\nOBJECTIVE: To determine the role of reoperation in patients with persistent or recurrent Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome (ZES).BACKGROUND: Approximately, 0% to 60% of ZES patients are disease-free (DF) after an initial operation, but the tumor may recur.METHODS: A prospective database was queried.RESULTS: A total of 223 patients had an initial operation for possible cure of ZES and then were subsequently evaluated serially with cross sectional imaging-computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound, more recently octreoscan-and functional studies for ZES activity. The mean age at first surgery was 49 years and with an 11-year mean follow-up 52 patients (23%) underwent reoperation when ZES recurred with imageable disease. Results in this group are analyzed in the current report. Reoperation occurred on a mean of 6 years after the initial surgery with a mean number of reoperations of 1 (range 1-5). After reoperation 18/52 patients were initially DF (35%); and after a mean follow-up of 8 years, 13/52 remained DF (25%). During follow-up, 9/52 reoperated patients (17%) died, of whom 7 patients died a disease-related death (13%). The overall survival from first surgery was 84% at 20 years and 68% at 30 years. Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 status did not affect survival, but DF interval and liver metastases did.CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that a significant proportion of patients with ZES will develop resectable persistent or recurrent disease after an initial operation. These patients generally have prolonged survival after reoperation and 25% can be cured with repeat surgery, suggesting all ZES patients postresection should have systematic imaging, and if tumor recurs, advise repeat operation.\n\nView details for PubMedID 29517561\n\nAbstract\n\nThe aim of this study was to compare the American Gastroenterological Association guidelines (AGA criteria), the 2012 (Fukuoka criteria), and 2006 (Sendai criteria) International Consensus Guidelines for the diagnosis of advanced pancreatic cystic neoplasms.All patients who underwent surgical resection of a pancreatic cyst from August 2007 through January 2016 were retrospectively analyzed at a single tertiary academic center. Relevant clinical and imaging variables along with pathology results were collected to determine appropriate classification for each guideline. Advanced pancreatic cystic neoplasms were defined by the presence of either high-grade dysplasia or cystic adenocarcinoma. Diagnostic accuracy was measured by ROC analysis.A total of 209 patients were included. Both the AGA and Fukuoka criteria had a higher diagnostic accuracy for advanced neoplastic cysts than the Sendai criteria: AGA ROC 0.76 (95% CI 0.69-0.81), Fukuoka ROC 0.78 (95% CI 0.74-0.82), and Sendai ROC 0.65 (95% CI 0.61-0.69) (p < 0.0001). There was no difference between the Fukuoka and the AGA criteria. While the sensitivity was higher in the Fukuoka criteria compared to the AGA criteria (97.7 vs. 88.6%), the specificity was higher in the AGA criteria compared to the Fukuoka criteria (62.4 vs. 58.2%).In a surgical series of patients with pancreatic cysts, the AGA and Fukuoka criteria had superior diagnostic accuracy for advanced neoplastic cysts compared to the original Sendai criteria.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1007/s10620-017-4460-y\n\nView details for PubMedID 28116593\n\nAbstract\n\nFistula Risk Score (FRS) is a previously developed tool to assess the risk of clinically relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula (CR-POPF) following pancreatoduodenectomy (PD).Prospectively collected databases from 4 university affiliated and non-affiliated HPB centers in United States and Canada were used. The influence of individual baseline characteristics, FRS and FRS group on CR-POPF was assessed in univariate and multivariate analyses. FRS calculator performance was assessed using a C-statistic.444 patients were identified. Pathology, soft pancreas texture and pancreatic duct size were associated with CR-POPF rates (p < 0.001 for each); EBL was not (p = 0.067). The negligible risk group consisted of 50 (11.3%) patients, low risk of 118 (26.6%), moderate 234 (52.7%) and high risk group of 42 (9.5%) patients. The overall rate of CR-POPF was 20%. Of the patients in the negligible risk group, 2% developed CR-POPF, 13.6% of the low risk, 23.1% moderate and 42.9% in the high risk group (p < 0.001). Overall C-statistic was 0.719.FRS is robust and able to stratify the risk of developing CR-POPF following PD in diverse North American academic and non-academic institutions. The FRS should be used in research and to guide clinical management of patients post PD in these institutions.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.hpb.2017.01.021\n\nView details for PubMedID 28233672\n\nAbstract\n\nDevelopment and implementation of robust reporting processes to systematically provide quality data to care teams in a timely manner is challenging. National cancer quality measures are useful, but the manual data collection required is resource intensive, and reporting is delayed. We designed a largely automated measurement system with our multidisciplinary cancer care programs (CCPs) to identify, measure, and improve quality metrics that were meaningful to the care teams and their patients.Each CCP physician leader collaborated with the cancer quality team to identify metrics, abiding by established guiding principles. Financial incentive was provided to the CCPs if performance at the end of the study period met predetermined targets. Reports were developed and provided to the CCP physician leaders on a monthly or quarterly basis, for dissemination to their CCP teams.A total of 15 distinct quality measures were collected in depth for the first time at this cancer center. Metrics spanned the patient care continuum, from diagnosis through end of life or survivorship care. All metrics improved over the study period, met their targets, and earned a financial incentive for their CCP.Our quality program had three essential elements that led to its success: (1) engaging physicians in choosing the quality measures and prespecifying goals, (2) using automated extraction methods for rapid and timely feedback on improvement and progress toward achieving goals, and (3) offering a financial team-based incentive if prespecified goals were met.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1200/JOP.2017.021139\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC5880618\n\nAbstract\n\nMinimally invasive liver surgery is a growing field, and a small number of recent reports have suggested that laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) is feasible even in patients with cirrhosis. However, parenchymal transection of the cirrhotic liver is challenging due to fibrosis and portal hypertension. There is a paucity of data regarding the technical modifications necessary to safely transect the diseased parenchyma.Patients undergoing LLR by a single surgeon between 2008 and 2015 were reviewed. Patients with cirrhosis were compared to those without cirrhosis to examine differences in surgical technique, intraoperative characteristics, and outcomes (including liver-related morbidity and general postoperative complication rates).A total of 167 patients underwent LLR during the study period. Forty-eight (29 %) had cirrhosis, of which 43 (90 %) had hepatitis C. Most had Child-Pugh class A disease (85 %). Compared to noncirrhotics, patients with cirrhosis were older, had more comorbidities, and were more likely to have hepatocellular carcinoma. Precoagulation before parenchymal transection was used more frequently in cirrhotics (65 vs. 15 %, P < 0.001), and mean portal triad clamping time was longer (32 vs. 22 min, P = 0.002). There were few conversions to open surgery, though hand-assisted laparoscopy was used as an alternative to converting to open in three patients with cirrhosis. Blood loss was relatively low for both groups. Although there were more postoperative complications among cirrhotics (38 vs. 13 %, P = 0.001), this was almost entirely due to a higher rate of minor (Clavien-Dindo I or II) complications. Liver-related morbidity, major complications, and mortality rates were similar.LLR is safe for selected patients with cirrhosis. The added complexity associated with the division of diseased liver parenchyma may be overcome with some form of technique modification, including more liberal use of precoagulation, portal triad clamping, or a hand-assist port.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1007/s00464-016-4748-6\n\nView details for PubMedID 26895906\n\nAbstract\n\nThe risk of postoperative adverse events in patients with underlying cardiac disease undergoing major hepatectomy remains poorly characterized.The NSQIP database was used to identify patients undergoing hemihepatectomy and trisectionectomy. Patient characteristics and postoperative outcomes were evaluated.From 2005 to 2012, 5227 patients underwent major hepatectomy. Of those, 289 (5.5%) had prior major cardiac disease: 5.6% angina, 3.1% congestive heart failure, 1% myocardial infarction, 54% percutaneous coronary intervention, and 46% cardiac surgery. Thirty-day mortality was higher in patients with cardiac comorbidity (6.9% vs. 3.7%, P = 0.008), including the incidence of postoperative cardiac arrest requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation (3.8% vs. 1.2%, P = 0.001) and myocardial infarction (1.7% vs. 0.4%, P = 0.011). Multivariate analysis revealed that functional impairment, older age, and malnutrition, but not cardiac comorbidity, were significant predictors of 30-day mortality. However, prior percutaneous coronary intervention was independently associated with postoperative cardiac arrest (OR 2.999, P = 0.008).While cardiac comorbidity is not a predictor of mortality after major hepatectomy, prior percutaneous coronary intervention is independently associated with postoperative cardiac arrest. Careful patient selection and preoperative optimization is fundamental in patients with prior percutaneous coronary intervention being considered for major hepatectomy as restrictive fluid management and low central venous pressure anesthesia may not be tolerated well by all patients.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.hpb.2016.06.012\n\nView details for PubMedID 27593591\n\nAbstract\n\nAlthough most pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors are solid, approximately 10% are cystic. Some studies have suggested that cystic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors are associated with a more favorable prognosis.A retrospective review of all patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors who underwent operative resection between 1999 and 2014 at a single academic medical center was performed. Based on cross-sectional imaging performed before operation, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors were classified according to the size of the cystic component relative to the total tumor size: purely cystic (100%), mostly cystic (≥50%), mostly solid (<50%), and purely solid (0%). Clinicopathologic characteristics and recurrence-free survival were assessed between groups.In the study, 214 patients met inclusion criteria: 8 with purely cystic tumors, 7 with mostly cystic tumors, 15 with mostly solid tumors, and 184 with purely solid tumors. The groups differed in terms of tumor size (1.5 ± 0.5, 3.0 ± 1.7, 3.7 ± 2.6, and 4.0 ± 3.5 cm), lymph node positivity (0%, 0%, 26.7%, and 34.2%), intermediate or high grade (0%, 16.7%, 20.0%, and 31.0%), synchronous liver metastases (0%, 14.3%, 20.0%, and 26.6%) and need for pancreaticoduodenectomy (0%, 0%, 6.7%, and 25.0%), respectively. No cases of purely cystic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors were associated with synchronous liver or lymph node metastasis, intermediate/high grade, recurrence, or death due to disease. Among patients presenting without metastatic disease, 10-year recurrence-free survival was 100% in patients with purely and mostly cystic tumors versus 53.0% in patients with purely and mostly solid tumors; however, this difference did not reach statistical significance.Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors demonstrate a spectrum of biologic behavior with an increasing cystic component being associated with more favorable clinicopathologic features and prognosis. Purely cystic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors may represent 1 subset that can be safely observed without immediate resection.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.surg.2016.04.005\n\nView details for PubMedID 27216830\n\nAbstract\n\nTumors in the stomach have traditionally been treated with either subtotal gastrectomy or total gastrectomy, depending on the location. However, many of these lesions are benign spindle cell tumors or adenomas and could be resected with margins. Here, we explore multiple minimally invasive methods for the resection of these tumors. We highlight a wedge resection, a circumferential resection with transverse closure, a transgastric resection, and an endoscopic/laparoscopic submucosal resection. The wedge resection was performed in a 71-year-old man found to have a mass in the stomach on screening upper endoscopy. The biopsy was not definitive, but on CT scan there was a 4.5-cm submucosal mass consistent with a gastrointestinal stromal tumor. The circumferential resection was performed for an 83-year-old woman who had abdominal discomfort which led to an upper endoscopy. She was found to have a mass in the lesser curve of her stomach. Biopsy revealed this to be a gastrointestinal stromal tumor. Ultimately, it was removed when serial CT scans showed that it was growing. The transgastric approach was used for a 75-year-old man who had upper endoscopy for reflux symptoms and was found to have a mass in the stomach. Biopsy showed that it was a gastrointestinal stromal tumor. Due to patient preference, it was initially observed but was eventually removed when it was found to be growing on serial CT scans. The endoscopic/laparoscopic approach was for a 65-year-old man who had an upper endoscopy performed for work-up of melena and was found to have a 5-cm mass at the gastroesophageal junction. The biopsy showed this to be an adenoma, and he went on to have it removed.We identified representative videos from patients treated with each of the above techniques. Small exophytic lesions can be completely excised with a wedge resection using a stapler to fire across the base of the lesion. By contrast, if the lesion is in an awkward location or is too large to remove in this way, a vessel-sealing device can divide the mass from the stomach circumferentially (intragastric resection). The resultant defect in the gastric wall must be repaired transversely to avoid narrowing the lumen. Endophytic lesions can be treated with transgastric resection. Ports are placed directly into the stomach allowing excision from within the stomach. Finally, submucosal resection is ideal for lesions close to the GE junction. This combined endoscopic and laparoscopic approach allows the tumor to be lifted off the muscle fibers and to be resected without transmural injury to the stomach or esophagus.All four patients tolerated the procedure well and were discharged home by postoperative day 2. There were no complications. One patient, the one who underwent the endoscopic/laparoscopic approach and was preoperatively found to have an adenoma on biopsy, was ultimately found to have an invasive component and later underwent total gastrectomy. The other three patients all had gastrointestinal stromal tumors.Minimally invasive techniques should be considered more frequently for the management of benign gastric tumors. The four methods illustrated here can be used safely and result in faster recovery as well as shorter hospital stays compared to traditional approaches.\n\nView details for PubMedID 26423418\n\nAbstract\n\nMinimally invasive pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) remains an uncommon procedure, and the safety and efficacy remain uncertain beyond single institution case series. The aim of this study is to compare outcomes and costs between laparoscopic (LPD) and open PD (OPD) using a large population-based database.The Nationwide Inpatient Sample database (a sample of approximately 20 % of all hospital discharges) was analyzed to identify patients who underwent PD from 2000 to 2010. Patient demographics, comorbidities, hospital characteristics, inflation-adjusted total charges, and complications were evaluated using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Hospitals were categorized as high-volume hospitals (HVH) if more than 20 PD (open and laparoscopic) were performed annually, while those performing fewer than 20 PD were classified as low-volume hospitals.Of the 15,574 PD identified, 681 cases were LPD (4.4 %). Compared to OPD, patients who underwent LPD were slightly older (65 vs. 67 years; p = 0.001) and were more commonly treated at HVH (56.6 vs. 66.1 %; p < 0.001). Higher rates of complications were observed in OPD than LPD (46 vs. 39.4 %; p = 0.001), though mortality rates were comparable (5 vs. 3.8 %, p = 0.27). Inflation-adjusted median hospital charges were similar between OPD and LPD ($87,577 vs. $81,833, p = 0.199). However, hospital stay was slightly longer in the OPD group compared to LPD group (12 vs. 11 days, p < 0.001). Stratifying outcomes by hospital volume, LPD at HVH resulted in shorter hospital stays (9 vs. 13 days, p < 0.001), which translated into significantly lower median hospital charges ($76,572 vs. $106,367, p < 0.001).Contrary to fears regarding the potential for compromised outcomes early in the learning curve, LPD morbidity in its first decade is modestly reduced, while hospital costs are comparable to OPD. In high-volume pancreatic hospitals, LPD is associated with a reduction in length of stay and hospital costs.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1007/s00464-015-4444-y\n\nView details for PubMedID 26275542\n\nAbstract\n\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the impact of statin and metformin therapy on disease outcome for patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).This retrospective study included 171 PDAC patients who underwent surgical resection at the Stanford Cancer Institute between 1998 and 2013. No patients received neoadjuvant therapy. Statin and metformin use was defined as use during initial consult and continuing upon discharge from the hospital after surgery. Dose of each medication was recorded, as was the type of statin taken.The median follow-up for all patients was 11.23 months (range, 0.2-105.0 months). Among the 171 patients included in our analysis, 18 patients (10.5%) took metformin and 34 patients (19.9%) took statins. Statin use was associated with better overall survival (OS) in patients with PDAC (P = 0.011). Metformin use was also associated with better OS (P = 0.035). The use of statins remained significant on multivariate analysis for OS (P = 0.014; hazards ratio, 0.33; 95% confidence interval, 0.139-0.799), but metformin use did not (P = 0.33; hazards ratio 0.60, 95% confidence interval, 0.211-1.675).Statin and metformin use is associated with improved OS in patients with resectable PDAC. These medications should be further investigated for possible long-term use in the general population.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1097/MPA.0000000000000470\n\nView details for PubMedID 26474429\n\nAbstract\n\nSocioeconomic disparities in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) influence medical treatment. In addition to socioeconomic barriers, the Veteran population suffers from significant psychosocial obstacles. This study identifies the social challenges that Veterans face while undergoing treatment for HCC.One hundred Veterans at the Palo Alto VA treated for HCC from 2009 to 2014 (50 consecutive patients who underwent a surgical procedure; 50 treated with intra-arterial therapy) were retrospectively reviewed.Substance abuse history was identified in 96%, and half were unemployed. Most patients survived on a limited income [median $1340, interquartile range (IQR) 900-2125]; 36% on ≤ $1000/month, 37% between $1001-2000/month and 27% with >$2000/month. A history of homelessness was found in 30%, more common in those of the lowest income (57% of ≤$1K/month group, 23% of $1-2K/month group and 9% of >$2K/month group, P < 0.01). Psychiatric illness was present in 64/100 patients; among these the majority received ongoing psychiatric treatment. Transportation was provided to 23% of patients who would otherwise have been unable to attend medical appointments.Psychiatric disease and substance abuse are highly prevalent among Veterans with HCC. Most patients survive on a very meager income.

Despite several evidence-based practice guidelines for AP, our hypothesis is that many hospitals still use historical treatments rather than adhere to the current guidelines, which have demonstrated shorter hospital stays, decreased infectious complications, decreased morbidity, and decreased mortality.Seventy-eight patients transferred to our institution with AP from 2010-2014 were retrospectively studied to compare pretransfer versus posttransfer adherence to current practice guidelines. Primary measures included use of antibiotics (abx), enteral nutrition, drainage of asymptomatic pseudocysts, and interventions for necrosis in the early phase (<4 wk).Pretransfer, abx were given to 51 patients; however, posttransfer, abx were discontinued in 33 patients and started in 6 patients within 24 h of admission (pretransfer versus posttransfer abx, 51 versus 24, P < 0.001). Empiric abx for AP were used in 36 patients pretransfer versus 9 patients posttransfer (P < 0.001). Patients were initially nil per os or on total parenteral nutrition in 89%; this was reduced to 17% within 72 h by starting a diet or enteric feeds (pretransfer versus posttransfer feeding, 9 versus 65 patients, P < 0.001). Fifteen transfer patients had pseudocysts that were believed to \"require drainage\"; five patients received intervention but >4 wk from initial episode of AP. Pretransfer, five patients had pancreatic debridement in the early phase, which resulted in prolonged postoperative length of stay compared with eight patients requiring debridement, which were delayed (early versus late, 56 versus 16 d, P < 0.05).There is still great confusion in the treatment of AP in community hospitals. Primary principles in the care of these patients are not routinely followed despite established guidelines. Increased dissemination is required to prevent lengthy hospitalizations and long-term morbidity.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jss.2015.04.054\n\nView details for PubMedID 25972313\n\nAbstract\n\nTo examine the impact of major vascular resection on sarcoma resection outcomes.En bloc resection and reconstruction of involved vessels is being increasingly performed during sarcoma surgery; however, the perioperative and oncologic outcomes of this strategy are not well described.Patients undergoing sarcoma resection with (VASC) and without (NO-VASC) vascular reconstruction were 1:2 matched on anatomic site, histology, grade, size, synchronous metastasis, and primary (vs. repeat) resection. R2 resections were excluded. Endpoints included perioperative morbidity, mortality, local recurrence, and survival.From 2000 to 2014, 50 sarcoma patients underwent VASC resection. These were matched with 100 NO-VASC patients having similar clinicopathologic characteristics. The rates of any complication (74% vs. 44%, P = 0.002), grade 3 or higher complication (38% vs. 18%, P = 0.024), and transfusion (66% vs. 33%, P < 0.001) were all more common in the VASC group. Thirty-day (2% vs. 0%, P = 0.30) or 90-day mortality (6% vs. 2%, P = 0.24) were not significantly higher. Local recurrence (5-year, 51% vs. 54%, P = 0.11) and overall survival after resection (5-year, 59% vs. 53%, P = 0.67) were similar between the 2 groups. Within the VASC group, overall survival was not affected by the type of vessel involved (artery vs. vein) or the presence of histology-proven vessel wall invasion.Vascular resection and reconstruction during sarcoma resection significantly increases perioperative morbidity and requires meticulous preoperative multidisciplinary planning. However, the oncologic outcome appears equivalent to cases without major vascular involvement. The anticipated need for vascular resection and reconstruction should not be a contraindication to sarcoma resection.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1097/SLA.0000000000001455\n\nView details for PubMedID 26366542\n\nAbstract\n\nTo examine the impact of major vascular resection on sarcoma resection outcomes.En bloc resection and reconstruction of involved vessels is being increasingly performed during sarcoma surgery; however, the perioperative and oncologic outcomes of this strategy are not well described.Patients undergoing sarcoma resection with (VASC) and without (NO-VASC) vascular reconstruction were 1:2 matched on anatomic site, histology, grade, size, synchronous metastasis, and primary (vs. repeat) resection.

In addition to socioeconomic barriers, the Veteran population suffers from significant psychosocial obstacles. This study identifies the social challenges that Veterans face while undergoing treatment for HCC.One hundred Veterans at the Palo Alto VA treated for HCC from 2009 to 2014 (50 consecutive patients who underwent a surgical procedure; 50 treated with intra-arterial therapy) were retrospectively reviewed.Substance abuse history was identified in 96%, and half were unemployed. Most patients survived on a limited income [median $1340, interquartile range (IQR) 900-2125]; 36% on ≤ $1000/month, 37% between $1001-2000/month and 27% with >$2000/month. A history of homelessness was found in 30%, more common in those of the lowest income (57% of ≤$1K/month group, 23% of $1-2K/month group and 9% of >$2K/month group, P < 0.01). Psychiatric illness was present in 64/100 patients; among these the majority received ongoing psychiatric treatment. Transportation was provided to 23% of patients who would otherwise have been unable to attend medical appointments.Psychiatric disease and substance abuse are highly prevalent among Veterans with HCC. Most patients survive on a very meager income. These profound socioeconomic and psychosocial problems must be recognized when providing care for HCC to this population to provide adequate treatment and surveillance.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1111/hpb.12508\n\nView details for PubMedID 26374349\n\nAbstract\n\nNodal metastasis is a known prognostic factor for small bowel adenocarcinoma. The goals of this study were to evaluate the number of lymph nodes (LNs) that should be retrieved and the impact of lymph node ratio (LNR) on survival.Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results was queried to identify patients with small bowel adenocarcinoma who underwent resection from 1988 to 2010. Survival was calculated with the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate analysis identified predictors of survival.A total of 2,772 patients underwent resection with at least one node retrieved, and this sample included equal numbers of duodenal (n = 1,387) and jejunoileal (n = 1,386) adenocarcinomas. There were 1,371 patients with no nodal metastasis (N0, 49.4%), 928 N1 (33.5%), and 474 N2 (17.1%). The median numbers of LNs examined for duodenal and jejunoileal cancers were 9 and 8, respectively. Cut-point analysis demonstrated that harvesting at least 9 for jejunoileal and 5 LN for duodenal cancers resulted in the greatest survival difference. Increasing LNR at both sites was associated with decreased overall median survival (LNR = 0, 71 months; LNR 0-0.02, 35 months; LNR 0.21-0.4, 25 months; and LNR >0.4, 16 months; P < .001). Multivariate analysis confirmed number of LNs examined, T-stage, LN positivity, and LNR were independent predictors of survival.LNR has a profound impact on survival in patients with small bowel adenocarcinoma.

Intermittent pedicle clamping is an effective method to minimize blood loss during open liver surgery; however, inflow occlusion techniques are challenging to reproduce during laparoscopy. The purpose of this study is to describe the safety and efficacy of a facile method for Pringle maneuver during lapLR.154 patients who underwent lapLR from 2007 to 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. For Pringle, the hepatoduodenal ligament is encircled with an umbilical tape which is externalized through a flexible Rumel tourniquet running alongside a port used for the operation. The internal end of the catheter is close to the pedicle and the external end is extracorporeal, allowing for easy external occlusion. Patients who underwent Pringle Maneuver (PM, n = 88) were compared to patients who had \"No Occlusion\" (NO, n = 66) with respect to patient characteristics, operative outcomes, changes in postoperative liver function, and complications.Annual placement of the tourniquet and vascular occlusion increased from 35.7 to 82.8 % (p = 0.004) and 21.4 to 62.1 % (p = 0.02), respectively. Median occlusion time was 24 min (IQR 15-34.3, min 5, max 70). Peak transaminase levels were comparable between groups (AST 298 ± 32 vs 405 ± 47 U/L, p = 0.15; ALT 272 ± 27 vs 372 ± 34 U/L, p = 0.14, NO and PM, respectively). Postoperative transaminase and bilirubin levels for both groups were not significantly different with similar recovery to baseline. Subgroup analysis of cirrhotic patients who underwent Pringle demonstrated similar transaminase profiles compared to non-cirrhotic patients. There were two conversions (1.3 %) and postoperative 30-day mortality was 0.65 %.Extracorporeal tourniquet placement in lapLR is a quick and safe method of gaining control for inflow occlusion. Routine adoption of laparoscopic Pringle maneuver facilitates low conversion rates without liver injury.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1007/s00464-014-3801-6\n\nView details for PubMedID 25159645\n\nAbstract\n\nBetter diagnostic tools are needed to differentiate pancreatic cyst subtypes. A previous metabolomic study showed cyst fluid glucose as a potential marker to differentiate mucinous from non-mucinous pancreatic cysts. This study seeks to validate these earlier findings using a standard laboratory glucose assay, a glucometer, and a glucose reagent strip.Using an IRB-approved prospectively collected bio-repository, 65 pancreatic cyst fluid samples (42 mucinous and 23 non-mucinous) with histological correlation were analyzed.Median laboratory glucose, glucometer glucose, and percent reagent strip positive were lower in mucinous vs. non-mucinous cysts (P<0.0001 for all comparisons). Laboratory glucose<50 mg/dl had a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 57% (LR+ 2.19, LR- 0.08). Glucometer glucose<50 mg/dl had a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 78% (LR+ 4.05, LR- 0.15). Reagent strip glucose had a sensitivity of 81% and a specificity of 74% (LR+ 3.10, LR- 0.26). CEA had a sensitivity of 77% and a specificity of 83% (LR+ 4.67, LR- 0.27). The combination of having either a glucometer glucose<50 mg/dl or a CEA level>192 had a sensitivity of 100% but a low specificity of 33% (LR+ 1.50, LR- 0.00).Glucose, whether measured by a laboratory assay, a glucometer, or a reagent strip, is significantly lower in mucinous cysts compared with non-mucinous pancreatic cysts.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/ajg.2015.148\n\nView details for PubMedID 25986360\n\nAbstract\n\nLimited data are available on the implementation and effectiveness of NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines) for Gastric Cancer.We sought to assess rates of compliance with NCCN Guidelines, specifically stage-specific therapy during the initial episode of care, and to determine its impact on outcomes.The California Cancer Registry was used to identify cases of gastric cancer from 2001 to 2006. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard models were used to predict guideline compliance and the adjusted hazard ratio for mortality. Patients with TNM staging or summary stage (SS) were also analyzed separately.Compliance with NCCN Guidelines occurred in just 45.5% of patients overall. Patients older than 55 years were less likely to receive guideline-compliant care, and compliance was associated with a median survival of 20 versus 7 months for noncompliant care (P<.001). Compliant care was also associated with a 55% decreased hazard of mortality (P<.001). Further analysis revealed that 50% of patients had complete TNM staging versus an SS, and TNM-staged patients were more likely to receive compliant care (odds ratio, 1.59; P<.001). TNM-staged patients receiving compliant care had a median survival of 25.3 months compared with 15.1 months for compliant SS patients.Compliance with NCCN Guidelines and stage-specific therapy at presentation for the treatment of patients with gastric cancer was poor, which was a significant finding given that compliant care was associated with a 55% reduction in the hazard of death. Additionally, patients with TNM-staged cancer were more likely to receive compliant care, perhaps a result of having received more intensive therapy. Combined with the improved survival among compliant TNM-staged patients, these differences have meaningful implications for health services research.\n\nView details for PubMedID 25736009\n\nAbstract\n\nBecause duodenal adenocarcinoma (DA) is relatively rare, few studies have investigated the impact of resection type on long-term outcomes.The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was used to identify all patients between 1988 and 2010 with DA. Patients were divided into two groups based on the type of surgery received: simple resection (SR), defined as a simple removal of the primary site, and radical resection (RR), defined as removal of the primary site with a resection in continuity with other organs. Differences in disease-specific survival (DSS) and overall survival (OS) were compared.Of the 1,611 patients included, 746 (46.3 %) underwent SR and 865 (53.7 %) underwent RR. As expected, patients undergoing RR were more likely to present with poorly differentiated and large tumors, as well as advanced stage disease. Despite greater lymph node (LN) retrieval (11.0 vs. 6.8; p < 0.0001), RR was not associated with improved survival (5-year DSS and OS rates of 52.8 and 41.3 % for SR vs. 48.8 and 37.6 % for RR; p > 0.05). On univariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, the type of surgery was not associated with OS (odds ratio [OR] 0.98; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.87-1.11). Increasing TNM stages, tumor grade, fewer LNs removed, LN ratio, and absence of radiation were associated with worse survival. After controlling for confounding factors, type of surgery still did not influence OS (OR 1.11; 95 % CI 0.97-1.27).Radical resection (e.g., in the form of pancreaticoduodenectomy) does not appear to impact survival compared with simple segmental resection for DA.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1245/s10434-014-4020-z\n\nView details for PubMedID 25160736\n\nAbstract\n\nWe report updated outcomes of single- versus multifraction stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for unresectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma.We included 167 patients with unresectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma treated at our institution from 2002 to 2013, with 1-fraction (45.5% of patient) or 5-fraction (54.5% of patients) SBRT. The majority of patients (87.5%) received chemotherapy.Median follow-up was 7.9 months (range: 0.1-63.6).

Although minimally invasive techniques have been described and offer some promise, each has considerable limitations. This study assesses the safety and effectiveness of laparoscopic transgastric necrosectomy (LTN), a novel technique for the management of necrotizing pancreatitis.Between 2009 and 2013, patients with retrogastric pancreatic necrosis requiring debridement were evaluated for LTN. Debridement was performed via a laparoscopic transgastric approach using 2 to 3 ports and the wide cystgastrostomy left open. Patient demographics, disease severity, operative characteristics, and outcomes were collected and analyzed.Twenty-one patients (13 men, median age 54 years; interquartile range [IQR] 46 to 62 years) underwent LTN during the study period. The duration between pancreatitis onset and debridement was 65 days (IQR 53 to 124 years). Indications for operation included infection (7 patients) and persistent unwellness (14 patients). Median duration of LTN was 170 minutes (IQR 136 to 199 minutes); there were no conversions. Control of the necrosis was achieved via the single procedure in 19 of 21 patients. Median postoperative hospital stay was 5 days (IQR 3 to 14 days) and the majority (71%) of patients experienced no (n = 9) or only minor postoperative complications (n = 6) by Clavien-Dindo grade. Complications of Clavien-Dindo grade 3 or higher developed in 6 patients, including 1 death (5%). With a median follow-up of 11 months (IQR 7 to 22 months), none of the patients required additional operative debridement or had pancreatic/enteric fistulae or wound complications develop.Laparoscopic transgastric necrosectomy is a novel, minimally invasive technique for the management of pancreatic necrosis that allows for debridement in a single operation. When feasible, LTN can reduce the morbidity associated with traditional open necrosectomy and avoid the limitations of other minimally invasive approaches.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2014.04.012\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000342422500018\n\nAbstract\n\nTraditional open necrosectomy for pancreatic necrosis is associated with significant morbidity and mortality.

Thirty-day morbidity and mortality in patients on hemodialysis (HD) versus patients not on HD were compared. The impact of preoperative renal insufficiency, measured by glomerular filtration rate (GFR), on morbidity and mortality was then assessed in non-dialysis patients.Of 24,572 patients who underwent major abdominal operations, excluding emergency cases, only 149 (0.6 %) were on HD preoperatively. Thirty-day mortality in the HD group was 12.8 % compared to 1.8 % for those not on HD (p < 0.0001). Overall complication rate was 23.5 versus 12.3 % (p < 0.0001). In particular, rates of pneumonia (6.7 vs 3.0 %, p < 0.05) and sepsis (12.8 vs 5.3 %, p < 0.001) were higher in patients on HD. In patients not on HD, GFR was significantly predictive of postoperative mortality after controlling for age, gender, race, emergency status, and comorbidities. Compared to patients with normal preoperative kidney function (GFR, 75-90 ml/min/1.73 m(2)), even modest CKD (GFR, 45-60 ml/min/1.73 m(2)) was associated with increased postoperative mortality (odds ratio (OR), 1.62). With greater impairment in kidney function, postoperative mortality was even more marked (GFR, 30-45 ml/min/1.73 m(2) and OR, 2.84; GFR, 15-30 ml/min/1.73 m(2) and OR, 5.56). In addition, CKD was independently associated with increased postoperative complications.Any degree of preoperative kidney impairment, even mild asymptomatic disease, is associated with clinically significant increases in 30-day postoperative morbidity and mortality following major abdominal surgery.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1007/s11605-013-2390-3\n\nView details for PubMedID 24241964\n\nAbstract\n\nAdopting a unified staging system for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs) has been challenging. Currently, the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) recommends use of the pancreatic adenocarcinoma staging system for PNETs. We sought to explore the prognostic usefulness of the pancreatic adenocarcinoma staging system for PNETs.The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program data were used to identify patients with PNETs who underwent curative-intent surgical resection from 1983 to 2008. The discriminatory ability of the AJCC system was examined and a new TNM system was devised using extent of disease variables.In 1,202 patients identified, lymph node metastasis was associated with worse 10-year overall survival after resection (51% vs 63%; p < 0.0001), as was the presence of distant metastatic disease (35% vs 62%; p < 0.0001). The current AJCC system (recorded by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program in 412 patients since 2004) distinguished 5-year overall survival only between stages I and II (p = 0.01), but not between stages II and III (p = 0.97), or stages III and IV (p = 0.36). By modifying the T stage to be based on size alone (0.1 to 1.0 cm, 1.1 to 2.0 cm, 2.1 to 4.0 cm, and >4.0 cm) and revising the TNM subgroups, we propose a novel TNM system with improved discriminatory ability between disease stages (stages I vs II; p = 0.16; II vs III; p < 0.0001; and III vs IV; p = 0.008).In this study evaluating the current AJCC staging system for PNETs, there were no significant differences detected between stages II and III or stages III and IV. We propose a novel TNM system that might better discriminate between outcomes after surgical resection of PNETs.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2013.11.001\n\nView details for PubMedID 24321190\n\nAbstract\n\nEarly identification of patients at risk for developing pancreatic fistula (PF) after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) may facilitate prevention or treatment strategies aimed at reducing its associated morbidity.A retrospective review of 176 consecutive PD performed between 2006 and 2011 was conducted in order to analyze the association between the serum amylase on postoperative day 1 (POD1) and the development of PF.Serum amylase was recorded on POD1 in 146 of 176 PD cases (83.0 %). Twenty-seven patients (18.5 %) developed a postoperative PF: 6 type A, 19 type B, and 2 type C. Patients with a PF had a mean serum amylase on POD1 of 659 ± 581 compared to 246 ± 368 in those without a fistula (p < 0.001). On logistic regression, a serum amylase >140 U/L on POD1 was strongly associated with developing a PF (OR, 5.48; 95 % CI, 1.94-15.44). Sensitivity and specificity of a postoperative serum amylase >140 U/L was 81.5 and 55.5 %, respectively. Positive and negative predictive values were 29.3 and 93.0 %, respectively.An elevated serum amylase on POD1 may be used, in addition to other prognostic factors, to help stratify risk for developing PF following PD.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1007/s11605-013-2293-3\n\nView details for PubMedID 23903930\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Better pancreatic cyst fluid biomarkers are needed. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether metabolomic profiling of pancreatic cyst fluid would yield clinically useful cyst fluid biomarkers. DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Tertiary-care referral center. PATIENTS: Two independent cohorts of patients (n = 26 and n = 19) with histologically defined pancreatic cysts. INTERVENTION: Exploratory analysis for differentially expressed metabolites between (1) nonmucinous and mucinous cysts and (2) malignant and premalignant cysts was performed in the first cohort. With the second cohort, a validation analysis of promising identified metabolites was performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Identification of differentially expressed metabolites between clinically relevant cyst categories and their diagnostic performance (receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve). RESULTS: Two metabolites had diagnostic significance-glucose and kynurenine. Metabolomic abundances for both were significantly lower in mucinous cysts compared with nonmucinous cysts in both cohorts (glucose first cohort P = .002, validation P = .006; and kynurenine first cohort P = .002, validation P = .002). The ROC curve for glucose was 0.92 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.81-1.00) and 0.88 (95% CI, 0.72-1.00) in the first and validation cohorts, respectively. The ROC for kynurenine was 0.94 (95% CI, 0.81-1.00) and 0.92 (95% CI, 0.76-1.00) in the first and validation cohorts, respectively. Neither could differentiate premalignant from malignant cysts. Glucose and kynurenine levels were significantly elevated for serous cystadenomas in both cohorts. LIMITATIONS: Small sample sizes. CONCLUSION: Metabolomic profiling identified glucose and kynurenine to have potential clinical utility for differentiating mucinous from nonmucinous pancreatic cysts. These markers also may diagnose serous cystadenomas.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.gie.2013.02.037\n\nView details for PubMedID 23566642\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Better pancreatic cyst fluid biomarkers are needed.

We sought to validate the new system on a U.S. population database.California Cancer Registry data linked to the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development discharge abstracts were used to identify patients with gastric adenocarcinoma (esophagogastric junction and gastric cardia tumors excluded) who underwent curative-intent surgical resection in California from 2002 to 2006. AJCC/UICC stage was recalculated based on the latest seventh edition. Overall survival probabilities were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.Of 1905 patients analyzed, 54 % were males with a median age of 70 years. Median number of pathologically examined lymph nodes was 12 (range, 1-90); 40 % of patients received adjuvant chemotherapy, and 31 % received adjuvant radiotherapy. The seventh edition AJCC/UICC system did not distinguish outcome adequately between stages IB and IIA (P = 0.40), or IIB and IIIA (P = 0.34). By merging stage II into 1 category and moving T2N1 to stage IB and T2N2, T1N3 to stage IIIA, we propose a new grouping system with improved discriminatory abilityIn this first study validating the new seventh edition AJCC/UICC staging system for gastric cancer on a U.S. population with a relatively limited number of lymph nodes examined, we found stages IB and IIA, as well as IIB and IIIA to perform similarly. We propose a revised stage grouping for the AJCC/UICC staging system that better discriminates between outcomes.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1245/s10434-012-2724-5\n\nView details for PubMedID 23149854\n\nAbstract\n\nHospital readmission has attracted attention from policymakers as a measure of quality and a target for cost reduction. The aim of the study was to evaluate the frequency and patterns of rehospitalization after a pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD).The records of all patients undergoing a PD at an academic medical centre for malignant or benign diagnoses between January 2006 and September 2011 were retrospectively reviewed. The incidence, aetiology and predictors of subsequent readmission(s) were analysed.Of 257 consecutive patients who underwent a PD, 50 (19.7%) were readmitted within 30 days from discharge. Both the presence of any post-operative complication (P = 0.049) and discharge to a nursing/rehabilitation facility or to home with health care services (P = 0.018) were associated with readmission. The most common reasons for readmission were diet intolerance (36.0%), pancreatic fistula/abscess (26.0%) and superficial wound infection (8.0%). Nine (18.0%) readmissions had lengths of stay of 2 days or less and in four of those (8.0%) diagnostic evaluation was eventually negative.Approximately one-fifth of patients require hospital readmission within 30 days of discharge after a PD. A small fraction of these readmissions are short (2 days or less) and may be preventable or manageable in the outpatient setting.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1111/j.1477-2574.2012.00563.x\n\nView details for PubMedID 23297725\n\nAbstract\n\nTo identify and describe changes in spleen volume occurring in patients with colorectal metastases to the liver after partial hepatectomy.Forty-one consecutive patients (20 men, 21 women) with histopathology-proven colorectal liver metastases who underwent partial hepatectomy between August 2007 and April 2011 were included. Liver and spleen volumes were measured by computed tomography (CT) volumetry on the most recent CT prior to surgery and on all CTs obtained within a year after partial hepatectomy. Patients were carefully evaluated for and excluded if they had co-morbid conditions known to cause splenomegaly or risk factors for portal hypertension such as underlying liver disease and portal vein thrombosis.Thirty-two (78%) patients demonstrated an increase in spleen volume on the first post-operative CT, with more than a double increase in volume amongst five pati"
