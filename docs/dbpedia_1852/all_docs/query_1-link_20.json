        "text": "This article was originally published on Atlanta Business Chronicle on January 6, 2024.\n\nPrimary care is the initial and ongoing healthcare individuals receive from pediatricians, internal medicine or family care providers from prevention to the management of common health issues. Primary care fosters enduring patient-clinician relationships and facilitates specialized care when needed. Insufficient primary care can lead to delayed or inadequate medical attention, resulting in undetected health issues, unmanaged chronic conditions and increased reliance on emergency services—which can have significant cost impacts.\n\nWithout a robust primary care system, preventive measures, early intervention and continuity of care are compromised, contributing to poorer health outcomes, higher healthcare costs and strain on emergency resources. According to data compiled by the Kaiser Family Foundation, approximately 3.3 million—a third of Georgians— reside in an area grappling with a shortage of primary care. Recognizing the urgency and importance of addressing this issue, leaders from Wellstar Health System joined the Atlanta Business Chronicle for a panel discussion. The conversation delved into the crucial significance of primary care and the challenges that persist, shedding light on the need for strategic solutions in healthcare management.\n\nPanelists & moderator\n\nElise Lockamy-Kassim, AVP, Community Health & Center for Health Equity, Wellstar Health System\n\nDr. Dean Seehusen, chair of Family & Community Medicine, Wellstar MCG Health\n\nDr. Jeffrey Tharp, chief medicine division officer, Wellstar Medical Group\n\nDavid Rubinger, market president and publisher, Atlanta Business Chronicle\n\nReaching the population avoiding medical care\n\nDavid Rubinger: What strategies can community health providers use to reach out to individuals who haven’t sought medical care until they end up in the emergency room with a chronic condition? What specific approaches does Wellstar employ to effectively bring people into the healthcare system in a more manageable and proactive manner?\n\nDr. Jeffrey Tharp: Outreach is pivotal in addressing the root issues you mentioned. We understand that a person’s health significantly influences their lifestyle and quality of life. At Wellstar, we actively raise awareness, an integral part of the fabric that emphasizes the importance of a healthier lifestyle. Interestingly, insurance companies play a role in this by recognizing the cost benefits of keeping individuals healthy. Many insured individuals receive outreach, even in their homes, encouraging health assessments and connecting with primary care physicians.\n\nWellstar conducts numerous community campaigns through various channels, including community events, the media and in our offices and hospitals, highlighting the value of maintaining health and establishing a relationship with a primary care physician.\n\nElise Lockamy-Kassim: To add on to what Dr. Tharp said about reaching out to the community, we know health results are driven by non-health issues. The majority of our health outcomes are attributed to other things like where we live, where we go to work, where we send our children. Health literacy is needed outside health providers’ offices. Wellstar partners with organizations like Ser Familia to reach Spanish speakers and connect them with health resources in their community. Another example is our partnership with BLKHLTH. African Americans are about 20% more likely to get colorectal cancer and about 40% more likely to die from it than most other groups according to the American Cancer Society. Together, we distribute colorectal cancer kits to the community members that enable them to test and get results at home.\n\nRubinger: What factors contribute to men’s lower likelihood of seeking medical attention?\n\nDr. Dean Seehusen: It hasn’t been a cultural norm in America for men to seek out healthcare. I think part of it is also about the interaction that families have had with medicine over the years. Women get screening tests at a much younger age than men, like pap smears and mammograms, on a regular, ongoing basis. Considering traditional family dynamics, who also takes children to the doctor? Traditionally, it was the mother. She was going to the doctor herself annually, and men waited until they had chest pain for the first time. There wasn’t that equivalent of an annual exam associated with screening tests that men had in customary American medicine.\n\nRubinger: I’ve noticed a positive shift in the American health community acknowledging and addressing the reluctance of men to prioritize health check-ups. Recent advertising featuring athletes, unconventional in traditional public service ads, indicates a cultural change. How do you perceive the impact of technological advancements in further influencing the healthcare narrative and possibly addressing the healthcare-seeking behavior within the male dynamic?\n\nLockamy-Kassim: If I put on an equity lens, I could think of the male population as an underserved group in healthcare in certain ways. We’re addressing that, especially in the Center for Health Equity here at Wellstar, because we are bringing care, awareness, health literacy and health education to people where they are.\n\nWe’ve had many campaigns with people at churches and social service agencies where they just live their lives. We will bring the healthcare to you and that represents a shift. Across the industry, we’re returning it to where it used to be when you had a doctor make house calls. We see the benefits of that model.\n\nTelemedicine and accessibility\n\nRubinger: Amid the challenges of COVID, a silver lining is the increased accessibility of healthcare through telemedicine. The positive aspect lies in the enhanced efficiency of interactions and features like online scheduling. How has that changed how you all practice medicine?\n\nDr. Seehusen: Wellstar is leading the way in telehealth. We are contacting many rural parts of Georgia, not just the Augusta or Atlanta area. There’s a statewide network that we are reaching out to via telehealth that includes ICU and emergency care, and we’re even doing a lot of hospital-type care at home now. It’s paving the way for the future of what healthcare can look like.\n\nOn the flip side, when we try to deliver primary care via telemedicine, equity becomes an issue. There is a subset of our patients who do not have the hardware or do not live in a neighborhood that has Wi-Fi connectivity. There is still work to be done on the primary care side with telemedicine. Once you get into the more specialized care, we’re doing some fantastic things that I’m proud of.\n\nDr. Tharp: To echo Dr. Seehusen, what has been done at Augusta University has really led the way for much of what the rest of us have learned along the way. Virtual care is a skill set that primary care physicians rarely had before COVID—how to perform it or what was appropriate to do via telemedicine.\n\nThe access issue is a double-edged sword. It does help some people, but on the other hand, there are areas where broadband is not great, or you have elderly folks who may not know technology. We must ensure that we give appropriate care when it needs to be in-person versus virtually and provide access to technology to as many people as possible who can’t afford that luxury.\n\nLockamy-Kassim: Evolving patient needs have forced us to grow as innovatively and quickly as the industry grows. In a church setting, we provide broadband hotspots, laptops and free services to individuals we encounter. You’re going to learn the signs and symptoms of whatever health topic we’re addressing. We will give you the tools to access primary care. We’ve had to be creative with our funding and partnerships to make sure we’re not creating more inequity as we pursue this new space.\n\nDr. Tharp: An example of patient care improvement as a result of the pandemic, particularly with the diabetes epidemic, is the advent and promotion of virtual diabetic education classes. Previously, multi-hour comprehensive diabetic classes could be difficult to schedule with respect to work and family responsibilities and transportation. Having the ability to do all that virtually has increased people’s knowledge, and we’re seeing metrics improve in diabetic control, almost to the same degree as adding on another medicine. It’s a vivid example of how we’ve been able to use this technology and help people’s lives on the primary care side.\n\nThe value of having a primary care physician\n\nRubinger: Unfortunately, people would use their emergency room as their primary care physician. What can be done to help educate people on where they should go first, and how do you decide which care is best for your medical situation?\n\nTharp: There are different values when having a relationship with a primary care physician, such as access, quality of care and individualized care. When starting that relationship, there’s often an access problem since there are so few primary care physicians in the state and nation to accommodate our needs.\n\nOne tactic in building relationships with patients is connecting them with a specific physician or practice when they visit the emergency room. Although the process isn’t perfect, having a designated contact helps streamline communication. When a patient is identified, the initial step is knowing who to call, and from there, the referral process can begin. While it may not always be as fast as desired, establishing this relationship can also involve routing the referral through an urgent care facility in some instances. Having your own primary care physician can help you overcome some of the difficulty in navigating the U.S. healthcare system. Those benefits we see with that primary care patient relationship must start with knowing who to call.\n\nSeehusen: Once a patient has experienced primary care with a provider they regularly see, establishing a relationship with true continuity occurs. This provider ideally knows not just the patient but also their entire family and medical history. It’s about getting them into the door. Then, we must develop systems where, again, access exists. The faces are stable enough that even if it’s not the same one face, it’s at least a small team of clinicians who are seeing that patient repeatedly.\n\nA small team might be made of one physician and a couple of nurse practitioners and that small team really gets to know that patient and vice versa. You won’t have to convince those patients of the value of primary care. Those patients are much less likely to show up at an urgent care center or the emergency room because they know they want to see that team.\n\nLockamy-Kassim: While conducting our Community Health Needs Assessment, we held a Community Summit—a community-centered event similar to a focus group. With community members in each of our service areas, we identified access to care as a critical community challenge. One of the first aspects they mentioned as being the best asset in their community was the presence of a Wellstar Graduate Medical Education clinic or primary care facility. We know that neighborhoods are comprised differently. One of the ways that we can make entry points for primary care instead of the emergency room is to have primary care facilities in high-need ZIP codes.\n\nThis article was originally published on Atlanta Business Chronicle on November 3, 2023.\n\nAs cancer research advances, doctors know more about the keys to reducing cancer cases and driving better outcomes, like long-term survival. Prevention, early detection and treatment—an area that has drastically improved through scientific discovery—are the big three keys today. While preventative measures reduce the risk, screening for cancer before someone has symptoms can be a lifesaver when it is identified earlier and in more treatable stages. Newer, more advanced treatments and starting treatment faster are also making a sizeable impact on survival. For a closer look at how healthcare experts apply these keys in the fight against cancer, Atlanta Business Chronicle’s Market President and Publisher David Rubinger sat down with Wellstar leaders and patients for a sponsored panel discussion on the state of cancer care.\n\nPanelists & moderator\n\nDr. Bill Mayfield, MD, medical director, lung screening program, medical director, incidental pulmonary nodule program, medical director, STAT Clinics, Wellstar\n\nDr. John French, MD, medical oncologist, Wellstar and Northwest Georgia Oncology Centers*\n\nKathy DeJoseph, lung cancer survivor\n\nDavid Rubinger, market president and publisher, Atlanta Business Chronicle\n\n*Wellstar partners with Northwest Georgia Oncology Centers to provide world class cancer care close to home.\n\nKeys to better outcomes\n\nDavid Rubinger: Cancer is one of the top causes of death in the U.S., second only to heart disease, with 1.9 million new cancer diagnoses expected this year. The whole idea of trying to beat cancer is the common language of treatment now. We’ve really changed the conversation in many ways. Dr. Mayfield, what have been the keys to getting these better survival rates across all types of cancers?\n\nDr. Bill Mayfield: There are three basic components to improving outcomes and reducing cancer. Number one is prevention. How can you prevent cancer? Smoking cessation is a major way to reduce the risk for cancer, especially lung cancer. The second key is early detection screening for cancer such as colonoscopies, skin exams and low dose lung cancer CT scans.\n\nFinally, we have treatment as the third key. We have dramatically improved treatments, especially in the last 10 years, with targeted therapies, immune therapies and precisely targeted radiation therapy. For some cancers, reducing the time it takes to start treatment can be as impactful as some of the newer cancer therapies. At Wellstar, we speed up time to treatment through our STAT Clinics.\n\nRubinger: Dr. French, from the medical oncology standpoint, what has specifically gone on in your world since you started practicing medicine that you think has improved these outcomes?\n\nDr. John French: There’s no bigger story than immunotherapy in the last 10 years. It was 2017 when Jim Allison out of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and Tasuku Honjo in Japan won the Nobel Prize for cancer immunotherapy—the first time the Nobel in Medicine recognized a cancer therapy in decades. Wellstar and our patients participated in clinical trial development of immunotherapy for various cancers.\n\nIn medical oncology, there are also targeted therapies. In improving the survival and outcomes of patients, we do a lot of what we call next generation sequencing—tumor genomics and tumor DNA. The way I explain this is, “We’re not testing Kathy’s DNA. We’re testing the tumor itself. We are trying to find a lock and key mechanism, where if we can find what’s driving the cancer, maybe there’s a pill or a target that we can go after to take it out.”\n\nRubinger: Let’s move on to lung cancer in particular. Lung cancer has traditionally been known as a smoker’s disease—at least that’s how many people view it. It appears as though in the United States we’ve seen an improvement in terms of the number of lung cancer cases. Dr. Mayfield, where is the lung cancer discussion right now? I feel it was maybe one of these small victories that are going on in the cancer movement.\n\nDr. Mayfield: We do actually have some large victories. The surgeon general came out with a report in the 1960s that said smoking caused premature death and lung cancer. Men in Georgia started reducing their smoking about 35 years ago. As a result, we have 50% fewer male smokers and 35 years later, we’re now seeing a 50% reduction in primary lung cancers from tobacco.\n\nRubinger: As far as I understand it, early lung cancer is one of those cancers that has no outward physical markers that tell you you’ve got something going wrong. So as lung cancer specialists, what do you advise people to do when they’re getting their checkup? What is the process by which they should be screening for lung cancer?\n\nDr. French: The biggest thing you can do is if you’re smoking, stop smoking and get screened if you’re eligible. Dr. Mayfield discussed that already, but I’ll add some numbers and perspective.\n\nNumber two, if you were a smoker, understand the guidelines and recommendations to undergo screening. They updated the guidelines in 2021 that if your age is 50 to 80 and you have a 20 or more pack per year history of smoking, and currently smoke or quit within the past 15 years, then you’re eligible for screening.\n\nBy having a CT scan, you can reduce the risk of lung cancer death by up to 20% by identifying and treating cancer earlier.\n\nRubinger: Let’s talk to a lung cancer patient about this. Kathy, thank you for joining us. Take us briefly through your journey. What is your background with cancer?\n\nKathy DeJoseph: This year, I’m a 12-year survivor. Before I was diagnosed, I was a career person and I was on my computer one day and up popped information about this early lung cancer screening study that Wellstar was a part of. I had no symptoms. I had a long history of smoking, grew up with parents who smoked, grandparents who smoked, lived near a factory that was belching out junk into the air.\n\nI was a workaholic and a mom and I saw this study and for whatever reason, I called and talked to the nurse navigator. I was like, “I don’t know whether I want to do this or not. You know, this sounds like I’m going to end up paranoid about it.” She encouraged me to participate.\n\nDr. Mayfield: Kathy was enrolled in the study and had three or four normal CT scans before she developed a mass. And sure enough, we jumped right on it through Lung Cancer STAT Clinic and got her treatment plan together quickly. That was the point of her being in the annual screening study.\n\nWhat is a STAT Clinic?\n\nRubinger: Kathy, before we dive further into your treatment, will Dr. Mayfield help define the STAT Clinic? It’s not a simple thing to do. You all are very busy people and you all have individual schedules. To turn you all into this sort of troop, if you will, moving in sync, that’s a logistical nightmare for a bunch of doctors.\n\nDr. Mayfield: STAT stands for Specialty Teams and Treatments and it’s about bringing multiple cancer experts together to collaborate about a patient’s care and meet with them the same day so they can get treatment started quickly. We created STAT because we saw a need to do things better and to put the patient at the center of everything we do.\n\nAbout 17 years ago, we opened a general Thoracic Surgery practice at Wellstar Kennestone Regional Medical Center. And we did everything like everybody else did. We had a navigator—someone who connects a person who has cancer with the help and support they need. We had tumor boards—a group of physicians and scientists who meet to discuss treatment options for individual cancer patients.\n\nBut when we looked carefully, we saw that by the time the patient’s case was presented in a tumor board, it was 58 days on average from the time the patient had their original CT scan. They had gone from a primary care doctor to a pulmonologist to an oncologist back to the pulmonologist, then had a biopsy, a PET scan and then maybe saw a radiation oncologist. It was 58 days by the time they got to the tumor board and were able to get a treatment plan started. That’s a problem. But that is the standard of care in the United States today—60 to 90 days in this workup period.\n\nWe said, “There’s got to be another way.” I knew of a clinic run by a pretty notable oncologist in another state, who brought the thoracic surgeons, pulmonologists and the oncologist to his clinic to see the patient at the same time. An oncologist and I drove up there, spent the day, asked a bunch of questions and said, “You know what, we need to do this.”\n\nSo we came back and getting those specialists—the thoracic surgeon, pulmonologist, medical oncologist, radiation oncologist and navigator—in the same place at the same time was hard.\n\nWhat we decided to do is start with one hour on Wednesday afternoon. So we saw two patients one week, then 2 to 3 the next week and then 3 to 4 the next week. Then a primary care doctor heard about it and the pulmonologists heard about it and suddenly we were seeing 12, 15, 20 patients.\n\nA few years ago we surpassed more than 10,000 patient visits in the Lung Cancer STAT Clinic. And during that time, we started the lung screening program and the incidental nodule program.\n\nThe culmination of our initiatives to identify lung cancer earlier and hasten the time to treatment has reduced our time from abnormal image to starting treatment to somewhere between 14 and 20 days, rather than 60 to 90 days. The early detection program has made it such that 40% of the cancers diagnosed at Wellstar are stage 1 and 2, when cancer is more treatable and patients have better outcomes. On a national average, just 15 to 20% of lung cancer diagnoses are stage 1 or 2. We’ve dramatically improved the ability of our lung cancer patients in our community to survive their disease.\n\nRubinger: It sounds like early detection and shorter time to start treatment make a real impact for patients. Kathy, let’s talk a little bit about what those things meant for you as a patient. Let’s start with when you were diagnosed. Did you have any symptoms? What happened next?\n\nDeJoseph: I didn’t have any symptoms. Everything was fine, except for my history with smoking. The year I was diagnosed, I was going to quit the study but the nurse navigator took me out to lunch to convince me to come back—and thank goodness she did. I was diagnosed the very next day.\n\nThe biggest benefit for me with the way the STAT Clinic works is that I didn’t have to worry about whether the doctors had actually talked to each other. I didn’t have to worry about whether maybe they didn’t actually agree. All those things that I would have been worried about went away because I talked to all of them on the same day in the same place.\n\nIt gives you a lot of confidence. I thought, “Well, you know, they’d have to all be wrong on the same day at the same time to screw this up.” I ended up becoming a volunteer and would meet with newly diagnosed patients for several years. One of the biggest things that I would talk to new patients about is how STAT Clinic kept things from dragging out for months, going from doctor to doctor.\n\nRubinger: It sounds like STAT Clinic is meaningful to patients, not just medically, but emotionally. Is the STAT Clinic exclusively for people with lung cancer or are patients with other conditions benefitting from this model now?\n\nDr. Mayfield: That’s a good question. We added Lung Cancer STAT Clinics at Wellstar Cobb, Douglas and North Fulton Medical Centers. Outside of lung cancer, my neurosurgery buddy got curious. He’s saying, “Wait a minute. You know, we have this patient with brain cancer and they have to go see the radiation oncologist but your patient gets to meet the radiation oncologist at the same time as you. We want that.”\n\nSo the next STAT Clinic that cranked up was for neurological tumors. It was awesome to see that we could inspire other folks to do the same thing.\n\nDr. French: To add to that, we also have STAT clinics for breast cancer and head and neck cancer. All of these cancers require multidisciplinary care with doctors from different specialties who collaborate on patient care because otherwise, you have to go see different cancer subspecialists and that may take a longer period of time.\n\nDr. Mayfield: Here’s the dark secret about cancer care in the U.S. Dr. Alok Khorana at the Cleveland Clinic published a paper about three years ago. He studied 1.2 million cases in the national cancer database and 340,000 of those were lung cancer patients. He clearly showed that for every seven days’ delay in therapy in stage 1 or stage 2 disease, you lose 2% five-year survival. Delay in time to initial cancer treatment in the U.S. is an important risk factor for survival over time.\n\nA first-hand account\n\nRubinger: Kathy, let’s come back to you for a second. So you go into this STAT Clinic. Obviously, this whole process must have been terrifying on so many different fronts.\n\nDeJoseph: I wasn’t as terrified for as long as most people are because I had answers within a short period of time.\n\nRubinger: How short?\n\nDeJoseph: I had my biopsy the next morning after the first STAT Clinic appointment. About a week and a half after that, I started chemo. That was really fast. I had surgery after chemo.\n\nIn the STAT Clinic, every doctor comes in and talks to you. You learn what their role is going to be and what the timing will be with other treatments. It all happens at the same time. I took a lot of confidence in questioning everybody on the same day and knowing they had also talked together. I knew for sure that they had, where I would have really wondered about that if had I done it the normal way—visiting multiple specialists over a several-month period.\n\nRubinger: I’ll be the contrarian for a second. What if I walk into the STAT Clinic and say, “Well, I’d like to choose my surgeon. I’d like to choose my oncologist. I’d like to choose the radiation oncologist I want to use for my radiation treatment.” How much flexibility do I have within the STAT Clinic to select the doctor I want to work with? Or do I have to take the ones that are assigned to me regardless?\n\nDr. Mayfield: That is an excellent question. You can come to us for a consolidated opinion and get your care wherever you choose. You have four experts looking at you physically and reviewing all your imaging and all your tests together, coming to a consensus. For treatment, you can use any oncologist, any thoracic surgeon, anybody you want, even if it’s within our own institution.\n\nDr. French: Whether we’re providing the care or simply an opinion, STAT Clinic puts the patient first. We have patients from Alabama, Tennessee, North Georgia who can’t travel here for ongoing care. I’ve even had patients who live near the Carolina border. Part of the STAT Clinic is also handling the logistics where one of these patients may need treatment closer to home. For example, someone may need chemotherapy and I say, “OK, I’ll coordinate that with the medical oncologist in your area.” When we’re done seeing STAT Clinic patients, we agree, “You call the local radiation oncologist, I’ll call the local medical oncologist and let’s get them plugged in and connected with treatment recommendations.” Again, STAT Clinic expedites and coordinates all that care. Getting the foot in the door and getting that ball rolling is half the battle.\n\nThe state of screening and future goals\n\nDr. French: In talking about screening earlier, we didn’t address non-smokers. If I don’t smoke, I don’t need to be screened if I’m doing my well check-up and I’m not having a cough or chest pain. There’s really no screening for lung cancer outside of those recommendations.\n\nThat being said, the other thing that you need to understand is that in the state of Georgia, we are horrible at screening people. We rank toward the bottom quartile of the entire country in screening patients when it comes to the proportion of eligible patients. The American Lung Association data ranks Georgia 35th in the nation. We screen 5% of eligible people, so we’re not capturing 95% of people who could be screened.\n\nWe know the data to support screening is there. Kathy is a living example of this. Talk to your primary care doctor about your history with smoking and the need for screening.\n\nDr. Mayfield has ramped up the effort to capture more at-risk people through screening, but we still need to get the message out.\n\nDr. Mayfield: We started our screening program 15 years ago as part of I-ELCAP—the International Early Lung Cancer Action Project—and then we broke off of the study because the results were so positive. We decided we’re just going to do this as a standalone program in our community.\n\nAs a result, over the last 15 years, we become one of the three largest lung cancer screening programs in the U.S. We have about 15,000 people in our program currently.\n\nThe problem is, we serve a community of 1.7 million in 15 counties. Knowing that 40% of those are smokers or former smokers, we should be scanning a million people a year.\n\nWhy aren’t we screening more people? We’re a part of the Georgia Lung Cancer Roundtable and the National Lung Cancer Roundtable trying to solve that problem. I think it’s going to take a national awareness campaign.\n\nWhen that happens, we need to prepare our screening centers for high volumes. That will drive us from discovering more stage 3 and 4 lung cancers when people are dying, to finding more stage 1 and 2 lung cancers. Those earlier-stage cancers are much less expensive to treat from a policy and population health level and are easier to treat, giving more patients good long-term outcomes.\n\nRubinger: But we wouldn’t be screening non-smokers at this point.\n\nDr. Mayfield: There’s not enough data yet to guide us to any other risk factor than tobacco use.\n\nWhat employers should know about cancer\n\nRubinger: Let’s talk about the business community for a second.\n\nWhen it comes to the employee, when you see patients who are in full-time jobs, what role do you see the employer playing when you’re caring for cancer patients? What can employers do to help them in their battles?\n\nDr. Mayfield: I have a pretty strong opinion on two items. One is that employers should promote age-appropriate screenings for all cancers among their employees. Give them that half a day off if they need to go somewhere for a doctor’s appointment to get that screening exam. And as callous as it may seem, that half a day off to find cancer in earlier stages is much less expensive than treating an advanced cancer years later, from extended time off to the insurance costs associated with advanced cancer.\n\nThe CEO of the corporation, the vice president, the chief medical officer, the chief operating officer—they assume that if they or any of their employees get cancer care, they’re going to get the best care available. But unfortunately, the best care available today in most places is going to take them 60 to 90 days to get through the initial doctors’ visits and tests that at the STAT Clinic, we manage in 14 days.\n\nMy challenge to the business community is to ask their insurers and their healthcare providers a very difficult question, “How long will it take to get our employee from an abnormal finding to starting treatment?” When insurers and healthcare providers have to start answering hard questions, then we’ll move the ball.\n\nDr. French: I would add, when a corporation buys health insurance, it needs to make sure institutions that perform research and clinical trials are covered.\n\nI had a patient who had stage 4 prostate cancer and there is a clinical trial using novel bispecific immunotherapeutics. The guy is young; he’s eligible for the trial. The patient signed the trial consent only to find out that his insurance doesn’t cover the medical facility that’s offering it, so therefore he’s not eligible for the clinical trial. Now he’s going to have to get the standard of care, which is good. But he could have gotten something new on a trial if it was covered by his company’s health plan.\n\nSo, companies should first make sure that employees are covered for good quality healthcare and at top facilities that perform research.\n\nNumber two is, if you’re an executive, consider supporting on-site screening. I’ve seen a lot of patients in the STAT Clinic who get executive physicals, they get a day off and they do this comprehensive testing. Lo and behold it shows something. That early detection gets them to treatment at an earlier stage when the cancer is less advanced and they have a higher chance for better outcomes.\n\nSo consider offering a half-day, a health fair or on-site health screenings as part of your company’s health offerings.\n\nI think a healthy employee, one that feels valued and respected, will be a hard worker. If I feel that my business cares about me, my health, my life and my family, that sounds like a company I’d want to work for.\n\nLearn more about cancer care at Wellstar.\n\nThis article was originally published on Atlanta Business Chronicle on July 14, 2023.\n\nThe key to avoiding health problems is prevention, and the keys to prevention are annual checkups, regular screenings and vaccinations. With the start of the next school year looming in late summer, healthcare experts in Atlanta say it’s a good time for families to get back into the routine of scheduling and keeping these important appointments—not just for children, but for parents too, especially that one parent who tends to be the primary scheduler, often the mother.\n\nIn an Atlanta Business Chronicle panel discussion in partnership with Wellstar, physicians from Wellstar and Cobb & Douglas Health District discuss why checkups are important and how families can overcome obstacles to stay on track with preventative care.\n\nTaking care of the family and the family’s No. 1 manager\n\nDavid Rubinger, Atlanta Business Chronicle market president and publisher: When we think about family wellness and how it intersects with our daily work routines, it can get very complicated, given how busy working professionals are. We’re trying to figure out a way to manage not only our children’s health, and maybe our parents’ health if we’re in the sandwich generation, but our own health. The checklist is longer and longer every day. Let’s start with the basics. We’re a few weeks away from the start of school. Dr. Stinson, what are you telling your parents of kids of school age right now?\n\nDr. Carrie Stinson, Chief, Pediatric Service Line, Wellstar: The summer is a great time to get caught up on all the things that fall through the cracks during the busy school year. Our lives are very hectic, and when school starts back, things get even busier.\n\nOne big thing is the annual well-child exam. Every child should have a well-child exam every single year. When you have babies and toddlers, it’s routine — you’re scheduling these frequently. When kids get older and busier, these visits may feel less important and fall off your radar.\n\nWell visits are important every year. They focus on the comprehensive health and well-being of your child. Pediatricians focus on physical health, development, emotional, social, and even behavioral health. During these visits, the care team collects information on patient and family history, talks about developmental milestones and how your child is doing in school socially. We also assess sleep habits and nutrition. As they become adolescents, well-child exams become even more important as we ask questions about your child’s mental and sexual health.\n\nThose are important conversations to start having and your pediatrician can be a great facilitator. Sometimes parents are uncomfortable talking about those topics with their children even at an early, pre-adolescent stage, so those well checkups are really great places to get insight on how to approach sensitive topics.\n\nRubinger: Dr. Stinson, since COVID, tell me what you’re seeing that’s different in terms of talking to both parents and children. I am sure the pandemic took some families off their schedules for well checkups. How has the doctor-patient pediatric conversation changed over the past couple of years?\n\nDr. Stinson: What we’re hearing from our pediatricians since COVID is also what we’re hearing in the news. The behavioral and mental health crisis that we’re experiencing in this country has been really impactful on children, especially teenagers. During COVID, the social isolation of being out of school for periods of time had a significant impact on adolescents. The rise in social media popularity during that time also had a negative impact on pediatric mental health.\n\nOur pediatricians are really seeing that impact now. They’re feeling the strain our teenagers are experiencing. We’re seeing many more cases of depression and anxiety, and cases that escalate to dangerous proportions such as suicidal thoughts and actions.\n\nWe’re trying to respond to it by increasing the resources in our communities, but it’s hard to move fast enough to keep up with the demand. At Wellstar, we are developing an integrative model for behavioral health into our pediatric offices. Five of our pediatric practices will have embedded behavioral health professionals, so pediatricians can make direct referrals and patients have immediate access to behavioral health providers in their pediatric office setting.\n\nRubinger: Dr. Greaves, the mother might be the caretaker who takes care of the child. Most mothers would put their kid’s health ahead of their own health. Tell me what you are experiencing in terms of women’s health as it relates to those people who are the caretakers. What are the issues that they’re having to face to address their own needs?\n\nDr. Paula Greaves, Chief, Women’s Health Service Line, Wellstar: Women are usually considered the CEOs of their households and the drivers of healthcare in the community. Most women are the care bridge between several generations. They take care of their children, their parents, their partners and at times their communities.\n\nUnfortunately, they sometimes forget to take care of themselves. As physicians, it is our duty to ensure that women are made aware of the warning signs their bodies may be sending them and encourage them to seek help earlier to improve health outcomes.\n\nThere are nine signs that I tell my patients to watch out for:\n\nFatigue: Most women think, “Oh, I’m tired. It’s because I’m doing too much or I’m not getting enough sleep.” But fatigue can be a sign of something more than simply lack of sleep. It could be thyroid dysfunction. It could be menstrual irregularities causing them to be anemic and thus feeling fatigued. It could be heart disease. Fatigue could also be a sign of depression or menopausal symptoms. Every household should own a blood pressure monitor, and women should know their numbers (blood pressure, weight, and last menstrual period).\n\nWomen should be aware of physical changes within their bodies, including breast changes. Changes in the texture of the skin or a lump or pain in the breast should always be checked out.\n\nBloating is another subtle symptom to be aware of. Most women feel bloated and think, “Oh, it’s time for my menstrual cycle, so that’s why I am bloated.” But bloating can be a sign of a gastrointestinal problem or an enlarged pelvic organ. If you have bloating that doesn’t resolve after one or two cycles, let your doctor know.\n\nChest discomfort, shortness of breath and pain or discomfort in the jaw, neck, shoulder, or arm are also red flags. Heart attack signs and symptoms can be completely different in women than the typical ones seen in men. Heart disease is the number one killer of women, so it is very important that these signs are not ignored.\n\nLung cancer isn’t just a smoker’s disease. If you notice an unusual cough or wheezing, have it checked out.\n\nWeight changes: Either too much weight gain or unexpected weight loss should be mentioned to your physician. Fluid retention can also affect weight gain.\n\nBlood in the urine or stool should be reported.\n\nIrregular or heavy periods—heavy enough to change pads every hour or soil through clothes.\n\nSkin changes such as discolorations, new moles or growths are definitely worth having a professional take a look.\n\nRubinger: Is there ever a situation, Dr. Stinson, where you are treating a child and you see a mother whom you can tell is having health issues, even without an exam? As a pediatrician, do you ever say, “Hey, I think you need to get that checked out?”\n\nDr. Stinson: As pediatricians, we really focus on the whole family. While we’re seeing the child, we’re also interacting with the parents, guardians, grandparents, or whoever’s bringing the child in to see us on a routine basis.\n\nI think we often get questions from family members about their own health because of exactly what Dr. Greaves mentioned. People think, “I am in a doctor’s office. I don’t have time to go to my own doctor. Let me just see if I can get this question answered.\n\nWhile being careful not to give medical advice to a patient who is not ours or who is outside of our scope of practice as pediatricians, we are very willing to give recommendations on where that person should seek care. One benefit of our health system is we have the expertise to take care of patients from before they’re born until they need end-of-life care. We have a scope of providers within our system who can help with pretty much any problem that might come up. I would not hesitate to refer a patient to Dr. Greaves and say, “This mom is really worried about her own health. Can you please help? She’s very busy, but her symptoms sound concerning. Can you maybe work her into your schedule?\n\nI practice in the hospital, and we have sent several parents to the emergency room in our hospital for their own health while we’re taking care of their child in the pediatric unit.\n\nHow providers are addressing rising mental health needs\n\nRubinger: Dr. Memark, you get to look at this from the standpoint of two counties that are in great need of public health support. What are the trends that you’re seeing at a 30,000-foot view? What do you see within your communities that your organization tries to address?\n\nDr. Janet Memark, District Health Director, Cobb & Douglas Health District: From my point of view, one of the big things that we do at Cobb & Douglas Public Health is a large community health assessment. Dr. Greaves is actually a member of our board. We just finished a 2016-2020 five-year assessment. This was at the beginning of the pandemic, so keep that in mind. Our next assessment will capture 2021-2025. One of the things that was surprising to me was looking at causes of death in our communities. The assessment showed that in older people, it’s what you’d expect. For example, in Cobb County for those age 75 and older, the leading causes of death are things like vascular disease, stroke and Alzheimer’s. For ages 65 to 74, it’s heart disease and cancer. But when we started looking at the lower age groups, I was very surprised at what I saw:\n\nFor people in their 30s and 40s, the leading cause of death was accidental poisonings, and that includes drug abuse and drug overdoses. Number two was suicide.\n\nFor ages 25 to 34, number one was overdoses and poisonings and number two was suicide.\n\nFor ages 20 to 24, motor vehicle accidents were number one. Suicide was also number two for this group.\n\nFor 15 to 19, suicide took the number one spot. Number two was motor vehicle accidents.\n\nFor 10 to 14, number one was motor vehicle accidents followed by suicide.\n\nAfter the timeframe studied in the assessment, we went through two more years of the pandemic, which affected almost everyone’s mental health in one way or another. We’ve heard on the news how pediatricians in medical school are now being trained on how to provide more extensive mental healthcare because there just aren’t enough mental health experts.\n\nIt’s wonderful to hear Dr. Stinson say they are really trying to bolster up mental health screenings for our young people during their pediatric visits. I’d also like to add that we have high rates of maternal mortality in Georgia. The state Department of Public Health did a deep dive and found that mental health is a huge component of maternal mortality. You see these same themes of mental health running through several different medical specialties.\n\nThis article was originally published on Atlanta Business Chronicle on February 9, 2023.\n\nCardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, claiming more lives than all forms of cancer combined. Heart disease and stroke are among the forms of cardiovascular disease. In 2019, nearly 900,000 people died of cardiovascular disease in the United States, according to the American Heart Association. In Georgia, about 1 in 3 deaths are caused by cardiovascular disease, according to the Georgia Department of Public Health. Most of these deaths are premature and preventable. Atlanta Business Chronicle recently talked with a panel of experts from Wellstar Health System and the American Heart Association about ways to accelerate heart care progress through diversity and inclusion and finding better ways to fight heart disease through unconventional methods, early detection and education and through the workplace.\n\nPanelists & moderator\n\nModerator: David Rubinger, Market President & Publisher, Atlanta Business Chronicle\n\nRubinger: What is the best way to define heart disease? And what does it mean for our culture?\n\nDr. Vivek Nautiyal: Let me start by saying that heart disease or cardiovascular disease is a very broad term which include a wide variety of conditions affecting our heart and blood vessels. The most common type is coronary artery disease, which is usually caused by cholesterol plaque clogging the arteries, supplying blood to our heart. This is the number one cause of death in the U.S. and across the world.\n\nSome other types of heart disease include heart failure, which affects the heart muscle pump, heart valve disease and heart rhythm disorders affecting electrical activity of the heart. Vascular disease includes aortic aneurysm, and disease affecting neck arteries going to the brain or arteries going to the legs. All of these would broadly come under heart disease.\n\nThese conditions affect the ability of the heart to function properly and can lead to serious health problems such as heart attacks or stroke.\n\nRubinger: How much of that would we consider to be genetics and how much would we consider to be lifestyle, leading to the disease itself?\n\nNautiyal: Genetics is important, but I would say the vast majority are lifestyle-related. And that is why it's killing so many people. Heart disease is often the result of lifestyle factors like poor diet, lack of exercise, mental stress.\n\nAbout 4 in 10 U.S. adults currently are obese; 3 in 10 have high cholesterol; 4 in 10 have hypertension; 1 in 10 have diabetes. So, this is an epidemic. Adolescent and childhood obesity is on the rise and we in Georgia are sitting in the diabetes belt of the U.S.\n\nLack of awareness of these common risk factors often leads to delay in seeking preventive or medical care. You can have hypertension, high cholesterol, and diabetes for years or decades without knowing, which is why they're called silent killers. Unless you check for them, you may be blissfully unaware of your risk, until one day it leads to a major event.\n\nRubinger: It's very common to hear about examples where sometimes it can be genetic and other times it can be a lifestyle cause. Dr. Sacks, in your career, how have you viewed this whole conundrum of how to best approach heart disease?\n\nDr. Harvey Sacks: Getting back to your previous question, one form of heart disease we did not mention is congenital heart disease—malformations of the heart and blood vessels which occur at birth. As regards to lifestyle, when I started practicing cardiology, I saw patients in Paulding County. At that time, it was a rural community, but it is not so rural anymore but rather an extension of Atlanta. Many members of that community had a lifestyle consisting of poor dietary habits, lack of exercise, cigarette smoking and use of smokeless tobacco.\n\nWe began an educational process to teach people about healthy living. We socialized this into the community by giving talks to schools, churches and Rotary Club meetings.\n\nThe community bought into these new concepts, and we have made great progress. We have made significant changes as a result of this education in heart attack rates and cardiac mortality in that community.\n\nRubinger: Do we have any data to support that?\n\nSacks: We do. Since we have been seeing patients in Paulding County, data show a decrease in cardiac mortality. People understand the risk factors that contribute to the development of heart disease. And this trend is not unique to Paulding County. Similar efforts have been successful throughout the country. The American Heart Association (AHA) has helped us educate millions of people, and as a result, people are adopting healthier choices.\n\nUnconventional weapons: Collaboration, technology & more\n\nRubinger: From a medical standpoint, what have you learned from research that has helped deliver better outcomes?\n\nNautiyal: As Dr. Sacks was mentioning, we have made huge advancements in improving cardiovasular mortality and morbidity, especially in the Medicare population. There's clear evidence of that in the last two decades. One area where we are lagging behind is in the young population. Unlike the older population, in the younger population the event rates are either flat or going up.\n\nOne of the reasons for this is that traditional risk factor calculators tend to underestimate cardiovascular risk in young people. By young people, I mean below 50. So, if you are below 50 and you have family members who had premature events or if you have very high cholesterol, or if you are a woman with certain complications during pregnancy, then be aware that traditional risk factors will underestimate your cardiac risk. Also, younger people tend to have this sense of invincibility. You don't have any symptoms. You think, “I’m doing OK,” not realizing that silently, processes are going on in your body which one day will lead to a catastrophic event.\n\nAs part of an NIH-funded four-year study, led by the Mayo Clinic, we at Wellstar are implementing a shared decision-making electronic tool called CV Prevent Choice in our primary care offices. This enables the patient and physician to have a discussion about their personal risk for heart attack over next 10 years. It shows in an easy-to-understand graphic the impact of lifestyle measures, like healthy diet and exercise and—if needed—medications, in reducing their cardiac risk. We collaborated with the Mayo team to include factors on this risk calculator, like family history, women-specific risk factors and coronary calcium score, which alerts the clinician and patient that actual risk may be higher than indicated.\n\nAnother area where we in the U.S. lag behind is utilization and adherence to easily available life-saving therapies. A recent study showed that in over 600,000 commercially insured patients with established cardiovascular disease in the U.S., the utilization of appropriate, life-saving medications, such as statins, was low, despite overwhelming evidence of the benefit and established clinical guidelines. Only 1 in 5 patients received appropriate high-strength statins, despite these being relatively inexpensive generic medicines. Younger patients and female patients were less likely to receive these therapies. Furthermore, patient adherence, as measured by prescription refill rates, was low.\n\nTo better understand some of the factors behind this and also improve our quality of care, we at the Wellstar Center for Cardiovascular Care are honored to have been chosen by the American Heart Association, to be 1 of 6 healthcare organizations across the country to participate in an integrated cardiovascular cholesterol management initiative, a learning collaborative grant. As part of this initiative, we will track patients admitted with heart attacks and follow them as they transition home. We will pilot programs to get patients to their treatment goals within a short time after discharge and improve patient outcomes.\n\nRubinger: Mr. Mooney, why aren’t people taking their statins? Is this part of the problem? Are people making bad decisions based on lack of education about what the risk factors are?\n\nMooney: There are a lot of factors that play into why patients are not adhering to taking statins or medications. Some of those barriers are health literacy, access to healthcare, and the affordability of medications. The expansion of Medicaid could address some of these factors. We at the American Heart Association are supporting the states that are advocating for Medicaid expansion.\n\nRubinger: What have been the major technological changes that have really made your jobs more effective or easier?\n\nSacks: There are different kinds of technology. One type is the evolution of the treatment of coronary heart disease. We are not only able to diagnose blockages in coronary arteries, but in a large proportion of the patients we can treat them with stents, reserving surgery for more extensive and complex heart disease. We are treating patients with valve abnormalities without having to open their chests, thus providing a much less invasive procedure.\n\nA spot on the lung, or pulmonary nodule, is sometimes found incidentally on a CT which was ordered for another reason. We have an AI (artificial intelligence) program to follow and surveil these nodules for the possible development of lung cancer. And in addition, some of these patients have been found to have enlargement of their aorta (known as an aortic aneurysm). AI can identify these patients from a narrative report. They can then be referred to medical and surgical specialists for treatment. This helps prevent an otherwise fatal event from rupture of the aneurysm.\n\nThe other part is virtual visits. We believe that virtual visits are the future. There are so many people who for many, many reasons cannot come in to see the doctor, whether it's a transportation issue, whether it's having childcare, finances, whatever it may be. We want to bring those technologies to the person when they can't come to us. We believe that we can really influence people's lives greatly by being able to do that technologically by virtual visits.\n\nRubinger: And virtual medicine was something really born out of the pandemic. Is the concept of virtual medicine here to stay, Dr. Nautiyal?\n\nNautiyal: I believe so. The idea was there before, but the pandemic forced us into implementing it a very short time span. Now I think it's going to stay, but in a hybrid model. In-person conversation and physical exams still have meaning in spite of all the technology. An example of a hybrid model would be if someone was hospitalized recently for heart failure and now needs frequent visits for adjusting medications, they don't have to come in every time. We can do virtual visits to adjust the medications and get them to their goal.\n\nSacks: Psychological ill health can be as important as physical disease. Wellstar has introduced a Cardiovascular Behavioral Health program which can in part be virtual. It integrates behavioral health with physical wellbeing. We can help patients identify emotional problems which can contribute to physical maladies. Obesity is a prime example.\n\nObesity is often stigmatized, but it is actually a disease. And when you recognize it as a disease, you can treat it as such, similar to how we can treat other conditions. We can do a lot of this support virtually. We also have medications to curb obesity and even surgery for complex cases. If we eliminate the stigma associated with certain conditions, we can better treat them. We need to recognize emotional triggers which can lead to physical medical issues.\n\nPrioritizing early detection\n\nRubinger: You mentioned earlier younger people who may think they’re invincible. These are the people who need to learn about early detection, earlier on in their lives. What is the recommendation you all give to the younger population to start monitoring their own heart health to know whether they need help? What are the steps younger people need to take to make sure they are addressing these issues?\n\nNautiyal: I would like to highlight two key groups who are at a very high personal risk of heart attacks or strokes. One is familial hypercholesterolemia. This is a genetic condition where you have high cholesterol levels since early childhood. The way to identify this is to know your cholesterol numbers and know your family history. Familial hypercholesterolemia, FH for short, is not as uncommon as we thought. One in 250 people have FH, and only about 20% of people with FH have been identified or recognized. This leaves a vast reservoir of undiagnosed and undertreated people. If you are a man with untreated FH, there is a 50% chance of having a heart attack by age 50, that is basically a coin flip. Women with untreated FH have a one in three chance of having a heart attack by age 60.\n\nThe second group is people with family history of premature heart attacks or strokes.\n\nIf you are in one of these two groups, I would strongly urge you to seek preventive cardiology consultation.\n\nRegardless of whether or not you belong to one of these two groups, I cannot emphasize enough the importance of following a heart healthy dietary pattern, exercising regularly, not smoking, getting adequate sleep and knowing your numbers—blood pressure, cholesterol and sugar levels.\n\nOn a positive note: know that your DNA is not your destiny. If you treat FH adequately early on in life, you can have a healthy and long life without any cardiac problems. Similarly, and this has been well studied, even among people who have a cluster of genetic mutations predisposing them to heart attacks (high polygenic score), following a heart-healthy lifestyle can reduce their risk by 50%. Again, your DNA is not your destiny.\n\nAt Wellstar, we also offer a robust 'Know Your Heart' screening program for the general public to schedule an appointment. The advanced version of this includes a CT coronary calcium score. For specialized care, we have a Preventive Cardiology office, where we offer evidence-based, patient and family-centered care with a multidisciplinary team including a cardiologist, dietician, clinical pharmacist and geneticist. Our cardio-genetics program has the highest volume of patients in Georgia.\n\nMooney: Through programs like Kids Heart Challenge at the American Heart Association, which partners with schools to help prepare children for success by empowering them to embrace a healthy lifestyle—eat well, move more and stay tobacco free. The Kids Heart Challenge prepares elementary students for future success both physically and emotionally. Through cardio-pumping physical activities, kids learn the importance of being heart-healthy. Participating schools and/or teachers receive discounted certificates for PE equipment, direct contributions to their school and new curriculum resources for whole-child centered learning. Healthy students are better learners; teachers and schools have a major influence on students’ health, and the Kids Heart Challenge is designed to support and improve those efforts.\n\nOne other AHA program, Target BP (blood pressure), using the M.A.P. (measure accurately; act rapidly; partner with patients, communities) Framework is connecting the community to clinics. This program here at the American Heart Association is designed to work with clinicians with improving how blood pressure is measured, developing treatment algorithms to improve uncontrolled blood pressure. This program’s framework was used to train barbers and stylists in an initiative called “Do You Know Your Numbers?”\n\nWe worked in barber shops and salons, faith-based and community-based organizations to install blood-pressure monitors and train them on how to use them. In the barbershop we talk about sports, families, children, so within that conversation it was simple to bring up “do you know your numbers?” And once they asked that question, and their clients are interested in knowing their numbers, they are able to screen those clients for high blood pressure. The people who need medical care are connected with health centers or clinics.\n\nIt has worked and it has grown and it's nationwide. We sent this national hypertension project throughout so many different communities, whether rural or urban. We find that bringing in that community component helps get patients to seeing their clinicians.\n\nEducation to reduce the numbers\n\nRubinger: Education about cardiovascular disease risk factors clearly plays a big part in helping people avoid making bad decisions. What programs or initiatives have had the biggest impact?\n\nSacks: If there is a group of people that we have significantly impacted, it is women. Mr. Mooney can speak to this too. You know, if you ask a woman what is she most likely to die from, she will probably tell you breast cancer or uterine cancer. But the truth is she is most likely to die from heart disease. The AHA has highlighted this with their Wear Red Day events and other programs. Women have come to understand their cardiac risk, and that their symptoms of heart disease may differ from those of men.\n\nMooney: I would agree with you on that. The information, as it relates to women dying of heart disease, is really the approach of addressing social determinants of health.\n\nAnd quality improvements are really about self-management. For example, with the blood pressure project, it is a way of educating the patients, empowering the patients to take control of their blood pressure through what the doctors have shared with them. Talking to and educating these patients, as in the example Dr. Sacks gave in Paulding County, helps them know what are those factors that impact their health, such as healthy eating, access to care, also access to medication.\n\nWe're discovering in this hypertension research project that these populations would not have had access to blood pressure monitors outside of the doctor's office to get true blood pressure readings. That's self-measurement. Now these devices, when they check their blood pressure, it automatically links up into their EMR systems. It's all about time: the patient comes from that (screening) to a follow-up appointment. Doctors have a real clear big picture of what the patient’s true blood pressure readings are, and that's where it goes into better treatment plans as it relates to physical activity, diet, and so forth.\n\nSacks: That recent study involving stationing pharmacists in predominantly African-American owned barber shops demonstrated the power of education. They screened patrons’ blood pressure. A large number of men, with no prior medical history, were found to have significant hypertension (high blood pressure). These individuals were then placed on medication. It was an amazing study because they were able to identify, educate and treat these patients thus reducing their risk of heart attack and stroke.\n\nRubinger: The key here is my numbers. My primary care physician needs be looking at those numbers closely, even though I am a younger person, because they're the bridge to getting referred to take care of these conditions. Is the primary care system addressing the hard health issues in cardiac care?\n\nNautiyal: When we started the Preventive Cardiology Program about two years ago, we took a holistic or multi-pronged approach for this very reason. When thinking of cardiovascular risk in the population, you can imagine a pyramid. At the base of the pyramid are people with traditional risk factors like obesity, high blood pressure, high cholesterol. As you move up this pyramid, you will have more serious risk factors—for example, diabetes—and at the tip of the pyramid would be people with familial hypercholesterolemia or family history for premature heart disease, who are fewer in comparison to the base, but have highest personal risk.\n\nWe'll make the most impact by focusing on the base, because that's where the most patients are and that can be addressed adequately at the primary care level or through community-led initiatives.\n\nAnd we at the Wellstar Preventive Cardiology Program are engaging with our primary care colleagues to accomplish this through the initiatives I mentioned earlier, helping them in their own preventive strategies and identifying those at the tip of the pyramid, with higher personal risk who will benefit from specialized preventive cardiology care.\n\nMooney: That's what the American Heart Association is all about: bringing awareness on heart disease to rural and urban communities and vulnerable populations. We are developing science based tools and resources for clinicians and providers to keep them informed with the current research and what's going on out there, as well as providing educational tools in all languages for their patient population.\n\nWe discovered that patients heard the numbers but didn't know what they meant and didn't know how they impacted their bodies. We design educational materials for these patients to really understand the consequences of high blood pressure for any literacy level. For example, in some workshops with patients and the community, we may use infographics of a home water hose connected to a street fire hydrant as an example of blood vessels to the heart and/or a boxer beating the kidney to give a visual of what high blood pressure does to the body organs. Blood pressure has impacts on your entire body. Giving the visual, just keeping it simple and straight to the point.\n\nRubinger: It's all about trust, right? They have to trust the medical system. There are certain communities that in the past have not trusted the medical establishment.\n\nMooney: Absolutely. That's why we are such a big proponent of diversity in the workplace and bringing young scholars, HBCU scholars, historical black institutions and biomedical students into this arena, connecting them with cardiologists and scientists throughout their undergrad, up into medical school and up into their careers. That's key. And that's important because getting out there in the community is key to building that trust. People trust people who are very familiar with their environment.\n\nExpanding heart care to diverse groups\n\nRubinger: That need to build trust between the medical profession and certain communities leads me to another issue: the disparity in different groups when it comes to obtaining medical care. How can our cardiac experts help close the gap in this area?\n\nMooney: The AHA has put a lot of money and research and grants focused on science-based solutions to address health inequalities through, for example, our Health Equity Research Network on Prevention of Hypertension.\n\nI'm research-focused on cardio and oncology working in underserved communities and bringing forward awareness of the connection of heart disease and cancer, as well as putting our money back into the community to support community-based organizations that are addressing social determinants of health that could assist with improving overall cardiovascular health as it relates to addressing food insecurity, vaping advocacy work that we do in school systems throughout the country and also where we are invested into people. We're working with our historically black colleges and universities, identifying those underrepresented in the medical field and enlightening them to also become representatives in the medical field to help improve overall health and communities throughout the nation. We've been committed to that, and we're very much committed to that.\n\nAs it relates to the training for our providers and clinicians through quality improvement programs such as “Get Down With Your Blood Pressure” and our cholesterol control program as well, we are providing the research and the educational tools for providers and for patients to assist health systems. We'll start on improving blood pressure with other health systems throughout the United States and particularly in the metro Atlanta area.\n\nSacks: If we needed a reminder about health equity, certainly the pandemic provided us with that experience. The mortality from COVID was much higher in the African-American and Latino communities. There is a saying that a parent is only as happy as their least happy child. Similarly, the medical community should only be satisfied if everyone has access to healthcare.\n\nWe must do a lot more than we are doing to ensure a better distribution of our resources. That is our obligation as healthcare providers. We need to deliver healthcare to those who are unable to come to us, but who nonetheless are in need of our services. We need to go to them.\n\nWinning in the workplace\n\nRubinger: How important is the employer towards helping deliver on some of these messages to their employees?\n\nSacks: From the business standpoint, employers need to offer more health and wellness opportunities for their employees. And why is that? Because if they do, their workers will spend more time at work and less time at home, sick. They will spend less time in the emergency room because of adopting a healthier lifestyle and medical conditions will be identified sooner. The more businesses can promote these kinds of internal programs, the more an employee realizes 'my employer really cares about me; they really want me to be healthy.' It's a win-win for everyone, so those programs need to be much more widespread and offered to more people.\n\nMooney: The American Heart Association has workplace programs where we work with employers throughout the nation and throughout Georgia. Also we work with organizations just in in terms of broadening or expanding the pool of applicants, or those in leadership, to be able to be a representation of the community in which they serve.\n\nThis article was originally published on Atlanta Business Chronicle on August 19, 2022.\n\nCancer is the second-leading cause of death in the United States, with more than 600,000 people dying of cancer in the country in 2021. While the U.S. death rate, or the percentage of people dying from cancer, is decreasing — partly due to fewer people smoking — the number of cancer deaths is going up due to our aging population. All these statistics are behind the call to decrease cancer deaths by 50% in the next 25 years. Atlanta Business Chronicle recently talked with a panel of experts from Wellstar Health System and the American Cancer Society, headquartered in Atlanta, about ways to accelerate cancer care progress through scientific research, patient care, partnerships, early detection, diversity and inclusion, and local care.* (Remarks edited for clarity and brevity.)\n\nPanelists & moderator\n\nModerated by David Rubinger, market president and publisher, Atlanta Business Chronicle.\n\n*Wellstar partners with Northwest Georgia Oncology Centers to provide world class cancer care close to home.\n\nResearch & treatment\n\nDavid Rubinger: Where are we today in the world of scientific research? Are we in a good place in terms of research dollars?\n\nKimberly Jackson: I think we’re in a good place, but we can always be doing better and that’s a fact. There’s no other nongovernmental, nonprofit organization in the United States that’s focused on finding the cause and cures for cancer like the American Cancer Society. We’re committed to continuously funding the best new and ongoing projects at institutions across the country. For instance, right now in Georgia, we are currently funding eight research multi-year grants that are totaling more than $6.3 million. In addition to funding and conducting research, we are mobilizing our grassroot network advocates to increase the funding for cancer research. We’re primarily supporting those investigators that are early in their career, who are doing the most innovative cancer discovery research.\n\nRubinger: While the aging population is causing the cancer deaths to increase, the average death rate for the population has actually decreased. What do you attribute recent successes to and how will we continue to fight cancer deaths in the future?\n\nDr. Steve McCune: The mission of the Wellstar and Northwest Georgia Oncology Centers partnership is to help cancer patients live longer by providing innovative therapies in their local communities. What we have seen in the last 10 years has revolutionized the treatment of certain cancers, particularly lung cancer and melanoma, with immunotherapy and targeted therapies, oral drugs that address a gene mutation. What may be a good way to think of that is it’s the Achilles heel for certain cancers: they have one gene that drives their growth. And there are, because of the research that has occurred, typically one or more drugs that may specifically treat that mutation and block it so that it no longer encourages the growth of cancer cells.\n\nNext-generation sequencing makes it very easy and fast to sequence 400 to 500 genes in a tumor from an individual patient, so that you know exactly any gene mutations in that particular tumor. It’s the most individualized medicine you could have. That’s the reality and that’s very accessible for many patients.\n\nRubinger: Nicole, from the nursing standpoint on the front line with patients, how has immunotherapy changed the relationship between the patient and the healthcare provider psychologically?\n\nNicole Centers: From the patient care perspective, it’s very clear that patients are more involved in their care. They want to have more say in their care. When we can educate patients appropriately up front about all of their different options and their care along with their providers, they feel like they have more control. We know when patients feel more in control of their care, they’re more compliant to the plan of care. When it comes to immunotherapy and monoclonal antibodies that are given, they’re generally tolerated far better than chemotherapies of the past. That doesn’t mean everything can be treated with an immunotherapy or monoclonal antibody. However, when we have more options to give patients that they can tolerate better, then it kind of alleviates all of those nightmares of, “This is a horrific journey,” and, “It’s not going to work for me.” Overall, we have medicines that work with your body to fight the cancer in ways that we just haven’t had before.\n\nPatient care & partnerships\n\nRubinger: The cancer “moonshot\" is a term that excited everyone. Have you seen the concept of patient care change from when you first got into the field to where it is today?\n\nMcCune: I think it’s dramatically different. In some ways the moon shot has already happened and I'll explain what I mean by that.\n\nImmunotherapy revolutionized the treatment of cancer. If you have a chemotherapy that kills 99% of cancer cells, well that means eventually that 1% keeps coming back. Immunotherapy can work for years, even after the actual immunotherapy has stopped. It’s not a vaccine, but it works in much the same way that a person’s own immune system actually can control or eliminate the cancer. I think that, in a sense, was the biggest game changer for the way that people were treated.\n\nI started doing this about 20 years ago. And so most things that we treated were chemotherapy, very few things that were actually what we would have called targeted therapy or intelligently designed targeted therapy. The first drug was really coming out at that time called Gleevec, which treated CML (chronic myeloid leukemia.) I treated patients before that era who had to have a bone marrow transplant or they were basically going to die of CML. And now we think of CML as a condition that’s almost 100% survivable. We have eight different medicines that are commercially available for treating CML. It’s totally changed the future for some patients who would have had very poor outcomes otherwise.\n\nMelanoma used to be very difficult to treat. Chemotherapy didn't work well. A treatment called Interleukin-2 worked for about 8% of patients and no one really knew why. It basically is an early immunotherapy but with a lot of toxicity. Now you have drugs like Opdivo, Yervoy, Keytruda, which are really the standard of care. Chemotherapy is rarely, if ever, used for melanoma.\n\nThere are antibody drug conjugates — something that basically has a payload on the monoclonal antibody, so it homes in on certain proteins on the outside of different cancer cells. That’s a way of delivering a toxin directly to the cancer cells with less impact on normal tissues.\n\nThere are companies all over the United States, from large to small, that are really driving the innovation in targeted therapies, antibody drug conjugates, so it’s an exciting time in oncology.\n\nWellstar has participated in trials for 15 years. In just the last three years, we have participated in cancer trials resulting in over 20 FDA approvals for either new medicines or new combinations of medicines. Usually, it is four to five years before something is FDA-approved. Now not everything’s approved, not everything works better, but it gives people hope and it gives them the chance to have cutting-edge therapies in their local communities.\n\nRubinger: Nicole, how have advances like these changed the psychology of talking with a patient with a cancer diagnosis?\n\nCenters: I think it has changed. When I started in this field 20 years ago, we would say “the breast cancer down the hall\" or “this is the breast cancer treatment.” Now we say, “the patient with breast cancer,” “the patient with lung cancer,” and we treat it as an illness that is part of the whole person, versus the whole person being the illness. That’s a different way that we think about things and that’s how we approach our patients differently when it comes to nursing.\n\nThere’s a very unique field inside of nursing called navigation. And one of the things that moonshot really promoted was something that we've been out here doing for a pretty good while, but it brought it to the center stage for all Americans to hear this word called a navigator. It meant someone that was going to guide you on your cancer journey. Several years ago, there was just one kind of navigator and they tried to do the whole care path, but we at Wellstar recognize that there’s lots of pieces to people who could have cancer, people who are being tested for cancer, and those patients that actually have cancer. So we have screening navigators, we have diagnostic navigators, and we have actual care trajectory navigators, which are oncology nurse navigators. We have over 15 of those in our system and some of those specialize by tumor type and some of those are more generalized.\n\nWhat they do is they actually bring the whole person into view during their care. It means if you have childcare or if you have your parents, that you're taking care of first, or that transportation is an issue, these navigators work with you and your provider as well as your payers, whether it’s insurance or if you don't have insurance, we try and get you on insurance — to be sure that those things that would affect your compliance to the plan of care, they're helping you resolve.\n\nIt’s great if you can come in for your treatment. But if your dog has to be walked at two o'clock every single day and your treatment starts at noon, then we need to help you get a dog walker. We need to help you link to resources. For years there have been resources out there that patients didn't even know to utilize. And so organizations have this money that’s sitting there trying to help patients, but no one to link them to it. Navigators link patients to community resources, to national resources. The American Cancer Society has this really great program that will offer patients free rides to go get their cancer care, and most patients don't even know about that. But you talk to the navigator and they're like, “Wait, I have them on speed dial” because they get to know what those resources are, and they can help patients keep their appointments and keep a total life balance.\n\nWhen we look at that, what that does is it makes their care more effective because they're more compliant to the plan of care.\n\nThe other thing navigators do is to help timeliness of care. So if two providers talk and say “we're both going to go see Sally Sue,” or whoever your patient is, and they turn to the front desk and say, “be sure we get this patient on the schedule.” However, the front office staff may not be aware the appointment doesn't meet the latest benchmark for timely care. So what a nurse navigator does is say, “Wait, we have some timeliness to care parameters that we know are best practice.” And they work with that provider or that office to help expedite those appointments.\n\nThe best part of navigation is it really brought care back into the patient’s community. Patients didn't understand what was available to them in their community. They thought you had to go to an academic center in a large city that cost them lots of money because they had to stay in hotels or take a flight or go get a car, because there’s so many patients in the states that don't have valid transportation that can take them two hours away. Navigators help patients understand what’s available in their community and the care that they can receive. They can also link them to clinical trials, arrange for assisted lodging and help patients get the best care out there to survive their cancer.\n\nWe've also seen an uptick in clinical trials because the navigators say, “Do you remember when your doctor talked to you about clinical trials? Do we want to circle back on that? And do you want to go talk to your doctor again?\" They're reinforcing that education.\n\nSecond opinions & local care\n\nRubinger: Let’s move to another topic: the second opinion. The second opinion might be local, but if you have the resources, it might be at Sloan Kettering, MD Anderson or Mayo. Is there less of that going on today because local providers are able to provide that level of confidence in what the care is going to be? Twenty years ago you would have maybe run to Houston.\n\nMcCune: I think people still do, but maybe for a different reason. I think they have more information and more knowledge and they're not just running to Houston, they're running to a specialist in Houston or New York or Atlanta. I say, “Hey, you're not stepping on my toes. I want you to get a second opinion. I can help you get that, more than just a cold phone call. Let me try to get you to the right person.”\n\nAt Wellstar, we do have Mayo Clinic Care Network e-consults available. That’s a pretty easy way to get a quick question answered if we need a specific answer or a second opinion without someone having to travel somewhere.\n\nIn addition to second opinions, we believe in collaborative care. We have groups of cancer experts who diagnose and plan treatments together in tumor boards so patients have the best outcomes. In Specialty Teams & Treatments (STAT) Clinics, multiple cancer specialists meet with the patients and their families in one place on one day to help them get questions answered. This helps them start treatment faster so they have better outcomes.\n\nCenters: At Wellstar, 300 cancer specialists in our network can collaborate with each other. When they do request second opinion e-consults from the Mayo Clinic, it is free to patients which is a really nice thing because they usually have to pay for second opinions.\n\nRubinger: Kimberly, when I think of the Cancer Society, I think of the research dollars going to help cure cancer. But as we were talking earlier about how it helps with driving patients to treatment, the society’s partnerships with a Wellstar or other healthcare systems may be less well known. Can you address that?\n\nJackson: Collaboration is absolutely critical. So many cancer patients and their families are facing barriers and challenges that are too complex for just one organization to address on its own. To help overcome those barriers, we unite organizations in partnership to improve the lives of people facing cancer.\n\nOne example, we have Hope Lodges all over the country where individuals and a family member are able to stay for free and they're wonderful. It’s a great resource for our patients and their families.\n\nAnother example is we partner with Wellstar and other health systems in Georgia to provide those transportation grants that Nicole talked about and service to people who need it the most.\n\nFor some people with cancer, transportation is a challenge and it creates that barrier to receiving the treatment that they need. Many of them need daily or weekly treatment and often over the course of several months and the need was particularly pronounced during the pandemic. We were able to provide funding to 251 health systems across the country to alleviate that financial burden of transportation.\n\nAnother way we mobilize the cancer community on both the national and the local level is through our mission-critical roundtables. We're providing organizational leadership and expert support to multi-organizational roundtables focused on breast, cervical, colorectal and lung cancer, HPV vaccination and patient navigation. Each roundtable has a shared vision to support people to prevent and support and survive cancer. It’s a proven model close to home. Wellstar Health System was a key partner in launching our Georgia Lung Cancer Roundtable, whose primary goal is to improve screening rates and lung cancer outcomes.\n\nRubinger: Our society has come a long way in terms of reducing smoking. What are the trends in lung cancer that you're seeing? Does it primarily impact your older patients or is it across the age spectrum?\n\nMcCune: It can be any age and certainly there are people who are non-smokers who are much more likely to have a lung cancer that is driven by a single gene mutation and those are usually treatable with targeted therapy, which is typically an oral drug. So, in one sense, lung cancer is a disease of people who have smoked for a long time, 30 or 40 years. But it’s also a disease of nonsmokers. I do think people are generally smoking less. I remember people used to smoke in the pediatrician’s office when I was little. Things have changed dramatically.\n\nThere is a very active lung cancer screening program at Wellstar through the thoracic surgeons and the pulmonary physicians. It looks at people who have had some smoking history, who are typically at more risk for developing lung cancer. They'll have a low-dose screening CT scan, and we do see a number of lung cancers get discovered earlier. That’s a worthwhile initiative when something is surgically curable, as opposed to it’s gotten so advanced that people are having symptoms.\n\nThe pandemic impact – screenings & DEI\n\nRubinger: During the pandemic, I didn't see my doctors as often. None of us did. It was harder to access healthcare the way we did before. What has that done?\n\nCenters: The pandemic did change us. A lot of screening procedures at the beginning of the pandemic were paused, but we were still able to quickly to return to those services. But the temporary delay made some patients think that screening wasn't as important as it once was. We really worked hard to get the message out there about the importance of early detection.\n\nWe use a lot of automated tools like our lung nodule software to help us identify nodules in patients who come into our system for other reasons and have those incidental findings. We also work with our church network here at Wellstar. We work with BLKHLTH in Atlanta, and there’s lots of healthcare organizations that are reaching out to their communities to get people back to screening.\n\nWe at Wellstar have made a very concerted effort to go back out and say, “We have kit testing that you don't have to come into the hospital to have done. You can do that at home. Let us help you get the kits.” We reopened our screening mammography centers with all the safety protocols in place. And then we called the patients and said, “Hey, you missed your cancer screening.”\n\nWe did see an initial dip because if you're not screening, you're not finding it, as cancer usually doesn't hurt. So most people don't know that there’s something in there growing. Now we're seeing patients come in with later stages, or more advanced tumors than we traditionally would have seen. That’s because of the lag in screening.\n\nRubinger: Kimberly, is this consistent with what you've been seeing?\n\nJackson: Yes it is. Early during the pandemic, cancer screening rates decreased dramatically and an estimated 35% of Americans missed routine cancer screening due to Covid-19-related fears and care disruptions when many facilities reduced or suspended services. Screening rates remain below historical averages. In addition to the coronavirus, top barriers to screening are that individuals have no symptoms, procrastination, lack of recommendation, cost, and no insurance. During the pandemic we worked with healthcare systems to address the issue as part of the “Get Screened” initiative. Through donor support, we were able to provide $2.2 million in grant funding to 77 health partners to implement quality improvement strategies to rapidly increase cancer screening rates and reduce the barriers that have been exacerbated through the pandemic. Wellstar was one of our partnering health systems in the Get Screened initiative. They were able to increase their breast cancer screening rate by 6.8 percentage points, which resulted in over 44,000 people in Georgia being up to date with their breast cancer screenings.\n\nRubinger: One of the crises in our society is the ability that people have to access care. When you think about those things from the DE&I perspective, where do we see the biggest challenges and where are the biggest opportunities?\n\nJackson: While the pandemic is shining a light on the issue, the reality is if we were focusing on having more diverse physicians, nurses, etcetera, if we were focused more on removing the barriers and investing more, we would have fewer people who are getting diagnosed at later stages, or, you know, unfortunately losing their lives to cancer. That’s a fact. There’s an opportunity right now that we cannot shy away from. The evidence is there to show the tie between the impact on an entire community by ensuring equitable health for all by focusing on the ones that need the most is actually equalizing and improving the health of the community itself.\n\nRubinger: I'm curious what role can the employer play?\n\nJackson: The employer, they have team members and staff that make up the community that we're seeking to serve. So what they can do immediately is educate the employees on the resources that are available on the prevention side. They can also make prevention a priority and establish norms of only offering healthy snacks, for example.\n\nAs well, they can encourage employees to go to their doctors, and also for the top leaders to serve on these boards and these councils of the hospitals and organizations like the American Cancer Society, to be aware and to stay ahead of the issues and to be informed and proactive about helping the community.\n\nCenters: There’s really three ways to look at equitable care, and it’s not a one-path journey. First off, there’s a screening environment and the diagnostic environment, getting people to the services where they are and getting them access to care.\n\nThe second part is a mistrust of the healthcare system, which is ingrained in many of our societies across the U.S., so educating them to the safety parameters we have in place to ensure that all patients have equal access to care.\n\nThe third component is to teach our healthcare providers, be they nurses, medical assistants, physicians, about diversity and the things that happen to patients who maybe don't look like you, that walk through the door. What we know is, especially among our patients of color, that when they come in, sometimes their complaints aren't taken as seriously as others. We see that in the national studies.\n\nWhat we have to do is educate our providers and our healthcare workers, but also educate our patients to say “you are your own best advocate.” If you go to a doctor and you're not getting the care that you think that you need or you deserve, then you can go to another place or else you can reach out to your patient advocates at the facility that you're going to. At Wellstar, we have invested a lot of time and energy into educating all staff so that all patients who walk through the door regardless of their social standing, regardless of what they look like, regardless of their history, are all treated equitably, and we do our best.\n\nRubinger: Dr. McCune, anything to add on that topic?\n\nMcCune: Yes. We have a diverse group of research coordinators, both African-American and native Spanish-speaking, so I do think there are opportunities to narrow some of those health gaps. I will say the pandemic across the board affected clinical trial enrollment, because there are typically more procedures like more CT scans that a person has to go through to go on a clinical trial, than just receive what we would call standard of care therapy. So across the board, that is something that has reduced clinical trial participation and that is starting to come back.\n\nBut I do think you have to meet people where they are. We obviously have a health system that covers some urban to rural areas in Georgia. One of the things that we're able to do is take clinical trials to people who are as far west as Carrollton, as far north as Cartersville, or closer to the Atlanta area in Marietta, Austell and Douglasville. We're expanding that research network as well.\n\nNot everybody can drive two hours. Not everybody has a family member who can drive them when they're too sick. Access to care is a huge list of things that don't sound like much but a ride to the doctor’s office, a ride to a CT scan is the difference between someone getting care or not getting care. It’s things that seem little but are really not.\n\nWhen you were talking about what can corporations do, I'll just say, it seems like most people’s experience is very dependent on whether the human resources person is nice to them. From the patient’s point of view, either “they're working with me and I can show up,” or “if I have a bad day, I can just stay home,” or “they fired me yesterday.” So maybe just a little bit of grace there. People have their federally mandated leave but they need more than that. They need a little attitude of caring or just going the extra mile, to help somebody get through their cancer treatment. They'll probably be a better employee and grateful if you treat them nicely."
