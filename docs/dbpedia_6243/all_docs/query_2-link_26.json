That's the question Eric Volkman poses at dailyfinance.com.\n\nStern is well known for airing his gripes with current employer SiriusXM. As Volkman points out, not long ago, his management became the target of his anger after (SiriusXM) had agreed to a later start for his regular live broadcast, but then conditioned this upon his renewing his current contract with them. Since then, Stern has strongly hinted that he won't do so. Volkman opines that the satcaster isn't as dependent as it once was on Stern, but his departure would no doubt shake up that industry.\n\n'It's no stretch to say that Stern was a key figure responsible for taking that medium out of this world -- literally,' says Volkman. 'Satellite radio came into its own near the end of the 20th century, but it wasn't really a viable business until he became part of it. He signed his first contract with in 2004. Since then the company grew its revenue to over $4 billion last year from $242 million in 2005, he reports.\n\nThat was then. This is now. Today there are a growing number of podcasts, internet broadcasters and so much more. Imagine if Stern took his talents to yet another platform like he did with his move to satellite? What would happen if Stern were picked up by Google or Apple once their streaming audio services began to invade the dash? With the artist Drake recently rumored to be in talks for $19 million deal to guest DJ for iTunes Radio, imagine what they would pay for someone like Stern to broadcast full time? Sirius XM Radio is \"committed to keeping\" Howard Stern and NFL content when their current deals with the satellite radio firm expire at the end of 2015, CEO Jim Meyer told the Goldman Sachs Communacopia investor conference on Thursday.- READ FULL ARTICLE HERE\n\nMOTION: Jimmy Steele Named SVP/Prog.

Yesterday he joined Larry Gifford's Radio Stuff podcast to further explain and defend his comments.\n\nAfter devoting a good portion of the interview touting his background and expertise in music scheduling, Hill reiterated his now famous salad analogy saying he's been using this comparison for over 20 years. \"if playing 80% of females got me the highest ratings, I’d run over you in a hallway to put a female record on the air .. I would walk over broken glass and chew razor blades to get to the studio and deliver what the audience will line up for.” He repeated his claim of receiving death threats from country fans and, with regard to blowback from female country artists, he said he'd like to sit down and listen to Martina McBride about her concerns of what he said.\n\nMartina has yet to reply to the offer, but both her and Sara Evans continued with their own comments with Evans posting: 'Cheers to my fellow \"tomatoes' and Martina adding 'Proud Tomato' tweet.
