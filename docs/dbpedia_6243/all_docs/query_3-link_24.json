        "text": "Formula Nippon is aiming to change to an all new chassis in 2013. The current generation of Swift built cars will be replaced by a new machine which features a Formula 1 style kinetic energy recovery system (KERS) and potential a drag reduction system also. Small capacity four cylinder turbo engines are also likely to feature in the new machines, as the series aims to become the second fastest open wheel category in the world.\n\nHonda and Toyota have already started running a Zytek KERS on adapted Swift chassis in recent weeks and the final decision on the timing and manufacturer of the new car is not expected until the summer. Lola, Dome and Swift are all thought to be in the running for the lucrative contract. The series aims to expand all around the Pacific rim and may change its name as a result, it also hopes to encourage new manufacturers to the series, specifically those from India and China.\n\nHiroshi Shirai one of the leading figures in the organisation of the championship reveals the plans in the latest issue of RCE.\n\nTrue. Although iirc Sky were quite serious about it at the beginning -- this wasn't some Eurosport commentators in a studio talking over the world feed job.\n\nHaving a pay TV deal didn't hurt World Superbikes in the 1990s in the slightest, although bike audiences pretty much knew what it was they'd be getting. A1 GP's circumstances were very different -- new series, new ideas, unfamiliar drivers. It's not surprising an audience never developed. Now if they'd convinced the BBC to send their cameras down to the inaugural Brands Hatch round in 2005, instead of the GP Masters adventure...\n\nWho paid for the series? Did teams survive entirely on the Sheikh's largesse? There was supposed to be country-specific sponsorship but that idea was daft.\n\nThey all went for the quick buck from PTV rather than building up a follow-ship and making it a viable, monetary wise, series. Don't know about WSB, stopped following bikes when Norton stopped racing.\n\nIMHO Formula 2 is in the final state of an agony. Our dear friend Max pushed it forward to show his muscles and compete with non-FIA GP2. It is an epic fail. Although the concept itself seemed to be a good one it has never become what it was supposed to be. Somebody said here he was missing Palmer Audi. Well, mate, F2 is nothing else than Palmer Audi on steroids, if you haven't noticed it. And talking about its value, there is only one question - how many drivers had used F2 as a springboard to somewhere? Yeah, winners have had a possibility to test Williams F1 car but so what? What have they made out of it?\n\nTalking about F2 as a stepping stone towards F1, Robert Wickens is perhaps the only driver ever raced in FIA F2 who still has some chances to reach a GP start one day. From this year field maybe 15-year-old wunderkind Mathéo Tuscher can develop himself into a real prospect. Series leader Luciano Bacheta is doing a solid job but look at who are his opponents. He really has nothing to cheer about, the overall level is lamentable and grids small.\n\nFIA F2 is now in its 4th year and it will be a wonder if it will continue next year. OK, maybe as an addition to the BTCC package or something. Initially they were racing together with WTCC but then decided to split and become \"independent\". It is easy to blame dr Palmer with the hindsight we have now but did he seriously thought F2 can survive on its own?"
