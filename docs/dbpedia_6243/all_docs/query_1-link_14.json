Announces Preliminary Net Valuations on Dolomite Reserve, excess over $2B!\n\nIndependent Third Party Reports Robust Market Valuation in Excess of 2 Billion Dollars\n\nhttp://finance.yahoo.com/news/cgrowth-capital-inc-announces-preliminary-202210365.html\n\nSILVERDALE, Wash., July 28, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via PRWEB - CGrowth Capital, Inc. (OTC Pink: CGRA) (the \"Company\") is pleased to announce preliminary results and net valuations on its magnesium dolomite reserve. Taking into account the physical characteristics of the site, water tables, and anticipated mining expenses, the immediate probable mineral reserve has been set at 63% of the initial survey reserve of 505m cubic yards -- which calculates out at 420m tons of material -- significantly exceeding initial expectations. The estimated economic benefit from the site, after accounting for royalty, reclamation, and loss, has been estimated at a net value of approximately $2.7 billion.\n\n\"As anticipated, this is further proof that we have acquired a very special site with a versatile material that will open up a tremendous amount of opportunity for us,\" stated Bill Wright, CEO of CGrowth Capital, Inc. \"The amount of material that can be extracted presents us with a generational project and opportunities that we did not previously have. Identifying the larger bulk sales channels and securing proper asset-backed financing are our next two hurdles. While there is a great deal of work to be done, we have made a very positive step forward towards our next goals,\" he continued.\n\nAs a base material, Magnesium Dolomite has a variety of uses and applications in a broad range of industries from horticulture to construction to pharmaceuticals and healthcare. Expansive market growth in construction and healthcare in particular, may help drive the market value of the reserve, while potentially expediting its commercialization.\n\nWright concluded, \"We have spent the last few years identifying and acquiring assets that would provide us with a broad base and large upside potential. Now is the time for us to shift gears and move from strategy to execution as we begin to monetize these assets. We have all of the pieces in place and we are ready to aggressively go to market and realize unprecedented value for our shareholders\".\n\nOne World Holdings, Inc. (OWOO) Capturing Market Share in Dolls via Highly Unique & Ethnically Diverse Role Model Designs\n\nDolls make up one of the largest chunks of the roughly $22 billion U.S. market for traditional toys at around 10.5% of the overall space. Dolls did roughly $2.22 billion in 2013 and approximately $2.32 billion last year, representing a four percent growth rate according to market research company NPD Group’s (formerly National Purchase Diary) consumer panel tracking data, which is published by the Toy Industry Association. NPD Group is consistently ranked as one of the top 25 companies on the annual Honomichl Top 50 report covering Fortune 500 market research firms and thus the above data, which represents roughly 80% of the U.S. retail toy market, gives investors a very clear picture of the market’s size and growth.\n\nWhile Mattel (NASDAQ: MAT) has historically been the dominant player in the doll market – owing to established brands like Barbie and newer, still-growing brands like Monster High, as well as temporarily hot but nevertheless exciting successes linked to Disney Princess brands like Frozen – their mainstay brand Barbie has been in significant decline since 2012 according to retailer panel data compiled by mass retail analyst firm Klosters Trading Corporation. Private company MGA Entertainment, known for their Bratz, Moxie Girlz, Rescue Pets plushies and lifelike baby dolls marketed through a partnership with Zapf Creation (ETR/FRA: ZPFK), has also seen substantial decline in recent years according to the Klosters data, clearly telegraphing how fragmented the doll market has become, a phenomena which has opened up substantial room for newer brands and concepts to grow and flourish.\n\nOne such company is One World Holdings, Inc. (OTC: OWOO), whose Prettie Girls! brand, developed and marketed under their subsidiary known as The One World Doll Project, continues to capture attention and retail space in the attractive and still niche market for ethnically diverse dolls, a segment that has been routinely, yet unsuccessfully courted by major sector players. The most recent example of how ham-fisted major players like Mattel have been in this area is the PR nightmare surrounding their Mexico-inspired Barbie for their “Dolls of the World” collection, which was lampooned by the media and consumers alike as essentially being a cynical cash-grab that reinforces a negative stereotype of Mexican women, with the doll wearing a fiesta dress, sporting a pink passport, and carrying a pet Chihuahua. The subsequent attempt to salvage their reputation by changing the doll to Mariachi Barbie has not met with the hoped-for success and this fiasco demonstrates the lack of savvy major doll market players have had when it comes to appealing to not only an increasingly ethnically diverse American population, but to global markets, where young girls seek role models they can identify with.\n\nThe Prettie Girls! brand on the other hand has won fast favor with consumers and industry players alike, stealing the show at the 112th North American International Toy Fair due to the well-defined characteristics and personalities of each doll, which, while being ethnically diverse, are not focused on that ethnicity so much as on the wonderful and inspiring personalities crafted for each doll. This ingenious and adept approach was masterminded by OWOO’s Stacey McBride-Irby, who used to be a project designer at Mattel and developed the sorority Barbie modeled on the first African-American Greek Sorority, Alpha Kappa Alpha, before leaving Mattel after a 15-year run in order to make dolls which fully live up to her motto that a “happy, inspired childhood creates happy, inspired, and powerful women.”\n\nPart of the success at Toy Fair 2015 for OWOO was the introduction of the tween versions of the company’s Prettie Girls! brand, the Tween Scene dolls, which are aimed at directly representing preteen girls and bringing an array of even more approachable, ethnically diverse role models to younger girls. Also at the Toy Fair, OWOO received confirmation from the Walmart.com buying team that sales performance of their Prettie Girls! brand was quite positive and that the brand would be featured in Walmart’s Easter sales promotion, as well as via the Walmart.com special offers program for approved members. Similar retail deals have given the company a sizeable retail footprint already, with a distribution agreement between OWOO and online sales giant Amazon.com having recently been signed, and the Prettie Girls! brand finding their way onto shelves at such popular brick and mortar retailers as Toys “R” Us, which has over 870 stores in the U.S. and more than 725 stores worldwide, as well as at Texas-based H-E-B Grocery, which has over 350 stores across Texas and northern Mexico.\n\nRather than cynically pandering to various ethnicities, the Prettie Girls! and Prettie Girls! Tween Scene brands lovingly cater to the ambitions, career goals and positive values all girls should aspire to, celebrating the ethnic diversity and fashion style of each highly unique doll, but not in a heavy-handed way that ultimately turns consumers off. With characteristics like an emphasis on participating in after-school activities and clubs, or desire to help their communities, as well as getting good grades and taking their futures seriously, this brand of dolls is light years beyond the state of design on offer from the major players in the industry. These revolutionary design elements make OWOO a company investors should keep their eye on, especially as the company moves to further flesh out their growing retail footprint with promotional efforts like games and cartoon shows based on the dolls.\n\nWith a 532% YoY jump in revenues reported for fiscal year 2014, OWOO has proven that their mix of intelligent brand design and marketing efforts focused on media venues frequented by their core target demographics is a successful blend of product and presence.\n\nTake a closer look by visiting www.oneworlddolls.com\n\nIFAN Financial, Inc. (IFAN) Primed to Benefit from Increased Consumer Adoption of Mobile Payment Solutions\n\nNEXT Network has referred to 2015 as ‘The Year of Mobile Payment’, and there’s good reason to acknowledge the title. With developing countries beginning to utilize cashless payments, which accounted for over 366 billion transactions in 2013 alone, the global mindset is clearly evolving regarding the way we pay. As Apple Pay continues to rapidly grow in popularity, the presence of NFC technology is likely to spread, opening the door for competing mobile payment providers to enter and revolutionize the young market.\n\nIFAN Financial, Inc. (OTC: IFAN) has already proven many of the benefits of mobile payment solutions through the development of its proprietary Quidme platform. Available on both Apple and Google mobile app stores, the company’s software has been shown to significantly reduce the possibility of identity theft while providing merchants with lower processing fees and cheaper, safer transactions between users. As consumer adoption of mobile payment solutions continues to increase, IFAN’s portfolio of payment offerings gives the company strong growth potential.\n\nThe company recently announced in a press release the benefits the overall mobile payments industry could experience as a result of major technology companies’ entry into the space. In addition to Apple, IFAN stands to benefit immensely from the entry of social media giant Facebook into the fold.\n\n“We’re excited to see a social networking leader like Facebook enter the dynamic mobile payments space,” stated Christopher Mizer, President and Chief Executive Officer of IFAN. “We believe that Facebook’s participation in the mobile payments arena will likely accelerate consumer adoption of peer-to-peer money transfers via smartphone and ultimately add value to our platforms.”\n\nProliferation of peer-to-peer payment methods should place IFAN into a strong strategic position, particularly in emerging markets. While social networking companies open the door for increased consumer adoption, IFAN is in a unique position to leverage its own payment solution, which doesn’t require a data plan to use. Though smartphone penetration continues to grow, Mobiforge estimated that global access to mobile data was still at approximately 24.5 percent as of 2013. As cashless and mobile payments continue to gain steam in developing markets, this should give IFAN a significant strategic advantage in gaining global market share.\n\n“Our strategy is to take advantage of the anticipated momentum and explore potential opportunities to integrate… our IFAN platforms, once fully operational,” continued Mizer.\n\nWith the major moves throughout the industry continuing to increase consumer trust regarding mobile payment solutions, it’s an exciting time for both executives and investors of this growing company.\n\nFor more information, visit http://ifanfinancial.com\n\n$GST recent news/filings\n\n## source: finance.yahoo.com\n\nFri, 03 Apr 2015 15:20:39 GMT ~ Conference-OGIS New York for Gastar Exploration, Inc.\n\nread full: http://www.companyspotlight.com/routers/headline/23549/10009/16071?cp_code=YAH1&1428074439\n\n*********************************************************\n\nThu, 02 Apr 2015 11:26:42 GMT ~ Gastar Exploration Inc.

Phil Bryant and local and company officials.\n\nNewpark Drilling Fluids is locating in the old Kellwood Building owned by Pike County. The company will use the town’s rail spur to bring in both tanker cars and boxcars with ingredients to manufacture drilling mud specifically designed for the TMS drilling.\n\nThe Mississippi Development Authority provided assistance for rail and roadway improvements. The town of Summit also provided assistance.\n\nhttp://www.tulsaworld.com/business/energy/oil-field-services-firm-to-open-mississippi-based-facility/article_ce268947-03f5-537e-affe-a7907e1f84fb.html\n\nFEGR The Company: Friendly Energy Exploration\n\nThe Company formed a wholly owned subsidiary named Friendly Energy Services, Inc. All Oil and Gas activities are conducted through this subsidiary except for work over and drilling operations.\n\nHutchins Lease: The Hutchins lease totals 194 acres of which approximately 30% is in defined oil fields. The Company’s lease is for the upper production zones included the Fry Sands. There were four Fry Sand wells which were plugged in 2001 when the operator had financial problems and oil and gas prices were very low. We expect to reenter the one of the Fry Sand wells. There is good potential for in-field drilling. A new tank farm and other infrastructure are needed on the Hutchins lease. As at December 31, 2012, there was no production on the property. The Hutchins #1 was drilled in May 1983 as a Wildcat. After drilling through three zones indicating excellent potential, the Hutchins encountered a hydrocarbon bearing formation at 2,280 feet. This had not been encountered in any other well in Brown County. The Hutchins well is credited with being the discovery well for one of the largest productive Mississippian reefs in the state of Texas. It is also credited as the discovery well for one of the most productive fields discovered in Brown County in the last half of the century. In 2009, the Company purchased, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, a 100% interest in oil and gas properties in central Texas for $2,400.\n\n$FEGR /\\ KCG Americas LLC 20.46% Ownership of Friendly Energy Exploration / Shares Outstanding 32,140,807 a/o Mar 12 2013 Float: 28,52M\n\nAmended Statement of Ownership (sc 13g/a)\n\nDate : 11/10/2014 @ 3:05PM\n\nSource : Edgar (US Regulatory)\n\nStock : Friendly Energy Exploration (PN) (FEGR)\n\nQuote : 0.0007 0.0 (0.00%) @ 5:32AM\n\nAmended Statement of Ownership (sc 13g/a)\n\nPrint\n\nAlert\n\nUNITED STATES\n\nSECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION\n\nWashington, D.C. 20549\n\nSCHEDULE 13G/A\n\nUnder the Securities Exchange Act of 1934\n\n(Amendment 1)\n\nFriendly Energy Exploration\n\n(Name of Issuer)\n\nCommon Stock\n\n(Title of Class of Securities)\n\n35846A200\n\n(CUSIP Number)\n\nOctober 31, 2014\n\n(Date of Event Which Requires Filing of this Statement)\n\nCheck the appropriate box to designate the rule pursuant to which this Schedule is filed:\n\nx Rule 13d-1(b)\n\n¨ Rule 13d-1(c)\n\n¨ Rule 13d-1(d)\n\n* The remainder of this cover page shall be filled out for a reporting person’s initial filing on this form with respect to the subject class of securities, and for any subsequent amendment containing information which would alter the disclosures provided in a prior cover page.\n\nThe information required in the remainder of this cover page shall not be deemed to be “filed” for the purpose of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Act”) or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section of the Act but shall be subject to all other provisions of the Act (however, see the Notes).\n\nSCHEDULE 13G/A\n\nCUSIP NO. 35846A200\n\n1.\n\nName of reporting person\n\nI.R.S.
