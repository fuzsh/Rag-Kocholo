Often Wolbachia spread to high frequencies within populations due to cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), a Wolbachia-induced sperm modification caused by prophage-associated genes (cifs) that kill embryos without Wolbachia. Several Wolbachia variants also block viruses, including wMel from Drosophila melanogaster when transinfected into the mosquito Aedes aegypti. CI enables the establishment and stable maintenance of pathogen-blocking wMel in natural Ae. aegypti populations. These transinfections are reducing dengue disease incidence on multiple continents. While it has long been known that closely related Wolbachia occupy distantly related hosts, the timing of Wolbachia host switching and molecular evolution has not been widely quantified. We provide a new, conservative calibration for Wolbachia chronograms based on examples of co-divergence of Wolbachia and their insect hosts. Synthesizing publicly available and new genomic data, we use our calibration to demonstrate that wMel-like variants separated by only about 370,000 years have naturally colonized holometabolous dipteran and hymenopteran insects that diverged approximately 350 million years ago. Data from Wolbachia variants closely related to those currently dominant in D. melanogaster and D. simulans illustrate that cifs are rapidly acquired and lost among Wolbachia genomes, on a time scale of 104–105 years. This turnover occurs with and without the Wovirus prophages that contain them, with closely related cifs found in distantly related phages and distantly related cifs found in closely related phages. We present evidence for purifying selection on CI rescue function and on particular Cif protein domains. Our results quantify the tempo and mode of rapid host switching and horizontal gene transfer that underlie the spread and diversity of Wolbachia sampled from diverse host species. The wMel variants we highlight from hosts in different climates may offer new options for broadening Wolbachia-based biocontrol of diseases and pests.\n\nKeywords: cytoplasmic incompatibility, Drosophila, endosymbiosis, horizontal transmission, host switching, insertion sequence elements\n\nIntroduction\n\nMaternally transmitted Wolbachia bacteria were first discovered in the ovaries of the mosquito Culex pipiens (Hertig and Wolbach 1924). They are now recognized as the most common endosymbionts in nature, occurring in about half of all insect species (Weinert et al. 2015). This includes distantly related host species carrying closely related Wolbachia (O’Neill et al. 1992), indicative of horizontal Wolbachia movement among hosts. Wolbachia are known for their effects on host reproduction, with cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) observed in 10 arthropod host orders (Shropshire et al. 2020). CI kills Wolbachia-free embryos fertilized by Wolbachia-carrying males, often driving the endosymbiont to high frequencies in natural populations (Yen and Barr 1973; Hoffmann et al. 1990). CI also enables successful biocontrol of human diseases by facilitating the establishment in vector populations of pathogen-blocking Wolbachia like wMel from Drosophila melanogaster (Walker et al. 2011; Utarini et al. 2021; Lenharo 2023; Velez et al. 2023). Using published and new data, our goal is to elucidate the timescale of Wolbachia movements among host species and the rapid turnover and evolution of genes (cifs) that can cause (cifB and cifA) and rescue (cifA) CI (LePage et al. 2017; Beckmann et al. 2017, 2021; Shropshire and Bordenstein 2019).\n\nThe first DNA analyses of Wolbachia (O’Neill et al. 1992), based on partial sequences of 16S rRNA loci, demonstrated that Wolbachia and their insect hosts have deeply discordant phylogenies, with similar Wolbachia found in distantly related hosts, including Diptera, Lepidoptera, and Coleoptera. The alternative modes of these host transfers and their rapid time scale have been revealed with increasing accuracy as more molecular data are collected. In their pioneering analysis of divergence times, Werren et al. (1995) used a “universal molecular clock” for bacteria (Ochman and Wilson 1987) applied to Wolbachia ftsZ sequences extracted from flies and wasps. With no differences over 265 synonymous substitution sites within a 937 bp region of ftsZ from Wolbachia found in the parasitic hymenopteran Asobara tabida and its dipteran host Drosophila simulans (from Riverside California), Werren et al. (1995) estimated a 95% (99%) confidence interval for the divergence time of these Wolbachia of 0–1.6 (0–2.5) million years. Recent analyses (Wang et al. 2016) suggest that Diptera and Hymenoptera diverged about 350 million years ago (MYA). Many subsequent studies, most recently by Vancaster and Blaxter (2023), have confirmed the pervasive discordance of Wolbachia and host phylogenies. In contrast to these generally facultative associations, Wolbachia seem to have become obligate symbionts of filarial nematodes (Bandi et al. 1998, reviewed in Manoj et al. 2021) in which they generally codiverge with their hosts (cf., Moran 2007).\n\nWerren and associates developed a refined chronology of Wolbachia movement among host species (Raychoudhury et al. 2009). They cross-calibrated Wolbachia divergence with host nuclear and mtDNA divergence, exploiting a convincing example of cladogenic transmission (i.e., codivergence) of Wolbachia in the wasps Nasonia longicornis and N. giraulti. The key evidence supporting codivergence was concordant divergence-time estimates for the hosts and Wolbachia based on independently derived molecular clocks for synonymous-site divergence of eukaryotic nuclear genes and an updated rate estimate for coding-region divergence across bacteria (Ochman et al. 1999). For the host-Wolbachia pairs showing plausible cladogenic Wolbachia transmission ((N. longicornis, wNlonB1) and (N. giraulti, wNgirB)), Raychoudhury et al. (2009) estimated that Wolbachia diverged at about one-third the rate of the host nuclear genomes for synonymous sites (see our Materials and Methods). In contrast, mtDNA diverged at synonymous sites about 1.2×102 times as fast as co-inherited Wolbachia. As summarized in our Materials and Methods, the Raychoudhury et al. (2009) data imply an average Wolbachia yearly substitution rate at third-codon sites of approximately 2.2×10−9.\n\nRichardson et al. (2012) produced an alternative approach to calibrating rapid Wolbachia divergence, comparing full genomes of Wolbachia and mitochondria among Drosophila melanogaster lineages. As expected under joint maternal inheritance, D. melanogaster isofemale lines produced concordant mtDNA and Wolbachia phylogenies. Like Raychoudhury et al. (2009), Richardson et al. (2012) observed that the third-site mtDNA differences were roughly 102 greater than Wolbachia codon differences (which do not differ across the three coding positions over short divergence times, cf. Conner et al. 2017, ). Having estimated relative sequence divergence for Wolbachia and mtDNA among isofemale lines, Richardson et al. (2012) estimated an absolute rate for Wolbachia evolution. Using the per-generation mtDNA mutation rate as a prior in a Bayesian analysis of isofemale-line divergence, they estimated a “short-term” Wolbachia third-site substitution rate of 6.87×10−9 per site per year (see our Materials and Methods).\n\nTable 1.\n\nHost Species Wolbachia Nuclear mtDNA Wolbachia/nuclear mtDNA/Wolbachia mtDNA/nuclear Nasonia longicornis(wNlonB1) / N. giraulti(wNgirB) 1 0.2, 0.3 (4486 bp)NA, 1.12 (4135 bp)NA, 45.24 (2241 bp)NA, 0.27NA, 150.8NA, 40.4 Drosophila bicornuta / D. barbarae 2 2.4, 3.7 (620685 bp)12.3, 19.3 (37401 bp)15.7, 28.0 (11030 bp)0.20, 0.196.54, 7.571.28, 1.45 Brugia malayi/B. pahangi 3 0.88, 1.4 (598257 bp)1.94, 3.10 (33099 bp)28.2, 43.7 (10361 bp)0.45, 0.4532.0, 31.214.5, 14.1 Nomada clade: (N. ferruginata, (N. panzeri, (N. flava, N. leucophtalma))) 4 N. ferruginata/N. panzeri 0.29, 0.46 (613605 bp)1.73, 2.39 (36402 bp)2.53, 4.95 (9249 bp)0.17, 0.198.72, 10.761.46, 2.07 N. ferruginata/N. flava 0.27, 0.43 (613605 bp)1.43, 2.15 (36402 bp)2.61, 5.27 (9249 bp)0.19, 0.209.67, 12.261.83, 2.45 N. ferruginata/N. leucophtalma 0.27, 0.43 (613605 bp)1.47, 2.13 (36402 bp)2.22, 4.45 (9249 bp)0.18, 0.208.22, 10.351.51, 2.09 N. panzeri/N. flava 0.032, 0.051 (613605 bp)0.99, 1.29 (36402 bp)2.42, 4.94 (9249 bp)0.032, 0.04075.6, 96.92.44, 3.83 N. panzeri/N. leucophtalma 0.033, 0.051 (613605 bp)1.00, 1.27 (36402 bp)2.25, 4.52 (9249 bp)0.033, 0.04068.2, 88.62.25, 3.56 N. flava/N. leucophtalma 0.0088, 0.011 (613605 bp)0.65, 1.06 (36402 bp)1.34, 2.62 (9249 bp)0.014, 0.010152.3, 238.22.06, 2.47\n\nTurelli et al. (2018) applied this short-term calibration of Richardson et al. (2012) to estimate divergence times for Wolbachia closely related wRi, the first Wolbachia variant discovered in a Drosophila species (Hoffmann et al. 1986). This yielded an estimate that wRi-like strains diverged less than 30 thousand years (KY) occupy Drosophila hosts diverged 10–50 million years (MY). Ahmed et al. (2016) used a similar calibration to estimate horizontal transmission times for Wolbachia among Lepidoptera species. Analyses of model Drosophila systems have made fundamental contributions to understanding Wolbachia population biology (e.g., Turelli and Hoffmann 1995; Turelli et al. 2022) and the mechanisms of CI (e.g., LePage et al. 2017), in addition to modes of Wolbachia acquisition (Conner et al. 2017; Cooper et al. 2019). The second Wolbachia found in a Drosophila species, wMel, was described in Australian D. melanogaster (Hoffmann 1988). Both wRi and wMel rapidly spread worldwide within these invasive hosts (Turelli and Hoffmann 1991; Richardson et al. 2012; Kriesner et al. 2013, 2016). wRi, which causes strong CI in its native host, now occurs at relatively stable frequencies (~93%) in almost all characterized D. simulans populations (Kriesner et al. 2013), while the frequencies of wMel, which causes relatively weak CI in its native host, vary significantly among D. melanogaster populations, largely because of variation in the fidelity of maternal transmission (Kriesner et al. 2016; Hague et al. 2022, 2024). When experimentally transferred from D. melanogaster to Aedes aegypti, hosts with a most recent common ancestor (MRCA) about 250 MYA (Wiegmann et al. 2011), pathogen-blocking wMel causes very strong CI (but see Ross et al. 2017). CI facilitates the establishment of wMel in natural Ae. aegypti populations and successful biocontrol of dengue (Walker et al. 2011; Utarini et al. 2021; Lenharo 2023; Velez et al. 2023)\n\nHere we focus on determining the timescale of divergence and evolution of Wolbachia closely related to wMel (Martinez et al. 2021) and observed in holometabolous host species diverged about 350 MY. We present a new temporal calibration of Wolbachia divergence using cladogenically inherited Wolbachia. Changes of these Wolbachia over time scales on the order of 106 years may more accurately represent divergence rates for closely related Wolbachia (having diverged on the order of 105 years or less) among distantly related hosts than the mutation-based calibration of Richardson et al. (2012). Using our new calibration, we demonstrate that variants closely related to wMel have naturally colonized dipteran and hymenopteran hosts over about the last 370 KY. Many of these Wolbachia cause CI and their host invasions are accompanied by even faster turnover of cifs among Wolbachia genomes. We confirm that cif movement occurs with and without the Wovirus prophages that contain them, with closely related cifs observed in distantly related phages and distantly related cifs observed in closely related phages. We also quantify patterns of selection that indicate preservation of CI rescue function and particular Cif protein domains. Our results contribute to a broader understanding of Wolbachia and cif evolution, while identifying novel wMel-like variants that may serve as candidates for future Wolbachia applications.\n\nResults and discussion\n\nNew time calibration for Wolbachia divergence\n\nWe present a new conservative calibration for Wolbachia chronograms based on examples of Wolbachia co-divergence with their hosts. As noted above, the Nasonia data of Raychoudhury et al. (2009) produced the first example of time-calibrated Wolbachia-host co-divergence. The Gerth and Bleidorn (2017) analyses of nuclear and Wolbachia genomes across the bee clade (Nomada ferruginata, (N. panzer, (N. flava, N. leucophthalma))) provide additional examples. As explained in our Materials and Methods, their data seem most consistent with Wolbachia entering the common ancestor of these four species, then diverging between N. ferruginata and its three-species sister clade. Our analyses below suggest that these latter three species experienced horizontal Wolbachia transmission (Conner et al. 2017, ; Meany et al. 2019, p. 1288). Comparing the Wolbachia in Nomada ferruginata with those in the sister clade (N. panzer, (N. flava, N. leucophthalma)) suggests a slower rate of Wolbachia divergence than the Nasonia data, roughly 5.6×10–10 [with 95% credible range of (0.40–1.16)×10−9] versus 2.2×10−9 per year for third sites. To these examples, we add a new calibration based on plausible cladogenic Wolbachia transmission between two species in the Drosophila montium species group, Drosophila bicornuta and D. barbarae (Conner et al. 2021). This Drosophila example implies a substitution rate per year at third sites of 2.2×10−9 [with 95% credible range of (1.9–2.6)×10−9] very similar to that estimated for Nasonia. We use Bayesian analyses to estimate Wolbachia chronograms by applying alternative prior distributions based on averaging these examples of codivergence of hosts and Wolbachia. The average Wolbachia divergence rate for all four of our priors is 1.65×10−9 per third site per year, about four times slower than the mutation-based prior from Richardson et al. (2012). This longer time-scale does not alter our conclusions here or those of Turelli et al. (2018) about “rapid” movement of Wolbachia among hosts and the even faster evolution of these closely related Wolbachia across those hosts. We expect that the Richardson et al. (2012) mutation-rate calibration underestimates divergence times for closely related Wolbachia among distantly related hosts, whereas our new calibration, based on co-divergence, may slightly overestimate those times. Our central conclusions are robust to these uncertainties.\n\nTable 2.\n\nMethodSubstitutions/site/yearDataTime calibration/validationthird sitessynonymous sites“Universal” estimate of the average substitution rate for coding DNA in bacteria applied to Wolbachia ftsZ1NA7–8×10−9 (ref. 2)ftsZ differences among Wolbachia1Divergence-time estimates based on 21 kb of coding DNA from bacteria Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli2 supplemented with data indicating similar synonymous-site substitution rates for ftsZ in Wolbachia1.Updated universal synonymous-site substitution rate3 for bacteria crossvalidated with a host nuclear clock4 for synonymous sites in cladogenically transmitted Wolbachia (wNlonB1 vs. wNgirB) in Nasonia longicornis and N. giraulti2.2×10−93.3×10−9Fragments of Wolbachia and host nuclear lociConcordance of divergence times estimated from molecular clocks applied to Wolbachia and host nuclear DNA4.

Our analyses below also focus on the timescale of cif movement and molecular evolution among Wolbachia genomes. We use “wMel-like” to designate the clade examined here (Hague et al. 2020a), comparing the results to “wRi-like” Wolbachia (Turelli et al. 2018). We focus on the Wolbachia genomes available before Vancaster and Blaxter (2023). Although the clade boundaries are arbitrary, our central conclusions concerning rapid movement of closely related Wolbachia among distantly related hosts—and rapid turnover of Wovirus and cifs within those Wolbachia genomes—rest on robustly estimated chronograms and do not require complete sampling of the Wolbachia clades we analyze (Supplemental Discussion). When pervasive recombination and horizontal exchange were initially described among diverse Wolbachia (Jiggins et al. 2001; Baldo et al. 2006), it was conjectured that recombination precluded reliable bifurcating phylogenies and chronograms for these mosaic genomes. However, subsequent analyses (cf. Wang et al. 2020) show that despite rapid and frequent movements of CI-determining loci, phages, and other genetic elements, large portions of the wMel-like and wRi-like genomes show no significant evidence of recombination (Supplementary Discussion). We use these apparently quasi-clonal genomic regions for our phylogenetic and divergence-time analyses and show that previous analyses (Turelli et al. 2018; Meany et al. 2019) which did not explicitly control for recombination are robust (Fig. S1; Supplementary Discussion). Note that our analyses do not contradict previous evidence of extensive recombination involving relatively distantly related Wolbachia. Rather our analyses of closely related Wolbachia show no detectable recombination, as might be expected with relatively rare genetic exchange between nearly identical genomes. These observations are analogous to those concerning horizontal transmission of Wolbachia: horizontal transmission is clearly common among distantly related hosts, but it seems quite rare within individual host species (e.g., Richardson et al. 2012; Cooper et al. 2019).\n\nWe consider 20 wMel-like Wolbachia whose host species include dipteran and hymenopteran hosts (MRCA: 350 MYA) ( – ) (Wang et al. 2016). Using all single-copy genes of equal length with little evidence of past recombination (Supplementary Discussion), the bulk of these Wolbachia genomes diverged only about 500 thousand years ago (500 KYA) (95% credible interval: 263 KYA–1.2 MYA) ( ). shows an approximate chronogram for the most diverged hosts: a wasp, Diachasma alloeum; a stalk-eyed fly, Sphyracephala brevicornis; and a representative drosophilid, Drosophila teissieri. The divergence time of the insect orders Diptera, which includes the families Drosophilidae and Diopoidea (stalk-eyed flies) and Hymenoptera is comparable to the crown age of all extant tetrapods, ~373 million years (MY) (Simões and Pierce 2021). In contrast, the wMel-like Wolbachia in these most-diverged hosts, denoted wDal, wSbr and wTei, respectively, diverged about 370 KYA (95% CI: 187–824 KYA) ( node with gray circle). We also report wMel-like Wolbachia in 18 drosophilids ( ), including a variant, wZts, in tropical Zaprionus tscasi that is now the closest known relative of wMel in D. melanogaster. Zaprionus flies are members of the Drosophila subgenus that diverged from the Sophophora subgenus about 47 MYA (95% CI: 43.9–49.9 MYA), highlighting wMel proliferation across species that span the entire paraphyletic genus also named Drosophila (Suvorov et al. 2022). The drosophilid host range and rapidity of movement for wMel-like variants are similar to estimates for wRi-like variants (Turelli et al. 2018), suggesting that this “life history” may characterize many common Wolbachia. In our Supplementary Discussion, we elaborate additional inferences that can be made when more than one Wolbachia sequence from these hosts and others become available and provide a correction of prior claims concerning the Wolbachia in D. suzukii and D. subpulchrella based on species misidentification (Fig. S2, Supplementary Discussion). The complete set of hosts and their wMel-like Wolbachia is provided in Table S1.\n\nRapid introgressive transfer of Wolbachia between some closely related species\n\nMany obligate mutualistic endosymbionts like the Wolbachia in filarial nematodes (Comandatore et al. 2013) and Buchnera in aphids (Baumann et al. 1995) are acquired cladogenically. In contrast, all but one of these wMel-like Wolbachia must have been acquired through introgression or non-sexual horizontal transmission. Introgression is plausible only between the most closely related drosophilid species in our study (indicated by the colored triangles in ). Joint analysis of mtDNA and Wolbachia sequences implies that the three-species yakuba clade (D. teissieri, (D. yakuba, D. santomea)) first acquired Wolbachia by horizontal transmission from an unknown host, then transferred it within the clade through hybridization and introgression (Cooper et al. 2019). D. yakuba hybridizes with its endemic sister species D. santomea on the island of São Tomé (Lachaise et al. 2000; Comeault et al. 2016; Cooper et al. 2017), and with D. teissieri on the edges of forests on the nearby island of Bioko (Cooper et al. 2018). Wolbachia and mtDNA chronograms are generally concordant for these three hosts and indicate more recent common ancestors for these maternally inherited factors than for the bulk of the host nuclear genomes (Cooper et al. 2019). Z. taronus occurs on São Tomé, particularly co-occurring with D.santomea at high altitudes; but it diverged from the D. yakuba triad about 47 MYA ( ), making introgression impossible. Yet, its Wolbachia (wZta) diverged from the wYak-clade Wolbachia only about 54–353 KY. These data illustrate horizontal Wolbachia transfer between distantly related species with overlapping ranges and habitats.\n\nOther possible examples of introgressive Wolbachia acquisition involve two species pairs in the D. montium subgroup, (D. seguyi, D. malagassya) and (D. bocqueti, D. sp. aff. chauvacae), whose Wolbachia diverged on the order of 32 KY (11–87 KY) and 40 KY (14–106 KY), respectively. Both host pairs appear as sister species (Conner et al. 2021), so introgressive Wolbachia transfer is plausible. However, the mtDNA third-position coding sites differ by 0.53% and 1.15% respectively, corresponding to divergence times on the order of 100 KY or longer (Ho et al. 2005). Our estimate of wSeg-wMal divergence is inconsistent with introgressive acquisition by D. seguyi and D. malagassya, while we cannot rule out introgressive acquisition by D. bocqueti and D. sp. aff. chauvacae based on our credible interval of wBocq-wAch divergence. For the more distantly related pairs ((Z. taronus, Z. tsacasi) and (D. borealis, D. incompta)), the mtDNA third-site differences of 19.3% and 30% respectively, decisively preclude introgressive Wolbachia transfer.\n\nwMel-like Wolbachia hosts are diverse and cytoplasmic incompatibility is common\n\nThe hosts of these wMel-like Wolbachia are extraordinarily diverse in ecology and geography. They range from cosmopolitan human-associated species (D. melanogaster, D. simulans and S. pallida) to endemics restricted to small oceanic islands (D. santomea and D. arawakana). The drosophilids include one that breeds and feeds on flowers (D. incompta), a mushroom specialist (D. recens), and classic generalists (e.g., D. melanogaster and D. simulans). As expected, hosts with closely related Wolbachia co-occur somewhere (or did in the recent past). For instance, wAu was previously observed in D. simulans in Florida and Ecuador (Turelli and Hoffmann 1995). Thus, before wAu was displaced by wRi, wAu-carrying D. simulans probably co-occurred with D. tropicalis found only in Central and South America and Caribbean islands, which harbors wTro, sister to wAu in . Although the wasp Diachasma alloeum parasitizes the tephritid Rhagoletis pomonella, none of R. pomonella’s several Wolbachia seem to be wMel-like (Schuler et al. 2011). We focus on the phylogenetic distribution of CI-inducing Wolbachia associated with these hosts.\n\nOf the 20 wMel-like and 8 wRi-like Wolbachia in our study, all but 11 wMel-like strains have been tested for CI. For 2 of these 11 wMel-like strains (wSeg in D. seguyi and wBocq in D. bocqueti), insect stocks were available for us to test for CI. Putatively incompatible conspecific crosses between females without Wolbachia and males with Wolbachia (IC) produce lower egg hatch than do conspecific compatible crosses (CC) for both wSeg in D. seguyi (IC egg hatch = 0.34 ± 0.21 SD, N = 14; CC egg hatch = 0.89 ± 0.11 SD, N = 18; P < 0.001) and wBocq in D. bocqueti (IC egg hatch = 0.18 ± 0.24 SD, N = 13; CC egg hatch = 0.60 ± 0.30 SD, N = 17; P = 0.002). This confirms relatively strong CI in two new wMel-like Wolbachia systems. In total, 8 wMel-like and 6 wRi-like Wolbachia in our study cause CI ( ; see Table S1 for references). CI strength varies greatly among these systems and others (Hoffmann 1988; Cooper et al. 2017; Shropshire et al. 2022), but may also vary within systems (Shropshire et al. 2020) as a function of male age (Reynolds and Hoffmann 2002; Shropshire et al. 2021b), environmental factors (Clancy and Hoffmann 1998; Ross et al. 2017), and host backgrounds (Poinsot et al. 1998; Reynolds and Hoffmann 2002; Cooper et al. 2017; Wybouw et al. 2022). This includes wMel, that tends to express weak CI in D. melanogaster (Hoffmann 1988) and strong CI in other hosts (Zabalou et al. 2008; Walker et al. 2011). Wolbachia that carry putatively functional cifs, but that do not cause CI in their natural hosts, are candidates for future work focused on the evolution of host suppression of CI (see below).\n\ncif genes and proteins are highly diverse among wMel-like Wolbachia\n\nCI is caused by two-gene cif operons, with paternal expression of cifB (and occasionally cifA) killing embryos unless a complementary cifA copy is expressed maternally (LePage et al. 2017; Beckmann et al. 2017; Shropshire et al. 2018, 2021a; Shropshire and Bordenstein 2019; Xiao et al. 2021; Adams et al. 2021; Sun et al. 2022). cifs are generally associated with Wovirus bacteriophages that are themselves subdivided into four groups typed using serine recombinase (sr) alleles (sr1WO–sr4WO), with three containing cifs (sr1WO-sr3WO) (Bordenstein and Bordenstein 2022). Wolbachia-encoded cifs span five described clades called Types (cif[T1]–cif[T5]) (Martinez et al. 2021), and Wolbachia genomes often contain multiple cif operons ( ) (Bonneau et al. 2018; Martinez et al. 2021). Excluding non-CI-inducing wMel-like wAu and wTro (Turelli and Hoffmann 1995; Hoffmann et al. 1996; Martinez et al. 2015), the Wolbachia in our analyses encode between one and three cif operons from four of the five described cif types: all genomes except wSbr contain a cif[T1] operon, eight contain a cif[T2] operon, and cif[T4] and cif[T5] operons each appear in four Wolbachia ( ). Even within cif types, there is significant variation in protein sequence, length, and domain composition (Fig. S3A–C; Supplementary Discussion). An exceptional example is CifBwZta[T1–2] (i.e., the second copy of CifB[T1] found in wZta). It is 357 amino acids longer than the next largest CifB[T1] and shares only 51% to 39% sequence identity with other CifB[T1] proteins (Table S2). Despite its considerable divergence, wZta’s CifB is more similar to other CifB[T1] proteins in our dataset than to any other putatively functional CifB types, and retains a pair of PD-(D/E)XK nuclease domains ubiquitous among CifB proteins (Kaur et al. 2024).\n\ncif operons turn over rapidly among closely related Wolbachia\n\nWolbachia and cif phylogenies are often discordant (LePage et al. 2017; Cooper et al. 2019; Martinez et al. 2021), but the timing of cif movement among Wolbachia genomes is unresolved. Using our new calibration and comparison of cif operons observed in closely and distantly related Wolbachia genomes, we document rapid turnover of multiple cif types. Several wMel-like clades provide clear evidence of cif turnover. In the wSYTZ clade (wSYT plus the wZta outgroup), wSYT genomes contain only one cif[T1] operon but wZta contains two, indicating a gain or loss in the last 54–353 KY (see below, ). Sequence divergence between wZta’s two cif[T1] operons implies that acquisition of the second operon did not involve duplication ( ). Turnover is not restricted to particular cif types, as exemplified by the wSYTZ clade acquiring cif[T4] operons after diverging from (wMel, wZts) 117–569 KYA (Supplementary Discussion). wSYT Wolbachia also differ in cif[T4] copy number, with wYak and wSan acquiring a second copy since diverging from wTei (MRCA: 4.8–44 KYA) (Baião et al. 2021). In the ((wAra, wSpa), wSbr) clade (MRCA: 170–791 KYA), we observe turnover of cif[T1], cif[T2] and cif[T5] operons. wAra contains two cif[T1] operons, its sister wSpa contains a cif[T1] operon and a cif[T2] operon, and outgroup wSbr contains only cif[T2] and cif[T5] operons. In the (wInc, (wBor, (wAu, wTro))) clade (MRCA: 179–790 KYA), wInc and wBor contain a cif[T1] operon, wBor contains a cif[T5] operon, and wAu and wTro do not contain any operons. cif turnover is not restricted to wMel-like Wolbachia as exemplified by the wRi-like wTri genome containing a cif[T5] operon that is absent in the very closely related wAur sister variant (no observed differences across the 525 genes and 506,307 bp used to produce the wRi-like phylogram in Turelli et al. (2018).\n\nWe further illustrate rapid cif turnover by focusing on homologs of cifA[T1], which is the most common cif type in our dataset ( , Supplementary Discussion). We observe two distantly related clades of cifA[T1] alleles. The first includes 25 alleles observed across 15 wMel-like Wolbachia and 8 wRi-like Wolbachia. wRi and wSuz each carry two closely related cifA[T1] alleles, likely originating via duplication. cifA[T1] alleles observed in wMel-like wDal, wAra, wBor and wInc genomes are most closely related to cifA[T1] alleles observed in wRi-like Wolbachia genomes and share particularly high identity with cifA[T1] alleles observed in wRi-like wAur and wTri genomes (99.8−99.2% aa identity). The second cifA[T1] clade includes additional cifA[T1] copies in wMel-like wZta, wDal, and wAra genomes that are more closely related to each other than each is to the second cifA[T1] copy they carry. This clade also contains a cifA[T1] allele observed in wSpa (wSpa, wAra). While we cannot resolve the complete history of cif movement and evolution from these data, we conclude that cif turnover is rapid, occurring within and between wMel-like and wRi-like clades on the order of 104-105 years.\n\nWovirus turnover does not fully explain cif movement\n\nTwo additional aspects of our data on cif transfer are worth emphasizing. First, the Wovirus bacteriophages that contain cifs also rapidly turn over among Wolbachia genomes (Supplementary Discussion). An exceptional case involves the wBocq genome that contains an sr3WO Wovirus that is absent from the genome of sister wAch. This implies Wovirus gain or loss in the last 14–106 KY. Second, while cifs clearly transfer along with the Wovirus that carry them, cifs also move among divergent Wovirus classes (i.e., phage-independent cif turnover) (Cooper et al. 2019; Baião et al. 2021). This interchange is documented in two ways: closely related cifs are found in distantly related phages and distantly related cifs are found in closely related phages ( , and Supplementary Discussion). We demonstrate this by comparing phylograms of the serine recombinase genes (sr) of sr3WO Wovirus (sr3) to phylograms of cifA[T1] alleles associated with them. The ten sr3WO Wovirus in wRi-like Wolbachia have identical sr3 alleles and are closely related to sr3 alleles found in several wMel-like Wolbachia. These sr3 alleles are more distantly related to several other sr3 alleles that include a copy found in wMel from D. melanogaster. In contrast, almost all cifA[T1] alleles associated with wMel-like sr3WO Wovirus are very closely related to cifA[T1] alleles associated with wRi-like sr3WO Wovirus ( ). This generalizes phage-independent cif transfer among divergent Wolbachia that was first documented for Type IV loci in wYak by Cooper et al. (2019) and later misinterpreted by Baião et al. (Baião et al. 2021) (Supplementary Discussion). Higher quality assemblies for known donor and recipient Wolbachia will be essential for establishing the relative role of insertion sequence (IS) elements (Cooper et al. 2019) and other factors like plasmids in this transfer. We hypothesize a critical role for IS elements in the phage-independent cif transfer we document, as supported by IS elements flanking the majority of cifs in our analyses (Table S3).\n\nSelection acts to preserve cifA and nuclease domains within cifB\n\nWhat is the fate of these cifs? Theory predicts that once Wolbachia infections are established in a host species, natural selection does not act to maintain CI but does act to maintain resistance to CI (Turelli 1994; Haygood and Turelli 2009). Consistent with these predictions and prior observations (Meany et al. 2019; Martinez et al. 2021), shows that putative pseudogenization (i.e., truncation) is more common for cifB than for cifA (see also Fig. S4A,B). Still, as noted by Beckmann et al. (2021), CI is incredibly common despite weak selection on the phenotype (Turelli et al. 2022). This paradoxical prevalence of CI across Wolbachia lineages can be explained in part by clade selection in which CI-causing Wolbachia lineages are more likely to be transmitted to new host species because they typically have higher frequencies within host species and persist longer than do non-CI causing Wolbachia (Turelli et al. 2022). However, CifB also contributes to alternative functions that include regulation of Wolbachia abundance in host tissues through interactions with host autophagy (Deehan et al. 2021). This suggests that non-CI pleiotropic effects could plausibly contribute to persistence of particular cifs.\n\nTo assess patterns of selection across Cifs, we calculated the ratio of non-synonymous (dN) to synonymous substitutions (dS) for each Cif protein, using a 3-dimensional spherical sliding window across the length of AlphaFold-derived Cif structures ( , Fig. S3, Fig. S4C,D, Movie S1). shows that CifA[T1] proteins are more similar to one another in terms of both sequence identity and structural similarity than CifB[T1] proteins from the same pairs. As predicted, CifA of Types 1 and 2 had lower dN/dS ratios than did CifB of the same type ( , S3D,E) (Supplementary Discussion), consistent with purifying selection maintaining CifA. Putatively pseudogenized CifA and CifB proteins have higher dN/dS ratios than do intact proteins (e.g., CifA dN/dS ~ 1; , ), further supporting the presumption that in-frame stop codons interfere with Cif function (Supplementary Discussion). In contrast, Types 3 and 4 CifA and CifB have comparable dN/dS ratios within each type, which could plausibly stem from pleiotropy or loss-of-function (Fig. S3D,E). CifA[T1] and CifB[T1] binding residues and CifB[T1]’s Deubiquitinase domain have dN/dS ratios comparable to non-domain associated residues. However, the two CifB[T1] nuclease domains both have lower dN/dS ratios than do other residues ( , , , ). Indeed, across Cif Types, CifB’s first nuclease domain has lower dN/dS ratios than non-domain associated residues (Fig. S3F–H). While CifB’s nuclease activity may not always contribute to observed CI expression (Kaur et al. 2024), selection may still act to maintain other nuclease-associated features (e.g., DNA binding) and contribute to CifB’s association with chromatin restructuring (Supplementary Discussion) (Kaur et al. 2022; Terretaz et al. 2023). Interestingly, our data reveal that sites with dN/dS ratios above 1, consistent with positive selection, are primarily located within regions of the protein that are not domain-associated ( ). Many of these sites appear at the surface, aligning with the expectation that surface residues are key to host-microbe interactions, potentially facilitating interactions between Cif and host proteins. Thus, while theory predicts that selection does not act on the CI phenotype (Turelli 1994), selection on alternative CifB functions may plausibly delay mutational disruption of cifB (Beckmann et al. 2021).\n\nConclusions\n\nOur findings confirm that non-sexual horizontal Wolbachia acquisition—and introgressive transfer between close relatives—commonly occur on the order of 104 to 105 years. These conclusions are robust to uncertainties about Wolbachia divergence times. Among recently diverged Wolbachia, distantly related cif operons can be gained and/or lost even faster, both with and without the Wovirus that contain them. The commonness of non-sexually acquired Wolbachia and cif transfer among Wolbachia genomes indicates that opportunities for horizontal transfer must occur often. Because many insects carry vertically transmitted Wolbachia (Weinert et al. 2015), we expect that ephemeral somatic infections are common (cf. Towett-Kirui et al. 2021). Future analyses should focus on understanding the ecology of non-sexual Wolbachia transfer and the cellular-genetic basis of successful non-sexual Wolbachia establishment (or not) in new hosts, as well as the mechanisms of cif transfer with and without Wovirus (Cooper et al. 2019; Baião et al. 2021).\n\nCI-causing Wolbachia provide a practical mechanism for mitigating human diseases. While wMel introductions into Ae. aegypti have been very effective in locations where they have spread to high, stable frequencies (Hoffmann et al. 2011; Utarini et al. 2021; Lenharo 2023; Velez et al. 2023), alternative Wolbachia-based interventions are needed. For example, wMel has been lost in some release locations (Hien et al. 2021; Moledo Gesto et al. 2021), particularly under extremely hot conditions. Temperature can affect CI strength (Reynolds and Hoffmann 2002; Ross et al. 2019) and rates of imperfect Wolbachia transmission (Ross et al. 2017; Hague et al. 2022, 2024); and the temperatures hosts prefer and their overall activities differ when they carry Wolbachia (Hague et al. 2020b). Identifying strong-CI-causing and virus-blocking Wolbachia from the tropics could facilitate Wolbachia biocontrol, and wMel-like variants that naturally associate with tropical host species are obvious candidates (Gu et al. 2022). Our study expands a comprehensive panel of wMel-like Wolbachia and quantifies the timescale of their movement and evolution—these Wolbachia exhibit diverse ecology, geography and cif profiles. We report that a tropical Wolbachia variant (wZts) is now the most closely related known variant to wMel in D. melanogaster. While wZts CI has not yet been tested, all six Z. tscasi sampled in nature carry wZts (producing 0.61 as the 95% lower bound for wZts frequency), consistent with strong CI. Identification of such variants adds versatility and contributes towards the development of more customized and environment-specific Wolbachia applications.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nWolbachia assembly and phylogeny estimation\n\nThe Wolbachia genomes not novel to this study were obtained from the sources listed in Table S1. For the genomes novel to this study or where the source accession is an SRR number (raw reads from NCBI’s SRA database), we trimmed the reads with Sickle v. 1.3 (Joshi and Fass) and assembled them with ABySS v. 2.2.3 (Jackman et al. 2017) with Kmer values of 51, 61, …, 91. From these host assemblies, scaffolds with best nucleotide BLAST matches to known Wolbachia sequences, with E-values less than 10−10, were extracted as the Wolbachia assembly. For each host, the best Wolbachia assembly (fewest scaffolds and highest N50) was kept. To assess the quality of these draft assemblies, we used BUSCO v. 3.0.0 to search for orthologs of the near-universal, single-copy genes in the BUSCO proteobacteria database. As controls, we performed the same search using the reference genomes for wRi, wAu, wMel, wHa and wNo.\n\nTo identify genes for the phylogenetic analyses, all wMel-like and wRi-like Wolbachia genomes (see Table S1) were annotated with Prokka 1.14.5 (Seemann 2014), which identifies orthologs to known bacterial genes. To avoid pseudogenes, paralogs and frameshifts, we used only genes present in a single copy in each genome and required that at most one draft genome had gaps in the alignment. Genes were identified as single-copy if they uniquely matched a bacterial reference gene identified by Prokka and aligned with MAFFT v. 7 (Katoh and Standley 2013). We estimated three separate phylogenies. For the set of the 20 wMel-like genomes, 438 genes, a total of 409,848 bp, met these criteria. For the set of 20 wMel-like genomes plus the 8 wRi-likes, 346 genes, a total of 310,977 bp, met these criteria. For the set of 8 wRi-like genomes above and here, we used the same data set used in Turelli et al. (2018), which was 525 genes, 506,307 bp. These genes also show little evidence for recombination (see below).\n\nWolbachia chronograms\n\nTo estimate absolute chronograms for the three datasets discussed above—wMel-like clade ( ), wRi-like clade (Turelli et al. 2018)—and both clades combined—we first estimated a relaxed-clock relative chronogram with RevBayes 1.1.1 (5) with the root age fixed to 1 using the GTR + Γ nucleotide-substitution model, partitioned by codon position, and the same birth-death process prior for tree shape as in Turelli et al. (2018). There were not enough substitutions to partition by gene as well as codon position. Each partition had an independent rate multiplier with prior Γ(1,1), as well as stationary frequencies and substitution rates drawn from flat, symmetrical Dirichlet distributions. For each branch, the branch-rate prior was Γ(7,7), normalized to a mean of 1 across all branches. Four independent runs were performed, which always agreed. Nodes with posterior probability less than 0.95 were collapsed into polytomies. In Turelli et al. (2018), we converted the relative chronogram constructed as described above into an absolute chronogram using the scaled distribution prior Γ(7,7) × 6.87 × 10−9 substitutions per third-position site per year, derived from the mutation-based posterior distribution estimated by Richardson et al. (2012). The mean assumes 10 generations per year. Absolute branch lengths were calculated as the relative branch length times the third position rate multiplier estimated from the substitutions per third-position site per year. Here we provide an alternative calibration for the third-position rate based on examples of cladogenic Wolbachia transmission. To explore the robustness of our estimates of Wolbachia divergence times to the specific probability distributions used as priors, we consider four alternatives discussed below.\n\nTurelli et al. (2018) derived an absolute chronogram from their relaxed-clock relative chronogram using a substitution-rate estimate of Γ(7,7)×6.87×10−9 substitutions/3rd position site/year. The gamma distribution was used to approximate the variation in the mutation-rate estimate obtained by Richardson et al. (2012). Although Γ(7,7) approximated the per-generation variance estimate, Turelli et al. (2018) used it to approximate the per-year variance. Because Turelli et al. (2018) assumed 10 generations per year, the variance per year was underestimated in this analysis. Here we use a different approach to approximating the uncertainty in substitutions/third-position site/year. Our new variance estimates depend on estimated variation in the divergence times for the host-Wolbachia pairs used to calibrate Wolbachia DNA divergence rates (see and ).\n\nThe first three rows of summarize data describing the divergence of Wolbachia, nuclear loci and mtDNA loci across three plausible examples in which Wolbachia codiverged with their hosts. Particularly notable is the relative consistency of the ratios of Wolbachia versus nuclear sequence divergence. The next six rows of show the comparable data for the Nomada studied by Gerth and Bleidorn (2017). When the outgroup species, N. ferruginata, and its Wolbachia are compared pairwise to the nuclear genomes and Wolbachia of the three ingroup species, (N. panzeri, N. flava and N. leucophtalma), the ratios of Wolbachia to nuclear divergence are broadly consistent with those estimated from the Nasonia, Drosophila and Brugia examples. In contrast, the pairwise divergences estimated within the ingroup (N. panzeri, N. flava and N. leucophtalma) suggest a relative Wolbachia to nuclear divergence rate that is about 5–20 times faster than the other putative examples of cladogenic Wolbachia transmission. We suspect that Wolbachia may have been horizontally transferred within the three-species Nomada ingroup. To produce a more conservative estimate of the time scale of Wolbachia horizontal movement and evolution, we use only the three comparisons between N. ferruginata and the other three Nomada species in our new Wolbachia calibration presented in .\n\nFor their Nasonia analyses, Raychoudhury et al. (2009) used widely applied eukaryotic and bacterial molecular clock calibrations to separately estimate the divergence times for hosts and their Wolbachia. We averaged those estimated divergence times to produce a divergence-time estimate of 0.46 million years (MY). That estimate produces an average third-site Wolbachia substitution rate of 2.2×10−9 substitutions/third-position site/year over the 4486 bp of their Wolbachia DNA sequence data (see ). For our Drosophila and Nomada pairs with plausible cladogenic Wolbachia transmission, we have fossil-based estimates of the host divergence times that do not rely on molecular clock approximations. For the Drosophila pair, D. bicornuta and D. barbarae, Suvorov al et. (2022, ) provides a divergence-time estimate of 2.42 MY, with 95% credible interval of 1.16–3.37 MY. Using 620,685 bp extracted from single-copy Wolbachia loci from these hosts, the point estimate for divergence time produces an average third-site Wolbachia substitution rate of 2.2×10−9 substitutions/3rd position site/year, identical to the Nasonia estimate. Using the 95% credible interval for the host divergence times from Suvorov et al. (2022), a 95% credible interval for the substitution rate is (1.9–2.6)×10−9 substitutions/third-position site/year. Our analysis of 613,605 bp of Wolbachia data from Nomada (see ) indicates a lower average substitution rate per third-position site per year of roughly 5.6×10–10 (with 95% credible range [0.40–1.16]×10−9). We consider four alternative priors for the Wolbachia third-position substitution-rate based on these estimates.\n\nGiven the approximations involved in these substitution-rate estimates, it is informative to evaluate the robustness of our results to alternative priors. We consider alternative priors (Table S5) that attempt to capture in different ways the variation seen in . Rather than try to approximate the asymmetrical confidence intervals for Nomada and Drosophila with gamma distributions, we used priors that explored different approximations of the variation of our substitution-rate estimates. All four priors assume a mean substitution rate of 1.65×10−9 per third-site per year for the Wolbachia genomes (this approximation gives two-thirds weight to the concordant estimates from Nasonia and Drosophila and one-third weight to the Nomada-based estimate). Two of our priors assume unimodal distributions of the substitution rates, with variance that approximates the differences between the estimates from Nomada versus Nasonia and Drosophila, and two assume bimodal distributions, with one mode (given two-thirds weight) corresponding to the Nasonia and Drosophila mean and the other mode (with one-third weight) corresponding to the Nomada mean. To explore the consequences of different shapes and variances for the prior distributions of substitution rates, we use both normal and uniform distributions.\n\nOur heuristic approach to describing substitution-rate variation is consistent with the many approximations that enter the estimates of host divergence times. Our informal credible intervals are based on the credible intervals for the host divergence times. Our four substitution-rate priors will be denoted N1, N2, U1 and U2. Let N(1, s) denote a normal random variable with mean 1 and standard deviation s, and let U(a, b) denote a uniform distribution over the interval (a, b). N1 samples rates from N(1, 0.34)×1.65×10−9, U1 samples from U(0.33,1.67)×1.65×10−9, N2 samples from N(1, 0.36)×0.56×10−9 with probability 1/3, and from N(1, 0.08)×2.2×10−9 with probability 2/3, and U2 samples from U(0.3,1.7) ×0.56×10−9 with probability 1/3, and from U(0.84,1.16)×2.2×10−9 with probability 2/3. Table S5 shows how node age estimates and support intervals vary with the alternative priors. The point estimates are quite robust, as expected given the common mean rate for all four priors. The chronograms in use prior N1.\n\nDetecting recombination and its influence on estimated phylograms and chronograms\n\nPrior work using only a few genes has identified a pattern of recombination between relatively diverged Wolbachia variants (Werren and Bartos 2001; Jiggins et al. 2001; Baldo et al. 2006). To test for recombination across the Wolbachia genome, we used a genetic algorithm (GARD) (Kosakovsky Pond et al. 2006), plus three other statistical methods implemented in PhiPack (Bruen et al. 2006). We focused our analyses on single-copy genes that were at least 300 bp in length, with minimum recombination segments of 100 bp. We set GARD to detect a maximum of two potential breakpoints. We first completed these analyses using our 20 wMel-like variants to determine the extent of recombination between these closely related Wolbachia. 411 genes met our criteria for this analysis.\n\nTo test for recombination between more distantly related Wolbachia, we completed a second analysis using wMel and wRi, plus three other A-group strains (Wolbachia associated with Andrena hattorfiana, Anoplius nigerrimus, and Apoderus coryli), and B-group wMau in Drosophila mauritiana (Meany et al. 2019; Vancaester and Blaxter 2023). We searched for homologs of all 1292 genes in wMel in these five other Wolbachia. Homologs for 1124 genes were found in all 5 Wolbachia, of which 111 were shorter than 300pb and excluded. The remaining 1013 were tested for recombination using GARD and the three statistical tests implemented in PhiPack. Because recombination could potentially influence our estimation of phylograms and chronograms, we also revisited the phylogram and chronogram analyses presented in Meany et al. (2019) that included 9 group-A and 6 group-B strains. We identified genes with no evidence of recombination according to all 4 tests described above and used them to re-estimate a Bayesian phylogram and an absolute chronogram with RevBayes 1.1.1, as in Meany et al. (2019). We estimated the phylogram with the GTR + Γ model, partitioning by codon position (5). To estimate the absolute chronogram, we first estimated a relative relaxed-clock chronogram with the root age fixed to 1, partitioned by codon position. The relaxed-clock branch-rate prior was Γ(7,7), normalized to a mean of 1 across all branches. We transformed the relative chronogram into an absolute chronogram using both the original and new priors for Wolbachia 3rd position site/year substitution rates discussed above.\n\nHost phylogeny and chronograms\n\nA key conclusion of our analyses is that closely related Wolbachia are transferred among distantly related hosts on a time scale many orders of magnitude faster than host divergence times. Our estimates concerning host divergence rely on recent calibrations from the literature. presents our most diverged hosts. The clades Diptera and Hymenoptera span the Holometabola. According to the fossil-calibrated chronograms in Wang et al. (2016, their ), Diptera and Hymenoptera diverged ~350 million years ago (MYA), with 95% highest posterior density credibility interval (HPD CI) of (378–329 MYA, Devonian–Carboniferous). This is consistent with the point estimates produced by Misof et al. (2014) and Johnson et al. (2018) ( ). The placement of the family Diopsidea, the stalk-eyed fly clade that includes Sphyracephala bevicornis, within superfamily Diopsoidea in the paraphyletic acalyptrate group of Schizophora remains uncertain (Bayless et al. 2021). Hence, the maximum divergence time between Sphyracephala bevicornis and any drosophilid is the crown age of the Schizophora, which includes both the Drosophilidae and Diopsoidea. The minimum divergence time between the Drosophilidae and Diopsoidea is the crown age of the Drosophilidae (which certainly excludes the Diopsoidea). Wiegmann et al. (2011) ( ) estimate the crown age of the Schizophora at ~70 MYA. Suvorov et al. (2022) ( ) estimate the crown age of the Drosophilidae at about 47 MYA (with 95% HPD CI of 43.9–49.9, Devonian–Carboniferous). Our approximate point estimate in for the divergence of Drosophilidae and Diopsoidea, 59 MY, is the midpoint of these bounds.\n\nFor the drosophilids in , node ages and approximate confidence intervals were estimated from the fossil-calibrated chronogram of Suvorov et al. (2022), using supplementary information as needed. We number the 12 nodes in from left to right, with 1 denoting the divergence between the subgenera Sophophora (including D. tropicalis) and Drosophila (including D. arawakana), 2 denoting the divergence of D. tropicalis from the D. melanogaster subgroup, …, 11 denoting the crown age of the D.melanogaster subgroup, and 12 denoting divergence time between D. borealis and D. incompta. For species in our that are not included in of Suvorov et al. (2022), we used the NCBI Taxonomy Browser to determine the closest relative(s) included in Suvorov et al. (2022). We estimated node ages and approximate CIs from the x-axis of their , using the measurement tool in Adobe Acrobat Pro DC (ver. 2022.001.20169), converting distances to time using the scale bar at the bottom of their figure. Our symmetrical approximate CIs were obtained by measuring the widths of the CI profiles in of Suvorov et al. (2022) (21). This method produced the approximate ages and CIs for nodes 1–11 in our . As a check, our approximation method produces 47 ± 2.8 MY as the crown age in ; in their text, Suvorov et al. (2022) estimate this age as ~47 MYA with 95% CI 43.9–49.9 MYA.\n\nWe used our Suvorov et al. (2022) calibrations to set the crown ages of the melanogaster and montium subgroups (nodes 10 and 11). Within those subgroups and for node 12 (D. borealis, D. incompta), we estimated relative divergence using relaxed-clock relative chronograms under a GTR + Γ [7,7] model of molecular evolution, following the methods in Conner et al. (2021), summarized below. Estimating the divergence time between D. borealis and D. incompta was the most problematic. D. incompta belongs to the D. flavipilosa species group (De Ré et al. 2017). Both nuclear and mtDNA data indicate that among the host species we analyzed, D. incompta is most closely related to D. borealis in the D. virilis species group.\n\nTo estimate relative divergence times for host drosophilids not included in Suvorov et al. (2022) (21), we obtained genomes from NCBI (Table S1). Coding sequences for the 20 nuclear genes used in the analyses of Turelli et al. (2018) (aconitase, aldolase, bicoid, ebony, Enolase, esc, g6pdh, GlyP, GlyS, ninaE, pepck, Pgi, Pgm1, pic, ptc, Tpi, Transaldolase, white, wingless, and yellow) were obtained from FlyBase for D. melanogaster. We used tBLASTn to identify orthologs in the other genome assemblies. The sequences were aligned with MAFFT v. 7 (4) and trimmed of introns using the D. melanogaster sequences as a guide. We estimated a relaxed-clock relative chronogram with RevBayes 1.1.1 (5) with the root age fixed to 1 using the GTR + Γ [7,7] model, partitioned by gene and codon position. We used the same birth-death prior as Turelli et al. (2018) (6). Each partition had an independent rate multiplier with prior Γ(1,1), as well as stationary frequencies and exchangeability rates drawn from flat, symmetrical Dirichlet distributions. The branch-rate prior was Γ(7,7), normalized to a mean of 1 across all branches. Four independent runs were performed, which agreed with each other. Nodes with posterior probability less than 0.95 were collapsed into polytomies.\n\nCI assays\n\nTo test for cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) in D. seguyi and D. bocqueti, we estimated the egg hatch frequencies from putatively incompatible crosses between females without Wolbachia and males with Wolbachia (denoted IC) and the reciprocal compatible cross (CC) between females with and males without Wolbachia. With CI, we expect lower egg hatch from IC crosses than from CC crosses. To generate lines of both species without Wolbachia, we exposed Wolbachia-carrying lines to tetracycline supplemented (0.03%) cornmeal medium (see Shropshire et al. 2021 for details) for three generations. We confirmed the absence of Wolbachia in the treated flies using PCR within two generations of tetracycline treatment using primers for the Wolbachia-specific wsp gene (Braig et al. 1998; Baldo et al. 2005) and a second reaction for the arthropod-specific 28S rDNA as a host control (Nice et al. 2009). Our PCR thermal profile began with 3 min at 94C, followed by 34 rounds of 30 sec at 94C, 30 sec at 55C, and 1 min and 15 sec at 72C. The profile finished with one round of 8 min at 72C. We visualized PCR products using 1% agarose gels that included a molecular weight ladder. The stocks were maintained and experiments were conducted in an incubator at 25°C.\n\nWe reciprocally crossed Wolbachia-carrying D. seguyi and D. bocqueti lines to their tetracycline-treated conspecifics. Tetracycline-treated stocks were given at least four generations to recover prior to our experiments. Virgins were collected from each line and placed into holding vials for 48 hr. We set up each IC and CC cross with one female and one male in a vial containing a small spoon with cornmeal medium and yeast paste for 24 hr. Males and females were two days old at the beginning of these experiments. Each pair was transferred to a fresh vial every 24 hr for 5 days. We counted the number of eggs laid at the time that adults were transferred to new vials and the number of eggs that hatched were scored after an additional 24 hrs. The data analyzed were hatch proportions for crosses across the 5-day period. To control for cases where females may not have been inseminated, we excluded crosses that produced fewer than 10 eggs. We used one-sided Wilcoxon tests to determine whether IC crosses produce lower egg hatch proportions than do CC crosses.\n\nExtracting cif sequences\n\nWe used BLAST to identify contigs with cif sequences, using cifwMel[T1], cifwRi[T2], cifwNo[T3], cifwPip[T4], cifwStri[T5], cifwTri[T5], and cifwBor[T5] as query sequences. We used Genious Prime to extract open-reading frames with blast homology to cif sequences for downstream analyses (Kearse et al. 2012). Among all cif sequences, only cifBwMal[T1] did not have a clear associated ORF; however, we did observe sequence homology in the region. We assigned the cif sequences to Types (T1–T5) based on similarity to reference genes of each Type. Table 3 provides the sources of all Wolbachia genomes used in our cif sequence analyses.\n\nExtracting serine recombinase genes\n\nWe used the large sr to categorize Woviruses as sr1WO, sr2WO, sr3WO, or sr4WO (Bordenstein and Bordenstein 2022). We used WOCauB3, WOVitA1, WOMelB, and WOFol2 sr as queries in BLAST searches. If the Wolbachia assembly clearly assigned an sr sequence to a phage, we assigned the phage to sr1WO, sr2WO, sr3WO or sr4WO based on the similarity to the reference sequences.\n\nPhylogenetic topological identity\n\nWe tested for discordance between phylogenetic trees estimated from different data, e.g., cifA versus sr sequences within the same Woviruses using the SH (Shimodaira and Hasegawa 1999) and AU (Shimodaira 2002) tests, as implemented in IQ-Tree (Minh et al. 2020). Unlike the topological-similarity tests described below, the null hypothesis in these tests is topological identity.\n\nPhylogenetic topological similarity\n\nWe used normalized Clustering Information (CID), Jaccard-Robinson-Foulds (JRF), and Robinson-Foulds (RF) distances to test for similarity between pairs of trees, as described by Smith (2020). All metrics were calculated using the TreeDist package in R (Smith et al. 2023). To normalize the distance metrics, we divided the observed value by the mean distance obtained from comparing 10,000 random tree pairs with equal numbers of leaves. We generated random trees using the ape package in R (Paradis et al. 2023). We calculated P-values as the proportion of random trees of the same size as our data that produced distances below the observed distance. This tests the hypothesis that two trees are more similar than expected by chance.\n\nCharacterizing Cif protein structures\n\nWe ran HHPred on a Linux kernel to identify putative functional domains using the Pfam-A_v35 and SCOPe70_2.07 databases (Zimmermann et al. 2018). We considered only annotations with > 80% probability. If alternative annotations produced probability > 0.8, we selected the annotation with the highest probability. We used AlphaFold2 (Jumper et al. 2021) to predict Cif structures. Entries in the “reduced database” provided with AlphaFold prior to 5/10/22 were used to generate multiple sequence alignments (MSA) within AlphaFold. We generated five structures for each protein and performed amber relaxation to prevent unrealistic folding patterns. We sorted the five relaxed models by mean pLDDT and used the top result in other analyses. We visualized protein structures using PyMol 2.5.2 (Schrödinger, LLC 2015) and aligned proteins relative to CifwMel[T1] for imaging using Cealign.\n\nWe generated TM-scores in PyMol used for pairwise-comparisons of Cif proteins to determine Cif structural similarities using the psico module (Holder and Schmidt 2023). We performed each analysis twice, switching the reference and target trees. This impacts the TM-score because the score is normalized to the length of the target protein. We used a Mann-Whitney U test in R to compare the TM-scores from CifA and CifB—truncated proteins and proteins at the edge of a contig were removed from this analysis. We assessed the relationship between TM-score and percent identity using a Spearman correlation.\n\nCharacterizing Cif selective pressures\n\nTo identify evidence of selection along the Cif proteins, we calculated the ratio of the number of non-synonymous substitutions per non-synonymous site (dN) to the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (dS) using the Sliding Window Analysis of Ka and Ks (SWAKK) webserver (Liang et al. 2006). SWAKK calculates dN/dS by generating an alignment of two nucleotide sequences, mapping the alignment onto the tertiary structure, and calculating dN/dS with a 10 Å spherical sliding window across the reference structure. We used cifwMel[T1], cifwRi[T2], cifwApo[T3], cifwTei[T4], and cifAwTri[T5] as references for each cif Type. We used AlphaFold structures for tertiary mapping. All statistical analyses were performed using the median dN/dS for each site across pairwise comparisons. We calculated BCa 95% confidence intervals for dN/dS values using the boot package in R (Canty and Ripley 2024).\n\nSupplementary Material\n\nSupplement 1\n\nClick here to view.(1.0M, pdf)\n\nSupplement 2\n\nClick here to view.(54K, zip)\n\nSupplement 3\n\nClick here to view.(29M, mpg)\n\nFunding Statement\n\nThis work was supported by National Science Foundation (NSF) CAREER (2145195) and National Institutes of Health MIRA (R35GM124701) Awards to BSC.
