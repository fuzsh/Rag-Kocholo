        "text": "Stepping away from my work in Space / Satellites and the business world, I want to share a passion of mine that I pursue when I'm not engaged with many of you. Undertaking a new challenge is something that always excites me, and this time, it was my first attempt at the Leadville 100 Mile Trail Run “Race Across the Sky”, the ultimate test of Grit, Guts and Determination. At dawn on this past Saturday, August 17th, alongside approximately 750 other trail enthusiasts, I stood at the starting line—a significant accomplishment in itself, considering the uncertainties that come with preparing for such an endeavor. About 15 hours later, after traversing some of the most breathtaking landscapes in the Colorado Rockies, including grueling climbs up to 12,500 feet, beautiful trails, and a refreshing river crossing, I reached the halfway point at 50 miles. Unfortunately, I arrived after the allowed time cutoff and was unable to continue. Though my legs and heart were eager to push forward, it just wasn’t meant to be. I’ve accepted this outcome with serenity, even though it wasn’t the result I had hoped for. I’m at peace with it, and above all, I’m immensely grateful to God for the blessings He has bestowed upon me: the strength to undertake this challenge, the ability to experience the beauty of nature, and the opportunity to participate in such a journey. I am also deeply thankful to my wife and son, who supported me every step of the way, as well as to my friends who offered their encouragement, and to the incredible volunteers at the aid stations who made this experience possible."
