        "text": "What's in a name? Space Shuttle \"Endeavour.\" The rovers \"Sojourner\" and \"Perseverance.\" The Martian helicopter \"Ingenuity.\" All very different vehicles and missions sharing a remarkable commonality - names, christened by schoolkids through nationwide educational naming competitions. Perhaps we should do the same for our next great space adventure, Artemis? I wanted to share here an essay I wrote exploring the concept. I was inspired by the premise of G. Ryan Faith's op-ed in SpaceNews last year, \"Artemis and Taming the Extraordinary\" (https://lnkd.in/eJPHJa_h), which (essentially) argues that the space community would do well to connect with the broader public by coopting commonly-held ritual. What better way to break out of our \"bubble?\" What's more common than a name? Naming competitions might draw skepticism with the likes of \"Boaty McBoatface,\" until you learn that *that* competition drove up internet traffic for the UK's Arctic research efforts by 100% - and is now featured as a touring educational campaign. At any rate, it's certainly not my original idea. A similar such naming competition has been proposed in NASA's (ultimately unpassed) authorizing legislation in recent years. For a space community that bemoans the public's seeming apathy, this could be low-hanging fruit we should at least consider for the Artemis program (and, certainly, for the \"Artemis Generation\" who's watching.) After all, \"a rose, by any other name, would smell as sweet.\" https://lnkd.in/ecJy-B_J Semi-related: for those interested in a fun journey through a unique thread of history, my essay was informed by (and the first piece covers) the various practices - past and present - of NASA's (and the commercial sector's) spacecraft naming conventions. The origins of Gemini 3 - Grissom's \"Molly Brown\" - was certainly a humorous surprise. https://lnkd.in/e3HuxDjN\n\nHighlighting an awesome speaking opportunity for young professionals and future leaders in the aerospace sector - get featured on stage and share your insights and voice with industry experts! The Space Generation Advisory Council's SGx2024 conference, led by the stellar Ashley Peter and Sapna Rao, will again feature special student and young professional \"lightning talk\" sessions. Each talk is expected to be 10 minutes long + 5 minutes of Q&A. The SGx2024 theme “Space Works for All” encourages talks which not only deliver thoughtful content, but also emphasize impact to the greater space community. This is a fantastic way to present your unique work and to \"get noticed,\" all while practicing your public speaking skills and gaining valuable experience! Interested? Apply here: https://lnkd.in/eUZ2p3Z4\n\nFlagging for friends in the DC area: the Washington Space Business Roundtable has a great luncheon planned for November 16 featuring NASA's Commercial Space Division Director, Phil McAlister. There's certainly tons going on in the world of commercial partnerships & plans at NASA - this should be a timely, helpful, and wide-ranging discussion! Proceeds go to WSBR's education fund, so it's a win-win. And, hey, given the timing, it could the last event of its kind for some while... Interested in joining? Register here: https://lnkd.in/e9Rg8Hsv Hope to see you there!\n\nSuper excited that applications for the Zed Factor Fellowship Class of 2024 are now open... ZFF's vision is to help foster a more representative aerospace sector - and our mission is to offer life-changing career opportunities for remarkably talented students from \"non-traditional\" communities. If you're an aerospace educator, mentor, executive, leader, or just someone who likewise sees the importance and value of a diverse aerospace workforce, please, don't hesitate to get in touch or help spread the word. We're certainly still super keen to partner with more host companies. Looking forward to another impactful year!\n\nIn July, a lineup of space sector leaders and experts afforded me the chance to (haphazardly) moderate a Beyond Earth Institute discussion on \"Making Tomorrow's Moon.\" We had a great conversation covering a wide range of near-term issues that our community faces with lunar development - including \"lunar economics,\" the technical challenges and requirements of sustainable operations, lunar regulations and law, and the prospects for cooperation - and competition - between the United States' Artemis and China's ILRS lunar initiatives. A very special thanks to our speakers for their generosity, their time, and their insights and perspectives: Dallas Bienhoff (Space Systems Architect, OffWorld), Laura Montgomery (Proprietor, Ground Based Space Matters, LLC), John Reed (Chief Rocket Scientist, United Launch Alliance (ULA), and Andrew Rothgaber (Director of Public Sector Business Development, ICON). Check it out! https://lnkd.in/ebEw9mPj\n\nIt was an exciting privilege to moderate last month's Beyond Earth Institute webinar - focused on the past, present, and future of human physiology and health in outer space. We had a wonderful and insightful conversation on the crucial next steps needed in space medicine and biological research to enable humans not only surviving, but thriving, in our future living and working off Earth. Wanted to share! A very special thanks to the expert panelists who so graciously lent us their time and knowledge (and forgave my total lack of expertise on the topic) - The Aerospace Corporation's Dr. Angie Bukley, the Translational Research Institute for Space Health's Dr. Jennifer Fogarty, the University of Colorado School of Medicine's Dr. Jay Lemery, and Polaris Dawn Mission Pilot Scott \"Kidd\" Poteet. And of course, to Steven Wolfe, Courtney Stadd, and others at Beyond Earth who afforded me this special opportunity. Enjoy! https://lnkd.in/ey5tAAjJ\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/gm6gAr6e To my friends at Virgin Orbit, my friends in the community, friends in aerospace, and beyond. Today's news about the company is devastating - especially because the people there are the best and brightest. I've pulled together a list of open opportunities that I've found posted on LinkedIn. I ask that you please share on LinkedIn and with your own teams - and if you're hiring, send a note to add you to the list. Let me know how I can help. Virgin Orbit"
