        "text": "WSBR.ORG Privacy Policy\n\nThis privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their ‘Personally Identifiable Information’ (PII) is being used online. PII, as described in US privacy law and information security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with our website.\n\nWhat personal information do we collect from the people that visit our blog, website or app?\n\nWhen ordering or registering on our site, as appropriate, you may be asked to enter your name, email address, mailing address, phone number, credit card information, Employer, Job Title or other details to help you with your experience.\n\nWhen do we collect information?\n\nWe collect information from you when you place an order or enter information on our site.\n\nHow do we use your information?\n\nWe may use the information we collect from you when you register, make a purchase, sign up for our newsletter, respond to a survey or marketing communication, surf the website, or use certain other site features in the following ways:\n\n• To quickly process your transactions.\n\nHow do we protect your information?\n\nOur website is scanned on a regular basis for security holes and known vulnerabilities in order to make your visit to our site as safe as possible.\n\nWe use regular Malware Scanning.\n\nYour personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. In addition, all sensitive/credit information you supply is encrypted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.\n\nWe implement a variety of security measures when a user places an order enters, submits, or accesses their information to maintain the safety of your personal information.\n\nAll transactions are processed through a gateway provider and are not stored or processed on our servers.\n\nDo we use ‘cookies’?\n\nWe do not use cookies for tracking purposes.\n\nYou can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser settings. Since browser is a little different, look at your browser’s Help Menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.\n\nIf you turn cookies off.\n\nThird-party disclosure\n\nWe do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your Personally Identifiable Information.\n\nThird-party links\n\nWe do not include or offer third-party products or services on our website.\n\nGoogle\n\nGoogle’s advertising requirements can be summed up by Google’s Advertising Principles. They are put in place to provide a positive experience for users. https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/1316548?hl=en\n\nWe have not enabled Google AdSense on our site but we may do so in the future.\n\nCalifornia Online Privacy Protection Act\n\nCalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. – See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf\n\nAccording to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:\n\nUsers can visit our site anonymously.\n\nOnce this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our website.\n\nOur Privacy Policy link includes the word ‘Privacy’ and can easily be found on the page specified above.\n\nYou will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes:\n\n• On our Privacy Policy Page\n\nCan change your personal information:\n\n• By emailing us\n\n• By calling us\n\nHow does our site handle Do Not Track signals?\n\nWe honor Do Not Track signals and Do Not Track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.\n\nDoes our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?\n\nIt’s also important to note that we do not allow third-party behavioral tracking.\n\nCOPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)\n\nWhen it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States’ consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children’s privacy and safety online.\n\nWe do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.\n\nDo we let third-parties, including ad networks or plug-ins collect PII from children under 13?\n\nFair Information Practices\n\nThe Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.\n\nIn order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:\n\nWe will notify you via email\n\n• Within 7 business days\n\nWe will notify the users via in-site notification\n\n• Within 7 business days\n\nWe also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.\n\nCAN SPAM Act\n\nThe CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.\n\nWe collect your email address in order to:\n\n• Process orders and to send information and updates pertaining to orders.\n\n• Send you additional information related to your product and/or service\n\nTo be in accordance with CANSPAM, we agree to the following:\n\n• Not use false or misleading subjects or email addresses.\n\n• Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way.\n\n• Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters.\n\n• Monitor third-party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used.\n\n• Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly.\n\n• Allow users to unsubscribe by using the link at the bottom of each email.\n\nIf at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, you can email us at:\n\n• Follow the instructions at the bottom of each email.\n\nand we will promptly remove you from ALL correspondence.\n\nContacting Us\n\nIf there are any questions regarding this privacy policy, you may contact us using the information below.\n\nwsbr.org\n\n515 2nd Street NE\n\nWashington, DC 20002\n\nUnited States\n\ninfo@wsbr.org\n\n202-547-6340\n\nLast Edited on 2024-30-04"
