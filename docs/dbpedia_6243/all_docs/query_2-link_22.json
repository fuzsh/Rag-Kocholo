It’s a virtual mini-seminar in every episode! I'm your host, Eric Willner, the Voice of Real Estate, founder of America’s longest-running daily radio show about real estate, and creator of The Automatic Landlord System for owning cash-flowing real estate profitably and hassle-free.\n\nThis week's shows have revolved around a vital theme: Real Estate Success: Step 5 – Make an Offer and Negotiate in The Step-by-Step Guide to Buying Real Estate.\n\nToday, we're summarizing this week's shows and wrapping up the week to set you up for success in your real estate journey. It’s been a jam-packed week of insights, strategies, and practical tips to help you move forward with confidence.\n\nDid you know? According to recent data, homes priced correctly and marketed well are still selling in an average of 21 days! That means the real estate market remains hot, but it’s all about playing your cards right. Making a smart offer and negotiating wisely can be the difference between securing a great deal or missing out entirely. This reinforces the importance of Step 5 in our guide, and why mastering negotiation is crucial to your success in real estate.\n\nBefore we dive into the meat of today's show, let me remind you of next week’s special FREE Workshops:\n\nTuesday at 8 p.m.: Path to Home Ownership Introduction – Online by Invitation\n\nWednesday at 8:30 p.m.: Financial Edge University Overview – Online by Invitation\n\nRemember, we're in full \"Challenge\" mode with the 72-Hour Challenge, and you can join us NOW by texting \"Challenge\" to 561-861-2366. Don’t miss this chance to take control of your financial future.\n\nNow, let’s get into the heart of this week’s theme: why NOW is the time to buy real estate. Making an offer and negotiating isn’t just about price—it's about understanding the market, knowing your financial position, and leveraging the power of real estate to create wealth. Let me give you 3 to 5 compelling reasons why this is critical:\n\nLeverage Interest Rates: Even with fluctuations, today's rates are historically low compared to decades past. Securing financing at a good rate is key to long-term profitability.\n\nMaximize Your Returns: By making a strategic offer and negotiating effectively, you can increase your return on investment and build wealth faster.\n\nOpportunity Abounds: The current market offers unique opportunities for buyers to capitalize on distressed properties, motivated sellers, and emerging markets.\n\nWealth Creation: Real estate remains the IDEAL investment because it generates income, appreciates over time, allows for depreciation benefits, is easily leveraged, and builds equity.\n\nLong-Term Security: Real estate is a tangible asset that provides long-term financial security and stability, especially in uncertain economic times.\n\nUltimately, the goal is to achieve financial freedom as an investor. To do that, you need a “B” (a business) to fund your “I” (your investments). The Real Estate Show can be your roadmap to get you there! BUT, you need to start NOW.\n\nMany people get stuck in the role of an employee because they fear the risks of becoming a business owner. They lack a plan, and they feel overwhelmed by the complexities of real estate. But that’s where we come in. By listening to The Real Estate Show, we can help you get unstuck. We cover everything you need to know, from building a solid financial foundation to leveraging multiple streams of income.\n\nAs we wrap up this week, we’ve laid out the roadmap to safely create and keep wealth through affordable homeownership, a written financial plan, and multiple streams of income. It all starts with getting yourself organized, educated, and having a financial edge.\n\nToday’s Show and Better Credit is Brought to You By: www.TimeToFixMyCredit.com. Remember to text the word EDGE to 561-861-2366 to get your financial edge today!\n\nNow, let’s break down this week’s episodes and how they all tie back to our theme of making an offer and negotiating for real estate success.\n\nMonday: Monday on a Mission\n\nOn Mondays, we set the stage for the week ahead, and this Monday was no different. We kicked off the week by diving deep into the importance of making offers and negotiating. The real estate market can be competitive, and being prepared to make a strong offer is essential to success.\n\nHere are the three key points from Monday’s show:\n\n· Real Estate Success Theme: Focus on Step 5—Making an Offer and Negotiating in the step-by-step guide to buying real estate.\n\n· Importance of Negotiation: Highlighted the crucial role of effective negotiation in securing the best real estate deals.\n\n· 10 Key Reasons: Provided ten solid reasons why mastering the offer and negotiation process is vital for real estate success.\n\n· S.M.A.R.T Goals Model: Integrated S.M.A.R.T goals into the negotiation process for strategic and measurable outcomes.\n\n· Special Free Workshops: Promoted upcoming free online workshops for real estate education and success.\n\nKnow Your Numbers: Before making any offer, you need to know your financial limits. This includes understanding your financing options, knowing your credit score, and having a clear idea of what you can afford. This preparation is crucial to making offers with confidence and strength.\n\nUnderstand the Market: A big part of successful negotiation is understanding the current market conditions. Is it a buyer’s market or a seller’s market? Knowing where the power lies will help you negotiate better terms.\n\nGet Pre-Approved: In a competitive market, being pre-approved for a mortgage can give you an edge over other buyers. Sellers want to know that you’re serious and capable of closing the deal.\n\nThis mission for Monday was all about preparation. Getting your ducks in a row before making an offer ensures you’re ready to negotiate effectively and secure the best possible deal.\n\nTuesday: Tools, Tips, and Techniques\n\nTuesday was all about giving you the tools, tips, and techniques to succeed in real estate. We continued to emphasize why NOW is the perfect time to make an offer and negotiate a deal, especially with the right tools in hand.\n\nHere are some of the tools and strategies we discussed:\n\n· Understanding market value is crucial for making a competitive offer.\n\n· Always come prepared with a pre-approval letter to strengthen your negotiating position.\n\n· Set your budget and stick to it to avoid financial pitfalls.\n\n· Use contingencies wisely to protect your interests.\n\n· Work with a skilled real estate agent to navigate the complexities of the negotiation process.\n\nThe Power of a Comparative Market Analysis (CMA): A CMA helps you understand the value of the property you’re interested in by comparing it to similar properties in the area. This tool is essential for making a fair and informed offer.\n\nUsing Contingencies Wisely: Contingencies can protect you as a buyer, but overloading your offer with contingencies can make it less attractive to sellers. We discussed how to use contingencies strategically to balance protection with appeal.\n\nThe Art of the Counteroffer: Negotiation often involves back-and-forth counteroffers. We covered techniques to handle counteroffers effectively, so you can come out on top without alienating the seller.\n\nBy equipping yourself with the right tools and techniques, you can navigate the offer and negotiation process more smoothly and successfully.\n\nWednesday: Midweek Mortgage, Market, and Money Report\n\nWednesday’s show focused on the latest trends in the mortgage market and how these trends affect your real estate strategy. Understanding the current market conditions is key to making informed offers and negotiating the best deals.\n\nHere are three key takeaways from Wednesday’s show:\n\nMortgage Rates Are Easing – The current average for a 30-year fixed mortgage is 6.57%, but rates are expected to soften in 2024. Now is a strategic time to buy.\n\nRefinancing Opportunities Are Growing – With refinancing activity surging 35% in one week, homeowners are taking advantage of even slight rate drops to save money.\n\nPerception vs. Reality – Despite 59% of Americans believing we’re in a recession, the economy remains strong. This creates opportunities for savvy real estate investors.\n\nWorkshops and Resources – Join us for our free online workshops and take control of your financial future. Text “Home” or “Edge” to [Your Show Text Number] for more information.\n\nInterest Rate Trends: We discussed how interest rates have been fluctuating and what that means for buyers. Lower interest rates can provide more favorable financing options, making it a great time to lock in a mortgage.\n\nCredit is King: We emphasized the importance of maintaining great credit to secure the best mortgage rates. If your credit isn’t where it needs to be, now is the time to work on improving it to position yourself for better offers.\n\nMarket Opportunities: We also highlighted current market opportunities, including areas where home prices are still appreciating and where buyers can get good deals. Knowing where the opportunities are can help you make better offers and negotiate from a position of strength.\n\nReal estate is still the best vehicle to advance, whether you’re in the E (employee), S (self-employed), B (business owner), or I (investor) quadrant. Our market news shows that, no matter where you are now, real estate can be the key to moving forward.\n\nThursday: ATM – About The Money\n\nThursday’s show was all about the money—specifically, why NOW is the time to invest in real estate. We continued our discussion on making offers and negotiating, but with a financial focus.\n\nHere are five key points from Thursday’s show:\n\n· Focus on Real Estate Success: Step 5 in the buying process is crucial—making an offer and negotiating effectively.\n\n· Importance of Timing: NOW is the ideal time to buy real estate, especially when equipped with the right financial knowledge and negotiation skills.\n\n· Rules of Money: Knowing key financial principles like the 1% Rule, the 4% Rule, and the Rule of 72 gives you an edge in real estate and personal finances.\n\n· Workshops and Community: The Real Estate Show offers workshops like the Financial Edge Academy and the 72-Hour Money Challenge to empower listeners with money-smart strategies.\n\n· Three Options for Real Estate Action: DIY with the upcoming Automatic Landlord 2.0, DWY with exclusive coaching, and DFY for deals offering high ROI.\n\n· Calls to Action: Engage with workshops, financial education, and credit improvement opportunities to achieve real estate success.\n\nUnderstanding the Rules of Money: We reviewed key financial principles like the 1% Rule, the 4% Rule, and the Rule of 72, all of which can give you an edge in your finances and your real estate investments.\n\nLeverage and Cash Flow: Real estate offers unique opportunities to leverage other people’s money (through mortgages) and create cash flow through rental income. These are powerful tools for building long-term wealth.\n\nFinancial Literacy: We talked about the importance of financial literacy and how understanding your finances can help you make better decisions when making offers and negotiating.\n\nMultiple Streams of Income: We emphasized the importance of diversifying your income through real estate investments. Having multiple streams of income can provide financial security and freedom.\n\nThe Power of a Written Plan: We encouraged listeners to create a written financial plan. Having a clear plan can help you stay focused and make smarter decisions as you move forward in your real estate journey.\n\nToday’s Show and Better Credit is Brought to You By: www.TimeToFixMyCredit.com.

In real estate, understanding these rules helps you evaluate investments, predict returns, and ultimately, succeed.\n\nDid you know that the negotiation process can start long before you even set foot in a property? Savvy investors do their research, understand market trends, and use financial strategies to craft offers that not only get accepted but set them up for long-term success. Negotiation isn’t just about the price—it’s about terms, contingencies, and ensuring that the deal makes sense for you.\n\nLast night, we hosted a great Wednesday night workshop, the Financial Edge Academy Overview.

Together, let’s make your money work for you!\n\nBack to the show: You know, I believe every month should be Financial Literacy Month. It’s officially observed in April, but why wait? Every day is an opportunity to educate yourself, make smarter financial decisions, and move closer to financial freedom. That’s why I’m so passionate about these workshops and this radio show—it’s about empowering you with knowledge and tools to take control of your financial future.\n\nNow, back to today’s theme: Real Estate Success: Step 5—Make an Offer and Negotiate. This step is crucial, and here are 5 compelling reasons why:\n\nYou Set the Terms: When you make an offer, you’re not just offering a price. You’re setting the terms of the deal—down payment, contingencies, closing date, and more. These terms can protect your investment and put you in a position of strength.\n\nLeverage Your Position: Understanding the seller’s motivation allows you to negotiate effectively. Is the seller looking for a quick close? Do they need flexibility on the move-out date? Knowing these details gives you leverage to negotiate a better deal.\n\nCreate Win-Win Scenarios: The best negotiations leave both parties feeling satisfied. By understanding the seller’s needs and crafting your offer accordingly, you can create a win-win situation that increases the likelihood of your offer being accepted.\n\nMaximize Your Investment: Every dollar you save in negotiations is a dollar you can reinvest or use to improve the property. Skilled negotiation directly impacts your return on investment.\n\nMitigate Risk: By negotiating the right contingencies—such as financing and inspection—you protect yourself from unforeseen issues that could jeopardize the deal or cost you down the road.\n\nSo, as you can see, Step 5 is all about putting yourself in the driver’s seat of your real estate transaction. It’s not just about closing the deal—it’s about closing it on terms that benefit you.\n\nBefore we move on, remember that today’s show is brought to you by www.TimeToFixMyCredit.com.

I’ve always believed in the importance of a three-pronged approach—whether it's in real estate, business, or life. A two-legged stool won’t stand, but add a third leg, and you’ve got stability. The same goes for your financial strategy.\n\nHere’s what I believe:\n\nEveryone should buy a house—Be a homeowner. Real estate is the IDEAL investment—providing income, deductions, equity, appreciation, and leverage.\n\nEveryone should have their house in financial order—with a written financial and life plan.\n\nEveryone should own a business—One that pays you and gives you tax benefits. This is the foundation of the Financial Edge.\n\nTo win the money game, you need a team. That’s why we have a 5-Star System to help you continuously improve and win:\n\nLevel 1: Save—keep more of what you already make.\n\nLevel 2: Make—invest smarter and grow your wealth.\n\nLevel 3: Multiply—leverage your assets to create more income.\n\nThe Power of Three—whether it’s in real estate, financial planning, or business—gives you a solid foundation to build upon.\n\nAnd speaking of building, there are three ways you can take action today:\n\nDIY: Do it yourself with Version 2.0 of The Automatic Landlord System—coming soon!\n\nDWY: Done with you through exclusive coaching for those serious about success.\n\nDFY: Done for you—deals that start at a 10% total ROI, ready for you to step into.\n\nSo, which path will you choose?\n\nAs we wrap up today’s show, I want to remind you that The Real Estate Show is more than just talk—it’s a virtual seminar every weekday, and it’s designed to help you take action.

My name is Eric Willner, known as the Voice of Real Estate, and I'm the founder of this program and creator of The Automatic Landlord System for owning cash-flowing real estate “Profitably and Hassle-Free.” This show is a virtual real estate seminar in every episode, designed to empower you with the knowledge and strategies you need to thrive in today’s market.\n\nToday is our “Wednesday Midweek Mortgage & Market Report” Edition, and we’re continuing with our theme: Real Estate Success: Step 5 is to Make an Offer and Negotiate in The Step-by-Step Guide to Buying Real Estate.\n\nMaking an offer and negotiating are key steps in securing your real estate success. But let me ask you this—Did you know that over 80% of home buyers report feeling unprepared for the negotiation process? Or that negotiating effectively can save you thousands of dollars, or even make or break your deal? And did you know that understanding the current mortgage market can give you a serious edge in negotiations?\n\nThese are just a few things you need to know to ensure your real estate transaction goes smoothly. Today, we’re diving deep into why this step—making an offer and negotiating—is crucial in your real estate journey.\n\nThe Importance of Making an Offer and Negotiating in Real Estate\n\nThe decision to buy real estate is one of the biggest investments most people make in their lifetimes. So why is negotiating the right way so important? It’s simple: when done effectively, negotiating can be the difference between achieving financial success through real estate or missing out on key opportunities. Real estate negotiations aren’t just about price—they involve the terms, contingencies, closing dates, and so much more.\n\nBefore we get into the meat of the show, let me remind you about this week’s special FREE Workshops:\n\nTuesday 8pm: Path to Home Ownership Introduction – Online by Invitation. Text \"Home.\"\n\nWednesday 8:30pm: Financial Edge University “101 Overview” – Online by Invitation. Text \"Edge.\"\n\nDo finances challenge you? Most people say YES!! That's why we offer The Financial Edge, an education and support system designed to give you the financial edge you need to succeed. We believe in a 3-pronged approach:\n\nBe a Homeowner: Everyone should own a home.\n\nGet Financially Organized: Your house should be in financial order with a written financial/life plan.\n\nStart a Business: Owning a business that pays you and offers tax benefits is key to long-term financial success.\n\nTake the 72-Hour Challenge! Get organized, get educated, and get ready to take the next step toward financial independence.\n\nNow, let’s dive back into why NOW is the time to buy real estate, building on what we’ve discussed earlier this week. In the ever-evolving world of real estate, staying informed is your greatest asset. The headlines today offer valuable insights that directly impact your real estate decisions.\n\nToday’s Top Trending Topics for the Midweek Market Report\n\nToday’s National 30-Year Mortgage Interest Rate Trends\n\nAs of Wednesday, August 14, 2024, the average interest rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage is 6.57%, a slight rise from last week. If you're considering refinancing, the current average rate is 6.55%. This slight fluctuation highlights the importance of staying vigilant in your mortgage search. Even a small difference in rates can save you thousands of dollars over the life of your loan. Text \"Loan\" to 561-861-2366 to stay updated with the latest offers.\n\nMortgage Refinancing Surges 35% in One Week as Rates Drop\n\nWe’re seeing a significant surge in refinancing applications—up 35% last week alone. Why? The average interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances fell slightly to 6.54%. Even though it’s a small drop, it's enough to create a wave of refinancing activity. Homeowners are acting fast, and you should be aware of how these shifts could impact your real estate decisions. Whether you’re considering a refinance or a new purchase, this is a reminder of how staying informed can help you take advantage of opportunities in the market.\n\nConsumer Prices Rose 0.2% in July\n\nInflation remains a key player in the real estate market. In July, the consumer price index increased by 0.2%, with inflation holding steady at 2.9% annually. What does this mean for you as a real estate investor? Well, the steady rise in prices keeps the Federal Reserve considering interest rate adjustments, which in turn affects mortgage rates. This trend reinforces the importance of making your real estate move sooner rather than later—locking in rates before they rise.\n\n59% of Americans Falsely Believe We’re in a Recession\n\nDespite persistent inflation and high interest rates, the U.S. economy has remained strong. However, 59% of Americans believe that we’re currently in a recession, a perception driven by higher costs and economic uncertainty. This disconnect between the actual state of the economy and public sentiment impacts real estate decisions, as many potential buyers and sellers hesitate to act. But here’s the truth: real estate remains one of the best investments you can make, recession or not. Understanding the real economic landscape can give you the confidence to move forward in your real estate journey.\n\nRemember, real estate is the best investment you can make. The key is to stay informed and be strategic in your approach.\n\nCall to Action: Take the Financial Edge Today!\n\nI want to remind you—text the word EDGE to 561-861-2366 to get started with The Financial Edge. Whether it’s getting your finances in order, starting your own business, or finding the perfect property, we’re here to guide you every step of the way.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs we wrap up today’s edition of The Real Estate Show, let’s recap the key takeaways:\n\nNow is the time to make your move in real estate. Interest rates are shifting, and opportunities are plentiful for those ready to act.\n\nNegotiation is critical—whether you’re buying, selling, or refinancing, knowing how to negotiate can save you money and maximize your investment.\n\nStay informed about market trends like mortgage rates, inflation, and consumer sentiment to make the most strategic real estate decisions.\n\nThank you for tuning in to The Real Estate Show, where every episode is a seminar designed to help you succeed in real estate.

Today’s theme is all about making an offer and negotiating—two critical steps that can make or break your real estate deal. Knowing how to navigate these waters is essential for securing the best terms and ultimately achieving your real estate goals.\n\nBut before we dive deep, let’s take a moment for our Transformation Tuesday meditation:\n\n'Lord, as we embark on this Transformation Tuesday, we seek Your transformative power in our work and personal lives. Guide us to be agents of positive change in the real estate landscape. Bless the properties we handle, that they may become places of warmth, security, and transformation for those who dwell within. Amen.'\"\n\nDid You Know?\n\n\"Now, let’s get into some thought-provoking questions related to today’s theme:\n\nDid you know that the average homebuyer loses out on their first two offers due to poor negotiation tactics?\n\nDid you know that understanding market conditions can save you thousands of dollars when making an offer?\n\nDid you know that a well-negotiated deal can increase your property’s ROI by up to 15%?\n\nThese are just a few of the alarming statistics about the current market. It’s important to be aware of the challenges you may face so that you can plan accordingly. Awareness and preparation are key to making smart decisions that will benefit you in the long run.\"\n\nThe Importance of Making an Offer and Negotiating\n\n\"In today’s highlighted Tools and Techniques segment, we’ll dive into the practical aspects of making an offer and negotiating effectively. Yesterday, I shared with you 10 reasons why making an offer and negotiating is critical to your real estate success. Now, let’s break them down step by step so you can implement them in your next transaction.\n\nUnderstanding Market Value: Before making an offer, it’s crucial to understand the market value of the property. This includes looking at comparable sales, understanding the neighborhood trends, and knowing the property's history. Armed with this knowledge, you can make a competitive offer that reflects the property's true worth.\n\nPre-Approval is Power: Always come to the negotiating table with a pre-approval letter. It shows sellers you’re serious and financially capable, giving you a stronger position when negotiating terms and price.\n\nKnow Your Limits: Set your budget before making an offer. This includes not only the purchase price but also closing costs, potential repairs, and other expenses. Knowing your limits will prevent you from getting caught up in a bidding war and overextending yourself financially.\n\nMake a Strong Initial Offer: A lowball offer can be off-putting to sellers and may result in them not taking you seriously. Instead, make a strong initial offer that is fair and reflects the market value. This sets a positive tone for the negotiations.\n\nUse Contingencies to Your Advantage: Contingencies, such as home inspections and financing, give you leverage in negotiations. If issues arise during the inspection, for example, you can renegotiate the price or ask for repairs.\n\nStay Calm and Collected: Negotiations can be intense, but it’s important to stay calm and collected. Emotional decisions often lead to mistakes. Keep your end goals in mind and stick to your strategy.\n\nUnderstand Seller Motivations: Knowing why the seller is selling can give you an edge in negotiations. Are they in a hurry to sell? Are they emotionally attached to the property? Use this information to craft an offer that meets their needs while still benefiting you.\n\nBe Ready to Walk Away: One of the strongest positions you can have in a negotiation is the ability to walk away. If the deal isn’t right, don’t be afraid to step back. There are always other opportunities.\n\nWork with a Skilled Real Estate Agent: A good real estate agent can be your best asset during negotiations. They understand the market, know how to communicate effectively, and can guide you through the complexities of making an offer.\n\nGet Everything in Writing: Verbal agreements are not legally binding in real estate transactions. Make sure every detail is documented in writing to protect your interests and avoid any misunderstandings later on.\n\nRemember, The Real Estate Show is your partner in real estate. Our expertise and experience can be the difference between a successful and stressful transaction.\"\n\nCall to Action\n\n==è>>> ADDITIONAL ACTION STEPS\n\n1. Secure Favorable Terms: Negotiation allows you to potentially save money on the purchase price, secure closing cost credits, and negotiate for repairs.\n\nAction Step: Research average closing costs in your target area and factor those into your budget. When crafting your initial offer, consider leaving room for negotiation on price and concessions.\n\n2. Competitive Advantage: A well-crafted offer and skilled negotiation can help you stand out in a competitive market.\n\nAction Step: Make sure your offer is strong – pre-approval is crucial, and a flexible closing date can be appealing to sellers. Highlight your qualifications as a buyer and express genuine interest in the property.\n\n3. Setting Expectations: The negotiation process helps establish a clear understanding of expectations for both you and the seller.\n\nAction Step: Be clear and concise in your offer – Outline contingencies such as financing and inspections. Be prepared to communicate effectively throughout the negotiation process.\n\n4. Building Value: A successful negotiation can secure a property below market value, increasing your potential return on investment.\n\nAction Step: Research recent sales data in your desired area to understand fair market value. Be confident in your offer and your ability to negotiate effectively.\n\n[Sponsor Break: Today's Show is Brought to You By: TimeToFixMyCredit.com - Text 'Credit' to [Your Show Text Number]]\n\n5.

As the founder of this show and the creator of The Automatic Landlord System for owning cash-flowing real estate profitably and hassle-free, I’m excited to bring you another episode of what is essentially a virtual real estate seminar in every episode.\n\nToday is the ‘Monday On A Mission’ Edition of The Real Estate Show, and we’re continuing our journey through the Step-by-Step Guide to Buying Real Estate. This week, we’re diving into Step 5: Making an Offer and Negotiating. This step is where the rubber meets the road, and it's where a deal can be won or lost. Whether you're a first-time homebuyer or a seasoned investor, understanding how to make a solid offer and negotiate effectively is critical to your success.\n\n[Theme Introduction]\n\nDid you know that nearly 60% of homebuyers in the U.S. say they’ve had a deal fall through during the negotiation stage? That statistic highlights just how important it is to master the art of making an offer and negotiating. Today’s show is all about Real Estate Success: Step 5 – Making an Offer and Negotiating in the step-by-step guide to buying real estate.\n\nBefore we dive deeper, let me remind you of this week’s special FREE Workshops:\n\nTuesday at 8 PM: Path to Home Ownership Introduction – Online by Invitation. Text ‘PATH’ to 561-861-2366 to join.\n\nWednesday night at 8:30 PM: Financial Edge University Overview – Online by Invitation. Again, text ‘PATH’ to 561-861-2366 to secure your spot.\n\n[Main Content: The Importance of Making an Offer and Negotiating]\n\nReal estate requires skill, strategy, adaptability, and an unwavering determination to cross the finish line successfully. The road to financial victory may not be a straight path, but it's certainly an exhilarating one! So, why is Step 5 – Making an Offer and Negotiating – so crucial in your real estate journey?\n\nHere are 10 solid reasons why I believe this step is pivotal to your success:\n\nIt Sets the Tone: The offer you make establishes your seriousness and sets the tone for the entire negotiation process.\n\nIt Defines the Financials: A well-crafted offer can save you thousands by ensuring you're not overpaying.\n\nIt Shows Your Knowledge: Understanding market conditions and comparable sales (comps) demonstrates your knowledge and strengthens your negotiating position.\n\nIt Builds Rapport: The negotiation phase is a great opportunity to build rapport with the seller, which can be beneficial if you need to renegotiate later.\n\nIt Puts You in Control: By making the first offer, you set the anchor price, which influences all subsequent negotiations.\n\nIt Tests the Seller's Motivation: The seller’s reaction to your offer will give you insights into their motivations and flexibility.\n\nIt Creates Opportunities for Concessions: Skilled negotiation can lead to the seller covering closing costs, making repairs, or offering other concessions.\n\nIt Mitigates Risks: Careful negotiation helps you avoid common pitfalls, such as waiving contingencies that could protect you.\n\nIt Enhances Your Investment Return: Getting a better deal on the purchase price or terms can significantly increase your return on investment.\n\nIt Concludes the Deal: Finally, negotiation is what brings the deal to a close – and in real estate, nothing is final until the ink is dry.\n\nLet’s break for a quick reminder: Today’s show and better credit are brought to you by TimeToFixMyCredit.com. If you’re ready to build your financial edge, text the word ‘EDGE’ to 561-861-2366.\n\nNow, let’s revisit the Top 5 reasons why Step 5: Making an Offer and Negotiating is so essential, using the S.M.A.R.T. Goals model:\n\nSpecific: In the context of real estate, specificity is king. When you make an offer, you need to know exactly what you’re willing to pay and what contingencies you require. Vague terms can lead to misunderstandings and failed negotiations.\n\nMeasurable: You should always be able to measure the success of your negotiation. Whether it’s the price reduction, the closing costs covered, or the repairs included, measurable goals keep you on track.\n\nAchievable: While it’s great to aim high, your goals must be achievable. Setting an offer too low might insult the seller and close off negotiations before they even begin.\n\nRelevant: Your offer must align with your broader real estate strategy. If you’re investing for cash flow, make sure your offer price allows for profitable rental income.\n\nTime-bound: Putting a time limit on your offer ensures that negotiations progress swiftly and that the seller doesn’t use your offer to shop for better ones.\n\n[Mid-Show Sponsor Break]\n\nAnd now, a quick word from our sponsor. Today’s show and better credit are brought to you by TimeToFixMyCredit.com. Remember, good credit is the key to unlocking great deals in real estate. Text the word ‘EDGE’ to 561-861-2366 to learn more.\n\n[Continuing the Discussion]\n\nReal estate success is not just about finding the right property; it’s about negotiating the right terms. Negotiation is where you can really add value to your investment, and it’s why this step is so critical. Let’s revisit the Top 5 Reasons why Making an Offer and Negotiating is essential:\n\nSetting the Tone: A strong offer sets a strong tone for negotiations. It shows the seller that you’re serious and that you’ve done your homework.\n\nFinancial Definition: Negotiating effectively ensures you’re not overpaying for the property, which can make or break your investment.\n\nKnowledge Demonstration: By backing your offer with data and market insights, you gain the upper hand in negotiations.\n\nBuilding Rapport: Establishing a positive relationship with the seller can lead to smoother negotiations and potential concessions.\n\nControlling the Process: When you make the first offer, you control the conversation and anchor the price.\n\nBefore we move on, let me remind you again: Today’s show is brought to you by TimeToFixMyCredit.com.

The radio show is called “The Real Estate Show,” hosted by me, Eric Willner, known as the Voice of Real Estate and founder of America’s longest-running daily radio show about real estate. I’m also the creator of The Automatic Landlord System for Owning Cash Flowing Real Estate “Profitably and Hassle-Free.” It’s a virtual real estate seminar in every episode. AND it’s the only show that puts money back in your pocket!\n\nAttention: Did You Know?\n\nDid you know that choosing the right real estate agent could be the single most important decision you make in your real estate journey? Whether you’re buying your first home, selling a property, or investing in real estate, the right agent can make or break your success. Today is Thursday, where we say it’s the “ATM – About The Money” Edition of The Real Estate Show, and it’s where we continue to talk about why NOW is the time to buy real estate.\n\nToday, we’re diving deep into Real Estate Success: Step 4 – Finding the Right Agent in our Step-by-Step Guide to Buying Real Estate. And it’s not just about finding any agent; it’s about finding the one who knows “The Rules of Money.” Yes, there are Rules of Money, and if your realtor doesn’t know them, you could be leaving thousands of dollars on the table. Let’s talk about these rules.\n\nInterest: The Rules of Money\n\nDo you know the 1% Rule? The 4% Rule? The Rule of 72? These aren’t just abstract concepts—they’re critical tools that you and your agent should understand to get the edge in your finances.\n\nThe 1% Rule: A quick way to evaluate the potential profitability of an investment property. Your agent should use this to assess whether a rental property’s monthly rent is at least 1% of the purchase price. If they aren’t talking about this, you might want to ask why not.\n\nThe 4% Rule: A principle used in retirement planning, but also applicable when you’re considering your real estate investments as part of a long-term financial strategy. An agent who understands this can help you align your real estate investments with your broader financial goals.\n\nThe Rule of 72: A simple formula to estimate the number of years required to double the value of an investment at a fixed annual rate of return. Knowing this can help your agent guide you in making smart investment decisions that maximize your returns.\n\nBut here’s a key question: Did you know that an agent’s negotiation skills could save or cost you thousands of dollars? The right agent isn’t just about finding a house—it’s about maximizing value, from negotiation to closing.\n\nLast night at our Wednesday night workshop, we had a great session at the Financial Edge Academy Overview. We’re building a community of Streetsmart – Money Smart people who know how to leverage these rules to their advantage. And we’re showing you how to do it too with our 72 Hour Challenge!\n\nAnd speaking of challenges, if you want to get ahead, join us online by invitation simply by texting EDGE to 561-861-2366. Let’s build that financial edge together.\n\nDesire: Why Finding the Right Agent is Crucial\n\nSo, do you see why Real Estate Success: Step 4 is to find the right agent in our Step-by-Step Guide to Buying Real Estate? Let’s break it down with five compelling reasons:\n\nMarket Knowledge: The right agent has deep insights into local market trends. They can help you price your property correctly if you’re selling or negotiate the best price if you’re buying. For example, pricing a home 2-3% more accurately could earn you thousands more on a sale.\n\nNegotiation Skills: As I mentioned earlier, an agent who saves you just 1% on a $300,000 home puts $3,000 directly back into your pocket. That’s money that could be invested elsewhere or used to enhance your new property.\n\nTime Efficiency: The right agent streamlines the process, reducing the time your property sits on the market or helping you find a home faster. Every day your property isn’t sold could cost you hundreds in holding costs. A good agent minimizes these expenses.\n\nNetwork of Professionals: From inspectors to mortgage brokers, the right agent has a network that can help you throughout the transaction. This network ensures that you’re getting the best advice and services at every step.\n\nLong-Term Strategy: The right agent isn’t just focused on the transaction at hand; they’re thinking about your long-term financial health. They can advise you on how this purchase or sale fits into your broader financial plan, ensuring that your decisions today set you up for success tomorrow.\n\nToday’s show, and BETTER CREDIT, is brought to you by www.TimeToFixMyCredit.com. Don’t let bad credit hold you back from achieving your real estate goals! Text CREDIT to 561-861-2366 to learn more about building your financial edge and unlocking real estate success through good credit!\n\nAction: Take the Next Step\n\nNow, let’s continue our discussion on why NOW is the time to buy real estate, but let’s focus specifically on how choosing the right realtor can directly impact your financial bottom line. Let’s quantify it:\n\nNegotiation Savings: If your realtor’s negotiation skills save you 1% on a $300,000 home, that’s a $3,000 saving.\n\nAccurate Pricing: Local market knowledge might help you price a home more accurately, potentially earning you an additional 2-3% on the sale price.\n\nEfficiency Savings: Efficiency in the process could reduce holding costs by a couple of thousand dollars.\n\nWhile these are just examples, they illustrate how the right realtor can add tangible value to a real estate transaction. It’s important to interview potential realtors and discuss their approach to these aspects to ensure you find someone who can deliver these financial benefits. Remember, the right realtor is not just about the transaction; it’s about the value they bring to the entire process.\n\nToday’s Show is Brought to You By: www.TimeToFixMyCredit.com, our partner in bringing you home ownership regardless of credit, regardless of down payment.

This applies to your financial strategy as well.\n\nThe Power of 3: The Three Beliefs\n\nI believe everyone should buy a house – Be a homeowner. Owning real estate is the cornerstone of wealth-building.\n\nI believe everyone should have that house in financial order – With a written financial/life plan. Planning is key to ensuring your investment pays off.\n\nI believe everyone should own a business – A business that pays them AND gives them tax benefits. This is part of your financial edge. Your financial team should be focused on these three pillars.\n\nLet’s talk about it. We have a 2-Level, 5-Star System to WIN at The Money Game. It’s not just about buying or selling real estate; it’s about doing it smarter, better, and with a long-term strategy.\n\nL1 – Save: Save more of what you already make. This is about efficiency and making sure your money isn’t being wasted.\n\nL2 – Make: Make more/invest what you make, growing it wisely—smarter, not harder.\n\nL3 – Multiply: Leverage! This is where the magic happens. By multiplying your investments and leveraging them, you can grow your wealth exponentially.\n\nThe Power of 3—it’s a triple play, a triple crown, a holy trinity... Three is the smallest prime number, but it’s also the most powerful when it comes to building a stable financial future.\n\nThree Options to Take Action Today\n\nDIY – Version 2.0 of The Automatic Landlord is coming soon.

Understanding the news helps you get organized and gain a financial edge.\n\nHere are the top trending topics for today’s update:\n\nToday's National 30-Year Mortgage Interest Rate Trends\n\nAs of Wednesday, August 07, 2024, the current average interest rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage is 6.56%, falling 29 basis points from a week ago. For homeowners looking to refinance, today’s current average 30-year refinance interest rate is 6.58%, down 31 basis points since the same time last week. Additionally, the average 15-year fixed refinance interest rate is 6.07%, down 33 basis points from a week ago. The consensus is that mortgage rates will ease down in 2024.\n\nDaily Rate Lock Advisory\n\nThere is no relevant economic data set for release today or tomorrow morning. We are seeing a reversal of part of yesterday’s flight to safety rally in bonds. With stocks showing solid gains this morning, some investors are shifting funds away from bonds. This is a common situation that likely will be in play for the next couple of days as the stock markets either stabilize or start another downward move. If stocks give back this morning’s early gains, bonds and mortgage rates should benefit.\n\nWeekly Mortgage Refinance Demand Soars 16% as Rates Sink to Lowest Level in Over a Year\n\nKey Points:\n\nInterest Rate Decrease: The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances ($766,550 or less) decreased to 6.55% from 6.82%.\n\nRefinance Applications Surge: Applications to refinance a home loan jumped 16% for the week and were 59% higher than the same week one year ago.\n\nPurchase Applications Increase: Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home increased just 1% for the week but were still 11% lower than the same week one year ago.\n\nMortgage interest rates dropped last week to the lowest level since May 2023, causing a surge in mortgage demand from both homebuyers and especially current homeowners. Total mortgage application volume rose 6.9% last week compared with the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association’s seasonally adjusted index. Volume was at the highest level since January of this year.\n\n“Mortgage rates decreased across the board last week following dovish communication from the Federal Reserve and a weak jobs report, which added to increased concerns of an economy slowing more rapidly than expected,” said Joel Kan, vice president and deputy chief economist at the MBA, in a release.\n\nCall to Action: Text the word EDGE to 561-861-2366.\n\nMortgage Rates Plunge to the Lowest Level in More Than a Year After Weak Employment Report\n\nKey Points:\n\nRate Drop: The average rate on the popular 30-year fixed mortgage dropped 22 basis points to 6.4% Friday, according to Mortgage News Daily.\n\nImpact of Employment Report: The drop followed a weaker-than-expected monthly employment report, which sent bond yields falling fast.\n\nMarket Reactions: The recent high on the 30-year fixed mortgage was 7.52% in late April, and home sales have been falling ever since.\n\nThe average rate on the popular 30-year fixed mortgage dropped 22 basis points to 6.4% Friday, according to Mortgage News Daily. That is the lowest rate since April 2023. The 15-year fixed rate fell to 5.89%, its lowest level since early May 2023.\n\nThe drop followed a weaker-than-expected monthly employment report, which sent bond yields falling fast. Mortgage rates loosely follow the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury.\n\nCall to Action: Text the word EDGE to 561-861-2366.\n\nRemember: It’s a stone cold fact that Real Estate is THE best investment.

My name is Eric Willner, known as the Voice of Real Estate and founder of America’s longest-running daily radio show about real estate and also creator of The Automatic Landlord System for Owning Cash Flowing Real Estate ‘Profitably and Hassle-Free.’ It’s a virtual real estate seminar in every episode.\n\nToday, let's talk about success and failure and how to achieve Real Estate Success: Step 4 is to Find the Right Agent in The Step-by-Step Guide to Buying Real Estate. But before we dive into that, let's take a moment for our Tuesday Meditation, which we like to call \"Transformation Tuesday.\"\n\n\"Lord, as we embark on this Transformation Tuesday, we seek Your transformative power in our work and personal lives. Guide us to be agents of positive change in the real estate landscape. Bless the properties we handle, that they may become places of warmth, security, and transformation for those who dwell within. Amen.\"\n\nNow, let's get into the heart of today’s theme. Did you know:\n\nDid you know that 90% of homebuyers start their search online, but only 52% end up buying the home they found online?\n\nDid you know that buyers who use a real estate agent often see a 10-15% better deal than those who don't?\n\nDid you know that first-time homebuyers represent nearly 33% of all home purchases, yet many of them feel overwhelmed by the process?\n\nThese are just a few of the alarming statistics about the current market. It is important to be aware of the challenges that you may face so that you can plan accordingly. Homeownership plays a critical role in Americans' lives, and many face challenges due to not owning, poor credit scores, debt burdens, and vulnerabilities.\n\nIn today’s highlighted Tools and Techniques, let’s dive into the practical part. Yesterday, I gave you 10 reasons why Real Estate Success: Step 4 is to Find the Right Agent in The Step-by-Step Guide to Buying Real Estate. Now, let’s break them down into 10 ways how to achieve this:\n\n1. Ask for Referrals\n\nStart by asking friends, family, and colleagues for recommendations. Personal referrals often lead to trustworthy agents who have provided satisfactory service to people you know. When you receive a referral, ask your contact about their experience and why they recommend that particular agent. This personal insight can help you gauge if the agent is a good fit for you.\n\n2. Research Online\n\nUtilize online platforms to search for agents in your area. Websites like realtor.com and zillow.com allow you to view agents' profiles, sales history, and customer reviews, helping you gauge their expertise and reputation. Take the time to read through reviews and look at their recent sales to see if their experience aligns with your needs.\n\n3. Attend Open Houses\n\nVisit open houses in your neighborhood. This gives you the chance to meet agents in a casual setting and see how they interact with potential buyers. Pay attention to how the agent presents the property and engages with visitors. This firsthand observation can help you determine their professionalism and approachability.\n\n4. Check Local Listings\n\nLook for agents with the most listings in your area. An agent with a high volume of sales often indicates experience and a strong presence in the market. Review their listings to see if they frequently work with properties similar to what you are looking for, which can be a sign they understand your market segment well.\n\n5. Contact Real Estate Brokerage Firms\n\nReach out to local real estate offices or national brokerage firms. They can connect you with agents who specialize in your desired area or type of property. These firms often have a selection of agents with varying expertise and can match you with someone who meets your specific needs.\n\n6. Utilize the National Association of Realtors (NAR)\n\nUse the NAR's \"Find a Realtor\" tool to locate licensed agents in your area. This ensures that the agents you consider are members of a recognized professional organization. Membership in NAR often indicates a commitment to ethical standards and ongoing education in real estate.\n\n7. Look for Community Involvement\n\nSeek agents who are active in your community. Those who participate in local events or charities often have a deeper understanding of the area and its market dynamics. Community-involved agents may also have a stronger local network, which can be beneficial during your home search.\n\n8. Evaluate Their Experience and Credentials\n\nCheck the agent’s background, including years of experience, certifications, and any specialized training. This can provide insight into their expertise and ability to handle your specific needs. Look for agents who have credentials such as Certified Residential Specialist (CRS) or Accredited Buyer’s Representative (ABR).\n\n9. Use a Relocation Specialist\n\nIf moving to a new area, consider contacting a relocation specialist who can connect you with top agents in that location, ensuring they understand the local market and your requirements. Relocation specialists are familiar with the challenges of moving to a new city and can provide valuable support throughout the process.\n\n10. Check Online Reviews and Ratings\n\nLook at online reviews on platforms like Google or Yelp. This feedback can offer valuable insights into an agent's performance, communication style, and client satisfaction. Consistent positive reviews are a good indicator of an agent’s reliability and customer service.\n\nToday’s Show is Brought to You By: TimeToFixMyCredit.com.
