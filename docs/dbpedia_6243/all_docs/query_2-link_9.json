Yesterday he joined Larry Gifford's Radio Stuff podcast to further explain and defend his comments.\n\nAfter devoting a good portion of the interview touting his background and expertise in music scheduling, Hill reiterated his now famous salad analogy saying he's been using this comparison for over 20 years. \"if playing 80% of females got me the highest ratings, I’d run over you in a hallway to put a female record on the air .. I would walk over broken glass and chew razor blades to get to the studio and deliver what the audience will line up for.” He repeated his claim of receiving death threats from country fans and, with regard to blowback from female country artists, he said he'd like to sit down and listen to Martina McBride about her concerns of what he said.\n\nMartina has yet to reply to the offer, but both her and Sara Evans continued with their own comments with Evans posting: 'Cheers to my fellow \"tomatoes' and Martina adding 'Proud Tomato' tweet.
