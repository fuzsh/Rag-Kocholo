        "text": "There are some folk in Formula 1 who sneer at soccer. I am not a great fan myself, I have to admit, but I do recognise that it is what the Americans call “the elephant in the room” when it comes to global sport, particularly in Europe and Asia. F1 people think that our sport is as big and as significant as soccer and that is a very big mistake. During the Canadian GP weekend, there were lots of people glued to TV screens watching matches that were part of the UEFA European Football Championship, commonly referred to as Euro 2012. I am a great believer that cultural and sporting events are good to stop nations attacking one another. George Orwell said that sport was “war, minus the shooting” and I think that is a very astute comment. Two nations send their best men to kick a ball around for a while and no-one gets hurt. National pride is either boosted or battered and perhaps on occasion a few fans have got out of control and punched one another, but it is not like going to war. A lighter version of the same thing is the Eurovision Song Contest, or even Miss World Beauty Pageants where one can cheer for Victorias rather than Davids…\n\nAnyway, the key point I am trying to make is not that F1 was watching Euro 2012, but rather a question: Was Euro 2012 watching F1? You see, there is a strange belief in F1 circles that the sport is just the same as soccer and that it can compete for the same sponsorship dollars. This is not true. This is the basis of the deal that Sauber recently did with Chelsea. The thought process behind that deal was not about some Russian bloke buying an F1 team, but rather that it gave Sauber the chance to share sponsorship dollars with Chelsea and thus offer the sponsors a better deal. There are lots of B2B stuff that one can dream up, plus some exposure for Chelsea in markets were F1 is bigger than the Premier League, but fundamentally the deal is about jumping on the soccer bandwagon…\n\nThe bottom line, in my opinion, is that Formula 1 gets sponsors because of the TV eyeballs it gathers, not because it is by nature a popular sport. There are, of course, a lot of casual viewers who watch it because it is on TV and they can get excited if the racing is good, but only a small percentage are passionate about it, whereas a lot of people are passionate about football, if only because “the beautiful game” is accessible to all. You don’t need a rich daddy to become a soccer star, you just need to be good at it. Being good at motor racing is no guarantee of a stellar career.\n\nThus I am in the camp that believe that switching F1 to pay-per-view is the fastest way to wipe it out. Without the large TV audiences, the sponsors will not be bothered. One can argue that the teams will not be affected because if they get the big TV bucks, they do not need sponsorships, but they do not seem to understand that even if they get 85 percent of the money (which the Formula One group is not going to give them without a fight) the pay-TV dollars are basically dependent on whether or not the sport attracts new subscribers for the TV stations. They are not doing it for charity. And I don’t think that will happen in big enough numbers because F1 is not soccer. One cannot look at the big soccer deals and say “It will be like that”. Hiding the sport behind a pay-wall will stifle it.\n\nAs the F1 TV numbers being seen in Britain now show, the answer is not Mr Murdoch. The best answer is to have free-to-air TV, lots of eyeballs, lots of sponsors and a little less greed from the financial muppets who take the cash and give nothing back.\n\nThe skill of being a good promoter is to promote and bring in bigger numbers of people. It is not just about take, take, take. When you get it right, you can enjoy the fruits of your labours, but taking money and not doing any promotion is the work of people who do not care whether they kill the sport or not.\n\nAnd that is why these people should be encouraged to change their ways…"
