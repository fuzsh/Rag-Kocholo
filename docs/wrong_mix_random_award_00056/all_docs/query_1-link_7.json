        "text": "For more than 50 years, CSPP has responded to this demand by transforming students into working professionals in areas such as general psychology, organizational psychology, educational psychology, counseling psychology, and more. Graduates from our psychology school are now making a difference in people's lives through their professions as:\n\nClinical psychologists\n\nMarriage and family therapists\n\nClinical counselors\n\nOrganizational psychologists\n\nOrganizational behavior psychologists\n\nOrganizational development psychologists\n\nSocial Work\n\nPsychopharmacologists\n\nWhether you’re looking for on-campus or online school psychology programs, our undergraduate and graduate degree programs are the perfect place to start. As one of the leading California colleges in psychology, our experienced faculty members help each of our students gain valuable problem-solving skills and hands-on experience that can set them up for success in a career in the field of professional psychology.\n\nPsychology Degree Programs Offered at CSPP\n\nA psychology school is only as good as the student it trains. Founded in 1969, the California School of Professional Psychology (CSPP) has educated over 16,000 psychology students as one of the nation’s first free-standing schools of professional psychology.\n\nToday, our in-person and online psychology school in California continues its commitment to preparing the next generation of mental health professionals and advocates. Our dedication to ensuring every community’s access to quality mental health care extends from integrated care to inclusive family therapy, and our psychology students and alumni begin making an impact in the communities they serve from the moment they set foot in our classrooms.\n\nThe CSPP is one of the top psychology schools in California and understands the need for flexibility with today’s student needs. This is why we offer online programs, as well as hybrid programs that blend online and campus-based learning.\n\nWelcome to the California School of Professional Psychology (CSPP) at Alliant International University!\n\nI was drawn to psychology because of my interest in adolescent mental health and substance use disorder, and I wanted to find a way to help. As well as being dean, I’m a professor and a clinical researcher, working towards a goal of improving community mental health and eliminating racial disparity and inequity.\n\nWhen you join us at CSPP, you join the ranks of the many California mental health professionals who have graduated from Alliant. Our training is grounded in academic rigor with a focus on serving marginalized and underserved communities.\n\nAt CSPP you’ll dig deep into the specialty of your choice, with faculty who share your interests and the mission to prepare you to work in the field. Our campuses can be found across the state, each with its own focus, but all interconnected. We have a broad network of partners and associates, and each campus has a professional training office ready to tap into that network to assist in your internship placement.\n\nOur faculty is varied and diverse in both culture and experience, and eager to guide you through the program, sharing their clinical and research expertise with you.\n\nIf you have a heart of service and a genuine desire to help others, you will find a home here at CSPP.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDavid Stewart, PhD\n\nDean, California School of Professional Psychology\n\nCSPP is the home of several interdisciplinary research institutes, each of which is focused on an area of urgent importance. Students have the opportunity to participate in the activities of these institutes and, through them, to work with faculty from across the Alliant community.\n\nYou can search the topics of CSPP graduate research from the Alliant library page. Some students work on their doctoral research in research clusters with faculty when getting their degree; others choose to explore an area of their own interest, often related to an academic emphasis.\n\nAlliant faculty members are also actively involved in research in their fields. Explore CSPP faculty backgrounds for their areas of research interest as well as their publications."
