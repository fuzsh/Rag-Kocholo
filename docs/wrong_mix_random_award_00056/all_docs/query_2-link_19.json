Please download .pdf of publications from sidebar at: https://www.cbs.umn.edu/explore/departments/mpgi/faculty\n\nProgress 01/01/12 to 12/31/12\n\nOutputs\n\nOUTPUTS: The Microbial and Plant Genomics Institute (MPGI) membership consists of 67 faculty from 4 colleges: The College of Food, Agriculture and Natural Resource Sciences, The College of Biological Sciences, the Academic Health Center and the College of Science and Engineering. MPGI travel awards enabled 32 graduate students and 12 postdoctoral researchers from 26 university-wide labs to attend meetings to present their research and interact with scientists. MPGI coordinated and sponsored a Fall Symposium on the topic of \"Systems Biology of Genetic Regulation \" hosted by faculty members Chad Myers and Fumiaki Katagiri. The series also served as a one-credit course (PBI05960-002) for 9 students. Each visiting scientist chose a paper for students to read and critique. Students attended the Symposium and a day-long workshop on experimental designs using genomics to study for variation. Science on the Spot is a monthly gathering that has allowed MPGI faculty and members of their lab to present and discuss information on their current research in a social and relaxed environment. These gatherings have expanded opportunities for interdisciplinary connections with other University researchers. PARTICIPANTS: Members of the MPGI are faculty who are interested in the successful development and application of genomics and the resulting societal and environmental impact. The 67 members of MPGI are faculty from departments throughout four colleges at the University of Minnesota: The College of Food, Agricultural, and Natural Resource Sciences (CFANS), the College of Biological Sciences (CBS), the Institute of Technology (IT), and the Academic Health Center (AHC). MPGI directly supports the salary of faculty member M. David Marks, a functional genomics researcher in plant biology, plus support staff member Kit Leffler who is responsible for management and administration of the MPGI seminar series, the MPGI website and other administrative functions. MPGI has provided training and professional development for 32 graduate students and 12 postdoctoral researchers by supporting either their attendance at meetings to present research findings, or their travel to other educational institutions for training purposes. TARGET AUDIENCES: Within the University community, the Institute facilitates crosscutting communications among faculty engaged in diverse areas of genomics research. With the sponsorship of retreats and seminar series, MPGI supports the dissemination of scientific knowledge among faculty, students, and staff. Building public awareness about genomics and its applications in a social and ethical context is one of MPGI's outreach functions via its website (www.mpgi.umn.edu) and the seminar series sponsored by the Institute. In addition, a major goal of MPGI is training outstanding students and postdoctoral researchers in this important biological field by providing them with travel awards. These are among the activities designed to bring benefits from genomics to Minnesotans, the nation, and the world.

MPGI travel awards enabled 31 graduate students and 12 postdoctoral researchers from 33 university-wide labs to attend meetings to present their research and interact with scientists.MPGI coordinated and sponsored a Fall Symposium on the topic of \"Beyond the Reference: Population Genomics\" hosted by faculty members Nathan Springer and Peter Tiffin. The series also served as a one-credit course (PBIO5960-002) for 9 students. Each visiting scientist chose a paper for students to read and critique. Students attended the Symposium and a day-long workshop on experimental designs using genomics to study for variation. The Distinguished Scientist Lectureship Series features research by prominent scientists, particularly in the field of microbial and plant sciences. These lecturers are invited to campus to give seminars, discuss research, and interact with students, faculty, and the public. Science on the Spot is a bi-annual gathering that has allowed MPGI faculty and members of their lab to present and discuss information on their current research in a social and relaxed environment. These gatherings have expanded opportunities for interdisciplinary connections with other University researchers. MPGI has also begun to hold a faculty member lunch every other Wednesday, from Noon to 1 pm at the St. Paul student center. Faculty members are encouraged to bring a lunch and discuss science in an informal setting. PARTICIPANTS: Members of the MPGI are faculty who are interested in the successful development and application of genomics and the resulting societal and environmental impact. The 67 members of MPGI are faculty from departments throughout four colleges at the University of Minnesota: The College of Food, Agricultural, and Natural Resource Sciences (CFANS), the College of Biological Sciences (CBS), the Institute of Technology (IT), and the Academic Health Center (AHC). MPGI directly supports the salary of faculty member M. David Marks, a functional genomics researcher in plant biology, plus support staff member Sandesh Nicol who is responsible for management and administration of the MPGI seminar series, the MPGI website and other administrative functions. MPGI has provided training and professional development for 31 graduate students and 12 postdoctoral researchers by supporting either their attendance at meetings to present research findings, or their travel to other educational institutions for training purposes. TARGET AUDIENCES: Within the University community, the Institute facilitates crosscutting communications among faculty engaged in diverse areas of genomics research. With the sponsorship of retreats and seminar series, MPGI supports the dissemination of scientific knowledge among faculty, students, and staff. Building public awareness about genomics and its applications in a social and ethical context is one of MPGI's outreach functions via its website (www.mpgi.umn.edu) and the seminar series sponsored by the Institute. In addition, a major goal of MPGI is training outstanding students and postdoctoral researchers in this important biological field by providing them with travel awards. These are among the activities designed to bring benefits from genomics to Minnesotans, the nation, and the world. PROJECT MODIFICATIONS: Nothing significant to report during this reporting period.\n\nImpacts\n\nThe Microbial and Plant Genomics Institute (MPGI) promotes advances in microbial and plant genomics, genomics-enabled sciences, and molecular genetics. The Institute strives through research, educational, and outreach activities to foster a multi-disciplinary interchange of ideas and applications of cutting-edge technologies to research. Institute activities contribute to basic science and the translation of genomics for applications to the environment, agriculture, and human health. The scientific aim of the Institute is to enhance the development of functional and translational genomics concomitantly with the expansion of bioinformatics capabilities and the development of specialized instrumentation. Within the University community, the Institute facilitates interactions among faculty engaged in diverse areas of genomics research by promoting understanding of microbial and plant genomics, and providing access to genomics-related technologies. Cooperation among MPGI members helps to assure a strong basis for education in the disciplines of the basic agricultural, environmental, and health sciences. The Institute enhances faculty projects by supporting the educational activities of individual grad students and postdoctoral researchers. Building public awareness about genomics and its applications in a social and ethical context is one of MPGI's outreach functions. In addition, assisting in the training of outstanding students in this important biological field is a major goal.\n\nPublications\n\nNing, Xia and Karypis, George. 2011.
