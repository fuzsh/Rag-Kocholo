In 2008, it was rated as the characteristic specialty construction point of Beijing. In 2010, it was approved as the first-level discipline master's program of Control Science and Engineering. Since 2012, it has participated in the National Special Needs Doctoral Talents Training Program of \"Theory and Technology of Architectural Heritage Preservation\". In 2020, Automation major has been rated as the first-class major construction point in Beijing.\n\nIn the future, Department of Automation will stick to the excellent spirits of BUCEA and adhere to fine traditions of its predecessors. Regarding discipline construction and development as principal line, the school will stick to the educational ideas of cultivating broad caliber inter-disciplinary talents with thick foundation, thus performing its own responsibility, and contributing its share to the country and social service with the joint efforts of teachers and students.\n\nWith the development of BUCEA, Department of Automation enjoys a high reputation in the fields of control, system engineering, pattern identification and system intelligence at home. Its scientific research mainly involves following fields, such as complex system control theories, decision-making analysis and decision support, intelligent control and robots, integrated control of computers and network technology, information detection and identification, artificial intelligent and so on. In recent ten years, the Department has undertaken and accomplished more than 30 scientific research projects of the nation and companies, with scientific research funds constantly increasing. It also has obtained dozens of national patent for invention.\n\nElectrical Engineering and Automation\n\nThe major of Electrical Engineering and Automation has a team of 9 professional teachers. Most teachers have doctoral degrees and come from famous universities, Including six associate professors and three lecturers. The knowledge and age structure of the teaching team is reasonable. Ma Hongyan was awarded the title of Distinguished Teacher of BUCEA.\n\nTeachers have high scientific research ability in this major. In recent years, they have presided over and participated in several projects, such as the National Natural Science Foundation of China, the Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality, the Plan Project of Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission, and the General Project of Beijing Municipal Education Commission, Gained remarkable scientific research achievements.\n\nâAutomatic Control Principleâ is State-level excellent course in Department of Electrical Engineering. There are several Beijing and university-level excellent courses, Gained national awards for âNational Electronic Design Competitionâ and âChallenge Cup Competitionâ many times, teaching achievements are very good.\n\nComputer Science and Technology\n\nThe major of computer science and technology was established in 1999. There are 24 full-time teachers, 19 of whom have senior titles, and 70% have doctor's degree. There are 377 students, including 327 undergraduates and 50 postgraduates. The major has successively carried out the \"major enrollment\", \"double training plan\" and \"external training plan\" in 2015, as well as the \"artificial intelligence (AI) experimental class\" enrollment reform in 2018, cultivating many outstanding graduates. In 2016, the major has made outstanding achievements in the evaluation of undergraduate computer science and technology in Beijing municipal colleges and universities, and won the first place in the evaluation of specialty characteristics in Beijing municipal colleges and universities. In 2019, it was approved to be the first-class major construction in Beijing municipal level.\n\nThe major has presided over more than 10 key projects, general projects, and youth projects of the National Natural Science Foundation of China. It has won the Second Prize of National Science and Technology Progress Award, the Second Prize of Natural Science of the Ministry of Education, and the Second Prize of Wu Wenjun Artificial Intelligence Natural Science Award, etc.\n\nThe major has undertaken several national, provincial and university level teaching and research projects, and has been approved by many Beijing Outstanding Teaching Team, High-level Innovation Team and Beijing Teaching Achievement Awards.\n\nBuilding Electrical and Intelligent\n\nThe Department of Building Electricity and Intelligence has 9 full-time teachers, including 2 professors, 2 associate professors, 5 lecturers and the proportion of doctoral degree is 100%. The department is mainly responsible for teaching the undergraduate courses of this major and the platform courses of the whole university. In addition, the department also undertakes the task of training master's degree in control science and engineering and mechanical disciplines.\n\nIn recent years, teachers of the Department of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering have presided over and completed several vertical and horizontal research projects, such as sub-projects of the National Key Research and Development Program, national funds, and municipal funds, etc. They have also presided over or participated in the formulation (revision) of 6 national and local standards, won the Second Prize of Beijing Science and Technology Progress, published more than 140 papers, published more than 10 monographs and textbooks, and obtained more than 20 patents.\n\nThe teachers of the Department of Building and Electricity are actively involved in teaching reform and research, and have won the First Prize of Beijing Teaching Achievement, the Second Prize of the University Teaching Excellence Award, the Second Prize, and the Third Prize of the University Basic Teaching Skills Competition, etc. They have guided students to participate in the joint graduation design of building electrical and intelligent schools, the Building Information Modeling (BIM) Application Skills Competition and the National Student Intelligent Building Engineering Practical Skills Competition, and have won many awards.\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nThe major of artificial intelligence is oriented to the national major strategic development and the needs of smart city construction.
