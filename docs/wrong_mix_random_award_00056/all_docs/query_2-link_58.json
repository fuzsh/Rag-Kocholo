        "text": "M2. Elevations of Brain Kynurenic Acid in Prenatal Rats Result in Long-lasting Impairments in Cortical Development and Cognitive Flexibility: Implications for Schizophrenia\n\nJohn P. Bruno*, Sarah Vunck, Michelle Pershing, Ana Pocivavsek, Dave Bortz, Christinna Jorgensen, Peter Fredericks, Benedetta Leuner, Robert Schwarcz\n\nThe Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio\n\nBackground: Schizophrenia (SZ) is a debilitating psychiatric disorder that presents with cognitive deficits in thought processing, attention and working memory. Though cognitive deficits are considered core symptoms and are predictive of functional outcome, they remain largely unresolved by current drug and behavioral interventions. Thus, continued study of validated animal models may provide a platform for revealing more efficacious cognition-enhancing medications. Elevated kynurenic acid (KYNA) levels in the brain of patients with SZ may contribute to these cognitive impairments through KYNA's negative allosteric modulation of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (α7*nAChRs) and subsequent reductions in extracellular cortical ACh and glutamate levels. This hypothesis has prompted the use of experimental elevations in brain KYNA, at different stages of the life span, as a model of SZ. We have reported that administration of KYNA's bioprecursor (kynurenine) from gestational day (GD) 15 through weaning produces deficits in hippocampal- and prefrontal-mediated tasks when offspring are tested as adults. In the present experiments, we further delineated the sensitive period by elevating brain KYNA in fetuses during the last prenatal week (GD15-22). Given the role of α7nAChR activity in the development of excitatory synapses and ultimately in the mediation of cognitive flexibility via prefrontal cholinergic and glutamatergic transmission, we determined the impact of prenatal elevations of KYNA on several indices of cortical excitability, including the density of dendritic spines on cortical pyramidal neurons (layers II/III), the expression of mGluR2 mRNA, and evoked glutamate release in prefrontal cortex (PFC).\n\nMethods: Subjects: KYNA levels wereelevated chronically from GD 15 through GD22, by adding KYNA precursorkynurenine (100 mg/day) daily to reconstituted powdered rat chow fed topregnant Wistar rats (EKyn). In thecontrol condition, mothers were fed unadulterated reconstituted powdered ratchow (ECon) for the same time period. Post parturition, dry rat chow pellets were fed to dams and offspringuntil the latter were tested for neurochemical or behavioral outcomes beginningat PD56. KYNA levels: Serumlevels of kynurenine were measured in litter-matched maternal and pup samples fromGD21 (EKyn=9 pups, from 3 litters: ECon=12 pups, 4 litters) and PD2 (EKyn=12pups, 4 litters: ECon=18 pups, 6 litters), as well as adult offspring on dayPD56 (EKyn=5 rats, 3 litters: ECon=5 rats, 3 litters). To determine brain KYNA levels at those sametime points, forebrain or PFC tissue homogenates were analyzed from those sameanimals. Cortical excitability: Densities of apical and basal dendritic spines (expressedas spines per 10 μm) werecalculated using Golgi-impregnated pyramidal neurons from the prelimbic/infralimbiccortex (layer II/III; EKyn=6 pups, 4 litters; ECon=7 pups, 4 litters). 4–5 neurons per animal, and 3–5 segments per neuron were analyzed. RTqPCR: Expressionlevels of mGluR2 mRNA were determined in brain homogenates at GD21 (EKyn=6pups, 3 litters: ECon=8 pups, 4 litters), PD2 (EKyn=8 pups, 6 litters: ECon=12pups, 6 litters), and PD56 (EKyn=4 rats, 2 litters: ECon=3 rats, 1 litter). Evokedglutamate release: The mesolimbic stimulation of prefrontal glutamatewas quantified using a glutamate-sensitive amperometric microelectrode arrayfollowing intra-nucleus accumbens infusions of NMDA (0.05–0.30 μg/0.5μL)(EKyn=5 pups, 4 litters; ECon=7 pups, 5 litters). Set Shifting Behavior: Cognitiveflexibility was assessed between PD56-80 using an attentional set-shifting task(ASST) (EKyn=8 pups, 5 litters; ECon=7 pups, 4 litters).\n\nResults: KYNA levels: Compared to controls, serum kynurenine was increased in EKyn dams and offspring on GD21 (dams=2223%, fetuses=692%) but not on PD2. EKyn rats had elevated brain KYNA levels, relative to ECon, on GD21 (400%) and PD56 (150%). Cortical excitability: Relative to ECon, EKyn rats showed reductions in apical (by 11%) and basal (by 14%) dendritic spine density of pyramidal neurons in layer II/III of the prelimbic/infralimbic cortex as well as reduced expression of mRNA for mGluR2 in frontal cortex at GD21 (by 28%) and PD56 (by 27%). Evoked glutamate release: The mesolimbic activation of prefrontal glutamate release following intra-accumbens infusion of NMDA seen in ECon rats (3.58±0.40 μM increase after 0.15 μg NMDA) was nearly eliminated (0.43±0.22 μM) in Ekyn rats. Set Shifting Behavior: In adulthood, EKyn rats exhibited deficits in the ASST at the first reversal (twice as many trials to criteria) and extra-dimensional shift (58% more trials to criteria) stages.\n\nConclusions: Consistent with the role of α7nAChRs on neuronal development, prenatal elevation of the negative modulator KYNA in the last week of gestation produces long lasting neuronal changes that are associated with deficits in cortical excitability and cognition as adults. These changes include reductions in spine density, expression of mGluR2 mRNA, evoked glutamate release in PFC, and also reduced cognitive flexibility. As each of these changes has been described as part of the pathology accompanying SZ, these results further validate prenatally elevated KYNA levels as a valuable animal model of the disease.\n\nKeywords: kynurenic acid, development, glutamate, cognition, schizophrenia\n\nDisclosures: J.

Evidence for Both an Alpha7 Nicotinic and a Glycine B Receptor Mediation of Working Memory in the Rat\n\nSarah Vunck*, Michelle Pershing, Dave Bortz, Christinna Jorgensen, Robert Schwarcz, John P. Bruno\n\nThe Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio\n\nBackground: Cognitive deficits (attention, working memory, and cognitive flexibility) are considered a core symptom cluster in schizophrenia (SZ); predictive of functional outcome yet not alleviated by current drug and behavioral interventions. Thus, there is a need for further studies on animal models to reveal more efficacious pharmacotherapies. A significant contributor to cognitive impairments seen in SZ may be the elevated levels of kynurenic acid (KYNA), observed in the brains of patients with SZ. KYNA is an endogenous, astrocyte-derived metabolite that negatively modulates α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (α7nAChRs) at physiological concentrations and, at higher concentrations, blocks the glycineB site of the NMDA receptor. We have reported that acute administration of KYNA's bioprecursor L-kynurenine (KYN; 100 mg/kg) in intact adult rats increases extracellular KYNA (∼1,500%), decreases extracellular glutamate (GLU) levels (∼30%) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), and behaviorally results in an impairment of the prefrontally-mediated attentional set shifting task. We investigated three issues: (1) whether the impairing effects of acute KYNA elevations can be generalized to another PFC-mediated task, the Delay Non-Match to Position (DNMTP) working memory task; (2) whether KYNA-induced working memory deficits would be alleviated by the administration of the α7nAChR-positive modulator galantamine (GAL). Our previous results indicated that KYN's reduction of GLU release is restored to basal levels following administration of GAL, and that GAL normalizes performance in a set shifting task in a different KYNA-based animal model of SZ; and (3) the relative roles of α7nAChRs vs NMDA receptors in performance in the DNMTP task.To this end, we determined, in a separate group of intact animals, the effects of an acute administration of 4-chlorokynurenine (4-ClKYN), a bioprecursor of the selective glycineB antagonist 7-chlorokynurenic acid (7-ClKYNA),. We predicted working memory deficits following 4-ClKYN but, in contrast to the effects of KYN, we expected no restoration of performance following co-administration of GAL.\n\nMethods: Acquisition training in the Delayed Non-Match to Position (DNMTP) task began, in 2 groups of adult male Wistar rats, at postnatal day (PD) 56. After acquisition and baseline performance was established at each of the 3 delay periods (5, 10, and 15 s), rats received a series of drug challenges. Rats in the first group (N=8) received an acute injection (i.p.) of 0 (vehicle), 25 or 100 mg/kg KYN (dose order randomized) 50 min prior to the session, with a minimum of 48 h between test days to assure complete return to basal performance levels. After completing the KYN dose response curve, animals were tested again 50 min following injection of KYN (100 mg/kg) + GAL (3 mg/kg). Following the same protocol, a second group of rats (N=8) received 0 (vehicle), 25 or 100 mg/kg 4-ClKYN, or 4-ClKYN (100 mg/kg) + GAL (3 mg/kg).\n\nResults: In both groups of rats, performance under the control condition was delay-dependent. In the KYN-treated group, accuracy was 95, 87, and 82% at 5, 10, and 15 s, respectively. Elevation of KYNA via acute administration of KYN resulted in significant deficits in performance and, as expected, the detrimental effects were largest for the higher dose and longest delays. Compared to vehicle treatment, 25 mg/kg KYN significantly reduced accuracy (by 12%) only at the longest delay (15 s), while 100 mg/kg significantly reduced accuracy at 5 s (by 11%), 10 s (by 14%), and during the 15 s delay (by 33%; dropping to chance levels). Compared to vehicle, acute KYN (both 25 and 100 mg/kg) produced a four-fold increase (from ∼9 to ∼40) in sample phase omissions during the first 15 min of the task. The detrimental effects of 4-ClKYN were more severe than those caused by KYN. Vehicle treatment accuracy was 96%, 87%, and 77% at 5, 10, and 15 s. 25 mg/kg 4-ClKYN reduced accuracy (by 33%) at the 15 s delay, while 100 mg/kg 4-ClKYN significantly reduced accuracy overall (by 60%) as well as at all delays, well below chance performance, 5 s (by 54%), 10 s (by 60%), and 15 s delays (by 70%). There was no significant increase in omissions following acute administration of 4-ClKYN. Notably, the deficits following acute administration of 100 mg/kg KYN were fully prevented by co-administration of GAL. In contrast, the deficits following 100 mg/kg 4-ClKYNA were unaffected by treatment with GAL.\n\nConclusions: Collectively, these findings suggest a role for both α7nAChRs and NMDA receptors in the mediation of working memory. Acute elevation of KYNA in adult rats results in significantly reduced, delay-dependent performance in the DNMTP task. This deficit appears to result from KYNA's negative allosteric modulation of α7nAChRs, as performance accuracy was normalized by GAL. Acute elevation of the glycineB antagonist 7-ClKYNA resulted in even more severe deficits in performance, and these impairments were not reversed by co-administration of GAL. Considering evidence for impairments in both nicotinic and glutamatergic transmission in SZ, these data in animals provide support for the continued focus on the α7nAChR and NMDA receptor as targets for cognition enhancement in SZ.\n\nKeywords: kynurenic acid, development, glutamate, cognition, schizophrenia\n\nDisclosures: S.

Attenuation of Metabolic Consequences from Atypical Antipsychotic Use in Schizophrenia: Folate Supplementation and the Role of Pharmacogenomics\n\nVicki Ellingrod*, Tyler Grove, Stephan F. Taylor, Kyle Burghardt\n\nUniversity of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan\n\nBackground: Metabolic syndrome may be related to dietary folate, its pharmacogenetically regulated metabolism, and atypical antipsychotic (AAP) exposure. We examined how folate supplementation would affect metabolic measures and endothelial functioning (RHI) in AAP treated schizophrenia subjects meeting NCEP-ATP-III metabolic syndrome criteria.\n\nMethods: Subjects were given 5 mg/day open label folate for 3 months. Baseline and 3 month measurements included RHI, BMI, fasting metabolic laboratory measures, C-reactive protein, homocysteine, IL-6, and leptin. DNA was gentoyped for the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 677C/T and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) 158 Val/Met variants.\n\nResults: Thirty-five subjects with a mean age of 50±9 years and 70% Caucasian. After 3 months supplementation, RHI improved by 20% (p=0.02), mean homocysteine decreased 14% (p=0.006), and IL-6 decreased 13% (p=0.09). Subjects exercised 15% less during the study (p=0.05). At baseline 61% met endothelial dysfunction criteria (RHI<1.67), which decreased to 27% (p=0.0006) at endpoint. The MTHFR 677C/C+COMT 158Met/Met subjects had a 44% RHI improvement versus 10% improvement for MTHFR 677T/COMT Val allele carriers (p=0.06). The MTHFR 677C/C+COMT 158Met/Met group also showed significant reduction in those meeting endothelial dysfunction (83% baseline and 16% endpoint), compared to the MTHFR T+COMT Val allele carriers (54% baseline and 31% endpoint[p=0.001]).\n\nConclusions: Folate may reduce AAP-associated metabolic risks and we report significant reductions in the number of subjects meeting endothelial dysfunction. This is remarkable given that ALL subjects met metabolic syndrome criteria. This may prove as a useful avenue to reducing CVD risk. Those with the MTHFR T or COMT Met alleles may not benefit from folate, but this needs further follow up.\n\nKeywords: folate, MTHFR, schizophrenia, metabolic syndrome\n\nDisclosures: V.

Weight Gain Independent, Centrally-mediated Effects of Olanzapine on Glucose Metabolism\n\nMargaret Hahn*, Araba Chintoh, Gary Remington, Celine Teo, Steve W. Mann, Paul Fletcher, Jose Nobrega, Adria Giacca\n\nCenter for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, Ontario, Canada\n\nBackground: The atypical antipsychotics (AAPs) have been associated with an increased risk of metabolic abnormalities. However, the mechanism of antipsychotic-induced metabolic side effects, in particular glucose dysregulation remains unclear. In this regard, evidence from preclinical models supports pronounced effects on insulin sensitivity and secretion occurring independently of adiposity, following acute dosing of specific AAP agents. However, this model of systemic drug administration is unable to differentiate peripheral from central effects on glucose homeostasis. Given evidence suggesting a critical role for the hypothalamus in direct control of energy and glucose metabolism, we set out to clarify central mechanisms of olanzapine (OLA)-induced glucose dysregulation.\n\nMethods: Healthy Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with a single 75 μg intracerebroventricular (ICV) dose of OLA or vehicle, and tested using hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic and hyperglycemic clamp procedures which are considered the gold-standard to assess insulin sensitivity and pancreatic β-cell response, respectively. Dosing of OLA was established based on inhibition of amphetamine-induced locomotion, a validated model of antipsychotic efficacy. Data was analyzed using mixed-models repeated-measures analyses, with significance accepted at p<0.05.\n\nResults: Analogous to our previous findings demonstrating that a single peripheral dose of clozapine and OLA is able to induce a deficit in β-cell function, a single ICV dose of OLA followed by the hyperglycemic clamp procedure resulted in decreased insulin (p=0.0041) and c-peptide response (p=0.0039) to glucose challenge as compared to vehicle-treated animals. This was also mirrored by a significant decrease in the steady-state glucose infusion rate required to maintain hyperglycemia (p=0.002). In contrast to the single dosing peripheral paradigm, there was no effect of ICV OLA on insulin sensitivity, with tracer studies failing to show an effect on hepatic glucose production or peripheral glucose uptake.\n\nConclusions: We show that a single centrally administered dose of OLA impairs β-cell secretory function, suggesting that the central nervous system may be an important site in mediating drug-related effects on insulin response. The lack of a central OLA effect on insulin sensitivity might suggest that peripheral mechanisms play a more prominent role in the perturbations seen with systemic administration, likely through direct effects on tissues implicated in glucose metabolism.\n\nKeywords: atypical antipsychotics, intracerebroventricular, glucose dysregulation, diabetes\n\nDisclosures: M.

Disturbances of Tryptophan Metabolism and Risk of Depression in Hcv Patients Treated with Ifn-Alpha\n\nGregory F. Oxenkrug*, Waldemar Turski, Wojciech Zgrajka, Joel Weinstock, Paul Summergrad\n\nTufts University School of Medicine, Newton, Massachusetts\n\nBackground: Serotonin deficiency is associated with majordepressive disorder. It was suggested that serotonin deficiency is caused bythe shunt of tryptophan (TRP) metabolism from biosynthesis of serotonin toformation of kynurenine (KYN). The rate-limiting enzyme of TRP—KYNmetabolism, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), is transcriptionally induced bypro-inflammatory factors, e.g., interferon-gamma (IFNG). IFNG production is encodedby polymorphic IFNG (+874) T/A. We reported that presence of high producerallele (T) of this gene increased the risk of depression as a side-effect ofIFN-alpha treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients. Therefore, we expectedpositive correlation between activity of IDO (and TRP—KYN metabolism) andrisk of depression in HCV patients treated with IFN-alpha. Our aim was evaluation of serum levels of TRP, KYN and KYN derivative, kynurenic acid (KYNA) in HCV patients who developed and who did notdevelop depression during IFN-alpha treatment.\n\nMethods: Kynurenines were detected by HPLC-fluorometricmethod in serum samples of 80 HCV patients awaiting treatment. Depression wasassessed by SCID-IV. Study was approved by Tufts Medical Center IRB.\n\nResults: There was no difference in KYN, KYNA levels and KYN/TRPratio (KTR) between patients who developed (n=43) and who did not develop (n=37)depression during IFN-alpha treatment. TRP concentrations were higher inpatients who developed depression (p<0.05, Kruscal-Wallis test). Odds ofdevelopment of depression increased as TRP levels elevated from 33% (TRP levels<12000 pmol/ml) to 68% (TRP levels > 16000 pmol/ml, p<0.05).\n\nConclusions: Obtained data did not confirm our working hypothesis of up-regulation of TRP—KYN metabolism as a risk factor for depression in HCV patients treated with IFN-alpha. The unexpected finding of association of elevated serum TRP concentrations with the risk of depression (without changes of TRP—KYN metabolism) suggest the deficiency of conversion of TRP into serotonin as depression risk factor in HCV. Polymorphism of the rate limiting enzyme of TRP—serotonin pathway, tryptophan hydroxylase (Tph), is associated with depression in animal and human studies. Our data warrant the further studies of Tph polymorphism as a risk factor for depression associated with IFN-alpha treatment of HCV patients.\n\nKeywords: tryptophan, kynurenine, depression, interferons, hepatitis C\n\nDisclosures: G.

Sensitive Biomarkers of Metabolic Risk in Children Treated with Antipsychotics\n\nGinger E. Nicol*, Michael D. Yingling, Julia A. Schweiger, John W. Newcomer\n\nWashington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri\n\nBackground: Individuals with psychiatric illnesses who are chronically treated with antipsychotic medications are known to be at increased risk for developing diabetes and cardiovascular disease. However, whether this increased risk is primarily due to weight gain and increased adiposity, psychiatric diagnosis or antipsychotic treatment status is unknown. It is critical to identify those individuals at greatest risk for disease in order to accurately target prevention and treatment approaches. The identification of proximate, noninvasive biomarkers of metabolic risk for use as surrogate markers can address this problem. Carotid artery intima media thickness (CIMT) is a known indicator of risk for developing cardiovascular disease, and changes in CIMT are positively correlated with metabolic syndrome criteria in otherwise healthy youth. Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (1 H MRS) measuring hepatocyte triglyceride content (HTGC) is a surrogate measure of steatohepatitis, the most common liver abnormality found in children. The present study explored the relationship between adiposity, CIMT and HTGC in a cohort of antipsychotic-treated youth and Body Mass Index percentile (BMI%ile)-matched healthy controls. We hypothesized that level of adiposity, irrespective of antipsychotic treatment status, would be the primary predictor of metabolic risk as measured by CIMT and HTGC.\n\nMethods: Participants were antipsychotic-treated youth and healthy controls ages 6–19, matched between groups across a range of BMI %ile spanning normal, overweight and obese. Primary outcome measures included CIMT, measured with 9-MHz B-mode ultrasonography and HTGC, measured with 1 H MRS of the liver. Body composition was measured via Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DEXA). Additional plasma measures included fasting glucose, insulin and lipids, as well as fibrinogen, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), 25-hydroxyvitamin D and liver enzymes. Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) and multiple stepwise regression analyses were used to identify separate best-fit models for the prediction of CIMT and HTGC values, testing the predictive values of individual and combinations of conventional variables. The dependent variables of interest were CIMT and HTGC; the primary covariate was DEXA total % fat. All analyses were performed using SPSS.\n\nResults: A total of 43 children, mean age 11.5 (SD 2.9, SE=0.4) years participated in the study (antipsychotic treated n=24, healthy controls n=19). Groups were closely matched on age, gender, waist circumference and BMI%ile. Ten patients were receiving aripiprazole at a mean daily dose of 7.6 mg (SD=5.6, SE=1.8), 7 were receiving olanzapine at a mean daily dose of 3.9 mg (SD=2.0, SE=0.7), 6 were receiving risperidone at a mean daily dose of 1.5 mg (SD=2.2, SE=0.9), and 1 was receiving quetiapine at a mean daily dose of 100 mg. There were no significant differences between BMI%ile matched patients and controls on CIMT (F[1,40]=1.95, p=0.17) or HGTC (F[1,42]=1.46, p=0.23). In addition, no group differences were observed on BMI%ile (F[1,42]=1.31, p=0.26), DEXA percent fat (F[1,42]=0.67, p=0.42) fasting glucose (F[1,42]=0.20, p=0.65) or fasting insulin (F[1,42]=1.55, p=0.22). In the overall sample, DEXA total % fat explained the majority of the variance in both CIMT (34%, F[1,40]=20.08, p⩽0.0001) and HTGC (30%, F[1,42]=17.58, p⩽0.0001). Further, BMI%ile accounted for 30.4% of the variance in CIMT (F[1,40]=17.02, p⩽0.0001) and 15.2% of the variance in HTGC (F[1,42]=7.35, p=0.01). Other plasma variables (eg fasting glucose, lipids, insulin, inflammatory markers and HOMA-IR) contributed to variance in both HGTC and CIMT, but to a lesser degree.\n\nConclusions: This is the first study we know of to examine sensitive indicators of metabolic risk like CIMT and HTGC in youth treated with antipsychotic agents. The results of this study, conducted in both treated and untreated youth, indicate that adiposity measured either by DEXA or BMI%ile was a consistent predictor of metabolic risk measured either by CIMT or HTGC. The strength of this relationship did not differ when comparing treated psychiatric patients versus untreated healthy controls, indicating the importance of adiposity as a general predictor of metabolic risk in youth, regardless of antipsychotic treatment status. Plasma markers, such as fasting glucose, lipids and insulin, had less of a predictive effect on CIMT and HTGC. These results suggest that screening and monitoring efforts in this population may be most effectively focused on clinically available surrogate measures of body composition and adiposity, such as BMI%ile.\n\nSupport: Supported by the Brain & Behavior Research Foundation (formerly known as NARSAD), this research was also made possible by Grant Number P30DK056341 from the National Institute of Diabetes And Digestive And Kidney Diseases and Grant Number UL1RR024992 from the National Center for Research Resources (NCRR), a component of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and NIH Roadmap for Medical Research.

Increased Rate of Chiari I Malformation in Children of Depressed Mothers Treated with Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors during Pregnancy\n\nRebecca Knickmeyer*, Samantha Meltzer-Brody, Sandra Woolson, Robert M. Hamer, Keith Smith, Kenneth Lury, John Gilmore\n\nUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, North Carolina\n\nBackground: Recent estimates suggest over 10% of pregnant women fill prescriptions for Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs). Research on prenatal SSRI exposure effects on child health has yielded conflicting results, and is scarce regarding brain development. The objective of the current study was to determine whether there is a statistically significant increase in Chiari I malformations (CIM) in children with prenatal exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI). CIM is a condition in which the cerebellar tonsils extend below the foramen magnum, increasing risk for a variety of neurological phenomena including headaches, ocular and otoneurological disturbances, lower cranial nerve signs, hydrocephalus, and spinal cord syrinx.\n\nMethods: In this retrospective cohort study,33 children whose mothers had received a diagnosis of depression and took SSRIs during pregnancy were matched to 66 unexposed controls whose mothers did not have a diagnosis of depression. In addition, 30 children whose mothers had received a diagnosis of depression, but did not receive antidepressants during pregnancy, were matched to 60 unexposed controls whose mothers did not have a diagnosis of depression. The main outcome measure was presence/absence of CIM on MRI scans at 1 and/or 2 years of age. Scans were reviewed by 2 independent neuroradiologists, blind to exposure status.\n\nResults: SSRI exposed children were significantly more likely to be classified as CIM than controls (18% versus 2%). Duration of exposure increased risk. Children of mothers who had received a diagnosis of depression, but did not receive antidepressants during pregnancy, did not differ from controls in occurrence of CIM (7 vs 5%).\n\nConclusions: This study found a significant increase of CIM in children with prenatal SSRI exposure. As CIM was not elevated in children of mothers with a history of depression, but no antidepressant treatment during pregnancy, we feel we can rule out shared genetic risk for CIM and depression. Additional research is needed to clarify whether SSRIs directly impact risk for CIM or whether this relationship is mediated by severity of depression during pregnancy.\n\nKeywords: SSRI, depression, pregnancy\n\nDisclosures: R.

Bethea*, Oleg Varlamov, Paul Kievit, Arubala P. Reddy, Charles T. Roberts\n\nOregon National Primate Research Center, Beaverton, Oregon\n\nBackground: Clinical and animal data suggest that atypical antipsychotics such as olanzapine (OLZ) induce significant metabolic changes that are serious side effects of their primary use. Since controlled human studies are problematic and rodent data may be poorly translatable, we sought a macaque model of OLZ-induced metabolic disease. Normal monkey chow contains significantly lower calories from sugar and fat compared to a western style diet (WSD). Therefore, we examined metabolic endpoints in the presence and absence of OLZ with monkey chow or WSD.\n\nMethods: A female Japanese macaque was administered OLZ (5 mg/kg/day) for 6 months, with dietary changes at 2-month intervals as follows: OLZ+restricted chow, OLZ+unrestricted chow, OLZ+WSD, and placebo+WSD. Weight was accessed weekly, with glucose tolerance tests (GTT) and Dexascans performed at baseline and every 2 months. To evaluate adipose-specific effects, visceral (V) and subcutaneous (SC) adipose tissue biopsies were obtained at baseline and after OLZ+unrestricted chow and OLZ+WSD to evaluate adipocyte size, lipolysis and insulin-stimulated fatty acid uptake. A separate trial was conducted on 2 monkeys with 5 days of OLZ- or no-treatment followed by RT-PCR on rostral and medial basal hypothalamus (MBH).\n\nResults: Weight increased on OLZ+restricted chow and stabilized on OLZ+unrestricted chow. OLZ+WSD did not significantly change the plateau in 2 months. Weight declined upon withdrawal of OLZ with continued WSD. Body fat increased from 14% at baseline to 22%, 30%, 28% and 19% at 2, 4, 6 and 8 mo, respectively, indicating that body fat was elevated on OLZ regardless of diet and declined upon OLZ removal. Fasting glucose levels were normal; and glucose tolerance and the insulin response during GTT were normal with OLZ+restricted chow or OLZ+unrestricted chow. Addition of WSD with OLZ impaired glucose tolerance during GTT. Insulin remained in the normal range, but first phase insulin secretion was reduced. Hence, insulin did not respond to elevated glucose during GTT. After removal of OLZ but continued WSD, glucose clearance returned to normal. However, this was associated with hyperinsulinemia, perhaps triggered by early insulin resistance. Adipocyte diameter was increased in V and SQ fat by OLZ+chow and OLZ+WSD (p<0.01, 2-way ANOVA), but OLZ+WSD was not different from OLZ+chow. Isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis was present in V and SQ fat. Lipolysis was similar between baseline and OLZ+chow, but it was significantly reduced by addition of WSD (ANOVA p<0.0001; posthoc p<0.05). Insulin increased FFA uptake at baseline. However, insulin-induced FFA uptake was blunted with OLZ administration +chow or +WSD in both V and SC fat (posthoc p<0.05), suggesting the early development of adipose insulin resistance. There was an increase in expression of AgRP and a decrease in expression of CART & ghrelin in MBH and rostral hypothalamus compared to untreated control tissue. 5HT2C mRNA increased and POMC mRNA decreased in the MBH with OLZ treatment. There was no apparent change in MCR4 in either region.\n\nConclusions: We conclude that OLZ acts on peripheral tissues as well as in the CNS; that changes in hypothalamic gene expression precede increased fat accumulation; that adipose tissue exhibits insulin resistance prior to alterations in GTT/ITT; that addition of WSD to OLZ precipitates impaired glucose tolerance without an obvious insulin response; and that removal of OLZ and continued WSD resulted in normalized glucose tolerance and elevated insulin. These data suggest OLZ rapidly changes hypothalamic gene expression; decreases insulin sensitivity in adipose tissue, and may suppress insulin with high fat diet. These data suggest complex and early responses to OLZ that may be exacerbated by WSD. Further study is needed with more animals.\n\nKeywords: atypical antipsychotics, olanzapine; weight, body fat, glucose, insulin resistance, hypothalamus\n\nDisclosures: C.

The Risk of Switch to Mania in Patients with Bipolar Disorder during Treatment with Antidepressants Alone and in Combination with a Mood Stabilizer\n\nMikael Landén*, Michael E. Thase\n\nGothenburg University, Gothenburg, Sweden\n\nBackground: Depressive episodes are the most burdensome aspect of bipolar disorderillness and, as such, antidepressants are widely prescribed, even thoughevidence of efficacy is sparse. The use of antidepressant monotherapy is,however, discouraged due to the widely held belief that this confers a risk fortreatment emergent manic episodes. Treatment guidelines submit thatantidepressants should be used in combination with mood stabilizers, althoughevidence that such combinations tangibly diminish risks or improve outcomes islargely lacking.\n\nMethods: Using Swedish national registries, we identified 3,240 people withbipolar disorder who started treatment with antidepressants, without anyantidepressant treatment the prior year. We stratified patients into those thatwere on antidepressant monotherapy, and those on antidepressant plus a moodstabilizer. We used stratified Cox regression analyses to compare the rate ofmania 0–3 and 3–9 months after start of antidepressant medication with apreceding non-treated period. We used a within-individual design to control forconfounding by disorder severity, genetic and early environmental factors.\n\nResults: The increased risk of treatment emergent mania was confined to patientson antidepressant monotherapy [hazard ratio (HR) 2·83, 95% confidence interval(CI) 1·12–7·19]. Patients on a concurrent mood stabilizer displayed asignificantly decreased risk of mania 0–3 months after start ofantidepressant treatment (HR 0·64, 95%CI 0·46–0·90) and a suggestive decreasedrisk of mania also after 3–9 months (HR 0·72, 95%CI 0·51-1·03).\n\nConclusions: The results show that the use of mood stabilizers decreases the risk formania in patients receiving antidepressants for treatment of bipolar depressiveepisodes. The finding that antidepressant monotherapy increases the risk ofmania is in line with previous findings and supportive of current practiceguidelines. Our data do not address whether or not antidepressants effectivelytreat or subsequently prevent bipolar depressive episodes.\n\nKeywords: mood stabilizer, treatment emerging switch, antidepressant, bipolar disorder\n\nDisclosures: M.

Do α2-Containing Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors Play a Role in Baseline and Nicotine-modulated Behaviors in Mice?\n\nShahrdad Lotfipour*, Janet Byun, Prescott Leach, Christie D. Fowler, Niall Murphy, Paul Kenny, Thomas J. Gould, Jim Boulter\n\nUniveristy of California, Los Angeles, California\n\nBackground: The Chrna2 gene encodes the α2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunit. The α2-containing (α2*) nAChRs are expressed in areas of the brain known to regulate many of the behavioral effects of nicotine, including its effects on learning and memory and also the reinforcing properties of the drug. However, little is known about the contribution of α2* nAChRs to the behavioral effects of nicotine. Here, we provide a comprehensive report on the genetic design and behavioral characterization of the Chrna2 null mutant mouse line.\n\nMethods: Targeted deletion of the α2 nAChR subunit was performed by the insertion of a neomycin resistance cassette in exon 5 of the Chrna2 gene. Behavioral studies assessed motor, sensory, anxiety, and food reinforcement in the Chrna2 null mutant mouse line. Behavioral effects of nicotine were also assessed in the mutant mice, including cued, contextual and trace fear conditioning, intravenous self-administration and somatic and affective measures of nicotine withdrawal.\n\nResults: We found that Chrna2 null mutant mice have subtle yet discernible deficits in aspects of motor coordination, nicotine-induced analgesia, nicotine self-administration behavior, and nicotine-induced somatic and affective withdrawal signs. Chrna2 null mutant mice also exhibited a sex-dependent enhancement of nicotine-facilitated cued, but not trace or contextual fear conditioning.\n\nConclusions: These data suggest that the absence of the Chrna2 gene in the mouse brain plays a limited role in modifying baseline behaviors but does influence a number of nicotine-facilitated behaviors.\n\nKeywords: nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, memory, withdrawal, self-administration, addiction\n\nDisclosures: S.

Briand*, Chris Pierce\n\nUniversity of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\n\nBackground: During abstinence, memories associated with drug-taking persist and the inability to eliminate these drug memories is thought to underlie addiction. Eliminating these drug-paired memories could provide an opportunity for therapeutic intervention. Converging evidence suggest that zeta inhibitory peptide (ZIP) eliminates memories for experience-dependent behaviors, included conditioned drug associations. However, it is not known whether the elimination of these memories alters drug relapse. ZIP is a synthetic compound designed bind the constitutively active form of atypical PKC, PKMζ, a protein implicated in learning and memory. However, recent evidence from PKMζ knockout mice suggests that ZIP may function through alternative mechanisms.\n\nMethods: The current study examined the effect of ZIP administration in the nucleus accumbens on cocaine-primed reinstatement of cocaine seeking, a rodent model of relapse.\n\nResults: We demonstrate that intraaccumbal ZIP blocks cocaine-primed reinstatement when administered 24-hours or 1 week prior to testing. Interestingly, ZIP infusion has no effect on the reinstatement of food seeking.\n\nConclusions: Experiments utilizing PKMæ knockout mice are underway to determine whether the effects of ZIP are dependent upon its actions on PKMζ. These results suggest that further examination of ZIP's mechanism of action could provide novel targets for the treatment of cocaine addiction.\n\nKeywords: Cocaine, reinstatement, PKMzeta, addiction, drug memory\n\nDisclosures: L.

Fowler*, Brian Lee, Paul Kenny\n\nThe Scripps Research Institute, Jupiter, Florida\n\nBackground: Allelic variation in the CHRNA5 gene, which encodes the α5 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunit, has been repeatedly associated with tobacco dependence. Paradoxically, the same genetic variation has been correlated with a decreased risk of developing cocaine dependence (Grucza et al. , Biol Psychiatry, 2008). The role of α5-containing (denoted α5*) nAChRs in regulating the reinforcing properties of cocaine that drive dependence has not been explored. Thus, we sought to investigate whether α5* nAChRs influence cocaine self-administration and/or modulate cocaine's effects on brain reward function. We also investigated whether α5* nAChRs regulate cocaine-mediated neuronal signaling in the striatum, a key brain structure implicated in cocaine reinforcement.\n\nMethods: Mice with null mutation of the α5 nAChR subunit gene (Chrna5) and their wildtype littermates were trained to respond for food reward under a fixed ratio 5, time-out 20 s (FR5TO20 sec) schedule of reinforcement during 1-h daily testing sessions. Next, the mice were permitted access to a training dose of cocaine (0.3 mg kg−1 per infusion) for intravenous self-administration. After stable responding on the training dose, a full cocaine dose-response function (0.03–3.0 mg kg−1) was characterized according to a Latin square design. A second set of mice were implanted with cranial electrodes and trained in a discrete-trial current-threshold intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) procedure until stable reward thresholds were obtained. Mice were then injected with varying doses of cocaine (2.5–20 mg kg−1) according to a Latin square design. Finally, striatal sections from a third set of wildtype and α5 knockout mice were examined for baseline and cocaine-evoked alterations in neuronal activity using whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiological recordings.\n\nResults: Wildtype and α5 knockout mice similarly acquired cocaine self-administration at the moderate training dose. However, when a lower dose of cocaine was available, α5 knockout mice increased their cocaine consumption compared to wildtype mice. When brain reward thresholds were assessed, wildtype mice exhibited a ‘U’ shaped dose response curve, with reward threshold lowering across all of the doses tested. In contrast, the α5 knockout mice displayed a shallower dose response function, suggesting less sensitivity to the rewarding effects of cocaine. Moreover, at the highest dose of cocaine, α5 knockout mice demonstrated an elevated threshold over baseline values, suggesting an aversive/inhibitory effect on brain reward function. The baseline and cocaine-mediated activity of striatal neurons differed dramatically between the wildtype and α5 knockout mice, suggesting that α5* nAChRs modulate cocaine's effects within the striatum.\n\nConclusions: These data suggest that α5* nAChRs in the striatum regulate the reward-enhancing properties of cocaine and thereby control consumption of the drug. Specifically, deficient expression of α5 nAChR subunits blunted the reward-enhancing effects of cocaine and thus resulted in a compensatory increase in self-administration at a lower dose of the drug, differences which may be attributed to altered cholinergic signaling in the striatum. Together, these findings reveal a fundamental role for α5* nAChR signaling in cocaine reinforcement, may explain the observed protective effects of allelic variation in CHRNA5 for cocaine dependence, and identify a novel target for the development of therapeutics to treat cocaine addiction.

Exome Sequencing in Rhesus Macaques Exhibiting Individual Differences in Aggression\n\nCarlos Driscoll*, Kevin Blackistone, Jessica Clemente, Stephen Lindell, Stephen Suomi, Christina Barr\n\nSection on Comparative Behavioral Genomics, Laboratory of Neurogenetics, Bethesda, Maryland\n\nBackground: Aggression is a behavioral trait that appears to be under selection, as it facilitates access to resources and mating opportunities across mammals, including in primates. However, in humans, exaggerated aggression is known to be a hallmark of a number of psychiatric and personality disorders. The rhesus macaque (Macaca mulata) has been used to model some aspects of such disorders and has also been used for identifying functional genetic polymorphisms that predict individual differences in behavior. While the commercially abundant rhesus macaque is one of the most widely used nonhuman primate in biomedical research, few studies have attempted to compare coding-sequence variation between macaque and human, which could further inform its use as a model for human biology, including these behavioral differences. Here, two Indian rhesus macaques, distinguished by marked differences in reactivity and temperament, were characterized for genome-wide protein-coding variation by using commercially available human-exome based pull-down assays and whole exome sequencing.\n\nMethods: Two Indian rhesus macaque subjects that were selected based on being very passive or very aggressive were characterized for genome-wide protein-coding variation. Exploiting the phylogenetically close relationship between human and macaque we leveraged the high degree of sequence similarity between them by using a human-based exon assay (Agilent) on the Illumina Genome Analyzer platform.\n\nResults: Human-on-macaque exon pulldown and sequencing successfully resolved ∼80% of the sequences expected from a human-on-human assay. After filtering (depth of coverage > 20; Qscore >100), approximately 274,000 SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) were called, ∼94,000 in target regions. 244,670 SNPs were novel as compared to the 2.7 × 106 SNPs reported for macaque in the ensemble variation database (v71). Ts/Tv ratios and distribution percentages were similar to results previously reported in transcriptome sequencing of macaque (Yuan et al., 2012). SNPs, some of which are predicted to be potentially deleterious by in silico analysis, were found in the transcribed region of 41 genes and in the coding region of 31 of those, including several behavior-related genes of interest to alcohol-dependence. For verification, six candidate behavior-related genes (MPDZ, TDRD1, GAL, CRTAC1, GABRA6, CRHR2) showing non-synonymous SNPs (variants that predicted amino acid changes) in exon capture were verified by Sanger sequencing in 23 additional macaques (in addition to the two exome sequenced individuals).\n\nConclusions: An advantage of exome sequencing is the immense potential for efficiently identifying functional variants, since only the protein coding sequences are screened for variation. Here we show that cross-species exome capture using off-the-shelf commercially available arrays can be a valuable tool for discovery of functional variation in the rhesus macaque relevant to human disease. This information can help guide animal model development and translational research. In particular, the CRH and the GABA systems are known to relate to stress-induced and escalated aggression in rodents. Our results may support a role for polymorphism at these genes in contributing to individual differences in aggressive behavior in humans and may further support a role for targeting these systems to treat or attenuate aggression and violence in select subjects.\n\nKeywords: whole-exome, rhesus macaque, CRHR2, GABRA6, agression\n\nDisclosures: C.

Robson*, Chong-Bin Zhu, Kathryn M. Lindler, Nicole Baganz, Jane Wright, William Hewlett, Randy D. Blakely\n\nVanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee\n\nBackground: Depression is a debilitating disease that accounts for a significant loss in productivity and healthcare costs worldwide. Altered central serotonin (5-HT) signaling have been linked to various psychiatric conditions, including depression, anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder and autism spectrum disorder. The presynaptic 5-HT transporter (SERT) limits access of 5-HT receptors to the neurotransmitter in the brain and periphery and is a target for widely prescribed antidepressant medications. The mechanisms by which SERT is regulated under normal and pathophysiological states are poorly understood. We have shown (Zhu et al, 2006; Chang et al, 2012) SERT to be regulated by a p38 MAPK linked pathway downstream of IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) activation by IL-1β. Application IL-1β to mouse brain synaptosomes in vitro results in a rapid stimulation of SERT activity that is lost in IL-1R KO mice. Moreover, peripheral LPS-induced inflammation results in a rapid increase in CNS SERT activity and increased immobility in the tail suspension test, with both effects lost in IL-1R KO mice (Zhu et al, 2010). Since IL-1Rs are expressed throughout the body, including the CNS, constitutive IL-1R KO mice are insufficient to determine the site(s) and timing of receptor expression and IL-1β that support 5-HT dependent behavioral changes. To pursue this question, we have generated mice suitable for the conditional elimination of the IL-1R (IL-1Rflox/flox). These animals will be used in parallel with animals carrying a conditional allele of p38 MAPKα, the key signaling pathway through which the IL-1R regulates SERT activity.\n\nMethods: To generate a Il1r1flox/flox allele, we used a conventional homologous recombination approach to insert loxP sites flanking the 3rd and 4th exons of the Il1r1 gene in 129S6 embryonic stem cells. Injection of these cells lead to the generation of chimeric animals that passed the floxed gene through the germline. IL-1Rflox/flox animals have been produced that are congenic on a 129S6 background and approaching congenic status on a C57BL/6J background. To determine whether the presence of loxP sites is detrimental to IL-1R gene expression, we used quantitative RT-PCR to determine relative IL-1R mRNA expression in both midbrain and spleen of 129S6 IL-1Rflox/flox mice and wild type (WT) 129S6 controls. As we wish to pursue the role of the IL-1R in SERT gulation, ex vivo 5-HT uptake assays were utilized to measure SERT function in midbrain and frontal cortex synaptosomes from these animals. All animals were housed in AAALAC-approved facilities and experiments were conducted under an approved protocol annually reviewed by the Vanderbilt Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\nResults: Initial characterization of IL-1Rflox/flox mice reveals that these animals are viable, reproduce normally, and display no gross abnormalities. QuantitativeRT-PCR studies reveal no alterations of IL-1R mRNA levels in either midbrain or spleen, consistent with the benign nature of inserted loxP sites. Additionally, IL-1Rflox/flox animals demonstrate normal paroxetine-sensitive, synaptosomal SERT activity, also seen with p38 MAPKflox/flox mice. Successful, raphe-specific, p38 MAPKα elimination has been achieved using ePET-1 Cre mice (Scott et al, 2005) and efforts are now being pursued to use the same approach to eliminate the IL-1R in 5-HT neurons. Intact IL-1R mRNA expression and SERT activity provides an optimum background for evaluation of the actions of the cytokine receptor in vivo.\n\nConclusions: The studies above indicate successful generation of IL-1Rflox/flox mice with evidence of normal breeding, growth and morphology. The availability of these mice will allow for the regional and temporal elimination of IL-1Rs, providing a powerful tool to dissect the actions of IL-1β in the brain and periphery. With respect to our goals, these animals will afford a critical opportunity to evaluate IL-1R-mediated p38 MAPK signaling in the activation of SERT at synapses and the role of this activation in 5-HT signaling and behavior. Given the comorbidity of immune system dysfunction with multiple neuropsychiatric disorders, our animal model should have translational relevance, including the examination of immune system-based therapeutics.

Genes Harboring Addiction-related Variants Alter Dose-response Relationships for Stimulant Reward\n\nGeorge Uhl*, Frank S. Hall, Barbara Ranscht, Noriko Uetani, Jana Drgonova\n\nNational Institute on Drug Abuse, Baltimore, Maryland\n\nBackground: Abused substances typically provide inverted U dose response relationships, thought to represent balances between rewarding and aversive influences of most of these addictive substances. Though classical genetic studies identify substantial heritable influences on addiction-related phenotypes that include quantity/frequency of substance use, there has been little emphasis on the possibility that shifted dose-response relationships for the reward that comes from use of addictive substances might provide substantial impact on the genetic influences on vulnerability to substance use disorders.\n\nMethods: Genes that harbor GWAS associaton signals with groups of nearby SNPs displaying 10–2 > p > 10–8 association in each of multiple independent human dependent vs control samples were identified. Association with level of mRNA expression in postmortem cerebral cortical specimens with SNPs in these genes was assessed using PLINK. Mice with variation in levels of expression of these genes were tested using cocaine conditoned place preference, with control tests of strength, mobility, and memory (Morris water maze and others).\n\nResults: The cell adhesion molecules CDH13 and PTPRD were identified in >12 indepdent samples from GWAS signals that, individually, were below Bonferroni-corrected levels for genome wide significance. Each of these was expressed in postmortem cerebral cortical samples in ways that correlated significantly with genotypes at SNPs located in the 5’ ends of the genes. Heterozygous knockout mice for each of these genes displayed remarkably-left-shifted dose response relationships for cocaine conditioned place preference. Reward from 5 mg/kg doses was greater than that from 10 mg/kg doses (10 mg/kg is optimal in wildtype littermates). Tests of locomotion and memory provided no obvious confounding influences. Literature searches provided remarkably confirmatory support for these shifted dose response relationships from GWAS studies of individual differences in responses to acutely administered amphetamine and description og responses to first alcohol self administrations.\n\nConclusions: Addiction genetics appears to receive substantial contributions from genetic variants that alter dose response relationships for addictive substances in experimental animals in ways that receive support from human data. Consequences of these shifted dose-response relationships for addiction vulnerability, progression of use of addictive substances, and pharmacotherapeutic approach to addiction have been modestly explored, if at all. Differences in dose response relationships do not play prominent roles in nosology, except for the active interest in alcohol. As more comparable observations are accrued, it will become more difficult not to include explicit assessment of dose-response relationships into thinking about addiction and substance dependence disorders.\n\nKeywords: cocaine, amphetamine, knockout mouse, translational reserach, polygenic disorder\n\nDisclosures: G.

Mother's 5-HTTLPR Genotype X Infant's Genotype Interact to Affect Mother-i Interactions and Developmental Outcomes: Aggression, Anxiety, and Social Behavior\n\nPatrick O’Connell, Jenna Jackson, Stephen Lindell, Andrea Sorenson, Courtney Lindell, Melanie L. Schwandt, Stephen J. Suomi, Christina Barr, J. Dee Higley*\n\nBrigham Young University, Provo, Utah\n\nBackground: Thomas and Chess showed that mother-infant interactions can be classified as easy or difficult according to the temperament of both the mother and the infant. It is likely by the genes of the infant and the mother modulate this effect, but studies have to date not assessed how the genotypes of the two interact to affect the infant's developmental outcome. Nonhuman primates are ideally suited to assess such questions both because of their close similarity to humans and because environments can be closely controlled. Using a nonhuman primate model, rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) mother-infant pairs were longitudinally assessed measuring mother-infant interactions and the infants’ behavioral outcomes with other group members.\n\nMethods: Both the mother and the infant were genotyped for the serotonin transporter genotype (5-HTTLPR). In addition, mothers’ were classified according to early rearing experiences. In Study 1 (N=95 pairs), naturally occurring mother-infant interactions were assessed weekly for the first six months of life using two 300 s sessions. Study 2—Attachment theorists rate attachment quality according to how an infant responds to reunion after separation. Hence, in Study 2 mother-infant interactions were assessed during mother-infant reunions following four, 4-day social separations (N=120 pairs). Behaviors were reduced to general categories using factor analysis, and factor scores were analyzed using ANOVA. Independent variables included the 5-HTTLPR genotype of both the mother and infant and mothers early rearing.\n\nResults: Study 1 - There were significant infant genotype by mother genotype interactions for distress vocalizations [f(1/98) 3.74, p<0.05]. Mothers’ rearing interacted with genotype affecting freezing (a measure of anxiety) [f(2/83) 5.02, p<0.01] and mothers’ rearing interacted with mother's genotype to modulate sociality [f(2/83) 4.22, p<0.02]. In addition, only the infants of whose genotype matched their mothers’ genotype exhibited aggression. Significant infant genotype main effects were seen for the frequency in which the infants received aggression from other group members [f(2/83) 6.87 p<0.01], with the Ls infants receiving more aggression. Study 2 showed that during mother-infant reunions, infant sociality was affected if both the mother and the infant were heterozygous for the transporter genotype, with both possessing the Ls genotype. Compared to other genotype combinations, infants from MI pairs where both mother and infant had the Ls genotype approached mother more often (p =0.03), and failed to engage in positive social interactions such as grooming with mother or other group members. Furthermore, infants and mothers homozygous for the long genotype (LL) were the only group of infants to display any kind of aggressive defense of status, and these infants were the only ones to engage in social play during reunions.\n\nConclusions: Our results are the first to our knowledge that have assessed the interaction between parent genotype and offspring genotype as it impacts infant development. Our studies suggest that the mother-infant interaction is more conflict ridden and that infant outcome is less optional when both the mother and the infant possess the short allele. Moreover, infant outcome is modulated by this interaction. We suggest that the underlying mechanism that leads to such negative effects is that the mother's genotype produces a phenotype that leads to a different genotypic-related environment. This in turn affects the infant's genotypic-mediated outcomes. Our findings are consistent with recent studies of aggression showing that the genotype of the perpetrator and victim interact to modulate aggression and suggest a novel way of looking at social interactions.\n\nKeywords: serotonin primate genotype gene X environment early experience\n\nDisclosures: P.

Genome-wide Mapping of Complex Psychiatric Traits in Commercially Available Outbred Mice\n\nClarissa C. Parker*, Natalia M. Gonzales, Abraham A. Palmer\n\nMiddlebury College, Middlebury, Vermont\n\nBackground: Mice offer a powerful tool for elucidating the genetic basis of behavioral and physiological traits with relevance to psychiatric disorders. Identifying specific genes that underlie these traits has proven difficult because their individual contributions are small and because most studies focus on crosses between inbred strains that possess few recombinations. As a result, conventional approaches have only been able to locate large chromosomal regions, but not specific genes. Now, as technologies for genotyping have evolved, it is no longer expensive or difficult to perform GWAS in highly recombinant populations of mice.\n\nMethods: We have taken advantage of an extant outbred population that has been maintained using an outbred breeding scheme for more than 100 generations. We carefully phenotyped 1200 male CFW mice for a battery of behavioral traits including methamphetamine sensitivity, conditioned fear, and prepulse inhibition. Mice were genotyped using a genotyping by sequencing approach (GBS) at ∼300k markers across the genome. In addition, we performed RNASeq on three brain regions (prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and striatum) from a subset of 80 animals.\n\nResults: We conducted a GWAS for the behavioral phenotypes and gene expression traits and identified many significant SNPs that were associated with each trait. For example, we identified 3 SNPs within Frmd4b, Fkbp8, and Nbas that were significantly correlated with startle response on the prepulse inhibition behavioral paradigm. In addition, these genes are all expressed in the adult brain, making them promising candidates for future studies.\n\nConclusions: By exploiting the increased recombination frequency in outbred mice, we mapped behavioral and gene expression QTLs with greater precision than previous approaches. By identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were associated with both behavioral phenotypes and gene-expression traits we can begin to identify plausible biological explanations for how these alleles influence behavior and thereby implicate specific genes. This information can in turn be used to identify alleles that contribute to human psychiatric disease, elucidate causative biological mechanisms, or assist in the development of putative treatment strategies for psychiatric disorders.\n\nKeywords: GWAS, conditioned fear, methamphetamine sensitivity, prepulse inhibition, mice\n\nDisclosures: C.

A Cross-species Investigation into the Role of Lhx6 in Cortical Inhibitory Circuitry Disturbances in Schizophrenia\n\nDavid W. Volk*, Jessica R. Edelson, David A. Lewis\n\nUniversity of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\n\nBackground: Disturbances in the inhibitory circuitry of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in schizophrenia are most prominent in the subpopulations of GABA neurons that express the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin (PV) or the neuropeptide somatostatin (SST). Since PFC GABA neurons undergo anatomical, molecular, and synaptic changes across childhood and adolescence, incomplete postnatal development of PFC GABA neurons has been hypothesized as a potential pathogenetic process in schizophrenia. However, reports of incomplete phenotypic specification of PV neurons and arrested migration of SST neurons in the PFC suggest that the disease process may begin earlier, even prenatally, and interfere with the birth, migration, cell-type specification, and/or maturation of these neurons. Consistent with this hypothesis, we recently reported deficits in the cell type-specific transcription factor Lhx6, which selectively regulate the prenatal development of PV and SST neurons, in the PFC in a cohort of 42 schizophrenia subjects. A complete absence of Lhx6 prenatally in mice, albeit more severe than the Lhx6 deficit reported in schizophrenia, leads to reduced tangential migration and impeded differentiation into PFC PV and SST neurons.\n\nHowever, further investigation into the developmental role of Lhx6 in the pathogenesis of PV and SST neuron dysfunction in schizophrenia requires a translational, cross-species approach. First, we determined whether deficits in PFC Lhx6 mRNA levels are also present in a new cohort of 20 schizophrenia subjects. Second, to determine whether deficits in Lhx6 mRNA in schizophrenia are consistent with a pattern of incomplete postnatal developmental processes, we analyzed the postnatal developmental trajectory of Lhx6 mRNA expression in the PFC of a large cohort of monkeys. Finally, we used mice with an Lhx6 heterozygous null mutation (Lhx6+/−) to investigate the extent to which a partial loss of Lhx6 that is more similar in magnitude to that seen in schizophrenia may contribute to other reported disturbances in GABA-related markers in the PFC in schizophrenia.\n\nMethods: Human subjects. Twenty schizophrenia subjects were individually matched to healthy comparison subjects for sex and age. The mean age, postmortem interval, brain pH, RNA integrity number, and tissue storage time did not differ between subject groups. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was used to measure Lhx6 mRNA levels in PFC area 9 using the comparative threshold cycle method with four replicate measures per target gene, and target gene expression levels were normalized using three reference genes. Developmental monkeys. Forty-nine rhesus macaque monkeys ranging in age from 1 week to 11.5 years were assigned to four age groups (perinatal, childhood, peripubertal, and adult). RNA was isolated from gray matter of the frontal pole (area 10) due to the availability of existing tissue. Lhx6 mRNA levels were quantified by qPCR as described above. Lhx6+/− mice. Fresh, frozen brains of young adult male Lhx6+/− mice (n=9) and wild-type littermate male mice (n=9) were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory. RNA was isolated from frontal cortex homogenates, and qPCR for GABA-related markers is being performed as described above. In situ hybridization for PV mRNA with film analysis and cellular grain counting analyses is also being conducted in the medial PFC.\n\nResults: Lhx6 mRNA levels were lower (−13%) in the prefrontal cortex of the new cohort of schizophrenia subjects relative to healthy comparison subjects and were not related to substance abuse, smoking or use of psychotropic medications at time of death. In the cohort of monkeys of different postnatal ages, Lhx6 mRNA levels declined 23% from the perinatal period to childhood then remained stable throughout adolescence and adulthood. Finally, mean Lhx6 mRNA levels were 45% lower in frontal cortex homogenates of Lhx6+/− mice relative to wild-type littermate mice which is consistent with a loss of gene function in one Lhx6 allele. Studies of additional GABA-related markers by qPCR and in situ hybridization in the Lhx6+/− mice are underway.\n\nConclusions: In this study, we utilized a cross-species approach to further investigate the role of Lhx6 in the pathogenesis of PFC PV and SST neuron dysfunction in schizophrenia. The replicated finding of deficits in Lhx6 mRNA levels in a new cohort of schizophrenia subjects suggests that low Lhx6 mRNA levels, along with deficits in PV and SST mRNAs, are a common feature and integral part of PFC GABA circuitry dysfunction in schizophrenia. Second, we found that Lhx6 mRNA levels were highest in the PFC postnatally during the perinatal time period and declined until childhood in monkeys, which is consistent with reports of a prominent role of Lhx6 in the early development of PFC PV and SST neurons. In contrast, the stability of Lhx6 mRNA levels across childhood and adolescence suggests that Lhx6 may not be involved in the anatomical and molecular changes in PV and SST neurons that occur during this time period. Finally, employing a mouse model of partial loss of Lhx6 similar in magnitude to that reported in schizophrenia will allow a determination of whether a partial loss of Lhx6 is sufficient to produce the pattern of disturbances in GABA-related markers that has been reported in the illness.\n\nKeywords: GABA, parvalbumin, somatostatin, prefrontal, schizophrenia\n\nDisclosures: D.

DNA Methylation Network Dysregulation Expressed in Lymphocytes of Schizophrenic Patients\n\nRobert C. Smith*, James Auta, Henry Sershen, , Abel Lajtha, Sylvia Boules, Patricia L. Gerbarg, , Richard Brown , John M. Davis, Alessandro Guidotti\n\nNathaqnh Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research, Hewlett, New York\n\nBackground: Epigenetic dysregulation of the brain genome may be associated with the underlying pathophysiology of schizophrenia (SZ) and related psychosis. We and others have previously shown that two enzymes involved in the methylation/demethylation cycle --DNMT and TET are increased in the corticolimbic structures of postmortem brain of schizophrenic patients, and we have previously shown that the brain abnormalities in DNMT1 and 3A are also expressed in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). Other researchers have reported abnormalities in Glucocorticoid receptor (GCORTR) and brain derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) mRNA in the post-mortem brains of SZ. Promoters for these genes are importantly influenced by the extent of DNA methylation. In the current study we examined whether abnormalities in methylation/demethylation mRNA markers and GCORTR and BDNF mRNA are present in PBL of schizophrenic patients and are similar to those which have been found in post-mortem brain samples of SZ. In a related study we also examined the effects of Yoga treatment in schizophrenic patients on these markers.\n\nMethods: PBL were collected from 28 SZ patients and 21 Non psychotic controls (NP) participating in evaluation and treatment studies at NKI, and additional samples were collected at baseline and 3 months of SZ patients participating in a research project with standardized yoga treatment (3 × week) emphahzising Qigong movements and coherent breathing. Lymphocytes were separated by Ficoll-Paque plus centrifugation and RNA isolated by Trizol reagent and Qiagen RNeasy Kit, and converted to CDNA. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was performed using Applied Biosynthesis Real-Time PCR system and Fermentas Maxima SYBR Green/ROX qPCR Master Mix. PCR mixtures were run on a Stratagene (USA) Mx3005P QPCR System. Primers were designed to cross over one intron to amplify cDNA and yield an amplification of between 75–200 base pairs. CT value was used for relative quantification of target gene expression and normalized to β-actin and the relative expression levels were calculated as CT. Statistical analysis used t-tests and analysis of variance.\n\nResults: SZ showed a significant 40% decrease in DNMT1 mRNA (P=0.01) and a nearly 50% increase in TET1 (P=0.005) mRNA, and no change in MBD4 mRNA or APOBEC 3A mRNA. The changes in DNMT1, TET1 and MDB4 are similar those we previously reported in post-mortem brain samples of SZ. GCORTR mRNA was decreased by about 50 %(P<0.001) and BDNF-IXabcd m RNA was decreased by 32% (P=0.055). Additional analysis suggested that differences in characteristics related to demographic factors, smoking status, and differences in medication treatment were not likely confounds. Three months of Yoga significantly (P<0.05 to P<0.01) decreased DNMT1 and TET1 mRNA IN PBL of SZ. GCORTR mRNA was also significantly decreased in PBL by 3 months of Yoga treatment in SZ.\n\nConclusions: The finding that the expression of DNA methylating/demethylating enzymes and SZ candidate genes such as BDNF and GCORTR are altered in the same direction in both the brain and PBL support the hypothesis that a common epigenetic dysregulation may be operative in the brain and peripheral tissues of SZ patients. This opens up the possibility that changes in these or other epigenetic related markers may help in investigating the underlying molecular pathology of SZ in living subjects and potential for identifying vulnerability factors in prodromal subjects or those at higher risk. The effects of yoga on decreasing DNMT1 and TET1 in PBLs may point to future research using behavioral techniques to modify abnormalities in the methylation/demethylation pathway.\n\nKeywords: DNAm, schizophrenia, epigenetics, yoga\n\nDisclosures: R.

Rizavi, Yogesh Dwivedi\n\nUniversity of Illinois at Chicago Chicago, Illinois\n\nBackground: Bipolar illness (BP) and schizophrenia (SZ) are devastating mental disorders and although separate entities share many common features and possibly common biological abnormalities. There is some evidence to suggest that abnormalities of Wnt signaling pathway may be associated with the pathophysiology of BP illness and possibly SZ. Glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β and β-catenin are two important components of the Wnt signaling pathway. The activation of Wnt signaling pathway leads to the inactivation of GSK-3β, leading to the accumulation of β-catenin and its subsequent translocation to the nucleus. Treatment with lithium and antipsychotic drugs causes changes in the GSK-3β and β-catenin in the rat brain, suggesting that the alterations of these two components of the Wnt signaling pathway may be involved in the pathophysiology of these illnesses. However, there are few direct studies of GSK-3β and β-catenin in these illnesses. To further examine the role of Wnt signaling pathway in these disorders, we have determined that protein and gene expression of GSK-3β and β-catenin in three brain regions in the postmortem brain obtained from BP, SZ, and normal control (NC) subjects.\n\nMethods: The postmortem brain samples from 16 BP, 16 SZ, and 16 NC (known as the ‘McLean 66 cohort’) were obtained from the Harvard Brain Tissue Resource Center (HBTRC). The diagnosis of the subjects were made after retrospective review of all available medical records, and extensive questionnaires about social and medical history completed by family members of the donors, and a criteria of Feigner et al. (Diagnostic criteria for use in psychiatric research, Arch Gen Psychiatry, 26:57–63, 1972) was used for the diagnosis of SZ, and DSM-III-R10 for the diagnosis of BP disorders. The protein expression of GSK-3β, and pGSK-3β-ser-9 in the cytosol fraction, as well as the protein expression of β-catenin in the cytosol and nuclear fractions of the PFC, cingulate gyrus, and temporal cortex of the BP, SZ, and NC subjects was determined using the Western blot method. The mRNA expression GSK-3β and β-catenin in the PFC, cingulate gyrus and temporal cortex of these subjects was determined using real-time RT-polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).\n\nResults: Protein and mRNA expression of GSK-3β: We found that the protein expression of GSK-3β in the cytosol fraction was significantly decreased in the PFC and temporal cortex, but not in the cingulate gyrus of BP subjects compared with NC. GSK-3β protein expression was not significantly different in any of these brain areas of SZ subjects compared with NC subjects. As an index of GSK-3β activity, we determined the pGSK-3β-ser-9 protein expression. When we compared the protein expression of pGSK-3β-ser-9 between these groups, we found that it was significantly decreased in the PFC of BP subjects, but not significantly different in the cingulate gyrus or temporal cortex of BP compared with NC subjects. Protein expression of pGSK-3β-ser-9 was not significantly different in the schizophrenic subjects in any of these areas compared with NC subjects. When we compared the GSK-3β mRNA expression in BP illness and SZ, and found that it was significantly decreased only in the PFC of BP subjects compared with NC subjects. mRNA levels of GSK-3β in the PFC, cingulate gyrus, and temporal cortex in the SZ group were not significantly different from NC subjects. Protein and mRNA expression of â-catenin: Since β-catenin levels are regulated by the GSK-3β activity, we determined the protein expression of β-catenin in these three groups of subjects and found that the protein expression was significantly reduced in the cytosol and nuclear fractions of the PFC and temporal cortex, but not in the cingulate gyrus, of BP subjects compared with NC. On the other hand, we observed that the protein expression levels of β-catenin were significantly decreased in the cingulate gyrus, but were not significantly different in the PFC or the temporal cortex of SZ subjects. We also determined the levels of mRNA in BP, SZ, and NC subjects and found that the mRNA expression of β-catenin was significantly decreased in all three brain regions of the BP subjects compared with NC. However, β-catenin mRNA levels were not significantly different in any of the three brain areas of SZ subjects compared with NC.\n\nConclusions: These results suggest an alteration of Wnt signaling primarily in the postmortem brain of BP subjects. Whereas there appears to be a dysregulation of GSK-3β in BP illness, this dysregulation appears to be region-specific, such that a decrease in GSK-3β was observed only in the PFC and the temporal cortex. On the other hand, it appears that that the Wnt signaling pathway is disrupted in the cingulate gyrus, but not in the PFC or temporal cortex of SZ subjects. Overall these studies suggest region-specific alteration in Wnt signaling in BP illness and SZ.\n\nKeywords: bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, GSK-3β, β-catenin, postmortem brain\n\nDisclosures: G.

An Integrated -omics Approach to Understanding Psychoneuroimmunology Crosstalk\n\nAnil G. Jegga, Gayle Wittenberg, Xiang Yao, Lynn Yieh, Guang Chen*, Vaibhav Narayan\n\nJanssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson and Johnson, La Jolla, California\n\nBackground: Crosstalk between immune and neural function is an increasingly important area of study for depression. Although the growing number of publications on cytokines and depression during the last ten years indicate the importance of the psychoneuroimmunology crosstalk in mood disorders, the underlying gene regulatory and functional networks are relatively unexplored.\n\nMethods: We performed a systems biology-based integrative computational analysis to study the interactions between molecular components and to develop models for regulation and function of genes involved in mood disorders, and to identify potential candidates for drugs and drug repositioning. Specifically, we performed functional enrichment analyses on manually compiled comprehensive gene lists related to the immune system and major depressive disorder. We also performed network analyses to explore the topological characteristics of these genes in the context of the human protein interactome and gene coexpression and identified novel sub-networks with interconnected immune- and depression-associated genes.\n\nResults: Pathway enrichment analyses revealed that the prostaglandin and leukotriene metabolic pathways and angiotensin signaling pathways are important for genes that are both immune- and depression-associated. Although gene-wise there was not much overlap between the immune- and depression-related gene sets, there were several enriched pathways that were common to the immune-depression and immune gene sets including interleukin and cytokine signaling pathways, TCR signaling, and glypican network.\n\nConclusions: Our results indicate pathway-sharing and modularity between depression- and immune-associated genes. The shared pathways and interactions among these two categories of genes also suggests that drugs targeting these shared pathways and interaction modules can be potential drug repositioning candidates for relieving depressive symptoms.\n\nKeywords: depression, immunology, prostaglandin, cytokine, bioinformatics\n\nDisclosures: A.

Key Role of Decreased Vesicular Uptake in the Profound Myocardial Norepinephrine Depletion in Parkinson's Disease\n\nIrwin J. Kopin*, Patti Sullivan, David S. Goldstein\n\nNational Institute on Neurogical Disorders and Stroke, Bethesda, Maryland\n\nBackground: It is has become increasingly recognized that in Parkinson's disease (PD), in addition to loss nigrostriatal dopamine (DA) neurons, cardiac sympathetic neurons are also a target of the degenerative process. In the brain there is a discrepancy between the extent of loss of substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons (only about 60%) and the extent of decrease in putamen dopamine content (well over 90%), suggesting functional abnormality in the residual terminals. The same might apply in the heart. The present study was to determine whether neurochemical analysis of post-mortem myocardial tissue samples, along with previously published data about spillover of norepinephrine (NE) and its metabolites into cardiac venous plasma and about the disposition and metabolism of 3H-NE in healthy subjects, could be used to quantify differences between PD and controls in vesicular uptake and oxidative deamination of intra-neuronal catecholamines in myocardial sympathetic nerves.\n\nMethods: Most of the post-mortem left ventricular myocardial tissue samples from PD patients and controls were obtained from the Banner Sun Health Research Institute or autopsies at the NIH. We measured myocardial tissue contents of DA, NE, and their deaminated metabolites, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG). Frozen samples were homogenized in a mixture of 20:80 of 0.2 M phosphoric:0.2 M acetic acid and the supernate transferred to plastic cryotubes and stored at −80 °C until assayed by batch alumina extraction followed by liquid chromatography with series electrochemical detection. Based on a previous study from our laboratory (Eisenhofer et al, Circulation 1996; 93:1667–1676) that included estimates of the rates of transfer and metabolism of DA and NE in cardiac sympathetic nerves, we derived fractional rate constants and applied them to calculate rates for the processes involved in the synthesis and disposition of catecholamines in cardiac sympathetic nerves and evaluate determinants of myocardial NE depletion in PD.\n\nResults: We found a striking decrease in NE content of the heart tissue obtained from PD patients. The concentration of NE in myocardial tissue from 15 PD patients was only 2.5% that in tissue from 17 controls (0.0417±0.013 vs 1.664±0.289 pmol/mg wet weight). Interfering chromatographic peaks in 5 PD myocardial tissues limited to 9 the number of samples in which both NE and DHPG were measured. In those, the NE concentrations were even lower than in the whole group of PD samples (0.0270±0.0132 pmol/mg). The DHPG levels averaged 0.0095±0.0025 pmol/mg compared to 0.0960±0.0249 pmol/mg in controls. Thus, DHPG:NE ratios in PD were 6.1-fold greater in the PD than in control myocardial tissue. Ratios of DOPAC:NE in PD were 17 times and DOPAC:DHPG 3.7 times those in controls.\n\nConclusions: We used the equations that define the kinetics of vesicular uptake of DA and NE, NE leakage into the cytoplasm or reuptake after exocytotic release, metabolism of the cytoplasmic amines and the rate constants for the various processes to measure differences between PD and controls in these processes. The greater ratio of DHPG:NE in PD reflected a shift in the fate of cytoplasmic NE from vesicular uptake to deamination as well as the increase in NE turnover rate. Since almost all NE ffopmed in the sympathetic neurons is metabolized to DHPG, the rate of formation of DHPG, and its levels, should not be affected greatly by diminished VMAT. DHPG levels are a better index of NE formation than NE levels. The increase in the DHPG:NE ratio (474%) in PD is primarily due to a fall [n NE because of failure to recapture leaked NE, which is converted to DHPG. The much lower levels of DHPG in PD (13% of control) probably reflect decreased NE formation from DA and loss of sympathetic neurons. The 3.7-fold greater DOPAC:DHPG ratios in PD reflect decreased NE formation from DA and a shift in DA disposition from vesicular uptake to oxidative deamination. The DOPAC levels in PD averaged 43% those of controls, indicating a much higher level of DOPAC in residual sympathetic neurons in PD than in controls. The combined increase in NE turnover and decrease in NE formation (1/4.47 × 1/3.7=5.7%) accounts for the observed 94.3% fall in myocardial NE content. An estimated a 58% loss of neurons, close to that observed using neuronal markers, is necessary to account for the additional fall in NE levels to only 2.5% of control. In conclusion, the discrepancy between the loss neuronal markers of catecholaminergic neurons in the heart, and probably in the brain, is the result of a deficiency in vesicular uptake. There is a shift from vesicular storage to oxidative deamination. Because of the normal high efficiency of vesicular uptake, even a relatively small decrease in efficiency can produce large changes in formation of aldehydes. For example, a decrease from 92% to 84% efficiency will double the rate of oxidative deamination of catecholamines. Furthermore, since only the dihyroxyphenyacetaldehyde (DOPAL) from DA would be formed in excess, it is likely that this aldehyde would be the responsible agent for toxicity in both dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurons. Thus, vesicular uptake plays a key role in maintaining adequate reserves of myocardial sympathetic neuronal NE and perhaps in limiting formation of toxic aldehydes.\n\nKeywords: Norepinephrine, Dopamine, VMAT, myocardium, MAO\n\nDisclosures: I.

Chondroitin Sulfate Proteoglycan Abnormalities in Schizophrenic and Bipolar Disorder Subjects\n\nHarry Pantazopoulos*, Florian Jaquet, Doel Ghosh, Anna Wallin, Bruce Caterson, Sabina Berretta\n\nHarvard Medical School, Belmont, Massachusetts\n\nBackground: Increasing evidence points to the involvement of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) in schizophrenia (SZ). CSPGs are one of the main components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and are critically involved in processes that shape neural circuits, including migration of neurons and guidance of axons, trafficking of NMDA receptors, glial cell differentiation, and regulation of plasticity and neuronal firing properties, all relevant to the pathophysiology of SZ. Glial cells are main sources of ECM CSPGs. Notably, during late postnatal development, coinciding with the age of onset of SZ, they contribute to the assemblage of perineuronal nets (PNNs), specialized ECM aggregates enriched in CSPGs. Once formed, PNNs stabilize successful neural connections and modulate neuronal functions. In the medial temporal lobe of SZ subjects, we previously reported large increases of CSPG expressing glial cells accompanied by reductions of PNNs. Similar findings in the prefrontal cortex and olfactory epithelium suggest that CSPG abnormalities are widespread. Reported associations of genetic polymorphisms of CSPG genes including PTPRZ1, neurocan, and neuroglycan-C, along with animal studies showing the involvement of CSPGs and their sulfation patterns on brain development and adult functions, lend further support for their involvement in SZ. CSPGs are composed of core proteins with varying numbers of chondroitin sulfate (CS) chains. These chains vary in their patterns of sulfation, which modify their ability to interact with other molecules including growth factors and cytokines, and have significant effects on brain development and adult functions. The two most common sulfation patterns in the brain are 4-sulfation and 6-sulfation. The 4/6 ratio of sulfation is developmentally regulated and increases with the closure of critical periods and the formation of PNNs. The CSPG aggrecan is highly enriched in PNNs, and contains a high amount of CS chains with a predominant 6-sulfation pattern, suggesting that it may play an important role in PNN functions. Aggrecan expression and 6-sulfation in glial cells have been reported to regulate cell differentiation. With the present postmortem study, we tested the hypothesis that CS-6 sulfation patterns on various core proteins, as well as the core protein aggrecan, contribute to CSPG abnormalities in SZ.\n\nMethods: Antibodies raised against aggrecan (cat-301) and CSPGs containing CS-6 sulfation patterns (3B3 and CS56) were used to label immunohistochemically glial cells and PNNs in the amygdala of control (n=12), SZ (n=12), and BD (n=13) subjects. Numerical densities (Dn) and total numbers (N) of immunoreactive (IR) PNNs and glial cells were counted, blind to diagnosis, using computer-assisted light microscopy; group differences were tested using stepwise linear regression models.\n\nResults: In subjects with SZ, aggrecan-positive PNNs were decreased selectively in the lateral nucleus (LN) (N, p=0.03; Dn, p=0.03), where they were primarily located. PNNs labeled with 3B3 were distributed across all amygdala nuclei, and were significantly decreased in the amygdala (N, p=0.002; Dn, p=0.002). Decreases were significant for individual amygdala nuclei as well. Aggrecan-IR glial cells were decreased in the amygdala of SZs (N, p=0.02; Dn, p=0.07), along with 3B3-IR glia (N, p=0.005; Dn, p=0.007), and CS56-IR glia (N, p=0.02; Dn, p=0.03; corrected for effect of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)). In BD subjects, N but not Dn of aggrecan-IR PNNs were decreased in the LN (p=0.04); reductions of aggrecan-IR PNN N (p=0.04) and Dn (p=0.03) were also detected in the accessory basal nucleus. Decreases of 3B3-IR PNNs were also observed in the amygdala of BD subjects (N, p=0.01; Dn, p=0.02). In contrast to SZ subjects, no changes were observed in aggrecan-IR glial cells in BD. Decreases in 3B3-IR glia (N, p=0.04; Dn, p=0.04; corrected for effect of lithium), and CS56-IR glial (N, p=0.007, Dn, p=0.02; corrected for effect of lithium), where observed in BD.\n\nConclusions: Our results show aggrecan and CS-6 sulfation PNN and glial abnormalities in the amygdala of SZ and BD subjects. Decreases of glial cells expressing CS-6 sulfation patterns are in sharp contrast to large increases of glial cells labeled with a broad spectrum CSPG histochemical marker previously observed in SZs. These findings indicate that CSPG abnormalities are more widespread than initially thought and may affect distinct glial cell populations. Notably, differences between the two disorders were observed. In SZ, reductions of aggrecan and 3B3-IR PNNs in LN, together with previously reported decreases of WFA-positive PNNs in the same nucleus, suggest PNN loss. In BD, decreased aggrecan and 3B3-IR PNNs in absence of similar changes detected by WFA labeling suggests PNN composition anomalies. Decreases of glial cells expressing CS-6 in both SZ and BD indicate that 6-sulfation on these cells may differentially contribute to the changes in PNNs observed in these disorders. Significant statistical effects of SSRIs and lithium on CS56 measures indicates that CS56 changes may occur more prominently in subjects with affective symptoms, and may represent a potential therapeutic target. In SZ and BD, CSPG abnormalities may critically contribute to a disruption of developmental and adult neuronal functions such plasticity and oscillatory rhythms.\n\nKeywords: schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, perineuronal nets, amygdala, glial cells\n\nDisclosures: H.

CSF and Plasma Interleukin-6 and Personality Traits in Suicide Attempters\n\nJussi Jokinen*, Josef Isung, Shahin Aeinehband, Fariborz Mobarrez, Peter Nordström, Bo Runeson, Fredrik Piehl, Marie Åsberg\n\nKarolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden\n\nBackground: Dysregulation of inflammation has been reported in depression and recently in suicidal behavior. Impulsivity and aggression are part of the suicide phenotype. High levels of neuroticism, and low levels of conscientiousness assessed with structured personality inventories have previously been associated to increased levels of plasma IL-6, in population based samples.The aim of this study was to assess if plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of IL-6 were associated to personality traits in suicide attempters.\n\nMethods: Plasma and CSF levels of IL-6 were measured in suicide attempters (plasma=58, CSF=43) using antibody-based immunoassay systems. Personality domains were assessed using the Karolinska Scale of Personality (KSP). Regression models for the domains of personality were assessed in relation to cytokine levels in plasma and in CSF.\n\nResults: Plasma IL-6 was significantly positively correlated to the personality factor extraversion (r=0.48, p<0.0001) and the subscales impulsivity and monotony avoidance. The regression model remained significant after adjusting for age. CSF IL-6 was associated with monotony avoidance (r=0.35, p<0.05). Plasma and CSF levels of IL-6 were not significantly correlated.\n\nConclusions: The role of impulsive-aggressive behaviour in suicidality is recognized in several studies, and seems to play a role mostly among younger subjects with suicidal behaviour.The neuroinflammation hypothesis of suicidal behaviour may in part be explained by the positive association between IL-6 and impulsivity, a key part of the suicide phenotype.\n\nKeywords: IL-6, neuroinflammation, suicide attempt, impulsivity, monotony avoidance\n\nDisclosures: J.

Body Mass Index Affects Brain Dopaminergic Signaling after Glucose Ingestion\n\nGene-Jack Wang*, Nora D. Volkow, Dardo Tomasi, Antonio Convit, Christopher Wong, Elena Shumay, Joanna Fowler\n\nStony Brook University Upton, New York\n\nBackground: Excessive consumption of of palatable food can lead to obesity, which, in turn, can result in metabolic adaptations perpetuating excessive food consumption. The rewarding effects of food are mediated by its palatability and its energy content. Indeed, gastric administration of sugar or fat increases dopamine (DA) in the striatum (including the nucleus accumbens) can result in overeating because of adaptation to the exposure to high caloric intake. Here we tested the hypothesis that in obese individuals the DA response to calorie intake (independent of its palatability) might be attenuated. We used PET to assess the effects of body mass index (BMI) on brain DA function, contrasting the effects of sucralose (artificial sweetener devoid of calories) to that of glucose to control for the somatosensory stimulation of sweet receptors.\n\nMethods: Nineteen healthy subjects with BMI from 21 to 35 were scanned with [C-11]raclopride after oral ingestion of glucose- and sucralose drinks. Striatal DA D2 receptor availability (DRD2) was analyzed with SPM8 after transforming the voxels in PET images into non-displaceable binding potential (BPND). The differences between DRD2 availability after the glucose and the sucralose intake (delta BPND) were used to estimate DA changes secondary to calorie content of glucose. Statistical significance of the voxelwise correlation analyses between BMI and delta BPND (glucose minus sucralose) was set as PFWE < 0.05, accounting for multiple comparisons with familywise error and small volume (10-mm radius spherical volume) corrections. Pearson correlations were used to evaluate potential linear associations between differences in DRD2 availability (delta BPND) measured after glucose- and sucralose challenges and the behavioral measu"
