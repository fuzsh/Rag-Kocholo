        "text": "Research Interests: Applied Mathematics, Bioinformatics, Control Theory, Geometry, and Mathematical Biology\n\nBijoy K. Ghosh received the B.Tech. and M.Tech. degrees in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from BITS, Pilani, and the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, India, and the Ph.D. degree in Applied Mathematics from the Decision and Control Group of the Division of Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, in 1977, 1979, and 1983, respectively. From 1983 to 2006, he has been a faculty member in the Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, Washington University, St. Louis, MO, as a professor, and directed the center for BioCybernetics and Intelligent Systems. Presently he is a Dick and Martha Brooks Endowed Professor in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX. Bijoy received the American Automatic Control Council's Donald Eckman Award in 1988 in recognition of his outstanding contributions in the field of Automatic Control. He received the United Nations Development Program Consultancy in India under the TOKTEN program in 1993, the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science invitation fellowship for research in Japan in 1997. In the year 2000, he became a Fellow of the Institute of Electronics and Electrical Engineering for fundamental contributions to System Theory with applications to robust control, vision and multi sensor fusion.Bijoy is a member of the editorial board of The IEEE Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics. He has held visiting academic positions at the Yale University, USA; Universita di Padova, Italy; Institut Mittag-Leffler and Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden; Tokyo Institute of Technology and Osaka University, Japan. He is a permanent visiting professor at the Tokyo Denki University, Saitama, Japan and Technical University of Munich, Germany.\n\nResearch Interests: Algebra\n\nLars Winther Christensen graduated from the University of Copenhagen in 1995 and obtained his Ph.D. from the same institution in 1999. After this he worked with telecommunications and crypto software development. In 2004 Lars went to University of Nebraska as visiting professor, and in 2007 he joined Texas Tech University. Lars' research is in algebra; his interests focus on applications of homological and homotopical algebra to ring theory.
