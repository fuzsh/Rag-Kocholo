        "text": "Our thoracic oncology surgeons are national leaders in minimally invasive surgical procedures. We perform more than 1,600 minimally invasive surgeries every year on all types and stages of lung cancer. As a result, patients experience less post-operative pain and recover faster.\n\nOur radiation oncologists have access to specialized techniques, such as stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for early-stage lung cancer and radiation treatment planning aided by four-dimensional computed tomography (4D CT).\n\nOur board-certified lung imaging specialists undergo advanced training in the early detection of lung cancer.\n\nAn important research strategy is the study of how individual genes affect oncogenesis and tumor progress. In the laboratory, some investigators are studying mouse models to determine the role of stem cells in the development of cancer in humans and in the development of resistance to treatment.\n\nClinically, researchers hope to discover how to use unique genetic mutations to personalize treatment and are looking at subgroups of patients to see how they respond to treatment.\n\nSeveral studies are also ongoing utilizing a large tissue bank and database of patients treated for lung cancer at Duke University since 1995.\n\nFor example, some researchers are studying epidemiological factors related to lung cancer — why certain patient groups respond to treatment better than others.\n\nIn addition, other researchers are examining the role of age, gender, minimally invasive surgery, and other patient-specific factors in outcomes, including quality of life.\n\nLung cancer clinical research at Duke has focused on biomarker discovery and development —the use of molecular signatures to improve the assessment of prognosis and the development of specific new therapies.\n\nThe formation of the program has allowed for the optimal collaboration of the best basic science underway on the Duke campus with ongoing clinical and translational lung cancer research programs.\n\nOur medical oncologists have developed several drugs that have received FDA approval. These drugs help improve patient outcomes."
