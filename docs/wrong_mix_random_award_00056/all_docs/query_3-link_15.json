        "text": "The essays gathered here all concern the history, reception, and circulation of various versions of the Jewish ‘Life of Jesus’ (or Toledot Yeshu) in the early modern period (sixteenth to eighteenth century). Toledot Yeshu is perhaps the most infamous retelling of the gospel narrative of the premodern era. The story is best described as a parody of the Gospels, or perhaps an ‘anti- gospel,’ in which the foundational narrative and basic tenets of Christianity become an opportunity for ridicule and laughter. Jesus himself, whose purportedly shameful origins are narrated in detail, is thus railed as an antihero, a disgruntled student of the rabbis who sought to gain recognition by performing magic and duping the crowds, claiming to be the Messiah foretold by the prophets, but ultimately unable to save himself. The essays gathered in this thematic section of Cromohs are devoted to the early modern contexts of Toledot Yeshu, a period characterised by the dissemination of new versions of the narrative, increased circulation of manuscripts, translations into vernacular languages, and renewed interest—both on the Jewish and on the Christian side—in polemical and apologetic writings.\n\nToledot Yeshu (The Jewish Life of Jesus) is perhaps one of the most infamous retellings of the Gospel narrative of the pre-modern era. The present essay explores its reception and circulation among both Jews and Christians in the period before and after the first editions of the work, by J. C. Wagenseil in 1681 and J. J. Huldreich in 1705. The work was an object of fascination for early modern scholars of Judaism and was regularly invoked in discussions concerned with the Talmud and other Jewish books alleged to be blasphemous. For Jewish scholars, it was a source of embarrassment, although both the manuscript and the documentary evidence demonstrate that many Jews did view Toledot Yeshu as a culturally significant narrative, worthy of being transmitted. It is here suggested that Toledot Yeshu, with its direct and emotional cogency, combining history, humour and polemics, was indeed recognized by early modern Jews and crypto-Jews as a powerful story, through which they could articulate their identity.\n\nTraces of “Sefer Toledot Yeshu” in modern narratives “Sefer Toledot Yeshu” (Toledot Yeshu), a Jewish counter-narrative (c.f., Ahuvia 2014), representing a pejorative take on the birth of Jesus, has circulated within the Jewish Diaspora since the Middle Ages, and also could be found in the Talmudic texts. We have identified several narrative elements pertaining to a Toledot Yeshu group of texts in a variety of modern contexts, such as field work conducted within the community of Judizers, in the Israeli Folklore Archive (IFA) records, personal interviews, Jewish and Christian jokes, and even cinema (c.f., a movie “Jesus of Montreal” by Denys Arcand, Monty Python’s “Life of Brian”, a recent controversial movie “Ils sont partout” produced by Yvan Attal, a French-Jewish director born to Algerian parents). Further examination of the various ways of narrative transmission and the traces of Toledot Yeshu suggests that comparative method of folklore and narrative scheme extraction methods may provide an invaluable insight for studying a wide range of modern narratives pertaining to a Jewish tradition, such as personal stories, movies and jokes. Stories about Jesus’s obscure origins were part of the Jewish folklore, and the parody aspect found in the early Jewish texts ascribing illegitimate birth is well preserved in a variety of modern narratives as mockery on neighbours and their beliefs. As such, in a Jewish context they represent a self-defence strategy in reaction to the hostile environment and Anti-Semitism. The presented research is innovative, because a comparative method of folklore in combination with modern narratology methods (c.f., Erllpp 2009) allows for extracting isolated narrative elements/blocks from a hypothetically reconstructed full text. To the best of our knowledge a systematic comparative study of the modern circulation of the Toledot Yeshu has not been conducted yet, but our data unambiguously indicate that from time to time the remnants (narrative blocks) of the whole Toledot Yeshu narrative re-emerge in unrelated (Jewish and non-Jewish) narratives and contexts until our time (for example, numerous other parallels can be found elsewhere in the satirical religious sketches such as “The Amazing Jesus and Trixy (Jesus Magician) by the British actor Rowan Atkinson). It is our belief that the motivation for the re-emergence of the studied narrative blocks is ideological and must be examined in its historical, cultural and ideological context.\n\nThis book provides the first-ever examination of the Judeo-Arabic versions of Toledot Yeshu (TY), the notorious parody of the life of Jesus originating in Late Antiquity, as well as a full edition and translation of Judeo-Arabic TY texts from their earliest fragmentary witnesses through their early modern copies. The author illuminates the historical and literary development of the Judeo-Arabic TY texts, retelling the story of this long-lived polemical narrative with the critical inclusion of this significant Judeo-Arabic material. Goldstein considers the function of the narrative in the religiously diverse Arabic-speaking milieu and traces the existence of TY in a variety of languages in later Jewish Near Eastern story collections. In this study, the author transforms historical understandings of Toledot Yeshu and of the Near Eastern communities who read and transmitted the narrative.\n\nA first-time presentation of the initial section of the Toledot Yeshu (TY) narrative describing the birth and early life of Jesus in Judeo-Arabic. The dating and origin of the birth narrative in TY has been debated in recent scholarship on the Hebrew versions of TY, and the identification of this lengthy Judeo-Arabic birth narrative as well as a number of earlier Judeo-Arabic manuscript fragments demonstrates that the birth narrative formed part of TY significantly earlier than previously thought. Furthermore, examination of this early Judeo-Arabic textual tradition reveals interesting connections with particular Hebrew versions of TY from Europe and can shed light on the question of how the work moved between East and West. Finally, this Judeo-Arabic version of TY demonstrates a clever literary adaptation to its Arabic-Islamic linguistic and cultural surroundings."
