This year, we at Liquidware, are proclaiming “Its the year of INDEPENDENT VDI!” An idea which, quite frankly, is overdue.\n\nIn the history of VDI, the most meaningful insights and developments did not come from the platform vendors but from the ecosystem of users and partners around the platforms. Today, Liquidware is proud to announce that we are the Founding Partner of the World of End User Computing (WEUC) community. The WEUC is a community of seasoned veterans of the EUC ecosystem who are looking to provide end users with opportunities for networking and sharing knowledge without the restraints of vendor bias.\n\nIt’s Time for Free-Flowing Independent Unbiased EUC Dialog\n\nWe agree with the founders of WEUC that the time has come. Check out the WEUC board – you will see some very familiar and popular faces there, who have contributed to the EUC knowledge base for decades.\n\nThe WEUC is managed by Engage Strategies. For those of you who are not familiar with Engage, they are the organization that breathed new life into the CUGC starting in 2015. Liquidware was among the first to sign up with them at that time, and we have a strong respect for their professionalism and dedication to the success of the WEUC.\n\nWhy is Liquidware Sponsoring the WEUC?\n\nSo, what makes the WEUC a great idea now and why is Liquidware on board?\n\nThe best answer for that question requires me to trace the history of Liquidware, which closely parallels key developments in EUC for over the past 15 years. Below is a picture which is worth 10,000 words and will shorten this blog post.\n\nLiquidware was born in 2009, and we have seen it all in the EUC ecosystem. When VDI launched, the vision was that virtual machines would just replace physical machines. You could much more easily provision and set up a virtual machine. These VMs would be “persistent” or “stateful” desktops. And guess what? All the stuff that users typically would cram into a physical desktop, they could now cram into a virtual machine. Which led to the same problems that physical desktops posed – only worse.\n\nKeeping Pace with all the EUC Developments Over the Past 15 Years\n\nThe second iteration was “non-persistent” or “stateless” desktops. These were pools of virtual machines that were one-size-fits-all clones. The advantage was that you could wipe out all the user touches at logoff. Then you could provision brand new “clean” machines. This had benefits for security and management, but users lost all their ability to personalize their workspaces. There was an outcry!!\n\nSo, in the early stages of EUC, we at Liquidware figured out two things. The first was that it would be very easy to lose visibility into all the workloads on VDI because you would lose the mapping of one device/one desktop/one user. VDI workspaces shared a common infrastructure. So, you couldn’t troubleshoot effectively, and you could forget about optimization. We launched Stratusphere UX which provided detailed historical desktop data which constructed a user experience score that would indicate how your desktops were performing. You could also use this data forensically to figure out the source of your issues.\n\nOn the heels of Stratusphere UX, we launched ProfileUnity to allow you to virtualize user profiles and add them back to a non-persistent VM. This solution provided and maintained a universal user profile that saved all the customizations users needed. ProfileUnity profiles transcended OS versions and platforms.\n\nIn 2013 we launched a new solution called FlexApp that essentially did for applications, what ProfileUnity did for user profiles. Packaged them, took them out of the master image and allowed you to provision them as needed on demand.\n\nMost recently, we launched CommandCTRL, which is a real-time monitoring solution. With this solution, as soon as you can see the problem, you can fix it.\n\nEvery product that we launched was in keeping with new developments in the industry and new concepts that were springing up. Just as important, we kept up with significant vendors, including Dizzion, Amazon and Microsoft, who joined VMware and Citrix in the EUC space.\n\nFor the past 15 years, Liquidware stayed platform-agnostic while we watched these developments and enhanced our offerings to fill in the gaps left by these providers. And the big ever-repeated lesson we learned was that none of the leading providers had the 100% solution stack for all users. Most organizations ended up running hybrid environments combining vendors’ technologies to get the best result for their users and the applications they were running.\n\nDo Yourself the Biggest Favor Today — Join the WEUC\n\nSo, the question you must ask yourself is: Am I going to get this perspective about best-of-breed hybrid architecture from any of the leading EUC vendors? Better yet, ask me and I will tell you: No, you’re not.\n\nWhich is why the time is right for the WEUC. Finally, we have a forum where you can mingle and converse with others who are living in the same world you are and have the same challenges. The WEUC is the place to get the latest insights and the unbiased, best practices knowledge and all the shortcuts that get you to the right place.\n\nAs usual, we have seen the future of EUC and the WEUC is it. Please do yourself a favor and check them out today.\n\nThe recent availability of Microsoft Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) on Azure Stack has opened up a whole new realm of possibilities for organizations seeking a hybrid approach to virtual desktops and applications. As we have seen organizations are hesitant about putting all their resources in Cloud and want to be able to use both cloud and on-prem and the introduction of AVD on Azure Stack increases the options available.\n\nSee the announcement\n\nSo, why is this an important development in EUC? Let’s delve into the core advantages of AVD on Azure Stack.\n\nFirst customers who may have kept workloads on-prem now have the choice to utilize AVD On-Prem.\n\nSecondly consider reduced latency — a crucial factor in today’s fast-paced digital world. By positioning desktops closer to your workforce, AVD on Azure Stack promises a more responsive and fluid experience, particularly for those resource-hungry applications.\n\nNext, there’s enhanced security and compliance. For businesses grappling with stringent data residency requirements, AVD provides a robust security framework while enabling you to keep your sensitive data on-premises.\n\nLastly, the unified management experience through the Azure portal is a game-changer. It marks the end of juggling multiple cloud and on-premises solutions, paving the way for streamlined, efficient operations.\n\nBut What Does It Mean for the Platform Vendors, Such as Citrix and VMware?\n\nWhile AVD on Azure Stack presents a new opportunity in the virtual desktop space, it also signals a pivotal moment for established platforms like Citrix and VMware. With their extensive ecosystems and broad feature sets, these veterans are now at a crossroads. How might they respond?\n\nFirstly it should be stated that this is an opportunity for both given they already support Azure Stack and with their advanced functionalities such as their advanced protocols HDX and Blast they can enhance any deployment of AVD on Azure Stack.\n\nThe availability of AVD on Azure Stack could potentially disrupt the VDI market and impact Citrix and VMware. However, it is too early to know the exact impact and it will depend on various factors, including pricing, how well Microsoft executes its strategy, the response from Citrix and VMware, and how customers react to these changes\n\nRead more: A new player enters the hybrid world : AVD on Azure Stack HCI\n\nWhat is the Role of Liquidware Solutions in Successful Hybrid AVD Deployments?\n\nLiquidware is a Microsoft AVD alliance partner, we offer solutions that support any Windows workspace, whether physical or in the cloud.
