No permeability surface abnormality was found.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: CTP-derived subcortical white matter CBF is independently associated with white matter disease severity.\n\nWhite matter changes are frequent in patients with vascular risk factors, cerebrovascular disease, and cognitive impairment.1 The pathogenesis is poorly understood. Various histopathologic correlates have been described, including loss of ependyma with gliosis, glial swelling, demyelination, dilated perivascular spaces, lacunar infarcts, spongiosis, arteriolar hyalinosis, amyloid angiopathy, and cyst formation.2–4 A vascular etiology is strongly suggested, given the frequent association with increasing age, hypertension, stroke, and markers of cellular ischemia, including hypoxia inducible factor, neuroglobulin, and matrix metalloproteinase protein MMP7.5–7 Other associations include arteriosclerosis,8 impaired cerebral autoregulation, hypoperfusion, CSF flow disturbances, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption.7,9\n\nSeveral validated white matter rating scales allow visual quantification of disease burden on CT or MR imaging. The age-related white matter change (ARWMC) scale can be applied to both CT and MR imaging changes and has been recommended in an attempt to standardize nomenclature in vascular cognitive impairment imaging.10 White matter lesion visualization is, however, reduced on CT compared with MR imaging. Additionally, visual rating score performances are imperfect and are limited by a ceiling effect. The wide variation in lesion extent with high visual scores results in a lower correlation with clinical symptoms. Whether techniques that provide estimation of white matter hemodynamic parameters independent of CT or MR imaging lesion visualization would better assess severity is unknown but potentially may circumvent these problems.\n\nCerebral blood flow (CBF) abnormalities were previously demonstrated in white matter disease by xenon CT (Xe-CT),11 positron-emission tomography (PET),12 and MR imaging.13,14 Correlation of XeCT and single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) hypoperfusion with leukoaraiosis severity was previously described.11,15 Recent data suggest that hemodynamic alterations precede white matter change.16 An association between BBB dysfunction, increasing age, dementia, and white matter disease is suggested, with parenchymal gadolinium-diethylene-triamine pentaacetic acid leakage shown in elderly patients with diabetes.17 Furthermore, microvascular changes, BBB dysfunction, and microglial and astroglial cell activation are reported in primates with cognitive decline.18 Progress in cross-sectional CT imaging technology allows quantification of absolute cerebral hemodynamic parameters with greater resolution than MR imaging or SPECT-based techniques. CT perfusion (CTP) is cheaper, faster, and more widely available than MR imaging, SPECT, or Xe-CT techniques. CTP is widely used in the evaluation of patients with stroke, but no previous study has examined the relationship between CTP-derived hemodynamic variables and white matter disease severity. The purpose of this study was to test the ability of CTP-derived hemodynamic parameters, including CBF, cerebral blood volume (CBV), mean transit time (MTT), and BBB permeability surface product to quantify white matter disease severity. Our hypothesis was that CTP-derived hemodynamic parameters and, in particular, CBF correlate with and may be used to quantify white matter disease severity. Furthermore, we hypothesized that permeability surface is expected to increase with greater white matter disease severity.\n\nResults\n\nThirty-five patients (mean age, 66 ± 15.7 years) were analyzed (20 men and 15 women). The median ARWMC MR imaging score was 5 (interquartile range [IQR], 2–8). Median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score at presentation was 5 (IQR, 2–8) and at discharge, 0.5 (IQR, 0–2). The Spearman correlation between MR imaging score CBF, CBV, MTT, and permeability surface in white matter regions of interest and gray matter is presented in Table 2. There was significant inverse correlation between the ARWMC MR imaging score and periventricular CBF (r = −0.55, P < .01), subcortical CBF (r = −0.50, P < .01), average white matter CBF (r = −0.55, P < .01), and GM CBF (r = −0.43, P < .01). A positive correlation was shown between the ARWMC MR imaging score and periventricular MTT (r = 0.45, P < .01), subcortical MTT (r = 0.43, P < .01), and gray matter MTT (r = 0.37, P = .03). No correlation between the ARWMC score, permeability surface product, or CBV was found.\n\nThere were 26 patients with WMm and 9 patients with WMms. Table 3 shows median ARWMC MR imaging scores in each group. No significant differences in intergroup baseline demographic characteristics, including cardiovascular risk factors, were present, apart from age. Older patients were more likely to have WMms disease than younger patients (P = .02). Hemodynamic differences are given in Table 4. All CBF variables, periventricular white matter, and average white matter CBV were significantly lower in the WMms versus WMm group. Other CTP variables did not differentiate between the 2 groups. Hemodynamic differences between periventricular and subcortical locations were not demonstrated.\n\nUnivariate logistic regression analysis, adjusting for age, revealed that white matter severity was significantly associated with CBF in the subcortical white matter (P = .03) and average white matter (P = .03) and a trend toward periventricular white matter (P = .05) (Table 5). Periventricular blood volume (P = .03) and average white matter CBV (P = .03) were also significant predictors of white matter severity, but age remained a significant confounder.\n\nStepwise multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated a significant negative association between subcortical CBF and white matter disease probability (P = .03, OR = 0.635). A subcortical white matter CBF threshold of ≤11.9 mL/100 g/min demonstrated an area under the ROC curve, sensitivity, specificity, and positive likelihood ratio of 0.82, 89% (52%–98%), 77% (56%–91%), and 3.9, respectively. To illustrate the effects of age and subcortical CBF on the probability of developing positive white matter, we considered 2 patients 65 and 70 years of age. The probability of WMms disease increased from 40% to 52% when age increased from 65 to 70 years with a subcortical CBF ≤11.9 mL/100 g/min. The same patients with subcortical CBF of >11.9 had a risk of 2.4% and 3.8%, respectively. This finding confirms that subcortical CBF has much more effect on the probability of positive white matter than age.\n\nConclusions\n\nThere is a fair correlation between subcortical CBF assessment and white matter disease severity. Subcortical white matter CBF is independently associated with white matter disease severity. Whether CTP has a role in the longitudinal assessment of white matter patients or as a surrogate marker of response to drug interventions remains to be determined. We hope to assess these parameters in prospectively acquired patient cohorts and correlate findings with neurocognitive outcome in addition to imaging-based white matter scores.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank Mr. Kenny Wong and Ms. Madison Martin for their editorial assistance.
