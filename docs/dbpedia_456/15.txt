Real Madrid boast a raft of promising youngsters who are either starring for the club’s youth sides or getting first-team experience out on loan.

For example, Iker Bravo and Álvaro Ginés were included on the Guardian’s list of the world’s most exciting players born in 2005.

Bravo is a 6ft tall striker who has four goals and three assists this term for Castilla, Madrid’s ‘B’ team. He could graduate to the seniors next year.

The 18-year-old is a powerful, two-footed player who’s adept at holding off his marker and getting himself into shooting positions.

Ginés, 17, is less well-known. He plays at No.10 or up front for the U18s, and has a real eye for goal. He’s earning glowing scouting reports.

Sergio Arribas, 21, is one of the best players in Spain’s third tier. He’s excelled for Castilla for a while, but is struggling for first-team chances.

He’s an attacking midfielder who has bags of quality and chips in with plenty of goals. This season, he has nine in 20 games - plus six assists.

Right winger Peter Federico, 20, has played three times for the first team. Quick and skilful, he has a goal and four assists for Castilla this term.

Brahim Díaz, 23, is due to return from a loan spell at AC Milan in the summer. He could be a good young option to have in the top squad.

Antonio Blanco, 22, and Reinier Jesus, 21, are two more players who have gone out on loan to get regular first-team football.

If Toni Kroos and Luka Modric retire, midfielder Blanco could secure a place in the Madrid squad next season. As a winger, Reinier faces a tougher task.

Takefusa Kubo is a player Madrid have sold - but with a buy-back option. The Japan international is impressing for Real Sociedad this season.
