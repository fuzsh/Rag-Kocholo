        "text": "Following the article on the current whereabouts of the 50 most promising players of La Masia at the beginning of the decade, it is worth wondering what's happened in the other great academy of Spanish football, that of Real Madrid.\n\nThese are the players of promise at Valdebebas, who a few years ago had the world at their feet, and who've now trodden some very diverse paths.\n\nThe selection looks at youth players who were at the club in 2011, from the cadet age group (born in 1996) to the second team.\n\nTomas Mejias (Middlesbrough, England, 31, goalkeeper)\n\nMejias debuted in the 2010/11 season under Jose Mourinho, replacing Antonio Adan against Getafe in what would be his only game for the first team. He then returned to Castilla, before joining Middlesbrough in 2014. After a brief stint at Rayo Vallecano, he decided to embark on another adventure outside Spanish football, specifically at Omonia Nicosia in Cyprus before returning Middlesbrough.\n\nJesus Fernandez (Panathinaikos, Greece, 31, goalkeeper)\n\nHe was the goalkeeper of the best Castilla in recent times. He debuted with the first team in 2010/11, against Almeria, and then had his chance as third goalkeeper. He has a Champions League, the 10th, on his record, but after leaving Real he hasn't had any luck. Levante, Granada, Cadiz and Cultural were his homes before he decided to travel to Romania to play for Cluj. This winter he left to join Panathinaikos in Greece.\n\nFernando Pacheco (Alaves, 27, goalkeeper)\n\nAnother representative of the large group of goalkeepers from La Fabrica. Pacheco debuted with the first team against Ponferradina in 11/12, and was the starting keeper during the second season of Castilla in the Segunda. After a year in the first team, he understood that he needed minutes and found them at Alaves. He's a regular at the Estadio Mendizorroza and could be considered for the national team in future thanks to his performances.\n\nAlfonso Herrero (Real Oviedo, 25, goalkeeper)\n\nHerrero was part of the team that included Mariano, Medran and Melero. After two years with hardly any participation for Castilla, under the orders of Zidane first and Ramis later, he packed his bags for Oviedo, where he became the starter.\n\nDani Carvajal (Real Madrid, 28, right-back)\n\nThe child who laid the first stone at Valdebebas has become the undisputed owner of the right-back slot at Real Madrid. A story of effort and talent that is almost truncated by a Mourinho who didn't want to give him any opportunity with the first team, to the point of forcing Carvajal to go to Bayer Leverkusen so as not to stagnate in his growth. In the first year without Mourinho, Real Madrid won the Champions League with Carvajal in the starting line-up in Lisbon.\n\nDerik Osede (Numancia, 27, central defender)\n\nA regular in the lower categories of the national team that was European champion at U19 and U20 levels, he spent 13 years in La Fabrica. After two seasons and 51 games with Castilla, and even a debut in the Santiago Bernabeu Trophy, Derik went to England and spent three seasons at Bolton Wanderers. He was without a team for a few months until Numancia came knocking.\n\nIvan Saez (Retired, 25, central defender)\n\nIvan Saez was the culprit of that famous non-aggression pact between Real Madrid and Atletico that reignited tensions again with Theo Hernandez. As a youngster, he decided to leave Atletico and join Real, which caused huge anger at the club. He was an international in the U17, U18 and U19 sides, played the first Final Four of the Youth League and trained with Real Madrid's first team. However, his progression was cut short, and, after a season with Real Madrid C in the Tercera Division, he decided to hang up his boots in 2015.\n\nJaime Sanchez (Valladolid Promesas, 25 years old, central defender)\n\nChampion of the Youth Copa del Rey in 2013 with Raul de Tomas and Marcos Llorente, and the Champions Cup of the same category in 2014. He was an undisputed centre-back in the lower categories and who defended the Spain U19 shirt, but he stalled at Castilla. Injuries stopped him playing for more than two years and have hampered his growth. He spent a few years at Castilla but now he's an important figure at Valladolid Promesas.\n\nNacho Fernandez (Real Madrid, 30, central defender)\n\nSurely the model canterano. Four times champion of Europe and an international. Captain of Castilla and a true centre-back despite Mourinho only seeing him as a full-back in the first team. Growing year after year and a key player for Real Madrid and the national team.\n\nDani Suarez (Asteras Tripoli, Greece, 29, central defender)\n\nForceful and powerful, he's the brother of Carlos Suarez, the basketball player. He came to Madrid C in 2010, from Aranjuez, and didn't get beyond the Segunda B division, where he played with Castilla. After five years, he went to Ponferradina, but didn't have the expected participation and found an escape in Poland. After enjoying a spell as a regular starter for Gornik Zabrze, he set off to Greece for Asteras Tripoli.\n\nJose Leon (Fuenlabrada, 25, central defender)\n\nLeon arrived at Valdebebas in the summer of 2004 and was promoted to Castilla. In the 2016/17 season he played at Cultural Leonesa, but snapped his cruciate ligament and spent almost a year without playing. After one more season at the academy, he managed to debut in a friendly match against Juventus before heading to join Rayo Vallecano but he has since joined Fuenlabrada.\n\nMario Hermoso (Atletico Madrid, 24, central defender)\n\nHe has become one of the most promising youngsters. Left-footed and ready for a national team call-up, this Madrid native started playing as a winger. Mourinho gave him his debut in a Bernabeu Trophy game against Millonarios. In 2015/16 he was transferred to Valladolid where he played 31 games. He returned to Castilla, where he was captain in 16/17, before leaving for Espanyol. Real Madrid were expected to bring him back, but Atletico swooped in for him last summer.\n\nDiego Llorente (Real Sociedad, 26, central defender)\n\nHe always had leadership qualities, but he was slow to blossom. He debuted with Castilla and even played in the first team during 2012/13. Mourinho loved him. At the end of the 2014/15 campaign, he was transferred to Rayo, where he stood out. He wasn't better in his second loan at Malaga, but Real Sociedad signed him for 8m euros last summer. Luis Enrique has him on his preferred list of potential players for La Roja.\n\nFran Rodriguez (Rayo Majadahonda, 24, right-back)\n\nA right-back whose golazos from long distance are still remembered in Valdebebas. After two seasons in Castilla, he went to Zaragoza (2016/17). He joined Almeria, where he was a regular starter until he snapped his cruciate ligament in April. He has since returned to action and joined Rayo Majadahonda.\n\nJorge Casado (Xanthi, Greece, 30, left-back)\n\nCasado replicated on the left side of Castilla what Carvajal did on the right. For a long time they were the best wing-backs at the academy. He played for two seasons before joining Betis, Ponferradina and Zaragoza prior to his move to international football. Now established at Xanthi in Greece, he's a fixture on the left-hand side.\n\nSergio Reguilon (Sevilla, 23, left-back)\n\nAnother good example of a youth player, he entered the club in the U7 category and has passed through all the teams in La Fabrica. Two transfers to Logrones served him to grow and return as captain to Castilla, completing his last stretch of training before making the jump to Julen Lopetegui's first team. Now with Zinedine Zidane back in charge, though, he's been loaned out to Sevilla.\n\nJavi Garcia-Noblejas (NAC Breda, 26, left-back)\n\nA left-sided player who is still looking for a settled place since leaving Real Madrid. When in Los Blancos' youth set-up, he managed to reach Castilla, where he was first choice in his last season in Valdebebas. After leaving, he made his debut in the Primera and the Copa del Rey with Getafe, but he was unable to hold down a place and moved to Elche, Albacete and Cordoba, where the same fate awaited. He spent time at Sporting, but now plays in the Netherlands with NAC Breda.\n\nGonzalo Melero (Levante, 26, midfielder)\n\nA clear case that a player's career doesn't end after leaving Real Madrid. Melero spent his entire career moving through the Los Blancos ranks, until reaching the C team. After just six matches for Castilla, only two as a starter, he decided to leave and joined Ponferradina where his new path to success began. From Ponfe, he went to Huesca and scored 16 goals in the Segunda Division as they won promotion to LaLiga. Villarreal signed him, but now he's ended up at Levante where injuries have gotten in the way.\n\nAlex Fernandez (Cadiz, 27, midfielder)\n\nThe brother of Nacho Fernandez was, in March 2011, the first of the pair to officially debut with the Real Madrid first team. He was a key midfielder in the Juvenil de Toril 2010 and helped Castilla get to the Segunda, although he finished the season as a substitute. He left Real Madrid after deciding not to renew his contract, and joined Espanyol. After one season of few opportunities he moved to Rijeka and then Reading, before settling in Elche. Now at Cadiz, he is rolling back the years and is a key player at the Estadio Carranza.\n\nOmar Mascarell (Schalke, Germany, 27, midfielder)\n\nHe moved to Real Madrid in 2010, with Barcelona also after his signature. He was soon promoted to Castilla in 2011/12 and that year he also spent time with the C team in order to get some playing time. He had two years in the Segunda, although he was alternating between the two youth sides initially. He made his first team debut under Jose Mourinho. Then, in 2014/15, he moved to Derby County in the English Championship, before joining Sporting. After two years with Eintracht Frankfurt he made the leap to Schalke, and is now playing top-level European football.\n\nLucas Vazquez (Real Madrid, 28, right forward)\n\nAnother example of tenacity and perseverance despite a number of obstacles. From the Juvenil de Toril in 2010 he moved to the C team instead of Castilla in order to toughen up. Then made the move to Castilla and he became more and more important to the team, before he became the key man in his third season. From there, he moved to Espanyol to debut in the top tier, and where his performances persuaded Real Madrid to bring him home. Three Champions Leagues later, he continues to be important for the team.\n\nMohamed Kamal (Calahorra, 28, midfielder)\n\nKamal was promoted through the lower categories until reaching the C team, but since he left Real Madrid things haven't been plain sailing. He has played for Huracan Valencia, Cultural Leonesa, Racing, Mensajero, Villanovense, Badajoz and this season joined Calahorra. In this last season with Real Madrid he had competition from the likes of Burgui, Sobrino, Diego Llorente and Mascarell.\n\nCristian Benavente (Nantes, France, 24, midfielder)\n\nA Peruvian international, Benavente dazzled in the lower categories at Real Madrid. Mourinho invited him to train with the first team on a number of occasions, but he never made his debut for them. With no chance of a breakthrough, he moved to MK Dons in England, before joining Belgian side Charleroi, where he has become a key player. He's now at Nantes.\n\nJose Rodriguez (Fuenlabrada, 25, midfielder)\n\nOn December 4, 2012, Jose Rodriguez became the youngest player to debut in the Champions League for Real Madrid when he came on against Ajax at 17 years and 354 days old. It was the last match of the group stage and Madrid won 4-1. That year he also scored against Alcoyano and even played a derby against Atletico Madrid. He has become something of a globetrotter since his departure from the club, playing for Deportivo, Galatasaray, Mainz, Malaga, Maccabi Tel Aviv, Fortuna Sittard, and now Fuenlabrada.\n\nVictor Merchan (Union Adarve, 30, midfielder)\n\nA journeyman who spent 13 years at Real Madrid and also played for the Spain youth sides. After making it to Castilla he then made a move to Espanyol, before transferring through Caudal, Terrassa, Vilafranca and Alcobendas. After a few months without a club he was eventually signed by German side Denzlingen, but three years later he returned to Madrid with third division side San Agustin de Guadalix before moving again to Union Adarve.\n\nJuankar (Malaga, 29, left forward)\n\nThe 'Greyhound of Boadilla' as he was christened during his debut for the first team in 2010, despite being a Castilla player. He was the first youngster to break through under Mourinho. At the end of the 2010/11 season he left to sign for Sporting de Braga, where he never played. He then had spells at Zaragoza, Betis, Granada and Malaga, who then bought him outright. Injuries have been a problem and have held him back. He was an U21 international.\n\nAndy (Logrones, 30, midfielder)\n\nThe Grenadian was a key man in the C team that played in Segunda B, before leaving in 2012 to join Levante B, in the same division. Two seasons later he moved to Ponferradina, then coached by Manolo Díaz, who had him in the Real Madrid youth team. He played two seasons in the Segunda, and two in the Segunda B. His course changed and now he finds himself at Logrones. A midfielder with a good left foot, he is also the older brother of Fran Rodriguez.\n\nAlvaro Lopez (Retired, 28, midfielder)\n\nA surprising story. He was part of the Spain U17 European Championship-winning side that included Thiago, Canales, Keko and Montoya. He wasn't just a starter, but was the captain. He was a key player in the Juvenil de Toril success in 2010. He never made it to Casilla, but instead had several seasons with the C team, where he was unable to make the leap to the next level despite being captain. From there he went to Levante and Alcorcon, before hanging up his boots three years ago. With a degree in advertising and public relations, as well as a Master's in Business Communication Management, he is also looking into coaching.\n\nAleix Febas (Mallorca, 24, midfielder)\n\nA talented player, Aleix went to Albacete with coach Luis Miguel Ramis, who had him in the Madrid youth sides. After two years with at Castilla, he decided to try his luck away from Madrid. Mallorca have since given him the chance to shine at the top level this season.\n\nCarmona (Moralo, 27, right forward)\n\nAnother Catalan who came to Madrid after having been at Barcelona. He never made it at Valdebebas only reaching the Real Madrid C, before he began a tour of Spain which took him to Leganes, Valladolid B, Almeria B, Cadiz, Montanesa, Unionistas and Los Barrios. He had time at Gibraltar United before Atletico Ibanez brought him back to Spanish football and now he's at Moralo.\n\nJavi Munoz (Alaves, 24, midfielder)\n\nAnother 2014 youth team champion, who made over 100 appearances for Castilla in the Segunda B. He left to go to Lorca and played 35 games, scoring five goals, though was unable to prevent relegation. However, he liked the experience so much that he joined Alaves, and was loaned out to Real Oviedo but he has since returned.\n\nCristian Cedres (Las Palmas, 24, winger)\n\nAnother product of the Canary Islands and recruited by Sixto Alfonso, Real Madrid's scout there. He was almost ever present in the Spain youth teams, but didn't make the most of his move to Castilla. In his first season he made 27 appearances, but disappeared in his second (2016/17). He left for Villarreal B, where things again didn't work out, making just eight starts in 16 games. He has since returned to his roots and has done well back at Las Palmas.\n\nBelima (Estoril Praia, Brazil, 28, left forward)\n\nRuben Belima was a mainstay in the Real Madrid C team that played in the Segunda B, and was nicknamed the bullet of the left wing. At the end of 2014/15, with the disappearance of the second strong youth side, he made one appearance with Castilla. He then moved to Slovenia with FC Koper. After two seasons he joined second division Leixoes, before returning to Slovenia with NK Domzale. He's been on the move again, though, now plying his trade with Estoril Praia in Brazil.\n\nRamirez (Lech Poznan, Poland, 27, midfielder)\n\nHe is a classic No.10, left-footed and with talent. He formed part of an attack that also featured Jese and was one of the most used players at Real Madrid C. From there, he joined Valencia and Getafe's B teams, before joining Lodz in Poland. He's still playing in Poland, now a key player at Lech Poznan.\n\nAlvaro Morata (Atletico Madrid, 27, striker)\n\nMorata is one of the top graduates and was marked down for the first team from an early age. He joined Castilla in the 2010/11 season, although it took a while for him to settle. After debuting with the first team under Mourinho, he was promoted to Castilla and then he became a first-team regular with Carlo Ancelotti. A move to Juventus and a return to Real Madrid followed, with Morata winning LaLiga and the Champions League before departing once again for Chelsea and then making his way to Atletico Madrid.\n\nJese (Sporting CP, Portugal, 27, forward)\n\nJese is now at Sporting CP after being on the fringes of the Paris Saint-Germain squad, but there's always a question of 'what if' with him. Following progression through the academy, he became important for the Real Madrid first team under Ancelotti, until he tore his cruciate ligament. Since then, he has struggled to regain his former level and was sent out on loan to Las Palmas and Stoke. He was loaned to Real Betis from PSG but it didn't work, so now he's wearing those same colours in Portugal.\n\nPablo Sarabia (PSG, 27, midfielder)\n\nSarabia is another of the most successful alumni. In 2011 he left to join Getafe for 3m euros, at the age of 19. It might not have worked out there over his five seasons, but he then moved to Sevilla and was a star player there, before being snapped up by PSG.\n\nRaul De Tomas (Espanyol, 25, striker)\n\nFollowing a back-and-forth stint at Castilla, when he alternated with the C team, Raul De Tomas was sent out on a number of loans, to Cordoba, Valladolid and Rayo Vallecano, where he scored six, 14 and 24 goals respectively. He shone with Rayo and then became Benfica's most expensive signing, but after a few months he returned across the border and is now trying to fire Espanyol to safety.\n\nEnzo Zidane (Almeria, 24, midfielder)\n\nThe oldest son of Zinedine Zidane is trying to make his way in professional football. He became captain at Castilla, before leaving on loan to Alaves after two years. However, he hardly played in the Basque Country and switched to Lausanne in the middle of the season, before making his move to Rayo Majadahonda. From there he went to Desportivo Aves in Portugal and now works under Guti at Almeria.\n\nOscar Plano (Valladolid, 29, forward)\n\nHe may have been on the fringes during his time at the academy, but there are fond memories of Plano at Valdebebas, as he was a hard worker and was committed. It was at Alcorcon that he made his name in the second division, playing there for four seasons before a move to Valladolid, where he helped them win promotion and where he is now playing LaLiga football.\n\nJose Maria Barril (Coruxo, 27, winger)\n\nThis winger decided to forge a career for himself in the Unites States, having crossed the Atlantic after his time at Real Madrid, first joining Philadelphia Union and then signing with Harrisburg City Islanders. After time in Oklahoma he returned to Spain.\n\nAlvaro Jimenez (Albacete, 24, winger)\n\nHe was a champion with the Juvenil side in 2014 and also played with Castilla that year. He was there for two seasons, although his first Castilla campaign was the more impressive one. A move to Getafe followed and he helped them win promotion, before returning for their 2017/18 campaign, although he didn't play much in the second spell. He then moved to Sporting and since on to Albacete.\n\nMarcos Legaz (Real Murcia, 24, forward)\n\nThis Argentine scored in the final of the Copa de Campeones that Real Madrid won in 2014, but he hardly played when he made the move to Castilla. He has since spent time in the Segunda B and the Tercera divisions and is now at Real Murcia.\n\nFran Sol (Dynamo Kyiv, Ukraine, 28, forward)\n\nFran Sol was one of the most promising forwards to pass through the academy, but he never made it to Castilla. His ceiling at Real Madrid was the C team, a spell broken up by loans to Lugo and Real Oviedo. Eventually, he made the switch to Villarreal's B team and then made it to the first division at the club. He had a few years with Dutch side Willem II but is now playing in Ukraine.\n\nJoselu (Alaves, 29, striker)\n\nHis goals in 2012 brought Castilla up to the second division, before he left to Hoffenheim to the tune of 6m euros. It wasn't easy for him in Germany and it took until a move to Hannover for him to find his feet. From there, he was transferred to Stoke City and then sent out on loan to Deportivo. He didn't do too well with Newcastle in the Premier League and is now with Alaves.\n\nDenis Cheryshev (Valencia, 29, winger)\n\nThe Russian struggled to fit in at Castilla and he was even demoted to the C team. He matured there and improved his football, signing a contract with the first team. From there, he was sent out on loan to Sevilla and to Villarreal, before his Real Madrid career came to an end after his appearance in a Copa del Rey game led to the club's disqualification, as he was ineligible. A loan to Valencia and sale to Villarreal followed, before he returned to Valencia after a terrific World Cup.\n\nRuben Sobrino (Valencia, 27, forward)\n\nSobrino is another player who has blossomed in recent years, after leaving the academy. He first joined Ponferradina, before ending up on Manchester City's books. They loaned him out to Girona for the 2015/16 season, before joining Alaves the following year. He did well at Mendizorroza and earned a move to Mestalla.\n\nMariano (Real Madrid, 26, striker)\n\nMariano arrived at the academy in 2011 and went straight into the Juvenil A team, scoring goals throughout his progression to the C team, Castilla and the first team. Although he was impressive when he did play in 2016/17, he wasn't getting many minutes and was sold to Lyon, only to return one year later after a breakout year in France. He's now in the first-team squad after his summer transfer.\n\nJose Angel Pozo (Rayo Vallecano, 24, midfielder)\n\nHe was a promising youth teamer, but Real Madrid surprisingly accepted an offer of 3m euros from Manchester City when he was 16. Serious injuries plagued his time in England and delayed his progress, although he did manage to play and score for the first team at the age of 18. His City experience ended in 2015 as he moved to Almeria, before signing with Rayo Vallecano for their current LaLiga campaign.\n\nSamu Saiz (Girona, 29, forward)\n\nHe joined the academy at the age of eight and left at the age of 20, in 2010/11. He spent time at the B teams of Getafe, Almeria and Atletico Madrid, before joining Huesca and scoring 12 goals in 2016/17. From there, he made the move to Leeds United and worked under Marcelo Bielsa. He was punished for spitting on an opponent and returned to Spain."
