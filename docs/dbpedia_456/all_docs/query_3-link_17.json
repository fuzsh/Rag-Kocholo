        "text": "The Clasico is the most watched football match in the world, along with the Champions League final. This Sunday at 16:15 CEST at the Estadio Santiago Bernabeu, both teams are playing for the top spot in LaLiga Santander.\n\nTwo of the best teams in the world face each other in a match that never disappoints, generating a rivalry that is more than a hundred years old. Throughout the history of the Clasicos, there have been numerous players who have worn the jerseys of both teams.\n\nRicardo Zamora\n\nHe was the first big name to swap Barcelona for the Spanish capital. The goalkeeper who gives his name to the award for the best keeper in LaLiga Santander played for Barcelona between 1919 and 1921, and for Madrid between 1930 and 1936.\n\nBernd Schuster\n\nSchuster is one of the few players in history who has been able to wear the jersey of the three great Spanish teams (Real Madrid, Barcelona and Atletico Madrid). The German player wore the Blaugrana jersey between 1980 and 1988, and the white one, coinciding with the 'Quinta del Buitre', between 1988 and 1990.\n\nGheorghe Hagi\n\nFor many, the best Romanian in football history, also wore the jersey of both teams. First with Real Madrid, between 1990 and 1992, after leaving his native Romania, and then with Barcelona, between 1994 and 1996, after two seasons with Brescia.\n\nJulen Lopetegui\n\nThe former coach of Sevilla and Real Madrid also occupied the goalkeeper shirt of Los Blancos. It was in the 1989/1991 season. He was signed by Logrones and after his good performances, Barcelona decided to acquire his services from 1994 to 1996.\n\nRobert Prosinecki\n\nThe great Yugoslavian star of the 90s arrived at Real Madrid from Red Star in 1991 and stayed until 1994. After a year on loan at Real Oviedo, Barcelona signed him in 1995 and kept him until 1997.\n\nMichael Laudrup\n\nThe best Danish player of all time arrived at Barcelona in 1989 to join Johan Cruyff's 'Dream Team' and stayed at Barcelona until 1994. Real Madrid brought him in after his departure from their eternal rivals, and kept him in their ranks from 1994 to 1996.\n\nAlbert Celades\n\nCelades, a Barcelona youth player, wore the first team jersey for four seasons in Catalonia. In the 2000/2001 season, after a short spell with Celta Vigo, he joined Real Madrid for another four seasons.\n\nLuis Figo\n\nThe most famous transfer between Barcelona and Real Madrid occurred in 2000. Luis Figo arrived in Barcelona in 1995 from Sporting Lisbon and remained there until 2000, when he switched to Real Madrid in a record-breaking transfer under Florentino Perez.\n\nLu√≠s Enrique\n\nThe Sporting Gijon youth player joined Real Madrid in the 1991/1992 season and remained a Real Madrid player for five seasons. In the 1996/1997 season, 'Lucho' swapped Madrid for Barcelona, where he stayed until the 2003/2004 season.\n\nAlfonso Perez\n\nAlfonso, raised in the youth system of Real Madrid, debuted as a senior player in the 1990/1991 season and remained until the 1994/1995 season. After a fantastic spell with Real Betis, Barcelona signed him for two seasons.\n\nRonaldo Nazario\n\nOne of the best strikers in history joined Barcelona from PSV in the 1996/1997 season. After a few seasons at Inter, Florentino Perez signed him for Real Madrid in the 2002/2003 season, where he stayed until the 2006/2007 season.\n\nSamuel Eto'o\n\nThe Cameroonian striker signed for Real Madrid as a youth prodigy. After a brief spell with Los Blancos, the striker went to Espanyol on loan first and then transferred to Real Mallorca. After his exceptional development in Spain, Barcelona signed him in 2004, where he stayed until 2009, enjoying the best period of his career.\n\nJavier Saviola\n\nJavier Saviola signed for Barcelona in 2001, where he remained until 2007. After a season at Monaco and another at Sevilla, Madrid signed him for the 2007/2008 and 2008/2008 seasons, where he played 31 games in two seasons."
