        "text": "Newcastle produced a rampant first half display in their penultimate pre-season outing as they thrashed La Liga side Girona 4-0 on Friday.\n\nThe Magpies blitzed their opponents in the opening 45 minutes, with Sean Longstaff, Jacob Murphy and Anthony Gordon giving the hosts a 3-0 lead after just 15 minutes.\n\nLongstaff notched his brace before the interval to secure the Magpies' first win in their two pre-season fixtures taking place at St. James' Park this weekend.\n\nIn a frantic start to proceedings, Longstaff opened the scoring in the third minute, with Murphy adding Newcastle's second with a fierce strike off the crossbar.\n\nA mistake by David Lopez allowed Alexander Isak to pick out Gordon two minutes later, composing himself before sending a left-footed strike into the far corner.\n\nIsak had the chance to increase the hosts' advantage in the 21st minute after being brought down in the box, but saw his penalty saved by Paulo Gazzaniga.\n\nThe first half rout was complete after Joelinton saw his headed effort hit the crossbar, only for the rebound to be volleyed home by Longstaff.\n\nMurphy and Isak squandered opportunities to increase their advantage in the second half, but the damage was done in the first 45 against the La Liga side.\n\nNewcastle conclude their pre-season preparations against French side Brest on Saturday ahead of their Premier League opener against Southampton next weekend.\n\nData Debrief: Magpies on fire, but should have been more\n\nNewcastle would have been expecting a tougher test from a side who will play Champions League football next season, and should have won by a more handsome scoreline.\n\nThe Magpies recorded an expected goals (xG) of 3.24, an underperformance of 0.76, with 11 of their 20 shots on target, while also missing four big chances.\n\nSergio Camello came off the bench to score twice in extra time as Spain added Olympic gold to their glittering trophy cabinet with a thrilling 5-3 victory over France.\n\nThree goals in 10 first-half minutes – two from Fermin Lopez and the other from Alex Baena – appeared to take the final away from Thierry Henry's hosts, who had led early on through Enzo Millot.\n\nHowever, Maghnes Akliouche teed up a grandstand finish at the Parc des Princes, then Benat Turrientes' foul allowed Jean-Phillipe Mateta to force extra time with a 93rd-minute penalty.\n\nBoth teams threw caution to the wind in the additional period, but Camello was the hero, producing a wonderful lob and a breakaway second to secure gold for Spain.\n\nThe hosts took the lead with the very first attempt of the game as Millot pounced on a loose clearance to fire goalwards from the right side of the area. Spain goalkeeper Arnau Tenas seemed to misjudge the flight of the ball, palming it into the bottom-left corner.\n\nHowever, Spain soon hit back through Barcelona youngster Lopez, who swept his finish into the bottom-left corner after being found in the middle of the area by Baena.\n\nBuoyed by that strike, Spain built a two-goal lead within 10 further minutes. Lopez pounced for his second when Guillaume Restes could only parry Abel Ruiz's shot to put them 2-1 up, then Baena added the pick of the goals.\n\nLining up a free-kick just to the left of the D, the Villarreal man gave Restes no chance by whipping a sensational effort over the wall and into the top-left corner.\n\nManu Kone missed a great chance to cut Spain's lead when he nodded against the crossbar after the break, but Les Bleus' hopes were rekindled with 11 minutes to play as Michael Olise's free-kick was steered into the far corner by Akliouche.\n\nThere was more drama in stoppage time, with Turrientes clumsily dragging Arnaud Kalimuendo down from a corner. Mateta kept his nerve from the spot to level, though Turrientes almost redeemed himself with a dream winner when his shot clipped the crossbar at the other end.\n\nFrance continued to press in extra time, but they were caught out in the 100th minute as Camello latched onto Adrian Bernabe's pass before sitting Restes down with a delicate chipped finish.\n\nCamello was not done there, latching onto a long throw from Tenas as France threw players forward in stoppage time, before making sure of the gold by finishing past Restes.\n\nData Debrief: Roja end 32-year Olympic wait\n\nSince an iconic Spain team featuring the likes of Pep Guardiola and Luis Enrique won gold on home soil at Barcelona 1992, La Roja have been reduced to the role of nearly men at the Games.\n\nThey were losing finalists at Syndey 2000 (versus Cameroon) and Tokyo 2020 (against Brazil), but they got over the line this time around, even if they had to go the distance.\n\nWith the senior squad winning a record-breaking fourth European crown last month and the under-23s claiming gold in Paris, it looks like this era of Spanish success could go on for some time yet.\n\nEmma Hayes is eyeing gold in her first tournament in charge of the USWNT, labelling their journey to the Olympics final as \"the stuff dreams are made of\".\n\nThe United States face Brazil in Saturday's showpiece match at the Parc des Princes in a repeat of the 2004 and 2008 finals, fixtures the US won on both occasions.\n\nHayes, who was appointed as Vlatko Andonovski's successor in May, has won eight of her nine games in charge (D1), scoring 19 goals and conceding just twice.\n\nThe former Chelsea head coach won her seventh WSL title in her final season with the Blues, saying her rapid transition to the international stage has been a \"whirlwind\".\n\n\"Going from my beloved Chelsea to the US women’s national team - what a whirlwind and what a dream all at once,\" Hayes said.\n\n\"To finish my time with Chelsea with another Women's Super League title and then be here competing for gold, honestly this is the stuff dreams are made of.\n\n\"I have visualised this moment so many times in my life.\"\n\nBrazil are seeking their first gold in women's football at the Games, and are boosted by the return of Marta, who will play her final international match on Saturday.\n\nThe 38-year-old was shown a red card in Brazil's final group game against Spain for a high foot, resulting in her missing the quarter and semi-finals.\n\nMarta has scored 121 goals in 203 appearances for her nation, becoming the first player to score in five straight Olympics with her brace against Japan.\n\n“When I was a young coach assisting Vic Akers at Arsenal, we played a Women’s Cup two-legged final against Umea, the Swedish champions, and they had a young Marta,” Hayes recalled.\n\n“I remember being on the touchline thinking, ‘Oh my goodness, who is this extraordinary player?’ To witness what she’s done on the pitch, I think she’s been more than a role model and icon, she’s been the best player.\n\n“What she’s done for Brazil or the generation coming through, she’s been an inspiration.”\n\nTeam USA have the chance to win a first gold medal since London 2012 after winning bronze in Tokyo three years ago.\n\nDespite winning 16 major titles during her time at Chelsea, Hayes is hungry to add to her trophy cabinet while continuing her unbeaten start in the US dugout.\n\n\"I like winning, it's part of my DNA,\" Hayes said. \"I'm with a team that likes winning so of course our goal is to win the gold medal.\""
