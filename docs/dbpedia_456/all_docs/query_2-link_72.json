        "text": "MILAN - Francesco Totti scored a penalty as he played his 500th match for AS Roma in the 2-0 defeat of Napoli, but despite his side's sterling form, he is still not talking up their title chances.\n\nTotti is nothing short of a living legend at Roma and has set several records this season.\n\nAS Roma captain Francesco Totti (Down C) celebrates with teammate Alberto Aquilani after scoring a penalty during the Napoli versus Roma at San Paolo Stadium in Naples. Roma won 2-0. [Agencies]\n\nFirst he notched his 200th goal in professional football, then he managed a record 388 league appearances for the club and now he has surpassed the 500 barrier in all competitions.\n\nAnd for his club, things could not be going much better.\n\nRoma knocked Real Madrid out of the Champions League in the previous round and is through to the last eight.\n\nIts league form has also been mightily impressive as it has closed to within six points of leaders Inter Milan, and but for the dubious sending off of their French center-half Philippe Mexes when last the two sides met, they could even have won that match at the San Siro and been just three points behind.\n\nGoals from Simone Perrotta and Totti's spot kick gave the giallorossi a victory Sunday on the same pitch that saw Inter lose its unbeaten league record a week earlier.\n\nEven so, Totti is not getting carried away.\n\n\"We've given a powerful statement because last week Napoli were stratospheric,\" said Totti.\n\n\"But we came here with a winning mentality. The championship, and I repeat, is Inter's to lose because we can't do any more than we are doing.\n\n\"If they make any mistakes we need to capitalize. Six points with 12 (actually 11) matches to play, there's still a long way to go.\"\n\nInter ended a four-match streak - including three league matches - without a victory by beating Reggina 2-0 at home on Saturday, but their goalkeeper Julio Cesar was their best player.\n\nIt is no secret Roma is far from its best and faces the possibility of dropping out of the Champions League on Tuesday when it must overturn a 2-0 deficit against last season's finalist Liverpool at the San Siro.\n\nTotti, though, will be cheering on the Italians.\n\n\"I hope Inter get through. I'll be supporting Inter because we don't want to be the only Italian team left in Europe.\n\n\"They've got the right team even to beat a great Liverpool side.\"\n\nOne thinks, though, that Totti is also hoping Inter's continued involvement abroad might distract it in the league, while Roma hopes to use its European progression to inspire its league campaign.\n\nTurning his attention to his own achievement, Totti was understandably proud.\n\n\"That number is important but I hope to play on as long as possible,\" he said.\n\n\"It's with satisfaction that I've beaten all the records in this jersey. It's a dream that I wanted to realize, a bet I wanted to win since I was small.\n\n\"Now I don't want to wake up. Arriving at 600 games? I'll need another three years, I hope to get there, but also to reach 300 goals.\"\n\nWhile Roma kept the pressure on Inter, another important battle took a another twist.\n\nFourth-placed Fiorentina lost 1-0 at Siena while two late goals from Massimo Ambrosini and Kaka allowed AC Milan to win 3-1 at Empoli and close to within one point of the Viola.\n\nThe two teams are battling it out for a place in next season's Champions League, alongside third-placed Juventus, which put daylight between itself and the others with a 2-0 win at Genoa.\n\nJuve have 51 points with Fiorentina on 47 and Milan on 46. Only two of those three will make it to next season's Champions League.\n\nMilan coach Carlo Ancelotti is now feeling a lot better about his team's chances of claiming a top-four finish, particularly as his team is out of Europe while Fiorentina is still in the UEFA Cup and battling on two fronts.\n\n\"It was a good day for us due to the defeat of (Cesare) Prandelli's team (Fiorentina),\" he said.\n\n\"But there's still a long way to go. We have the advantage of not playing in the cup (Europe). It's different but I hope it helps us.\""
