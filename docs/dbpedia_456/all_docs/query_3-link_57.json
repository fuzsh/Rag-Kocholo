        "text": "Messi and Argentina won the Copa America 2024, while Cristiano Ronaldo and Portugal were eliminated from the quarterfinals in Euro 2024.\n\nMessi or Ronaldo - Who is best? It is an impossible question to answer in the Football world. Football fans worldwide have been making subjective analyses for years over who is best. But it is never going to help solve this mystery, even though they both are legendary football players with very distinct personalities. Both are all-time leading scorers for their individual national teams.\n\nWhile some believe Lionel Messi is the world’s best player, you can never write off the Portuguese ‘One Man Army.’ Over the past decade, Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi have racked up the most individual awards, despite now being 38 years and 36 years, respectively. But the question remains: Which one in this fierce professional rivalry comes out on top and why? Who is better, Messi or Ronaldo? Or is it even viable comparing them? Let’s find out.\n\nMessi vs Ronaldo Stats and Comparison of Goal, Trophies\n\nUnleash your inner Messi or Dhoni! Master the art of football and fantasy cricket with our expert tips and tricks and dominate the leaderboard to win real cash prizes.\n\nRonaldo vs Messi: Early Struggle and Youth Career\n\nAs a kid born and raised in central Argentina, Messi was diagnosed with growth hormone deficiency. After relocating to Spain and joining Barcelona at age 13, the club agreed to pay for his treatment. Since then, the kid has not looked back. From making his competitive debut at age 17 to winning his first Ballon d’Or and the FIFA Player of the Year Award at 22, the young Argentine was in the limelight at the very early stages of his career.\n\nHis counterpart, ‘Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro,’ was born in the islands of Madeira in a poor family where ends meet was their daily struggle. Ronaldo was diagnosed with a racing heart at the age of 15. After undergoing a successful operation, young Ronaldo joined Sporting CP to kick start his senior club career before joining Manchester United in 2003, aged 18. He helped the team win three consecutive Premier League titles before winning the Ballon d’Or and FIFA Player of the Year at the age of 23.\n\nIn the battle of Messi vs Ronaldo: To date, Messi has won the Ballon d'Or award a record 8 times while on the other hand, Cristiano Ronaldo has won 5 times.\n\nRonaldo vs Messi: Style of Play\n\nMessi and Ronaldo differ primarily in their style of play. The Argentine is a virtuoso, a magician with the ball at his feet. Short in stature, he has a low center of gravity, helping him switch lines and increase his pace. It usually is a nightmare for defenders as they cannot cope with the quick turn of speed. Along with this, his dribbling skills are among the best the game has ever seen. Another eye-catching attribute of his game is his passing and shooting.\n\nThe Portuguese, on the other hand, is a bit different. One would say he doesn't possess the same magic Messi does. However, Ronaldo is tall, strong, and athletic. With Ronaldo on the ground, the game becomes faster, stronger, physical, and more dynamic than ever. Ronaldo's combination of physical and technical attributes might give him an edge over in this Ronaldo vs Messi battle. Ronaldo is regarded as one of the greatest footballers of all time.\n\nAlso read: Best Football Player in World\n\nRonaldo vs Messi: ‘Talent’ vs ’Hard work’\n\nOne of the main debatable topics while comparing these legends is Messi's 'Talent' vs Ronaldo's 'Hard work.' Ronaldo, a very skinny boy in his early days, has shown the world how hard work and determination lead to an amazing and unexpected transformation. In today's time, the Portuguese is one of the fittest footballers in the world.\n\nMessi's physical attributes of being a direct runner, good in the air, and minimum time on the sidelines is something to envy. In his early days, the Argentine wasn't the best at taking free kicks. But, over the years, he has become the best free-kick taker and playmaker in the world.\n\nOn the whole, there's no talent without hard work, and no hard work without talent. Uncompromised hard work, dedication, and talent make a player great, and that separates these giants from the rest of the footballing crowd and makes them one of the greatest footballers of all time.\n\nAlso read: Who is the god of football?\n\nConclusion: Who is better Messi or Ronaldo?\n\nIt isn't easy to conclude this Ronaldo vs Messi debate or comparison because there shouldn't be one. We should be blessed to live in an era where we can watch two of the greatest players ever to grace the pitch and go neck to neck against each other. Succeeding individually and with their respective teams while having supremely different styles of play is what makes them great.\n\nBoth these players are a blessing to the individuals playing fantasy football leagues. Goals and assists for a striker are the bread and butter in terms of fantasy football points.\n\nFAQ’s\n\nWho is better Messi Or Ronaldo?\n\nRonaldo has scored a record number of international goals and appearances, but Messi has won more Ballon d'Or awards (8). Messi has spent most of his playing career in Spain and France, while Ronaldo has played in Portugal, England, Spain, and Italy.\n\nWho is No 1 Messi or Ronaldo?\n\nMessi has won more titles, majorly with Barcelona, than Ronaldo. Messi played for arguably the best Barcelona side to ever play the game. At the same time, Ronaldo took his talent and skills to Manchester United, Real Madrid, and Juventus to achieve success and win trophies."
