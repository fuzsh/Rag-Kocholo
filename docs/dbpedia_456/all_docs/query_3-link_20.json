        "text": "Manchester United\n\nRonaldo’s successful season with Sporting brought him to the attention of Europe’s biggest clubs. In 2003 he became the first Portuguese player to sign with Manchester United, one of England’s richest and best-supported football clubs. He was an instant sensation and soon came to be regarded as one of the best forwards in the game. His most successful season with Manchester United came in 2007–08. That season Ronaldo won the Golden Shoe award as Europe’s leading scorer and FIFA World Player of the Year honors. Ronaldo led Manchester United to a Champions League title in May 2008. In 2009 he led United to another Champions League final, but they lost to FC Barcelona.\n\nReal Madrid\n\nRonaldo moved to the Spanish club Real Madrid the following season. During the 2010–11 season he scored the most goals (40) in La Liga (Spanish football league) history. (That record was broken the following season by Lionel Messi at FC Barcelona.) Ronaldo helped Madrid win the La Liga championship in 2011–12. In 2013 he earned his second world player of the year award. In 2014 Ronaldo scored 52 goals in 43 games. He led Madrid to a Champions League title, and he won another world player of the year award.\n\nIn October 2015 Ronaldo became Real Madrid’s all-time leading goal scorer when he netted his 324th goal. His play continued to lead the team to La Liga and Champions League titles. In 2016 he captured his fourth player of the year award, and his fifth came the next year. In the 2017–18 season Ronaldo scored 44 goals in 44 games, and Real Madrid won a third straight Champions League title.\n\nIn July 2018 he signed a contract with Juventus, one of Italy’s oldest and most successful clubs. He scored 101 goals during the 131 games he played for Juventus. Ronaldo returned to Manchester United in August 2021 but left the club in 2022.\n\nNational Team\n\nRonaldo made his first appearance on Portugal’s national team in 2003. He helped the team finish in fourth place at the 2006 World Cup. In 2008 he became full-time captain of the national team. In 2016 he helped Portugal win the European Championship. It was Portugal’s first major international tournament title. In September 2021 Ronaldo broke the record for most goals in international football when he scored his 110th and 111th goals during Portugal’s match against the Republic of Ireland. Ronaldo achieved another milestone at the World Cup in 2022. He scored a goal in Portugal’s opening match against Ghana. With that, he became the first male player in history to have scored a goal at five World Cups."
