        "text": "Cristiano Ronaldo put in an appearance to answer questions on all things Real Madrid at the Roma pre-match press conference.\n\nReal on a high: \"I think the team are looking good, they've been doing a phenomenal job recently. We've been playing well, winning and scoring a lot of goals. It's all good. This is a different competition but the Champions League is our competition, and that's speaking for both the club and the players.\"\n\nOn Lionel Messi's recent penalty: \"I know why Leo did that. Enough said. Believe whatever you want.\"\n\nDoubts about his performances: \"When you spoil people it's the same as when you spoil your children. When you don't do what they want, they cry. Let's hope things continue as they are until the end of season. I'd be more than happy with that. The media have a lot to say. That's the problem but I don't lose any sleep over it. Let them talk\".\n\nAre you happy?: \"Of course I'm happy at Real Madrid. The club takes care of me, I play all the time, I score goals from time to time. I couldn't be happier. I'm playing for the best club in the world and am doing what I love.\"\n\n'Los Blancos' tipped as favourites against Roma: \"It depends how you look at things. Real Madrid are always favourites. The Champions League is special for Real Madrid, more than for any other club. We know that La Liga is going to be difficult because we're trailing by a significant number of points.\"\n\nFrancesco Totti: \"Totti is someone we all look up to. Age isn't important in football. Maybe at 40, yes, but if he wants to keep playing and he feels good, why not? Football has no limits.\""
