        "text": "Cristiano Ronaldo's Real Madrid exit is entering its decisive phase, with Juventus waiting for Jorge Mendes to confirm that 100 million euros will be enough to seal the player's signature.\n\nWhile the offer is of huge economic weighting, it is one that has been studied and considered for some time by Andrea Agnelli in Turin, who is now only awaiting official confirmation from Mendes that there is a willingness to sell the star for 100 million euros, which has been deemed as viable and profitable for the Italian champions.\n\nAgnelli is of course aware of the obvious on-field contribution a player of Cristiano Ronaldo's calibre can contribute, but also how he can elevate the club's brand on an international level that would bring great financial reward.\n\nThe 'Cristiano case', which exploded last Tuesday on the front page of MARCA now depends on the commitment of Real Madrid and whether or not they really are willing to let the player go for 100 million euros, though all signs indicate that they are.\n\nReal have been adamant that the player's release clause still stands at 1 billion euros, ruling out any possibility of an exit, but it is thought that they would be more willing to accept Juventus' lower offer - or one closer to 120 million euros - should the player publicly request a transfer.\n\nAs things stand, there will be no more movements unless an offer lands in Madrid or Cristiano Ronaldo speaks out about his desire to leave the club and according to Sky Sport Italia, Juve president Agnelli expects Mendes to confirm the offer.\n\nItalian press have also claimed that Juventus would present the player this Saturday, marking the iconic signing of a new No. 7 by announcing it on the seventh day of the seventh month.\n\nFor now, the next scene is this soap opera will likely be the revelation of an official offer from Juventus, which is expected as soon as they receive confirmation that the player will be allowed to leave."
