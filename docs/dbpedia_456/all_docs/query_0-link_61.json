        "text": "Former Real Madrid defender Philipp Lienhart has slammed some of his former teammates, saying that he saw under-17 players carrying â¬500 toiletry bags.\n\nLienhart spent four years at Madrid from 2014 to 2017, playing for the Real Madrid C and Real Madrid B teams before eventually making one appearance for the senior side.\n\nThe centre back left Madrid for Freiburg in 2017, initially on loan, before making the transfer permanent for â¬2 million and add-ons.\n\nLienhart has since become an established player in the Bundesliga, as well as breaking into the Austria national team setup.\n\nLooking back at his time at Real Madrid, Lienhart painted a picture of a group of primadonnas.\n\nWhat did Lienhart say about Real Madrid?\n\n\"I was surprised to see under-17 players walking around with 500 euro toiletry bags,\" Lienhart told Transfermarkt.\n\n\"I don't think that's necessary... I think it's not good when a young player earns so much money, he can lose sight of what's really important in his career. That's how you lose a lot of young talents."
