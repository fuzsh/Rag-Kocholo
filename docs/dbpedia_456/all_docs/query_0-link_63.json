        "text": "Real Madrid boast a raft of promising youngsters who are either starring for the club’s youth sides or getting first-team experience out on loan.\n\nFor example, Iker Bravo and Álvaro Ginés were included on the Guardian’s list of the world’s most exciting players born in 2005.\n\nBravo is a 6ft tall striker who has four goals and three assists this term for Castilla, Madrid’s ‘B’ team. He could graduate to the seniors next year.\n\nThe 18-year-old is a powerful, two-footed player who’s adept at holding off his marker and getting himself into shooting positions.\n\nGinés, 17, is less well-known. He plays at No.10 or up front for the U18s, and has a real eye for goal. He’s earning glowing scouting reports.\n\nSergio Arribas, 21, is one of the best players in Spain’s third tier. He’s excelled for Castilla for a while, but is struggling for first-team chances.\n\nHe’s an attacking midfielder who has bags of quality and chips in with plenty of goals. This season, he has nine in 20 games - plus six assists.\n\nRight winger Peter Federico, 20, has played three times for the first team. Quick and skilful, he has a goal and four assists for Castilla this term.\n\nBrahim Díaz, 23, is due to return from a loan spell at AC Milan in the summer. He could be a good young option to have in the top squad.\n\nAntonio Blanco, 22, and Reinier Jesus, 21, are two more players who have gone out on loan to get regular first-team football.\n\nIf Toni Kroos and Luka Modric retire, midfielder Blanco could secure a place in the Madrid squad next season. As a winger, Reinier faces a tougher task.\n\nTakefusa Kubo is a player Madrid have sold - but with a buy-back option. The Japan international is impressing for Real Sociedad this season."
