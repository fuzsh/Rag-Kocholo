        "text": "It was never about the complex tactical battles. It was never about the brainstorming over the chalkboards and stringently following methods. It was never about over analyzing every aspect of the game and devising ai???strategiesai??i?? to almost make the players look programmed bots. It was a simple sport where a few men passed the ball between them taking it to a destination while a few other men wearing slightly different colors trying to stop them do that. The only reason football entices the most unadulterated and unconstrained of emotions is its simplicity. Itai??i??s always been the sport for a romantic who indulges in an unmitigated ardor and never refrains from establishing this time and again ai??i?? on the pitch and even off it.\n\nHowever, today we are living in the modern age where science and technology have revolutionized the world, as we see it. The world is evolving at a pace many find it difficult to keep track of this process of evolution. The second renaissance ai??i?? the technological one ai??i?? has successfully constructed a social system of its own where even the emotions have perhaps gone digital. The man of today has been reduced to being a systematized tool who behaves in a pretty structured and purposely manufactured manner under any situation. As sad as it may appear, the world of football too has failed to alienate itself from this worldly phenomenalism and by maintaining sync with the changing times, the sport today is only a very well-engineered and perfectly constructed system where players are literally molded to be operational on the field for a stipulated time only as instructed. The element of romance, something which always defined football in more ways than one, has clearly gone missing, you might feel.\n\nAnd then, right when youai??i??re about to abandon the hopes, you see ai??i?? like you already have time and again ai??i?? a certain Francesco Totti unraveling his magic at Stadio Olimpico on a Saturday night to dismantle a Fiorentina side. And all of a sudden, you start finding reasons to continue to believe in your football, continue to believe in this world and most importantly, reassure yourself that the sport you virtually identify yourself with is still not that bad after all. Surely people shall revel into the two goals he scored and his contribution to the other two but it is the cacoethes, the vehemence and the ecstasy ai??i?? something that is way beyond any quantifiable parameters is what exactly defines Totti and this night was nothing but another advertisement of these attributes of the man.\n\nNot even twelve months ago, you wouldn’t have even remotely imagined Totti playing anywhere near to the levels he has been this season. Though his commitment and application were never diminished, one could hardly discount the aging legs and fading reflexes that make things harder for any footballer. Over the course of last two seasons, the team had certainly taken the measures to explore a world beyond Totti and quite frankly, no one has a reason to complain there. However, things did not go as per the plan and Roma failed on every front ai??i?? completely losing the plot while trying to employ another brand of football. Despite things having gone awry, Totti was not the answer on anyoneai??i??s mind in constructing the plans to get them back on track.\n\nBut then, if Zdenek Zeman does not surprise you, who really will? The Czech wizard is a legend in his own rights. He Ai??has never been unanimously admired as a character but the opinion has rather been left to an individualai??i??s discretion. Zeman arouses the sentiments of both approval and criticism in the same measure but what nobody can deny is the fact that heai??i??s the only reason the world has been able to see Francesco Totti play to the best of his abilities one more time. The transition of Totti in his new role seems so impeccable, you might well be compelled to think no manager in the thirteen years since Zemanai??i??s first stint at Roma managed to understand Totti and his game.\n\nZeman was the one who brought Totti to the fore during the two seasons he was in charge of the team back then in the late 90ai??i??s and the manager has once again deployed Totti in the same left wide position thirteen years later to grind out the best of him after a series of managers tried to play him in a number of positions. Totti has amassed six goals and five assists in the current season so far and has pleasantly surprised every fan by the ascendancy in his football. Totti is easily playing some of his best football and as the stats reflect, heai??i??s been the most important player for Roma under Zeman, one more time.\n\nAt 36, heai??i??s extremely energetic, hungry and passionate about his game and it clearly shows in his approach on the pitch. Being a surreally talented player, the trickeries that he puts on exhibition are totally natural and come pretty effortlessly to him but the levels of his tenacity and resolve simply defy the conventions. Age may have seemed to hamper his game during the past season or two but the Totti we see today is definitely the one from the older days ai??i?? one we are so used to be left in awe of. His famous celebrations of sucking the right thumb are still as refreshing as ever and are demonstrative of his unparalleled endowment not only to AS Roma but to the game of football.\n\nThe form that Totti today finds himself in is perhaps the last gift presented to him by Zdenek Zeman. He cannot be grateful enough to his manager for reigniting the fire by correctly identifying what was missing in his game. More than anyone else, the Roma fans must be thankful to Zeman who has perhaps one last time gifted them with the magic of Totti. The footballing spectacle that Totti has always been, has in this ever so mechanizing world, given the fans a reason or two to derive the true pleasure out of what is sheer resplendency and grandeur of his game.\n\nBut even then, there is an innate understanding of worldly realities that keeps the romantic inside you in good check. Howsoever discouraging the very thought might be, the fact of the matter remains that this too shall pass. Totti too, shall someday stop to grace the football field and the day, much to the displeasure of anyone associated with football, might not be all too far. The cruel nature of the world, you might want to call it but till then, lose yourselves into this aura of magnificence.\n\nvar
