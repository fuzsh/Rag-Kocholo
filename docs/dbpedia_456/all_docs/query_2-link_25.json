Not many would have the nerve to pull it off that well. That pass, btw, summed up his world cup, the perfect link in our transition play.\n\nInternationally... he made the FIFA best 11 of the 2006 World Cup, not many get the chance to be included in that, only the best of the best. He was a key part of our World Cup winning squad. With Roma, well obviously our history isn't as great as Juve's, especially on the European stage. That can't be held against him though. Nonetheless, he played some truly great games in the Champions League (e.g. at the Bernabeu), but we never had the team to challenge for the title.\n\nAs are you saying that Totti didin't revolutionize the game? He was one of the best trequartistas in the past two decades and even adapted to play as a seconda and prima punta and was even a winger at one point in his career. No noticeable difference between Del Piero and Totti's contributions to the game, saying one did this and the other one didn't is automatically disrespectful to the other, because they both have done as much as anyone possibly can.\n\nWell in the footballing world, he did not assist Del Piero.\n\nInternationally he is not on Italia's top ten scoring list, whereas Del Piero is third tied with Roberto Baggio.\n\nChampion's League alone is uncomparable, and Del Piero has done better all the time, even with a team that was not that great, like against Madrid where he scored individual goals for the most part.\n\nDel Piero has left more of a mark on the game, and you cannot deny that. He was won more collectively, individually, has cemented himself as a top five free kick taker of all time, and is more known and respected across the world.\n\nYo man, I agree with you quite often, but don't let your love for Del Piero affect your argument. I'm trying to be as objective as possible here and in all honesty, there is absolutely nothing that can be said to establish which one of the two is clearly better. Stats don't seperate them. You say Del Piero has more goals with Italy, I'll counter with Totti having more goals in Serie A. Del Piero scored against Madrid, so did Totti (though I don't know why that matters so much lol).\n\nIndividual honors? Too close to call.\n\nTotti: European Golden Shoe, Golden Foot, Serie A Young Footballer of the Year, 2 Serie A footballer of the year, 5 Italian Footballer of the year, Euro 2000 and WC 2006 Team of the tournament.\n\nDel Piero: European U21 Footballer of the year, Golden Foot, 2 Serie A player of he year, 1 Serie A Top Scorer, 1 Champions League Top Scorer\n\nFree kicks, Totti is great at those too and even scored a few this season. More known? I wouldn't think so, once again it's a tie.\n\nRe: Francesco Totti vs Alessandro Del Piero\n\nby ErPupone Mon Aug 15, 2011 8:27 pm\n\nAlso, Claudio Ranieri recently said that Totti is the best player he ever coached. Then, I'm sure there are others who say Del Piero is better. At the end of the day, if even the people who have seen Totti and Del Piero train and play week in and week out can't say which one is defintely better, how can WE possibly say that one is better than the other.\n\nRe: Francesco Totti vs Alessandro Del Piero\n\nby JuvenelCuore Mon Aug 15, 2011 8:28 pm\n\nTotti scored his goals at Roma, with nobody to share the spotlight with to the extent of Del Piero.\n\nAnd his awards are very misleading.\n\nTotti: European Golden Shoe, Golden Foot, Serie A Young Footballer of the Year, 2 Serie A footballer of the year, 5 Italian Footballer of the year, Euro 2000 and WC 2006 Team of the tournament.\n\nEuropean Golden Shoe = nothing to say. Good award.\n\nThe Golden Foot = an award is an international football award, given to players who stand out for their athletic achievements (both as individuals and team players) and for their personality.\n\n- Really ? This was after he called Balotelli a \"n*gger\" and got into fights ? Not to mention it is an online poll. Nothing too big.\n\nSerie A Footballer of the Year = undeserved. He won it with Pavel Nedved who in that year won the Ballon d'Or. Do you not find that a joke ?\n\nItalian Footballer of the Year = he won it 5/13 times. Do you not find that shocking ? Baggio and Maldini never won it. WHAT ?\n\nHis awards are menial. I am sorry, but that is the way the cookie crumbles.\n\nRe: Francesco Totti vs Alessandro Del Piero\n\nby JuvenelCuore Mon Aug 15, 2011 8:29 pm\n\nErPupone wrote:Also, Claudio Ranieri recently said that Totti is the best player he ever coached.

He is also unemployed. Come on, his opinion is clearly not relevant.\n\nRe: Francesco Totti vs Alessandro Del Piero\n\nby ErPupone Mon Aug 15, 2011 8:39 pm\n\nOhhh I'm sure you know more than Ranieri then.\n\nLook, I see now that you're not willing to consider Totti's accomplishments. If you're not capable of recognizing the fact that there's nothing to definitely seperate these two players, it's because you're looking at them from you're point of view, as a Juventino and I don't blame you for it, it's natural to defend your idol. Maybe you don't like Totti which is why you're using any possible excuse to diminish his life's work. I'm not going to bother going on with this argument because for one, I don't have the time to do so at this moment and secondly, above all, you're unwilling to consider anything I say which is a great shame because I think a thread of this sort should've only been used to highlight the accomplishments and dedication of these two champions and not to have this sort of pointless argument to pit Juve and Roma fans against each other. I for one am able to look beyond a player's colors and appreciate the work they have done for another team, even if it is a rival. It's a shame that other people can't do the same.\n\nRe: Francesco Totti vs Alessandro Del Piero\n\nby juve_gigi Mon Aug 15, 2011 9:22 pm\n\nRoberto Baggio...\n\nAlessandro Del Piero...\n\nFrancesco Totti\n\nRoberto Baggio is the greastest Italian player of all time. I saw him play and watched him for many years, nobody compares. But Del Piero, if not for the injury, would have been a close second for sure.\n\nAs for Totti, meh I would say he is in the top 15 greatest Italians. I would put Baggio, Del Piero, Maldini, Baresi, Scirea, Paolo Rossi, Buffon, Riva, Rivera, Zoff, Gentile, Boniperti, Cannavaro, and Nesta ahead of him. You could make an argument about Totti being ahead of some of these players, but it is hard to compare players at different positions.\n\nBut as far as strikers go, I would put Baggio, Del Piero, Rivera, Riva, Paolo Rossi, and Boniperti ahead of Totti.\n\nRe: Francesco Totti vs Alessandro Del Piero\n\nby JuvenelCuore Mon Aug 15, 2011 9:27 pm\n\n@ErPupone: since when is Roma a rival of Juventus ? No offence, but even in Juventus' worst period in their history Roma has only managed one win since 2007 in Serie A play.\n\nBut that is neither here nor there. Totti has little accomplishments. I mean, he did fantastic for Roma and he is a legend there, but that is about it. In the grand scheme of things, Del Piero is more accomplished, respected, known, and has left a greater mark on the game. Totti, if he were not so disrespectful and rude, would have to be one of my favorite non-Juventus players so I am not saying what I am saying out of hate, or else I would have brought up pedantic arguments of Totti spitting on people, and doing this and that.\n\nRe: Francesco Totti vs Alessandro Del Piero\n\nby Eivindo Mon Aug 15, 2011 11:48 pm\n\nDel Piero, because I love him as a person and player.

It's no Roma-Lazio and no Juve-Inter, but they are still rivals. And if you say Totti has little accomplishments, I'm sorry but you're completely wrong. You absolutely can't say that Del Piero is more accomplished. He had better players surrounding him and was thus allowed to go further in competitions such as the Champions League. But in comparing simply the two players, we shouldn't even be using collective honors. But hey, at least I have the humility not to say \"Totti is the best because...\" I respect other players like Del Piero too much to go around splitting hairs over their accomplishments. I only expected you, a fan that I sometimes agree with and even defend, to do the same for a player that has sacrificed so much over his career to represent both Roma and the Italian national team. And if I wanted to be a real prick, I would've just slipped in a comment on Euro 2000, but I'm not going to take a cheap shot on a player like Del Piero.\n\nRe: Francesco Totti vs Alessandro Del Piero\n\nby Patrick Bateman Tue Aug 16, 2011 3:11 am\n\nJuvenelCuore wrote:Totti had loyalty ?\n\nWhat did Del Piero have ?

All I did was defend the arguments going against him, some of which were completely unfair. I said from the beginning that we cannot claim which one is better because a) we have our huge preferences and b) there's very little between them if anything at all. But I for one was able to put aside my admiration for Totti for such a discussion. My goal here was not to convince you that Totti was and/or is better. My intent was to avoid the shit parade on Totti which always comes around on this forum when his name is mentiond.\n\nRe: Francesco Totti vs Alessandro Del Piero\n\nby JuvenelCuore Tue Aug 16, 2011 4:46 am\n\nWell that was not my intention either, because believe me as I said if I wanted to shit all over Totti I would have gone ad hominem and said he is malicious, rude, and this and that ... the typical arguments which serve no relevance.\n\nRe: Francesco Totti vs Alessandro Del Piero\n\nby juve_gigi Tue Aug 16, 2011 5:44 am\n\nI think any reasonable person who knows Italian football would conclude that:\n\nA. Roberto Baggio is the greatest Italian player ever, and\n\nB. Del Piero was a greater player than Totti\n\nIf you don't believe me then please conduct a poll that excludes Roma and Juventus fans, that would be the fairest way to do this.\n\nYou can compare goals and assists and number of appearances and number of trophies won, etc., etc., but the bottom line is Del Piero is generally considered the second or third greatest Italian player ever, Totti is never even in the discussion. I talked to my best friend today who is a Milanista (has been a Milanista for 25 years), and he told me the same thing. He said Totti wasn't even in his top ten greatest Italian players.\n\nAgain, you are looking at Baggio, Del Piero, Boniperti, Rivera, Riva and Paolo Rossi before you are even looking at Totti, and that is just comparing strikers. But bottom line is there is really no comparison between Del Piero and Totti, Del Piero is clearly the better overall player.\n\nAnd if you want the BIGGEST evidence that Del Piero is greater than Totti, you just have to look at the 2007-2008 Serie A season. Juventus had just come back from Serie B and the very same year Del Piero is the top goal scorer in all of Serie A, winning the capocannoniere, at the age of 33!!! And Roma was second place that year in Serie A, 10 points ahead of just promoted Juventus. So Roma clearly had the better team that year. Think about that, Del Piero was 33 years old when he was the capocannoniere. Truly a legendary performance that Roberto Baggio could not even match. And yes Totti did win the capocannoniere the year prior in 2006-2007, but again Del Piero had just come back from Serie B with an inferior team and was 2 years older than Totti, so their is a big difference.\n\nThat in itself is proof beyond all doubt that Del Piero is probabaly the second or third greatest Italian player ever, right behind Roberto Baggio and maybe one other player.\n\nNo disrepect to Totti, he is and was a great player, but not at the level of Baggio or Del Piero."
