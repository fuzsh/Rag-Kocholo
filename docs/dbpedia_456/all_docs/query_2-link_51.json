The young forward with the streak of blond hair came on in place of Ruggiero Rizzitelli when coach Vujadin Boskov decided to shuffle his pack. “When the gaffer told me to warm up I thought he was talking to Roberto Muzzi sat next to me. As it turns out he had me in mind! I couldn't believe it, the emotions I felt were indescribable.”\n\nC is for Cristian and Chanel\n\nFrancesco's two children with his wife Ilary. In his own words, “they are the joys of my life”.\n\nD is for Derby\n\nTotti is the king of derby goals in the league, having hit the back of the net 11 times against cross-city rivals Lazio. He has often celebrated these extra-special strikes with t-shirts made for the occasion – the one that bore the message 'I have purged you again' will live long in the memory of Romanisti everywhere.\n\nE is for Euro 2000\n\nThis was the competition that made his name on the international scene, showing the whole world the talent and class of the Giallorossi superstar. With No. 20 on his back, Totti drove the Azzurri side coached by Dino Zoff all the way to the final, scoring key goals and putting in top-quality performances. He was chosen as Man of the Match in the tournament's showpiece event against France, despite Italy's shock defeat. The Italians had been ahead for almost the entire match, before a late strike from Sylvain Wiltord took the game into additional time where David Trezeguet's golden goal took the cup north of the Alps.\n\nF is for Fortitudo Luditor\n\nThe first team Francesco turned out for was the famous club in the area of San Giovanni in Rome, where he grew up. Totti started showing off his talent in a Luditor shirt from the age of seven.\n\nG is for 'Game over'\n\nThis was the message on the Captain's t-shirt after Lazio 1-2 Roma on 25 May 2015. The Giallorossi goals in this encounter came from Juan Iturbe and Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa. “That must have hurt, when you read 'Game over' you know there's nothing more you can do.” This was precisely the case for Stefano Pioli's Biancocelesti.\n\nH is for Hannover\n\nThe German city was host to Totti's return in an Azzurri shirt after injuring his ankle in February 2006. Head coach Marcello Lippi picked the Giallorossi legend in the starting line-up for his team's opening group-stage match in the World Cup against Ghana on 12 June 2006. Italy won the game 2-0 thanks to goals from Andrea Pirlo and Vincenzo Iaquinta. It was the first victory in a tournament that ended with the Azzurri lifting that famous trophy.\n\nI is for Ilary\n\nFrancesco's wife since 2005. The recipient of the t-shirt with the message reading 'You're the only one for me', which Totti unveiled after scoring in the Rome Derby in 2002. “She's a wonderful person and an even better mother.”\n\nJ is for Julio Cesar\n\nBrazilian goalkeeper, born in 1979. The Brazil legend has the misfortune of being between the sticks when Totti scored one of the best goals of his career – a chip that defied science and logic after he had run half of the pitch. Francesco beat Inter's stopper with a sublime finish that helped Roma to a 3-2 victory against Inter in the San Siro, their first in twenty years. “That goal in Milan was undoubtedly one of the best goals I have ever scored in my life.”\n\nK is for Kaiserslautern\n\nThe city where Totti scored the winning penalty against Australia on 26 June 2006 in the Round of 16 of the World Cup in Germany. Francesco was ice-cold from 12 yards, beating Mark Schwarzer with a perfect right-footed strike that flew into the top corner, sending Azzurri fans wild in the Fritz Walter Stadion. The goal took Italy into the last eight, one step closer to that memorable night in Berlin where Marcello Lippi's men won the World Cup for the fourth time in the country's history.\n\nL is for Walter Lapini\n\nThe first player to substitute Totti in a league or cup match. Francesco, who had just turned 17, started the third-round Coppa Italia tie against Sampdoria on 16 December 1993. Roma went on to lose the match on penalties, but the young lad's performance was enough to draw applause from the crowd. Upon returning to the bench, Totti was also greeted with compliments from all of his team-mates. His substitute, Lapini, was another player who promised great things, but the talented youngster from Tuscany wasn't able to leave the same mark in the history books as Francesco.\n\nM is for Franco Mancini\n\nThe first goalkeeper to concede to a Francesco Totti strike in Serie A on 4 September 1994, during a Roma v Foggia fixture. Wearing No. 9 on that occasion, the young Francesco repaid the faith shown in him by fellow Roman Carlo Mazzone.\n\nN is for Nordahl Gunnar\n\nThe last striker Totti overtook in the Serie A all-time goalscoring standings. The Giallorossi forward only has Silvio Piola in front of him now. The Swede was sat in second place until 17 March 2013 when Francesco scored against Parma. After he notched his 226th league goal, the entire stadium burst into a spontaneous standing ovation that lasted for minutes. His children Cristian and Chanel ran onto the pitch after the final whistle to celebrate the special moment with their dad, bringing Totti to tears as he embraced his little ones.\n\nO is for Olimpico\n\nThe Stadio Olimpico has been home to Totti's magic year after year, weekend after weekend for more than twenty years. His first goal in his home stadium came on 21 August 1994 during a pre-season friendly against Valencia, won 1-0 by the Giallorossi thanks to the 17-year-old's strike.\n\nP is for Parma\n\nOn 17 June 2001, Francesco Totti opened the scoring against the side from Emilia-Romagna in the game that would confirm Roma as Serie A champions. The match finished 3-1 with the Captain playing a starring role. Afterwards, he claimed the goal “was the most important that I have scored in my life”. Parma are also the team Totti has notched most goals against with 20.\n\nQ is for Quim\n\nThe Portuguese goalkeeper, born in 1975, was the first man between the sticks to let in a Francesco Totti goal in an international fixture, when Italy beat Portugal 2-0 in a friendly on 26 April 2000. The other strike came from Mark Iuliano.\n\nR is for Roma\n\nThe only club side Totti has represented throughout his entire professional career that began way back in 1993. In the Giallorossi legend's own words: “I could have gone to Real Madrid or Barcelona, but I wanted to be a Giallorossi for life. Lifting the Scudetto here was a unique feeling that I can't put into words. The love I have for our fans is worth much more than any titles or awards that I have won.”\n\nS is for Vito Scala\n\nFriend, 'brother' but above all fitness coach. This man has allowed Francesco Totti to carry on playing in Italy and Europe even though he has passed 40 years of age. He's worth a mention, for sure.\n\nT is for Torino\n\nOn 20 April 2016, Totti entered the fray a few minutes before the end of a Roma v Torino match. The Giallorossi were 2-1 down, with defeat set to have serious implications for the team’s pursuit of a third-place finish. The captain’s impact was extraordinary as he scored two goals with just two touches of the ball, first sliding in to convert a free-kick and then dispatching a penalty won by Diego Perotti. Epic.\n\nU is for UEFA Champions League\n\nTotti is the oldest player to have scored in Europe's premier club competition. When he hit the back of the net against CSKA Moskva in 2014-15, Francesco raised this record to 38 years and 59 days. It was previously held by Welshman Ryan Giggs, who bagged a goal at 37 years and 295 days.\n\nV is for Edwin Van der Sar\n\nThe goalkeeper for Holland's national team came up against Italy in the semi-finals of Euro 2000. Dino Zoff's Azzurri took the game to penalties against the tournament hosts and Totti stepped up to take one. Moments before he made the long walk to the spot, Francesco confided in Luigi Di Biagio: “I'm going to chip him”. True to his word, that's exactly what he did. It was a moment that made Totti a global superstar.\n\nW is for World Economic Forum\n\nThe event where footballing legend Pelè branded Totti “the best player in the world”. Coming from such an authoritative figure, it was something Francesco would never forget.\n\nX is for X\n\nThe Roman numeral for No. 10, the shirt that has become synonymous with Francesco Totti.\n\nY is for YouTube\n\nJust type the words 'Francesco Totti' into the video-sharing website and sit back and enjoy the great man's work. Writing about them and describing them is one thing, but seeing them in action is a completely different ball game.\n\nZ is for Zeman Zdenek\n\nThe Czech-Italian coach helped Totti more than anyone else at the beginning of his career, polishing the tactical and physical side of his game. He was also the first to hand Totti the captain's armband on 31 October 1998 during a league game against Udinese. Since then it has barely left his arm and for the Giallorossi, there'll only ever be one true Captain."
