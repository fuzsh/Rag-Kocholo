        "text": "Football is a game of friendship. For fans, it is a social outlet where you can meet people with the same passion for the beautiful game.\n\nHowever, it also extends to the pitch to those playing (and managing) the game we love. So, here are some of 90minâs favourite bromances - and partnerships - in the world of football.\n\n1. Frank Lampard & John Terry â England, Chelsea\n\nStarting with two icons of the English game, Lampard formed Terry a formidable bond. The two London-born boys were at the heart of Chelseaâs most successful era, leading the Blues to a historic Champions League triumph in 2012. They were also established internationals, earning a combined 184 caps for the Three Lions.\n\n2. Lionel Messi & Luis SuÃ¡rez â Barcelona\n\nAs soon as SuÃ¡rez joined Barcelona from Liverpool in 2014, it was clear that he and Messi would be unstoppable. In 2019 alone they scored a combined tally of 76 goals, and their time together at the Camp Nou means that their connection is just as prevalent off the pitch.\n\n3. Francesco Totti & Daniele De Rossi â Italy, Roma\n\nAn eternal bond born in the eternal city, Totti and De Rossi were the ultimate Giallorossi icons. They spent a wonderful 16 years together in Rome, reaching the pinnacle of world football when they won the World Cup with Italy in 2006. This year marked the end of an era, as both players finally left Roma for good.\n\n4. Ronaldinho & Deco â Barcelona\n\nWhile their Blaugrana careers crossed over for just four years, Ronaldinhoâs partnership with Deco brought new life to the Camp Nou. Their connection was pivotal to Barcelona, as the pair helped the Catalan club to two La Liga titles and the Champions League in 2006.\n\n5. Mario GÃ¶tze & Marco Reus â Germany, Borussia Dortmund\n\nDespite the individual quality and close bond of GÃ¶tze and Reus, their time together has been cut short due to several interludes. GÃ¶tze spent three years at rivals Bayern Munich in between his two stints at Borussia Dortmund, while Reusâ recurring injury problems have limited his time with the German national team.\n\n6. Steven Gerrard & Xabi Alonso â Liverpool\n\nGerrard and Alonso created a talented midfield anchor at Liverpool, with their strong chemistry crucial to the Redsâ success. They played a huge part in Liverpoolâs famous Champions League triumph, both scoring in the \"Miracle of Istanbul\" 14 years ago.\n\n7. Andrea Pirlo & Gennaro Gattuso â Italy, Milan\n\nTwo of Italyâs most gracious central midfielders played a key part in helping the Azzurri win their fourth World Cup in 2006. While sharing a fruitful friendship, Pirlo has also spoken of the other side of their relationship, describing in his autobiography how Gattuso âwould grab a fork and try to stick it in usâ.\n\n8. Cristiano Ronaldo & Marcelo - Real Madrid\n\nRonaldo and Marcelo had a wonderful relationship at Real Madrid, and a combination that began and ended thanks to Ronaldo's big money moves to Juventus in 2018. Their link-up play on the left side of the pitch was ruthless, and their time together helped them form a special bond.\n\n9. Zlatan IbrahimoviÄ & Maxwell â Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain, Ajax, Inter\n\nWhen looking for a bond in football that has stood the test of time, look no further than IbrahimoviÄ and Maxwell. First playing together in 2001, the Swedish striker and the Brazilian defender played together at four clubs in four countries, achieving success together wherever they went.\n\n10. Franck RibÃ©ry & Arjen Robben - Bayern Munich\n\nIn another partnership that just reached its conclusion, Ribery and Robben were the most feared midfield pair in Germany for years. After a decade together at Bayern Munich, 2019 marked the end of an era as both players announced their departures from the Bavarian club.\n\n11. Xavi & Iker Casillas â Spain\n\nEl ClÃ¡sico rivals throughout the season, Xavi and Casillas went from foes to friends when playing for the Spanish national team. The two had a tight bond and were a part of the record breaking La Roja side that won the countryâs first ever World Cup back in South Africa in 2010.\n\n12. Lionel Messi & Sergio AgÃ¼ero â Argentina\n\nWhile Messi has many strong relationships at Barcelona, one of his most special ones comes from the national team. He has played alongside Manchester Cityâs AgÃ¼ero for the last 13 years, as they go into this yearâs Copa America hoping to win for the first time since 1993.\n\n13. Olivier Giroud & Laurent Koscielny â France, Arsenal\n\nNow playing on different sides of London, Giroud and Koscielny remain teammates when they go for international duty with Les Bleus. They spent three years together at Arsenal from 2012 to 2015, before Giroud switched the Emirates for Stamford Bridge as he joined Chelsea.\n\n14. David Villa & Pepe Reina â Spain\n\nThis Spanish partnership was at its prime in the 2010 World Cup, despite Reina not playing a single minute. Villa was the star of the show in South Africa, and their bond was immortalised in their World Cup victory nine years ago.\n\n15. Thibaut Courtois & Eden Hazard â Belgium, Chelsea, Real Madrid\n\nIt seems that Courtois and Hazardâs relationship is reflected in their transfer history, from London to Madrid and vice versa. Courtois moved to Stamford Bridge a year after Hazardâs arrival, while Hazard recently earned his dream move to Real Madrid 11 months after Courtois made the same switch.\n\n16. Keylor Navas & Bryan Ruiz - Costa Rica\n\nThese Costa Rican teammates and friends both played a huge part in their countryâs immortalised World Cup campaign five years ago in Brazil, as they reached the quarter-finals of the tournament.\n\n17. David Luiz & Thiago Silva â Brazil, Paris Saint-Germain\n\nLuiz and Silva have formed a valuable friendship throughout their time together on and off the pitch, after years playing in a centre back partnership. They spent two years together at the heart of the Paris Saint-Germain defence, and strengthening their bond further while playing together for Brazil.\n\n18. Iker Casillas & Sergio Ramos â Spain, Real Madrid\n\nCasillas and Ramos spent ten years together at Los Blancos, with their time together in the national team strengthening their relationship even further. While Casillas moved on to Porto and Ramos remained at the Santiago Bernabeu, the two Real Madrid legends remain close friends.\n\n19. Pep Guardiola & Tito Vilanova â Barcelona\n\nFirst meeting at Barcelonaâs famed La Masia academy, Guardiola was a very close friend with the late Vilanova. They continued together in management, as Vilanova served as his assistant at Barcelona from 2008 to 2012, where they won 14 trophies together before Vilanova took over as manager.\n\n20. JosÃ© Mourinho & Rui Faria - Chelsea, Real Madrid, Manchester United, Porto, Inter\n\nMourinho met Faria at Porto when they both joined the club in 2002, winning the Champions League after two years. The Portuguese compatriots continued together as manager and assistant manager respectively, going on to work together at Chelsea, Real Madrid, Inter and Manchester United.\n\n21. Dani Alves & Neymar â Brazil, Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain\n\nAlves and Neymar first became friends while on international duty, with the latter entering the national team setup four years after Alves. Since then they have had trophy-laden careers, winning seven trophies at Barcelona and five trophies at Paris Saint-Germain together.\n\n22. Ãlvaro Morata & Giorgio Chiellini â Juventus\n\nWhile Morata only spent two seasons in Turin, he formed a strong relationship with Chiellini during that time. The duo won five domestic honours together in Italy, but missed out on the Champions League as they were beaten in the final by Barcelona in 2015.\n\n23. Diego GodÃ­n & Antoine Griezmann - AtlÃ©tico Madrid\n\nWith both Godin and Griezmann announcing that they would leave the Wanda Metropolitano at the end of the season, this year marks the end of a five-year era. The duo have an excellent relationship on and off the pitch, and were key in helping restore the Colchoneros to success.\n\n24. Lionel Messi & JosÃ© Pinto â Barcelona\n\nMessi makes another appearance on this list, though this time with Barcelonaâs former reserve goalkeeper. Despite Pintoâs limited game time with the Blaugrana during his six-year stint, he formed a strong bond with the Argentine and they remain close friends off the pitch.\n\n25. Mousa DembÃ©lÃ© & Jan Vertonghen â Belgium, Tottenham\n\nHaving earned their first senior Belgium call-ups within a year of each other, DembÃ©lÃ© and Vertonghen have a special bond that was further built on when they both joined Tottenham in 2012.
