Unfortunately, we can only put out 11 players, and Real Madrid are a team with so many amazing players over their history, so some big names have missed out!",

        "text": "Iker Casillas\n\nCasillas is one of the greats of the game. He won five league titles with his hometown club as well as three Champions Leagues. With Spain he won the European Championship twice and the World Cup.\n\nRoberto Carlos\n\nPossibly the finest player at the left back position, Carlos scored 71 goals for Real. Many of them came from his trademark free kicks and he helped the club to three Champions Leagues and four league titles.\n\nManuel Sanchís\n\nSanchís played in 710 official games for Real Madrid winning La Liga eight times and the Champions League twice.\n\nFernando Hierro\n\nAnother goalscoring defender - he has 102 league goals to his name with Real Madrid - Hierro was also known for his range of passing to compliment his solid defensive abilities. He won La Liga five times to go with three Champions Leagues.\n\nSergio Ramos\n\nRamos move to Real from Sevilla in 2005 and the rest is history. He scored the header in added time that gave Real their 10th European triumph, and he has come up trumps numerous times for Madrid over the course of his career. He has won everything there is to win at club and international level.\n\nLuis Figo\n\nHis move from Barcelona to Real ushered in the Galacticos era but Figo was undaunted by the immense pressure on his shoulders. His grace on the pitch was recognised in 2000 after he won the Ballon d'Or as a Real Madrid player.\n\nZinedine Zidane\n\nAn artist and one of the finest ever to kick a ball. The Frenchman - now Real Madrid manager - moved to Real from Juventus for a world record fee and his winning goal in the Champions League final at Hampden Park is widely regarded as the best in the tournament's history.\n\nGuti\n\nAn understated but crucial part of Real Madrid's successful late 90s/early 2000s team. Guti served as vice-captain and made over 500 appearances in white, winning five La Liga trophies and the Champions League three times.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo\n\nHe needs no introduction. He is Real Madrid's all-time record goalscorer, scoring at a rate of over a goal per game,and has won the Ballon d'Or a record five times. In 2016 he captained Portugal the European Championship.\n\nAlfredo Di Stefano\n\nRegarded by Pelé, Maradona, Bobby Charlton and Eusébio as the greatest football player of all time, Di Stefano was instrumental as Real Madrid won five consecutive European Cups in the 1950s.\n\nRaul\n\nHe holds the record for the most appearances made in the famous white shirt, and he is the second all-time goalscorer. He is behind only Ronaldo and Messi for goals in the Champions League and he earned over 100 caps for Spain.\n\nSpare a thought for:\n\nPlayers who missed out include: Ferenc Puskas, Francisco Gento, Jose Maria Zarraga, Emilio Butragueño, Hugo Sanchez, Ronaldo, Kaka and Mesut Ozil."
