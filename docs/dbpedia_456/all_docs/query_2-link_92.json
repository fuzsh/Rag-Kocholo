        "text": "The legendary Roma captain Francesco Totti rejected the possibility of becoming a coach after finishing his football career, although he had previously thought about it.\n\nToti stated that he will announce in June at the latest whether he will continue to play actively or if he will go to the officials.\n\n\"I'm thinking about my future, I've made a decision, but I'll announce it in May or June. I'm sure I won't be a coach, I don't want to be against 30 tricky footballers. There are three options, to continue playing at Roma, to become a director or to finish football and do something else - said the 40-year-old Toti to the Italian \"L'Intervista\".\n\nToti earned the status of a Roma legend because he spent his entire career at that club and repeatedly rejected rich offers from Real Madrid, Chelsea, Milan...\n\n\"I was close to moving to Real and I thought about leaving Rome. However, I didn't. What is certain is that I would never play for another Italian club,\" Totti said.\n\nToti has been in Roma since 1989, from the youth selections, and holds two club records - 778 games and 307 goals."
