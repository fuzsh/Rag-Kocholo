        "text": "by Franco Ficetola\n\n‘T he king of Rome is not dead’ was the statement printed on the white t-shirt Francesco Totti displayed almost exactly five years ago.\n\nIt came after a Serie A match during a period in which some people felt Totti’s career was already finished and that he was unable to keep the pace with younger players. Totti wore that t-shirt on 1st May 2011, the day AS Roma beat Bari 3-2. Totti, then 34, scored two goals, silencing those who believed in his decline.\n\nIt’s been a long time since that day, but in 2016 we can still say that, despite his age, the king of Rome is not dead. At all. In the last six Roma matches, Totti played 132 minutes in total, his reduced playing time from manager Luciano Spalletti causing a huge stir among Roma supporters.\n\nRage against the dying of the light\n\nTotti’s longest period of game time came against Bologna, on April 11th, when he showed his genius for the whole second half, giving Mo Salah a perfect ball to score the equaliser in a 1-1 draw.\n\nOn April 17th, Totti played another 12 minutes, in the really hostile Atleti Azzurri d’italia Stadium in Bergamo, against Atalanta. In a venue historically complicated for them, Roma were losing 3–2 when Totti worked things out with a wonderful shot from outside of the box, leading his team to a valuable draw.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnaUlIye64A\n\nThree days later, Totti made the magic happen again, but this time it looked like a miracle: playing for only four minutes plus added time, he succeeded in scoring two goals against the until-that-point almost perfect Torino, allowing Roma to win 3–2 – moving commentator Carlo Zampa to tears in the process (skip to 3.40s for Totti’s goals):\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXN2xpy87gs\n\nOn April 25th, Roma played Napoli in a crucial match for Giallorossi in their chase for second place in the table. Totti entered the pitch on 81 minutes, lighting up Roma’s game and starting the move that ended with Nainggolan’s goal.\n\nSERIE A: ALL-TIME APPEARANCE RECORD (as at 10.5.2016)\n\nPaolo Maldini – 647 appearances\n\nJavier Zanetti – 615 appearances\n\nFrancesco Totti – 600 appearances\n\nAway to Genoa, with Roma losing, Totti played the last 31 minutes, firing in a free kick on 77 minutes and guiding the team to the 2–3 victory.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dw6SmTeciPM\n\nFinally, on his 600th appearance in Serie A, against Chievo Verona, Totti played another cameo 31 minutes, serving Miralem Pjanic an insane assist to make it 3-0.\n\nBottom line is that Roma owe to the Capitano at least 11 of the last 14 points they have earned in recent weeks. But that’s not the point. The point is that when Totti enters the field, rivals are scared of him. Despite his age, he still possesses that charisma that allows him to revitalise the whole team, giving them motivation when they are tired or dejected.\n\nFrancesco Totti frenzy\n\nPeople on the terraces start yelling his name when he starts warming up, let alone when he’s on the field kicking the ball. They watch Totti instead of the match.\n\nTotti carries the heart of every single supporter with him on the pitch; he doesn’t play for himself, he plays for Roma and for the city of Rome, and also for every football lover who’s watching him in that moment, whether in a sports pub next to Olimpico Stadium or inside the headquarters of Indonesia’s Roma supporters club.\n\nTo understand why Francesco Totti is all this, one just has to take a look at his career. His current season is Totti’s 24th wearing the red-and-yellow shirt. It was 28th March 1993 when Vujadin Boškov decided to throw that 16-year-old blonde boy in, during a Brescia versus Roma match – a lifetime ago.\n\nWhat were other Roma’s current squad players doing while Totti made his debut in Serie A?\n\nSeydou Keita’s first professional team (JS Centre Salif Keita) wasn’t even founded, and the Malian midfielder was 13, chasing a ball through the streets of Bamako.\n\nDaniele De Rossi was a 9-year-old blond-haired rascal, growing up in Rome district of Ostia; he was already a Roma enthusiast, and would join AS Ostia Mare four years later, playing as forward.\n\nEdin Džeko had just turned seven and couldn’t go playing football with his friends because Sarajevo was under siege, during the Bosnian War. Wojciech Szczęsny and Miralem Pjanić were two, and they probably didn’t know much about football.\n\nGerman defender Antonio Rüdiger was born in Berlin 25 days before Totti’s debut, and when Roma’s youngest player Ezequiel Ponce was born, on 29th March 1997, Totti had already celebrated the fourth anniversary of his first appearance in Serie A.\n\nAll this gives an idea of how many generations of footballers Totti has been through, scoring 304 goals in the process.\n\nA sendoff like Kobe\n\nTotti’s current contract with AS Roma expires in June. There have been many rumours in recent months about chairman James Pallotta being unwilling to grant Totti a one-year contract for next season, but this was until the victory over Napoli.\n\nAfter that match Pallotta seems more inclined towards the idea of extending Totti’s contract, maybe planning to turn his last season into a giant media event, something similar to what Los Angeles Lakers did for Kobe Bryant in his last year as a basketball player. However, there’s still nothing certain about it, and a real negotiation hasn’t even started yet.\n\nSEE ALSO: Rome Derby – When Roma and Lazio ruled Italy\n\nWhat is certain is that after the last six matches, nobody can be blind to the fact that Totti is still very useful to the team.\n\nWe could say that he deserves the renewal of the contract because of his history, because he once had the chance to play for Real Madrid but instead decided to stay in the city he loves. We could simply say that it’s a matter of respect, because he devoted his whole life to Roma. ‘Respect’ is the word used most often when debating this affair.\n\nBut there’s something more than respect. There’s a player still able to invent passages that other players can’t even imagine, for example. And a man who could lead Roma to win something next season, adding to his technique the above-mentioned charisma.\n\nA proper usage of Totti, rationing his appearances during the season to preserve him from too much fatigue, can bear fruit, for he still has the key to resolve the hardest matches. Letting him go at the end of this season would mean squandering an incalculable amount of talent and personality.\n\nSome people say that today’s football is no longer for players born in the 1970s. Well, I guess these people didn’t watch that Roma versus Torino match, because it’s clear that there’s still something Il Capitano can give to the wonderful game.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, the king of Rome is not dead.\n\nFollow Just Football on Twitter @JustFootball or Facebook for more football news, features and analysis from around the globe.
