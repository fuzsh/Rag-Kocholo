        "text": "Referee Michael Oliver has \"a bag of rubbish for a heart\", says Gianluigi Buffon after Juventus were knocked out of the Champions League by Real Madrid.\n\nEnglish official Oliver awarded an injury-time penalty to Real for Mehdi Benatia's foul on Lucas Vazquez and Buffon was sent off for his reaction.\n\n\"It was certainly a dubious incident. Not clear-cut,\" Buffon told Italian TV.\n\nBuffon also told Italian media that Oliver should \"sit in the stands eating crisps\" for \"ruining a dream\".\n\nReal had led 3-0 after the first leg, but saw their advantage wiped out at the Bernabeu through two Mario Mandzukic headers and Blaise Matuidi's opportunistic strike after Keylor Navas' error.\n\nBut with the tie heading to extra time, Oliver adjudged Juve defender Benatia guilty of bringing down Vazquez in the box and pointed to the spot.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo then stepped up to coolly place the 97th-minute penalty into the top corner.\n\nBuffon took his protestations too far and was given his first Champions League red card on his 650th appearance for Juve.\n\nThe Juve captain said after the game: \"It was a tenth of a penalty.\n\n\"I know the referee saw what he saw, but it was certainly a dubious incident. Not clear-cut. And a dubious incident at the 93rd minute when we had a clear penalty denied in the first leg, you cannot award that at this point.\n\n\"The team gave its all, but a human being cannot destroy dreams like that at the end of an extraordinary comeback on a dubious situation.\n\n\"Clearly you cannot have a heart in your chest, but a bag of rubbish. On top of that, if you don't have the character to walk on a pitch like this in a stadium like this, you can sit in the stands with your wife, your kids, having your drink and eating crisps.\n\n\"You cannot ruin the dreams of a team. I could've told the referee anything at that moment, but he had to understand the degree of the disaster he was creating.\n\n\"If you can't handle the pressure and have the courage to make a decision, then you should just sit in the stands and eat your crisps.\""
