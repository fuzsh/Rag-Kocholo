        "text": "biography\n\nBorn Karl Oscar Tore Johansson in Stockholm, Sweden on October 19, 1903, B-movie legend Tor Johnson began his studio wrestling career in the 1940s as \"The Swedish Angel,\" after doing many bit parts and uncredited appearances in films in the 1930s. His first film was the Warner Bros./First National drama Registered Nurse (1934; with Bebe Daniels, Lyle Talbot, and Sidney Toler). By virtue of his potentially frightening visage, height, and weight, he appeared in numerous films. Becoming a cult figure in death, Johnson's 1950s and 1960s horror and science fiction movies, especially the films of Edward D. Wood Jr, have ensured Johnson's cult actor status. Several key films starring Johnson, including Plan Nine from Outer Space (1959; with Bela Lugosi and Gregory Walcott), entered the public domain in the 1970s and 1980s and saw lots of late-night television airplay. Interestingly, Johnson had a longer and more successful career in Hollywood than most of Wood's other regulars, acting in many films and making a number of appearances on TV into the early 1960s.\n\nToday, Johnson is best known for his appearances in the Edward D. Wood Jr classics Bride of the Monster (1955; with Bela Lugosi and Dolores Fuller) and Plan Nine from Outer Space (1959). However, thanks to Mystery Science Theater 3000, some of Johnson's other films have been rediscovered by cult film fans, such as The Unearthly (1957; with John Carradine, Sally Todd and Allison Hayes) and The Beast of Yucca Flats (1961; directed by Coleman Francis).\n\nthe films of tor johnson\n\nBehind Locked Doors (1948)\n\nTor Johnson is sadistically tormented in a sanitarium in the film noir thriller Behind Locked Doors\n\nThe Lemon Drop Kid (1951)\n\nFrom the Paramount comedy The Lemon Drop Kid with Bob Hope\n\nBride of the Monster (1955)\n\nTor Johnson menaces Loretta King in Bride of the Monster\n\nThe Black Sleep (1956)\n\nFrom The Black Sleep.

He also drank copious amounts of beer (usually a case at a time), and dessert for Johnson often included gallons of ice cream. Plagued by heart problems in his later years, Johnson passed away from heart failure at age 67 on May 12, 1971. Tor Johnson's son, Karl, was once a policeman in San Fernando, California; in addition, he appeared in a few of his father's movies, such as The Unearthly and Plan Nine from Outer Space. Karl Johnson passed away on May 15, 1993, at age 69."
