She was born December 22, 1945 in Cyclone, W.Va., a daughter of the late Stacy and Wavy Osborne Daniels. Juanita was a 1965 graduate of Oceana High School. She was a retired school bus driver for the Wyoming County Board of Education. She enjoyed listening to gospel music, fishing, sitting on the back porch with Wannis and just being around family and friends talking, laughing, and reminiscing about the “good ole days”. In addition to her parents, she was preceded in death by a sister and brother-in-law Cindy and Buddy Price, son-in-law Mark Toler; a brother Minnis Osborne, great-granddaughter Kadence Moore; a special aunt whom she was caretaker for, Lena Osborne and the love of her life, Edmond D.
