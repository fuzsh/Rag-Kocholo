OK, take a deep breath now and let it out slowly. If you are a serious Charlie Chan fan your initial reaction might be to pommel me with innuendos, barbs, insults and possibly a face slap or two. But wait! If only…\n\nSo was there ever a Charlie Chan PEZ dispenser?\n\nCould it be? Was there really one? That is a question I can answer for you unequivocally, “No, there was never a Charlie Chan PEZ dispenser.” But why not? Let’s take a look at some of the PEZ dispensers over the years. Some within my own (sorry to admit this) bygone collection of 450+ dispensers…\n\nB-Movies?

A new mystery to carry on with Author Biggers’ storyline. We have it now in: Death, I Said: A Charlie Chan Mystery by John L. Swann” Nicholas K. Burns Publishing, NY, 2023 Both I,…\n\nValentine’s Day 1779 was not exactly a Bed of Roses for Discoverer Capt. James Cook.\n\nIf you know the history of Hawai’i like I do (OK, like the internet and me.)
