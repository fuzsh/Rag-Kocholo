Stereotypical black man? “Confucius say” style of speech? The only thing a Secret Service man said all he wished to learn of the Germans and Japanese “is what I can get lookin’ over a rifle sight.” Or should I focus on the honestly enjoyable murder-mystery?\n\nHmm. After some thought I have fallen on the side of, sweet christmas this is offensive! I am glad to have seen it, since at long last I understand where the wonderful Peter Sellers’ terrible, racist impressions of Chinese people came from! To learn what I am talking about, please see The Pink Panther Strikes Again and Murder By Death. They both have their merits as films. So does this one, truth be told. Or you can watch any of the thousands of films that are not nearly as horribly offensive."
