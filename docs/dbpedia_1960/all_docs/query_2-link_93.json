        "text": "Roland Winters, an actor whose film portrayals included Charlie Chan and Elvis Presley's father, died of a stroke on Sunday at the Actors' Fund Nursing Home in Englewood, N.J. He was 84 years old.\n\nMr. Winters succeeded Warner Oland and Sidney Toler as the Confucius-quoting Chinese detective, appearing as Chan in six films. He told friends he could have played Hamlet, but he would be known for playing Charlie Chan.\n\nMr. Winters made more than 80 films, including ''Captain Carey, U.S.A.'' with Alan Ladd, ''The West Point Story'' with James Cagney, ''So Big'' with Jane Wyman, and ''Blue Hawaii,'' with Elvis Presley.\n\nHe appeared on Broadway in ''Calculated Risk,'' ''Country Girl,'' ''Cook for Mr. General,'' ''Who Was That Lady I Saw You With?'' and ''Minnie's Girls.''"
