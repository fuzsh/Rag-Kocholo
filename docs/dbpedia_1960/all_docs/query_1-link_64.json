Every year they went to the Super Bowl together and could always be found at Keeneland during the spring and fall meets.\n\nMost of his life was spent at the Estil County Golf Course, socializing with his friends.\n\nHe was young at heart and loved to stay around his young friends, having lobster and elk dinners on New Year's Eve, July 4th, and Super Bowl Sunday. He always was a snappy dresser, and his wife, Nancy always said he was \"movie star\" handsome, looking like Robert Mitchum.\n\nIn the 1960's - 1990's, his late wife, Nancy, and he loved to dance. They stole the dance floor but never had one professional lesson or training.\n\nHe lived life to the fullest extent and fought hard not to leave. With his passing ended an entire generation of his family. He took his last breath for all of them. I once asked Dad, \"What do you believe happens to you when you die.
