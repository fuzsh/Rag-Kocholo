Weight: 6 Ibs. 10 oz. Daughter’s birth rated a 51-gun salute, a quarter-hour’s pealing of church bells (a son—who would have been the first male heir to the throne in 62 years—would rate 101 guns, a half-hour’s bell-ringing).\n\nMarried. Mary Spencer Churchill, 24, pretty, apple-cheeked, youngest daughter of Winston; to Captain Christopher Soames, 26, Coldstream Guardsman, assistant military attache at the British Embassy in Paris; in London (see FOREIGN NEWS).\n\nDied.

Nelson (now head of the Society of Independent Motion Picture Producers); of a liver ailment; in Hollywood.\n\nDied. Kenneth Craven Hogate, 49, hefty Hoosier publisher of the Wall Street Journal, president of Barren’s Publishing Co., chairman of Dow, Jones & Co., Inc. (financial ticker service), close friend and 1944 presidential campaign adviser of Thomas E. Dewey; of a cerebral hemorrhage; in Palm Springs, Calif.\n\nDied. Colonel Earle L. Johnson, 52, national commander of the Civil Air Patrol, when an engine of the Army C45 he was piloting exploded, plunged the plane 2,000 feet to the ground, near Cleveland.\n\nDied. General Phya Phahon Phon Phayuhasena, 60, moonfaced, swashbuckling onetime strong man of Siam, leader of the 1933 coup d’etat which eventually resulted in the abdication of the late King Prajadhipok, for five years premier and dictator, briefly in 1941 a yellow-robed, Buddhist beggar-monk; of a cerebral hemorrhage; in Bangkok.\n\nDied. Sidney Toler, 74, veteran stage & screen actor, onetime leading man to Julia Marlowe, best known in recent years for his bland cinemacting of Chinese Detective Charlie Chan; of intestinal cancer; in Hollywood.\n\nDied. Dr. Douglas Sladen, 91, globetrotting journalist, professor, jack of many literary trades, founder of the modern British (1897) Who’s Who, which he edited for three years (he is represented in the 1946 edition with a fat 66 lines, mostly listing his 50-odd books); in Hove, England."
