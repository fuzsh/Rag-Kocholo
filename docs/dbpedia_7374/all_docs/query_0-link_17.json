        "text": "Final WWF PPV appearance for Matt Borne, aka the original Doink the Clown. He would reprise the gimmick on the Raw 15th Anniversary battle royal in December 2007, as well as the independent circuit until his death in 2013.\n\nHulk Hogan was originally scheduled to lose the WWF Championship to Bret Hart at this event. However, Hogan privately told Vince McMahon that Hart was not in Hogan's league, and refused to \"do the honours\" for Bret. As consolation, McMahon booked Hart to win the 1993 King of the Ring tournament, while Hulk ended up dropping the title to Yokozuna instead."
