        "text": "Craig Wilson\n\nWith Summerslam mere weeks away, the hype towards the event is underway on the blog. With the USP of this blog being a look at wrestling with one eye on the past, it makes sense to look at Summerslams from history and what was going on in the WWF leading up to those events. Starting, today, with this look at the lead up to Summerslam back in August 1993. So, without further ado, let’s all board the Lex Express.\n\nThe summer of 1993 in the WWF was the tale of two American heroes: the recently departed Hulk Hogan and the man that Vince wanted to position as the new Hulkster, Lex Luger. Hogan’s initial departure of the man that had been at the forefront of ‘Rock n Roll Wrestling’ and the 80s boom period had hurt the company.\n\nIt was no surprise, then, that with ratings down in early 1993 Hogan was brought back with the belief being that he would boost ratings. However, even in the cities that would have previously been considered his heartlands the attendances were down. In the end, June’s King of the Ring pay per view was his final televised appearance – he fulfilled a European tour soon afterwards – until his return in 2002.\n\nJune saw the WWF turn the annual house show King of the Ring into a PPV event and it’s fair to say that the inaugural pay per view outing for the former house circuit staple was a strong one. Bret ‘The Hitman’ Hart defeated three different wrestlers – Mr. Perfect, Razor Ramon and Bam Bam Bigelow – in three very contrasting matches to be crowned King of The Ring.\n\nThe original plan for Summerslam 1993 was meant to be Bret Hart defeating Hulk Hogan for the WWF title. Hogan refused this idea and dropped the gold to Yokozuna. Any hope that Hart’s King of the Ring win would slot him straight back into the title picture were extinguished at the coronation ceremony where Memphis Wrestling legend Jerry ‘The King’ Lawler attacked him. The feud between the pair would last several years and we see Hart battle not only Lawler but various villains that Lawler brought in such as Issac ‘Kane’ Yankem.\n\nHogan’s appearance in the King of the Ring title match is remembered for the cheap finish in his title match with Yokozuna with Hogan seemingly unwilling to drop the belt clean. Sure, the disastrous finish at Wrestlemania 9, where he bested Yoko mere minutes after he had defeated Bret Hart for the strap, was much worse but still. In the history of the business an outgoing star nearly always went out of their way to pass the torch. It seemed Hogan was very much unwilling to do this.\n\n“Forgettable” is perhaps the best word to describe Hogan’s time with the company in 1993 and his fourth title reign – a topic I’ve covered elsewhere on this blog (https://ringthedamnbell.wordpress.com/2013/07/10/looking-back-at-hulk-hogans-1993-wwf-run/). As for the man that Vince saw as the best fit to replace the man behind Hulkamania, well, Luger’s run with the WWF until that point was arguably as unremarkable.\n\nSince debuting as part of the failed World Bodybuilding Federation, Luger’s run with the WWF until the summer of 1993 had amounted to very little. His run as “The Narcissist” screamed mid card but it was the little focus on the character that made the transition from heel to good guy and to be the new hero of the fans that much easier.\n\nAfter regaining the WWF title at King of the Ring, Yokozuna celebrated on Independence Day by challenging athletes throughout the world of sports to attempt to slam him on U.S.S. Intrepid. When Luger slammed the WWF champion on the decommissioned aircraft carrier built during World War II for the United States Navy, his face turn was complete.\n\nWhat followed was a tour of America taking in various cities on the ‘Lex Express’ as Luger campaigned for a title shot against the huge Polynesian at Summerslam. A title shot was given to him but the contract had a clause and that was if Luger couldn’t defeat Yoko for the title then he wouldn’t get another chance. He won by count out in the end but that wasn’t enough and the full throttle Lex Express push came to a grinding halt.\n\nThe rest of the matches that featured on the Summerslam card featured little fanfare and had an air of being thrown together about them. Tatanka and Sherri Martel were set to face Luna Vachon and Bam Bam Bigelow but Sherri was let go and in the end the Native American teamed with The Smokin’ Gunns against the Best from The East and The Headshrinkers.\n\nTwo matches that had at least some build up saw Mr. Perfect tangle with Shawn Michaels for the IC title in a feud that began at Wrestlemania and The Undertaker take on Harvey Whippleman’s latest charge Giant Gonzales who debuted by attacking The Undertaker at that year’s Royal Rumble.\n\nThe Steiner’s defending the tag belts against Smokey Mountain Wrestling’s The Heavenly Bodies received little build up – although was a very good match – whilst Marty Jannetty seemed an unlikely choice to stand up for America against Ludvig Borga – Jannetty was originally scheduled to team with Crush against Doink 1 and Doink 2. Elsewhere, this was also the final PPV match for The Million Dollar Man Ted DiBiase who faced Razor Ramon.\n\nSo perhaps Summerslam 1993 is rightly regarded as a missed opportunity and should have seen Hulk Hogan pass the torch to Bret Hart but in the end Vince and co went with what they thought was the better option, namely Lex Lugar. What you can’t deny is that Summerslam 1993 is a surprisingly solid event despite the lack of real storylines going into the event. But that’s a post for another day…"
