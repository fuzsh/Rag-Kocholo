        "text": "This summer I'll be looking back on each of the previous Summerslam events, one by one. Every few days I will submit a new topic until we reach 2014's edition of the 2nd biggest brand in WWE.\n\nThis thread will be for discussing.... Summerslam 1993!\n\nSummerslam 1993 took place on August 30, 1993. It was held at The Palace of Auburn Hills in Auburn Hills, Michigan. Here are the results of the matches from this show:\n\n0. Owen Hart defeated Barry Horowitz in a singles match (08:32)\n\n1. Razor Ramon defeated Ted DiBiase in a singles match (07:32)\n\n2. The Steiner Brothers (Rick and Scott) (c) defeated The Heavenly Bodies (Tom Prichard and Jimmy Del Ray) (with Jim Cornette) in a tag team match for the WWF Tag Team Championship (09:28)\n\n3. Shawn Michaels (c) (with Diesel) defeated Mr. Perfect by countout in a singles match for the WWF Intercontinental Championship (11:20)\n\n4. Irwin R. Schyster defeated The 1-2-3 Kid in a singles match (05:44)\n\n5. Bret Hart defeated Doink the Clown (with Jerry Lawler) by disqualification in a singles match (09:05)\n\n6. Jerry \"The King\" Lawler defeated Bret Hart by disqualification in a singles match (06:32)\n\n7. Ludvig Borga defeated Marty Jannetty in a singles match (05:15)\n\n8. The Undertaker (with Paul Bearer) defeated Giant Gonzalez (with Harvey Wippleman) in a Rest in Peace match (08:04)\n\n9. Tatanka and The Smoking Gunns (Billy and Bart) defeated Bam Bam Bigelow and The Headshrinkers (Fatu and Samu) (with Afa and Luna Vachon) in a tag team match (11:15)\n\n10. Lex Luger defeated Yokozuna (c) (with Mr. Fuji and Jim Cornette) by countout in a singles match for the WWF Championship (17:58)\n\nNow, here are some discussion questions concerning the event:\n\nWhat was your favorite match on this show, and why did you like it the most? What about the worst match of this show, why did you like it the least?\n\nIf you could change a few things about Summerslam 1993, what would it be and why?\n\nYou may only use wrestlers who were available at the roster at that time or make changes that could have realistically taken place in August 1993. Please keep in mind the situations going into the show such as who could actually have been pushed into a title match, or what songs existed back then if you wanted to change the show's theme music, and so forth.\n\nYou may only discuss Summerslam 1993 in this thread. The remaining Summerslam events will be getting their own retrospective threads, any posts regarding other events will be considered spam and you risk getting an infraction.\n\nDiscuss!\n\nWe're into the New Generation now and the transition seemed a little rough earlier in the year with WrestleMania but things were looking better by SummerSlam. Just two months earlier no one would have expected Lex Luger to be the top face challenging Yokozuna for the title in the main event but the WWF did a great job building Luger up with the Lex Express campaign. That falling apart after SummerSlam is another story.\n\nLooking at the card the obvious choice for favorite match would seem to be Mr. Perfect vs. Shawn Michaels. That's not the case for me. It was a good match but when you say Mr. Perfect vs. Shawn Michaels for the IC title at SummerSlam you would think five star classic. It just didn't happen and while not a bad match I was definitely disappointed. My favorite match was The Steiner Brothers vs. The Heavenly Bodies. Unlike the IC title match I did not have high expectations for this one. Mostly because I didn't know who the Heavenly Bodies were. I was impressed with the match, and while not a classic I think it was the best match of the night.\n\nMy least favorite match was Undertaker vs. Giant Gonzalez. For years I've defended Taker vs. Gonzalez at mania. I thought that was the right call. By SummerSlam the novelty of Gonzalez had worn off and the lame \"Rest In Peace\" stipulation did nothing to add to the match. This match was just boring as the feud had run its course. That leads me into the changes.\n\nThe Undertaker should have wrestled Mr. Hughes instead of Giant Gonzalez. That was the feud during the summer. That would have been a better match. I always thought Gonzalez was put in the match because Hughes left the company so quickly in 1993. While watching some old Raw episodes on WWE Network I saw the match with Gonzalez was announced while Hughes was still in the company. I thought Hughes was gone by SummerSlam but if not he should have had the match with Taker.\n\nI wasn't crazy about the six man tag. Rumor has it the original plan was Tatanka & Sensational Sherri vs. Bam Bam Bigelow & Luna Vachon. That would have been good but Sherri left the WWF during the summer. Instead of the six man I would have preferred Tatanka vs. Bigelow one on one. No need to involve the tag teams in this feud.\n\nThe match that's going to be discussed most is the main event. Should Luger have won the title? With the push he received going into SummerSlam it sure seemed like he should have. It's hard for me to wish for the change because I kind of like how it worked out in hindsight but going into the event I would have definitely put the belt on Luger that night.\n\nThis was the year the chickens came home to roost for WWF talent, Vince and the fans... From January 1993 onwards, 3 years of poor decision making began a big cascade effect that really showed most on this card.\n\nWhat decisions? Well Warrior's decisions from 1990-92 for one... not letting Rude have a short run with the belt, holding up Vince, the steriod bust on him... Hogan too with flat out refusing Rude as an opponent, picking Slaughter, not putting over Sid or Flair and then basically screwing Bret... Vince allowed a massive portion of proven talent simply leave over those 3 years, starting with Rude but major lynchpins of Summerslam were no longer part of the roster come 1993's event... There was no Tito Santana, Rick Martel, Big Bossman, LOD, Duggan, The Mountie and sacriligiously... Randy Savage... some were aging but most were having more than a fine time in WCW... Rude was the best heel in the business bar none, Bossman was transitioning back to his Bubba character but doing fine...\n\nThe final nail in this process was the end of Ted DiBiase's active WWE career, while he was still very much a valuable commodity at this show to Razor Ramon, sure they got their IC champ for the next 2 and a half years from it but the poor decision to axe Ted led to his ill fated Japan trip and like that, his career was gone.\n\nVince had brought in a massive number of cheaper new signings that in the main hadn't caught to replace these guys. Ramon till that point had been a dud, The Steiners hadn't caught the imagination in the same way LOD did as a debuting team, the Headshrinkers were buried under an awful stereotype 10 years out of date and even promising talent like Doink, Crush and Tatanka were beginning to feel politics wrecking their chances.\n\nThey were also relying on some \"older\" talent with a bit more name value like Mr. Perfect and Jerry Lawler rather than the proven guys they had active a year earlier like Savage and even Flair... Lawler was seen as a cheaper version of Flair by Vince, and the fans...\n\nAt the top of the card you had seen Hogan completely derail any value Bret had had with his Mania stunt. To this day there is no viable reason for how that whole situation could be \"good for business\". It ruined Bret, damaged Yoko almost irrepressibly and forced Luger onto the masses before he was ready.\n\nAh the Lex Express... what seemed a good idea at the time quickly became the worst idea of the year until Jim Crockett nailed a board across the walkway for Shockmasters entrance. Luger himself wasn't a bad pick but the fans had no time to get used to him even as the Narcissist before he'd 180's and was being literally rammed down people's throats... then he didn't win at Summerslam? It made it all redundant.\n\nWas the show itself terrible... hmmm bad but not terrible, the best matches were the ones with nothing riding on them... Bret v Doink was great as they sold Doink correctly in those days, before Borne got in strife and Apollo took over. DiBiase showed why Vince was mad to be letting him go and helped people see Razor as something more than the whole rest of the year had let him be and IRS v The Kid was a great if short contest.\n\nNo one who was really supposed to \"look good\" did though... Luger and Yoko both came out looking weaker for there not being a proper finish... even if they'd screwed Luger and had him pinned, it was better than what they gave. Ludvig Borga was supposed to be a monster and Jannetty did his best to sell the offense, but it was an awkward matchup and Shawn and Perfect vomited a match out seemingly... it was not what it could and should have been because neither trusted the other cos of the Janetty situation. Shawn screwed Marty, told Perfect and he not only told Vince but got Vince to re-hire Janetty and give him the belt as originally planned... You can imagine the tension between them...\n\nHow do you fix it?\n\nWell lets assume anyone gone is gone... no keeping Flair on or the like... Hogan has been a dick and refused to face Bret...\n\nFirst off you make the title vacant after King Of The Ring... there was enough shenanigans with Hogan's awful attempt at using flash paper to strike a line through it. As KOTR is done with it can't be for the belt but as Bret is King he is in the match for the title.\n\nThe 4th of July challenge still happens but with the stipulation that it will be Yoko v Bret unless someone can slam Yoko... cue the same thing happening, Savage gets close but Luger arrives and pulls it off.\n\nOf course this is not gonna be simple as Cornette is involved, he threatens to sue unless Yoko is involved and so what basically happens at Wrestlemania 10 happens now at Summerslam 90 with the 4th man in the equation being determined by a battle royal.\n\nAt the battle royale, Yoko reveals his alliance with newcomer Ludvig Borga and they severely \"injure\" Owen, Bret is powerless to stop the attack but Randy Savage manages to get Owen to safety by eliminating Borga from behind only to fall prey to the winner of the Battle Royal, Ted DiBiase.\n\nSummerslam arrives and Bret faces off against Yokozuna in the first match of the tournament... he is heartened when Owen recovers enough to come to be in his corner but Owen's temper gets the better of him and he inadvertantly costs Bret the match... Yoko thus advances. Next, Luger faces DiBiase who has purchased the services of Bam Bam Bigelow... Bam Bam manages to do a number on Luger during a ref bump but Luger rebounds to stun DiBiase with his \"illegal\" forearm and get the win.\n\nElsewhere on the card, Razor Ramon teams with Mr Perfect and the 1-2-3 Kid to take on Shawn Michaels, Jerry Lawler and the mysterious Doink with the stipulation that if Michaels is pinned, his IC title is lost. He does indeed lose... to the 1-2-3 Kid in a stunning upset.\n\nThe Steiners take on The Headshrinkers for the titles (WTF were they Smoking putting the Heavenly Bodies in that match, they can face the Gunns) and Borga faces Randy Savage with Savage getting a \"reverse decision\" when Borga refuses to stop attacking Randy after the bell... Savage is saved by the \"bell\" and darkness... When the lights come up Savage has gone and the Undertaker stands in the ring staring down Borga... I keep Taker off this show on purpose, he was better in no match than with Gonzales.\n\nFor an opener use IRS v Janetty - nice short match but Janetty deserved better than he got at the time.\n\nIn the main event, Lex defeats Yoko to lift the title when DiBiase and Bam Bam's interference backfires - this sets up DiBiase v Luger for the title and a face turn for Yoko to face Bam Bam..."
