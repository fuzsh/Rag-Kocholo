        "text": "home | wrestling | flashback_reviews | wwe | ptw\n\nWWF Survivor Series Showdown 1993 - November 21, 1993\n\nby Scrooge McSuck\n\n- I'm skipping over the SummerSlam Spectacular '93. That show has been recapped already on Da' Site by Samoa Rowe, and it wouldn't make much sense for me to do it again, since his opinions basically echoed mine. It's a show worth checking out for sure, especially the Cage Match. Funny tidbit... I have recapped it before, and it was, in fact, the first show I ever did a review for. Let's just say, it was awful and leave it at that.\n\n- Matches are taped from Bushkill, PA and Dehli, NY over the course of a few days earlier in the month. Commentary duties are being split up by the tandoms of Vince McMahon and Bobby Heenan, and Jim Ross and Gorilla Monsoon. It's a shame that Bobby Heenan left, he could've had some wonderful time calling action with all these guys. Yes, even Vince McMahon seemed good when doing PBP with Heenan.\n\n- Flashback, to yesterdays episode of WWF Superstars. Bret Hart was in action against Irwin R. Schyster, when interference from Mr. Fuji brought the match to an end. Before things could get out of hand, though, Bret's brother, Owen, made his way to the ring to prevent any shenanigans from taking place. Why is this worthy of a flashback? Because Fuji is manager of WWF Champion Yokozuna, and he's defending the title against Bret Hart later in the broadcast.\n\nDoink (the Clown) vs. Bastion Booger:\n\nSometime after SummerSlam, someone thought it was a wonderful idea to turn Doink (the Clown) babyface, after spending all of 1993 tormenting babyfaces, mostly Kona Crush, including bashing him over the head with a plaster-casted arm. Doink is scheduled to lead a team consisting of four Doink's against the make-shift team of Bam Bam, Booger, and the Headshrinkers. Doink comes to the ring riding a scooter, along with two buckets. One has confetti in it, the other... nothing. Booger comes to the ring with a pizza box, but most of the pizza is already gone. Doink offers Booger a ride on the scooter, but Booger isn't cool enough, and thus makes an ass of himself. Doink squirts Booger in the face with his flower, and the comedy continues as Booger jerks the arm of Doink, pulling out a long length of knotted fabric. Lockup into the corner, and Booger misses a punch. Whip to the corner, and Doink boots Booger's booty. Booger misses a charge to the corner, and Doink does the school boy trip on him. We spill outside the ring, with Booger ramming Doink into various objects at ringside. He sets Doink up against a ring post, and actually hits the move. Back inside, and Booger continues to do some crappy generic offense. Irish whip, and Booger with a back elbow, followed by some dancing. Booger hits the chinlock spot, making this match even more boring. Booger knocks Doink out of the ring with the weakest kick this side of Nikolai Volkoff. Back inside, and Booger crushes Doink in the corner with shoulders to the midsection. Booger drops a big leg, then does more choking. Irish whip, and Booger with a clothesline for no count, because Doink tapped his shoulders three times to trick him! Doink, in the confusion, rolls Booger up, and that does get a three count at 7:35. Blech... After the match, Doink spikes the pizza with tobassco sauce, and hilarity takes place as Booger sells the \"hot\" pizza more than anything else in the match.\n\n- Flashback to Superstars, a few weeks ago. Tatanka was taking on Ludvig Borga in a battle of the undefeated. Borga dominated most of it, but Tatanka kept fighting back, until timely interference from Mr. Fuji, and a steel chair in the hands of Borga, finally netted Tatanka his first loss after nearly 2-years in the WWF. Afterwards, Yokozuna made his way to ringside to banzai drop Tatanka, injuring him (kayfabe), and taking him out of the Survivor Series. His replacement on the team of the All-Americans? Mr. Patriotic himself, the Undertaker.\n\n- Raymond Rougeau is standing by for a special Interview with the All-Americans, the Steiner Brothers, the Undertaker, and their team Captain, \"Made in the USA\" Lex Luger. 1993 was a weak year, but I always held a soft spot for this main event. A lot of \"mediocre\" workers, but it just had a good feel for the time, and everyone had a purpose to the match. Luger had issues with Yokozuna and Borga, the Steiners were on-and-off with the Quebecers, and the Undertaker is the Wild Card. Cookie cutter interview, served to promote the upcoming PPV.\n\n- Flashback, again, to last month on Monday Night Raw... Bobby Heenan did a special interview in the ring with Crush, returning from an injury at the hands of Yokozuna and sporting some evil facial hair, and his \"new\" manager, Mr. Fuji. I'd like to note Fuji did manage Crush before, but his participation in Demolition was always ignored, so whatever. They call out Randy Savage for being selfish and not showing true friendship towards Crush, but Savage does his best to talk his way out of it. The end result is a major league beat-down on Savage. Two weeks later, Savage physically assaults Vince McMahon and violates the rules of being a color commentator by attacking a wrestler. Just one guess who that was...\n\nVirgil vs. Crush (w/ Mr. Fuji):\n\nThis is Crush's first \"high profile\" match since turning a new leaf, but Virgil isn't much of a step above true Jobber status. I'm sure a lot of people forgot that Virgil was still around at this point, but he was making occasional appearances, being squashed by the big guys like Crush or Diesel, up through the summer of '94. Crush is also going to be a substitution on the Foreign Fanatics, representing that evil foreign country of Hawaii. Crush attacks before the bell with some rights and a headbutt. Crush with a snapmare, followed by a rake of the eyes. The crowd chants USA, but since Crush is from the USA, it makes little sense. Maybe Danny Davis is really Canadian. Virgil with a boot to the face, followed by a diving clothesline. Crush rolls outside, and Virgil follows with a plancha! Back in the ring, and Virgil grabs a wristlock, but Crush fights free and knocks Virgil out with a crescent kick. Virgil attempts a comeback, but Crush maintains control and hammers away. Crush misses a charge to the corner, and Virgil with a sunset flip for a two count! Crush regains control, using choking and \"karate\" kicks. Virgil surprises a charging Crush with a boot to the face, then comes off the top rope with a clothesline. Virgil does his signature jabs, knocking Crush out of the ring. Virgil tries something from the apron, but Crush catches and rams him into the side of the ring. We actually get a \"Virgil\" chant as Virgil surprises Crush with a small package for a two count. Crush hammers away some more, but Virgil traps him in the Million Dollar Dream! Crush escapes that rather easily, and nails Virgil with a clothesline. Crush press slams Virgil across the top rope, then KO's Virgil with the Cranium Crush for the victory at 7:54. What an awful finishing move. A head squeeze. Even Andre the Giant didn't use that shitty of a move. Match was okay at times, but most punchy-kicky.\n\n- Flashback to a recent episode of Superstars... Razor Ramon was defending the Intercontinental Title against the Model, Rick Martel. Things are going fine for Martel, until some heel miscommunication among his upcoming Survivor Series partners and their managers caused him to be Counted-Out. After the match, all the heels argued, but peace is eventually made. You honestly think a team of a Model, a tax accountant, an atomic explosion survivor, and a leather-clad bodyguard isn't going to get along like a team consisting of four guys with alcohol and drug addictions?\n\n- We go the tasteless route, as it's time for an edition of Reo's Round-Up, with Special Guest Co-Host, Shawn Michaels, with his fake Intercontinental Belt. Reo is Bruce Prichard doing a pretty shameful imitation of Dusty Rhodes, for no other reason that to do a shameful imitation of Dusty Rhodes. They're going to visit the Hart House, and of course, it's all a set up, as \"Stu and Helen Hart\" are just two people with hair chests wearing masks bought on discount at the local Big Lots. The point is that Shawn is trying to say Owen is in the shadow of his brother, and uses the evidence of a giant poster of Bret Hart tacked against a wall, next to a microscopic picture of Owen. the defense RESTS! We end things with \"Stu\" playing with a Super Nintendo. Even Vince McMahon calls this shameful, so really, he must've loved it.\n\nMarty Jannetty vs. Irwin R. Schyster:\n\nBoth men are on opposing teams at the Survivor Series. Jannetty is teaming up with Razor Ramon, the 1-2-3 Kid, and Mr. Perfect to take on I.R.S.' team, which also consists of Diesel, Adam Bomb, and Rick Martel. Ramon vs. I.R.S. was being set up for the Royal Rumble, and Perfect had issues with Diesel, but everyone else is filler. We get some stalling to start. Lockup, and I.R.S. with a scoop slam. Lockup #2, and I.R.S. with a hip toss. Jannetty returns the favor with a scoop slam and hip toss of his own, followed by a dropkick that sends I.R.S. out of the ring. Back inside, and Jannetty works a wristlock. Irish whip, and I.R.S. puts Jannetty down with a shoulder block. Jannetty comes back with a drop toe hold, then clamps on the armbar. I.R.S. tries to escape with a hip toss, but Jannetty holds on. I.R.S. makes it to the ropes, then rolls outside for some stalling. Back inside, and Jannetty with a side headlock. I.R.S. counters with a head scissors, but Jannetty kips up to escape and applies a hammerlock. Irish whip leads to a criss-cross sequence, and Jannetty goes spilling out of the ring trying or something dumb. I.R.S. rams Jannetty into the steps, then heads back inside. Jannetty counters a suplex and rolls I.R.S. up for a two count. I.R.S. is up first, though, and drops an elbow on Jannetty. Chinlock time, then the abdominal stretch, and yes, he does use the ropes for leverage. Jannetty escapes with a hip toss, but misses a follow up elbow. Whip to the corner, but I.R.S. misses a charge. Jannetty with mounted punches while clinging to his tie. Jannetty with a running knee lift for a two count. Irish whip is reversed, and Jannetty surprises Irwin with a sunset flip for a two count. I.R.S. with a snap suplex on Jannetty for a two count of his own. Irish whip is reversed, and Jannetty with a diving back elbow for another two count. Irish whip is reversed again, and I.R.S. takes Jannetty's head off with the diving clothesline, complete with over-sell. The three count makes it official at 12:36. Match started off slow, but picked up well and had a nice end sequence, although I do get tired of the excessive use of the \"irish whip\" in Jannetty matches.\n\n- WWF Unbelievable Commercial. The joke is that some kid is trying to impress a PYT by acting like his favorite WWF Superstars, such as Randy Savage, Razor Ramon, Bret Hart, and Tatanka, but the woman only notices the REAL Randy Savage, and tells us not to fall for cheap imitations. This, coming from the same company that no only lampooned Randy Savage as \"The Nacho Man\", but then made an entire angle based on another guy playing Razor Ramon!!! Yes, Diesel too, but the commercial clearly has some kid imitating Ramon.\n\n- Raymond Rougeau is standing by for another interview, but this time he's with the Foreign Fantatics, along with their managers. It's like a game of Where's Waldo with all of the heels. You have the evil foreigners: Japanese Samoan Yokozuna, French-Canadian Jacques of the Quebecers, Finnish Envrionmentalist Ludvig Borga, and Hawaiian Crush, along with various managers, consultants, and talkers. Boring interview, mainly because everyone has a terrible accent and cuts pretty weak promos.\n\n- The Survivor Series Report, brought to us by Todd Pettengill. Now THERE'S a name I will always have trouble spelling. The Survivor Series will be held on Thanksgiving Eve, starting at 8 o'clock, from the Boston Garden in Wichita, KS Todd tells us that he wouldn't be surprised if there were to be some more changes for the card by the time the PPV hits the air. We run down the complete card, as well as footage from Superstars, where Doink used the video wall to torment Bam Bam Bigelow with multiple images of himself. Anyway, the card, as promised...\n\nThe All-Americans vs. The Foreign Fanatics!\n\nBret Hart, along with his brothers, Owen, Bruce and Keith, take on Shawn Michaels, and THREE of Jerry Lawler's Mystery Knights.\n\nDoink to the Fourth Power takes on the whacky random team of Bam Bam Bigelow, Bastion Booger, and Headshrinkers Samu and Fatu\n\nRazor Ramon leads Marty Jannetty, Mr. Perfect, and the 1-2-3 Kid against Irwin R. Schyster, Diesel, Rick Martel, and Adam Bomb\n\n...And for no reason, the Rock 'n' Roll Express will defend the SMW Tag Team Championships against the Heavenly Bodies! A south promotion represented in BOSTON makes total sense.\n\nWWF Championship Match:\n\nYokozuna � (w/ Mr. Fuji) vs. Bret \"Hitman\" Hart:\n\nI remember being pretty hyped for this one when it originally aired. It's the big rematch that headlined WrestleMania IX, and this time, Hulk Hogan won't be there to spoil the situation for either man. Sure, it's a throw-away match from a Monday Night Raw taping, but you take what you can get. For some reason, Yokozuna doesn't have Cornette with him. Maybe he was busy somewhere else the night they taped these matches. Hart attacks from behind and hammers away with rights. Hart comes off the ropes with a cross body, but Yokozuna catches and casually slams him. Yokozuna misses an elbow drop, and a dropkick from the Hitman sends the Champion out of the ring. Yokozuna, still in a daze, walks right into the ring post. Yokozuna slowly climbs back in through the ropes, but Hart crotches him and slaps on a sleeper hold. Yokozuna snaps him off, but Hart goes back to pounding away. Yokozuna shrugs it off again and floors Hart with a clothesline. Yokozuna works Bret over and rams him to the buckle. Yokozuna drops Hart with a headbutt, then kicks him out of the ring, no doubt giving Fuji an opprotunity to take a few cheap shots behind the referee's back.\n\nWe return from a commercial, and Hart is mounting a comeback. Yokozuna goes down to one knee, but nails Bret in the throat to break the momentum. Yokozuna with a snapmare, and now it's time for the VULCAN nerve lock, a traditional rest hold used by the Samoan Family. Hart fights back to his feet, but Yokozuna simply throws him over the top rope. Yokozuna heads outside, but gets rammed into the steps for his trouble. Fuji intervenes, distracting the referee long enough for Yokozuna to bash Bret across the back of the head with a steel chair. We take ANOTHER commercial break, and Yokozuna is beating the maple syrup out of Hart. Bret fights back, winning a slugfest, but he misses a dropkick, and Yokozuna follows up dropping a massive leg across the head of the Hitman. Yokozuna stalls, taunting fans at ringside. Yokozuna with choking in the corner, and he's really sucking some wind, now. Yokozuna misses a splash into the corner, opening the door for Hart to mount another comeback. Hart with clotheslines, and a Hart Attack version takes Yokozuna down for a two count. Bret knocks Fuji off the apron, then jumps into the arms of Yokozuna. Bret escapes the grip with some biting, then comes off the ropes with a bulldog for another two count. Bret comes off the second rope with an elbow drop for a two count. Hart ducks a clothesline, but gets slammed down with a belly-to-belly suplex. Yokozuna bounces off the ropes, and misses a splash. Hart gets back to his feet, and quickly takes advantage of the situation, applying the sharpshooter! For no other than to cause problems, Owen Hart comes to ringside, slapping hands of fans. Fuji sneaks in the ring and bops Bret with the salt bucket, so now Owen runs in, and blatantly cheats in full view of the referee, drawing a Disqualification and awarding the match to Yokozuna at 15:42. Despite the lame-ass finish, a very good encounter that would've been the great start and middle to a PPV main event. This would've been a much better option for a layout than what we got at WrestleMania IX.\n\n- We finish things off, getting final words from both broadcast teams. Monsoon makes threats towards Heenan, and Heenan responds by telling Monsoon to eat some bananas. I seem to recall the banter between Monsoon and Heenan becoming quite intense around this time, which of course lead to Monsoon literally throwing Heenan out of the WWF. The show finally ends, with a special Thanksgiving Rap from Men on a Mission. Yuck.\n\nFinal Thoughts: Only a few matches featured, but two of them were permited a generous amount of time for the era, and all four matches did their jobs, in their own way, I guess. All the in-between recapping stuff, once again, is a nice way to catch fans up with all the happenings leading up to the Survivor Series, and that's never a problem when it's balanced out with the matches. Throwing \"flashback\" after flashback on their, sandwiched by a butt-load of boring squashes is when it becomes tiring, because you just want to see SOMETHING meaningful. Good show, one of the better of these specials, and the last of the \"Survivor Series Showdown\" specials."
