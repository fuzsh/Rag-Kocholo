        "text": "Post by underjohngrohs on\n\nI'm back with my Summerslam Reviews: This time we are tackling the New Generation Era, by the end of the 1980s and the start of the 1990s, the WWF was bottoming out on the top guys from the 1980s like Hulk Hogan, Ultimate Warrior, Jake Roberts and other superstars. Vince would seek to it to begin a New Generation, a New Generation of stars like Razor Ramon, Shawn Michaels, Bret Hart, Lex Luger, Yokozuna and others. The WWF had beaten out every competition that there was, but their biggest threat came in the form of WCW. The WWF was in trouble, but could they fight back?.\n\nSUMMERSLAM 1993 - Auburn Hills, Michigan - August 30. 1993\n\nupload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8c/SummerSlam1993.jpg\n\nBefore Summerslam 1993:\n\nBy the start of 1993, the WWF was losing all of their big stars in Hulk Hogan, The Ultimate Warrior and others. At the King of The Ring, Yokozuna ended the reign of Hulkamania and sent him packing out of the WWF for good by winning the WWF Title for the second time. Yokozuna and his cohort Mr. Fuji was now sent to humilate America the worst by announcing a bodyslam challenge to see who would Bodyslam Yokozuna, NFL Superstars and WWF Superstars all accepted the call, but they could not bodyslam Yokozuna when suddenly on the USS Intrepid. Lex Luger showed up and shoved his former manager Bobby Heenan aside. He got in the ring face to face with Yokozuna. After tossing Fuji over the top rope to the floor. Luger bodyslammed Yokozuna to the mat and with the win. Luger earned himself a WWF Championship Match. After Luger's bodyslam heard around the world. Luger began campaigning around the United States. Also, In another grudge match. Bret Hart wanted to get his redemption on Jerry Lawler for Lawler ruining his King of The Ring Celebration as well.\n\nRamon/Dibiase: Summerslam kicked off with the Million Dollar Man taking on the Bad Guy Razor Ramon, now this was Dibiase's final match. I would've let Dibiase wrestle a few more times before calling it a career by late 1993 or possibly Early 1994 if I ran the WWF differently. This was not a bad match, the match did come about when Razor was humilated after The 123 Kid had defeated him. Razor eventually turned into a face and took The 123 Kid under his wing. Razor would win this match by hitting the Razor's Edge. The opening match would have to be a 3/5, not a bad match to be honest.\n\nThe Steiners/Heavenly Bodies: This was The Steiners's hometown match, so you probably would have to say that they would have to win here, no brainer. The match gets a 2/5. But the crowd really popped big for the Steiners in their hometown.\n\nMichaels/Perfect: Out of all 5 Summerslams, the Intercontinental Championship changed hands 5 times, but could it change for the sixth time. That question was determined when the greatest wrestler of the 90s took on Mr. Perfect, this was a great match. Michaels did of course have Diesel by his side. But Michaels and Perfect really clicked and it showed, Wasn't a Perfect Intercontinental Title Match, Michaels won the match by countout, but the match to me is another 3/5.\n\nIRS/Kid: The Kid had arrived to the WWF in May of 1993 after defeating Razor Ramon in a shocking upset, but he had to take one of the fresh talented WWF Superstars, of course the Tax Cheat, Irwin R. Shyster. The Kid's partner and friend Razor got the job done against Dibiase, but could The Kid get the job done against IRS. The answer was no. IRS was able to pick up the win, the match to me is still a 2/5.\n\nBret/Doink: The match was supposed to be Bret vs Lawler, but Lawler faked a knee injury. Yea!, it was fake. Lawler was just faking it so that he couldn't take on Bret. So Lawler hired Doink to do his dirty work. The match ended on a DQ with Lawler of course using his fake crutch to attack Bret. The match gets a 1/5. Nothing to shout home about.\n\nBret/Lawler: This was hardcore justice for the Hitman as he took on Lawler in this match. Bret and Lawler had great chemistry in the match and it really worked well, the match ended with Bret using the sharpshooter to Lawler and technically won the match. However. Bret continued to lock in the sharpshooter more and the referee had no choice but to award the decision to Lawler by DQ. The match gets a 3/5 although they put on a good match, but the ending was just asinine.\n\nBorga/Jannetty: This was easy peasy for Borga who had made his debut as he defeated Jannetty, so here's another 1/5.\n\nUndertaker/Gonzales: Okay possibly one of the worst feuds for The Undertaker ever, his feud in 1993 was so worse with Gonzales. The feud came about when Gonzales eliminated Undertaker from the 1993 Royal Rumble Match and it would continue to WrestleMania 9 when Gonzales used an ether to smother Undertaker in their match giving Undertaker the victory. Now honestly, I think it should've been Bam Bam Bigelow and Undertaker in 1993. Bigelow should've been a good opponent for The Undertaker, not discounting that. But Man, Gonzales was terrible in the ring. He was okay as El Gigante in WCW but damn. The match also came about when Mr. Hughes, Harvey Whippleman's advisor also stole The Undertaker's urn and put Paul Bearer on the shelf. The Undertaker desperately needed to recapture that urn against Gonzales, now this match was better than WrestleMania 9, but Gonzales was just all over the place again. And everytime Undertaker tried to reclaim the urn. Gonzales would stop him at the pass until Paul Bearer came down the entryway with a wreath and knocked out Harvey Whippleman recapturing the urn giving The Undertaker his power back and thus making a comeback against the 400-pound monster Gonzales to get the victory and thus sending Gonzales out of the WWF for good, but still this is a 2/5. Horrible for Undertaker and Gonzales is all I have to say.\n\nTatanka and The Smoking Gunns/Bigelow and Headshrinkers: The next to last match before the main event and this was a very entertaining six-man tag team match because you had talent like these six superstars. Bigelow & Headshrinkers were the big guys in that match. But somehow Tatanka & The Gunns were able to get an upset over The Headshrinkers & Bigelow, the 6-Man Tag will get a 3/5 because it was entertaining.\n\nLuger/Yokozuna: And possibly the biggest match of the night. Luger and Yokozuna, the question remained could Luger end Yokozuna's short lived reign as the World Wrestling Federation Champion. Yoko had been champ for almost 2 months and Luger wanted to take it from him. This was an okay main event between Luger and Yokozuna, Yokozuna didn't fight bad at all and neither did Luger, both of them did pretty well against one another. Yokozuna of course had the momentum but it would be Luger fighting back by delivering another bodyslam on Yokozuna and knocking him out of the ring with a forearm. Luger would win the match on a countout, but did not win the WWF Championship. But still a joyous victory for the Lex Express. The match will get a 3/5 cause of Luger & Yokozuna having experienced talent with each other even though they were big guys.\n\nSummerslam 1993 was not pretty good in my opinion. I have to name a MVP. And that MVP would be Lex Luger because of the aftermath celebration. The WVP would be Undertaker/Gonzales.\n\nMVP: Lex Luger\n\nWVP: The Undertaker/Giant Gonzales\n\nSUMMERSLAM 1994 - United Center - Chicago, IL - August 29, 1994\n\nupload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fd/SummerSlam_1994.jpg\n\nBefore Summerslam 1994:\n\n1994 rolled around in the World Wrestling Federation, tough times were hard for the WWF now that WCW was starting to get more momentum over the World Wrestling Federation. Hogan and Flair were now the top 2 guys in WCW while Bret Hart was once again the #1 man in the World Wrestling Federation, At the 1993 Survivor Series. Bret and his brother Owen were in a traditional Survivor Series Elimination Match against Shawn Michaels & The Knights. Bret and his family disposed of the Knights very quickly, but after a misstep by Bret and Owen. Shawn would get the only elimination by eliminating Owen that upsetted Owen to the point where he shoved Bret after the match. And many people thought that Owen and Bret would reconcilate by the holidays and the new year of 1994. At the 1994 Royal Rumble, they faced The Quebecers for the WWF Tag Team Championship. Bret injured his ankle in the middle of the match, Bret also refused to tag his partner Owen in, unfortunately Bret and Owen would lose the match to the Quebecers. After the match, Owen kicked Bret in the leg and stated that he was too selfish leaving Bret's status in peril to the 1994 Royal Rumble Match. Bret would eventually make the Rumble Match at #27 and would co-win alongside Lex Luger. At WrestleMania 10, before Bret could face off against Yokozuna for the title. Bret had to wrestle Owen first. Owen would shock Bret by picking up the surprising win in a fantastic match. Bret would return later that night however and still got the last laugh by defeating Yokozuna to win the WWF Championship for the second straight time. After the match, Owen came down and watched Bret celebrate his victory. At the 1994 King of The Ring, Owen would have his moment in the sun when he won the 1994 King of The Ring similar to what his brother did last year and what made matters worse for Bret was that Bret's partner Jim Neidhart was now on Owen's side. Owen and Bret would face off at the biggest party of the summer in a Steel Cage Match at Summerslam, meanwhile In another main event from 1994 at Summerslam. At that year's Royal Rumble the night when Owen turned on Bret. The WWF Championship was also on the line when reigning 568-pound WWF Champion Yokozuna took on The Undertaker in a Casket Match, The Undertaker had the momentum on his side but as he was prepared to shut the casket on Yokozuna. Yokozuna's friends ran down to attack The Undertaker. Undertaker would try to fight back against these 10 men fighting off Diesel, Bam Bam Bigelow, Jeff Jarrett, The Headshrinkers, Crush, Tenryu and Kabuki and Adam Bomb, but all of a sudden. The Undertaker's urn was stolen by Yokozuna and Yokozuna would smack The Undertaker with the urn and Yoko would open it up with green smoke bellowing from the urn. Yokozuna and all of the superstars would take The lifeless body of the Deadman and stuff him inside the casket with Yokozuna winning the match, but as they were set to take the casket backstage as some sort of trophy, the casket filled with Green Smoke coming out of the casket, the lights would then go out with an image of Undertaker inside the casket. The Deadman rose up from inside the casket warning Yokozuna and his henchmen that he would not rest in peace and that he would be reborn again. The Deadman would then disappear by levitating out of the arena, at the end of WrestleMania 10. Everyone around the world stated that they had seen sightings of The Undertaker, even Ted Dibiase claimed that he had found The Undertaker, because after all it was Dibiase that brought The Undertaker to the WWF at the 1990 Survivor Series. Paul Bearer said that Dibiase was a liar and wanted Dibiase to put his money where his mouth was. At the Heartbreak Hotel in June, Ted Dibiase revealed The Undertaker once more, but that was not The Undertaker, that was not the same man who was beaten down by Yokozuna at the 1994 Royal Rumble. Infact it was a fake and even Paul Bearer said that Dibiase's Undertaker was not real. Bearer returned to the cemetery in where he felt The Undertaker was here the strongest. Even Leslie Nielsen was brought in to investigate, weeks would go by with no sign of Paul Bearer's Undertaker, but all of a sudden, weeks before Summerslam at the King's Court as Paul Bearer confronted Ted Dibiase's Undertaker and Dibiase's Undertaker threatened to chokeslam him. The Lights dimmed and The Undertaker's gong was heard with Bearer proclaiming the presence of his Undertaker. And on an edition of the Heartbreak Hotel. Paul Bearer allowed Dibiase and his Undertaker to hear his Undertaker's words. Undertaker for the first time since the 1994 Royal Rumble spoke saying that Dibiase's Undertaker would rest in peace setting up the scene for the main event at Summerslam.\n\nBigelow & IRS/The Headshrinkers: The match was originally scheduled to be for the WWF Tag Team Championship, but on the night before Summerslam, Diesel and Shawn Michaels defeated The Headshrinkers to win the WWF Tag Team Titles, the match did take place as planned, however the titles were not on the line. Bigelow and IRS worked pretty well as a team because they had Ted Dibiase as their manager. Now this was an okay tag team match, But still not 10 or 15 minutes even though the titles were not at stake. Bigelow and IRS got the win by DQ over The Headshrinkers, The Headshrinkers also had Lou Albano in their corner as well. The Tag Match will get a 2/5. If the match was for the Tag Team Titles, it would've been a 3/5.\n\nBlayze/Nakano: The first time that the Women's Championship was defended at a Summerslam. The Women's Title would be deactivated at the end of 1989 when Rockin' Robin left the WWF. The WWF eventually would bring it back in December of 1993 with Alundra Blayze who would best be known as Madusa later on in her wrestling career. Blayze also retained the title at WrestleMania 10 as well against Leilani Kai at Madison Square Garden. But this was an obstacle for her as she took on Bull Nakano, now granted Blayze and Nakano revolutionized the Women's Division together and they had great chemistry and this match was good, not perfect but good. Blayze gets the win and retains the Women's Championship over Nakano. 3/5 for both ladies competing in their first Summerslam as women.\n\nDiesel/Razor: 4 months ago, Diesel captured the Intercontinental Championship over the Bad Guy Razor Ramon who fought in a tremendous ladder match against The Heartbreak Kid at WrestleMania 10. Razor had some good feuds in 1994 with both Michaels and Diesel at the same time. This was second close to Owen and Bret, But still. Razor and Diesel had great chemistry together in the ring, Razor also had Walter Payton at ringside to counter Shawn Michaels. Before their match, Diesel and Shawn did win the Tag Team Titles over the Headshrinkers the night before so that would mean huge advantage and momentum for Diesel. At the end of the match, Diesel set up Razor for a Sweet Chin Music with Shawn getting in the ring as the referee was occupied with Payton. Razor ducked and Shawn would hit the Sweet Chin Music on Diesel allowing Razor to win the title for the second time, good solid match between Razor and Diesel and that deserves a 3/5 as well.\n\nTatanka/Luger: The match came about when everybody claimed and even Tatanka claimed that Lex Luger was going to sell out to the Million Dollar Corporation. Luger had lost all of its momentum after winning the 1994 Royal Rumble and even losing against Yokozuna at WrestleMania 10 for the WWF Championship. Luger was originally supposed to feud with Mr. Perfect, but instead Perfect bowed out due to an injury and that they had to set up this storyline between Luger and Tatanka. This was not a bad match by all means. But in the end, Luger's downward spiral continued when Tatanka got the victory over him. After the match, Luger refused to join Ted Dibiase's corporation and that allowed Tatanka to attack Luger and join the Million Dollar Corporation turning him heel, but hey if I was a booker, I would've reversed the roles with Luger joining the Corporation because to be fair, Luger didn't need the USA Gimmick. He would've been good in the Million Dollar Corporation all the way from late 1994 through the middle part of 1995 until leaving for WCW for good, the match gets a 2/5. It was okay, but the ending changed my rate a little.\n\nJarrett/Mabel: This was probably a snack break match and that's what it was, Country vs Rap. Jarrett represented Country while Mabel represented Rap. Jarrett picks up the win in this one. The match gets a 1/5. Yep, the first 1/5 of Summerslam 1994. Cause like I said it was a Snack Break Match. What do you want me to do?. Give Jarrett and Mabel a bone?.\n\nBret/Owen: This match honestly should have been your main event, but it wasn't. But damn it, Bret and Owen made pretty damn sure that it was even though Undertaker vs Undertaker would be last on the card which was stupid IMO. But these two really told a story similar to their WrestleMania 10 encounter, it was more of a good match between the two. These two had awesome chemistry with one another. Out of all Bret's matches at Summerslam, his matches with Perfect and Bulldog topped them all, but this was another topper for Bret taking on his brother inside the cage. Even you had the Hart Family out there and even Jim Neidhart and British Bulldog out there, the match was 35 minutes long and they could've gone past 40 minutes. But in the end. The Hitman lived to fight another day defeating his brother to retain the WWF Championship. After the match though, Owen and Jim attacked Bret and kept the Hart Family at bay when they tried to get in the cage, eventually the British Bulldog would get in the cage to save Bret helping him against Owen and Jim Neidhart. Bret and Owen's match gets, you guessed it a 5/5. Yep, a 5/5. Bret gets another Summerslam 5 out of 5. These two really told a story out there and what a way to end this rivalry in a Steel Cage Match, but even though the match between Bret and Owen ended. Bret and Owen still continued to rival with one another until they formed an alliance together in 1997 alongside with Neidhart and The British Bulldog.\n\nUndertaker/Underfaker: This match stunk, but before they stunk up the place. Paul Bearer's Undertaker had a tremendous entrance, first you expected Paul Bearer to come out with grim reapers carrying a casket, many assumed even Vince McMahon himself thought that The Undertaker was in that casket, but this was another new casket, not the same casket that The Undertaker used for his match against Yokozuna at the 1994 Royal Rumble, but it was a new casket. Paul Bearer opened up the casket to reveal a much larger size urn as Bearer entered the ring with it, he opened up the urn to reveal a light coming out from the urn signaling the Spirit of The Undertaker. Thunder and Lightning filled the United Center as The Real & True Undertaker made his return decked in all purple gear staring down a mirror size version of himself. The match yes did indeed stink, because both Undertakers threw punches at one another, there was not hardly any wrestling moves. Undertaker yes did the ropewalk and Underfaker used a chokeslam, but as Dibiase's Underfaker tried to put Undertaker away. The Phenom used not one, not two but three tombstone piledrivers to put away this Imposter once and for all and stuff him inside the casket never to be seen again. The Main Event gets a 2/5, but as for Undertaker's entrance. I will give it a 4/5 because it was so iconic. And possibly one of the greatest iconic entrances of all time by The Undertaker.\n\nSummerslam 1994 was a little better, Bret & Owen & Undertaker's entrance definitely has to be the MVP of the night, but WVP again goes to The Undertaker vs The Undertaker.\n\nMVP: Bret/Owen & Undertaker's entrance\n\nWVP: Undertaker vs Underfaker\n\nSUMMERSLAM 1995 - MELLON ARENA - PITTSBURGH, PA - August 27. 1995\n\nBefore Summerslam 1995:\n\nLet's just say this PPV was a train wreck waiting to happen, the WWF in 1995 was not doing so hot at all. Their worseness increased with Mabel winning the 1995 King of The Ring and Diesel as their top guy, now to be honest I don't have a problem with Diesel as WWF Champion. But I feel like he should've been Champion up until WrestleMania 11. Diesel should've lost the belt to someone talented like Razor Ramon or Shawn Michaels. But there was some people who should've deserved the King of The Ring and i'll start out with a list of them real quick. British Bulldog. Lex Luger. Bam Bam Bigelow. The Undertaker. Shawn Michaels. Razor Ramon, any of those guys could've been the King, but King Mabel. SMH!. Also in addition to the disastrous main event, Shawn and Razor would rekindle their WrestleMania 10 rematch in a Ladder Match for the Intercontinental Championship.\n\nHakushi/Kid: Now this was a good way to kick off Summerslam, no doubt. This was a prelude to what we'd see before the Light Heavyweight Championship would come along. Hakushi and Kid put on one heck of a good match with one another, and it showed with Hakushi scoring the upset over The Kid, the match to me gets a 4/5. Very solid start between Hakushi and The 123 Kid.\n\nHelmsley/Holly: Before he was Triple H, He would be known as the Blueblood, This was a hard hitting match between two of the soon to be Attitude Era stars. This was also The Game's first PPV Match so you knew he had to go over in this match. These two had some good chemistry, the least they could've given the two 10 or 15 minutes. But didn't happen that way, but still Helmsley got the win, the match gets a 3/5 because of Holly and Helmsley's chemistry.\n\nGunns/Blu Brothers: As you know there were some weird talent by 1995 in the WWF and the Blu Brothers were also one of them before Don and Ron Harris became the D.O.A. by 1997. The Gunns were still pretty much a talented tag team and it showed in this match. The tag match itself wasn't bad, but it was The Gunns that picked up the win, so here's a 2/5. The match was not all that bad, but still they could've done better.\n\nHorowitz/Skip: This match came about when Horowitz finally broke his jobber streak when he defeated Skip because Skip was being too cocky as usual. Skip wanted to prove that Horowitz's victory was a fluke. Horowitz and Skip once again put on a decent showing. Horowitz and Skip lasted 11 minutes with each other and that was good, but thanks with help from Hakushi of all people. Horowitz picked up the win once again embarassing Skip, so here's another 3/5, the match really wasn't all that bad and Horowitz's first PPV Win as well that's why I gave it a 3/5.\n\nBlayze/Faye: Moving on now, Alundra Blayze won the Women's Title the night after WrestleMania 11 over Bull Nakano after Bull beat her in November of 1994 to capture the Women's Championship. Alundra's match with Faye was not as good as Nakano. But this would be the last time the Women's Title would be defended at Summerslam until 1999 again. Faye would regain the Women's Championship over Blayze, the women unfortunately get a 2/5.\n\nUndertaker/Kama: Two super heavyweights and two fighters. Undertaker and Kama, the match came about when Dibiase had Kama take The Undertaker's urn against King Kong Bundy at WrestleMania 11 while The Undertaker recaptured it for a split second cause it was stolen at the 1995 Royal Rumble when Undertaker battled I.R.S. Taker without the help of the urn got support from his creatures of the night as they alongside The Undertaker were calling for Kama's death sentence. At the 1995 King of The Ring, Kama once again denied Undertaker victory when Undertaker took on King Mabel in the Quarterfinals with Kama interefering after Undertaker was close on putting Mabel away. Kama came in to kick The Undertaker in the face allowing Mabel to get the victory. Kama pushed the envelope much further when he attacked one of The Undertaker's creatures of the night and thus destroying his wreath. Kama would have to pay the price with Undertaker facing him in a Casket Match. Now this was a good match, not a bad match between these two. At one point in the match, the casket was destroyed. But the two still fought on with Undertaker winning this hard fought victory over Kama. The match gets another 3/5. Damn, even though this PPV Sucked. Every match is getting a 3/5 by me believe it or not.\n\nBret/Yankem: Before Glen Jacobs was known as Kane, he would be known as Isaac Yankem DDS as he would be the dentist for Jerry Lawler. Lawler was going to get redemption on the Hitman because of what Bret did at the 1995 King of The Ring when he shoved his foot in Lawler's mouth and also shoved Lawler's own foot in his mouth as well. Yankem and Bret put on an okay match, although the match was 16 minutes. Both of them were all over the place, Bret won the match by DQ thanks to intereference from Lawler. The match unfortunately gets a 2/5. Glen Jacobs returned to Summerslam again 3 years later but this time as Kane.\n\nShawn/Razor: If WrestleMania 10 was any indicator that Shawn and Razor would compete once again in a Ladder Match for the same title that tore the house down at Madison Square Garden at the tenth WrestleMania. This did not disappoint, there were highs in that match and pretty much a good one, Summerslam had it's shares of Intercontinental Championship Matches, but this one was not a disappointment. Shawn made sure that history wouldn't repeat itself as the Heartbreak Kid walked in at Summerslam 1995 with the Intercontinental Championship and walked out of Summerslam still as the Intercontinental Champion. This match was way similar to WrestleMania 10, and so this match gets a big 5/5. That was the only good match of the show next to Hakushi and The 123 Kid.\n\nDiesel/Mabel: I feel like this match should've been the next to last and Shawn vs Razor would've been the main event. That would've left Pittsburgh fans on a happier note. But they dragged this main event, a main event that honestly should've never existed. And it also saw the last appearance of Lex Luger in the WWF. Diesel was able to retain the WWF Title in this match, the main event believe it or not gets a 1/5.\n\nSummerslam 1995 was not good at all, but only the good matches I liked the most was Hakushi and The Kid, Undertaker and Kama and Michaels and Razor, WVP had to be Diesel vs Mabel. While the MVP was drumroll please? ?. (drumroll sound). Michaels and Razor\n\nMVP: Shawn Michaels and Razor Ramon\n\nWVP: Diesel and Mabel.\n\nSUMMERSLAM 1996 - Gund Arena - Cleveland, OH - August 18, 1996\n\nBefore Summerslam 1996:\n\nThe WWF was now deeply in trouble, Diesel and Razor Ramon known as Kevin Nash and Scott Hall would both leave the WWF to go to WCW and they would also have Hulk Hogan with them with the 3 former WWF guys forming the New World Order. Also, Lex Luger, Randy Savage and more others from the 80s era would also come to WCW as well. The WWF was starting to get a little more edgier and have more edgier rivalries in their favor with Shawn vs Vader and Undertaker vs Mankind, at WrestleMania 12, Shawn Michaels's boyhood dream came true when he defeated Bret Hart in a 60-Minute Ironman Match to win the WWF Championship. Michaels had defeated all challengers that came before him in Diesel and The British Bulldog and others, but Vader was the next guy on his list. Vader defeated Shawn at International Incident in a six-man tag team match. Also another feud that was way hardcore was The Undertaker and Mankind. On April 1, 1996. The Night after WrestleMania 12. Mankind made his debut to attack The Undertaker that led to a match between the two at the 1996 King of The Ring with Mankind winning the match after an accidental hit with Paul Bearer's urn. The two would end their feud in a Boiler Room Brawl Match.\n\nAustin/Yokozuna: Yes, I know this wasn't on the actual show, it was on the free for all. And Yokozuna's time in the ring had wound down as well and it pretty much showed when he took on the 1996 King of The Ring winner. Stone Cold Steve Austin. Austin was on the rise to begin his Austin 3:16 era after proclaiming it at the 1996 King of The Ring. And what better way for Austin to continue his Austin 3:16 rise was to defeat a much larger opponent in a former WWF Champion as Yokozuna. This match was not good by all means, the ending of the match showed why. Yokozuna went to do a banzai. But Austin rolled out of the way and one of the ring ropes collapsed as well cause of Yokozuna's weight giving Austin the victory. So a 1/5 for this.\n\nOwen/Savio: A great match that kicked off Summerslam between Owen and Savio. Owen of course wanted to steal another Summerslam Match against Savio, the match wasn't as bad as what it was. Owen gets the win by using his cast over Savio. The match gets a 3/5, not a bad start between these two as they really did good with one another, after the match. Bradshaw came down to attack Savio starting a rivalry between the two.\n\nThe Smoking Gunns/The Rockers/The Godwinns/The Bodydonnas: No, Marty and Shawn didn't reunite on this night instead it was Marty Jannetty and Leif Cassidy who would be known as Al Snow teaming up with one another. Although it was an elimination match, this was a solid fatal-four way tag team match. The Tag Teams were produced very well in 1996 perfectly. The Gunns retained the titles, and this Tag Title Match gets a 3/5 as well.\n\nSid/Bulldog: Two big men wrestling at a big event such as Summerslam, both men had not wrestled at a Summerslam. The Bulldog hadn't wrestled at a Summerslam since 1992, and Sid had not wrestled a Summerslam either, his only appearance was in 1991 though at Summerslam. So this was Sid's first match at Summerslam. The match was okay for what it was, But this was a good victory for Sid. Sid needed this win to knock off the former Intercontinental Champion, but the match unfortunately gets a 2/5.\n\nGoldust/Mero: Both Goldust and Mero had made their debuts in the WWF and they also had two beautiful hellcats with them. Goldust of course had Marlena as the two were married in real life and Marc Mero was with Sable as the two were also married in real life as well. This was a skilled entertaining match between these two gentlemen, Goldust needed some redemption after losing the Intercontinental Title over Ahmed Johnson at the 1996 King of The Ring. Goldust got the victory here although Mero was still stuck in midcard status, but Mero would get his victory back at Buried Alive when he successfully defended the Intercontinental Title against Goldust, another 3/5 between Goldust and Mero.\n\nLawler/Roberts: Now this match was the stinker, because of Lawler making fun of Roberts's drinking habits back in the day as Roberts returned to the WWF in 1996. Roberts and Lawler were both peaking at their ages as well. Lawler was in his late 40s while Roberts was in his early 40s. So this match wasn't good at all. Lawler gets the win by hitting Roberts with some sort of bottle getting the win, after the match as Lawler attempted to pour liquor on Roberts's throat. Mark Henry made the save to attack Lawler, the match will get a second 2/5.\n\nUndertaker/Mankind: This is probably one of the best matches to ever exist, one of the greatest Hardcore Matches to ever happen in WWF History cause we all know Mick Foley was the king of Hardcore before coming to the WWF. He had come to ECW and New Japan wrestling in Hardcore Matches, and look up his match in August of 1995 against Terry Funk as well. These two put on a solid boiler room brawl encounter, trashcans, ladders, 2x4s. Everything they did with one another including the kitchen sink. The match would have to end with Undertaker or Mankind retrieving possession of the urn. After Taker beatdown Mankind on the outside of the ring. He returned to the ring and told Paul Bearer to give him the urn. But Bearer straight out refused and thus that allowed Mankind to take advantage of it and attack The Undertaker, but all of a sudden. Paul Bearer joined up with Mankind attacking The Undertaker ending a 5-year relationship between the two. Bearer after that struck Taker with the urn knocking Undertaker out for good giving Mankind the win. After Mankind & Bearer left backstage to celebrate with their new alliance. The lights went out as The Undertaker's druids came down to carry a unconscious Undertaker out of the arena. This match in all seriousness will receive a 4/5. Cause of the effort the two put on. A really good storytelling match, the betrayal also worked as well too, the aftermath of Undertaker being carried out was good as well.\n\nVader/Shawn: Now to top out that epic next to last main event was the main event itself. Vader had now become the top bad guy of the World Wrestling Federation and what better way to prove it was to defeat Shawn Michaels and capture the WWF Championship. Vader was determined to end the boyhood dream. Michaels would try to take Vader down if it meant keeping the WWF Championship. Vader won the match, not once but twice. But Cornette demanded a restart. However Vader didn't win a third time as Michaels retained the WWF Title over the Mastadon, this match gets a 3/5. Although it would've worked to see a title change to see Vader becoming a dominant monster heel champion. Shawn had to keep his ego and his creative control.\n\nSummerslam 1996 was a better improvement than the Summerslam 1995 one, the MVP was Mankind vs Undertaker, but the worst would have to be Yokozuna cause of Yokozuna breaking the ropes.\n\nMVP: Mankind vs Undertaker\n\nWVP: Yokozuna\n\nSUMMERSLAM 1997 - August 3, 1997 - Continental Airlines Arena - East Rutherford, NJ\n\nBefore Summerslam 1997:\n\nAt the beginning and Middle of 1997, the Monday Night Wars were starting to get red hot. WWF was finally starting to make progress even though WCW Nitro was dominating WWF RAW at every turn in the ratings. But the WWF was starting to have some attitude by having Shawn Michaels, Bret Hart, The Undertaker and Stone Cold Steve Austin all of his #1 top guys. At the 1996 Survivor Series, Bret Hart returned to defeat Stone Cold Steve Austin, but by 1997 after Bret was not winning the Royal Rumble nor capturing the WWF Championship, he denounced United States and turned his back on the US Fans and thus forming a Stable with his brother Owen, his brother-in-law Davey Boy, and Jim Neidhart and Brian Pillman as well. Bret wanted to do whatever it takes to win back his fifth WWF Championship over The Undertaker that so and so he would leave the United States if he lost. Plus, however. Stone Cold Steve Austin was also on the hunt for Bret's brother Owen for the Intercontinental Championship as well.\n\nMankind/Helmsley: Helmsley got off to a bad 1996 with him having trouble in the WWF Department after the KLIQ Incident on May 19, 1996. Helmsley would regain the Intercontinental Title later that year, but he would win the 1997 King of The Ring the next year and this was a good match between Helmsley and Mankind, a prelude for what would come in their Hardcore Matches in 1997 and 2000. But this was one was much brutal in the cage between these two men. Mankind challened his inner Jimmy Snuka by dropping the elbow off the cage and thus somehow getting the victory. In the first match of Summerslam, the match gets a 4/5. Because Mankind and Helmsley pulled off a solid match with each other.\n\nGoldust/Pillman: You could tell Pillman's days were winding down, As sadly this would be his next to last PPV match but Pillman was determined and still a little edgier, the stipulation stated that if Pillman lost the match, Pillman would be forced to wear a dress. And Goldust would see to it that it did as he defeated Pillman to get the win, the match will get a 2/5 because it didn't really click between these two. Pillman unfortunately would never see another Summerslam as he passed away on October 5, 1997.\n\nThe LOD/The Godwinns: This was an okay and allright tag team match. The Legion of Doom's first Summerslam Match was in 1992 with a victory and they returned at Summerslam to get another victory over The Godwinns, and it was guaranteed, but the tag match will also get a 3/5 because they had great Tag Teams in 1997 as well. Not a bad tag team match between these two teams.\n\nBulldog/Shamrock: This was a hard hitting powerful match in where the stipulation stated that if Bulldog lost, he would have to eat a can of dog food. The two didn't click very well although it was very powerful between the two. The European Championship was defended also for the first time at Summerslam cause of Bulldog capturing the European Title last March. Bulldog won the match by a DQ, Shamrock snapped and would attack Bulldog after the match, but the match will have a 2/5.\n\nLos Boricuas/DOA: This match was billed as a war of attraction between The Los Boricuas and DOA. As Crush and Savio Vega were both kicked out of the Nation of Domination. In 1997, the WWF began to attract more stables in their industry with The Hart Foundation, the Nation of Domination and the Los Boricuas and The DOA. The match was okay for what it was, but it wasn't all that perfect as the Boricuas picked up the victory, the match gets a 3/5.\n\nAustin/Owen: We go into the meat of the Double Main Event, first the Intercontinental Championship between Stone Cold Steve Austin and Owen Hart. The Intercontinental Title at Summerslam has provided greatest moments but on this night it proved to be true. Austin and Owen put on one heck of a great match, but in the closing moments of the match. Owen reversed a move by Austin with Owen reversing the move and using the Tombstone Piledriver a version The Undertaker would use, but Owen's tombstone would legimitately temporarily paralyze Austin for a few seconds. The WWF was gaining ground and it would be a huge blow not to have Austin in there if he was paralyzed for good. But Austin was somehow able to use the strength and the stipulations also stated that if Austin did lose, Austin would have to kiss Owen's ass. Austin somehow used the strength but performed the worst roll up ever over Owen Hart winning the Intercontinental Title. Austin and Owen wouldn't see eye to eye although they wrestled in matches together, they never discussed the Tombstone Incident, Sadly. They would not be able to talk about it with Owen passing away due to a freak accident in Kansas City on May 23, 1999. The incident would make Austin stronger as he would get back on his feet and win many WWF Championships and plus 3 Royal Rumble wins. The match gets a 4/5. I would've given it a 3/5. But the 4/5 is the resilency for Austin fighting through the pain.\n\nUndertaker/Hart: These two have had great rivalries, their first PPV Match was at the 1990 Survivor Series when The Undertaker debuted in the traditional Survivor Series Elimination Match, and at the 1996 Royal Rumble for the WWF Championship in which it was a great match. Undertaker and Hart both had so much riding in this match, even guest referee Shawn Michaels. Bret would leave the WWF if he had lost, and Undertaker was dealing with the shock of his brother Kane being alive, the brother who he thought perished in a fire with his mother and father at the same time. This match was one hell of a great match between Undertaker and Bret Hart, although there was intereference from Paul Bearer, Owen Hart, British Bulldog and Brian Pillman. But Taker and Hart were able to keep the pace of the momentum going. But towards the end of the match. Hart hit Undertaker with a chair and Michaels noticed it threatening to disqualify Hart as Michaels and Hart had words. Michaels attempted to strike Hart with a chair shot but Hart ducked it and Michaels accidentally hit The Undertaker giving Hart his fifth WWF Championship win with Michaels being forced to count, this was one of Hart's best matches in his last Summerslam Match and even in The Undertaker's best Summerslam Match as well like last year against Mankind. Bret would not wrestle at a Summerslam again cause of the Montreal Incident 3 months ago on November 9, 1997 at Survivor Series against Michaels. Bret wrestled again at Summerslam in 2010. But this signaled the start of the Attitude Era with Michaels turning heel, the match will get a 5/5 cause of the two working pretty well together, the ending with the HBK Heel Turn was also great. But Bret and Undertaker told a story in that match.\n\nSummerslam 1997 was a big improvement like last year, they had some pretty good matches, the MVPs had to be Austin and Owen, Undertaker and Bret and Mankind for jumping off the cage. The WVPs would have to be Bulldog vs Shamrock.\n\nMVPs: Stone Cold Steve Austin, Owen Hart, The Undertaker, Bret Hart and Mankind\n\nWVPs: British Bulldog and Ken Shamrock"
