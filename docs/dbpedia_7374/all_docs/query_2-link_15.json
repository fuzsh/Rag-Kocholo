        "text": "30 years ago Lex Luger SAVED AMERICA.\n\n8/30/93\n\nAuburn Hills, Michigan\n\nCommentary: Vince McMahon and The Brain\n\nI miss the old SummerSlam theme.\n\nRazor Ramon v Ted Dibiase\n\nYou hate to see the nWo fighting one another but White tux Dibiase fucks. I wish he would have went white gear as well. Razor did his part by predicting the success of the Barbie movie 30 years in advance and wore the pink gear. Genius level thinking. The match was okish. Dibiase was definitely hurting here but held it together well enough. 1-1\n\nWinner: Razor following the Razors Edge and some exposed turnbuckle shenanigans.\n\nTodd interviews the Steiner family. They call Rick by his real name but on a positive note don’t insult anyone else’s life choices so I’d say it’s 50/50.\n\nTag Team Championship: (C)The Steiner Brothers v The Heavenly Bodies (w/Jim Cornette)\n\nThis was an old school ass southern BANGER. Of course I loved it. Scott was a freak. Dynamite stuff. 2-2\n\nWinner: The champs retain via Frankensteiner.\n\nSo. I missed old boy’s name but let’s call him Uncle Joey from Full House is handling backstage interviews. HBK and Diesel discuss the upcoming match with Mr. Perfect. Nash still has a little Vinnie Vegas in his voice.\n\nIntercontinental Championship: Shawn Michaels (w/Diesel )v Mr. Perfect\n\nThis one gets a bad rap from a lot of people because the Fed essentially advertised this as the best match ever. It wasn’t. Was it bad? Also no. It was perfectly fine, if a little slow, before the garbage ass ending. Still good enough. 3-3\n\nWinner: Shawn retained via countout after some Diesel chicanery.\n\nPerfect tried to get revenge afterwards but Diesel fucked him UP.\n\nTodd stops the winner on the way out because he sucks.\n\nUncle Joey is with The Kid. This promo was not what I would call good. Kid was TINY in 93 and he’s still bigger than 85% of indie wrestlers today.\n\nIRS calls Detroit “Tax Cheat City”. Man. What a dynamic promo.\n\n1-2-3 Kid v. IRS\n\nKid was working his ASS off. Old Mike did the usual. It ended up being perfectly entertaining but nothing memorable. Still though. Not terrible. 4-4\n\nWinner: IRS via flying clothesline.\n\nTodd is with Bruce and Owen Hart. They are mad at Lawler. Bruce still sucks.\n\nUnfortunately and tragically Jerry Lawler is damn near crippled and will not be able to compete in the scheduled contest. Sadly even though he has his knee wrapped and he’s on crutches that jerk Todd doesn’t believe he is injured. I can’t believe he called himself a journalist. So a replacement has to be named.\n\nBret Hart v Doink the Clown\n\nY’all should know me well enough to know that Matt Bourne vs Bret is totally some shit I would love. And I did. So good. 5-5\n\nWinner: Bret won by DQ after Lawler made a MIRACULOUS recovery and tried to help his friend Doink out.\n\nLawler whoops that ass with a crutch but is stopped by that crook Jack Tunney and is forced to wrestle. Ridiculous.\n\nKing of the Ring match: Bret Hart v Jerry Lawler\n\nOF COURSE I loved this. Memphis as hell type brawl. Bret and Lawler both killed this shit. I am DIGGING this show. 6-6\n\nWinner: Jerry won via reverse decision.\n\nLawler holding up his arm in victory from the stretcher never fails to crack me up.\n\nLudvig hates America. Also Lex Luger sucks or something.\n\nMarty Jannetty v. Ludvig Börga\n\nPunch. Pose. Repeat. Poor Marty. 6-7\n\nWinner: Ludvig won with the WORST Torture Rack EVER.\n\nSurvivor Series is coming up apparently.\n\nRIP match: Undertaker (w/Paul Bearer) v Giant Gonzalez (w/Harvey Whippleman)\n\nWhat a piece of shit. It got a little better when Paul finally showed up but wow. 6-8\n\nWinner: The Undertaker after a top rope clothesline.\n\nGonzalez murdered Harvey after the match with maybe the worst chokeslam ever.\n\nUncle Joey is with the Yokozuna posse. Cornette talks his ASS off. I wonder if this makes Jim retroactively a member of the Bloodline?\n\nThe Smoking Gunns /Tatanka v Bam Bam Bigelow/The Headshrinkers (w/Afa and Luna)\n\nAnything is better than that last piece of crap. This is one of those big men slapping meat deals and worked as a great pallette cleanser for the last couple of turds. All hail the Bloodline. 7-9\n\nWinner: The Babyfaces survive after a roll-up from Tatanka.\n\nUncle Joey interviews Lex’s bus driver. What riveting television. You can’t say they didn’t try to make Lex the guy.\n\nTodd is with some drunk dude in the crowd. Even more riveting.\n\nThe Japanese national anthem is performed and these bitch made Michigan fans booed it. Show some class.\n\nThe Master of Ceremonies for the main event is the Macho Man. He is joined by Aaron Neville. Aaron sings the Anthem as we try to fill PPV time.\n\nWWE Championship: (C) Yokozuna (w/Fuji and Cornette) v Lex Luger\n\nSo listen. This was better than I remember or had any right to be. Lex busted his ASS in there and Yoko wasn’t too far behind. Good main event. 8-10\n\nWinner: Lex won via countout but not the title.\n\nSee? Not striking while the iron is hot and failing to finish the story ain’t new.\n\nOverall: 8-10 This show was a very pleasant surprise. Other than a couple of stinkers I didn’t hate it at all. Let’s see how jumping forward a decade goes now.\n\nAll Images Available at WWE.com"
