Duggan is distracted by Fuji in the corner and is splashed from behind. Yokozuna drops Duggan in the corner and hits the Bonsai Drop for the win. (*1/2. Not too bad of a match as they did the formula match rather well here. Duggan got the crowd behind him pretty well, but Yokozuna getting the win is obviously the right call to add momentum heading into SummerSlam.) After the match, Yokozuna decides to go for another Bonsai Drop, but all the referees come down and roll Duggan out of the ring to save him from further injury.\n\nBackstage, Vince McMahon interviews WWF World Champion Yokozuna and Jim Cornette. This is timed poorly since Yoko was clearly still in the ring. Cornette says that Yokozuna has been woken up and his man is ready to destroy Lex Luger at SummerSlam. Cornette reminds Luger that he asked for this match. He says that Yoko doesn’t have any compassion. Cornette promises that Yoko will deliver several Bonsai Drops and Luger will beg for no more, but they will not let up.

Blake rams Ramon face first into the corner and slaps him a few times. Ramon sends Blake into the exposed turnbuckle and signals for the Razors Edge, which he hits. (*1/4. Nothing all that memorable here, but I do wonder why they didn’t use Blake in a signals role at some point.)\n\nJerry Lawler is in a car with a fake Elvis and he insults Bret Hart and his family during the segment. Lawler says that Bret is impersonating being the king of wrestling. Lawler says it makes his blood boil to see Bret try to take the shortcut to success by copying him. Lawler says he’s the only king in the WWF.\n\nBret Hart shares some thoughts on Jerry Lawler saying he has crossed the line that nobody has crossed before. He doesn’t mind fighting his own battles but does mind when they bring his family into it. Bret promises that his match at SummerSlam isn’t going to be pretty and warned his family to not come and see what he’ll do. However, they want to be there and witness what Hart does to Jerry Lawler. Hart is going to pay big time for getting his family involved in this.\n\nThird Contest: Tatanka & Smoking Gunns vs. Barry Horowitz, Reno Riggins & Brooklyn Brawler: As you might expect, it’s just an extended showcase for Tatanka and the Gunns before their six man tag match at SummerSlam. Tatanka got the win for his team following a top rope cross body on Riggins.\n\nThe Undertaker makes his way down tot he ring to be interviewed by Mean Gene. He’ll be fighting the Giant Gonzalez at SummerSlam. Gene wants to know what the rules for the Rest In Peace match exactly are. Taker says that everyone has a day where they must be held accountable for this actions. That day for Gonzalez comes at SummerSlam. He may not have Paul Bearer and doesn’t have the urn. He does have the power from the creatures of the night. Taker says that the match is just a match where he will take his flesh and extracts all of his organs. Taker will possess the soul of Giant Gonzalez. So, he doesn’t explain anything. Gonzalez and Harvey Whippleman come out to confront Taker. Gonzalez says that Taker will not get up this time and that it is time for Taker to RIP. Taker takes off his jacket and Gonzalez backs off.

Diesel gets on the apron and distracts the referee. Michaels has a handful of tights and takes Backlund down to earn the cheap victory. (*1/2. It’s a styles clash for sure, but Michaels did a good enough job to carry Backlund to match that wasn’t a complete waste of time. The finish wasn’t very good, though.)\n\nBackstage, Vince McMahon interviews Ludvig Borga who is undefeated. Borga puts down Americans for speaking only English. He says that this SummerSlam will be the last one for Marty Jannetty. He’s going to give Jannetty pain that he’s never had before. He’s not here for any titles but rather here to give them all pain.\n\nFifth Contest: Marty Jannetty vs. Duane Gill: Jannetty won the match following a top rope Rocker Dropper.\n\nMain Event: WWF Tag Team Champions Steiner Brothers vs. Money Inc. in a steel cage match: DiBiase slaps Scott Steiner and is worked over by the champions.

That was a great TV cage match and is probably a match that should have been on the pay per view since they had a long running issue. That finish was nicely done and I don’t recall anyone using it since this time. A really fun cage match that I don’t think gets enough credit.)\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nThe cage match finished of the show, which wasn’t all that interesting beforehand. Yoko/Duggan is a strong match on paper, but it didn’t do much for me here. Of course they promoted the major feuds rather well. I’d check out the cage match and just skip the rest, really.\n\nThanks for reading."
