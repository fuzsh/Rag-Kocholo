        "text": "For my wrestling memories article this month I am writing about SummerSlam 1993, but before that. What if on that fateful PPV, Lex Luger hit Yokozune with the forearm, but instead of rolling out of the ring, he lands flat on his back, 123 and we have a new WWF Champion!\n\nI for one think this would have been great and made the whole Lex Express and summer of Lex actually make sense. I still feel that Lex and Yokozuna would have had their feud for the rest of 1993, but what would have happened as we rolled into 1994 is the big question. Would Bret Hart have won the Royal Rumble outright and got the chance to face Luger at WrestleMania X?\n\nOne fun way I could see this still happening was for Owen to be in the Rumble and for the same end to happen, but with Bret and Owen doing the spot instead of Bret and Lex. This way the two can still have their epic match at Mania, but this time instead of just being for bragging rights it is for the title shot later in the evening.\n\nThe more I think about it the more I still feel that it made sense for Luger to win the title at SummerSlam. However, after this I have no clue how Vince and the WWF would have booked his run with the title to the following years Mania. The real wildcard here is Bret Hart and what would have happened to him. Going even further than this, had Vince gave Luger the title here, would he still have jumped ship in 1995? Luger winning the title at SummerSlam 1993 would have radically changed things going forward for a number of wrestlers. I feel that Bret Hart, Owen Hart, Undertaker and Yokozuna would have all been somehow affected by him winning the title.\n\nI would love to read you guys theories about how you feel things would have turned out had Luger won the title at SummerSlam 1993.\n\nPost by hbkbigdaddycool on\n\nI just recently watch this SummerSlam as it was playing on the Network last week when I was bedridden with a back injury. When Lex won by count out, the only ones really celebrating hard were Vince on the microphone, Randy Savage, Steiners, Tatanka and Lex Luger. The fans were kind of like, \"meh\" to Lex winning.\n\nNow a few things to consider....\n\nDid Vince have Lex win by count out because he wasn't sure if the fans would have went nuts for Lex winning the WWF Title that night??\n\nDid Vince see the 'meh' reaction Lex got with the count out win so he chose not to put the WWF Title on Lex ever??\n\nDid the fans give that 'meh' reaction because Lex didn't win the WWF Title that night??\n\nLooking back at it, I can see that it was wise that Lex didn't win the WWF Title. When you compare Bret Hart's win at Wrestlemania X, when the fans legit were jumping and screaming with joy that Bret won the belt, it makes you really think that Vince went with the right choice as Bret Hart as the champion that time and not Lex.\n\nLex and the whole USA, love American, beat the evil foreign wrestler would have worked perfect in the 80s if there was no Hulk Hogan. But in 1993, even me at the age of 12 years old was tired of that kind of stuff. I wanted Bret Hart to be the man. And a few months later, I got my wish.\n\nPost by underjohngrohs on\n\nI'm sorry but Luger and Borga could not have main evented WrestleMania X bottom line plain and simple, I agree though but here's my different take on The Luger Situation in 1993-1995.\n\nSummerslam' 93: Luger wins the WWF Championship over Yokozuna for the first time.\n\nFall 1993: Luger has a couple of title matches and teams up with The Undertaker, Steiner Brothers and Randy Savage to take on the team of Crush, The Quebecers, Ludvig Borga and Yokozuna with Borga pinning Luger, Yokozuna eliminates Undertaker in that match, but Luger will eliminate Yokozuna after a distraction by The Undertaker.\n\n1994 Royal Rumble: Crush becomes the #1 Contender and loses the match to Luger, Yoko will still kill off The Undertaker in a Casket Match, the \"Spirit of The Undertaker\" is still used. Taker takes time off until Summerslam. Borga wins the Royal Rumble as the #14 entrant by last eliminating Randy Savage.\n\nWrestleMania X: Luger and Borga do not main event, Owen and Bret keep as the first match, but Razor and Shawn, that is the main event for the Intercontinental Championship in a Ladder Match and it steals the show. Luger retains against Borga, Yokozuna defeats Earthquake and the rematch is set for the 1994 King of The Ring between Luger and Yokozuna.\n\n1994 King of The Ring: Luger retains the title against Yokozuna in a Steel Cage Match and feuds with Owen Hart for the title who just won King of The Ring.\n\n1994 Summerslam: Owen defeats Luger to capture the WWF Championship and Luger uses his rematch clause in October but fails to win the title back.\n\n1994 Survivor Series: Luger then turns heel and eventually joins the Million Dollar Corporation, Owen will drop the title to Bret Hart, Undertaker and Yokozuna's feud continues but don't do the casket rematch just yet. Taker will captain a team against Yokozuna's team. Undertaker will dominate Yokozuna's team in a complete shutout, this will end with Yokozuna being counted out.\n\n1995 Royal Rumble: Yokozuna gets his third WWF Championship back by defeating Bret Hart and Luger will defeat Razor Ramon to capture the WWF Intercontinental Championship for the first time thanks to cheating by the Million Dollar Corporation, The Undertaker wins the Royal Rumble for the first time for redemption at #2 by last eliminating the #1 entrant Shawn Michaels.\n\nWrestleMania 11: Yokozuna and The Undertaker compete for the WWF Title in the Casket Rematch, Roddy Piper is the special guest enforcer for this match and assures that there'd be no outside intereference and there is, Yokozuna is laid to rest and The Undertaker becomes the WWF Champion for the first time since 1991, and wins the title for a second time. Taker will drop the title at Summerslam 1995 to Diesel. Luger will retain the title against Razor Ramon that night in a rematch.\n\nSummerslam 1995: Luger feuds with Shawn Michaels for the Intercontinental Title, their feud begins at the King of The Ring with Michaels eliminating Luger from the semi-finals, but Luger gets back at Michaels by losing the finals to Michaels's friend Diesel. Michaels wins the Intercontinental Title at the First In Your House against Luger, Luger declares that if he loses to Michaels again, he would leave the WWF and he does. Michaels beats Luger for the title and Luger is out of the WWF to head to WCW.\n\nPost by MKSavage on\n\nI just recently watch this SummerSlam as it was playing on the Network last week when I was bedridden with a back injury.

But in 1993, even me at the age of 12 years old was tired of that kind of stuff. I wanted Bret Hart to be the man. And a few months later, I got my wish.\n\nI believe Prichard said on his podcast that Lex was supposed to win the title at Summer Slam but at the last second Vince changed his mind, saying it would be better for Luger to win it at WM. From what I understand is that Lex was going to win the belt at WM10 from Yoko but during the time between SS93 and WM10 it appeared that Bret was the more popular guy so it went back to him. I wouldn't be surprised if that was why they both won the 1994 Rumble, I wonder if the WWF wanted to see who the fans would cheer for more to see who should win the belt at WM10. I also remember Bret winning the fan vote as the most popular wrestler in the WWF for 1993, I believe he won that in early 1994 - I remember it being in one of the WWF magazine editions before WM10. Anyway, after WM10, they really should have turned Luger back heel as his total package/narcissist gimmick, that way he could feud with Bret over the title - maybe even win it from him. What they could have done was make him lose to Yoko at WM10, then have him throw a fit because he just can't win the big one, have him take it out on Mr. Perfect (who was still a face at the time), then build him up as a heel between WM10 and SS94, eventually joining Ted DiBiase and the Million $ Corporation. Maybe have his friend Tatanka try to \"turn\" him back babyface which leads to a match at SSL94, however, Lex turns on his friend and joins the corporation. Then after SS94, instead of Bret feuding with Bob Backlund, have Bret feud with Lex, let Lex win the belt at Survivor Series 94 with the idea of Bret coming back at the Rumble to win it and face Lex at WM11 for the belt. If they (WWF/Vince) was really hard up on Diesel, then have Diesel win the 95 Rumble - dominating it like he did the 94 Rumble - then beat Lex for the belt at WM11. For the 1995 Rumble, Bret could face Lex Luger in a rematch for the belt with Lex retaining it.\n\nPost by hbkbigdaddycool on\n\nIf we are going to do fantasy booking, I would have done it like this.\n\nLex wins via count out at SummerSlam. But he's frustrated in himself. He knows he can pin the WWF Champion.\n\nSurvivor Series, Lex, Taker and Steiners vs. Yokozuna, Borga and Quebecers still happens. But Lex pins the WWF Champion to win the match.\n\nLex now knows he can beat Yokozuna.\n\nRumble time. Lex still has to earn that WWF Title shot because he didn't win the belt at SummerSlam. It comes down to Bret and Lex as the final two. Owen runs in to try and stop Bret from winning, and Bret turns his attention to Owen and throws Owen out of the ring. Lex then comes up and throws Bret out, winning the Royal Rumble that year. Bret looks up at Lex in disbelief as Lex celebrates in a heelish way but still playing to the crowd (much like when Daniel Bryan won the World Title when cashing in the MITB).\n\nAt Wrestlemania we get Bret vs. Owen and Lex vs. Yokozuna for the WWF Title. Owen wins, and Lex wins the WWF Title.\n\nThe following night, Lex comes out in a suit with the WWF Title on Raw. He says how he was very happy that the fans supported him on his quest to become WWF Champion.... and then proceeds to say how stupid those fans were to think he actually needed them. That it was all a ploy to finally win what was rightfully his, the WWF Title. He then calls out his new manager Ted DiBiase. Tatanka comes out and confronts Lex, and Lex lays him out with the bionic forearm so he is out for months.\n\nLex then holds the WWF Title until King of the Ring, where he loses it to Bret. The same night Owens wins KOTR thus making him the number 1 contender for Bret's WWF Title.\n\nTatanka comes back the following night on Raw after KOTR and attacks Luger, setting up for those two to feud at SummerSlam, and we get Bret vs. Owen in the cage for the WWF Title.\n\nThat is my fantasy booking for that entire program."
