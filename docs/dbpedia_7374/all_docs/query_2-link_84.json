        "text": "Matt Davis takes a look back at the WWF Championship in 1993. This edition features runs for Bret Hart, Yokozuna, and Hulk Hogan!\n\nWelcome to the seventh edition of the Retro Championship Review on The Chairshot! This will be a biweekly article here on The Chairshot because we have a lot to discuss! In starting, my question for you is; have you ever had a discussion with a friend or in a group online about who is the greatest champion of all time? What is your defense of your claim? Wins? Quality of matches? Length of reign? In this weekly article, I will be looking back one year at a time and evaluating one specific championship in each article, with a yearly grade ranking and overall grade ranking and as we progress through the years, I will reveal who I believe is the best champion of all time.\n\nTo start us off, I am going to discuss the most recognizable championship in the history of wrestling, the WWE Heavyweight Championship. These articles will not discuss the “Big Gold” World Championship, Universal Championship, or any other recognized heavyweight championship in WWE, those will be discussed in other articles. During these reviews, I will count matches aired on weekly television, PPV, and matches also released on VHS and later on home media.\n\nBret Hart (October 12th, 1992 – April 4th, 1993)\n\nRecord: 10-1\n\nClean Losses: 0\n\nSuccessful Defenses: 6\n\nRecommended Matches to Watch\n\nBret Hart d. Ric Flair, October 12th, 1992, “WWE’s Top 50 Superstars of All-Time”\n\nBret Hart d. Shawn Michaels, November 25th, 1992, Survivor Series\n\nBret Hart d. Fatu, March 1st, 1993, Monday Night RAW\n\nThoughts: Added this to the 1993 list because of the implications of the end of this reign. Overall, it’s a very good reign, with an excellent W/L record, no clean losses (yet another dirty WWF Title change), and 6 successful defenses. The match with HBK at Survivor Series is an all time classic and showed that the two former tag team specialists were capable of special things and acted as a prelude for the rest of the decade. Threw in a gem from RAW, when those types of matches didn’t usually occur on RAW. Not a whole lot to say about, it’s a quiet reign with some really good quality which has come to be the standard for 1992-1993.\n\nGrade (A+ through F ): B-\n\nYokozuna (April 4th, 1992 – April 4th, 1992)\n\nRecord: 1-1\n\nClean Losses: 1?\n\nSuccessful Defenses: 0\n\nRecommended Matches to Watch\n\nN/A (Please never watch Wrestlemania IX)\n\nThoughts: Oh brother.\n\nGrade (A+ through F ): F\n\nHulk Hogan (April 4th, 1993 – June 13th, 1993)\n\nRecord: 1-1\n\nClean Losses: 0\n\nSuccessful Defenses: 0\n\nRecommended Matches to Watch\n\nN/A\n\nThoughts: Absolute joke of a reign. The way it started, the way it ended, zero defenses in two and a half months, zero house shows, he took the title and ran with it. Soon after, Hulkamania would be gone from the WWF.\n\nGrade (A+ through F ): F\n\nYokozuna (June 13th, 1993 – March 20th, 1994)\n\nRecord: 12-7\n\nClean Losses: 1\n\nSuccessful Defenses: 9\n\nRecommended Matches to Watch\n\nLex Luger d. Yokozuna (countout), August 30th, 1993, SummerSlam\n\nThe All Americans d. The Foreign Fanatics, November 24th, 1993, Survivor Series\n\nYokozuna d. Bret Hart, December 15th, 1993, “Inside the WWF”\n\nYokozuna d. Undertaker, January 22nd, 1994, Royal Rumble\n\nRandy Savage d. Yokozuna (DQ), February 28th, 1994, Monday Night RAW\n\nThoughts: 19 matches across 9 months as champion, one of the most active fighting champions in the titles history so far. What is to note here is the amount of losses, yet, never losing clean. This is the first reign where a heel champion reigned for so long and lost a lot while not looking weak at all. The WWF used his weight as an advantage and a disadvantage here, making him an immovable object, but also giving him several countout losses when he was toppled. This reign was memorable to me as a young child because of the Lex Express stuff, the Body Slam Challenge, and of course…. the Undertaker with the American flag attire before Survivor Series. I remember watching that and feeling beyond patriotic! His only clean loss was at Wrestlemania X. Over half his matches were quick squash matches, either against jobbers or veterans on their way out of the company.\n\nGrade (A+ through F ): B+\n\nOverall WWE Champion Ranking\n\nHulk Hogan (January 23rd, 1984 – February 5th, 1988) – A\n\nYokozuna (June 13th, 1993 – March 20th, 1994) B+\n\n“Macho Man” Randy Savage (April 5th, 1992 – September 14th, 1992) – B\n\nBret Hart (October 12th, 1992 – April 4th, 1993) B-\n\n“Macho Man” Randy Savage (March 27th, 1988 – April 2nd, 1989) – C+\n\nSgt. Slaughter (January 19th, 1991 – March 24th, 1991) – C\n\nHulk Hogan (April 2nd, 1989 – April 1st, 1990) – C\n\nHulk Hogan (March 24th — November 27th, 1991) – D+\n\nRic Flair (January 19th, 1992 — April 5th, 1992) — D\n\nThe Ultimate Warrior (April 1st, 1990- January 19th, 1991) – D\n\nRic Flair (September 14th, 1992 – October 12th, 1992) — D\n\nHulk Hogan (April 4th, 1993 – June 13th, 1993) F\n\nYokozuna (April 4th, 1992 – April 4th, 1992) F\n\nUndertaker (November 27th, 1991- December 3rd, 1991) – F\n\nHulk Hogan (December 3rd, 1991 – December 4th, 1991) – F\n\n**Speaking of championships, I am currently designing custom made championships and shirts for your wrestling figure collections!

Of all the SummerSlams I’ve seen over the years; which ones are my favorites? While it’s not a revolutionary idea, I figured everyone loves to debate favorites of well, anything. Don’t worry though because this isn’t just going to be pure recency bias. I’ve watched the majority of them so with the ones I put on the list, it hit me more in some way shape or form whether it was story, a really good match or it just felt like a solid event.\n\nAt least this proves WWE is trending in a good direction for me, when it gets the ol’ brain juices flowing just because a show is around the corner!\n\n#3: 2022 (Ol’ Brock Lesnar Has A Farm)\n\nStarting off the show, we get Bianca looking for a rematch against Becky from last years SummerSlam and it was better than the 21 second affair that everyone claims was a squash. This time Bianca holds her own and beats the Man in a fairly decent match, good way to get the event started. Next up is the heat seeking missile, Logan Paul against the former heat seeking missile because, well he wasn’t cut out for it and wasn’t a guy in everyone’s eyes, The Miz. After they had their blow off at Mania with Logan coming out on top which… isn’t awful, I just don’t like Logan Paul because he has that dude bro aura and swagger to make him more hateable than any other person on the card. Which I suppose is his gimmick…so…kudos?\n\nFirst Championship match is for the US Championship and it’s as expected that in Theory, he should never beat someone to the caliber of Bobby Lashley which is no surprise. Dominik and Rey still back when Dom wanted the good fight against the Judgement Day before joining them later. The former Colts players, which they hammered it dahn in this match up showed that the canal swimming, trash talkin’, podcastin’, current RAW Color Commentatin’ goofball we all love, Pat McAfee came out on top again Bum Ass Corbin.\n\nUsos putting the Street Profits on lockdown in the penitentiary since I believe this was peak Bloodline with the belt collecting and running all of WWE. Liv beat Ronda Rousey which isn’t astonishing but it’s not something people had on their bingo cards for anything with WWE so it was a nice little shock factor. The most memorable part of the night is obviously the Main Event, Lesnar brings the tractor, Roman catching the Microphone and Brock stands on top of the vehicle. Damn good match that showed off what they do in the ring since Roman caught his stride as the main bad guy and Brock… liked people after all of this? That is still a weird statement in my head. Brock being a good guy people person. If Liv wasn’t on bingo cards for wrestling, that is not on bingo cards in any aspect of life really.\n\nThat is more of the event that had solid matches and story going for it. No weird double count out, multiple people involved, 5 tag matches on the card. Things made sense and weren’t convoluted, had shocking moments that were great to see like Liv actually getting a title defense and there were the results we all expected at the time like Theory losing in 4 minutes to Bobby Lashley.\n\n#2: 2009 (Are You Ready for The Return?)\n\nThis event wasn’t that strong. It was strong with the star power involved in 2009 with guys like Rey Mysterio as Intercontinental Champion, Orton and Cena for the WWE Championship as it was becoming as stale as month old chips and CM Punk was facing Jeff Hardy before he ultimately returned to TNA at the beginning of 2010 after this PPV. For me, it’s not so much of the show itself, it was more of the memories because the Balai as our friends Chris Platt and Rey Cash like to call my brother and I, we were just coming back into wrestling and we were TNA Fans. We didn’t watch WWE that much really, it was just what came on after another channel had old ROH shows before they moved to three hours and swallowed the 8pm Eastern Slot. No, the reason why this has so many memories for me is three main reasons. First, Orton and Cena. They have had their rivalry since the beginning it seems, being each others foils like Hogan and Piper before them and there had to be a stipulation where if Randy was Counted Out or DQ’d, he’d lose the championship regardless. This was prime Viper Randy and the obvious joke we had of Super Cena where he very rarely lost, unless it was SummerSlam surprisingly enough.\n\nNumber two reason was CM Punk and Jeff Hardy. Hardys known for the Ladder and TLC matches in the past and this being the penultimate match for this feud and it was a banger of a match. If you didn’t know Punk before, it was a great introduction to his wrestling. I used to like Punk a lot because of this match because he could talk, wrestle… and not insanely personal with things in wrestling. In all seriousness, this was a great match. Ultimate risks, high reward for Punk grabbing the World Heavyweight Championship and he was given his next feud because of the final boss of SmackDown at that time. Thanks, Teddy Long.\n\nThe main and final reason though why this match gave me the memories flowing back is more of the fact that one of my closest and longest termed friends of 23 years, also loves wrestling. Back when we were younger, he’d do MoCap videos on YouTube with his figures. We’d have friends come over for parties at his house and we’d do the one thing WWE always told us not to do and that was try it at home. He was always stronger than me, I was always more charismatic. He had the power aspect and did things with brute force, I could talk my way out of trouble with parents if we did something wrong. There was always one thing that our respective mother’s always called us though… it’s on the tip of my tongue… oh right, ‘Degenerates’.\n\nAs soon as we were called that, we kind of parodied the DX line. I was limber enough to do the HBK pose and do a Superkick before it became the new DDT and he would just Spinebuster people and knew how to do the water spit. So what do you think was the main reason we even ordered this PPV for his 13th Birthday? I think the two guys we were pretending to be were set to return on a tank and toss out some glow sticks. The return of DX, Shawn Michaels coming back after Mania with Triple H to deal with the Legacy problem was an amazing return for them and made everything so much fun.\n\nSo we have the solid card and this one has a personal story… what’s my number one SummerSlam? Is it personal? Well yes but not going into that. Is it a good card? To me, it was a phenomenal card! Is it memorable? Seeing how wrestling fans still mention at least three matches to this day.\n\n#1: 2005 (Octopus in the Washer, Lover’s Quarrel and Where the F%#$ is Vickie?)\n\nQuite possibly some of the best matches I’ve seen and one that was just the most hilarious moments of overselling in wrestling history, I know why I love this SummerSlam but it’s also a really good card at the same time. Redacted beats Orlando Jordan in 25 seconds for the US Title and they made jokes about it like, he can make a coffee faster than he beat Orlando and stuff like that, it’s pretty funny. Angle getting sick of Eugene’s antics for his Gold Medal was also a great bit they had play up, the Year long feud of Randy Orton and Undertaker was still going on where Orton comes out on top this time around to get the win back from Mania, Jericho returning for the match with Cena in a whole promotional thing for each other’s groups, Fozzy for Jericho and the Chain Gang doing Bad, Bad Man for Cena leading up to a match for the WWE Championship. JBL won a 20 man battle royal on SmackDown to win the Championship…… Opportunity to face the newest member of SmackDown, Batista but the three main matches that a lot of people talk about to this day; Edge vs Matt Hardy, Rey vs Eddie for Dominik and Hogan vs HBK in the Main Event.\n\nI have reasons to enjoy the Hardy/Edge match but it looked like a real fight, it really made us believe that Matt Hardy was going to kill Edge because real names were dropped during this tirade from Hardy. It wasn’t Edge and Lita, it was Adam and Amy. Matt was so dead set on beating the hell out of Edge that they made a situation into gold and it was a great moment for this match to happen, I believe it was also an Unsanctioned Match too which added the intensity until matt got concussed and knocked senseless that it looked like he couldn’t fight for anything but the build up was what made it seem like a marque match. It made it feel real, it made it feel awesome and it made it feel personal.\n\nEddie kept tormenting Rey Mysterio about Dominik not being Rey’s but Eddie’s for the summer. That’s all you heard from Eddie being the weasel he was is hanging out with Dominik, making the world believe it’s his son and what not (Let’s not do a fast forward to today where he has the mullet, mustache and everything like Eddie) but they settle this in a Ladder Match where the top of it is a document for the custody of Dominik and my god, this match is better than it should have been. I expect nothing else from Eddie because the man hated having a bad match, Dom got involved and stopped Eddie, Vickie was late and stopped Eddie. The whole match was good it was just very weird with the premise but was a great match. I wonder if Rey regrets his decision to win the match now…\n\nOctopus in a Washing Machine… those five words have resonated with Shawn Michaels’ performance in this match, forever. It was supposed to be an amazing match up between Hogan and Michaels, Icon vs Icon it said and suddenly Hogan’s back gives out, can’t do a trilogy of matches so we can only do the one and then pull out of everything after. This match was set up to be a classic and instead turned into the most unbelievable sell fest ever. A Hogan big boot caused Shawn to tumble 3 or 4 times, getting crotched on the ropes had HBK bouncing higher than he should have, being tossed out of the ring made it look like Shawn never broke his back in 1998 from how much he flopped and flipped around like crazy. It’s bad… or maybe even good that a lot of current wrestlers watched this match that went, “I can sell like that, I want to be a wrestler” and did. So good or bad, I don’t know but for some reason this PPV has always had a place in my heart for how memorable it was.\n\nThose are my top three SummerSlams so far but who knows, 2024 has potential to maybe bump something or at least get me to consider a shift. Should be fun to see how the show plays out! What are some of your favorite SummerSlams?\n\nPowered by RedCircle\n\nLet us know what you think on social media @ChairshotMedia and always remember to use the hashtag #UseYourHead!\n\nIt’s obvious that John Cena is nearing the end of his legendary career, and he’s suggested ending it at WrestleMania 41. Who should be his final opponent?\n\nJohn Cena recently appeared on the Pat McAfee Show, the Monday after his surprise (but mostly expected) WrestleMania 40 appearance during Cody Rhodes’ win over Roman Reigns for the Undisputed WWE Championship. During that appearance, he confirmed what many expect, that he is nearly done with his in-ring career. But Cena even tossed out the idea of a time-frame, detailing that his acting schedule will likely take him through Christmas, and maybe Hollywood could “pump the brakes” to allow for one final run.\n\nThat run could easily begin at the Royal Rumble with a surprise entrance (or entering himself via TV appearances as part of the build), with a tease for his 17th world title win before finally settling in on his final match.\n\nFantasy booking and storytelling aside, the goal here is the final match–more specifically the final opponent. With a John Cena, you’ve got a ton of options. As such, it’s hard to narrow it down to 5, and one of your favorites is likely missing–be warned!\n\nGreg DeMarco’s Top 5: The Final Opponent For John Cena In WWE\n\nHonorable Mentions:\n\nThe Miz – A feud with John Cena gave The Mix a WrestleMania 27 main event–and a WrestleMania main event victory on top of it. Miz has been receiving more love than ever lately, and a match with John Cena would not be misplaced. Maybe he can use their WrestleMania 33 contest (and Cena’s personal aftermath) as fodder for it, too.\n\nAJ Styles – The man who once made it popular to “BEAT UP JOHN CENA” is also nearing the end of his run, and could be the one candidate on this list that could realistically give us a double-retirement match. He would also be the guy who retired both The Undertaker and John Cena (and would probably end up being the guy who lost in both).\n\nThe Rock or Cody Rhodes – Both great options, but you have to figure their dance card for WrestleMania 41 is already full, potentially standing across the ring from one another. Either is an amazing option (including “Thrice In A Lifetime”), but I just don’t think it’s in the cards.\n\nTrick Williams – Potentially a surprising addition to the Honorable Mentions, but the comparisons are there in terms of in-ring style/ability, promo skills, and the interplay they had in NXT (remember, it was Cena who is credited with encouraging Trick to not be afraid to go for it himself despite his relationship with Carmelo Hayes).\n\n5. CM Punk\n\nThe fifth spot on this list was nearly interchangeable between several of the honorable mention names, but it really came down to Punk and Seth Rollins for me (with a hint of AJ Styles). The 2011 feud between CM Punk and John Cena was legendary, and is a moment that will forever be seen by me as the one that truly cemented CM Punk as a member of the growing list of all-time greats in WWE.\n\nPunk is uniquely qualified for this match as he would make it mean more than a showboat for John Cena’s career and final match. It’s entirely believable that CM Punk would want to put John Cena’s career into the ground, and WWE has the video archive to support it.\n\nDespite being #5, this could actually be a dark-horse for the match we get, and I can’t see anyone reasonably being upset about that.\n\n4. Roman Reigns\n\nJohn Cena and Roman Reigns have had two separate legendary programs. the first saw Cena, at times, embarrass Roman in promo exchanges in a feud that took place in the “pre-Tribal Chief” era. The second is more fresh and likely more memorable, as John Cena put Roman Reigns over in a football stadium in Las Vegas at SummerSlam (although it might be more remembered for the return of Brock Lesnar).\n\nReigns, a legend himself at his point (he’s featured alongside Steve Austin at the top of the “Forever” portion of the Then/Now/Forever/Together video that recently debuted) would provide a pairing akin to The Undertaker serving as Shawn Michaels’ retirement opponent at WrestleMania 26 9notice I didn’t say “final opponent). The end of Roman’s 1316 day world title reign has brought about a new appreciation for Reigns, which would further enhance this pairing at WrestleMania 41.\n\n3. Bron Breakker\n\nBron Breakker is the picture-perfect definition of a juggernaut in WWE, a fast rising star who almost seems like a lock to main event WrestleMania one day (you never know–Seth Rollins JUST got his first WrestleMania main event last weekend). Breakker recently said farewell NXT as the natural in-ring competitor makes a transition to full-time main roster competition.\n\nBreakker also fits the category of who “needs it.” Bring the man to retire John Cena would be quite the feather in the cap of Breakker’s early career, and would give him a moment that would be relived for generations to come. The only question mark is WWE “trusting” Breakker with this moment, as a sudden change of character could mean that Cena’s final match wouldn’t be seen or discussed as much. Breakker, to me, has given no reason for anyone to suspect that might happen, regardless of any controversies his father and uncle have been linked to.\n\n2. R-Truth\n\nDespite being 5-years older than John Cena, and making his in-ring debut in the same year (1999), R-Truth’s childhood hero hanging up the boots will undoubtedly be a hard-hitting moment for the man who has basically become the WWE Mascot. Truth emulating Cena in his matches, and of course the RawAfterMania moment with Cena, Truth, and The Miz hitting a Fifteen Knuckle Shuffle (thank you, Michael Cole) on The Judgment Day makes this a near can’t miss final match for both John Cena and the WWE Universe.\n\nR-Truth himself is equally deserving of this match, as it would be a reward for all of his years in the ring as part of a career that seems age defying while proving that age is not only a number, but also a number that can be ignored (see Child Hero, John Cena).\n\nWhile a rematch of their 2011 WWE Capital Punishment main event is an unlikely WrestleMania 41 match-up, it’s one I believe everyone would love to see.\n\n1. Randy Orton\n\nI mean, is there anyone more perfect? John Cena and Randy were inseparably linked for a good portion of their careers, and have shared the ring more times than Big Show has turned babyface/heel. Both are far into legendary status at this point, and Orton specifically is obviously focused on enjoying this stage of his career.\n\nBut Orton is still delivering great performances inside the ring, too.\n\nRandy Orton vs John Cena was an exciting proposition many years ago, became a punchline for WWE booking a few years ago, but is now coming full circle as the perfect match-up to end the amazing career of John Cena. It has my vote, and should have yours, too.\n\nEven if R-Truth would be the most fun option.\n\nWhat say you? Who is the best candidate to stand across the ring from John Cena in his final WWE match, potentially at WrestleMania 41? Who did I leave out?\n\nPowered by RedCircle\n\nLet us know what you think on social media @ChairshotMedia and always remember to use the hashtag #UseYourHead!"
