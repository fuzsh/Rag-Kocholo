Basically Hogan was a punk and refused to put Bret over.\n\nD) Hogan to Bret again a few years later in WCW\n\nI didn't doubt the tug of war pic. I just doubt it instantly meant that they were going with Hogan vs Bret at a PPV. It could have been for a house show poster, it could have been for the international tour that summer, it could have been for the WWF magazine which would tease feuds all the time that never actually manifested themselves. They did Face vs Face at Summerslam 92 because of the location. Piper vs Bret was no where near the main event. You're keen to quote Bruce who's also said many, many, many times that Vince didn't think WM6 was a success BECAUSE it was Face vs Face\n\nThe logical acrobatics you have to perform to get to the stage where you argue that Vince McMahon...I'll say it again, VINCE MCMAHON, would turn down the opportunity of having a jingoistic/patriotic theme to Summerslam 93 and demote his red hot monster heel to the mid card all to have Hogan job to Bret as opposed to simply seeing it for what it was which is Luger being the 'alternative Hogan' in a Yoko vs Hogan main event at Summerslam is quite impressive.\n\nIt also overlooks the fact that by June Hogan was on his way out and they knew he wouldn't be around for Summerslam. If Vince wanted the belt on Bret why not go Bret vs Yoko? Luger's involvement in that match ONLY makes sense if you accept him for what he was, an alternative Hogan.\n\nIf Vince wanted to go with Bret then he could have easily once Hogan gave notice. It makes no sense that Vince was so keen for Bret vs Hogan to give Bret the rub as the star to build on going forward, but without Hogan he shoved Bret in the midcard and went with someone else.\n\nPeople believe the 'Bret was supposed to go over Hogan' story because they want it to be true. Nothing over than one picture whose intentions nobody knows and Bret leaking to the wrestling press the idea that Vince really, really wanted him to be champ but....\"reasons\".....suggests that Luger was anything else than a direct Hogan replacement and Bret's involvement in the title scene at SS is all just fantasy.\n\nBret: Hey Vince, you said you wanted me to be champ right?\n\nVince: Sure, pal. But that damn Hogan. He has creative control, you understand that right?\n\nBret: Yeah, but he's out of the company now right, Vince?\n\nVince: He sure is - you're the future, Bret. You're....you're the new generation. Yeah, I like that. The new generation!\n\nBret: And Hogan wouldn't drop to me at Summerslam despite the fact you told him that you wanted me as your champion?\n\nVince: That's right, damn him. I wanted Summerslam to be the re-launch of Bret Hart as WWF Champion. You like the sound of that, pal?\n\nBret: Well, Hogan's now gone now so I presume I'm going against Yoko and winning the title at Summerslam\n\nVince: Er....you see the thing is...\n\nBret: Because like you said, you wanted Hogan to job for me so logic would dictate that now you want Yoko to do the same?\n\nVince: Um......hey, look over there it's a clown!\n\nBret: That's just Doink, Vince stop changing the subject.....so I'm going over Yoko at Summerslam and winning the...\n\nVince: Ha ha ha ha! Look at that clown! I gotta go pal, I'll catch up with you later"
