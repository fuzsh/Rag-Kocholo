        "text": "WWE announced it will be bringing its 2023 SummerSlam event to Ford Field in Detroit, Michigan on August 5th. This will be WWE’s first major event to take place at the venue since WrestleMania 23, and the first SummerSlam in the state of Michigan in 30 years.\n\n“We are excited for Ford Field to host WWE’s biggest event of the summer and look forward to the WWE Universe converging on Detroit to celebrate SummerSlam’slong-awaited return to Michigan,” said Dan Ventrelle, EVP, Talent at WWE, in a press release sent out on Tuesday morning.\n\n“Landing WWE SummerSlam at Ford Field is a signature win for Detroit and continues the momentum of the Detroit Sports Commission in attracting major sporting events to the region,” said DSC Executive Director Dave Beachnau. “Metro Detroit enjoys a special place in WWE history and has produced many iconic moments. Thank you to the entire WWE family for entrusting us with this incredible opportunity, and we look forward to delivering a first-class experience.”\n\nFord Field, home of NFL football’s Detroit Lions, hosted WrestleMania 23 in 2007, and the announced crowd of 80,103 set the record attendance number for the venue at the time (it has since been broken).\n\nSummerSlam 1993 was held in the now-demolished Palace in Detroit suburb Auburn Hills. The main event of that show saw Lex Luger beat then World Champion Yokozuna in the main event. Because the win was by count-out, Luger didn’t actually win the World Championship, which somewhat fizzled the momentum Luger had built up in the weeks leading up to the event- the company had positioned Luger as a patriotic flag-waver looking to beat the Japanese (really, Samoan) champion, and even put Luger on the “Lex Express,” a cross-country bus tour in the weeks leading up to the event.\n\nTickets for SummerSlam go on sale on April 14th at Ticketmaster, with registration for pre-sale tickets open at https://www.wwe.com/summerslam2023-presale-registration.\n\nOfficial SummerSlam Priority Passes, that offer premium seating and other fan experiences, will be also be available soon – visit https://onlocationexp.com/wwe/summerslam-tickets or call 855-346-7388 for more information.\n\nStay tuned to SlamWrestling.net for more news on SummerSlam as it breaks."
