        "text": "For those who don't know the main event for SummerSlam 93 was Yokozuna vs Lex Luger (who went from a heel who was somewhat struggling to get over even though he was shoved down everyone's throats as the Narcasist gimmick for going on 6 or 7 months). Now Luger was still fresh to the WWF but his original gimmick didn't get over as well as planned. I think if they would have let the narcissism evolve he could have had a better run than he got with that gimmick. Now, this was a bizare build to your WrestleMania \"B\" ppv (and make no mistake SummerSlam had a lot more clout back in 93 than it does today). If you don't know the history of it then look it up, but my question is how should wwf have booked this card without centering it around Luger (which could have worked if they had him win the belt, but he lost all the momentum he had by not winning and from that point on became pretty irrelevant despite wwf desperately trying to get the momentum he had from the original face flip back). I have a few scenarios they could have gone with...I believe they should have had Savagevgo after the title (he and Yoko had a small history since they were the last two in the Rumble), have Savage try to make up for Hogans loss at King of the Ring, only to have Yoko defeat Savage and send him packing (either for good or temporarily) from wwf. In that scenario Yoko has ended the careers of both Hulk Hogan and Savage within months...then have everything go the same as they did with Yoko until WM 10 and Yoko would have been as much of a threat as Andre back in the mid to late 80's. The whole point to the thread is I really think the All-American Lex Luger push hurt more than just his career, and it all started because Vince felt he had no main-event for SummerSlam 93, so if you had to rebook that event how would you do it ?\n\nI think Luger was a good choice for the main event. It did seem a little strange for the Narcissistic heel to suddenly become the flag waving, baby kissing face of the company but I thought the push was really well done that summer. His Lex Express tour got him over to the point where by SummerSlam the Narcissist gimmick was a distant memory despite him having that gimmick only two months earlier.\n\nSavage isn&#8217;t a bad idea but there are a couple reasons he wouldn&#8217;t have worked. The WWF had just begun the New Generation campaign. Hogan leaving was obviously a major turning point in the company and the WWF was in a phase where they were distancing themselves from their past. Savage just didn&#8217;t fit into the main event scene anymore in 1993. He didn&#8217;t even wrestle at WrestleMania that year. Since WWF was in this out with the old in with the new phase Yoko taking Savage out could have worked but that would have meant SummerSlam ending on a down note for the fans. Pay per views usually didn&#8217;t end with the heel on top in those days. These days with PPVs every month and a three hour Raw and two hour Smackdown every week a heel winning the main event of a ppv is more acceptable. There&#8217;s another show just around the corner for justice to be served. In 1993 there were only five PPVs per year and the weekly shows typically only featured squash matches. The ppv needed to send the fans home happy.\n\nI would have left Luger in the main event. I&#8217;ve always kind of been on the fence about putting the belt on him that night. I get that they were waiting for mania before dethroning Yoko but not winning the title at SummerSlam really killed Luger&#8217;s momentum that he spent the summer building. That push was strong enough to crown a new champion. I think I would have booked Luger to win the belt that night. He would have either kept his momentum and sustained his popularity by winning the title, and if not there was plenty of time to get the belt back on Yoko and have Hart take it at mania."
