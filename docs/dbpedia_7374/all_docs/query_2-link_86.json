        "text": "7. Steve Austin vs. Mankind vs. Triple H – SummerSlam 1999\n\nYou know what is just no fun? Politics. That is exactly what caused SummerSlam 1999 to be a little bit wonky. Steve Austin was maybe the biggest WWE star of all time and he held on to that spot on-screen and backstage.\n\nIn 1999, Triple H was set to become WWE’s top heel. His coronation was meant to happen at this show by beating Austin to become WWE Champion but Austin put the ixnay on that.\n\nInstead, the match was a three-way with Mankind winning the title. Go back in time and fix this one, please.\n\nTriple H’s first title win would have been a bigger moment beating Austin at SummerSlam. Triple H would beat Austin in the future and Austin was heading for surgery so just let Triple H get the win.\n\n6. Lex Luger vs. Yokozuna – SummerSlam 1993\n\nLex Luger never reached the pinnacle of WWE. The closest he came was at SummerSlam 1993 when he challenged Yokozuna for the WWE Championship.\n\nWWE didn’t pull the trigger on Luger, instead having him win by countout. How could WWE have done this better? Well, there are a couple of ways.\n\nFirst, get Luger out of the picture. The original plan for the show was to have Hulk Hogan pass the torch to Bret Hart. However, Hogan did not allow that to happen, instead leaving the company.\n\nIf you have absolute control over the booking, you make this match happen as this would be a true passing of the torch moment.\n\nIf we are being realistic, then replace Luger with Bret Hart. Hart was who the fans were most interested in and he would end up beating Yokozuna for the title at WrestleMania X. Just do it here. Problem solved.\n\n5. Roman Reigns vs. Brock Lesnar – SummerSlam 2018\n\nRoman Reigns vs. Brock Lesnar was the feud no one wanted to see in 2018. They main evented WrestleMania 34 in a debacle of a match, which was rejected by the live crowd. WWE’s response to this was to continue to book them together through the summer. Naturally.\n\nNot only was their SummerSlam match a mess and a blatant attempt to manipulate their fans, it was simply a match that made very little sense.\n\nReigns had lost clean to Bobby Lashley the month prior, which would lead one to believe Lashley would be in line for a title shot. Nope. Didn’t happen.\n\nIf we are rebooking this match, it needs to be either Lashley vs. Lesnar, or at the very least a three-way. Then, maybe we don’t tell the fans Braun Strowman is going to cash in Money in the Bank and then immediately cut to black when Reigns wins. Just a thought.\n\n4. Diesel vs. Mabel – SummerSlam 1995\n\nThere probably doesn’t need to be much said about why this match shouldn’t have main evented SummerSlam. I mean, look at this match. Stevie Wonder could see this was a bad idea.\n\nIf you want to have this bizarre tall man vs. fat man match then so be it. However, do not have it go on last.\n\nYou could rework the WWE Championship match altogether, but it likely wouldn’t be better than the clear choice for the main event. Shawn Michaels and Razor Ramon in their ladder match sequel.\n\nThe match took place in the semi-main event and was a worthy successor to their legendary clash at WrestleMania. You had to know that match would be excellent. Just put it on last and send the people home happy.\n\nmain events\n\nlists\n\nSummerSlam\n\nwwe\n\nShare this article with friends"
