        "text": "29. Lex Luger vs. Yokozuna – SummerSlam 1993\n\nLex Luger’s push culminated at SummerSlam 1993. Now, Luger was never a particularly good bell to bell, and Yokozuna being his opponent didn’t help.\n\nYokozuna was incredibly agile for his size but being that big had its limitations.\n\nThis match would likely have been much better if it had a proper finish. Rather than getting a big pinfall or submission win in this CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH, Luger won by countout and celebrated as if he had won the title. It was a letdown and Luger’s push was never the same.\n\n28. Braun Strowman vs. ‘The Fiend’ Bray Wyatt – SummerSlam 2020\n\nBraun Strowman and Bray Wyatt had a rivalry that was about as bad as can be in 2020. This rivalry culminated in a Falls Count Anywhere match at SummerSlam 2020 and boy was it a stinker.\n\nThis match is only remembered now for the return of Roman Reigns, which took place after the match. During the match? No good.\n\nBraun Strowman is not a super worker by any means and The Fiend needs a special kind of opponent to make his matches bearable. This was not a winning equation and as such we got this mess of a match and the less said about it the better.\n\n27. Roman Reigns vs. Brock Lesnar – SummerSlam 2018\n\nBy the time SummerSlam 2018 rolled around, fans were sick of Roman Reigns chasing the title. Fans had been told Reigns was going to dethrone Brock Lesnar for a year and a half and they wanted no part of it.\n\nThis was during a time when WWE was trying to viciously fight their fans and this was a perfect example of it. This match was not great to begin with but made worse by its presentation.\n\nBraun Strowman was Mr. Money in the Bank and declared he was cashing in at the end of the match. This was done to keep fans from turning on the match. To an extent it worked.\n\nStrowman was taken out before the end of the match and when Reigns won they immediately cut to black.\n\nOnce fans realized they weren’t getting a cash-in they were furious but the show was off the air by then. It was incredibly manipulative and continued to push fans from the product.\n\n26. Mega Powers vs. Mega Bucks – SummerSlam 1988\n\nThe inaugural SummerSlam event had a big main event to go with it. The Mega Powers saw the two biggest stars in the company join forces as Hulk Hogan and Randy Savage took on Ted DiBiase and Andre the Giant.\n\nThis match had a big match feel, something that couldn’t be said for the next few years.\n\nHogan and Savage were incredibly popular and they pulled off a pretty decent match with their foes.\n\nEveryone remembers Miss Elizabeth removing her skirt to distract the heels, although her bikini bottom would hardly turn heads in 2020. It was an entertaining ending to an entertaining match.\n\n25. Mankind vs. Steve Austin vs. Triple H – SummerSlam 1999\n\nThe main event of SummerSlam 1999 was just kind of wonky. This was meant to be the coronation of Triple H as the new top heel but Steve Austin didn’t want to lose to him.\n\nInstead, Mankind was added to the match to get the win before dropping the title to Triple H on Raw.\n\nAt this point, Austin was starting to feel his neck problems again and Mankind was heading towards retirement.\n\nIt was fine but there wasn’t the kind of impact that a singles match with Austin and Triple H would have had.\n\nlists\n\nmain event\n\nSummerSlam\n\nwwe\n\nShare this article with friends"
