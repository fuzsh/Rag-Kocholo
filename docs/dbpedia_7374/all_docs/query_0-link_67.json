        "text": "SummerSlam 1993\n\nWhat was the main event? Lex Luger vs. Yokozuna\n\nWhat was it going to be? Bret Hart vs. Hulk Hogan\n\nWhy did it change? According to Bret Hart, he had been promised a title shot (and victory) over Hulk Hogan following the shenanigans of WrestleMania IX, where he dropped the WWF Title to Yokozuna and Hogan beat the new champ seconds later.\n\nAlthough a photo shoot took place for WWF Magazine designed to promote the match, behind the scenes issues with Hogan and McMahon meant it never happened.\n\nVince told Hart that Hogan refused to put him over and told Hogan that Hart did not believe he was on his level, passing the buck so the heat was not on him. It caused years of bad blood between Bret and Hulk.\n\nHogan instead dropped the title to Yokozuna at King of the Ring and left the WWF. Lex Luger was installed as Vince’s next wholesome American superhero and given the Yokozuna match at SummerSlam. He won the bout via countout and thus not the title, completely neutering him.\n\nchanges\n\nSummerSlam\n\nJon Moxley\n\nwwe\n\nShare this article with friends"
