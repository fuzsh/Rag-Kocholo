        "text": "Post by sungod2020 on\n\nSo we all know the story of how WWF suddenly pushed Lex Luger to the moon in preparation to his WWF championship match against the Almighty Yokozuna. They even paraded around the Total Package all across the country with a bus dubbed \"The Lex Express.\"\n\nWith Hogan gone, the company was hellbent on filling the void of an All-American Hero, and while Luger looked the part, it felt forced especially since for the first six months with the company, he was dubbed \"The Narcisist\" a cocky heel who loved looking at himself in the mirror. It also didn't help matters that he(and the rest of the babyface locker room) looked like a total doofus CELEBRATING A COUNT-OUT WIN WITH BALLOONS FALLING FROM THE CEILING. HE DIDN'T EVEN WITH THE CHAHMPIONSHIP. Not to mention he signed a contract that it would be his only title shot in the foreseeable future, making him look like a bigger idiot.\n\nAccording to insider sources however, that wasn't the originally planned main event. The planned main event was supposedly Hulk Hogan defending his WWF championship against Bret \"The Hitman\" Hart, however Hogan backed out, preferring to drop the belt back to Yokozuna at King of The Ring and leave the company shortly thereafter.\n\nHowever, let's say sharing a ring with The Excellence of Execution, where would that leave Luger and Yokozuna? I know it's hard to picture Hogan agreeing to submit to the sharpshooter, let alone doing it, so I'm not so focused on the outcome. How would that affect the rest of the card? I can picture much of it staying the same, but I'm wondering where Luger and Yoko factor in.\n\nThanks.\n\nPost by dangerousdanpotato on\n\nInteresting \"what if\".\n\nMaybe they would have still run the Bodyslam challenge, with Crush actually being successful, leading to a full match between Crush and Yokozuna at Summerslam. This would culminate in the post-match injury angle that played on out on RAW with Crush getting squished and sent away for a few months.\n\nLex would remain heel, and assuming that Bret wins the WWF title from Hogan, would be set up as his next feud and title challenger (the seeds having been sown at the WrestleMania press conference). If Vince could swallow his pride and let Randy Savage wrestle, he'd be a great choice to put Lex over here. Otherwise it's Bob Backlund, Jim Duggan or maybe Owen Hart to transition into the Bret feud.\n\nThat leaves Jerry Lawler with nothing to do, but I don't think Jerry necessarily needs a match; I always assumed he was brought off the commentary desk and into the ring to placate Bret for not being in the title picture.\n\nPost by PrimeTyme on\n\nInteresting what if here.\n\nI guess Bret vs Hogan is set up as a face vs. face match with maybe Hogan stating that Bret lost the title due to Fuji and that he’s offering up the title match with Bret.\n\nThis could also be made official at the King of the Ring pay per view with a live contract signing.\n\nThat takes Bret out of the tournament which is now going to look like this:\n\nRazor Ramon\n\nMr. Perfect\n\nBam Bam Bigelow\n\nTatanka\n\nYokozuna\n\nJim Duggan\n\nCrush\n\nLex Luger\n\nPerfect defeats Razor\n\nBigelow defeats Tatanka ends the undefeated streak earlier than original\n\nYoko defeats Duggan in about 10min and ends that feud for good\n\nCrush and Luger have a match that goes to a double DQ after Mr. Fuji comes to ringside and throws salt in both mens eyes. Yokozuna then attacks both men and hits Banzai drops on them both and they are taken out on stretchers and off television.\n\nPerfect defeats Bigelow and then goes on to lose to Yokozuna in the finals.\n\nYokozuna is the inaugural King of the Ring.\n\nOn July 4 aboard the USS Intrepid we still have the bodyslam challenge. Crush returns and answers the challenge, but his ribs are still taped up and he’s unable to lift the mighty Yokozuna.\n\nAt the end of the day, a helicopter arrives and out steps Lex Luger who body slams Yoko and sets up a big match at Summerslam.\n\nPost by horsemen4ever on\n\nI feel like even if Hogan put over Bret, he wouldn't have agreed to tapping to the Sharpshooter. It'd have probably been some kind of reversal into a pin from Bret, or maybe taking Bret's piledriver or maybe Bret's second rope elbow, but submitting strikes me as super not happening.\n\nNor should it. I'm not the biggest Hogan fan and would have liked seeing him put over Bret, but tapping to the sharpshooter would do Hogan's character so much damage. They could have come up with a really good finish though, like Bret vs. Piper, where Bret can go over without the other guy losing face.\n\nWell he had no problem submitting to the torture rack nor this exact same hold at Starrcade 97.\n\nPost by ThankGodForSidJustice on\n\nI feel like even if Hogan put over Bret, he wouldn't have agreed to tapping to the Sharpshooter. It'd have probably been some kind of reversal into a pin from Bret, or maybe taking Bret's piledriver or maybe Bret's second rope elbow, but submitting strikes me as super not happening.\n\nBret was also slated to wrestle Warrior at Rumble or Mania 9, depending on the story you believe, where he also stated he was gonna win the Sharpshooter.\n\nSo, he wrestles Hogan in a Land of Chocolate Match….on the Moon! Because there’s no chance in Hell Warrior and Hogan are tapping in the span of 6 months or ever.\n\nI can't believe that Bret actually believes he was going to submit Hogan and Warrior. Even if that's what Vince actually wanted there's no way either of those two would agree to that. Heck I'm having a tough time envisioning Bret even pinning either of them. I don't how they would even do that. I guess it would have to be on some kind of cradle move.\n\nPost by Mozenrath on\n\nI feel like even if Hogan put over Bret, he wouldn't have agreed to tapping to the Sharpshooter.

Because there’s no chance in Hell Warrior and Hogan are tapping in the span of 6 months or ever.\n\nWarrior feels more possible, at least, but I still wonder if it'd be a submission. Maybe the \"passes out in the hold\", but yeah, even with Vince pushing Bret, having both guys submit to Bret feels like a long shot. I do recall Warrior liked Owen a lot, so maybe he'd have been cool with it, but he would not have done it cheap.\n\nNor should it. I'm not the biggest Hogan fan and would have liked seeing him put over Bret, but tapping to the sharpshooter would do Hogan's character so much damage.

Putting over his successor was a different thing entirely.\n\nPost by bluebeach25 on\n\nBret was also slated to wrestle Warrior at Rumble or Mania 9, depending on the story you believe, where he also stated he was gonna win the Sharpshooter.\n\nSo, he wrestles Hogan in a Land of Chocolate Match….on the Moon!

I guess it would have to be on some kind of cradle move.\n\nThe Bret/Warrior match being planned for 93 is known for decades at this point, it's just unclear how close it ever was to really happening! There is no way Warrior would have been cool with losing to Bret or even worse losing to him by tapping out... Bret said that Jim always treated him with Respect so there was no heat, but still Warrior wouldn't have jobbed to Bret in early 93!\n\nBret pinning Hogan at Summerslam 93 would have been a mistake, i'm glad that never took place.\n\nPost by sungod2020 on\n\nInteresting \"what if\".\n\nMaybe they would have still run the Bodyslam challenge, with Crush actually being successful, leading to a full match between Crush and Yokozuna at Summerslam.

If he can't outsmart a clown, what chance does the Native Hawaiian have against a former WWF champion 500 plus pound bohemeth?\n\nPost by dangerousdanpotato on\n\nInteresting \"what if\".\n\nMaybe they would have still run the Bodyslam challenge, with Crush actually being successful, leading to a full match between Crush and Yokozuna at Summerslam.

If he can't outsmart a clown, what chance does the Native Hawaiian have against a former WWF champion 500 plus pound bohemeth?\n\nI totally agree. I think that whole feud was bad for Crush; from a booking point both guys were relatively new and it was each man's first proper feud. Better for each to go up against a veteran that can absorb losing a feud. e.g. if they could have kept him, Boss Man would have been a good feud for Doink.\n\nAnyway, they still could have given Crush a win and a decisive blow-off to make him look like less of a chump. Instead they had Crush beat Doink by countout on Superstars and then get battered again in a post-match beat down."
