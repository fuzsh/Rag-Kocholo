        "meta_description": "Joined by special guest, Russ from the Infectious Groove Music Podcast/YouTube channel, we jump back into our WWE 30 Year Time Machine series to pick up where the '93 King of the Ring PPV leaves off with the infamously terrible WWF SUMMERSLAM 1993 from Auburn Hills, Michigan.

Up to and including its very lackluster main event, this PPV felt more like a glorified house show/TV episode of Monday Night RAW, but is it truly the worst SummerSlam of all time?
