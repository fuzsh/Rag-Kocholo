        "text": "AP Photo/Carlos Osorio\n\nWWE announced Tuesday that SummerSlam 2023 will be held at Ford Field in Detroit on Aug. 5.\n\nWWE Executive Vice President of Talent Dan Ventrelle said the following about the decision to choose Detroit as the host city for SummerSlam: \"We are excited for Ford Field to host WWE's biggest event of the summer and look forward to the WWE Universe converging on Detroit to celebrate SummerSlam's long-awaited return to Michigan.\"\n\nSince its inception in 1988, SummerSlam has never been held within the confines of the Motor City, although the 1993 edition of the event did take place in nearby Auburn Hills, Michigan, at The Palace of Auburn Hills, which was then the home of the NBA's Detroit Pistons.\n\nFord Field, which has been the home of the NFL's Detroit Lions since 2002, has not played host to any WWE event since WrestleMania 23 in 2007.\n\nWWE once steered away from holding events at large stadiums rather than arenas aside from WrestleMania, but in recent years, it has expanded some of its major shows so more fans can attend.\n\nSummerSlam is the greatest example of that, as the 2021 edition took place at the Las Vegas Raiders' Allegiant Stadium and last year's SummerSlam was held at the Tennessee Titans' Nissan Stadium.\n\nThe Royal Rumble has also expanded to bigger venues, including the Arizona Diamondbacks' Chase Field in 2019, the Houston Astros' Minute Maid Park in 2020, The Dome at America's Center in St. Louis in 2022 and the Alamodome in San Antonio this year.\n\nSince WWE has been able to prove demand for its tentpole premium live events, sticking with the trend made perfect sense for SummerSlam 2023.\n\nWWE's next large-scale event is WrestleMania 39, which will emanate from SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, on April 1 and 2, and is set to be headlined by an undisputed WWE Universal Championship match between Roman Reigns and Cody Rhodes.\n\nWrestleMania 39 has already set records for attendance revenue, and if the company remains on its current hot streak, SummerSlam 2023 may be in line to be the most attended and profitable SummerSlam of all time as well."
