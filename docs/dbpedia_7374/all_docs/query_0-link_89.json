Fatu staggered to his feet after the move and could be seen delivering frantic instructions to Solo Sikoa on how to proceed without him. It is clear that a returning Roman Reigns was supposed to rescue Rhodes from Fatu and Solo but with Fatu incapacitated WWE called an audible and had Reign lay out Solo when Rhodes really didn’t need much assistance, had things well in hand.\n\nFatu was spotted being unable to walk and had to be assisted to the back after suffering the injury."
