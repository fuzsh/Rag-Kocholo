        "text": "DETROIT -- WWE’s second biggest event of the year is coming to Detroit and tickets for SummerSlam are now on sale. Although a presale has been ongoing throughout the week, the public began Friday morning and as of 10:30 a.m. plenty of tickets were still available.\n\nHowever, if you want to be one of the tens of thousands of fans that pack into Ford Field on Saturday, August 5, you’ll need to be ready to pay up. According to the seating map on Ticketmaster, third row floor seats are priced at $4,000 per seat for a “Platinum VIP experience.” Seats in the third row from the back in the same section are $400.\n\nIf you want to sit off the floor and in the first few rows of the lower bowl, those tickets are around $800 per seat, whiles seats near the back of the lower bowl are around $300. Club seats are in the range of $400 to $550 depending on the section.\n\nUpper bowl seats near the top of the stadium are at least $250. Seats in the back rows of the upper bowl have already sold out as they were cheaper than rows closer and secondary retailers have seats in those rows for roughly $90 before fees.\n\nWWE has not held a show at Ford Field since 2007′s WrestleMania 23 wehn an estimated 80,103 people were in attendance. Earlier this month an estimated 160,000 fans attended WrestleMania in Los Angeles which was held over two nights and feature two separate cards.\n\nWWE last held SummerSlam in Michigan in 1993 when the show took place at The Palace of Auburn Hills.\n\nAlthough SummerSlam is nearly four months away, promotional material for the show advertises stars such as WWE Universal Champion Roman Reigns, Raw Women’s Champion Bianca Belair, Cody Rhodes, and Brock Lesnar for the show.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nWWE’s ‘Nightmare’ Cody Rhodes makes dream come true for 7-year-old Detroit girl\n\nReport: WWE meets with Michigan officials over possibly allowing gambling on wrestling matches"
