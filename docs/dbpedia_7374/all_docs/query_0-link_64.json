        "text": "Solo Sikoa came out first, without any of his fellow Bloodline members. After Cody Rhodes agreed this would be a \"Bloodline Rules\" match on SmackDown, Tama Tonga, Jacob Fatu and Tonga Loa would undoubtedly get involved.\n\nRhodes entrance began in his trailer, and as he exited he was met by his dog Pharaoh. Rhodes was then met by wrestling legend Arn Anderson, who teased some help coming for Rhodes during the match. Rhodes was given his American Nightmare jacket and a winged eagle skull mask as he went through Gorilla and emerged.\n\nRhodes and Sikoa circled before engaging in a collar-and-elbow tie-up — the first such start of a match tonight. Sikoa looked powerful early, unfazed by a couple of shoulder tackles and thwarting Rhodes' patented drop-down slap. While Sikoa's power was evident in the early stages, Rhodes' speed and wit was on display.\n\nAction spilled outside the ring as Rhodes landed a Disaster Kick and suicide dive on Sikoa, but the challenger was not down for long, as he met a second dive attempt with a blow to the head before both men returned to the ring.\n\nAs Rhodes went for his scoop powerslam, Sikoa faked him out, unveiling another layer of his ring psychology. Sikoa kept up the offensive with a pair of near-falls and teasing the Samoan Spike, but Rhodes countered with two kicks and a Cody Cutter. Rhodes stayed on the offensive, sending Sikoa outside the ring briefly.\n\nAfter some quick offense, Rhodes played the hits, landing his drop-down slap and the Bionic Elbow before a Disaster Kick attempt was countered with a powerbomb and near-fall from Sikoa. The momentum swung back into the Tribal Chief's favor, who landed a huge running maneuver on Rhodes in the corner and a spinning uranage for yet another near-fall.\n\nSikoa tied Rhodes up in the Tree of Woe and connected on a pair of flying headbutts. Sikoa taunted before going for a third headbutt, allowing Rhodes to evade the maneuver and land a top-rope cross body. Rhodes' brief rally was snuffed out by another spinning uranage. Sikoa took his time, taunting as he went to the top rope, allowing Rhodes to recover for a massive superplex.\n\nBoth men exchanged blows as they battled to their feet. Rhodes gained the upper hand and landed a CrossRhodes. This brought out the first interference on behalf of the Bloodline, as Tama Tonga and Tonga Loa emerged to assault Rhodes. Sikoa attempted to make the cover, but Rhodes kicked out. As the Bloodline attack continued, Kevin Owens rushed to Rhodes' aid.\n\nOwens briefly battled the Bloodline but was overwhelmed, drawing out Randy Orton. Orton swung things back into the babyfaces' favor, as him and Owens took out all three members of the Bloodline. Rhodes recovered to hit a CrossRhodes on Sikoa, but the challenger kicked out at two. The four interlopers exited, battling through the crowd.\n\nRhodes tossed steel steps into the ring, using them to hit Sikoa in the head twice, but the challenger was held up by the turnbuckle. As Rhodes with for a third blow, Sikoa delivered a huge spear for a near-fall. Sikoa set up the steel stairs and went for another rear-view on Rhodes against the stairs. The champion moved out of the way and began to set up a triple CrossRhodes. After the second finisher, Jacob Fatu broke into the match and took out Rhodes.\n\nFatu dragged Sikoa to cover Rhodes, but the champion kicked out at two. Fatu continued his assault on Rhodes outside the ring, setting up Rhodes on the announce table. Fatu climbed to the top turnbuckle and landed a frogsplash on Rhodes through the table. Sikoa put Rhodes back into the ring and hit a frogsplash of his own, but Rhodes was resilient as ever, kicking out again.\n\nRhodes rebounded with a superkick and a top-rope Cody Cutter. As both men were laid out in the ring, Roman Reigns' music hit and the former champion and Bloodline leader emerged for the first time since losing to Rhodes at WrestleMania 40.\n\nReigns ran into the ring and delivered a Superman Punch and spear to Sikoa before staring down and nodding at Rhodes. Reigns then exited without saying a word. Rhodes, not taking his eyes off Reigns, delivered CrossRhodes to Sikoa and pinned him to retain his title.\n\nCody Rhodes def. Solo Sikoa in 29:13 to retain the Undisputed WWE Championship.\n\nGunther, the winner of the 2024 King of the Ring, was first to the ring in the night's penultimate match. He had a record-setting Intercontinental Championship reign end at WrestleMania 40 earlier this year.\n\nIn a rare change for his title reign, Priest entered to cheers as Gunther has worked heel primarily during this feud.\n\nGunther charged at Priest after a brief staredown but was met with a massive fist. The champion briefly held the upper hand early, landing a series of high-impact moves and sending the action outside the ring. Gunther recovered while on the outside, utilizing the ring apron to inflict punishment on the champion before returning inside the ropes to break the countout.\n\nPriest went for a suplex on Gunther but was unable to get the Ring General over his head. Gunther delivered a massive chop and suplex for a near-fall. The challenger attempted to go to the top turnbuckle, but Priest hit several blows and a kick before a top-rope hurricanrana and broken arrow suplex led to a near-fall of his own.\n\nAs Gunther attempted to get off the mat, he was met with kicks to the chest by Priest. The champion fought threw several chops from Gunther to take down the champion and break open his chest. Every time Gunther attempted to gain the upper hand, Priest delivered a more-punishing blow. Finally, a drop kick and powerbomb allowed Gunther to get a near-fall and breather.\n\nAnother powerbomb attempt from Gunther was countered by a roundhouse kick and South of Heaven clothesline, but Gunther kicked out at two. Priest then signaled for the Razor's Edge, but was unable to lift Gunther. Instead, the two men briefly exchanged counters before Gunther scored a near-fall after a flurry of clotheslines and an exploder suplex.\n\nPriest taunted Gunther, telling him to \"bring it\" twice with a hand signal. Gunther circled the ring, taunting fans and hitting Priest every time he tried to get up beyond all fours. Priest's Judgment Day running mate Finn Balor emerged during this sequence to try and rally the champion. Gunther turned his attention to Balor, taking him out with a kick.\n\nThat brief reprieve allowed Priest to rally and finally land the Razor's Edge and South of Heaven on Gunther. As Priest went for the cover, Balor crossed him and put Gunther's leg on the bottom rope, breaking the pin. Priest didn't see it in real time, but saw the replay on the screen in Cleveland Browns Stadium.\n\nDistracted by Balor, Priest fell victim to a sleeper from Gunther. Priest had a short rally, but a powerbomb and second sleeper from Gunther finished the match.\n\nGunther def. Damian Priest in 16:40 to win the World Heavyweight Championship.\n\nRollins, the special guest referee, was first to come out. The fashion-forward WWE star came out with a black-and-white robe inspired by an official's gear. He was also teased by Michael Cole as wearing WWE's referee camera earpiece.\n\nMcIntyre's ring gear was decidedly less flashy as he emerged from backstage. Decked out in black-and-wintergreen gear, McIntyre stalked down the ramp, not interacting with fans or taking his eyes off Rollins in the center of the ring. McIntyre and Rollins shared a brief exchange, with Rollins pointing to the WWE emblem on his referee shirt as a threat.\n\nCM Punk drew the largest fan reaction as he made his way to the ring. It was the first time in more than 10 years that Punk was in a singles match in WWE. Punk returned to WWE last November at Survivor Series and was injured in the Royal Rumble in January earlier this year. Punk's pink and black ring gear looked like a callback to Bret 'Hitman' Hart, who had a memorable SummerSlam match against British Bulldog at Wembley Stadium in 1992.\n\nMcIntyre and Punk wasted no time beating down on each other. Punk gained the upper hand early but refused to stop pummeling McIntyre in the corner, forcing Rollins to interfere. McIntyre ran the same spot back right after.\n\nPunk forced McIntyre to the outside and too him out with a flying clothesline from the apron to the floor. Punk then sent McIntyre to the timekeeper's area. As the two men brawled, Rollins relaxed in the ring, not counting out either man or enforcing any rules whatsoever.\n\nMcIntyre thwarted Punk's attempt to return to the ring, swinging him twice into the announce table. McIntyre's assault continued as he slingshotted Punk into the bottom of the ring while Rollins watched. The action returned to the ring and McIntyre continued to deliver punishment with a massive chop and snap suplex. McIntyre went for the pin but Punk quickly rolled out before Rollins could get into position to count. After an overhead belly-to-belly suplex and cover by McIntyre, Rollins repeated his slow moves, drawing more stares from McIntyre.\n\nA brief flurry from Punk was countered by a pair of big powerbombs from McIntyre, each drawing a near-fall. After the second, McIntyre confronted Rollins. McIntyre then retreated outside the ring to get a steel chair.\n\nMcIntyre pleaded with Rollins to let him use the chair and Rollins turned his back before quickly pulling the chair away from McIntyre. Punk recovered and quickly rolled up McIntyre, but Rollins didn't see fast enough to count beyond one. As McIntyre went for a Claymore Kick, Punk met him with a quartet of flying knees and a neckbreaker. Punk's momentum continued with a big elbow for a near-fall.\n\nAfter the kickout, Punk quickly locked in a submission hold and ripped a bracelet off McIntyre's arm. Distracted by the bracelet, Punk allowed McIntyre to hit a Claymore for a near-fall. Rollins grabbed the bracelet in the aftermath, per his referee duties.\n\nMcIntyre went for a Future Shock DDT, but Punk countered and sent him into the ringpost. Punk then teased and set up his Go To Sleep finisher before realizing Rollins was wearing the bracelet and dropping McIntyre to confront the official. McIntyre then hit Punk and Rollins. Punk avoided another DDT attempt from McIntyre to land the GTS, but with Rollins incapacitated, there was no official to make the count. Rollins and Punk got into it after this sequence and the exchange ended with Punk hitting GTS on Rollins and retrieving his bracelet.\n\nMcIntyre, fully recovered, landed a low blow and Claymore on Punk to score the win afterwards.\n\nDrew McIntyre def. CM Punk in 16:58\n\nNia Jax, who earned this championship match by winning the 2024 Queen of the Ring tournament, entered first. Bayley, the champion, was the crowd favorite and hasn't lost a singles match since January.\n\nBayley started the match on the offensive, and attempted to take out Jax's arm. Bayley's early momentum was snuffed out relatively quickly by a massive Samoan drop from Jax. Jax taunted the crowd as she continued to overpower the champion.\n\nJax tried to wear Bayley down with a Cobra Clutch in the center of the ring. Bayley began to fight back and the champion finally mounted some offense with a suplex and elbow to Jax's head. Bayley evaded Jax to send her outside the ring and then dodged a leg drop on the ring apron. The champion kept the pressure up with a leaping strike off the steel steps.\n\nAs Jax went for a stalled standing suplex, Bayley locked in a guillotine choke. The powerful Jax muscled her way out before landing a rolling senton and leg drop for a near-fall. Jax, looking to finish off Bayley, went for a second-rope leg drop that Bayley ducked. The champ then quickly tried to capitalize with a Bayley-to-Belly finisher, but Jax kicked out.\n\nA massive uranage allowed Jax to land her Annihilator finisher and try to pin Bayley, but the champion kicked out at the last second. Jax, frustrated began to beat down Bayley with a series of headbutts and strikes, taunting the entire time. Bayley again dodged a charging Jax, sending the challenger outside the ring. As she went for a suicide dive outside the ring, Bayley was caught by Jax who landed another Samoan drop.\n\nJax's onslaught continued, but as she went for her Annihilator finisher, Bayley managed to powerbomb the challenger off the second rope. Bayley then rushed to the top rope and hit a big elbow for an impressive near-fall.\n\nWith both competitors down, Tiffany Stratton rushed to the ring to attempt to cash in her Money in the Bank contract. Stratton was met with a fist from Bayley. The distraction was enough to allow Jax to recover and land two powerbombs and two Annihilators to score the pinfall victory.\n\nNia Jax def. Bayley in 12:35 to win the WWE Women's Championship.\n\nPaul, who is from Cleveland, came out first to an outpouring of boos from the SummerSlam crowd. He was accompanied to the ring by fellow Cleveland native Machine Gun Kelly. Notably, Paul was the first champion to make their way to the ring before the challenger.\n\nBefore he made his way to the ring, LA Knight emerged from Logan Paul's Prime Hummer EV and broke the driver's side window. Knight was all business as he made his walk to the ring. As Knight hopped onto the ring apron, Paul attacked and the two men brawled outside the ring.\n\nKnight had the upper hand, sending Paul into the barricade and over the Prime hydration station. Paul spit Prime into Knight's face and prepped the announce table to be destroyed. Paul's antics backfired as Knight recovered and landed a massive neckbreaker on Paul onto the announce table, which didn't break.\n\nWhen the bell finally rang, Knight scored a near-fall quickly but Paul regained himself and sent Knight shoulder-first into two of the ringposts. Paul landed a split leg drop for his own near-fall and the two men began to exchange blows in the center of the ring.\n\nPaul continued his offensive with a gut-wrench suplex and reverse power bomb. Knight opted for brute force as he turned the tide in his favor, using punches, kicks and knee strikes to take down the champion. Knight showed off impressive athleticism with a leap from the second to the top rope for a big elbow and a near-fall.\n\nThe match shifted again as Paul hit a springboard clothesline followed up by a massive springboard moonsault. The fans showed their admiration for the maneuver by chanting \"you still suck.\"\n\nAs the action returned to the ring, Paul went for his finishing punch, which Knight countered. Paul then landed a backslide pinning combination and hit his finisher on Knight, who kicked out at two. Paul went for a second frogsplash, but was met at the top turnbuckle by Knight who landed a massive avalanche brainbuster.\n\nPaul escaped outside the ring looking to get his brass knuckles, but Knight hit him with a baseball slide and then took out Paul's cronies ringside. Machine Gun Kelly then handed Paul brass knuckles, Paul used the knuckles on Knight and went for a slingshot clothesline, but was met with Knight's Blunt Force Trauma finisher. Knight quickly pinned Paul to win his first championship.\n\nLA Knight def. Logan Paul in 11:59 to win the United States Championship.\n\nRhea Ripley was first to make her entrance, as the camera followed her and Dominik Mysterio through Gorilla Position and out to the ramp. Ripley and Mysterio appeared confident as they sauntered to the ring.\n\nDuring Ripley's entrance, Michael Cole teased that the referee for the match would be wearing a camera, offering new visual insight into the match.\n\nMorgan, the champion, had a speedier entrance and the crowd was very clearly behind Ripley. As Morgan made her way to the ring, Cole teased that Morgan was the last person to pin Ripley in a singles match, more than two years ago.\n\nAfter a brief staredown once the bell rang, Morgan rolled outside the ring, baiting Ripley into chasing her before returning to the ring. Ripley ran back in, but Morgan repeated the sequence — twice, drawing boos from the crowd. Ripley then faked out Morgan, leaving the two women face-to-face in the ring. Ripley began to beat down Morgan with a series of clotheslines and a suplex, forcing Morgan to try and recoup.\n\nOutside the ring, the emotional beatdown of Morgan began as Ripley and Mysterio taunted Morgan. The challenger continued the physical onslaught, using the the steel steps to her advantage as the referee counted to eight.\n\nAs Ripley went for her Riptide finisher in the center of the ring, Morgan escaped and then tossed Ripley shoulder-first into the ring post. Ripley sold the shoulder injury, the same one that forced her to relinquish her championship earlier in the year, saying \"it's out.\" Morgan capitalized, focusing on the shoulder and went for the match's first near-fall.\n\nThe fans bought in as Morgan maintained momentum, with dueling \"Let's go Rhea\" and \"Let's go Liv\" chants broke out. As Ripley moved outside the ring and pleaded with Mysterio for help, Morgan went for a suicide dive. Mysterio shoved Ripley out of the way and took the brunt of it. Ripley then purposely went shoulder-first into the announce table to pop it back into its socket, turning the tide.\n\nAfter a dropkick and near-fall, Ripley again had Riptide countered, this time into a DDT and Morgan nearly won the match. Ripley yanked Morgan down from the second rope and put the champion into her signature submission hold. Morgan escaped this hold and then suddenly landed a crucifix driver and attempted to lock in an armbar in the center of the ring.\n\nRipley powered out of the armbar and slammed Morgan down for another near-fall, drawing overwhelming \"Mami\" chants from the crowd. As Ripley taunted, Morgan landed a headbutt and escaped the ring to get a steel chair. As Morgan attacked, Ripley kicked her in the stomach and landed Riptide. Rather than going for the pin, Ripley took the chair and went to hit Morgan. As she raised the weapon, Mysterio yanked the chair from her hands.\n\nWith Mysterio and Ripley arguing, Morgan landed a drop kick and Oblivion finisher. Ripley managed to kick out at two. Mysterio tossed the chair back in the ring, distracted the referee and allowed Morgan to hit Oblivion on Ripley onto the steel chair and score the pinfall.\n\nLiv Morgan defeats Rhea Ripley in 15:51 to retain her Women's World Championship.\n\nAfter the match, Mysterio helped up Morgan and kissed her in front of Ripley, putting an end to any speculation as to what side he was on.\n\nUndisputed WWE Championship — Cody Rhodes (c.) vs. Solo Sikoa in a \"Bloodline Rules\" match — The deck is stacked against Rhodes, more than in any other match during his championship reign. There were several references to Roman Reigns on Friday’s episode of SmackDown, and making this match “Bloodline Rules” is just begging for a return of the Tribal Chief. This match will be hard-pressed to live up to the WrestleMania 40 main event — fought under the same stipulations — but should be a great finish to the show, with a potentially massive return helping Rhodes retain. Prediction: Cody Rhodes retains the Undisputed WWE Championship\n\nWorld Heavyweight Championship — Damian Priest (c.) vs. Gunther — Priest has had a solid reign, but it’s clear that Gunther has been prepped to take his spot at the top of WWE by winning Raw’s biggest singles championship. This match has the potential to steal the show, with two relatively different styles clashing in the ring. Gunther’s hard-hitting style and Priest’s more uptempo pace should make for a match of the year contender, but the title will change hands. Prediction: Gunther wins the World Heavyweight Championship\n\nWWE Women's Championship — Bayley (c.) vs. Nia Jax — The big question mark here is if Tiffany Stratton will cash in her new, custom Money in the Bank briefcase. If so, she’s walking out of Cleveland as the WWE Women’s Champion. Otherwise, I think Bayley will retain and potentially set up a showdown with a soon-to-return Charlotte Flair in the near future. Prediction: Bayley retains the WWE Women’s Championship\n\nWomen's World Championship — Liv Morgan (c.) vs. Rhea Ripley — Outside of the Rhodes-Sikoa match, no contest on the SummerSlam card has a more emotionally driven story than Morgan vs. Ripley. Morgan won’t win clean here, but she could unexpectedly retain by a double-cross from Dominik Mysterio, adding even more heat to their characters and protecting Ripley in the process. On the flip side, Ripley could win and set up the next chapter of this storyline by attempting to beat down Morgan and Mysterio stopping her. Either way, it doesn’t seem like we’re done here. Prediction: Morgan retains the Women’s World Championship.\n\nIntercontinental Championship — Sami Zayn (c.) vs. Bron Breakker — We saw this match last month at Money in the Bank, where Zayn was victorious. Although this is the first time he’s been featured in a singles match at SummerSlam, I do think Zayn drops the belt to Breakker, who is very clearly on the upswing in WWE and has a very bright future. Plus, depending on the outcome of the Preist-Gunther match, we could see Zayn lose and have an almost immediate claim to face a newly crowned Gunther. Win-win. Prediction: Bron Breakker wins the Intercontinental Championship.\n\nUnited States Championship — Logan Paul (c.) vs. LA Knight — I expect a solid showing from Paul and Knight. It’s been a long run for Knight without a championship in WWE, so rather than overthinking things, I’ll venture that ends tonight. Prediction: LA Knight wins the United States Championship.\n\nDrew McIntyre vs. CM Punk, with Seth Rollins as special guest referee — Rollins will undoubtedly get involved here, and it’ll likely cost Punk a win over McIntyre. A win for McIntyre keeps him in the mix for the World Heavyweight Championship while we can get a brief Rollins-Punk feud (with some real-life beef included) before either makes a run to the top of the card. Prediction: Drew McIntyre wins."
