Summerslam 1993 was the ninth Summerslam event produced by World Wrestling Federation which took place on 22nd August 1993

Background[]

The main match heading into Summerslam is WWF Champion Bret Hart defending against Ric Flair. At Wrestlemania 8, Bret Hart, Lex Luger and Shawn Michaels interrupted Koko's winning celebration and took down every man in the main event, they pointed to the stage as WCW Heaviweight champion Ric Flair debuted and they formed the Four Horsemen. A year later, Ric Flair was WWF Champion and at Royal Rumble 1993 Bret Hart and Lex Luger became co-winners of the Royal Rumble match, a compromise was made as Luger would face Flair for the WWF Championship in the opening match and the winner of that would have to defend the title in the main event against Bret Hart. Lex Luger defeated Flair but right after, Shawn Michaels cashed in his MITB contract and defeated Luger to win the title, in the main event Bret defeated Shawn to become champion as all members of 4HM held the title at least once. Since then, Bret defeated Luger in a rematch and Shawn as well, the only one that didn't have his rematch was Ric Flair who challenged him for this big dream match as Flair wants to prove why exactly he's the leader, there's been a civil war brewing within the group as Shawn and Flair are acting as bad guys while Bret and Luger are starting to be on the babyface side

On the Smackdown side, Undertaker will defend the world heaviweight championship against Jake Roberts. Their story dates all the way back to 1990 when they faced off in a New Generation vs Old Generation tag match which the Old Generation won with Roberts eliminating Taker, Taker started targeting Roberts and defeated him at Wrestlemania 7, at Survivor Series 1991 the feud restarted as Roberts chairshotted Taker in the back after a lost match, at Royal Rumble 1992 Taker defeated Roberts and Roberts decided to bow down to him and join him, at Wrestlemania 8 it was all a trick as Roberts turned on Taker and tried to make him lose to LOD in a tag match but Taker chokeslammed him and still beat LOD. On the Smackdown after Wrestlemania 9, Roberts returned and said that the only reason why he was back was to take down contendership and defeat Taker for the world title, Savage, Sid and Roberts feuded in the main event scene and had a triple threat match in an episode of Smackdown which Roberts won to get this match tonight

Rick Martel was traded to RAW as the main draft pick after Wrestlemania 9 but he has yet to do anything of relevant, european champion Owen Hart who had just completed a year of being champion said there were no worthy challengers of him at RAW, Martel came out for a KOTR qualifying match but Owen superkicked him and made him lose the match, Martel ended up winning a "last chance" triple threat to enter KOTR and defeated Yokozuna to win it, Owen has helped Martel against Million Dollar Corporation but he also attacks him at any chance he gets

Jeff Jarrett stepped up as Ramon's challenger for the IC Championship but Bobby Heenan put Jarrett against his partner Jerry Lawler in a NO1 Contendership match, Jarrett got the win but it clearly grew some animosity between the 2, at In Your House 8 Ramon defeated Jarrett after Lawler and Jarrett argued for a bit, Ramon said he was finding this hilarious so he challenged both men to a triple threat match tonight

After Wrestlemania, Jim Cornette led an SMW invasion on RAW with the debuting Rock N Roll Express and Heavenly Bodies, Rock N Roll Express ended up winning the RAW tag titles and feuded against Heavenly Bodies as Jim Cornette chose to manage them instead of RNRE, at In Your House 6 Diesel interrupted their tag match to beat all 4 men up, they had another match but this time it was Headshrinkers who attacked them and turned heel in the process, Diesel kept interrupting their matches, Harley Race announced a threeway ladder match for the tag titles RNRE vs Heavenly Bodies vs Headshrinkers, Diesel and Shawn Michaels weren't happy about that so they defeated RNRE to make the match a fatal 4 way

During Doink's intial takeover of Smackdown as he destroyed the lower midcard division, he kidnapped Yokozuna, when Yokozuna returned he had his memory completely erased and was back to his mid 1991 gimmick when he debuted, Doink's takeover led to him winning the tag team titles with Barry Horowitz against Steiner Brothers, Yokozuna started teaming up with Duane Gill as a comedy team but everytime Doink showed up, Yokozuna froze and couldn't move and Duane kept being attacked due to that. At In Your House 8, Duane and Yokozuna won a fatal 4 way to become NO1 contenders, Doink has interrupted every Yoko match since then but everytime Yoko manages to walk at least one step as his brainwashing is ending, tonight will be the ultimate test for Yokozuna

Empire consisted of Randy Savage, Sycho Sid and Steiner Brothers, they were traded to Smackdown after Survivor Series 1992 and completely dominated the brand winning all of the titles with Randy Savage becoming World Heaviweight Champion. At Wrestlemania 9, Savage was defeated by The Undertaker and turned face as he reunited with Miss Elizabeth, Savage thanked Sid for all the help but now he wanted to end his career just chilling with Elizabeth, Sid was pissed and sent Roberts to attack Savage, these 3 have been in the main event scene since then all feuding amongst each other, Roberts ended up managing to get the world title contendership so Sid and Savage will face off, Sid has a bit of an advantage as a snake bit Savage recently so his arm is weak, stakes were added as Bobby Heenan announced that only the winner would enter the G1

Mr.Perfect announced he would be in the G1 but Lex Luger said that wasn't fair and Perfect isn't better than anyone for having retired Hogan, anyone could have retired Hogan in the state he was in. Harley Race decided to have a match between both men with the winner entering the G1
