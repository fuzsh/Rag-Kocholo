        "text": "Welcome to the Real Roaring 20’s!\n\nGrowing up, I saw and was involved in, many musicals about the 1920’s - NO, NO NANETTE, THE BOYFRIEND, THOROUGHLY MODERN MILLIE - and they all painted a picture of a squeaky clean, bygone era of Flappers and marrying the boy next door.\n\nThen, in the year 2000, Andrew Lippa brought down the Musical Theatre World with his Jazz Age, Tell-it-like-it-really-was, Off-Broadway musical THE WILD PARTY, based on the 1928 90-page poem of the same name by Joseph Moncure March. The poem was written in verse about Burrs (an abusive Vaudeville Clown) and his lover, Queenie, a Vaudeville Dancer and their eclectic group of friends (each of whom is written about in great detail) who come to their party. The poem was composed to loosely depict and satirize the infamous Roscoe “Fatty” Arbuckle Rape/Murder Case of Virginia Rappe. It paints a picture of a very different 1920’s than most Americans had ever had access to: one of Prohibition, Excessive Drug Use, Sexual Revolution and Violence. After the 1928 release of the poem, it was quickly banned...but it has endured for almost 100 years and is revered as a great and daring work of historical fiction.\n\nIn 2016, I played Mae in a Production of THE WILD PARTY at The Complex in Hollywood and our Assistant Director was Raymond Jaramillo McLeod, who originated Eddie in the Off-Broadway Production. I was so fortunate to work with him - he gave great insight into how the show had been developed. When I came in to present my Director Pitch, I was able to give so much backstory about the show (conception and workshop) and was honored to have been chosen to direct it. We saw 80 actors at auditions for this show and were so fortunate to be able to cast these extremely talented triple threats. We also have a full team of “Wonderstudies” who get to play the roles they cover Sept 30-Oct 2.. I was thrilled to be able to offer them an entire weekend for learning all of this material.\n\nTHE WILD PARTY is a departure from the Morgan-Wixson’s usual fare of more family friendly entertainment and I’m ecstatic about the gusto in which the Creative Staff and Cast have embraced this work of art. New to this theatre, we brought in an Intimacy Director, Emilia Ray, to give specific direction and expertise to our intimate scenes - this set a level of professionalism and comfort for our cast. We also brought in a Stage Combat Director, Amanda Newman, to make sure our cast had precise fight direction. I’m entirely grateful for our immediate team Michael M., Daniel Koh, Michael Mullen, Ryan Rowles, Spencer, Bill, Emily, Miriam, Sam, Melanie, Regina, Ethan, Cody and the entire team at the Morgan-Wixson.\n\nWhat you are seeing tonight are almost entirely the 2020 cast of THE WILD PARTY who almost opened in 2020 and were shut down for 2.5 years. There is so much gratitude on the stage and on our team, that we FINALLY get to do this show.\n\nNow, I ask you to view our show with an open mind and heart - it is not so much a tale of Jazz Age booze, sex, drugs and promescuity as it is a tale of cause and effect, consequences and finally, redemption. Enjoy and thank you for coming to live, local theatre in Los Angeles.\n\nIn July 2015 Matt Weinstock of Playbill interviewed Andrew Lippa. From TWP’s origin story to why he wrote the character Mae as he did to how TWP is what Stephen Sondheim would call a “baby picture”....here are some excerpts of that conversation:\n\nWHERE DID THE NOTION OF WRITING A MUSICAL BASED ON “THE WILD PARTY” COME FROM?\n\nIn 1995 my first musical, John & Jen, was running in New York City, and I was looking for something else to write. I was in a Barnes & Noble and thought, \"I'm going to maybe set some poetry to music.\" In those days, I didn't write lyrics. I looked through the poetry section, and sitting on a shelf was a skinny little volume with a wonderful cover called \"The Wild Party.\" I cracked it open and the inside of the book had a red fuzzy liner, sort of like \"Pat the Bunny.\" I was already intrigued. Then I turned to the next page and saw these gorgeous drawings by Art Spiegelman, and saw the poem start: Queenie was a blonde, and her age stood still, And she danced twice a day in vaudeville.\n\nThere was something about the beginning of that poem, the description of that woman, that spoke to me personally. I didn't clearly know it at the time. I just knew that I was more excited about something than I'd ever been in my life. I thought, \"I want to make this into a musical.\" And I thought, \"I can,\" because I was gonna do it like Cats; I was going to set the poem to music. I found out later that that wasn't going to work.\n\nWHY NOT?\n\nThe poem was almost exclusively third-person narrative, and I got weary of writing in the third person. I wanted to write \"I feel…,\" \"I am...\". I hardly knew anyone in the theatre in those days, so necessity was the mother of invention. It was like the movie \"Cast Away.\" I had a coconut and a palm frond and I was gonna make a television out of it, you know? The lyrics to \"Poor Child\" were among the first lyrics that I wrote. I played them for a friend of mine, the Broadway producer Jeffrey Seller, who later went on to be one of the co-producers of the show with Kevin McCollum and the Manhattan Theatre Club. Jeffrey said, \"Well, who wrote the lyrics?\" I said, \"I did.\" He said, \"Why don't you keep going?\" That was enough encouragement.\n\nWHAT WERE THOSE FIRST LYRICS?\n\nIt's a part that's not on the record, when Kate sings:\n\nHere we go\n\nTake the bait\n\nBlack and Queenie integrate\n\nWatch her fall for him\n\nCall for him\n\nShe'll wager it all for him\n\nAnd when the trap is set\n\nI'll be there\n\nTo catch Burrs\n\nHe thinks he's hers\n\nBut he's in for some news\n\nLight the fuse and place the bets\n\nAnd then Black sings, \"Poor child, poor child.\" It was actually in the poem; there's a moment where he says something about how she was a \"poor child.\" And it struck me as something that was coming directly from a character, singing about how they felt in that moment about what they intended to do afterwards. The other notion behind the song was a musical one; it's based on a quartet from Rigoletto. Sort of an odd mash-up — Rigoletto and the Roaring Twenties.\n\nTHE 1997 WORKSHOP OF THE WILD PARTY WAS AT THE EUGENE O’NEILL THEATER CENTER. KRISTIN CHENOWETH WAS IN THE CAST, RIGHT?\n\nYes. I don't know how it is today, but in those days you didn't have auditions at the O'Neill; you just got together with the casting director and looked at lists and tried to just get people you knew. Kristin had been recommended to me by an actor friend, and I didn't know anything about her, so I said, \"Is she funny?\" My friend said, \"Oh, yeah, she's really funny.\" I said, \"Well, if you think she's funny and she can sing, I guess that's fine.\" (laughs) It became a very long love affair. To this day we're still making songs, which I just love. She did this Disney movie called \"The Descendants\" that premieres July 31, and I wrote her big number.\n\nWHO DID SHE PLAY IN THE WILD PARTY?\n\nShe was Mae. I wrote \"Two of a Kind\" for her. The song really exists because Kristin did that workshop and I realized, \"Oh, this character needs something to do.\" The song is all about her being really short and the guy being really tall — because that's what it was that week. (laughs) I didn't have the notion that the character was going to be tiny. But because Kristi did it, that's what stuck.\n\nDO YOU HAVE MEMORIES OF WORKING WITH STEVEN PASQUALE ON THE ORIGINAL OFF-BROADWAY PRODUCTION?\n\nWell, Steven was Brian d'Arcy James' understudy. Steven was very, very young when we did the show, and I think that he auditioned for the role of Burrs and was great, but was way too young to play the role. And now, years later, Steven gets to play the part. It's very exciting.\n\nSONDHEIM CALLS HIS EARLY SHOWS “BABY PICTURES.” IS THERE ANYTHING ABOUT THE WILD PARTY THAT REALLY FEELS LIKE PART OF YOUR PAST?\n\nThere is a vestigial Andrew who dates back to fifth grade who wants very much to be chosen for the thing — whatever we were asked to raise our hands for — and wants to be approved of, and wants to feel he belongs. That feeling got transplanted, or dragged, into The Wild Party. It is a part of me that I have since worked to — not extinguish, but to feed in other ways. Now I'm a calmer and happier person, and I can let my art be my art. My art doesn't have to speak on my behalf or solve any problems for me. So in approaching The Wild Party, I'm much, much happier to contemplate making changes.\n\nIS THERE ANYTHING ABOUT THE SHOW THAT YOU REFUSED TO TOUCH? (For the 2015 revival).\n\nI remember that Stephen Schwartz — another friend and mentor — saw a developmental version of the show around 1998. I asked him for his thoughts on the show and he said, \"I have two notes that are really not gonna be helpful.\" I was like, \"Okay, what? He's gonna be like, Get out of show business and lose thirty pounds.\" But he said, \"The song ‘Life of the Party' — I don't know what you're thinking about, whether it wants to stay where it is in the show, or who's going to sing it, but you can't cut that song. I know we talk all the time about how everything's on the chopping block, but you can't cut that song. That little vamp on the left hand — that's worth a lot of money.\" What he meant by that was not literally a lot of money; he meant there was something about it that was captivating and unique and sucked you into the world of the play.\""
