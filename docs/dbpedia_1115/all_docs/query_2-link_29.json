(Sorry, this is clickbait... but you still want to know, right?) Plus the answer is surprisingly funny! And you'll learn 5 lessons for film editors from Michael's new class, Telling a Great Story, on MasterClass Click here! https://lnkd.in/gS3rRrXr\n\nHow Alfred Hitchcock Manipulates His Audience ‚Äì My takeaways from the video essay by ‚ÄúThe Discarded Image‚Äù. Hitchcock introduced elements or characters that seemed significant but were ultimately distractions from the true plot twists and revelations. In ‚ÄúPsycho‚Äù he introduced several secondary characters ‚Äì For instance: Marion‚Äôs sister Lila Loomi and a private investigator. This helped to keep the viewers on edge, allowing them to play the mental guessing game constantly. Changing POVs: Throughout the movie: Hitchcock gives us a glimpse of what situations would look like from a different perspective. This technique allowed viewers to experience events from the character's viewpoint, intensifying their emotional connection and making them more empathetic to the characters' plight. In Psycho, the POV shifts between Marion and Norman, and hence the empathy meter keeps shifting between the two. Shocking Scenes: Before the Shower Scene in Psycho, no one ever knew what it was to see a woman‚Äôs naked body on screen. Hitchcock‚Äôs juxtaposition of a female bathing scene with a brutal murder scene shook the American audience. He made the most unusual connections of that time ‚Äì from having a mother, to sex and murder. Composition: Once Hitchcock introduced a new composition, he didn‚Äôt get back to the older one. In Psycho, The dialogue between Marion and Norman is a masterpiece on who controls the narrative, their respective bodies moving forward to establish dominance, or Norman filling up the same frame when Marion is shown moving out of the room. #movies #films #fiction #storytelling"
