        "text": "Although we have no hard evidence (and an even less solid desire to go looking for it), many of us in the Canadian cultural snake pit are fairly certain that Don McKellar has a glittering, golden horseshoe wedged deep inside a delicate part of his lower anatomy. The guy just can't, or won't, lose. Maybe we should let him handle the Afghanistan campaign.\n\nEven a gentle skim over McKellar's long résumé is enough to induce full-rage jealousy. Award-winning actor, award-winning director, award-winning screenwriter, award-winning cartoon voice-over artist (enough already!), he's the Kim Jong-il of Canadian culture: always present, always on view, always smiling and waving for the camera, but without the weird pantsuits. As we speak, someone at Toronto City Hall is probably wondering where best to put Don McKellar Avenue.\n\nIf all of the above is news to you, you must spend your cultural leisure time watching nothing but golf channels. McKellar has been starring in and co-creating theatre, films and television, here and abroad, since the early 1980s. A partial list includes Highway 61, Thirty Two Short Films About Glenn Gould, The Red Violin, Last Night, Twitch City, Odd Job Jack, Slings and Arrows, Monkey Warfare and a bustling little diversion called The Drowsy Chaperone, for which he won a Tony.\n\nMcKellar's latest project is the big-screen adaptation of Nobel winner Jose Saramago's bestseller Blindness. McKellar wrote the screenplay and, typically overachieving, he also plays the unrepentant thief who kick-starts the whole movie (alongside top-drawer talents Julianne Moore, Mark Ruffalo and Danny Glover).\n\nIf the Academy hands Don McKellar an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay this February, can we finally just kick him out of the country? Winning and winning again is so very un-Canadian.\n\nRemember when you were a young and starving theatre\n\nartist ...\n\nYeah, um, not so long ago, I like to think.\n\nAnd now you're richer than\n\nMadonna. Do you have artist survivor guilt?\n\nNo, not really. The thing about my career is that it's been very, very gradual. One thing has led to the next and I've always exceeded my expectations. So, it's not like I feel like I had a sudden windfall. You know what I mean? I've been able to survive on my work for quite a while, but I guess I never felt like I was selling out, because that opportunity never really came up.\n\nYet. Were you not hand-picked by Mr. Saramago to make this film?\n\nWell, in the sense that he'd turned down a lot of other people, and then he accepted our offer.\n\nWhat, he was watching Twitch City on Portuguese television?\n\nYes! He's a huge Twitch City fan! No, no, we sent him stuff. It's not like he stumbled across me somewhere. He saw Last Night, and, I think, The Red Violin - everything we thought might appeal to him. And, you know, we constantly badgered him with phone calls. Then we got a phone call saying he'd meet us on just one of two possible days. By that point, he'd already refused us, but we went over and, uh, charmed him.\n\nJose Saramago's books are\n\nnotoriously impenetrable. Where did you start?\n\nWell, you've gotta be able to read it first, get through the impenetrable side. But I don't find his book is that hard. They're at first intimidating, because of the look of the print, the page - there are few paragraphs, no dialogue. But they're much more readable than they appear. And then, I guess, it's like adapting any other book. You have to find the story that you want to tell. In some ways, it wasn't as hard as a lot of books because there's quite a bit of action, so it was easy to find the story.\n\nWere you surprised by the\n\nvitriolic critical response at Cannes?\n\nWe were all surprised because we'd given it to a number of critics before, who all reacted positively. And the screening at Cannes was extremely gratifying - a really warm response, a big long ovation. So we were definitely surprised, but I kind of think they had it in for Fernando too, [Fernando Meirelles, the director of Blindness, as well as City of God and The Constant Gardener]because he's too, um ... [leaves sentence unfinished]\n\nSo you're blaming him?\n\nHa! No, that's not true! But, I didn't think Cannes was going to be just a warm. ... I mean, it's not like they're discovering a new voice.\n\nRumour has it you've altered the film since Cannes.\n\nYes, we have. When you go to Cannes, you sort of rush and hurry just to get it ready in time. I hadn't even seen it before the Cannes screening, the final version. So there were a couple of things we wanted to change anyway, and then when we went to Miramax wanting to do the changes, the critical reaction at Cannes certainly helped us make our case.\n\nDanny Glover is wonderful in the film. I forgot about him after he made those goofy Lethal Weapon movies.\n\nYeah, yeah! He's really good, isn't he? I found that too, that I remembered how good he is. It's not fair, those Lethal Weapon movies have not done him a good service.\n\nDoes it frustrate you that more people will likely see Blindness than your previous films just because it has big U.S. stars?\n\nNot really. I mean, I guess it does frustrate me when I see a great film and I know no one else is going to see it. But the reverse is obviously true too - I see crappy films that everybody sees just because of the stars.\n\nNow seems like the right time for you to move to L.A. and do something scandalous, like step out of a limo with no underwear or smash up a car.\n\nI've been doing that here for years!\n\nIt doesn't count here.\n\nBut I've been doing it every night! No attention! Nothing! Oh, I don't know, I feel it's less and less necessary to move to L.A., with communications the way they are. I don't think it's as important as it used to be, and God knows they're all coming to town this week anyway. It just doesn't seem crucial.\n\n*****\n\nParticulars\n\nBorn\n\nAug. 17, 1963, Toronto Nickname\n\nThe Pharaoh (?) Poking fun\n\nMcKellar has said that Curtis, his character on the TV series Twitch City, is \"a kind of caricature of a perception some people might have of me. It's a joke at my expense. It's the way I feel some days when I'm at home feeling pathetic and full of self-loathing and just sitting in front of the television set eating cereal.\"\n\nA lightning rod\n\nIn light of the recent firestorm over cutbacks to funding for the arts, the message board on McKellar's IMDb.com profile provides an interesting debate about his success as a filmmaker. And then there's the person who just wants to see him shirtless."
