        "text": "Canadian composer and writer\n\nFor the Scottish footballer, see Greg Morrison (footballer).\n\nGreg Morrison is a Canadian composer and writer best known for his work on the Tony Award-winning musical The Drowsy Chaperone, written with songwriting partner, Lisa Lambert. The Drowsy Chaperone was their first collaboration. In 1999 Lambert asked Morrison to work on a musical to perform at the wedding stag party of their friends, Bob Martin and Janet Van De Graaff. Also a part of this original writing team was filmmaker, Don McKellar. That was the first incarnation of The Drowsy Chaperone. This was followed by an expanded production of the show at the Toronto Fringe festival, where Martin joined as a co-writer and performer.\n\nGreg is a graduate of the Humber College Jazz program in Toronto. He began his theatre career as musical director for the touring company of The Second City in Toronto. As well as working for The Second City, Greg composed and performed scores and musical direction for a variety of Toronto artists, most notably, playwright Karen Hines, powerhouse horror clown duo, Mump and Smoot and Canadian theatre icon Linda Griffiths.
