        "text": "In A Far-Away Land...\n\nYou know how most fairytales begin by specifying that either the events of the story or the Prince/Princess live in a “Faraway Land”?\n\nThat’s us. All of us.\n\nWe are all the people in extraordinary circumstances living out strange stories in our own personal faraway lands. (Though I’m not sure if that take makes me feel better or worse about it…)\n\nWhat we have at our disposal however, which the characters of the fairytales sorely lack, is a way to communicate between our faraway lands. A way to peek through small windows into the other peoples’ lives. A way to connect.\n\nIs it as wonderful as being able to ride a steed or step through a portal and be fully immersed in another space?\n\nNo, certainly not.\n\nBut we do have this technology to give us an advantage. An advantage allowing for new and continued connection, friendship, and creation.\n\nToday, I would like to share some of my quarantine connections, and how they’ve worked (or not worked).\n\nRead More\n\nTake Direct Action, Get More Benefits\n\nThere are two things I’ve been hearing a lot during this quarantine. One is a question and the other is more of an uncertain statement:\n\n“I feel lost, unmotivated, unsure what to do.”\n\n“How can I help the struggling people/organizations that I love not go under?”\n\nI must admit - although these are both tinged with the sadness and anxiety of our present moment - I’m heartened by the love and care that has poured out of our communities online. A desire to do something at all is a marker of self-care, and a desire to give is a marker of care for others.\n\nAnd that is beautiful.\n\nBut acknowledging that beauty doesn’t provide an answer to the above queries, both of which are searching for fulfillment.\n\nSo, how can we take some direct action - for ourselves and those around us - that will provide fulfillment? And are there other benefits as well?\n\nHere are some thoughts.\n\nRead More\n\nTighten The Net\n\nNo doubt about it, these are uncertain times.\n\nThe world has been thrown for a loop - one that we had not properly prepared for - and “normal life” as we know it is going to be put on hold for some time.\n\nIs this going to suck?\n\nIn a lot of ways, yes.\n\nIs the mass chaos and fear warranted?\n\nFor us in the US, caution is certainly warranted, but perhaps not the extreme fear (and let’s hope it never gets to that point).\n\nDo we know what’s going to happen moving forward? What that will look like?\n\nNo, not yet.\n\n“So, everything’s terrible and all hope is lost???”\n\nNot at all!\n\nThese precautions and life interruptions are necessary to prevent the wide spread of an illness that could see our entire health system overrun. That’s when the real trouble would start (look to Italy if you’re unsure what I mean).\n\nThis is going to hit a lot of people hard - not the least of which are artists, entrepreneurs, freelancers, small business owners, and all non-salaried/non-insured employees - but we can still support each other.\n\nAs Amanda Palmer says in The Art of Asking: Tighten the net.\n\nRead More\n\nSpeed Dating...for Writers?\n\nSome of you may have seen my post on Instagram or Facebook this past week saying that I attended a Writer-Producer Speed Dating event this past Sunday evening.\n\n(If not, make sure to follow me on FB, and follow me @radimichael and the blog @glamorouslifeblog both on the Instagrams!)\n\nThis event was insane. In a good way. But insane.\n\n11 producers, 11 trailing producers, 22 writers, 2 sessions each over 2 hours, plus a reception. And that was just the night itself, which doesn’t include the week of intensive preparation of the pitch and accompanying materials!\n\nAnd throughout the entire week leading up to it - I was scared out of my mind.\n\nI rarely get myself worked up in anxious anticipation of things, but sometimes I cannot control it, and this was one of those times.\n\n“So what the heck was this thing and why was it so daunting?”\n\nExcellent questions, dear reader.\n\nRead More\n\nDo Something That Scares You\n\n“Today it is Friday -\n\nBut even if it were Tuesday -\n\nDo something that scares you…\n\nRead More\n\nOne Revolution\n\nWe like to parcel our lives into smaller units. We’ve been doing this for thousands of years, and have increased the amount of various units as time has passed.\n\nBut one unit that is consistent throughout most cultures - ancient and modern alike - is the year:\n\nOne revolution around the Sun.\n\nWhether or not we were aware of the Earth’s relationship to the Sun at that point, humans have always seemed to be keenly aware of this pattern of light, life, and season. And it has become engrained in us and our cultures in a multitude of ways: Birthdays, Anniversaries, education, celebrations, remembrances, etc.\n\nThe year has become the easiest and most visible yard stick that we utilize to measure progress - both our own and that of the world around us. And at this time of year you will hear an increased emphasis on the year as a measuring tool, as well as a strong counter-movement against its importance.\n\nBut as we find ourselves back in the same place we were one year ago - not just personally, but as an entire planet - it seems to make sense to look around and evaluate what has changed and, perhaps, what has not.\n\nWhat is different one revolution later?\n\nRead More\n\nWhat Have You Been Doing?\n\nThis is an excellent question, and one I’ve been getting a lot of lately.\n\nAnd why?\n\nPerhaps it’s because I have looked consistently tired over the past several weeks?\n\nPerhaps it’s because I’ve not been very social this past month.\n\nOr perhaps it’s because the rabid fans of my blog are craving the more in-depth content that I have not had the time to deliver much of this fall! (ehn?)\n\nI’m sure all of these are correct, at least to a degree.\n\nBut it’s a good question, nonetheless.\n\nWhat have I been doing? What’s been keeping me so busy?\n\nRead More\n\nBecome A True \"Renaissance [Wo]Man\"\n\nAs I discussed last week, this past weekend was the first ever TudorCon at which myself and a small cast performed a concert of music from The King’s Legacy as the con’s Saturday night entertainment.\n\nSo silly. So fun. And wonderfully affirming!\n\nI met a lovely group of smart, giving, caring individuals who all gathered together to share their love of this time period and its stories. And even more than that, they gathered together to support the research, knowledge, and creations of the speakers and their fellow attendees.\n\nAfter the concert, a small group of people was standing around speaking with some of the performers, and they were asking where they would be able to see the show next.\n\nNow, as you know dear readers, this depends entirely on when and where there is an interest to produce the show, as well as having the money behind it to make it happen. And this was explained to the group.\n\nBut then one of the women said: “You should start a Patreon page! I would definitely give, and I bet many other people would as well!”\n\nAnd what a delightfully canny idea that was!\n\nRead More\n\nIt's TudorCon Time!\n\nYes folks, you heard (read?) that right! TudorCon.\n\nThe world’s first ever TudorCon, in fact.\n\nAnd The King’s Legacy has been booked to provide the Saturday night entertainment at the con’s inaugural year with a concert of music from the show!\n\n“So, what is this thing?”\n\n“What are you doing there?”\n\n“And why should I care?”\n\nI love your propensity for questions, dear reader!\n\nRead More\n\nHold Your Breath. Make A Wish. Count To Three.\n\nYou know how you sometimes have this dream - it could be a nighttime thing, or a daydream, or some lofty ethereal goal - but it’s something you just can’t quite imagine. It’s there and you can almost picture it, but only ever just almost.\n\nI’ve had so many of these dreams that I lost count long ago. But I think it’s something that’s just in the DNA of artists and creative types.\n\nRight?\n\nWell, beginning sometime around the fall of 2016 I had this dream (the goal kind) of what it would be like, feel like, look like, sound like, etc to see The King’s Legacy - which had finally found the correct structure - come to life in a full production.\n\nIt simultaneously felt easily attainable and yet a thousand years off. I truly could almost see it happening. But it wasn’t happening - not yet anyway. So all I could do was just keep imagining and letting various scenarios pass through my head.\n\nBut I will tell you that, when it came down to the reality, it was nothing like I had imagined.\n\nIt was so much better.\n\nRead More\n\n6 Years Later...\n\nOctober 26th, 2012 - I completed the very first outline for the first version of The King’s Legacy.\n\nDecember 6th, 2012 - There existed a first draft of a script, including a large portion of lyrics.\n\nMarch 14th, 2013 - I had a fully realized first draft with all scenes, music, and lyrics completed.\n\nAnd so it all began.\n\nIt’s been a long long road to the first ever full production of The King’s Legacy, and what a strange, magical, frustrating, and fantastical journey it has been. It’s had its peaks and valleys, but it has brought us to where we are now: Less than one day away from the first rehearsal for the premiere production. (!!!)\n\nSo how did it all start? Where did the show come from? And how did it get to where it is today?\n\nAs per usual, I’m thrilled you asked!\n\nRead More\n\n*And* I Have To...What?\n\nWe often ask a lot of our performers - and directors, designers, and everyone else of course as well, but this post is performer-focused.\n\nWe especially ask a lot of our performers in a summer stock rehearsal setting.\n\nBut sometimes we ask for even a little more.\n\nPerhaps you have a special skill that the director would like to include in a show. For example: you play an instrument, you tumble, you’re a gymnast, you can juggle, you can do impersonations…or a thousand other possible talents.\n\nAnd then there are shows that ask for even more than a little more, and to do it all in 8 days.\n\nAnd that, my friends, is the zany, fast-paced romp that is Murder For Two at Bristol Valley Theater!\n\nRead More\n\nJust The Perfect Blendship\n\nOne of the absolute best parts of the theater that I feel people don’t talk about enough is the people - the community.\n\nSure, every June as we all get ready to sit down together in NYC and across the country to watch the Tony Awards, or are preparing for one of the major benefits like Broadway Bares, or even just during Pride Month in general, theatrical and non-theatrical publications will talk briefly about how Broadway is a community. And it is! It’s a fantastic community with the same pros and cons that any community might have.\n\nBut only “Broadway” is discussed as being the community itself.\n\nAnd as soon as you call something the “Broadway” community, there is an innate elitism to that term - whether geographically or in terms of production budget - which gets thrown into everyone’s minds.\n\nBut what is this Broadway community? Is it just the thousands of people actively working in NYC’s largest theatrical houses? Just those who contribute to the city’s multi-billion dollar industry?\n\nI don’t think so, no.\n\nI think the Broadway community is far larger than that. Personally, I would consider the Broadway community to include anyone and everyone working in theatre across the entire country. I would even consider the Broadway community to include the multitude of theatre lovers - those who don’t necessarily work in the industry, but participate through other means by supporting those who do, or even just attending all productions they can and keeping tabs on what’s happening in the industry.\n\nIn my opinion, it is crucial to consider everyone involved in the theatre everywhere as part of the Broadway community.\n\n“But why?”\n\nAllow me to explain!\n\nRead More\n\nFrom The Ground Up\n\nThe term “Devised Theatre” tends to elicit strong reactions from people - whether that be eyes lighting up in excitement, a shudder in remembrance of the ghosts of devised theatre past, or questioning looks from those who aren’t exactly sure what it means.\n\nEssentially, devised theatre is a theatrical piece including any performance elements (dance, music, lights, speech, sound, movement, etc.) that was built from the ground up by an ensemble of people without a physical, linear-plot script.\n\nOften these types of piece are made to be experimental and off-the-beaten-path, and audiences aren’t necessarily expected to feel a sense of familiarity in experiencing the performance.\n\nBut then, other times that’s exactly what they are meant to feel. And that’s where it gets super tricky.\n\nTonight is the official opening night of So Happy Together: The Music of the Swingin’ 60’s at Bristol Valley Theater - for which I am the Musical Director - and that’s precisely what this show was built to be: a devised musical revue show meant to be a delightful, familiar, and joy-sparking experience for the audience.\n\nAnd folks…I think we did it?!?!\n\nBut how?\n\nRead More\n\nSummertime, And The Livin' Is Easy...\n\nWell, folks. For me, summer has now officially arrived!\n\nHooray!\n\nI am now settled into Naples, NY for a three-show contract that will take most of my summer between June 1st-September 1st! (There will also be a little vacation and a week-long teaching contract thrown in the middle there as well!) And it’s all going to be super fun and not crazy or exhausting at all!\n\n…Right?\n\nWell, not quite. It’s all extremely exciting, but it will be incredibly busy as well!\n\nSo let me tell you a little about the exciting parts while I have your attention! :-D\n\nRead More\n\nThe Rumor, The Legend, The Mystery\n\nMost people - and writers in particular - are drawn to stories about larger-than-life people, figures, and times. Moments and personalities that disrupted the status quo and changed the course of history. The extraordinary.\n\nThese are the stories that live on, passed down through facts and records (contemporary and non), as well as rumor, gossip, and anecdotes that may or may not include a kernel of truth.\n\nThe people at the center of these stories are some of the most compelling, and they have attracted the attention of people throughout generations.\n\nAnd writers love them.\n\nHistorians and creative writers alike love to tackle these gigantic stories filled with change and drama, as well as mystery and intrigue, and put their own spins on them. But what they never tell you is just how difficult these people and stories are to write.\n\nI too have fallen victim to this type of alluring narrative and - despite this post’s title - I am not speaking about the great historical mystery of Anastasia as adapted by Lynn Ahrens and Stephen Flaherty.\n\nI’m talking about one of Western history’s most debated women from one of English history’s most infamous time periods:\n\nAnne Boleyn.\n\nRead More\n\nDon't Bring Around A Cloud...\n\n…to rain on my paraaaaaaaade! (sorry, I couldn’t resist!)\n\nFor those of you who read last week’s blog post - welcome to Part 2! For those of you who didn’t, check out the first part of the post here: As We Stumble Along…\n\nLast week’s post focused on the more negative aspects of the risk-taking and the learning processes in this business. The journey is often imperfect and difficult and involves a great deal of trial-and-error, and that’s totally okay. But what I skipped over were all of the positive steps and outcomes that can result from this journey.\n\nEvery single success or accomplishment that is presently in my life can be traced back to either a risk I took, or a moment where I enhanced my personal education through non-traditional (aka classroom) means. And I am not unique in this regard.\n\nSo, the question becomes - how? Well, there are many routes, but I’ll tell you about some of mine.\n\nRead More\n\nAs We Stumble Along...\n\nThis week I had the pleasure of being part of the first NYC externship for my Alma Mater’s brand new, and now fully developed, Musical Theater Program. I had the chance to work with some lovely SUNY Geneseo Juniors and Seniors in a new musical theatre workshop - an entirely new experience for all of them - and attended the first ever Senior Showcase. The talent was wonderful, the interactions were lovely, and the entire experience got me thinking…a dangerous pastime, I know.\n\nAs a part of the workshop I had to essentially explain to the students who I am, what I do, how that’s relevant to Geneseo, and how I got to where I am. And you know what? That was much more difficult than I expected.\n\nAt this moment in my career, these are the titles that I can, and generally do, give myself:\n\nComposer-Lyricist/Librettist (technically 3 titles?)\n\nPerformer (Musical and non-Musical Theatre)\n\nMusical Director\n\nVocal Coach\n\nAccompanist (I do this less often)\n\nArranger/Orchestrator (though mostly my own material these days)\n\nOne of the Geneseo students said “You do so much!” and I guess that’s true. But I think the better question is, how the heck did I learn to do all of these things?\n\nRead More\n\nThose Who Can...\n\nIt’s an old and cliched phrase at this point, but I do still occasionally hear people say: “Those who can’t do, teach.” Which is really a misquote from George Bernard Shaw’s Maxims For Revolutionists:\n\n“He who can, does; he who cannot, teaches.”\n\nNow, is there any truth to this? Perhaps for some people. Though I would bet that those who go into teaching purely out of disappointment of falling out of their chosen profession aren’t very good teachers, nor are they likely to be teachers for long.\n\nAnd yet this idea persists. Why?\n\nRead More"
