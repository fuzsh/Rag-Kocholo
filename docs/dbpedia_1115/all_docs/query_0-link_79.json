        "text": "I’m excited to welcome you to The Drowsy Chaperone, MSM Musical Theatre’s fourth virtual musical and our third collaboration with the video production team at Super Awesome Friends—Jim Glaub, Scott Lupi and Rebecca Prowler. They, along with our writers, directors, choreographers, designers, musical directors, musicians, stage managers, zoom managers, assistants, editors, production staff, and incredible student crews, have made these virtual performances possible. Following the lead of the theatre industry, we’ve adapted to a new medium and adjusted our creative impulses from stage to screen.\n\nWith the virtual process, MSM MT turned pandemic challenges into positive and valuable learning experiences for our students, introducing them to self-recording techniques and preparing them to engage in a transformed industry.\n\nAll productions have been filmed following all MSM COVID-19 regulations, including physical distancing, room vacancy, and face-covering requirements. Some scenes include multiple students without face coverings who are made to appear together through video editing. Students appearing without face coverings recorded themselves alone in a room, in their homes, and/or in accordance with local safety protocols in their location.\n\nWith its unbridled expression of love for musical theatre, The Drowsy Chaperone is the perfect antidote to a year spent without live performance. We hope you enjoy the show!"
