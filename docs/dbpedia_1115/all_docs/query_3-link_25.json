        "text": "Cal State Fullerton’s 2016-2017 theatrical season opens with the 2003 Pulitzer Prize winning play “Anna in the Tropics,” written by Nilo Cruz and directed by Fidel Gomez.\n\n“Anna in the Tropics,” which runs from Sept. 23 to Oct. 9 in the campus’ Young Theatre, is set in a Cuban-American cigar factory in 1929 Florida, where cigars are rolled by hand while lectors entertain the workers at their monotonous jobs. The arrival of a new lector is a cause for celebration, but when he begins to read aloud from the Russian classic “Anna Karenina,” the scandalous lives of Tolstoy’s characters start to intertwine with those of his listeners, according to a news release.\n\nThe play will be performed at 8 p.m. Sept. 23, 24, 29, 30 and Oct. 1, 6, 7, 8 and at 2 p.m. on Sept. 25 and Oct. 1, 6, 7, 8, 9.\n\nSoon to follow in the CSUF season is “Italian American Reconciliation,” directed by Maria Cominis, from Oct. 7 to 30 in the Hallberg Theatre. Italian American Reconciliation is a tale about Huey, a man who is safely divorced from his shrewish first wife (who shot his dog), but he feels he cannot regain his “manhood” until he woos and wins her one more time, according to a news release from the college. This lighthearted romantic comedy is by John Patrick Shanley, the author of Moonstruck.\n\n“Fall Dance Theatre,” coordinated by Gladys Kares, will be held in the Little Theatre from Oct. 20 to 23 and Oct. 27 to 30.\n\n“Pride and Prejudice,” based on the novel by Jane Austen, has been adapted by Jon Jory and is being directed by Mark Ramont. It is at the Young Theatre in November.\n\n“The Drowsy Chaperone” is coming to the Little Theatre for several dates in November and December, starting Nov. 18. Music and lyrics are by Lisa Lambert and Greg Morrison. Book is by Bob Martin and Don McKellar. Director is Sarah Rippern and choreography is by William F. Lett. Musical direction is under Mitchell Hanlon.\n\nRinging in the spring season is “The Two Gentleman of Verona.” The play by William Shakespeare is being directed by Mark Ramont. It plays in the Hallberg Theatre from Feb. 24 to March 12.\n\n“Tallgrass Gothic” (recommended for adults only) is by Melanie Marnich and directed by James R. Taulli. It will be performed in the Hallberg Theatre from April 8 to 24.\n\n“Andrew Lippa’s Wild Party,” also recommended for adults only, is coming to the Young Theatre from April 21 through May 7.
