        "text": "New York City Center's 'Encores! Off-Center' series, under the artistic direction of Jeanine Tesori, has announced it will return for a third season presenting landmark Off-Broadway musicals.\n\nThe season will begin with William Finn and James Lapine's musical A New Brain, which will be directed by Lapine and star Jonathan Groff. The production will run from 24 to 27 June 2015.\n\nFeaturing music and lyrics by William Finn and book by William Finn and James Lapine, the musical was inspired by Finn's personal experiences. Described as a \"medical tragedy seen through the zany iris of a Looney Tunes short\", the show follows struggling composer Gordon Michael Schwinn as he is diagnosed with a brain tumor and is forced to come to terms with his creative ambitions and the lovable screw-ups in his life: an overbearing boyfriend, a power-belting homeless woman, and a nasty kiddie-show host named Mr. Bungee.\n\nJonathan Groff (Gordon Michael Schwinn) has appeared on Broadway in the original production of 'Spring Awakening' for which he was nominated for a Tony Award. His Off-Broadway credits include 'The Submission' (MCC Theater); 'The Bacchae' (The Public Theater) and The Public Theater revival of 'Hair'. His TV roles include HBO's 'Looking', 'The Normal Heart' and 'Glee'.\n\nThe season will continue with a one night only production of Little Shop of Horrors on 1 July 2015, starring original cast member Ellen Green reprising her role as Audrey, alongside Tracy Nicole Chapman, Marva Hicks, and Ramona Keller.\n\nFeaturing book and lyrics by Howard Ashman and music by Alan Menken, the one-off production will be directed by Dick Scanlan and choreographed by Patricia Wilcox. A popular title around the world, this sci-fi musical follows a hapless florist shop worker who acquires an R&B-singing plant that feeds on human blood.\n\nThe season concludes with Andrew Lippa's The Wild Party which runs from 15 to 18 July 2015.\n\nDirected by Leigh Silverman and choreographed by Sonya Tayeh, this production will star Sutton Foster as Queenie and Joshua Henry as Black.\n\nFeaturing book, music and lyrics by Andrew Lippa, the musical is adapted from the Jazz Age narrative poem by Joseph Moncure March and tells the story of one tragic, decadent night in a Manhattan apartment shared by Queenie and her menacing lover, and the handsome stranger who wants to lure her away.\n\nSutton Foster was most recently seen on Broadway in 'Violet', a role which she originated at the Encores! Off Center series. Other Broadway credits include 'Anything Goes' (Tony Award), 'Shrek', 'Young Frankenstein', 'The Drowsy Chaperone', 'Little Women', 'Thoroughly Modern Millie' (Tony Award), 'Les Mis√©rables', 'Annie', 'The Scarlet Pimpernel' and 'Grease'.\n\nThe 2015 Encores! Off-Center season will feature sets by Donyale Werle, costumes by Clint Ramos, lighting by Mark Barton and sound design by Leon Rothenberg. Chris Fenwick will serve as musical director for all productions.\n\nRegular tickets are on sale now to City Center members only. Tickets will go on sale to the general public on 19 January 2015.\n\nSutton FosterJonathan Groff"
