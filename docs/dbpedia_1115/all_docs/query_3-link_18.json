        "text": "Be Part Of A Sense of Theatre - Or Just Get The Book! 'A Sense of Theatre' is Richard Pilbrow's remarkable history and exploration of the National Theatre - building and company - with which he has been involved since it's inception in 1963. This book has been eight years - or, really, a lifetime - in the making, and is nearly ready for you all to enjoy. Today we are delighted to have our Kickstarter up and running to let you support the book by just buying a copy in advance. Or for just a little more, you can be part of the book, with your name permanently inside on our supporter's page. Or for a bit more, you get your name and a short message inside, alongside the wonderful industry sponsors who are already supporting us. Please do have a look. If you have questions, shout them out. https://lnkd.in/ebQ52DD4 This is quite a story, told by quite a remarkable individual - perhaps the last one standing to have been part of the planning of this amazing building. (If you need any more encouragement, there's a special rate if you get in in the next seven days...)"
