        "text": "by Rachel Brown\n\nIowa City – On a cold, rainy April evening I was grateful to be ushered into such the warm and inviting environment that is Riverside Theatre. I’m a bit ashamed to say that in the nearly 4 years I’ve been in Iowa City, this is the first time I have had the opportunity to attend a show at Riverside. Not for lack of wanting, mind you. It just always happened that I was either involved in another show or I heard about things too late. Attending the first weekend of Working Group Theatre’s Under Construction was a great introduction to the well known and well attended Riverside Theatre.\n\nThis first weekend of Under Construction was a showcase of four local individuals each with a different style and a unique story to tell. It was mixture of serious reflection and comedy punctuated by intervals of old-timey folk music provided by the evening’s house band, Mutiny in the Parlor. It was much like how I imagine a ’50s beatnik coffee house, minus the berets and cigarette smoke.\n\nApproximately 30 seats were set up cabaret style on a section of the Riverside Theatre stage. I’ll be honest when I say I had no idea what to expect. This was certainly not a traditional show. I love these types of happenings, though, with the excitement of experiencing something new and unfamiliar.\n\nEach presenter’ own style was unique and entertaining.\n\nJohn Kaufman was the first of four performers to take the stage. He did something I have never seen a performer do before and that was ask the audience to turn their cellphones on. In an age of technology it was fun to see a performer not only embrace and understand the umbilical tie we have to our mobile devices but incorporate it into a section his performance piece. Bravely posting his own cellphone number on the wall he asked audience members to forward him the most recent text they had received. He then incorporated them into an improved song. Kaufman showcased his storytelling ability with a short monologue about the first time he visited a bathhouse in Osaka, Japan with his brother and the terror (and humor) of scrotal discomfort.\n\nAfter a short break and another song from the house band, Jennifer Fawcett began her series of stories about growing up in Canada, summers riding her bike thought the back roads and her trip to Tanzania working with a small group of theatre artists teaching Tanzanian children by putting together a play in 2 weeks. Her expression and emotion drew me instantly into her memory and I found myself lost in the visions of a dirt country road or a vast green paradise. It was nice to take this little mental vacation into her world.\n\nIdris Goodwin’s rhythm and flow of hip-hop poetry was breath-taking. Each line and syllable moved forward in in a way that makes me jealous of his verbal grace. The series of five short poems he presented were influenced by his work with a group of students in Albuquerque, New Mexico. He spoke of students, a tenacious preteen and a 17 year old with a distaste for the pressure she felt from the sky. He mused about his family’s question “Are there any black people in New Mexico?” (to which the answer is, yes, but not many,) and painted a verbal portrait of a hip-hop city. It was musical verse and heart wrenching lines delivered with a style that made me want to dance.\n\nLastly Martin Andrews took the stage and with again a different style began to weave the tale of his confrontation with the idea of becoming a father. He worried out loud about what kind of father he would become and whether he would follow in the footsteps of the men in his past. This humorous and enchantingly emotional piece was felt soul-deep. The feelings of worry, confusion, angst and pure undiluted joy were painted in his words and actions. It was a truly exquisite piece to end the evening.\n\nWhile these performances had just a short two day run last weekend, Working Group Theatre will continue its presentation of Under Construction tonight through Sunday at Riverside Theatre with two nationally recognized performers: Leslie Ishii (Desperate Housewives and Lost) and Sean Christopher Lewis. Information about these performers and Working Group Theatre can be found online at http://www.workinggrouptheatre.org.\n\nIowa City – We asked Jen Gerbyshak, Publicity Writer for ICCT, to tell us about their next production, The Drowsy Chaperone by Bob Martin and Don McKellar. If the show is half as entertaining as Jen’s description, we’re in for a real treat. Take it away, Jen…\n\n“The Drowsy Chaperone? I’ve never heard of that—what’s it about?”\n\nWithout fail, every time I’ve mentioned my upcoming play to one of my coworkers, church family, or fellow volunteers, that’s the response I’ve gotten. They know me—know I’m an entertaining sort of person—so they ask it with some interest, trusting that I’m going to invite them to an evening of true entertainment. But the first response is always, “I’ve never heard of it.” So I’ve come up with the perfect reply:\n\nThe Drowsy Chaperone is the funniest show you’ve never heard of.\n\nAnd that is a pure fact. First produced in Toronto in 1998, this show was carefully constructed by writers Bob Martin and Don McKellar to keep the audience laughing as hard as possible for as long as possible without actually passing out from asphyxiation. It runs only about an hour and fifteen minutes, but in that time, there are more quips, sight-gags, satirical jibes, puns and parody than you can shake a shtick at.\n\nThe performance begins with a man making dinner. We never do find out what his name is; his official designation in the script is Man in Chair. He wanders about the set, his apartment, and finally settles down in a seat in the audience and delivers the first line that will set the tone for the entire show: “I hate theater.”\n\nMan in Chair is increasingly and delectably neurotic throughout the show as he ushers the audience through a recording of his favorite musical, The Drowsy Chaperone, which is a spoof of all the Broadway classics. Like bonus commentary on a DVD, Man in Chair gives us insider information on the ‘actors’, ‘production’ and ‘plot’ (and I do use the term loosely) of The Drowsy Chaperone, and as he does so, the action comes to life right there in his living room.\n\nEverything you could hope for from a parody of Broadway’s Golden Age is there: highly unlikely romance, random song-and-dance numbers, mile-wide plot holes, straw-man antagonists, sweeping stereotypes, and impossibly convenient resolutions. But there’s more. Subtitled ‘a musical-within-a-play’, Drowsy is actually a parody-within-a-satire, with layers of comedy so brilliantly written that you’ll want to come back, and bring a friend.\n\nBut for all its wry, self-deprecating humor, this show is really about love. Not the fairy-tale, flash-in-the-pan passion of story and song, but the love of old companions who have seen us through our bluest moments. It’s picking up The Hobbit on a cold winter’s night. It’s putting on that Beatles CD for the five thousandth time because you had a fight with your boyfriend. A pure, simple affection which never disappoints because its object remains—or has always been—in your imagination.\n\nDrowsy’s young cast does not disappoint, either. Far from being intimidated by the technical challenges that the production poses, they execute their demanding roles with the kind of verve that legendary farce is made of. They play off each other like a game of racquetball, they dance with gusto, and they have pipes. The sheer sound the ensemble creates during some of the full-chorus numbers is nothing short of jaw-dropping. And they need every ounce of energy to execute the blocking and choreography put together by director Ben Bentler and choreographer Jill Beardsley, the pair who engineered ICCT’s astonishing production of Wonderful Town last spring. Bentler and Beardsley are masters of spectacle, and the zaniness of The Drowsy Chaperone is a perfect vehicle for their combined artistic vision.\n\nAnd an infinitely entertaining evening out. Man in Chair sums it up best this way: “Musicals are supposed to be fun, and that’s what this show is: fun.” Don’t miss out on it!\n\nThe show runs April 29th-May 1st and May 6th-8th. Friday and Saturday night performances will start at 7:30, Sunday matinees at 2:00. For tickets, visit West Music in Coralville or the Robert A. Lee Recreation Center in downtown Iowa City, or purchase your tickets online.\n\nIowa City – Working Group Theatre has two events coming this month. First up is Make it Better, Iowa on April 17th at 4pm at Hotel Vetro. Admission is free.\n\nWorking Group Theatre, supported by the University of Iowa Center for Human Rights, Prairie Lights Bookstore, Iowa Pride Network, and Hotel Vetro, presents Make it Better, Iowa, an evening of storytelling, music, and theatre to raise awareness of the issues facing LGBT youth in Iowa and encourage others to play a role in creating a better Iowa for all citizens. The event is linked with the release of Dan Savage’s book “It Gets Better” and Mr. Savage will appear via skype. This will be the culmination of a two-month project that included workshops for those teacher, advisors, and advocates who are working with Iowa’s LGBT youth. For more information go here.\n\nTheir second event begins April 22 and continues the following weekend. The Under Construction Solo Festival will be presented April 22, 23, 28, 29 and 30 at 7:30 and May 1 at 2 pm at Riverside Theatre. Admission is $12 for students, and $15 for adults. Working Group Theatre will feature seven performers in its first ever solo-show festival. Each weekend will have different offerings.\n\nThe first weekend will feature Solo Shorts – five short pieces from a diverse group of performers.\n\n* Idris Goodwin (award-winning performer, playwright, author of These are the Breaks)\n\n* Austin Bunn (Pushcart Prize winning author, playwright)\n\n* John Kaufmann (author/performer of Starball, Johnny Lingers),\n\n* Martin Andrews (Actor: All My Sons, Mary’s Wedding, Midsummer Nights Dream)\n\n* Jennifer Fawcett (author/performer of Goat Show, playwright of Atlas of Mud).\n\nThe second week will feature two nationally-recognized performers.\n\n* Sean Christopher Lewis (Smith Prize winner, author/performer of Killadelphia), will perform his new solo show Just Kids which describes how his work helping troubled kids at a Kansas school forced him to deal with his own past.\n\n* The second performer, Leslie Ishii, might be familiar to an audience from her recurring role on Lost as Laura Change, or her work on numerous other TV shows. She is an accomplished stage actress who will premiere her one-person show I Have a Spine which describes her search into her own family history in the post-internment camps.\n\nFor more information, go here.\n\nby Andrew Juhl\n\nCoralville – Noël Coward’s semi-autobiographical sub-farce Present Laughter is a tricky piece. One of the great things about all-out farces and jokey-joke comedies is that even novice casts can stage them and get an adequate number of laughs from the audience. Present Laughter requires a defter, more subtle delivery from all its players in order to achieve the same level of applause.\n\nThere were definitely some good performances on opening night, but unfortunately the show overall fell somewhat short of its potential.\n\nThe plot follows a few days in the life of the successful and self-obsessed light comedy actor Garry Essendine as he prepares to travel for a touring commitment in Africa. He finds himself dealing with women who want to seduce him, placating both his long-suffering secretary and his estranged wife, being stalked by a crazed young playwright, and working through his own obsession with oncoming middle age.\n\nDavid Q. Combs, starring as “Garry Essendine” (a role written by Coward unabashedly for Coward), turns in the best-understood performance of the ensemble—which is to be expected, as he is the lone professional actor in the cast.\n\nHis competence in the role, however, does not make the character of Essendine any more likable. For that, the whole of the supporting cast would have needed to better understand and portray their character’s connections and pasts. Essendine is a narcissistic and self-righteous jackass, surrounded alternatingly by obnoxious sycophants, malcontented employees, and friends who can barely stand him—none of whom are any more likable than Essendine, to be frank. Cheating wives, lying ingénues, and deceitful young playwrights do not a caring audience member make without the actors giving those characters some dimension. If I don’t like or care about the characters, then it doesn’t matter how good the words on the page are; those witty retorts won’t elicit the reaction “good one!” so much as they’ll provoke the response “what a bunch of horrible asses.”\n\nThat’s not to say there’s nothing redeemable about the show. Beyond Combs, who delivers his character’s more powerful scenes with aplomb, there are other cast members who deserve special note. Adam Burton (“Roland Maule”) steals his scenes with bushy-tailed enthusiasm, and Doreen Loring (“Liz Essendine”) says her lines with a calm, steely detachment that sets her apart from everyone else on stage as someone not to be trifled with. I enjoyed Jessica Murillo’s (“Joanna Lyppiatt”) performance, without particularly enjoying anything she did or said. Paradoxical, I know. But go see it and you might agree with me.\n\nDirector Rachel Lindhart makes good use of the small stage in the Children’s Museum, and moves the character’s around constantly, keeping the action and the dialogue from getting sleepy. The set is also well-designed to make good use of such a small space, containing several entrances and exits without being cluttered. (Self-aware pretentious note to the prop masters, though: nobody who keeps their sherry and scotch in stoppered crystal at a bar station displays a bottle Johnny Walker Black Label alongside a bottle of Passport Scotch. That’s like hanging a Thomas Kinkade print right next to your authentic Edward Hopper.)\n\nI can’t like every play I see, but I can find things I like about every play I see. There were more than a handful of solid laughs, as well as some truly good performances within the cast. This is the last show in City Circle’s current season, and will be their last show in the Children’s Museum space, so consider attending Present Laughter to help support City Circle as they move into their next season and their new home."
