        "text": "Reviewer: Howard Steven Frydman aka “The Howard”\n\nProduction: The Drowsy Chaperone\n\nTheater: West Hartford Community Theater\n\nBook: Bob Martin & Don McKeller\n\nMusic & Lyrics by: Lisa Lambert & Greg Morrison\n\nDirector: Jane Cerosky\n\nChoreographer: Jen Bunger\n\nMusic Director: Benjamin Mabrey\n\nThe Howard says – “An Exuberant Musical Rom-Com Celebration\n\n“It’s a Wonderful Life” – no I am not speaking about the 1946 classic film starring Donna Reed and Jimmy Stewart- but a best of days presentation by the WHCT production of “The Drowsy Chaperone” – life is indeed wonderful and so is this “oh-so” inspirational production and its entire squad of performers!! Huzzah!! I just want you to know- here I sit with a full (from front to back) audience at the Duffy School theater in West Hartford Ct – yes, we are not alone in our joyous appreciation, and in this moment, we are infinite of our enjoyment of live theater. This is “The Howard’s” first venture to a WHCT PRODUCTION- yes, I’ve seen the lawn signs all throughout the borough of West Hartford, but it was through the intrepid invitation of multi-talented actress Ariana Straznicky (more on this talented dynamo in a few) that we have found ourselves sitting in the 4th row right in front of a live orchestra for a Sunday matinee performance. The lights lower and two hours later “The Howard” beams after taking in this most inventive, humorous, exuberant “Rom-Com” musical. Read on dear readers!!~\n\nOk – first things first – take it from “The Howard” – you will love the musical score by Lambert and Morrison- they are hummable classics, including: “Fancy Dress”, Cold Feet”, “Wedding Bells” the high kicking “Show Off” and the Tango-esque “I Am Aldolpho”. Believe you me- I am literally tired, exhausted and just “pooped out’ to go to a current NEW-AGE musical and hear monotone dirges that have somehow become classics- NOT FOR ME. Give me- “The Drowsy Chaperon” with its effervescent, zippy, foot stomping musical score that instills within you a wide-eyed “Joker” smile – which is a ‘Wonderful Thing”! Second – this cast- though this may only be a “community theater” believe you me- I was so so so impressed by this amazing array of pro and semi-pro actors, singers and dancers – these folks ALL belong on Broadway- and we hopefully hope ALL continue their love of live theater.\n\n“I Hate Theater- and I pray to heaven Oh Dear Lord in Heaven let it be a good show” states the “Man in Chair” ( Rick Fountain) – an old time musical theater fan- who on this day, dusts off one of his cherished rare LP records and relives the 1928 musical “The Drowsy Chaperone”. Slowly what is heard from the record, from Overture onward, comes alive. It’s the wedding of the year, nay the century – the Ultra Ritzy Mrs. Tottenham (Jenna Nikirk) with help by her “Underling” (Steve O’Brian) is hosting the wedding for Feldzieg’s Follies Starlet “Janet Van De Graaff” (Ariana Straznicky) and her intended Robert Martin (Michael Robb). Into the mix we are quickly introduced to an odd group of screw-ball characters –( think the Marx Brother’s “Animal Crackers”) -Feldzieg himself (Bob Janas) who does not want his “Star” to marry; Feldzieg’s duo of gangster henchmen/pastry chefs, (Anna Kelly & Tim Grant) the vain Latin lover “Aldolpho” (oh so funny Michael Cartwright) and finally Janet’s tipsy “Drowsy Chaperone”, ( what a glorious impressive voice from Tracy Funke) who is entrusted in keeping the intended bride and groom far apart until they actually can say “I Do”. Seeing is believing and believe you me – this is one production not to be missed!\n\nAs stated, my visit this day was by invitation from famed actress, opera singer, violinist, Ariana Straznicky, a “multi-talented dynamo”, who has shared her many talents to a worldwide audience. Let me rightly state “What a voice on this enchanted “Princess of Song”- simply lovely! We justly state Ariana is exquisite in performance here-a “high stepping” example of a true rising star. We so look forward to seeing her starring in additional productions or even Broadway bound! When asked why his production and this role was one of her “all time Faves” Ariana quickly stated, “The Drowsy Chaperone is my all-time favorite show and it means the world to me that I get to not only be in it, but also to play one of my very favorite characters: Janet Van de Graaff. Before I auditioned for the show, I wrote a fan letter to The Drowsy Chaperone writer, Bob Martin. Much to my surprise, he wrote me back! His sign off still makes me smile, “If you don’t if you didn’t get the part let me know and I will write a stern letter to whomever is responsible.” Make a wish on a star -and make it happen!\n\nA great cast is worth repeating – featuring Rick Fountain as “Man in Chair”, Tracy Funke as “The Drowsy Chaperone” with Steve O’Brien as “Underling”, Ariana Straznicky as “Janet Van de Graaff”, and Michael Robb as “Robert Martin”. Bob Janas as theatre producer, “Feldzieg”, his wannabe starlet “Kitty” Mona Tiglio. Nathan Holbrook as “George”, Jenna Nikirk as “Mrs. Tottendale”, and Michael Cartwright in the role of “Aldolpho”. Cwen Williams as “Trix the Aviatrix”, Anna Kelly and Tim Grant as Gangsters and Randie Fierberg as the “Superintendant”. The Ensemble cast includes Avery Allen, Lisa Camargo, Noreen Cavanaugh, Randie Fierberg, Naomi Scheinerman, Karen Shakun, and Izzy Steinberg.\n\nWe rightly now present the coveted “The Howard Noticed You” Awards AKA “The HNY’s” to two members of the cast, first to that comedic dynamo Michael Cartwright as the bigger than Life “Aldolpho – you sir were absolutely amazing! Our second HNY is presented to the “The Drowsy Chaperone” herself, Tracy Funke, I was literally “blown away” by your stage presence and that delicious voice of yours – a “most exciting on-stage presentation. Good Work to the entire production! Enjoy!!\n\nPerformances are Nov. 4 at 8pm, Nov. 5 at 2pm, Nov. 10 and 11 at 8pm and Nov. 12th at 2:00 pm at Duffy School, 95 Westminster Drive, West Hartford, CT.
