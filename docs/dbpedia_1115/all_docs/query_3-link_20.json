        "text": "Shoutout to Seth Smith '20! He's a senior majoring in Management and Economics at Old Dominion University. He's also spent his summer as a merchandising intern at Dollar Tree Corporate.\n\n\"It has been an eye-opening experience to observe the inner workings of a Fortune 500 company that generates billions of dollars annually,\" said Smith. \"My team is responsible for researching, selecting and managing many of the products customers see in the over 8,000 Dollar Tree stores nationwide, as well as identifying trends and opportunities in the market.\"\n\nThe internship will conclude the second week of August and is his fifth internship during his undergraduate career and his second experience with a Fortune 500 company.\n\n\"I've interned with Automatic Data Processing Inc. (ADP), The Breeden Company/Breeden Construction, and the newly founded ODU Monarch Internship and Co-Op Office,\" said Smith. \"I've gained a plethora of knowledge from every internship I've completed. If there's one piece thing I've learned throughout my undergraduate journey, it's that internships shape the trajectory of where you go in life, especially in business and when you're in college. I've arguably learned more outside of the classroom by engaging in experiential learning opportunities (including internships or LEAP when I was at Collegiate) than I ever have in a lecture hall.\"\n\nPost-graduation from ODU, Seth plans to apply to the University of Virginia for his master's degree.\n\nMiddle school students attended an in-school Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Social Justice conference on Feb. 28, 2024. The conference was titled, ‚ÄúBuilding a Community of Belonging,‚Äù and featured guest speaker Jason Mundy, the director of diversity, equity and engagement at Durham Academy. Mr. Mundy is also the former head of Norfolk Collegiate‚Äôs upper school and middle school.\n\nMr. Mundy‚Äôs message was, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just a middle schooler; what difference can I make?‚Äù It was inspired by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.‚Äôs philosophy of nonviolence. The conference opened with an address from Head of School Scott Kennedy, Head of the Middle School Chris Tillson, Director of Diversity and Inclusion (DEI) Dr. Nefertiti Makeda, and a special video produced by the Middle School Allies DEI Club and upper school students who attended a National Association of Independent Schools Student Diversity Leadership Conference.\n\n‚ÄúI thought the conference was amazing, it taught valuable lessons for everyone,‚Äù said Laci B. ‚Äô28, who serves as the Allies Club vice president. ‚ÄúMy goal (for the conference) was to get everyone to try to be kinder and to see things from a different perspective, while our goal for the conference was to share what our club was about and to teach everyone to be more of a kind inclusive person.‚Äù\n\nAllies President Taylor B. ‚Äô28 agreed. ‚ÄúThe conference was very educational, and I especially loved our guest speaker, Mr. Mundy. He was truly amazing and discussed some great points. I‚Äôm super excited about what the middle school will improve and make it even more exciting next year,‚Äù she said.\n\nNorfolk Collegiate is proud to present ‚ÄúThe Drowsy Chaperone‚Äù at 7 p.m. on Friday, April 12, and Saturday, April 13, and at 3 p.m. on Sunday, April 14, in the Hackney Theater in the Meredith Center for the Arts. Our amazing student performers will be accompanied by a professional orchestra provided in partnership with Tidewater Winds.\n\nWinner of five Tony Awards, \"The Drowsy Chaperone\" is a loving send-up of the Golden Age musical, featuring one show-stopping song and dance number after another.\n\nWhy all the awards??\n\nWith the houselights down, a man in a chair appears on stage and puts on his favorite record: the cast recording of a fictitious 1928 musical. The recording comes to life and \"The Drowsy Chaperone\" begins as the man in the chair provides hilarious commentary. Mix in two lovers on the eve of their wedding, a bumbling best man, a desperate theatre producer, a not-so-bright hostess, two gangsters posing as pastry chefs, a misguided Don Juan and a delirious chaperone, and you have the ingredients for an evening of madcap delight.\n\nThe play is open to the public and will be performed live. Admission is $5 for students and $15 for regular admission and cash and card are accepted.\n\nFor more information, please email Mr. Hoyle at bhoyle@norfolkcollegiate.org or Ms. Gondek at mgondek@norfolkcollegiate.org.\n\nWe hope you can join us for this wonderful event!\n\nUpper school students heard from a panel of women in the military as part of the school‚Äôs recognition of Women‚Äôs History Month on March 29, 2024. This year‚Äôs theme is ‚ÄúWomen Who Advocate for Equity, Diversity and Inclusion.‚Äù\n\nSusan Moore, upper school Math and middle and upper school Design Thinking & Computing teacher kicked off the event and spoke about her time in the United States Coast Guard Academy and the Coast Guard.\n\nThe panel included Cmdr. Veronica Anderson, U.S. Navy; Cmdr. Brittany Laird, U.S. Navy; YN1 Mackenzie Williams, U.S. Navy; and Cmdr. Amanda Harris, U.S. Coast Guard. Each spoke about their journey in the Armed Forces and at the end, answered questions from the students.\n\nMiddle and upper school performing arts students joined Mary Faber, an award-winning actor, singer and puppeteer for an informal session on what it‚Äôs like to live a life in the performing arts.\n\nFaber's career reflects her range of talent, from being the lead in ‚ÄúBoss Baby: Back in the Crib‚Äù on Netflix to being on Broadway, starring in shows like ‚ÄúAvenue Q,‚Äù ‚ÄúAmerican Idiot,‚Äù and ‚ÄúHow to Succeed in Business‚Äù with Daniel Radcliffe and John Larroquette. Her TV roles include Ashley on HBO‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Brink,‚Äù Macy in Jim Carrey‚Äôs ‚ÄúKidding‚Äù on Showtime, and as fan favorite Sweetums lobbyist Kathryn Pinewood on ‚ÄúParks and Recreation.‚Äù\n\nFaber, aunt to Thomas W. ‚Äô25, spoke about her career and answered a range of student questions.\n\n‚ÄúMost of what I do is voiceover and I love it,‚Äù said Faber who also does a lot of work as session singer and as an ADR.\n\nWhen asked what her favorite role has been, ‚ÄúParks and Rec. was my most favorite on-camera role. She (Kathryn Pinewood) was an evil lobbyist,‚Äù Faber said, and was a lot of fun to play.\n\nShe also encouraged students to try improvisation.\n\n‚ÄúImprove education isn‚Äôt just for people who want to be superstars,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúimprov is really great way to learn how to interact.‚Äù\n\nStudents in Nicole Mottinger‚Äôs second grade class were surprised yesterday when ùüµùüØ.ùü≥ ùóïùó¢ùóï ùóôùó† Morning Guy Eric and Julianne Worden surprised their teacher and the students with tickets to this Saturday‚Äôs Harlem Globetrotters game at the Chartway Arena.\n\nThe tickets were part of the Ballin‚Äô in the Classroom contest and our very own Mrs. Mottinger was the winner! The contest called on Hampton Roads to nominate ‚Äúa teacher who knows how to dribble, dunk, and teach; a teacher that is ‚ÄòBallin‚Äô in the Classroom.‚Äô‚Äù The contest was looking for a teacher who ‚Äúmakes learning come alive by incorporating sports and physical fitness in the classroom.‚Äù\n\nAs a result of the contest, Mrs. Mottinger‚Äôs class will get to see the game and they‚Äôll be honored on the court by the Globetrotters this Saturday.\n\n‚ÄúWhen I found out that my class and I had won the Ballin' in the Classroom contest, I was beyond excited for my students and myself,‚Äù said Nicole Mottinger. ‚ÄúI am so proud of my second graders. They show commitment and interest in fitness inside and outside of the classroom every day, and I enjoy helping them reach their fitness goals by running alongside them in the Shamrock Final Mile and helping to coach Girls on the Run.‚Äù\n\nSeveral upper school students participated in the Virginia Center for Inclusive Communities‚Äô Diversity Dialogue Day at Old Dominion University. The one-day event brings together students from public and private schools. With the help of trained facilitators, the program works to increase the students‚Äô understanding of what prejudice is, decrease stereotypic attitudes and develop an expanded awareness of discrimination and its harmful effects on individuals and groups. It also works to expose students to diverse perspectives and create connections between peers.\n\nStudents learned about the LISTEN Model which emphasizes:\n\nLOOK: Look at the person speaking and make good eye contact\n\nINQUIRE: Ask open-ended questions\n\nSUMMARIZE: Reflect your understanding of what the person is saying\n\nTAKE NOTES: Write down or make mental notes about what the other person is saying\n\nENCOURAGE: Use positive nonverbal and verbal cues to encourage the person to say more\n\nNEUTRALIZE: Try to stay positive and avoid bias\n\nThe goal was to have students leave feeling an increased sense of personal empowerment and recognize the positive impact they can have on their own school and communities.\n\nCollegiate's winter athletic season student-athletes were honored on Wednesday, March 13, 2024, in front of their peers during the Middle and Upper School Winter Athletic Awards program. The winter season saw student-athletes take on swimming, cheer, wrestling and basketball in the longest season for our Oaks, beginning Nov. 6, 2023, and ending on March 1, 2024, with our last basketball game.\n\nStandout student-athletes were awarded plaques describing their role on their respective teams, including the following awards: Most Valuable Players; Most Improved Players; Team Manager and OAK Award, which honors the impressive attributes in the student to which it‚Äôs awarded. ‚ÄúO‚Äù stands for overachiever, ‚ÄúA‚Äù stands for attitude and ‚ÄúK‚Äù stands for knowledge. This is also the first year that the Outstanding Teammate Award is being ‚Äúgiven to the athlete who displays inspiring dedication and commitment to their team embodying sportsmanship, character and spirit,‚Äù said Director of Athletics Jon Hall.\n\nGood luck, Natalia C. ‚Äô24! She is competing in the regional Poetry Out Loud competition tomorrow, Saturday, Feb. 10, 2024. The competition will have the top three from each semi-final round moving on to the state competition in Richmond.\n\nNatalia, Chloe S. ‚Äô24, Izzy R. ‚Äô24 and Sophie H. ‚Äô26 competed for a chance to represent Norfolk Collegiate in this year‚Äôs regional Poetry Out Loud competition in December 2023, each reciting from the Poetry Out Loud anthology.\n\nPoetry Out Loud is a national poetry recitation competition that encourages students to learn about and memorize great poetry. The goal of the competition is to help students master public speaking skills, build self-confidence and learn about literary history while exploring contemporary life.\n\nStudents participate yearly at school, regional, state and national levels. This year, Natalia, Chloe, Izzy and Sophie delivered poignant renditions of the top picks. Two of Natalia‚Äôs selections were ‚ÄúAll This and More‚Äù by Mary Karr and ‚ÄúMr. Darcy‚Äù by Victoria Chang.\n\n‚ÄúPoetry is such an interesting form of writing,‚Äù Natalia said of why she is drawn to the form of expression. As for why she selected ‚ÄúMr. Darcy,‚Äù she said, ‚ÄúIt was a lot of fun to work out a poem with no punctuation.‚Äù\n\nTomorrow‚Äôs competition will have the top three from each semi-final round moving to the state competition in Richmond.\n\nGood luck, Natalia!"
