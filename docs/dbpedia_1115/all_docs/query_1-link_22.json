        "text": "If you like old-time musicals, you should love “The Drowsy Chaperone.”\n\nOn the other hand, if you hate old-time musicals, you might also love “The Drowsy Chaperone.”\n\nThat’s the charm of the Tony-winning spoof of the 1920s extravaganza: In sending up the standards of yesteryear, it manages to tease with understanding, to undercut with wit, to mock with love.\n\n“It plays on all the stereotypes,” said Adam Miller, managing director of Theatre Tuscaloosa, which opens the musical comedy tonight for a run through July 24.\n\nThe central character, an agoraphobic older man who spins his favorite old Broadway records to chase away “non-specific sadness,” is played by Gary Wise, who himself is not a huge musical fan.\n\nWise has performed tons of theater locally, from the classical to the comedic, but only pops up in musicals once in a blue moon.\n\nBy his reckoning, his last musical was Theatre Tuscaloosa’s 1990 production of “Little Shop of Horrors,” in which he played the sadistic dentist, done by Steve Martin in the film.\n\nBut Theatre Tuscaloosa executive producer Tina F. Turley sold Wise on the show, which debuted on Broadway in 2006 and won Tonys for Best Book and Best Score, in which a faux-musical comedy of the same title comes to vivid life as The Man In Chair reminisces, transforming his drab, dry apartment into glitzy, song-and-dance-filled stages.\n\n“When I found I didn’t have to sing, I didn’t have to dance, and I get to play records, I said ‘I’m in,’ ” said Wise, an avid record collector who has brought in one of his numerous vintage turntables, and a small portion of his vast collection of vinyl, to serve as stage props.\n\n“To me it’s more of a farce than a musical,” he said.\n\n“The Drowsy Chaperone” began life as a kind of inside joke, written by friends for writer/actor/comedian Bob Martin, on his marriage to wife Janet. Martin, with Don McKellar, expanded the book, and Lisa Lambert and Greg Morrison wrote the accompanying songs, a tribute to jazz age American musicals, with their dizzy heroines, dashing dudes, dastardly villains and vaudeville energy. Martin later played The Man in Chair on both London and New York stages.\n\nThe show within the show centers on showgirl Janet (Lisa Waldrop), who plans to give up her career to marry handsome Robert Martin (Drey Mitchell).\n\nBut big money rides on Janet staying with Feldzieg’s Follies, so her producer, Feldzieg (Glen Johnson) is followed by two punning gangsters, disguised as pastry chefs (Anthony Noland and Barrett Guyton), working to bollix the wedding.\n\nFeldzieg hires Aldolpho (Peyton Conley), a bumbling Latin lover-type, to try and come between the betrothed couple. Janet, meanwhile, having doubts about her groom, goes undercover as a French woman to try and seduce Robert herself, and mistaken identities, dream sequences, deus ex machina and other slapstick ensues.\n\nAlso among the cast are the chaperone (Ava Buchanan) who’s more drunken than drowsy, an absent-minded dowager (Drew Baker), an unflappable English butler (Charles Prosser), an overstressed best man (Ray Taylor) and a ditzy dame (Molly Page) who’d plot to replace Janet, if she only had a brain.\n\nWhile The Man in Chair watches, he also hops up to editorialize on the various actor-personalities who performed in the show, adding a wealth of trivia along with his personal stories.\n\nThe play-within-a-play is always acknowledged, as some of the actors showcase personal foibles that supersede the script; at one point the record skips, so the last notes and moves of a song-and-dance routine repeat until The Man in Chair tips the turntable.\n\nOther surprises and “mistakes” run throughout the production, centered around the foibles of old-school musicals, and of turntables.\n\nConley, a University of Alabama graduate acting student, saw the first U.S. tour of “Drowsy Chaperone,” and was thrilled when he heard Theatre Tuscaloosa was putting it on its season.\n\n“I think this musical is Cupid’s love letter to musicals,” Conley said. “It’s so wonderful, so sincere and so sweet and wonderfully written at the same time. It’s silly and I love it.”\n\nPage, who saw the original Broadway production in 2006, welcomed the chance to play something frothy after more serious turns for Theatre Tuscaloosa, as the harried wife in “Sylvia” and as Helen Keller’s mother in “The Miracle Worker.”\n\n“Part of what makes this show work is the writing,” she said. “You can tell (the writers) know and love theater.”\n\nGuyton, a UA undergrad in theater, concurred.\n\n“It is brilliant in its dumbness,” he said, laughing.\n\nBut what’s making it really cook, cast members said, is the combination of Turley’s direction, Stacy Alley’s choreography, Leslie Poss’s musical direction, Andy Fitch’s mobile set and Jeanette Waterman’s eye-popping costumes.\n\n“They make you really want to step up your game, to be up with them,” said Mitchell, a UA undergrad.\n\nMix that with a cast that has really gelled, that looks forward to each night rehearsing together, and you should have a hit, Page said.\n\n“It sounds cheesy, but if the audience enjoys itself half as much as we do, it’ll be a riot,” she said. n"
