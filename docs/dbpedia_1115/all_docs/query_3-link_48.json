Those include stage adaptations of the movies Beetlejuice and Moulin Rouge!; Jagged Little Pill, which takes its score and its thematic cue from the chart-topping 1995 Alanis Morissette album and features a book by Diablo Cody; Ain’t Too Proud, a bio-musical tracing the rise of Motown superstars The Temptations; and the Tina Turner bio titled — what else? — Tina, a smash in London’s West End, headlining a breakout performance from Adrienne Warren.\n\nShows expected to make the crossing from London and now in the mix for the 2019-20 season include Matthew Lopez’s acclaimed two-part epic on gay love after the AIDS crisis, The Inheritance, directed by Stephen Daldry; and the gender-flipped revival of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth’s Company, starring Rosalie Craig and featuring Broadway royalty Patti LuPone. Pundits also are watching to see if Conor McPherson’s Girl From the North Country, a Depression-era drama set to the songs of Bob Dylan, which was a hit both in London and in its sold-out, extended U.S. premiere at the Public Theater, will confirm a long-rumored uptown move.\n\nIn the meantime, The Hollywood Reporter provides a complete roundup below, with reviews and production images of all the contenders for 2019 Tony Awards, including those that figure in the nominations and those that were shut out."
