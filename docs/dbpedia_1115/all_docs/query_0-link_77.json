When a loyal fan shares a rare recording of his favorite musical, the characters come to life in an exciting tale of love and delight that leaves audiences breathless. A wedding, gangsters disguised as pastry chefs, and a drunk chaperone are just a few of the ingredients in this delicious farcical treat that is fun for the whole family.\n\n“The Perfect Broadway Musical.” —New York Magazine\n\nSPECIAL DATES:\n\nOpening night, September 7: Guests will be treated to a post-show celebration with the cast and crew!\n\nSaturday, September 8 : Guests are invited to a post show talk back.\n\nOCTA is thrilled to announce that we will be hosting a talkback with one of the inspirations for, and characters of, the musical The Drowsy Chaperone.
