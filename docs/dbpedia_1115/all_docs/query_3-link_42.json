        "text": "News From the Festival\n\nThe Greenshow: A Celebration of Community\n\nThe Utah Shakespeare Festival is excited to announce the cast members for this summerâs production of The Greenshow, written and directed by Britannia Howe, who also directed Cymbeline in 2021 and The Greenshow in 2018, 2019, and 2021. The themes for Howeâs two Greenshows are The Hills of Appalachia and English Regency Garden Party.\n\nIn addition, a third Greenshow theme will be Paiute Heritage and Celebration and will be produced and performed by the Paiute Tribal Youth Performers from five local Paiute Bands.\n\nNative Youth Coordinator Roger Clark explained that different youth performers will rotate through the summerâs performances and include (pictured, starting top left, then clockwise) Ashton Aguayo, Reggie Harjo, Charlie Parashonts, Sully John, Lydia Fisher, and Mars Jake. This Greenshow will include drumming, singing, dancing, and flute playing, along with audience participation. This is the first time in the Festivalâs history that another organization has produced an entire Greenshow, and Clark and his youth performers are very excited about the opportunity.Â\n\nHowe comments that âThe Greenshow celebrates community at the Utah Shakespeare Festival by audience participatory storytelling. And I hope that you join us to help tell those stories. I hope to see you on The Green.â\n\nFor the Greenshows directed by Howe, the cast is as follows:\n\nAshley Aquino, new to the Festival, will perform as a Featured Performer in The Greenshow and Mustardseed in A Midsummer Nightâs Dream, and is an understudy for Lady Montague/Paris Page/Female Ensemble in Romeo and Juliet.

He recently performed in Matilda and The Play That Goes Wrong for Syracuse Stage, as Barnaby Tucker in Hello, Dolly! by Douglas Morrisson Theater, and as Robert Martin in The Drowsy Chaperone for Los Positas Theater.\n\nAvery Peterson is also new to Festival audiences and appears courtesy of the Southern Utah University Fellowship Program.

Tickets and information are available by calling 800-PLAYTIX or visiting bard.org.\n\n10 Facts About The Greenshow\n\nEvery Monday-Saturday during the summer, starting on June 21, the Festival puts on a 30 minute Greenshow that starts at 7:10 p.m. This family-friendly outdoor entertainment contains singing, dancing, stories, music, and audience participation.Â\n\nThis season, the themes include: The Hills of Appalachia, English Regency Garden Party, and Paiute Heritage and Celebration, which will rotate on different nights throughout the week. To find out which show is on for the night, visit our calendar at bard.org.Â\n\nHeld on the Ashton Family Greenshow Commons, the show is free and open to the public. It is the perfect way to get a taste of the Festival, or to settle in before an evening production. We canât wait to see you there!Â\n\nBritannia Howe is returning to direct The Greenshow once again. She has plenty of experience at the Festival, having directed it in 2018, 2019, and 2021. Howe also directed Cymbeline in 2021 in the Anes Studio Theatre.Â\n\nThe Hills of Appalachia is âinfluenced by themes in A Midsummer Nightâs Dream, myths of fairy folklore,â says Howe. A Midsummmer Nightâs Dream plays this season in the Englestad Shakespeare Theatre.Â\n\nEnglish Regency Garden Party is a theme that hasnât been done before at The Greenshow, and takes its inspiration from Jane Austenâs Emma The Musical, being performed in the Randall L. Jones Theatre this season.\n\nInspired by the Paiute Tribal Youth Performers from the Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah who performed each night preceding The Greenshow in 2021 and 2022, this is the first time that another group outside of the Festival has ever been in charge of a Greenshow night.Â\n\nBarbara Adams, the wife of the late Festival Founder Fred C. Adams, was the force that continually kept The Greenshow improving and growing. The Festival was founded in 1961, and in those beginning years, Barbara actually taught a group to play recorders and go downtown to sing medieval music and invite people to come to the Festival that evening.\n\nA form of pre-show entertainment, the early years of the show contained a version of dancing, music, and a Punch and Judy puppet show. Now, The Greenshow rotates through three different nights, each containing an elaborately different theme.Â\n\nThe Greenshow is very reminiscent of theatre during Shakespeareâs time. It was common for stages to have an open pit in front, where people could stand and watch. Our beautiful green lawn area represents this open space. Additionally, with minimal scenery, the dialogue, dancing, and music is the most important partââjust like in Shakespeareâs day.Â\n\nWhen Shakespeareâs plays were performed during his time, the performances took place in the afternoon because it was too dark at night. Our Greenshows perform during daylight as well, so no additional lighting is necessary. Also, the colorful costumesâ just like they were years agoâ are an important part of the production.Â\n\nEnjoy a tart during the show! Did you know that we have lovely employees that walk around in traditional Shakespearean costumes and sell our famous tarts that will be made by a local bakery? What could be better?!\n\nThe Greenshow is extremely family-friendly. Itâs common for entire families to come together, with young children dancing to the music and often being selected for audience participation if they wish to volunteer. Some people even bring picnics or their dogsââthe more, the merrier!Â\n\nThe Greenshow will open June 21 and run until September 9. Donât miss out! For more information, and to purchase tickets to the seasonâs plays, visit bard.org.\n\nPaiute Tribal Youth Return to Perform at The Greenshow\n\nIn 2021 and 2022, the Paiute Tribal Youth Performers from the Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah took the stage before The Greenshow each evening. The performances consisted of dancing, flute playing, and drumming by the talented local youth.\n\nThis year, the Festival is excited to announce that the Paiute Tribal Youth Performers will have the entirety of a Greenshow to share their talent. Their show will be one of three themed shows that will rotate throughout the weekââin addition to Director Britannia Howeâs English Regency Garden Party and The Hills of Appalachia.\n\nNative Youth Coordinator Roger Clark explained that different youth performers will rotate through the summerâs performances and that there will be drumming, singing, dancing, and flute playing.Â\n\nThis is the first time ever that another organization outside of the Festival has produced an entire Greenshow, and Clark is excited about the opportunity.Â\n\nâIt will give us the opportunity to better build awareness of the indigenous people of this area, with the focus on the Paiute Indian Tribe,â Clark said. âWe are excited to share our youthâs talents.âÂ\n\nOur Festival patrons can expect to be immersed in a deeply rich and historical culture.Â\n\nâThe Native American culture has been around for thousands of years, while Shakespeare was born only in 1564,â Clark said. âItâll be different from what [patrons] will see in the theatre.âÂ\n\nFrom Clarkâs perspective, Shakespeare is quite modern in comparison to what the Paiute Tribal Youth Performers are sharing. Because of this, the performance will provide patrons with the opportunity to enjoy an ancient and long-standing tradition in addition to the more modern productions the Festival has prepared this season.Â\n\nâIt will be good for [patrons] to know and understand the beauty of the Native American culture,â Clark said. The Festival acknowledges the land whereon it sits is the traditional and ancestral homelands of the Nungâwu (Southern Paiutes).\n\nClark noted that there will be audience participation, so those seeing the show will have the opportunity to participate while learning about the Paiute culture.Â\n\nFor more information on The Greenshow, visit bard.org. The Paiute Heritage and Celebration Greenshow will be on Wednesday evenings at 7:10 pm beginning June 21 and is free and open to the public.\n\nFestival Welcomes Two Staff Members\n\nRecently the Festival welcomed two individuals to new positions on the year-round staff. Liz Armstrong and Amy Gold began in early May and are excited to be a part of preparing for the upcoming season.Â\n\nLiz Armstrong, a native of Spring Creek, Nevada, is the Festivalâs new Communications Associate. She recently completed her Master of Arts in Professional Communication at Southern Utah University. She also has a Bachelor of Arts in English and Communications from SUU and worked as a part-time writer and content creator for the Festival as well as an Accent Editor for SUU News while she finished her degrees.Â\n\nHer love of writing goes back to when she was a child.\n\nâGrowing up, I was constantly reading and writing, and I always knew I wanted to be a writer. I would write fictional stories and mail them to my grandparents, who encouraged my hobbies and made me feel I could pursue it as a career, alongside with my wonderful parents and teachers.â\n\nDuring her time at SUU News, Armstrong had the opportunity to interview Festival Director of Development and Communications Donn Jersey for a piece called âTheatre Under the Stars.âÂ\n\nShe comments that during their interaction he was âwelcoming, encouraging, and made me really believe in myself as a writer.â It was her first introduction to the Festival, and she says she walked away from that experience and thought: âmy dream job would be to work there.âÂ\n\nA year or so later, with Jerseyâs business card still taped to the inside of her notebook, she says she worked up the courage to ask him if there were any job openings at the Festival. She was hired to write articles for the Festivalâs former Publications Manager Bruce Lee, who âhelped me become more confident as a writer.â She also ran the Festivalâs social media for a time.\n\nWhen asked what attracted her to the new position, Armstrong replied: âI love the atmosphere of the Festival and felt I was ready for more.âÂ\n\nIn her new position, she will assist with marketing, publications, advertising, and overall communications while continuing to write for the Festival.\n\nAmy Gold, originally from Upper Michigan, is the Festivalâs new Business Operations Assistant. She is a Cedar City resident and is currently pursuing a Master’s Degree in Arts Administration from SUU. She is also very active with other local arts organizations, such as Suzuki Strings Cedar City and the Orchestra of Southern Utah, the local community orchestra.Â\n\nWhen asked about her experience in the arts, like Armstrong, she says it goes all the way back to her childhood.\n\nâI learned the violin growing up and played in pit orchestras for our high school musicals which started my love for theatre,â says Gold.Â\n\nAs a music major in college at BYU-Hawaii, she says she developed tendonitis and ended up taking some time off from music. â[I] ventured into acting classes. Best detour ever.â\n\nShe even nearly finished a theatre minor before the program was discontinued. Since then sheâs worked and lived in various places including teaching music in public schools and in private lessons while raising her family.Â\n\nShe was familiar with the Festival prior to moving to Cedar City in 2016 when her husband took a job at SUU. A friend who taught English and Shakespeare and who attended every season highly recommended it. Then a neighbor took her to see Mary Poppins and sheâs been attending ever since.Â\n\nWith her children raised and out of the house, she decided to pursue the arts administration graduate degree. She found that instead of looking for a summer internship this year as part of the program, she would apply for this position with the Festival instead.Â\n\nâIn deciding to work full-time, it was really important to me that the place be as good a fit as the position. And this fits on both counts! The energy here is electric. I feel very fortunate to have been hired on here!â\n\nWhen asked what sheâs looking forward to the most, she says âworking with great people, seeing the shows, and meeting people from all over!â\n\nShe will be responsible for assisting the business office at the Festival with financial paperwork, purchasing, contracts, and bookkeeping.\n\nFestival Welcomes 2023 Company During Arrival Day\n\nWe are thrilled to announce that we welcomed the Festival’s seasonal company last week! Monday, May 8, was arrival day for actors, directors, designers, and artists who checked in, attended group meetings, took tours, and excitedly gathered in preparation for the season to come.Â\n\nIn the Randall L. Jones Theatre for the opening meeting, returning company members embraced one another while also welcoming those here for the first time.Â\n\nâWelcome to the 62nd season of the Utah Shakespeare Festival,â Interim Managing Director Michael Bahr exclaimed. âWe are so thrilled to have you here!âÂ\n\nThe number of seasonal artists who come each year and are required to put a season together is extensive and includes directors, designers, stage management, the performing company, voice and speech coaches, music directors/conductors/composers, fight and intimacy directors, choreographers, dramaturgs, hair and makeup artists, props artisans, costume and craft technicians, carpenters, painters, scenic artisans, electrics/sound technicians, guest services, concessionaires, and facilities personnel, among others. These groups of people are in addition to the year-round staff at the Festival.Â\n\nFollowing the welcome meeting hosted by Bahr and Interim Artistic Director/Director of New Play Development Derek Charles Livingston, the company wasted no time getting to workââ attending first rehearsals; checking out shops and work spaces; taking measurements for the performing company; and settling in for the magical season ahead.Â\n\nPublications Manager Marlo Ihler noted that the excitement was palpable during arrival day.Â\n\nâMeeting the incoming company members in person takes all the work weâve been doing to prepare for this season to a whole new level,â Ihler said.\n\nDirector of Development and Communications Donn Jersey compared the feeling of arrival day to that of a child on Christmas Eve.\n\nâThe company arrival day has the same appeal to me . . . the hurried anticipation of all the gifts that will fill me with joy,â Jersey said. âTo quote Lin Manuel-Miranda, the plan is to fan this spark into a flame.âÂ\n\nThat evening the entire company, year-round staff, families and friends, and special guests were treated to an opening BBQ dinner, hosted by the Guild of the Utah Shakespeare Festival. It was held in the courtyard of the beloved retired Adams Memorial Theatre that the Festival used for decades.Â\n\nIn the first rehearsal for A Midsummer Nightâs Dream with Director Jessica Kubzansky, cast, and crew, the director shared what she hoped the play would achieve this season.Â\n\nâThere is so much hate in the world, I thought it was important that we tell a story about how we get to a place of more authentic and inclusive love. This is a story about humanity,â Kubzansky said.Â\n\nAlthough Kubzansky was speaking about the play she is directing, this statement can be applied to the Festivalâs mission as a whole, as well as the productions this season.Â\n\nâAt the end of the night people are changed and moved . . . and there is joy,â Kubzansky said.Â\n\nThat is exactly the feeling we hope you get when you attend a night (or afternoon) of theaterââa kind of rejuvenation, healing, inspiration, and introspection.\n\nWe canât wait to see you when we open June 21, and in the meantime, our entire company and staff will be hard at work in preparation for a magnificent season.\n\nFurthermore, after keeping our doors locked for the safety of our company and staff during the pandemic, we are excited to announce that our administration building is now open during business hours! Our front desk will now be staffed by both volunteers and our Company Management staff.

The Bard is regarded as one of the greatest writers in the English language, as well as one of its most revered and studied dramatists, and we love involving the communityââand especially studentsââwhen we celebrate him. The Bardâs Birthday Bash took place on April 19-21 this year.Â\n\nSince the Festival was founded in 1961 by the late Fred C. Adams, we have celebrated the genius, magic, brilliance, and importance of Shakespeareâs works and continue to recognize him as the cornerstone of our mission.\n\nâItâs a way to celebrate Shakespeare and theatrical performance, and to get a taste of theatre, dance, and youthful energy and optimism,â Interim Managing Director Michael Bahr said.Â\n\nThe 22nd annual event targets local elementary school students, in order to build excitement and connection to Shakespeare at a young age. Community members were also welcome to attend.Â\n\nThe celebration took place on the grounds of Southern Utah University and consisted of jousting, dancing the Maypole, performances in the Adams Memorial Theatre, theatre games, and birthday cake with Queen Elizabeth. This year, the bash was even more specialââan extra day was added to the schedule to make room to celebrate with even more students, teachers, and community members.Â\n\n“Celebrating The Bard with young people is one of the highlights of the year. These students come with such enthusiasm and joy, while participating in both performative and physical activities,â Associate Education Director Stewart Shelley said.Â\n\nâAs the 2023 school year comes to a close, it is wonderful to see students out-of-doors, laughing, playing, and enjoying this birthday celebration together,â Shelley added.Â\n\nA cadre of volunteers from the Festivalâs education department, Guild of the Utah Shakespeare Festival, and SUU Play Team members ran the event.Â\n\nâStudents rotated through the different activities and shared in the celebratory festivities,â Shelley explained. âMany schools were able to perform a brief piece of Shakespeare’s literature with us on the Adams stage, and others who didnât bring a piece had the opportunity to learn and perform some lines while here.â\n\nTo register for next yearâs Birthday Bash, email usfeducation@bard.org with the name of the school, the teachers, contact information, and the approximate number of students.

While the audiences were similar, the goals for each show were different.\n\nOthello was designed for audiences to have a condensed yet complete theatrical experience, with lights, costume, and sound design. Every Brilliant Thing was a much smaller production with only one actor that aimed to reach students with important messages about mental health and hope.Â\n\nOthelloÂ\n\nShakespeare in the Schools is a program that âbrings quality Shakespeare performances and workshops to schools and communities throughout the West,â and has been doing so for twenty-nine years. This year was no exception. This time the touring company performed for nearly 10,000 students and 600 teachers and staff.Â\n\nSince January 30, a team of ten members traveled across Arizona, Idaho, Nevada, and Utah to bring timely messages of the dangers of jealousy, racism, and manipulation found in Othello to primarily middle and high school students. The team consisted of Tour Manager Abby Nakken,Â Stage Manager Lindy Rublaitus, Technical Director April Salazar, and actors Nazlah Black, Darin Earl II, Ian Geers, Rachel J. Jones, Shay Jowers, Noah Ratgen, and Nic Sanchez.Â\n\nView photos from the Othello tour here.\n\nEvery Brilliant ThingÂ\n\nFilled with humor and inventiveness, the plot explored hope and depression, change and uncertainty, relationships and risk, guilt and forgiveness.Â\n\nAlso directed by Cordell Cole, the traveling company consisted of just four members: Tour Manager Jordan Simmons, Stage Manager Kathryn Whilden, and actors Kat Lee and Jeremy Thompson, who took turns playing the role.Â\n\nBeginning February 13, the tour traveled to numerous schools and communities in Utah. The production was free to any school in Utah that was interested and was performed for almost 2,000 students and 500 adults.\n\nView photos from the Every Brilliant Thing tour here.\n\nOn the Road\n\nThe touring season presented challenges, such as record snowfall and incredibly emotional shows that required a lot from the teams. But the company members of the two tours were pleased to reach so many people.Â\n\nâWe had incredible responses from our audiences with thought provoking and exciting questions during our talkbacks after the shows,â Shelley said. âWe are sad to see our team depart, but incredibly proud of the work they have done over the past four months.â\n\n2024 Tours\n\nAlthough the tours recently had their last performances this year, touring will continue in the spring of 2024.Â Â\n\nThe title for next yearâs Shakespeare in the Schools was recently announced by the Festivalâs education staff.Â\n\nâ2024 will be the 30th Anniversary of the Festivalâs Shakespeare in the Schools program! To mark this milestone, we are thrilled to be presenting Shakespeare’s incomparable Hamlet for schools across the region,â Education Director Katherine Norman said.\n\nâIn addition to our immense gratitude for the work of these two tours, we are also excitedly looking forward to next year! 2024 will be the third iteration of Every Brilliant Thing throughout the state of Utah,â Norman said. âWe are thrilled to be able to bring this hopeful and life-saving message to even more students.â\n\nFor more information about next yearâs educational touring productions, please reach out to the Festivalâs education department at usfeducation@bard.org.\n\n5th Annual Make A Scene Fundraiser a Successful, Fun Event\n\nThe Utah Shakespeare Festival hosted the fifth annual Make A Scene fundraising event on April 19 at the West Valley City Performing Arts Center in northern Utah. The one-night-only gala featured dinner and a comedic performance of Romeo and Juliet, directed by Festival actor Quinn Mattfeld.\n\nAdditional Festival actors Michael Doherty, Melinda Parrett, and Rhett Guter brought laughter and magicââliterallyââto the night, with Mattfeld, Doherty, and Parrett onstage, and Guter performing magic tricks throughout the evening.Â\n\nUtah State University actress Mia Gatherum also hit the stage, and with Mattfeld, the duo played Juliet and Romeo.Â\n\nâQuinn, my team, and I knew that an evening of laughter, food, and fun would be the perfect kick-off to the upcoming 2023 season,â said Director of Development and Communications Donn Jersey. âWe really had a great time putting it all together.â\n\nDevelopment Associate Emily Cacho noted that the event was filled with friends and supporters, both old and new.Â\n\nâWe had a fantastic turnout, with around 200 people in attendance,â Cacho said. âWe had many new fans of the Utah Shakespeare Festival in attendance as well as many tried-and-true patrons of our organization. Overall I would say we had a very successful event!â\n\nAdditionally, over $60,000 was raised at the event to support the Festivalâs endeavors.\n\nâThere were many special guests in attendance, including Utah state legislatures and civic leaders, as well as our friends from Pathway and Associates,â Cacho said.Â\n\nInterim Artistic Director/Director of New Play Development Derek Charles Livingston seconded Cachoâs remarks, calling the event a âterrific and fun-filled evening.âÂ\n\nHe also expressed his gratitude to the supporters and performers who made the evening possible.Â\n\nâWe are so fortunate to have such wonderful supporters who will âplayâ along with us, and such a great family of actors to make a whole evening come alive,â Livingston said.Â\n\nUltimately, the evening represented what the Festival stands for: âThis whole event was an example of what makes the Festival a special organization – the spirit, the storytelling, the camaraderie,Â the magic.â"
