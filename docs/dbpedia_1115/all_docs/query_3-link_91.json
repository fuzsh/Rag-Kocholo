        "text": "2015 has been a watershed year for female musical theatre creators. For the first time in history, an all-women creative team won the Tony Award for Best Original Score in a Musical (Jeanine Tesori and Lisa Kron for their musical, Fun Home). Three female composers also had shows open on Broadway during the same season (Jeanine Tesori, Lucy Simon, and Barbara Anselmi). Although two of those musicals have since closed, the recent Broadway revival of The Color Purple ensures that multiple female songwriters will be represented on The Great White Way during the remainder of this year and beyond.\n\nTo celebrate this momentous occasion, I would like to shine a spotlight on twenty-five influential female composers and lyricists in musical theatre today (among others). I feel that some of the songwriters below do not receive the credit they deserve for the important artistic contributions they have made to musical theatre in recent years. I hope this post helps to remedy that situation somewhat. I have provided video examples of their songwriting work to view at your leisure as well. NOTE: The list below is only a sampling of the MANY wonderful women songwriters working in musical theatre today. It is NOT comprehensive or exhaustive in scope. Thank you to those who have contacted me with other fabulous songwriter recommendations. If you are researching female contemporary musical theatre writers, please continue to look beyond this blog post as well (there are many other amazing songwriters out there!).\n\nP.S.
