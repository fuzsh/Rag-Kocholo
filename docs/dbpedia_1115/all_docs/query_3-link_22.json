A friend recommended a book to me, saying, “I think this would make a great piece for you.” As someone with a learning disability, it took me quite some time to finally sit down and read the short story. However, once I did, I was immediately captivated by Dawn Powell’s prose and her detailed characterizations. The words seemed to grab hold of me, and I couldn’t put it down.\n\nAdapting Powell’s words, I found that though Morry is the book's protagonist, my heart was drawn to Elsinore. Her story resonated with me, pushing me to tell it through dance—our shared escape from reality. I brought together a team to help develop the piece, but like Elsinore, I lost my voice and struggled to find the right way to present our journey. As time passed and the license to develop the piece expired, our team dispersed, and it was just Elsinore and I left alone.\n\nJump ahead to the pandemic when the world as we knew it suddenly stopped. Despite my aversion to ever experiencing a pandemic again, I am grateful for the opportunity it provided me. With everything closed and on pause, I was able to finally complete my undergraduate degree and even pursue an MBA. During this period, I worked on an independent study project with a supportive professor who helped foster my writing skills. I revisited DANCE NIGHT and structured it in the way I had always envisioned, finding inspiration in my talented friend Kim Sava. I obtained the rights to Dawn Powell's book and began to weave my story with hers. Lamptown Ohio became my hometown of Waltham Massechustes, the characters became a reflection of myself and my community, and everything seemed to fall perfectly into place once again.\n\nAccompanied by Zev Burrows' enchanting and exquisite music, DANCE NIGHT has become the tale that I yearn to share. Each person has a history, aspirations, and moments where they wish to break free from someone or something. Stay true to your journey, stand firm on your beliefs, and narrate the story of YOUR life as you desire. Sit back and relish in the experience of DANCE NIGHT.\n\nDaring to Dream\n\n(Funded by the Pabst Steinmetz Arts and Wellness Foundation)\n\nFacilitators: Sage Tokach, Christian Anderson, Caroline Cutillo*\n\nCommunity Consultants: Isabelle Aviles, Elyse Mundelein\n\nGuest facilitators: David Matteson, William Tayek\n\nDramaturg: Vidal Treadwell*\n\nMusician: Ralph Krumins\n\nProduction Stage Manager: Elizabeth McDermott*\n\nStage Managers: Vivianette Rivera-Rodriguez*, Jaz Griffiths*\n\nRecruitment: Gabriella Headley*\n\n*Theatre UCF student\n\nFACULTY ADVISORS\n\n(IDD Consultants and Pabst Steinmetz Grant Facilitators)\n\nKaileigh Anne Tayek: Director of the School of Arts and Health\n\nAshley Lewis: CFCArts Music Therapy Clinical Program Manager\n\nKeri Watson: UCF School of Visual Arts and Design\n\nMissy Glavey: Independent Inclusive Education Consultant\n\n*Theatre UCF student\n\nCAST\n\nIsabelle Aviles\n\nRiver Banks*\n\nCaroline Cutillo*\n\nMatthew Gennell*\n\nCaroline Hull*\n\nJustin Isaac\n\nAidan Leary*\n\nKirby Lee*\n\nSophia Mazo\n\nNick McGrew\n\nElyse Mundelein\n\nMackenzie Wood\n\n*Theatre UCF student\n\nDESIGN TEAM\n\nDesign & Technology Advisor: Vandy Wood\n\nLighting: Sevannah Clarington*\n\nScenery: Nicholas Salerno* & Baeta Mischker*\n\nSHOW CREW\n\nSamantha Tobares*, Max Benmoha*, Genevieve Holman*\n\nSHOP CREWS\n\nScene Shop Crew: Shannon Daly*, Ryan Devane*, Baeta Mischker*, Nicholas Salerno*, Ashlyn Witterschein*, Reese Doman*, Paul Rodriguez*\n\nProps: Griffin Greene*\n\nElectrics Shop: Sevannah Clarington*, Taylor Falzarano*, Delta Russell*, Sam Mustaine*, Thomas Blair*, Veronica Rosalis*\n\nSound Shop: Tabby Dennis*, Shelby Rice*\n\nCostume Shop: Foster Elkins*, Sabrina Rizzo*, Nia Jenkins*, Dennis Davis\n\nFRONT OF HOUSE/BOX OFFICE\n\nEmily Duncanson*, Helen Sanford*, Gabriela Astwood*, Max Mitchell*, Paige Wallace*, Amber Wheeler*\n\nPEGASUS PLAYLAB/Theatre UCF\n\nArtistic Director: Julia Listengarten\n\nDesign and Technology Advisor: Vandy Wood\n\nStage Manager Advisor: Claudia Lynch\n\nProduction Manager: James Cleveland\n\nProduction Sound/Design Advisor: Olivia Deiter\n\nProduction Electrician: Beth McAshan\n\nCostume Shop Manager: Allison Rexrode\n\nCostume Shop Workroom Supervisor: Amanda Roberts\n\nTechnical Director: Tramaine Berryhill\n\nAssistant Technical Director: Kristen Garza\n\nArtistic Associate / Company Manager: Leigh Green*\n\nMarketing Communications Manager: McKenzie Lakey\n\nMarketing Coordinator: Jessica Compton\n\nFOH/ Box Office Manager: Imari Point-du-Jour\n\n* Theatre UCF student\n\nCast Bios\n\nIsabelle Aviles is a part of Best Buddies and an alumnus of UCF.

Maybe we played pretend with siblings or friends, or doodled them out in pieces of paper to turn in to our teacher or share with our classes. Back then, it felt like anything was possible. As we grew older, however, we realized that many of our fantastical dreams simply can’t happen. We can’t be a princess living in a castle or a superhero fighting evil—we got the burdens of adulthood we need to worry about, and we end up looking back on our childhoods with nostalgia—yearning for the innocence and imagination we once had.\n\nOur devised piece, Daring to Dream, returns adults back to that world of dreams, filled with infinite possibilities. Funded by the Pabst Steinmetz Foundation, the script was entirely conceived by students with and without disabilities. Over the span of fifteen days, they shared their dreams and nightmares with each other, represented them via movement pieces, and crafted surrealist art that appears as characters and worlds within our story. As a result, they collectively grew as artists, actors, and dreamers.\n\nAs you watch the show, we want you to embrace your childhood dreams once again, no matter how abstract or fictional they are. Follow our characters into the dream world and let your imagination go wild. And as our characters grow in their dreams and unite as a community, we ask that you join them, and relish in the comfort and freedom our own dreams give us.\n\nDesert Oceans\n\nPlaywright: John Mabey\n\nDirector: Nick Bazo\n\nAssistant Director: Lindsay Goldman*\n\nDramaturg: Lilly Yandell*\n\nProduction Stage Manager: Mary McDermott*\n\nStage Managers: Taylor Appleford* , Hannah Silverstein*\n\n*Theatre UCF student\n\nCAST\n\nJOSE: Esteban Mayorga*\n\nWILLIAM: Wyatt Hubbard*\n\nSISTER PHILOMENA: Charlie Vega-Franz*\n\nYVONNE: Rachel Burnes*\n\nU/S JOSE: Luis Montalvo*\n\nU/S WILLIAM: Jake Haugland*\n\n*Theatre UCF student\n\nDESIGN TEAM\n\nDesign and Technology Advisor: Vandy Wood\n\nLighting: Sam Mustaine *\n\nSound: Shelby Rice*\n\nScenic: Shannon Daly*\n\nCostumes: Sabrina Rizzo*\n\nSHOW CREW\n\nMax Benmoha*, Samantha Tobares*, Genevieve Holman*\n\nSHOP CREWS\n\nScene Shop Crew: Shannon Daly*, Ryan Devane*, Baeta Mischker*, Nicholas Salerno*, Ashlyn Witterschein*, Reese Doman*, Paul Rodriguez*\n\nProps: Griffin Greene*\n\nElectrics Shop: Sevannah Clarington*, Taylor Falzarano*, Delta Russell*, Sam Mustaine*\n\nSound Shop: Tabby Dennis*, Shelby Rice*, Thomas Blair*, Veronica Rosalis*\n\nCostume Shop: Foster Elkins*, Sabrina Rizzo*, Nia Jenkins*, Dennis Davis*\n\nFRONT OF HOUSE/BOX OFFICE\n\nEmily Duncanson*, Helen Sanford*, Gabriela Astwood*, Max Mitchell*, Paige Wallace*, Amber Wheeler*\n\nPEGASUS PLAYLAB/Theatre UCF\n\nArtistic Director: Julia Listengarten\n\nDesign and Technology Advisor: Vandy Wood\n\nStage Manager Advisor: Claudia Lynch\n\nProduction Manager: James Cleveland\n\nProduction Sound/Design Advisor: Olivia Deiter\n\nProduction Electrician: Beth McAshan\n\nCostume Shop Manager: Allison Rexrode\n\nCostume Shop Workroom Supervisor: Amanda Roberts\n\nTechnical Director: Tramaine Berryhill\n\nAssistant Technical Director: Kristen Garza\n\nArtistic Associate / Company Manager: Leigh Green*\n\nMarketing Communications Manager: McKenzie Lakey\n\nMarketing Coordinator: Jessica Compton\n\nFOH/ Box Office Manager: Imari Point-du-Jour\n\n*Theatre UCF student\n\nCast Bios\n\nWyatt Hubbard (William) is a second year transfer student in the B.A. Theatre Studies program.

My nana gifted me this relic because she knows I collect memories like they’re priceless artifacts. And they are. Inside the mysterious box was a treasure trove of writings from my sister - no longer alive but still speaking through the stories and poetry she wrote in Spanish and English. I used some of her words to create the poem at the start of this play, like puzzle pieces coming together for a picture not completely in focus. Or maybe the pieces just didn’t connect at all. Either way, blending her words with mine was a way of writing something ‘with’ her across time. And when I was ready, these lines of poetry became the guides for each scene in Desert Oceans, bringing the overall picture of the play into focus.\n\nFrom there, I drew on inspirations from my own life as well as family artifacts dating back to my papa’s immigration to this country. Moments in this play thread back to these treasures, forming a tapestry that’s full of beautiful contradictions – smooth & sharp, happy & sad, light & dark – all at the same time. I write a lot about queer joy, and that also feels like a beautiful contradiction in the world sometimes - but queer joy is always there if you know where to look. The characters in this play are on a similar journey. And through them, I’ve realized that the puzzle pieces that never seem to fit, just might belong to a different box altogether. I hope some pieces from this play also find their way to connect with you, just waiting to be discovered.\n\n---------------------------\n\nThe Trevor Project: suicide prevention and crisis intervention for LGBTQ+ youth\n\nCall 1-866-488-7386\n\nText ‘start’ to 678-678\n\nSuicide & Crisis lifeline\n\nCall 988\n\nText 988\n\nDramaturg's Note\n\nIn John Mabey’s Desert Oceans, Mabey explores a world of opposites. Throughout the play, audiences find that things in opposition often come together to create something new. Being brave and afraid are tied together like a knot, while hellos and goodbyes often look the same. Grief and community come together to create hope, and one can find strength in religion and sexuality.\n\nMany LGBT+ community members feel rejection and hate from religion. Lack of support from the church often leads to dismissal of religion entirely. In Desert Oceans, Mabey subverts this expectation. These characters find solace and connection through faith, despite their struggles. Religion is not something to be feared, but something to be cherished.\n\nAs you watch, pay attention to the opposing forces. One might find connections that bond these characters and story together.\n\nWhat’s in Store\n\nPlaywright: Kate Brennan\n\nDirector: Rebekah Lane\n\nProduction Stage Manager: Caiden Talbert*\n\nLighting, Scenic, & Projections Designer: Vandy Wood\n\nSound Designer: Kaitlyn Gill*\n\nCostume Designer: Nia Jenkins*\n\n*Theatre UCF student\n\nCAST\n\nJAYCEE: Alayna Ruggiero*\n\nMAVIS: Faith Alfieri*\n\nGERI: Dominique Marshall*\n\nJEANINE, BROKER: Kaitlyn Loughran*\n\nWES: Anthony Geluso*\n\nLOUDSPEAKER, U/S JAYCEE, U/S TALIA, U/S GERI: Sarah Bathelemy*\n\nTALIA, LOUDSPEAKER, U/S MAVIS, U/S JEANINE: Dafne Cardena*\n\nU/S WES, LOUDSPEAKER: Christopher Poulios*\n\n*Theatre UCF student\n\nPRODUCTION TEAM\n\nStage Managers: CJ Gray*, Savanah Schaller*\n\nDramaturg: Chanel Gomaa*\n\nProps Manager: Griffin Greene*\n\nAssistant Scenic Designer: Max Camacho*\n\nAssistant Lighting Designer: Taylor Falzarano*\n\nLight Board Operator: Lila McMorris*\n\nQLab Operator: Tabytha Dennis\n\nWardrobe Supervisor: Bella Llanes*\n\nWardrobe/Deck Crew: Elizabeth McDermott*, Vivi Rivera-Rodriguez*, Jaz Griffiths*\n\nDeck Crew: Jacob Willson*, Owen Tavares*, Ethan Cabral*\n\nSHOP CREWS\n\nScene Shop Crew: Shannon Daly*, Ryan Devane*, Baeta Mischker*, Nicholas Salerno*, Ashlyn Witterschein*, Reese Doman*, Paul Rodriguez*\n\nProps: Griffin Greene*\n\nElectrics Shop: Sevannah Clarington*, Taylor Falzarano*, Delta Russell*, Sam Mustaine*, Thomas Blair*, Veronica Rosalis*\n\nSound Shop: Tabby Dennis*, Shelby Rice*\n\nCostume Shop: Foster Elkins*, Sabrina Rizzo*, Nia Jenkins*, Dennis Davis*\n\nFRONT OF HOUSE/BOX OFFICE\n\nEmily Duncanson*, Helen Sanford*, Gabriela Astwood*, Max Mitchell*, Paige Wallace*, Amber Wheeler*\n\nPEGASUS PLAYLAB/Theatre UCF\n\nArtistic Director: Julia Listengarten\n\nDesign and Technology Advisor: Vandy Wood\n\nStage Manager Advisor: Claudia Lynch\n\nProduction Manager: James Cleveland\n\nProduction Sound/Design Advisor: Olivia Deiter\n\nProduction Electrician: Beth McAshan\n\nCostume Shop Manager: Allison Rexrode\n\nCostume Shop Workroom Supervisor: Amanda Roberts\n\nTechnical Director: Tramaine Berryhill\n\nAssistant Technical Director: Kristen Garza\n\nArtistic Associate / Company Manager: Leigh Green*\n\nMarketing Communications Manager: McKenzie Lakey\n\nMarketing Coordinator: Jessica Compton\n\nFOH/ Box Office Manager: Imari Point-du-Jour\n\n*Theatre UCF student\n\nCAST BIOS\n\nFaith Alfieri (Mavis) is a rising third-year student in the BFA Musical Theatre program.

What’s is Store was born of a moment of frustration when — you might have guessed it — I was apartment hunting. Writing provides an opportunity to process the chaos and absurdity and overwhelm in life. The act synthesizes, organizes, and uncovers thoughts and feelings I didn’t realize I had. But playwriting is not an independent endeavor. Even as a solo writer, it is an act of collaboration with the cast, the creative team, the spectator.\n\nThe development of a new piece is a strange unwieldy journey. It’s an abridged nomadic lifetime, gathering companions as you go, exchanging what you can in your few precious moments together, and then allowing you and your work to be changed by the brief encounter. It’s a lesson in creating a life.\n\nWhat’s in Store has been developed by five ensembles— in Colorado, Oklahoma, New Jersey, California and now, Florida. Quite a spread. Various themes emerged in different areas of the country. Various themes emerged as I evolved in my own life. This is to say that creating a play takes time, it takes investment, it takes a lot of strangers who are willing to show up and show up again, and dedicate their time and expertise and problem-solving and patience and fortitude and willingness and care to a single baby project. In a way, it is a microcosm for building a world, and hopefully a better one.\n\nThis is why organizations like Pegasus Play Lab are so integral to the future of the American Theatre. If we truly want to create a more thoughtful, more inclusive, more representative canon — if we truly want to foster new voices, different perspectives and innovative storytelling, it requires all of us. Because we are all participants in the world we create. And I think the question I am always after is: how, even in the most challenging of times, can we make it better?\n\nDIRECTOR'S NOTE\n\nThe idea of community is prescient right now. The world is in flux. Inflation is making the classic American individualism difficult to maintain. Rising rates of depression and anxiety have been correlated with hours spent on social media platforms - these digital spaces that connect us through screens rather than physical proximity. We are working harder than ever, but we are missing social support and belonging.\n\nIn her book Belonging: A culture of place, scholar and activist bell hooks writes, “Searching for a place to belong I make a list of what I will need to create firm ground. At the top of the list I write: ‘I need to live where I can walk. I need to be able to walk to work, to the store, to a place where I can sit and drink tea and fellowship. Walking, I will establish my presence as one who is claiming the earth, creating a sense of belonging, a culture of place.’”\n\nWhat’s in Store gives us a peek into what it might be like if these concepts of walking to work and fellowship were contained, idyllically, under one roof. As the show progresses, we see Jaycee, Mavis, and Geri create community and create their own \"culture of place.\" In true capitalist fashion, this magical place is found within a stylish furniture store.\n\nIn alignment with the premise of stylish furniture stores, in the 2022 “Life at Home Report” by Ikea, Ikea shares research indicating that an ideal home is \"a place where we can cast off our shoes, wipe the stresses from our minds and zero in on the things that bring us joy and satisfaction.” Playwright Kate Brennan frames DuKTiG as just such a haven, and likens it to OZ - a microcosm for an ideal community. Her main character, Jaycee, initiates a slide into this utopia and draws the rest of us into her reality. Unlike fairy tales, there is no witch or Big Bad Wolf at the end of her journey. In the style of current shows like Ted Lasso, our characters choose to seek grounding over conflict.\n\nBrennan’s script invites us to imagine the framework presented as a true alternative to the frameworks that currently dictate our lives.\n\nDramaturg's Note\n\nKate Brennan has referred to her play What’s in Store as “a love letter to humanity.” Her characters come together from different backgrounds with lived experiences that leave them searching for connection in each other through the comfort of the cozy corner of the world they’ve curated in the DuKTiG furniture store. In rehearsals together we leaned into the Swedish practice of lagom, meaning “everything in moderation.” This refers to work, responsibilities, and every day commitments as it does to pleasure and play. Engaging in lagom invites us to invest in building community connections that are unconditional and reciprocated through mutual respect and love. We built a community like this in the rehearsal space, and made efforts to uplift the Orlando community as well by providing information in the lobby to you about how to reach out to organizations and groups that may inspire you to find community like the characters in What’s in Store? do. Thank you for joining us and our community at DuKTiG, we wish you joy and inspiration as you find your cozy corner of the world outside the theatre walls."
