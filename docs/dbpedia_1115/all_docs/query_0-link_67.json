        "text": "Winner of five Tony Awards, including Best Book and Best Original Score, The Drowsy Chaperone is a loving send-up of the Jazz Age musical, featuring one show-stopping song and dance number after another. With the houselights down, a man in a chair appears on stage and puts on his favorite record: the cast recording of a fictitious 1928 musical. The recording comes to life in his living room and The Drowsy Chaperone begins as the man in the chair looks on and provides witty commentary. Mix in two lovers on the eve of their wedding, a bumbling best man, a desperate theatre producer, a not-so-bright hostess, two gangsters posing as pastry chefs, a misguided Don Juan and an intoxicated chaperone, and you have the ingredients for an evening of madcap delight!\n\nRunning Time: 1 hour and 40 minutes with no intermission\n\nSuggested Ages â€“ Recommended for ages 10 and up. The show contains adult language and mature themes."
