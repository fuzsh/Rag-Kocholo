        "text": "Philip Roth’s fearlessly filthy, funny and moving novel takes the stage in this new play from Ariel Levy and John Turturro.\n\nWhen his secret life of debauchery comes to a heartbreaking end, disgraced puppet maker Mickey Sabbath plunges into increasingly mad and maddening encounters with people from his wild and wicked past. Part ghost story, part love story, Sabbath’s Theater unleashes Roth’s power to shock and amaze in this profound meditation on mortality and juicy celebration of life.\n\nPublished in 1995, Sabbath’s Theater won that year’s National Book Award and was a finalist for the 1996 Pulitzer Prize.\n\nFOLCS and The New Group came together to present a special discounted performance of Sabbath’s Theater, followed by a live conversation with two thirds of the cast: John Turturro and Jason Kravits.\n\nWatch the Conversation on demand now."
