        "text": "A man, a bit lonely and weary of the modern world, beats the blues by dropping the needle on his favorite vinyl recording, a 1928 smash hit musical, The Drowsy Chaperone. Its star, Janet Van De Graaff, steps into his living room with her handsome fiance, her tipsy chaperone, her producer, an aviatrix, and two gangsters disguised as chefs and they play out a twisted plot employing a shameless raft of theatrical devices including mistaken identity, spit takes, tap dancing, show-stoppers, flagrant upstaging, and rousing anthems. A homage to the Broadway musical, The Drowsy Chaperone won 4 Drama Desk and 5 Tony Awards in 2006, including Best Book and Best Original Score."
