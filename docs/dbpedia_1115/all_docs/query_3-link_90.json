        "text": "‘This Town’ Is In Our Town, Just Not Where We Live\n\nGary Tischler •\n\n“This Town,” subtitled “Two Parties and a Funeral—Plus Plenty of Valet Parking!—in America’s Gilded Capital,” is a book about Washington, D.C., by Mark Leibovich, chief national correspondent for the New York Times Magazine.\n\nIt’s not necessarily about where you and I live, nor is it about neighborhoods, Vincent Gray, Jack Evans or even Marion Barry, nor is it about Jim Vance or Doreen Genzler or Mark Plotkin, or even Bryce Harper or RGIII, or the Ambassador from Mexico, or the Whitman Walker Clinic or Arena Stage. It’s not about Adams Morgan, or even Georgetown, although Georgetown parties, and social and political folks make appearances, along with some restaurants and hostesses, but not the pandas at the zoo, although there are times when “This Time” resembles a zoo.\n\nIt’s not about this town, but about “This Town,” the one that seems to exist a little like the town under the dome in the TV show, whose citizens have been rendered invisible to the rest of the country.\n\nNever have you seen a book which has managed to put so much truth in advertising on its outside front and back covers. The front cover of “This Town” (published by blue rider press—their lower case, not mine), has a high-contrast, half-head, color portrait of what is clearly a denizen of This Town, a politician/lobbyist, easily identified as such by his red tie, half a big smile, dark suit, double-flag pin on one lapel, a thousand-dollar bill in his left pocket. The Capitol dome and muted night-time noir lights are behind him.\n\nThe back cover, illustrated by Ben Franklins floating from top to bottom, features a mission statement and a warning: “Today’s insider Washington has become a sprawling ‘conversation’ in which tens of thousands partake by tweet, blog, or whatever…The Washington story has become something more momentous, benefitting a ‘narrative’: a pumped-up word in a pumped-up place where everything is changing, maybe more than in any city in the country …or maybe nothing is changing at all, and the only certainty is that the city fathers of This Town will endure like perennials in a well-tended cemetery.”\n\nHere’s the warning: “ ‘This Town’ does not contain an index. Those players wishing to know how they came out will need to read the book.”\n\nFair enough. I read the book all the way through, not surprised not to find my name in it, or that of many of my friends, associates and neighbors. Not surprisingly, since I work for this newspaper in a number of capacities, there were quite a few persons in the book whom I actually knew, or had seen in passing, or occupied the same room with (the Kennedy Center Opera House is a really big place), or had words with, or, or seen at a party or reception, on occasion, interviewed, or had seen on television. Memory in “This Town” plays tricks—one minute you’re absolutely positive you saw that Nixon-era attorney general walking his dog in Georgetown, the next time he’s in a Watergate documentary.\n\nFor the record, I have never met or talked with Mark Leibovitch, although I do read the New York Times Magazine occasionally, and the Washington Post every day (still), a paper for which he also worked. Leibovitch is not much interested in ancient John Mitchell-like history—he’s interested in now, right now, or how we got to right now. He is, it should be added, a terrific writer and reporter—his observations are sharp, funny, even touching, as he rolls out his characters, his scenes of parties and funerals (as well as political parties from Dems to GOP to Tea).\n\nThis is “This Town” that all the persons who’ve only visited here in horrible summers like this one complain about—this is Oedipus town, where incest of a non-physical kind is practiced as routinely as a Friday night poker game with beer and pizza is at a street corner or your friend’s house. One of Leibovitch’s principal revelations—that “This Town” rolls—like many towns only more so—on money is a theme, if not a shock. He documents, with style and even with some affection–the well-traveled journey—from Lott to Dodd and congressmen and senators in between—from holding office and public service to your friendly neighborhood lobby shop. Most politicians roll into town after having vowed to throw out the scoundrels (lobbyists and other hangers-on, some of them now strategists and consultants). It would appear that while assailing the Washington scoundrels and money men, they kept their business cards.\n\nThat part is hardly a revelation—it’s the merry-go-around of power types that includes members of the media, elected officials, their aides and chiefs of staff, the new media class of bloggers, twitterers, websites and Politico that is in some way as awe-inspiring as a second-tier royal wedding. Everyone—it seems—in “This Town” not only knows, works with at some time or another, socializes with, parties with and writes and blogs about each other, they’re practically sharing pads. Or as reporter noted—in a collection of comments from reporters who were mentioned in this book—if things got any more incestuous, their children would start having birth defects.\n\nLeibovitch goes back to this theme—senators get elected, leave office and join a lobbying firm after vowing not to ever, ever do that, media types get tips from political aides wanting to get famous and so on time and time again. But in between, he offers choice vignettes and portraits—the scene at Ted Kennedy’s funeral, or the Kennedy Center memorial for “Meet the Press” wonder Tim Russert whom Leibovitch names the mayor of “This Town.” Russert’s shocking death and the service gives a graphic, at times moving, at times bewildering and head-scratching example of what happens when the citizens of this town gather to mourn—and kibitz.\n\nThe author gives a spot-on and up-to-the-second portrait of the new media as personified by Mike Allen and Politico — and especially Allen’s dot-dot daily reporting, in which he manages to capture the next second while pitching birthday, wedding, promotion and baby congrats.\n\nThe book is immensely readable. It’s gossipy, sure, but it’s also, one assumes, accurate in its snapshots of people. This is inside under the dome stuff, the parties—most of them seemingly thrown by the uber-hostess Tammy Haddad, whose brunches and parties during the week of the White House Correspondents Association Dinner is the top ticket in town.\n\nWhen he’s not pursuing the career curves of politicians pursuing jobs, Leibovitch gives us some magnetic portraits of the likes of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., not usually seen in a non-partisan way.\n\nIn one chapter—dubbed “Suck Up City”—we see that the insiders may be competing, fighting, sniping and so on in a kind of rubber knife combat, but they’re always striving, branding and, well, sucking up.\n\nLeibovitch’s portraits in “This Town” are hardly flattering. He may have some concerns about backlash, socially and accessibility-wise, but we doubt it. As he admits he’s very much an insider reporting on insiders, but it’s not like he’s Truman Capote. While a lot of what he serves up surprises—some of us actually don’t know that the Clintons and the late Tim Russert despised each other. Taken as a whole, however, the existence of “This Town” hardly surprises.\n\nEveryone who lives here long enough, even on the periphery, experiences the little neighborhoods of “This Town”, those little drug-like rushes of being in the presence of power or name-droppers. But Leibovitch, on the whole, ignores the whole town in which “This Town” exists, except for a quick and undeservingly tiny passing reference. There is, after all, a context to “This Town”.\n\nFittingly, the book is pretty up to the moment, and moves fast like the kind of mystery thriller that I like to read. But we—and he—know the ending already. It’s going happen in 60 seconds, in Allen’s next Playbook which is appearing: right now in “This Town.”\n\nLou Reed: Pervasive Rock Pioneer\n\nGary Tischler •\n\nLou Reed—who, it was said in an American Masters PBS special, brought rock and roll to the avant garde or is it the other way around—died just a few days before Halloween. Means nothing, but I hope somebody at some party puts on his lean, gaunt, hollow-eyed mask of a face, grabs a guitar and plays more than a few riffs of “Baby Jane,” or like a pied piper heads out into the night and the wild side, doo do doo, doo do doo, doo do doo.”\n\nReed, the Brooklyn native and world citizen of the wild side—as in “Take a Walk on the Wild Side”—and the Velvet Underground are in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. There are a thousand reasons, because his name and music bounces around like a pinball wizard in all the tell-tale hearts of rockers and rockers as somewhat mad poets and rockers as intellectuals. He’s a legend in his own time, mind and New York, if not Graceland. He—and the Velvet Underground, the strange rock-out but dark, and darker group he led with violinist John Cale—wasn’t your typical rock and roll god, he was more like Loki than Thor.\n\nAccording to the Rolling Stone obituary, Reed once said that his entire career, taken together amounts to a kind great American novel. Don’t know about that—”Moby Dick” is the big fish for me—but maybe it’s the Reed life and work that should be the subject of a great American novel, or e-book at least. So, get to it, somebody, before things get waylaid, misquoted and forgotten.\n\nThe Washington Post obit dubbed him “The Velvet Underground Visionary.” While that is true, I think he was more than that. Everywhere you look in the nooks and crannies of rock and roll, the New York art scene, in the generals of the defiant punkers, the glams (hello, David Bowie), you find a piece of Reed, and another stroll on the wild side. But it’s true—the Velvet Underground, discordant and full of not just musical discord, was rich in talent, vision, rock lyrics that went where no one had dared to go, but could also scare the beejesus out of you while breaking your heart, or in “Baby Jane’s” case, make you dance until you died.\n\nEverybody—outside of Dylan—owed something to Reed: David Byrne, David Bowie, the alt rockers, garage rockers, the big boys in the arena, the little ones in every aspiring 9:30 club joint, the New York too cool kids out all night, and not a few real poets.\n\nWhat Reed was was a writer of songs, and singing them, he seemed to be a sleep walker, creating in a dream. Go online now and roll through his fugues and songs, and his “Perfect Day” and “Heroin,” the latter approached with caution. Small wonder, his college English professor at Syracuse University was Delmore Schwartz, who was neither easy nor happy-go-lucky, but lyrical as an unpredictable cloud, and in the end, died too young.\n\nHe met if not his equal certainly somebody simpatico in Andy Warhol, the two of them could pass for brothers, a different shade of pale. Velvet Underground, which was preceded by pitch-black groups called the Warlocks and the Primitives, rehearsed rehearsed at Warhold’s factory and recorded sometimes with Warholish singer Nico, all strange and blank.\n\n“Baby Jane” and “Rock and Roll” marked a turn: these songs, if you listen to them, reveal rock-and-roll.\n\nReed’s second wife was Laurie Anderson, herself a sharp rebel and pioneer of new music. Not surprisingly, perhaps, in 2002, he recorded an album centered around the works of Edgar Allan Poe. He also collaborated with Metallica.\n\nReed had a self-admitted major problem with alcohol, which may or may not have been punctuated by waltzes with heroin. He had had a liver transplant. He was 71 when he died Oct. 27.\n\nIn “Sweet Jane,” he sings, “Standing on the corner,/suitcase in my hand/Jack is in his corset, and Jane is hervets/and me/I’m in a rock’n’roll band/Hah!”\n\n“Hah!” Indeed, Mr. Reed.\n\nNew Plays Show Washington’s Fresh Take on Theater\n\nGary Tischler •\n\nNew plays, are nothing new on the Washington theater scene, but what is just a little new is that this year, there’s an abundance of new plays from which theatergoers can choose. And what’s more, in some very companies, they’re the jump starters for their season.\n\nThat’s to be expected from, say, Woolly Mammoth, whose whole history and existence, and reason for being for decades now has been centered around new work. Many theaters encourage new plays, promote them and provide a home and possible production site for new playwrights. That’s been the case for Arena Stage, whose first two productions are plays that are either made from scratch or have never been seen in Washington.\n\nWe had occasion to chat with three playwrights, whose work were part of the early Washington Theater Scene.\n\nCharles Randolph-Wright’s new play “Love in Afghanistan” is currently running at Arena Stage in the Arlene and Robert Kogod Cradle through Nov. 17. Eric Coble’s two-character play “The Velocity of Autumn”, starring Estelle Parsons, is finishing its run in the Kreeger at Arena Stage Oct. 20. And Lisa D’Amour’s remarkable (and remarkably staged by Director John Vreeke) play about the dying of suburbia finished a successful run at Woolly Mammoth October 6\n\nCharles Randolph-Wright and “Love in Afghanistan”\n\nCharles Randolph Wright is hardly a new playwright, or a new presence in Washington, or a new guy at Arena Stage. This is the man who is directing “Motown: The Musical,” the smash hit musical, on Broadway, who has helmed a number of productions at Arena Stage, including, notably, “Sophisticated Ladies” at the Lincoln Theater, a production of “Guys and Dolls” at Arena, and “Senor Discretion Himself,” the last musical written by Frank Loesser before his death in 1969. Recently, he directed Arena’s production of Lynn Nottage’s Pulitzer Prize-winning “Ruined.” At ACT in San Francisco, he directed a musical version of Athol Fugard’s “Blood Knot” with music by Tracy Chapman. As a playwright, he wrote the acclaimed “Blue,” which was produced at Arena Stage, and starred Phylicia Rashad.\n\nNot only that, but just for another interesting credit, he was an original cast member of “Dream Girls” on Broadway. Yet, even for the wide-ranging Randolph-Wright, “Love in Afghanistan” is a departure, something brand new.\n\nFor him, it’s almost an exclamation point to the projects he’s worked on at Arena: “Molly Smith has always encouraged me, provided an arena for exploration, for searching in her own desire to focus on American plays. But even so, this play is different, for me, because it was about a collision of cultures, and I had never been to Afghanistan, so in many ways, I had to imagine the setting.”\n\n“Basically, Molly said I want to do your next play, which is huge. There have been no limits on what I can try or do, as director, and now as resident playwright.”\n\nRandolph-Wright said the play was sparked by as story he had read about Afghanistan, the family practice of bacha posh in which girls are forced to dress and be like boys in order for them to work. “You have to wonder what that does to a girl, to people,” he said. “That’s where it started for me, and I talked to a lot of people from Afghanistan who had been there, and in a way the country came to me, in a kind of total inspiration.\n\nThe result is “Love in Afghanistan,” a play in which a young America hip hop star encounters a young interpreter named Roya on a visit to Afghanistan. Melis Aker plays Roya and Khris Davis plays Duke. “It’s a kind of Romeo and Juliet, sure, but it’s also about a clash of cultures and the effects of the American presence in that country and the impact of what happens when we leave.”\n\nEric Coble and “The Velocity of Autumn”\n\nCoble has written—and is writing—a lot, although “The Velocity of Autumn” marks his Arena debut. He has been in numerous festivals, and produced a volume of work that’s interesting for its variety, diversity. He writes plays for young people including an adaptation of the popular novel “The Giver,” a standard in many middle school curriculums.\n\n“I’ve had a pretty unusual background,” Coble said. Somehow, this native of Scotland who was raised on the Navajo and Ute reservations in New Mexico and Colorado, ended up in Cleveland, where he’s happily ensconced as a part of the Playwrights Unit of the Cleveland Play House. “The Velocity of Autumn” was originally scheduled to open on Broadway, but instead opened the Arena season, starring Estelle Parsons and Stephen Spinella in remarkable performances.\n\nCoble is obviously one of those people who pays attention to his surroundings. “I was walking past a neighbor’s house , it was a woman named Lottie, she was living alone and it was obvious she was having a hard time taking care of herself . . . and that’s where it started.”\n\nThe result was “Autumn” and the tale of a widow who is trying to avoid living in a retirement or assisted living home by staying in her house and who has barricaded herself inside in rooms filled with Molotov cocktails. A wayward son tries to talk her out of it, as they re-unite after years of not seeing each other.\n\nWith Parsons and Spinella, this material has been turned into a witty, funny, moving and powerful play about how we live, age, and prepare for the dying of the light in America.\n\nLisa D’Amour and “Detroit”\n\n“Detroit”—a Pulitzer Prize finalist—had a remarkable run and a remarkable production at the Woolly Mammoth Theatre, Sept. 9 to Oct. 6. It was a play that dealt with a lot of issues, the least of which was probably the city of Detroit proper. It focused, rather on the decaying fringes of suburbia and two sets of couples living under one extreme or another—emotional and economical—in an America full of stressful squeezes and disconnections.\n\nThe play itself had two productions before coming to Woolly—at the Steppenwolf Theatre in Chicago with a cast that included Laurie Metcalf and off-Broadway last year with a cast that included David Schwimmer and Amy Ryan. The Washington production had riveting performances by Gabriela Fernandez-Coffey, Danny Gavigan, Tim Getman and Emily K. Towley\n\n“It’s not about Detroit, the city per se,” said Lisa D’Amour, who with her brother Chris, hails from New Orleans. “It’s about a state of mind. It’s about anxiety, fears, isolation, disconnection, and that’s what’s happened in the suburbs. Although it’s funny, when I wrote it that was kind of a malaise among many groups of Americans, and now, Detroit was actually nearing bankruptcy so it’s in the news all over again.”\n\nD’Amour is part of PearlDamourm an Obie-award winning team—with Katie Pearl—that does collaborative theater in traditional and non-traditional venues that creates installation theatre as in “How to Build as Forest,” an eight-hour effort in which a forest is assembled, disassembled and put together again.\n\n“Detroit” is a play about what happens when strangers—neighbors but strangers—reach out to each other, with an explosive results. But D’Amour believes that’s exactly what people need to do: talk to strangers. “We need to reach out to and connect with strangers more,” she said. “We’re all too comfortable in our little groups of families, peers, people we socialize with, but we don’t talk to strangers.”\n\nOld and New: Catching the Wind With Donovan\n\nGary Tischler •\n\nDonovan Leitch was in the wind, halted for a day and night in Georgetown.\n\nLike all poets, minstrels, the self-professed Hurdy Gurdy Man was on the move, like a stitch of moon on the rise.\n\nHe had done a concert at the Robert E. Parilla Performing Arts Center in Rockville, Md., the night before, appearing surely a little like an unexpected apparition and legend there. Next day, he was on his way for a visit to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in Cleveland, the scene of a signal triumph only the year before. That’s when he was inducted into the R&R Hall of Fame, an event many of his admirers, of the torch holders with giddy lyrics of 1960s hits like “Sunshine Superman,” “Mellow Yellow,” “Wear Your Love Like Heaven” running through their heads was way overdue.\n\nAnd he was singing and talking about “Shadows of Blue,” a resurrection album of sorts, perhaps also long overdue, which he recorded in Nashville this year, the place where much of the music began for him. It was full of songs he’d put aside, like notes for a novel or a poem, and they sat in his life waiting patiently along with some new works.\n\nWe caught up with him then in the lobby of the Georgetown Inn. He wasn’t difficult to spot: in the flesh, as in the music, there is no one that looks or sounds like Donovan Leitch. We’d run into him before, at the Govinda Gallery, where some years ago he had an exhibition of his “Sapphographs,” at the Kennedy Center with movie director David Lynch of “Blue Velvet” fame where on a Transcendental Meditation event, and most recently and again at the Kennedy Center where he was a part of a star-studded tribute to Woody Guthrie, a man whose life and music haunts him and inspired him.\n\nThere’s a singular look to him, and now that look, which had the air of a Celtic Rimbaud, an affable, seductive boy-poet about it, is still there, weathered a bit, deepened, but still, in his sixties, having already lived a few lives, youthfully buoyant and full of eager curiosity. He is one of those singers whose singing voice sounds like his speaking voice. It’s not exactly musical, but it has the singer’s loop of valleys and ridges and side roads.\n\n“By God, it’s good to be here,” he said. “I love Georgetown. So many good memories and good friends and people.”\n\nIn his hotel room, a weathered guitar lies on the bed, a green and color-hued guitar, it looks well-used, no spit and polish there. “It’s seen some days,” he said. “But I like it that way.” Whereupon, he launched into a story about Jimmy Paige of Led Zeppelin and his cache of electric guitars, their own, shiny, cleaned and tuned every day, and never played. “He showed them to me once,” he said. “Can you imagine, all of that, finely tuned, no sound?”\n\n“These songs in this album, they were waiting, for a long time,” he said. “It’s like poetry, the time has to be ripe and right. It was right now.”\n\nWe can and do, of course, wander over the course of his life, in which an idea or two figure so strongly, come together. If you remember the 1960s at all, smoked some stuff, danced with hippie girls, you were seduced and driven by the music. The music started out in protest and folk music and moved into a rich and deep musical labyrinth which was full of colorful and amazing wizardly characters. In that time, what you did more than anything was move to the music that had lyrics you never forgot. It’s easy to lose track of Donovan in all those names—the Beatles, Bob Dylan, the Stones, the Animals, Zeppelin, Crosby, Stills and Nash, Santana, Joplin and Slick, not to mention Otis and Hendrix, and Motown in the background.\n\nBut there was also only one Donovan Leitch, a Scottish lad who had his days of street singing sticking his hat out with his pal Gypsy Dave vagabonding and busking but who would become a singer-songwriter and star in that cauldron of folk and funk and rock and roll, with his first hit “Catch the Wind.” “That’s when things went into the stratosphere,” he said. In the collection album, “The Essential Donovan,” you can catch that rising wind. He was a part of it all, with a singular do, and a singular voice, and the do is still there, a little wilder, gray streaked, and the pure eyes and just that voice, with etchings of rock and roll and balladry in it.\n\nNo question that he was a star. He has an id and an ego, and lots of his sentences begin with the letter I, but then he has a lot to say and talk about, and when he says “I think”, you tend to listen. But in a conversation like this, a lot of that doesn’t matter—you begin to realize after all these years, how much of an original he is, and how original all of them were. In that hall of fame and the roster of rockers and singers and balladeers and players, there is no other “Donovan,” not even a sixth cousin, although many have said that he was a lot like Dylan. “You can say it if you want,” he said. “I learned a lot and sure there is influence from everybody. Mine included me dad, and Dylan, sure, and Rambling Jack Elliott, who was a friend.”\n\nThere is, once you think about it, a touch of the ancient about him—ancient Greece, medieval rover-abouting, the spoken word becoming the sung truth. He was born in Maryhill, Glasgow, and he talks about his dad a lot—one Donald Leitch, a Rolls Royce factory employee, but a man whom Donovan sees as having the touch of the poet.\n\nAnd that’s it too—that lyric, minstrel thing—his autobiography is “Donovan, the Hurdy Gurdy Man,” which in America is a step removed from Mr. Bo Jangles and the like. The whole book is full of poetics, and lyrics and lines both straight, and crooked. Look at the chapter headings and you can sum him up pretty well: “Rebel,” “Vagabond,” “Windcatcher” and “Folksinger” early on, “Fairytale,” “The World Is Beautiful,” “Sunshine Supergirl,” “Magician” and so on.\n\nYou end up talking snatches of memory, lines from poem, and you end up in the end really appreciating his gifts. You look him up, hear the poem he said for acceptance, listen to him sing “Season of the Witch” with John Cougar Mellencamp, how he presents himself as a gift of the muse that is music.\n\nI sat down and wrote this article, while listening to his music. You realize, though the two albums are years apart—that it’s a long time from “Electric Banana” to “Blue Jean Angel”– the early work still seems brand new, while the later songs and music feel sometimes like an echo finally freed as well as finely ground. Those bookends make the old music new, the new music old. They come together in a kind of dance.\n\nDonovan’s been nominated for the Songwriter’s Hall of Fame. Rolling Stone raved about “Shadows of Blue.” He’ll be in Ireland singing. It’s like, just like the song, he’s still “Catching the Wind,” not a second wind, but something as fresh as the first wind.\n\nWomen’s History Museum: Reclaiming Missing Half of the Story\n\nGary Tischler •\n\nIn many ways, even though there is still no such thing as an actual, physical place called the National Women’s History Museum, it’s been something of a banner year for NWHM supporters, who number in the hundreds of thousands.\n\nYou could see it in the spring when legislation to create a federal commission to determine the feasibility of constructing a National Women’s History Museum was introduced by Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., and Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-D.C., with Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, introducing a companion bill in the Senate. The hope is through successful lobbying for the legislation and private funding that a museum will rise and come to fruition hopefully within five to seven years, and that women would be the principal designers and architects.\n\nYou could see it in May, when Joan Bradley Wages, president and CEO of the National Women’s History Museum, and Steven Knapp, president of the George Washington University, signed a memorandum of agreement to collaborate on public programs that will engage the local community on topics of historical relevance to women, called “Initiating Change/Adapting to Change.” The first program took place Oct. 2 with a lecture focusing on the hot topic issue of women in the military, a forum on “A New Order: Change for Women in the U.S. Military,” with Leisa Meyer of the College of William and Mary and retired USAF Brig. Gen. Wilma Vaught, president of the board of directors of the Women in Military Service for America Memorial Foundation, Inc., moderated by journalist and columnist Eleanor Clift.\n\nAn even more vivid manifestation of the identity and effectiveness of the NWHM will take place Wednesday, Oct. 9, with the Third Annual NWH’s presentation of its 2013 Living Legacy Awards, the de Pizan Honors ceremony at the Mead Center for American Theatre at Arena Stage. The event and gala, chaired by former Senator and past president of the Red Cross Elizabeth Hanford Dole, a former de Pizan recipient, and former Virginia First Lady Lynda Bird Johnson Robb, daughter of President Lyndon Johnson.\n\nThe honors are named after Christine de Pizan, a 15th-century Western woman and author of “The Book of the City of Ladies,” written in 1405, which was written to combat existing ideas about women’s nature, making her the first woman to chronicle women’s history at a time when women appeared to have no documented place in history. The honors were created in 2011 to recognize women of historic achievement.\n\nThis year’s award recipients are Washington native and renowned mezzo soprano Denyce Graves, breast cancer pioneer radiologist Etta D. Pisano, environmental preservationist Sally Jewell, and Tony Award-winning actress and television legend Phylicia Rashad.\n\nTo get a full sense of the spirit of and the hope for the National Women’s History Museum, you might want to check out Wages, who has since the beginning of the creation of the museum as an organizational institution in 1996 has been its most tireless and public face. Wages, as head of the NWHM, is its most vocal and visible supporter. Smart and charming, she brought her lobbying experience in Washington with her Alabama background, an admitted stubbornness, to the mission of helping to create a museum that highlighted the achievements and the cause of women, many of them forgotten .\n\n“Officially, the NWHM has existed since 1996,” said Wages, a former lobbyist and public relations executive. “But before that, a group of women, headed by our founder Karen Staser, were brought together, sitting and talking together where we lived and we had all noticed the absence of not just a women’s museum, but statues, dedicated spaces, things like that, which celebrated the achievements of women. I know we have women’s history month, gender studies and the like, where you certainly find out just how forgotten women are in the annals of historical achievement.”\n\nOne of the first things—at the beginning—was getting the statue of women’s suffragettes moved from a crypt into the rotunda of the U.S. Capitol. That was in 1997, and it was the first success of the NWHM, of which Wages is a founding board member. “That statue—it’s pretty powerful—wasn’t being seen by anyone,” Wages said. “We worked with other women’s group. Now, Lucretia Mott, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Susan B. Anthony can be seen my millions every year.” Then, House Speaker Newt Gingrich took time out from the big budget negotiations that year to attend the congressional ceremony honoring the women.”\n\n“I probably didn’t know what I was getting into, or the difficulties involved in this, but I do have a certain stubbornness,” Wages said. “We, all of us are committed to this, to have a women’s museum on the Mall.”\n\nPast recipients of the de Pizan honors include poet Maya Angelou, photographer Annie Leibovitz, Yahoo president Marissa Mayer, broadcaster Cathy Hughes, medical pioneer Helen Greiner and actress Meryl Streep.\n\nLegendary documentary producer Ken Burns will receive the Henry Blackwell award. “Dr. Pisano, Denyce Graves, Phylicia Rashad, Sally Jewell and Ken Burns, each represent the type of world-changing accomplishments that carry on de Pizan’s groundbreaking work of documenting and highlighting women’s achievements,” Wages said.\n\nWhat would a National Women’s History Museum look like? It’s hard to say, but a part of what the institution and organization does is “to research, collects and exhibit the contribution of women to the social, cultural, economic and political life of our nation in a context of world history,” per its mission statement.\n\nThe results of that mission—while not yet in a physical building—makes itself felt on the NWHM’s website in an archive of exhibitions that reveal a range of diversity and subject matters to enrich all. Some of the subjects have included the role and progress of African-American women, women publishers, printers and journalists, a century’s history of women entrepreneurship, women reform leaders, women in industry, women who ran for president, women in World War II, an exhibition entitled “Daring Dames,” women in early film, spies in American history, women in motherhood, early Jewish American women and more. These are the kinds of exhibition that could easily fill a museum, just for starters. And Wages, no question, will be there when that happens.\n\n[gallery ids=\"101485,152012,152014,152008,152005\" nav=\"thumbs\"]\n\nAstronaut, Critic and Man of Letters, Pulitzer-Prize Novelist: Godspeed\n\nGary Tischler •\n\nWe lost the next-to-last of the Mercury Seven astronaut Scott Carpenter, the learned film critic of the New Republic and elsewhere, Stanley Kaufman, and the lyrical, Pulitzer Prize-winning Cuban-American novelist Oscar Hijuelos these past few days.\n\nSCOTT CARPENTER\n\nScott Carpenter, one of the pioneering, original group of brave astronauts who were the first Americans to orbit the earth in the early era of space rivalry with the Soviet Union, died at 88 of complications from a stroke Oct. 10 in Vail, Colo., at a hospice.\n\nHe was a Navy man from the beginning, commissioned in 1949, becoming a naval aviator in 1951 and serving in the Korean War. He was a test pilot, and eventually became one of the Mercury 7 Astronauts selected and introduced on April 10, 1959. Among them was John Glenn, who would become the first American to orbit the earth. Carpenter was the second. The backup pilot for the first mission, Carpenter was at Mission Control and was heard to say, “Godspeed, John Glenn,” as Glenn’s spacecraft burst the bounds of earth. Carpenter piloted his Aurora 7 craft on May 24 of that year, eating “Space Food Sticks” in space. He overshot the landing zone for his splashdown, by a considerable distance, but he was found in his life raft.\n\nFor the record here are the Mercury 7 astronauts: Alan Bartlett Shepard, Jr., died 1998, U.S. Navy; Virgil Ivan (Gus) Grissom, died 1967, was commander of the Gemini mission, killed in a fire during a launch pad test one month before the scheduled launch of Apollo 1; John Herschel Glenn, Jr., former U.S. senator, Buckeye, oldest man in space; Malcolm Scott Carpenter; died 2013; Walter Marty (Wally) Schirra, Jr., died 2007; Leroy Gordon (Gordo) Cooper, died 2004; Donald Kent (Deke) Slayton, died 1993.\n\nJohn Glenn was quoted as saying “Godspeed, Scott Carpenter, my great friend,” when hearing the news of Carpenter’s passing.\n\nSTANLEY KAUFFMANN\n\nStanley Kauffmann wrote movie—or film—reviews for the New Republic for more than 50 years with a break, writing theater reviews for the New York Times. Think of all the movies viewed for such an assignment—strung together, review after review, year after year, a lifetime in the dark.\n\nThen, think of the straight forward, but deeply felt reviews he wrote. I remember reading him a lot. He took the job and the films seriously, but perhaps this came from being originally a man of the theater as well.\n\nI have some empathy and sympathy for the task. Reviewing films or stage productions involves story-telling and imagery in varying degrees, as well as words, and the telling of the saga of ourselves, we humans on earth.\n\nFor Kauffmann, for all reviewers and writers, this meant dealing daily with the sublime and the ridiculous, the sublime, even among the pearls before swine, outdoing the ridiculous, and the latter becoming sublime at times. Ask Charlie Chaplin or Woody Allen, if you could.\n\nWhat was evidenced in his writing was a passion, a love and affection for what he wrote about. What seemed evident in his bearing was erudition, seriousness, respect, intellect and culture. He made Americans—he was not alone in this—look at foreign films in new ways but rarely did so with the intent of calling attention to himself.\n\nKauffmann was 97.\n\nOSCAR HIJUELOS\n\nIf Oscar Hijuelos had never written another book other than “The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love,” he would still be famous, because that’s the book that made him a Pulitzer Prize guy in 1989.\n\nBut he did write more: “Our House in the Last World,” the wonderful, almost magical “The Fourteen Sisters of Emilio Montez O’Brien,” “Beautiful Maria of My Soul,” “A Simple Habana Melody,” “Thoughts Without Cigarettes, A Memoir,” “Dark Dude,” “Empress of the Splendid Season,” “Mr. Ives’ Christmas” and “Our House in the Last World.” Taken together, the titles alone suggest a style, a way with words, a lot of lyricism, lore, family memories, a great American and family theme.\n\nHis career, his output—and they will last pretty much forever—are another great addition to the fabric, the literary quilters of our immigration literature, which is in broad terms pretty much all of the output. It’s a crazy quilt with particular flavors and concerns of a country where everyone is an immigrant, an outsider, and insider, where citizenship and country are about matters of heart and soul, not addresses.\n\nHijuelos happened to be of a Cuban ethnic background—with that came soul, music, rhythm, mysterious tales, religion, neighborhoods and the tentacles of family.\n\nHe died after collapsing on a tennis court. He was only 62.\n\n‘La Forza del Destino’: Overwrought, But Worth the Wild Ride\n\nGary Tischler •\n\nFrom everything we know, Francesca Zambello—in her first full season as Washington National Opera’s artistic director—likes a challenge. From everything we know about composer Guiseppe Verdi, he can certainly present a challenge, especially with “La Forza del Destino” (“The Force of Destiny”), a rarely performed—for any number of sensible reasons—minefield of an opera, which presents directors, conductors and singers with an array of pitfalls.\n\nIf this relatively—it’s three hours plus but could be longer, depending on what’s in and what’s out—short production wavers and falters here and there, and sometimes threatens to crash into chaos and confusion, everyone on hand can take a little responsibility. But the principal fault is the opera’s construction, its raison d’etre. The music, as with all things Verdi, is awesome, while the libretto, based on the play “Don Alvaro” by Angel de Saavedra, Duke of Rivas, written in 1835, is not so much.\n\nYet the production, set more or less in vague, contemporary times in Spain and Italy, also manages to be compelling, its very overwrought craziness almost works for it. For that, Zambello can take a lot of credit—just for daring not to play it safe on Verdi’s centenary with a Verdi crowd pleaser, and for moving everything along at a feverish pace, overcoming the opera’s improbabilities, and outcomes, which are just plain too, well, operatic.\n\nGive some credit, too, to young American soprano Adina Aaron, who has already had some notable triumphs, including “Aida” at Glimmerglass, directed by Zambello. She took the lead role of the tragic Donna Leonora, who is driven to a life of solitude and isolation after her beloved Don Alvaro accidentally was responsible for killing Leonora’s father, the Marquis of Calatrava as the couple were about to elope against the father’s wishes. Aaron sings movingly and with emotional and vocal range—especially in the quieter scenes, as she anguished her loyalties for love and family and pleads to be allowed into sanctuary and solitude. Vocally, she tugged at the audience with her voice and her ability to perform as a tragic heroine.\n\nVerdi doesn’t help matters, of course, by literally disappearing her for most of the lengthy second act, which leaves the narrative and the singing in the hands of the Chilean tenor Giancarlo Monsalve, who sings Don Alvaro and American tenor Mark Delavan, who plays the implacable Don Carlo, Leonora’s brother on the hunt for vengeance for the stain on the family honor who has vowed to avenge the murder of his father and the dishonoring of his sister. The best way to do that—kill both of them. But after Leonora has made her way to solitude, Don Alvaro and Don Carlo, each searching for Leonora, each living under false names, get caught up in a vaguely modern war where the sides are not quite identifiable as gunmen, armed with AK-47s, hunt each other amid a scarred, charred city landscape, both saving each other’s lives in turn.\n\nThe trouble here isn’t just that the story gets a little silly. There’s only so much coincidence you can blame on destiny. The concern is that a certain sameness sets in: the two men sing about their plans, their cries for vengeance or despair—the vengeance for Carlo, the despair for Alvaro, who more than several times lets out that he only hopes for death. For a time, each is unaware of the other’s identity and have become sort of frenemies, buddies in risks, danger and courage. But alas, Carlo soon finds who Alvaro is, and the chase is on again after a bitter but inconclusive fight. Oddly enough, Alvaro winds up as taking up the cloth in the very same monastery where Leonora is hidden— ah, destiny. And soon enough, the three are reunited, with tragic results.\n\nMansalve hits his mark and notes and cuts a dashing figure, and Carlos is a menacing, large figure who you can certainly hear, but neither makes an emotional impact—and for those two, it’s a long time to carry the production before Leonora reappears. Musically, Chinese-American conductor Zian Zhang leads with energy and force, almost to a fault. The war is presented by Zambello and designer Peter J. Davison with verve, smarts and high, stark drama, the combat zone starts out as a kind of red light district, where the impassioned Preziosilla, a kind of hot-stuff seer and kinky prophetess, holds forth with bold passion as played by Georgian mezzo-soprano Ketevan Kemoklidze, turns into ruins and doubles at times as a portable MASH unit.\n\nThe scenes at the monastery are striking, touching and quite powerful, and sometimes—when the whiny priest Melitone (Columbian bass-baritone Valeriano Lanchas) is on hand—even funny.\n\nZambello chose to put the noted overture at the start of the proceedings with the performers miming actions. It seemed a muted way to begin, especially with the opening scene exploding into startling drama and great beauty, when Leonara sings how she is torn between her great love and loyalty to her father, whom she loves. Everything seems to happen at once: “Shots fired,” confusion, escape, abandonment in the space of minute. And we and they are all off in pursuit of: glory, peace, love, adventure, danger, requitement and forgiveness, vengeance and all the usual stuff.\n\nWhat Zambello has done is to bring all this to preposterous and often thrilling live action—the landscapes, and settings brim with the energies and schemes, the sorrows not just of heroes, villains and heroines, but priests, the starving, the wounded, the holy and unholy all around them.\n\nThat’s what makes this particular “La Forza del Destino”, a force, if not of destiny, at least high drama and stirring (by Aaron and the orchestra) music.\n\nAt the Kennedy Center: “La Forza del Destino” will be performed Oct. 16, 20, 24 and 26, while Amber Wagner, Rafael Davila and Luca Salsi will take on the three principals Donna Leonora, Don Alvaro and Don Carlo on Oct. 18 and 22.\n\nA Homecoming for Dance Theatre of Harlem and Jenelle Figgins\n\nGary Tischler •\n\nThe return of the legendary Dance Theatre of Harlem to Washington in its debut at Harman Hall tonight, tomorrow and Saturday afternoon and evening — Oct. 17, 18 and 19 — is a big deal for the three participating institutions: the DTH, the Washington Performing Arts Society and CityDance.\n\nIt’s also a big deal for Dance Theatre of Harlem dancer Jenelle Figgins, who is performing in the city where she was raised, lived, studied and was inspired to become a dancer. She is an alumna of our town’s own Duke Ellington School for the Arts.\n\nThe performances are two sets: “Gloria,” choreographed by Robert Garland; the world premiere of “past-carry-forward,” a new ballet by Harlem dancers Tanya Wideman-Davis and Thaddeus Davis; and “Contested Space” by Donald Byrd, tonight at 8 p.m. and Saturday at 2 p.m. and “Agon,” a work by George Balanchine to music by Igor Stravinsky, first performed by DTH last year; “Far But Close” by John Alleyne; “Return,” choreographed by Robert Garland to music by Aretha Franklin and James Brown; and “Glinka Pas de Trois,” another Balanchine on Friday and Saturday night at 8 p.m.\n\nA resurgent Dance Theatre of Harlem, founded by New York City Ballet principal dancer Arthur Mitchell in the 1960s, returns to Washington under the leadership of Washington School of Ballet graduate Virginia Johnson.\n\nThe performances mark an expansion of the Washington Performing Arts Society’s dance program through a partnership with CityDance. Earlier this week, there were two lecture demonstrations on dance technique to CityDance students and other students in WPAS’s Capitol Dance programs at THEARC in Ward 8.\n\n“This exciting partnership enables WPAS to expand our dance programming and present performances by vibrant companies and choreographers alongside meaningful learning and performance opportunities for students, a connection that is fundamental to WPAS’s mission,” said WPAS President and CEO Jenny Bilfield.\n\nCityDance Executive Director Alexe Nowakowski said, “The partnership fulfills CityDance‘s mission to bring high-quality professional performers to the DC area and to present CityDance’s students with exposure to these artists. We’re excited to have the opportunity to bring such a celebrated company to the community.”\n\nJenelle Figgins is excited, too. A member of the company, she’ll be dancing in “Agon” and other parts of the programs, and she’ll be coming home as well. She and two of her sisters all went on to become dancers, including her twin Samantha, now with the New Complexions Contemporary Ballet. “We started when we were five,” Figgins said of herself and her sister Samantha. “We’re identical twins. We had as an example our older sister Dionne and all the encouragement from our mom Linda.”\n\nShe was here only recently with DTH last year in “Dance Across America.”\n\n“This is even more special, because this is my hometown, because we’re working with other people, because this is what’s special about being in a company,” Figgins said. “It’s all about removing your ego, which is hard, you know.”\n\nBoth Jenelle and Samantha Figgins went through Jones-Haywood School of Ballet, the Dance Institute of Washington and Duke Ellington School of the Performing Arts—“that was our high school, it was so important.”\n\nShe’s serious, in the sense that she’s given everything about dance and being a dancer a lot of thought and is articulate about expressing those thoughts. Figgins mused: “In a company, you’re reliant and work with everyone else. But it’s also about a visual language, a way of communicating through movement, through gestures and music, a different way of articulating the world and being in it. There is this great promise in dance and ballet, that you can travel through the world with it, that you can find new ways of expressing yourself.“\n\nHer record of performance and training speaks for itself: she received scholarships to attend Dance Theatre of Harlem’s Kennedy Summer intensive, and attended SUNY Purchase New York and received her BFA with honors in dance. She was with Springboard Danse Montreal, and in her young (she’s 24) career featured in works by Sarah Mettin, Kevin Thomas Emily Molnar, Twyla Tharp, Paul Taylor, Balanchine, Nora Reynolds and Hinton Battles. She has performed with the Metting Movement Collective, Collage dance Collective and Les Grands Ballet Canadiens de Montreal.\n\nYou can see her online during a rehearsal of “La Bayarde,” and you see and feel her freedom and seriousness at the same time. And you can smile at the girl who attended Duke Ellington on 35th Street here in town, who is now Jenelle Figgins, ballerina.\n\n[gallery ids=\"101501,151440\" nav=\"thumbs\"]"
