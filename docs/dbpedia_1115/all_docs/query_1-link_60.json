        "text": "Just in time to brighten up that incessant gray of January in an “insanely ridiculous” fashion, “The Drowsy Chaperone” makes its Missoula debut on the stage of the MCT Center for the Performing Arts. Perhaps not as viscerally familiar to Montana audiences in the way “The Sound of Music” was, Missoula Community Theatre is certain you will find this Tony Award-winning “comedy within a musical” a breath of fresh, fast-paced whimsical air!\n\nShow times are 7:30 p.m. Wednesdays-Fridays, 2 and 7:30 p.m. Saturdays, and 2 and 6:30 p.m. Sundays, Jan. 21-31.\n\nThis is “the funniest musical that has been written in quite a while,” notes director Joseph Martinez. “Its ‘musical within a comedy’ idea is genius and allows audiences to let go for a while and just laugh.”\n\nA parody of 1920s musical theatre, it weaves a hilarious story that invites the audience into the head of an eccentric Broadway fanatic (known only as “Man in Chair,” played by Robert Harsch). The man’s mind musings and continuous commentary create a real-time rendition of his favorite show right there in his living room. Vibrant characters who shamelessly indulge in toe-tapping, show-stopping numbers and ludicrous shenanigans keep the antics rolling and the audience reeling! A strong ensemble cast features favorite Missoula performers such Tim Shonkwiler, Darci Monsos, Greg Boris, Brit Garner, and Erin Tooley.\n\nMartinez notes that the show’s comedy takes place now, while the musical takes place in the 1920s, which can create some “non-politically correct moments.”\n\n“But I think that’s half the fun. It shows us where we were as a society 80-plus years ago, and how much our society and acceptance has changed, and how much it hasn’t.”\n\nThe artistic team of music director David Cody (with assistance from Brett Mitchel) and choreographer Heather Adams bring the glitz of old-time Broadway glamour to life with sparkle and pizazz. The play’s music and lyrics are written by Lisa Lambert and Don McKellar, while Bob Martin and Greg Morrison wrote the book.\n\nSo find the “downright ridiculous” fun this January with a playdate at the Missoula Community Theatre! The humor may go over the heads of most kids, but the silliness and energy are perfect for older teens and all adults."
