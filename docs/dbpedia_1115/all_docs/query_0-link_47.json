        "text": "A man in a chair appears on stage and shares his favorite record album: the cast recording of a fictitious 1928 musical. The recording unaccountably comes to life and THE DROWSY CHAPERONE performance begins as the Man in Chair watches, comments, and offers detailed historical facts. With two lovers on the eve of their wedding, a bumbling best man, a desperate theatre producer, a not-so-bright hostess, two gangsters posing as pastry chefs, a misguided Don Juan and an intoxicated chaperone, you have the ingredients for an evening of madcap delight. With Tony® Award-winning music and lyrics by Lisa Lambert and Greg Morrison, and book by Bob Martin and Don McKellar, THE DROWSY CHAPERONE is both a wild musical farce and a sentimental reflection about the role of music and theatre in our lives."
