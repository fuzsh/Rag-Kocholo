        "text": "Last spring, I was in a white van rumbling down a road about fifty miles east of Bangkok, passing dusty awnings that hung over shops hawking cell phones and sneakers, when, abruptly, the vehicle stopped. The road was barricaded; the barricades were manned by soldiers in uniform. After a moment, I realized that the soldiers were actors and the barricades were props. We had reached the set of “The Sympathizer,” the director Park Chan-wook’s seven-episode HBO adaptation of the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Viet Thanh Nguyen. A producer hurried me out of the van and through a crowd of background actors playing Vietnamese villagers, wearing sun-bleached trousers and thin cotton dresses. They were sitting on suitcases that carried, in the world of the show, their most important possessions—everything that they would try to take with them out of the country. Time had rewound to April, 1975, and Saigon was about to fall. It was ninety degrees out and densely humid. A directive crackled through a walkie-talkie, and the actors rose to their feet, pastel parasols springing into the air.\n\nPark was sitting nearby, in a shaded corner that served, for the day, as video village, the spot on a film set where the production team gathers around monitors to review each take. At sixty, Park, who is Korean, has a mop of silver hair and an obscurely regal demeanor. He wore woven leather sandals and vented performance gear, as if he were about to go fishing. Nearly everyone referred to him as Director Park, following a Korean practice of using the title as an honorific. On set, at any given moment, you could hear Thai, Vietnamese, Korean, and English being spoken, but the action was mainly directed in English. Park understands and reads the language well, but he’s not the type to risk miscommunication. His instructions were relayed to the cast and crew by Jaehuen Chung, a filmmaker who served as Park’s interpreter.\n\nThe shot they were trying to get was relatively straightforward. A Citroën driven by the show’s protagonist—a Communist double agent simply called the Captain—would push its way through the distress of the crowd. Working alongside Park was a co-producer named Jahye Lee, who had served as the script supervisor on his most recent film, the slow-burning noir romance “Decision to Leave.” She and Park were sharing a bag of salty tempeh snacks. Each time a new take began, they sat up straight in their director’s chairs in perfect tandem.\n\nPark has a gift for sumptuous spectacle underpinned by meticulous preparation. He storyboards his movies from start to finish before shooting begins, and presides over the details of his filmic universe like a clockmaker god. He has an unapologetically showy style that draws on a promiscuous cinematic education—Akira Kurosawa and Kim Ki-young, Alfred Hitchcock and Robert Aldrich, forgotten B movies and contemporary genre films—and a conviction that everything is permissible and nearly anything is possible. His camera skitters, glides, flummoxes. How, you might find yourself wondering, while watching “Decision to Leave,” did he shoot a mountain from inside the eye of the dead man at its base?\n\nPark called cut and moved one of the soldiers in the frame slightly to the right. Filming resumed, then he called cut again: one background actor, among dozens, needed to look up at the road earlier. There was a pause. “Just waiting for this cloud to move,” a beefy guy said into a walkie-talkie. The sky brightened. The Citroën rolled through the barricades once more—Episode 101, Scene 47, take four.\n\nThis was day eighty of production. All in all, the shoot for “The Sympathizer” would take a hundred and twenty days. While Park and his crew tried to get the Citroën scene right, a construction team of nearly two hundred people was building a more or less fully equipped replica of a reëducation camp, close to the Malaysian border. It would provide the setting for the show’s frame story: the Captain, after the war, has been imprisoned, and is narrating his journey between worlds—he ultimately makes it out of Vietnam, and heads to Los Angeles—to an unseen, unamused superior.\n\n“The Sympathizer” is the product of a marriage between two eminent tastemakers, A24 and HBO. It was green-lighted three years ago, late in the era of so-called Peak TV, when cable networks and streaming services chased market dominance by throwing money at big-name talents who wanted to work on ambitious projects. HBO was the reigning power of this period. But, by the time of my visit to set, the network was at the center of new industry contractions. A year after “The Sympathizer” went forward, HBO’s parent company was bought by another network, Discovery, known mostly for its reality shows. Discovery’s C.E.O., David Zaslav, took on more than fifty billion dollars in debt to complete the deal, and soon began shelving movies for tax writeoffs. Across the industry, streamers turned off the development-money tap as executives became risk-averse. Profits weren’t satisfying investors, and the prospect of a writers’ strike loomed.\n\n“The Sympathizer,” which features zero wealthy white people sniping at one another in luxury settings, was always a risky bet. The cast includes a handful of well-known actors—Sandra Oh, John Cho, David Duchovny—mostly in supporting roles. Its biggest star, Robert Downey, Jr., was reportedly paid two million dollars per episode to play four different parts: a C.I.A. agent, a conservative congressman, a professor with a fetish for “the Orient,” and a filmmaker shooting a movie with a passing resemblance to “Apocalypse Now.” But the events in the show are narrated from a distinctly Vietnamese perspective—the series opens by reminding viewers that, in Vietnam, the conflict is called the American War. At one point, an American college student asks the Captain, played by the young Vietnamese Australian actor Hoa Xuande, if he appreciated the efforts of protesters in the U.S. The student proclaims that they were on “the side of the Vietnamese people.” The Captain says, “Which people? The people in the North or the people in the South?” The student, stymied, answers, “All of them, I guess.”\n\nPark put on a big khaki hiking hat. Chung relayed another instruction: the Citroën should drive faster onto the bridge. Park told the show’s visual-effects supervisor that there should be stars on the car’s license plate, and that he wanted to digitally remove one of the buildings in the background. The sequence would culminate in the Captain desperately running to board a moving plane, surrounded by people carrying the wounded and the dead. By then, the sky, in Nguyen’s description, is a “meteorite shower of rockets and artillery shells . . . an apocalyptic light show that revealed the evacuees dashing for the concrete divider, stumbling and tripping along the way, suitcases forgotten, the thundering prop wash from the two remaining engines blowing little children off their feet.” To film the scene, the crew would affix the back half of an airplane to a truck, rig cranes with lighting to simulate phosphorus explosions, put up enormous fans to create whipping propeller winds.\n\n“The craft is at as high a level as the art,” Alec Hammond, the production designer for the Thailand shoots, told me. “Take the evacuation—how do you get actors carrying people or dummies into a plane to carry all that real emotion? How do you put that set together in a way that it’ll move at fifteen miles per hour, that it’s safe, that you can reset between takes?” Park’s sets are notoriously calm; he wraps early more often than he asks people to stay late. Hammond told me that there is a surety to Park’s filmmaking that allows it to be efficient: “When he gets it, he knows it, he knows how he’s going to use it, and he can stop.”\n\nThere was a break. Video village was next to a bridge, which arched over a murky river. Next to the river was a tree, and someone had noticed a mottled python curled around one of its branches. Burly guys from the crew gathered to look at the snake. Park ambled over, hands behind his back in an avuncular pose. His manner can resemble his movies—patient, intense, with no wasted motion. He craned his head in curiosity, trying to see the python, but couldn’t find it. Jahye Lee took a photo of the tree on her phone and zoomed in to show him. He saw the snake then, framed properly on the screen, and smiled.\n\nWhen Viet Thanh Nguyen was writing “The Sympathizer,” which he began more than a decade ago, one of the influences on its style was “Oldboy,” Park’s best-known film. “Oldboy” was released in 2003 and prompted a new groundswell of interest in Asian cinema in the United States. It tells the story of Oh Dae-su, a man who is mysteriously imprisoned in a hotel room for fifteen years, then just as mysteriously released, after which he seeks bloody revenge on his captor. Nguyen saw the film when it reached the U.S., and he wondered if the novel he was writing, which would be his début, could conjure the energy of the movie’s most famous sequence: Oh, armed only with a hammer, fighting his way through a ghastly green hallway full of murderous thugs. That scene, a single, three-minute take, is framed like a sacred medieval tapestry, with Oh’s assailants wielding sticks and pipes the way knights might hold spears. Nguyen told me that he wanted his book “to tell a story in overpowering language,” and he saw a “distinct parallel in the sumptuousness and weirdness” of Park’s style. Another scene in “Oldboy” involves Oh eating a live octopus, tearing into the viscid, squelching tentacles with his teeth. (Choi Min-sik, the actor, ate four octopuses to get the shot; he is a Buddhist, and prayed in apology between takes.)\n\n“Oldboy” provides the brutal tick-tock pleasures of a revenge movie only to deconstruct, sickeningly and expertly, the very notion of revenge. In the end, Oh finds his captor, a former classmate named Lee Woo-jin. Lee, on account of a grudge held since high school, not only imprisoned Oh but also manipulated him, after his release, into unwittingly having sex with his own daughter. In an abject effort to persuade Lee not to reveal this to her, Oh barks like a dog, licks Lee’s shoes, and cuts off his own tongue with scissors. (“If you want a peaceful rest, have a bath,” Park told an interviewer, shortly after the movie was released.) Like most people who watch “Oldboy,” Nguyen found this finale disturbing. But upon rewatching the movie he realized that his ambitions, too, required unsettling people, both stylistically and politically. With “The Sympathizer,” Nguyen similarly tries to upend the reader’s expectations—of a spy novel, an immigrant novel, a political novel. The Captain, disillusioned, ends up captured, back in Vietnam, believing in nothing. The book also shares with Park’s films a pitch-dark, absurdist humor. Its epigraph is a quote from Nietzsche that begins, “Let us not become gloomy as soon as we hear the word ‘torture.’ ” The Captain’s first sexual experience involves masturbating into a raw squid meant for a family dinner.\n\n“The Sympathizer” was turned down by thirteen publishers before being bought by the independent press Grove Atlantic. It sold twenty-two thousand copies in hardcover; then it won the Pulitzer and sold nearly half a million copies in paperback, at which point Hollywood got interested. But it’s a tricky novel, as slippery as its protagonist, and getting an adaptation off the ground was a long process. Early on, a producer told Nguyen that the project was being pitched at a budget comparable to that of “Narcos,” the Netflix series about Pablo Escobar, which reportedly cost around twenty-five million for its first season. The producer said, “We’re hearing that, for that kind of money, we’d need someone on the scale of Keanu Reeves” as the star. “In retrospect,” Nguyen told me, “that’s really racist—not the producer, but what they were hearing. Pedro Pascal is a huge star now, but when ‘Narcos’ first started filming they didn’t have any A-list actors.”\n\nAnother producer, Niv Fichman, who was born in Tel Aviv and lives in Toronto, connected Nguyen with the Canadian actor and writer Don McKellar, who’d adapted José Saramago’s “Blindness” as a feature film starring Julianne Moore. Working with non-Americans made adapting the book easier, Nguyen said, because they weren’t “so hung up on their version of the Vietnam War.” McKellar had once written a script with Park—an adaptation of “The Ax,” a Donald Westlake novel about an unemployed man who begins murdering his competitors for prospective jobs—and he persuaded Park to come on board as the showrunner. But Park insisted that McKellar share the task: Park had done television once before, adapting the John le Carré novel “The Little Drummer Girl” for the BBC, and the shoot had been difficult, keeping him away from Korea for long enough that he grew homesick. Making television is a more bureaucratic process than filmmaking, involving more input from more people on more footage. For “The Sympathizer,” Park would direct the first three of the show’s seven episodes and turn the rest over to other directors. He knew “the enormous amount of work and negotiation and diplomacy involved,” McKellar told me.\n\nPark is a shrewd and skillful adapter of literature. “Oldboy” was based on a manga; his film “The Handmaiden,” from 2016, was adapted from Sarah Waters’s novel “Fingersmith.” In both cases, Park made transformative story edits: he moved the plot of “Fingersmith” from Dickensian London to Japan-occupied Korea, and added the Sophoclean incest twist to “Oldboy.” (Of the latter change, Park has said that he was less interested in why a man would be held prisoner for so long than in why the torturer would suddenly set the man free.) It was Park’s idea to have Robert Downey, Jr., play four different characters: one man to symbolize all the banal horrors of the West. Nguyen told me that, in their first meeting, Park “had questions about the plotting, the characterizations, details that he’d have to think about as a director. He had plot suggestions. I thought, Wow, I wish he had read this when it was still in manuscript.”\n\n“I like to read every kind of fiction available, and I don’t go about distinguishing genre literature from non-genre literature,” Park told me. In 2009, he used Émile Zola’s “Thérèse Raquin” as the basis for a vampire movie, “Thirst.” He prefers books, he added, that “pull me out of the very ordinary life I live—the boring, dull life that is not exactly different from any other person.” In conversation, Park has a professorial manner and a philosophical bent. He said that he favors literature in translation—books about other countries, “exotic, strange, distinct work.” Then he paused. “At the same time, it is quite contradictory. Because I tend to discover that, at the end of the day, all of us are quite similar. And although I’m very ordinary, I feel empathy for the humanity that lives in that strange environment.”\n\nPark seems attracted to a particular kind of moral inquiry: his films often center on protagonists who blindly take up a singular objective and then see that objective implode. “I am drawn to the character who acts on their resolve, but then, having arrived at their destination, finds that they have arrived at a completely different place than they had intended,” he said. “That’s essentially how life is, I think. And the tragedy is that we find out too late.”\n\n“The Sympathizer” is Park’s most direct engagement with a major historical event. In taking on such a subject, he said, he had been wary of “only focussing on the subject matter,” of fixating on accuracy, of “looking to excavate a takeaway.” But Nguyen’s novel was multivalent enough that Park felt he could avoid this. Its central concerns—betrayals, divided loyalties, the myopia of ideological fervor—were universal, and so he could concentrate on finding a visual analogue for Nguyen’s prose, which is laced with irony and bitter humor and a sense of paradox. “Our Captain is convinced that he is a Communist, but he is drawn to America, and he has a tough time admitting this dilemma, even internally,” Park said. He proceeded to parse the Captain’s political miseducation, pinpointing the incidents that dismantle the character’s loyalty to each side. Listening to him, I had the sense of a warm knife cutting cold butter into perfect squares.\n\nActors tend to describe working with Park as a pleasurable submission to the artist’s hand. Nicole Kidman, the star of “Stoker,” Park’s only English-language film, said, in 2013, that she was “one of his paint colors.” Florence Pugh, after filming “The Little Drummer Girl,” used the same metaphor: “You are part of a moving painting, and must trust the artist.” Downey told me that, on the set of “The Sympathizer,” Park’s influence was felt in every department, including costume and makeup—he described the director as “literally molding” the four characters that he plays. (Downey’s wife, Susan, a film producer who worked on the series, told me that Park and her husband would go to the makeup studio and “just play with the clay.”) Hoa Xuande said, of Park, “You hope that you can live within his frame to the best of your ability, to allow him to tell his visual story.”\n\nXuande and I were speaking during a day of filming in the Bangkok neighborhood of Samphanthawong, where the apartments had a faintly French Quarter look. Thailand has never been formally colonized, and it had been hard to find locations with architecture resembling that of nearly perpetually occupied Vietnam. (The Vietnamese government didn’t approve the production’s request to shoot there in time, possibly on account of the source material; a Vietnamese publishing house translated “The Sympathizer” in 2016, but has not been able to secure permission to release it in the country.) The Captain is half white; Xuande is not, and for the role he wore blue-green contacts above his natural and utterly remarkable cheekbones. Craft services had put out a buffet of spicy Thai food for lunch. “I’ve never spoken this much Vietnamese in my life,” Xuande told me. Conveniently, his family’s way of speaking the language was stylistically arrested in the nineteen-seventies, when they immigrated to Australia. “It feels like I’m learning to rap,” he said. “Getting the cadence and rhythm right. I’m saying things I never would have learned to say in Vietnamese, like ‘dialectical materialism.’ ”\n\nAfter lunch, Park, from his chair, orchestrated a fight scene that included the Captain, two of his subordinates, and a female spy. Through his interpreter, Chung, he adjusted the scene the way a Photoshopper might edit individual pixels, changing the placement of the Captain’s fingers when the spy bit him, angling a knife that was held to the spy’s mouth, telling the Captain to turn his eyes toward his subordinates a second earlier. As Park gave notes about exactly how much blood he wanted on the spy’s face and where he wanted it, he opened a Tupperware of papaya wedges. More takes rolled. Chung murmured into the microphone, “We want a closeup on her throat. We want to see her swallow—we couldn’t really read the swallow. Lower angle on the throat.”\n\nAs a child, growing up in Seoul in the late sixties and seventies, Park watched Hollywood movies on the American Forces Korea Network, typically without subtitles and always in black-and-white. Korea, which was less than two decades removed from Japanese occupation when Park was born, did not have color TV until the eighties. Park saw Westerns and James Bond movies and filled in the colors in his mind—spacious bluebird skies and rolling green hills of prairie grass, the scarlet flower pinned to Bond’s black lapel. Before he learned English, he constructed the narratives through visual cues: expressions, camera angles, the movements of bodies. His father was a professor of architecture; his mother loved film. (Park’s younger brother, Park Chan-kyong, is a multimedia artist.) The family was Catholic, and the iconography of the religion filled Park’s head with images of sacred violence: blood and arrows, spiked wheels. In high school, a priest told his parents that Park would do well in seminary. After that, Park stopped going to church, and decided that he didn’t believe in God.\n\nNonetheless, he went to a Jesuit college, Sogang University, in Seoul, where he became a philosophy major and joined the photography club and the film club. At a screening of Hitchcock’s “Vertigo,” he watched as James Stewart drove slowly behind Kim Novak, the two cars gliding through San Francisco, and felt the image transcend the medium: he wasn’t watching a movie; he was dreaming Hitchcock’s dream. He realized then that he wanted to be a director.\n\nThe film critic Kim Young-jin, a classmate, has said that Park, as an undergraduate in the early eighties, was a dishevelled chain-smoker who talked about things like Godard’s “anti-bourgeois camera style.” It was a time of political upheaval in Korea. Park Chung-hee, a general who had seized power in 1961, was assassinated in 1979. Another general, Chun Doo-hwan, took control and placed the country under military rule. In 1980, several hundred student protesters were beaten by government paratroopers, provoking a larger revolt that was also violently suppressed. Hundreds, possibly thousands, died. “Every day we had to deal with tear bombs on campus, or we would hear news of friends or of other students who had killed themselves by jumping off a building, or we would hear of people being tortured by police,” Park has said. He believed in the cause of a free and democratic Korea but was not inclined to put himself in the path of a grenade. “I was weak and a coward and so couldn’t actively fight, and the brave ended up being the ones sacrificed to this intense violence,” he told an interviewer. “That was when I became interested in themes such as guilt, vengeance, and redemption.”\n\nAfter completing his mandatory military service, Park worked as a production assistant and an assistant director on melodramas by young filmmakers, then took a job at a company that imported foreign films. Under the dictatorship, just twenty-five companies were allowed to make movies in Korea. But in June, 1987, after it was revealed that a student protester had been tortured to death, Chun Doo-hwan’s successor gave in to the pro-democracy movement, permitting the country’s first direct Presidential election. Censorship eased, allowing for independent film production, and electronics manufacturers began funding movies. A Korean New Wave took shape.\n\nIn the early nineties, a company called Dreambox financed Park’s first film, “The Moon Is . . . the Sun’s Dream,” a crime drama starring a Korean pop star. It bombed, and the only published review was ghostwritten by Park. He says that a critic friend was assigned to review the film and couldn’t bring himself to do it, so he offered to step in. “New, amazing talent has arrived,” he recalls writing. It took five years to get his second movie made. “Trio” centers on a criminal alliance forged by a suicidal saxophonist, a violent orphan, and an aspiring nun. Like his début, it is regarded by nearly everyone as being outside his real canon.\n\nHe began working as a critic for anyone who would have him, displaying a fondness for deep cuts and for pulp, writing admiring reviews of “Attack of the Killer Tomatoes” and “Alien 3.” He wrote scripts, too, but no one was interested in producing them. Then he resolved to make a commercially viable film. The result was “Joint Security Area,” a thriller set in the Demilitarized Zone and released in 2000. It’s tonally idiosyncratic—part mystery, part morality play, and part dudes-rock comedy. Its hook, though, is simple and potent: four soldiers, two from the North and two from the South, become friends rather than killing one another, and then two of them end up dead. The movie opens with the investigation into their deaths, and the story of the soldiers is told in flashbacks. It became the highest-grossing movie in Korea, and it helped make Song Kang-ho—now perhaps the most famous Korean actor in the world—a star.\n\nPark and Song became friends—the director and his actors were around the same age, and they would go out drinking after days on set. Song starred in Park’s next film, “Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance,” in 2002. It has a plot like a Rube Goldberg machine, one act of violence producing another: a deaf factory worker kidnaps a child and holds her for ransom so that he can buy his dying sister a kidney; his sister, learning about the kidnapping, kills herself; while the factory worker is burying his sister, the child drowns; the child’s father kills the factory worker, then he is murdered as well. “Sympathy,” which is part of a loose trilogy with Park’s following two movies, “Oldboy” and “Lady Vengeance,” is a procession of disturbing images. Four men spoon one another, masturbating together as they listen through a wall to the sister moaning in agony from her disease. Blood seeps out of the factory worker’s severed Achilles tendons as he dies in a river. “As I made it,” Park told his old classmate Kim Young-jin, “I was giggling from start to finish.”\n\nI visited the Los Angeles set of “The Sympathizer” on a chilly, sunny morning, the kind where everyone wears a parka even though it’s fifty-five degrees. After the Captain reaches L.A., he receives instructions from his commander, the General, to kill a suspected mole, who’s called the Major. (The Captain is the actual mole.) That day, the crew was shooting a scene in which the Major, played by Phanxinê—a Vietnamese director who had never acted professionally before—tells the Captain how excited he is for the Fourth of July, blithely unaware of his impending execution. Park sat alert in his chair, focussed on the minutiae of the shot. Between takes, he sipped from a tiny cup of espresso and strolled around like a benevolent lord. A light-brown Cavapoo named Toby, who belonged to one of the producers, ran freely, at one point coming up to Director Park, who bent down and scratched behind Toby’s ears.\n\nPark is widely heralded as one of the world’s great filmmakers, but his movies remain divisive. They are criticized for being gratuitously violent, or for favoring sensation over depth, or for having characters who don’t quite seem real. Park’s reputation was fixed, to a degree, by “Oldboy,” which became the first Korean film to win the Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival, in 2004, thanks in part to lobbying by that year’s jury president, Quentin Tarantino. The movie was distributed on DVD in the U.S. by the company Tartan Asia Extreme—a sort of A24 of the aughts for message-board movie nerds interested in grindhouse Asian horror—and achieved huge popularity, though it was still passed around like a secret.\n\nPark is married to a woman he met in college, whom he has described both as a “normal housewife” and as his most trusted script reader; they have a daughter. After “Oldboy,” he has said, he began to “repent having only created stories that pushed women to the periphery.” In 2001, he’d served on the jury for a short-film competition and had selected a work by the female screenwriter Chung Seo-kyung as the winner. “I remember thinking he was a very gentle person,” Chung, who is twelve years younger than Park, told me. “He remembers me being very bold and not using honorifics.” Park asked Chung to collaborate on his next film, “Lady Vengeance,” another movie about wrongful imprisonment and violent revenge, which culminates in a Grand Guignol sequence where a group of parents slaughter the man who tortured and killed their kids.\n\nPark, who maintains long-term relationships with collaborators—including his primary director of photography, his editor, and his music director—has co-written all his subsequent features with Chung. They start off by talking through the story, plotting it out. Afterward, she writes the first draft, and then they revise it together, sitting at one table, working on a single computer connected to two keyboards, rewriting each other’s words, as though playing a verbal game of table tennis, line by line. “We have the most conflict over the male characters,” Chung told me. “At first I refuse to give in, but then most of the time I let him win, because, when I see the final film, I often come to the realization that Director Park was right.”\n\nIn the films that have followed the “Vengeance” trilogy, sex has arguably been Park’s central subject. In “Thirst,” Song Kang-ho is a priest who altruistically contracts a disease in a clinical trial; it turns him into a vampire, and he becomes terrified by his own lust for flesh and blood. The film is often classified as erotic horror, though it is also Park’s truest comedy. (In one scene, Song hemorrhages blood through his ears and mouth while ponderously playing the kind of music-class recorder that one associates with “Hot Cross Buns.”) Nicole Kidman’s character in “Stoker” is an icy, horny widow who, along with her daughter, played by Mia Wasikowska, is seduced by a gentlemanly psycho played by Matthew Goode. He wants to help Wasikowska reach her full potential, as a serial killer. Sex, in “Stoker,” is a subterranean river threatening to burst through the ground; in its most libidinous scene, Goode and Wasikowska play a Philip Glass duet on the piano. The movie has an unsettling sensory precision. One transition between shots, in which Kidman’s hair, brushed by Wasikowska, melts imperceptibly into a field of waving grass, is somehow as shocking in its wordless beauty as the “Oldboy” octopus is in its squelch.\n\nIn Park’s masterpiece, “The Handmaiden,” sex suffuses everything: ivory shoulders, satin ribbons, black ink, a ripe peach, a wine-colored lollipop. Sarah Waters’s story is about a lady and her maid who outrun, in twist after twist, the men who try to seduce and entrap them; Park was intrigued by the way it centered queerness but not discrimination. The movie contains many of Park’s trademarks—a reversal at the midpoint, washes of hyperreal green, a chamber of private violence, octopus stuff—and is the first to fully marry his intensity and his restraint. When he and Chung wrote it, she told me, their voices had melded so naturally that each was writing the kinds of things that the other person was supposed to be good at. She crafted a darkly funny scene in which a woman who is trying to stop another woman’s suicide almost kills her. Park wrote the line “I wish I had milk so I could breast-feed you,” uttered during sex.\n\nWaters’s novel has just one sex scene, narrated twice. “The Handmaiden,” by contrast, is frequently explicit: it features sex toys, the sexual position known as scissoring—included at the insistence of a lesbian friend of Chung’s—and a shot of a woman’s face from the point of view of a receptive vagina. To some viewers, this all seemed suspect, given the pristinely conventional beauty of the lead actresses, Kim Min-hee and Kim Tae-ri, and the inarguable maleness of the director. Park, when asked about this, pointed out that the story is about the violence of the male gaze—the women, long subjugated by men and pornography, find independence with each other. “When I first watched the film, I did think, Whoa, there’s a lot of sex here,” Waters told me. “My worry, as I was watching, was that, as in lots of traditional porn, a man would step into the women’s intimacies and take over. But that never happened. As in the book, the whole idea of that is played with, then subverted. Instead, the exploitative men destroy each other.”\n\n“The Handmaiden” was a box-office success in Korea and got some of the best reviews of Park’s career. But several years passed before the completion of his next film. In the meantime, Park learned that, during the years he was working on “The Handmaiden,” he was one of many left-leaning Korean artists who’d been secretly blacklisted from receiving government support by the conservative Presidential administration of Park Geun-hye. (Park Geun-hye, the daughter of the late dictator Park Chung-hee, was removed from office in 2017, following charges of corruption.) Bong Joon-ho, the director of “Parasite” and a friend of Park’s, was also blacklisted. Park had at least one film rejected for funding. “Only after everything had come out did somebody who was involved with the funding process tell me they had to reject it because of the government,” he said later.\n\nDespite Park’s international acclaim, the Korean Film Council, prior to 2022, had never submitted one of his movies as the country’s nominee for the Best International Feature Film Oscar. It finally did so with “Decision to Leave,” a movie that turns down the dial on both the violence of his early films and the sex of his later ones. It plays frequently like an homage to “Vertigo,” in which James Stewart’s character forces Kim Novak’s character to become someone she is not. In both movies, a detective chases a femme fatale who disappears halfway through, then reappears in new circumstances; both feature scenes in stairwells, rooftop chases, a deadly fall from great heights. When critics mentioned this, Park replied that the resemblance was accidental. “The many films that I have watched throughout my life are all jumbled together in my subconscious,” he said.\n\nThe Oscar nominations were announced a couple of hours before I arrived on set in Los Angeles. “Decision to Leave” had been shut out completely. Later, I asked Park whether he cared about such things. “It would be hypocrisy to say that art is the only thing that matters,” he told me. “If you get an award, it might mean you have more power, more creative freedom, in your next project. It might mean you can have a bigger budget. Maybe you can have more freedom and a bigger budget, depending on how big the award is.” But Chung said that, of all the people she knows in Chungmuro, Korea’s version of Hollywood, Park cared the least about what others thought of him and his work. Also, she said, “he really doesn’t like the trouble of attending awards ceremonies.”\n\nIn May of 2023, after “The Sympathizer” had finished shooting, the Writers Guild of America went on strike, citing lower earnings in the streaming era and the prospect of A.I. replacing writers. Then the Screen Actors Guild followed suit, and Hollywood shut down for five months. Executives bemoaned the losses to the industry; strikers noted that the state of executive pay—Netflix doled out $166 million in 2022, which, according to one estimate, was nearly triple the cost of the W.G.A.’s demands—suggested a set of priorities amid which art hardly stood a chance.\n\nBoth unions ultimately got most of what they wanted, but the message from executives afterward was plain: the industry, from that point forward, would more or less exclusively chase hits. Movie stars only, please, working with directors who could safely deliver something palatable to the mainstream. In TV production, a brief vogue for limited series was over—and the lip service that had been given to “diverse voices” mostly went quiet. “Certainly, if you’ve been going to networks lately, there’s a pushback on so-called quality television,” Don McKellar told me. “There’s definitely a push to be more accessible, whatever that means.”\n\nOn a podcast early last year, Casey Bloys, HBO’s chairman and C.E.O., said, “If you spend a lot of money on a show, it needs to do well.” A show could do this by garnering a combination of ratings, awards, and buzz, he explained, but, if you were going to get only buzz, the show had to be “easy to say yes to.” He brought up “My Brilliant Friend,” the network’s adaptation of Elena Ferrante’s Neapolitan quartet, which didn’t get great ratings—it was in Italian—but was beloved by those who watched it. Bloys noted that the show was a co-production with several European companies, and so it didn’t cost the network much money. An easy yes.\n\nHBO declined to disclose the budget for “The Sympathizer,” but its apparent expense seems like a holdover from a previous era. “It was certainly a big budget to me,” McKellar said. He had worked hard to stay within it, he added. “That was one of the things that fell on my plate—cutting the budget, trying to trim, trying to be economical. Still trying to do that. But anyway.” We were speaking in mid-February. Although “The Sympathizer” was scheduled to première just two months later, the first episode was not yet locked. During postproduction, as HBO executives watched rough cuts, Park and McKellar got network notes, which often amounted to an industry-standard query: Can we make this easier to understand, so that more people will watch it?\n\nPark’s work, though not short on sex, violence, or set pieces, tends toward intricacy, and Park does not slow things down to explain. “He will never repeat a piece of exposition, even if people are begging us to,” McKellar said. “Even with English being a second language, he’ll ask, ‘Do we need this word? Do we need that word?’ ” When “The Sympathizer” was being written, people read the scripts in their own languages. Park kept tabs on the writers’ room, run by McKellar during the pandemic, through Jaehuen Chung, his interpreter, who sat quietly on Zoom, taking notes—a spy of his own. Once it was actually filmed, and subtitles were added to the multiple time lines and the twisty spy plot, the show seemed more complicated than before. Susan Downey told me, “The narrative complexity of the storytelling reads easier as a script.”\n\nAs the notes came in, Park insisted on understanding the reasoning behind each of them. “Why did they say that?” he’d ask McKellar. McKellar told me that he admired this quality in Park, even though it made his job harder; sometimes he found himself telling executives and producers, “Well, he’ll never allow that.” There was only so much they could alter in postproduction anyway. Park does not shoot much coverage—extra footage that might allow you to alter a scene. “There’s not a lot of latitude in the edit, which is not usual for television executives to see,” McKellar said.\n\nNguyen, who was witnessing a big-budget adaptation up close for the first time, compared the entertainment industry to the U.S. military. “Just as the Pentagon has billion-dollar bombers or whatever it has, Hollywood makes billion-dollar movies,” he told me. “And once you’re making art at this industrial scale, it is, in the end, this gigantic, corporate, collaborative enterprise—in which somebody like Park Chan-wook is incredibly important as a director and an auteur, but still, so many other factors are involved.”\n\nIn both the novel and the series, the Captain finds himself serving as a cultural consultant on a racist, romanticized Vietnam War movie called “The Hamlet.” (In the show, David Duchovny is very funny as its majestically self-serious star—as is John Cho as an Asian actor who’s made a career out of getting killed by a variety of famous white guys onscreen.) “The Sympathizer” also had Vietnamese cultural consultants on set, who monitored every take and gave feedback. The writers’ room was largely staffed by Asian women. More than a few times while reporting, I paused to absorb the rare pleasure of speaking mostly to other Asian people about a project with so much money and muscle behind it. Nguyen appreciated this, too, but remained skeptical about how much it mattered. “My work is not about representation within a corporate behemoth,” he said. “My work is about decolonization. These two things do not coincide.”\n\nNguyen has a steely quality that seems equally rooted in brashness and self-consciousness. He said he would be happy if the show led to Asian actors getting more roles, and if it expanded the possibilities of storytelling about Asian diasporas. But even if it did those things, he added, “it can leave the machinery running the way it’s always run, just with different faces involved.” Nonetheless, he couldn’t resist the draw of viewership. “A good novel or great novel would be lucky if it was read by tens of thousands of people,” he told me. “Hundreds of thousands is extraordinary. But even a bad TV show can be watched by millions.”\n\nSeven weeks before “The Sympathizer” was set to première, I finally got a pre-lock cut of the show’s first four episodes. The first episode dispenses backstory at a dizzying pace before reaching the terrible, tremendous evacuation. The Citroën rumbles over the bridge; a cigarette’s burning ember turns into a rocket falling through a black sky. A bus, glowing with nauseous light, races toward the plane, carrying evacuees, who then sprint across a runway seen from above, like a chessboard, where they are scattered and maimed by bombs. The Captain crouches over a fallen body; he looks up at the airplane, the camera zooming with a shudder to track his gaze. Others in the crowd gesture at him to hurry, the hellish sky behind them orange-red. After he makes it onto the plane, an emergency light flashes red in the shell-shocked darkness, illuminating a baby’s bare, limp foot. Park knows when to muster force for one of his “spectacles of ruination,” as the critic Kim Young-jin puts it, and he knows when to pull away.\n\nTelevision, though, may never be quite the right medium for a filmmaker who casts a spell that’s not meant to be broken, and who rewards the viewer through destabilization and discomfort. In the novel, the ambivalence and elusiveness of the Captain has a whorling specificity to it; in the series, he often seems a little vague, or indistinct. As if in compensation, Robert Downey, Jr.—who told me that getting Park “to crack a smile or raise an eyebrow” became, in the course of filming, “a significant part of my motivation”—individuates each of his characters with a baroque pleasure, practically tap-dancing. The Captain’s surreal American experience climaxes in a scene in which all four of Downey’s characters surround him at a restaurant, laughing at the absurd plenitude of their own power while seated on a red velvet banquette.\n\nShortly after I watched the first four episodes, I talked to Park on Zoom. It was 9 A.M. in Seoul, and he was in the office of his production company, sitting at a desk, in a black blazer, with three different beverages arrayed before him. I complimented him on the show, through his interpreter. “It’s a work in progress,” he said. “So I’m actually embarrassed that you’ve watched it.”\n\nWhen I asked him about HBO’s desire to simplify the series during postproduction, he answered with a story about watching Hitchcock’s “North by Northwest” with his parents when he was young. That movie stars Cary Grant as an ad exec mistaken for a fictional man created by an American intelligence agency to distract an enemy spy. Park followed the movie just fine, but his father said that he didn’t understand it. “Hearing my dad, who I considered dear to my heart, say that had a big impact on me,” he told me. “I think it is important for the audience to be actively and creatively involved in the experience they’re having. I want them to think about what they’re watching as they’re watching it. But it all comes down to the matter of how far we can take it. I won’t say that I’ll cater to the audience to the point where they can text, or do something else while they’re watching—but I don’t want my audience to feel as my father did while watching ‘North by Northwest.’ ”\n\nHe thought for a second. Then he said, “I think the dilemma always ends up being this: Is it better for the audience to know what is happening right now at that very moment, or do we want them to understand a little bit later?”\n\nThe question struck me as a remarkable one during this era in Hollywood, when, although a handful of ambitious shows continue to get made, many others are being produced with the full knowledge, and even acceptance, that the audience will be texting or scrolling on social media from start to finish. Executives want signposts as big as billboards—ideally, a new drama will, in its first five minutes, present viewers with a dead body; a clear, trauma-dependent backstory for the protagonist; and fully articulated narrative and thematic stakes for every plot point to come. Park’s work is not esoteric, but the trust he has in viewers is not highly sought after right now. Park, for his part, sees an important kind of realism in his approach to storytelling. “If the audience knows what is happening as it is happening, the strength of this is that they can inhabit the character and what they are feeling,” he said. “But there is a strength to the audience learning a little bit later, because that’s how it is in our life. There are no people we understand immediately, no incident that we grasp entirely as it unfolds.”\n\nPark has a tendency, in conversation, to offer a proposition and then consider its reverse, somewhat like the Captain. He does not think that there is a fundamental difference between TV and movies, but he recognizes different constraints and opportunities in each medium. With a feature, you risk losing richness and complexity for the sake of efficiency; with a TV series, he said, you can waste your time “like a millionaire wasting their abundant fortune.” It had been important to him to bring to “The Sympathizer” the same concentration he would bring to a film, and not to waste “one second, one minute, or even a frame,” he said. Then he paused again. “But when we’re talking about ‘Moby-Dick,’ the technique of catching a whale, the descriptions of all the different types of whales, the elaborate expression of what it is to dissect a whale—it is very long, but is it a waste? And when Balzac is describing a nineteenth-century pension system, it’s also very belabored, but is it a waste?”\n\nThese days, when Park isn’t filming, he takes photographs. Many of his pictures are of witty moments when an object or a scene seems to become something else. At his first solo exhibition, which was mounted in 2021, in Busan, one photo showed a “Star Wars” sunshade spread across the dashboard of an empty car, so that the characters appear to be passengers. In another, closed-up patio umbrellas look like an army of vigilant ghosts. The practice challenges him to capture spontaneously the sort of striking images that he painstakingly arranges in his films."
