To chase his blues away, a modern day musical theatre addict known simply as “Man in Chair” drops the needle on his favorite LP — the 1928 musical comedy The Drowsy Chaperone. From the crackle of his hi-fi, the uproariously funny musical magically bursts to life on stage, telling the tale of a pampered Broadway starlet who wants to give up show business to get married, her producer who sets out to sabotage the nuptials, her chaperone, the debonair groom, the dizzy chorine, the Latin lover and a pair of gangsters who double as pastry chefs. Man in Chair’s infectious love of The Drowsy Chaperone speaks to anyone who has ever been transported by the theater. Lottery Ticket Policy: Ninety minutes prior to each performance, patrons will be invited to enter a lottery drawing at the Marquis Theatre (1535 Broadway) for a limited number of $25 lottery tickets to that day’s performance. Names will be drawn at random one hour prior to curtain. There will be a limit of two tickets per person and tickets may be purchased using cash only. Winners must be present with valid identification at the time of the drawing to purchase their tickets.",
