I had a blast interviewing former child actress from “The Wonder Years” Danica McKellar about her latest book called The Times Machine! Like me, you probably adored her first as Winnie! (My daughter knows her from “Project MC2” on Netflix.) Among other great acting roles and becoming a parent, Danica started McKellar Math. She developed her own math theorem, spoke before the congressional committee in 2007 about why kids' math scores are far behind those in other countries, and how we should really start in middle school targeting kids for math. Now she has written ten different math books (all of which have terrific titles). She's a total star and her passion has helped so many kids and families get through the stress of learning math together.",
