        "text": "During most of the 1960s, it was easy to view the musical as hopelessly out of touch with contemporary America. Even with three Broadway blockbusters opening in the same year (1964) – Fiddler on the Roof , Hello, Dolly ! and Funny Girl – and the film version of My Fair Lady walking away with eight Academy Awards – it seemed apparent to some that the Golden Age of Musical Theatre had staged its own grand finale as these works neither reflected nor commented on the turmoil of the 1960s; they were escapist and nostalgic. With the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy (1963), Martin Luther King (1968) and Senator Bobby Kennedy (1968), and the escalating war in Vietnam, the world was a different place from the comparative calm of the 1950s. In 1964, the Beatles appeared on the Ed Sullivan Show for the first time, heralding with electronic chords that the British invasion was in full force, and rock ’n’ roll was here to stay. As urban centres across the county fell into disrepair, many downtown theatres were abandoned (often to the wrecking ball) and the road business of touring musicals began to decline. Financially and artistically, the fabulous invalid was not in very good shape.\n\nWhen Hair arrived on Broadway in 1968, the Great White Way at last embraced a musical whose music and sentiment reflected some of the headlines of its day, and it was staged in a way that distanced itself aesthetically light years away from other musicals playing around Times Square. With the New York premieres of Stephen Sondheim’s Company (1970), Andrew Lloyd Webber’s Jesus Christ Superstar (1971), Michael Bennett’s A Chorus Line (1975) and John Kander , Fred Ebb and Bob Fosse’s Chicago (1975), several new artists found audiences for their disparate visions of what a musical could be, sing and/or dance about. Experimentation continued as the concept musical, the jukebox musical, the revisal, the dansical, and the megamusical came to be. Despite rising ticket prices, theatre attendance began to climb both in New York and on the road. While movie musicals virtually disappeared from the silver screen after Cabaret (1972) and Grease (1978), the stage musical continued to attract audiences even as it experimented with new forms and structures. Truly, rumours of its demise were grossly exaggerated.\n\nChanges that occurred in the American musical at the end of the twentieth century made it clear that while twenty-first century musical theatre owed much to the past, it was creating sub-genres which would have been unrecognisable to its original creators such as Cohan , Kern , Berlin, Gershwin , Hart and Fields . In order to explicate the musical at the dawn of the twenty-first century, we will first look at musical theatre genres that have their roots in the past, then move to new forms which emerged around and after 2000.1 Finally, we will explore the changing roles of directors, choreographers, actors and producers as musical theatre explores new options in the twenty-first century.\n\nThe Integrated Musical\n\nShows with a coherent, strong libretto that create a theatrical world where the focus is on story and character, and songs are constructed to further plot and character development, are alive and well. Productions such as Ragtime (1998), Hairspray (2002), Avenue Q (2003), The Drowsy Chaperone (2006), The Book of Mormon (2011) and Something Rotten! (2015) continue this fine tradition. While the Golden Age of Musical Theatre is often seen as the maturation of the integrated book musical, musical theatre creators are still drawn to the proven efficacy of this form.\n\nBlack Musicals\n\nThe black musical is a subdivision of the pop/rock musical, featuring music that reflects jazz, blues, gospel, funk, reggae, rap or Motown. Examples are Gary Geld’s Purlie (1970), Judd Woldin and Robert Brittan’s Raisin ’ (1973), Micki Grant’s Don’t Bother Me, I Can’t Cope (1972) and Your Arms Too Short to Box With God (1976), Charlie Small’s The Wiz (1975), Michael Butler’s Reggae (1980), Gary Sherman’s Amen Corner (1983) and The Color Purple (2005) with book by Marsha Norman and score by Brenda Russell , Allee Willis and Stephen Bray . Special mention should be made of Mama, I Want to Sing ! (1983), which opened at the 632-seat Heckscher Theater in Harlem. Written by Vy Higginsen , Ken Wydro and Wesley Naylor , the original production ran 2,213 performances, closing after eight years only because of a lease dispute. Two sequels – Mama, I Want to Sing II (1990) and Born to Sing ! (1996) – a six-month run on the West End of Mama in 1995, and several world tours brought the musical to millions. The original Mama cost $35,000 but grossed $25 million in its first five years. Higgeninsen (wife) and Wydro’s (husband) family business earned $8.7 million in 1988; they are one of the most successful black-owned enterprises in America.\n\nThe jukebox musical also proved to be a popular form for African American songwriters and performers. Notable examples include Ain’t Misbehavin’ (1978), a celebration of songs by Fats Waller ; Sophisticated Ladies (1981), showcasing the music of Duke Ellington ; Black and Blue (1989), an anthology of songs by African Americans that were popular in Paris between the two world wars; and Five Guys Named Moe (1992), focusing on songs by Louis Jordan . Perhaps not surprisingly, given the demographics of the Broadway audience, few producers in the twentieth century attempted to bring rap music to Broadway, the exception being Bring in ’da Noise, Bring in ’da Funk (1996). Conceived and directed by George C. Wolfe , the appeal of Funk had more to do with the innovative choreography and performance by Savion Glover than the music.\n\nHaving sold more than 75 million records worldwide, rapper Tupac Amaru Shakur (1971–96) was hailed by Rolling Stone in 2010 as one of the ‘100 Greatest Artists’ of all time. But the jukebox musical Holler If You Hear Me (2014), featuring his music failed to connect with audiences (thirty-eight performances). More successful was Stew and Heidi Rodewald’s Passing Strange , which ran for 165 performances during its Broadway run in 2008. Spike Lee filmed the stage performance, releasing a feature film of the same name in 2009.\n\nAsian Musicals\n\nWhile such shows as Rodgers and Hammerstein’s Flower Drum Song (1958) and Boublil and Schonberg’s Miss Saigon (1989) have given Asian American performers long-running hits in which to perform, there have been very few Asian American–authored musicals. Leon Ko and Robert Lee’s Heading East (1999), Making Tracks (by Welly Yang, Brian Yorkey , Woody Pak, Matt Eddy, 1999), The Wedding Banquet (book and lyrics by Brian Yorkey; music by Woody Pak, 2003), A. R. Rahman’s Bombay Dreams (2004) and Maria Maria (book and lyrics by Hye Jung Yu , music by Gyung Chan Cha , 2006) are rare exceptions. Though the original music was kept, David Henry Hwang wrote a new libretto for The Flower Drum Song when it was revived on Broadway in 2002.\n\nFrom a chance encounter between Star Trek star George Takei and songwriters Jay Kuo and Lorenzo Thione in 2008, it was a long road to Broadway for Allegiance (2015), a new musical which tells the story of a shameful piece of American history, when more than 100,000 Japanese Americans were forcibly interned in prison camps during World War II. Written by Jay Kuo (music, lyrics and book), Lorenzo Thione (book) and Marc Acito (book), and directed by Stafford Arima , Allegiance had a fifty-two-performance successful run at San Diego’s Old Globe Theatre in 2012, but was stalled until a suitable Broadway house opened up in 2015. Along with the star power of Takei, Tony Award winner Lea Salonga and Telly Leung , the production also marked the debut of Telecharge Digital Lottery, where patrons could apply online for $39 rush tickets. Failing to find an audience, the musical closed after three months.\n\nFolk/Country Musicals\n\nIn the folk/country/western music genre, notable past successes include Frederick Loewe and Alan Jay Lerner’s Paint Your Wagon (1952), Carol Hall’s Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (1978), Barbara Damashek and Molly Newman’s Quilters (1984) and Roger Miller’s Big River (1985). Nevertheless, even though country music sales have been rising along with Spanish CD music sales, there has yet to be a successful twenty-first-century folk or country musical. While the Broadway debut in 2014 of Jeanine Tesori’s Violet (1997) featured a highly praised score which incorporated gospel, blues, country, bluegrass and honky-tonk, its Broadway run of 128 performances owed more to the star power of Sutton Foster than to its sound.\n\nThe ‘Dansical’\n\nWhen Contact won the Tony Award for Best Musical in 2000, it was clear that the dansical had arrived, although director/choreographer Susan Stroman’s work was advertised as ‘a dance play’. Here the emphasis is on dance and the narrative is told through movement since there is generally no dialogue or sung lyrics. As another sign of the new supremacy of the choreographer/director (see Chapter 13), the dansical often does not contain original music. Consider, for example, Big Deal (Bob Fosse , 1986), Dangerous Games (Graciela Daniele , 1989), Chronicle of a Death Foretold (Daniele, 1995), Contact (Stroman, 2000), Movin’ Out (Twyla Tharp , 2003), The Times They Are A-Changin’ (Tharp, 2007) and Come Fly Away (Tharp, 2010). While the form is not new, Susan Stroman and Twyla Tharp can be given credit for almost single-handedly popularising the form. Some critics noted that Tharp had already been on Broadway before with an evening-long dance theatre piece The Catherine Wheel , which had a three-week engagement in 1981."
