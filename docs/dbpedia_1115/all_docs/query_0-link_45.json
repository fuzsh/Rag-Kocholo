        "text": "Description\n\nBook by Bob Martin and Don McKellar\n\nMusic and Lyrics by Lisa Lambert and Greg Morrison\n\nWinner of five Tony Awards, including Best Book and Best Original Score, The Drowsy Chaperone is a loving send-up of the Golden Age musical, featuring one show-stopping song and dance number after another.\n\nWith the houselights down, a man in a chair appears on stage and puts on his favorite record: the cast recording of a fictitious 1928 musical. The recording comes to life and The Drowsy Chaperone begins as the man in the chair looks on. Mix in two lovers on the eve of their wedding, a bumbling best man, a desperate theatre producer, a not-so-bright hostess, two gangsters posing as pastry chefs, a misguided Don Juan and an intoxicated chaperone, and you have the ingredients for an evening of madcap delight.\n\nHailed by New York Magazine as \"The Perfect Broadway Musical,\" The Drowsy Chaperone is a masterful meta-musical, poking fun at all the tropes that characterize the musical theatre genre."
