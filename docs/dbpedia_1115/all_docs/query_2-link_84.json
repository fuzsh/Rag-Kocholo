        "text": "It seems like every time you turn around Don McKellar has a new project on the go. From collaborating with Bruce McDonald on classic Canadiana films like Roadkill and Highway 61, to writing and directing his own films like the apocalyptic Last Night, to success in television with shows like Twitch City and Sensitive Skin, the only commonality in McKellar’s work is a consistent commitment to quality.\n\nHis most recent project is a reboot of source, Michael: Every Day is a new-ish CBC series that picks up from a show he made with Matt Watts (The Newsroom) and Bob Martin (Slings and Arrows) in 2011 called Michael Tuesdays and Thursdays. Watts and Martin play Michael and David, whose relationship goes beyond your typical patient/ therapist dynamic in this witty comedy. Don McKellar directs all six episodes of the new series which premieres on CBC January 15th. He spoke with us about returning to these characters five years later, working with Ed Asner, and the best way to get people’s attention in a market oversaturated with content.\n\n[powerpress]https://thatshelf.com/podcast/TheShelf_Minisode_DonMcKellar.mp3[/powerpress]Download the MP3 directly HERE\n\nStream all 12 original episodes of Michael: Tuesdays and Thursdays here.\n\nFind us in iTunes: itunes.apple.com/ca/podcast/the-shelf/\n\nFind us in Google Play: play.google.com/music/m/Ir5wbhqgm42rsylelnxuvgtf67a?t=The_Shelf\n\nFind us on Stitcher: stitcher.com/s?fid=126465\n\nFind us on Spotify: *COMING SOON*"
