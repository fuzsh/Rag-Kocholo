        "text": "The cast of \"The Drowsy Chaperone\" enjoys the stage together at the Cape Playhouse. Courtesy photo\n\nAre you putting me on? Once you’ve figured out that’s just what this whip-frippery musical is – a grand spoof – you can sit back, enjoy the silliness and appreciate a stage full of talent on display at the Cape Playhouse in the musical “The Drowsy Chaperone.”\n\nThe original Broadway production, from 2006, won five Tony Awards, including Best Musical. In his introduction to the evening’s performance, Cape Playhouse producer Mark Cuddy noted that Lisa Lambert, one of two people who wrote the show’s original music and lyrics, was in the audience. Perhaps that’s one reason the performances seemed extra sparky and polished.\n\nThe concept of “Chaperone” is that of a show within a show, as a past-middle-age man, called simply “Man in Chair” (played with shuffle, grace and humor by Simon Jones), sits in his apartment listening to a 78 rpm vinyl recording of an old musical from the 1920s, called “The Drowsy Chaperone.” He draws us into the act: “Let’s disappear for a while into the decadent 1920s …” He proceeds to add occasional ironic and humorous comments as the cast materializes in his apartment to perform the musical right then and there. And what a musical. The whole shebang is a blown-up parody of early ‘20s musical comedy, complete with over-the-top numbers, larger-than-life characters, mistaken identities, in-your-face comedy, spiffy dancing and emotional lovers’ laments, all drawn with broad comic strokes by a smooth, professional cast that wings us effortlessly through the laughs, pratfalls and ever-familiar anthemic production numbers.\n\nJo Anne Worley, familiar to nearly all of us as one of the genius comics from TV’s iconic “Rowan and Martin’s Laugh-in,” brings her zany presence to the role of Mrs. Tottendale, the hostess at a pre-wedding party that turns into a free-for-all where everybody gets into the act. She and her servant, Underling (a delightful James Dybas), are great fun together, swinging through numbers including the zesty “Love is Always Lovely” – and Miss Worley’s gowns are gorgeous, especially one breathtaking cerise number at the finale.\n\nRobert and Janet (Danny Gardner and Julie Kavanagh) as the to-be-marrieds bring a ton of impressive Broadway-level bravado and talent to their numbers – hilarious parodies of the romantic muddles that invade the musical comedy genre. Robert’s best man, George (John Scacchetti), joins him in a snappy tap routine, one of many show-stopping numbers. And Robert’s not bad on roller skates, either – and with a blindfold (don’t ask) – as he and Janet glide through “Accident Waiting to Happen.”\n\nEach musical number includes memorable performances, including such standouts as the wonderful gangster team of Ben Liebert and Elliott Mattox, who add a touch of vaudeville to the craziness. They’re song and dance men a la perfection, with many-colored costumes, weirdly-patterned pants and argyle socks to, well, knock your socks off. Oh, and they’re disguised as pastry chefs, too, with plump cooks’ hats and a wardrobe of pastry jokes – “There’s muffin you can do about it.” Michele Ragusa, the drowsy (inebriated) chaperone herself, sings a wondrous song or two and hams it up with ham extraordinaire Aldolpho (Craig Laurie), the Latin lover who’s supposed to seduce the bride-to-be, but gets the wrong dame by mistake. Bill Nolte as the bombastic Feldzieg and Kristen Mengelkoch as dim bulb Kitty, the wannabe star, add comic interludes.\n\nIf it all sounds nuts, like I said, just enjoy the smooth performances and fine voices, along with dance numbers that shoot you right back to the showstoppers of the 1920s, complete with glitz and high-stepping routines. At the end, a classy Trix the Aviatrix (Dan’yelle Williamson) flies in to whisk all the lovers away on a “flying honeymoon” par excellence. It’s an enjoyable evening of high voltage entertainment, where the joke’s on the musical comedy, but it’s all in fun."
