A rare combination of unprecedented originality and blinding talent, The Drowsy Chaperone boldly addresses a great unspoken desire in all of our hearts: to be entertained. If you've ever sat in a dark theatre and thought, "Dear Lord in heaven, please let it be good," this is the show for you!

It all begins when a die-hard musical-theater fan plays his favorite cast album on his turntable, and the musical literally bursts to life in his living room, telling the rambunctious tale of a brazen Broadway starlet trying to find, and keep, her true love.

The Drowsy Chaperone opened to critical acclaim--the Montecito Journal declared it "the best show in town!" Congratulations to the cast and crew of The Drowsy Chaperone. Later that night after the show, parents, friends the cast and media headed over to the Butler Event Center for a special after-show gala put together by Mary Layman.
