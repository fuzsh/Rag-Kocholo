        "text": "food-network-star-rosa-graziano\n\nRosa Graziano preparing arancini, Italian rice balls, on \"Food Network Star,\" which premieres Sunday.\n\n(Eddy Chen/Food Network)\n\nExpect extra helpings of Jersey on \"Food Network Star\" this season. The show that launched Food Network staples Jeff Mauro, Melissa D'Arabian, and, heaven help us, Guy Fieri, debuts Sunday night with two New Jersey chefs offering distinct takes on Italian cuisine.\n\nRosa Graziano's pedigree is undeniable: A first-generation Italian, her family has owned the DePalma Brothers deli in Fairview for decades, and she still helps run the business even though she spends much of her time in Los Angeles. Moving there after college, she says, was culture shock.\n\n\"Where are the Italian delis?,\" she recalls thinking at the time. \"You have this idea when you're growing up that everyone is sort of the same way as you. Everybody has four courses at dinner ... I don't know not having high-quality Italian foods at the table. Subway? I've never even walked into a Subway. I have no concept of that experience.\"\n\nShe learned how to cook at her mother's side but didn't really consider a career in food until, as a fluke, she ran a zeppole stand at the Feast of San Gennaro in Los Angeles, co-founded in 2002 by Jimmy Kimmel. That inspired her to open a food truck, Rosa's Bella Cucina, offering arancini (stuffed rice balls, a Sicilian specialty), eggplant parm and Italian sandwiches. She and her equally gregarious brother Rico have also appeared on numerous cooking shows.\n\nRELATED: How reality TV alumni are changing N.J. (and American) dining\n\nWhat sets her apart from Giada DeLaurentiis, the Food Network's resident expert on la bella Italia and one of \"Food Network Star\" mentors? \"She has such grace in what she does,\" says Graziano, who specializes in the hearty cuisine of southern Italy, where the food -- and the people -- are \"bigger, louder in a way.\"\n\n\"Sometimes you see these cooking shows and think, 'Am I ever going to make that?',\" Graziano says. \"I want them to get dirty with me. I want us to mess up together.\"\n\nSita Lewis of Hackensack was born to an African-American father -- the famed boxing promoter Butch Lewis, best known for managing Leon and Michael Spinks -- and an Italian mother. She also learned to cook from her mother, who died when Lewis was 12. Her father remarried, and she picked up some soul food tricks from her African-American stepmother.\n\nThe result is Italian soul, her Italian-herbed sweet potato-stuffed shells and seven-cheese macaroni and cheese, sometimes spiked with pieces of chicken parm, being prime examples. (So no, Lewis is not this season's requisite healthy-can-be-delicious-too! contestant.)\n\nLewis, a former BET television producer and on-air personality, would seem to have an advantage on \"Food Network Star,\" which puts as much emphasis on delivery as cooking chops.\n\n\"You would think that, right? I could have walked and taught Bobby Flay a thing or two,\" she laughs. \"Probably my time in television did help me, but it didn't help with the nervousness. It's a different kind of nervousness when you're competing.\"\n\nAfter her father's death in 2011, Lewis decided try to combine her love of food and cooking with her television background, launching the YouTube series SinfullyGoodTV with her friend and former colleague Lisa Johnson Smith. Lewis is also a culinary producer at Harlem Children's Zone, helping high school students create their own cooking show and writing their own cookbook.\n\n\"It's never too late to reach for your dreams, and I am going to be an example of that,\" Lewis says. \"I'm 47. I've already lived a career of producing TV. I could continue to do that, but why not reach for what I love to do before it's too late?\"\n\nThe contestants this season also include former \"Top Chef\" contestant Arnold Myint from Nashville, former NFL player Eddie Houston, who also competed on \"MasterChef,\" and Staten Islander Dominick Tesoriero, who own a mac-and-cheese food truck in New York City. \"Food Network Star\" premieres Sunday at 9 p.m."
