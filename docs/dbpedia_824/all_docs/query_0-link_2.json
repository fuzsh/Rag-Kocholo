ONLY AVAILABLE AT 70s-TV.com\n\nMy Original transfers of the first 8 shows(excluding episode 2) have been copied and sold everywhere on the internet. Other sellers are still selling my old 8 disc collection. As the years passed and I purchased new equipment, I learned more about getting the most out of the VHS to DVD process. Curious to see how much I could improve these shows, I went back to the original tapes and made a new pass at it. I was very surprised and happy with the results. I also added some beautiful menus and Artwork. What I now have is the Best and Only one of its' kind. A further exclusive is the find of Episode #2 that now makes this set complete.
