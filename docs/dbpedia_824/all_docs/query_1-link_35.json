That’s pretty close to fascism in my book. Hmm, a difficult question to answer. For it’s not just one thing that I love most about him. It’s an amalgam of many different things. He considers my opinion important. Whether it be about the flavor of cornflakes or about next car we ought to purchase. The grocery store sells me cereal. I don’t really care where it comes from as long as it’s clean and good for me. I don’t care about their talents and dreams.\n\nBattle of the network stars shirt, hoodie, tank top, sweater and long sleeve t-shirt"
