        "text": "Detective Sexypants is about to face off against The Incredible Hulk! That’s right, Ryan Paevey (Nathan, GENERAL HOSPITAL) is competing on BATTLE OF THE NETWORK STARS in the “Cops Vs. Sci-Fi/Fantasy” episode airing on Thursday, Aug. 17! “The day was awesome,” the actor declared to Soaps In Depth of the unique experience.\n\nAs a police detective on GH, Paevey naturally was placed on team “Cops” along with Marisol Nichols (24), Roma Maffia (PROFILER), Adrian Zmed (T.J. HOOKER), and Fred Dryer (HUNTER). They were pitted against team “Sci-Fi/Fantasy,” which included Lou Ferrigno (THE INCREDIBLE HULK), Vinnie Jones (ARROW), Charisma Carpenter (BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER), Kevin Sorbo (HERCULES), and Jill Wagner (TEEN WOLF).\n\nMUST SEE: Ryan Paevey and Kirsten Storms Preview What’s Next for Maxie and Nathan!\n\nPaevey with team coach DeMarcus Ware and fellow TV cop Fred Dryer.

That being said, everybody on my team was super freaking cool and so are the people in the other team. There wasn’t any drama or smack talk. I spent the day hanging out with Vinnie Jones, basically.”\n\nMUST SEE: Ryan Paevey Stars With a Different Maxie in a Romantic New Movie!\n\nPaevey gives the obstacle course a test run! (Photo Credit: Byron Cohen/ABC)\n\nThe competition contains multiple events including a running relay, archery, swimming, and tug-of-war. But Paevey confided that while he had no problems with the obstacle course, there was one event that proved to be quite a challenge! “Now they’ve got to bring me back to see if they can design an obstacle course that might challenge me,” he boasted before confessing, “The foot race at the beginning of the day was the only thing I did all day that was difficult. That messed me up! Our first event was a four-by-one relay. It was three 100 meter relays and then the anchor would run a full lap. I kind of crippled myself doing that.”\n\nPaevey wouldn’t reveal which team took home the victory at the end of the day, but you can tune in to find out for yourself when his episode of BATTLE OF THE NETWORK STARS airs Thursday, Aug. 17, at 9 p.m. ET on ABC!\n\nFor more on your favorite GH stars, keep reading the ABC edition of Soaps In Depth magazine!\n\nLove GH?
