        "text": "Anyone interested in seeing how much our attitudes have changed in recent years need only tune their television to ESPN Classic at the appropriate time. Battle of the Network Stars, a horrid program designed exclusively to offer prurient sights in an otherwise innocent context, is being rebroadcast.\n\nI watched religiously in my youth, when this show, and several others, were born entirely to attract young men interested in anything that jiggled. At the time, everyone seemed okay with this premise. The sexual revolution was upon us, and anyone complaining was considered a prude. How could anyone criticize athletic competition, especially when women were so abundantly represented?\n\nPeople like Linda Carter, Catherine Bach, Erin Gray, and the Heathers; Locklear and Thomas, were all dressed in their most athletic outfits, ready for competition. That competition consisted primarily of finding excuses to get the participants in water. Even the guys were picked for their beefcake potential. Good clean fun until someone loses an eye or gets worked up.\n\nThe original Battle of the Network Starsmaterialized on my television one recent Saturday afternoon when everything else was either uninteresting or blacked out. Thinking back to the days when such pastimes were innocent fun rather than inappropriate, misogynistic behavior, I tuned in, expecting to see a few ancient stars in revealing videos.\n\nIt took about three minutes of Howard Cosell before I changed stations. I eventually had to shower before I could live with myself. Howard was that creepy uncle we all wish would grow up; The unrepentant sexist who swears the world still likes his stupid double-entendres; TF after a few drinks.\n\nI didn’t remember this side of Cosell. He was considered the pioneer that changed sports broadcasting by introducing intelligence into the proceedings. He was an unwavering champion of liberal causes. Minority respect in sports competition, accurate reporting of relevant issues, even support of women in traditionally male broadcasting positions; Cosell was loud and unwavering concerning the side he supported in the culture war of the late 60s.\n\nDespite his resume, I was never a fan. He seemed to be an arrogant blowhard on television, sucking up airtime like a vacuum, and uttering the telling pronouns me and I much too often. He really lost me when he was involved in baseball telecasts.\n\nWhen I tried to watch Battle of the Network Stars reruns, I was stunned by Cosell’s actions. His leering comments to every woman he talked to, his need for physical attention, his superior, condescending questions, all surprised me. I wondered at my own personal growth and vowed to never watch again.\n\nAnd now there is a new version. I can’t imagine watching. Truthfully, the only reason to view the original was to see a little titillation. The games were lame, the participants were inept, and the competition was staged. Any modern day version will be much, much worse.\n\nWe have lived through three generations of participatory trophies and overreaction to anything slightly inappropriate. Television now dumbs down its product to the lowest common denominator and focuses on fake controversy, over-hyped story lines, and Twitter responses for support.\n\nNot even the two Heathers could get me to watch."
