        "text": "Stars are exactly what you said they are. Some indication that someone (or maybe a bot) clicked on a button and taken in abstraction of anything else there is not much more that you can infer from that.\n\nYou could assume that everyone is using stars for the same purpose but as you pointed they could be used to show your appreciation of a project as well as for bookmarking it and therefore they are either some form of feedback to a repo as well as some form of bookkeeping for the star maker.\n\nStar counts are still routinely used by researchers as a proxy for project popularity though while it may correlate OK for the most popular projects this likely does not hold for the vast number of other projects in the long tail.\n\nSo some may interpret it as a proxy for popularity but in in the end this likely a weak proxy. Combining the number of forks, watchers, issues, commits, etc. might be better in the end but still only a proxy and will never be an unbiased metric.\n\nIf you are in search of metric to determine if a project is popular, a better approach might be to determine who is reusing what. Which is another complex problem of its own especially since reuse may be private and hidden. And you could lace in other metrics but as always with a pinch of salt.\n\nTo illustrate this, take this ranking of users for my self. This correlate OK with my skills and interests in general but it does not know a little fact about me: I use forking as if these were bookmarks. So any metrics based on forks would be in my favor whether I care or not because of my personal and unique way to treat a fork. And in doing so, I also introduce a bias in any fork metrics for the projects I fork.\n\nWhat do GitHub Stars measure\n\nI take the stars as a measure of awareness, meaning that projects with lots of stars might be known to many people and projects with only a few stars may be relatively unknown.\n\nI try to not read more into it but I infer weakly from the number of stars that projects with only a few stars might not be well tested, might not be very mature, might not be popular, while projects with a large number of stars might be well tested, might be mature and might be popular. In general, I will compare all projects above a certain flexible threshold of the number of stars and then decide completely independent of the number of stars which project is the best for me. In short, it's only a hint to me.\n\nI think the general consensus here that stars are meaningless is a case of privileging theoretical a priori knowledge over empirical observation. True, the empirical case is sketchy and very low quality evidence, but I believe a lot of us can attest that our personal experience reflects a correlation between stars and significance of some kind; A significance that is usually popularity, which itself correlates with other good and bad traits. It is true that a lot of users might be using the stars in “non-standard” ways, but even that indicates some measure of popularity. And the important thing here is that the ecosystem is so large that it can tolerate a lot of noise. Even if %15 of users star completely randomly, it wouldn’t make the metric useless.\n\nOf course, whenever there is a heuristical signal, there is effort to fake and cheat. This is seen, e.g., in animals that sport colors of poison, while being completely harmless. And still, the signals endure; Since for the poisonous animals to signal, merely a differential benefit of being eaten less is enough. For the predators, merely surviving more by not eating potentially poisonous animals is enough. And the cheaters are enough of a minority to be able to freeride the signal.\n\nThis is, on a calm meditation, obvious and observed repeatedly in nature, society and the cyberspace. Instagram’s likes are a great example. People like (and not like) for a dizzying breadth of reasons. The Instagram bot ecosystem is teeming. Nepotism is the default behavior. And yet, likes signify popularity (even if only to some niches). And the more likes, the bigger these niches. Sure, I myself hate most of the popular stuff on Instagram, but that is besides the point. The highly liked posts are not at all random; They push the human animal’s buttons methodically.\n\nOf course, careful, good empirical investigations can shed more light on the correlations, but it’s dumb to reject something because you don’t understand its technical underpinnings. What’s the methodical research that shows you your brain’s conclusions are of any value?\n\nWe all need to accept that sometimes, we are under heavy technical debt. Ignoring obvious (though very imprecise and suspicious) empirical evidence is a frequent cause of intellectual folly."
