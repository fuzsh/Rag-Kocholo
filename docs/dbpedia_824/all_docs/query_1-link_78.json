        "text": "Taylor Swift’s music has returned to TikTok, undercutting her record label during its contract dispute with the social media app in order to benefit her upcoming album.\n\nUniversal Music Group Chief Executive Officer Lucian Grainge now really needs other music groups to join him in his fight when their contracts expire, or he loses much of his leverage. In the interim, he and his label bosses get to explain to their artists why Swift gets to play by a different set of rules.\n\nGrainge could try to paint Swift as selfish. After all, Swift once tangled with Spotify and Apple Music, pushing them to better compensate artists. Now, while her record label attempts a similar fight with TikTok, she wants no part of it."
