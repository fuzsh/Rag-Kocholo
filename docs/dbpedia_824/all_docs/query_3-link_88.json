        "text": "Ronda Rousey has her next television project.\n\nABC television today announced the return of the 70s and 80s show, “Battle of the Network Stars,” featuring former UFC women’s bantamweight champion Rousey and former NFL star DeMarcus Ware as coaches.\n\nThe show is said to feature more than 100 television stars from 14 networks and cable companies competing in events like tug of war, archery, kayak relay, and the obstacle course.\n\nThe show will air on Tuesdays from 9-10 p.m. starting June 29th, for ten weeks. It will be hosted by ESPN’s Mike Greenberg and Joe Tessitore. The original incarnation of the show aired from 1976 to 1988.\n\nRousey’s last television appearance was on an episode of NBC’s “Blindspot” earlier this month. She last fought in the UFC on December 30th, 2016, where she lost to Amanda Nunes in the first round. She hasn’t officially announced anything definitive about her MMA future, but Dana White has said that she probably won’t return to the sport."
