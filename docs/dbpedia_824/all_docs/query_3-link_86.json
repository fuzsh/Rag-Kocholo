        "text": "June 2 (UPI) -- Super Bowl 50 winner DeMarcus Ware and MMA fighter Ronda Rousey have been named the team captains for the revival of Battle of the Network Stars.\n\nESPN's Mike Greenberg and Joe Tessitore will host the 10-episode show, which is to return to ABC on June 29. The competition series originally ran 1976-88.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe next 100 competitors -- TV stars from 14 different network and cable companies -- are expected to be announced at a later date.\n\n\"If someone could go back in time and tell the 10-year-old me, glued to the television, watching Howard Cosell and all the biggest names in television running obstacle courses and playing tug of war, that someday he would be directly involved with Battle of the Network Stars, he would have said it was the coolest thing ever. Decades later, that's exactly how I feel,\" Greenberg said in a statement Thursday.\n\n\"We believe there is no format which is a better time machine than Battle of the Network Stars, plus the name itself fills you with nostalgia and a sense of positive energy -- like the beach party you really want to be invited to with your favorite people from TV. For this new version, the network vs. network format didn't make as much sense as fielding teams based on the characters people love from over the years to the current day -- Cops vs. TV Sitcoms, White House vs. Lawyers, TV Moms & Dads vs. TV Kids, etc. In this way, we'll get to see everyone's favorites from over the years, even if they spanned different networks at the time,\" added executive producer Andrew Glassman."
