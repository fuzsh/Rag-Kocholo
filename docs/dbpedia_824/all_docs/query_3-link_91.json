        "text": "Picture It. Pepperdine University. 1984. 24 television celebrities come together in the name of friendly competition. ABC, CBS, and NBC each bring 8 of their finest [sic] athletic talents together, all striving and hoping to win the coveted prize of… well, being called the winner. Nothing else, really.\n\nThis month David and Matthew break down The Battle Of The Network Stars XVI. Lisa Whelchel and Kim Fields contribute their immense talent and physical prowess to skyrocket NBC to last place. (D’Oh!) They are joined by the hotness of John James from Dynasty, Billy Moses from Falcon Crest, a pre-MacGyver Richard Dean Anderson from Emerald Point N.A.S. (!?!), Mark Harmon from St. Elsewhere, Michael J. Fox from Family Ties (yes, this is the year with THE SPEEDO), and a not-quite-a-movie-star-yet C. Thomas Howell from Two Marriages (!!??!!). And maybe some women were there, too. Tying this all together is legendary misogynistic filterless sports announcer-creep Howard Cosell and his illogical co-hosts Scott Baio and Debby Boone. If you’ve ever wanted to hear two gay men talk on and on about sports, this month’s show is for YOU!\n\n“TV Talkaholics” is a separate monthly podcast where we discuss episodes, series, and movies which feature members of the “Facts Of Life” cast.
