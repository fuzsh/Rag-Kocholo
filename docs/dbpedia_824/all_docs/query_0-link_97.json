MMA star Ronda Rousey and Super Bowl champ DeMarcus Ware, former linebacker for the Dallas Cowboys and Denver Broncos, will be coaches, and 100 celebrities will take part in the athletic competition.\n\nWhile the original saw a network versus network competition, the new Battle of the Network Stars features 20 teams of five, each one reflecting the celeb’s TV career. There’s a TV Kids team (Joey Lawrence, Lisa Whelchel and Modern Family’s Nolan Gould are on that one), another of TV Sex Symbols (Traci Bingham of Baywatch, Galen Gering of Days of Our Lives) and Troublemakers (Vivica A. Fox, Julie Benz of Buffy the Vampire Slayer).\n\nOther celebs taking part in the competition are Denise Richards, Lance Bass, Lou Ferrigno, Ian Ziering and Marlee Matlin.\n\nRelated: ABC’s ‘American Idol’ Auditions Start Aug. 17\n\nThe original Battle of the Network Stars ran on ABC from 1976 until 1988.\n\nThe new show promises a “fresh take” on the original’s sporting competitions, such as Tug of War, Archery and Obstacle Course.\n\nThe hosts are Mike Greenberg and Joe Tessitore of ESPN, with Cassidy Hubbarth and Cari Champion sideline reporting.\n\nBattle of the Network Stars is produced by Glassman Media and IMG, which also owns the format. The executive producers are Andrew Glassman, Will Staeger, Michael Antinoro and Chris Carlson."
