        "text": "In a year of reboot culture — “Fuller House,” “The X-Files,” “Ghostbusters” — it was perhaps inevitable that we should get a reboot election.\n\nHillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump are unprecedented presumptive nominees: the first woman and the first reality-TV host to lead a major party ticket. But they’re also two people whom America has been watching for what seems like forever.\n\nMr. Trump became a household name in the days of “Dynasty,” and his tale has remained a kind of ’80s prime-time soap of aspiration and ego. Mrs. Clinton became a national figure in 1992, and ever since then her story has been a button-pushing serial about issues of power and gender.\n\nOrdinarily, a nominating convention for a nonincumbent is about telling a new story. Not this year. For two weeks beginning July 18, Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton will each need to repackage a narrative that’s run longer than “Law & Order” into a brand-new, four-night mini-series.\n\nMr. Trump will go first. While it’s glib punditry to say that a nominee “needs to put on a show” at his convention, for him it amounts to proof of concept. He’s treated his showmanship as his chief qualification: Improvising meant he had good instincts; insulting opponents meant he was tough; shouting meant he wasn’t low-energy. In the primary, he cited his TV ratings the way another candidate might boast of balancing a state budget."
