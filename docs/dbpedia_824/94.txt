Long before the high-flying, big schlonging, E. coli-sponsored action of the 2024 Paris Olympics graced our TV screens, audiences flocked to watch another athletic competition play out on air: The Battle of the Network Stars.

From 1976 to 1988 (with a one-off season taking place in 2017) the Battle of the Network Stars put sitcom icons from ABC, NBC, and CBS to the test, tasking them with showing their athletic prowess — and their hot bods — in challenges like Volleyball, Tennis, Tandem Bike Race, and even a Baseball Dunk. And with exciting challenges came even more exciting photos, one capturing all the '70s glory of this iconic TV series.

From Robin Williams relaxing between events to Heather Locklear paddling for her life, here are 29 old-school photos from the Battle of the Network Stars that put the Olympics to shame.
