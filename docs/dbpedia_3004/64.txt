"Els Quatre Gats (4 GATS)" was a cafe bar operating from 1897 to 1903. It was a center of modernism with artists and Pablo Picasso was one of them. The young Picasso sketched and painted portraits of his friends from the El Quatre Gats set, and at the age of 19 many of these pieces were include at his first ever exhibition, hosted by El Quatre Gats in 1900. In 1981, El Quatre Gats was restored and reopened for 100th anniversary of the birth of Picasso, and it has been one of the most popular restaurants in the city.
