        "text": "Part and parcel of being in Barcelona is the necessity to stop off or meet up in one of its plethora of café-bars at one point or another.\n\nAll the Barcelona guide books may scream Els Quatre Gats (Historic haunt of Picasso et al) or some generic chain of “cosy” cafés, offering overpriced and unsatisfying fare.\n\nHowever this is not as good as it gets.\n\nSo without further introduction, the following are the best places to park yourself alone, or with friends, for an afternoon in one of Barcelona’s cafés.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nDeciding to take the name with a pinch of salt, the café Shhh! No Se Lo Digas a Nadie (Shhh! Don’t tell anyone) sits below the churched-up Plaça Virreina in Gracia.\n\nIt doesn’t offer much of a view (unless you count the waiters), but this below-street level Barcelona café sprawls into two backrooms, adorned with lamps, cushions and slightly ethnic paraphernalia. The menu is twee with a twist: experimental quiches (e.g. with courgette/emmental/coconut) and things with salads, along with a fantastic selection of heavy tarts and desserts. Its winning feature is a full tea menu, prompting guests to relax with a pot of tea and catch up with friends or just read the paper.\n\nMoving central to Sant Antoni market, the next café to be mentioned is a bit of a mixed bag. Els Tres Tombs café is featured in this article, not for its food or drinks, not for its service or even for its décor; but for the sole fact that it is a Barcelonian institution. Although recently renovated and with much better toilets, Tres Tombs café still retains its fed-up Spanish/Catalan bar vibe.\n\nThe waiters will not want to serve you; when they do, you may wish they hadn’t. Never order the wine. Be prepared for typical Barcelona fritanga, i.e. fried tapas. Open from six in the morning, it is also usually popular with “night-owls” who haven’t gone home yet. Nonetheless, while sitting on the café’s terrace you’re likely to get a real glimpse of the city, with Sant Antoni’s book market just across the road on a Sunday, for added Barcelona-café culture.\n\nThe art of shabby chic comes into play for the next offering, located on Rambla del Raval, in the heart of the infamous Raval district. Café de Les Delicies reminisces quaint café styling with its modernista shop front, mixing up the belle époque with the kitsch and some shabby wooden furniture. Sunlight streams in through the windows, thanks to the open palm-lined boulevard that is Rambla del Raval.\n\nThe menu is small but original, with sandwiches, croissants and more interesting tapas such as local cheeses dunked in seasoned olive oil. All this comes at reasonable prices. Café de Les Delicies is a quiet and relaxing spot to spend the morning in an otherwise “lively” Barcelona neighbourhood. Highlights include books, newspapers and a terrace at the front for smoking and people-watching.\n\nMaking a completely different entrance on the café scene, Federal café sprung up fairly recently for Barcelona standards, on a pretty street in Sant Antoni, bordering Poble Sec. A stunning three floors (counting the terrace) have been painstakingly designed to modern café perfection. Light and fashionably finished, it feels much like stepping into some trendy part of London’s Chelsea or Wimbledon Village, quite otherworldly for Barcelona.\n\nThe Australian owners have made sure this café is unique, right down to the organic menu of tasty platters and its friendly staff. It may be pricier than other Barcelona hangouts, but in Federal you get what you pay for. The place is a treat.\n\nSaving the best till last, Oviso café can be found tucked away on Plaça George Orwell (aka Plaza Trippi), near the bottom of Gótico. Its humble demeanour on the outside is deceiving; walk through to find a large, open lounge at the back, sporting “rustic” cave-painting, broad tables and speakeasy benches. This cool hippie-style joint serves up fresh fruit smoothies, picture-perfect burgers and a selection of sandwiches, veggie options, salads and crêpes. What’s more, in Oviso you can wile away the afternoon without overspending as it offers excellent value, served up by friendly, smiling staff.\n\nFind these Barcelona cafés on the Eurotrash and Treasure map below.\n\nShhh! Noselodigasanadie: Carrer de Torrijos, 53\n\nEls Tres Tombs: Ronda de Sant Antoni 2\n\nCafé de Les Delicies: Rambla Raval 47\n\nFederal: Carrer del Parlament 39\n\nOviso: Carrer d’Arai 5"
