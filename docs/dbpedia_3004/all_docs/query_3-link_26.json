        "text": "Chris Pearrow\n\nA must for a drink in Barcelona\n\nEls 4 Gats (or, \"The Four Cats\" in English) is one of the most historic bar-restaurants in the city of Barcelona. The establishment was opened in 1897 and was for turn-of-the-century Catalan Modernism what cafes like La Rotonde were for artists in 1920's Paris. It was a meeting place to trade ideas, engage in wine-fueled debates, and see exhibits up then-unknown artists like Pablo Picasso.\n\nThese days, El 4 Gats is more of a meeting place for fanny-packed tourists than for artists and intellectuals, but it's still worth a stop to have a quick drink in downtown Barcelona.\n\nRead more\n\nLike\n\nDónde vamos Eva\n\nBohemian Barcelona\n\nExcellent\n\nNo one can say he or she has visited Barcelona without going to Els 4 Gats (the four cats). A lovely place, spectacular from the outside, despite being squeezed in the very narrow Montsió street that goes unseen between the luminous signs of Portal de l'Angel and the endless clothing shops.\n\nIt's a place of worship for many from Barcelona. Charged with culture and history, modernism, bohemia, Picasso, Pere Romeu, Ramón Casas, Albéniz or Granados, among others. It is currently a beautiful and well-known bar-restaurant, full or art by painters like Rusiñol. It's run by one of the most prestigious groups in Barcelona.\n\nRead more\n\n+4\n\nLike\n\nGonzalo Moreno\n\nThe high point of your walk in the Gothic Quarter\n\nIt is in many guides of Barcelona but that doesn't mean it's lost its charm. It is something like Café Gijón in Madrid but set in a more beautiful building. And it is located on the ground floor of Casa Martí, a work of the genius José Puig i Cadafalch. I can talk about the place as a coffee shop, I only had a beer and thought about the works hanging on the wall for a minute (of artists like Picasso -- who was a frequent client of the cafeteria) or the writers like Rubén Dario. Don't miss it! It will be the high point of a nice walk in the Gothic Quarter.\n\n+2\n\nLike\n\njuanmarblaz\n\n100% recommended\n\nI totally recommend a coffee in the restaurant Els 4 Gats. Many famous people used to gather there. The restaurant is decorated with articles and pictures of those artists and works of Picasso.\n\nLike\n\nsayuri mung\n\nImpressive!!\n\nI worked there for 6 months, I was a cleaner and it was a pleasure being surrounded by those frames. The walls preserve art and wisdom. I recommend going upstairs, you can see everything better and you have a really good angle to take pictures!\n\nLike\n\nGennaro Costabile\n\nNice\n\nGreat\n\nLike\n\nHéctor www.mibauldeblogs.com\n\nExcellent\n\n+6\n\nSee original\n\nLike\n\nChaCh'\n\n+4\n\nSee original\n\nLike\n\nMónica Compte Pallarés\n\nSee original\n\nLike\n\nEspai Barcelona\n\nSee original\n\nLike\n\nAngel B\n\nNot recommendable\n\nSee original\n\nLike\n\nJavier Arruñada\n\nSee original\n\nLike\n\nCarlos Olmo\n\nSee original\n\nLike\n\nMarcela Rodriguez\n\nExcellent\n\nSee original\n\nLike\n\nAsun Sepulveda\n\nGood\n\nSee original\n\nLike"
