        "text": "Family\n\nPablo Picasso with his sister Lola, 1889\n\nThe person the world knows as Pablo Picasso [5][6] (/ˈpaβlo piˈkaso/[1]) was born Pablo Diego José Francisco de Paula Juan Nepomuceno María de los Remedios Cipriano de la Santísima Trinidad Ruiz y Picasso to Jose Ruiz Blasco and Maria Picasso Lopez October 25, 1881 in Málaga, Spain.[7][2][3][4] His father was a painter and art instruction.[2][4]\n\nPablo loved art from a young age, and his father instructed him early, seeing his talent.[2][4] By the age of 13, his skill had surpassed his father's.[4] At that same age, Pablo was admitted the the school his father was teaching at, Barcelona's School of Fine Arts.[4] By age 16, he was at Madrid's Royal Academy of San Fernando.[4] He disliked school, though, and dropped out.[4]\n\nOn July 12, 1918, at 11 in the morning, Pablo Picasso and Olga Khokhlova a ballerina from Nejine, Russia (currently in Ukraine) were married. [8][2]. They had one son, Paulo, together and divorced in 1927.[2] His second wife was Jacqueline Roque, whom he married in 1961.[2]\n\nPablo had several mistresses through his lifetime, and children with many of them.[2] While still married to Olga, he began his long-term relationship with mistress Marie-Thérèse Walter.[2] They had a daughter named Maya together.[2] During his \"Rose\" period, he was in love with Fernande Olivier.[2] Another relationship with Dora Maar was both professional and romantic.[2] His relationship with Françoise Gilot gave him two more children, Claude and Paloma.[2]\n\nArtist\n\nPablo is best known for his cubist style, something he was the innovator of along with Georges Braque.[2][3][4] Even within that definition, his style varied greatly throughout his lifetime, encompassing at any given time cubism, neoclassicism, surrealism, and expressionism.[3] He attributed this to wanting to give each subject what he felt was best-never considering whether it fit within a given \"style\" of art.[2] Moving even further away from the standard art of the day, Picasso's later works were considered \"Synthetic Cubism\", involving a more collage-based composition.[2] He produced over 20,000 works of art during his lifetime.[3][4]\n\nThe Old Guitarist (1903)\n\nPicasso's art is often broken into periods, many based on the primary palette he used.[2] His best known is his \"Blue\" period, called both because of the colors he used (blue and green were most prominent) and because he was dealing with very dark emotions, which were reflected in his art.[2] A close friend from an artistic group he was part of that met regularly at the café Els Quatre Gats (The Four Cats), Catalan Carlos Casagemas' suicide was a major influence.[3].\n\nHis \"Rose\" period came after the depression had passed and involved warmer colors.[2] He was in Paris during this time and attracted the interest of Gertrude and Leo Stein as patrons.[3]\n\nDuring the Twenties, his work was more Realist in nature, and that is considered his \"Classical Period.\"[2] After that, he worked in art inspired by Cubism, called Surrealism.[2]\n\nAfter World War II, Picasso became very political, joining the Communist Party.[2] He received the Lenin Peace Prize in 1950 and again in 1961.[2] Throughout his entire life, he would work at his art, never stopping, due to the superstitious fear that his art kept him alive.[2]\n\nLegacy\n\nPablo Picasso died April 8, 1973 in Mougins, France.[2] He is interred at the Château of Vauvenargues near Aix-en-Provence.\n\nHis vast estate is being administered by Claude Ruiz (Gilot) Picasso, his only surviving son by his mistress of 10 years, Francoise (Gilot) Salk.\n\nResearch Notes\n\nSee here for the merged away data of the clear duplicate created in June 2021.
