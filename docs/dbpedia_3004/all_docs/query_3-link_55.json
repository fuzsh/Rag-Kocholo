        "text": "1881 Pablo Picasso is born in Malaga(Spain) on October 25. His father Don José Ruiz y Blasco was painter. Picasso showed a passion and a skill for drawing from an early age.\n\n1891 The family Picasso moved to A Coruña, where father became a professor at the School of Fine Arts.\n\n1895 Family moved to Barcelona, where Ruiz took a position at its School of Fine Arts. Picasso thrived in the city, regarding it in times of sadness or nostalgia as his true home.\n\n1897 Picasso moved to Madrid, where he enrolled in Royal Academy of San Fernando. Most of the time in Madrid, Picasso studied the works of the great Spanish painters at the Prado Museum.\n\n1989 Picasso returned to Barcelona enters the society of artists Els Quatre Gats.\n\n1900 In the cafe \"Els Quatre Gatsare\" two first solo exhibition of paintings by Picasso.\n\n1901-1904 Blue Period, characterized by somber paintings rendered in shades of blue and blue-green, only occasionally warmed by other colours, began either in Spain in early 1901, or in Paris in the second half of the year. Many paintings of gaunt mothers with children date from the Blue Period, during which Picasso divided his time between Barcelona and Paris. In his austere use of color and sometimes doleful subject matter – prostitutes and beggars are frequent subjects – Picasso was influenced by a trip through Spain and by the suicide of his friend Carlos Casagemas.\n\n1904-1906 The Rose Period is characterised by a more cheery style with orange and pink colours, and featuring many circus people, acrobats and harlequins known in France as saltimbanques. The harlequin, a comedic character usually depicted in checkered patterned clothing, became a personal symbol for Picasso.\n\n1907-1909 African-influenced Period begins with the two figures on the right in his painting, Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, which were inspired by African artefacts. Formal ideas developed during this period lead directly into the Cubist period that follows.\n\n1909-1912 Picasso entertained a distinguished coterie of friends in the Montmartre(Paris) and Montparnasse quarters, including André Breton, poet Guillaume Apollinaire, writer Alfred Jarry, and Gertrude Stein. Analytic cubism is a style of painting Picasso developed with Georges Braque using monochrome brownish and neutral colours. Both artists took apart objects and \"analyzed\" them in terms of their shapes. Picasso and Braque's paintings at this time share many similarities.\n\n1914 At the outbreak of World War I Picasso lived in Avignon.\n\n1912-1919 Synthetic cubism was a further development of the genre, in which cut paper fragments – often wallpaper or portions of newspaper pages – were pasted into compositions, marking the first use of collage in fine art.\n\n1916 Picasso starts cooperation with the Russian ballet on the production of Parade.\n\n1918 In the summer, Picasso married Olga Khokhlova, a ballerina with Sergei Diaghilev's troupe, for whom Picasso was designing a ballet, Erik Satie's Parade, in Rome; they spent their honeymoon near Biarritz in the villa of glamorous Chilean art patron Eugenia Errázuriz."
