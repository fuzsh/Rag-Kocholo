        "text": "Barcelona is truly the city that has it all. Firstly, one must emphasize the culinary culture, which, in my opinion, is out of this world — and at a price that would leave most Danes astonished. But the city’s architecture is also of a caliber you won’t find anywhere else in the world. Moreover, the southern atmosphere combined with the warmth is always something not to be underestimated. If you’re torn between a city break and a trip to the warmth of the south — well, Barcelona is the city that encompasses both.\n\nThe Most Important Meal of the Day\n\nI’m, of course, talking about breakfast. In my case, it often consists of a croissant and a cup of coffee — and fortunately, Barcelona caters quite well to my preferences.\n\nWhere Barcelona and I differ is the time of day to have the first meal. I prefer it a bit earlier than the norm in Barcelona. Most cafes here open around noon, but if, like me, you want to make the most of the day, I have a couple of lovely places for you to consider.\n\nBar Cervantes in the Gothic Quarter\n\nAuthentic, local, and great value for money.\n\nAnd they open at 7:30 as of now — a fantastic way to observe the city slowly waking up.\n\nDuring the warm periods of the year, Bar Cervantes also offers outdoor seating in the sun.\n\nThey serve a robust cup of coffee and freshly squeezed orange juice, which can be enjoyed with a croissant or a larger English breakfast if you need to fuel up for the day’s adventures.\n\nThe staff is hospitable, friendly, and loud in the right southern way. Most guests are locals, giving the place a cozy and homely atmosphere.\n\nEl Flako Corn Flakes & Co\n\nGimmicky but cozy.\n\nIf you’re into second breakfast, or if you’re a snoozer in the morning — here’s a place that opens a bit later (9:30) and offers a more unusual breakfast. El Flako is a breakfast bar that primarily offers cereals and good coffee.\n\nIt might seem like a well-executed gimmick, but the place has upheld its standard since 2017. Unless you show up before 10, the likelihood of queues and a full restaurant is quite high. El Flako is well-frequented, with both tourists and locals in the small café with fewer than 20 seats.\n\nThe food is at a relatively high level, especially considering the focus on breakfast products. El Flako has over 200 different cereals, 80 different toppings, and 20 different types of milk. And they are happy to recommend what pairs best.\n\nEn Aparte, French Bistro in El Born\n\nA lovely breakfast in peace.\n\nAnother breakfast place to visit in Barcelona is En Aparte. So, if you’ve had enough at El Flako and Cervantes, save this place in the El Born area for another day.\n\nEn Aparte is calm despite its location directly on a square. There’s some activity, but not compared to many other places in Barcelona. En Aparte is a French bistro bar, and it certainly lives up to the French kitchen. Most of the ingredients are imported from France, providing ample opportunity for French cheeses and sausages. It may seem like blasphemy to eat such French food in the midst of Barcelona, but occasionally, a bit of variation is needed.\n\nArt Hunt in Barcelona\n\nWhen everyone else recommends tourist traps, let’s go a different way.\n\nBarcelona has many beautiful and interesting tourist attractions — I certainly don’t underestimate that. I am overwhelmed by Gaudi’s architecture, especially La Sagrada Familia, which is, of course, a must-see — but sometimes, you have to take different paths.\n\nBarcelona is a city where those different paths can lead to almost as overwhelming experiences as Gaudi’s masterpieces. If you like graphic design and art, there are good opportunities to visit a few shops and galleries where you can also get a little souvenir to take home.\n\nA couple of suggestions for your art or graphic design hunt could be Heyshop and Micelanea, which are not far from each other. And if you’re in the El Born area, you don’t need guidance from here, as there are galleries around every street corner.\n\nLa Boqueria\n\nThe Gem of Barcelona\n\nLa Boqueria literally has everything you dream a Spanish market can offer. And the best part is, you can taste the whole palette since the prices are not particularly high. It generally seems like there’s an understanding that visitors want to try a bit of everything.\n\nThe market is open Monday to Saturday from early morning (7 am) and doesn’t close until 5 pm — but remember that siesta might occur midday.\n\nWhile you’re at La Boqueria, I can only recommend trying Jamón Ibérico Bellota, which is one of the best cured hams on the market. It is made from the ham of black-footed pigs. The pigs roam over much more square footage than usual and are allowed to eat acorns in the last half-year before slaughter. The ham is air-dried for up to 3 years before it hits the market. There are several places in Barcelona where you can find Jamón Ibérico Bellota, but at La Boqueria, it’s hard to miss.\n\nTwo Schmucks on a Terrace\n\nA trendy place with super tasty drinks and food.\n\nThe place is incredibly cozy and filled with young creative people. It’s a good place to naturally strike up a conversation with others while trying different items from the menu.\n\nTwo Schmucks specializes in delicious drinks, and the waiter is happy to have a drink with you if it’s not too busy. The prices are low, especially considering the quite high level.\n\nTwo Schmucks also has a couple of sisters in the city, namely Lucky Schmucks and the original Two Schmucks. Two Schmucks on a Terrace is just the coziest place in the middle of the day, especially if the weather allows for outdoor seating.\n\nLate Evening Hours in Barcelona\n\nIn Barcelona, people dine late. Locals typically don’t hit the restaurants until around 9 pm, so in Spain, drinks and dinner can easily go hand in hand — as people usually don’t leave the table until midnight. So, while you wait to go out for dinner, find a place where you can sit and sip on a bottle of wine or a pitcher of Sangria. Here are a couple of good suggestions for where to dine in Barcelona. They are generally on the pricier side, especially for locals\n\nNote: Even if you’re not visiting during the peak season, it’s generally a good idea to make a reservation. At least that’s my experience, especially at the three places I recommend here.\n\nTragaluz\n\nPerhaps the Best Meal in Barcelona\n\nMediterranean cuisine in well-designed surroundings.\n\nThe food at Tragaluz is among the most delicious I have ever been served. I can only recommend that everyone traveling to Barcelona spend an evening there. Especially the starters are exciting, as they lean towards the more ‘experimental’ side. The main courses and especially the desserts are a bit more classic. Good craftsmanship and delightful food. It’s as simple as that.\n\nTragaluz is Italian-inspired with a clear Spanish touch. You rarely get such good Italian food outside of Italy. It’s located close to La Rambla (unfortunately), but in a very nice and cozy side street. The surroundings and atmosphere in the restaurant are, as the subtitle suggests, very beautiful and architectural. There is a pleasant touch of warmth and coziness — but there’s no doubt that it’s a relatively exclusive place.\n\nEls Quatre Gats\n\nAn Institution in Barcelona\n\nTraditional Catalan institution with good food!\n\nEls Quatre Gats has been in Barcelona for many years (since 1897), and even people who have no connection to Barcelona know the place. The place has a long history — in fact, there’s a Wikipedia page just about it.\n\nThroughout its many viable years, Els Quatre Gats has served as a cabaret, a hotel, and, not least, a café/restaurant. Frequented by great artists such as Pablo Picasso.\n\nIf only the walls could talk, then I would have even more exciting things to say about this place. But I can’t say anything bad about Els Quatre Gats, except that their beef tartare is too large.\n\nThe restaurant is buzzing with life, and it is usually well-filled on most days on both floors. The acoustics are not too great, but that’s compensated for by some live music from a brilliant pianist. At least when I was there.\n\nThe food is rustic Spanish but with hints from the French kitchen. They have, for example, a Crema Catalana that is strongly inspired by the classic French Crème brûlée.\n\nThe price is, for a local, probably in the expensive league, but with a Danish income, it’s hard to grasp how much and how good food you can get at such a legendary place for relatively few coins.\n\nHigh recommendation from me, but again: remember to make a reservation.\n\nCatalina Café\n\nDrinks and New Friends\n\nThe right clientele in Barcelona. A final small bonus to an otherwise long text about Barcelona, namely Catalina Café.\n\nThe café operates as… well, a café during the daytime, but when the darkness falls, it’s one of those places filled with people from the slightly more creative segment — and are there cozier people to strike up a conversation with over a beer or a pitcher of sangria? My memory is starting to fail me a bit when I try to recall how the experience at Catalina Café was — but I see that as a good sign.\n\nThe fun part is, no matter how late you arrive, there are still guests inside the restaurant eating, all while all the chairs, tables, and the nearby green area are completely filled."
