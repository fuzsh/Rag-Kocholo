Picasso's life in Barcelona was very much in the medieval part of Barcelona, called Ciutat Vella and down around the Barcelona harbour and Port Vell.\n\nThe Picasso family first lived for a few months on street Passeig Isabel II, 4. They then moved to the nearby street Carrer de la Reina Cristina 3, which is where they lived when Picasso was an art student at the La Llotja School of Fine Arts for two years. Artist Joan Miró later studied at the same school.\n\nArticle continues under ads\n\nIn 1986 the Picasso family moved to Carrer de la Mercè 3 and young Picasso worked in his first studio on Carrer de la Plata 4. Today this is a 5 star boutique hotel called Hotel Serras.\n\nIn 1897 the Barcelona cafe and restaurant Els Quatre Gats opened on Carrer de Montsió 3. This cafe cbecame a popular hang-out for Picasso and his artist friends.\n\nOne of Picasso's first exhibitions was at Els Quatre Gats. Picasso's also designed the menu for the Els Quatre Gats and due to his fame the artwork is still in use at the cafe to this day. Pablo Picasso studied at the Barcelona art school, La Llotja (now called the Reial Acadèmia Catalana de Belles Arts de Sant Jordi) and worked in various studios during his years in Barcelona.\n\nNone of the studio locations have Picasso exhibits now, but it’s fun to walk in his footsteps his early years in Barcelona and get a feel for the kind of life he must have lived. All the locations of Picasso studios are in Barcelona's old city Cuitat Vella.\n\nPicasso's studios in Barcelona\n\nMap Carrer de la Plata, 3\n\nMap Carrer d’Escudellers Blancs\n\nMap Nou de la Rambla 10\n\nMap Carrer de Comerç 28\n\nPicasso also lived at Riera de Sant Joan 17 - a street that no longer exists. It was demolished when Via Laietana street was built in 1907. In April 1904 Picasso moved to Paris. He returned for brief stays on various occasions, but he never lived in Barcelona again.\n\nThe Barcelona Picasso Museum is very much an expression of his time in Barcelona. It houses the most important collection of his early work in the world. You can also find ceramic works by Picasso in the Barcelona ceramico museum\n\nThe world's greatest artist, Pablo Ruiz Picasso, died of a heart attack at the grand age of 91 on 8th April 1973 at his hilltop villa Notre-Dame-de-Vie located in Mougins, France. He was buried on the 10th April 1973 in the gardens of his castle, Château de Vauvenargues in Bouches-du-Rhône which is near Aix-en-Provence in France.\n\nArticle continues under ads\n\nPicasso's grave is adorned with his sculpture 'Woman with the vase' (1933) which was first exhibited during the World exhibition of 1937 in Paris. The Château de Vauvenargues property is still owned by the Picasso family and until 2009 was not open to the public.\n\nIn 2009 for the first time the building was partially open to the public for the summer by Catherine Hutin, daughter of Jacqueline Picasso.
