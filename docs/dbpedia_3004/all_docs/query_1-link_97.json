        "text": "Gothic Quarter | €640,000 ($690,000)\n\nA redesigned two-bedroom apartment close to cafes, museums and landmarks.\n\nThis newly rebuilt two-bedroom apartment is in an 1860 building in the Old City’s Gothic Quarter, with sidewalk cafes and tapas bars lining labyrinthine streets. Medieval landmarks include the remains of the Roman wall, Barcelona City Hall and the ancient Jewish quarter, including parts of the former Major Synagogue, which predates the 1391 anti-Jewish riots. The apartment is also close to the Picasso Museum, at the heart of the restored Berenguer d’Aguilar Palace. The Moco Museum is next door in the 16th-century Palacio Cervelló.\n\nFor oysters, octopus or paella, Els Quatre Gats, a cafe founded in 1897, is tucked down a side street. A haven for modernist artists, the cafe hired Pablo Picasso for his first commissioned work in the early 1900s, designing the menu’s front cover.\n\nSant Josep market, better known as the voluminous “La Boqueria,” is a five-minute walk along Las Ramblas, which is lined with stalls selling flowers and food. The closest metro stop is Drassanes line 3, just off Las Ramblas in Barcelona’s Old City. The bus at Placa de Catalunya is a minute from the apartment.\n\nSize: 1,227 square feet\n\nPrice per Square foot: $562"
