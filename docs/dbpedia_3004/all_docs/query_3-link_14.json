        "text": "One of the more unique and historically interesting cafes I was able to visit here in Barcelona was Els Quatre Gats, Catalan for “The Four Cats” and often written as Els 4 Gatts. It is a café in Barcelona that opened on June 12th, 1897. Throughout it’s history, it has also operated as a hostel, a cabaret, a pub and a restaurant. Active until 1903, 4 CATS became one of the main symbols of Modernism in Barcelona.\n\nThe artist Ramon Casas I Carbo largely financed this bar on the ground floor of C1asa Marti (1896), a building by the architect Josep Puig I Cadafalch in Carrer Montsió, which is located near the center of Barcelona. Els Quatre Gats was reconstructed during the transition to democracy in 1978.\n\nSomething that draws visitors from all over to this small café is the ambiance and background knowledge that a previous frequent visitor was the famous Pablo Picasso. Picasso was an avid visitor of this pub in his early art career. Other major artists who met in this cafe were Santiago Rusiñol, Miquel Utrillo as well as the sculptor Julio Gonzalez. I enjoyed this café very much and appreciated the important people that visited it before me. Although it was a little overpriced, I enjoyed myself all the same and the service was good as well. I felt extremely cozy drinking my tea and admiring the atmosphere."
