        "text": "He studied at the School of Fine Arts in La Coruña, where his father worked. Later, he studied for two years at the School of Fine Arts of La Lonja in Barcelona.\n\nHe was one of the artists who frequented Els Quatre Gats in Barcelona, a meeting place for avant-garde art, and where he held his first individual exhibition. In 1900 he travels for the first time to Paris, a central place for the artists of the time, accompanied by Carles Casagemas, whose suicide will be the trigger of Picasso’s blue period. After several trips he settles in Paris, in the bohemian district of Montmartre, from where he will begin his Rose period, a consequence of frequenting the Cirque Medrano and his relationship with Fernande Olivier. In 1907 he explores for the first time the compositional possibilities of cubism with the work Les Senyoretes d’Avinyò, marking the beginning of a very prolific and interesting stage in his career.\n\nFollowing the bombing of Guernika, Picasso conceived one of his most important works: Guernica (1937), which was presented at the Spanish Pavilion of the International Exhibition in Paris in 1937, in the context of the Spanish Civil War.\n\nThe Suñol Soler Collection includes the work Buste de femme à la bluse jaune (1943), which was part of the exhibition Pablo Picasso, Paul Eluard. A sublime friendship organized by the Picasso Museum in Barcelona and the Paul Eluard Museum in Paris, venues where the work traveled in 2019 and 2023."
