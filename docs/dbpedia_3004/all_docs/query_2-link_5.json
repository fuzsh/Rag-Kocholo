        "text": "Walking back to our room after lunch Rachael took us a few blocks out of the way to show me a nearby coffee and pastry place that opens at 6, a spot she thought I might like to check out for breakfast. She misremembered just where it was though and took us down a side lane one block too soon.\n\nWhich was lucky, because otherwise we would likely never have stumbled across the 4 Cats, a restaurant I was immediately attracted to because of the painting of two cyclists on a tandem. We checked out the menu, liked the looks of that as well, so we made a reservation for this evening.\n\nsince we don’t read enough guide books, neither of us had heard of the 4 Cats before, so we were surprised to see that we’d stumbled into one of the best known restaurants in the city. Established in the late 1800’s by a group of modernist artists, it was famous on the cultural circuit at the turn of the century here, and it was the site for Picasso’s first art showing.\n\nThe restaurant closed after only a few years but was restored and reopened about eighty years later, maintaining the original atmosphere. It’s a fascinating place and feels like you’re dining in a Belle Époque museum. It’s a delight just sitting there staring at the walls and elegant sight-lines. And the food was a delight too. It’s only the second day of the tour, but I’m confident this will be one of our most memorable meals."
