        "text": "“Els Quatre Gats” is a Catalan phrase meaning, as you can probably imagine, “The Four Cats”. Well, that’s the literal translation. It’s actually derived from a more nuanced expression which refers to people who are perceived as outsiders or misfits. The man who originally opened this little place in the famous Casa Martí modelled it after a Parisian cafe he had worked in called Le Chat Noir, whose welcoming atmosphere and appeal to eccentricity he greatly admired. His approach certainly had the desired effect: not long after its opening in June 1897, it became a popular gathering point for some of the great Spanish avant-garde artists of the day, including Pablo Picasso and Ramon Casas I Carbó, and the great architect Antoní Gaudí.\n\nThe Cafe’s Renaissance\n\nUnfortunately, the owner’s artistic enthusiasm wasn’t matched by his business know-how, and the cafe went under in 1903. But nearly 90 years later, three prominent businessmen decided that Els Quatre Gats was an indispensable part of Barcelona’s heritage, and it was proudly reopened in 1991.\n\nPablo’s Poster\n\nStrolling up the Carrer d’Espolsa-sacs, you’ll see the cafe marked by a poster which was designed by Picasso himself. Inside, the place is warmly lit, finished in polished wood, and has a spacious upper balcony level overlooking the main floor. Dinner isn’t cheap, but the set menu at lunchtime is reasonably priced and will certainly do a good job of filling you up. If you want to experience the place but aren’t feeling like a meal, grab a cup of coffee or a slice of cake in the adjacent cafe."
