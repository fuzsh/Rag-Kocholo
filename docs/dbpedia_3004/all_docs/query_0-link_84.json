        "text": "Morphology and syntax of Catalan\n\nCatalan grammar, the morphology and syntax of the Catalan language, is similar to the grammar of most other Romance languages. Catalan is a relatively synthetic, fusional language. Features include:\n\nUse of definite and indefinite articles.\n\nNouns, adjectives, pronouns and articles are inflected for gender (masculine and feminine) and number (singular and plural). The numerals 'one', 'two' and the numeral 'hundred' from two-hundred onwards are also inflected for gender.\n\nHighly inflected verbs, for person, number, tense, aspect, and mood (including a subjunctive).\n\nWord order is freer than in English.\n\nSome distinctive features of Catalan among Romance languages include the general lack of masculine markers (like Italian -o), a trait shared with French and Occitan; and the fact that the remote preterite tense of verbs is usually formed with a periphrasis consisting of the verb \"to go\" plus infinitive.\n\nCatalan has two types of article, definite and indefinite. They are declined for gender and number, and must agree with the noun they qualify. As with other Romance languages, Catalan articles are subject to complex elision and contraction processes.\n\nThe inflection of articles is complex, especially because of frequent elision, but is similar to neighboring languages. Catalan has more preposition–article contractions than Spanish, like dels (\"of + the [plural]\"), but fewer than Italian (which has sul, col, nel, etc.).\n\nThe tables below summarize the forms of the definite article, its elisions, and its contractions.\n\nDefinite article\n\n(elided forms in brackets) masculine feminine singular el (l') la (l') plural els les\n\nContractions of the definite article preposition a de per article el al (a l') del (de l') pel (per l') els als dels pels\n\nThe masculine singular form is el. The initial vowel is elided before a vowel or h, yielding to l'.\n\nEl pare. L'avi.\n\n\"The father.\" \"The grandfather.\"\n\nEl is not elided if the word begins with semivocalic (h)i- [j].\n\nEl iode. El hiat.\n\n\"The iodine.\" \"The hiatus\"\n\nThe masculine plural form is els. Both el and els combine with the prepositions a \"to\", de \"of\", and per \"for\", yielding the contractions al, als, del, dels, pel, pels.\n\nHo dic al pare.\n\n\"I say it to the father.\" (\"I say it to my father\")\n\nAixò és del noi.\n\n\"This is of the boy.\" (\"This belongs to the boy\")\n\nCorria pels camins.\n\n\"I ran through the paths.\" (\"I ran along the paths\")\n\nEl does not contract with the aforementioned prepositions if the following word begins with vowel or h.\n\nPorta-ho a l'avi.\n\n\"Bring this to the grandfather.\"\n\nBaixa de l'arbre.\n\n\"Get down from the tree.\"\n\nThe feminine singular form is la. The final vowel is elided before a vowel or h, yielding l'.\n\nLa mare. L'àvia\n\n\"The mother.\" \"The grandmother\"\n\nLa is not contracted if the word begins with unstressed (h)i-, or (h)u-.\n\nLa idea. La hipòtesi. La unitat. La humitat.\n\n\"The idea.\" \"The hypothesis.\" \"The unit.\" \"The humidity.\"\n\nLa is not elided with the words una \"one (hour)\", host \"hueste\", and ira \"wrath\"; as well as with words beginning with the Greek prefix a-, like asimetria \"asymmetry\".\n\nThe feminine plural form is les.\n\nFeminine articles are not contracted with prepositions.\n\nForenames and surnames must carry a definite article. In addition to the ordinary singular forms, alternative forms derived from the Latin vocative domine can be used. The elision rules are the same for el and la.\n\nPersonal article\n\n(elided forms in brackets) masculine feminine en (n') na (n')\n\nEl Joan. L'Andreu. La Mercè. La Isabel. L'Olga.\n\nEn Joan. N'Andreu. Na Mercè. Na Isabel. N'Olga.\n\nIn Western Catalonia the dialectal versions lo and los are used instead of el and els.\n\nIn some regions, especially in the Balearic islands, the definite article derives from the Latin determiner ipse. These forms are referred to as articles salats. Similar forms are found in Sardinian and some varieties of Occitan.\n\nBalearic definite article masculine feminine singular es (s') sa (s') plural es, ets ses\n\nBalearic definite article + \"amb\" (with) masculine feminine singular amb so amb sa (amb s') plural amb sos amb ses\n\nThe table below summarize the forms of the indefinite article. Indefinite articles are not elided nor contracted.\n\nIndefinite article masculine feminine singular un una plural uns unes\n\nMost adjectives, and a fair number of nouns, inflect for gender. This usually follows a regular pattern of endings. The two main patterns are generally referred to as \"four-form\" and \"two-form\" adjectives. Four-form adjectives have distinct masculine and feminine forms, whereas two-form adjectives have the same form for both masculine and feminine. They are derived from the Latin first/second, and the third declension respectively. Many nouns follow the four-form inflection, but some may follow the two-form inflection. Some are irregular in some way.\n\nFour-form adjective\n\nverd (\"green\") masculine feminine singular verd verda plural verds verdes\n\nTwo-form adjective\n\nindiferent (\"indifferent\") masculine feminine singular indiferent plural indiferents\n\nSimilar to French, but unlike Portuguese, Spanish or Italian, the Latin/Romance final -o and -e have disappeared. Thus, the alternance of -o/-a in the four-form words has been substituted by -/-a. There are only a few exceptions, like minso/minsa (\"scarce\").\n\nAmong nouns, Catalan has few suppletive couplets, like Italian and Spanish, and unlike French. Thus, Catalan has noi/noia (\"boy\"/\"girl\") and gall/gallina (\"cock\"/\"chicken\"), whereas French has garçon/fille and coq/poule.\n\nThere is a tendency to inflect adjectives as four-form instead of two-form, something that is prevalent in Occitan and standard in French. Thus, alongside traditional two-form bullent/bullent (\"boiling\"), one can also find four-form bullent/bullenta.\n\nMany not completely predictable morphological alternations may occur between masculine and feminine, like:\n\nAffrication: boig/boja (\"insane\") vs. lleig/lletja (\"ugly\")\n\nLoss of n: pla/plana (\"flat\") vs. segon/segona (\"second\")\n\nFinal obstruent devoicing: sentit/sentida (\"felt\") vs. dit/dita (\"said\") vs. fred/freda (\"cold\")\n\nIn words that end in a sibilant sound, the masculine plural ending is -os instead of just -s. Feminines still have -es or, if they follow the two-form declension, no ending at all. Compare: el pols/els polsos (\"the pulse\"/\"the pulses\") vs. la pols/les pols (\"the dust\"/\"the dusts\").\n\nAdjectives that end in -ç follow the two-form declension in the singular, but four-form in the plural, so that they actually have three forms:\n\nAdjective in -ç\n\nfeliç (\"happy\") masculine feminine singular feliç plural feliços felices\n\nMain article: Catalan nouns\n\nCatalan nouns are inflected for gender (masculine or feminine), and number (singular or plural). There is no case inflection. Articles and adjectives agree in gender and number with the noun they refer to.\n\nUsually, masculine nouns are unmarked, feminine nouns carry the suffix -a; and the plural is marked with the suffix -s, which makes the feminine ending turn into -e-. Thus, the most common declension paradigm for Catalan names is the one that follows:\n\nExample:\n\ndeclension of gat \"cat\" masculine feminine singular gat gata plural gats gates\n\nThe grammatical gender of a Catalan noun does not necessarily correspond with the real-life object's biological sex (or lack thereof). Nouns denoting a person, such as home \"man\" or dona \"woman\", generally agree with the natural gender of what is described. However, Catalan assigns gender to nouns without natural gender in arbitrary fashion. For example, the word tamboret (\"stool\") is masculine, while the word cadira (\"chair\") is feminine.\n\nLiving beings of the same species usually are designed by two nouns: one of masculine grammatical gender for biologically male individuals, and one of feminine grammatical gender for biologically female individuals. Both names, masculine and feminine, are usually only differentiated by their ending; sometimes the second is derived from the first or vice versa. Rarely, both come from different roots.\n\nMost times the feminine form is created by appending the suffix -a to the unmarked masculine form.\n\nNoi → noia. Avi → àvia.\n\n\"Boy – girl.\" \"Grandfather – grandmother.\"\n\nIf the masculine form ends in -t, -p, -f, -s, the addition of the feminine suffix -a may cause these consonants to become voiced to -d-, -b-, -v-, -s-; or not. There are no rules to deduce the change.\n\nbecomes voiced remains unvoiced change masculine feminine gloss masculine feminine gloss ⟨-t⟩ → ⟨-d-⟩\n\n/t/ → /ð/ nebot neboda \"nephew – niece\" nét neta \"grandson – granddaughter\" ⟨-p⟩ → ⟨-b-⟩\n\n/p/ → /β/ llop lloba \"wolf\" ⟨-f⟩ → ⟨-v-⟩\n\n/f/ → /v~β/ serf serva \"serf\" ⟨-s⟩ → ⟨-s-⟩\n\n/s/ → /z/ espòs esposa \"husband – wife\" gos gossa \"dog – bitch\"\n\nIf the masculine form ends in a stressed vowel, the feminine is created by appending the suffix -na.\n\nGermà → germana\n\n\"Brother – sister.\"\n\nSometimes the feminine form is created by appending the suffix -essa to the unmarked masculine form.\n\nSacerdot → sacerdotessa.\n\n\"Priest – priestess.\"\n\nSometimes the masculine form is created from the feminine by changing the suffix a for -ot.\n\nBruixot ← bruixa.\n\n\"Sorcerer — witch.\"\n\nSometimes a single noun is used to designate both masculine and feminine beings. To specify the biological gender of the being, the adjectives mascle \"male\", and femella \"female\" are used.\n\nEl rossinyol. El rossinyol mascle. El rossinyol femella.\n\n\" The nightingale.\" \"The male nightingale.\" \"The female nightingale\"\n\nSince objects and abstract concepts have no biological gender, all of them only have one form. The gender of inanimate nouns is assigned arbitrarily. Sometimes the choice may seem contradictory.\n\nLa virilitat (f).\n\n\"The manliness.\"\n\nSometimes synonymous words may have different genders.\n\nEl televisor (m) – la televisió (f). L'argent (m) – la plata (f)\n\n\"The TV.\" \"The silver.\"\n\nSome homonymous words may have different genders according to their meaning.\n\nEl clau (m) – la clau (f)\n\n\"The nail – the key.\"\n\nLike all the Western Romance languages, the formation of the plural involves the addition of the suffix -s to the singular. However, the stem may undergo some changes. The number inflection of adjectives follows the same rules.\n\nMost times the plural form is created by appending the suffix -s to the singular form.\n\nPare → pares. Avi → avis.\n\n\"Father – fathers.\" \"Grandfather – grandfathers.\"\n\nIf the singular ends in -a, the plural is usually formed with -es. Most of these nouns are feminine, but some are masculine.\n\nCasa → cases (f). Problema → problemes (m).\n\n\"House – houses.\" \"Problem – problems\"\n\nHowever, if the singular ends in -ga, -ca, -gua, -qua, -ça, -ja, the plural is formed by -gues, -ques, -gües, -qües, -ces, -ges. This is done for orthographical reasons, and stem pronunciation remains identical in the singular and plural.\n\nsound transformation singular\n\n(stem underlined) plural\n\n(stem underlined) IPA\n\ntranscription gloss /ɣ/ ⟨g⟩ → ⟨gu⟩ farga fargues /ˈfarɣə/, /ˈfarɣəs/\n\n/ˈfarɣa/, /ˈfarɣes/ \"forge(s)\" /k/ ⟨c⟩ → ⟨qu⟩ oca oques /ˈɔkə/, /ˈɔkəs/\n\n/ˈɔka/, /ˈɔkes/ \"goose – geese\" /ɣw/ ⟨gu⟩ → ⟨gü⟩ llengua llengües /ˈʎeŋɡwə/, /ˈʎeŋɡwəs/\n\n/ˈʎeŋɡwa/, /ˈʎeŋɡwes/ \"tongue(s)\" /kw/ ⟨qu⟩ → ⟨qü⟩ pasqua pasqües /ˈpaskwə/, /ˈpaskwəs/\n\n/ˈpaskwa/, /ˈpaskwes/ \"Easter(s)\" /s/ ⟨ç⟩ → ⟨c⟩ plaça places /ˈpɫasə/, /ˈpɫasəs/\n\n/ˈplasa/, /ˈplases/ \"square(s)\" /ʒ/\n\n/d͡ʒ/ ⟨j⟩ → ⟨g⟩ pluja pluges /ˈpɫuʒə/, /ˈpɫuʒəs/\n\n/ˈplud͡ʒa/, /ˈplud͡ʒes/ \"rain(s)\" /d͡ʒ/\n\n/d͡ʒː/ platja platges /ˈpɫad͡ʒə/, /ˈpɫad͡ʒəs/\n\n/ˈpɫad͡ʒːa/, /ˈpɫad͡ʒːes/ \"beach(es)\"\n\nIf the singular form ends in a stressed vowel, the plural is usually created by appending the suffix -ns.\n\nPa → pans (m). Capità → capitans (m). Acció → accions (f).\n\n\"Bread – breads.\" \"Captain – captains.\" \"Action – actions.\"\n\nHowever, some words ending in a stressed vowel form their plural in -s. Many of them are relatively recent loanwords not directly inherited from late Latin.\n\nSofà → sofàs. Bambú → bambús.\n\n\"Sofa – sofas.\" \"Bamboo – bamboos.\"\n\nA few nouns ending in unstressed -e can also form their plural alternatively in -ns. It is considered archaic or dialectal.\n\nHome → homes or hòmens. Orfe → orfes or òrfens\n\n\"Man – men.\" \"Orphan – orphans.\"\n\nMany masculine nouns ending in -s, ç form their plural with -os. -s- becomes voiced in the plural, but -ç- remains unvoiced.\n\nGas → gasos /ˈgas – ˈgazus ~ ˈgazos/. Braç → braços /ˈbɾas – ˈbɾasus ~ ˈbɾasos/.\n\n\"Gas – gases.\" \"Arm – arms.\"\n\nIn some masculine nouns ending in -s, this remains unvoiced when adding -os, and thus becomes -ss-:\n\nMost polysyllabic masculine words ending in -às, -ís, ús.\n\nFracàs → fracassos. Pastís → pastissos. Barnús → barnussos\n\n\"Failure – failures.\" \"Cake – cakes.\" \"Bathrobe – bathrobes\"\n\nMost masculine words ending in -os, -ós, òs.\n\nGos → gossos. Arròs → arrossos. Os → ossos.\n\n\"Dog – dogs.\" \"Rice – rices.\" \"Bear – bears\". (also \"Bone – bones\").\n\nMasculine paroxytone and proparoxytone nouns ending in -s are invariable.\n\nLlapis → llapis. Òmnibus – òmnibus\n\n\"Pencil – pencils.\" \"Omnibus – omnibuses.\"\n\nFeminine nouns ending in an s-like sound (-s, -ç, -x, -z) have a plural that is pronounced the same as the singular. If the noun ends in -s, no ending is added. Otherwise, an unpronounced -s is added.\n\nPols → pols.\n\n\"Dust – dusts.\"\n\nCalç → calçs /ˈkaɫs ~ ˈkals/.\n\n\"Lime – limes.\"\n\nNouns ending in -x pronounced /ks/ form plurals according to word stress. If the noun is stressed on the last syllable, the plural suffix is -os. Otherwise, the ending is -s and the plural form is homophonous with the singular.\n\nReflex → reflexos /rəˈflɛksus ~ reˈflɛksos/. Índex → índexs /ˈindəks ~ ˈindeks/.\n\n\"Reflection – reflections.\" \"Index – indexes.\"\n\nNouns ending in -x pronounced /ʃ/ form their plural with -os.\n\nCalaix → calaixos.\n\n\"Drawer – drawers.\"\n\nNouns ending in -ig (/tʃ/) can form their plural in two ways, both acceptable:\n\nAdding -s. Both forms will be homophonous. This is the preferred form in normative grammars, not so in general spoken use.\n\nFaig → faigs /ˈfatʃ/. Passeig → passeigs /pəˈsɛtʃ ~ paˈsɛtʃ/.\n\nReplacing -ig with jos or tjos. There are no rules to deduce which is to be used.\n\nFaig → fajos /ˈfat͡ʃ – ˈfaʒus ~ ˈfad͡ʒos/. Mig → mitjos. /ˈmit͡ʃ – ˈmidʒus ~ mid͡ʒːos/.\n\n\"Beech – beeches.\" \"Half – halves.\"\n\nNouns ending in -sc, -st, -xt can form their plural in two ways, both acceptable: Adding -s (preferred), or adding -os.\n\nBosc → boscs or boscos. Gust → gusts or gustos. Pretext → pretexts or pretextos\n\n\"Forest – forests.\" \"Taste – tastes.\" \"Pretext – pretexts.\"\n\nFeminine nouns ending in -st always form the plural by adding -s.\n\nHost → hosts.\n\n\"Army – armies.\"\n\nA Catalan adjective must agree in gender and number with the noun it accompanies. Most adjectives are placed after the nouns. Adjectives can be divided into three declension paradigms. The number inflection rules are the same as the nouns.\n\nCatalan adjectives can be divided in three groups according to the distinct forms it has.\n\nAdjective with 4 forms:\n\nverd \"green\" masculine feminine singular verd verda plural verds verdes\n\nAdjective with 3 forms:\n\nfeliç \"happy\" masculine feminine singular feliç plural feliços felices\n\nAdjective with 2 forms:\n\nindiferent \"indifferent\" masculine feminine singular indiferent plural indiferents\n\nIn adjectives with distinct feminine singular form, the masculine is usually unmarked for gender, and ends in a consonant. The feminine singular form of regular adjectives can be created from the masculine singular.\n\nMost times the feminine form is created by appending the suffix -a to the unmarked masculine form.\n\nSec – seca. Fred – freda. Continu – contínua.\n\n\"Dry.\" \"Cold.\" \"Continuous.\"\n\nIf the masculine form ends in -t, -c, -s, the addition of the feminine suffix -a may cause these consonants to become voiced to -d-, -g-, -s-; or not. There are no rules governing this change.\n\nVoicing alternations becomes voiced remains unvoiced change masculine feminine gloss masculine feminine gloss ⟨-t⟩ → ⟨-d-⟩\n\n/t/ → /ð/ buit buida \"empty\" lent lenta \"slow\" ⟨-c⟩ → ⟨-g-⟩\n\n/k/ → /ɣ/ groc groga \"yellow\" ric rica \"rich\" ⟨-s⟩ → ⟨-s-⟩\n\n/s/ → /z/ obès obesa \"obese\" gras grassa \"fat\"\n\nIf the masculine form ends in a stressed vowel, the feminine is created by appending the suffix -na.; except nu \"nude\" and cru \"raw\".\n\nPla – plana. Rodó – rodona.\n\n\"Flat.\" \"Round.\"\n\nIf the masculine form ends in -au, -eu, -iu, and -ou; the feminine is formed with -ava, -ea, -iva, and -ova.\n\nBlau – blava. Europeu – europea. Viu – viva. Nou – nova.\n\n\"Blue.\" \"European.\" \"Alive.\" \"New.\"\n\nIf the masculine form ends in -e or -o, the final vowel is substituted with -a. Many of the adjectives ending in -o come from Spanish.\n\nAmple – ampla. Maco – maca (Cf. Sp. \"majo\").\n\n\"Wide.\" \"Nice.\"\n\nSome adjectives may have the same form in the masculine singular and feminine singular.\n\nAdjectives ending in -aç, -iç, and -oç.\n\nCapaç – capaç. Feliç – feliç. Precoç – precoç.\n\n\"Capable.\" \"Happy.\" \"Precocious.\"\n\nAdjectives ending in stressed -al, stressed -el, and stressed or unstressed -il.\n\nCentral -central. Rebel – rebel. Hostil – hostil. Mòbil – mòbil.\n\n\"Central.\" \"Rebel.\" \"Hostile.\" \"Mobile.\"\n\nAdjectives ending in -ar.\n\nVulgar – Vulgar\n\n\"Vulgar\"\n\nSome feminine adjectives are formed irregularly and do not adhere to the aforementioned formation rules.\n\nCommon Catalan irregular adjectives masculine feminine gloss oblic obliqua \"oblique\" boig boja \"insane\" roig roja \" red\" lleig lletja \"ugly\" mig mitja \"half\" nul nul·la \"null\" tranquil tranquil·la \"quiet\" cru crua \"raw\" nu nua \"nude\" jueu jueva/jueua \"Jewish\" sueu sueva/sueua \"Suebian\" mal mala \"bad\" paral·lel paral·lela \"parallel\" car cara \"expensive\" clar clara \"clear\" avar avara \"avaricious\" rar rara \"rare\"\n\nDegrees of comparison are expressed with a construction implying the adverb més \"more\" or menys \"less\":\n\nMés ... que (\"more ... than\")\n\nSóc més alt que tu.\n\n\"I am taller than you.\"\n\nEl més ... de (\"the most ... of\")\n\nSóc el més alt de tots\n\n\"I am the tallest of all\".\n\nMenys ... que (\"less ... than\")\n\nSóc menys alt que tu.\n\n\"I am less tall than you.\"\n\nLike many other Romance languages, Catalan adjectives have an absolute superlative form, expressed with the suffix -íssim, placed between the stem and the gender / number suffix.\n\nAquest home és altíssim.\n\n\"This man is very very tall.\"\n\nAquestes dones són altíssimes.\n\n\"These women are very very tall.\"\n\nCatalan adverbs, like their English counterparts, are used to modify adjectives, other adverbs, and verbs or clauses. They do not display any inflection; that is, their form does not change to reflect their precise role, nor any characteristics of what they modify.\n\nIn Catalan, as in English, most adverbs are derived from adjectives. In most cases, this is done by adding the suffix -ment (\"-ly\") to the adjective's feminine singular form. For example, the feminine singular form of lent (\"slow\") is lenta, so the corresponding adverb is lentament (\"slowly\").\n\nAs in English, however, the adjective stem is sometimes modified to accommodate the suffix:\n\nAnd, as in English, many common adverbs are not derived from adjectives at all:\n\naixí (\"thus\", \"so\").\n\nahir (\"yesterday\").\n\nThe placement of Catalan adverbs is almost the same as the placement of English adverbs.\n\nAn adverb that modifies an adjective or adverb comes before that adjective or adverb:\n\ncompletament cert (\"completely true\").\n\nmassa ben fet (\"too well done\").\n\nAn adverb that modifies an infinitive (verbal noun) generally comes after the infinitive:\n\ncaminar lentament (\"to walk slowly\").\n\nAn adverb that modifies a main verb or clause comes either after the verb, or before the clause:\n\nLentament ell comença a caminar or Ell comença lentament a caminar (\"Slowly, he begins to walk\" or \"He begins slowly to walk\").\n\nNote that, unlike in English, this is true even of negative adverbs:\n\nMai jo no he fet això or Jo no he fet mai això (\"Never have I done that\" or \"I have never done that\").\n\nPossessive pronouns are inflected for person and number of the possessor, and for gender and number of the possession. The table below summarizes all the possible forms.\n\nPossessive pronouns singular plural masculine feminine masculine feminine singular first meu meva\n\nmeua meus meves\n\nmeues second teu teva\n\nteua teus teves\n\nteues third seu seva\n\nseua seus seves\n\nseues plural first nostre nostra nostres second vostre vostra vostres third llur llurs\n\nEl cotxe és meu.\n\n\"The car is mine.\"\n\nThe feminine forms meva, teva, and seva may appear dialectally with /w/ instead of /β ~ v/: meua, teua, and seua. Their plural forms follow the same variation (meues, teues, and seues).\n\nPossessive adjectives are, like the possessive pronouns, inflected for person and number of the possessor, and for gender and number of the possession. The table below summarizes all the possible forms. Notice how the plural possessor forms are identical to the possessive pronoun forms.\n\nPossessive adjectives singular plural masculine feminine masculine feminine singular first mon ma mons mes second ton ta tons tes third son sa sons ses plural first nostre nostra nostres second vostre vostra vostres third llur llurs\n\nCentral Catalan has abandoned almost completely unstressed possessives (mon, etc.) in favour of constructions of article + stressed forms (el meu, etc.), a feature shared with Italian and Portuguese.\n\nUnstressed forms are rarely used in the spoken language, and are only retained for family relatives and set phrases.\n\nTon pare. Son avi.\n\n\"Your father.\" \"His / her grandfather.\"\n\nEn ma vida.\n\n\"In my whole life.\"\n\nInstead of this, a construction of definite article + possessive pronoun + noun is preferred.\n\nMon cotxe. (literary, archaic)\n\nEl meu cotxe. (more common)\n\n\"My car.\"\n\nMain article: Catalan personal pronouns\n\nThe morphology of Catalan personal pronouns is complex, specially in unstressed forms, which are numerous (13 distinct forms, compared to 11 in Spanish or 9 in Italian; French has such a different system that comparisons are not feasible). Features include the neuter gender (ho) and the great degree of freedom when combining different unstressed pronouns (65 combinations).\n\nThis flexibility allows Catalan to use extraposition extensively, much more than French or Spanish. Thus, Catalan can have m'hi recomanaren (\"they recommended me to him\"), whereas in French one must say ils m'ont recommendé à lui, and in Spanish me recomendaron a él. This allows the placement of almost any nominal term as a sentence topic, without having to use so often the passive voice (as in French or English), or identifying the direct object with a preposition (as in Spanish).\n\nMain articles: Catalan verbs and Catalan conjugation\n\nCatalan verbs express an action or a state of being of a given subject, and like verbs in most of the Indo-European languages, Catalan verbs undergo inflection according to the following categories:\n\nTense: past, present, future.\n\nNumber: singular or plural.\n\nPerson: first, second or third.\n\nMood: indicative, subjunctive, or imperative.\n\nAspect: Perfective aspect or imperfective aspect (distinguished only in the past tense as remote preterite or imperfect).\n\nVoice: active or passive.\n\nLike all the Romance languages, Catalan verbal inflection is more complex than the nominal. Suffixation is omnipresent, while morphological alternations play a secondary role. Vowel alternances are active, as well as infixation and suppletion. However, these are not as productive as in Spanish, and are mostly restricted to irregular verbs.\n\nThe Catalan verbal system is basically common to all Western Romance, except that most dialects replace the analytic perfect indicative with a periphrastic tense composed of vaig, vas (vares), va, vam (vàrem), vau (vàreu), van (varen) and the infinitive.\n\nCatalan verbs are traditionally divided into three conjugations, with vowel themes -a-, -e-, -i-, the last two being split into two subtypes. However, this division is mostly theoretical. Only the first conjugation is nowadays productive (with about 3500 common verbs), while the third (the subtype of servir, with about 700 common verbs) is semiproductive. The verbs of the second conjugation are fewer than 100, and it is not possible to create new ones, except by compounding.\n\nVerbal periphrases of obligation:\n\nCaldre + que + infinitive (personal)\n\nCaldre + infinitive (impersonal)\n\nHaver + de + infinitive (personal)\n\nHaver-se + de + infinitive (impersonal)\n\nFer falta (impersonal)\n\nSer menester + que + verb in subjunctive (personal)\n\nSer menester + infinitive (impersonal)\n\nSer necessari + que + verb in subjunctive (personal)\n\nSer necessari + infinitive (impersonal)\n\n(*) Although it is not correct[further explanation needed] the usage of the verbal periphrasis *tenir + que + infinitive (obligation) in the Standard (instead of haver + de, which is roughly equivalent to English \"have to\"), it is widely used in colloquial Catalan and Valencian. The same occurs with *haver-hi + que + infinitive.\n\nVerbal periphrases of probability:\n\nDeure + infinitive\n\nPotser / Segurament / Probablement + verb in indicative\n\nPoder + ser + verb in subjunctive\n\nSer probable + que + verb in subjunctive\n\nSer possible + que + verb in subjunctive\n\nPoder + infinitive (it is also a periphrasis of capability)\n\nVerbal periphrases of imminence, intention or future:\n\nAra + verb in present or future (immediate action)\n\nDe seguida + verb in present or future (immediate action)\n\nTot seguit + verb in present or future (immediate action)\n\nVerb in present or future (not necessarily immediate action)\n\nPensar + infinitive (periphrasis of intention)\n\nAnar + a + infinitive\n\nEstar a punt de + infinitive (immediate action)\n\nOther modal and aspectual verbal periphrases:\n\nVindre a + infinitive (modal verbal periphrasis of approximation value, with the verb dir, to say, it has a justification aspect)\n\nGosar + infinitive (modal verbal periphrasis of audacity)\n\nSaber + infinitive (modal verbal periphrasis of ingressive value)\n\nAcabar de + infinitive (modal verbal periphrasis of culminative value)\n\nArribar a + infinitive (aspectual periphrasis of culminative and ponderative value)\n\nComençar a + infinitive (aspectual periphrasis of ingressive value)\n\nPosar-se a + infinitive (aspectual periphrasis of ingressive value)\n\nArrencar (or Arrancar) a + infinitive (aspectual periphrasis of ingressive value)\n\nRompre a + infinitive (aspectual periphrasis of ingressive value)\n\nVoler + infinitive (aspectual periphrasis of ingressive value)\n\nSoler + infinitive (aspectual periphrasis of habitual value)\n\nTornar a + infinitive (aspectual periphrasis of repetitive value)\n\nEstar + gerund (aspectual periphrasis of progressive value)\n\nAnar + gerund (aspectual periphrasis of progressive value)\n\nContinuar + gerund (aspectual periphrasis of durative value)\n\nSeguir + gerund (aspectual periphrasis of durative value)\n\nTindre + past participle (aspectual periphrasis of resultative value)\n\nQuedar + past participle (aspectual periphrasis of resultative value)\n\nDeixar + past participle (aspectual periphrasis of resultative value)\n\nTindre + past participle (aspectual periphrasis of resultative value)\n\nFabra, Pompeu (1933) [1918].
