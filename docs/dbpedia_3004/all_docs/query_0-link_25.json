Catalan is a Romance language spoken in several territories in Spain, France, Italy, and Andorra. It is the official language of Andorra and co-official in Catalonia, the Balearic Islands, and the Valencian Community of Spain. It has over 4 million native speakers and is spoken by over 10 million people total. Catalan evolved from Vulgar Latin in the Middle Ages around the eastern Pyrenees and experienced a golden age before declining with the union of Aragon and Castile and later due to policies promoting Spanish and French. It remains actively used today despite facing historical pressures.",
