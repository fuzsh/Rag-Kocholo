        "text": "4 cats restaurant, “Els Quatre Gats”, is probably one of the most emblematic bars in Barcelona (if not the most). It was once the bohemian meeting point of artists at the verge of the 19th century, among them, Pablo Picasso. Keep reading to know more about this iconic place in Barcelona…\n\nA source of inspiration: Le Chat Noir in Paris\n\n“Els Quatre Gats”, 4 cats restaurant, is located on the ground floor of Casa Martí, a Modernist building created by Josep Puig i Cadafalch. It was founded by Pere Romeu, whose background actually was key to create this emblematic space… Romeu had been working as a waitress in a cabaret called Le Chat Noir in Paris. So once he came back to Barcelona, he decided to open a similar business (cheap food and piano music). Soon the place became the meeting point of some of the most recognized intellectuals from the Modernist movement.\n\n4 cats restaurant in the late 19th century: intellectuals’ meeting point\n\nEls Quatre Gats was the place where many cultural events were held: literary and music evenings, puppet and shadow shows, poetic readings and above all, art exhibitions. Among the regular customers at Els Quatre Gats, were: Santiago Rusiñol, Ramón Casas, Miquel Utrillo, Ricard Opisso, Antoni Gaudí, Enrique Granados, Isaac Albéniz and Lluís Millet. Even a young Pablo Picasso held his first art exhibition there.\n\nThis is another definition of what exactly was Els Quatre Gats by Santiago Rusiñol. And we just loved this alternative description:\n\n“It is a hostel for the hungry, a warm corner for those who miss home, it is a museum for those who seek sweets for the soul; It is a tavern and vineyard for those who seek the shade and the squeezed essence of the bunch; It is a gothic brewery for lovers of the North and patio of Andalusia for the entertainers of noon; it is a house of healing for the sick of our century and a den of friendship and harmony for those who come to take refuge under the porches of the house ”.\n\nThe truth is that this place, as a tavern itself, lacked commercial interest. It became more a forum for art and literature discussions. Even though it was only open for six years, from 1897 to 1903 (probably due to its difficult economic sustainability).\n\nEls Quatre Gats was full of paintings and posters made by the clients. One of the most emblematic is the one in which Ramon Casas and Pere Romeu are riding in a tandem. It was painted by Casas, and you can see the original artwork in MNAC.\n\n4 cats restaurant “Els Quatre Gats” today\n\n4 cats restaurant, Els Quatre Gats restaurant reopened some years ago as a bar and restaurant. And it still preserves the original decoration, including a reproduction of the two works by Ramon Casas."
