Nowadays, it chiefly caters to tourists, and is no crucible for Catalan gastronomy – nor is it cheap. There is, however, a more reasonably priced and generously portioned set lunch, and when it’s all over you can buy the T-shirt. To appreciate the building without forking out for dinner, visit its café."
