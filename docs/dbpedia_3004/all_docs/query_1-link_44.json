        "text": "In addition to the fascination that Woody Allen feels for his native New York, the old world is also the location for some of the director´s more recent films. After multiple films based in England, more specifically in London, Allen decided that he would turn his lens to Barcelona.\n\nRarely has so much of Barcelona been seen in a film, especially not an American one. Vicky, Cristina, Barcelona is a full colour postcard of the Catalan city. We will show you some of the places that appear in the film that stars Penelope Cruz, Javier Bardem, Scarlett Johansson and Rebecca Hall.\n\nEls Quatre Gats\n\nEls Quatre Gats is a bar and restaurant symbolic of Barcelona. This bar forms part of the history of the city since it was constructed in the 19th century and has hosted clients such as Picasso and Gaudi.\n\nSituated right in the centre of Barcelona, it is considered a symbol of modernism and these days continues offering a rich cuisine based in Spanish and Catalan culture. In the film various scenes are filmed here, where we see Vicky and Cristina dining in one of the restaurant´s tables.\n\nTerrace of the Pedrera\n\nOne of the reasons why there are so many well-known monuments in Barcelona is because of the story of the two American tourists in the city. Because like good tourists they visit the great architectural jewels of Barcelona.\n\nLa Pedrera and La Sagrada Familia, amongst others. In the we say as much of the famous façade as the rooftop terrace with its famous chimneys designed by Antoni Gaudi.\n\nLa Sagrada Familia\n\nIn a film which has Barcelona as one of its chief protagonists, one can´t miss out the Sagrada Familia. The best known symbol of Barcelona appears in the film not as place they visit but as another element of the Barcelona backdrop.\n\nIf you want to follow the modernist route like in Vicky, Cristina, Barcelona one option is to follow an electric bike tour whilst a guide explains to you the full history of these buildings.\n\nPark Güell\n\nWe continue the tourist route of Vicky and Cristina in park Güell, situated in the Gracia neighbourhood. It is a public park designed by Gaudi in which one can see various symbols of Catalan modernism like the salamander staircase or the pavilions.\n\nIt is one of the most visited attractions by tourists and can provide spectacular views out over the entire city.\n\nCiutadella Park\n\nThe film has various scenes in which nature is the star. One of them is in the Collserola hills where the trio composed of Cristina (Scarlett Johansson), Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem) and Maria Elena (Penélope Cruz) star in some of the most scenes of the film.\n\nAnother scene is in the Parc de la Ciutadella, where Vicky and Cristina take photos of the famous waterfall situated in the centre of the park above which is a spectualar quadriga – a gold chariot drawn by four horses.\n\nSan Felipe Neri Square\n\nIt is one of the most charming squares in Barcelona and Woody Allen seemed to know it. This small square located in one of the streets of the Gothic neighbourhood is the ideal scene for a dinner between the two couples in the film.\n\nIn the same square there is a baroque church from the 17th century, as well as the cathedral of Barcelona only a few streets away.\n\nTibidabo Theme Park\n\nTibidabo theme park is the oldest theme park in Spain and one of the oldest in the world.\n\nOpened in the year 1901, it is still in operation today and also has some of the best views of Barcelona. Situated on top of a hill, one can enjoy one of the best sunsets from here, seeing the whole city beneath your feet.\n\nVicky, Cristina, Barcelona is a homage to the city of Barcelona, even if various locations in the North of Spain appear, particularly Oviedo."
