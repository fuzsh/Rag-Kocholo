        "text": "The quintessential symbol of an entire era, Els 4 Gats opened its doors before the end of the 19th century and closed them a few years later. However, its closure did not mean the end of Modernism, but rather the culmination of a complex movement that had begun almost a decade ago.\n\nAll kinds of public passed through the rooms and tables of this hostel, restaurant and brewery, especially artists: painters and sculptors of different generations, from established ones like Román Ribera to new promises like Isidre Nonell, evidently passing through the “modern” pioneers, that is, Ramon Casas or Santiago Rusiñol, two of those responsible for the new establishment.\n\nLikewise, although the regulars at Els 4 Gats flirted with the bohemia, not all of them communed with it on a regular basis, their creations being, therefore, a reflection of the attitude and commitment towards the reality of their time. In this way, we will come across artists more akin to showing a cosmopolitan and elegant modernity (Joan Cardona, Xavier Gosé, Carlos Vázquez), but also others with a fondness for a landscaping with impressionist vibrations (Eliseu Meifrén). However, the great aesthetic revulsion that this space meant was produced through the close interpretation of the world that they had to live in -in tune with the bohemian spirit-, which oscillated between a manner indebted to the topic of the “Espagnolade” (Ricard Canals) to a more sordid and miserable vision (Isidre Nonell, Ricard Opisso), a look that would lay the foundations for the expressionism that would arrive shortly after with the avant-garde of the 20th century.\n\nOn the occasion of the current exhibition on this mythical establishment in the Museu del Modernisme de Barcelona, the Gothsland Gallery invites the public to come to its rooms to enjoy a preview or extension of said exhibition. In this way, the visitor will be able to contemplate representative creations of some of the artists linked to Els 4 Gats, whether as founders, clients, exhibitors and/or collaborators; which will allow you to obtain a panoramic view of its importance for Catalan art at the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th.\n\nMore Information\n\nDates: May 15 – July 28, 2023\n\nAddress: Consell de Cent, 331, 08007 Barcelona\n\nHours: Monday to Saturday, 10:00 – 14:00 & 16:00 – 20:00\n\nTelephone: (+34) 93 488 19 22\n\nEmail: info@gothsland.com\n\nWebsite: gothsland.com"
