Els Quatre Gats

If you think a waiting queue to enter a restaurant is an undeniable sign of quality, be prepared to loose your faith in humanity in front of this disaster.

The to” Avoid Strongly list’ might be renamed the “shit list” because of Els Quatre Gats. There is no single Catalan to be found in this traditional site serving highway restaurant food to busloads of bargain trippers (your concierge may be one of them).

All you get from the underpaid Asian staff is hate. They hate tourists, they hate their job and they hate you! Harassed servers serving can asparagus topped with can

Tartar sauce, then bacalao cooked a la plancha smelling what was cooked before.. Two elderly musicians playing sad tunes, so old fashioned you'll believe Franco's still alive. If Picasso really hung out here it was probably during an unknown period of his life: the black period.

Don’t go: expensive and depressing, a disgrace for Barcelona.
