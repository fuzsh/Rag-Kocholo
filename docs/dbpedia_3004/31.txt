Dazzling in its design, Els Quatre Gats is an unmissable stop for those interested in Modernista architecture and indeed the art of the period, being the former regular meeting place of Picasso and other artistic luminaries. Nowadays, it chiefly caters to tourists, and is no crucible for Catalan gastronomy – nor is it cheap. There is, however, a more reasonably priced and generously portioned set lunch, and when it’s all over you can buy the T-shirt. To appreciate the building without forking out for dinner, visit its café.
