        "text": "Ingress is a location-based augmented reality game created by Niantic, Inc. Found on both iOS and Android app stores, the game is played around the world by hundreds of thousands of fans every day. The story is constantly unfolding around players, and is directly affected by the outcomes of various events.\n\nWhile I canâ€™t divulge exactly what we created, out of respect to the game (and to the Enlightenment and Resistance), what I will say is that I had the pleasure of meeting many players at events and on missions, and I greatly enjoyed helping drive the narrative forward by having a hand in creating some of the game content that was produced."
