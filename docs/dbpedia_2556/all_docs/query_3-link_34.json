        "text": "It seems stranger than fiction, but Pokemon Go - an app that has triggered a global phenomenon where millions of people obsessively capture small creatures in public spaces - was first introduced as an April Fool's Day joke.\n\nIn 2014, YouTube published a mock sales pitch, external called Google Maps: Pokemon Challenge, which showed the corporation's maps app overtaken by colourful monsters.\n\nThe video asked recruits to track down these critters using their phone's GPS location data, and then capture them using their camera.\n\nIf you are still unsure about how to play Pokemon Go, or what it is, Google's prank provides a pretty good guide.\n\nIt's perhaps no coincidence that the studio that developed today's blockbuster app, Niantic Labs, is itself a spin-out from Google.\n\nUp until now, the central concept of mobile games has been something that can be enjoyed anywhere. They are pit-stops in daily routines.\n\nBut few games encourage playing while on the move like Pokemon Go does.\n\nIn order to succeed, players have to travel to destinations and visit landmarks previously unknown to them.\n\nIn doing so, the Pokemon Company - and Nintendo, which has a large stake in it - may have just harnessed the true potential of mobilised gaming.\n\nFor now, the game is a little barebones and free to play. Its developer currently makes money from the optional power-ups and virtual items that can be bought within the title.\n\nBut Niantic is already in talks with various companies who want to buy sponsored locations within the game.\n\nThis is a new kind of revenue stream for a games developer and, at a time where traditional income routes are somewhat challenged, is something that will certainly turn heads if successful."
