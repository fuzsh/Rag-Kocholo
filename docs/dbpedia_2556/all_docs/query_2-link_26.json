        "text": "Want to know how to build a game like Pokémon Go? Or maybe you have an idea of a similar mobile game? Keep reading to learn all the details about creating Pokémon-like games from our comprehensive guide.\n\nIn this article\n\nCreate a Game like Pokémon Go\n\nPlanning to Make a Game Like Pokémon Go?\n\nOther Mobile Games Popular as Pokémon Go\n\nFrequently Asked Questions on How to Create a Game Like Pokémon Go\n\nThe number of Pokémon Go app lifetime downloads globally reached 630 million (as of Q4 2023). The Pokemon franchise has been recognized as one of the world’s best-selling franchises.\n\nThat said, the game is a model for anyone wanting to strike it big with an AR (augmented reality) app. Developing such a game app requires a deep understanding of game development engines, game design, game logic, and cutting-edge technologies like augmented reality, visual reality, etc.\n\nIf you don’t have a professional team of game developers with this relevant expertise to take on the task, submit a request for a complimentary discovery call, and one of our tech account managers who managed similar projects will contact you shortly.\n\nLet’s see how to make apps like Pokémon Go in detail.\n\nCreate a Game Like Pokémon Go\n\nMaking a game like Pokémon Go includes the following:\n\nMarket research\n\nAs the first step, you should conduct thorough market research and understand the preferences and pain points of your target audience. Analysis of Pokémon Go app’s features will help you decide what features you want to add to your game app.\n\nFeatures of Pokemon game-like apps\n\nTo launch a competitive app in this market, you need to have an interesting game concept. You might want to include the following features:\n\nNew account creation.\n\nCustomize player profiles: Pokemon game players can customize their ‘Avatars’.\n\nInteractive maps.\n\nA UI that’s easy enough for players to participate in the game on the go.\n\nParticipate in battles: This allows players to participate in those engrossing battles with different complexity levels of game-play to win new digital collectibles or art assets like Pokémon.\n\nTrading digital collectibles: The app should allow players to trade collectibles with their peers.\n\nAn ability to make friends: Players need to make new friends in the app, gift them collectibles, and trade collectibles with them.\n\nA capability to add newer versions of digital collectibles: This allows Pokemon games to remain fresh and interesting to loyal players playing them for a long time.\n\nAn ability to create and celebrate special events: Digital collectibles captured during these events can have differentiated features.\n\nAn ability to create clubs: Pokémon Go has gyms hence, a new app trying to make a mark in the market needs to provide similar clubs for players.\n\nEnough customization capabilities to keep adding new features: This will help in retaining the interest level in the game.\n\nIt’s time to look at approaches to creating Pokémon Go and similar games.\n\nBack to Top\n\nApproach #1: Use Appy Pie AR app builder to make a game like Pokémon Go\n\nIn this approach, you don’t need a development team, and you don’t need to engage an app development company. You also don’t need to arrange your own cloud hosting or Mobile Backend as a Service (MBaaS) account.\n\nAppy Pie provides an AR app builder. This drag-and-drop app builder requires no coding. The app builder allows standard AR app features, e.g.:\n\nGet a complimentary discovery call and a free ballpark estimate for your project\n\nTrusted by 100x of startups and companies like\n\nImage recognition and tracking;\n\nLocation/geo-based AR;\n\nAbility to easily integrate ‘Virtual Reality’ (VR);\n\nPanoramic and 360-degree video viewer.\n\nTo make your own Pokémon app, sign-up with Appy Pie. In a series of intuitive steps, you can choose a layout, drag and drop the required features, and publish your app.\n\nTo publish your app in ‘Google Play’ or ‘Apple App Store’, you need certain guidelines. Consult the ‘Google Play’ app “Launch Checklist”, and the Apple “App Store Review Guidelines” for more details.\n\nThe Pokémon Go-like app development cost in this approach only includes the Appy Pie product cost. Visit their pricing page for details.\n\nThey have multiple pricing plans, however, only the Platinum plan allows you to use your own branding. For start-ups without a development team, this approach allows a quick launch of the app.\n\nBack to Top\n\nApproach #2: Make a Game like the Pokémon Go app using SDKs\n\nUnlike the app builder approach, this is a full-fledged development project. Several companies provide ‘Software Development Kits’ (SDKs) for AR game app development. This makes the approach a little easier.\n\nI also recommend that you use an MBaaS provider. This helps you save the backend development time and effort, and you don’t need to manage the mobile backend.\n\nOption #1: Wikitude AR SDK\n\nWikitude offers a comprehensive AR app SDK. The SDK offers all the key features, e.g.:\n\nObject and scene recognition;\n\nInstant tracking;\n\nImage recognition;\n\nLocation-based services;\n\nMultiple image targets;\n\nExtended tracking;\n\nCloud recognition: developers can work with thousands of images hosted in the cloud;\n\n3D augmentations.\n\nFor a complete list of features, visit their features webpage.\n\nYour team needs to sign-up with Wikitude. Create your AR designs using the ‘Wikitude Studio’. You can create and manage target collections besides, you can create and publish AR experiences here.\n\nWikitude Studio is a drag-and-drop tool to create an AR experience, furthermore, the company also has a ‘Studio Editor’ with intuitive navigation.\n\nThe web-based studio is easy-to-use, additionally, you can easily work on image recognition, object and scene recognition, augmentations, etc.\n\nVisit the studio webpage for more details.\n\nAR apps requiring more than 1,000 target image recognition can use ‘Wikitude Cloud Recognition‘. This offers a lot more space, hence, there is a greater target image recognition capability.\n\nWikitude offers different features in their different pricing plans. For example, the higher-priced plans include object recognition, scene recognition, cloud recognition, etc. Wikitude supports iOS, Android, and Windows platforms. Visit their pricing page for details.\n\nThe ‘Cloud’ license includes cloud hosting, however, for other products you need to buy an MBaaS service. Google Firebase, AWS Mobile, Kinvey, etc., are popular MBaaS providers. Check our guide “How to choose the best mobile backend as a service (MBaaS)?”.\n\nOption #2: CRYENGINE game development platform\n\nCRYENGINE offers a free game development platform. Visit their registration page to sign-up, subsequently, you can download their game engine.\n\nThe engine offers the following features:\n\nAn ability to design visuals and let your ideas fly;\n\nSandbox and tools to create AR experiences;\n\nA capability to create characters and animations in your unique art style;\n\nA comprehensive gaming platform;\n\nBuilt-in audio and physics solutions;\n\nReal-time immersion and interaction abilities.\n\nThe game platform is free, and they have a comprehensive set of tutorials. You can access their complete documentation, which contains guides for everything including installation, interfaces, etc.\n\nYou need to get an MBaaS account hence, consult our comparison guide I have referred to above.\n\nOption #3: Solar 2D game engine\n\nSolar 2D provides a free SDK called “Solar SDK“. Their 2D engine is cross-platform, besides, it’s built on the Lua scripting language.\n\nLua has been utilized in many famous games like ‘Warcraft’, and ‘Angry Birds’. It’s an open-source language, furthermore, it’s easy to learn.\n\nYou can build Android and iOS apps. You can also build for Mac desktops, Amazon Fire, Apple TV, Android TV, and Windows desktop.\n\nHire expert game developers for your next project\n\n62 Expert dev teams,\n\n1,200 top developers\n\n350+ Businesses trusted\n\nus since 2016\n\nThey offer many plugins for different purposes, e.g., in-app advertising, media, analytics, etc. Solar2D SDK allows you to call native libraries for programming languages like C/C++/Obj-C/Java and APIs. The build is easy and their simulator makes testing easy.\n\nOpenGL graphics and lightweight Lua scripting make the apps performant. Read more about its’ advantages on their product page.\n\nDownload Solar2D here. The company provides extensive learning resources. You can access their ‘getting started’ guide and developer guides. Also access their API references, and plugin documentation.\n\nThey also have a marketplace where you can purchase app templates, Corona plugins, graphics, and audio files. You need to purchase an MBaaS account from our MBaaS comparison guide I mentioned earlier.\n\nBack to Top\n\nOption #4: Unity gaming engine\n\nUnity provides a comprehensive gaming engine and they claim that half of all games are created using this product. To back their claim, they showcase AR games that use their software on their “Made with Unity” page.\n\nYou get the following advantages with Unity:\n\nA rich and extensible editor with artist-friendly tools, available both on Windows and Mac desktops.\n\nAbility to create both 2D and 3D games.\n\nAI pathfinding tools to ease your Pokemon Go development.\n\nUI, physics engine, etc.\n\nIt supports multiple platforms like Android, iOS, Mac, tvOS, Android TV, Windows, Fire OS, etc.\n\nHigh performance.\n\nYou can build instant games.\n\nHigh-quality graphics rendering.\n\nArtist and designer tools.\n\nBuild and collaboration features via ‘Unity Teams’.\n\nPerformance reporting, app analytics, monetization.\n\nAn asset store where you can get both free and paid content.\n\nRead more about their advantages on their products page.\n\nThe company provides a rich suite of learning aids. This includes on-site training, online training, courses, tutorials, step-by-step guides, learning projects, documentation, and community support.\n\nVisit their pricing page to get details about their pricing plans. You need to buy an MBaaS account separately.\n\nOption #5: Open 3D engine (successor to Amazon Lumberyard)\n\nAmazon recommends the Open 3D Engine (O3DE) for building 3D games. It has good integrations with AWS. Open 3D Engine is free and open-source. You have many advantages if you use O3DE, for example:\n\nQuickly build live, multiplayer features. It offers a physically-based renderer and a suite of tools to allow you to build real-time online game features.\n\n‘Cloud Gems’ framework enables you to easily build cloud-connected features.\n\nExtend the O3DE editor by creating a custom tool gem in C++ and Python.\n\nThe platform offers two scripting environments to build runtime logic with Script Canvas and Lua.\n\nAn ability to create near-photorealistic environments that have high dynamic ranges. You can also create excellent real-time effects.\n\nYou can easily add game-ready assets.\n\nCreating believable and compelling characters.\n\nRobust networking features.\n\nThis is not an exhaustive list of advantages. Visit the O3DE homepage for more details. You can sign up here.\n\nTo learn about Open 3D Engine, access their ‘Getting Started’ guide. You can also access their tutorials and documentation.\n\nBack to Top\n\nForm a competent development team to make a game like Pokémon Go\n\nBuilding a game like Pokemon Go is a development project, and you need to onboard a skilled development team. You need to induct for the following roles:\n\nBusiness analysts;\n\nUI/UX designers;\n\niOS developers;\n\nAndroid developers;\n\nTesters;\n\nProject manager.\n\nPlease ensure UI/UX designers know sufficiently about mobile navigation menu examples since UI is key for a game app. The PM needs to be sufficiently skilled, e.g., he or she should know project management best practices.\n\nSince a mobile app is a ‘System of Engagement’ (SoE) requiring frequent changes, I recommend that you use the ‘Agile’ methodology. Read our guide “How to build an Agile development team”.\n\nProject management approach\n\n‘Scrum’ is a highly tried-and-tested technique in the ‘Agile’ environment, hence I recommend you use it. Here, the PM is called the ‘Scrum Master’, and he builds a closely-knit cross-functional team. BA, designers, developers, and testers work together in this team, which is typically a small and co-located team.\n\nThe ‘Scrum Master’ first gets the product features from the ‘Product Owner’ (PO). The team estimates features and different ‘Sprints’ are planned for collections of features. The team goes through a routine ‘Daily Stand-up Meeting’ to discuss the status and resolve issues.\n\nWhen the features are successfully developed and tested, the team conducts a ‘Sprint Review Meeting’. Project stakeholders see the app features and provided they work as expected, approve the ‘Sprint’.\n\nThe ‘Scrum team’ then conducts a lessons-learned exercise called the ‘Sprint Retrospective Meeting’. Read more about it in “How to Build a Scrum development team”.\n\nImportant tools to develop an AR game\n\nAlthough SDKs and MBaaS providers make development a bit easier, you should strive to gain optimal productivity. You need to use modern tools for that.\n\nConsider ‘TestComplete’ for test automation. ‘Maven’ is a good tool for the build and deployment management of the final product.\n\nHire expert game developers for your next project\n\nTrusted by\n\nYou can try Slack for collaboration, besides, Zoho is good for project management. Get more tips from our guide “The 10 best Agile project management tools”.\n\nThe cost to make a game like Pokémon Go\n\nWhile SDK providers and MBaaS providers have clearly laid out pricing plans, the development effort will vary depending on the complexity of the finished product.\n\nThe local labor market influences the availability of skilled developers, besides, it also drives the manpower cost. You may need to get professional help with this approach, hence, please consult our guide “How to find the best software development company?”.\n\nBack to Top\n\nPlanning to Make a Game Like Pokémon Go?\n\nThis is all for our Pokemon games guide.
