        "text": "Preface (Added 28 February): The purpose of this essay is to explain the growing crisis faced by the video gaming industry. And crisis is a fair characterization. In 2022, the industry had a then-record of 8,500 layoffs. 2023 beat that record by nearly 25%. And during the first two months of 2024, there have already been some 8,000 job losses. Alongside (and partly behind) these layoffs are scores of games that underperformed or flopped altogether — and many more in-development titles that have been canceled outright. Few expect these layoffs or game shutdowns to stop, though they may slow. At the same time, the video gaming industry continues to achieve new cultural highs, while many of its most popular titles, profitable publishers, and powerful ecosystem continue to grow. This leads to the second purpose of this essay: explaining the apparent contradiction between the industry’s successes and its struggles.\n\nCrises have many causes (and so this essay is also quite long, too): The end of the COVID-19 pandemic and low-interest rates are partly responsible, but so too are changing business models, evolving user behaviors and preferences, labour economics and microeconomics, disappointing forecasts (and only-recently abandoned rationales for the related shortfalls), competitive and budgetary escalation, console saturation, and an end to the growth-drivers of the last five and ten years. It is the convergence of these many trends that is behind the current state of gaming. These problems will eventually pass, and there are many reasons for hope, but it will likely take time.\n\n- - -\n\nTo players and outside observers, 2023 looks like one of the 70-year-old gaming industry’s greatest-ever years. Chief among its achievements was its slate of new software releases. PC and console players received Alan Wake 2, Armored Core VI, Baldur’s Gate 3, Diablo IV, Final Fantasy XVI, The Finals, Hi-Fi Rush, Hogwarts Legacy, Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, Starfield, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, Super Mario Bros. Wonder, and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, alongside the Cyberpunk 2077 2.0 re-release (plus Phantom Liberty DLC), Fortnite OG, Metroid Prime Remastered, and the Resident Evil 4 remake, with Roblox finally launching on PlayStation. On mobile, Monopoly Go! and Honkai: Star Rail debuted, while the Indian ban on PUBG Mobile (previously the most popular AAA game in history) was lifted. It’s difficult to argue any other year has seen a greater slate (yes, even compared to 1998 and 2007). AW2 was my personal favorite.\n\nHardware had a terrific year too. After two and a half years of supply constraints, it was finally possible for anyone who wanted to purchase a Generation 9 console (PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X) or a new top-of-the-line graphics card to do so. In October, Meta’s Quest 3 finally released, offering substantial improvements to 2020’s Quest 2, which sold roughly 20 million units, or 20 times more than 2019’s Quest 1. PC gaming leader Valve also released an updated Steam Deck (offering OLED, a 0.4-inch-larger screen, 50% faster frame rate, etc.), and console leader PlayStation launched its VR 2 (the first model launched in 2016) and the PlayStation Portal (which enabled PlayStation 5 owners to play their console via a handheld device, although only inside the home).\n\nThe largest platforms grew as well. Roblox, the most popular gaming ecosystem globally, grew its daily active users from 59 million in Q3 2022 to about 70 million in Q3 2023, with monthly active users growing from 275 million to 350 million and monthly hours from roughly 4.6 billion to 5.6 billion. In its seventh year, Fortnite, which had generated more revenue in a single year than any game in history during both 2018 and 2019, achieved new highs in its daily and monthly active user figures after launching its “UEFN” (Unreal Editor for Fortnite) overhaul to Fortnite Creative as well as LEGO Fortnite, Rocket Racing (a spinoff of Rocket League), and Fortnite Festival (a reimagination of Rock Band).\n\nThe strength of gaming was also demonstrated well beyond its own market. Nvidia, a thirty-year-old company that built its business around gaming (founder/CEO Jensen Huang has said this focus was “one of the best strategic decisions [the company] ever made”), also became one of the world’s largest, most powerful, and important companies in 2023 through the rise of AI. Microsoft also completed the largest tech acquisition in history, buying not an enterprise software giant, AI pioneer, or smartphone manufacturer but Activision Blizzard, owners of Call of Duty, Warcraft, and Candy Crush. And at $70 billion, this purchase cost fully nine times what Amazon spent on a TV/film-maker such as MGM, was twice the value of streaming music leader Spotify, and had a greater enterprise value than Hollywood giants such as Warner Bros. Discovery, Paramount Global, NBCUniversal, or Lionsgate (indeed, even some of those players combined). Reports also emerged that, after three years in market, Netflix was looking to evolve its gaming offering from a bundled and purely-free-to-play part of its video subscription into one supported by ads and microtransactions. Such a shift could mean Netflix’s business wasn’t working in its current state, but as the “streaming bubble” collapsed in 2022 and 2023, it was hard not to look at the major gaming publishers and see exactly what many Hollywood giants had once sought in streaming video but had since determined to be illusory — tens if not hundreds of millions of D2C users and a profitable, consistently growing business behind it.\n\nIP is another area where gaming soared to new and considerable highs in 2023. The Super Mario Bros. Movie grossed $1.4 billion worldwide, ranking second for all theatrical releases in 2023 and third among all animated films in history; it more than tripled the box office of 2019’s Detective Pikachu, which had held the record for a video game adaptation. Five Nights at Freddy’s was a surprise hit, too, grossing $300MM worldwide on a $20MM production budget at Universal—outstanding in its own right but also more than twice the haul of Universal’s Exorcist: Believer, which came out two weeks earlier and fell short of $140MM worldwide (Universal reportedly paid $400MM to acquire the rights to the franchise). HBO’s The Last of Us, which adapted the hit PlayStation game of the same name, was the first video game adaptation nominated in major Emmy categories and was the second most nominated series of its year, collecting nods for Outstanding Drama Series, Outstanding Lead Actor, Outstanding Lead Actress, Outstanding Director, four of six nominations for Outstanding Guest Actor (with one winning), three of six nominations for Outstanding Guest Actress (with one winning), and twelve other creative nominations (six wins). According to HBO, the series was its most watched since 2011’s Game of Thrones, meaning that it also beat 2022’s Thrones spinoff House of the Dragon. Peacock’s Twisted Metal adaptation became one of its five biggest original series launches as well as its most binged comedy.\n\nVideo games did more than thrive in film/TV during 2023; they are helping to revive and expand non-gaming IP. Each of the last three films set in the Harry Potter universe set a new record low at the box office, with the 2022 entry grossing only $407MM worldwide, after which Warner Bros. effectively cancelled the last two entries in the five-part Fantastic Beasts series. Many analysts attributed the poor performance to the absence of the Boy Who Lived, among other issues, even though the Fantastic Beasts series was a direct prequel to the Harry Potter films and starred Dumbledore himself. Yet 2023’s best-selling game by unit sales is set to be Hogwarts Legacy, which grossed $850MM in its first two weeks alone and will likely cross $1.2B. Not only is there no Harry Potter in Hogwarts Legacy but the title is also considered non-canonical and thus has even looser ties to the master franchise than Fantastic Beasts did.\n\nAnother big 2023 game, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, is a canonized tale produced by EA that, like its 2019 predecessor, has massively expanded the number of Jedi to survive “Order 66” and produced many fan favorites, such as lead Cal Kestis, who seems destined to appear in live action (and happens to be played by Hollywood actor Cameron Monaghan). Despite strong reviews, the 2023 film Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves sold only 3.5MM tickets globally, producing roughly $208MM in revenue, half of which was retained by theater operators. Though the film will benefit from ancillary revenue streams (SVOD licenses, home video sales, etc.), it’s unlikely to see much profit on its $150MM production budget and $50MM for marketing. A sequel seems unlikely. In contrast, the 2023 game Baldur’s Gate 3, which is based on the same D&D tabletop IP, has sold 6–7.5MM copies and at several times the price, generating over $500MM in revenue and winning Game of the Year at the Video Game Awards.\n\nOf course, one can find high-level disappointments even in a year as great as 2023. For a time, the Nintendo Switch 2, Apple Vision Pro, and even GTA VI were expected to launch by the holiday quarter. Not all games met the lofty expectations of its target players. But what a year. In theory.\n\nPrincess In Another Castle\n\nFor those who worked in gaming, last year was brutal. A record 10,500 game developers, artists, testers, and other gaming employees were laid off in 2023, topping the prior record holder, 2022, which saw 8,500 in job losses. Unfortunately, 2024 has seen 3,950 in cuts in only 22 days 5,850 in cuts after only 25 days 6,200 cuts after only one month 8,500 in cuts after only two months.\n\nThese layoffs went deep, too. Niantic cut roughly one in four employees (and cancelled several titles), Epic Games cut 16% of its staff (and divested several percentage points more), Unity laid off 15% last year (and then another 25% in January 2024), Riot dropped 11%, CD Projekt Red shed 10%, while Microsoft gaming lost 8.6%, Sony PlayStation 8%, Bungie 8%, with EA at 6% in 2023 and another 5% in 2024, while Ubisoft’s precise numbers are not known. Amazon laid off more than a thousand employees across its various gaming divisions, including Twitch; As Embracer continues its widely-predicted implosion, trying to summarize which groups and people have and haven’t been laid off is futile. These figures are limited, too, as they don’t count venture-backed startups, nor the many gaming journalists laid off at The Washington Post, Kotaku, Inverse, Waypoint, etc., outlets that by rights should benefit from gaming’s ascendency. There are other drawbacks to just focusing on layoffs. In Q4 2023, ByteDance announced it would sell and shut down the entirety of its gaming division — even though it had become one of the most powerful, popular, and revenue generating companies in the world (crossing $100B in annual revenue in mid-2023). The company essentially shut down its Pico VR/MR division, too, even as Apple geared up.\n\nThere are several reasons behind the many layoffs detailed above, but the first may be the most important. It’s also the most overlooked and most counter-narrative: video game revenues are falling. And the explanations (excuses) touted throughout 2021 and 2022 have since been invalidated and in the process, put darker clouds over forecasts that were already being revised downwards.\n\nIn nominal terms, U.S. consumer spend on video games (including software, hardware, and accessories across all platforms, but excluding Web3/NFTs) was $57.2 billion in 2023, up only 1.1% over 2022, which had fallen 5% versus 2021. Compared to 2021, spending in 2023 is therefore still down 4.1%. Compared to 2020, revenues are up only 2.0%, with an anemic 0.7% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). 2019 is the most favorable comparison, as 2023 is up 27% since (6.2% compounded), but this reference frame is misleading, as 91% of the growth happened in 2020.\n\nThese are not great numbers. And worse still, these numbers are nominal in a time that has seen 40-year highs in inflation, with average U.S. CPI up 19% since 2019. In real terms, U.S. gaming revenues in 2023 are 2.1% under 2022, 14.3% under 2021, 13.6% under 2020, and up only 6.9% from 2019 (1.7% CAGR). In contrast, real GDP growth in the United States has averaged 2.0% annually since 2019 and 3.1% since 2020, meaning that the gaming industry has fallen well short of the average sector for three years. This shortfall occurred despite the first industry-wide price hike for premium games in decades, with many publishers announcing that new releases for Generation 9 consoles (which launched November 2020) would be $70, not $60, a jump of nearly 17%.\n\nInsomniac’s Spider-Man is a great case study. The first title, released in 2018 for the PlayStation 4, is believed to have had a development budget around $100 million. The 2020 spinoff, Miles Morales, which had a higher-fidelity PlayStation 5 version, cost $156 million to make. 2023’s Spider-Man 2 is an epic leap over its already beloved predecessors — benefitting from a NYC map that covers not just Manhattan but also Brooklyn and Queens, and offering more than seven hours of mocap cinematics, and thrilling set pieces — yet its cost grew to more than $315MM (I’m proud to have a 100% on the title). Spider-Man 2’s five and quarter hours of cinematics alone cost a reported $40 million. The first Halo, 2001’s Combat Evolved, cost $10–$20MM, whereas the 2021 version is said to have exceeded half a billion dollars.\n\nUnfortunately, however, there has not been nearly enough growth in the number of AAA console/PC games, nor the average playtime or purchases from each user, to support these cost increases on an average basis. In many cases, even the top performing titles are struggling to make the math work. The first Spider-Man title sold over 22 million units, while Miles Morales sold 10-15MM. Early sales declines suggest Spider-Man 2 may fall short of both of its predecessors. And according to some reports, Insomniac has considered splitting up Spider-Man 3 into two $50 parts in order to address its $385MM budget. There are twice as many active Xboxes today as there were at the peak of the first Halo, but that’s a ways away from offsetting the 33x cost increase.\n\nIt’s common to hear that these titles could and should be made cheaper, but such reductions come at great risk in an environment with little growth and entrenched live services giants. Having released two Spider-Man titles over the preceding five years at $60 each, Insomniac needed to offer far more than just “more Spider-Man” for its $70 follow-up. And it certainly did. In fact, Spider-Man 2 helps demonstrate an ongoing challenge with the industry - packaged title prices are too low. Yes, there was just a $10 price hike for Gen 9 games ($60 to $70), but during Gen 5 and 6 in the 1990s, the typical came ran $40-60, or $76-115 in 2023 dollars. Not only have games become longer, on average, and more highly produced and capable, their real price has plummeted. And compared to alternative leisure activities (e.g. Buying a digital copy of an equally-good three hourlong Spider-Man movie or watching it in theaters, attending a concert, etc.), it is one of the cheapest forms of entertainment per hour and getting cheaper. Gamers hate the idea of paying more - and the success and quality of FTP games makes this harder - but they probably should be more expensive, if just to keep up with the price of the average good.\n\nWhile increased fidelity (auditory, visual, performance, etc.) has increased cost by far more than it has expanded unit sales or revenue, these investments have become largely tablestakes. The original Last of Us was released in 2013, and even as a brand-new franchise, boasted an hour and half of full motion capture cutscenes and an original score from Gustavo Santaolalla, who had recently become the only composer to ever win back-to-back Oscars for Best Score (Brokeback Mountain and Babel). It’s telling, to this end, that the HBO adaptation, which was also scored by Santaolalla and repurposes his original work, makes extensive use of the game’s dialogue, camera angles, sets, and direction. The second Last of Us game, released in 2020, was over nine hours of cutscenes (Santaolalla also returned), and cost $220 million.\n\nNot all titles need to emulate the Last of Us – a game famous for its cinematic quality and was not a pioneer, nor particularly well-known for its gameplay. Still, much though players might claim otherwise, expectations around visuals, the size and variety of an open world, the number and quality of side missions, the quality of character models and performances, et al, are set by these market leaders (which are often remade and remastered, thus resetting the bar in the years where there isn’t a sequel). It’s also worth stressing that many of these leaders, including The Last of Us and Spider-Man, as well as The Legend of Zelda, Starfield, Halo, are produced by the console platform – the business model of these titles is therefore not just their own sales, but driving adoption of console that then takes 30% of all other game sales. And the exceptions are, well, exceptional. CD Projekt Red spent $436 million on Cyberpunk 2077 and its DLC expansion – a budget possible only because it followed up CDRP’s The Witcher III, the 8th best selling game of the last 25 years, and because CDPR is based in Poland, where developer salaries are roughly 50% cheaper in USD. Many publishers have (or will soon) laid off employees so that their roles can instead be outsourced to a (much cheaper) foreign work-for-hire services studio. Indeed, there is a growing consensus that to make the games (or sequels) that players demand, it’s no longer possible to be a purely domestic and/or employee-based studio. Some are even moving to a model where key art and level design are managed in high cost markets, but with levels and models built abroad.\n\nAnd brutal though single-player games have become, it’s particularly hard to launch a large live services title – one that can sustain hundreds of hours of play each year and year-after-year, and is by far the largest opportunity in gaming.\n\nOver the past decade, many of the most notable efforts to launch a new live services giant were cancelled prior to launch, such as Cyberpunk 2077 Online and The Last of Us: Factions (scrapped after the enormous success and the related sales boost of the TV adaptation). Several others were shuttered early despite their original success. Rockstar’s Red Dead Redemption 2 is one of the five best-selling games over the last quarter century, but the final update to Red Dead Redemption Online came only 20 months after its launch in November 2019. Rockstar’s GTA Online is still topping the charts 122 months after its debut. The Nintendo Switch is Nintendo’s second best-selling console and Animal Crossing: New Horizons, launched at the height of COVID, is the platform’s second best-selling title. Yet Nintendo was not able to (or not interested in) sustaining ACNH (the last update came only a year and half after the game’s debut despite the fact it sold 3x as many copies as its predecessor).\n\nIn February 2019, BioWare, the EA-owned studio behind Mass Effect, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, launched Anthem, only to announce a year later that updates would be “paused” so that BioWare could “substantial[ly] reinvent” the game. A year after that, Anthem development was terminated. In August 2020, Ubisoft launched Hyper Scape, the company’s take on the still red-hot battle royale genre. Two months later, Ubisoft announced the game was “not able to achieve” expectations and would be overhauled so that it could “reach its full potential.” In January 2022, Ubisoft announced the title was shutting down.\n\nA month after the debut of Anthem, Square Enix launched The Avengers, the first AAA adaptation of the (still at its peak) super-franchise since the Marvel Cinematic Universe began in theaters in 2018. Unfortunately, the title never broke out and Square Enix called it quits after 2.5 years.\n\nIn July 2021, Splitgate, a sort of Halo-meets-Portal shooter, launched its open beta across PC, Xbox, and PlayStation, amassing 600,000 downloads on consoles within a week and 13 million over two months. The initial success of the title landed 1047 Games a $100MM investment at a $1.5 billion valuation in September, led by Lightspeed Venture Partners. A year later, 1047 announced it was ending development of Splitgate (with the title remaining online) to instead build an “entirely new shooter” — an effort that is likely to take years.\n\nAmazon’s $200-500 million MMORPG, New World, launched to considerable audiences in September 2021 – peaking at nearly a million concurrent users and an estimated 10-15 million in its first 30 days. Three months later, players were down 96%, and two years later, it has more than halved again. Today, the game averages roughly 300,000 monthly players – a still substantial sum, but far from one which earns its initial budget or justifies substantially ongoing investment.\n\nIn July 2022, Warner Bros. Games launched MultiVersus, a brawler based on its parent company’s IP (think Super Warner Bros.) Though the title was technically in “open beta” and free-to-play, players could purchase in-game characters, battle passes, and even “founders packs” — and did so in great volumes; MultiVersus topped sales charts in its launch month and ranked 5th a month later. By its third month, Warner Bros. Games announced over 20 million had played the game, which won Best Fighting Game of 2022 at the Video Game Awards in December of that year and the same award at March 2023’s D.I.C.E. Awards. But then Warner announced that the game would be taken offline for at least a year in order to apply learnings from the “open beta.” Early signals suggest that Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, which has been in development since at least 2012 and is Warner Bros. Games first big release after Hogwarts Legacy, will also struggle. In 2023, Bethesda published the live services-aspirant Redfall, but received brutal 53% and 56% Metacritic score for the PC and Xbox editions of the title, and even lower user scores. The business case for further investment is hard to see.\n\nOverall, there has been only one new AAA live services titan in the West over the past several years — partly because there have been no major breakthroughs in game tech or play. 2016 had Pokémon Go, but there have been no hit AR titles since. 2017 saw the emergence of the battle royale genre, which has become the biggest AAA game genre in history and has led to the creation of PUBG, Fortnite Battle Royale, and Free Fire (all 2017), with Call of Duty Mobile and Apex Legends following in 2019 and Call of Duty Warzone in 2020. The one exception is Genshin Impact, a free-to-play AAA cross-platform title released in September 2020 and made by the Chinese developer-publisher miHoYo. Genshin generated over $3 billion in its first year (more than any other title in history with the possible exception of Fortnite), with roughly a quarter of its revenue generated in the United States. In a matter of months, Genshin proved that Chinese game-makers had mastered AAA gaming, free-to-play gaming, Zelda-like open world gaming (and quality), and worldwide blockbuster gaming. Notably, however, the majority of Genshin’s revenue is generated from players in Asia, on mobile devices, and through gambling-style “Gacha” mechanisms (e.g. loot box mechanics) that are sometimes illegal, widely looked down upon, and now rarely used in the West.\n\nThe underlying challenges facing live services titles are the same as those facing single-player packaged ones – but far greater. After all, such a game is not trying to be a brief snack, but to change a player’s diet altogether, which means contending with all current live services titles, rather than just the few packaged titles released in and around the same time. More challenging still, this game must all change the diets of the player’s friends. Even if a publisher produces, in a simplified sense, a Game 4 of 10 friends prefer to the one they presently “main,” their experience playing that Game is nevertheless inferior if their six friends don’t come over. As such, this new game will struggle to retain the four it once attracted - and overall, those four users probably find that most of their needs and wants are already met by the games they already play and which keep being updated, too.\n\nRetention, not acquisition, is ultimately the real contest for a live services game – and the volume of content that is needed to sustain ongoing play is substantially higher than 5-6 years ago too. This isn’t just volume of cosmetics, but the underlying content players consume too, map updates, missions, weapons etc., and their velocity, too. It’s financially impractical for smaller-sized publishers and studios (e.g. 1047 Games) to have a large live services operation (people, plans, infrastructure) ready to go when their game launches - even though they naturally hope for a blockbuster open or at least second-base hit. Even after a game breaks out, it’s risky to staff up as these investments are predicated upon retention curves that have not yet been proven, while competing with entrenched giants that boast hundreds or thousands of (profitably employed) developers, larger and more stable user bases (and thus stronger network effects) and consider lock-in (Fortnite players have spent at least $20 billion on avatars only available inside its ecosystem – investment that is hard to leave behind). Many games, such as Square Enix’s The Avengers, have been able to sustain a decently sized player base (hundreds of thousands of users), but not enough to justify ongoing investment.\n\nMore recently, the brutal upfront cost to AAA game development and requirements of ongoing support has forced many publishers to shift away from free-to-play releases and instead focus on traditional packaged sales. The former model substantially increases a title’s revenue ceiling by expanding its potential player base and reducing friction to customer acquisition, but it also lowers the title’s floor to near zero. Premium sales, conversely, have a lower ceiling and higher floor that’s also easier to predict based on awareness and pre-orders, and also provides the publisher more time to fine-tune microtransactions and live services monetization, after which they can (and often do) go FTP. FTP also doesn’t fit all titles equally well, either, as cosmetics (and IP mashups) fit a title like Fortnite better than, say, Tom Clancy or Battlefield, and non-cosmetic purchases can easily distort the game’s fairness.\n\nLastly, growing costs and declining odds has also made it difficult for any large game publisher to bet on new IP (there’s no joy in detailing the failures here, so they’ll not be mentioned) or even gameplay styles. Upon cancelling its multiplayer version of The Last of Us late last year, Naughty Dog issued a press release containing the following explanation: “In ramping up to full production, the massive scope of our ambition became clear. To release and support The Last of Us Online we’d have to put all our studio resources behind supporting post launch content for years to come, severely impacting development on future single-player games. So, we had two paths in front of us: become a solely live service games studio or continue to focus on single-player narrative games that have defined Naughty Dog’s heritage.”\n\nPlaying the Hits\n\nThat there is no new revenue titan is not to say there aren’t new and profitable titles and franchises. $185 billion a year, even with limited growth and turnover, is still a lot of opportunity. Riot’s Valorant, which was released in 2020, is up to 28MM MAUs – more than its 2021 average. And Nexon/Embark’s The FINALS, which debuted in December 2023, could be the next blockbuster cross-platform competitive shooter. At the same time, both titles are exception cases. Riot is owned by the world’s largest video game publisher, Tencent, operates one of the five most popular games in the world, League of Legends, has over 4,500 total employees, and is one of the few companies in the world that successfully self-distributes its games on PC. Nexon is another one of the world’s largest gaming companies, having produced several multi-billion dollar franchises including KartRider, MapleStory, and Dungeon & Fighter, and though its CEO has long argued against $100 million dollar budgeted games, has declined to share The Finals’ budget, or whether it exceeded that threshold.\n\nIt’s also not clear that either title has expanded the gaming market, rather than taken share from other shooters (including the two-decade-only Counter-Strike: Global Offensive). Shifting users and monetization between games (as with older to new generations of consoles) isn’t growth, it’s just movement. And part of what has made Valorant such a great shooter is also what constrains its revenue and player-base: it can only be played on PC. The Finals is cross-platform, though a substantial portion of its playerbase is in China and it is showing early signs of significant retention and monetization challenges. In January 2024, Nexon announced that Warhaven, another free-to-play multiplayer live services title published by the company and released in September 2023 , would be shut down. \"To create a game that could be cherished and enjoyed over an extended period, we invested much consideration and effort,” Nexon said, “Despite all the shortcomings, we will deeply cherish the warm affection and support you have sent towards Warhaven in our hearts. Thank you for being part of Warhaven's journey.\"\n\nAmong Us, first released in 2018, was an explosive success during the pandemic — passing 500MM lifetime players, peaking at 3.8MM concurrent users, and averaging more than 200,000 concurrent users in all of September 2020 (up from only a few hundred three months earlier). Yet lifetime revenue for the title is estimated at $100–$200MM — an outstanding sum for InnerSloth, the game’s developers, which had fewer than a dozen employees — but marginal at the industry level. But the magic didn’t last: by June 2021, users were down 95% and have halved again since.\n\nI want to be clear that there have been many indie successes over the last several years — Hades, Valheim, Dave the Diver, Stardew Valley, Cocoon, etc. But it’s worth returning to the opening from this essay: nearly all of the hits of 2023 are sequels, remasters, updates, or remakes. The title most likely to displace last decade’s biggest hit, Grand Theft Auto V, from the sales charts this decade is likely to be Grand Theft Auto VI, due in 2025.\n\nAnd most of the big, new efforts from the major publishers? They seem likely to financially disappoint – and the few titles that thrive are unlikely to cover the failures. This observation is behind a great deal of the layoffs of 2022, 2023, and now 2024. The major game-makers are profitable, some have even seen greater profits in each of these years. Yet faced with rising costs and lowering prospects of success, they are now “rationalizing” their portfolios. In some cases, this is being more realistic about whether a current title can grow or even sustain its current userbase, and reducing staffing accordingly. In particular, though, publishers are scrutinizing their pipeline of titles in active development and their incubation projects, too. Many would-be games are being shutdown as a result, which leaves talented developers, artists, and testers without a P&L - and at a time when other games at the same company are being shutdown or scoped back for the very same reasons. There are now fifteen studios at Activision supporting the Call of Duty franchise.\n\nVenture Crash\n\nNearly all media categories face growing concentration of revenues around a few major content-makers and franchises. Yet the uniqueness of games – their stronger network effects, longer runtimes, ability to be updated, ability to price discriminate to the point many users might generate $0 in revenue but others tens of thousands per year - makes the category far more insular, even though it requires no intermediary distributor.\n\nIt would take 70 hours to watch the entirety of Game of Thrones – half of the average American’s monthly TV time. The average Fortnite player spends forty hours a month playing Fortnite… and has been doing so for years. There are constantly new musician artists rising to prominence as generations turnover, artists age or come of age, and new writers or sounds emerge. Movies spent barely five years dominated by Marvel and other comicbook films – but not as long as many imagine – and during that time, many other franchises ascended and hits were launched, too. Due to the volume of TV that’s watched each year and the length of the average season, there are constantly new hits in the category, too. Books are even more permissive.\n\nGaming’s ossification creates a vicious cycle – studios don’t take (or are sometimes punished for) risk-taking, which means less innovation in mechanics, and less likelihood of expanding the market by appealing to new gamers or increasing engagement from occasional ones. Capcom is the best example of this dynamic – while many of its competitors struggled to build new IP or adapt old IP to live services, Capcom has thrived specifically because it has focused on single-player titles (and in large part, remaking its old hits). But eventually, those remakes run out, and rarely do they expand the market.\n\nMany of the challenges above are reflected in the funding of video gaming startups— funding that, in theory, should help create the next disruptive gaming startup, platform, or game mechanic. During the pandemic, as gaming revenues, playtime, and player bases surged, so too did the category’s venture funding. Not only did it become easier for gaming VCs to raise substantial funds, but many non-gaming funds began investing in gaming companies, too, after seeing those hockey sticks profit curves and fielding calls from LPs wondering why their investment dollars weren’t participating in said growth. The consequences have not been great.\n\nA lack of sector experience and rush-for-sector exposure has led to bloated rounds that have made subsequent fundraising efforts difficult for startups, while also encouraging bloated cost structures at these same companies, and diluting already-scarce talent across many more (and statistically doomed) startups. Worse still, the abundance of funding did not produce new hits. There are some solid new studios and titles, but VCs are in the business of home runs, not doubles, and there just haven’t been any. Which makes sense: insurgent startups are hard to build in low-growth markets with stagnant sales charts. The result is a crash of funding.\n\nAfter the simulation concluded, each behavior of each agent was reviewed and evaluated for believability using common behavioral models (e.g., TrueSkill) and variance tests (Kruskal-Wallis). Each agent was also “interviewed” for “self-knowledge” (details on their life), “memory” (such as whom they met and what happened during the simulation), “plans” (what they will do and when), “reactions” (what they would do in case of a fire or upon seeing a friend on the street), and “reflections” (what inspires them or what they would buy for another agent’s birthday). Independent human “crowdworkers” were also hired and asked to watch each agent’s two-day experience and then role-play as these agents while answering the same questions. The Stanford/Google researchers found that the LLM agents consistently outperformed their human role-players and exceeded the believability benchmark. I don’t believe LLMs will enrich AAA narratives or side quests in the near future (it’s already very clear when the latter is outsourced to a low-quality work-for-hire shop), but new types of experiences will eventually emerge and may be able to expand the market to new players or extend engagement among existing ones in ways the past five years have not.\n\nThere is also an argument that slimmed down studios, benefiting from lower costs (and thus lower thresholds for returns, hypothetically), faster development processes (also hypothetically), and a recognition that the strategy of the last few years didn’t work (same), can be more innovative. Countering this is the very real fact the layoffs are traumatizing and there is a widespread fear they’re not over, and that in such times, many employees prefer to work on the “sure thing” projects versus speculative incubations (for similar reasons, those laid off are sometimes the most imaginative of employees, they just weren’t attached to an as-yet working P&L). Epic’s decision to sell Gears of War, one of the most successful new franchises of the 2000s, is a slightly different case study here, but still instructive. Founder and CEO Tim Sweeney sold the franchise to Microsoft, which had exclusively published the title for Xbox, in 2014, with Sweeney later saying the first Gears of War (2006) cost only $12 million, but the fourth entry would have cost $100 million to develop ($131 million in 2023) and that anything less than total success would \"put us out of business.\" Instead, the company focused on Fortnite: Save the World, which began development no later than 2011 and released in 2017, with Sweeney saying the game “shipped [with] 25 people.” Within six months, Epic had assigned the “majority” of its 700 total employees to support the title. Again, this is a fairly unique situation as Epic was only able to so rapidly scale its development team because they also operated the Unreal Engine and were (presumably) developing a few other original titles that were consequently deprioritized, too. The company’s ownership of UE is also part of why they could pivot Fortnite so quickly - it took Call of Duty another two years to launch a mobile battle royale (which was developed by a Tencent subsidiary, not Activision) and three years to launch Call of Duty Warzone (made by Activision).\n\nOn the mobile front, the impending regulation (i.e. break-up) of app store controls should be a boon to developers of all sizes, though it will take longer than many hoped. The primary hope is that the ability to directly distribute or monetize these games might offer developers 10-15% higher net margins (direct payments will need some discount to the customer in order to beat native IAP, then the publisher must pay 3-4% to payment providers). Though 10-15% might sound modest, this could grow a publisher’s profits on the title severalfold and place them on a far more probable path to breakeven in the first place - both of which should greater investment in existing and future games. A reduction in app store controls will also enable true cloud gaming apps (which are, practically speaking, prohibited on iOS) and Web 3 games (same). Unlocking new margins, business models, and technologies can only help the gaming industry – even if one is skeptical about current opportunities. At the same time, the largest (though far from sole) beneficiaries will be the existing gaming giants. Candy Crush will be able to drive direct downloads and payments, but many unknown titles will not. Microsoft is planning a mobile gaming store, but companies without Xbox, Game Pass, and exclusive titles such as Call of Duty Mobile and Candy Crush will likely struggle to do the same. Instead, they will pay Microsoft for distribution (but on the plus, probably less than the App Store charges today, which will also put pressure on the App Store). And Microsoft will get bigger.\n\nGenerational change is another reason for optimism. Platform games in the “user-generated content” sector such as Roblox (2006) and Minecraft (2011) are arguably the biggest breakouts of the last few years, growing from low single- or double-digit millions of users to hundreds of millions or more. Roblox now has over 350MM MAUs – more than the Nintendo Switch, Xbox, and PlayStation platforms combined. Yet these users are mostly under 18 (42% are under 13) and thus for a variety of regulatory and income-related reasons, spend very little and play comparatively less per week, too. PlayStation, for example, has a third of Roblox MAUs (123MM versus 355MM), about 85% of its DAU (~60MM versus 70MM), but 10% higher monthly hours of engagement (~6 billion versus 5.5 billion) and close to $30 billion in revenue versus Roblox’s $2.5B. What’s remarkable and inspiring about Roblox, though, is the way it might presage growth that’s to come to the “AAA” gaming space as this cohort matures. Roblox’s very ascendence tracks precisely to the maturation of “iPad native” generation – a generation that is now approaching adulthood. If so, there may be a sustained growth spurt that begins over the next few years. Not all of these players will shift to consoles and gaming PCs, but they may skip the casual mobile game genre that drives 85% of downloads but only 35% of spend, and instead show a greater preference for mid-core titles.\n\nIt’s also worth nothing that as gaming overall pulled back in users, usage, and spend, Roblox overall has not. Instead, it has not just maintained its post-pandemic surge, it has maintained its accelerated growth rate. Certainly, the platform has lost many players, seen many reduce their play time, and experienced per user drops in spending - but as mentioned earlier, there are 140 million new gamers born every year, and thus also 140 million who age into Roblox each year, too.\n\nDevices are another bright spot. Though there will always be a large performance gap between smartphones and consoles, the materiality of this gap is shrinking. It’s now possible to play high-end PlayStation 4 or Xbox One (released in 2013) games on the newest iPhone 15 Pro (released in 2023) with only modest impacts to visuals. Yes, the Gen 9 consoles (released in 2020) are far more powerful than Gen 8, but the advancements are primarily graphical (e.g. 8K versus 1080p, 120 versus 60 FPS), which has, for the most part, shown to drive up cost more than revenues.. This trend suggests that by the time Gen 10 consoles arrive at the end of the decade, many high-end mobile devices will be suitable substitutes. Not all console grade-games are suitable for mobile or touch, but others, such as EA Sports FC 24 (formerly known as FIFA 24), may see large audience expansion. For similar reasons, the Switch 2 may also expand the market over time if it can match its predecessor’s success. Though the device sold extraordinarily well, its software sales ratio was relatively low, as previously mentioned, and sales were primarily of Nintendo’s own titles. A primary cause for both factors was the original Switch’s GPU, which was already more than four years old at the time the device premiered and is now over a decade old. As a result, many of the top titles of the last seven years were not available on the device, while those such as Fortnite were playable only with extraordinary technical concessions. The Switch 2 will also fall well short of other Gen 9 consoles, though it’s expected to run nearly all major cross-platform games and to a reasonable level of performance. Perhaps towards the end of the decade and a lower-cost Apple Vision and more powerful Meta Quest, VR games will begin to drive double-digit billions in revenue.\n\nWhereas most media categories generate half of their revenues from ads, AAA games have been slow to embrace such an income stream. Initially, the impediments were technical. For the first several decades, all video gaming was “offline” and each part of the game was locked long before a player saw it. As a result, there was no way to update a game’s in-game advertising, meaning any placed ads could quickly become out of date. This is also why books typically lack ads, save for those promoting the author’s other works, even though newspapers and magazines historically relied upon them. Ford won’t pay much for an ad that, for most readers, is touting the “specs” of an old car (Ford would probably consider such impressions harmful). Technical limitations of this kind no longer exist for video games, as they can now be updated over the internet, but the cultural consequences endure. With the exception of casual mobile games like Candy Crush, the gaming community is largely unfamiliar with and highly resistant to in-game advertising. Yet just as the lack of profits and advertising in streaming video created a business case for every participant to add advertising, a similar effect seems likely in AAA games.\n\nRoblox has already made ads a core part of its growth story to investors – and its easy to see why: the company currently incurs $146 in costs for every $100 in revenues. Some of these costs should decline as a percentage of revenues as revenues scale, such as General & Administrative expenses (14%) and Sales & Marketing (5%), which combined could probably save five or eventually ten of the 46 points needed to just breakeven. Another core area is R&D, currently 46% of revenues (most tech companies spend 7-15%, though Slack is also 40%), though even if it were wiped out entirely, Roblox is still underwater, and the company’s choice to reinvest so much of its revenues is why it has been able to continue growing its user and developers bases. Roblox’s core problem is its marginal costs: 24% of revenue is paid in app store fees, 27% paid to Roblox developers, and 33% is spent on infrastructure and safety costs for a total of 84%. App store fees are fixed as a percentage of consumer spending, and thus the only way for their share of revenue to decline is… through advertising, as app stores do not take a cut of such revenues! Roblox could theoretically reduce developer revenue sharing, but instead, the company aspires to increase the share of its revenues paid to developers over time as this would enable developers to build even greater experiences. This leaves infrastructure and safety costs, yet these too have proven relatively stable per user hour – and users hours continue to increase (which is good, but expensive, too).. As such, Roblox needs to find a way to increase its revenue per hour – and without massively increasing the technical cost of to operate that hour (e.g. hybrid cloud streaming might substantially increase fidelity and experiential capabilities, but also lead to higher server and bandwidth fees). And so again, the solution looks like advertising, with Roblox unveiling a suite of new ad products last year that includes more sponsored search results, promoted worlds, in-world billboards, and in-world portals that might take a player from Adopt Me! to Mercdesworld. For similar reasons, Microsoft is reportedly looking at ways to introduce streaming video-style ads into its cloud gaming streaming service. At present, the company does not charge customers more to cloud streaming versus play their games locally on a PC or Xbox, even though this involves costly real-time bandwidth and renting space in an Azure data center (among other costs). This is particularly tricky for free-to-play titles such as Fortnite during which Microsoft might generate as little as $0 in direct revenue per hour.\n\nMicrosoft can easily build the tech to substitute loading screens with 5-to-30 commercials – and there is an abundant supply of said ads. Roblox can also easily integrate “promoted worlds” and search results in its platform, and offer developers pre-fabricated billboards that display ads. For years, game-makers have been cutting deals for sponsored items, too, such as Monster Energy drink in Death Stranding and or perimeter ads surrounding the court in NBA 2K. And Unity, Google, and even publishers such as AppLovin have established ad networks which display banner ads overlaid on or placed under mobile games. The holy grail, though, is the establishment of programmatic networks that can place ads into any number of 3D virtual worlds and in the appropriate context. Such a solution is necessary for ads to generate meaningful revenues for both indie titles and AAA titles as it maximizes the supply of ad buyers and the number of potential ad placements. Unfortunately, this sacred solution remains elusive - and for many reasons."
