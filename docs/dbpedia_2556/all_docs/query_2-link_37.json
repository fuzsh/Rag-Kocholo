If you live in the US or another jurisdiction which allows you to agree to arbitration, you and Niantic agree that any disputes arising out of or related to this License Agreement or use of Lightship or the Niantic Wayfarer Application be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right: (a) to bring an individual action in small claims court and (b) to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other Intellectual Property rights (the action described in this clause (b), an “IP Protection Action”. Notwithstanding this arbitration agreement, Niantic reserves the right to bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction against you to stop and/or seek compensation for the intentional or willful misuse or abuse (e.g., hacking) of Lightship or the Niantic Wayfarer Application. Unless both you and Niantic otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s or entity’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this class action waiver is held unenforceable, then the parties’ agreement to arbitrate will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this Section will survive any termination of this License Agreement. If the terms of this Section are found unenforceable as to any claim for relief, that claim must be severed from the arbitration and brought pursuant to Section 15.6, “Governing Law and Exclusive Venue.” All other claims will be arbitrated. The arbitrator, and not any court or agency, will have exclusive authority to (a) determine the scope and enforceability of this arbitration agreement and (b) resolve any dispute related to its interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation including any claim that all or any part of it is void or voidable.\n\nArbitration Rules. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, including the Optional Rules for Emergency Measures of Protection (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by this Section. (The AAA Rules are available at https://www.adr.org/Rules or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.\n\nArbitration Process. A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules (the AAA provides a general Demand for Arbitration). The single arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within fourteen (14) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.\n\nArbitration Location and Procedure Unless you and Niantic otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in a confidential manner, in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and Niantic submit to the arbitrator, and there will be no other discovery conducted (such as depositions), unless the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration. Notwithstanding the arbitrator’s discretion, absent a showing of good cause, in no event will the parties be allowed more than three (3) depositions per side, and there will be no corporate deposition of the type contemplated by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 30(b)(6) and California Code of Civil Procedure 2025.230.\n\nArbitrator’s Decision The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will be treated as confidential, and will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Confirmation and enforcement of the arbitration award may be done in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator’s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of Section 13, “Limitation of Liability” as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. If the arbitrator determines that a party has generally prevailed in the arbitration proceeding, then the arbitrator will award to that party its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses related to the arbitration, including filing fees, arbitrator compensation, attorney’s fees and legal costs.\n\nGoverning Law and Exclusive Venue. To the extent that this License Agreement allows you or Niantic to initiate litigation in court, other than for small claims court actions, both you and Niantic agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of and venue in the state and federal courts located in the Northern District of California. Each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts. This License Agreement and your use of Lightship and the Niantic Wayfarer Application are governed by the laws of the State of California, excluding its conflicts-of-law rules.\n\nGeneral\n\nModifications. We may from time to time make changes to any portion of this License Agreement. We will publish any changes to this License Agreement on the Lightship Website which you should check regularly. If you do not agree to the modified License Agreement, you will immediately discontinue your use of Lightship and the Niantic Wayfarer Application. Your continued use of Lightship or the Niantic Wayfarer Application constitutes your acceptance of the modified License Agreement.\n\nEntire Agreement. This License Agreement sets out all the terms agreed between the parties and supersedes all other agreements between the parties relating to its subject matter, save as specifically set forth herein. Except for those specifically referenced under and incorporated into this License Agreement, any terms or conditions on a quote, purchase order, invoice, or other similar document related to this License Agreement, Lightship, or the Niantic Wayfarer Application, are void.\n\nSeverability. If any term (or part of a term) of this License Agreement is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the rest of this License Agreement will remain in effect.\n\nAssignment. You may not assign or transfer any of your rights or obligations under this License Agreement without Niantic’s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer this License Agreement without such consent will be null and void. Niantic may freely assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations under this License Agreement without restriction.\n\nPurpose. Lightship and the Niantic Wayfarer Application are intended for use by businesses and not for consumer purposes. To the maximum extent permitted by law, you hereby acknowledge and agree that consumer laws do not apply. If any consumer laws do apply and cannot otherwise be lawfully excluded, nothing in this License Agreement will restrict, exclude or modify any statutory warranties, guarantees, rights or remedies you may have, and Niantic’s liability will be limited to the provision of a replacement service.\n\nNo Agency or Third-Party Beneficiaries. This License Agreement does not create any agency, partnership, or joint venture between the parties and does not confer any benefits on any third-party unless it expressly states that it does.\n\nForce Majeure. Neither you nor Niantic will be liable for any losses, nonperformance or delay in performance by reason of any act of God or other causes beyond their control.\n\nNotices. Any notices or other communications provided by Niantic under this License Agreement will be given (a) via email and effective upon receipt, or (b) on the Lightship Website and effective upon publication. For notices made by email, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted to the email address you provided.\n\nNo Waiver. Any failure to insist on or enforce strict performance of any provision of this License Agreement will not be construed as a waiver by Niantic of any provision or right we have to enforce this License Agreement.\n\nRemedies. Our exercise of any remedies under this License Agreement will be without prejudice to our other remedies under this License Agreement or otherwise.\n\nIn this License Agreement, the words “include” and “including” mean “including but not limited to.”"
