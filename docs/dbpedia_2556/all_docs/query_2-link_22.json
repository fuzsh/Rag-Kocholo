        "text": "Written by Oleksandr\n\nIn summer 2016 Pokémon GO mobile game was uniting people of all ages just like Olympic Games in Rio. An app for finding cute pocket monsters from our childhood has become insanely popular in no time: in 24 hours after launch it was on the top app list on App Store and Google Play. Today we will talk about the main features of this game and how much does it cost to make a game like Pokemon GO.\n\nYou may use our calculalor to estimate the approximate cost of app development\n\nWhat is Pokémon GO\n\nPokémon GO is an application connecting in-game objects with the real world objects in a way that the former are only available in certain physical locations, for example in the park or near the river. Apart from it, newest Pokemon game processes an image captured by the smartphone camera and overlays it with additional elements to create a so called augmented reality.\n\nOn the less powerful devices augmented reality mode is not available and users simply see a 3D game universe which is nonetheless connected with locations from the real world:\n\nPokemon GO rules are simple:\n\nYou launch an app, register and can use it when you device’s screen is on.\n\nThe main form of interaction is collecting Pokemon by throwing Poké Balls at them (usually you can’t catch them on the first try).\n\nSince they aren’t staying in one place and spawn in various locations, users have to actively move around the area or even the whole city to catch Pokemon.\n\nPlayers also need to renew their Poké Ball supplies on Poké Stops and can fight other Pokemon trainers in locations called gyms.\n\nThe distance you have walked and the number of Pokemon caught influence your level in the game.\n\nAnd now let’s discuss how to make a Pokemon game.\n\nPokémon GO like app development\n\nBefore we start, let’s think about essentials you need to create a Pokemon game:\n\nGame design\n\nGame engine\n\nApp prototype\n\nMap service and geolocation tools\n\nLogic for distributing objects on the map and game balance\n\nMeans to interact with device sensors\n\nServer for implementing interaction between users and storing their game data\n\nEvent notifications\n\nIn-game purchases\n\nGame graphics and sounds\n\nYou should also take into account the following factors that contributed to Pokemon GO success:\n\nFamous Pokemon brand that already had a number of fans with Pokemon apps being only one source of its popularity.\n\nExperience with augmented reality games development (Ingress). To make a game like Pokemon you need a lot of resources since data gathered by Ingress belongs to Niantic.\n\nPerfect timing for launch — summer in Northern Hemisphere when most people spend a fair amount of time outside.\n\nThe game requires a lot of undivided attention which makes it a habit-forming product. You need to take it into account if you want to create Pokemon GO like app.\n\nA great potential for viral growth: if you see a Pokemon, you’ve got to catch it right there and since people see others playing, they want to try it themselves.\n\nAnd now let’s see what it takes to build Android or iPhone games like Pokemon GO\n\n1. Game design\n\nBefore starting working on Pokemon like apps for Android or iOS, you need a concept and a design document (specifications). Game designer is usually the one who prepares them and further facilitates all development stages and gives the right tasks to developers, designers, illustrators, sound people, etc. Effective game design is crucial for your project, so it costs accordingly.\n\n2. Game engine\n\nWhat is a game engine and why do you need it? Game engine is a special software for bringing together all the resources used in the game (code, graphics, sounds) and managing them. Only very simple games can do without a game engine (and games similar to Pokemon GO don’t belong to this category). Plus, game engine makes game creation for Android and iOS or any other mobile platforms much easier. For example, Pokemon GO developers used Unity game engine.\n\n3. App prototype\n\nApp prototype of the Pokemon GO alternative shows how your app will look like and includes all of the screens used in it. Prototype is not yet an app, it only shows what functions, menus and other elements will be available to users when the app similar to Pokemon GO is ready. Prototyping is done with the help of special tools, such as InVision, Proto.io, Pixate or Flinto.\n\n4. Map service and geolocation tools\n\nSince prior to becoming a separate company Niantic was an inner Google startup, it is probably using Google Maps and location data under some special terms and conditions which are not available to anyone else. That’s why creating a Pokemon clone is not an easy task. In general, to create apps like Pokemon GO you will need to do the following:\n\nConnect Google API to your project, pay for a license (price depends on the data volume and number of requests per day). You can also use Open Street Maps which are free but they do not provide location photos.\n\nWrite functions for working with GPS on devices (geolocation). You need them for identifying device location and showing the right objects to users.\n\n5. Logic for distributing objects on the map and game balance\n\nHow to create an app like Pokemon GO that will become popular? You’ve got to aim for a natural feel. And to achieve it you need the objects to be distributed on the map in an organic and naturally looking way. You’ve got to identify:\n\nhow often new Pokemon will appear on the map\n\nwhich locations are more attractive for a certain Pokemon type and how their number changes in various hours of the day\n\nhow the popularity of a certain location influences the type and number of Pokemon one can expect to meet there\n\nGame balance is essential for a successful Pokemon GO alternative. If the game is well-balanced, newcomers don’t feel like it is too complicated to play while experienced players get enough challenges for it to stay fun and playable. After game balance is implemented, it is tested and adjusted accordingly.\n\n6. Means to interact with device sensors\n\nIn order to determine device position in space and the speed at which the person is moving (to know whether he or she is using a car or going on foot while using Pokemon like app) you need data from the sensors built into the smartphone:\n\nGyroscope determines device orientation in space.\n\nAccelerometer identifies acceleration speed of a smartphone.\n\nGPS identifies user’s position according to the global positioning network.\n\nWhen developing UARoads app for monitoring road quality we have closely worked with data captured by these sensors and can use our experience in Pokemon like apps development.\n\n7. Server for implementing interaction between users and storing their game data\n\nSince players belong to same game world, are using the same map and have to follow the same basic rules, this world needs to be generated somewhere, constantly evolve and interact with them. All this happen on the server which all the copies of the app similar to Pokemon GO installed on players’ devices use to interact with each other.\n\nThe server is also necessary for users to be able to transfer their game data to a new device in case they have bought a new one. Without a server for storing game data you won’t be able to create a strong and reliable game backend for iOS and Android game like Pokemon, so it’s an essential part of the overall game development.\n\nYou should also take into account that servers and databases should be ready for high loads so that players won’t be forced to wait:\n\n8. Event notifications\n\nRealtime events allow users to be instantly notified about what is happening within the game. Since Pokemon GO is played with a screen turned on, users see notifications and tips like these at once:\n\nRealtime events are implemented with Socket connection that allows you to exchange data with the player instantly and in a duplex mode when he or she is online. When the user is offline, server can send push-notification via third-party services which players receive with a small delay.\n\n9. In-game purchases\n\nThere’re several monetization models for mobile startups out there and Pokemon GO is using a model with in-app purchases. Players can buy objects like Poké Balls, Lure Modules, Egg Incubators, etc. There are both cheaper (20 Poké Balls for 100 coins) and more expensive listings (6 lures for 680 coins). It is an important aspect since it helps beginners to painlessly make their first in-app purchase and encourages experienced players to buy items in bulks to save coins.\n\nIt is better to implement purchases for each platform via its native service since those services look more trustworthy to users. For example, if you’re developing an Android app, the obvious choice would be Google Play In-app Billing. By using this service you will be able to painlessly fill the app with purchasable items from the developer console without updating the app too often.\n\n10. Game graphics and sounds\n\nPlayers expect modern games to look seamlessly in terms of graphics. Since Pokemon GO uses 3D models of Pokemon, a significant part of game’s cost will be spent on their creation. It would also be better if 3D modelling is done alongside the Pokemon GO development process so that all parts of the app will be brought together in a timely manner. Of course, there’s Unity Asset Store where you can buy pre-made models but they won’t help you to create something unique like Pokemon GO.\n\nAs for sounds, Audio Jungle, Music Loops or The Music Case offer some options if you’re on a budget.\n\nPokémon GO like app development costs\n\nNow when you are familiar with the game development process, let’s take a look at Pokemon GO like video game pricing:\n\nClient application and game design — $60-100K\n\nUI/UX — $6,5K\n\nBack End — $80K\n\nServer expenses — $150K\n\nQA and testing — $50K\n\nGame models with animation — $100K\n\nSounds — $15-20K\n\nManagement — $20K\n\nSo total Pokemon GO like app development cost is about $450-600K. Of course, it’s an approximate cost and actual mobile app development costs will differ based on the required features.\n\nNeed MVP development, iOS and Android apps or prototyping?
