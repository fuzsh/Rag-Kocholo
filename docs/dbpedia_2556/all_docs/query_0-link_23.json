        "text": "Ingress is an augmented-reality game by Google’s Niantic Labs that focuses on the control and manipulation of “mysterious energy sources” at landmarks, public art, and similar locations. Players are split between two factions — “The Enlightened” that want to embrace this energy, and “The Resistance” that wants to safeguard humanity from it — and must work together to accomplish more difficult tasks that can’t be accomplished alone.\n\nIngress initially released on Android in 2013, and is now available on iOS.\n\nA mysterious energy has been unearthed by a team of scientists in Europe. The origin and purpose of this force is unknown, but some researchers believe it is influencing the way we think. We must control it or it will control us.\n\nimages via Ingress\n\nThanks Eddie Codel!"
