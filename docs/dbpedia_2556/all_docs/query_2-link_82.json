        "text": "The term âmetaverseâ has become increasingly buzz-worthy in recent years, with the concept of immersive virtual experiences steadily growing traction across various sectors. Although thereâs more to the metaverse than gaming, many expertsâ97 percent of those surveyed by EYâbelieve gaming plays a significant role in its creation [1]. By 2024, metaverse revenues will likely reach $800 billion, with more than half of that coming from the gaming industry [2]. If youâre interested in this field, learn more about gaming in the metaverse, potential careers, and how to create games.Â\n\nWhat is gaming in the metaverse?\n\nYou may find a certain amount of gamification in nearly every aspect of the metaverse. It combines immersive, interconnected, interactive networks and virtual spaces. While it has many uses, gaming has gained massive popularity within the metaverse.Â\n\nThe metaverse also has gaming functionality where users can interact in a competitive environment. The industry has rapidly expanded as more users and gaming companies join the metaverse. Some gamers and experts contend that gaming in the metaverse could be the future with its 360-degree perspectives and capability to immerse you in action.\n\nWhat does metaverse gaming look like?\n\nYou'll find yourself immersed in an alternative reality when you play games in the metaverse. Everyone on the 3-D network gets an avatar that replaces the traditional profile, and you use it to interact with others. Not only can you play within metaverse games, you can also meet other people and make connections that go beyond the screen.\n\nMetaverse gaming brings a community of individuals together to compete in online games. You could play solo games against artificial intelligence or other players. Users can even connect with friends to game, socialize, or experience other adventures. Developers at Roblox, Rec Room, and Minecraft have deployed functionality for their games to use the metaverse architecture.Â\n\nTypes of metaverse gaming\n\nSome day, there could be a single metaverse that connects everything. Today, every game creates its own metaverse you access via the internet. The way it looks and operates is entirely up to its creators. Metaverse gaming falls into one of the following main types based on its architecture:Â Â\n\nTraditional centralized metaverse: This type of metaverse operates on a centralized framework instead of integrating blockchain into the framework. Organizations operate and maintain these virtual worlds by storing user data and activity. Examples include Roblox, Minecraft, and Fortnite.Â\n\nCentralized blockchain metaverse: Blockchain metaverses are virtual worlds where users can use non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and other digital assets to exchange and create individual economies within the community. Earth2 and the virtual world that Meta is striving to develop are two prime examples of this type of metaverse.Â\n\nDecentralized blockchain metaverse: These platforms aim to create a community dynamic with an equal power balance. While centralized blockchain metaverses aim to distribute wealth from the top down, these metaverses operate by âplay-to-earnâ philosophies. This gives users economic and governing power. Examples include Axie Infinity and Decentraland.Â\n\nInstead of releasing completely new versions, games that fall into the game-as-a-platform category get released and offer continual updates to keep the content from growing stale. This type of metaverse game provides you with long-term adventures designed for ongoing play.\n\nGames-as-a-platform allows creators to strategically extend the life of a game. It provides a base-level game that goes through massive updates to affect the playing dynamics. Other categories would release several versions of the game to achieve similar effects. Examples of games-as-a-platform include World of Warcraft, and Fortnite, which have developers constantly adding updates instead of releasing new editions and versions of the same games.\n\nSocial gaming\n\nSocial gaming is a new and growing industry within online gaming. It includes several gaming categories, including multiplayer games, which inherently implement an element of sociability with players playing against each other and communicating. These immersive games encourage you to interact with other players inside and outside the game. You can access them on various platforms, including computers, mobile devices, and game consoles.\n\nSocial games create virtual environments functioning as small metaverses where players can play, interact, and enjoy virtual life. Games like Second Life, Fortnite, and Sims are popular examples.\n\nPlay-to-earn\n\nPlay-to-earn games are a fast-growing game type that allows players to earn in-game items and digital assets that have real-world value. You can find these items by completing in-game tasks and missions or beating other players and progressing through the game. The assets you can earn may take the form of crypto tokens, virtual land, and in-game items stored on the blockchain.Â\n\nPortable game assets\n\nThe metaverse offers the possibility to use weapons and treasures from one game to another. Interoperable architecture and functionality allow you to customize and personalize avatars and in-game items. This functionality also enables you to transfer game items to other digital worlds and use them in different environments.Â\n\nMixed reality experience\n\nMixed reality allows you to interact simultaneously with physical and virtual items and environments. It uses advanced technology, sensors on cameras, and virtual reality interfaces to bring real-world and digital elements together for a game-changing experience. Industries other than gaming could use similar technology, including virtual travel, health care, and entertainment.Â\n\nTechnologies that power metaverse gaming\n\nVarious technologies come together to help power the games offering an immersive virtual experience. Some of the leading technologies include:\n\nArtificial intelligence\n\nAugmented and virtual reality (AR and VR)\n\nBlockchain\n\nInternet of Things (IoT)\n\n3-D reconstruction\n\nEach plays a unique role in shaping metaverse gaming and offers potential job opportunities that vary depending on current openings.Â Â Â Â\n\nArtificial intelligence\n\nAI is among the most critical technologies. Itâs used to help create interactive interfaces, monitor servers, and support smart responses. Common AI career paths and their US base salary include working as:\n\nData scientists: $103,058 [3]\n\nMachine learning engineers: $108,279 [4]\n\nAlgorithm engineers: $123,876 [5]\n\nComputer vision engineers: $111,127 [6]\n\nAR and VR technologies\n\nAR and VR technologies are integral to building immersive metaverse gaming platforms and applications. Career options and US base salaries include:\n\nAR software engineers: $115,071 [7]\n\nVR software engineers: $100,425 [8]\n\nSoftware developers: $88,540 [9]\n\nAR/VR designers: $63,098 [10]\n\nProject manager: $78,935 [11]\n\nBlockchain and cryptocurrency\n\nDecentralized metaverse applications rely on blockchain technology and cryptocurrency. These technologies allow you to make payments within the virtual world. Roles you might think of pursuing, and their US base salaries include:\n\nBlockchain developers: $90,278 [12]\n\nProject managers:$ 78,935\n\nSolution architects: $109,630 [13]\n\nInternet of Things (IoT)\n\nThe IoT helps connect the physical world with the internet using devices like sensors, which send and receive information. The IoT is the technology behind items like smart thermostats and voice-activated devices. It's also essential for collecting data from the real world to use in metaverse gaming to create accurate virtual environments. Potential career fields include development, network engineering, and security.\n\nRead more: What is the Internet of Things (IoT)?
