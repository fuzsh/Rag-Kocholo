        "text": "Kellee Santiago is a big name in the video game world. She co-founded thatgamecompany, one of the breakout indie studios of the PlayStation 3 era, and her work with Jenova Chen got the small team attention with titles such as “Flow” and “Flower” before soaring to widespread acclaim with “Journey.”\n\nHer latest job at Niantic, the San Francisco-based company that began as an internal start-up at Google, puts her at the heart of one of the Bay Area’s most promising, pioneering video game companies. The maker of “Ingress,” “Pokemon Go” and “Harry Potter: Wizards Unite,” Niantic has leveraged its augmented reality and geo-location technology to create some of the most wildly popular games for smartphones.\n\n“One of the things I love about games (like Pokemon Go),” Santiago says, “is the way they can bring people together, break down walls between us and let us just be playful.\n\nNaturally, we had questions.\n\nQ: What lessons have you learned from your experiences with thatgamecompany, Ouya and the others?\n\nA: Games are hard to make. To embark on creating a video game that was unlike anything you have seen before requires a lot of courage. It can be very hard to see where you are at the beginning – like in “Journey,” an online console game that leaves you with a renewed faith in community. It’s a tumultuous process, and you have to have a lot of faith. You start on a project in unknown territory.\n\nQ: What drew you to Niantic?\n\nA: I’ve been a huge fan of Niantic since Field Trip, (an app that told users about nearby landmarks). Fundamentally, it’s using these computers in our pockets to create engagement in the world around us. I love geocaching, finding these everyday secrets and histories around us. I love that fundamental mission.\n\nQ: What makes the Bay Area special place for the video game industry?\n\nA: Personally, I’m fascinated by the intersection of art and technology, and I find the Bay Area is a nexus for that intersection (of) the rich, cultural scene and the hub of big tech. It creates an interesting cross-pollination of thoughts and ideas. That’s great when you’re a developer.\n\nQ: Why is it important to play games? I mean what’s the purpose?\n\nA: I’m going with (Dutch cultural theorist) Johan Huizinga on this one. Play is a way we practice behaviors. We can look at puppies and see them practicing fighting and gaining skills they need when they’re grown up dogs. Play has that same place in our lives. Games are an important part of our culture. Through games, we practice and behave differently than we might normally. It gives us a safe place to rehearse behavior, learn a subject and explore the world around us.\n\nKellee Santiago’s five favorite games\n\n“WarioWare” – This game involves successfully completing mini-games, but they are so random and weird, that it takes half your time just to figure out what you are supposed to do. I just love games that have silliness as a core mechanic. Life is too serious sometimes.\n\n“Hidden in Plain Sight” – This XboxLive indie game puts each player in the role of an NPC (a character hidden among identical non-player characters), where you want to win, but don’t want to reveal yourself as a human player. It had low-resolution graphics and a light-hearted sensibility that made it my go-to party game for awhile, as it always had us in stitches.\n\n“Papers, Please” – The player takes on the role of a border-crossing immigration officer in a fictional dystopian Eastern bloc-like country. I know, it sounds like the weirdest premise for a game. But this game marries form, function and story so completely and is one of the most perfect video games ever made.\n\n“Endless Forest” – In this Tale of Tales game from 2005, players are deer in a forest. It blew my mind in terms of thinking of what a game could be and what other modalities there were to explore. Seven years later I would release “Journey,” which delves into some of the same experiments and would be called “groundbreaking.” There’s so much still to explore when it comes to ways we can play with each other online.\n\n“Pokemon Go” – I remember when it came out, seeing so many families walking around together playing it. “Pokemon Go” showed me there was still so much more to explore in how technology can enable this playfulness. I can’t wait to see what happens next."
