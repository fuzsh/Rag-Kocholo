        "text": "Pokemon Go has generated almost $1.8 billion revenue till date\n\nThe mobile app industry has experienced drastic evolution in the last 5 years with the introduction of new technology. Where we used to believe that the mobile app industry has reached a stagnation point and everything will stay the same for a while, the new apps proved us wrong. Pokemon GO is among those mobile apps that took the mobile app industry by storm.\n\nThe augmented reality-based mobile game topped the app store charts overnight and made a huge fan following. The game was a success and captured the attention of millions across the globe within a short period of time. Leveraging the Pokemon animated series legacy the game offers an engaging gaming experience.\n\nWith the aim to capture the Pokemon you need to walk through the streets or places for finding the wild Pokemon via real-time map navigation. The game was gone so much viral that people started walking unconsciously on the streets while looking at the Pokeradar in their phones. The situation went so serious that the government of many states have to issue notice for the pedestrians to avoid playing Pokemon GO on the busy roads. This kind of craze can only be dreamed of by any mobile game developer that users forget about their surroundings while playing the game.\n\nHowever, Niantic, Inc converts this dream into reality with Pokemon GO. Here we have collected all the data, statistics and numbers that Pokemon GO has touched since its existence.\n\nBut, before the detailed stats of the game here are some basic information you should know about Pokemon GO.\n\nGame Name: Pokemon GO\n\nGame Developer: Niantic, Inc\n\nGame Platform: iOS and Android\n\nAvailability: Since, July 2016\n\nGame Size: 82-100 MB\n\nPokemon GO Headquarters: San Francisco, CA\n\nPokemon Go Interface & How Does It Work?\n\nThe game starts with you as the main character of the series holding the Pokeball in hand.
