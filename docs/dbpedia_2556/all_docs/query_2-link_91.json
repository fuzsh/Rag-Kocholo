        "text": "People play the Pokémon GO game at a park at Tin Shui Wai on July 26, 2016 in Hong Kong.\n\nPhoto: Lam Yik Fei/ Getty Images\n\n“Seeing the adoption of a game like Pokémon GO and what [Niantic] has been able to do in the past couple of weeks, is really raising awareness of what augmented reality and mixed reality are,” says Jeff Jenkins, CTO of APX Labs, a software company that brings wearable software solutions to enterprises and industrial clients, “and I think that’s really a great thing.”\n\nSo how is millions of people obsessively chasing after digital dragons raising awareness of anything besides how our society is devolving into a South Park episode?\n\n“We found initially, trying to bring this tech to workers with wearable devices, a lot of our job was in education,” Jenkins says.\n\nAPX Labs flagship software, called Skylight, is basically Windows for Wearables. It allows an engineer to record the replacement of a pump from the camera embedded in his smart glasses, or overlay critical contextually usable data on the lens. This is what’s known as assisted reality, and a futuristic version was highlighted in the 2002 movie Minority Report.\n\nThere’s also, mixed reality (projects 3D modeled objects into environment, Microsoft HoloLens), augmented reality (enhances environment like Pokémon GO), and virtual reality (totally immersive, like the Oculus Rift).\n\nAssisted Reality Mixed Reality Virtual Reality\n\nKeeping them all straight has been as daunting a task as me trying to identify the band members of One Direction.\n\n“If you walked down the street before this application was released and asked people what they thought of augmented reality, the chances of hitting somebody outside of Silicon Valley that would be well informed would be pretty low,” Jenkins says.\n\nNow, because of the game, people have a frame of reference for AR, making the job of APX Labs and similar companies that much easier.\n\n“It’s usually pop culture or sci-fi that has inspired how stuff is getting used in the real world,” he says.\n\nThis means that along with awareness, the game could promote mainstream adoption of AR.\n\n“The devices we’re used to – phones, desktops, and laptops -- are really just the tip of iceberg in how humanity is destined to interact with digital content,” Jenkins says. “We yearn to interact in a more natural way.”\n\nThis evolution was going to happen with or without Pokémon Go. Augmented and Virtual Reality was already projected to hit $120 billion by 2020, according to Digi-Capital. To put that in perspective, take a look at this graph:\n\nPokémon GO has accelerated it, although to what level is unclear. It very well could be the “Skynet” moment for augmented reality. That’s when a technology transcends its intended use and takes on an unexpected life of its own, like the artificial intelligence in the Terminator franchise.\n\nBut AR is to AI as teaching a man to fish is to having an omnipotent being trawl the whole ocean and give you one. It’s a tool used for human empowerment, not one that lets our tools enslave us.\n\nStill, AR is a new, unknown technology. Like robots, GMOs, and vaccines, it elicits excitement from many, and incites fear in others.\n\nUpon release, one major worry was that the game was BigBrother plot to steal your emails because of certain access requests, as if the Illuminati has time to run the music industry and read about who you’ll draft in your fantasy football league. This was summarily debunked by Niantic, although to be fair, if Big Brother existed, that’s exactly what they would want you to believe.\n\nSo far, the game is fairly innocuous, despite the headline-grabbing gamers who walk off cliffs or abandon their kid to expandtheir Pokédex (Pokémon checklist). If 100 million people do anything, at least a few will find a way to do it stupidly. This game merely augments Darwinism.\n\nIt’s really nothing to fear. Mostly.\n\nHow the Game Works\n\nUnless you’ve been living under a geodude, you know the basic premise: the pocket monsters from the OG 1990s Nintendo Game Boy games are all around us, and this free app allows you to locate them using geospatial positioning, and to see them IRL via the camera on your smartphone.\n\nThe left view represents the game's geospatial representation, while the right is an\n\naugmented view of the environment your camera sees.\n\nPhotos: Niantic\n\nJust flick a Poké Ball (by sliding your thumb on your screen) in the Pokémon’s direction to capture and imprison the wild cartoon beasts. After that, you can feed it candy and stardust (essentially PGH, or Pokémon Growth Hormones) and force it to fight for your glory at designated Gyms (usually popular area landmarks), and sell the weak ones for more drugs.\n\nThat may sound like some horrific digital blood sport even the North Koreans would find inhumane, but it’s pretty damn addictive and promotes an active lifestyle. You have to explore different regions, such as urban areas or coastal regions, to flush out different types (rock, grass, electric) of Pokémon, and you must also walk 2 to 10 km to hatch their eggs (driving won’t do as it doesn’t count if you’re moving more than 12 mph). Only by doing both, for an extended amount of time, can you catch all 142.\n\nOne guy from Brooklyn, Nick Johnson, caught all 145 (the three others are exclusive to Europe, Asia, and Oceania) in less than a month. He caught the 142 indigenous to America while still working 50 hours a week at a startup, and the last three through a sponsorship with Expedia and Marriott Rewards.\n\nAnd contrary to the image you may have of someone who would achieve such a feat, the 28-year-old Johnson has a real life girlfriend, who often joined him on his quest.\n\nIf you walk by any park or municipal meeting place in your town, you may see others like Johnson, in crowds or alone, searching for that elusive, adorable Eevee, while mostly only catching another dumb ol’ Pidgey or Rattatta, the ubiquitous pigeons and rats of the Poké World.\n\nThe NYC Metropolitan Transit Authority courteously reminds passengers not to jump onto the subway\n\ntrain tracks to catch Pikachu, because there's a 29% chance of death.\n\nPhoto: Drew Angerer/ Getty Images\n\nThis may appear as if the whole world has gone crazy, or turned into zombies, but the stats suggest otherwise.\n\nUsers spend about 45 minutes a day playing, and while that sucks up a lot of service plan data, research has found it hasn’t drastically altered anyone’s day-to-day routine.\n\n“As Pokémon GO’s gameplay relies on users being out and about, consumers seem to have incorporated the game into their daily routines and commutes,” writes AppAnnie analyst Sameer Singh.\n\nAt the very least, it’s augmenting the boring parts of people’s lives. You could choose to use your mobile device as a black hole to suck you into horrible click bait articles, or you could convert your display into a lens for which to perceive and interact with your surroundings in a new way.\n\nSummer of Pikachu\n\nThe Pokémon GO phenomenon could be written off as a summer anomaly that found a way to leverage millennial nostalgia and a novel technology. However, this game now has more users than Tinder, a dating app which literally lets you find hot people near you to have sex with. If that doesn’t suggest staying power, I don’t know what does.\n\nIt’s nowhere near perfect representation of augmented reality, though.\n\n“I don’t know if this is a ‘Facebook’ moment,” Jenkins says, referring to the app that terraformed social media into a powerful agent of global change. “What I do think is going to happen is not last game we’re going to see.”\n\nHe expects other brands to experiment, reinvent, copy and deconstruct what Pokémon GO has started. And the myriad applications will spawn improved devices to play them on. If people really want to connect more organically with the artificial, they’ll need something that doesn’t promote poor posture and “text neck.”\n\nPhoto Illustration: DynamicStrength.com\n\n“What if I could play this without having to hold my phone up and look at it?” Jenkins asks.\n\nWearable companies would love to answer that question, and find that crucial balance between capability and the way the device looks.\n\nThe technology has a long way to go. This game illustrates those flaws and why Jenkins thinks AR isn’t quite yet ready for widespread use.\n\nHe overheard some fellow employees being embarrassed to pull out their phones at lunch in a populated restaurant district, because the game is the visual equivalent of hearing someone on their Blue Tooth, but assuming they are schizophrenic.\n\n“That social pressure makes the consumer market so unforgiving of current generation wearable devices,” he says. “Enterprise will lead the way and the consumer market will trail in [wearables such as] smart glasses just because of that social pressure alone.”\n\nSmartwatches look less like Swatch watches and something a self-respecting adult would wear with every new iteration, and one company,Ringly, has even made discrete jewelry that will beep or blink to alert the user to notifications.\n\nDAQRI's Smart Helmet keeps workers safe and allows them to essentially become\n\nan arsenal of IoT sensors.\n\nPhoto: DAQRI\n\n“The safety aspect of wearing a helmet is the reason they are doing it. They don’t wear safety glasses because they flatter the shape of their eyes. It’s because it keeps them safe.”\n\nBusiness Insider journalist Biz Carson got to try one out at the Daqri Los Angeles office – which was once the set of “Mad Men” – and says the helmet gave her super powers:\n\nImagine looking at a field of pipes and being able to identify them and what's flowing through them. Instead of keeping employees in the control room to monitor data, a worker could be able to tell if a measurement is out of line just by having the camera on the helmet read it. If needed, their boss could also tap into the cameras on the helmet to see the same view and troubleshoot together.\n\nAs technology does edge closer to Skynetting the hell out of us, or at least taking our manufacturing jobs, the question is how will we compete?\n\nThis tool answers that by providing the same omniscience the Internet of Things gives an ERP to human workers, who are vastly more mobile and flexible than any robot, yet can’t hope to compete with processing power. This gives us back the control we’re losing by outsourcing all complex tasks to algorithms.\n\nI would make a The Matrix Revolutions reference here about Neo gaining IoT super powers outside of the virtual world, but that movie was just awful and no one should remember it.\n\nBecause of the price that ranges in the thousands, the smart helmet isn’t something every worker will start wearing next year. Like with any technology, the price will inevitably fall and in ten years a mechatronics engineer could be conducting a fleet of robo-workers on the factory floor like it’s an orchestra at the Philharmonic.\n\nSure, it’s crude now for the jerk in front of you on the sidewalk to stop short because he needs that Squirtle right now, but keep in mind this isn’t just a dorkier continuation of texting and walking. It’s the link to a world where instead of capturing imaginary monsters to fight our fake battles, we’ll be controlling drones and robots from our eyeglasses or even contact lenses to do the work we can’t.\n\nWith an aging workforce and skills gap, these enhancements could keep a company’s most knowledgeable employees on the floor longer, but at no detriment to their health. So even if you hate that clusters of kids doing something you don't understand, as all people over age 30 do, at least take solace in the fact that mobile gaming isn't the only thing that took a huge step in evolution this summer.\n\n“You get a glimpse at where we could GO with Pokémon Go,” Jenkins concludes. “It’s a little peak at where the technology is headed.”"
