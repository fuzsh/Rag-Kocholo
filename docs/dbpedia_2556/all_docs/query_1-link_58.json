This Massively Multiplayer Online Game (MMOG) will take the form of a free mobile app using the city as a playing field “in real life”. Based on the augmented reality, Ingress will let players evolve in a universe divided into two camps fighting each other: the Enlightened and the Resistance. Such games are not strictly speaking new, but Google could raise it to a higher level thanks to its technology and a potentially huge user base. MIT Technology Review",
