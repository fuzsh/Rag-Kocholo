Gameplay sees users encountering the eponymous creatures in real-world settings, utilising mobile GPS. Users can catch and train the Pokémon, then battle against other users, mimicking gameplay of the videogame series.\n\nDespite carrying the name of one of Nintendo’s marquee titles, Pokémon Go was developed by San Francisco-based game developer Niantic. Niantic specialises in AR games, and was originally founded as an internal startup within Google. The Pokémon Company, responsible for brand management, production, marketing and licensing of the franchise served as a go-between between the two.\n\nThe game launched in July 2016 and became not just a smash hit game, but a global cultural phenomenon. In the summer of 2016, it seemed as if there was no getting away from Pokémon Go. There was even a Pokémon Go Frappuccino!

At its peak, Pokémon Go was drawing in over 200 million people per month, by December 2016 that number had fallen to less than 50 million.\n\nSince the initial crash, there has been smatterings of growth, as players return to Pokémon Go and Niantic adds new highly-requested features to the game.
