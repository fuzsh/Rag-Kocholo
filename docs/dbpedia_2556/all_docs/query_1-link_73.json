        "text": "Ingress, the get-you-off-your-sofa mobile phone game made by Pokémon Go developer Niantic, is getting an official anime series.\n\nNetflix is working with the Japan-based Fuji TV to broadcast the show this October, Variety reported. It's the same month the game's reworked Ingress Prime version will also arrive.\n\nIngress launched years before Pokémon Go to a limited but dedicated community of players which are still playing now more than five years on. If anything, the subsequent launch of Pokémon Go has only boosted Ingress' fame.\n\nThe upcoming anime will follow three characters - Makoto, a police officer who can touch things and see their history; Sarah, who can see aspects of time and space; and Jack, a mysterious third character. Story aspects will then bleed through into Ingress Prime.\n\nIngress' world is infused by exotic energy which leaks through via 'portals' - the real-world places you have to go to play (many of which are also PokéStops in Pokémon Go)."
