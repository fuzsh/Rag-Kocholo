        "text": "Here it is—a new device that can connect to Pokémon GO and Pokémon Sleep!\n\nLike the Pokémon GO Plus or Poké Ball Plus devices, Pokémon GO Plus + can be paired with Pokémon GO for an easy way to play the game without having to continuously check your smart device screen. With its ability to automatically throw Poké Balls for you, you can catch Pokémon even while it’s stowed in your bag. And you can do more than just automatically spin PokéStops and throw Poké Balls—you can now use Great Balls and Ultra Balls too!\n\nPlus, keep track of your sleep with the press of a button! You can use your sleep data when you play Pokémon GO or Pokémon Sleep. Pikachu’s familiar voice will give you cute prompts when it’s time to wake up or go to sleep.\n\nIf you connect your Pokémon GO Plus + device to your Pokémon Sleep app, a special Pikachu wearing a nightcap will appear in the game to help you raise Snorlax.\n\nAlso, you can get a special profile icon of Pikachu wearing a nightcap.\n\nAdditionally, you can get up to 500 diamonds based on the total amount of sleep you’ve tracked with your Pokémon GO Plus +.\n\nNote: This applies to sleep data synced after the Version 1.10.0 update.\n\nIf you pair your Pokémon GO Plus + to your Pokémon GO game, you’ll be able to take on Special Research and earn an encounter with Snorlax wearing a nightcap within that game.\n\n*Trainers may have additional opportunities to encounter Snorlax wearing a nightcap in the future. Stay tuned!"
