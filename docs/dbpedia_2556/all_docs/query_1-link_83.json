The anime merges Ingress Agents, gameplay and narrative into a sci-fi adventure thriller featuring music from various artists including UK rock band, Alt-J.\n\nIn Ingress: The Animation, exotic matter (XM) is leaking into the world through portals disguised as real-world landmarks scattered across the globe. XM influences people in different ways with some even gaining a super mental power. The show focuses on the main characters Makoto and Sarah who have been impacted by the exotic matter. Makoto can touch things and see their history, while Sarah can see certain aspects of time and space. The duo end-up on the run together away, fleeing from a third mysterious character named Jack.\n\nPlayers must choose a side between the enlightened and the resistance, two factions battling for control of these landmarks and the fate of the world.\n\nThe Ingress Prime storyline will evolve, changing based on how Ingress agents interact with one another and the outcome of Ingress real-world in-person “anomaly” events.\n\nIngress Prime is available as a free download on the App Store for iPhone and on Google Play for Android devices."
