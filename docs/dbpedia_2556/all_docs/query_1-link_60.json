        "text": "Since early last year, most of my free time has been spent playing Ingress, a game in which players battle for control of real-world locations, by actually going to those locations. If it sounds a bit like Pokémon Go, it should—both games were created by the software company Niantic (alongside Nintendo and the Pokémon Co. in the case of Pokémon Go). In fact, much of Pokémon Go’s map is based on that of Ingress. (In Ingress, instead of Pokéstops and Gyms, we have Portals. In addition to dueling for control over them, we link them up into networks, winning control over territory. This sounds more complicated than it is once you get used to it. TL;DR: My team, the Resistance, makes blue triangles to protect you from alien mind control. You’re welcome.)\n\nNow my local Ingress stomping grounds are overrun with players of Pokémon Go, which seems to be a bona fide cultural phenomenon. I’m not an expert on the Pokédex; I was just old enough when Pokémon hit that I was aware of the phenomenon but never got into it. I wouldn’t know a Pidgey from Spearow if they landed on my head. I was, however, skulking around with my phone before it was cool. Here are a few tips from having spent many hours with Go’s older, weirder sibling:\n\nBe safe\n\nSeriously, rule No. 1: Don’t walk around staring at your phone. I know Ingress players who’ve been mugged. A player in Ireland died making a night run out a slippery pier to a lighthouse. If you want to listen to the game sounds, consider getting a pair of earbuds, and use one; you’ll attract less attention from anyone who might wish you ill and you’ll still be able to hear. Keep your eyes up, and look around to maintain situational awareness. If approached by law enforcement, worry more about making a positive impression than catching the Pikachu. And don’t try to play from the driver’s seat in the middle of traffic. It’s unsafe, and will get you a hefty ticket.\n\nPlay on a budget\n\nThe download is free, but you may spend money on gas, data overages or plan upgrades, accessories (like an external battery—GPS games maintain a continuous connection that will run down even the biggest phone batteries in a few hours), and in-game items. It’s fine to sink money into a hobby if you love it, but don’t end up with hundreds dollars on your credit card at the end of the month from a series of impulse buys.\n\nThey’re opponents, not enemies\n\nTwo different players have told me about getting grief from a teammate for maintaining friendships—which pre-date Ingress by years—with people who happen to play the other faction. So far it seems like the competition among Teams Mystic, Instinct, and Valor has not evolved to support the large-scale events we have in Ingress. But it probably will soon, and teams will be tempted to vilify one another. Nothing unites an “us” like a “them” to be defeated. But remember, you have more in common with a player from another team than either of you would with folks who aren’t in the game at all. Play to win, but treat your opponents with respect. A friendly wave and a “good game!” never hurt anyone.\n\nSee the world\n\nYou may be tempted to play from a car to cover ground faster. In exurban or rural areas, that may be the only realistic choice—if it’s 10 miles along roads with no sidewalks from one site to the next. But if you’re in a reasonably dense suburb, or an urban center, give the game a go on foot or on a bike. Even if you drive between sites, take time to park, hop out, and look around. PokéStops and Gyms are tied to real locations from Niantic’s Field Trip database of public art and attractions, or Ingress player submissions. Many of these locations are worth a close look. Don’t get so focused on your screen that you blithely walk right by something amazing. Always read the plaque!\n\nPeople cheat\n\nAs soon as it becomes possible to trade gear between players, online stores will offer to sell things that can’t normally be bought in-game. Worse, if certain rare Pokémon are available only at limited locations, somebody will use a simulated phone, or developers’ tools on a real phone, to fake that location. Niantic has been fighting GPS spoofers in Ingress for years, and that battle will surely intensify with Go. As a player, there’s not much you can do aside from try to set a good example, and play with people who demonstrate integrity. And if you visit a remote location, take some selfies; somebody will ask whether you were really there.\n\nYou’re playing Calvinball\n\nIngress has been around for more than three years, and it’s still evolving from month to month. Sometimes updates will annoy you, or force you to rethink your strategy. The team at Niantic is trying to keep the whole system running smoothly for millions of players and make the game fun for everyone. Nobody’s done anything quite like this before. They’re going to throw stuff at the wall and see what sticks.\n\nWheaton’s law\n\nYou’re helping to found a community. The character of that community, and how the rest of society will see it, is being determined by how you behave, right now. So don’t be a dick! Not to newbie teammates who are struggling to learn how to play well, not to your opponents, not to bystanders who have no idea what the game is about.\n\nHave fun out there. And if you see me puzzling over Poliwags, say hi!"
