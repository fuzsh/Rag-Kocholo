        "text": "View: https://twitter.com/monsterhunter/status/1648191107124322305\n\ntweet text said:\n\nHunt monsters in the real world in Monster Hunter NOW, a new mobile #MonsterHunter game from Niantic and Capcom, launching September 2023!\n\nTry the closed beta test starting on April 25, and follow @MH_Now_EN for the latest info.\n\nApply here:\n\nmonsterhunternow.com\n\nView: https://youtu.be/mwldbQnLKlI\n\nClosed beta sign up:\n\nA Niantic-made Monster Hunter game sounds like it could be cool... at least in theory. Curious to see impressions once the beta starts.\n\nHm interesting. Yeh I guess we'll see how this is. Unlike normal Monster Hunter games, I imagine the battles here must be shorter right? I'm not sure if folks would want to have really long battles when they're out and about.\n\nHow have the non-PoGo Niantic titles been? I'm a daily player of that, and Pikmin Bloom seemed cute for the week I tried it, but I have no idea how the rest of their output has been.\n\nHow have the non-PoGo Niantic titles been? I'm a daily player of that, and Pikmin Bloom seemed cute for the week I tried it, but I have no idea how the rest of their output has been.\n\nTheir IP that will not be named game shut down in like a year didn't it?\n\nNiantic as a company can go die in a fire but even aside from that most of their products don't even make it out of beta...\n\nI guess they won't shut down something with huge IP like this right away...\n\nis what I would have said if they hadn't already shut down their Harry Potter game so who the hell even knows\n\nNiantic as a company can go die in a fire but even aside from that most of their products don't even make it out of beta...\n\nI guess they won't shut down something with huge IP like this right away...\n\nis what I would have said if they hadn't already shut down their Harry Potter game so who the hell even knows\n\nAt least their wizard game made it out of beta, Transformers didn't lol.\n\nI'm surprised Capcom isn't trying to do something with Mega Man Battle Network. The Legacy Collection just came out, and the premise would be perfect for something like this. I just don't see it working out with Monster Hunter.\n\nI'm... Cautiously curious.\n\nSign me up meow!\n\nI'm surprised Capcom isn't trying to do something with Mega Man Battle Network. The Legacy Collection just came out, and the premise would be perfect for something like this. I just don't see it working out with Monster Hunter.\n\nRight. The Net Navi stuff.\n\nPutting aside people's disdain for Niantic, how would a Monster hunter AR game work? Feels like it would have a very different approach to game play compared to the action packed main series.\n\nOh the game play is gonna suck ass compared to the real deal. You can count on that.\n\nHow have the non-PoGo Niantic titles been? I'm a daily player of that, and Pikmin Bloom seemed cute for the week I tried it, but I have no idea how the rest of their output has been.\n\nPikmin is still going which I've downloaded but never tried. Harry Potter did not catch on at all. What little I played of it seemed okay, but too complicated imo. Nothing has come close to Pokémon Go which I've been playing since day one.\n\nJust like HP, getting such a major IP like Monster Hunter sounds good in theory, but we'll just have to see how the delivery of it is and how it plays.\n\nI'm sure this will go as well as all of their other non-Pokemon games have.\n\nThey don't make good games at all, they've just been coasting on the Pokemon brand for years.\n\nInteresting to see how the MH gameplay mechanics will translate.\n\nCan't believe Pikmin Bloom is still running, thought it would have been shutdown like HP: WU.\n\nThe NBA game is the one that's completely dead. Pikmin makes more money than that lol"
