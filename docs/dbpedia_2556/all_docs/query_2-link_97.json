Niantic is responsible for the popular games Pikmin Bloom, Catch ‘em All, Adventures on Foot, and Pokémon GO, which has been downloaded hundreds of millions of times. The company has posted job opportunities in a variety of professional fields, such as marketing and event planning, and has hired for freelance and 100% remote positions in the past. As an employer, Niantic fosters a fun and productive work environment and seeks qualified candidates who want to help build successful game apps to join its team. Niantic offers competitive salaries and benefits to eligible employees, including stock options; medical, dental, and vision coverage; daily lunch; outdoor activities; and more.\n\nThe mission of Niantic is “to use emerging technology to enrich our experiences as human beings in the physical world.” The company formed a partnership with the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation in 2017 to promote local civic engagement and encourage citizens throughout the United States to explore their communities via city-organized events. Initially launched at Google in 2011, Niantic is now a well-funded, independent company backed by investors like The Pokémon Company, Alsop Louie Partners, and Nintendo. In addition to its San Francisco, California, headquarters, Niantic has offices in Sunnyvale and Los Angeles, California, and in Seattle, Washington."
