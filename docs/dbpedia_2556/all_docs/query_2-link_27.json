        "text": "At Niantic, we strive to create a friendly and fair gameplay experience for all players. As part of that commitment, we enforce a three-strike policy against cheating. This policy may provide players with a series of disciplinary actions that gradually increase in severity and provide multiple opportunities to change their behavior. If offenders reform their ways, they are welcomed back into the game. However, if offenders continue cheating, they may be removed from the game in accordance with the Niantic Terms of Service.\n\nFor the purposes of this policy, we define cheating as behaviors that violate the Terms of Service, Player Guidelines, or Live Event Code of Conduct, such as falsifying location (GPS location spoofing) and accessing game clients or backends in an unauthorized manner, including through the use of third-party software or add-ons.\n\nA strike serves as a warning. Everyone can make mistakes. That’s why we have created this policy to enable offenders to learn from their mistakes and change their ways. If you have been issued a strike, don’t ignore it. Take action to ensure that you do not commit any further transgressions. If you believe that your account was compromised or hacked, please see this article for tips on securing your account.\n\nKeep in mind that offenders are not always offered three strikes. Some misbehaviors may result in immediate account termination without prior warning.\n\nStrike 1: Warning\n\nDisciplinary actions:\n\nIf this strike is issued, you will see a warning message within the Pokémon GO app informing you that we have detected cheating on your account.\n\nIn addition to this warning, your gameplay experience may be degraded for the duration of the warning, including but not limited to:\n\nYou may not be able to encounter rare Pokémon in the wild. These Pokémon may not appear on the map or on the Nearby Pokémon tracker.\n\nYou may be excluded from receiving new EX Raid Passes.\n\nYou may not be able to participate in social actions with other Trainers such as trading Pokémon or sending Gifts.\n\nYou may not be able to view or participate in PokéStop Showcases.\n\nYou may not be able to view, create, or follow Routes.\n\nDuration:\n\nThis strike will last for approximately 7 days. After this period, your gameplay experience will fully be restored. If you do not remedy your behavior within or after the 7-day period, you will advance to the next strike.\n\nStrike 2: Suspension\n\nDisciplinary actions:\n\nIf your account is issued a second strike, you will temporarily lose access to your Pokémon GO account. When attempting to log into the game, you’ll be presented with a message stating that your account is suspended. You will not be able to bypass this message.\n\nDuration:\n\nThis strike will last for approximately 30 days. After that period, your account access will be restored.\n\nStrike 3: Termination\n\nDisciplinary actions:\n\nIf you receive the first and second strikes and continue to cheat, your account will be permanently banned.\n\nDuration:\n\nPermanent\n\nAppealing your punishment\n\nIf you believe your account has been terminated in error, you may appeal the termination. We will respond to your appeal after a complete investigation of your account. Please note that due to the high level of accuracy in our detection systems, very few terminations are ever overturned.\n\nBan appeals must be submitted via web form."
