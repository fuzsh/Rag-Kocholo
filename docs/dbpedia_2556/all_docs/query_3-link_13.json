It was founded in 2010 by John Hanke as Niantic Labs, an internal startup within Google. As part of Google's restructuring into Alphabet, it was spun out as an independent company in 2015.\n\nIn addition to developing Ingress, Niantic also develops Pokémon GO (2016), another augmented-reality, location-based, free-to-play game based off of the Pokémon universe, and Field Trip (2012), a location-based app which helps users find \"cool, hidden, and unique things\".\n\nIntervention[]\n\nWhen Niantic needs to intervene with the game, for example restoring Portals that were taken down by a terminated spoofer account, they use the special account named NIAGameMaster.[1]"
