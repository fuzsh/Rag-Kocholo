Founding History of Niantic

Niantic was founded in 2010 by John Hanke, who had previously worked as the director of Google Earth and Google Maps. The company was initially established as an internal startup within Google, with the goal of exploring the potential of location-based gaming and augmented reality (AR) technology.

Hanke had become interested in the idea of using mobile devices to create immersive gaming experiences that blended virtual and real-world elements. He believed that this technology had the potential to transform the way people interacted with their environment and with each other.

The company’s first product was a location-based game called Ingress, which was launched in 2012. In Ingress, players choose one of two factions and compete for control of real-world locations by visiting them in person and interacting with virtual portals.

The success of Ingress led Niantic to develop its second game, Pokémon Go, which was launched in 2016. Pokémon Go became a cultural phenomenon, with millions of players around the world using their smartphones to capture virtual creatures that were superimposed onto real-world environments.

Following the success of Pokémon Go, Niantic continued to develop its AR technology and launched its third game, Harry Potter: Wizards Unite, in 2019. This game allows players to cast spells and interact with magical creatures in a real-world setting.

In addition to its games, Niantic has also developed partnerships with companies such as McDonald’s, which turned its restaurants into sponsored locations in Pokémon Go. This allowed players to interact with special in-game content and helped drive foot traffic to McDonald’s locations.

Overall, Niantic’s founding history is rooted in its vision of using AR technology to create immersive gaming experiences that blend the virtual and physical worlds.
