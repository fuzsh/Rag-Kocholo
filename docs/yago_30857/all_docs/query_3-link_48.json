ambulance?\n\n(Joe) On its way, Doc.\n\nSorry to get you out so early.\n\n(Martin) I'll give you a nerve block.\n\nThis machinery will have to be dismantled.\n\n(Gus) No, Doc, you can't do that, it's my brother's boat.\n\nHe needs the winch for this morning's fishing.\n\n(Martin) Your fingers are lodged in there, you could lose your hand.\n\n(Joe) Maybe I could reverse the machinery.\n\n-No, don't touch anything.\n\n-Probably not that complicated.\n\n-I don't need a shot.\n\n-It's a local anesthetic, injected around the nerve below your wrist.\n\nIt'll numb your fingers.\n\nHold very still.\n\nI don't want to pierce your ulnar artery.\n\n-Argh!\n\n-Don't touch anything!\n\n(Joe) Sorry, sorry.\n\nMy bad.\n\nImbecile!\n\n(Joe) Doc, is this a bad time to ask you a question?\n\n-Yes.\n\n-Thought so.\n\n(Louisa) No, no, we made it clear that you had to give us one month's notice, Janice.\n\n(Janice) Sorry, I just thought it would be obvious I wouldn't be working after tomorrow.\n\n-You know, because of this.\n\n-But I'm married and I work.\n\n-Yeah, I know.\n\n-It's just a very busy period for me, Janice, we've got parents' evening coming up, and now I need to find alternative childcare for James.\n\n(Janice) Mel's opened that nursery up the hill.\n\nHeard the places are going fast.\n\nMight be good for him, get him used to socializing, being around folk, so he doesn't end up like, um... -Like who?\n\n-Hello.\n\n-Doc, just one second.\n\n-Joe, you can't be here!\n\nIt's bad luck.\n\n(Joe) That doesn't count until tomorrow.\n\n-Where are you going?\n\n-Sorry, Doc, I'm not taking any risks.\n\nI'll wait outside till Joe's gone.\n\n(Louisa) How was the emergency?\n\n(Martin) Some stupid fisherman caught his hand in a winch.\n\n(Joe) Don't worry, me and the Doc had it covered.\n\nThe old Dynamic Duo.\n\nSo, you'll be coming to the pre-wedding party -this evening, right?\n\n-Yeah, maybe.\n\nMartin, can you switch James into the buggy?\n\nI need to grab those staff appraisal forms and get off to work before I'm late.\n\n(Joe) So, Doc, what I was talking about.\n\n-Arms up.\n\n-It's Al.\n\nHe's just not cutting it as best man.\n\nI mean, he's good, but good isn't enough.\n\nI thought, you know, return the favor?\n\n(Martin) Um, no.\n\nWhat's the matter with you?\n\n(Joe) Just been working out at the gym.\n\nGetting in shape for the wedding.\n\n(James) Dug.\n\n(Louisa) Oh, it took me half the night to get these done.\n\n-How much sleep did you get?\n\n-No, I'm fine.\n\nIt's just the workload's been a bit tough recently.\n\n-Don't worry.\n\n-At least this one's settled, eh, fast learner, too.\n\nYou never mentioned he was talking already.\n\n(Louisa) What, he spoke?\n\n(Martin) Uh, yes, I think he did just say something.\n\n(Louisa) No, no, I can't believe I missed his first word.\n\n-What did he say?\n\n-I'm not sure.\n\nIt sounded like, uh, \"duck.\"\n\n(Joe) Sounded more like \"dog\" to me.\n\n(Louisa) James, tell Mummy.\n\nWhat did you say?\n\nWas it \"dog\" or was it \"duck\"?\n\nJames?\n\n(Al) Dad.\n\n(Bert) Oh, morning, boy.\n\n(Al) What are you doing so early?\n\n(Bert) Well, I could ask you the same thing.\n\n(Al) Hm.\n\nSo, are we gonna do that thing where I ask you what you're hiding in the shed or are you just gonna go ahead and show me?\n\n-That is a lot of whisky.\n\n-Yes.\n\n(Al) Yes, you told Ruth that sales had been good.\n\n(Bert) I massaged the truth.\n\nIt inspires confidence in the investors.\n\nI had a deal with a restaurant in Bridge.\n\n20 bottles.\n\nIt felt like the start of something big.\n\nIt made sense at being prepared.\n\n(Al) Well, and judging by the look of things, nobody, nobody else has placed an order.\n\n(Bert) It's the economy.\n\nRestaurateurs are too scared to take a gamble on an unknown brand, right?\n\nBut I know I can turn it around, eh?\n\nBut I just need you to do me a favor.\n\nDon't tell Ruth, right?\n\nI mean, have a little faith in me.\n\n(Al) Oh.\n\n(soft music) ♪ (Morwenna) Thanks for dropping it off here, Mike.\n\n(Mike) Thank you.\n\n-Fingers crossed, eh?\n\n-Let's hope so.\n\nBye.\n\n♪ (Morwenna) Oh.\n\n♪ (Rosie) Hello.\n\nSorry, um, short notice, but I was wondering if the Doctor had any appointments today.\n\n(Morwenna) Well, we've just had a cancellation, so if you're free now?\n\n(Rosie) Oh, yes, wonderful.\n\nThe name's Rosie Edwards.\n\nI'm not registered here yet though.\n\n(Morwenna) It won't be a problem.\n\nIf you could just fill out one of these forms.\n\nSo have you just moved to the village, then?\n\n(Rosie) Yeah, half my stuff's still in storage.\n\nI've not even had time to unpack and it's straight to work.\n\n(Morwenna) You working with Rev Moore, then?\n\n(Rosie) Uh, no, instead of him.\n\nSo I got back from my holiday yesterday and there are these messages saying he's gone off on some spiritual retreat and I've got to fill in ASAP.\n\nIt's been a rush and a push, it has.\n\n(Morwenna) So, wait, are you doing the wedding tomorrow, then?\n\n(Rosie) Yeah.\n\nIt's my first one ever.\n\n(Morwenna) Yeah, maybe don't mention that to the groom.\n\nHe's a bit on edge as it is.\n\n(Rosie) Well, I am qualified.\n\n(Morwenna) You've not met Joe Penhale.\n\nJust trust me on this.\n\n-Oh!\n\n-Careful.\n\nYour depth perception will have altered.\n\nYou'll get used to it.\n\nNext patient.\n\nGo through.\n\nWhat's all this?\n\nTidy this up.\n\nIt looks like a jumble sale.\n\n(patient) Hello, love.\n\n(Rosie) Uh, so I was in Australia for a holiday and I had a few problems.\n\nI was told I'd need to check in with a GP when I got back here.\n\n(Martin) You had a deep vein thrombosis.\n\n(Rosie) Yes, apparently from the plane ride over.\n\nI was only meant to be there for two weeks.\n\nThe whole thing was a complete disaster for a number of reasons.\n\n(Martin) Sleeve.\n\n(Rosie) Ended up closer to a month, stuck in hospital, juggling all that, and trying to work out when I'm meant to be starting my curateship here.\n\n(laughs) (Martin) Your blood pressure's high.\n\n(Rosie) Yeah, tell me something I don't know.\n\n(laughs) Actually, I didn't know that.\n\n(Martin) You've also been prescribed Warfarin.\n\nI'll need to monitor your blood while you're taking that.\n\n-Are you practicing?\n\n-Yes, of course.\n\nI'm a certified medical practitioner.\n\n(Rosie) No, it's just-- I mean the Buddha statue you have over there.\n\nYeah, I understand.\n\nI've heard it's become one of the most popular ornaments to keep in the home.\n\nI suppose that says a lot about who we are these days, religion as a statement of interior design rather than faith or belief.\n\n(Martin) Stop talking.\n\n(tense music) ♪ (Rosie) The, uh, doctor in Australia said I'd need to be on Warfarin for four months.\n\n-That can't be right.\n\n-No.\n\n(Rosie) Well, that's a relief.\n\n(Martin) More like six.\n\nYour deep vein thrombosis is caused by a blood clot that's at risk of breaking loose and travelling to your lungs, causing a fatal pulmonary embolism.\n\nIt's very serious.\n\n(Martin) What are you doing?\n\n(Rosie) It's something that reminds me to keep calm and centered no matter what.\n\nBack when I worked in the city, I had a few problems before.\n\nI had to learn some coping mechanisms.\n\n(Martin) All right, don't start doing it again.\n\n(patient) And four bedrooms?\n\nWell, if we could get you an attic.\n\n-Anything's possible.\n\n-Next patient?\n\n(patient) And--yeah, and the important question.\n\nWhat sort of price range would you be looking at?\n\n(Martin) Are you the patient?\n\n-Come through.\n\n-Uh, can I-- I'm gonna have to call you back.\n\nWhat time's a good time?\n\nUm, yeah, lovely.\n\nOkay.\n\nOh.\n\n(Mrs. Tishell) Here you go.\n\nDoctor's orders.\n\n(Rosie) Oh.\n\nHe's an odd one, isn't he?\n\nHe's got a strange idea of bedside manner.\n\n(Mrs. Tishell) The Doc is a very intelligent and conscientious man.\n\nWe're blessed to have him.\n\n£8.60, please.\n\n(Rosie) No, of course, no, I--I didn't mean... (Mrs. Tishell) Oh, you've got, um... (Rosie) What?\n\nOh, right.\n\nYeah.\n\nMatching collars.\n\n(Mrs. Tishell) Mine is for a genuine medical complaint.\n\n(Rosie) No, of course.\n\nSorry.\n\nI'm the new curate.\n\n(Mrs. Tishell) Oh, I didn't realize we were getting a woman.\n\n(Rosie) Thanks, then.\n\n(teacher) It's only his first word.\n\nIt's not a big deal, really.\n\nI mean, yes, it's the moment where you realize truly that your child is their own person.\n\n(student) Miss, there's a worried-looking man in the playground.\n\n-Where?\n\n-Out of the way.\n\nAnd be careful of the baby.\n\nThat's it.\n\nCareful.\n\n-Careful.\n\nStand clear.\n\n-Martin.\n\nIs everything okay?\n\n(Martin) Yes, it's fine.\n\nIt's Thursday.\n\nWe meet for lunch on Thursdays.\n\n(Louisa) Sorry, I totally forgot, I've just had so much on.\n\n-It doesn't matter.\n\n-Well, it does.\n\nI've been rota'd onto lunch duty today.\n\nYou'll have to go without me.\n\nWe'll do something later, though.\n\n(Martin) Yes, I can get some fish, if you like.\n\n(Louisa) Actually, it's Joe and Janice's pre-wedding party this evening and I did sort of say we'd maybe go.\n\n-Oh.\n\n-You don't want to go, do you?\n\n-I don't mind if you want to.\n\n-I don't really.\n\n-Oh.\n\n-Anyway, you hate those sorts of things.\n\n(Martin) They'll be disappointed if you don't go though, -won't they?\n\n-Right.\n\nSo, sorry, now you do want to go to a party?\n\n(Martin) I don't know.\n\nWhat do you want to do?\n\n-Knew you'd start complaining.\n\n-I'm not complaining.\n\n-Joe expects us to be there.\n\n-Right then, so we are going?\n\n-Well, yes-- -Yes, good.\n\n-Well, I'll see you later.\n\n-I'll ring the babysitter.\n\nBye.\n\n(Rosie) And then I'll say, \"I therefore proclaim that they are husband and wife,\" and I'll join your hands.\n\n(Joe) Sorry, it's just you keeping saying \"I,\" but tomorrow, it'll be a real vicar, right?\n\n(Rosie) Well, no, it'll be me.\n\n(Joe) But you're not a real vicar.\n\n(Rosie) I'm a curate.\n\nThink of me as a vicar with learner plates on.\n\n(laughter) (Joe) But I thought we were getting a proper person to do our wedding.\n\nHow many folks have you actually married?\n\n(Rosie) Why don't we head over to the vestry and talk about the two of you?\n\nBecause that's what it's all about, isn't it?\n\nSo, how long have you two been together?\n\n-I'd say about seven.\n\n-Eight.\n\n-Eight weeks.\n\n-Oh.\n\nSo it's a it's a-- it's a whirlwind romance, then?\n\n(Janice) It's a funny story.\n\nWe were out for fish and chips one night and Joe just asked me.\n\nI was waiting on my cod and I said, \"All right.\n\nWhy not?\"\n\n(Rosie) But you've discussed the future, what marriage means to both of you, whether you want children.\n\n-No, thank you.\n\n-As many as we can have.\n\nI don't mean hundreds.\n\n-Five or six.\n\n-I work with children, and it's screaming and crying and stuff coming out of both ends.\n\n(Rosie) It is healthy to have differences.\n\n(Janice) Can we have it put in the marriage vows that we don't need to have children?\n\n-Is that possible?\n\n-The important thing is that you take this seriously.\n\nLet marriage be held in honor among all.\n\n(Rosie) Sorry, just--how many weddings have you done before?\n\n(Rosie) I'd rather we talk about you.\n\nIt is vital that you've thought through this decision.\n\n(Janice) We've both been married before.\n\nOnce.\n\nTwice.\n\n(Rosie) I'd say that's even more reason that you need to be sure.\n\n(Joe) Do you have any references?\n\n(Rosie) It's my first wedding, all right?\n\nBut I am very capable.\n\nI can assure you of that with all my heart.\n\n(soft, quirky music) (Janice) Your nose is bleeding.\n\n(Rosie) Hm?\n\nOh, sorry, uh, it's, uh... ♪ Oh, dear, that's...

(Martin) And when taken in conjunction with Warfarin can cause psychosis and slurred speech, and an arrhythmic heart beat.\n\nSo, Doc, just to check, will she be able to continue the wedding?\n\n(Martin) For the last time, go home!\n\n(Bert) Ruth, I know I've made a little bit of a mess of things and you probably want to pull out of our business deal.\n\n(Ruth) A partnership requires a degree of trust and honesty, both of which seem to be in short supply.\n\n(Bert) Well, this is all I've got in my life.\n\n(Ruth) Emotional blackmail won't help.\n\n(Bert) No, I mean, I will fight to the last breath to make this business work.\n\nI mean, I know I'm not perfect, but I believe that we have something, right?\n\nI just need a little more time.\n\n(Ruth) One month.\n\n(Bert) I was thinking more like six or seven.\n\nOne month.\n\nRight.\n\nNo problem.\n\n(Martin) What?\n\nHang on.\n\nWhat?\n\n-Thank you.\n\n-Oh, you're welcome.\n\nI didn't think I could cope, but I know that's not true now.\n\nBut everything is a test, isn't it?\n\nAnd that's how He works.\n\nAnd if I can survive that policeman, I can survive anything.\n\nBlessed is the one who perseveres...\n\nRight, off you go.\n\nJames, Chapter One, Verse 12.\n\n(Louisa) Well, at least Joe managed to achieve something positive today in a roundabout way.\n\n-Do you think he'll be okay?\n\n-Why?\n\n(Louisa) Well, from the looks of things, he's just been jilted at the altar.\n\n(Janice) Hi.\n\nWe just want different things in life.\n\n(Joe) I want a family.\n\n-Kids.\n\n-I know, five or six.\n\nI feel like we rushed into this, Joe.\n\nI'm so sorry, I really am.\n\n(Joe) It's fine.\n\nI'm good.\n\n♪ Nighty night.\n\nGood boy.\n\n(Martin) Is he asleep?\n\n(Louisa) Yeah, kind of.\n\n(Martin) I think we should, um, keep that dog for a trial period, providing it's quarantined and deloused and wormed and castrated.\n\n(Louisa) Oh, that's wonderful.\n\nBut why?\n\n-Because you asked me.\n\n-But it's a dog, Martin.\n\nIt's a harbinger of pestilence and disease.\n\n(Martin) Mm.\n\nBut you've seemed frustrated lately and, uh, I think it might help.\n\n(Louisa) The problem isn't the dog, Martin.\n\nIt's my work, it's... Oh, it's changed, and it doesn't help that I keep thinking that I should be around more for James.\n\n-So we don't need the dog, then?\n\n-No, no, we're having the dog.\n\n(Martin) On a trial period with strict parameters.\n\n(Louisa) For a trial period with strict parameters.\n\n(James) Dog.\n\n♪ (Louisa) Martin, I think I know what he's saying.\n\nHe's saying \"dog.\"\n\n♪ Did you say, \"dog?\"\n\nNow say, \"Mummy.\"\n\nSay, \"Mummy.\"\n\n♪ (theme music) ♪ (soft piano music) ♪ (bright music)"
