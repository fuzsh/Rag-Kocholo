        "text": "The daytime community lost a legend when Ray MacDonnell passed away on June 10 at the age of 93. Best known for playing Joe Martin on ALL MY CHILDREN, he was one of the original cast members of the ABC soap when it premiered back in January 1970.\n\nFor nearly four decades, MacDonnell was a touchstone in Pine Valley, portraying the Martin family patriarch through good times and bad (and being a soap opera, there were always a lot of dramatic bad times!). When the soap moved production from New York City to Los Angeles in 2009, he retired, but continued to make occasional appearances on AMC over the following two years. Not only did he appear in the soapâ€™s final episode on ABC in 2011, MacDonnell also returned for some episodes of the short-lived online revival of AMC."
