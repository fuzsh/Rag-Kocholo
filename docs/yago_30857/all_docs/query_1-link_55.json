        "text": "Funeral Service for Margie Ruth (Jordan) Ryan, 92, of Muldrow, Oklahoma will be at 10:00 AM on Thursday, January 4, 2024 at Eastside Freewill Baptist Church in Muldrow, Oklahoma. Burial will follow at Redland Cemetery in Muldrow, Oklahoma under the direction of Agent Mallory Martin Funeral Service, Inc.\n\nShe was born on August 17, 1931 in Redland, Oklahoma to Ruby (Noel) Jordan and John Jordan and passed away on January 1, 2024 in Barling, Arkansas. She was married to R.V. “Tanner” Ryan on August 21, 1953 in Fort Smith, Arkansas. He preceded her in death on December 9, 2004.\n\nShe was a 1949 Gans High School graduate. She was a wife, homemaker, mother, grandmother, Christian, and enjoyed being with her family. Not only was she amazing at taking care of her family, she also helped her sister, Peggy, operate the Pie Parlor in Muldrow.\n\nOur mom, aka Nana, was a remarkable and talented woman. She often said about her mom “she didn’t have a lazy bone in her body” and that’s how our mom was, too. There was nothing she couldn’t cook, sew, or craft. She made all of our birthdays and holidays special with her wonderful cooking and loving spirit. Her food and desserts would melt in your mouth. As she slowed down, she still had her independence at home, her days filled with sitting in her recliner drinking coffee, working Sudoku, word searches, and watching the game show channel. She was so loved and because she taught us love is special and family means so much, every time we are together, we will always feel her loving touch.\n\nSurvivors are three daughters, Lynn Mosier and Danny of Las Vegas, NV, Susan Vest and Kenny of Muldrow, OK and Myra Sparkman and Terry of Muldrow, OK; two sons, Archer Ryan and Tracy of Muldrow, OK and Joe Ryan and Shelia of Van Buren, AR; 11 grandchildren, John Mosier of Fort Smith, AR, Jeff Mosier of Denver, CO, Bailey Chamblee and Brandel of Scottsdale, AZ, Jordan Folkerts and Luke of Muldrow, OK, Tanner Ryan and Kaity of Muldrow, OK, Kate Smith and Colter of Muldrow, OK, Micheala Robinson of Ludowici, GA, Chris Sparkman of Whitby, Ontario, Canada, Toby Sparkman of Morris, MN, Hunter Ryan and Emily of Van Buren, AR and Rylee Ryan of Van Buren, AR; eight great-grandchildren, Franci Mosier, Ryan Folkerts, Eli Folkerts, Charlie Jo Ryan, Sawyer Ryan, Hudson Ryan, Vincent Robinson and Kennedy Ryan; one brother, JC Jordan of Fort Smith, AR; one sister, Peggy Richards and Bert of Roland, OK; and several other relatives and friends.\n\nShe was preceded in death by her husband; her parents; two brothers, JR Jordan and JD Jordan; and one sister, Jean England.\n\nPallbearers will be her grandsons.\n\nViewing will be 6 – 8 PM Wednesday at Eastside Freewill Baptist Church in Muldrow, OK where the family will greet.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, memorials may be made to Eastside Freewill Baptist Church Vision Fund, P.O. Box 383, Muldrow, OK 74948 or to your favorite charity."
