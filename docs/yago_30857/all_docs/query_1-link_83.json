        "text": "Week 66 - Slanted and Enchanted by Pavement\n\nGuest listener - Hadley Freeman\n\nWho’s Hadley Freeman when she’s at home?\n\nHadley Freeman is a journalist and is mainly to be found in The Guardian. She’s also written a couple of books, the most recent one, Life Moves Pretty Fast, is a slightly obsessive fan letter to 80s movies. She was born in New York and now lives in London with a sportswriter from Somerset, their 7 month old twins and a 5 year old Norfolk terrier named Arthur.\n\nHadley’s Top 3 albums ever?\n\nMadonna, Like a Prayer\n\nBeastie Boys, Paul’s Boutique\n\nThe Cure, Disintegration\n\nWhat great album has she never heard before?\n\nSlanted and Enchanted by Pavement\n\nReleased in 1992\n\nBefore we get to Hadley, here’s what Martin of Ruth and Martin’s Album Club thinks of Slanted and Enchanted\n\nAll right, everyone.\n\nI’ve got so much to say here that we’re launching right into it - I don’t even have enough time for one of those imaginary conversations that I like to do.\n\n“Oh go on.”\n\n“No.”\n\nHere’s my story of Pavement in 10 parts.\n\n1) Our Hero\n\nA fella called Joseph Campbell once wrote a book called The Hero Has a Thousand Faces. In it, he argues that all heroes follow the same journey which is essentially this - an innocent youth meets an older “guide” and they embark on an arduous quest before a decisive victory is won.\n\nHe uses various ancient myths and legends to support his case - from Jesus to that Athenian bloke who killed a Minotaur in a maze - and it’s been argued that his work has inspired contemporary stories such as Star Wars, Harry Potter, and The Lion King.\n\nAnyway, here’s Pavement’s Stephen Malkmus talking about his childhood -\n\n“I was a playful kid, like good champagne. I wore little Lacoste jumpsuits and went to the beach with my grandma, who loved me. I had a good tan.”\n\nSo there you have it, the repetition of a theme - a child being mentored by an elder.\n\nBut unlike Luke Skywalker, Harry Potter or Simba, Stephen Malkmus was dressed in Lacoste and looked after his tan.\n\nWhat a great start.\n\n2) Stars of track and field\n\nWhilst Malkmus was at school in Stockton, California, he thought American sports were a complete waste of time and decided to play Soccer instead.\n\nThis fact alone automatically makes him cooler than virtually all other Americans.\n\nIt’s also led to me having a series of incredibly pleasant daydreams about Stephen Malkmus playing football. I’d imagine him as an American version of Alan Hansen - elegant and graceful, a last line of defence wearing a plaid shirt.\n\nTo satisfy my curiosity, I asked him on Twitter what position he played.\n\nUnbelievably, he replied,\n\n“The guy at the edge of the wall who ducks when the free kick comes.”\n\nI should have known.\n\nIt was on the football pitch, though, that Malkmus would meet another cool kid - Scott Kannberg.\n\n3) The ridiculously easy first EP\n\nIn 1989, 14 years after they first met on a football pitch, Malkmus and Kannberg form a band and borrow enough money to record a single. Naturally, they decide the best place to do this is at a local studio run by an alcoholic hippy called Gary Young.\n\nYoung describes their music as “weird guitar noise” and asks if he can join in on drums. Malkmus and Kannberg agree, the three of them make the whole thing up as they go along, and four hours later they’d recorded their first EP - Slay Tracks.\n\nUpon hearing the finished product Young said - “this Malkmus idiot is a complete songwriting genius.”\n\n1000 copies of the EP were produced and, before the inevitable happens, I want you to consider one thing - imagine if Gary Young couldn’t play drums.\n\n4) Big in Austria\n\nAs Slay Tracks is due to be released, Malkmus decides it might be a good idea to go travelling around the world.\n\nIn a record shop in Austria, he hears the EP playing on the stereo and is so shocked that he asks whether he can see it. After confirming that it was indeed the single he recorded with his mate and some weird hippy fella, he told the shop assistant that Pavement were his band.\n\nHe replied -\n\n“That’s a good name, somebody had to use it.”\n\nMalkmus phones Kannberg back in the States and tells him that he’s just heard the single being played in Austria. Kannberg, who doesn’t remember sending any copies to Austria, wonders what on earth is going on.\n\nThe Austrian shop assistant was correct in his assessment by the way - Pavement is a brilliant name and, according to The National Word Association of America, it’s one of the twenty most pleasant sounding words in the English language.\n\n“Serendipity” is also on that list though, and I just want to make it clear that I would set fire to any band that had the nerve to call themselves that.\n\n5) Bigger in Leeds\n\nAfter Austria, the Slay Tracks EP then fell into the hands of The Wedding Present - a sort of indie pop prequel to Last of The Summer Wine.\n\nThey liked the EP so much that they covered one of the songs, Box Elder, and this led to generous airplay on John Peel’s radio show. Before long, people wanted to know more about Pavement.\n\nWho were they? Why have they got such a brilliant name?\n\nThe Wedding Present didn’t even know, they’d never met them or even asked their permission to cover the song. It was a mystery. The only information available was on the liner notes to the Wedding Present EP -\n\n“Box Elder, written by Pavement from Stockton, California.”\n\nAgain, word reaches Kannberg of the news - this time that indie legends in the UK have covered one of their songs. He goes mad.\n\nWho do they think they are? How dare they cover our songs without asking us?\n\nHe then realises that the exposure might be good for the band and calms down.\n\nAnd how does Malkmus react?\n\nNo one knows because he’s still on his holidays.\n\n6) The best story ever\n\nMalkmus finally decides to return home.\n\nPavement release another couple of EPs, again with Gary Young on drums, and then Malkmus decides on another brilliant career move - he goes to New York to become a security guard.\n\nWhilst in New York he moves into an apartment with Bob Nastanovich and David Berman where they form a side project called Silver Jews. Then this, the best story ever, actually happened -\n\nSomehow they managed to get the home phone number for Thurston Moore and Kim Gordon from Sonic Youth. Once or twice a week, they’d get drunk, phone the number and record a jam on their answering machine!\n\nImagine that, Thurston Moore and Kim Gordon come home from a gruelling tour, listen to their messages only to find that some experimental art band have been playing songs down their phone for a laugh.\n\nAgain, I reached out to Twitter to satisfy my curiosity.\n\nThis time I asked Bob Nastanovich whether Sonic Youth ever discovered the identity of the band who left all those songs on their answering machine.\n\nUnbelievably, he replied,\n\n“I honestly don’t know. Seems like Malkmus would have told Kim. They’re good friends.”\n\nBob Nastanovich would later go on to join Pavement and become a massive fan of horse racing.\n\nWanna hear a great fact about him?\n\nHe’s the only known American to have visited all 60 race courses in the UK. Weird that isn’t it? If someone had told you that only one American had achieved such a feat, I’m guessing the last person you’d think of was a fella who used to be in Pavement.\n\nI have two more things to say on this section.\n\nFirstly, the former members of Pavement give great customer service on Twitter. I’ve asked two of them questions now and they’ve both got back to me within an hour. East Midlands Trains could really learn a lot from this.\n\nSecondly, I’ve already written a letter to the BBC to try and get funding for my new sitcom - Stephen Malkmus, Security Guard.\n\n7) Slanted and Enchanted\n\nDuring the Christmas of 1990, Malkmus stopped bothering Sonic Youth via their answering machine and returned home to Stockton, California.\n\nIt’s here that Pavement record their first album - Slanted and Enchanted.\n\nThe process, if you can call it that, was just as shambolic as the first EP. Malkmus and Kannberg would turn up at Gary Young’s home studio at around noon and eat chicken and vegetables that had been cooked in the fireplace. They would then work on barely rehearsed songs, often making lyrics up on the spot, and jam until about 10pm.\n\nWhen they felt they had something they could commit to tape, Young would go into the laundry room, start the tape, and then run barefoot back into the studio to play drums. After the song was finished, he then ran back into the laundry room to stop the tape. As you can imagine, this became exhausting after a while so they eventually decided to settle on the earlier takes of each song.\n\n10 days later Pavement have finished their first album. Two kids who met playing football, messing about with an alcoholic who just happened to be a brilliant drummer.\n\nIt’s one of the best albums of the ‘90s.\n\n8) A real band\n\nPavement now recruit two new members – the aforementioned Bob Nastanovich and Mark Ibold.\n\nMark Ibold played bass and smiled a lot, and Bob Nastanovich was brought in as “Assistant Time Keeper” - essentially to keep the brilliant, but erratic, Young in check.\n\nIn fact, they’re the only band I know of where one of the members is an assistant to another one.\n\nYet, off they go.\n\nThe initial live shows are reminiscent of a debauched frat party and Young, in particular, is quite the character. He couldn’t understand why bands would hang out backstage before the gigs so, instead, he would greet the fans at the door as if they were coming round his house.\n\nOften he would say things to them like “May I ask you what brings you here this evening?”\n\nMost people just thought he was mad and ignored him, and virtually no one believed he was in the band until they saw him on stage.\n\nOn another occasion, he made toast for the entire audience.\n\n“I could sit there and play drums”, he said, “but where’s the fun in that? Don’t you think it’s more fun to give out Cinnamon toast? I sat there for 45 minutes at London University with a toaster and four loaves of bread and a tub of butter and some cinnamon and I made cinnamon toast for the audience.”\n\nAt a gig in Berlin, he greeted fans at the door and gave them a cabbage.\n\nLike me, you’re probably reading these snippets of Young’s behaviour and thinking he sounds brilliant. Pavement, on the other hand, had to live with it on a daily basis and the antics, and his alcoholism, soon wore thin.\n\nAs a result, Young and Pavement parted company.\n\nThe new drummer was a fella called Steve West. He probably wasn’t as good a musician as Young but, on the plus side, he didn’t greet you at the door with a vegetable.\n\n9) The rest of their career in 190 words\n\nThey release five more albums and become one of the best bands of the '90s - providing much needed relief from Britpop and the drummer from M People who was absolutely everywhere.\n\nIn Range Life, Malkmus improvised some lyrics that took the piss out of The Smashing Pumpkins and The Stone Temple Pilots.\n\nIn Unseen Power of the Picket Fence, he wrote an entire song dedicated to how brilliant early R.E.M were.\n\nThere’s this lyric by The Hold Steady -\n\n“It’s a funny bit of chemistry, how a cool car makes a guy seem that much cooler.”\n\nI can’t drive and I hate cars so, to me, that lyric is about Pavement.\n\nLet me explain.\n\nTake the most uncool person you can think of - for example Chris Grayling, the current Leader of The House of Commons. Now imagine that you’ve just read an interview with him where he says his favourite band are Pavement.\n\nSee, suddenly Chris Grayling is much cooler.\n\nThat’s Pavement in a nutshell - they were brilliant and, whether by accident or design, they were the coolest band around.\n\nBut even more importantly, they weren’t Weezer.\n\n10) Everything’s ending here\n\nStephen Malkmus once said Pavement didn’t have any real plans because they weren’t a real band.\n\nYet, that’s exactly what they became. And in 1999, he decided he didn’t want that anymore.\n\nTheir final show was at Brixton Academy and Malkmus played the whole gig with a pair of handcuffs attached to his microphone. During the gig, he told the audience that they symbolised what it’s like being in a band for all these years.\n\nThey end the show, beautifully, with Here from Slanted and Enchanted and then their record label put out the following statement -\n\nPavement are retiring for the foreseeable future in order to:\n\n1) Start Families!\n\n2) Sail around the world!\n\n3) Get into the computer industry!\n\n4) Dance!\n\n5) Get some attention!\n\nThe bit they left out, and it’s crucial, is that a decisive victory had been won.\n\nDear Mr Fitzgerald,\n\nWe’d like to thank you for sending us the script for “Stephen Malkmus, Security Guard.”\n\nWhilst we thought the idea had its merits, and at least 4 good jokes, we have decided to pass on the opportunity and focus all our efforts on a new sitcom called “Brit Pops”.\n\nWhilst I’m here, I’d also like to thank you for your script for “ATP vs The Walking Dead”.\n\nYour idea for a zombie apocalypse at a music festival in Pontins amused me mildly and, like you, I also think Pavement would survive the longest on account of looking like Zombies in the first place. Unlike you, though, I wasn’t very happy that you killed off Yo La Tengo in the Little Tykes Play Area in episode 3.\n\nFor this reason, we have decided to pass on this too.\n\nAll the best.\n\nBobby Hundreds\n\nHead of TV.\n\nThe Critics on Slanted and Enchanted\n\nPitchfork awarded the album their maximum grade of 10.0/10.0 and ranked it as the fifth greatest album of the ‘90s.\n\nRolling Stone magazine called Slanted and Enchanted \"the quintessential indie rock album.“\n\nSo, over to you Hadley. Why haven’t you listened to it? WHAT’S WRONG WITH YOU?????\n\nThere is a two word answer to why I have never listened to this album by Pavement or, indeed, any album by Pavement: Jamie Macintosh.\n\nJamie Macintosh was the cool boy at my school, or, at least, he seemed like the cool boy to me: he was a bit of a skater and he smoked weed. To a sheltered teenager from Manhattan’s Upper East Side that is pretty much the bleeding cutting edge. In fact, he was a lot like Travis in Clueless, who I still maintain is the real heartthrob in that film (sorry Paul Rudd.) He was also – and this is possibly not entirely relevant to today’s discussion, but what the hell – cute as a button, with sad eyes and curly hair and a long lanky body. Obviously, I knew he had no idea who I was, but I knew everything about him, such as that he was a big Pavement fan, and I didn’t need to be Sherlock Holmes to work that out because he wore a Pavement t-shirt to school pretty much every other day.\n\nNow, some girls might spot a boy they fancy, figure out what band that boy likes and then obsessively listen to that band so as to have something to discuss with him. I, however, am a girl who didn’t even kiss a boy until she was almost 20 so obviously my flirting technique as a teenager was somewhat lacking. No, my conclusion upon learning Jamie’s musical taste was that I should never listen to Pavement because it was obviously cool music and therefore I’d hate it.\n\nI was not a cool teenager.\n\nWhen people say that now they mean they were a cool geek, in a sort of Michael Cera or Jesse Eisenberg way. Let me reiterate this point: I was not a cool teenager. I was not a cool geek teenager. I was just a big dork. Or at least, that’s how I saw myself so I had this idea that anything cool people liked would be utterly alien to me, whether that was smoking, music festivals or Pavement.\n\nWhen I was in my 20s and mildly less self-loathing than I was in my teens, I tried out two of those things and it turned out that I was right about smoking (disgusting) and wrong about music festivals (fun, sometimes.) But I never bothered to investigate Pavement, mainly because it continued to be the band all boys I fancied liked, and, even in my 20s, I found that weirdly offputting.\n\nMaybe I found these boys so weirdly incomprehensible anyway that I avoided any further evidence of their difference from me. I remember one boy telling me when he was 25 that he once housesat for Stephen Malkmus. I knew enough at this point to pretend to be impressed, but I also suspected that this guy was lying. That tableau – of him lying about Stephen Malkmus to impress me and me pretending to be impressed to impress him – pretty much captures all my memories of dating in my 20s.\n\nThere was another issue: I was not really into a lot of 90s music. 90s music to me seemed to be divided into four categories: R’nB, dance, grunge and Brit pop. Of those four, only r’n’b and some dance music were acceptable – everything else was depressing and pretty much unlistenable, and I strongly suspected Pavement would fall into the “tedious miserable grunge” category.\n\nSo there you have it, that’s why I never listened to Pavement: because I was a total dork who was too busy listening to Boyz 2 Men\n\nYou’ve now listened to it, at least 3 times, what do you think?\n\nThe first time I listened to it I was basically Baaaaaddad from The Adam and Joe Show in the episode when he reviewed The Prodigy: what IS this? It’s just NOISE! I hate this! O cruel world!\n\nThe second time I didn’t hate it: I was mainly amused at how it seemed like a sonic encapsulation of the 90s, with Malkmus sounding slightly bored but then also CARING VERY INTENTLY; the guitar feedback; the song titles that make absolutely no sense. All that was lacking was someone encouraging me to wear a Kookai floral dress over a pair of French Connection black trousers (classic look.) For a moment I wondered if I’d once made out with a boy to In the Mouth a Desert, but then I realized it just sounded like the kind of song I thought I’d make out to in the 90s (in fact, the first time I made out with some guy to music it was to The Verve, and I bloody hated The Verve.)\n\nThe third time I actually listened to it and thought it was… fine. I thought it was fine. I couldn’t do with to the ones where Malkmus is screaming into the mic (No Life Singed Her, Conduit for Sale!), and the strummy ones (Zurich is Stained, Trigger Cut / Wounded Kite at :17) bored me, but others – like Summer Babe and In the Mouth a Desert – were rather lovely. I also liked how obvious it was that Damon Albarn had been listening to Here on loop before he wrote Tender, and I see why: it’s a good song to listen to if the love of your life has just left you.\n\nSo of course I can see the appeal in the album – I’m a dork but I’m not deaf - but it just isn’t for me. If an album isn’t going to make me want to dance (Madonna) or rap in front of my mirror (Beastie Boys), then it has to have moments of transcendent beauty (The Cure), and Slanted and Enchanted just didn’t have that for me. And I guess I knew all along that’s how it would be for me and Pavement.\n\nSo here’s a funny story about Jamie Macintosh, because I’m sure you’re all dying to hear how that turned out. So I left the school I went to with Jamie after my GCSE’s to go to boarding school for my A-levels, and it was about two weeks after I started my new school that something incredible happened: Jamie called me. Three times! In one month! Can you imagine how shocked I was? Can you fathom what it would take to make a 16 year old boy call up a boarding school just to speak to some random girl he’d hardly ever spoken to before? Can you grasp just how badly I misread the whole situation the year before?\n\nAnd then something even weirder happened: I did not encourage his phone calls. What I mean is, I never asked him to call again, let alone visit, and I never called him, and eventually he stopped bothering – and who can blame him? At the time, I put my handling of the situation down to me being a giant dork with no social skills. But in retrospect, I think the truth was that I liked to look at him, but I knew we actually had nothing in common, so I left it at that. Just like Pavement, really: I can see the appeal, but not for me. And you know what? I think I’m fine with that.\n\nWould you listen to it again?\n\nProbably not deliberately, no. But I wouldn’t leave the room if it came on. How’s that for high praise?\n\nA mark out of 10?\n\n7\n\nRAM Rating – 9.5\n\nGuest Rating – 7\n\nOverall – 8.25\n\nSo that was Week 66 and that was Hadley Freeman. Turns out that she’d never listened to Slanted and Enchanted before because some handsome fella called Jamie wore a t-shirt and put her off. So we made her listen to it and she liked it but not enough to dance, rap in front of a mirror, or hand out vegetables to people turning up at her house.\n\nNext week, Eddie Argos from Art Brut listens to something from 1983 for the first time.\n\nIn the meantime, here’s that final performance of Here at Brixton Academy.\n\nUntil then, have a great week.\n\nRuth and Martin\n\nxx"
