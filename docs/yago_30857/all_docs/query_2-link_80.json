        "text": "NEW YORK (AP) â€” When ABC's \"All My Children\" makes its move from Manhattan to Los Angeles, Susan Lucci will go along for the ride. The leading lady of the durable daytime drama says she has decided to keep playing oft-wed diva Erica Kane, just as she has since \"All My Children\" premiered in 1970.\n\nABC said Wednesday that most of the New York-based cast will reconvene at the new L.A. shooting site, where production begins in early January.\n\nThe main exception is Ray MacDonnell, is a charter cast member, like Lucci. He is retiring from his role as Dr. Joe Martin.\n\n\"All My Children\" will still be set in the fictional town of Pine Valley. ABC says production is moving west to save money and enhance the show's production values."
