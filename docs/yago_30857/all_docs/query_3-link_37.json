Many artists and artisans poured into the city for a share of its wealth, among them the German composer George Frideric Handel. The new British Galleries of Decorative Art at The Met, which were our inspiration, tell this history through the lens of colonialism and its artistic impact by means of a rich display of foreign-made and naturalized objects. In Handel: Made in America, we add sound to the story and reveal more fully and movingly the place of slavery in artistic creation.\n\nTerrance McKnight (WQXR), connecting 18th-century England and modern-day America, traces Handel’s life, weaving it through his own story as a rising Black classical pianist in America, while reflecting on the history of global capitalism that both enslaved his ancestors and enabled Handel’s music. As Handel’s music intersects again and again with McKnight’s life, not only through art, but through the history and continued impact of slavery, each point of intersection asks us to consider what is the real price of art and to whom does this music belong?\n\nShifting from African-American spirituals to Baroque oratorio, intimate solo performance to full chorus, Handel: Made in America celebrates and deconstructs some of Handel’s most moving works, situating them in and against Black American traditions and wrestling with the problem of a music that is at the same time universal and exclusionary, divinely transcendent and implicated in some of the darkest crimes of humanity. Against these forces, we hope the listener is drawn into a poignant personal reflection on humanity, music, and the voice of the soul.\n\n—Terrance McKnight, Pat Eakin Young, and Ellen T.
