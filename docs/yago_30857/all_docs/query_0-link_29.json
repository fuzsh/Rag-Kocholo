        "text": "Nancy and Bob,of course.\n\nGrandpa Hughes died when Santos Ortega passed away in the mid 70's.\n\nPenny lives in Europe and was last seen on air around 2000(I think).\n\nChris died when Don McLaughlin died in 86.\n\nDon married Mary and lives in Wyoming.Last seen in 86.\n\nIt is assumed that Judge Lowell died.The character was last seen in 79.\n\nEllen was dropped in 85,but never officially written out.\n\nJim died in 57/58. Edith left town in 60 and Claire was killed off in 71.\n\nAlright, because I'm home with a cold tonight and have nothing better to do, I'm going to attempt to list all the actors who at one time or another played one of the original characters (without cheating on IMDB). Let me know I did, AMC afficidendos:\n\nJoe Martin...Ray MacDonnell\n\nKate Martin...Kate Harrington, Kay Campbell\n\nJeff Martin...Chris Wines, Charles Frank, James O'Sullivan, Jeffrey Byron, Jeff(?) Tripp, John James\n\nTara Martin...Karen Lynn Gorney, Stephanie Braxton, Nancy Frangione, Mary Lynn Blanks\n\nBobby Martin (who was left off the list)...Mike Bersell\n\nCharles Tyler...Hugh Franklin\n\nPhoebe Tyler...Ruth Warrick\n\nLinc Tyler...Nicholas Pryor, Peter White (I know I'm missing 1 or 2 actors here, including the actor who originated the role)\n\nAnn Tyler...Joanna Miles, Judith Barcroft, Gwynn Gillis\n\nChuck Tyler...Jack Stauffer, Richard Van Vleet\n\nAmy Tyler...Rosemary Prinz\n\nMona Kane...Frances Heflin\n\nErica Kane...Susan Lucci\n\nTed Brent...Mark Davis\n\nRuth Brent...Mary Fickett, Lee Meriwether\n\nPhilip Brent...Richard Hatch, Nick Benedict\n\nNick Davis...Larry Keith\n\nQuick aside/trivia point: I think the only time the Amy Tyler (Ruth's sister) was mentioned after Rosemary Prinz left the show following her six-month commitment was in the early 90s when Tad returned from the dead. Ruth mentioned to Joe how thrilled Amy was to hear the news that Tad was still alive. Am I wrong about this?\n\nLinden Chiles also played Lincoln. I don't remember off the top of my head if there was another actor or not.\n\nChristine Thomas also played Kate Martin.\n\nHere is the actual offical original cast of AMC:\n\nMike Bersell (Bobby Martin)\n\nMark Dawson (Ted Brent)\n\nDiana de Vegh (Ann Tyler)\n\nPaul Dumont (Lincon Tyler)\n\nMary Fickett (Ruth Brent)\n\nHugh Franklin (Dr. Charles Tyler)\n\nKaren Gorney (Tara Martin)\n\nRichard Hatch (Philip Brent)\n\nHilda Haynes (Lois Sloane)\n\nFrances Heflin (Mona Kane)\n\nLawrence Keith (Nick Davis)\n\nSusan Lucci (Erica Kane)\n\nRay MacDonnell (Dr. Joseph Martin)\n\nRosemary Prinz (Amy Tyler)\n\nJack Stauffer (Chuck Tyler)\n\nChristine Thomas (Kate Martin)\n\nRuth Warrick (Phoebe Tyler)\n\nMany list Jeff since he did come on very soon, but he was not in the original cast of characters.\n\nI just looked at my post. Paul Dumont was the original Lincoln. I had forgotten that.\n\nAmy was mentioned in the 70s still--they talk about this briefly in All Her Children when Agnes talks about when youhave to \"lop off\" past storylines (ie it becomes too much baggage and confusing to a viewer to ALWAYS mention all the past love relationships of a character so you just quit mentioning them, etc) and when not to.\n\nPoor Mike Bersell--out of a job so quickly How old was Bobby6 anyway--a teenager like his sister Tara?\n\nThe Lowell family & their heirs were part of the show until the mid 80's in a direct way. Really they are still a part of it since Emily is still there and she is the Great-Great-Granddaughter of Judge Lowell.\n\nJudge Lowell was a big part of the show through the early 70's and then he just kind of faded out in about 1977. He was a big part of being there as confidant for his daughter-in-law Claire and his granddaugther Ellen.\n\nJames Karen was the original Linc Tyler. I have never seen Linden Chiles listed as playing Linc.Was he a temporary fill in?\n\nAgnes was obviously not happy with some of the original cast.\n\nI read that Diana DeVagh only lasted a few episodes as Anne. and Joanna Miles only lasted till 71.\n\nJames Karen,Nicholas Pryor and Paul Dumont were all gone by 71.\n\nThere were 3 Chucks before Richard Van Vleet took over in 75.\n\nChristopher Wines was quicly replaced as Jeff in 70.\n\nBoth Christine Thomas and Kate Harrington played Kate in 1970 before Kay Campbell was lured out of retirement by Agnes.\n\nBobby was written out.Why did Agnes just drop the character?Bobby could have been sent somewhere to school and returned a few years later to lead a new young love story.\n\nSame with Amy.When the show went to an hour and they needed to fill out the cast,she could have returned,perhaps with a child.Maybe she could have filled the role taken by Ellen Shepherd.I know that Kathleen Noone was younger than Rosemary Prinz but would you have accepted her as an Amy recast?\n\nFor Agnes to say that the past sometimes has to be ignored so as not to confuse viewers bothers me, in that it is often more confusing and annoying that past characters do not return or are not mentioned.\n\nAMC was only 5 yrs old when she made that statement.\n\nI was confusing Lincoln with a character on Secret Storm. Linden Chiles was on The Secret Storm and not AMC. Sorry about that.\n\nI took that original cast list for AMC from a book called Soaps The History Part One. They list Paul Dumont as the original Lincoln. But I just checked Schemering and he also lists as you do that James Karen was the original Lincoln - so not sure.\n\nI don't remember off hand that Lincoln was gone from the show, but Schemering shows Lincoln being off the show from 1971 to 1974.\n\nNixon seemed to follow suit with Irna here on casting AMC. Irna went through so many actors when she was casting AW and Agnes seemed to follow in her footprints here with several of the characters.\n\nThe Bobby Martin mystery has always been one of the big guffaws of daytime soaps. He went up into the attic one day to get his skis and never came back down. I remember when years later Agnes poked fun at herself when she had Opal find Bobby's skeleton in the attic at the Martin house.\n\nI have always wanted to ask Erika Slezak if she still has any regrets about not getting the role of Mary Kennicott after all these years. I remember reading years ago that she really wanted that role and almost got it."
