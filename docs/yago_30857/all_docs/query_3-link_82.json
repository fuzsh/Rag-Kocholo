        "text": "(piano music) ♪ (upbeat music) ♪ (Martin) Look at that, it's ruined it.\n\nIt's bitten right through the diaphragm.\n\n(Louisa) Oh, you've got about another 30.\n\n(Martin) That's not the point, is it?\n\nThat's the second one!\n\n(Louisa) Well, I did warn you to keep the surgery door closed.\n\n(Morwenna) It's not an it, it's a he, and you'll give him a complex.\n\n(Martin) It's been neutered, it has no useable gender.\n\n(Ken) Morning.\n\n-Sorry, am I early?\n\n-Yes.\n\n-Sorry.\n\n-Morning, Ken.\n\nMrs. Travis is looking after James for the day, and don't forget we're meeting at 12 o'clock on the dot.\n\n-Yes, I know.\n\n-Don't be late.\n\nI won't.\n\nI had a dog once.\n\nRan off after a week.\n\nCan't blame it, really.\n\nGreat story, come through.\n\n(Ken) I'm sure it's just the flu, Doc, I got the symptoms.\n\nNasty cough, headaches all the time.\n\n(Martin) Have you been drinking again?\n\n-No.\n\n-Then what's all this liquid?\n\n(Ken) Well, it's not bloody booze.\n\n(Martin) Hm, it's acidic fluid.\n\nIts presence is symptomatic of liver failure.\n\nAll right, get dressed, come sit down.\n\nYour latest test results came back from Truro.\n\nThey indicate a reversal in the improvement of your liver function.\n\nPresumably down to your alcohol consumption.\n\nPresume all you want, Doc.\n\nI don't drink anymore.\n\nThat's a fact.\n\n(Martin) What happened to your hand?\n\nDropped a glass.\n\nTried to pick up the pieces.\n\n(Martin) You're perspiring.\n\nYou going to the AA meetings regularly?\n\n(Ken) I don't risk it.\n\nIf somebody from the Crab saw me it'd be all around the village.\n\nEverybody in the pub thinks I still drink.\n\n(Martin) And when did you have your last drink?\n\nEighteen months, almost to the day.\n\n(Martin) Are you being honest with me?\n\nHonest and bloody proud, Doc.\n\n(Samantha) Sorry we're late.\n\nThis one didn't want to leave the house.\n\n(Louisa) Come on, Astrid, it's time to come in.\n\n(Astrid) No, not today.\n\n(Louisa) You've got art first thing, and you love art, don't you?\n\n-I want to stay with my mum.\n\n-Mm.\n\n(Louisa) Is she still feeling unwell?\n\n(Samantha) The tonsillitis is all cleared up.\n\nJust the other day, she was saying how bored she was being off school.\n\nHey.\n\nYou are feeling better, aren't you?\n\n-Suppose so.\n\n-Hm.\n\nOn you go, then, come on.\n\nTo be honest, I am struggling with all the time I've taken off work.\n\nI have not had a sale in weeks.\n\n(Louisa) Don't worry, if there are any problems, we'll let you know.\n\n(Samantha) Okay, all right, see you later.\n\nLet me go, I've got to go to work.\n\nI will see you at four o'clock.\n\n(Joe) Hey, it's part of life.\n\nPeople leave you.\n\nParents, friends.\n\nYour fiancée at the altar.\n\nIt's how it goes.\n\n(Louisa) Yeah, thank you, Joe.\n\nOff we go into school.\n\n(Samantha) Dr. Ellingham, just the person I wanted to see.\n\nI was gonna call you this morning.\n\n(Ruth) What does it concern?\n\n(Samantha) How do you feel about farm animals?\n\n-Ambivalent.\n\n-Exactly!\n\nYet you own a farm.\n\nAnd I have been fielding phone calls from someone who's looking for a property just like yours.\n\n(Ruth) I'm not looking to sell.\n\n(Samantha) If someone were to pay you above market value to take it all off your hands, some might see that as an attractive proposition.\n\nYou've got my number.\n\nThink about it.\n\n(mellow music) (Ruth) I didn't say yes.\n\nI said I'd consider it.\n\n(Al) Well, as partners, we really should have been informed of this.\n\n(Ruth) Well, I'm informing you now.\n\nWe've had hardly any guests at the B&B for weeks.\n\nAnd as for the whole whiskey enterprise-- I know it's been a bit of a slow start.\n\n(Ruth) A slow start which has since ground to a halt.\n\n(Al) Ruth, all of the building blocks for a very successful business are here.\n\nWe just need more time.\n\n(Ruth) I need to make a decision soon.\n\nSo, time is a luxury that neither of you have.\n\nIf things are going to turn 'round, that needs to happen now.\n\n♪ You said, \"12 o'clock on the dot.\"\n\n(Louisa) Yes, I know, I'm sorry.\n\nThere's a girl at the school, Astrid.\n\nYou saw her the other week, tonsillitis.\n\nAnyway, she was being really difficult today, and I practically had to walk her from class to class.\n\n(Martin) It's 13 minutes past.\n\n(Louisa) As long as we make a good impression, that's the main thing, there's only one place left.\n\n(Martin) Punctuality makes a good impression, too.\n\n(Louisa) And so does politeness, Martin.\n\nAs my mother used to say, if you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all.\n\n(Martin) It's a pity she didn't follow her own advice.\n\n(Louisa) See, that's the sort of thing we probably want to avoid, though you're absolutely right.\n\n(Mel) Louisa.\n\nDr. Ellingham.\n\nGlad you could make it.\n\nCome on, then, I'll give you the guided tour.\n\nNow, this is the main interactive space.\n\n(Martin) How long have you been registered as a qualified childcare provider, Mary?\n\n-Mel.\n\n-Mel what?\n\n(Louisa) Her name is Mel, Martin, you've met her before.\n\n(Mel) I looked after James Henry, just for one day.\n\nYou were very rude to me.\n\nYou had a fungal infection in your armpit.\n\n(Louisa) You know, it's wonderful what you've done with the place.\n\nSetting it up from scratch like this.\n\nIt's amazing.\n\n(Mel) I loved being a nanny, but there comes a time when you have to move on, try something new.\n\nAny questions, then?\n\n(Louisa) Well, it's all just really impressive.\n\nIsn't it, Martin?\n\n(Martin) Are you cleaning yourself properly now?\n\nHow is your personal hygiene routine?\n\n(Louisa) Now, what about arts and crafts?\n\n(Martin) I'm just asking because if you're working with children-- (Louisa) She knows how to work with children, and she knows how to look after herself, Martin.\n\nSo, arts and crafts.\n\n(Mel) They're through here, I'll show you.\n\nSo, who would you say James takes after?\n\n(Louisa) Me, he takes after me.\n\n-Martin.\n\n-Yes.\n\n(Bert) Today is your lucky day, Ken.\n\n(Ken) Why, are you paying off your bar tab?\n\n(Bert) Even better, I'm giving you exclusive rights to Large Whiskey.\n\nArtisan spirits, made right here in glorious Portwenn.\n\n(Ken) Bert, I've got a touch of the flu.\n\nI just spent a half-hour lugging boxes down into the cellar.\n\nNow is not a good time for this.\n\nBest medicine there is.\n\n-I'm sorry, Bert.\n\n-Oh, please.\n\nI've tried everywhere.\n\nThe brewers have got the market sewn up.\n\nNow, I'm a proud man, but I'll beg if I have to.\n\n(Ken) Fine!\n\nI'll take a few bottles, drop them off tomorrow.\n\n-Just go on.\n\n-You won't regret this.\n\n(Ken) Leave me in bloody peace and quiet!\n\n♪ -Did you get the sale?\n\n-Some bottles, yeah.\n\n-Well, how many exactly?\n\n-He didn't specify, did he?\n\nBut I'm sure I can upgrade him to a case or two.\n\n(Al) Well, I hope so, because Ruth is gonna sell up.\n\n(Bert) No, she's not, I mean, she's just reminding everybody who's boss.\n\n(Al) Yes, it's her.\n\nAnd she's sick and tired of us!\n\nWe'll lose everything, the whiskey, the B&B.\n\nPlus, plus, we'll be homeless!\n\n(Bert) All right, easy, boy, don't-- there's no need to panic.\n\nDo you usually leave your guests standing out in the cold?\n\n-Sorry, you are?\n\n-John Rahmanzai.\n\n-Are you Mr. Large?\n\n-Yeah.\n\n-Yeah, I have a reservation.\n\n-Have you?\n\n(John) We spoke on the phone last week, arranged it all.\n\n-Hang on a minute, Rahmanzai?\n\n-Yes.\n\n(Bert) That rings a bell, I thought I mentioned it.\n\n(Al) No, you didn't.\n\n(John) I do hope you're not full.\n\n(Al) Well, obviously we're very popular, but I will make sure you have the best room possible.\n\nSo give me a few minutes to prepare the deluxe suite.\n\n-He seems tense.\n\n-Who wouldn't be?\n\n-We were very lucky.\n\n-How so?\n\n(Louisa) Well, you accused her of being unclean.\n\n-No, I didn't, not really.\n\n-Well, practically.\n\nAnd she still accepted James despite that, so we can feel relieved.\n\nIt's sort of a shame, though.\n\nI feel like he's growing and growing, and I'm just missing out on seeing so much.\n\n(Martin) I thought you wanted him to go to nursery.\n\n-Oh, I do.\n\n-So you're happy.\n\n(Louisa) Yes, kind of, I just wish I had more control over my time.\n\nBut at least he's in good hands.\n\nSo, can you get James there by eight tomorrow morning?\n\n(Martin) Tomorrow morning, no, I've set aside two hours -before surgery for reading.\n\n-What reading?\n\n(Martin) The Lancet, I have to stay current.\n\n(Louisa) And I've got a meeting with the governors in the morning.\n\n-Oh.\n\n-Let's discuss it over dinner.\n\nI need to be getting back to school now anyway.\n\n-Louisa.\n\n-Yes?\n\nI booked us a table at that new restaurant.\n\n-The \"what's it.\"\n\n-The one on Tintagel Terrace?\n\nYeah, I'm sure it's ghastly, but Dr. Timoney said we ought to try and go out once a week, so I-- (Louisa) Oh, good, well, I look forward to it.\n\n♪ Yes.\n\n♪ (Buddy barks) ♪ Go away.\n\n(seagulls crying) (Louisa) So, what happened?\n\n(Pippa) She was disruptive in class.\n\nStarted shouting at everybody to be quiet, even me.\n\n-That's not like her.\n\n-Well, single mother, you know.\n\nMore interested in work than looking after her child.\n\nPoor girl probably just wants some attention.\n\n(Louisa) No, Samantha's very good with her, and Astrid's never been like this before.\n\nI just want to check she's okay.\n\n(knocking) Come in.\n\nIs everything to your satisfaction, sir?\n\nOh, everything's fine, thank you.\n\nIf there's anything you want me to arrange during your stay-- maybe a fishing trip or whiskey tasting?\n\n(John) No, I won't require any activities, thank you.\n\n(Al) Okay, all right.\n\n(coughing) Well, maybe a glass of water, sir?\n\n(John) No, no, thank you.\n\nActually, I would like to have a look around and maybe pop into the village.\n\nThat's no problem at all.\n\nI'll drive you myself.\n\n-Oh, thank you.\n\n-Okay.\n\n(Louisa) Astrid, you're not in trouble.\n\nI promise you.\n\nIt's just, if something's wrong... Has something happened at home?\n\nOr at school?\n\nIs it the other children?\n\nYou can tell me.\n\nIt's just between us.\n\nIt's, it's just they make such a noise, and I just want to go home.\n\n(Louisa) I see.\n\nIt's all right.\n\nWe'll get it sorted.\n\n(Mrs. Tishell) Position away from direct sunlight in a well-ventilated-- leave it alone!\n\n(Clive) I was just trying to help, love.\n\n(Mrs. Tishell) Well, don't.\n\n(Al) Hey, Mrs. Tishell, I've got a guest.\n\nNeeds some help.\n\n(Mrs. Tishell) With his cough, by any chance?\n\nI've got the very thing.\n\n(Clive) Guest?\n\n-Well done.\n\n-Oh, yeah.\n\n(Clive) As I said to Sal the other day, I can't see a B&B lasting long without folk being there.\n\nI mean, that's a waste of time and money.\n\nBetter off to shut the whole thing down.\n\n(Al) Yeah, thanks, Clive.\n\n(Clive) Why don't you try our new machine while you're waiting?\n\nYou'll be our guinea pig.\n\nNow, you put your arm in there.\n\n-All right.\n\n-And I press this button.\n\n(Mrs. Tishell) No, don't fiddle with it, Clive.\n\n(Clive) I'm just giving it a trial run, Sal.\n\n(John) No, no, no, I need codeine linctus, please.\n\n-Have you had that before?\n\n-Many times.\n\nI find it's the only medicine that seems to have any effect.\n\n(Mrs. Tishell) You do realize it can be addictive?\n\nCodeine is converted into morphine by the liver.\n\n(John) Yes, I do understand that.\n\n(Mrs. Tishell) Has this purchase been authorized by a medical professional?\n\n(John) I was in America two weeks ago for a conference, and I seemed to get it there fine.\n\n(Mrs. Tishell) Well, this isn't America, I'm afraid.\n\n(John) Mr. Large, could you help me out here, please?\n\n-Mrs. Tishell.\n\n-What, look, for all I know, he could be a wanton drug addict seeking to satisfy his next fix.\n\n(John) I am not a drug addict.\n\n(Mrs. Tishell) Which is exactly what one of them would say.\n\n(John) Oh, God, this is ridiculous!\n\n(Mrs. Tishell) Well, speak to the doc.\n\nIf he's all right with it, I'm all right with it.\n\n(Clive) I don't understand these numbers, Sal.\n\n(Mrs. Tishell) Mm?\n\nOh.\n\n(Al) What?\n\n(Mrs. Tishell) It's nothing, Al.\n\nI just need you to take your arm out.\n\nAnd then go very slowly to Dr. Ellingham's surgery.\n\n-What?\n\n-I don't want you to panic, Al, but there is a strong probability that you are going to have a heart attack.\n\n(bell ringing) Or a stroke.\n\n(Al) Stroke?\n\nOh.\n\n(John) Clearly that woman has no idea what she's talking about.\n\nAnd you shouldn't listen to her either.\n\nI'm sure you're not having a heart attack.\n\n(Al) Well, strong possibility.\n\nThat was the phrase she used.\n\nOh, I think my arm's going numb, that's a sign, isn't it?\n\n(John) Oh, it's probably 'cause you had it stuck in that machine.\n\n-Al.\n\n-Sorry, Ruth, can't stop.\n\nI've got to get me and Mr. Rahmanzai up to the surgery, ASAP.\n\nI'm having a heart attack.\n\n(breathing heavily) Morwenna, I need to see the doc straightaway.\n\n-Why, what is it?\n\n-I'm having a heart attack.\n\n-Oh.\n\n-He's exaggerating.\n\nHowever, I do have a genuine reason-- -Doc, Doc!\n\n-I'm sorry, but I really can't take the chance.\n\n-What's going on?\n\n-Al's having a heart attack.\n\n-Yeah.\n\n-I very much doubt that.\n\n(John) No, yes, thank you, however, I do need your help.\n\n-Deep breaths.\n\n-Do you have an appointment?\n\n(John) No.\n\n(Martin) Are you a registered patient here?\n\n-No, again.\n\n-Oh, then register as a temporary patient with the receptionist.\n\nAl, come through.\n\nLet's have a look at you.\n\n(coughing) (breathing deeply) (Al) She thought I was gonna drop dead.\n\n(Martin) It is high, but it'd be wrong to base a prognosis on one or two readings.\n\nI'll fit you with a portable sphygmomanometer.\n\n-A what?\n\n-A portable sphygmomanometer.\n\nIt measures your blood pressure every 30 minutes for 24 hours.\n\nYou wear it on your belt.\n\n(Al) And if all the readings are very high, does that mean I'm gonna have a heart attack?\n\n(Martin) Well, long term, the force of blood against your artery walls could lead to health complications, including strokes and heart attacks, yes.\n\n(sighing) (Ruth) I just want Martin to update my prescription.\n\nShh!\n\n(coughing) (Ruth) Oh, hello.\n\nWe just met a few minutes ago outside the chemist's.\n\n(John) Oh, yes, yes, hello.\n\n(Ruth) Was I correct in hearing that your surname was Rahmanzai?\n\n(John) Yes.\n\n(Ruth) Are you, by any chance, related to Ismael Rahmanzai?\n\n(John) My father.\n\n(Ruth) Oh.\n\nOh, how is he?\n\n(John) I'm afraid he's dead.\n\nIt's almost two months now, that, but he had been ill for a very long time.\n\n(Ruth) Oh, I'm sorry.\n\nPoor Izzy.\n\n(John) Izzy?\n\nYou knew him pretty well, then?\n\n(Ruth) Oh, this was some time ago.\n\n(John) Well, perhaps you can tell me-- why did he want to end up here?\n\nHis ashes, I'm to scatter them on some hill.\n\nRosstree, I believe it's not very far outside of Portwenn.\n\n(Ruth) Yes, it's, uh-- it's not far at all.\n\n(John) Any idea why he wants his ashes scattered there?\n\n(Martin) What are you doing?\n\nOh, next patient!\n\n(John) Oh, finally.\n\nIf you're not too busy for dinner, perhaps we could continue this conversation.\n\n(Ruth) I am a little busy.\n\n-It's just-- -Yes, next patient.\n\n(John) It's just that I don't meet many people who knew my father back in the day, and I'd love to hear more about him.\n\nPlease?\n\n(Ruth) Of course.\n\nI'll book somewhere.\n\n-Thank you.\n\n-Yes, thank you, thank you.\n\n(John) Thank you.\n\n(coughing) All I want is some codeine linctus, but the woman in the chemist's wouldn't let me have it without your approval.\n\nIs she mad, by the way?\n\n(Martin) How long have you had this cough?\n\n(John) A month or so.\n\n(Martin) Any change in your home or work environment?\n\n-Any undue stress?\n\n-No, not really.\n\nMy father passed away around that time, but I doubt if it's connected.\n\n-It's possible.\n\n-It's also irrelevant.\n\nDoctor, the point is, if I take the linctus, the cough stops.\n\n(Martin) The linctus might simply subdue the cough whilst disguising the cause.\n\nHas your own G.P.\n\ndone any tests?\n\n(John) No, I consult a private physician who doesn't waste my time with unnecessary questions.\n\nAh, but he's perfectly happy to waste your money.\n\nI'm struggling to find the appeal of this place.\n\nI mean, you've got chemists who don't do their job and doctors who don't help their patients.\n\nExhale into that, please, short sharp breath.\n\n(breathes deeply) Well, it could be adult-onset asthma, but I need to do further tests.\n\n(John) I'm going

visited the place.\n\nOh, my mother passed away a few years before, so the whole thing's been quite a puzzle.\n\nThankfully, I ran into Dr. Ellingham, and it turns out they were old friends.\n\nWere you an acquaintance of my mother's, as well?\n\nNo, I just knew Izzy from when he worked at Broadmoor.\n\n(John) Oh, I see.\n\nYeah.\n\nWhat's the connection with this place?\n\nI mean, did he visit?\n\nNot that I'm aware of.\n\nDr. Rahmanzai?\n\nA small man with big glasses?\n\n(John) Oh, you knew him as well?\n\nNo, but I remember now.\n\n-I must have been very young.\n\n-Well, it was a long time ago, -and you could be mistaken.\n\n-No, I'm sure.\n\n'Cause he was a doctor and I wanted to be a doctor, and he gave me some very good advice.\n\n(John) Oh, so he did visit here!\n\n(Ruth) You know, now I come to think of it, yes.\n\nHe must have been passing through.\n\n(John) Passing through?\n\nWhat, here?\n\nFrom?\n\n(Ruth) Oh, well, I--I can't remember now.\n\nMaybe there was a
