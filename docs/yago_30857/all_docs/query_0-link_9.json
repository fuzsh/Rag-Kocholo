Enjoy!\n\nSusan Brumbaugh\n\nSusan.B...@Colorado.EDU\n\n============================================================================\n\nFrom: rud...@crl.com (Justin Lee)\n\nNewsgroups: rec.arts.tv.soaps\n\nSubject: AMC: History 1970-1979\n\nDate: 14 Oct 1994 12:32:59 -0700\n\nOrganization: CRL Dialup Internet Access (415) 705-6060 [login: guest]\n\nLines: 371\n\nHere's something I caught on the beloved (*snicker*) on-line service,\n\nAOL. I just thought it might be interesting for all you All My Children\n\nfans. If you're like me, you'll go \"Oh my gosh - I completely forgot\n\nabout that!\" Please forgive the length.. Two more posts to follow -\n\n1980-89 and 1990-93...\n\nALL MY CHILDREN THROUGH THE YEARS: 1970 - 1979\n\nOver the course of 25 years, ALL MY CHILDREN has had a rich and fascinating\n\nhistory. Here are some highlights from the past 1/4 century.\n\n1970\n\nPine Valley born and bred, Phil Brent and Tara Martin were in their senior\n\nyear at Pine Valley High, having fun, dating, and feeling that first blush of\n\nlove. And while their lives were filled with classes and sports and plans\n\nfor college, none of it was as important to Phil and Tara as their feelings\n\nfor each other. They were Pine Valley's first young lovers. Phil's best\n\nfriend, Chuck Tyler, accepted their love despite the crush he had on Tara.\n\nCharming Nick Davis returned to Pine Valley after 19 years away to open a\n\ndance studio. Nick renewed acquaintances with his best friend, Mona Kane,\n\nand her bratty teenage daughter, Erica. Nick knew how to flatter people, and\n\nhe figured that all he needed to do was flatter the right people, and he'd\n\nhave it made! In walked one of the right people, Phoebe Tyler, a rich,\n\nsnooty society dame who needed someone to help her organize a charity ball.\n\nNick flattered Phoebe, and since her husband Charles was spending more and\n\nmore time at the hospital, Phoebe cooed over every compliment.\n\nTroublemaker Erica discovered Pine Valley's deepest, darkest secret: Phil\n\nwas not the son of Ted and Ruth Brent as the handsome teenager was led to\n\nbelieve. Phil's real parents were Ruth's sister, Amy Tyler, and her long-ago\n\nlover, Nick Davis. Erica, never one to keep a secret, blabbed the truth to\n\nPhil. Erica's revelation set off a series of tragic events. Ted Brent set\n\nout to confront Nick and was killed in a car accident, and Phil, devastated\n\nby the shocking news of his true parentage, developed amnesia.\n\n1971\n\nLucky for busybody Phoebe, her daughter, Ann, returned home from New York to\n\nopen the Boutique, a fashion shop. In New York, Ann had met a man, Nick\n\nDavis, who intrigued her, and he lived in Pine Valley. Phoebe became\n\noutraged that Ann began dating him. She preferred that Ann date Paul Martin,\n\nDr. Joe Martin's younger brother. Despite Phoebe's warnings, Nick and Ann\n\nfell deeply in love.\n\nErica set her sights on kindly Dr. Jeff Martin, the handsome intern son of\n\nJoe. Erica wasn't nearly as in love with Jeff as she was with getting out of\n\nher mother's house and those boring classes at PVU. And Jeff was a perfectly\n\ngood way out because he was going to be a rich doctor. Tara tried over and\n\nover to warn her brother about Erica, but Jeff was captivated by Erica's\n\nbeauty and flattery. The news of their wedding shocked the people of Pine\n\nValley!\n\nWhen Phil, plagued by amnesia, couldn't remember her, Tara turned to Chuck\n\nTyler. And when he told her that he loved her, she believed him. And she\n\nloved him, too, though not in the same way she had loved Phil. When Chuck\n\nproposed, Tara said, \"Yes.\" On their wedding day, Chuck collapsed before the\n\n\"I do's\", and was hospitalized with kidney failure. While Chuck recovered,\n\nPhil and Tara renewed their relationship, and secretly planned a future\n\ntogether. Then Phil received his draft notice.\n\nNurse Ruth Brent and Dr. Joe Martin had become a familiar couple in the\n\nhospital cafeteria and around Pine Valley. Observers might have thought they\n\nwere \"keeping company\" before they even realized it themselves. Before long,\n\nJoe and Ruth realized their mutual feelings were love.\n\n1972\n\nErica dropped out of college and took a job with Ann Tyler at the Boutique.\n\nIt involved going on buying trips to New York where she met modeling agent\n\nJason Maxwell. From the moment he met Erica, Jason wanted her, but not\n\nnecessarily as a model.\n\nOn the night before shipping out to Vietnam, Phil and Tara tried to get\n\nmarried. Trapped in a blizzard, they took shelter in an empty church and\n\nmarried themselves. They made love, but Phil left soon after for combat\n\nduty. Later, he was reported missing in action. Tara told no one that she\n\nconsidered herself married to Phil, even after she discovered she was\n\npregnant with his baby. Tara eventually told the news to Chuck, who offered\n\nthe perfect solution when he asked Tara to marry him. Later that year, Tara\n\ngave birth to a son, whom she named Phillip.\n\nNewlyweds Nick Davis and Ann Tyler were devastated by the news that Nick's\n\nsperm count was too low to father a child. Knowing how much she wanted a\n\nchild, Nick gave Ann freedom to find someone else. Nick began provoking\n\nfights with Ann, and they separated. Unwilling to give up on her marriage,\n\nAnn seduced Nick into one last night of love. Regretting the weakness of his\n\nresolve, Nick asked Ann for a divorce. He never told her why. Ann,\n\nconvinced that somehow Nick had fallen out of love with her, was heartbroken,\n\nbut she agreed to the divorce. After Ann took up with Paul Martin, she\n\ndiscovered she was pregnant with Nick's baby. On the rebound, Nick fell into\n\nan affair with young dance teacher Kitty Shea.\n\n1973\n\nNick, falsely believing that he was sterile, was shocked to discover that he\n\nhad made Kitty Shea pregnant. Ann, now married to Paul Martin, resumed a\n\nsecret relationship with Nick until she learned of Kitty's pregnancy. Kitty\n\nlost the child, then slipped into psychosis, believing that she was still\n\npregnant. Later, while driving with Nick, Ann was critically injured in a car\n\naccident. Upon recovering, Ann's marriage to Paul came to an end, and she\n\nleft Pine Valley.\n\nErica was less than enthused to learn she was carrying Jeff's baby. The last\n\nthing in the world she and Jeff needed was a baby! Picturing herself\n\npregnant and fat, Erica made a decision to abort the child -- without telling\n\nher husband. The more Erica saw of Jason Maxwell in New York City, the less\n\ninterested she was in being married to Jeff. Although she flared with\n\njealousy whenever Jeff sang the praises of his favorite nurse, soft-spoken\n\nMary Kennicott, Erica finally convinced herself that she was in love with\n\nJason and he with her. On a visit to Pine Valley, Jason was murdered, and\n\nJeff, who was jealous of him, found the body and was charged with murder.\n\nDuring his trial, the real killer's identity was revealed to be Erica's\n\nmother, Mona Kane. On the witness stand, Mona flashed back to the night of\n\nthe murder and realized she had killed Jason in a struggle for his gun. The\n\nevent had been so traumatic, she had blocked it from her memory for months!\n\nJeff was cleared of all charges in what was clearly proven to be an\n\naccidental shooting.\n\nTara was rocked by the news that Phil was alive! She wanted to run to him as\n\nsoon as she heard the news of his return. But how could she? She was\n\nChuck's wife. And as far as the world knew, he was little Phillip's father.\n\nAnd a good one. Tara truly loved Chuck. But Phil was her first love, and in\n\nher heart, she knew he was the love of her life. Chuck, delighted as he was\n\nover Phil's miraculous return from the dead, was scared. He loved Tara and\n\ntheir son. He prayed that Phil's return wouldn't destroy his happy home.\n\n1974\n\nWith the ordeal of his murder trial over, Jeff wasted no time in divorcing\n\nErica. As an even happier ending, Jeff and sweet Mary Kennicott planned a\n\nnew beginning and married. Blissfully together, the newlyweds began talking\n\nabout adopting young Tad Gardner, a precocious ten-year-old who had been\n\nabused and abandoned by his parents.\n\nPhil Brent did everything he could to win Tara back. But she remained\n\nfaithful to Chuck for the sake of their son. She couldn't tell Phil the\n\ntruth. The lie she and Chuck had told was going to be lived...period. The\n\nold friendship the three of them had once shared was gone. Lonely and\n\ndepressed, Phil was ripe for the picking -- by Erica Kane!\n\nMargo Flax, Erica's model friend from New York, set her sights on Pine Valley\n\nattorney Paul Martin. Margo did everything she could to make him fall in love\n\nwith her, right down to having a face lift without telling him! She\n\nexplained that she had left Pine Valley for a visit with her grown daughter\n\nClaudette, a lie that almost blew up in Margo's brand-new face when Claudette\n\nunexpectedly showed up in Pine Valley! But finally, Margo convinced Paul to\n\nmarry her.\n\n1975\n\nErica discovered she was pregnant with Phil's baby. Phil was overjoyed and\n\nconvinced Erica to marry him but their happiness didn't last long. Erica\n\nsuffered a miscarriage and was so distraught over the loss that she had a\n\ncomplete nervous breakdown. Phil had to commit her to a mental hospital for\n\nseveral months.\n\nTwo armed thugs broke into Jeff and Mary's home, and held her hostage. Tad,\n\na witness to the crime, escaped. Sadly, Mary was killed and her untimely\n\ndeath destroyed Jeff. Everywhere he looked, he saw her. Jeff realized he\n\ncould no longer stay in Pine Valley. Before he moved away, he asked Joe and\n\nRuth to adopt Tad.\n\nAfter giving blood to save little Phillip's life, Phil Brent learned the\n\nsecret that the boy was his son, not Chuck's. Upon confronting Tara with the\n\nfact, she tearfully told Phil the whole story behind her marriage to Chuck.\n\nTara confessed that she had never stopped loving Phil. They fell into each\n\nother's arms and kissed and made love! Phil decided to divorce Erica, and\n\nTara decided to ask Chuck for a divorce. Before she could, Chuck's kidney\n\nailment flared up again, forcing Tara to change her plans. Erica also firmly\n\nrefused to end her marriage to Phil.\n\nLincoln Tyler fell deeply in love with Kitty Shea, and nothing his mother,\n\nPhoebe, could say or do, which included falling into a dead faint in the\n\nmiddle of their wedding ceremony, could keep them from saying \"I do.\" Nick\n\nDavis was pleased that his ex-wife Kitty had found a man who could love and\n\nappreciate her as she deserved. In fact, Nick remained friendly with her and\n\nwith his other ex-wife Ann, who was now Kitty's sister-in-law. Ann and Kitty\n\nbecame friendly, and Ann gave Kitty a job as a salesgirl in the Boutique.\n\nKitty's not-so-ex husband, drug kingpin Hal Short, showed up and shocked\n\nKitty with the news that they were still married. He blackmailed Kitty into\n\nusing the Boutique as the center of his Pine Valley drug operations.\n\n1976\n\nTara flew to Costa Rica, where she got a quick divorce from Chuck. For\n\nmonths, Erica refused to divorce Phil Brent, then she finally gave in. Erica\n\nbegan thinking that she deserved better, and suddenly one of the richest,\n\nmost respected men in Pine Valley was unexpectedly available. Maybe she\n\ncould land the newly available Linc Tyler, whose union with Kitty had come to\n\na temporary end when she went to jail for her involvement in Hal Short's drug\n\noperation. Erica hired Linc as her lawyer, but her pursuit went nowhere.\n\nA teenage girl with a shattered leg was brought into the hospital. She'd\n\nbeen badly beaten and thrown from a car. Chuck, now a doctor, dedicated\n\nhimself to making her well. She was Donna Beck, a high school drop-out, and\n\nshe was a teen prostitute who'd fallen into the stable of a lowlife pimp\n\nnamed Tyrone, who came at Chuck with a knife in the hospital parking lot.\n\nDr. Frank Grant, who had a black belt in karate, came to Chuck's defense, and\n\nTyrone was hauled off to jail! Donna was finally free of him, and Chuck\n\nbecame her legal guardian. He was determined to help her find a better life.\n\nMary Kennicott's younger brother, Dan, tutored Donna Beck and became smitten\n\nwith Brooke English, Phoebe Tyler's niece, who had recently arrived in Pine\n\nValley. Glorified greasemonkey Benny Sago followed Brooke to Pine Valley,\n\nand Aunt Phoebe turned up her nose at him. She encouraged Brooke to date\n\nclean-cut Dan Kennicott. And Brooke didn't mind. Dan was a pushover. She\n\ncould lead him around by the nose, and use him to make Benny jealous!\n\nDivorced from Phil, Erica was fighting a losing battle in trying to spark a\n\nromance with Lincoln Tyler. Erica needed somebody to love her. And she\n\nneeded a job. Nick Davis offered her the position of hostess in his\n\nrestaurant. The first time they kissed was a surprise to both of them. But\n\nErica liked it, and created more opportunities to seduce Nick. Finally, she\n\nlured him into her bed! When her mother, Mona, walked in on them, she almost\n\nhad a heart attack!\n\nPhysician's assistant David Thornton confessed to his favorite nurse, Ruth\n\nMartin, that he did, in fact, have a medical degree. The experiences he'd\n\nhad in Vietnam had spooked him, and he didn't want anyone to know that he was\n\na doctor. Ruth kept David's secret. She was flattered that such an\n\nattractive and younger man had trusted her. Joe had became more distant from\n\nRuth when his daughter Tara had chosen her son, Phil, over Chuck. David\n\nThornton declared his love for Ruth and she responded to him. She pondered\n\ndivorcing Joe and marrying David, but came to her senses when Joe's appendix\n\nburst and the only doctor who could perform the emergency appendectomy was\n\nDavid Thornton, who had no choice but to become a practicing surgeon again!\n\nAs David operated, Ruth realized that she loved Joe. She broke off her\n\nrelationship with David and reconciled with Joe.\n\nRuth and Joe Martin watched their children, Phil and Tara, say their vows as\n\nthey at long last became man and wife. Little Phillip still resented \"Uncle\"\n\nPhil and had stayed away from their wedding. He wanted to stay with his\n\n\"father\" Chuck. Phil felt that Little Phillip should be told the truth, but\n\nagreed with Tara not to tell him.\n\n1977\n\nJoe diagnosed Kitty Tyler's attacks of blindness and dizziness as an\n\ninoperable brain tumor. Kitty only had a short time to live. During her\n\nfinal days, Linc and Myrtle Lum surrounded her with love. Kitty thanked Linc\n\nfor being her husband, lover, and dearest friend. She died in his arms.\n\nBefore she left town, Myrtle sold the Boutique, which Ann Tyler had given to\n\nKitty, to Ellen Shepherd.\n\nMona was frantic to break up Erica and her new boyfriend, Mark Dalton,\n\nbecause she realized that Mark was Erica's half-brother! When Erica finally\n\naccepted the truth, she was angry. Mark, the symbol of her father's\n\ninfidelity, became her enemy. And as she froze him out of her life, Mark\n\nkept asking her why. Finally, she told him that he was her father's bastard\n\nson.\n\nAfter a spat with Nick, Erica quit working for him and wheedled her way into\n\nthe hostess job at the Goalpost, the new restaurant that ex-pro football star\n\nTom Cudahy had just opened. Erica decided that she wanted to marry Nick and\n\nshe lured him back to her bed!\n\n1978\n\nRay Gardner came to town for the sole purpose of selling his son, Tad, for\n\nmoney! When the Martins refused to negotiate, Ray began watching and\n\nwaiting. And one evening, when Ruth crossed a deserted parking lot and\n\nunlocked her car, Ray sprung out at her. He robbed, assaulted and raped her\n\nby the time her husband, Joe, got there. Joe stopped him from killing her.\n\nRay escaped, but was eventually caught by another villain, pimp Billy Clyde\n\nTuggle. Estelle LaTour was surprised to see the man who prostituted and beat\n\nher could be such a hero! Ruth and Joe at long last were able to legally\n\nadopt Tad, who was excited when his name became Tad Martin!\n\nWhile working for Tom Cudahy at the Goalpost, Erica plotted to make Nick\n\nrealize how much he loved her. Hinting that she'd kill herself if he didn't\n\nmarry her, she disappeared, leaving clues to her grisly demise in a Center\n\nCity alley. Nick and Mona panicked over Erica's whereabouts while Erica\n\nenjoyed herself in New York City, where she unfortunately contracted viral\n\npneumonia! Contacting Mona, the doctors told her that Erica had a 50-50\n\nchance of survival. Mona told Nick that only he could give Erica the will to\n\nlive. He had to ask her to marry him. Against his better judgment, Nick\n\nproposed to Erica. When she recovered, Nick reconsidered his proposal to\n\nErica. As much as he loved Erica, he knew it would never work out for them.\n\nAnd finally, he told her so. She did everything she could to change his\n\nmind, including one last passionate bedroom seduction. But Nick's mind was\n\nmade up. When he walked out on her that last time, she vowed revenge! But\n\nshe soon found a new man to marry -- her Goalpost boss, Tom Cudahy, who was\n\nabout as decent a man as Erica had ever met.\n\nAfter having an operation to reverse her sterility, Donna Tyler became\n\npregnant with her husband, Chuck's, baby.\n\n1979\n\nBefore leaving Pine Valley, Tara and Phil congratulated Joe and Ruth on the\n\nunexpected good news that Ruth was pregnant! Joe and Ruth's adopted son,\n\nTad, worried that they might love the new baby more than him, but they\n\nreassured him while Joe's mother, Kate, tried to calm Ruth's fears about\n\nhaving a healthy baby at her advanced age! On Christmas morning, Joe and Ruth\n\nwelcomed the arrival of their son, Joey.\n\nPhoebe's plan to pay Eddie Dorrance to marry Kelly Cole, the singer whose\n\ncareer he managed, fell apart when Kelly found out about it on the morning of\n\nthe wedding. Kelly called off the wedding and Phoebe's heart sank as she\n\nwatched Kelly and her son Linc fall in love. But Kelly never wanted Linc to\n\nknow about her drug addiction. She tried to go off the pills, but lapsed one\n\nnight. Strung out after popping a few two many during a singing engagement,\n\nshe fell apart on stage, and publicly declared her hate for Eddie because\n\nhe'd turned her into a junkie! She ran out. When Linc finally found her\n\nhours later, he brought her back to The Chateau where they found\n\nEddie...dead!...in his office!\n\nErica's biggest secret blew up in her face when Tom came across her birth\n\ncontrol pills and, waving them in her face, blasted her once and for all!\n\n\"Lies, lies, lies! That's all our marriage has been, Erica. And now, it's\n\nover!\" All Tom wanted was a child. Eventually, Erica persuaded Tom to give\n\ntheir marriage one more try."
