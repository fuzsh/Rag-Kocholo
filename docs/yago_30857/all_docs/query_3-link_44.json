        "text": "Martin is left holding the baby when Louisa has to take Year Six pupils sailing. He has to collect James from nursery every afternoon, but with surgery hours Martin is constantly late.\n\nHe strikes a deal with Mel Hendy at the nursery to bring James home for a fee.\n\nMartin is perturbed when he hears a voicemail left for Louisa inviting her to interview for a place on a Child and Adolescent Counselling course. She hadn't told him she was applying for the course.\n\nClive Tishell has taken up race walking in a bid to get fitter for his wife Sal. Bert decides to quit the whisky business after Ruth confirms she has decided to sell the farm, leaving Al in the lurch.\n\nMorwenna urges Al to approach landlord Ken Hollister who has decided to close the pub, as it isn't a place for a recovering alcoholic. Ken isn't so sure Al is going to be any good, given his track record - unless Ruth acts as guarantor.\n\nRuth declines, feeling she is throwing good money after bad after discovering that Bert has squandered the overdraft of Â£5,000, which she now owes the bank.\n\nIn an attempt to prove Ruth wrong, Al and Morwenna organise an event to save the pub, and Al's chance of running a business. Disaster strikes at the event when Clive takes a turn for the worse.\n\nLouisa's fears about sailing are justified when Amy Vincent, the sailing instructor, faints at the helm, causing the boat to steer off course and out to sea. Martin rushes to the rescue after Louisa calls him for help. A pupil helps steer the boat back to shore where Martin is waiting and able to treat Amy, though he is annoyed when he finds out that her condition is self-inflicted."
