        "text": "The Heavens have received a highly accomplished pianist and organist. Ruth Elizabeth (nee Martin) Lehmann passed away on September 15, 2023 after a brief illness. She was born on November 7, 1930, in San Antonio to Russell Lafayette Martin and Mildred Rossman Martin. Ruth and her brother Russell were raised in Alamo Heights and attended Breckenridge High School. After graduating from high school in 1946, she earned a music scholarship to Texas A & I College in Kingsville where her enthusiasm for music became a lifelong endeavor. Ruth started playing the piano at an early age, by the age of twelve she played the piano for Highland Terrace Methodist Church for Sunday evening services. During her two and a half years in college Ruth played the piano and organ for Kingsville Methodist Church.\n\nWhile attending Texas A & I, Ruth met her husband, Van S. Poorman, and together raised their four children. They eventually moved to Fulshear, Texas and went into rice farming, a generational family endeavor. During their time in Fulshear, Ruth played the pump organ for the churches in Fulshear and Katy, enhancing her reputation for the skill by which she performed.\n\nIn 1962, Van and Ruth had the opportunity to move to Kerrville, Texas. While both managing a ranch and raising her family, Ruth continued her love of music. She started playing the organ at First United Methodist and eventually retired after thirty-five years. Outside of the churches she played in, Ruth performed on the piano for the Point Theater in Ingram, Texas, where she met lifelong friends. In her “spare” time she played for numerous weddings and funerals, as well as being chaperone on the church choir trips.\n\nRuth worked for Mooney Aircraft in Kerrville as service parts manager and retired after thirty-seven years. She still had time to raise her daughters, participate in PTA, all while continuing the duties of being an organist and pianist. In 2000, Ruth married Gussie Eugene Lehmann and travelled the world. They had the opportunity to see many amazing places and enjoy life.\n\nRuth is survived by daughters, Fay (Wayne) Abraham, Paula (Mark) Paddock; son in law, Tim Bollier; extended family, Linda (Ron) Imel, Maribess (Jerry) Miller, David (Wendy) Lehmann, Jeana (Mike) Krause, and Reagan (Renee) Lehmann; grandchildren, Chance (Lauren) Bollier, Caitlin Bollier, Timothy (Leslie) Lybarger, Mitchell (Krystal) Winters, Samuel (Heidi) Paddock, Allison Imel, Lindsey (Dale) Nisbet, Drew (Jennifer) Imel, Gene (Brittany) Lehmann, Darby (Tyler) Campbell, Corey (Brady) Lehmann, Travis (Anna) Krause, Gus (Kellie) Krause, Ryan (Denise) Krause; and 17 dearly loved great-grandchildren.
