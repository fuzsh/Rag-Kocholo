(The actor’s retirement in 2009 left Susan Lucci as the only original cast member still with the daytime serial.) Along the way, MacDonnell was honored with the Daytime Emmys’ Lifetime Achievement Award in 2004.\n\nMacDonnell reprised his role as Joe for Prospect Park’s short-lived online AMC revival, which premiered some 18 months after the series’ ABC finale.\n\nMacDonnell is survived by his wife Patricia and children Sarah, Kyle, and Daniel.\n\nBest of TVLine\n\n'Missing' Shows, Found!
