        "text": "By Geri Jefferson\n\nThe return visit to the All My Children set was an experience that I will long remember. For a while I felt like I was in the midst of a wonderful, star studded, Hollywood extravaganza.\n\nAs our photographer, Leslie Murray, and I wandered through the halls of the AMC offices on West 67th Street in Manhattan, familiar faces seemed to be coming at us with incredible speeds.\n\nFrom One Life to Live we saw George Reinholdt (Anthony Harris Lord); Jennifer Harmon (Cathy Craig) who looks great even in rollers; Jameson Parker (Brad Vernon); and Al Freeman Jr. (Ed Hall).\n\nAll My Children fans would have had a veritable ocular feast seeing all the great actors and actresses. There were (just to name a few): Ruth Warrick (Phoebe Tyler), John Danelle (Dr. Frank Grant), Darren Kelly (Dan Kennicott), Ray MacDonnell (Dr. Joe Martin), and the list goes on....\n\nProducer Bud Kloss and Associate Producer Felicia Behr were so warm and friendly that I was soon feeling right at home.\n\nChris Gampel (Anatole Karras)\n\nWhile S.O.D. photographer Leslie went onto the studio floor to take the exciting photographs pictured here, I was tucked away in C.M. Gampel's (Dr. Anatatole Karras) private dressing room having a wonderful conversation. Many of you may remember Mr. Gampel from his days on Love of Life where he was the prison warden. In past years he's appeared on Guiding Light, Search for Tomorrow, and Secret Storm. He's also been seen in Death Wish, the Adams Chronicles and Death Takes a Holiday. In fact, he's been in twenty-two Broadway plays and countless number of television and film productions. His busy schedule includes teaching young hopefuls at a school sponsored by the American Federation of Theatre and Radio Artists.\n\nMr. Gampel is very excited and pleased about his role as Dr. Cristina Karras' father. Although he is not sure as to where the character is going - he is confident it will be a challenge and a pleasure.\n\nAfter talking to Cris Gampel, I wandered into the control room and while I was talking to Felicia Behr, John Danelle (Dr. Frank Grant) happened by.\n\nJohn Danelle (Dr. Frank Grant)\n\nOn a break from the dress rehearsal, John was more than pleased to talk to me. His dressing room was - to say the least - decorated rather informally. The many women who pepper his wall are a sure sign that John finds women more than a little bit attractive!\n\nThe first question asked (\"Do you enjoy your work as Frank Grant?\") elicited a prompt response: \"I like it. It pays my bills.\" For four years, Dr. Frank Grant has paid the bills for John Danelle.\n\nOn his character John says he likes Frank, but wonders at some of the things he does. In the storyline Frank is in Pine Valley and his wife is in Chicago - they see each other when they can. Frank refuses to leave Pine Valley, and his wife refuses to sacrifice her career and return to Pine Valley. For John personally, the whole idea is rather amusing. \"To me,\" he says \"That would never have happened. The marriage would have been over. If I said that to my wife, or if she said that to me, [it is] goodbye. It's been nice knowing you. Forget it.\" John Danelle definitely does not believe in long distance marriages.\n\nIn his spare time, John runs a karate school, trains his dogs, and of course, enjoys his wife's company.\n\nFrances Heflin (Mona Kane)\n\nAs he was walking back to the studio we ran into Frances Heflin (Mona Kane). She had a beautiful sweater with her that she was crocheting for one of her children (she has three). She's been with All My Children since the beginning. After the Martin and Tyler families were introduced into the storyline, Erica Kane (Susan Lucci) and her mother Mona were brought to Pine Valley.\n\nMona agreed that the character she portrays has gone through a metamorphosis. \"I used to be just a housewife, sort of kvetching about and worrying about my children.\" Now her character is showing a strength that Frances feels was always imbedded.\n\nFrances embarked on her acting career as a child, doing a lot of plays. Then, over a period of years, she married, had her children, lived in Europe and then California.\n\nFrances Heflin seems to have the same sensitivity and forthrightness that she portrays so well in her character. We had to cut our conversation short as she had to rush back to the set.\n\nAs Frances was rushing onto the set via the control room, Judith Barcroft (Anne Tyler Martin) was rushing out of the control room! I buttonholed her in the corridor for a quick talk.\n\nJudith Barcroft (Anne Tyler Martin)\n\nJudith, mother of two (a three year old and a five year old), sympathizes a great deal with the character she portrays. Judith's character, the mother of a retarded child, has overcompensated for her child's deformity and never leaves her side. Judith agrees that Annie is acting a little crazy but feels that tactic is \"better than the kind of mother who runs off and deserts a baby like that.\"\n\nBefore coming to All My Children, Judith portrayed Leonore for four years on Another World. She's been with All My Children for six years. She's done four Broadway plays and is planning to do a showcase with Jacqueline Brookes of Another World at the Cafe La Mama in March.\n\nJudith prefers theatre, \"but television has taught me an awful lot. The media is extremely difficult. You have to make your choices right away, you have to decide, you know, right now.\" In what seemed to be a perfect punctuation for Judith's description of frantic T.V. life, was the call to rehearsal that reached out ears. As I watched her scurrying back to the set, I found myself admiring her a great deal.\n\nThe slightly unreasonable completely confused Mrs. Martin of All My Children had become the charming and effervescent, good-head-on-her-shoulders Judith Barcroft in a matter of seconds And in just as many seconds she would return to her role as Anne. She is a versatile talent who is destined, I'm sure, to do many, many more great things.\n\nRobin Strasser (Dr. Christina Karras)\n\nAs I turned my head, in the hopes of ferreting out yet another star, I was caught completely off guard, and stopped dead in my tracks! There before me stood the beautiful Robin Strasser (Dr. Christina Karras) and her very handsome, very talented husband, Lawrence Luckinbill. \"This must be my lucky day,\" I thought to myself, for just as I was recovering from the pleasant shock of seeing such a well known Mr. and Mrs. - Ruth Warrick (Phoebe Tyler) came breezing by.\n\nAfter a quick chat with Lawrence and Robin, I convinced Ruth to spend some time with me.\n\nRuth Warrick (Phoebe Tyler)\n\nRuth (who is really a blonde, although she looks like a brunette on television) and I sat in the busy ABC reception area, and the first thing I noticed (aside from her pleasing way of making one feel comfortable) was a gold covered peanut hanging around her neck!\n\nAs you may or may not know, Ruth Warrick is great friends with our new President Jimmy Carter, and his family.\n\nInitially Ruth traveled to Plains, Georgia to interview Jimmy's mother, Miss Lillian for her upcoming book - Phoebe Tyler, Phoebe Tyler (to be published in the Fall by Viking Press. A companion book, authored by Kate Wenner will also be published by Viking Press in the Fall. Kate's book is filled with pictures and information about All My Children as well as some of the other daytime serials. Be sure to check your local bookstore. Both books are sure to become a valued addition to your Soap Opera library.)\n\nRuth's visit soon turned into the likes of a family reunion. Although there is no blood relation between Ruth and the Carters, their mutual southern upbringing brought them close together. (Miss Lillian's fondness for AMC was also a help.) They went to church together, they dined together, they experienced a lovely friendship together, and Ruth will never forget the heartwarming experience. \"What I found, \" Ruth said, \"is that now I'm a close friend of the family, and nothing has ever been more exciting.\"\n\nRuth campaigned extensively for President Carter during the pre-primary election days, covering almost every inch of New York. In fact, she was still campaigning at 2 AM on the election morning! Ruth has proven herself to be quite a pioneer in the area of campaigning. Let's face it - how many soap opera stars have hit the presidential campaign trail so vigorously?\n\nSpeaking of pioneers, Ruth was the first \"good\" villain to hit the soap opera circuit. In the role created for her by Erna Phillips, Ruth portrayed Aunt Edith Hughes on As the World Turns. That was twenty-one years ago, and although Ruth certainly does not portray a \"good guy\" today, she is as loved and respected as any good guy could ever hope to be.\n\nI asked Ruth about her leisure time. Well, of course, a woman like Ruth simply doesn't have much leisure time. During those little snatches of peace and quiet that she does manage to get, she can be found buried admist piles of reading matter. There is a summer home in West Hampton that she goes to every chance she gets (which isn't very often). Ruth loves the ocean and says, \"it just renews and restores me.\"\n\nAs one might have guessed from Ruth's avid campaigning days, she is very interested in political realities. She spends a great deal of time talking to young people and always advises them against becoming disillusioned with politics. To Ruth, \"If you say you don't care about politics, you don't care about life, because your life is governed by politics. Everything that happens in your life has to be governed through political action of some kind or other.\"\n\nAs we drew to the end of our conversation, I couldn't help but marvel at the versatility of the speaker. She's warm and open, and well versed in any subject broached. Perhaps the most exciting thing about Ruth is the love she has and openly gives to all those within her sphere. She is truly one of the great ladies of daytime television."
