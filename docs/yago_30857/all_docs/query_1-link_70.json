She was very proud of her children and loved her family dearly. Anyone that crossed paths with Ruth instantly became her family. Her home was always open to all children and Ruth would make sure that she cooked for an “Army” because she never knew how many children would be there. She was a member of the United Freewill Baptist Church and was very religious saying that she was “studying for finals” which meant that she was reading the Bible.\n\nRuth is survived by her son, Charles Dotson of West Salem; her daughter Bambi Blanco of Galion; daughter-in-law, Michelle Dotson of Ontario; her grandchildren, Amber, India - who Ruth help raise, Shae and Josh; her great-grandchildren, Gavin, Madeline, Avery, Grayson, Jackson, Alice; her siblings, Junior (Betty) Martin of Danville, Clara Yates Grundy, Virginia, Billy (Lillian) Martin of Bucyrus; and her best friend and confidant, Dorothy (Joe) Vencill of Bucyrus.\n\nRuth was preceded in death by her son, Howard Ray Dotson who just passed away on February 12, 2020.\n\nMemorial services will be held at 3:30 pm on Saturday, March 21, 2020 at United Freewill Baptist Church, 288 Pershing Avenue, Galion, Ohio with Pastor David Bates officiating.\n\nMemorial contributions may be made to the United Freewill Baptist Church.\n\nThose wishing to share a memory of Ruth or to the Dotson family may do so by visiting www.masfh.com.\n\nThe Schneider-Gompf Funeral Home, 303 Portland Way North, Galion is honored to serve the family of Ruth Ann Dotson.\n\nTo send flowers to the family or plant a tree in memory of Ruth Ann (Martin) Dotson, please visit our floral store."
