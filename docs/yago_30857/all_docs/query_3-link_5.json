        "text": "Return with us now to Pine Valley. The residents of mythical Pine Valley dug in for highs and lows on Jan. 5, 1970. If you are a fan of the soap All My Children, you know the players as well as your own neighbors (maybe better). Created by daytime drama queen Agnes Nixon, five original cast members remain: Ray McDonnell (who plays Joe Martin), Mary Fickett (Ruth Martin), Frances Heflin (Mona Kane) and Ruth Warrick (Phoebe Wallingford). Plus the famous Susan Lucci, whose scheming Erica Kane character has defined the soap sex siren, although being a mommy has softened her in episodes in recent years.\n\nOn Friday, these five will gather in the Martins' living room to reminisce about the good/bad old days. For this special only, All My\n\nChildren will drop its regular story line, airing locally at 1 p.m. on WTSP-Ch. 10 and WWSB-Ch. 40.\n\nFor a show that never airs reruns (original episodes are broadcast 52 weeks a year), ABC says that most of this vintage footage from All\n\nMy Children is being repeated for the first time.\n\nIncluded (of course) is a montage of the escapades of Erica Kane. One soap magazine listed her past loves, and it read like a sports team roster. I counted 15 men who have been involved with the mighty vixen.\n\nWhat's the fascination with watching soaps? Millions become addicted to these nonsensical story lines - as well as the exploits of cast members such as Ms. Kane (formally known as Erica Kane Martin Brent Cudahy Chandler Roy Roy Montgomery.) I can't answer why others find soaps appealing except to confess that through the years, I have on occasion sought solace and stimulation from watching - mostly when I was home with the flu. So while I'm far from being a fan, I can become momentarily fascinated by the endless problems of these beautiful cast members. Their tribulations and romantic triangles aside, I like two things about soaps: the way the characters constantly communicate with each other, and how family and community are always the centerpiece.\n\nMy son, who is a college student, lives with his favorites on The\n\nYoung and the Restless. He says it's escapism he can count on, and maybe even helps his occasional bout of loneliness.\n\nSoaps create a highly idiosyncratic version of reality, but the daily dramas also provide a constant in many people's lives. All My Children is about to enter its third decade, after all.\n\nTrue, the soaps present a parade of infidelity, incompatibility and incurability like all dramas, only more exaggerated. But even if the presentations are usually shallow, the shows do tackle timely issues, including AIDS, drugs, abortion and spouse abuse.\n\nAll My Children has won its share of awards (including 27 Emmys) and is known (after the lusty Erica) for its social consciousness, dating back to 1973 when Fickett won the first daytime Emmy for her performance as a mother in a march protesting the Vietnam War.\n\nAs the All My Children credo states: The great and the least, the weak and the strong, in joy and in sorrow, in hope and in fear, in tragedy and triumph, you are all my children.\n\nSoap fans: Give the news a break, okay?\n\nCoincidentally, one of the most frequently expressed complaints about TV from readers arrived in my mailbox during the holidays. The writer (I'll keep the name to myself) wants to know whether there's anything she can do \"to stop the news people from interrupting the soap stories with insignificant news reports.\"\n\nThe recently deceased 1989, which has been compared to 1968 as a tumultuous year for globe-shattering news events, did have dozens of breaking stories.\n\nSo here's where I get on a soapbox. Daytime serials are fluff 'n fun, but when the collapse of the Berlin Wall is unfolding, I want to be an eyewitness. There's so much trivial television, let's be appreciative when the small screen performs a vital service by providing live coverage as the real world turns.\n\nThis TV movie doesn't sound steady as the proverbial rock\n\nABC is not releasing much information about its TV treatment of the life story of Roy Fitzgerald, titled Rock Hudson, which airs from 9 to 11 p.m. Monday on WTSP-Ch. 10 and WWSB-Ch. 40.\n\nThe docudrama stars Thomas Ian Griffith as Hudson, who died of AIDS in 1985 at age 59. While the network is not supplying preview tapes for television critics, the news release indicates that most of the actor's life will be covered, including his marriage to Phyllis Gates (played by Daphne Ashbrook) and his years with companion Marc Christian (William R. Moses), who later sued Hudson's estate because the actor failed to inform him about his illness.\n\nA network spokesman said ABC does not have a preview tape because the TV movie still is being assembled. A shaky sign for any production, much less ABC's much-ballyhooed coup in being first with the Rock story.\n\nRock Hudson could be an interesting story, if it's not told in lurid style but sheds light on the plight of many homosexuals who feel they must keep their private lives a secret because of society's prejudices.\n\nBabes on the tube\n\nAnd so the New Year on television kicks off with a nursery theme, beginning with last night's Designing Women episode, in which Charlene (Jean Smart) had a baby girl, and continuing with Newhart's Stephanie (Julia Duffy) giving birth next Monday.\n\nIn real life, the actresses had boys. I don't want to spoil the surprise of what sex the yet-to-be delivered Newhart baby is, but (hint, hint) the news release about the major production is pink."
