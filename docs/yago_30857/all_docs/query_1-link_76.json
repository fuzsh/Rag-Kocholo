        "text": "About Ruth\n\nRuth is one of the most decorated American cyclists of the past decade and returned to the WorldTour in 2024 after two seasons away. A stage and the overall victory of the Tour Down Under in 2020, a stage of the Giro d’Italia Donne in 2018 (as well as a day in the pink jersey) and GC wins in the Czech Tour de Feminin and the Joe Martin Stage Race are particular standouts in her career. In her last season, she took a dramatic victory in the Brabantse Pijl classic, beating 2023 Tour de France Femmes champion Demi Vollering to the line in a last-gasp bike throw where only a photo finish could separate the pair.\n\nShe is no stranger to the elements it takes to perform and enjoys racing on a team that represents more than just racing. One of the changes during Edwards’ self-described “sabbatical” is that she has been able to watch more racing, something that has changed her mindset and brought more positivity into her racing. Off the bike, due to living at 8,000ft in Colorado, Edwards can be found skiing in the winter, walking with her dog in the summer and hanging out with her husband Zach. She says she does a little bit of running but jokes “not too much” and is a baker who always has banana bread ready to go."
