For decades she appeared alongside Ray MacDonnell, who played her on-screen husband, Dr. Joe Martin, in the fictional town of Pine Valley, Pa. She retired from the show in 2000.\n\nIn 1973, she became the first performer to receive an Emmy for work on a daytime soap opera. As the mother of a young man who was drafted to fight in the Vietnam War, Ruth Martin gave an impassioned antiwar speech that won Ms. Fickett the award.\n\nA native of Bronxville, N.Y., she was a seasoned stage, film, and television actress before “All My Children.’’ Her first feature was “Man on Fire’’ with Bing Crosby. In 1958, she was nominated for a Tony Award for her Broadway role as Eleanor Roosevelt in “Sunrise at Campobello.’’\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMs. Fickett cohosted the early 1960s CBS morning news-and-features program “Calendar’’ with Harry Reasoner.\n\nShe leaves a daughter, a son, and several grandchildren and great-grandchildren.\n\nGet Globe Weather Forecast\n\nYour essential daily forecast, delivered daily at 6:30 am.\n\nEnter Email"
