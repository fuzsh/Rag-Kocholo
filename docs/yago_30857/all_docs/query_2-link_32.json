They both were amazing in their daytime roles. I was so incredibly happy when Stuart Damon finally won his Emmy in 1999. I always hated that they killed off Alan Quartermaine ): This is really sad news ):\n\nThis is tragic. I hope they both rest in peace. Both brought me much joy over the years in their soap opera roles.\n\n\"and to the fans, I was only supposed be on every other Tuesday. But thanks to you I'm here to stay. I'm going back to that studio on Monday and I'm going to play Erica Kane for all she's worth.\"- Susan Lucci, 1999 Daytime Emmy Speech.\n\nSad news. RIP to both daytime legends.\n\nI have been listening to a CD of the off-broadway musical production of The Boys From Syracuse from 1963 – listening to Stuart Damon sing great songs by Rodgers & Hart that he performed in the hit off-Broadway production. “Dear Old Syracuse”. What a talent! So many wonderful memories of Dr. Alan Quartermaine, one of the best characters ever on daytime, played to perfection by a fantastic actor! R.I.P. Stuart Damon.\n\nMichael Fairman has a lovely tribute to Ray MacDonnell by many of his co-stars up on his website. He played the solid center of Pine Valley, back when we had such characters on daytime. R.I.P. Ray MacDonnell.\n\nA sad loss for the daytime community. I didn’t realize Stuart Damon was in his 80s.\n\nPhilece Sampler also passed away. She played Donna on AW and Renee on Days.\n\nSuch sad news. May each their souls rest in the Light.\n\nSooo many fond memories of both of them. I was never a big AMC fan but I loved Joe Martin. I especially remember some good scenes between him and Susan Lucci, with Dr. Joe being all paternal.\n\nAs for Stuart Damon, it is simply unforgivable that GH fired him. I’ve spoken about this before. It was under Bob Guza and Jill Farren Phelp’s bloodbath of Alan, Tony, Audrey, Emily, Georgie and anyone who wasn’t (barf) Sonny and Jason (barf). Anyway, I loved Alan Quartermaine. He was excellent during the addition storyline and I loved his chemistry with Jane Elliot and Leslie Charleson.\n\nRest in peace, both of these great actors.\n\nNot now\n\nViewing 10 posts - 1 through 10 (of 10 total)\n\nYou must be logged in to reply to this topic.\n\nSimilar Topics\n\nEmmyLoser - Aug 7, 2024\n\nDaytime TV\n\nadamunc - Jul 30, 2024\n\nDaytime TV\n\nEmmyLoser - Jul 19, 2024\n\nDaytime TV"
