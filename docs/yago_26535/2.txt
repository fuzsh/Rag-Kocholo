He passed away after a long illness at a London hospice.

Gilmore was born in Germany in 1931, before moving to the UK at the age of 6.

He was described as "a gentle man and a gentleman" by his Onedin Line co-star Jessica Benton.

She said: "The Onedin Line was a very happy, long-running series to be involved in and that was all credit to Peter because he made it so. We all became very close friends over the years and had a lot of fun. We sorely miss him."

Gilmore's agent Primie Carey said: "On behalf of his wife Anne and Peter's family I would like to thank those who have sent their kind thoughts and condolences."
