He had roles in eleven Carry On films, and appeared in many British films including The Great St. Trinian's Train Robbery (1966), Oh! What a Lovely War (1969), The Abominable Dr. Phibes (1971) and Warlords of Atlantis (1978). During his early career, he appeared in several stage musicals, including Lock Up Your Daughters, and released a single, \"Follow That Girl\" (HMV POP 740), in 1960. After achieving fame in the role of James Onedin, Gilmore felt he had become typecast as the rugged sea captain.\n\nHe later appeared in a Doctor Who serial Frontios (1984) in which he played a character called Brazen. Gilmore also appeared in a Heartbeat episode, called \"The Frighteners\", during the Nick Berry era; his third wife, actress Anne Stallybrass was a regular in the series.\n\nPersonal life\n\nHe married three times: to actress Una Stubbs (1958–1969), with whom he adopted a child; to Jan Waters (1970–1976); and to actress, and former Onedin Line colleague, Anne Stallybrass (1987–2013), who survived him.\n\nGilmore quit school at the age of 14 and started pursuing his dream of becoming an actor. He attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art for a short time before being expelled. When he joined the army he discovered that he had a talent for singing and after his discharge from the army he joined a singing group called the George Mitchell singers. They appeared in a couple of stage plays but they didn't have the success they wanted. Gilmore soon gave up singing and continued his acting.\n\nDeath\n\nPeter Gilmore died in London on 3 February 2013, aged 81. He was survived by his third wife (Stallybrass), and a son, Jason, adopted during his first marriage.\n\nFilmography\n\nActor\n\n1996\n\nOn Dangerous Ground (TV Movie) as\n\nMurdoch\n\n1994\n\nRuth Rendell Mysteries (TV Series) as\n\nFrank Malm\n\n- Master of the Moor: Part 2 (1994) - Frank Malm\n\n- Master of the Moor: Part 1 (1994) - Frank Malm (uncredited)\n\n1993\n\nHeartbeat (TV Series) as\n\nRaymond Walker\n\n- The Frighteners (1993) - Raymond Walker\n\n1993\n\nThe Bill (TV Series) as\n\nPeter Shaw\n\n- A Matter of Life and Death (1993) - Peter Shaw\n\n1992\n\nCasualty (TV Series) as\n\nLionel\n\n- Profit and Loss (1992) - Lionel\n\n1992\n\nCarry on Columbus as\n\nGovernor of the Canaries\n\n1992\n\nBenjamin Huntsman (Short) as\n\nBenjamin Huntsman\n\n1990\n\nHaggard (TV Series) as\n\nOne-Eyed Will\n\n- Daring Deeds (1990) - One-Eyed Will\n\n1987\n\nThe Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne as\n\nKevin O'Neill\n\n1986\n\nYou'll Never See Me Again (TV Movie) as\n\nReg Alden\n\n1985\n\nOne by One (TV Series) as\n\nBen Bishop\n\n- A Close Run Thing- (1985) - Ben Bishop\n\n- Thank You, Mr. D.H.
