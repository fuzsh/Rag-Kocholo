        "text": "In 90 episodes between 1971 and 1980, Peter Gilmore was the central character in The Onedin Line, a saga of a Victorian shipping company that was often the centrepiece of BBC One’s Sunday night viewing and attracted a devoted audience of millions. Gilmore played James Onedin, a ruthlessly ambitious, ruggedly handsome sea captain with luxuriant mutton-chop sideburns and a chaotic love life. It proved a winning combination.\n\nFor Gilmore, already a seasoned stage and film actor, it became a defining role. He became so fixed in the public mind as a nautical figure that he recorded an album of sea shanties and his postbag was roughly divided between female admirers and retired sailors offering advice."
