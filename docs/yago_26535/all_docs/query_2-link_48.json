        "text": "He was the third child of William Ernest Ball, a bank manager and Rosina whose other children were Marjorie, who died in 1980 and John, Thornton was his mother's maiden name and his middle name, He played the cello in his school's orchestra and was a corporal in the Officer's Training Corps which he left in1937 and became a clerk with the Guardian Insurance Company in London leaving to follow a colleague who'd left to be an actor and Frank thought he'd do the same and enrolled in the London School of Dramatic Art evening classes. In 1939 the school evacuated to Whitney in Oxfordshire. He went with them and still a student acted in the local repertory company which contained Peter Jones, In '1941 he was in the West End with Donald Wolfit and after that a year in The Scarlet #Pimpernel at Manchester Opera House where he met actress Beryl Evans, September '43 he was in the RAF and sent to Nova Scotia to train as a navigator, became a pilot officer and stayed on after the war in the entertainment unit with 3 corporals- Peter Sellers, Dick Emery and Tony Hancock. He was demobbed in 1947 and the same year in the musical The Dancing Years. Mid November 1950 he was compare on television's The Centre Show , a variety show in which Hugh Lloyd made his debut. Frank married Beryl on the 5th January 1945 and had a daughter, Jane in 1946 and lived in West Wickham in Kent\n\nPhyllis Hannah Bickle was born in Chelsea in 1915 and studied dancing at the Margaret Morris school of dance, until an injury forced her to give up dancing and turn instead to acting. Her 70 year film career began with a bit part in The Arcadians (1927) when she was just 12 years old. Along with over 40 movies, she had a successful stage career, spanning 1925 ('Crossings' with Ellen Terry) to 1994 ('Bed') - appearing in such works as 'Blithe Spirit', 'The Heiress' and 'Peter Pan', as the title role of the boy who never grew up.\n\nPhyllis' film breakthrough came in 1941 in the adaptation of the HG Wells story, Kipps - Roman eines einfachen Menschen (1941) in which she was cast as the servant girl, a part which had originally been turned down by Margaret Lockwood. In her next film, she was starring opposite international star Robert Donat, a far cry from the music hall comedians (George Formby, Arthur Askey) she had been acting with only a few years earlier. Der Herr in Grau (1943) truly catapulted her to stardom and from then on there was no looking back. Phyllis Calvert became one of the names most associated with the Gainsborough costume melodramas of the 1940s, usually as the sweet heroine, or the steadfast non-nonsense leader.\n\nAfter a small trip to Hollywood in the late 1940s, Phyllis returned to England and earned her one BAFTA nomination for the role of the mother of a deaf girl in Mandy (1952) but after that her film career slowed down, with family taking precedence. While shooting Indiskret (1958), Phyllis was struck a cruel blow when her husband of 16 years, Peter Murray-Hill, passed away. Her stage career picked up markedly in the 1960s when she began taking more and more roles to better raise their two children solely. She gracefully slid into a niche of character roles, usually the kindly mother or aunt, and in 1970, had her own TV series, Kate (1970). In the 1980s she concentrated more on television, only appearing twice on stage. Her final play was in 1994, film in 1997, and TV appearance in 2000.\n\nThis vibrant Scottish character actress managed in her seven-decade career trek to not only brighten up the Broadway stage during the 1950s and 1960s in roles ranging from the man-searching milliner Irene Malloy to Hamlet's mother Queen Gertrude, but conquered the TV market too, delighting daytime audiences for not only standing toe-to-toe against Susan Lucci's Erica Kane character (and later becoming her surrogate mom), but issuing in-your-face lessons on morality to other infamous Pine Valley characters on the classic soap opera All My Children (1970).\n\nEileen Herlie was born Eileen Herlihy on March 8, 1918, in Glasgow, Scotland, the daughter of a Catholic father and a Protestant mother. She studied and performed for many years with the Scottish National Players before transporting herself to England where she became professionally associated with the late and great director Tyrone Guthrie. Making her official stage debut with \"Sweet Aloes\" in 1938, she went on to advance in such plays as \"Rebecca\" (1942), \"Peg o' My Heart (1943), \"The Little Foxes\" (1944), \"John Gabriel Borkman\" (1944), \"The Second Mrs. Tanqueray\" (1944), \"The School for Scandal\" (1945) and \"Anna Christie\" (1945) before making a strong impression as Queen Gertrude in \"Hamlet\" in late 1945. Her film debut came in support of Margaret Lockwood and Dennis Price in the costume drama Der kupferne Berg (1947), but her huge breakthrough came about when Laurence Olivier cast her as his mother, Queen Gertrude, in his film adaptation of Hamlet (1948) -- this despite Eileen being 11 years younger than Olivier, who won the Oscar for his superb work in the title role. Years down the road Eileen would again earn acclaim playing Gertrude in the 1964 Broadway production of \"Hamlet\" starring Richard Burton and in its accompanying Hamlet (1964) film effort.\n\nSurprisingly, Eileen was seen very infrequently on film after this initial success opposite Olivier. Instead she stayed true blue to her first love -- the theatre. Although she appeared to fine advantage on celluloid in The Angel with the Trumpet (1950), The Story of Gilbert and Sullivan (1953), Isn't Life Wonderful! (1953), Glück auf Raten (1954), She Didn't Say No (1958) and Freud (1962), she found even more rewarding roles under the theatre lights where she earned enviable notices for her work in \"The Eagle Has Two Heads\" (1946), \"Medea\" (1948) (title role), \"The Way of the World\" (1953) and \"Venice Preserv'd\" (1953).\n\nThe feisty, flaming red-haired Scot took her first Broadway bow in 1955 as hat shop owner Irene Molloy in the highly successful production of \"The Matchmaker\" with Ruth Gordon starring as Dolly Levi. Eileen also appeared in New York musicals, co-starring with Jackie Gleason in the nostalgic \"Take Me Along\" (1960), which merited her a Tony nomination, and Ray Bolger in \"All-American\" (1962). Elsewhere, she graced two of Peter Ustinov's plays (\"Photo Finish (1963) and \"Halfway Up the Tree\" (1967)) and continued in classic regal fashion with her Queen Mary role opposite George Grizzard's Edward VIII in \"Crown Matrimonial\" (1973). She played the same role a year earlier in a TV film version opposite Richard Chamberlain as the abdicating King Edward and Faye Dunaway as paramour Wallis Simpson. Eileen's last stage role was in \"The Great Sebastians\" (1974) in Chicago co-starring Werner Klemperer, and her final film part came with a featured role in Chekhov's Die Möwe (1968), directed by Sidney Lumet and surrounded by a superb cast that included Simone Signoret, Vanessa Redgrave, David Warner and James Mason.\n\nIn 1976, Herlie made a long and permanent switch to daytime soaps. As bawdy, plump-figured carny Myrtle Lum Fargate who later refined herself to a point and operated a frilly boutique store on All My Children (1970), audiences took a special liking to her down-to-earth character whose impulsive bluntness, staunch integrity, briny tongue and heart of gold made her one of Pine Valley's more beloved residents. She remained in town for over thirty years.\n\nDivorced twice with no children, Eileen died at age 90 on October 8, 2008, due to complications from pneumonia. The stalwart actress continued to act almost to the end, last playing her \"All My Children\" character in June of 2008.\n\nJoyce Redman was an Anglo-Irish actress. She was twice nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, without ever winning the award.\n\nRedman was born in an Anglo-Irish family in Northumberland. The family eventually moved back to County Mayo, Ireland, where Redman was raised. She and her three sisters were educated at home by a private governess. Redman later pursued an acting education, and was trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in London. She graduated from the Academy in 1936, at the age of 21.\n\nRedman remained primarily a theatrical actress for decades, though she also appeared in television films. She performed at both the Comédie-Française in Paris and The Old Vic in London. One for her theatrical hits was playing the role of Anne Boleyn (c. 1501-1536) in the play \"Anne of the Thousand Days\" (1948) by Maxwell Anderson (1888-1959). In 1949, she appeared in this role in New York City, to great success. In 1955, Redman in 1955, joined the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon, where she primarily appeared in Shakespearean roles.\n\nRedman made her film debut in the spiritualism-themed drama \"Spellbound\" (1941), where she played an unnamed maid. Her first credited role was that of Jet van Dieren in the war film \"One of Our Aircraft Is Missing\" (1942). The film was an unusually realist take on the war, and has been considered a classic of British cinema.\n\nRedman's next film appearance was the role of Mrs. Waters (a.k.a. Jenny Jones) in \"Tom Jones\" (1963).. In the film, Mrs. Waters has a sexual affair with protagonist (played by Albert Finney) without being aware of his background; when the story later reveals that she is the long-lost Jenny Jones, who had claimed to be Tom's biological mother when he was a foundling, the impression is given that they unknowingly committed incest, which is played for comic effect when Mrs. Waters learns after the fact who Tom is (it ultimately turns out that Tom's biological mother was actually not Jenny but another character in the story, so there was no incest after all). For this role, Redman was first nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. The award was instead won by rival actress Margaret Rutherford (1892-1972).\n\nRedman next appeared in \"Othello\" (1965), an adaptation of the 1603 play by William Shakespeare. Redman played Emilia, Iago's wife and Desdemona's maidservant. In the play and its adaptations, Emilia steals Desdemona's handkerchief and hands it over to Iago. Iago then uses the stolen handkerchief to frame Desdemona for adultery. When Emilia denounces her husband's plan, Iago kills his wife in order to silence her. For this role Redman gained her second and last nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. The award was instead won by rival actress Shelley Winters (1920-2006).\n\nRedman's following film appearance was the comedy film \"Prudence and the Pill\" (1968), where five couples use contraceptive pills to avoid unwanted pregnancies. Her final film role was the drama film \"A Different Kind of Love\" (1985), playing the lead role of Mrs. Prior. In the film, Mrs. Prior urges her son to marry, despite the fact that her son is homosexual and has an ongoing relationship with another man.\n\nRedman played an elderly Queen Victoria (1819-1901, reigned 1837-1901) in the mini-television series \"Victoria & Albert\" (2001). Afterwards she retired from acting. She died in May 2012 due to pneumonia. She was 96-years-old, one of the oldest living actresses.\n\nCheerful-looking actress Dinah Sheridan was considered the quintessential English rose of late 30's and 40's British films. With an alertness, elegance and quiet beauty second to none, she won the hearts of war-torn England during WWII.\n\nShe was born Dinah Nadyejda Ginsburg in London on September 17, 1920. Her Russian father and German mother were photographers to the Royal Family, by appointment to both the Queen and Queen Mother. Dinah's first professional role was an understudy part of Rsoamund in \"Where the Rainbow End.\" She subsequently went on tour as Wendy in \"Peter Pan\" starring Charles Laughton as Captain Hook and wife Elsa Lanchester in the title role, and appeared in repertory during the war years.\n\nDinah broke into films at the tender age of 16 with a starring role in a meek, lowbudget piece Landslide (1937). Her co-star was young Jimmy Hanley, in his first adult role, and the two would later marry in 1942, having three children (one died in childbirth). Dinah continued in both drama and light comedy as the youthful ingenue in such films as Behind Your Back (1937), Father Steps Out (1937), Merely Mr. Hawkins (1938) and Irish and Proud of It (1938). Jimmy and Dinah became a popular WWII-era film couple, appearing quite winningly together in Salute John Citizen (1942), 29 Acacia Avenue (1945) and The Huggetts Abroad (1949). One of their children, Jenny Hanley, followed in her parents' footsteps as an actress and TV presenter.\n\nDinah remained a lovely presence in a variety of post-war films, gracing such productions as the stark melodrama The Hills of Donegal (1947); in the whodunnit Wer ist Rex? (1948) opposite John Bentley as part of a husband/wife detective team; in the crime drama Die Maske fällt (1948) as the title nurse; the adventure drama Schwarzes Elfenbein (1951); and the romantic war piece Der unbekannte Feind (1952).\n\nDivorced from Hanley in 1952, Dinah, following a secondary role in the biopic The Story of Gilbert and Sullivan (1953) and after starring role in one of Britain's most delightful 50's comedies, Die feurige Isabella (1953), co-starring John Gregson, Kenneth More and the sublime Kay Kendall, abruptly retired on a high note after marrying Sir John Davis, the President of the Rank Organization, in 1954. Following her second divorce, and after 11 years of obscurity, Dinah made a return to the stage in 1967 with the play \"Let's All Go Down the Strand.\" She continued with prominent 70's roles in \"A Boston Story,\" \"A Touch of Purple, \"Move Over Mrs. Markham\" (title role), \"The Card,\" \"The Gentle Hook,\" \"The Please of His Company,\" \"A Murder Is Announced\" and toured in the play \"Half Life.\"\n\nAfter impressing as the hard-luck mother who is forced to raise three children alone after her husband abandons the family in the drama The Railway Children (1970), Dinah chose to focus squarely on TV with roles in such programs as \"Seasons of the Year,\" \"Zodiac,\" \"Crown Court,\" \"Village Hall,\" \"Whodunnit?,\" \"Doctor Who,\" and her final TV appearance in a 1999 episode of \"Jonathan Creek.\" She also appeared in the mini-series The Winning Streak (1985) and co-starred in two British comedy series Don't Wait Up (1983) and All Night Long (1994).\n\nDinah married for a third time to actor John Merivale in 1986, but he died four years later. Her fourth marriage, to American businessman Aubrey Ison, ended with his death in 2007. Dinah died in London at age 92 on November 25, 2012.\n\nBorn Joan de Beauvoir de Havilland on October 22, 1917, in Tokyo, Japan, in what was known as the International Settlement, to British parents, Lilian Augusta (Ruse), a former actress, and Walter Augustus de Havilland, an English professor and patent attorney. Her paternal grandfather's family was from Guernsey in the Channel Islands. Her father had a lucrative practice in Japan, but due to Joan and older sister Olivia de Havilland's recurring ailments the family moved to California in the hopes of improving their health. Mrs. de Havilland and the two girls settled in Saratoga while their father went back to his practice in Japan. Joan's parents did not get along well and divorced soon afterward. Mrs. de Havilland had a desire to be an actress but her dreams were curtailed when she married, but now she hoped to pass on her dream to Olivia and Joan. While Olivia pursued a stage career, Joan went back to Tokyo, where she attended the American School. In 1934 she came back to California, where her sister was already making a name for herself on the stage. Joan likewise joined a theater group in San Jose and then Los Angeles to try her luck there. After moving to L.A., Joan adopted the name of Joan Burfield because she didn't want to infringe upon Olivia, who was using the family surname.\n\nShe tested at MGM and gained a small role in Schluss mit den Frauen (1935), but she was scarcely noticed and Joan was idle for a year and a half. During this time she roomed with Olivia, who was having much more success in films. In 1937, this time calling herself Joan Fontaine, she landed a better role as Trudy Olson in You Can't Beat Love (1937) and then an uncredited part in Quality Street (1937). Although the next two years saw her in better roles, she still yearned for something better. In 1940 she garnered her first Academy Award nomination for Rebecca (1940). Although she thought she should have won, (she lost out to Ginger Rogers in Fräulein Kitty (1940)), she was now an established member of the Hollywood set. She would again be Oscar-nominated for her role as Lina McLaidlaw Aysgarth in Verdacht (1941), and this time she won. Joan was making one film a year but choosing her roles well. In 1942 she starred in the well-received This Above All (1942).\n\nThe following year she appeared in Jungfräuliche Liebe (1943). Once again she was nominated for the Oscar, she lost out to Jennifer Jones in Das Lied von Bernadette (1943). By now it was safe to say she was more famous than her older sister and more fine films followed. In 1948, she accepted second billing to Bing Crosby in Ich küsse Ihre Hand, Madame (1948). Joan took the year of 1949 off before coming back in 1950 with Liebesrausch auf Capri (1950) and Born to Be Bad (1950). In 1951 she starred in Paramount's Darling, How Could You! (1951), which turned out badly for both her and the studio and more weak productions followed.\n\nAbsent from the big screen for a while, she took parts in television and dinner theaters. She also starred in many well-produced Broadway plays such as Forty Carats and The Lion in Winter. Her last appearance on the big screen was Der Teufel tanzt um Mitternacht (1966) and her final appearance before the cameras was König Wenceslas (1994). She is, without a doubt, a lasting movie icon.\n\nA brash, sharp-tongued, incorrigible actress/singer who led a six decade career that contained many highs and lows, veteran Elaine Stritch's raucous six-decade career certainly lived up well to the Stephen Sondheim song lyrics \"I'm Still Here.\" A popular, magnetic performer, she stole so many moments on stage she could have been convicted of grand larceny This tough old bird approached her octogenarian years with still-shapely legs, a puffy blonde hairdo, a deep, whiskey voice and enough sardonic bluster and bravado to convince anyone that she would be around forever.\n\nThe Detroit-born (February 2, 1925) Elaine Stritch was the daughter of a B.F. Goodrich executive, of Irish/Welsh heritage, and the youngest of three sisters. Educated locally at Sacred Heart Convent and Duschesne Residence Finishing School, she prepared for the stage at the Dramatic Workshop of the New School where fellow \"school mates\" included Marlon Brando. She made her first appearance at the New School as a tiger and a cow in a 1944 children's production entitled \"Babino,\" then followed it the following year with the part of a parlor maid in \"The Private Life of the Master Race.\"\n\nElaine made it to Broadway in October 1946 as \"Pamela Brewster\" in \"Loco\" at the Biltmore Theatre. Taking over the part of \"Miss Crowder\" in \"Made in Heaven\" after that, she finished off the decade appearing in such theatre productions as \"Three Indelicate Ladies,\" \"The Little Foxes\" (as Regina), the revue \"Angel in the Wings\" and \"Yes M'Lord.\"\n\nFrom the 1950's on, Elaine would become the toast of both Broadway and (later) London's West End, earning award-worthy acclaim on both continents over the years. Starting with a tour of \"Pal Joey\" (as Melba) in 1952, she followed this success with such shows as \"Call Me Madam\" (as Sally); \"On Your Toes\" (as Peggy); \"Bus Stop\" (Tony nom: as waitress Grace), \"The Sin of Pat Muldoon\" (as Gertrude); \"Goldilocks\" (as Maggie); \"Sail Away!\" (Tony nom, and also London debut as Mimi); \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" (as Martha); \"The King and I\" (as Anna); \"The Grass Harp\" (as Babylove); \"Wonderful Town\" (as Ruth); \"Private Lives\" (as Amanda); \"Mame\" (as Vera, then Mame); \"Company\" (Tony-nom: as Joanne); \"Small Craft Warnings\" (as Leona); \"The Gingerbread Lady\" (as Evy); \"Show Boat\" (Drama Desk Award: as Parthy); and \"A Delcate Balance\" (Tony-nom, Drama Desk Award: as Claire). Through sheer personality alone, her cacophonous singing voice miraculously took classic songs from, among others, Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart to Noël Coward and Stephen Sondheim and put her own indelibly raucous stamp on them.\n\nOddly, Elaine never made the same kind of impact on film. Nevertheless, she appeared in an armful of supports over the years, growing increasingly abrasive, in such movies as Alle Spuren verwischt (1956), Rivalen ohne Gnade (1956), In einem anderen Land (1957), Urlaubsschein nach Paris (1958), Kiss Her Goodbye (1959), Who Killed Teddy Bear (1965), Brillanten-Razzia (1966), The Sidelong Glances of a Pigeon Kicker (1970), Das Geheimnis der Wendeltreppe (1975), Providence (1977), September (1987), Cocoon II - Die Rückkehr (1988), Cadillac Man (1990), Tango gefällig? (1997), Jagabongo - Eine schrecklich nette Urwaldfamilie (1998), Dumm gelaufen - Kidnapping für Anfänger (2000), Schmalspurganoven (2000); Es begann im September (2000), Das Schwiegermonster (2005), ParaNorman (2012) and River of Fundament (2014)\n\nThe actress fared somewhat better on early TV. She appeared as one of the Paynes in the early Dumont family comedy series The Growing Paynes (1948), and made appearances on several anthology series (\"Kraft Theatre,\" \"Goodyear Playhouse,\" \"The Alcoa Hour,\" \"The Dupont Show of the Month\"). A few guest spots also decorated her small screen resume, including \"Mister Peepers,\" \"Adventures in Paradise\" and \"Wagon Train\". In the 60's, Elaine returned to the series format, but only enjoyed single season life on three: My Sister Eileen (1960), as Ruth Sherwood; the acclaimed The Trials of O'Brien (1965) as lawyer Peter Falk's secretary \"Miss G.\"; and as Ellen Burstyn's derisive mother on The Ellen Burstyn Show (1986).\n\nIn 1973, Elaine married English actor John Bay and moved to London. While there she appeared in a number of plays/musicals and then played an American authoress in the British comedy series Two's Company (1975) co-starring Donald Sinden as the butler. When she returned to America in the early 80's, she returned alone.\n\nAt age 76, a razor-sharp Elaine captivated audiences in a candid one woman musical stage memoir that would win her the Tony, Drama Desk, Obie, Outer Circle Critics and New York Drama Critics awards. Elaine Stritch at Liberty (2002) show also chronicled her notorious private life, combative nature, which included a long bout with the bottle (to curb her stage fright), and a destructive relationship with fellow alcoholic Gig Young. Add to that a fair share of Hollywood gossip all cleverly packaged up with raw wit and show-stopping patter songs and you had quintessential Elaine Stritch. Truly one of a kind, she would eventually be inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame in 1995.\n\nOther memorable TV appearances included her Aunt Polly in the mini-series Pollyanna (1973); a 1984 continuing role on the daytime soaper The Edge of Night (1956); the role of Ouisar in the TV movie version of Steel Magnolias (1990); and three Emmy Award-winning portrayals -- as a guest on \"Law & Order,\" for the 2004 TV documentary of her one-woman triumph, and for a recurring character on the hit sitcom 30 Rock (2006).\n\nA diabetic, it took stomach cancer to finally slow this woman down at the end, dying at age 89 on July 17, 2014, at her Michigan home."
