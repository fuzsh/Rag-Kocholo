        "text": "While being best known for his role in the seafaring saga Gilmore also starred in a number of Carry On films, West End musicals and had some success as a singer, releasing a few albums and performing in ­concerts throughout Europe.\n\nBorn in Leipzig, Germany, Gilmore moved to the UK when he was six and grew up in North Yorkshire.\n\nHe settled in London while still a teenager and worked in a factory for a time before studying at Rada.\n\nA stint in the Army led to the discovery that he had a singing talent and after being demobilised he joined The George Mitchell Singers, and performed all over the country.\n\nAfter he decided to focus on his acting career his breakthrough role came via Ivanhoe in 1958.\n\nGilmore went on to enjoy West End musical stage success with roles in Lock Up Your Daughters and The ­Beggar’s Opera.\n\nThroughout the Sixties he became a familiar sight in the Carry On films, appearing in 11 of them, including Carry On Up The Khyber and Carry On Cowboy. However it was his role as Captain Onedin that made him a household name and transformed his fortunes.\n\n“I shall always be grateful to The Onedin Line because it gave me a lot of financial security,” he said in 1995. “None of us imagined the series would last for more than a decade. For an actor that’s a lot of work.”\n\nGilmore added: “Luckily I was never seasick and we often filmed in stormy conditions.”\n\nHis last screen role was in the 1996 television movie On Dangerous Ground with Rob Lowe.\n\nDespite vowing never to marry again after two failed marriages to actresses Una Stubbs, of Worzel Gummidge fame, and then Jan Waters, in 1987 he married long-term partner Anne Stallybrass, who played his wife, also called Anne, in The Onedin Line.\n\nShe survives him along with his son Jason from his first marriage\n\nHe died at a London hospice after a long illness."
