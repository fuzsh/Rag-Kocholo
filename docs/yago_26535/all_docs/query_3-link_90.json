        "text": "Description:This district was framed under the Spaniards in 1769. It included all the inhabited country between the Missouri and Mississippi rivers, extending to the north indefinitely, and to the Pacific on the west. It became St. Charles County in 1813. The town of St. Charles was founded on the northern bank of the Missouri River in 1769 by Blanchette surnamed \"Le Chasseur.\" The Spaniards acquired the territory from the French by secret treaty in 1762 (See Upper Louisiana), and in 1769 divided it into five districts; District of St. Genevieve (1735); District of St. Louis (1764); District of St. Charles (1769). In the two remaining districts, that of Cape Girardeau and New Madrid, the posts were established later, the first in 1794, the latter in 1787. This appears a plausible explanation of the name as applied to this part of Missouri. There was a fort also that bore the name of Charles, established by a Spanish officer one year earlier, 1768, on the edge of this district. Louis St. Ange de Belle Rive, (written also Bellerive), a distinguished French officer, took command of the post of St. Louis in 1765. During his command, Captain Francisco Rios, a Spanish officer, in 1768, attempted to take possession of Upper Louisiana (q.v.) without displacing St. Ange. Captain Rios erected a fort on a high bluff on the south side of the Missouri River about fourteen miles north of St. Louis, and this he named \"Fort Prince Charles.\" The fort was afterwards occupied by General James Wilkerson in the year 1805 with U.S. troops. Captain Rios seems to have attempted to exercise no civil authority. He returned to New Orleans in 1769. Charles III was on the throne at this time. His son became Charles IV in 1788. The replacement of Charles by St. Charles is not to be regarded as an attempt to canonize an all too human monarch. It was rather a gesture of humility, by which the king's name was replaced by that of his patron saint, just as the city founded in 1764 was named, not, as is often stated for the reigning monarch, Louis XV, who was certainly anything but a saint, but for the good St. Louis, i.e. Louis IX. In the same spirit Peter the Great of Russia named his new capital St. Petersburg, and Joseph Robidoux in 1843 named the new metropolis of Buchanan County St. Joseph, --in both cases not for themselves but for their patron saints, or \"name\" saints. Those who do not understand the Catholic attitude toward their saints often mistake for egotism what was at least intended for piety and reverence. It is true that St. Charles is hard to identify. There was certainly no saint among all the host of monarchs named Charles,--French, Spanish, German, English, and others, in spite of certain unsuccessful attempts to canonize the unfortunate Charles I of England. But there have been a few acknowledged saints who have borne the name, among whom perhaps the most important, and the one most likely to have been venerated by the Spanish officers of Charles III and IV, was St. Charles Borromeo (1538-1584), Archbishop of Milan, Papal Secretary of State under Pius IV, and one of the chief factors in the Catholic Counter-Reformation (see the Catholic Encyclopedia). (Davis and Durrie, 47, 186; Shepard, 14, 49; Rozier, 55, 56, 96, 105, 142, 145, 146, 170, 179, 193, 223; INTERN. CYC.)Description:A creek that rises in southeastern Warren County, near the headwaters of the Dardenne and Perruque, and flows east through Femme Osage Township in St. Charles County, to empty into the Missouri River near Hamburg. This is one of the oldest and most puzzling French names in the state. It puzzled the exploreres of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, who passed its mouth on May 23, 1904, and they attempted to translate the French name in various ways, none of which seemed to have survived them. Clark writes (I. 27); \"...to the mouth of a Creek on the Stbd. Side called Osage Womans R, about 30 yds. Wide, opposite a large Island and Settlement. On this creek 30 or 40 famlys are Settled.\" Floyd calls it \"the wife of Osage River;\" and Ordway (Quaife's ed., p. 80) says \"passed the wife or faim of the Hoozaw River.\" For Ordway's spelling \"Hoozaw\" for Osage, cf. Whosau Trace, below. A fuller description of the stream is given by Lewis in his \"Summary View of Rivers and Creeks\" (VI. 30): \"at the distance of nine miles higher up\" (i.e., above Bonhomme Creek), \"we pass the mouth of the OSAGE WOMAN'S river, which discharges itself on the north side; it is thirty yards wide at it's entrance, heads with two small streams which discharge themselves into the Mississippi a small distance from the mouth of the Illinois River, is navigable for perogues some miles during the spring season, and waters a fertile well timbered country inhabited by about fifty American families. This part of the country is generally called Boon's settlement, having derived its name from its first inhabitant Colo. Daniel Boon, a gentleman well known in the early settlement of the state of Kentucky.\" Cf. the note by the editor Thwaites: (I. 27) \"The American settlement referred to...was the Kentucky colony recently founded on Femme Osage River, about six miles above its mouth; among these settlers was Daniel Boone, who in 1798 had obtained a grant of land there from the Spanish authorities, whereon he resided until 1804. His death occurred at Feeme Osage, on September 26, 1820.\" The original French name must, of course, have been much older than Lewis and Clark, although no earlier published example has been found. Its ultimate origin is, indeed, lost beyond recall. There have, of course, been imaginative attempts to supply an explanation, such as that the stream was named from the finding in it of the body of a drowned Osage squaw, or else that the French so named it because they saw an Indian woman there when they first reached its banks. Similar stories have been invented to explain the similar and equally early French names Bon Homme Creek and Bonne Femme Creek, for a nearby stream which also empties into the Missouri River. Very probably all three names were French translations of the original Indian appellations. (L&C, ed. Thwaites; Ordway JOURNAL, ed. Quaife; EWT. ed. Thwaites; Conard II, 422; Barns, 173; Williams N.E. MISSOURI I, 681; COUNTY ATLAS 1875, 12; Miss Leech's thesis; Benj. Emmons)Description:A town in the western part of Cuivre Township. A very early town called Mellville, or Millville, on a site 3/4 mile from the present Foristell, seems to have been the nucleus for the latter town. No reason as to why Mellville, or Millville, was chosen has been found, although the Millville in Ray County (see Miss Atcheson's thesis) may account for the change to Foristell. Millville is a stock name for American towns, being found in at least fifteen other states. A third name, that of Snow Hill, must be considered in connection with this name. For many years, even long after Foristell was established as a town on its present site, the name Snow Hill was applied to the post office and was doubtless a name borrowed from some other place as it is a place-name found in five other states. Considerable confusion exists in the various authorities as to the time when Foristell was laid out as the dates 1836, 1856, and 1857 are all found. Since old settlers state that Foristell received its present name and location shortly before the Civil War and since some authorities list 1856 or 1857 as the date when the town was laid out by the owner, J.A. Davis, we may assume that it had its beginning as a town name about that time. However, the post office was still known as Snow Hill until 1876 or 1877, when it was changed on account of the confusion said to be caused by another post office of the same name. However, the old name of Mellville, or Millville, was still sometimes used for the town as late as 1875. Mr. Davis named the place in honor of Pierre Foristell, an honored citizen of the community who was born in Ireland and died in 1893. (Postal Guide; Campbell, 488, 490; COUNTY ATLAS 1875, 12, 14; 73; HIST. ST. CHARLES, 504; Eaton, 58; Mrs. P.O. Foristell; Benjamin Emmons; Earl C. Gray)Description:A historic island in the Mississippi River, opposite Alton, Illinois. It was formerly a famous dueling ground on account of its seclusion and its accessibility from Illinois, which forbade dueling. At that time, the laws of Missouri took no cognizance of the dueling habit and considered it to be an excellent way to settle disputes. In 1841 Abraham Lincoln was dissastisfied with the stand that James A. Shields, State Auditor of Illinois, had taken when he and some other executives demanded that state taxes be paid in some form of currency other than the practically worthless banknotes circulated at that time. Lincoln maintained that this was a means whereby certain state officials would save themselves from the financial troubles of their countrymen. Soon after the statement of the auditor, a caustic newspaper article, reported to have been written by an indignant country widow, attacked Shields. Letters followed which even offered marriage to a man so well able to weather the financial crisis of the time. Although Lincoln had written only the first articles, he accepted all the responsibility for authorship to protect two mischievous young women for their part in writing the later contributions. Shields was so angry that he challenged Lincoln to a duel. All efforts to talk the auditor out of his plans were of no avail. Finally, the two antagonists, accompanied by their seconds, set out for the fated Baylis Island across the river in Missouri. Since Lincoln had the choice of weapon, he suggested \"cannon at fifty paces.\" This absurd proposal provoked laughter from the seconds, who succeeded in convincing the auditor of the humor of the situation and the absurdity of a duel over a practical joke. Shields relented and became a personal friend of Lincoln. On the way back to Alton, the future president covered a log with some clothes and laid it in a conspicuous place in the bottom of the boat. When the curious citizens of the town came to see what had been the outcome of the duel, they were met with the sight of what appeared to be the body of a man. Just then Lincoln dramatically dumped the log into the river. Originally known as Alton Island, for its former owner, Alton Easton, son of Rufus Eaton, founder of Alton, Illinois, and the first postmaster of St. Louis. When it came into the possession of Mrs. Baylis (or Baylass), it was then called Baylis (or Baylass) Island, the name it bore during its famouis dueling days. It is now owned by the House Loomis Ice and Transportation Company, and is named Lake Island for Alton Slough, (q.v.). (RED BOOK, 1912-14, 452b; ST. C. C-M, March 12, 1902; Benj. Emmons; Earl C. Gray)Description:A girl's school situated on King's Highway in the western part of St. Charles. Sometime between 1827 and 1829, the college was established on 120 acres of land which Major George C. Sibley had recieved because he had paid a $20,000 bond-debt for a friend. The school operated until 1843 and closed for one year, to be reopened again. By 1835 it was firmly established, but did not grow until 1853. When Major Sibley and his wife, Mary Easton Sibley, were converted and joined the church, they decided to use the land for a Christian college for young women, and named the institution Linden Wood for its beautiful grove of Linden trees. In 1853 Major Sibley called the school Lindenwood Female College, at which time he offered the property to the Presbytery of St. Louis. The property was accepted and was placed under the control of fifteen directors appointed by the Presbytery. Although never a seminary in the ecclesiastical sense, the school is often called Lindenwood Seminary,--a term formerly of general application. Major George C. Sibley was born in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, April 1, 1782 and was educated at Fayetteville, North Carolina. In 1805 he came to Missouri and served as a clerk in the new Indian store or factory which the U.S. Government had established at Fort Osage. In 1810 he was made Indian Agent and was placed in charge of the post at that place. In 1816 he was appointed Justice of the Peace for a large district in Missouri, then known as Howard County. In 1820 he was appointed Postmaster at Fort Osage. He did much to cultivate friendship between the early settler and the Indians. In 1844 he was defeated for the State Senate by forty-nine votes, and in 1851 he helped organize the State Lunatic Asylum at Fulton. From 1851 until his death in 1863, he was a semi-invalid, but took an active part in the affairs of college and state. Major Sibley's wife was Mary Easton Sibley, a daughter of Rufus Easton of St. Louis, who was the first postmaster of that town and was one of the first United States Judges of the Territorial Court in Missouri. Mary Easton was born in 1800 and died in 1878. She attended Mrs. Tevis' Boarding School for Young Ladies, at Shelbyville, Kentucky; and at the age of fifteen, she married Major Sibley. She was vitally interested in the college and public affairs, and had the first piano west of the Mississippi. The school is called Lindenwood College for Young Ladies in HIST. ST. CHARLES. All forms for the name were given for the linden trees. One reference gives Major Sibley's name as George S. Sibley, but all college records consulted list it as George C. Sibley. (COUNTY ATLAS 1875, 14; HIST. ST. CHARLES, 71, 315; Williams N.E. MISSOURI I, 559; Templin, REMINISCENCES, 8, 49-50; THE SIBLEYS, 3-15; Guy Motley)Description:This mightiest of American rivers, which forms the eastern boundary of the state, enjoyed a considerable variety of names that were at least proposed for it in the earliest period after it became known to white men, before common usage finally accepted the name it now bears. Fernando de Soto, who discovered it in May, 1541, desired it to be called Rio Grande de Espiritu Santo, i.e., the Great River of the Holy Ghost. When it was next visited by Europeans, however, De Soto's name had been forgotten. Father Jacques Marquette, who descended it with Louis Joliet (or Jolliet) in 1673, suggested the name Rivere de la Conception, in fulfillment of a vow he had made to the Virgin if he succeeded in his expedition. Joliet preferred the name Rivere Buade, and actually entered this name on his map of the rivers he discovered in 1673 and 1674. Joliet's name was designed to honor his patron Governor Frontenac, whose family name was Baude: Louis de Baude, Comte de Frontenac et Palluau (1620-1698), Governor of New France from 1672 to 1698. Frontenac was the son of Henri de Baude, colonel in the regiment of Navarre, although he is better known by the name he received when he was ennobled. Still a different name was proposed by the first explorer to reach the mouth of the river, Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, in 1682. He christened it Rivere de Colbert, in honor of Jean Baptiste Colbert (1619-1683), minister of finance under Louis XIV, who had financed his expedition. Later French Jesuit explorers who moved up and down the stream referred to it frequently as the Rivere de St. Louis. This name, like that of the city of St. Louis founded and named by Auguste Chouteau and Pierre Liguest Laclede in 1764, was indirectly in honor of King Louis XV of France, but directly, after the Catholic fashion, in honor of the king's patron saint, St. Louis, or Louis IX, who had ruled France in the thirteenth century. Perhaps if the French and Spanish explorers had been able to agree on a single name, or a single person to honor, their choice of a name for the great river might have prevailed. As it was, however, the final victory in the long rivalry of nomenclature went to one of the names used by the aborigines. The Indians also had a multiplicity of names for the stream: among them was the Pekitanoui River and the Mississippi. Into the lively controversy over the etymology and correct spelling of these Indian names the present writer is not competent to enter. Suffice it to say that is seems probable that the name finally accepted, the Mississippi, is of Algonquian origin, a compound of two stems meaning \"great\" and \"river;\" so that the name is excatly equivalent in its significance to that of another great American stream, the Rio Grande. The present spelling, out of a large number of variant forms, was adopted about the time of the Louisiana Purchase.
