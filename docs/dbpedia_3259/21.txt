Heptathlon for women, an Olympic Game since 1984, replaced pentathlon with the addition of the 200 meters’ race and javelin throw. It is placed on the top of the most difficult competitions in track and field athletics. The fact that the athlete must perform in 7 different games in 2 days means that they should equally develop the 5 biokinetic skills simultaneously: speed, strength, endurance, coordination and flexibility.

Timetable and Rules and Regulations

As one of the combined events in track and field athletics, the sequence by which the athletes compete is always the same, as you can also see in PORTARATHLON timetable:

1st day: 100m Hurdles, High Jump, Shot Put, 200m race. 2nd day: Long Jump, Javelin Throw, 800m race.

In the long jump and in all the throwing competitions, the athlete is allowed 3 tries/attempts. In the high jump the rules and regulations of individual competitions apply. In the racing games, the athlete that makes the 2nd invalid start is excluded from the race.

Scoring

The goal of the athlete is to collect as many points as possible in each of the 7 different games. Ranking of Heptathlon athletes is based on special algorithms, which calculate the athlete’s score depending on her performance. The sum of scoring in each of the 7 games gives us the final total score of the athlete for the specific combined event.

Technical and Physical condition of High Standards

Heptathlon is exceptionally demanding and strenuous: not only it demands versatile education in basic and combined training, as well as in training for high performances but it also has training particularities for athletes.

Special talent, techniques for each individual discipline and great stamina are basic parameters for women athletes that take up Heptathlon. It normally takes at least 4 years of training for an athlete to successfully qualify for Heptathlon.
