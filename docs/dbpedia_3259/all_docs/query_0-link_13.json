Patriarch4\n\nP:05\n\n5\n\nP:06\n\nARCHBISHOP DEMETRIOS HIS EMINENCE ARCHBISHOP DEMETRIOS Primate of the Greek Orthodox Church in America6\n\nP:07\n\nMESSAGE OF THE ARCHBISHOP Jesus said to them again, âPeace be with you. As the Father has sent me, even so I send you.â (JOHN 20:21)Beloved Brothers and Sisters,By the wondrous grace of God, once again in our lifetime we celebrate in a spirit of greatexpectations the beginning of a new yearâa year given to us by our loving and saving Godas a priceless opportunity for creative work, true joy and lasting peace.We left behind a year marked by a horrendous event, a year shadowed by the September 11thexplosion of darkness and evil. At the very same time, however, we vividly experiencedthe brilliance of an unprecedented generosity of hearts and minds, an explosion of light andgoodness, an unconditional offering of all kinds of help and support.This spirit of offering, this reality of offering, must be characteristic of all the faithful of our GreekOrthodox Archdiocese in the year 2002, but not only as an answer to the grave consequencesof September 11th. Offering belongs to the very essence of our Orthodox faith and tradition;it is an integral part of our Greek Orthodox heritage. The words of the Lord are clear: âAs theFather has sent me, even so I send youâ (John 20:21). We as Church, in direct continuitywith the Holy Apostles and the members of the Early Church, are being sent by Christto offer to the world, in the measure of our capacity, what He has offeredâlove and joy,consolation and support, peace and forgiveness.We are on a sacred and vital mission to offer our Orthodox faith to contemporary America.We, as the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America, are sent by Jesus Christ to offer to ourfellow citizens of this blessed country a living faith, strongly experienced as the illuminatingtruth, as unconditional love and as uplifting worship.May the Lord help us as Omogenia and Church in achieving faithfully our sacred missionin contemporary America. May He make the year 2002 a year of the glory of an offeringthat excludes no one, that has no limitationsâa year of the triumph of the generosity of heartsand minds. With paternal love in Christ, â DEMETRIOS Archbishop of America 7\n\nP:08\n\nMESSAGE OF THE ECUMENICAL PATRIARCH Your Eminence, Archbishop Demetrios of America, most honorable Exarch of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, beloved brother in the Holy Spirit and co-celebrant of our Modesty; Grace be with Your Eminence and peace from God. For the year 2002 we wish God Almightyâs blessings upon our much beloved children in Christ, who reside in the great country of the United States of America, and bear witness to our Orthodox faith and tradition. Unfortunately, in 2001 we mourned the loss of thousands of victims caused by terrorist attacks, as a result of humanityâs disconnection from Godâs way, which is the way of love, peace and solidarity. We wholeheartedly pray that murderous acts will cease in the future, and that the grace of our Lord, Jesus Christ will protect and lead you in 2002, and grant you and all who love Him peace and abundance. May the Lord guide your steps into the way of salvation for His holy name to be forever glorified by you and by all people. May He grant rest to the souls of the victims of the terrorist attacks in America and throughout the world. Thus, we brotherly embrace Your Eminence and Your brothers in Christ, and bestow upon the pious clergy and flock of the Holy Archdiocese of America our wholehearted paternal and Patriarchal blessing. 15 September 2001 â Bartholomew Patriarch of Constantinople beloved brother in Christ8\n\nP:09\n\nMESSAGE OF THE ARCHBISHOPÌÏ¨ÎÎÎ ÎÐÎ Î ÐÎÎÏ§Î Ï³ ÍÎÎÎÐÎ ÎÎ£ÎÎÎ:ÌÏ¢ÎÏÎÎ ÐÂµÏ§Î: ÎÎ ÎÐÎ Î¦ÎÎ½ÎÎÎ ÎÎÎ½Î ÂµÎ Ï³ ÎÎ ÎÏÎ,ÎÎ¦ÎÐ ÎÎ½ÂµÎÎ ÐÂµÎºÎ (ÍÎÎ Î. 20,2Å) ÌÎÎ ÎÎÎÎÏ ÂµÎÎ ÌÎÎÎÎÎÏ ÎÎ Ï ÌÎÎÎÎÎ½Î, ÌÎ¾ ÎÏÎ ÎÎ ÎÂµÎ ÎÎÏ ÎÎ£ÎÎ ÎÎÐ ÌÎÎÐ, ÎÎÎ¤ ÂµÎÎ¤Î Î¦ÎÏ±ÂµÎ ÎÎÎÎ¤ ÎÎÏ ÎÎÏ ÂµÎ Î,ÎÎÎÎÎÎ£ÎÎÎÂµÎ ÏÎ ÎÎÎÏ¾ÂµÎ ÎÎ ÂµÎÎÎ£ÎÎÎ ÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÐÎ ÎÏÎ Î¦ÎÎÏ Î¿ÎÏ²Î ÎÎ ÎÎÎÏ¾ÎÎÎÎÎ ÎÎÏ±ÎÎÎ.Ì´ÎÏ²Î ÎÎ½ÎÎ ÏÎÎÎÎ, ÎÏ² Ï³ÎÎÏ§Î Ï³ ÌÎÏ²Î ÎÏÎ Î¦ÎÎ£ÎÎÎ ÎÎ Ï ÎÏÎ ÎÎÎÎÎÏÎ Î ÂµÎºÎ ÎÎÎÎÎÎ½ÎÎÎ ÐÎÂµÏÎ Î¦ÎÎÎÎÏÂµÎÎÎ ÎÐÎÎ ÎÎÏÎ ÎÎÎ¤ ÎÎÂµÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÏ² ÏÎÎÎ, Î¦ÎÎÎÎÎÏ ÎÎ ÎÎ¤ ÎÎ Ï ÎÎÎ ÎÎÏ ÎÏ¢ÎÏÎÎ.

Remember therefore Jesus Christ, risen from the dead...â (2 Timothy 2:5-8) Jr. Olympic Spiritual Charge In 1982, Fr. Kosmas Karavellas, former assistant pastor of SS. Constantine & Helen Church in Palos Hills, Illinois and Metropolitan (then Bishop) lakovos of Chicago inaugurated The Greek Orthodox Diocese of Chicago Junior Olympics. This annual event, now under the direction of Fr. Nicholas W. Jonas, brings teens and preteens together to enhance the spirit of Christian Athletic Fellowship. Since its inception, the Junior Olympics continues to be hosted annually by the com- munity of SS. Constantine & Helen in Palos Hills, Illinois at the church complex and the neighboring facilities of A.A. Stagg High School and Moraine Valley Community College. On Memorial Day weekend over two thousand youth, ages 7-18, from over 37 parishes, representing the six mid-western states of the Diocese of Chicago; Illinois, Missouri, Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, participate in a conglomera- tion of individual and team athletic events. Participants compete in several different sporting events on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, including basketball, volleyball, soccer, tennis, softball, track and field, 10K run, swimming, chess and checkers, table tennis, and bowling. Moreover, several different collegiate scholarships, totaling $2000.00, are presented on behalf of the Junior Olympics to athletes showing a strong spiritual life, academic record, community involvement and writing skills. On May 25, 2001 the Diocese of Chicago Junior Olympics celebrated its 20th Anniversary. Stewardship contributions of the participating parishes, various individuals, organizations, and businesses as well as the hard work of each and every volunteer have made this event such a success for twenty years. Each year a particular project or organization that involves either the Greek Orthodox community or the greater community at large is highlighted, such as the Kosta Z Foundation, Saint Basilâs Academy in Garrison, New York, Yellow Ribbon Suicide Prevention Program, The Greater Chicago Food Depository, and the Teen Living Program for Runaway Youths. The bonds that have been created by those who have participated in the Junior Olympics remain strong, as former participants bring their own children to participate in this annual event that builds friendships that last a lifetime. All athletes involved can go back to their parishes and homes knowing they gave their best, not only for themselves and their team- mates, but also for the Glory of God and His Church. 65\n\nP:66\n\nDIOCESE OF SAN FRANCISCO His Eminence CALIFORNIA ALASKA Metropolitan Anthony Anaheim Anchorage of the Dardanelles Bakersfield Belmont ARIZONA Presiding Bishop Camarillo Diocese of Cardiff by the Sea Chandler Castro Valley Flagstaff San Francisco Claremont Peoria Colton Phoenix Nameday: January 17 Concord Consecration: May 21, 1978 Covina (Cathedral) Enthronement: June 7, 1979 Downey Scottsdale El Cajon TucsonGreek Orthodox Diocese of San Francisco Elk Grove372 Santa Clara Avenue, Fresno HAWAIISan Francisco, CA 94127 IgnacioTel.: (415) 753-3075 â¢ Fax: (415) 753-1165 Irvine HonoluluE-mail: [email protected] Lancaster (Cathedral)Web Page: www.sf.goarch.org Long Beach Los Angeles MauiChancellor: Rev.

The exquisite Byzantine katholikon (monastery church) is now nearly completed, and we are currently laboring to finish the kelia (monastic cells). The monastery of St. Anthony (for men) was founded in 1995 in the Sonora Desert near Florence, Arizona. The âmiracle in the desert,â St. Anthony Monastery has grown explosively to become one of the largest Orthodox monas- teries in the western hemisphere. The Monastery of St. John the Forerunner (for women) was founded in 1995 in a beautiful mountain setting in Goldendale, Washington. CAMPS AND RETREAT CENTERS The Diocese of San Francisco operates four beautiful camp and retreat facilities. St. Nicholas Ranch and Retreat Center was founded in 1980 in the Sierra Nevada foothills near Dunlap, California. From its humble beginnings with âa nickel and a nail,â it has grown to become one of the premiere retreat and conference centers on the west coast. Camp Angelos was founded in 1977 in a beautiful wilder- ness setting on the Sandy River near Portland, Oregon. All Saints Camp and Retreat Center was founded in 1980 on Raft Island near Gig Harbor, Washington; its waterfront facilities feature a wide variety of water sports and activities. St. Sophia Camp and Retreat Center was founded in 1962 in the foothills of the San Bernardino Mountains. In addition to year-round camping, retreats, and activities, the Diocese camps also feature special programs such as âKids ânâ Cancerâ for children with cancer and their families, and âCamp AXIOSâ for inner-city youth. CLERGY LAITY CONGRESS From June 30-July 4, 2002, the Diocese of San Francisco will host the 36th Biennial Clergy-Laity Congress in Los Angeles, California. Our hope is to recapture something of the freshness and vitality of earlier Congresses, while at the same time remaining faithful to the pioneering spirit which has always characterized the western frontier of this great nation. The official theme of the Congress is âOffering our Orthodox Faith to Contemporary America,â based on John 20:21, âAs the Father has sent Me, so I send you.â As members of the Body of Christ, we are charged and empow- ered to engage the world in a dynamic movement of witness (marturiva) and service (diakoniva), communicating our faith with the same boldness and creativity which characterized the Fathers of the Church in their own time and place. We look forward to welcoming you to Los Angeles on June 30, 2002! 67\n\nP:68\n\nDIOCESE OF PITTSBURGH His Eminence St. Photios Metropolitan Maximos Pennsylvania: West Virginia: of Ainou Aliquippa Charleston Presiding Hierarch Altoona Clarksburg Diocese of Pittsburgh Ambridge Huntington Bethlehem Morgantown Nameday: January 21 Camp Hill Weirton Consecration: June 18, 1978 Canonsburg Wheeling Enthronement: April 27, 1979 Clairton East Pittsburgh MonasticGreek Orthodox Diocese of Pittsburgh Easton Communities: Erie5201 Ellsworth Avenue Farrell Perrysville, OHPittsburgh, PA 15232 Johnstown Saxonburg, PATel.: (412) 621-5529 Lancaster Weatherly, PAFax (412) 621-1522 McKeesport Galion, OH Monessen Cleveland, OHWebsite: www.odpgh.com New Castle New Kensington Summer CampChancellor: Fr.
