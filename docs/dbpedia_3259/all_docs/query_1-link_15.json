M. Coetzee. Seven Lectures and Five Moral Tales\n\nBased on J.M. Coetzee’s works Elizabeth Costello, A Slow Man,and Moral Tales\n\nCan art save the world? Or is the desire of artists to ‘speak’ through art and make an impact simply utopian? This is the question posed by Elizabeth Costello, the fictional heroine of South African Nobel laureate J.M. Coetzee, to her creator.\n\nYet, Elizabeth Costello is not just a fictional literary character. One could argue that she is Coetzee’s artistic alter ego: speaking on his behalf, she suffers the criticism and wrath of his readers and critics. According to Coetzee, Elizabeth Costello invades his imagination and writings, and then uses his voice to talk about philosophy, the environment, social and existential issues, or to raise awareness of animal abuse, social injustice, and the exclusion of the elderly and disabled. She is something of a ghost, always returning to haunt her creator.\n\nThe beloved Polish director Krzysztof Warlikowski constantly makes reference to Coetzee’s work: Costello seems to be haunting Warlikowski’s theatre, as she has already appeared in five of his performances so far – at times as herself and at times as an allusion. However, this is the first time that he devotes an entire play to her, making\n\nCostello the central character in his new performance.\n\nHis new production premieres in spring 2024 at Warsaw’s Nowy Teatr and after that will be presented in Barcelona, Liege, Paris, and Stuttgart among others. The Festival is a proud co-producer of this work and has the privilege of presenting it first, immediately after its world premiere in Poland.\n\nDirected by Krzysztof Warlikowski•Written by Krzysztof Warlikowski, Piotr Gruszczyński•Collaborators Łukasz Chotkowski, Mateusz Górniak, Anna Lewandowska •Dramaturgy Piotr Gruszczyński•Set design – Costumes Małgorzata Szczęśniak•Music Paweł Mykietyn•Lighting design Felice Ross •Video – Animations Kamil Polak •Artistic collaborationClaude Bardouil•Make-up Monika Kaleta •Cast (in alphabetical order)Mariusz Bonaszewski, Magdalena Cielecka, Andrzej Chyra, Ewa Dałkowska, Bartosz Gelner, Małgorzata Hajewska-Krzysztofik, Jadwiga Jankowska-Cieślak, Maja Komorowska, Hiroaki Murakami, Maja Ostaszewska, Ewelina Pankowska, Jacek Poniedziałek, Magdalena Popławska•Production Nowy Teatr•Co-production Schauspiel Stuttgart (Germany), Festival d’Avignon (France), Théâtre de Liège (Brussels), La Colline –théâtrenational, Paris (France), Les Théâtres de la Ville de Luxembourg, Malta Festival Poznań 2024 (Poland), Athens Epidaurus Festival (Greece)\n\nPartners:Kinoteka, IAM, Culture.pl, Institut Français de Pologne\n\nCo-financed by the Polish Ministry of Culture and National Heritage from the CulturalPromotion Funds – a state purpose fund\n\nCo-financed by the Ministry of Culture and National Heritage of Poland\n\nAdam Mickiewicz Institute is the main partner of the 2024/25 European tour of “Elizabeth Costello”\n\nNowy Teatr is financed by The City of Warsaw.\n\nCopyright for Elizabeth Costello © 2003 by J.

As with a restaurant menu, its structure is set in advance. What is presented on stage, however, is shaped by the dancers in real time, as per Mandafounis’ familiar choreographic method. The starting point is always the encounter between the ensemble and the audience, just as if they were cooking a colorful menu together.The Festival extends this generous invitation to spectators, signalling the opening of this year’s Dance programme.\n\nChoreography Ioannis Mandafounis• Performed by the dancers of theDresden Frankfurt Dance Company• Assistant to the Choreographer Pauline Huguet• Musical direction Manon Parent• Dramaturgy Anna Lemonaki,Philipp Scholtysik• Stage lights Ioannis Mandafounis• Costumes Thomas Bradley\n\n5 June Post-show talk with the artists.\n\nPEIRAIOS 260 E –DANCE\n\n5 – 7 June\n\nANASTASIA VALSAMAKI\n\nTHE VERSO\n\nHow can the dance body and choreography resist the typical‘on recto’ contact with the audience and create moving landscapes? The performance THE VERSO is inspired by the romantic movement Rückenfigur’s aesthetic tendencies and experiments with the ‘back figure’, symbolically and literally.\n\nIn the early 1800s, the German painter Caspar David Friedrich revisited the same theme over and over: figures gazing magnificent landscapes, with their backs to the viewer. In THE VERSO, four dancers expose their backs to the audience, creating a series of atmospheric images that alternate between moving and static landscapes. The absence of eye contact and a sense of bodies being misplaced make up an unprecedented dramaturgical pact, where visible and invisible elements each time propose new performative narratives. A ‘passport’performance to new explorations, like a painting’s verso, which reveals its journey through time.\n\nConcept – ChoreographyAnastasia Valsamaki• Dramaturgy Rodia Vomvolou• Music Jeff Wager •Costumes – Setdesign Dido Gogou•Lighting design Eliza Alexandropoulou •Co-created and performed byGabriela Antonopoulou, Maria Vourou, Petros Nikolidis, Xenia Stathouli•Assistant choreographer Anna Anousaki • Production managerKassie Kaffetsi / CULTOPIA• Executive production MIND THE LOOP\n\nPEIRAIOS 260 B\n\nART INSTALLATION –DISCUSSIONS METAPOLITEFSI CYCLE\n\n5 – 7 June KALPAKTSOGLOU –C.

Using it as a springboard and source of inspiration,\n\ncurator Xenia Kalpaktsoglou, art historian and curator Christoforos Marinos, and author Christos Chryssopoulos revive the conditions that gave life to thatprogramme as a multidimensional and ongoing project. The set is completely reconstructed and transformed into a visual art installation, hosting works and archival material that comment on the timeline of the Metapolitefsi era (in cultural, political, social, and ideological terms). During the first three days, the set will host numerous open discussions with speakers from a variety of fields (artists, academics, activists). The discussions will be filmed in real time to produce three contemporary versions of a television dialogue while maintaining the qualities of the programme’s original concept.

Born and raised in Burkina Faso, West Africa, he is well aware of social inequalities and poverty; his choreographies are born out of contestation, desire for rebellion, and hope.\n\nIn his new work, he employs the rich tradition of African culture to create a modern-day rite of initiation and invites us to take part in the dismantling of the old world. In this ritual, there are no trials for the hero to overcome, but a single challenge: how to coexist with others. Seven dancers, a singer, and a musician explore alternative ways of living together that bridge the gap between cultures. In a world swirling towards self-destruction, the only antidote is the joy of coexistence.\n\nCoulibaly has been working worldwide since 2001. Although deeply influenced by his collaboration with Alain Platel, as the choreographer admits, his homeland remains his chief source of inspiration. It is there where he founded Faso Dance Théâtre in 2002. It is also there where he engages in community outreach projects, such as the flagship initiative Ankata, an interdisciplinary laboratory of research and creation in the performing arts founded by Coulibaly in 2014 in his hometown Bobo-Dioulasso.\n\nConceived and choreographed by Serge Aimé Coulibaly • Assistant to the Choreographer SiguéSayouba• Co-created and performed by Jean Robert Koudogbo-Kiki, Ida Faho, Angela Rabaglio, Guilhem Chatir, Djibril Ouattara, Arsène Etaba, Bibata Maiga, Dobet Gnahoré,Yvan Talbot • Song Dobet Gnahoré• Music Yvan Talbot aka Doogoo D • Dramaturgy Sara Vanderieck• Artistic assistant Hanna El Fakir • Lighting design Emily Brassier • Costume artistic direction – Stage design – Video Eve Martin • Videographer John Pirard• Costumes Mira Van den Neste • Mask Stephan Goldrajch • Technical coordination Thomas Verachtert• Lighting direction Hermann Coulibaly • Sound direction Andreas Le Roy • Stage manager Dag Jennes • Production manager Arnout André de la Porte • Distribution Frans Brood Productions • Production Faso Danse Théâtre • Co-production Charleroidanse(Brussels), Kampnagel Hamburg (Germany), Tanz im August / HAU Hebbel am Ufer Berlin (Germany), La Rampe – La PonatièreEchirolles(France), Les Théâtres de la Ville de Luxembourg (Luxembourg), Festival RomaEuropa(Italy), Festival Culturescapes Basel (Switzerland), MünchnerKammerspiele(Germany), KVS-KoninklijkeVlaamseSchouwburg Brussels (Brussels), FestspielhausSankt•Pölten(Geneva) • With the support of the Flemish authorities and La Fédération Wallonie-Bruxelles, Service Général de la CréationArtistique – Service de la Danse• C la vie was created with the support of the Tax Shelter of the Belgian Federal Government\n\n12 June Post-show talk with the artists.\n\nPEIRAIOS 260 D – THEATRE – FRANCE\n\n13&14 June\n\nCAROLINE GUIELA NGUYEN\n\nLacrima\n\nAn haute couture house receives an unusual order: to make the wedding dress of a princess of the royal family of England. For eight months, various people –the dressmaker in Paris, the lace weaver in Normandy, the embroiderer in Mumbai– work on the secret project, unaware of what the final product will be. They all pledge not to reveal a single thing. And yet on stage we watch their fate and their dreams unfold. Caroline Guiela Nguyen, whom we met at the Festival in 2019 with the enchanting Saigon and in 2021 with FRATERNITY, A Fantastic Tale, weaves upon the toilsome process of creation a story about violence, both institutional and domestic, and about the tears that lie behind beauty.\n\nLacrima is the first act of a planned repertory of works that will form a ‘contemporary history of tears’.\n\nWritten and directed byCaroline Guiela Nguyen • Artistic collaboration Paola Secret • ScenographyAlice Duchange, Atelier de construction des décors du Théâtre National de Strasbourg • Costumes Benjamin Moreau, Atelier de construction des décors du Théâtre National de Strasbourg • DramaturgyLouison Ryser, Tristan Schinzand the dramaturgy class of Groupe 48 of the school of the Théâtre National du Strasbourg • Light design Jérémie Papin • Sound design Antoine Richard • Music Jean-Baptiste Cognet, Teddy Gauliat-Pitois, Antoine Richard • VideoJérémie Scheidler • WithDanArtus, DinahBellity, Natasha Cashman, Charles VinothIrudhayaraj, Anaele Jan Kerguistel, Maud Le Grevellec, Liliane Lipau, Nanii, Raji Parisot, VasanthSelvam and on film Louise Marcia Blévins, Fleur Sulmont • Casting Lola Diane • Sound Thibault Farineau • Lights Mathilde Chamoux • Videocollaboration Marina Masquelier, Philippe Suss • Régie générale Stéphane Descombes, Xavier Lazarini • Direction intern Iris Baldoureaux-Fredon • Sound intern Ella Bellone • Artistic counselingNoémie de Lapparent • Stage design – CostumesAtelier de construction des décors du Théâtre National de Strasbourg • Production Théâtre National de Strasbourg • Co-production Wiener Festwochen | FreieRepublik Wien, TransAmériques de Montréal, Comédie – Centre dramatique national de Reims, Points communs – Nouvelle scène nationale Cergy-Pontoise / Val d’Oise, Théâtres de la Ville de Luxembourg, Centro DrámaticoNacional, Piccolo Teatro di Milano – Teatro d’Europa, Théâtre de Liège, Théâtre National de Bretagne • Supported by Odéon – Théâtre de l’Europe, Théâtre Ouvert, Maison Jacques Copeau, Le CENTQUATRE-PARIS, Comédie-Française\n\nPremiere May 2024, Wiener Festwochen | Freie Republik Wien\n\nPEIRAIOS 260 E –THEATRE\n\n15 – 18 June\n\nVALERIA DIMITRIADOU\n\nNinety\n\nHow would we look at the world if we were ninety years old? Would we accept the approaching end or would we want to drink life down to the last drop? A member of the C for Circus group, Valeria Dimitriadou, who has been awarded by the Hellenic Association of Theatre and Performing Arts Critics for her play And God Planted Paradise, gives us a new humorous and tender text, a praise to life.\n\nAn old man in his nineties and his forty-year-old sonin a fast-paced city, a wild city. The first, although old, feels like he has just been born. The latter, although young, feels as if his life is coming to an end. Feeling weakand vulnerable, he decides to send his father to a home for the elderly. The old man’s only friend is a young handicapped girl, with whom they spend every day at the city’s central park lake. Why should an old man have to accept the end? Why can’t he go out there, fall in love, and make love? Is it because he is really unable to or because everyone else, ourselves included, do not let him?\n\nIn our youth-idolising era, the performance pinpoints to the taboo of old age. With live music on stage, it narrates an imaginary microcosm that strongly resists our dystopian present by putting empathy and solidarity to the forefront.\n\nWritten and directed by Valeria Dimitriadou • Set design Tina Tzoka• Costumes Dimos Klimenof•Lighting design Tassos Paleoroutas• Movement Katerina Fotiadi• Music Valeria Dimitriadou • Assistant to the Director Athina Sakali • Sound design Fivos Papagiannis • Cast (in alphabetical order) VaggelisAmbatzis, Andriana Andreovits, Konstantinos Aspiotis, ElieDriva, Maria Katsandri, Mihalis Panadis, Dimitris Papagiannis, Mariam Rukhadze •Management –Executive ProductionChrysa Kottarakou, Vasileia Taskou\n\nCo-funded by Greece and the European Union\n\nPEIRAIOS 260 B – OPERA/ PERFORMANCE RERUN\n\n15 – 18 June\n\nGIANNIS SKOURLETIS – bijoux de kant\n\nSongs of the Greek people – Drag Oratorio\n\nAfter its great success in the last year’s programme, Giannis Skourletis’ bijoux de kant returns with the Songs of the Greek People – DragOratorio, a groundbreaking performance, a bold reading, described by critics as ‘a leap in time, place, and gender’ (Lifo), and considered to have given birth to ‘a new artistic form that moves away from the strict confines of the nationality of art’ (Avgi).\n\nThe performance is inspired by the great Asia Minor composer, conductor, and pianist Giannis Konstantinidis (1903-1984). Having excelled in the genre of elafra (light) songs (‘Ksypna Agapi Mou’, ‘ThaXanartheis’, ‘Ta Nea tis Alexandras’, ‘Poso Lypamai’, among others) by the pen name Kostas Giannidis, his cycle of Twenty Songs of the Greek People moved on to create a transcending text, a musical composition on a par with his ‘twofold’ artistic oeuvre.\n\nBased on this charming song cycle and the texts of the artist and researcher Alexandros Papadopoulos, drag baritone Nina Nai, the performer Daglara and the pianist Giorgos Ziavras tell a story that may very well have been the screenplay of a Greek horror show. In a bizarre landscape, designed by the set designer Konstantinos Skourletis, they talk about the open trauma of patriarchy and deviance. They narrate a story about a different, often unseen, Greece. Idols of a well-hidden personal experience, they recount the passions and pain of otherness in a dystopian world.\n\nConceived and directed by Giannis Skourletis• Music Giannis Konstantinidis / Kostas Giannidis• Set design Konstantinos Skourletis• Costumes Daglara•Lighting design bijoux de kant • Text – Translation Alexandros Papadopoulos • Dramaturgy – Artistic coordination Giorgos Papadakis • Performed by Nina Nai (baritone in drag), Giorgos Ziavras(piano), Daglara (performer) • Production Manager AsimeniaEfhtymiou • Executive Production bijoux de kant\n\nPEIRAIOS 260 – DANCE\n\n15 & 16 June\n\nAEF URBAN DANCE CONTEST\n\nHip hop battle\n\nAll styles battle\n\nAfter its success in the previous years, the AEF Urban Dance Contest, which introduced the Peiraios260 audience to the hip hop and street dance universe, returns for a fourth time, staging new explosive dance encounters in two consecutive nights, always curated by the dancer and choreographer Elias Hadjigeorgiouand his dance companion Periklis Petrakis. Acclaimed and up-and-coming dancers will be competing in two categories (1vs1 Hip Hop Battle and 2vs2 All Styles Battle) to claim the title of the winner of the 4thAEF Urban Dance Contest and also remarkable cash prizes. The judges, comprised by distinguished dancers from Greece and abroad, will not only decide this year’s winners but will also give us the pleasure to enjoy them dancing in the Judges Showcases.

The disappearance of a big sum of money furthermore raises a lot of questions. The employee’s wife, asserting her right to know her husband’s whereabouts, is arrested.\n\nBased on actual events, playwright, director, and actor Rabih Mroué presents this work on a troubling criminal case and the implicated political and financial actors, searching for the “Truth” through relevant newspaper stories and photographs he has been collecting for decades.\n\nHe calmly but relentlessly compares all the material he has gathered. He sits among us as we may see his face while watching this meticulous presentation of the material on the screen. We gradually get a picture of the employee’s personality. His remains were found two months after his disappearance.\n\nMroué guides us to realise how manipulative and ambiguous all information is – in this case, in perfect agreement with the government’s interests.\n\nWritten and directed by Rabih Mroué•Cast Rabih Mroué, Hatem Imam •Set design Samar Maakaron• Assistants Talal Chatila, Ghassan Halawani • Video – interview Mohamed Soueid, Pamela Ghoneimeh• English translation Ziad Nawfal • Photography Houssam Mchaiemch • Production Christine Tohme, Ashkal Alwan, Nov. 2023\n\nPIRAEUS 260 H–THEATRE MONOLOGUES\n\n17 & 18 June\n\nNIKETI KONTOURI\n\nCryptogam by Michalis Albatis\n\nHaving caused a great sensation with his novel Let the Dead Bury Their Dead(Kai oi nekroi as thapsoun tous nekrous tous), published in 2022 (Nissos Publishing), the author Michalis Albatis writes for the Festivala theatrical monologue set in a small town in early 1980s Crete.\n\n‘The [Greek] words kryptón(secret) and gamein(marry), as the author explains, make up the title Cryptogam,which means to be secretly reproduced. This name was given by the Swedish botanist Carolus Linnaeus to the algae, fungi, bryophytes, and pteridophytes as their lack of flowers, fruits, and seeds made their reproduction seem like a mystery. However, the same mystery seems to also stand for human creatures whose gender classification is unclear and their role in the flow of evolution is nebulous (…). They are organisms that, in order to survive, imitate their peers, in manners, in how they dress or talk, forced to flourish only in the dark, filling their lungs with night. This is how they live, holding their breath for years.Yet, ifthey are left with no air, compelled to violently emerge into the light, a flashover is inevitable…’\n\nThe protagonists are ‘a butcher who didnot want to be born a butcher, who hates the smell of entrails and blood, a magic ring that transforms whoever wears it into what they most desireand fearto be, an engagement party, and a murdered transvestite who idolised Aliki Vougiouklaki, performing her songs in the streets and taverns under mockery and boos’.The author’s text centres around the savageness of rural Greece in the 1980s while the performance around those who have suffered the terror of marginalisation, failure, and public shaming. NiketiKontouri’s direction brings together a group of passionate artists, aiming at revealing the explosive mechanism between the words of such a humane text and the opening of another bright path leading to the acceptance of difference.

The leading Belgian director, former artistic director of the renowned Toneelhuis Theatre in Antwerp, tackles with a very personal theatrical language, in which he skilfullyintertwines on stage visual media and literature.\n\nClaudel’s novella, which the director treats as a monologue, tells the moving story of a man who is forced to flee his war-torn country with his young granddaughter and seek refuge in Europe, without being able to grasp the language. Through Mr. Linh’s story, the author insightfully speaks about the uprooting, trauma, reconciliation, camaraderie, and people’s vital need to connect and communicate. The monologue is performed by Constantine Markoulakis, who has also adapted the play into Greek.\n\nThe play premiered in Thessaloniki, on 22 March 2024.\n\nTranslated by Aspasia Sigala • Directed by Guy Cassiers• Adapted by Constantine Markoulakis• Performed by Constantine Markoulakis• Sound design Diederik De Cock, Ilias Flammos• Video design Bram Delafonteyne,Sibylle Meder •Lights collaborator Dimitris Koutas•Assistant to the Director Silia Koi•Production management Lykofos/ Konstantina AngeletouandToneelhuis/ Tanja Vrancken•Technical management Lykofos / Victor Berkan andToneelhuis/ Diederik Hoppenbrouwers•Video Art KlaasVerpoest•Production Assistants Xenia Kalantzi, Panucci Margelos•LykofosPR & Communication Manager Aris Asproulis•Marketing – Social Media LykofosRenegade • Co-production National Theatre of Northern Greece–Lykofos(G.

How does the body react if voice, language, content, and expression are predetermined?\n\nThe Forced Entertainment bodies insist on playing: they put on costumes and wigs; they continuously disorganise and reorganise the stage in ever-new useless and absurd arrangements with unquestionable seriousness – the more absurd the arrangement the more serious they get. A painfully comical choreography of out-of-tune communication between words and body language, resonating sad questions such as: Is this my hand? Is this my voice? To what extent is what we think, what we are, AI-produced?

In the aftermath of May 1968, the student movement in Greece raises a powerful voice against the dictatorship. The protest of youths and part of the Greek society that stood by them erupted as a natural and spontaneous need to resist authoritarianism and escalated into three unprecedented days of protest and ideological ferment, but above all of unanimity. What does this collective experience of solidarity and self-denial mean for us today?\n\nOn the occasion of the recent anniversary, the performance 50 Years, One Nightattempts a contemporary reading of this defining moment from the perspective of the theatre. The pulsating words of real protagonists comes to life through authentic testimonies of students, pupils, and other citizens –some published, others collected during the dramaturgical research– who took part, willingly or reluctantly, in the drama of History, each from his or her own position. Bringing together older and younger generations of actors and actresses, the performance puts together the puzzle of this volatile, violent, and without a particular outline event –as the American historian Janet Lugo describes the uprisings– in a collective narrative that becomes the raw material for a valuable theatre lesson and a guide in the search for the meaning of democracy.\n\nThe production is directed by Manos Karatzogiannis. With a series of performances on historical memory (Gia tin Eleni – For Helen, Xenes Portes – Strange Doors, Martyres ton Athinon – Martyrs of Athens, FylakasMiasEpanastasis – Guardian of A Revolution, Passport) as well as the film Melina Stop Karé–AnazitontastiSyghroniEllinikotita(Melina Stop Frame – Searching for Modern Greekness), thedirector collaborates again in dramaturgy with Dimitra Kondylaki, with whom he co-curated in AEF 2018 the retrospective exhibition – scenic installation Rooms of Memory: Wandering into Loula Anagnostaki’s World.\n\nDirected by Manos Karatzogiannis•Dramaturgy Dimitra Kondylaki, Manos Karatzogiannis•Music Tilemachos Moussas •Movement Zoe Chatziantoniou •Set designLoukia Martha •Costumes Vasiliki Syrma •Lighting Angelos Papadopoulos •Video Art Goran Gagic•Assistant to the Director Dina Debebe •Historical consultantKostis Kornetis•Cast(in alphabetical order)Stratis Hadjistamatiou, YvonniMaltezou, Katerina Maoutsou, Giannis Dalianis, Kalliopi Panagiotidou, Giorgos Nousis, Giorgos Vourdamis, Maria Zorba\n\nWith the participation of third-year students at the Drama School, Greek Art Theatre Karolos Koun (Marios Alexandris, Yannis Eskintzoglou, Anastasia Galerou, Anastasia Galerou – Vlassi, Christianna Ginoglou, Yannis Zervos, Dimitris Kakarontzas, Nefeli-VassilikiKaratsoli, Marianthi Koskina, Martha Orfanaki, Kelly Saravanou, Panos Theodorakopoulos, Marios Vertzinis, Natasa Vlysidou, Yannis Zervos).\n\nPEIRAIOS 260 B – DANCE – SPAIN\n\n28 – 30 June\n\nROGER BERNAT\n\nThe Rite of Spring\n\nBased on the choreography by Pina Bausch\n\nIgor Stravinsky’s TheRite of Spring choreographed by Vaslav Nijinsky is one of the most seminal ballets of the 20th century, which Pina Bausch reintroduced to us in an iconic 1975 performance. It is her ‘reading’ that inspired the Catalan avant-garde creator Roger Bernat to create this performance, which is a game and a choreography all at once.\n\nThe work has been performed in dozens of countries around the world, from Brazil and Canada to Egypt, Finland, and Japan.\n\nMusic by Igor Stravinsky • Scenic creation Roger Bernat • In collaboration with Txalo Toloza, María Villalonga, Ray Garduño, José-Manuel López Velarde, Tomás Alzogaray, Brenda Vargas, Diana Cardona, Annel Estrada, Viani Salinas • Technical direction Txalo Toloza • Sound design Rodrigo Espinosa • Sound editing Juan Cristóbal Saavedra Vial • Video design Marie-Klara González • Coordination Helena Febrés• Executive Production Alicia Laguna • Assistants to production Antígona González, Mariana Toledo • Runner Don Moisés\n\nPEIRAIOS 260 H – DANCE– ARGENTINA / BELGIUM\n\n29 & 30 June\n\nAYELEN PAROLIN\n\nZONDER\n\nTo the sounds of Strauss’ Blue Danube, three performers on stage are trying to find their footing and get in tune with each other in a game of ever-changing rules. Their persistence to completing the work, disregarding a decomposing set, is almost heart-rending.\n\nEmploying humour and self-mockery, the award-winning Argentinean choreographer Ayelen Parolin, who has been living and working in Europe since 2000, orchestrates in ZONDER a cheerful nightmare, a choreographic shenanigan that is open to all possibilities. Against the obsession over being goal-focused, finding meaning, a beginning and an end to everything, against contemporary Western society’s logocentrism, Paroline suggests that we defy the fear of failure and firmly embrace our mistakes. With ZONDER she creates an ode to the absurd, the unhelpful, the unintentional –a rare union of contemporary dance with comedy.\n\nChoreographed by Ayelen Parolin • Created and performed by Piet Defrancq, Naomi Gibson, Daan Jaartsveld• Artistic Associate Julie Bougard • Technical direction – Lighting design Laurence Halloy• Sound design Julie Bougard • Set design – Costumes Marie Szersnovicz• Lighting Laurence Halloy• Stage & Sound Manager Ondine Delaunois• Dramatic composition Olivier Hespel• Production Daniel Barkan, Alessandro Bernardeschi, Michael Schmid • Production RUDA • Co-production Théâtre National Wallonie Brussels (Belgium), Charleroi danse (Belgium), SurMars Mons (Belgium), Théâtre de Liège (Belgium), Manège Scène Nationale – Reims (France), Atelier de Paris / CDCN (France) • With the support of the Brussels-Wallonia Federation, Wallonie-Bruxelles International • Set and costume making at the workshops of Théâtre National WallonieBruxelles• Co-produced by La Coop, Shelter Prod. • With the support of the Belgian Federal Government Tax Shelter • Ayelen Parolin has been an associate artist at the Théâtre National de Bruxelles since 2022\n\n29 June Post-show talk with the artists.\n\nPEIRAIOS 260 D – DANCE\n\n3 & 4 July\n\nTZENI ARGYRIOU\n\nMIDATI\n\nIn her recent works and research, Tzeni Argyriou has been treating dance as an expression of the human need for contact and as a means of reconnecting with nature and the community –the already-existing one and that created on the spot at each gathering. She is inspired by the legacy of traditional and folk Greek dances as well as contemporary choreographic practices and she also assigns a central role to the relationship between dance and live music. Can dance today express the problems, the questions, and the need of modern humans for sociability? Dancers and musicians shape a visual landscape, making a record of sounds and movements that carry memories of dances from the depths of time but alsofrom the present, and gradually widening the concentric circles of a collective celebration. Can we invent new dances that express us and new rituals that unite us? What would such a celebration look like? Could we all ‘lend a hand’ in creating it? After all, this is what ‘midati’in the villages of Epirus means: the gathering to create, with everyone’s help, somethingneeded by the community. The MIDATI project was born in the light of these questions, putting at the centre the concepts of community, collectivity, and solidarity.\n\nConcept – Choreography TzeniArgyriou •Collaborating visual artist – Set designerVassilis Gerodimos •Original music composition, performance, sound editing on stage GiorgosGargalas, Nikos Tsolis • Dramaturgy Christiana Galanopoulou •Lighting design Nysos Vasilopoulos •CostumesVassilia Rozana •Assistant to the ChoreographerFotini Stamatelopoulou•Cast (in alphabetical order)Sotiria Koutsopetrou, ErmisMalkotsis, Tasos Nikas, Ioanna Paraskevopoulou, Despina Sanida-Krezia, Nancy Stamatopoulou, Sevasti Zafeira•Artistic collaborators Vitoria Kotsalou, Luke Macaronas, Stavroula Siamou•Management–Executive Production Delta Pi • Production AMORFI – AthensEpidaurus Festival\n\nCo-funded by Greece and the European Union\n\nPEIRAIOS 260 – THEATRE– GERMANY\n\n4 & 5 July\n\nSUSANNE KENNEDY –MARKUSSELG\n\nANGELA (a strange loop)\n\nWhat is the nature of reality?

A darkly poetic approach to the fundamental questions of existence, identity, and consciousness through the lens of illness.\n\nOne of the most important creators of her generation, a regular collaborator of Volksbühne, Susanne Kennedy was introduced to the Greek audience at the Athens Epidaurus Festival 2019 with the performance Virgin Suicides.\n\nConcept, text, and direction Susanne Kennedy • Concept – Set design Markus Selg • Sound design Richard Alexander • Soundtrack Richard Alexander, Diamanda La Berge Dramm• Live music Diamanda La Berge Dramm• Video design Rodrik Biersteker, Markus Selg • Costumes Andra Dumitrascu • Dramaturgy Helena Eckert • Lighting design Rainer Casper • Artistic associate Friederika Kötter • Stage Assistant Lili Süper• Assistants to Costume Designer Anna Jannicke, Anastasia Pilepchuk• Cast Diamanda La Berge Dramm, Ixchel Mendoza Hernández, Kate Strong, Tarren Johnson, Dominic Santia • Voices Ethan Braun, Rita Kahn Chen, Diamanda La Berge Dramm, Ixchel Mendoza Hernández, Tarren Johnson, Susanne Kennedy, Ruth Rosenfeld, Dominic Santia, Rubina Schuth, Cathal Sheerin, Marie Schleef, Kate Strong •Production Ultraworld Productions • Tour management and international distribution Something Great • Co-production Wiener Festwochen.

The booming of technological advancement and the challenge against traditional ideologies, the unknown is closer to us today than ever before as humanity stands uneasy in the face of tomorrow. Isolating on one’s own screens that shape an increasingly distorted version of reality and absence of physical contact create a new ‘community’lacking actual osmosis between people, empathy, solidarity. The old heroes may be dying but the new ones are also being rapidly dismantled by the mass and social media. And while we coexist, we do not know each other. We are scared of each other but we are scared of ourselves.\n\nExploring the symptoms of fear, always inspired by and employing street dance kinetic devices, this performance attempts to approach the physical expressions of fear; to feel for the dailymovement of a scared society, that is our society.\n\nChoreographed byElias Hadjigeorgiou• Music Alexis Falantas• DramaturgyDimitra Mitropoulou • Lighting design Nikos Vlassopoulos• Set design – Costumes Elias Hadjigeorgiou• Performed by Sofia Pouchtou, Kostas Phoenix, Dimitris Karageorgos, Haris Chatziandreou, Periklis Petrakis\n\nCo-funded by Greece and the European Union\n\nPEIRAIOS 260 B – DANCE\n\n9 – 11 July\n\nERMIRA GORO\n\nTELOS\n\nAcclaimed dance-makers join their forces to create a solo each for Ermira Goro, a member of DV8 Physical Theatre and a nominee for Outstanding Performer at the New York City BessieDance and Performance Awards (Bessie Awards).\n\nDrawing inspiration from the concept of ‘telos’ (the end), each creator unfolds his or her own artistic ‘language’in a modular project that highlights the transformative power of collective creation.

Inspired by the origin of the Euripidean heroine’s name (she who was born strong’), the Anastenaria, a northern Greek custom where participants step on burning coals, and also the sacrificial dance from Vaslav Nijinsky’s Rite of Spring. In Strong Born all these elements are intertwined to devise a new ritual, prevailed by the presence of a rhythm. In this ‘ritual’, within the confines of the stage, persistence and continuous interaction between three dancers reverse the demandfor sacrifice. The sound that designates the choreography is produced by percussive surfaces on the dancers’ bodies. The sacrificial ritual becomes the starting point of an act of resistance. Resistance to sacrifice becomes a vital empowerment path. The dancers on stage are accompanied by the percussionist Valentia Magaletti.\n\nConceived and choreographed by Kat Válastur•Performed by Noémie Ettlin, Xenia Koghilaki, NoumissaSidibé•Music – Live Performance Valentina Magaletti•Lighting design – Technical direction Martin Beeretz•Lighting design collaborator Vito Walter •Sound design – Surround mixing Vagelis Tsatsis•Assistant to Choreographer Michalis Angelidis •Set design Ulrich Leitner •Set design collaboratorLeon Eixenberger •Costumes Marie Gerstenberger / werkstattkollektiv•Porcelain & wooden objects Nina Krainer •Collaboration for porcelain Mercedes Bonzai•The porcelain was made at Ceramic Kingdom studio in Berlin •Scent Design Klara Ravat •Video – EditingEthan Folk, Nadja Krüger •Dramaturgy Filippos Telesto•Production management Marina Agathangelidou, Mascha Euchner-Martinez, Sina Kießling•Tour managementMascha Euchner-Martinez •Distribution Yann Gibert •Production Kat Válastur•Co-production Tanz im August (Germany), HAU Hebbel am Ufer (Germany) •Funded by theBerlin Senate Department for Culture and Europe, Capital Cultural Fund\n\nPEIRAIOS 260 D –THEATRE– HUNGARY\n\nINTERNATIONAL CO-PRODUCTION\n\n14 & 15 July\n\nKORNÉL MUNDRUCZÓ – PROTON THEATRE\n\nParallax\n\nHaving won over the Festival audience with his sharp eye for contemporary social issues and his spectacular on-stage novel of manners, world-renowned Hungarian director Kornél Mundruczó,after Imitation of Life in 2018 and Pieces of a Woman in 2021, returns to Athens with his Hungarian independent company Proton Theatre and Parallax. This play too is poignant and extremely topical: taking a Hungarian family as its starting point, it touches on the different approaches to the experience of Jewishness from generation to generation. Grandma, a Holocaust survivor, who in her life has learned to hide her Jewish identity, comes into conflict with her daughter, who, living in Berlin in the 1990s, tries to use this identity to enrol her son in a better school. However, as he grows up, he wants to shed any identity and wishes to belong nowhere else than the gay community he has consciously chosen. But in a society in crisis, with the sharpening of social divisions and the rise of the far right in Europe, is it possible to remain neutral? How can one separate the assertion of one’s own diversity from a broader political stance?\n\nWritten by Kata Wéber • Director Kornél Mundruczó • Dramaturg Soma Boronkay, Stefanie Carp • Set Monika Pormale • Costume Melinda Domán • Light András Éltető • Music Asher Goldschmidt • Choreography Csaba Molnár • Assistant to the Director Soma Boronkay • Cast Lili MonoriÉva, Emőke Kiss-VéghLéna, Erik MajorJónás, Roland RábaMárk, Sándor ZsótérLászló, Csaba MolnárGábor, Soma Boronkay Kornél • Light Technician Zoltán Rigó • Sound Technician ZoltánBelényesi • Prop Master Gergely Nagy • Cameramen Máté Takács, Mihály Teleki, Áron Farkas • Stage Master Tamás Hódosy • Stage Hand András Viczkó • Dresser Melinda Domán •Producer Dóra Büki • Assistant to the ProducerHenrietta Horváth • Artist Manager Miklós Kékesi • Technical Director András Éltető • Production Proton Theatre • Co-production Odéon-Théâtre de l’Europe, Wiener Festwochen, Comédie de Genève, Piccolo Teatro – Milano, HAU Hebbel am Ufer – Berlin, Athens Epidaurus Festival, Festival d’Automne, Maillon– Théâtrede Strasbourg –Scèneeuropéenne, CNDO Orléans, La Bâtie– Festivalde Genève • Supporters Számlázz.hu, Minorities Talents & Casting, Danubius Hotels\n\nKata Wéber’s text incorporates the ensemble’s improvisations.\n\nRecommended for 18+.The performance contains sexual scenes.\n\nPEIRAIOS 260 AT THE PLATEA\n\nPROLOGOS\n\nPRE-SHOW TALKS\n\nA foretaste of performances, just before the curtain goes up!\n\nDeveloped in collaboration with the Postgraduate Studies Programme of the Department of Theatre Studies, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, prologos(prologue) introduces us, in a vivid manner, to the artistic language of Theatre and Dance performances.

Their mission is to unravel the events surrounding the brutal abuse and killing of a beautiful pet dog in a rural Greek town, next to an ancient oracle. Which version is true? Was the killer a human, as was originally rumoured, or was this domestic dog a victim of a pack of other, stray dogs, as the authorities finally concluded? Will the detective dogs that have been sneaking in from different corners of the world manage to discover the truth? Are dogs capable of delivering justice better than humans? Could abused animals finally find justice in a dog state, freed from human authority?\n\nHaving won over the Greek and European audiences with his delightfully poignant TheVRepublic of Baklava, Anestis Azas returns to the Festival with an original text co-written again with Gerasimos Bekas and Michalis Pitidis. This time, the play is inspired by Aristophanes’ Birds with a zoomorphic Chorus of birds, which founds Cloud Cuckoo Land, an ideal state between the world of humans and that of gods. Based on a true story from recent crime news and using the documentary theatre method, a political allegory is developed on stage on the issue of social violence that is increasingly being perpetrated against the weakest.\n\nJust as Aristophanes has the birds rebel in order to punish the human species for its arrogance, so in this original play the dogs, which for many symbolise selfless love, loyalty, and friendship, are here united against humans. The incident of the abuse and killing of an innocent animal becomes the core of a play about the cruelty of human relationships and all it entails.\n\nConceived and directed by Anestis Azas •Text Michalis Pitidis, Anestis Azas •Collaboration for text developmentGerasimos Bekas •Dramaturgy and Assistant to the DirectorMichalis Pitidis •Music PanúManouilidis •Set design Dido Gogou •Lighting Eleni Choumou •Cast Eleni Rantou, Cem Yiğit Üzümoğlu, Gary Salomon, Giorgos Katsis, Konstantinos Moraitis •ExecutiveProduction Management Zoe Mouschi\n\nCo-funded by Greece and the European Union\n\nPEIRAIOS 260 E – DANCE\n\n19 – 21 July\n\nCHARA KOTSALI\n\nBorborygmi\n\nWhereas noise in Western society alludes to something negative, the new work of up-and-coming choreographer Chara Kotsali explores the beneficial power of noise in the way to generate joy, solidarity, and a sense of community. Two bodies on stage, a potential extension of an endless human chain, engage in an unproductive dance, in a counter-concert dedicated to the pleasure of disintegration. Setting off from the political, anthropological, and philosophical aspects of noise and drawing inspiration from the noise music scene, Chara Kotsali invites us to attentively listen to the ‘noisy social bodies’ –those that disrupt the harmony of social consensus. Using noise as an artistic counterexample, the choreographer pays respects to all those noisy – cacophonous, incoherent, paradoxical, discordant, illiterate – voices that, no matter how powerfully articulated, in the end, must always make too much ‘noise’ to be heard.\n\nChara Kotsali was selected this year by the international dance platform Aerowaves as one of the 20 most promising young creatives of the year. Her first work to be possessed is currently touring all over Europe.\n\nConcept – Choreography– Text– Videoediting – Scenic DesignChara Kotsali • Performance – MaterialDesign Christina Skoutela, Chara Kotsali • Assistant to the Choreographer Vassia Zorbali • Dramaturgy Advisor Konstantina Georgelou • Music – SoundDesign Yannis Kotsonis • Lighting DesignEliza Alexandropoulou • Sound AdvisorBrian Coon •Visual Art DesignPeriklis Pravitas• CostumesErik Annerborn, Chara Kotsali • Artistic & Scientific Collaborators Giorgos Samantas, Dimitris Bourzoukos• ExecutiveProduction Delta Pi\n\nSYCHRONO THEATRO–THEATRE\n\n20 – 22July\n\nZOE CHATZIANTONIOU\n\nAmalia melancholia, Queen of the Palm Trees\n\nA living exhibit of natural and political history\n\nIf she were a plant, she would be called Amalia melancholia. She wished that history would give her the title of Queen of the Palm Trees. A play about the woman who was stigmatized for her childlessness but gave Athens its National Garden.\n\nModern medical studies attribute Amalia’s infertility to unknown aplasia, which, if known at the time, would have made the first queen of Greece a monster, a bad omen for the great reboot of the state. She was subjected to fertility treatments for sixteen years, and after death to an autopsy. The examination of the fifty-six-year-old woman revealed findings which had to be suppressed.\n\nHer failure to offer a child to the people had political implications. However, from Amalia’s vision, a ‘child’ was indeed born: a garden. Although many busts of illustrious men are found in the garden, there is not a single official reference to this day to the woman who dreamt of the garden and made it come true.\n\nZoe Chatziantoniou draws material from Amalia’s letters to her father, individual historical testimonies, and the confidential documents of the doctors. Her Amalia is a woman between fiction and history, infertility and fertility, museum exhibit and animal under observation for breeding purposes. She is a body in a state of creative melancholy that finds its own line of flight towards another dimension beyond social imperatives. There, in her true kingdom, Amalia fulfils her mission and perpetuates her species – she becomes a Garden. She is given what she herself truly longed for, the title of Queen of the Palm Trees.\n\nResearch – Dramaturgy – Direction Zoe Chatziantoniou • Cast Emily Koliandri, Rita Lytou •Stage design Eva Manidaki•Costumes Ioanna Tsami •Music – Soundscape Stavros Gasparatosin collaboration with Georgios Mizithras •Video Pantelis Makkas •Dramaturgy Advisor Louisa Arkoumanea •Assistant to the Stage Designer Maria Kalofouti •Wigs Konstantinos Savvakis •Stage and Props ManagerDina Debebe •Rigger Yannis Psarros •Production Manager Konstantina Angeletou •ExecutiveProduction Lykofos\n\nThe performance premiered in 2022 in the Municipal Theatre of Piraeus.\n\nPEIRAIOS 260 D –THEATRE\n\n23 – 25 July\n\nARGYRO CHIOTI\n\nPoint of Refreshment\n\nCan we reverse our view of the world for a moment? See beyond the world of matter? A special place on the border between myth and reality, inhabited by fantasies and ghosts, is invited to be discovered by the polyphonic composition created for the Festival by Argyro Chioti, with a mixed group of performers, consisting of actors, dancers, and singers.\n\nMetaphysical stories and legends inspire a narrative that claims a return to myth. On stage, an existential place of ‘refreshment’ is generated. A place where souls gather to quench their thirst, amidst visions and spirits of nature, questioning the relationship between the individual and the collective.\n\nDirection Argyro Chioti •Stage design Eva Manidaki•Costumes Angelos Mentis •Music Jan Van Angelopoulos, Dimitra Trypanis•Lighting Eliza Alexandropoulou •Dramaturgy Argyro Chioti, EfthimisTheou, and the team •Assistant to the Director Nefeli Gioti •Cast (in alphabetical order) Georgina Chryskioti, Amalia Kosma, Giorgos Kritharas, Rita Lytou, Evi Saoulidou, Drossos Skotis, Nikos Ziaziaris, and special guests each night •ExecutiveProduction Maria Dourou | VASISTAS\n\nCo-funded by Greece and the European Union\n\nPEIRAIOS 260 H –THEATRE RERUN\n\n24 & 25 July\n\nMARIO BANUSHI\n\nTaverna Miresia–Mario, Bella, Anastasia\n\nOne of the most successful performances of the 2023 artistic programme, Taverna Miresia* – Mario, Bella, Anastasia, returns to Peiraios 260.\n\nAn up-and-coming young artist, born in 1998, the Albanian-born Mario Banushi uses his own memories as dramaturgical means and transforms them into a ritual of purification.\n\nA neon restaurant sign in a Tirana suburb sheds light to the history of a family. An unexpected incident under the light of this sign has a crucial effect on Mario’s life. Years later, now an adult, director Mario Banushi, who had been traveling from Greece to Albania for years to meet his family and return to the family taverna, now carries that same sign from Tirana to Athens, placing it at the center of the world he creates on stage. Through a performance, he welcomes his memories and nostalgia in order to confront the absence of his father who recently passed away; the cook and taverna owner who used to welcome customers every night.\n\nAs the performance unfolds, the sign unfurls a series of emotions, a melody of unspoken sentiments, fragments and memories, the poetry of things left unsaid. It embodies a profound farewell to the father, the custodian of the taverna’s secrets, and a warm embrace of adulthood, amidst the existential riddles that accompany the passage of years.\n\n* Miresia is Albanian for kindness\n\nConceived and directed by Mario Banushi • Set – Costumes design Sotiris Melanos • Lighting design Eliza Alexandropoulou • Music Jeph Vanger • Vocals improvisation Savina Yannatou • Associate Dramaturg Aspasia-Maria Alexiou • Assistant to the Director Sofia Antoniou • Assistant to the Costume Designer VassianaSkopetea • Cast (in alphabetical order) Mario Banushi, Savina Giannatou, Katerina Kristo, Eftychia Stefanou, Chryssi Vidalaki • Management – Executive Production TooFarEast • In collaboration with Theatrosti Sala\n\nPEIRAIOS 260 E–DANCE– GREECE / FRANCE\n\nINTERNATIONAL CO-PRODUCTION\n\n23 – 25 July\n\nKATERINA ANDREOU\n\nBless This Mess\n\nWinner of the European Prix Jardin d’Europe 2016, with a significant career in the European dance scene and loyal fans in Greece, the international Greek choreographer, dancer and musician Katerina Andreou, returns to the Festival with a performance supported by some of the most prestigious institutions of contemporary cultural production, theatres, and festivals.\n\nIn an attempt to regain strength but also a space of confidence for indispensable resistance, Katerina Andreou asks herself the question: how can confusion be turned into a tool, a strategy for creation? Bless This Mess, Andreou’s first group piece, expresses a person’s dynamic and irrepressible desire to move with others in order to find a stability of position, a voice that gives courage and energy, a sense of togetherness against chaos and isolation. This work leaves room for play that makes moments of relief and joy emerge.\n\nConception – ChoreographyKaterina Andreou •Cast Katerina Andreou, Baptiste Cazaux, Melissa Guex, Lily Brieu Nguyen •Sound conception – CreationKaterina Andreou in collaboration withCristián Sotomayor •Sound – LightingYannick Fouassier•DramaturgyAssistant Kostas Kekis•TechnicalDirectorThomas Roulleau Gallais •Production Manager Elodie Perrin •Thanks to Jean-Baptiste Veyret-Logerias, Laura Garnier • Production BARK•Co-production Kunstenfestivaldesarts Bruxelles, Festival d’Automne à Paris, Théâtrede Gennevilliers, KLAP Maison pour la danse à Marseille, Maison de la Danse, CCN de Caen en Normandie, Next Festival, les Subs Lyon, ICI • CCN Montpellier Occitanie, CCN de Grenoble, CCNR, Centre chorégraphique national de Rillieux-la-Pape, ADC Genève • ResidencyEspace Pasolini, Kunstencentrum BUDA • With the support of Dance Reflections by Van Cleef & Arpels, Mécénat de la Caisse des Dépôts, DRAC Rhône Alpes\n\nThe performance was created in part at The Watermill Center– ALaboratory for Performance in April 2023.\n\n23 JulyPost-show talk with the artists.\n\nPEIRAIOS 260 B – THEATRE\n\n23 – 25 July\n\nYOLANDA MARKOPOULOU – STATIONATHENS GROUP\n\nConnection Error\n\nIs there a point where real life meets the digital self and the performing arts? The Station Athens group, founded in 2009 in the multicultural neighbourhood of Metaxourgeio, consists of refugees and immigrants from Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. Based on their own true stories, their performances have won over the audience for the way they bring documentary and fiction together. Their new production focuses on marriage, family, and companionship, humorously highlighting the catalytic role of technological development in transforming family ties.\n\nThe members of the group try to cope with life away from the family home with the help of technology. What they have in common is the need to find solutions that will make their everyday lives easier. Having tried everything, they turn to an artificial intelligence application.They follow its advice with sometimes hilarious and even paradoxical outcomes. To what extent can technology transform our lives for the better? The show uses AI technology, video projections, and a unique sound design in a hybrid performance idiom.\n\nConceived and directed by Yolanda Markopoulou •Set design – CostumesAlexandra Siafkou, Aristotelis Karananos•Artistic Collaborator in Dramaturgy Margarita Papadopoulou •Artistic Collaborator in Research Konstantina Georgiou •Lighting Angelos Papadopoulos • Video Design Angelos Papadopoulos, Yolanda Markopoulou •Music Composition andSound Design Manolis Manousakis •Cast Chalil Alizada, Ηossein Amiri, Sakina Hashimi, Aidim Joymal, Ramzan Mohammad, Reza Mohammadi, Mahboubeh Tavakali•Executive Production POLYPLANITY Productions / Vicky Strataki, Nikos Charalampidis\n\nSubset Festival\n\nNewMusic Festival at the Athens Conservatoire\n\n10 – 14June\n\nCurated by Stavros Gasparatos\n\nIn co-production with the Athens Conservatoire\n\nThe Subset Festival, the multifaceted music platform launched last year, held by the Athens Epidaurus Festival in co-production with the Athens Conservatoire, returns refreshed but always with a focus on the dialogue between contemporary music and new media.\n\nNamed after a mathematical term (subset ⊆), the Subset Festival together diverse versions of contemporary musical creation, incorporating a wide variety of artistic trends. From 10 to 14 June, the renovated Conservatoire venues will host musical ensembles and soloists, established and up-and-coming alike, both from Greece and around the world, visual and sound installations and performances, as well as open call workshops.\n\nThe Subset Festival includes commissions to contemporary Greek ensembles and artists (Andys Skordis, Nefeli Stamatogiannopoulou, Evi Nakou,Vassoula Delli, George Kokkinaris, Thanos Polymeneas, MIZI, Alexandros Drymonitis, Magda Lampropoulou, Dimitra Kousteridou, Giorgos Poulios) who create seven new works-installations especially for the Festival. Other participants comprise renowned contemporary music ensembles and artists from Greece (Jannis Anastasakis and Natalia Manda) and abroad (Arve Henriksen, Raed Yassin, Laurel Halo, Klara Lewis, Nik Colk Void, Pedro Maia, Ben Frost, as well as SolistensembleKaleidoskop for the world premiere of Maya Dunietz’s new work). The highlight of the Festival –which is becoming a valuable locus of artistic dialogue for the international music community– will be the screening of Ryuichi Sakamoto: Opus directed by the Japanese-American filmmaker Neo Sora who recorded the final solo piano performance of its namesake composer and musician prior to his death.\n\nProgramme\n\n10 June\n\nAMPHITHEATRE 20:30\n\nKLARA LEWIS & NIK COLK VOID GREEK DEBUT\n\nLive visuals PEDRO MAIA\n\nKlara Lewis and Nik Colk Void have presented their work at numerous international festivals and venues, including the Semibreve Festival (Portugal), Dark MoFo (Tasmania), the Ultima Festival at Henie Onstad Art Centre (Oslo), the L.E.V. Festival (Gijon), the Conflux Festival (Rotterdam), the Donau Festival (Austria), and the Sonar Festival (Barcelona). In this collaboration, Lewis and Void’s unique approaches meet in a playful collage of Pop and Noise with guitars, synths, Eurorack modular systems, voice, sampling, and outboard processing intertwining their own distinct versions of tender techno and brutal ambient.This live presentation is accompanied by the Pedro Maia’s live visuals.\n\nARVE HENRIKSEN & JANNIS ANASTASAKIS\n\nLive visuals NATALIA MANTA\n\nThe acclaimed Norwegian trumpeter and composer Arve Henriksen (trumpet, vocals, electronics) meets the innovative performer Jannis Anastasakis (electric guitar, analogue synthesizer, musical saw, live-electronics).\n\nThe two have collaborated on stage before in 2014 (six d.o.g.s) and 2018 (Anglican Church). They are currently working on their first album together, which will be completed in 2024. Their concert will be visually curated by the much-admired sculptor and visual artist Natalia Manta with live analogue and digital visuals.\n\nARTS LOUNGE 22:00\n\nRAED YASSIN\n\nPhantom Orchestra\n\nThe Phantom Orchestra by the Lebanese artist Raed Yassin, distinguished in both visual arts and music, is a collective project that captures and archives a special musical moment in recent history: the solitarily developed sounds of experimental improvisers in isolation due to the not long past pandemic restrictions. The ‘outturns’ are performed, recorded, pressed onto vinyl records, and then played simultaneously, as if by some sort of a turntable orchestra –the disassociated sounds are heard together and rejoin. A project imitating the present; after having emerged from isolation, we are learning how to coexist anew.\n\n11 June\n\nAMPHITHEATRE 20:30\n\nANDYS SKORDIS\n\n«β»COMMISSIONED\n\n«β», a commission by Subset to Cypriot contemporary music composer Andys Skordis, is a multidisciplinary performance by four musicians, a conductor, electronics, and a VJ in live creation. The music is arranged as a cycle of seven pieces –the four longer ones being separated with short electronic pieces/interludes. The work is defined by the music, lights, text, and moving images as a ritual that unfolds in three stages: preparation – event – catharsis.\n\nIn the live video performance, the composer collaborates with Elia Kalogianni who creates the work’s visual context.\n\nNEW STAGE 22:00\n\nON OFF ENSEMBLE – NEFELISTAMATOGIANNOPOULOU\n\nIso – thebird. Opus IICOMMISSIONED\n\nRevisiting earlier work, the composer Nefeli Stamatogiannopoulou presents, especially for Subset, Iso – thebird. Opus II, a musical experiment that recreates real-life conditions, is written for eight speakers, recorded material, visuals, flute, birbynė, percussion, Rhodes piano, vocals, viola, double bass, and a conductor. In this musical and stagecomposition, starring Iso, a bird that lived in a cage, the artist takes the relationship between sound composition, movement, and dramaturgy of sound further to a singularly ambient and cinematic approach.\n\nMusic –Stagecomposition –ConceptNefeli Stamatogiannopoulou• Poster &VisualsPeriklis Agianozoglou• Live Sound Material Manipulation Philippos Theocharidis• Costume Design Margarita Dosoula•Outside Eye Angelos Mastrantonis•On stage Eirini Sgouridouflute (night / day), Rafal Habelbirbynė(noise / silence), Justine Goussot Rhodes piano(future / past), Haris Pazaroulasdouble bass (darkness / light), Iakovos Pavlopoulospercussion (Time: the Bell), Nefeli Stamatogiannopoulou (Conducting)\n\nGIORGOS POULIOS\n\ntrespassing COMMISSIONED\n\nGiorgos Poulios has written music for dozens of theatrical and dance theatre performances of artists such as Euripides Laskaridis, Dimitris Papaioannou, Christos Papadopoulos, Roula Pateraki, Katerina Evangelatos, and Dimitris Karantzas, while his musical oeuvre is presented in concerts, theatres, and festivals around the globe since 2004.\n\nInspired by his collaborations in both Theatre and Dance, the self-taught composer and musician showcases a solo concert-performance as part of the Subset Festival’s programme. On stage, between a sewing machine and a steam press, he attempts to retrace his primary musical references, conveying the beauty in combining disparate elements.\n\n12 June\n\nAMPHITHEATRE 20:30\n\nSOLISTENENSEMBLE KALEIDOSCOPE & MAYA DUNIETZ\n\nSound of Difference GREEK DEBUT / WORLD PREMIERE\n\nFounded in 2006 in Berlin, SolistenensembleKaleidoskophas since been dedicated to developing new forms of experimental music theatre. With an open mindset, the ensemble creates new formats of collaboration with international artists from other music genres and scenes.\n\nThey will be performing composer Maya Dunietz’s work which brings to the fore a throbbing musical universe where ghost notes make their appearance. Slow gestures. Long structures. Waves of pitches sliding up and down in a constant dance and an infinite search for equilibrium.\n\nNEW STAGE 22:00\n\nALEXANDROS DRYMONITISfeat. ARTEFACTS ENSEMBLE\n\nTechno unpluggedCOMMISSIONED\n\nA performance of live acoustic techno, code, and artificial intelligence. Programmer Alexandros Drymonitis writes live music scores through code writing and invites the ARTéfacts ensemble musicians to play techno with acoustic instruments! He interacts with an AI model, prompting it to compose, producing techno musical phrases, while the AI controls the lighting, creating an ambience that matches the music being developed. The live code and the overall musical score are projected onto a screen while the audience navigates around the musicians, and even gets to dance!\n\nAlexandros Drymonitislive coding •Dimitris Tigkaselectric double bass • Kostas Seremetispercussion • Guido De Flaviissaxophone• Spyros TzekosBass clarinet\n\n13 June\n\nAMPHITHEATRE 20:30\n\nEVI NAKOU & VASSULA DELLI\n\nWe habitually maintain\n\nWe habitually maintain is a work about the automated ways that link architecture, sound, and the labour of maintenance in basement spaces and the human bodies. Field recordings of machinery, live and processed sound, and non-verbal sounds produce a score performed by musicians Evi Nakou and Vassula Delli: a sonic and textual composition about the unseen and unheard machine and human labour that ‘maintain’ us so that we keep on going about our lives.\n\nConcept Evi Nakou •Composition, performance Evi Nakou, Vassula Delli •Sound consultant / collaborator Aris Ntelitheos\n\nLAUREL HALO with LEILA BORDREUIL\n\nAtlas\n\nAmerican composer and pianist Laurel Halo is based in Los Angeles. Her first album Quarantine, released on Hyperdub in 2012, was announced album of the year by ‘The Wire’. At the Subset Festival,alongside Leila Bordreuil on cello, she will be performing Atlas, her new album with which she has been touring the world’s biggest festivals andconcert halls since late 2023.\n\nNEW STAGE 22:00\n\nMAGDA LAMPROPOULOU – DIMITRA KOUSTERIDOU\n\nTwistCOMMISSIONED\n\nTwist is a performance that combines the analogue sound of sculptural constructions by Magda Lampropoulou with DIY electronic circuits and live-electronics techniques by Dimitra Kousteridou. Small manual and mechanical sculptures-constructions of objects and shapes with a feminine accent are twisting and turning in a synchronised dance. Light exercises in balancing between the fragile nature of materials, such as glass, ceramics, paper, fabric, and the tenuous dynamics of their sounds.\n\nCombining electroacoustic processes in real time, Dimitra Kousteridou gives a live performance where the unpredictable acoustic events and the gestures involved in the making of the installation are amplified by expanded timbre, time, and splicing techniques in drone layers of sound.\n\nTwist in situ sound installation\n\nThe performance is accompanied by an in-situ sound installation, especially designed for the Subset Festival by Magda Lampropoulou, open to the public from 10 to 14 June at the Arts Lounge. Participants navigate among floating ever-changing in shape and sound sculptures, which they can freely touch and are thus led to discovering diverse qualities of sounds emanating from physical contact with the outer shell of metal and paper surfaces and their unseen inner elements as well.\n\nKOKKINARIS – MIZI – POLYMENEAS\n\nMAZA COMMISSIONED\n\nGeorge Kokkinaris, MIZI, and Thanos Polymeneas present MAZA. A specially designed and curated sonic experience for Subset and the New Stage at the Athens Conservatoire. The concert venue will be immersed in a dense sonic atmosphere featuring two amplified double basses, a custom feedback double bass, a digital system of 256 pure tones, and a halldorophone, all diffused through an 8-channel speaker arrangement.\n\nThe strong amplification of the acoustic instruments will provide a hyperrealistic sonic experience, allowing the listener to hear every single microsound produced by the strings, fretboard, bow, and body of the instrument.\n\nBased on just-intonation tuning, the combination of the double basses’ sonorities and the pure tones produces an otherworldly soundscape. Utilising event and graphic scores alongside improvisational elements, the ensemble explores the boundaries of audibility, psychoacoustic phenomena, microtonal harmonies, and complex spectral masses.\n\nThe three artists invite the audience to immerse themselves in the sonic environment, experiencing phantom tones, sonic continuums, fluctuating harmonic formations, microsounds at the threshold of audibility, and the spatial patterns of all these sound structures within the space of the New Stage.\n\nGiorgos Kokkinarisdouble bass, feedback double bass •MIZI (Giorgos Mizithras) electronics•Thanos Polymeneas-Liontirisdouble bass, halldorophone\n\n14 June\n\nAMPHITHEATRE, 20:30\n\nFILM SCREENING\n\nRyuichi Sakamoto: Opus"
