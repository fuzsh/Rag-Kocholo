It's first place, it is very important,\" Serbia's deputy chef de mission Branislav Jevtic said.\n\nJevtic did not provide specific details about the protest but the complaint was believed to be over whether the timing system worked properly and whether the Serbian touched the wall first.\n\nFINA, the sport's world governing body, would not immediately comment but scheduled a press conference for later on Saturday.\n\nCavic said he would prefer the protest was dropped.\n\n\"If it was up to me I would drop the protest, I didn't want to fight it,\" he said.\n\n\"As we all know, technology is imperfect, it's possible (it malfunctioned).\"\n\nAugust 16, 2008\n\nRussia's Borchin win men's 20km walk\n\nValeriy Borchin clocked the fastest time to win gold in the men's 20km Walk at the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games on Saturday.\n\nHis time of 1 hour 19:01 minutes put him ahead of Jefferson Perez of Ecuador by 0.14 seconds.\n\nThe bronze medal went to Jared Tallent of Australia, who finished in 1 hour 19:42 minutes.\n\nAugust 16, 2008\n\nRebecca Adlington sinks oldest world swimming record\n\nBritain's Rebecca Adlington broke the oldest world record in swimming to win the women's 800 metres freestyle gold medal at the Beijing Olympics on Saturday.\n\nAdlington, 19, cruised to the gold medal in eight minutes 14.10 seconds to slash 2.12 seconds off the old mark of 8:16.22 set by American Janet Evans in Tokyo in 1989.\n\nItalian Alessia Filippi finished a distant second in 8:20.23 to collect the silver while Denmark's Lotte Friis was third in 8:23.03 to get the bronze.\n\nAdlington, 19, also won the 400 freestyle final earlier in the week to end Britain's 20-year drought for an Olympic swimming champion. It was also the first win by a British female swimmer since 1960.\n\nAugust 16, 2008\n\nPhelps equals Spitz's 1972 Olympic feat\n\nMichael Phelps matched fellow-American swimmer Mark Spitz's 1972 record of seven golds in one Games on Saturday with yet another victory in the pool.\n\nGuaranteeing his status as the face of the Beijing 2008 Olympics, the 23-year-old Phelps powered to victory in the 100 metres butterfly in front of an ecstatic crowd in the Water Cube with just one hundredth of a second to spare.\n\nThe 23-year-old phenomenon now has 13 career golds, four more than anyone else. As well as Olympic glory, Saturday's win brings him a $1 million bonus from sponsors.\n\nAugust 16, 2008\n\nGonzalez sets up final with Nadal\n\nJames Blake blew his gold medal chance in the men's singles on Friday, then accused Chile's Fernando Gonzalez of trampling over the Olympic ideals.\n\nGonzalez set up a men's singles final against Spain's Rafael Nadal, saving three match points on his way to a 4-6, 7-5, 11-9 victory, but promptly came under fire from the angry American.\n\nThere was no bad blood to spice second seed Nadal's late night blockbuster with Serbia's Novak Djokovic. The two warriors produced a semi-final of rare quality which Nadal took 6-4, 1-6, 6-4 when his weary opponent blazed an easy smash out.\n\nThe 28-year-old's grievance stemmed from an incident when he led 9-8 in the decider. He hit a forehand just over the baseline but was convinced the ball had shaved Gonzalez's racket frame as the Chilean took evasive action.\n\nTelevision replays seemed to suggest he was correct.\n\n\"Playing in the Olympics, in what's supposed to be considered a gentleman's sport, that's a time to call it on yourself,\" Blake told reporters.\n\n\"Fernando looked me square in the eye and didn't call it. Maybe I shouldn't expect people to hold themselves to high standards of sportsmanship. But yes, I did expect it a little more so in the Olympics.\"\n\nAugust 16, 2008\n\nFederer bounces back in doubles\n\nRoger Federer bounced back from his dismal singles defeat to sweep into the finals of the Olympic doubles on Friday with a stunning victory over the top-seeded Bryan brothers from the United States.\n\nFederer, serving superbly and constantly attacking at the net, combined with fellow Swiss Stanislaw Wawrinka for a 7-6, 6-4 victory that could give him the gold that has eluded him in a glittering career.\n\nPlaying on a sun-kissed court after their match had to be postponed on Thursday due to torrential rain, Federer and Wawrinka first scored an impressive 6-2, 6-4 win over India's Mahesh Bhupathi and Leander Paes.\n\nAugust 16, 2008\n\nCoventry takes backstroke gold\n\nZimbabwe's Kirsty Coventry won the women's 200 meters backstroke on Saturday with a new world record time of 2:05.24s to defend her Olympic title.\n\nCoventry, who had won three silvers already in Beijing, led throughout and was nearly a full second ahead of Margaret Hoelzer of the United States who took silver.\n\nJapan's Reiko Nakamura took the bronze medal.\n\nCoventry's time was 0.85 faster than the previous world record time set by Hoelzer at the U.S trials in Omaha in July.\n\nAugust 16, 2008\n\nBrazil's Filho Cielo takes gold in men's 50m Freestyle\n\nBrazilian Cesar Filho Cielo claimed gold in the men's 50m Freestyle with a time of 21.30 seconds on Saturday.\n\nFrance's Amaury Leveaux (21.45) and Alain Bernard (21.49) touched in second and third.\n\nWorld record holder Eamon Sullivan of Australia finished sixth in 21.65s."
