This time he is set to direct one of Puccini’s most popular masterworks, Madama Butterfly, on the stage of the Odeon of Herodes Atticus. Idiosyncratic aspects of the Japanese musical tradition, climaxes, chamber music qualities and outbursts alongside the entire orchestra lend Butterfly its unique character and breathe a special life into it. The production is realized with support from the Stavros Niarchos Foundation, aiming to enhance the GNO’s artistic outreach.\n\nConductor Vassilis Christopoulos • Directed by Olivier Py • Set and costume design Pierre-André Weitz • Lighting design Bertrand Killy • Chorus master Agathangelos Georgakatos • Cast Cellia Costea (Cio-Cio San), Alisa Kolosova (Suzuki), Andrea Carè (B.

Throughout her long-running career, the German virtuoso, who started out under the wing of Herbert von Karajan, has performed at every prestigious concert hall around the world and left her mark on classical music. She has received numerous international accolades for her recordings, including four Grammy Awards.\n\nThe major violinist will be joined by a string ensemble consisting of current and former fellows of the Anne-Sophie Mutter Foundation as well as other selected young musicians. Under Mutter’s artistic leadership, Mutter’s Virtuosi have been steadily accompanying their mentor in concerts across the globe since 2011.\n\nAt the Odeon concert, the world-class violinist will perform solo in three concertos and also in André Previn’s Nonet, a chamber music work for nine instruments that was dedicated to her and will be presented in Greece for the very first time. Mutter herself will conduct the concert.\n\nAntonio Vivaldi (1678-1741)\n\nConcerto in F major for 3 violins, strings, and continuo, RV 551\n\nJohann Sebastian Bach (1685-1750)\n\nViolin Concerto in A minor, BWV 1041\n\nAndré Previn (1929–2019)\n\nNonet Greek premiere\n\nJ.S. Bach\n\nBrandenburg Concerto No.3 in G major, BWV 1048\n\nJoseph Bologne, Chevalier de Saint-Georges (1745-1799)\n\nViolin Concerto in C major, Op. 5, No. 2\n\nViolin & Artistic Direction Anne-Sophie Mutter\n\nCLASSICAL MUSIC\n\n15 June\n\nUTOPIA ORCHESTRA – TEODOR CURRENTZIS\n\nSymphony No. 3 by Gustav Mahler\n\nPodium star Teodor Currentzis will perform alongside his new artistic project, Utopia Orchestra, an international ensemble consisting of major world-renowned soloists.\n\nBorn in Athens in 1972, the distinguished Greek conductor learned his craft under the legendary Ilya Mushin at the Saint Petersburg State Conservatory from 1994 to 1999. In 2004, he founded musicAeterna Orchestra and Choir in Novosibirsk, with whom he took Europe’s music capitals by storm. In 2018, he was appointed chief conductor of the Stuttgart Radio Symphony Orchestra. In the meantime, he keeps performing at all major festivals, collaborating with the greatest directors and garnering international awards for his recordings. Gifted and unconventional, he occupies a prominent place in classical music thanks to his brilliant performances, which invariably evoke powerful emotions in his audience.\n\nAt the Odeon concert, the famous maestro will conduct the Utopia Orchestra in Mahler’s majestic Symphony No. 3. Composed in the summers of 1895 and 1896, the gigantic Symphony No. 3 (six movements with a total running time of over 90 minutes) constitutes Mahler’s sublime celebration of Nature and the elemental forces of beings as they strive to merge with God. For the composer, mutual love is tantamount to the most admirable desire of existence, elevating humankind far above their perishable and painful condition. In the fourth part, “Zarathustra’s roundelay”, performed by the mezzo-soprano, Mahler wonders about the meaning of life and the possibility of joy. In the fifth movement, childish voices narrate an angelic “sweet song, with blessed joy it rang in heaven”. The Adagio, in the conclusion, soothing in its splendour despite its solemn passages, provides a response to the previous agonizing questions and leads the work to its redemptive finale.\n\nGustav Mahler (1860-1911)\n\nSymphony No. 3 in D minor\n\n*\n\nOPERA GALA\n\n17 June\n\nROBERTO ALAGNA & ALEKSANDRA KURZAK\n\nCITY OF ATHENS SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA\n\nNAYDEN TODOROV\n\nMaria Callas Year\n\nThe year 2023 has been declared Maria Callas Year by UNESCO. On the occasion of the celebration for the 100th birthday of the 20th-century’s greatest soprano, the Maria Callas Greek Society holds a concert featuring internationally acclaimed tenor Roberto Alagna and famous soprano Aleksandra Kurzak. The popular artists will join their voices in arias and duets immortalized by Maria Callas’ rich voice and distinctive timbre, under the baton of conductor Nayden Todorov, director of the Sofia Philharmonic Orchestra. The total proceeds of the concert will go to the creation of the Maria Callas Museum, which will be dedicated to the iconic Greek soprano. The artists are joined by the City of Athens Symphony Orchestra.\n\nThe concert is held under the Auspices of the City of Athens and the Hellenic Ministry of Culture and Sports.\n\n*\n\nGREEK MUSIC\n\n18 June\n\nSTAVROS XARCHAKOS\n\nOne of the great masters of Greek music, inextricably linked to the artistic expression of our collective adventure as a nation from the 1960s to this day, Stavros Xarchakos draws on the power of songs, which, as he notes, “show us the way, they are our allies in our struggle for a better life, and also drive our fears away. Love is a revolution; for humans, the eternal Holy Grail is Freedom!”.\n\nSongs such as “Ta Pseftika ta Logia ta Megala” [Fake Big Words] will lead to “Kaisariani”, Iakovos Kambanellis’ “To Megalo mas Tsirko” [Our Great Circus] and Manos Eleftheriou’s “Ithaki” [Ithaca]. We will all come together in “Stis Akropolis ta Meri” [In the Acropolis Neighbourhood], guided by beloved performers: Maria Farantouri, Yiannis Kotsiras and Iro Saia.\n\nOrchestra conductor Stavros Xarchakos • Performers Maria Farantouri, Yiannis Kotsiras, Iro Saia • Narrator Xenofon Rarakos • Co-production Athens Epidaurus Festival, Cricos Productions\n\n*\n\nCONTEMPORARY MUSIC\n\n19 June\n\nJOHN CALE & BAND\n\nATHENS PHILHARMONIA ORCHESTRA\n\nFrom Velvet Underground to Mercy\n\nFt. orchestra & immersive visuals\n\nJohn Cale, the Welsh musician who made history with the Velvet Underground, will perform at the Odeon of Herodes Atticus: a musical journey through a career spanning six decades, with plenty of classic material as well as songs from his newest album Mercy, which has received glowing reviews from the international music press. Composer, singer, songwriter and record producer of rock, drone, classical, avant-garde and electronic music, Cale and Lou Reed, with Andy Warhol as their manager and Nico as a muse of sorts, founded the Velvet Underground, one of the most beloved avant-garde bands of all time. In 1996, Cale was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. He has also been appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire. A student of Iannis Xenakis and John Cage, close friend and collaborator of Brian Eno, with over 20 solo albums under his belt, Cale is also the producer who discovered iconic figures of rock music, including, but not limited to, Patti Smith, Iggy Pop, Squeeze and Jonathan Richman.\n\nJoining him on the stage are the Athens Philharmonia Orchestra and, of course, his band, presenting a performance specially conceived for the monument, an exclusive world premiere featuring orchestra and immersive visuals.\n\nProduction Supernova Productions\n\n*\n\nCLASSICAL MUSIC\n\nGREEK ORCHESTRAS\n\n21 June – WORLD MUSIC DAY\n\nERT NATIONAL SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA\n\nKATIA & MARIELLE LABÈQUE\n\nCHRISTOS CHOMENIDIS\n\nDIONYSIOS DERVIS-BOURNIAS\n\nDIONYSIOS SOURBIS\n\nWorks by Saint-Saëns, Pécou / Savvopoulos, Bizet\n\nOnce again this year, the ERT National Symphony Orchestra and the Athens Epidaurus Festival celebrate the World Music Day or Fête de la musique, holding a big concert, with free admission, at the Odeon of Herodes Atticus. In the first part of the evening, the orchestra will perform Camille Saint-Saëns’ delightful Le Carnaval des animaux (1886), which contains references to Mendelssohn, Berlioz and Offenbach, and is based on humorous improvisations whose students encouraged him to write down. The performance of this extremely popular, for grown-ups and kid alike, work is accompanied by a reading from author Christos Chomenidis, shedding light to it through an original text written specifically for this concert. In the second part, the mood shifts completely, as one of the greatest composers of our time, Thierry Pécou, is in dialogue with Dionysis Savvopoulos’ Zeibekiko. Pécou continues the journey of this melody, travelling through different styles and eras, and creating a nightmarish instrumental background with references to Xenakis’ work. In the third and final part, the orchestra ends on a high note, performing two orchestral suites from Bizet’s Carmen. One of the most popular works of the world repertoire, the two suites have been recorded by some of the greatest conductors. French-Greek maestro Dionysios Dervis-Bournias conducts, while Katia and Marielle Labèque, the world-class piano duo for half a century now, perform the piano.\n\nCamille Saint-Saëns (1835-1921)\n\nLe Carnaval des animaux\n\nThierry Pécou (1965-) / Dionysis Savvopoulos (1944-)\n\nZeibekiko\n\nGeorges Bizet (1838-1875)\n\nCarmen, Suites No. 1 & No. 2\n\nConductor Dionysios Dervis-Bournias • Soloists Katia and Marielle Labèque piano • Performer Dionysios Sourbis, baritone • Reading by author Christos Chomenidis\n\n*\n\nCONTEMPORARY MUSIC\n\n22 June\n\nTHE WATERBOYS\n\nThe Waterboys have a special bond with Greek audiences. This year, they are bringing their melodies and lyricism to the Odeon of Herodes Atticus for the first time. The Waterboys were formed in Edinburgh in 1983 by Scottish musician Mike Scott. Their history is inseparable from Scott’s musical career, as he is the heart and soul of the group. Using rock’n’roll as a starting point, their early music is noted for its epic, ambitious compositions (the term big music was coined especially for them). In 1985, “The Whole of the Moon” was released, eventually becoming the signature song of the band and covered by a host of artists, from Prince and U2 to The Killers and Rod Stewart. In addition to big music, Scott, a folklore legend enthusiast, has taken the Waterboys down more folk music paths, inspired by Celtic tradition and Greek mythology, with Pan, in particular, being his favourite mythical figure. From 1983 to this day, the Waterboys have released 15 albums in total and have never stopped evolving.\n\nProduction Supernova Productions\n\n*\n\nCONTEMPORARY MUSIC\n\n23 June\n\nNILS FRAHM\n\nMusic for Athens\n\nWhen it comes to defining the space between classical and electronic music, hardly any other name is mentioned as often as that of the Berlin-based pianist, composer and producer Nils Frahm. His unconventional approach to the piano, played contemplatively and intimately, and his sonic alchemy of ambient textures and atmospheric electronica, has won him many fans around the world. Numerous tours and concerts all over the globe have strengthened his reputation as both an exceptional instrumentalist and a fascinating live musician. His albums have garnered international acclaim from critics and audiences alike, and his live shows are always sold out. This year, he will perform at the Odeon of Herodes Atticus, offering audiences an unforgettable, enchanting evening.\n\nProduction The Hub Events\n\n*\n\nCONTEMPORARY MUSIC – JAZZ SESSIONS\n\n24 June\n\nGREGORY PORTER\n\nWithin the last decade, Gregory Porter has brought contemporary jazz to the ears of thousands of people by way of his warm, baritone voice. He quickly rose to fame in 2010 with his first album, Water, a wonderful mixture of jazz, gospel and soul. Soon afterwards, critics declared him to be on the same level with iconic artists such as Nat King Cole and Stevie Wonder. He is the recipient of two Grammy Awards.\n\nOne of the most lauded performers of his generation, Porter will make his Greek debut shortly before his three scheduled concerts at London’s Royal Albert Hall.\n\nProduction Menta\n\n*\n\nGREEK MUSIC\n\n25 June\n\nELLI PASPALA\n\nThe American Songbook\n\nSpecial guest Vassilikos\n\nA journey down the American musical tradition through songs of legendary artists such as Cole Porter, George Gershwin and Leonard Bernstein as well as contemporary songwriters who defined an era and shaped the aesthetics of many generations to come, including Joni Mitchell, Leonard Cohen, Paul Simon and Prince.\n\nSongs which remain classic and timeless, plus major moments in the history of American songwriting, are masterfully performed by Elli Paspala. Born and raised in New York, she retains the culture and treasures of American music as an integral part of her performing style.\n\nPaspala is joined by a small orchestra consisting of a wind and a string quartet, alongside a group of musicians comprising some of Greece’s most accomplished soloists, led by David Lynch in saxophone, also in charge of instrumentations, Takis Farazis in piano, Petros Klampanis in double bass and Yannis Angelopoulos in drums.\n\nVassilikos, a fan-favourite of Greek audiences, will also participate, performing songs in his own, unique way, both jointly with Elli Paspala and solo.\n\nDavid Lynch tenor & soprano saxophone instrumentations, flute, percussion • Takis Farazis piano, Petros Klampanis double bass, Yannis Angelopoulos drums, Kostas Panagiotidis violin, Katerina Chatzinikolau violin, Angela Giannaki viola, Dimitris Travlos cello, Christina Pantelidou English horn & oboe, Manos Ventouras French horn, Dimitris Dakovanos bassoon, Tommy Lynch tenor & alto saxophone, vocals • Lighting design Stella Kaltsou • FOH sound engineer Yiannis Paxevanis • Stage sound engineer Panagiotis Spyropoulos • Photos – Video Vasia Anagnostopoulou • Executive production PROSPERO\n\n*\n\nCONTEMPORARY MUSIC\n\n27 June\n\nSIGUR RÓS\n\nOne of the most popular post-rock bands on the planet, the Icelandic Sigur Rós are touring with an orchestra, performing at the Odeon of Herodes Atticus and thrilling Festival audiences with their seductive soundscapes. Their lengthy, hypnotic compositions may be sung entirely in Icelandic or lack verses yet they manage to speak out in a universal musical language. Their complete discography, spearheaded by the now classic songs “Starálfur”, “Olsen Olsen” and “Svefn-g-englar”, has been warmly embraced by audiences and critics alike, while also serving as a source of inspiration for a number of post-rock bands worldwide over at least the last two decades.\n\nProduction Detox Events\n\n*\n\nCLASSICAL MUSIC\n\nGREEK ORCHESTRAS\n\n29 June\n\nATHENS STATE ORCHESTRA – LUKAS KARYTINOS\n\nRequiem by Giuseppe Verdi\n\nGiuseppe Verdi’s awe-inspiring Requiem is one of the most popular symphonic/choral works of all time. In addition to its emotionally moving musical power, what also sets it apart is its anthropocentric dimension. Verdi neither attempted to bolster faith nor stir up fear about the Judgement Day or foster hope for eternal rest. Confronted with the tragic fact of death, he wanted his music to celebrate Humans, their awe in the face of the unknown, their stance towards God, oscillating between faith and doubt. Deeply emotional, the music focuses on and expresses the mystery of the fleeting human existence, making Requiem one of the most invaluable works of the world music canon.\n\nThis year, the Athens State Orchestra celebrates the 80 years since its founding with this legendary work, under the baton of its chief conductor Lukas Karytinos. Audiences will have the opportunity to enjoy bass Alexandros Stavrakakis, the only Greek opera singer to have won First Prize at the International Tchaikovsky Competition, Finnish soprano Miina-Liisa Värelä, one of the most promising sopranos of dramatic repertoire worldwide, imposing Tunisian mezzo-soprano Rihab Chaieb and famous Grammy-nominated English-American tenor Barry Banks.\n\nGiuseppe Verdi (1813-1901)\n\nMessa da Requiem (in memory of Alessandro Manzoni) for four soloists, mixed choir and orchestra\n\nConductor Lukas Karytinos • Soloists Miina-Liisa Värelä soprano, Rihab Chaieb mezzo-soprano, Barry Banks tenor, Alexandros Stavrakakis bass • Featuring the ERT Chorus, the City of Athens Choir and the Amadeus Mixed Choir (Chorus master Svilen Simeonov) • An Athens Epidaurus Festival co-production\n\n*\n\nCONTEMPORARY MUSIC\n\n1 July\n\nALEXANDRE DESPLAT\n\nFeaturing the ERT National Symphony Orchestra\n\nWith two Academy Awards, three César Awards, three BAFTAs, two Golden Globes, two Grammy Awards and dozens of nominations to his name so far, his work enjoys an impressive official recognition. Alexandre Desplat, one of the most acclaimed contemporary film composers, was born in Paris in 1961 to a French father and a Greek mother. He turned to music from a very young age. From the late 1990s onwards, his name has been linked with soundtracks of hugely successful American and European films (The Grand Budapest Hotel, The Shape of Water, The Queen, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, The King’s Speech, The Imitation Game, to name but a few).

This July, he will make his Greek debut, mesmerizing Greek audiences, much like he has already mesmerized music lovers at the greatest stages and festivals across the globe.

His collaboration with Donald Byrd in 1960 marked his debut in the jazz music scene. Two years later, he was signed by the famous Blue Note record label. In 1963, he embarked on a five-year collaboration with Miles Davis and together they recorded several classic albums. In 1966, Hancock composed the music for Michelangelo Antonioni’s film Blow-Up, the success of which paved the road for him for a successful career in cinema.

This is what Berlioz wrote in one of his letters in 1831. He remained adamant in his belief throughout his entire life and never stopped regarding Beethoven as the absolute genius. With that in mind, the encounter of these two composers in the Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France programme is particular apt, even more so with this specific collaboration on stage. Kantorow, winner of the first prize at the International Tchaikovsky Competition in 2019, has now been established as one of the reference points for 21st-century pianists. Gardiner, on the other hand, is the conductor who has defined how we listen to Beethoven and Berlioz today as few others have.

Nabucco established Giuseppe Verdi as the greatest Italian composer of the 19th century, at the same time becoming a symbol of the struggle for the unification of Italy. Although Verdi wasn’t the first composer setting texts with strongly political character to music, Italy’s foremost composer made quite a difference with his musical brilliance. It is this brilliance that invests his operas with an acutely political dimension and has the power to rouse the crowd.\n\nLeo Muscato is one of the most dynamic, up-and-coming Italian opera directors. He has been distinguished for his work on Verdi and Puccini and staged highly successful productions at prestigious opera houses in Italy. One of the world’s leading maestros, Italian Paolo Carignani will conduct this production, marking his first collaboration with the GNO.\n\nConductor Paolo Carignani • Directed by Leo Muscato • Set design Tiziano Santi • Costume design Silvia Aymonino • Lighting design Alessandro Veraci • Chorus master Agathangelos Georgakatos • Cast Nabucco Dimitri Platanias (26/7 and 29/7), Tassis Christoyannis (27/7 and 30/7), Ismaele Yannis Christopoulos (26/7 and 29/7), Konstantinos Klironomos (27/7 and 30/7), Zaccaria Vitalij Kowaljow (26/7 and 29/7), Petros Magoulas (27/7 and 30/7), Abigaille Ekaterina Semenchuk (26/7 and 29/7), Maria Jose Siri (27/7 and 30/7), Fenena Elena Maximova (26/7 and 29/7), Marisia Papalexiou (27/7 and 30/7)\n\nWith the GNO Orchestra, Chorus and Soloists\n\n*\n\nPEIRAIOS 260 – THEATRE\n\nStarting time for all performances 21:00, unless otherwise noted\n\nGreek and English surtitles in all international theatre productions\n\nEnglish surtitles in all Greek theatre productions\n\nand Greek surtitles on opening night for persons with hearing impairment\n\ngrape\n\nIntent on systematizing the promotion and export of Greek artistic works, we have created and are launching this year a new platform for the outreach of Greek artists, an Agora for Greek Performing Arts, the GREEK AGORA OF PERFORMANCE, also known by the acronym grape. We drew inspiration for this name from Dionysus, God of Grape-Harvesting and Theatre, by the intoxication caused by Art, by the Greek summer and grapes, a fruit that is passed around – sometimes as an edible fruit, sometimes as wine – and has been linked with our passionate discussions after the end of Festival productions.\n\nPARODOS – PROLOGOS / EXODOS\n\nFocusing on the organic relationship between contemporary performing arts and Ancient Drama, the special initiatives that have been setting the Festival’s tone since 2020 will continue this year: “Parodos”, a studio residence at the Little Theatre of Ancient Epidaurus”; “Prologos”, an introduction to the artistic “language” of each performance, held in collaboration with the Master’s programme of the Department of Theatre Studies, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens; and “Exodos”, post-show talks with artists.\n\n“THE FREEDOM OF OTHERS”\n\nSeries of discussions curated by Dionysis Kapsalis\n\nOn the occasion of the 200th anniversary since Dionysios Solomos wrote “Hymn to Liberty”, this year’s Festival contemplates and invites reflection on the invaluable notion of freedom. Under the general title, “The Freedom of Others”, this series of discussions, complementary to the artistic programme, will host notable speakers of the letters, arts and the world of intellect.

Serebrennikov, former Artistic Director (2012-2021) of the famed Gogol Center in Moscow, was the only Russian director invited to a European festival (Cannes) in 2022, despite the boycott of Russian artists. He is also well-known for his LGBTQI+ activism and his conflict with the Russian regime that led to the Gogol Center shutdown in 2021. Charged with the embezzlement of public money, he was placed under house arrest and was ultimately sentenced to probation in 2020. However, in 2022, his sentence was cancelled. Nowadays, residing in Germany in self-exile, he continues to vocally oppose the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Der Wij, a performance featuring Russian, Ukrainian and German actors, each performing in their own language, encapsulates his opposition and indignation.\n\nIn a fantasy/horror novella he authored in 1835, Nikolai Gogol, the father of Russian realism, himself of Ukrainian heritage, invented a terrifying creature called Viy (“Wij” in German), taking inspiration from a Slavic folk legend. The creature was almost blind, its eyelids so long as to touch the ground; however, whenever it managed to open its eyes, it was capable of killing whomever it stared at by a single gaze. Using the Viy legend as a springboard, Serebrennikov conjures a performance of both intolerable cruelty and poetic power. Together with a young Ukrainian writer, Bohdan Pankrukhin, they began penning the stage adaptation in 2022. The duo, as he mentions in his directorial note, “read hundreds of reports and watched documentaries and videos about the war. Bucha, Mariupol, Irpin… Hell on earth. Innocent victims. Monstrous crimes. Documented evidence of barbaric acts. In this production, the Viy is war – a soulless monster with closed eyes that steals people’s identity and futures […] People kill each other and themselves”.\n\nSpectators will come to realize the cynicism of war regardless of sides; they will bear witness to a kind of hell speaking out against the total abjection of human life by means of a brutal language. The play had its premiere in Hamburg in December 2022.\n\nDirecting – Set and costume design Kirill Serebrennikov • Set design collaboration Elena Bulochnikova • Costume design Shalva Nikvashvili • Music Daniel Freitag • Choreography Ivan Estegneev, Evgeny Kulagin • Lighting design Sergei Kuchar • Artistic collaboration Anna Shalashova • Dramaturgy Matthias Günther • Translated by Kyra Heye • Casr Filipp Avdeev, Bernd Grawert, Johannes Hegemann, Pascal Houdus, Viktoria Miroshnichenko, Falk Rockstroh, Rosa Thormeyer, Oleksandr Yatsenko • Supported by Körber Stiftung, ZEIT-Stiftung, Rudolf Augstein Stiftung, Mara & Holger Cassens Stiftung, ART Connects\n\n7 June Post-show talk\n\n*\n\nPEIRAIOS 260 Β – DANCE\n\n7 – 9 June\n\nEN DYNAMEI ENSEMBLE – MICHAEL KLIËN\n\nThe Utopians\n\nIs it possible to defy the narrow constraints of our personal identity, discover and develop new fields of relationships among humans, achieve co-existence on equal terms? The Thessaloniki-based En Dynamei Ensemble, who captivated the Festival audience with the performance Horse in Love (2019), directed by Eleni Efthymiou under the artistic direction of Eleni Dimopoulou, returns to Peiraios 260 in collaboration with internationally acclaimed Viennese choreographer Michael Kliën. They are jointly presenting a social choreography piece, a choreographic landscape that is something of an experience. The social choreography, in which Klien has been specialized for several years now, is an emerging interdisciplinary field investigating the experience of socialization and highlighting possible realities capable of suggesting new ways of co-existence by means of artistic creation.\n\nThe choreographic concept is inspired by Robert Musil’s play Die Schwärmer (The Dreamers), tackling the possibility of logic and dream going hand in hand. In an empty industrial space, an environment consisting of an electroacoustic soundscape and pertinent lighting, a group of approximately fifty people with seemingly mixed abilities move around, personally marking their own trajectories. A deeply complex, collective logic generates a special condition, with the roughly two hundred spectators becoming part of the piece, aided by a group of “guides”. In this manner, from spectator, each participant becomes an active agent.\n\nChoreography Michael Kliën • Concept Michael Kliën – Steve Valk • Artistic Director of the En Dynamei Ensemble Eleni Efthymiou • Artistic collaboration Vitoria Kotsalou • Dramaturgy Steve Valk • Soundscape Volkmar Klien • Lighting design Richard Anthony Lucas • Cast En Dynamei Ensemble and friends: Zacharias Ananiadis, Richard Anthony, Klio Antonopoulou, Haris Bairaktaridis, Giorgos Zisis Bilionis, Lydia Bourtsala, Alexandros Chatsios, Vera Daliani, Maria Dachlythra, Barbara Dickinson, Michalis Dolopoulos, Stavroula Dolopoulou, Brooks Emanuel, Giorgos Gavalas, Chrysa Ioannidou, Margarita Kainada, Petri Karadimitriou, Fiona Katoikou, Angelos Konstantinou, Theano Konta, Vangelis Kosmidis, Efterpi Kosta, Elpida Kouitzoglou, Agapi Theodoridou Kounini, Nikos Kyparissis, Nikoleta Lappa, Stefanos Lentzis, Loxandra Lucas, Christina Lyra Aslanidi, Dimitris Lyras, Panagiotis Matziris, Thanos Nanasis, Marika Niko, Theano Papavassiliou, Georgia Pontsouktsi, Giorgos Poulos, Leo Rya, Charis Serdari, Nicole Schwartz • Co-production Athens Epidaurus Festival, En Dynamei Ensemble • Supported by the Austrian Embassy\n\n*\n\nPEIRAIOS 260 Η – THEATRE / REPETITION\n\n7 – 10 June\n\nGIORGOS KOUTLIS\n\nThe Dog, the Night and the Knife\n\nby Marius von Mayenburg\n\nOne of the most successful performances of last year’s programme, The Dog, the Night and the Knife is once again presented at Peiraios 260. A gory, comical nightmare; a paranoid and brutally funny parable of our absurd reality. Giorgos Koutlis, head of the Experimental Stage of the National Theatre of Greece and restless director, returns with this contemporary play by Marius von Mayenburg, the provocative Schaubühne dramatist. “M” finds himself in an abandoned cul-de-sac. He has no idea how he got there. The only thing he remembers is eating mussels. Night falls.

The Marshall Plan, the rebuilding and recovery initiative aimed at European countries, including Greece, defined US foreign policy after the end of World War II. Was this kind of restarting feasible after all? What is it that emerges from a hopeless osmosis of dissimilar groups and persons? How unexpected can the end result be under such circumstances?\n\nIn his famous report for Greece published in 1947, Paul Porter, US delegate in Greece, writes that the country was “in the grip of a gray, unrelieved, profound lack of faith in the future”. The transformation, as conceived in the context of the Marshall Plan, took four years to be completed and left behind – apart from infrastructure, agricultural and industrial projects – a taste of modernization as well as a mistrust of foreign aid and its true motives.\n\nUsing the delegate’s journal as a springboard, along with the still terribly relevant report he drew up, the performance brings to the forefront that specific era, drawing on Porter’s meetings with Greek workers and farmers, officials, people starving in cities, children and dozens of other real-life individuals. Gradually, the dramaturgy is enriched with scientific studies, historical and economic documents, combined with numerous testimonies, all of which convey the grotesque co-existence of the American ideal and the anarchic Greek spirit, by turns life-saving, dramatic and comical.\n\nIn its own way, the visual environment tells the story of how catastrophe turns into creation, how dissolution turns into organization, using music as an integral aspect. The fusion of 1940s rock’n’roll and jazz music with Greek dimotiki (traditional) music encapsulates the tension and admiration as well as the awkwardness and contradictions palpable in the confrontation of these two cultures. Text, visual space, light and music converse with historical phases of post-WWII Greece before, during and after the implementation of the Marshall Plan, investigating its prospects, successes and failures, which continue to affect us today.\n\nConcept – Directing – Lighting Natasha Triantafylli • Performance text assembled by Dimitra Mitropoulou, Natasha Triantafylli • Dramaturgical collaboration Elena Triantafyllopoulou • Costume design Eva Manidaki • Costume design Vana Giannoula • Music Μonika • Lighting collaboration Dimitris Koutas • First assistant to the director – Movement Dimitria Mitropoulou • Second assistant to the director Maria Papadouli • Assistant to the set designer Maria Kalofouti • Production manager Manolis Sardis – Pro4 • Cast (in alphabetical order) Daphne Alexander, Aris Balis, Nicolas Maraziotis, Dimitra Mitropoulou • Also featuring young Konstantinos Sardis • Video appearance by Christos Loulis\n\nWarmest thanks go to Stathis N.

He starts building a huge theatrical scenery, re-enacting scenes from the town where he grew up as well as the concentration camp where his family was murdered. His monologue, covering his entire life since his childhood, is gradually interspersed with the reconstruction of true places and events, featuring countless local villagers as extras. The village eventually becomes famous thanks to this attraction. Nevertheless, many years later it is revealed that the Polish-Jewish man was not exactly the man he claimed to be.\n\nIn his productions, internationally acclaimed, avant-garde Argentinean director Mariano Pensotti focuses on the relationship between documentary and fiction, fantasy and reality, frequently drawing on his own life or that of his collaborators. In La obra, he invokes another theatre director as his alter ego: Walid Mansour. According to the plot, Mansour comes to Argentina precisely in order to stage a performance drawing on the narratives of the villagers who participated in Simon Frank’s play, exposing how this experience affected their lives. This kaleidoscopic perspective makes us question our certainties, both on the meaning of “perpetrator” and “victim” today and on the very meaning of re-enactment.\n\nWritten and directed by Mariano Pensotti • Set design Mariana Tirantte • Music – Sound Diego Vainer • Artistic production Florencia Wasser • Video Martin Borini • Lighting design David Seldes • Stage manager – Assistant to the director Juan Francisco Reato • Dramaturgy Aljoscha Begrich • Cast Susana Pampin, Diego Velazquez, Pablo Seijo, Rami Fadel Khalaf, Horacio Acosta, Alejandra Flechner • Musician TBA • Co-production Wiener Festwochen, Athens Epidaurus Festival, Printemps des Comediéns Montpellier, Festival d’Automne à Paris\n\n14 June Post-show talk\n\n*\n\nPEIRAIOS 260 D – THEATRE\n\n14 – 18 June\n\nSTATHIS LIVATHINOS\n\nCasanova / Don Juan\n\nThe Romantic Wandering\n\nA performance built upon a poetic parallel between Lord Byron and Marina Tsvetaeva, both of whom were inspired, a century apart: the former by the mythical figure of Don Juan and the latter by the historical figure of Casanova. Byron began writing Don Juan in 1818 while in self-exile in Italy. After approaching this mythical Don Juan in a brand-new manner, he abandoned the work unfinished in 1823, as he started to become increasingly involved in the Carbonari revolutionary society and later the Greek War of Independence. About a hundred years later, in the tempestuous post-October Revolution years, Tsvetaeva wrote The End of Casanova in Moscow, last part of her play Phoenix, shortly before she departed for Berlin in self-exile.\n\nIn director Stathis Livathinos’ new production, the voices of the two great poets meet, illuminating various questions, from romantic wanderings and a constant sense of looking back to the time that passes by and fades away to the issue of exile, the other face of this wandering. Both texts were composed in turbulent times; the sense that something is coming to an end is inscribed in their core.\n\nFor this production, Livathinos collaborates with his regular team of actors, theatre researcher and translator Elsa Andrianou for the translation of Tsvetaeva’s The End of Casanova, and poet and translator Giorgos Koropoulis, translator of Byron’s Don Juan. Both of these unique classics are presented in Greek for the first time, in rhyming verse, promising us a highly creative stage work.\n\nTranslated by Elsa Andrianou (The End of Casanova by Marina Tsvetaeva), Giorgos Koropoulis (Don Juan by Lord George Gordon Byron) • Directing – Dramaturgy Stathis Livathinos • Set and costume design Eleni Manolopoulou • Music Thodoris Abazis • Lighting design Alekos Anastasiou • Sound engineer Kostis Pavlopoulos • Assistant to the director Erato Pissi • Assistant to the set design Emily Koukoutsaki • Production technical coordination Nikos Charalambidis • Cast (in alphabetical order) Vasilis Andreou, George Dampasis, Dimitris Filippidis Nikos Kardonis, Stathis Koikas, Eirini Lafazani, Lilly Meleme, Polyxeni Papakonstantinou, Maria Savvidou, Theovi Styllou, Aris Troupakis • Executive production Polyplanity Productions / Yolanda Markopoulou, Vicky Strataki\n\n15 June Post-show talk\n\n*\n\nPEIRAIOS 260 Ε – THEATRE – CYPRUS\n\n15 & 16 June\n\nSEASON WOMEN PROJECT\n\nWomen Walk Home\n\nIn 1975, one year after the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, 30,000 women silently walk towards the occupied city of Famagusta (“Ammochostos” in Greek). In 1987 and 1989, thousands of women cross the “green line” and come face to face with the occupation army. In 1988, one hundred women from Cyprus occupy the Acropolis in Athens as an act of protest. Do all these remind us of something? Does the “Women Walk Home” movement ring a bell?\n\nA performance about a story of heroics, vision, hope, cooperation for an epic achievement that has faded from our collective memory, diminished and forgotten. During the 1970s and 1980s, employing remarkable strategies, the “Women Walk Home” movement organized peaceful anti-occupation marches in Cyprus, aiming to break through the opposition line and turn the Cyprus problem into a matter of international interest.\n\nBased on authentic testimonies, presented here verbatim, this production asks us to examine the official history with a critical eye, focusing on timeless issues: the erasure of female experience from official history and the absence of a female perspective from public life.\n\nThe plot deals with the true price of this struggle on both a personal and a collective level; the tension between hope and despair, between a vision for peace and a story of violence and trauma.\n\nThe dramaturgy largely follows the historical events yet with a major twist deriving from the nature of verbatim theatre: it is in constant dialogue with the present and today’s audience.\n\nDirected by Magdalena Zira • Text Magdalena Zira, Nedi Antoniadi • Dramaturgy consultant Athina Kasiou • Set and costume design Elena Katsouri • Video design Elena Alonefti • Musical composition – Music design Antonis Antoniou • Lighting design Vasilis Petinaris • Poster Giorgos Tsagaris • Production assistant Nicola Mitropoulou • Photos Sokratis Sokratous • Technical support Achilleas Mouskis • Production SEASON Women Project • Scientific associate Dr Petros Papapolyviou, Department of History and Archaeology, University of Cyprus • Cast (in alphabetical order) Nedi Antoniadi, Niki Dragoumi, Sofia Kalli, Giola Kleitou, Zoi Kyprianou, Ioanna Papamichalopoulou\n\n*\n\nPEIRAIOS 260 PLATEA – DANCE\n\n17 & 18 June\n\nAEF Urban Dance Contest\n\nHip Hop Battle\n\nAll Styles Battle\n\nFor the third year running, the Greek hip hop and street dance scene is strongly represented in the Festival in the form of the Layers of Street thematic section. Following its two successful instalments in the last couple of years, the Athens Epidaurus Festival Urban Dance Contest, which introduced the Peiraios 260 audience to the world of hip hop and street dance, is back this year with new, electrifying dance battles spread across two evenings, once again curated by dancer and choreographer Ilias Chatzigeorgiou.\n\nSome of the best dancers, established and up-and-coming alike, will compete in two categories (1vs1 Hip Hop Battle and 2vs2 All Styles Battle), claiming the winning title of the 3rd Athens Epidaurus Festival Urban Dance Contest and significant money prizes.\n\nThe judges, distinguished dancers from Greece and abroad, will be asked to decide this year’s winners. Audiences will also have the opportunity to enjoy them dancing in the Judges Showcases section.\n\nHost Sifu Versus, with his charismatic presence and familiar voice, will keep us company on both nights, while wonderful dance music will be blasting from DJ AmazeMe’s decks.

Is it possible for dance to demolish the social isolation and physical immobility imposed by the pandemic? Danish dancer and choreographer Mette Ingvartsen, whom we first met at the Athens Epidaurus Festival 2017 with 69 Positions, returns with a rousing solo that will once again electrify audiences. Drawing inspiration from historical phenomena of “dancing mania”, she allows an intense rhythm to sweep her along on a highly charged, infectious dance replete with the dynamic lyrics pervading the story of these narratives. Taking audiences along for the ride, she moves among them, dances with them and involves them in an all-encompassing experience, halfway between a party and a concert. A collective artistic experience reaffirming the promise of her phrase: “Tonight is for dancing, tonight we’ll be dancing”.

A multifaceted visual artist, renowned for the unorthodox approach to his materials, Roth (1930-1998) also left behind an extensive body of work as a writer and poet, which remains largely unknown. The text of the performance, Das Weinen (Das Wähnen), is a collection of verbal acrobatics with stage directions, taken from the edition Das Weinen (Das Wähnen) Volume 2Α (Sea of Tears 4). Figuratively walking on Roth’s tightrope, Marthaler reflects on the transience of things against the backdrop of an antiseptic pharmacy. All the ingredients found in Marthaler’s theatre are once again present: music, irony, expansion of stage time. In Roth, Marthaler finds a kindred spirit due to the latter’s penchant for the absurd, the decay of time and imperfection.\n\nFive women, all pharmacy employees, contemplate the ephemerality of things. The only client (and sole male character in the performance) delivers a monologue about his difficulty swallowing and how it ails him; however, the women hardly pay him any attention. The cure proposed by Marthaler lies, not in medicine, but in Roth’s Neo-Dada texts, which actors recite in the same impressively precise manner in which they chant Mozart’s Lacrimosa. When one of the employees reads the long list of a medicine’s side-effects, we realize that the entire human life is a but a deluge of side-effects from which it seems impossible to rid ourselves.\n\nDirected by Christoph Marthaler • Set design Duri Bischoff • Costume design Sara Kittelmann • Sound design Thomas Schneider • Musical direction – Recordings Bendix Dethleffsen • Lighting design Christoph Kunz • Dramaturgy Malte Ubenauf • Cast Liliana Benini, Magne Håvard Brekke, Olivia Grigolli, Elisa Plüss, Nikola Weisse, Susanne-Marie Wrage • Production Schauspielhaus Zürich, Weiterspielen Productions • Supported by Pro Helvetia, Schweizer Kulturstiftung (TBC)\n\n19 June Post-show talk\n\n*\n\nPEIRAIOS 260 Ε – THEATRE – INTERNATIONAL CO-PRODUCTION\n\n20 & 21 July\n\nAMIR REZA KOOHESTANI – MEHR THEATRE GROUP\n\nBlind Runner\n\nA man posts on his Instagram account that he and his wife, who is currently in jail as a political prisoner, have promised each other to run every night on both sides of the prison wall where she is being held.\n\nBefore her arrest, they had been training to run for months as part of a plan to leave Iran and reach England. They were preparing themselves to cover the 27 kilometres of the Channel Tunnel in the only possible moment, in the five hours between the last train in the evening and the first train of the following day. But their training towards a new life was cut short a week before departure upon the woman’s arrest.\n\nAmir Reza Koohestani writes the story of their long-distance training on both sides of the wall, making it a starting point to reflect on contemporary Iranian society. It’s a run that continues despite everything.\n\nWe see a woman and a man on stage. In a precise interlocking mechanism, their breathless dialogues intersect with their interior monologues, where classical Persian poetry echoes all possible connotations in the darkness of the night.\n\nIranian playwright and director Amir Reza Koohestani has received international praise for his work (awarded for the film Modest Reception at the Berlin International Film Festival), noted for its tenderness, a sense of intimacy and pregnant silences. Koohestani tackles political issues such as the refugee crisis and the oppression of women through the unique lens of the current situation in Iran, having mastered an acutely poetic and symbolic language.\n\nText – Directing Amir Reza Koohestani • Dramaturgy Samaneh Ahmadian • Assistant to the director Dariush Faezi • Lighting and set design Éric Soyer • Video Yasi Moradi, Benjamin Krieg, Phillip Hohenwarter • Music Phillip Hohenwarter, Matthias Peyker • Costume design Negar Nobakht Foghani • Cast Ainaz Azarhoush, Mohammad Reza Hosseinzadeh • Production – Administration – Promotion Pierre Reis – Bureau Formart, Paris (FR) • Production Mehr Theatre Group, Paris (FR) • Co-production Kunstenfestivaldesarts, Brussels (BE), Berliner Festspiele (DE), Athens Epidaurus Festival (GR), Festival d’Automne à Paris (FR), Théâtre de la Bastille, Paris (FR), La rose des vents – scène nationale Lille Métropole – Villeneuve d’Ascq (FR), La Vignette, scène conventionnée Université Paul-Valéry Montpellier, Théâtre populaire romand – Centre neuchâtelois des arts vivants, La Chaux-de-Fonds (CH), Triennale Milano Teatro (IT), Festival delle Colline Torinesi / Fondazione TPE (IT) • Artistic residencies Théâtre populaire romand – Centre neuchâtelois des arts vivants, La Chaux-de-Fonds (CH), Kunstenwerkplaats Pianofabriek, Brussels (BE) • Supported by Institut français and the Ministry of Culture – Regional Directorate of Cultural Affairs of Île-de-France\n\nPerformance in Persian\n\n20 June Post-show talk\n\n*\n\nPEIRAIOS 260 Η – DANCE – FRANCE\n\n22 & 23 June\n\nEMANUEL GAT DANCE\n\nLOVETRAIN2020\n\nFrench-based Israeli choreographer Emanuel Gat presents a celebration of vitality and euphoria at Peiraios 260. Bodies coming together and apart, dynamic group choreographies, duets and solos, all unfold to the sounds of unforgettable hits by Tears for Fears, the British new wave band, recalling the synth-pop utopian atmosphere of the 1980s. The costumes, designed by Thomas Bradley, a dancer of the group, serve and showcase Gat’s directorial style in an ideal manner through their volume and theatricality. Meanwhile, the chiaroscuro lighting, created by the choreographer himself, further emphasizes the Baroque, glamorous, exuberant vibe of the performance.\n\nAccording to the choreographer, LOVETRAIN2020 is a piece about utopia: that impossible, idealized non-place where co-existence without conflict can become reality. Far from being presented as an idea, utopia in Gat’s works is realized through the manner in which the choreography is created. Thanks to his long-standing collaboration with the dancers of his company, Gat has developed a springboard for the artistic exploration of human interaction and experience. The core of his approach lies within this realm of human experience, in what happens in the here and now and how all this is transformed into choreography. A daily practice striving to achieve utopia, a utopia that is by definition unfeasible (and even if it can be rehearsed in a dance studio, it still has no place there) in the real world.\n\nChoreography – Lighting design Emanuel Gat • Music Tears for Fears • Costume design Thomas Bradley • Costume construction Thomas Bradley, Wim Muyllaert • Co-created and performed by Eglantine Bart, Thomas Bradley, Robert Bridger, Gilad Jerusalmy, Péter Juhász, Michael Loehr, Emma Mouton, Rindra Rasoaveloson, Ichiro Sugae, Karolina Szymura, Sara Wilhelmsson, Jin Young Won. • Technical direction – Light supervision Guillaume Février • Sound Frédéric Duru • Wardrobe Marie-Pierre Calliès • Production Emanuel Gat Dance / Marjorie Carré, Mélanie Bichot • Co-production Festival Montpellier Danse 2020, Chaillot – Théâtre national de la Danse, Arsenal Cité musicale – Metz, Theater Freiburg • Support Romaeuropa Festival • Emanuel Gat Dance is supported by the French Ministry of Culture and Communication, DRAC Provence Alpes-Côte d’Azur, Région Sud – Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur, Conseil Départemental des Bouches-du-Rhône.

Halfway between the comic and the tragic, with subtle nuances and a multifaceted approach, choreographer Agni Papadeli Rossetou tackles the existential question of time and decay in her new piece The Jouissance of Representation. Her cornerstones are the concept of the “incomplete” pervading the grotesque, as theorized by Mikhail Bachtin, and Théodore Géricault’s painting.\n\nThe three performers of the piece, sometimes in contact with each other and forming clusters, sometimes solo, allow bodily forms to emerge through their dancing, snapshots of experience, familiar or uncanny images midway between reality and fantasy. Situations in which the flesh is present and spectators can recognize something familiar, something of their own, in them.\n\nThe incessant transformation of the dancers’ bodies from one form to the next generates jouissance. The term jouissance here is the one used in psychoanalysis, where it is not identified with pleasure but rather encompasses discomfort, pain and awkwardness; the response of the artist to wounds linked with the passing of time.\n\nChoreography Agni Papadeli Rossetou • Assistant to the choreographer – Outside eye Marina Tsapekou • Music Andreas Ragnar Kassapis • Lighting design Maria Athanasopoulou • Performers Titi Antonopoulou, Sania Strimpakou, Agni Papadeli Rossetou\n\n*\n\nPEIRAIOS 260 Η – OPERA\n\n29 & 30 June\n\nMICHALIS PAPAPETROU – ALEXANDROS EFKLIDIS\n\nThe Fall of the House of Commons\n\nby Alekos Lountzis and Orestis Papaioannou\n\nA contemporary opera about the “broken ecosystem of postmodern cities”, as viewed by its creators. Increasingly reminiscent of a reflection on a turned off high-definition screen, the interior of present-day apartments is home to a mysterious co-existence of human and artificial intelligence. Home delivery is being provided for all the goods; relationships are woven together and burst out within; fantasies sound like ringtones.\n\nConversing with Edgar Allan Poe’s iconic short story “The Fall of the House of Ushers”, where house and tenants had merged into a closed circuit, the play trails the sounds produced by life within and outside the walls of today’s commonest kind of apartment. The self-referential universe of the couple inhabiting this apartment walks on a spectral balance. The anthropomorphic supervisor, Erika_7, always available to rewrite the memory of the house and provide solutions to the crossword puzzle of co-habitation, is a prominent figure here.\n\nThe dramaturgical dialogue with Poe is employed to demonstrate a juxtaposition of highbrow and kitsch as well as the functional combination of musical idioms from the archive of classic melodrama and the multistylistic assemblages of postmodern music. The musical composition draws on a wide range of genres, focusing on new hybrid trends of 21st-century vocal music.\n\nMusical composition Orestis Papaioannou • Dramaturgy – Libretto Alekos Lountzis • English libretto Alekos Lountzis, Orfeas Apergis • Musical direction Michalis Papapetrou • Directed by Alexandros Efklidis • Set and costume design Giannis Katranitsas • Lighting design Christos Tziogas • Performed by three opera singers • Featuring a six-member orchestra ensemble • Executive production Arte Atene in collaboration with the non-profit American organization Greece in USA\n\n*\n\nPEIRAIOS 260 Ε – THEATRE – grape\n\n30 June – 3 July\n\nPANTELIS DENTAKIS\n\nA Rose is A Rose by Katerina Louvari Fasoi\n\nHow easy is it to be different? To think differently? When do the limits of being different collide with the limits of tolerance and social cohesion? Dionysia, the heroine of this original play by Katerina Louvari Fasoi, lives in an old house, the cats in her yard being her only company. She sings and dreams, wears colourful clothes, opens her home to strangers and locals alike, and is subjected to their hatred and mockery.\n\nInspired by the true story of Dimitra from Skala Sykamias in Lesbos, which shocked Greece, and guided by Martin Luther King Jr.’s book Strength to Love, the play addresses the brutality and blindness of humans. Similar to Christ, who, while crucified, gave us a lesson with the phrase “Father, forgive them, for they know not what they are doing”, Dionysia prays in her deathbed about the salvation of her soul and those of the teenagers who became her executioners. She will almost be relieved to welcome her death, believing in the power of forgiveness and the eternal kindness of humans.

Where are the boundaries between pain and pleasure in an era where the alternation between those two takes place instantly? The performance painfully painless seeks a sensory, pre-linguistic, unspeakable language, one that focuses on the mobility changes of a person in pain.\n\nThe ensemble approaches this subject matter through methods invented by humans for pain management, and develops the piece along two basis axes, one kinetic and one sonic. On the one hand, it focuses on the sensation of bodily pain. A body in pain moves in such a way as to always pursue and complete what is not there. It lives, organizes and regulates itself through memories from the time when it was “complete” and healthy. Its movement, presently elliptical, is realized every moment along with whatever is omitted. On the other hand, it guides us to listen to the particular language in which the phantom of pain expresses itself. Performers on the microphone recite mantras, words, instructions on pain management; they laugh, cry, breathe and everything is recorded, played back and gradually converted into audio frequencies. In this piece, the two aforementioned axes cross paths in multiple ways and instantly illuminate connections highlighting social, religious and cultural mandates on pain.\n\nChoreography – Research Androniki Marathaki • Performance – Research Eltron Petri, Sofia Pouchtou, Despoina Sanida-Krezia, Despina Chatzipavlidou • Dramaturgical contribution Steriani Tsintziloni • Sound design – Live processing with electronic means Jannis Anastasakis • Visual installation design and construction Natalia Manta • Embedded systems Georgios Roustas • Lighting design Nysos Vasilopoulos • Artistic collaborator Eleni Mylona • External collaborators Filippos Vasileiou, John Britton, Mersianna Eleftheriadou, Kostis Kallivretakis, Giorgos Sioras Deligiannis, Leda Diochnou • Development consultant Rallou Avramidou • Executive production Delta Pi • Production Cloudsdonthaveshape • The “Let’s be comfortable in our own skin” dance practice is supported by Mykonos Biennale, Island Connect, Isadora & Raymond Duncan Dance Research Center, Unplugged Dance • Co-production Athens Epidaurus Festival, Cloudsdonthaveshape • Funded by the Hellenic Ministry of Culture and Sports and the NEON Organization for Culture and Development\n\n*\n\nPEIRAIOS 260 D – DANCE – grape\n\n3 & 4 July\n\nROOTLESSROOT\n\nSilence\n\nIf something has been brutally banished from our current age of technology and information, that’s silence. The ever-present barrage of human activity causes endless noise. In addition to silence, the capacity to listen also seems to be fading away. However, what is silence? What dimensions can it assume?\n\nIn their latest piece, the RootlessRoot duo creates a world dedicated to silence and its power. They explore an unknown universe where silence communicates with all those listening carefully to it, with all those conversing with it and utilizing what it has to offer them. Silence is treated as an absolute condition, confronting those who participate in it with the mystery of their own selves and the world at large. Sometimes as a place of reflection, critical thinking and memory, sometimes as a place of faith, prayer and encounter with the divine, silence becomes the space for movement before the actual movement or action. Drawing material from philosophy, theology, poetry, literature and painting, the duo investigates the condition of silence as a medium of self-knowledge and an experiencing of the world. Via improvisations and exercises, the movement research will dictate the choreographic material and theatrical elements of this production.\n\nConcept – Choreography Linda Kapetanea, Jozef Fruček • Set and costume design Paris Mexis • Lighting design Perikles Mathiellis • Musical composition Vassilis Mantzoukis • Sound design – Sound engineer Christos Parapagidis • Scientific associate Kostas Vrachnos • Texts edited by Ioanna Nasiopoulou • Props construction Ilianna Skoulaki • Performers (in alphabetical order) Maria Bregianni, George Dereskos, Anastasis Karachanidis, Maro Stavrinou, Christos Strinopoulos, Alexandros Vardaxoglou • Executive production Polyplanity Productions / Yolanda Markopoulou, Vicky Strataki • Co-production Athens Epidaurus Festival, RootlessRoot • Funded by the Hellenic Ministry of Culture and Sports\n\n*\n\nPEIRAIOS 260 Η – THEATRE – INTERNATIONAL CO-PRODUCTION – grape\n\n4 – 6 July\n\nELLI PAPAKONSTANTINOU\n\nThe Bacchae\n\nAfter Euripides\n\nElli Papakonstantinou’s The Bacchae is an original reading of Euripides’ tragedy, weaving ancient myth and research on gender fluidity together and making full use of new media, dance and sound, and mystical experiences. The dramatist immerses herself in the nebulous world of desire and mythical atrocities in order to speak out about a post-apocalyptic world in the face of an upcoming, ever-approaching catastrophe. Wealthy members of the upper middle class and their servant, in circumstances similar to those in Lars von Trier’s film Melancholia, are waiting any minute now for a meteorite to hit the Earth; a meteorite named “Dionysus” by the scientists. Dionysus arrives in person and guides the heroes to the Room of Desire. There is no other room more terrifying than that. To reach it, they must traverse a mysterious energy field, overcoming the fear of revelation, fall, contamination, decay, hubris and shame. The god Dionysus will not take refusal, postponement, contempt for an answer. He will execute his mission at all costs. A seismograph records every vibration shaking the house on a paper roll that ceaselessly unfolds on stage; a gigantic oscilloscope of the world. The play is built upon speech, music and a dance narrative, investigating a queer performing language, one that is pop yet contains classic operatic outbursts, at once dance-based, mystical and subtle. The Venezuelan alchemist of sounds Ariah Lester and the imaginative choreography of the French duo of Christophe Béranger and Jonathan Pranlas Descours also contributed to the creation of this multilingual play, with English, French, Spanish and Greek all heard on stage.\n\nThe Athens Epidaurus Festival performance will launch the European tour of this production, following its premiere at La Filature, Scène nationale de Mulhouse in France in March 2023.\n\nConcept – Directing Elli Papakonstantinou • Text Chloe Tzia Kollyri, Elli Papakonstantinou • Choreography SINE QUA NON ART / Christophe Béranger – Jonathan Pranlas Descours • Musical composition Ariah Lester • Electroacoustic compositions – Interactive sound design installation – Technical coordination Lambros Pigounis • Set design Maria Panourgia • Video art – Live video performance Pantelis Makkas • Costume design Ioanna Tsami • Lighting design Marietta Pavlaki • Seismograph designed by Yiannis Kranidiotis • Assistant to the director Spyros Sourvinos • Texts co-edited by Louisa Arkoumanea • Dramaturgy collaboration Ariah Lester, Charis Kalaitzidis • Photos Alex Kat • Trailer Sideris Nanoudis • Tour production manager Laurent Langlois • ODC office manager Gina Zorba • Second assistant to the director Katerina Christakaki • Third assistant to the director Katerina Savvoglou • Assistant to the set designer Sofia Theodoraki • Assistant to the video artist Anthi Veloudogianni • Cast Vassilis Boutsikos, Georgios Iatrou, Chara Kotsali, Ariah Lester, Lito Messini, Aris Papadopoulos • Production ODC Ensemble • Co-production La Filature, Scène Nationale Mulhouse (FR), Festival de Marseille (FR), La Strada Graz Festival (AT), Romaeuropa Festival (IT), Teatro Nazionale di Genova (IT), Athens Epidaurus Festival • Residency Espace des Arts, Scène Nationale Chalon-Sur-Saône (FR) • Funded by the Hellenic Ministry of Culture and Sports\n\n*\n\nPEIRAIOS 260 Β – DANCE – grape\n\n8 – 10 July\n\nDIMITRIS MYTILINAIOS\n\nRepair\n\nThree iconic, short choreographic works – L’après midi d’un faune (Paris, 1912), Grand pas classique (Paris, 1949) and Tchaikovsky Pas de Deux (New York, 1960) – are scrutinized, analyzed and reconstructed as a choreographic collage, forming a new whole.\n\nRepair is a quartet focusing on the notion of pas de deux, familiar to us through the history of ballet. The ambiguous title, Repair, primarily denotes an intention of “restoring” what a “dance duet” means today, taking into account the topical debate on gender identities. At the same time, as a pun, the title implies a re-pairing, as the duet here is actually performed by four dancers!\n\nDespite the clear reference to historical sources, nothing is taken for granted. Every element used is differentiated from its original source, neither describing it nor representing it. Ballet is not approached as a form of movement but as a system revealing the dance situation to the performers. With meticulous technical precision and detail, the famous music works and choreographies are presented in a new “orchestration”. As such, a new relationship between them is forged, as composite aspects of the present piece.\n\nChoreography Dimitris Mytilinaios • Music Lambros Pigounis • Lighting design Dimitris Kasimatis • Costume design Angelos Mentis • Make-up – Hairstyling Ioanna Lygizou • Assistant to the choreographer Elena Novakovic • Performers Amalia Kosma, Pierre Magendie, Konstantina Barkouli-Gavri, Dimitris Mitilinaios • Production howtomakeyourlifeharder • Executive production Olga Tsatsouli • Funded by the Hellenic Ministry of Culture and Sports • Supported by the NEON Organization for Culture and Development\n\nThe performance contains nudity.\n\n*\n\nPEIRAIOS 260 Ε – THEATRE – grape\n\n8 – 11 July\n\nTHANASIS ZERITIS – HARRY KREMMYDAS / 4FRONTAL\n\nSpyridoules by Nefeli Maistrali\n\nCombining aspects of documentary theatre, original dramaturgy and contemporary Greek music, this performance by the well-known 4frontal ensemble takes the true story of Spyridoula, a 12-year-old housemaid, as its jumping-off point; a story that shocked the 1950s Greek public.\n\nAt the time, numerous poor, underage girls were adopted by prominent families as psychokores (foster daughters) to be employed as live-in servants in what was a peculiar condition of modern-day slavery.\n\nOne of them was 12-year-old Spyridoula Rapti from Mataragas, Agrinion, who moved to the Greek capital to work in the wealthy Veizade household. For two consecutive years, as revealed in the hospital, the Veizade couple abused her physically and mentally, even reaching the point of burning her face and body with the clothes iron. Nevertheless, Spyridoula mustered the courage to speak out, breaking the vicious cycle of violence. A popular idol and source of empowerment for several generations of women who have suffered abuse and managed to speak out and put an end to it, she continues to inspire people.\n\nDrawing on historical documents such as the court records for the Giorgos and Antigoni Veizade trial, literary texts and contemporaneous narratives by women as well as present-day interviews of women working as live-in servants, Nefeli Maistrali has authored an original theatrical text. Utilizing this new text to the sounds of Greek punk music by Thrax Punks, the performance brings alive the voices of women who found themselves or still find themselves in this position, fighting for control of their lives.\n\nDirected by Thanasis Zeritis, Harry Kremmydas • Dramaturgy Nefeli Maistrali • Set and costume design Georgia Bourda • Music design – Composition Thrax Punks • Movement Panos Topsidis • Assistant to the directors Eleni Tsimprikidou • Research Panagiotis Liaropoulos • Lighting design Sakis Birbilis • Executive production Aristea Stafylaraki – 4frontal • Cast Tassos Dimitropoulos, Stavros Giannouladis, Evangelia Karakatsani, Tatiana Anna Pitta, Argyro Theodoraki\n\n10 July Post-show talk\n\n*\n\nPEIRAIOS 260 Η – DANCE\n\n9 & 10 July\n\nJERÔME BEL\n\nIsadora Duncan\n\nIsadora Duncan, a performance by iconic choreographer Jérôme Bel, made for and in collaboration with Elisabeth Schwartz, focuses on the figure of Isadora Duncan, continuing the series of dancer portraits initiated by the choreographer back in 2004. Bel himself performs on stage, joined by one of the greatest students of the Isadorables group. Beneath the romantic figure, he discovers a visionary choreographer, investigating her legacy and the myths that accompany her.\n\nIn contrast to the previous instalments of this series (Véronique Doisneau, Cédric Andrieux and Pichet Klunchun and myself), in which Bel was in dialogue with the artists, here he creates the portrait of a dancer who is no longer alive, based on her autobiography. Duncan, widely regarded as the “mother” of modern and contemporary dance, had close ties with Greece, first visiting the country in 1903, with 2023 marking a 120-year anniversary of her visit.\n\nConcept Jérôme Bel • Choreography Isadora Duncan • Performers Elisabeth Schwartz / Sheila Atala, Chiara Gallerani, Jérôme Bel • Co-production La Commune centre dramatique national d’Aubervilliers, Les Spectacles Vivants – Centre Georges Pompidou (Paris), Festival d’Automne à Paris, R.B.

The only fully extant tragedy tackling the myth of the Pelopidae, Thyestes dramatizes the so-called “Thyestean Feast”, Atreus’ terrifying act of revenge, as he murdered his brother’s children, cooked them and served them to him for dinner, an incident that put an end to the long-standing feud between the two brothers for royal power.\n\nInfused with the uncontrollable and bloodthirsty political milieu of his time, the Roman orator, dramatist and stoic philosopher depicts a fallen, disintegrating world in his tragedies. Far from being a prosperous assembly of citizens, the state is but an arena, an absurd mass of monsters and beasts constantly devising ways in which they can ensnare and eliminate their opponents. Under this perspective, however far human society has progressed, darkness will always be looking for a crack through which it can surface and envelop everything. Indeed, in this play a solar eclipse plunges the city into darkness. The state is overrun; no longer the finest of citizens, the king is actually a great beast growling above his victims.\n\nThe form of the performance is inspired by the extensive messenger speech narrating the macabre feast ritual, with the director approaching the play as an oratorio of horror. Original electronic music and sound design serve as structural aspects of this audiovisual nightmare.\n\nConceived and directed by Thanos Papakonstantinou • Set and costume design Niki Psyhogiou • Original music Andys Skordis • Movement Nanti Gogoulou • Lighting design Christina Thanasoula • Sound design – Assistant to the director Fanis Sakellariou • Cast Konstantinos Avarikiotis (Atreus), Antonis Myriagos (Thyestes), Tasos Dimas (Ghost of Tantalus), Marianna Dimitriou (Erinys – Messenger) • Chorus Giorgos Dikaios, Michalis Panadis, Fotis Stratigos • Executive production BEE DRAMAQUEENS AMKE / Rena Andreadaki, Zoe Mouschi\n\n*\n\nPEIRAIOS 260 D – DANCE\n\n14 & 15 July\n\nJAN MARTENS & DANCE ON ENSEMBLE\n\nany attempt will end in crushed bodies and shattered bones\n\n“Snowflakes, leaves, humans, plants, raindrops, stars and molecules all come in communities. The singular cannot really exist”\n\nPaula Gunn Allen\n\nGrandmothers of the Light: A Medicine Woman’s Sourcebook\n\nInspired by the numerous protests around the world and the need for social solidarity and resistance to state repression, avant-garde Belgian choreographer and performer Jan Martens returns to the Athens Epidaurus Festival, this time in collaboration with the Berlin-based Dance On company. Borrowing its title from a speech delivered by Xi Jinping, President of the People’s Republic of China, to the Hong Kong protesters in 2019, any attempt will end in crushed bodies and shattered bones had its premiere at the 2021 Festival d’Avignon. A production meant for a big stage, it incorporates the power of diversity as well as the co-existence of unique individualities into its very form, featuring a corps de ballet that is heterogeneous in terms of age and body type, consisting of 17 dancers aged 18-71 years old. The performance showcases each dancer’s unique, signature style within an ensemble demonstrating a joint physical and performative energy. Based on the intensely rhythmical Harpsichord Concerto by contemporary Polish composer Henryk Mikolaj Górecki, the choreography is embellished with pieces of resistance from the 1960s to this day by Max Roach and Abbey Lincoln to Kae Tempest.\n\nTaking the phrase uttered by the Chinese president, translated and broadcast around the world in various ways, as his starting point, Martens observes that language in our times of “post-truth” serves primarily as an “ideological tool”. In addition to dancing, Martens also brings on stage language itself as a performing medium, introducing oral excerpts from Scottish writer Ali Smith’s novel Spring*, as well as online, written declarations of hatred, fragments of which are projected behind the dancers. The idea of a harmonious social co-existence may ultimately be but a utopia; we must constantly defend the possibility of being different together against the various reactionary voices.\n\n[*Third part of the Seasonal Quartet series of novels.

Once again this year, Giannis Skourletis and the bijoux de kant company “read” tradition in their own, peculiar manner, seeking inspiration from the great composer, conductor and pianist Giannis Konstantinidis (1903-1984), who hailed from Asia Minor. Using the pseudonym “Kostas Giannidis”, he made a name for himself in elafra (light) songs (“Ksypna Agapi Mou”, “Tha Xanartheis”, “Ta Nea tis Alexandras”, “Poso Lypamai”). During the last 20 years of his life, he focused exclusively on his classical work, using dimotika (traditional) songs as his basis.\n\nThrough his Twenty Songs of the Greek People song cycle, Konstantinidis created a hypertext, a “twofold” musical composition on a par with his entire artistic oeuvre. The dimotika tragoudia, so familiar to us, move here towards a new form, in a dialectical relationship with both Greekness and the Western musical tradition.\n\nUsing Konstantinidis’ charming song cycle as a springboard, alongside texts by artist and researcher Alexandros Papadopoulos, three artists, namely drag baritone Nina Nai, performer Daglara and pianist Giorgos Ziavras, narrate a heartfelt story that could have been a screenplay for a Greek horror show. Amid an uncanny landscape designed by set designer Konstantinos Skourletis, they address the open trauma of patriarchy and deviation. They tell a story about a different, often unseen, kind of Greece, on the fringes of urbanization, in the vast country surrounding little towns, in the gaps in between them. Idols of a well-hidden personal experience, they recount the passions and pain of otherness in a dystopian world.\n\nConceived and directed by Giannis Skourletis • Music Giannis Konstantinidis / Kostas Giannidis • Set and costume design Konstantinos Skourletis • Lighting design bijoux de kant • Text – Translation Alexandros Papadopoulos • Dramaturgy – Artistic coordination Giorgos Papadakis • Assistant to the director TBA • Performed by Nina Nai (baritone in drag), Giorgos Ziavras (piano), Daglara (performer) • Production manager Asimenia Efhtymiou • Executive production bijoux de kant\n\n*\n\nPEIRAIOS Ε – THEATRE – grape\n\n17 – 20 July\n\nZOE CHATZIANTONIOU\n\nRequiem for Fanny Goldmann\n\nBased on the work by Ingeborg Bachmann\n\n“She felt robbed, stripped of all her sentences and judments […] He had butchered her, turning her into sausage and meat. He had sliced her up. She was sliced up into 386 pages in a book […]”\n\n(trans. P. Filkins)\n\nBeautiful actress Fanny Goldmann becomes romantically involved with the obscure yet ambitious writer Toni Marek. After taking advantage of her connections, he leaves her for a younger woman. Subsequently, he turns her life into the subject of his first successful book. “She had told him things at night as she lay beside him, or while walking through a forest together, riding a bike, drinking their first coffee in a café” (trans. P. Filkins). All the things she had told him – in the two years they were together she had told him everything – find their way into his book. She becomes mortally ill when something unprecedented manifests and spreads in her body, mind and nervous system akin to a cancer: hatred. Abandoned and surrendering herself to alcohol, she becomes ill. Her hatred leads her to death.\n\n“These crimes are so subtle that we can hardly perceive or comprehend them. […] Rather they require greater refinement, another level of intelligence and are themselves dreadful” (trans. P. Filkins). Requiem for Fanny Goldmann, a fragment of a novel by Ingeborg Bachmann (1926-1973), the “most intelligent and most important” Austrian writer according to Thomas Bernhard, was meant to be part of a novel cycle titled Todesarten (German for “Ways of death”). True to its title, the novel cycle describes stories of women, as Bachmann, who herself died under mysterious circumstances, investigates the ways in which female existence is eradicated by a patriarchal logic defining history, politics, religion, family, even women’s own self-perception.\n\nDrawing on the elliptical style of Requiem, replete with brackets, ellipses and latent words that one encounters while attempting to decipher it, Zoe Chatziantoniou’s performance conjures a landscape of narrative fragments that bears similarities to Bachmann’s universe. Its main questions are: How does the latent fascism of everyday life creep into language and relationships? How is female subjectivity ultimately banished from a world in which it has no place?\n\nDramaturgy – Directing Zoe Chatziantoniou • Translated by Maria Angelidou – Angelos Angelidis • Set design Maria Panourgia • Music – Sound Georgios Mizithras • Dramaturgy consultant Armin Kerber • Dramaturgy and director assistant Dimitra Thomaidou • Video Pantelis Makkas • Lighting design Dimitris Kasimatis • Assistant to the set designer Nadia Kassara • Cast Alexia Kaltsiki, Elina Rizou, Chara Mata Giannatou, Anna Kalaitzidou • Executive production Konstantina Angeletou • Executive production Lykofos\n\nThe Greek translation by Maria Angelidou was published by Agra Publications (Athens, 1992) and released as Ρέκβιεμ για τη Φάννυ Γκόλντμαν (Από τα προσχέδια ενός μυθιστορήματος).\n\n18 July Post-show talk\n\n*\n\nPEIRAIOS 260 D – THEATRE – FRANCE\n\n19 & 20 July\n\nGISÈLE VIENNE\n\nL’Étang (The Pond) by Robert Walser\n\nDrawing on dance, music and theatre, director and choreographer Gisèle Vienne has been building her own, atmospheric world, noted for its strong visual elements, for the past 20 years. She was first introduced to the Greek audience in 2018 with the performance Crowd, a piece about the dark relationship between the personal and the collective sentiment. This year, she will present the riveting L’Étang at the Festival, a piece that had its premiere in 2021 at the Théâtre de Vidy-Lausanne in Switzerland and is based on Robert Walser’s short play Der Teich (German for The Pond), tackling a dysfunctional family environment.\n\nA boy, feeling rejected by his family, desperately fakes his own death, supposedly drowning in a lake. Vienne creates a powerful psychological drama, shedding light to Walser’s disturbing insinuations about child abuse, incest and family trauma. Vienne’s two performers, sharing 10 roles on stage, the hypnotic lighting and the minimal electronic music by Stephen O’Malley bring to the surface repressed urges and pent-up emotions. The self is scattered amidst all the pain. Every sentence is shrouded in doubt. Were all these things truly narrated or was it just a dream? While Walser’s text offers a sliver of hope for reconciliation, there is no happy ending in Vienne’s world. The trauma is too deep.\n\nHaving studied music, philosophy and puppetry, Gisèle Vienne, born in France in 1976, founded her own theatre company in 1999. Since then, she has created a total of 11 performances and 7 productions in collaboration with Etienne Bideau-Rey, presented all around Europe, Asia and America.\n\nConcept – Directing – Set design – Dramaturgy Gisèle Vienne • Performers Adèle Haenel, Julie Shanahan • Text adaptation Adèle Haenel, Julie Shanahan, Henrietta Wallberg in collaboration with Gisèle Vienne • Lighting design Yves Godin • Sound Adrien Michel • Musical direction Stephen F.
