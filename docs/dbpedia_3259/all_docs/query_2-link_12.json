        "meta_description": "1921  Major League Baseball Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis confirms the ban of the eight Chicago Black Sox, the day after they were acquitted by a Chicago court. The Black Sox Scandal was a game-fixing scandal in Major League Baseball (MLB) in which eight members of the Chicago White Sox were accused of intentionally losing the 1919 World Series against the Cincinnati Reds in exchange for payment from a gambling syndicate, possibly led by organized crime figure Arnold Rothstein. There is strong evidence both for and against Rothstein's involvement, however, there is no conclusive indication that the gambling syndicate's actions were directed by organized crime. In response, the National Baseball Commission was dissolved and Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis was appointed to be the first Commissioner of Baseball, given absolute control over the sport to restore its integrity. Despite acquittals in a public trial in 1921, Commissioner Landis permanently banned all eight players from professional baseball. The Baseball Hall of Fame eventually defined the punishment as banishment from consideration for the Hall. Despite requests for reinstatement in the decades that followed (particularly in the case of Shoeless Joe Jackson), the ban remains in force. Jackson's involvement in the scandal remains controversial to this day.Years later, the other seven players implicated in the scandal confirmed that Jackson was never at any meetings. During the remaining 20 years of his baseball career, Jackson played with and managed several semi-professional teams, most located in Georgia and South Carolina, under assumed names. In 1922, Jackson moved to Savannah, Georgia, and opened a dry cleaning business with his wife. In 1933, the Jacksons moved back to Greenville, South Carolina. After opening a barbecue restaurant, Jackson and his wife opened 'Joe Jackson's Liquor Store', which they operated until his death. One of the better-known stories of Jackson's post-major league life occurred at the store. Ty Cobb and sportswriter Grantland Rice entered the store, with Jackson showing no sign of recognition of Cobb. After making his purchase, Cobb finally asked Jackson, 'Don't you know me, Joe?' Jackson replied, 'Sure, I know you, Ty, but I wasn't sure you wanted to know me. A lot of them don't.'",
