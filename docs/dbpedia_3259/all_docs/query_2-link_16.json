He became the primary driver for the highly successful Shelsley Special “Freikaiserwagen”, created by his cousin David Fry and Hugh Dunsterville, with help from Dick Caesar. The original car was built in Bristol in 1936 and featured an Anzani engine which was replaced in 1937 by a Blackburne engine. Joe set a number of hill records during the late 1930s including an unofficial outright record at Prescott when he climbed in 47.62 seconds in the 1,100 c.c. Freikaiserwagen, on 27 August 1938. At the outbreak of World War Two he held both the blown and unblown 1100 cc records at Shelsley Walsh Hill Climb in 41.52 and 42.58 seconds respectively. Fry finished second in class, for racing cars up to 1100 cc, in the Freikaiserwagen at the Brighton Speed Trials in 1947. He drove the car to a class victory at Brighton the following year recording a faster time. He won the class again at Brighton in 1949 reducing his time yet again. time was 31.13 seconds.

Later, he earned a degree in Chemical Engineering at the University of Washington, where he became involved in mountain climbing. Schoening is perhaps best remembered for his heroics during “The Belay” while part of the American K2 expedition in 1953. He single-handedly averted the loss of the entire expedition when he used an ice axe to set and hold a line saving five of the team who had slid off the mountain and dangled thousands of feet in the air.

Early versions were called 1200, 1300, and 1500 which referred to the size of the engines in cubic centimetres. Drawbacks to the little car were its styling or lack thereof, weak power, rough ride, and high noise levels. Regardless, it remained on the market for one of the longest periods of manufacture and is one of the most recognizable vehicles ever built. Designs were first submitted in 1925 and modified over the years. In 1933, Hitler met with Richard Whittle and Ferdinand Porsche and asked them to develop a low-priced Volks-Wagen or People’s Car. It was to hold 2 adults and 3 children, have a top speed of 62 mph and not cost more than 990 Reichsmarks (about 31 weeks pay), the prototype appeared in 1935 with an air-cooled, rear-mounted engine.\n\nOn this day in 2006 the world’s longest running music show Top of the Pops is broadcast for the last time on BBC Two.

They spent each winter in the Krkonoše mountains. After this tradition was interrupted during World War II, Vrzáňová started figure skating. The training conditions were difficult, as she had to skate in early winter mornings. Her training sessions were held in darkness because of the dim-out regulations. She skated at the open Štvanice Stadium before the sessions for hockey players, or at the CLTK club tennis courts, which were flooded with water and frozen. In 1946, Vrzáňová became the Czechoslovak junior national champion. In early 1947, she moved to Richmond, London to be coached by Arnold Gerschwiler. In 1947, she won the Czechoslovak national championships and placed 7th at the 1947 World Figure Skating Championships. Vrzáňová represented Czechoslovakia at the 1948 Winter Olympics. She placed fifth in the event, finishing fifth behind compatriot Jiřina Nekolová. In 1949, Vrzáňová was awarded the silver medal at the European Championships in Milan and won her first World title in Paris. She seized her chance to win the gold medal as the Olympic runner-up and reigning European champion Eva Pawlik of Austria had dropped out because of a broken boot heel just before the free programme. At the event, she was credited as being the first woman to land a double Lutz jump. After winning the 1950 European Championships, she won a second world title at the 1950 World Championships. She then went on a European tour instead of returning home. She eventually moved to the United States and performed for the traveling show Ice Follies for three years under the name “Aja Zanova” before joining the Ice Capades. She also participated in television ads and other shows. After her husband’s death, she worked for the Ice Capades and led New York City’s largest public ice rink, the Wollman Rink. Vrzáňová was inducted into the World Figure Skating Hall of Fame in 2009. In 2009, she also received the title of the Sports Legend of the Czech Republic. In 2012, Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg presented to her the 16th annual Gratias Agit Awards in recognition of those who promote the good name of the Czech Republic abroad.\n\n31st\n\nRamón Fonst Cuban fencer was born today in 1883. Although born in Cuba, he spent most of his youth in France, where he received his fencing education, and aged just 16 years he entered the 1900 Olympics Men’s épée event. He was up against another 101 fencers from 10 other countries, in his first-round group he came out top against the five fencers from France, so advanced into the next round, where he only managed to finish third but was still good enough to advance to the semi-finals and again he would finish third in the group and so qualifying for the final. In the final, Fonst was up against seven French and one Argentine fencer, and against the odds (and the judges) he won four of his six matches to win the gold and so became the first Cuban and first Latin American medallist on the Olympic stage. A few days later, Fonst competed in the Men’s amateurs-masters épée which put the top four amateurs with the top four professionals at the Games, Fonst managed to win six of his seven contests and won the silver medal, his only defeat was against the French professional Albert Ayat who went on to win the gold medal. Four years later, Fonst was in St.Louis, Missouri, competing at the 1904 Olympics, and within two days he won three gold medals, he retained his Olympic title in the Men’s épée, and added the Men’s foil title and under the Mixed team banner he won the Men’s team foil event with fellow Cuban Manuel Díaz and American Albertson Van Zo Post. Cuba didn’t compete in the Summer Olympics again until 1924, which was again held in Paris. Now aged 40, Fonst again competed in the Men’s épée but this time only managed to reach the semi-final, he also competed in the Men’s team épée but they were knocked out of the competition in the quarter-finals.

He immediately demonstrated his abilities on the local stage but due to the war, and his role in the Indian armed forces, his career was interrupted. Adhikari made his Test debut as a 28-year-old in 1947 on India’s tour of Australia and immediately established himself as an important member of the squad, although his continued official role in the army restricted his availability for the team. He took to coaching after retiring from first-class cricket – with a very good batting average of 41.74 – and was in charge of the Indian team as they established themselves on the world stage. He helped guide India to their first series win in England in 1971 and was a major reason behind the development of such outstanding cricketers as Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and Ravi Shastri. Some felt his history with military helped him as a coach, with former national team spin bowler Bapu Nadkarni saying “Adhikari was a disciplined man. Being a military man, he would not bother about what anybody else thought.”\n\nOn this day in 1928 Halina Konopacka of Poland became the first female track and field Olympic gold medallist.

The Tour de France had proved a success when the first race was run in 1903 and both the competition between riders and the passion of the fans who supported them rose to sometimes dangerous proportions. Riders took trains and lifts in cars or had themselves towed by drivers, the 1903 winner, Maurice Garin received food from the race director, Géo Lefèvre when others were denied. Fans beat up riders on the col de la République outside St-Étienne and dispersed only when Garin fired his gun.

America distance runner and athlete, considered by many to be the greatest miler of all time, Glenn Cunningham was born in 1909. Cunningham was nicknamed the “Kansas Flyer”, the “Elkhart Express” and the “Iron Horse of Kansas”. Cunningham’s legs were very badly burned in an explosion caused when someone accidentally put gasoline instead of kerosene in the can at his school when he was eight and his brother Floyd was thirteen. Floyd died in the fire. When the doctors recommended amputating Glenn’s legs, he was so distressed his parents would not allow it. The doctors predicted he might never walk normally again. He had lost all the flesh on his knees and shins and all the toes on his left foot. Also, his transverse arch was practically destroyed. However, his great determination, coupled with hour upon hour of a new type of therapy, enabled him to gradually regain the ability to walk and to proceed to run. It was in the early summer of 1919 when he first tried to walk again, roughly two years after the accident. He competed in both the 1932 and 1936 Olympics and while on the ship travelling from the USA to Germany, he was voted “Most Popular Athlete” by his fellow Olympians. Cunningham won the Sullivan medal in 1933 for his various running achievements in middle distance. In the 1932 Olympics he was 4th in the 1500m, and in 1936 he took silver. In 1934, he set the world record for the mile run at 4:06.8, which stood for three years and in 1936, he set the world record in the 800m. In 1938, he set a world record in the indoor mile run of 4:04.4. He retired from competition in 1940.

During her career, she won gold medals in the 1500m and 3000m at the 1983 World Championships, and was the world record holder in the mile, 5000m and 10,000m. In total, she set 17 official and unofficial world records, including being the first woman in history to run less than 4:20 for the mile. She also set 36 US national records at distances ranging from 800m to 10,000m, and has held the US record in the mile, 2000m and 3000m since the early 1980s, while her 1500m record stood for 32 years. In 2003, she was inducted into the National Track and Field Hall of Fame. Decker is most remembered for the events surrounding the 3000m at the 1984 Olympics. Decker was heavily favoured to win and in the final, barefoot runner, Britain’s Zola Budd, side by side with Decker for three laps and moved ahead. In an attempt to put pressure on Budd, Decker remained close by in a crowded space. Decker stood on Budd, then shortly after, collided with the barefoot runner and fell spectacularly to the curb. As a result, Mary Decker did not finish the race, which was won by Maricica Puica of Romania (Budd finished seventh). Decker was carried off the track in tears by her boyfriend (and later, husband), British discus thrower Richard Slaney. At a press conference she said that Budd was to blame for the collision. While it is generally the trailing athlete’s responsibility to avoid contact with the runner ahead, it is also an accepted convention among most distance runners that the leader be a full stride ahead before cutting in. Track officials initially disqualified Budd for obstruction, but she was reinstated just one hour later once officials had viewed films of the race. Despite being behind Budd, Decker’s claim that Budd had bumped into her leg was supported by a number of US sports journalists, and Budd was hounded constantly in the press as a result, receiving a number of death threats. The claim was never accepted by the director of the games or the IAAF. Decker and Budd next met in July 1985, in a 3000m race at Crystal Palace, Decker won the race, and Budd finished in fourth place. After the race, the two women shook hands and made up. Decker later went on record as claiming that she was unfairly robbed of the LA 3000m gold medal by Budd, but said many years after the event “The reason I fell, some people think she tripped me deliberately. I happen to know that wasn’t the case at all. The reason I fell is because I am and was very inexperienced in running in a pack.\n\nIn 1976 women played cricket at Lord’s for the first time, an England team beating Australia by eight wickets in a limited 60 overs match.\n\nToday in 1996 the 24th edition of the du Maurier Golf Classic was won by Laura Davies, on the very same day that the 26th Olympic Games in Atlanta came to an end.\n\nToday in 2012 the South African athlete Oscar Pistorius became the first amputee to compete at the Olympics, when he ran in the heats of the 400m. He took second place in the first heat of five runners, finishing with a time of 45.44 seconds to advance to the semi-finals on 5 August. He ran in the second semi-final, where he finished eighth and last with a time of 46.54 seconds"
