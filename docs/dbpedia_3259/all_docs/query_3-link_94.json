        "text": "Our team would like to thank everyone who contributed in making our project happen, without whom it would not have been possible.\n\nWet Lab\n\nDr. Panagoula Kollia, Professor at the Biology department of NKUA and our Primary PI, welcomed our team into her lab and a meeting space to work in and advised us on scientific and practical matters.\n\nDr. Evangelos Topakas, Associate Professor at the school of Chemical Engineering of NTUA and our Secondary PI, gave us advice on conjugation and bacterial production of cellulose. He also helped us manage necessary bureaucratic issues we found along the way.\n\nDr. Vasiliki Koumandou Professor at the Biotechnology department of AUA and our Secondary PI, provided valuable feedback concerning our experiments and was very supportive, addressing several scientific questions accumulated while working on this project. She offered guidance concerning any lab experiments that we conducted. Lastly, she supported and gave feedback for the Bioart hub between our team and Mr Ioannis Melanitis’ Art lab of ASFA.\n\nElena Pappa, Lab technician at the Biology department of NKUA and our Advisor, aided us with our experiments and was the supervisor of our laboratory space, providing us with any supplies we did not possess.\n\nDr. Colin Ingham, CEO and founder of the Hoekmine Biotechnology company, provided us with the plasmids and bacterial strains used in our experiments and gave us helpful insight and guidance regarding the experimental procedures and protocols we followed.\n\nDr. Mark J. McBride, Distinguished Professor at the Department of Biological Sciences, University of WI-Milwaukee, kindly provided us with the sequences of plasmids.\n\nMsc student Nikolaos Kalavros, Biologist, Bioinformatician and past iGEM Athens member. A dear friend who supported us no matter the work hours and workload. He provided invaluable scientific and technical help for every aspect of the project.\n\nDry Lab\n\nDr. Michalis Kavousanakis, Assistant professor at School of Chemical Engineering, NTUA and Instructor of our team, provided us with valuable feedback concerning the model of the gliding motility mechanism throughout the year.\n\nDr. Pete Vukusic, Professor and Associate Dean for Education at the University of Exeter provided us insight and guidance as to how the COMSOL simulation could give estimates for the optical properties of the biomaterial.\n\nDr. Argyro Tsipa informed us about some technical details for the kinetic model of cellulose production.\n\nHuman Practices\n\nAngeliki Fragkou, PhD candidate of ASFA. Our collaboration led to the formation of an interdisciplinary BioArt hub with members of the ASFA community.\n\nIoannis Melanitis, Assistant Professor of ASFA. He also contributed to the formation of the Βioart hub.\n\nDr. Vasiliki Molaki, Scientific Associate at Hellenic National Bioethics Commission, helped inform us on bioethical issues regarding our project and synthetic biology in general.\n\nArslan Yılmaz, former art teacher and current paint company owner. Through his unique point of view, he gave us helpful insight, regarding the problems of working with synthetic colours. Also he gave us feedback and ideas to incorporate in our final product.\n\nDr. Emmanuel Stratakis, Research Director at the Institute of Electronic structure and laser (IESL) of the Foundation for Research and Technology - Hellas (FORTH) and CEO of the spinoff company Biomimetic, introduced us to biomimetic structures and gave us advice on how to quantify our results.\n\nLydia Lekka is the coordinator of the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) Greece Youth. She informed us on the topic of the UN Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development and the Goals and targets proposed, providing useful advice and information for the further sustainable development of our project and final product.\n\nFundraising\n\nDr. Andreas G. Boudouvis, Rector of the National Technical University of Athens and Professor at the School of Chemical Engineering, provided valuable help concerning the fundraising, building partnerships and support.\n\nDr. Ioannis K. Chatjigeorgiou, vice Rector of the National Technical University of Athens and Professor at the School of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering of NTUA, contributed actively in managing the bureaucratic issues of the fundraising.\n\nAegeas, Non Profit Organization, provided us with laboratory and promotional materials.\n\nTeam Members\n\nModeling of the optical properties of theoretical structures was developed by Ilias Toumpe.\n\nThe biophysical mass-spring model of the cell for the simulation of the gliding motility mechanism was constructed by Dimos Aslanis.\n\nThe Box2D simulation of the gliding motility mechanism was constructed by Natalia Salpea,Vasileia Spyridaki.\n\nThe kinetic modeling for the cellulose biosynthesis was implemented by Ilias Toumpe, Eleftheria Kelefioti Stratidaki.\n\nThe graphics were designed by Natalia Salpea, Kalliopi Belegri.\n\nVideo editing was performed by Natalia Salpea.\n\nThe wiki was designed and developed by Natalia Salpea, Ilias Toumpe, Vasileia Spyridaki.\n\nDesign of the experimental procedure, the selection of bacteria, cellulose genes, design of BioBricks and design of the promoters were done by Marianna Ioannidou, Spyros Kanellopoulos, George Brouzakis, Eleftheria Kelefioti Stratidaki, Kalliopi Belegri, Andreas A.T. Dekmak, Kleoniki Pylarinou.\n\nHuman practices actions were organised by Orsalia Veloudiou, Andreas A.T. Dekmak, Kalliopi Belegri, Kleoniki Pylarinou, Vasileia Spyridaki, Spyros Kanellopoulos, Marianna Ioannidou, Eleftheria Kelefioti Stratidaki, Ilias Toumpe.\n\nThe fundraising tasks were assigned to Ilias Toumpe, Orsalia Veloudiou, Eleftheria Kelefioti Stratidaki, Kalliopi Belegri, Kleoniki Pylarinou.\n\nWe would also like to thank all iGEM teams who contributed in the translation and thus formation of a multilingual flyer regarding pollution: iGEM Groningen 2020, iGEM UPCH Peru, iGEM UCopenhagen 2020, iGEM Nantes 2020, iGEM NOVA Lisbon, iGEM KU Istanbul.\n\nWe would also like to express our gratitude for the support and valuable help that iGEM KU Istanbul gave us throughout the year.\n\nLastly, special thanks to iGEM Athens 2018 and iGEM Athens 2019 for their valuable mentoring and help during the past year’s difficulties."
