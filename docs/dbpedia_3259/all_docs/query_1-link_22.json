        "text": "14 SUN 11:00 (50’)\n\nDon Quixote - Miguel de Cervantes I Antilogue Theatre\n\nThe Antilogue Theatre, faithful to its appointment with the young friends of theatre, presents the children's production \"Don Quixote\", the classic literary masterpiece by the Spanish author Miguel de Cervantes, in a theatrical adaptation and directed by Irene Andronicus. A bizarre dreamy knight moves among us. He cooks in our kitchen, sits in our living room, opens the door to our nursery and plays with all our toys. Like a child, only he's grown up now. The look on his face is funny makes us laugh. But if you look closely you will see his sad eyes. His reflection in the mirror is the same as yours Even his voice is like yours.\n\n-What are you doing here, knight with the sad face?\n\n-I came to change the world.\n\n-You are mad.\n\n-If you want to change the world, it's not madness, it's not utopia. It's justice!\n\nThe uncompromising hero entertains young and old alike with his unrepentant childish fantasy of trying to change the world. Theatre helps children unleash their imagination. It teaches values, talks about friendship, solidarity and volunteering. It addresses everyday issues in an understandable way. Children's theatre contributes to a better expression of emotions and develops sociability. For children who dream of a better and more beautiful future. Full of joy, love and justice. For the children of the heart. Suitable for all.

The orchestra proudly presents four of the pieces from his solo piano etudes titled Childhood Whims, especially orchestrated for this programme by Alkis Baltas. The Four Temperaments by Paul Hindemith is known both as a concert piece as well as music for a neoclassical ballet commissioned and choreographed by George Balanchine for the Ballet Society in New York. Pianist Vicky Stylianou will be the soloist in this gem. Alkis Baltas describes his piece Music for Youth as “a composition addressed to those who always maintain a youthful temperament, regardless of their age!”\n\nThe highlight of the evening will surely be Cantus Arcticus or Concerto for birds and orchestra by Finnish composer Einojuhani Rautavaara, which will receive its Cyprus premiere. It is a highly original and evocative work that incorporates the recorded song of birds from the Arctic Circle.\n\nNicolas Economou: Four pieces from Childhood Whims (orch.: Alkis Baltas)\n\nPaul Hindemith: The Four Temperaments for solo piano and strings\n\nAlkis Baltas: Music for Youth\n\nEinojuhani Rautavaara: Cantus Arcticus “Concerto for birds and orchestra”, op. 61\n\n(Cyprus Premiere)\n\nVicky Stylianou – piano.

But why stop there? The disorder continues in the middle and in the end of the Bible too! The Bible: the complete word of God (Abridged) by Adam Long, Reed Martin and Austin Tichenor is a witty, hilarious comedy striving to understand “authentic stories” that we came across early on in history. Unquestionably, the work, which “falsifies the most significant story ever acknowledged as a fact” contains exceptional, surrealistically theatrical moments. In this play, the ultimate religious question is one and only: does God have a sense of humour? Undoubtedly yes. Otherwise, why would he leave the Children of Israel wonder around the Middle East for 40 years just to offer them a piece of land without oil?\n\nA barrage of images created by three actors-performers and a musician, in a show with singing, dancing and pondering on fundamental questions. “Should the Bible be interpreted literally”? Through comic situations, the four performers explore issues of religious freedom. A work reflecting on our responsibilities, our choices, limitations and freedom; reflecting on life itself.\n\nTo what extent have we been affected by the best-selling work of all times, even if we barely ever read it until the end?\n\nWritten by: Adam Long, Reed Martin, Austin Tichenor\n\nTranslated by: Errikos Belies\n\nDirected by: Eleni Anastasiou\n\nDramaturgy: Michalis Papadopoulos\n\nCast: Aris Kyprianou, Klitos Komodikis, Vassilis Pafitis\n\nMusician on stage: Savvas Chrysostomou\n\nSet design: Eleni Ioannou\n\nCostume design: Marina Nicolaidou\n\nLighting design: Carolina Spyrou\n\nMovement director: Ivie Hadjivassiliou\n\nTickets: €15 /10\n\n5 FRI 20:30 (70’)\n\nThe Shooting Ground – Michalis Papadopoulos Ι Solo for Three\n\nSolo for Three theatre group, in collaboration with Antilogos Theatre, presents the work of Michalis Papadopoulos titled The Shooting Ground. The play’s title is inspired by the “Shooting Range of Kaisariani”, a memorial site connected to the two hundred fighters who were executed in 1944 by the Nazis. The writer deliberately sets the plot in a flat near the Shooting Range to demonstrate how racism continues to pose a threat to places traditionally related to Resistance against fascism.\n\nThe plot is set in today’s world. Anna and Nicos, a couple in their late forties, are waiting for Costas, the artistic director of a festival, to promote Nicos’s most recent play. Nicos is a playwright and Anna is a TV news presenter. They have been together for years, in fact, for such a long time, that they grew weary of each other. Just before Costas arrives, their eighteen-year-old son (Aris) shows up, confessing that, together with his friend, they stabbed an immigrant, revealing that both are members of an extreme right-wing group. Aris’s confessions will shake the very foundation of the family and the couple’s existence. They will soon come to realise that they have not only been alienated from one another but also from their own child. Delving into their past, they will be urged to remember where they come from in order to draw strength and face the upcoming disaster. When the couple decides on their next steps, history seems to be repeating itself. While the couple is yet again waiting for Costas, Aris shows up, confessing this time that he has just been the victim of a homophobic incident. In this second version, the couple must fight against their prejudices as well as against homophobia, to continue co-existing with Aris.\n\nThe Shooting Ground tackles issues of homophobia and racism while also dealing with relationship and existential issues, with art and its evolution over time.\n\n​\n\nDirected by: Maria Mannaridou – Karsera\n\nSet & Costume Design: Thelma Kasoulidou\n\nMovement director: Eva Kalomiri\n\nMusic: Savvas Chrysostomou\n\nLighting design: Kyriakos Shiamptanis\n\nLight-sound operator: Raphael Adamou\n\nTechnical support: K.S.

When the gods travel to Szechwan in search of kind and generous souls, only Shen Teh is willing to take them in. To thank her, they offer her money - but only on condition that she continues doing good. Shen Teh manages to buy a small tobacco shop, which is quickly overrun by dozens of her fellow citizens, all with extravagant demands. They ask her for so much, in fact, that she is forced to invent an alter ego in order to keep her shop afloat. And so she transforms herself into her antithesis, a hard-hearted “cousin”, the businessman Shui Ta. But how long will she be able to endure this split identity?\n\n​\n\nDirector Kostas Silvestros immerses himself in the Brechtian universe in a production inspired by the ideals of the great writer and poet. He tells a story that resonates strongly in today's world, harnessing the energy and intensity of a diverse ensemble of experienced and younger actors, with Antonis Katsaris and Spyros Stavrinidis in the roles of the gods. The dual role of Shen Teh and Shui Ta is played by Marina Argyridou.\n\n​\n\nWith English & Turkish surtitles\n\n​\n\nTranslation: Anny Koltsidopoulou\n\nDirector: Kostas Silvestros\n\nSet design: Mariza Bargilly\n\nCostume design: Konstantina Andreou\n\nMusic: Thodoris Economou\n\nMovement & Choreography: Panayiotis Tofi\n\nEditing of lyrics: Stavros Stavrou\n\nMusic coach: Constantinos Andronikou\n\nLighting design: Georgios Koukoumas\n\nDirecting assistant: Irene Andronikou\n\nCast: Marina Argyridou, Giorgos Anagiotos, Giorgos Evagorou, Anthi Kasinou, Antonis Katsaris, Savvas Menoikou, Giannis Bisbikopoulos, Onisiforos Onisiforou, Spyros Stavrinidis, Penny Finiri, Marilia Haridimou, Yolanda Christodoulou, Varvara Christofi\n\nWith the participation of: Savvas Paisiou\n\n​\n\nTickets: € 12 / 6\n\n8 WED 20:30(45’)\n\nErroneous Encounters I Panayiotis Tofi\n\nThe new choreographic work Erroneous Encounters directed, choreographed, and written by Cypriot creator Panayiotis Tofi, is an experimental movement-based journey accompanied by the live composition of electronic music and poetic text. Four performers and a music composer share the stage in a course of negotiation with the post-traumatic as autoimmune, dysfunction, distance, and the multiple symbolisms of emptiness. The work is a continuation of the creator’s research in both movement vocabulary and composition, with which he focuses on topics of emptiness and concealment, as well as the loss of empathy and autonomy as a characteristic of contemporary reality.\n\nResearch, Direction, Choreography, Text: Panayiotis Tofi\n\nPerformance: Damianos Aggelos Efstathiou, Ioannis Mamolis, Nikos Samouridis, Vasiliki Kypraiou\n\nMusic Composition and Live Musician on Stage: Andreas Economides\n\nStage Set Design: Yiorgos Yiannou\n\nCostume Design: Rea Olympiou\n\nLighting Design: Vasilis Petinaris\n\nPhotography: Theodora Iacovou\n\nProduction - Visual Communication: Panayiotis Tofi\n\nPromo Trailer: Volume Films\n\nSpecial Thanks to Chorologie Dance Center, Panos Topsides\n\nThe choreographic work Erroneous Encounters is supported by the Deputy Ministry of Culture through the Terpsichore 2024 programme.\n\nPanayiotis Tofi\n\nA Trinity Laban graduate, holding a First Class BA in Contemporary Dance, and a Diploma in Dance studies.

He has collaborated as a movement director and choreographer in numerous theatre performances over the last eight years, alongside well-known directors from Cyprus, Greece, and Germany. In 2018, he received the ‘Creator of the Year’ award from the Cyprus Theatre Organisation at the Cyprus Theatre Awards for his artistic flexibility, ingenuity, and boldness towards experimentation.\n\nTickets: €12 / 10\n\n15 WED 20:00 (120’)\n\n25 Years Rialto Theatre\n\nStamatis Kraounakis\n\nOpening with Krama Brass Band\n\nForemost Greek composer and loyal friend of the Rialto, Stamatis Kraounakis, accompanied by an array of virtuoso instrumentalists, presents a special repertoire on the occasion of the Rialto Theatre’s 25th year anniversary. Musicians: Dimitrios Andreadis (piano, keys) | Nicos Katsikis (bouzouki), Lambros Papanicolaou (double bass).\n\nMessage by Stamatis Kraounakis\n\nEver since I remember myself in Cyprus, the Rialto has stood by me and my songs. It has been to us a warm embrace that have kept us alive and standing next to our beloved friends in this corner of the Mediterranean soul. I am delighted and honoured to participate in the celebrations for its 25th anniversary. A big thank you from the bottom of my heart to Georgia Doetzer for her support to this day, and all the best to the new director.\n\nKrama Brass Band was established in 2023 by two Cypriot musicians, Andreas Theocharous and Nicholas Georgiou, and consists of six wind instruments, a guitar and drums. Krama is inspired by the concept of combinaCon of elements and cultures: the alloy as a material of the brass instruments, and the blend of Mediterranean and Western music. Krama’s intention is the composition and performance of original music that combines traditional music of the Mediterranean region with Western music, with an emphasis on retaining the stylistic features of traditional music.\n\nNicholas Georgiou: Alto Saxophone, Marios Charalampous: Tenor Saxophone, Giorgos El Haber: Trumpet, Rafael Orfanidis: Trumpet, Vangelis Drouliskos: Trombone, Alexandros Adam: Guitar, Andreas Theocharous: Tuba, Nikolas Tsangaris: Drums\n\n​\n\nTickets: € 12 /10\n\n4 TUE 20:30 (60’) The Netherlands *\n\nThe End - part 2 I Arno Schuitemaker\n\nThe End - part 2 takes you to extremes. With an intriguing mix of movement, electronic music, light, and video, the performance explores a world of shifting relationships. What do togetherness, connection, and solidarity mean at this moment? What brings us closer to each other? How can mutual transparency strengthen interaction?\n\nThe hyperphysical performances by choreographer Arno Schuitemaker always make an overwhelming impression and are praised for the inventive forms he creates with themes where the intimate and the universal meet. In an equally exciting and subtle way, The End - part 2 blurs the difference between seeing and being seen. The performance feels like a collection of short stories in which energy, stillness, sensitivity, distortion, and longing confront each other. The three performers expose different sides of themselves and, ultimately, lift physical boundaries—even in opposition, our individual spaces can be shared.\n\nThe End - part 2 is a production by SHARP/ArnoSchuitemaker in co-production with La Place de la Danse - CDCN Toulouse/Occitanie as part of the “accueil studio” programme, CCN de Caen and Normandie as part of the “accueil studio” programme, and Montpellier Danse as part of the residency programme at I'Agora Cité Internationale de la Danse.

This makes him one of the most intriguing makers of the moment. A “must-see of the year”, as Scènes wrote about his previous performance 30 appearances out of darkness, the work premiered at the Holland Festival.

The ever-present barrage of human activity causes endless noise. In addition to silence, the capacity to listen also seems to be fading away. However, what is silence? What dimensions can it assume?\n\nIn their latest piece, the RootlessRoot duo create a world dedicated to silence and its power. They explore an unknown universe where silence communicates with all those listening carefully to it, with all those conversing with it and utilising what it has to offer to them. Silence is treated as an absolute condition, confronting those who participate in it with the mystery of their own selves and the world at large. Sometimes as a place of reflection, critical thinking, and memory, other times as a place of faith, prayer, and encounter with the divine, silence becomes the space for movement before the actual movement or action. Drawing material from philosophy, theology, poetry, literature, and painting, the duo investigates the condition of silence as a medium of self-knowledge and experiencing of the world. Via improvisations and exercises, the movement research will dictate the choreographic material and theatrical elements of this production.\n\nConcept & choreography: Linda Kapetanea, Jozef Fruček\n\nMusic composition: Vassilis Mantzoukis\n\nSet and costume design: Paris Mexis\n\nAssistant to the set and costume designer: Alegia Papageorgiou\n\nLighting design: Perikles Mathiellis\n\nSound design & sound engineer: Christos Parapagidis\n\nScientific associate: Kostas Vrachnos\n\nTexts edited by: Ioanna Nasiopoulou\n\nProps construction: Ilianna Skoulaki\n\nPhotographs: Elina Giounanli\n\nPerformers: Maria Bregianni, George Dereskos, Linda Kapetanea, Anastasis Karachanidis, Christos Strinopoulos, Alexandros Vardaxoglou\n\nExecutive production: POLYPLANITY Productions / Yolanda Markopoulou, Vicky Strataki\n\nExecutive production assistant: Nikos Charalampidis\n\nCo-production: Athens Epidaurus Festival, RootlessRoot\n\nFunded by the Hellenic Ministry of Culture and Sports\n\nRootlessRoot was founded by Linda Kapetanea and Jozef Fruček in Athens in 2006. Τhey have created 27 performances (solos, moving installations, medium and large-scale performances), which they have presented in more than 30 countries and in various theatres and festivals. They have collaborated with Akram Khan for his solo DESH, with the Staadsteater Kassel Dance Company, DOT504, the Helsinki Dance Company, and other companies and creators. In Greece, they have collaborated with the Onassis Stegi, the Athens and Epidaurus Festival, and the Greek National Opera Ballet. They are widely known for the Fighting Money Practice, which focuses on human motion/development and healthy aging, and which they teach worldwide.\n\nLinda Kapetanea, Artistic Director of the Kalamata Dance Festival, is a dancer, choreographer, and contemporary dance teacher, who has performed and taught worldwide. She graduated from the Greek National School of Dance and continued her training as a postgraduate student in New York, with a scholarship from the Greek State Scholarships Foundation. In 2002, she received the best performance award from the Hellenic Ministry of Culture. Between 2002 and 2006, she collaborated with the Ultima Vez dance company and Wim Vandekeybus on the performances Blush, Sonic Boom, and Puur and the films Blush and Here After. From 2006 to 2012, she taught at the Greek National School of Dance. In 2007, Kapetanea and Jozef Fruček founded the RootlessRoot dance company as a vehicle for their own artistic productions and research on human movement. They have since presented 26 works in more than 30 countries (in Europe, Asia, and North America) to international acclaim. Together with Fruček, Kapetanea developed the Fighting Μonkey Practice, which they teach in prestigious educational institutions in Greece and abroad.\n\nJozef Fruček has a background in professional sports, martial arts, and theatre, and has dedicated his professional life to the research of movement, which promotes personal development along with healthy aging. He studied at the Academy of Music and Drama Arts in Bratislava and later received a PhD in Voice and Movement. He has explored the aspects of effective communication, voice, and breathing for public speaking, performing arts, and psycho-hygiene. In 2006, together with Linda Kapetanea, he founded the RootlessRoot company and started implementing their research, Fighting Monkey Practice, which reflects their unique approach to human movement based on cross-motion analysis. He teaches and gives lectures at universities and various athletic and arts centres across Europe, the United States, Asia, and Australia.\n\nStrobe lighting effects are used during this performance for 4 minutes.\n\nhttps://rootlessroot.com/\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/rootlessroot_rtr/\n\nTickets: €8 (€30 for all performances)\n\nFree entrance to students, soldiers, pensioners and dance professionals.\n\n16 SUN Italy*\n\nAMAE I Eliana Stragapede and Borna Babić\n\n20:30 (30’)\n\nAMAE questions and investigates the need for co-dependency in human relationships. The desire to be passively loved, seeking the other’s indulgence. The wish to completely surround and feel at one with the other, trying to neglect and avoid confrontation with the outside objective reality. From a certain perspective, this might be perceived as a very warm and human behaviour, being in harmony with others and being able to rely on them. From another point of view, it might seem to encourage self-indulgence, dependence, and control. How far can this need bring us, so that from love we start hurting, from taking care we become obsessive, and from supporting we end up controlling?\n\nConcept, choreography, performance: Eliana Stragapede & Borna Babić Dramaturgy: Margherita Scalise\n\nMusic composition: Nenad Kovačić\n\nVoice: Teresa Campos\n\nOriginal music: Nicholas Britell\n\nAudio editing: Giuseppe Santoro\n\nCostumes: Nina Lopez-Le Galliard\n\nLighting design: Benjamin Verbrugge\n\n​\n\nEliana Stragapede and Borna Babić, both graduates of the Codarts, are freelance performers, choreographers, and teachers based in Brussels. Right after school, they both began working professionally with Marina Mascarell and Club Guy & Roni and since then, they have danced with renowned choreographers and companies. After working for Tanzmainz in Germany, Eliana has been part of the dance theatre company, Peeping Tom since 2020. Meanwhile, she has also been working with Club Guy & Roni in the Netherlands. Borna has been working with Olivier deSagazan, and he is part of Ultima Vez / Wim Vandekeybus since 2019.

It is a courtship dance originally performed by men only and dating back to the early 1900s: physically demanding, almost acrobatic, it requires that the dancers embrace each other, and whirl as they bend to their knees almost to the ground.\n\nThe work was created in collaboration with Giancarlo Stagni, a Filuzziani dance master who revived this ancient tradition thanks to the rediscovery and study of some documentation videos dating back to the 1960s. Sciarroni discovered this dance in December 2018, when only five people practiced it in Italy. For this reason, the project consists of a performance by the two dancers and a series of workshops that aim at spreading and reviving this popular tradition in danger of extinction.\n\nInvention: Alessandro Sciarroni with Gianmaria Borzillo & Giovanfrancesco Giannini\n\nArtistic collaboration: Giancarlo Stagni\n\nMusic: Aurora Bauzà e Pere Jou (Telemann Rec.)\n\nStyling: Ettore Lombardi\n\nTechnical direction: Valeria Foti\n\nTour technician: Cosimo Maggini\n\nCurator, promotion, consulting: Lisa Gilardino\n\nAdministration, executive production: Chiara Fava\n\nCommunication: Pierpaolo Ferlaino\n\nAlessandro Sciarroni is an Italian artist active in the field of Performing Arts with several years of experience in visual arts and theatre research. His works are featured in contemporary dance and theatre festivals, museums, and art galleries, as well as in unconventional spaces involving professionals from different disciplines. In 2019 he was awarded the Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement in Dance by the Venice Biennial. His work starts from a conceptual Duchamp-like matrix, making use of a theatrical framework, and he can use some techniques and experiences from dance, as well as circus or sports. In addition to the rigour, coherence, and clarity of each creation, his work tries to uncover obsessions, fears, and fragilities of the act of performing, through the repetition of a practice to the limits of the physical endurance of the interpreters, looking at a different dimension of time, and to an empathic relationship between the audience and the performers. His works have been presented worldwide: Europe, South and North America, the Middle East, and Asia. Among the main events he took part: the Biennale de la Danse in Lyon, Kunstenfestivaldesarts in Brussels, Impulstanz Festival in Wien, the Venice Biennale, the Festival d’Automne and the Festival Séquence Danse at 104 in Paris, Centrale Fies, Abu Dhabi Art Fair, Crossing The Line in New York, Hong Kong Art Festval, Juli Dans Festival in Amsterdam, TBA Festival Portland, Festival Panorama Rio de Janeiro. He exhibited his work at the Centre Pompidou in Paris, The Walker Art Center Minneapolis, Punta della Dogana-Palazzo Grassi in Venice and the MAXXI Museum in Rome. Alessandro Sciarroni is an associate artist of CENTQUATRE-Paris and Triennale Milano Teatro 2022-2024. His shows are produced by Marche Teatro in collaboration with various national and international co-production partners depending on the projects. Some of the historical partners are Centrale Fies, Comune di Bassano del Grappa – Centro per la Scena Contemporanea, Amat, la Biennale de la Danse – Maison de la Danse de Lyon, La Biennale di Venezia, Mercat de les Flors – Graner (Barcelona), Fondation d’Entreprise Hermèsin the frame of New Settings and the association corpoceleste_C.C.00# of which he is the artistic director.\n\nwww.alessandrosciarroni.it\n\n©Passages Transfestival-Metz 2023 | Photo: Raoul Gilibert\n\nTickets: €8 (€30 for all performances)\n\nFree entrance to students, soldiers, pensioners and dance professionals.\n\n23 SUN 20:30 (60’) Greece*\n\nLarsen C - Christos Papadopoulos\n\nLarsen C: a work of art in movement inspired by the slowness of melting glaciers in order to speak of the fierceness of life.\n\n“Glacier” or “ice shelf”. This is the scientific name of the enormous, 10,000-year-old immobile body of Larsen C water in Antarctica. Larsen C, twice the size of Wales, moves so slowly that it cannot be detected by the human senses. It is as if the pulse of its movement were absorbed by space and time. In Christos Papadopoulos’ namesake choreography, human bodies resonate to the same perpetual rhythm, in a dreamlike sequence where they progressively appear as eerie as the polar landscape. Christos Papadopoulos becomes, yet again, an observer of the movement of the minimum which, in its interiority and repetition, produces life. Larsen C is a party in homage to the silent transition of bodies. It is “a metaphor”, as the choreographer himself states, “of life that goes on invincible.”\n\n​\n\nConcept & choreography: Christos Papadopoulos\n\nCast: Maria Bregianni, Georgios Kotsifakis, Sotiria Koutsopetrou, Tasos Nikas, Alexandros Nouskas-Varelas, Ioanna Paraskevopoulou\n\nMusic & sound design: Giorgos Poulios\n\nSet design: Clio Boboti\n\nLighting design: Eliza Alexandropoulou\n\nCostume design: Angelos Mentis\n\nDramaturgy consultant: Alexandros Mistriotis\n\nChoreography consultant: Martha Pasakopoulou\n\nAssistant set designer: Filanthi Bougatsou\n\nProduction management: Rena Andreadaki, Zoe Mouschi\n\nTour lighting head: Alexandros Mavridis\n\nSet and sound technician: Marilena Kalaitzantonaki, Aggeliki Vassilopoulou Kampitsi, Stefi Elettra Pantavos\n\nTour manager: Konstantina Papadopoulou\n\nInternational Distribution: KeyPerformance\n\nChristos Papadopoulos studied Dance and Choreography at SNDO (School for New Dance Development) in Amsterdam, Theatre at the Drama School of Greece’s National Theatre, and Political Sciences in Athens. He is a founding member of the dance group The Lion and the Wolf. His first works, Opus and Elvedon, received critical acclaim when presented at the Porta Theatre in Greece. Elvedon was the first choice of Aerowaves 2016 and was later presented in Paris, Amsterdam, and other European cities. Opus was chosen by Aerowaves 2018, and soon after began its international tour. Ion (2018), commissioned by Onassis Stegi and co-produced by Théâtre de la Ville, Paris, and Le Lieu Unique, Nantes, continues to tour successfully. Larsen C (2021), an international co-production, has already been presented to more than 25 venues and festivals across Europe. In 2023, he created the work Mellowing for the prestigious dance company Dance On and, later on, Mycelium for the Lyon Opera Ballet and the Biennale de la Danse Lyon. These works are touring worldwide. In June, Christos Papadopoulos will present a solo piece for Georgios Kotsifakis – LAC Lugano Arte e Cultura and, in September 2024, a new work for NDT 1.

Starting with a delicate duo of piano and violin, IMAGO invites the audience to feel and embrace the subtle journey portrayed in dance.\n\nThrough twelve ever-changing chapters, IMAGO depicts a profound journey of two men as they navigate environments of duplicity, denial, and acceptance, culminating in an ending left for the audience to determine. IMAGO brings to light our nature to obscure the truth with beauty, in fear of being hurt or in fear of having to accept.\n\nA deeply moving and insightful exploration of the human condition that will leave a pondering on its themes long after the performance has ended. Its triad of a compelling narrative, stirring original score by Sean Pett, and electrifying dance performance make IMAGO a\n\ngripping experience for audiences within and beyond the dance field.\n\nChoreography & performance: Travis Clausen-Knight & James Pett\n\nComposer & Musician: Sean Pett\n\nPremiere: November 2022\n\nAbout: James Pett & Travis Clausen-Knight, founders of PCK Dance, are accomplished choreographers and dancers with successful individual careers in prestigious companies like Company Wayne McGregor, Michael Clarke Company & Richard Alston Dance Company.
