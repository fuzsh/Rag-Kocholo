the Japanese flag was raised and the national anthem played, the sport's uncertain future was -- for a moment -- pushed into the background.\n\nSince the softball was introduced in 1996 at the Atlanta Games, the Americans had ruled supreme over the Olympic diamond, no other country having set foot on the top perch of the podium.\n\nThe U.S. roared into Thursday's gold medal game unbeaten in 22 Olympic contests, a streak of dominance stretching all the way back to the 2000 Sydney Olympics.\n\nAugust 21, 2008\n\nCzech Spotakova takes women's javelin gold Barbora Spotakova of the Czech Republic won the women's javelin gold medal on Thursday with a dramatic last throw of 71.42 metres.\n\nThe world champion overtook Russian Maria Abakumova whose 70.78 metre throw proved only to be good enough for a silver medal.\n\nGermany's Christina Obergfoll took the bronze medal with her throw of 66.13 metres.\n\nCuba Osleidys Menendez, the 2004 gold medallist and world record holder, was never in serious contention for a medal.\n\nAugust 21, 2008\n\nUS men drop baton in 4x100m relay The US men's 4 x100 meters relay team failed to qualify for the Olympic final after dropping the baton in their heat on Thursday.\n\nVictory seemed a formality as Darvis Patton approached Tyson Gay on the final changeover but the pair made a mess of it and the baton tumbled to the floor.\n\nThe US were chasing their 16th gold medal in the 4x100m relay and were hoping to make up for Athens four years ago when they were surprisingly beaten by Britain.\n\nGay has endured a miserable Olympics after also failing to reach the 100 meters final.\n\nMedal prospects Nigeria also failed to get the baton round along with South Africa and Poland.\n\nAugust 21, 2008\n\nDutch beat US to win women's water polo gold The Netherlands won the gold medal in the women's water polo competition on Thursday, scoring a goal in the last minute to beat the United States 9-8.\n\nDanielle de Bruijn masterminded the Dutch victory with seven goals and her teammates managed to resist fierce pressure from the Americans in the dying seconds to become Olympic champions for the first time.\n\nThe unheralded Dutch side raced to a four-goal lead within the first four minutes of the encounter, stunning the United States who were one of the tournament favorites and had been confident of victory.\n\nEarlier, Australia took the bronze medal by beating Hungary 12-11 after a penalty shoot out.\n\nAugust 21, 2008\n\nGermany win women's football bronze Substitute Fatmire Bajramaj scored twice to give World champions Germany a 2-0 win over Japan in the women's soccer bronze medal match on Thursday.\n\nBajramaj put Germany ahead in the 69th minute, 10 minutes after coming on, when she snapped up a rebound to score from a narrow angle after Miho Fukumoto saved a Kerstin Garefrekes header.\n\nThree minutes from time, she cut inside her marker and drilled home Germany's second.\n\nBrazil plays the United States in the final later in the evening.\n\nAugust 21, 2008\n\nGermany in men's hockey final Germany beat the Netherlands 6-5 in sudden death on Thursday to move into the final of the men's hockey conmpetition at the Beijing Olympics.\n\nThe teams were locked 1-1 after extra-time.\n\nGermany will take on the winners of the other semi-final between Australia and Spain.\n\nAugust 21, 2008\n\nVeronica Campbell-Brown wins women's 200m Veronica Campbell-Brown won the women's 200m in 21.74s on Thursday.\n\nAmerican Allyson Felix took silver and another Jamaican Kerron Stewart took bronze.\n\nThe win completed Jamaica's clean sweep in the sprint events but failed to repeat the women's 100m achievement, where Jamaica took all three places.\n\nCampbell-Brown's timing was, however, well short of the Olympic and world mark of 21.34s set by American Florence Griffith-Joyner in Seoul in 1988.\n\nWomen's 200m final result:\n\n1. Veronica Campbell-Brown (Jamaica) 21.74 seconds\n\n2. Allyson Felix (U.S.) 21.93\n\n3. Kerron Stewart (Jamaica) 22.00\n\n4. Muna Lee (US) 22.01\n\n5. Marshevet Hooker (US) 22.34\n\n6.

George Gogshelidze of Georgia and Khetag Gazyumov of Azerbaijan won bronze medals.\n\nTopping a weight class dominated by wrestlers from former Soviet republics, Mradov, the 2007 European champion, beat Tigiev 3-0.\n\nAugust 21, 2008\n\nSandeep falls short of winning medal for Australia Sandeep Kumar's dream of winning a medal for his adopted country remained unrealised with the Delhi-born Melbourne cabbie losing his repechage round battle in the 84kg freestyle event of the Beijing Olympics on Thursday.\n\nSandeep, who had Daleep Singh -- known in the WWF circle as 'The Great Khali' -- as his colleague in his Punjab Police days, lost his first round bout against Yusup Abdusalomov.\n\nBut with the world number two grappler from Tajikistan reaching the final, the repechage door opened for the 25-year-old.\n\nSandeep got a bye in the repechage round one before running into Ukrainian Taras Danko, who thwarted his medal bid by beating him in the second round.\n\nAugust 21, 2008\n\nPakistan finish eighth in Olympic hockey Former Olympic champions Pakistan recorded their worst-ever finish in the men's hockey at the Olympic Games on Thursday.\n\nThe Asian giants finished eighth among twelve teams when they was emphatically beaten 4-2 by New Zealand in the seventh-eighth place classification.\n\nThey had previously finished fifth in the Olympics  at Athens in 2004 and at Seoul in 1988.\n\nPakistan had reached at least the top four in 11 of the 13 Olympics it contested between 1948 and 2000, winning gold three times.\n\nAugust 21, 2008\n\nWrestler Rajiv Tomar fails to qualify Wrestler Rajiv Tomar lost his 120kg freestyle qualification round bout in Beijing Olympics on Thursday.\n\nTomar lost to Steve Mocco of the United States at the Chinese Agricultural University Gymnasium.\n\nAugust 21, 2008\n\nDutchman Van der Weijden wins 10km Maarten van der Weijden, who was given only a slim chance of survival after being diagnosed with leukemia, won one of the Olympics most grueling events on Thursday when he took gold in the men's 10km open water marathon.\n\nDutchman Van der Weijden was diagnosed with leukemia seven years ago but pulled through after a stem cell transplant and a course of chemotherapy.\n\nHe battled back to become the world's leading open water swimmer and added the Olympic title to his world crown with a sprint finish to win a thrilling inaugural 10km Games race after a three-man fight for gold which lasted nearly two hours.\n\nWith the end in sight, Van der Weijden pulled out from a three-way dogfight and charged past Briton David Davies to win in one hour 51 minutes 51 seconds.\n\nDavies, who led for most of the race, looked destined to win gold after streaking two body lengths clear in the last 400 meters but he had no answer to the 27-year-old Dutchman's stunning sprint finish.\n\nSwimming in only his third open water race, Davies finished two seconds behind Van der Weijden, with German Thomas Lurz taking bronze.\n\nAugust 21, 2008\n\nRussia's Kaniskina wins 20km walk Russia's Olga Kaniskina led from the start and battled through relentless rain to win Olympic gold in the women's 20-kilometre walk on Thursday.\n\nWorld champion Kaniskina jumped to the lead on her first step and slowly pulled away from the pack as she built a decisive one-minute lead going into the final kilometers to finish in an Olympic record of one hour, 26 minutes and 31 seconds.\n\nNorway's Kjersti Platzer finished second with a 36-second deficit, while Italy's Elisa Rigaudo took bronze after a late surge brought her back

beach volleyball gold medal on Thursday.\n\nTian and Wang fought back from a hefty deficit at the start of the second set and for a while went point-to-point but it was not enough to get past the triple world champions who eventually won 21-18 21-18.\n\nAugust 20, 2008\n\nBolt completes a historic double Jamaica's 100m champion Usain Bolt added the 200m title to his list of achievements on Wednesday, winning the Olympics final in 19.30 secs, a world record, beating Michael Johnson's timing of 19.32s.\n\nBolt, a day short of his 22nd birthday, completed the first Olympic sprint double in 24 years at the Bird's Nest stadium.\n\nBolt, who dominated the 100m final with a world record time (9.69s), had said prior to the race that he thought the double last achieved by American icon Carl Lewis at Los Angeles in 1984 was on the cards, and that he had another spectacular performance in him.\n\nBolt held the three fastest 200m times this season going into the race.\n\nDefending champion Shawn Crawford of USA, who once raced a giraffe and a zebra for a TV show, failed to repeat his Athens feat, finishing third in 19.96s.\n\nChurandy Martina (19.82s) of the Netherlands Antilles was second after the United States' Spearmon Wallace was disqualified for cutting lanes.\n\nAugust 20, 2008\n\nVijender Kumar ensures another medal for India India's Vijender Kumar beat Carlos Gongora of Ecuador 9-4 in the quarter-finals of the 75kg middleweight category of the boxing event on Wednesday to guarantee India another medal at the Beijing Olympics.\n\nVijender had a good start, winning the opening round 2-0. He also pocketed the second round 2-1. The third also went his way 3-2 and so did the fourth 2-1.\n\nVijender stormed into the last eight after overwhelming Angkhan Chomphuphuang of Thailand 13-3 in a lop-sided pre-quarter-final bout on Saturday night.\n\nEarlier, he thoroughly dominated his opening bout against Gambia's Jack Badou, scoring a facile 13-2 win.\n\nAugust 20, 2008\n\nHeptathlon silver medallist Blonska fails drugs test Ukraine's Liudmyla Blonska, the heptathlon silver medallist, has failed a drugs test, the IOC said on Wednesday.\n\nThe 30-year-old's A sample tested positive for a banned substance, but the results of the B sample are still awaited.\n\nThe Ukrainian had already served a previous ban for testing positive in 2003 for stanozolol.\n\nBlonska now faces a life ban for the latest offence.\n\nShould Blonska be stripped of her medal, the silver would go to American Hyleas Fountain while Tatiana Chernova of Russia would get the bronze.\n\nAugust 20, 2008\n\nJitender Kumar follows Akhil Kumar's route India's Jitender Kumar lost to Russian pugilist Georgy Balakshin in the 51kg flyweight category in the Olympics boxing competition on Wednesday.\n\nAfter falling behind 2-1 in the opening round, Jitender came back well in the second to end even on points (5-5). But the Russian pulled clear in the third, taking a 13-8 lead. Though Jitender made a good comeback in the fourth, but the Russian eventually won 15-11.\n\nThe Asian Championship bronze medallist had defeated Uzbek rival Tulashboy Doniyorov by 13-6 in the pre-quarter-finals on Saturday.\n\nEarlier, Jitender, making his Olympic debut, had pummelled his Turkish opponent Ulas Furkan Memis in less than three rounds in the opening round.\n\nAugust 20, 2008\n\nRussia's \"two Anastasias\" golden again Russia's reigning Olympic champions, the \"two Anastasias\", defended their synchronised swimming duet gold medal on Wednesday with an almost perfect routine.\n\nAnastasia Davydova and Anastasia Ermakova, undefeated at a major championships since finishing second at the 2001 worlds, scored a perfect 10 for technical merit from all five judges and earned another three 10s for artistic impression.\n\nAdded to a commanding lead from Monday's technical routine, they easily claimed victory with 99.251 points, bagging a second gold medal for a collection started in Athens.\n\nSpain's Gemma Mengual and Andrea Fuentes won silver, their country's first medal in the sport, with a second-placed free routine that won the only other perfect 10 of the final.\n\nJapan's Saho Harada and Emiko Suzuki came in third, narrowly edging Chinese twin hopefuls Jiang Tingting and Jiang Wenwen who were aiming for the host nation's first medal.\n\nAugust 20, 2008\n\nWrestler Sushil Kumar wins bronze Sushil Kumar gave India its second medal at the Beijing Olympics when he won the bronze medal in the men's 66 kg freestyle event, beating Leonid Spiridonov of Kazakhstan.\n\nRamazan Shahin of Turkey took the gold, defeating Ukraine's Andry Stadnik in the final.\n\nAugust 20, 2008\n\n36 world records broken in Beijing The Beijing Olympic Games have seen 36 world records and 74 Olympic records broken, statistics as of August 19 show.\n\nWang Wei, executive vice-president and secretary-general of BOCOG, made the announcement at an IOC/BOCOG joint press conference on Wednesday, August 20.\n\nHe said that as of August 19, 14 events out of the 38 disciplines of the 28 Olympic sports have been completed, including Artistic Gymnastics, Trampoline, Fencing, Archery, Tennis, Shooting, Track Cycling, Road Cycling, Rowing, Canoe/Kayak Slalom, Triathlon, Judo, Weightlifting and Badminton.\n\nAugust 20, 2008\n\nZubari wins Israel's first Beijing medal 2008 world champion Tom Ashley of New Zealand won gold in the Men's RS:X (Windsurfer) with 52 overall points, just one point better than second-place finisher Julien Bontemps of France.\n\nShahar Zubari of Israel finished second in the medal race to grab bronze with 58 points overall and give Israel's its first medal of the Beijing Olympic Games.\n\nAugust 20, 2008\n\nMaradona slams 'stingy' Brazil Diego Maradona said he had rarely seen Brazil play as negatively as they did in their Olympic Games semi-final defeat to Argentina.\n\n\"It's a long time since I've seen Brazil so stingy and defensive,\" the former Argentina captain was quoted in his country's media as saying.\n\n\"I didn't think they could do any damage. They never managed to play their way out of defence, nobody helped Ronaldinho and they never played coherently. I think Argentina were better in every metre of the field.\"\n\nMaradona watched Tuesday's 3-0 win at the Workers' stadium. He has also been to see Argentina's men's basketball and women's hockey teams in action in Beijing.\n\nAugust 20, 2008\n\nBrazil beach volleyball champs out of semis Defending champions Ricardo Santos and Emanuel Rego were knocked out of the Olympic beach volleyball on Wednesday, leaving fellow Brazilians Marcio Araujo and Fabio Luiz Magalhaes to play the US favorites for gold.\n\nMarcio and Fabio Luiz, the 2005 world champions, have been in sporadic form in Beijing but pulled it all together in the semi, winning 22-20 21-18.

She donned a half-gold, half-red jacket before being towed up and down the main breakwater to take the applause from a large gathering of Chinese fans.\n\nThe 38-year-old Sensini took silver to add to her gold in Sydney in 2000 and bronze in 1996 and 2004 and has now won more Olympic sailing medals than any other woman. Briton Bryony Shaw won bronze.\n\nAugust 20, 2008\n\nAmputee Du Toit completes marathon swimming In an historic day for the Olympics, the first amputee to compete at the Games, Natalie du Toit of South Africa finished 16th in the women's 10km marathon swimming on Wednesday.\n\nA promising swimmer from South Africa, du Toit lost her left leg below the knee in a scooter accident in 2001.\n\nAugust 20, 2008\n\nRussia's Larisa Ilchenko wins marathon swimming Russia's Larisa Ilchenko swam in the slipstream of two pace-setting Britons for nearly two hours before producing a perfectly timed sprint finish to win gold in the inaugural women's 10km marathon swimming on Wednesday.\n\nIlchenko powered past leaders Cassie Patten and Keri-Anne Payne with 100 metres to go, clocking one hour 59 minutes 27 seconds to become the first Olympic gold medallist in the event.\n\nThe three-times world champion swam a tactical race, riding in the wake of the leaders before darting past them with the finish in sight.\n\nPayne took the silver medal in one hour 59 minutes 29 seconds and Patten was third in one hour 59 minutes 31 seconds.\n\nAugust 20, 2008\n\nSharath Kamal loses in second round India's Achanta Sharath Kamal left it for too late as he was knocked out by Austria's Weixing Chen from the men's singles table tennis competiton at the Beijing Olympics.\n\nSharath Kamal staged a fightback in the fourth game but eventually went down 5-11, 12-14, 2-11, 11-8, 10-12 to the experienced Chen in the second round on Wednesday.\n\nAugust 20, 2008\n\nBolt guns for Olympic sprint double Usain Bolt takes aim at becoming the first man in 24 years to win the Olympic sprint double when he runs in the 200 metres final on Wednesday.\n\nThe day before his 22nd birthday, the Jamaican is strong favourite to add the half-lap crown to the 100 metres title he so sensationally won in world record time on Saturday.\n\nThe 200 is Bolt's speciality. He is the fastest man this year and would have been the man to beat even before his stunning success in the shorter sprint.\n\nBolt's personal best is the 19.67 seconds he clocked in Athens last month but, given the way he has been running in Beijing, an assault on Michael Johnson's 12-year-old world record of 19.32 is not out of the question.\n\nWorld champion Tyson Gay's injury at the US trials meant he failed to qualify for the event in Beijing so defending champion Shawn Crawford should lead the American challenge.\n\nAugust 20, 2008\n\nArgentina beat Brazil to reach final Argentina beat arch rivals Brazil 3-0 to reach the final of the football competition at the Beijing Olympics on Tuesday.\n\nThe defending champions will face African powerhouse Nigeria in the decider.\n\nAfter a goalless but interesting opening half, Sergio Aguero gave Argentina the lead in the 52nd minute.\n\nThe 20-year-old, who plays for Atletico Madrid in Spain, scored his second just six minutes later.\n\nCaptain Juan Roman Riquelme slotted home a penalty in the 76th minute to put the result beyond doubt.\n\nBrazil finished the match withe nine men.\n\nEarlier, a goal in the first half and three in the second put 1996 Atlanta Olympic champions Nigeria into the final as they thrashed minnows Belgium 4-1.\n\nAugust 20, 2008\n\nOhuruogu wins 400 gold for Britain Christine Ohuruogu won the women's 400 metres on Tuesday to provide Britain with their first athletics gold medal at the Beijing Games.\n\nThe 24-year-old came from behind to cross the line first in 49.62 seconds, adding the Olympic crown to the world title she won in Japan last year.\n\nShericka Williams of Jamaica was second in 49.69 and American Sanya Richards finished third in 49.93.\n\nOhuruogu was set to miss the Games after the British Olympic Association banned her from competing at the Olympics following three missed doping tests. She won an appeal, however, allowing her to take part after serving a 12-month suspension.\n\nAugust 20, 2008\n\nSteiner wins strongest man title German weightlifter Matthias Steiner, who promised his dying wife to fight his way to the Olympics, won gold in the men's super-heavyweight class on Tuesday.\n\nChoking back the tears, Steiner held up a photo of his late wife Susann as he stood on the winner's podium. She died in a car crash last year.\n\nSteiner snatched 203kg, a weight far below his closest competitors, but he raised his weights dramatically for his final lift in the clean and jerk and hoisted up 258kg.\n\nHe claimed the title of strongest man in the world with a total of 461kg -- just one kilo more than Russia's Evgeny Chigishev, who took silver.\n\nLatvian politician and weightlifter Viktors Scerbatihs won the bronze in the over 105kg class.\n\nAugust 20, 2008\n\nJohnson finally gets gold on beam Shawn Johnson's megawatt smile lit up the National Indoor Stadium on Tuesday after the American gymnast finally got her hands on an Olympic gold medal.\n\nThe 16-year-old outshone rivals Nastia Liukin and Cheng Fei with her deft footwork on the balance beam to end a run of three silver-medal winning performances in Beijing.\n\nShe had been expected to go home with a stash of gold after picking up three titles at the world championships in 2007. But she had to wait until the final day of the gymnastics competition to make her mark at the Games, with a score of 16.225.\n\nShe edged out fellow American and all-round champion Liukin by 0.200 of a point, while Cheng of China took bronze with 15.950.\n\nJohnson kept her poise on the beam while performing a series of solid twists and flips and was rewarded for packing her routine with a series of difficult elements.\n\nAugust 20, 2008\n\nBritain equal century old record Britain notched their highest gold medal tally in a century on Tuesday with two more victories in cycling and one in sailing for the 2012 Olympics hosts.\n\nThat cemented Britain's unexpected third place in China, with 15 golds the best since the 1908 London Games and the perfect way to fire up enthusiasm at home for the next Olympics.\n\nNowhere have the Britons been cockier than on bikes.\n\nChris Hoy and Victoria Pendleton won a couple more golds in the men's and women's sprints, making it a remarkable eight Beijing golds on road and track for the new cycling superpower.\n\nAugust 20, 2008\n\nNigeria in men's football final Nigeria entered the final of the Olympics men's football tournament after a 4-1 victory over Belgium on Tuesday evening.\n\nThey take on the winners of the second semi-final between Brazi and Argentina, which will be played later on Tuesday.\n\n1996 champions Nigeria were just too good for Belgium, who had upset former champions Italy in the quarter-finals.\n\nAugust 20, 2008\n\nAmerican Tunnicliffe wins Laser Radial American Anna Tunnicliffe won Olympic gold in the Laser Radial sailing on Tuesday to confirm her status as world number one.\n\nGintare Volungeviciute of Lithuania secured silver and China's Xu Lijia grabbed bronze, the host nation's first medal of the regatta.\n\nThe British-born Tunnicliffe, 25, was struggling in the medal race until benefiting from a large windshift that propelled her from ninth to third by the third mark.\n\nAugust 20, 2008\n\nCejudo wins freestyle wrestling gold Henry Cejudo of the United States won the Olympic gold medal in the men's 55kg freestyle wrestling on Tuesday.\n\nJapan's Tomohiro Matsunaga won the silver.

Fans in Beijing's Bird's Nest stadium looked stunned and volunteers were seen openly weeping.\n\nKenya's Jelimo wins women's 800m gold\n\nKenyan Pamela Jelimo added a golden lustre to her all-conquering season when she won the women's Olympic 800 metres in great style on Monday.\n\nJelimo, 18, has ruled the race in the big European meetings this year and was in unstoppable form after hitting the front at halfway.\n\nShe drove home to win easily in one minute 54.87 seconds ahead of team mate Janeth Jepkosgei Busienei, with Morocco's Hasna Benhassi taking bronze.\n\nWomen's 800m final result:\n\n1. Pamela Jelimo (Kenya) 1 minute 54.87 seconds\n\n2. Janeth Jepkosgei Busienei (Kenya) 1:56.07\n\n3. Hasna Benhassi (Morocco) 1:56.73\n\n4. Svetlana Klyuka (Russia) 1:56.94\n\n5.

Tatiana Andrianova (Russia) 2:02.63\n\nKenyan Kipruto takes steeplechase\n\nBrimin Kiprop Kipruto held on for victory in the Olympic men's 3,000m steeplechase on Monday to retain Kenya's 24-year iron grip on the event.\n\nThe 23-year-old, a silver medallist in Athens four years ago, held off a surprise final-lap charge from Frenchman Mahiedine Mekhissi-Benabbad to win in 8 minutes 10.34 seconds.\n\nMekhissi-Benabbad outsprinted Richard Kipkemboi Mateelong after the final jump to claim silver in a personal best 8.10.49 and the Kenyan had to be content with bronze in 8.11.01.\n\nThe last non-Kenyan to win the event was Pole Bronislaw Malinowski who took gold at the 1980 Moscow Games which the Kenyans boycotted.\n\nBolt strolls through second round\n\nUsain Bolt negotiated the next step in his bid to win both Olympic sprints when he strolled through the second round of the 200 meters on Monday.\n\nBolt, who coasted to 20.64 seconds in his morning heat, was marginally faster at 20.29 in the second round but he was in cruise mode for the last 70 meters in both races.\n\nThings did not go so well for Jamaican compatriot Marvin Anderson, however, who pulled up injured in his heat.\n\nThe US trio of defending champion Shawn Crawford, Wallace Spearmon and 100 meters bronze medalist Walter Dix also went through comfortably.\n\nZimbabwe's Brian Dzingai again looked impressive as the fasted qualifier in 20.23 and Paul Hession maintained Ireland's push for an unlikely medal when he won his heat in 20.32.\n\nThe semi-finals are on Tuesday and final on Wednesday.\n\nMen's 200m quarter-finals results:\n\nQuarter-final 1\n\n1.

He was beaten by Republic of Moldovas Veaceslav Gojan 10-3 in the quarter-final in Beijing on Monday.\n\nThe Indian, who upset Russian world champion Sergey Vodopyanov in the earlier round, was at the receiving end for most of the contest.\n\nAfter a reasonably good first two round, the Indian was unable to break through the defences of his opponent and paid the price in the last two in which the Maldovan scored heavily.\n\nResults men's bantamweight quarter-final:\n\nBadar-Uugan Enkhbat (Mongolia) beat Khumiso Ikgopoleng (Botswana) 15-2; Veaceslav Gojan (Moldova) beat Akhil Kumar (India) 10-3; Bruno Julie (Mauritius) beat Hector Rangel Manzanilla (Venezuela) 13-9; Yankiel Leon (Cuba) beat Worapoj Petchkoom (Thailand) 10-2.\n\nPole Blanik wins men's vault gold\n\nPoland's Leszek Blanik somersaulted with style to scoop the men's vault gold at the Olympics on Monday, beating second-placed Thomas Bouhail of France on the tiebreak rule.\n\nThe world champion's two vaults earned an average score of 16.537 points, the same as Bouhail, but based on a complicated system of averages relating to points awarded for execution Blanik triumphed.\n\nRussia's Anton Golotsutskov won his second bronze of the Games after picking one up in Sunday's floor final.\n\nTop qualifier Marian Dragulescu of Romania had looked to be heading for gold after notching the highest score of the day of 16.800 for his first vault before landing his second one sprawled out on the mat to finish fourth.\n\nBouhail's was France's second gymnastics medal of the Olympics after Benoit Caranobe's surprise bronze in the all-around. Caranobe put himself out of the running for another medal when he landed his second vault on his bottom.\n\nIt was the only apparatus final to feature no Chinese gymnasts, who have dominated the rest of the events.\n\nAugust 18, 2008\n\nChina's Chen wins gold in men's rings\n\nChen Yibing of China won the Olympic gold medal in the men's gymnastics rings on Monday.\n\nYang Wei of China won the silver and Oleksandr Voribiov of Ukraine the bronze.\n\nAugust 18, 2008\n\nBritain wins gold in men's cycling team pursuit\n\nBritain overpowered Denmark to win the Olympic gold medal in the men's team pursuit cycling on Monday, shattering its own one-day-old world record by more than two seconds.\n\nIn the bronze medal race New Zealand took an early lead to beat out Australia, who were racing without veteran pursuit rider Bradley McGee, for the bronze.\n\nPursuit ace Bradley Wiggins, who already won the individual pursuit and is biding for three golds, helped lead Britain to the new record with an average speed of 61.7 km per hour.\n\nBritain was clearly aiming for a new record, setting off at a blistering pace. Denmark never came close to matching it and the margin between the two teams grew throughout the 16-lap race.\n\nAugust 18, 2008\n\nGold medal sweep for Australia in 470\n\nDespite a ninth-place finish in the medal race, Australia's Elise Rechichi and Tessa Parkinson won the second 470 (Two Person Dinghy) gold of the Olympics with 43 points overall, matching the gold won by the Australian Men's 470 pair just one hour earlier.\n\nRechichi and Parkinson went into the final race with an 18-point lead over Marcelien de Koning and Lobke Berkhout of the Netherlands, who finished sixth in the medal race and won silver with 53 points overall.\n\nFernanda Oliviera and Isabel Swan of Brazil won the medal race and the bronze medal with 60 net points.\n\nAugust 18, 2008\n\nAussies men win gold in 470 Two Person Dinghy\n\nWith disqualification the only thing standing in the way of gold for Nathan Wilmot and Malcolm Page of Australia in the men's 470 (Two Person Dinghy), the pair put an exclamation mark on their victory by finishing first in the medal race.\n\nWilmot and Page, who won the 2004, 2005, and 2007 World Champions but had never won at the Olympics, took over first place after the third race and never looked back, building an insurmountable 22 point lead before the final race and winning with 44 points overall.\n\nNick Rogers and Joe Glanfield of Great Britain jumped from fourth to second (75 net points) after a third-place finish in the medal race and Nicolas Charbonnier and Olivier Bausset of France (78 points) held off Sven and Kalle Coster of the Netherlands for bronze with a better finish on the final day of racing.\n\nAugust 18, 2008\n\nRenjith Maheswary performs below par\n\nIndian athlete Renjith Maheswary jumped much lower than his best and finished last among the 18 finishers in Group B of the Triple Jump qualifying round of the Olympic track and field competition on Monday.\n\nRenjith's jump of 15.77m, which he achieved in his first attempt, was much below then his personal best of 17.04 meters. It placed him overall 35th in a field of 37th finishers.\n\nBritain's Phillips Idowu with 17.44m topped the field and the last qualifier was Ukrain's Victor Kuznyetsov who had a jump of 17.09m.\n\nMen's Triple Jump Group A and B results:\n\nGroup A:\n\n1.
