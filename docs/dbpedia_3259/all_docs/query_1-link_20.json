Insulin-induced capillary recruitment (IICR) is considered a significant determinant of IMGU. We investigated whether IICR is a determinant IMGU in obese and lean women with and without PCOS. The study included 36 women with PCOS (20 lean, BMI 21.9 Â± 2.3 kg/m(2) and 16 obese, BMI 35.9 Â± 6.0 kg/m(2)) and 27 age-matched healthy controls (14 lean, BMI 22.2 Â± 1.8 kg/m(2) and 13 obese, BMI 40.5 Â± 7.0 kg/m(2)). IICR was evaluated by capillary microscopy during an isoglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp. IMGU was expressed as M/I value. The M/I value was significantly lower in obese PCOS women compared with obese controls [0.5 (0.2-1.1) versus 0.8 (0.3-1.4) (mg kg(-1) min(-1) pmol l(-1)) Ã 100, P < 0.01], whereas the small difference between lean PCOS and lean control women was non-significant [1.5 (0.5-2.6) versus 1.7 (1.0-3.7) (mg kg(-1) min(-1) pmol l(-1)) Ã 100, P = 0.17]. Hyperinsulinemia increased capillary recruitment in lean controls (53.5 Â± 20.3 versus 64.9 Â± 27.4 n/mm(2), P < 0.05), but not in either PCOS group nor in obese controls. IICR and androgens were a determinant of M/I value only in lean women with or without PCOS. PCOS per se is associated with impaired IICR. Obese women with PCOS, in part independent of obesity, demonstrated a profound insulin resistance, whereas the difference between lean PCOS women and healthy controls was small and statistically non-significant. IICR was a determinant of IMGU in lean, but not in obese, women regardless of the presence of PCOS.\n\nInfluence of PCOS in Obese vs. Non-Obese women from Mesenchymal Progenitors Stem Cells and Other Endometrial Cells: An in silico biomarker discovery.\n\nPubMed\n\nDesai, Ashvini; Madar, Inamul Hasan; Asangani, Amjad Hussain; Ssadh, Hussain Al; Tayubi, Iftikhar Aslam\n\n2017-01-01\n\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is endocrine system disease which affect women ages 18 to 44 where the women's hormones are imbalance. Recently it has been reported to occur in early age. Alteration of normal gene expression in PCOS has shown negative effects on long-term health issues. PCOS has been the responsible factor for the infertility in women of reproductive age group. Early diagnosis and treatment can improve the women's health suffering from PCOS. Earlier Studies shows correlation of PCOS upon insulin resistance with significant outcome, Current study shows the linkage between PCOS with obesity and non-obese patients. Gene expression datasets has been downloaded from GEO (control and PCOS affected patients). Normalization of the datasets were performed using R based on RMA and differentially expressed gene (DEG) were selected on the basis of p-value 0.05 followed by functional annotation of selected gene using Enrich R and DAVID. The DEGs were significantly related to PCOS with obesity and other risk factors involved in disease. The Gene Enrichment Analysis suggests alteration of genes and associated pathway in case of obesity. Current study provides a productive groundwork for specific biomarkers identification for the accurate diagnosis and efficient target for the treatment of PCOS.\n\nObesity and PCOS: Implications for Diagnosis and Treatment\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLegro, Richard S.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThere appears to be an epidemic of both obesity and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in the world today. However, obesity per se is not a part of the phenotype in many parts of the world. Obesity is likely not a cause of PCOS, as the high prevalence of PCOS among relatively thin populations demonstrates. However, obesity does exacerbate many aspects of the phenotype, especially cardiovascular risk factors such as glucose intolerance and dyslipidemia. It is also associated with a poor response to infertility treatment and likely an increased risk for pregnancy complications in those women who do conceive. Although most treatments of obesity, with the exception of bariatric surgery, achieve modest reductions in weight and improvements in the PCOS phenotype, encouraging weight loss in the obese patient remains one of the front-line therapies. However, further studies are needed to identify the best treatments, and the role of lifestyle therapies in women of normal weight with PCOS is uncertain.

Fifteen anatomically well-defined body sites from neck to calf describe a SAT topography (SAT-Top) like an individual \"fingerprint\" of a subject. This SAT-Top was examined in 16 women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and compared to the body fat distribution of 87 age-matched healthy controls and 20 type-2 diabetic women. SAT-Top differences of these three groups were described and, to render the possibility of visual comparison, the 15-dimensional body fat information was condensed to a two-dimensional factor plot by factor analysis. All PCOS patients had an android body fat distribution with significantly thinner SAT layers on the legs as compared to healthy controls. Moreover, a hierarchical cluster analysis resulted in two distinctly different groups of PCOS women, a lean (PCOSL) and an obese (PCOSO) cluster: compared to healthy women, lean PCOS patients had significantly lower total SAT development, even though height, weight, and body mass index did not deviate significantly. Especially on the legs, their SAT layers were significantly lowered, indicating a more \"apple-like\" fat distribution type. Obese PCOS women showed a SAT-Top pattern very similar to that of women with type-2 diabetes, although the mean age difference between these groups was more than 30 years. Compared to healthy controls, the SAT-Top of these obese PCOS patients was strongly shifted into the android direction, appearing as \"super-apples\" with a significantly increased upper trunk obesity to 237.8% and a significantly decreased leg SAT development to 79.8%.

We conducted the present profiling study to characterize the expression of circulating miRNAs in lean and obese patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the most common endocrine and metabolic disorder in premenopausal women. We selected 11 control women, 12 patients with PCOS and 12 men so that they were similar in terms of body mass index. Five control women, 6 men and 6 patients with PCOS had normal weight whereas 6 subjects per group were obese. We used miRCURY LNAâ¢ Universal RT microRNA PCR for miRNA profiling. The expression of 38 miRNAs and was different between subjects with PCOS and male and female controls. The differences in 15 miRNAs followed a pattern suggestive of androgenization characterized by expression levels that were similar in patients with PCOS and men but were different compared with those of control women. The expression of 13 miRNAs in women with PCOS was similar to that of control women and different compared with the expression observed in men, suggesting sexual dimorphism and, lastly, we observed 5 miRNAs that were expressed differently in women with PCOS compared with both men and control women, suggesting a specific abnormality in expression associated with the syndrome. Obesity interacted with the differences in several of these miRNAs, and the expression levels of many of them correlated with the hirsutism score, sex hormones and/or indexes of obesity, adiposity and metabolic dysfunction. The present results suggest that several serum miRNAs are influenced by PCOS, sex hormones and obesity. Our findings may guide the targeted search of miRNAs as clinically relevant markers for PCOS and its association with obesity and metabolic dysfunction in future studies. Copyright Â© 2018.

Obesity and insulin resistance are thought to potentiate disruptions in antral follicle development that result in chronic anovulation, and as such, have become important therapeutic targets of dietary interventions aimed at weight loss. Caloric restriction has been shown to promote sporadic ovulation in obese women with PCOS, but improvements have occurred across a wide range of patients and little has been garnered about the factors that distinguish responders from non-responders. Further, few studies have evaluated the likelihood for modest weight loss to restore normal ovulatory cyclicity in PCOS. Consensus regarding the impact of dietary intervention on ovulation has been limited by variability in the measures used to characterize and report ovulatory status across studies. In response, this review provides an assessment of the evidence surrounding the effectiveness of hypocaloric dietary intervention to normalize ovulatory function in PCOS. The impact of physiological versus methodological factors on the evaluation of ovulatory status is discussed and recommendations to strengthen future studies in this area are provided. Ultimately, further research is needed to understand the optimal dietary or lifestyle approaches that promote ovulation and sustained improvements in reproductive function in PCOS.\n\nImpact of hypocaloric dietary intervention on ovulation in obese women with PCOS\n\nPubMed Central\n\nJarrett, Brittany Y.; Lujan, Marla E.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common cause of ovulatory dysfunction impacting women of reproductive age.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine and metabolic disorder among women of the reproductive age with long term sequelae which include IR and metabolic syndrome. The aim of this study is to evaluate the circulating plasma betatrophin levels in overweight/obese or lean women with or without PCOS and also to elucidate possible correlations with anthropometric and metabolic parameters. Thirty-two patients with PCOS as well as fifty-three control subjects were enrolled after obtaining informed written consent. Clinical and biochemical parameters of all subjects were determined. Plasma adiponectin, GLP-1 and betatrophin levels were measured by ELISA. Plasma betatrophin levels were significantly increased in lean patients with PCOS compared with lean and obese controls. Moreover, in PCOS group, betatrophin levels were significantly negatively correlated with waist hip ratio (WHR), fasting insulin level (FINS) and HOMA-IR, whereas, significantly positively correlated with adiponectin level. Multiple regression analysis showed that HOMA-IR was an independent factor influencing serum betatrophin levels. Further follow-up studies are needed to highlight whether and how increased betatrophin secretion play an important role in IR and carbohydrates metabolism in patients with PCOS.\n\nInsulin resistance and endocrine-metabolic abnormalities in polycystic ovarian syndrome: Comparison between obese and non-obese PCOS patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nLayegh, Parvin; Mousavi, Zohreh; Farrokh Tehrani, Donya; Parizadeh, Seyed Mohammad Reza; Khajedaluee, Mohammad\n\n2016-04-01\n\nInsulin resistance has an important role in pathophysiology of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Yet there are certain controversies regarding the presence of insulin resistance in non-obese patients. The aim was to compare the insulin resistance and various endocrine and metabolic abnormalities in obese and non-obese PCOS women. In this cross-sectional study which was performed from 2007-2010, 115 PCOS patients, aged 16-45 years were enrolled. Seventy patients were obese (BMI â¥25) and 45 patients were non-obese (BMI <25). Presence of insulin resistance and endocrine-metabolic abnormalities were compared between two groups. Collected data were analyzed with SPSS version 16.0 and p<0.05 was considered as statistically significant. There was no significant difference in presence of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR >2.3) between two groups (p=0.357). Waist circumference (p<0.001), waist/hip ratio (p<0.001), systolic (p<0.001) and diastolic (p<0.001) blood pressures, fasting blood sugar (p=0.003) and insulin (p=0.011), HOMA-IR (p=0.004), total cholesterol (p=0.001) and triglyceride (p<0.001) were all significantly higher in obese PCOS patients. There was no significant difference in total testosterone (p=0.634) and androstenedione (p=0.736) between groups whereas Dehydroepiandrotendione sulfate (DHEAS) was significantly higher in non-obese PCOS women (p=0.018). There was no case of fatty liver and metabolic syndrome in non-obese patients, whereas they were seen in 31.3% and 39.4% of obese PCOS women, respectively. Our study showed that metabolic abnormalities are more prevalent in obese PCOS women, but adrenal axis activity that is reflected in higher levels of DHEAS was more commonly pronounced in our non-obese PCOS patients.\n\nThe Effect of Exercise in PCOS Women Who Exercise Regularly.\n\nPubMed\n\nKhademi, Afsaneh; Alleyassin, Ashraf; Aghahosseini, Marzieh; Tabatabaeefar, Leila; Amini, Mehrnoosh\n\n2010-03-01\n\nTo determine the prevalence of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in women who exercise regularly. All women under age 45 from an industrial company who had past history of exercising more than 6 months enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Prevalence of PCOS and comparison of BMI between PCOS and non-PCOS subgroups was done. The diagnosis of PCOS was based on the revised 2003 Rotterdam ESHRE/ASRM consensus criteria and exclusion of related disorders. The prevalence of PCOS in was 8.8%; 95% CI: 8.5%-9.1%. In obese subjects, mean BMI differed significantly between PCOS and non-PCOS women (29.3 Â±3.3 kg/m(2) vs. 27.8 Â± 2 kg/m(2), P=0.03). In lean subjects, there was no statistically significant difference in terms of BMI between PCOS and non-PCOS women (21.4 Â± 1.9 kg/m(2) vs. 21.2 Â± 2 kg/m(2), P>0.05). Obese PCOS patients show more difficulty in losing weight by exercise than lean PCOS patients. The role of hormonal alterations and PCOS per se in the responsiveness of weight loss to exercise remains to be determined.\n\nEndometria from Obese PCOS Women with Hyperinsulinemia Exhibit Altered Adiponectin Signaling.\n\nPubMed\n\nGarcÃ­a, V; OrÃ³stica, L; Poblete, C; Rosas, C; Astorga, I; Romero, C; Vega, M\n\n2015-11-01\n\nHyperandrogenemia, hyperinsulinemia, and obesity affect 60-70% of patients with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS), who exhibit an altered endometrial insulin signaling. The aim of the study was to evaluate whether hyperandrogenism, hyperinsulinism, and obesity present in PCOS patients impair the endometrial adiponectin signaling pathway. The ex vivo study was conducted on 27 samples from lean (n=9), obese (n=9), and obese-PCOS (n=9) patients. The in vitro assays were performed in immortalized human endometrial stromal cells stimulated with testosterone, insulin, or testosterone plus insulin. Serum steroid-hormones, adiponectin, glucose, and insulin; body mass index, free androgen index, ISI-Composite, and HOMA were evaluated in the 3 groups. Ex vivo and in vitro gene expression and protein content of adiponectin, AdipoR1, AdipoR2, and APPL1 were determined. Adiponectin serum levels were decreased in obese-PCOS patients compared to lean (78%) and obese (54%) controls (p<0.05). AdipoR1 protein and gene expression were increased in obese group vs. obese-PCOS and lean groups (2-fold, p<0.05). In turn, AdipoR2 protein and mRNA content was similar between the 3 groups. APPL1 protein levels were reduced in endometria from both obese groups, compared to lean group (6-fold, p<0.05). Testosterone plus insulin stimulation of T-HESC and St-T1b leads to a reduction of adiponectin, AdipoR1, AdipoR2, and APPL1 protein content in both endometrial cell lines (p<0.05), whereas, in the presence of testosterone or insulin alone, protein levels were similar to basal. Therefore, endometrial adiponectin-signaling pathway is impaired in hyperandrogenemic and hyperinsulinemic obese-PCOS patients, corroborated in the in vitro model, which could affect endometrial function and potentially the implantation process.

Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are at high risk for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Whether this risk is independent of obesity is not clear. Design/Patients/Interventions/Main Outcome Measures In a prospective study, 44 women with PCOS and 34 control women completed the Berlin questionnaire for assessment of OSA risk. All women underwent fasting determination of androgens, glucose and insulin. Results Women with PCOS were more obese compared to control women (p=0.02). However, there were no differences in BMI once subjects were divided into non-obese (PCOS n=17 and control n=26) and obese (PCOS n=26 and control n=8) groups. Women with PCOS had higher prevalence of high risk OSA compared to control women on the Berlin questionnaire (47% vs. 15%, P<0.01). However, none of the non-obese PCOS and control women screened positive for high risk OSA. Among the obese group, the risk did not differ between groups (77% vs. 63%, P= 0.65). Conclusions Our findings indicate that even though the risk for OSA in PCOS is high, it is related to the high prevalence of severe obesity. The risk for OSA among non-obese women with PCOS is very low. However, our findings are limited by lack of polysomnographic confirmation of OSA.

Women diagnosed with PCOS and age-matched healthy controls with regular menses and normal ovaries on ultrasound examination were selected and divided into 4 groups (group A, PCOS and obese; group B, PCOS and non-obese; group C, obese controls; and group D, non-obese controls) based on body mass index (obese >30 kg/m2 and non-obese <25 kg/m2). Luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, androstenedione, testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin, serum glucose, insulin and MIF levels were measured. Obese and non-obese women with PCOS had higher luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, androstenedione, testosterone, and insulin levels as compared to the obese and non-obese control groups, respectively (P < .0001). Women with PCOS had significantly higher MIF levels (group A, 48.6 Â± 9.9 mg/ml; group B, 35.2 Â± 6.0 ng/ml) as compared to controls (group C, 13.5 Â± 6.0 ng/ml; group D, 12.0 Â± 4.3 ng/dl; P < .0001). A weak, positive and significant correlation was seen between fasting blood glucose and insulin levels in women with PCOS (P < .05). Significant differences exist in plasma MIF levels between obese and non-obese women with and without PCOS. Copyright Â© 2014 SEEN. Published by Elsevier Espana.

The role of proinsulin, which is known to be an indicator of fertility outcomes in PCOS women, and that of adiponectin, in the pathogenesis of PCOS is not well elucidated. Our objective was to determine proinsulin, adiponectin, hsCRP and other hormonal and metabolic parameters in PCOS women before and after metformin treatment. Two PCOS groups of patients of reproductive age (90 lean and 88 obese or overweight) with two control groups, adjusted for body mass index (BMI), were compared at baseline. 32 PCOS women were studied at baseline, after three and six months of metformin (1,000 mg/day) treatment. Clinical, anthropometric, biochemical and hormonal parameters were assessed. Proinsulin and hsCRP levels were the highest in obese PCOS women and were statistically different than in lean PCOS women (proinsulin: 11.4 v. 6.9 pmol/L; hsCRP 2.46 v. 0.47 mg/L, p < 0.01) and than in obese controls. Levels of adiponectin were dependant on BMI. Plasma proinsulin and androstenedione levels decreased after metformin treatment only in obese PCOS women. PCOS, when accompanied by obesity, is associated with elevated proinsulin concentrations, which correlates with higher hsCRP and increased FAI. Proinsulin level decreases due to metformin treatment. Our results suggest that obese or overweight PCOS and lean PCOS are characterised by different hormonal and metabolic parameters and have a different response to metformin treatment.\n\nBasal metabolic rate in women with PCOS compared to eumenorrheic controls.\n\nPubMed\n\nChurchill, Sara J; Wang, Erica T; Bhasin, Gaisu; Alexander, Carolyn; Bresee, Catherine; Pall, Marita; Azziz, Ricardo; Mathur, Ruchi; Pisarska, Margareta D\n\n2015-09-01\n\nPCOS is associated with obesity and insulin resistance. Efforts have focused on whether an abnormal energy homeostasis contributes to the development of obesity in these patients. There are conflicting results in the literature regarding whether women with PCOS have an altered basal metabolic rate (BMR), thereby leading to difficulties in weight loss. The objective of this study is to compare basal metabolic rate (BMR) in women with PCOS and controls. Cross-sectional study. One hundred and twenty-eight PCOS patients diagnosed by original NIH consensus criteria and 72 eumenorrheic, non-hirsute controls were recruited from an academic medical centre. Assessment of BMR using the InBody portable bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) device and insulin resistance by HOMA-IR indices. PCOS women were younger than controls. As expected, PCOS subjects had higher body mass index (BMI), serum androgens and estimated insulin resistance. After adjusting for age and BMI, there was no significant difference in BMR between PCOS subjects (adjusted mean 5807 kJ/day, 95% CI 5715-5899) and controls (adjusted mean 5916 kJ/day, 95% CI 5786-6046) (P = 0Â·193). BMR was also comparable in a secondary analysis comparing PCOS women with and without insulin resistance. After adjusting for age and BMI, there was no difference in BMR between PCOS women and controls.

We investigate the influence of polymorphisms in the genes encoding toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and 4 (TLR4) and endothelial adhesion molecules on polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and its interaction with obesity. Ten single nucleotide polymorphisms were genotyped in 305 women with PCOS and 166 non-hyperandrogenic control women. In obese women, TLR2 S450S and ICAM1 K469E polymorphisms differently influenced metabolic variables and PCOS, respectively. Irrespective of PCOS, variant alleles of TLR2 S450S increased triglycerides, fasting insulin levels, and insulin resistance in obese women. TLR2 S450S interacted with obesity and PCOS on androstenedione levels, mutant alleles were associated with increased androstenedione concentrations in all women, with the exception of obese patients with PCOS (P=0.034). Regarding ICAM1 K469E, homozygosis for K469 alleles was more frequent in PCOS, but only in obese women (P=0.014). K469 alleles were also related to increased body mass index (P=0.017) and diastolic blood pressure (P=0.034). Moreover, ICAM1 K469E interacted with obesity and PCOS on serum triglyceride levels (P=0.019) and with PCOS on serum sex hormone-binding globulin concentrations (P=0.006). In conclusion, TLR2 S450S and ICAM1 K469E polymorphisms may be associated with PCOS and metabolic comorbidities in obese women. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Clinical symptoms associated with PCOS, such as hirsutism, acne, alopecia, obesity, and infertility, may lead to emotional morbidity and then impaired sexual function in those affected. During intrauterine development, the fetus may program the development of diseases during adulthood. In this study, we aimed to examine sexual function in women with PCOS, exposed to maternal androgen excess during their prenatal life compared to non-exposed PCOS patients. In this cross-sectional study, 768 married women with PCOS, aged 18-49Â years, were subdivided into two groups, based on their mothers' PCOS status: women whose mothers had PCOS (NÂ =Â 94) and women whose mothers did not have PCOS (NÂ =Â 674). Data were collected using a questionnaire including information on demographics, anthropometric and reproductive characteristics, and the Female Sexual Function Index. Blood serum samples were collected from patients for assessment of total testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin levels. Results revealed that sexual dysfunction was significantly higher in PCOS women whose mothers also had PCOS, compared to those whose mothers did not (38.6 vs. 25.3%, pÂ =Â .01). After adjusting for confounding variables, logistic regression analysis showed that odds ratios for sexual dysfunction (total) and sexual dysfunction in the pain domain were significantly higher in the exposed PCOS women versus the non-exposed women (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.06-3.07, pÂ =Â .02 and 1.68, 95% CI 1.01-2.77, pÂ =Â .04, respectively). Our study demonstrates increased sexual dysfunction in PCOS women whose mothers also had PCOS.\n\nFamily background of Diabetes Mellitus, obesity and hypertension affects the phenotype and first symptom of patients with PCOS.\n\nPubMed\n\nKulshreshtha, Bindu; Singh, Seerat; Arora, Arpita\n\n2013-12-01\n\nThe phenotypic variability among PCOS could be due to differences in insulin patterns. Hyperinsulinemia commonly accompanies Diabetes Mellitus (DM), obesity, hypertension and CAD, though, to a variable degree. We speculate that a family history of these diseases could differentially affect the phenotype of PCOS. To study the effect of DM/CAD/HT and obesity on the phenotype of PCOS. PCOS patients and age matched controls were enquired for a family background of DM, hypertension, CAD and obesity among parents and grandparents. Regression modelling was employed to examine predictors of obesity and first symptom in PCOS patients. There were 88 PCOS women and 77 age-matched controls (46 lean, 31 obese). A high prevalence of DM, CAD, obesity and hypertension was observed among parents and grandparents of women with PCOS compared to controls. Hypertension and CAD manifested more in father's side of family. BMI of PCOS subjects was significantly related to parental DM and obesity after correcting for age. First symptom of weight gain was significantly associated with number of parents with DM (pâ=â0.02) and first symptom of irregular periods was associated with number of parents with hypertension (pâ=â0.06). A family background of DM/HT and obesity diseases affects the phenotype of PCOS.\n\nPrevention of diabetes and cardiovascular disease in women with PCOS: treatment with insulin sensitizers.\n\nPubMed\n\nSharma, Susmeeta T; Nestler, John E\n\n2006-06-01\n\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common cause of anovulatory infertility in United States, affecting 6-10% of females in the reproductive age group. Recent studies have shown that insulin resistance plays an important role in the pathogenesis of PCOS. Traditionally, management of PCOS consisted mainly of ovulation induction, treatment of acne and hirsutism, and prevention of endometrial cancer. However, with mounting evidence showing that PCOS is associated with dysmetabolic syndrome and an increased risk for developing diabetes and heart disease, this can no longer be our sole focus. Current data support a strong recommendation that women with PCOS should undergo comprehensive evaluation for diabetes and recognized cardiovascular risk factors and receive appropriate treatment as needed. Lifestyle modifications remain the first-line therapy for all obese women with PCOS. However, many obese women with PCOS find weight loss difficult to achieve and maintain, and this is not an option for lean women with PCOS. For these reasons, insulin-sensitizing drugs are proving to be a promising and unique therapeutic option for chronic treatment of PCOS.\n\nAdiponectin and leptin in overweight/obese and lean women with polycystic ovary syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nChen, Chin-I; Hsu, Ming-I; Lin, Shyh-Hsiang; Chang, Yuan-Chin I; Hsu, Chun-Sen; Tzeng, Chii-Ruey\n\n2015-04-01\n\nThe objective of this study was to evaluate the adiponectin and leptin levels in overweight/obese and lean women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). This was a retrospective study. Of the 422 studied patients, 224 women with PCOS and 198 women without PCOS were evaluated. Insulin resistance and the metabolic components were assessed. The adiponectin and leptin levels were also evaluated. Adiponectin was negatively correlated with insulin resistance, body mass index (BMI), and total testosterone, triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels; conversely, leptin reversed the aforementioned reaction and was negatively correlated with adiponectin levels. The adiponectin to leptin ratios were significantly lower in PCOS women than in those without PCOS. Compared to women with non-PCOS, overweight/obese women with PCOS had lower serum adiponectin levels than women without PCOS, which was not the case for lean women. Conversely, lean women with PCOS had higher serum leptin levels than those without PCOS, which was not the case for overweight/obese women. Adipose tissue might play an important role in the metabolic complications in women with PCOS. To study the impact of obesity biomarkers in women with PCOS, overweight/obese and lean women should be considered separately.\n\nEndothelial function in young women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): Implications of body mass index (BMI) and insulin resistance.\n\nPubMed\n\nEl-Kannishy, Ghada; Kamal, Shaheer; Mousa, Amany; Saleh, Omayma; Badrawy, Adel El; Farahaty, Reham El; Shokeir, Tarek\n\n2010-01-01\n\nEvidence regarding endothelial function in both obese and nonobese women with PCOS is contradictory. It is unknown whether obese women with PCOS carry an increased risk related to body mass index (BMI). To identify endothelial function and investigate its relationship to body mass index and insulin resistance in young women with PCOS. Twenty-two obese women with PCOS (BMI 35.2 Â± 3.2) as well as fourteen lean women (BMI 22.8 Â± 2.1)with PCOS were included in the study. Fasting serum insulin, blood glucose were estimated and HOMA and Quicki index were calculated. All patients were subjected to ultrasound recording of brachial artery diameter at rest and after reactive hyperemia (FMD) for assessment of endothelial function. Ten age matched healthy females with normal BMI were chosen as a control group. There were higher basal insulin levels with lower Quicki index and higher HOMA index in women with PCOS than normal group, but the differences were significant only between obese PCOS subgroup and control. On the other hand, FMD was significantly and equally decreased in both groups of women with PCOS, compared with control subjects (3.7 Â± 3.2% in the nonobese subgroup and 3.5 Â± 2.8% in the obese one vs. 10.6 Â± 4.1% in control subjects, P, 0.001). FMD was not correlated with BMI nor insulin resistance indices. Endothelial dysfunction is already present in young women with PCOS. In this patient group, it cannot be attributed to insulin resistance or obesity. ÃÂ© 2010 Asian Oceanian Association for the Study of Obesity . Published by Elsevier Ltd.

WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY PCOS is associated with an increased risk of prediabetes and T2DM. However, the respective roles of PCOS per se and BMI for the development of T2DM have remained unclear. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION In a prospective, general population-based follow-up birth cohort 1966 (n = 5889), postal questionnaires were sent at ages 14 (95% answered), 31 (80% answered) and 46 years (72% answered). Questions about oligoamenorrhoea and hirsutism were asked at age 31 years, and a question about PCOS diagnosis at 46 years. Clinical examination and blood sampling were performed at 31 years in 3127 women, and at 46 years in 3280 women. A 2-h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed at 46 years of age in 2780 women. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS Women reporting both oligoamenorrhoea and hirsutism at age 31 years and/or diagnosis of PCOS by 46 years were considered as women with PCOS (n = 279). Women without any symptoms at 31 years and without PCOS diagnosis by 46 years were considered as controls (n = 1577). The level of glucose metabolism was classified according to the results of the OGTT and previous information of glucose metabolism status from the national drug and hospital discharge registers. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE PCOS per se significantly increased the risk of T2DM in overweight/obese (BMI â¥ 25.0 kg/m2) women with PCOS when compared to overweight/obese controls (odds ratio: 2.45, 95% CI: 1.28â4.67).

These individuals are at increased risks of metabolic syndrome that includes insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), dyslipidemia and hypertension. PCOS has been known to be associated with insulin resistance. To compare the insulin sensitivity between obese adolescent girls with PCOS and those without PCOS. We reviewed demographic and hormonal data of 6 obese adolescent girls with PCOS and compared with 6 age, weight and BMI-matched non-PCOS controls. Each subject underwent an oral glucose tolerance test. Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance score (HOMA-IR score) in obese adolescent girls with PCOS was significantly higher than in girls without PCOS with median and range as follows (16.5 [3.8, 21.8] vs. 4.1 [3.3, 6.9], p = 0.04). Our study demonstrates that obese adolescent girls with PCOS have more severe insulin resistance measured by HOMA-IR score than girls without PCOS independent of the degree of obesity. Since insulin resistance is a metabolic precursor of future cardiovascular diseases, obese adolescent girls with PCOS might be at greater risk of developing cardiovascular disease in later adulthood than their non-PCOS counterparts.\n\nMetabolic Concomitants of Obese and Nonobese Women With Features of Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBoumosleh, Jocelyne Matar; Grundy, Scott M.; Phan, Jennifer; Neeland, Ian J.; Chang, Alice\n\n2017-01-01\n\nContext: Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is often associated with obesity and diabetes. Objective: The present study measured body fat distribution and metabolic risk factors in women with features of PCOS. Design: Cross-sectional, multiethnic study of cardiovascular risks. Setting: General community. Study Participants: 145 PCOS and 344 non-PCOS women. Exposure Measures: Body composition by dual x-ray absorptiometry; abdominal fat masses measured by magnetic resonance imaging and hepatic triglyceride by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Outcomes Measures: Body composition, liver fat content, homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), revised, and metabolic syndrome components. Results: PCOS women had a higher free androgen index compared with the non-PCOS women. Nonobese PCOS and non-PCOS women had a similar body fat content and distribution, HOMA-IR, and hepatic triglyceride content. Obese PCOS women had a similar total body fat percentage compared with their non-PCOS counterparts (41.4% and 41.4% respectively). Both obese groups had similar intraperitoneal fat (1.4% of total body mass in PCOS vs 1.4% in non-PCOS). However, obese PCOS women had a greater ratio of truncal/lower body fat (1.42 vs 1.27; P < 0.016). They also had greater insulin resistance (HOMA-IR: PCOS, 2.24% vs non-PCOS, 1.91%; P < 0.016), higher liver triglyceride content (6.96% in PCOS vs 4.44% in non-PCOS; P < 0.016), and a greater incidence of hypertension (33% vs 24%; P < 0.05). No differences were observed in other metabolic risk factors. Conclusions: Both obese and nonobese women with PCOS features had a greater free androgen index compared with non-PCOS women, but neither had greater intraperitoneal fat or abnormal lipid levels. Obese, but not nonobese, women with PCOS had a greater truncal/lower extremity fat ratio, HOMA-IR, and liver triglyceride content.

A review of the literature.\n\nPubMed\n\nDonÃ , S; Bacchi, E; Moghetti, P\n\n2017-05-01\n\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common and heterogeneous endocrine disorder, affecting 8-12% of reproductive-aged women. Insulin resistance and body fat excess are common features in these subjects. Increased physical activity and diet modifications are the first recommended approach in the management of these women, at least in overweight/obese subjects. Evaluation of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is important in assessing exercise performance and in monitoring the effects of physical exercise interventions. Several studies have shown that CRF may be impaired in metabolic and endocrine disorders. However, there are little data on this issue in PCOS women. The aim of this narrative review is to critically evaluate whether aerobic capacity is altered in PCOS women, focusing on maximal oxygen uptake. An updated search of the literature was performed, identifying papers with maximal oxygen consumption measurements in women with PCOS compared to healthy controls. We have identified six studies on this specific topic: four of them showed an alteration of maximal oxygen consumption in PCOS women, whereas two did not. However, taken together these studies suggest that CRF may be strikingly impaired in both normal-weight and overweight/obese subjects with this condition. Women with PCOS appear to be characterized by a reduced cardiopulmonary fitness. However, further research on this topic is needed. This information may hopefully help clinicians and exercise specialist in planning individualized exercise programs aimed at improving the metabolic and endocrine outcomes in these women.\n\nPrevalence and predictors of metabolic abnormalities in Chinese women with PCOS: a cross- sectional study\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2014-01-01\n\nBackground Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common condition estimated to affect 5.61% of Chinese women of reproductive age, but little is known about the prevalence and predictors in Chinese PCOS patients. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and predictors of the metabolic abnormalities in Chinese women with and without PCOS. Methods A large-scale national epidemiological investigation was conducted in reproductive age women (19 to 45Â years) across China. 833 reproductive aged PCOS women, who participated in the healthcare screening, were recruited from ten provinces in China. Clinical history, ultrasonographic exam (ovarian follicle), hormonal and metabolic parameters were the main outcome measures. Results The prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) as compared in PCOS and non-PCOS women from community were 18.2% vs 14.7%, and IR (insulin resistance) were 14.2% vs 9.3% (pâ<â0.001) respectively. After adjusting for age, the indicators (central obesity, hypertension, fasting insulin, SHBG, dyslipinaemia) for metabolic disturbances were significantly higher in PCOS than in non-PCOS groups. Using multivariate logistic regression, central obesity and FAI were risk factors, while SHBG was a protective factor on the occurrence of Mets and IR in PCOS women (OR: 1.132, 1.105 and 0.995). Conclusions The risk factors of the metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance were BMI and FAI for PCOS women, respectively. The decrease of SHBG level was also a risk factor for insulin resistance in both PCOS and metabolic disturbance.

The specific aim of this study was to assess the possible correlations of WBC with the major components of PCOS, obesity, insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism. Anthropometrical, metabolic and hormonal data were analyzed from 203 women with PCOS (NIH criteria) and 76 age-matched controls. In the total population studied (N=279), WBC was significantly higher (P=0.003) in the PCOS group compared with age-matched healthy women and was positively correlated with BMI (r=0.461, p<0.001), total testosterone (r= 0.210, p<0.001), insulin (r=0.271, p<0.001), triglycerides (r=0.285, p<0.001), HOMA score (r=0.206, p=0.001), FAI (r=0.329, p<0.001) and negatively correlated with SHBG (r=-0.300, p<0.001) and HDL (r=-0.222, p<0.001). Due to the fact that WHR was only available in the group of PCOS women, the role of central adiposity is assessed only in this group. Multiple regression analysis in the PCOS group, including WHR, revealed BMI, SHBG and TGL as the main predicting factors of WBC. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was also conducted and overweight/obesity was the sole independent risk factor for elevated WBC (higher tertile) (OR:0.907 CI:0.85-0.96, p=0.002). After dividing the sample based on BMI in the lean subgroups, WBC did not differ significantly between PCOS and controls, while multiple regression analysis indicated SHBG as the main predicting factor of WBC. Finally, we picked out the group of overweight/obese (BMI â¥25 kg/m2) women with PCOS and conducted another classification based on HOMA score (HOMA-IRâ¤2: insulin-sensitive women, HOMA-IR>2: insulin-resistant women) in the group of overweight and obese women with PCOS separately. In overweight women with PCOS, WBC, although higher in the group of insulin-resistant, did not differ significantly between the two groups, while in the subcategory of overweight women WBC\n\nBenefit of Delayed Fertility Therapy With Preconception Weight Loss Over Immediate Therapy in Obese Women With PCOS.\n\nPubMed\n\nLegro, Richard S; Dodson, William C; Kunselman, Allen R; Stetter, Christy M; Kris-Etherton, Penny M; Williams, Nancy I; Gnatuk, Carol L; Estes, Stephanie J; Allison, Kelly C; Sarwer, David B; Diamond, Michael P; Schlaff, William D; Casson, Peter R; Christman, Gregory M; Barnhart, Kurt T; Bates, G Wright; Usadi, Rebecca; Lucidi, Scott; Baker, Valerie; Zhang, Heping; Eisenberg, Esther; Coutifaris, Christos; Dokras, Anuja\n\n2016-07-01\n\nIn overweight/obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the relative benefit of delaying infertility treatment to lose weight vs seeking immediate treatment is unknown.

The objective of the study was to investigate whether insulin sensitivity and insulin's effects on the microcirculation are impaired in normal-weight and obese women with PCOS. Thirty-five women with PCOS (19 normal weight and 16 obese) and 27 age- and body mass index-matched controls (14 normal weight and 13 obese) were included. Metabolic Insulin sensitivity (isoglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp) and microvascular insulin sensitivity [endothelium dependent (acetylcholine [ACh])] and endothelium-independent [sodium nitroprusside (SNP)] vasodilation with laser Doppler flowmetry was assessed at baseline and during hyperinsulinemia. Metabolic insulin sensitivity (M/I value) and the area under the response curves to ACh and SNP curves were measured to assess microcirculatory function at baseline and during insulin infusion (microvascular insulin sensitivity). Obese women were more insulin resistant than normal-weight women (P < 0.001), and obese PCOS women were more resistant than obese controls (P = 0.02). In contrast, normal-weight women with PCOS had similar insulin sensitivity, compared with normal-weight women without PCOS. Baseline responses to ACh showed no difference in the four groups. ACh responses during insulin infusion were significantly greater in normal-weight PCOS and controls than in obese PCOS and controls. PCOS per se had no significant influence on ACh responses during insulin infusion. During hyperinsulinemia, SNP-dependent vasodilatation did not significantly increase, compared with baseline in the four groups. PCOS per se was not associated with impaired metabolic insulin sensitivity in normal-weight women but aggravates impairment of metabolic insulin sensitivity in obese women.

The overweight-obese PCOS phenotype appears to have exacerbated reproductive dysfunction and cardiometabolic risk. In overweight-obese adult women with PCOS, exercise and energy restricted diets have shown limited and inconsistent effects on both cardiometabolic indices and reproductive outcomes. We hypothesized that an early lifestyle intervention involving exercise and dietary energy restriction to prevent or reduce the propensity for adiposity would modulate reproductive indices and cardiometabolic risk in an obese PCOS-prone rodent model. Weanling obese PCOS-prone and Lean-Control JCR:LA-cp rodents were given a chow diet ad libitum or an energy-restricted diet combined with or without voluntary exercise (4â h/day) for 8 weeks. Dietary energy restriction and exercise lowered total body weight gain and body fat mass by 30% compared to free-fed sedentary or exercising obese PCOS-prone animals (P<0.01). Energy restriction induced an increase in exercise intensity compared to free-feeding plus exercise conditions. Energy restriction and exercise decreased fasting plasma triglycerides and apoB48 concentrations in obese PCOS-prone animals compared to free-fed and exercise or sedentary groups. The energy restriction and exercise combination in obese PCOS-prone animals significantly increased plasma sex-hormone binding globulin, hypothalamic cocaine-and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) and Kisspeptin mRNA expression to levels of the Lean-Control group, and this was further associated with improvements in estrous cyclicity. The combination of exercise and dietary energy restriction when initiated in early life exerts beneficial effects on cardiometabolic and reproductive indices in an obese PCOS-prone rodent model, and this may be associated with normalization of\n\nChildhood Obesity and Its Impact on the Development of Adolescent PCOS\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAnderson, Amy D.; Solorzano, Christine M. Burt; McCartney, Christopher R.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nObesity exacerbates the reproductive and metabolic manifestations of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The symptoms of PCOS often begin in adolescence, and the rising prevalence of peripubertal obesity has prompted concern that the prevalence and severity of adolescent PCOS is increasing in parallel. Recent data have disclosed a high prevalence of hyperandrogenemia among peripubertal adolescents with obesity, suggesting that such girls are indeed at risk for developing PCOS. Obesity may impact the risk of PCOS via insulin resistance and compensatory hyperinsulinemia, which augments ovarian/adrenal androgen production and suppresses sex hormoneâbinding globulin (SHBG), thereby increasing androgen bioavailability. Altered luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion plays an important role in the pathophysiology of PCOS, and although obesity is generally associated with relative reductions of LH, higher LH appears to be the best predictor of increased free testosterone among peripubertal girls with obesity. Other potential mechanisms of obesity-associated hyperandrogenemia include enhanced androgen production in an expanded fat mass and potential effects of abnormal adipokine/cytokine levels. Adolescents with PCOS are at risk for comorbidities such as metabolic syndrome and impaired glucose tolerance, and concomitant obesity compounds these risks. For all of these reasons, weight loss represents an important therapeutic target in obese adolescents with PCOS.

We examined the risk of (non)fatal coronary heart disease (CHD) or stroke in patients with PCOS and ovulatory women without PCOS, and assessed whether obesity might explain a higher risk of CHD or stroke. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled observational studies. Four definitions of PCOS were considered: World Health Organization type II anovulation, National Institutes of Health criteria, Rotterdam consensus and Androgen-excess criteria. Obesity was defined as BMI > 30 kg/m(2) and/or waist circumference >88 cm. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Primary outcome was fatal/non-fatal CHD or stroke. Definitions of CHD and stroke were based on criteria used by the various authors. The effect measure was the pooled relative risk in a random effects model. Risk ratios and rate ratios were combined here. After identifying 1340 articles, 5 follow-up studies published between 2000 and 2008 were included. The studies showed heterogeneity in design, definitions and quality. In a random effects model the relative risk for CHD or stroke were 2.02 comparing women with PCOS to women without PCOS (95% confidence interval 1.47, 2.76). Pooling the two studies with risk estimates adjusted for BMI showed a relative risk of 1.55 (1.27, 1.89). This meta-analysis showed a 2-fold risk of arterial disease for patients with PCOS relative to women without PCOS. BMI adjustment did not affect this finding, suggesting the increased risk for cardiovascular events in PCOS is not completely related to a higher BMI in patients with PCOS.\n\nHigher Circulating Leukocytes in Women with PCOS is Reversed by Aerobic Exercise\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCovington, Jeffrey D.; Tam, Charmaine S.; Pasarica, Magdalena; Redman, Leanne M.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by insulin resistance, elevated circulating leukocytes, and hypothesized to have higher adipose tissue inflammation. Aerobic exercise reduces circulating leukocytes and improves insulin sensitivity in obese individuals, but the effect of exercise on inflammation in PCOS is not known. We investigated circulating leukocytes, insulin sensitivity by euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp, serum pro- and anti-inflammatory markers (hsCRP, TNF-Î±, total and high molecular weight adiponectin), and abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) gene expression of proinflammatory markers in 8 PCOS women and 8 obese control females matched for BMI. Additionally, in a prospective study, the 8 women with PCOS underwent a 16-week aerobic exercise regimen with the same measures performed post-intervention. Compared to controls, white blood cell counts (WBC) were 30% higher (p = 0.04) and circulating total adiponectin levels were 150% lower (p = 0.03) in women with PCOS at baseline/pre-exercise conditions. SAT gene expression of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF, p < 0.01) and interleukin-6 (IL-6, p < 0.05) were also lower in women with PCOS. In response to 16 weeks of aerobic exercise, insulin sensitivity improved (p < 0.01) and WBC counts decreased (p = 0.02). The exercise-induced change in WBC and circulating neutrophils correlated inversely with changes in glucose disposal rate (r= -0.73, p=0.03; and r= -0.82, p=0.01, respectively). Aerobic exercise reduced serum leptin (p < 0.05) after 4 weeks, trended to reduce the ratio of leptin-to-high molecular weight adiponectin (p < 0.1) by the 8th week, and significantly increased serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S, p < 0.001) after 16 weeks. In conclusion, women with PCOS have higher circulating leukocytes compared to controls, which can be reversed by aerobic exercise and is associated with improvements in insulin sensitivity.

The differences in steroid hormones were amplified in lean PCOS versus lean controls compared with obese PCOS versus obese controls. Compared with obese PCOS, lean PCOS demonstrated increased dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (Pâ=â0.015), 17-hydropregnenolone (Pâ=â0.003), 17-hydroprogesterone (17-OHP) (Pâ<â0.001), progesterone (Pâ<â0.001) and estrone (Pâ<â0.001) levels. Enzyme activity evaluation showed that lean PCOS had increased activity of P450c17 (17-hydropregnenolone/pregnenolone, Pâ<â0.001), P450aro (Pâ<â0.001), 3Î²HSD2 (progesterone/ pregnenolone and 17-OHP/17-hydropregnenolone, both Pâ<â0.001) and decreased activity of P450c21(11-deoxycorticorsterone/progesterone and 11-deoxycortisol/17-OHP, Pâ<â0.001). Moreover, we found higher frequencies of CYP21A2- (encoding P450c21) c.552âCâ>âG (p. D184E) in lean PCOS compared with obese PCOS patients (Pâ=â0.006). In conclusion, this study demonstrated for the first time that the adrenal-specific enzyme P450c21 showed decreased activity in lean PCOS patients, and that the adrenal androgen excess may play different roles in lean and obese PCOS patients, which represents as different enzyme activity in the steroidogenic pathway.\n\nDysregulation of glucose metabolism even in Chinese PCOS women with normal glucose tolerance.\n\nPubMed\n\nLi, Weiping; Li, Qifu\n\n2012-01-01\n\nTo clarify the necessity of improving glucose metabolism in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) women as early as possible, 111 PCOS women with normal glucose tolerance and 92 healthy age-matched controls were recruited to investigate glucose levels distribution, insulin sensitivity and Î² cell function. 91 PCOS women and 33 controls underwent hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp to assess their insulin sensitivity, which was expressed as M value. Î² cell function was estimated by homeostatic model assessment (HOMA)-Î² index after adjusting insulin sensitivity (HOMA-Î²ad index). Compared with lean controls, lean PCOS women had similar fasting plasma glucose (FPG), higher postprandial plasma glucose (PPG) (6.03Â±1.05 vs. 5.44Â±0.97 mmol/L, P<0.05), lower M value but similar HOMA-Î²ad index, while overweight/obese PCOS women had higher levels of both FPG (5.24Â±0.58 vs. 4.90Â±0.39, P<0.05) and PPG (6.15Â±0.84 vs. 5.44Â±0.97 mmol/L, P<0.05), and lower levels of both M value and HOMA-Î²ad index. Linear regression and ROC analysis found BMI was independently associated with M value and HOMA-Î²ad index in PCOS women separately, and the cutoff of BMI indicating impaired Î² cell function of PCOS women was 25.545kg/mÂ². In conclusion, insulin resistance and dysregulation of glucose metabolism were common in Chinese PCOS women with normal glucose tolerance. BMI â¥ 25.545kg/mÂ² indicated impaired Î² cell function in PCOS women with normal glucose tolerance.\n\nEffect of Metformin and Flutamide on Anthropometric Indices and Laboratory Tests in Obese/Overweight PCOS Women under Hypocaloric Diet\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAmiri, Mania; Golsorkhtabaramiri, Masoumeh; Esmaeilzadeh, Sedigheh; Ghofrani, Faeze; Bijani, Ali; Ghorbani, Leila; Delavar, Moloud Agajani\n\n2014-01-01\n\nBackground This study was designed to investigate the effect of metformin and flutamide alone or in combination with anthropometric indices and laboratory tests of obese/overweight PCOS women under hypocaloric diet. Methods This single blind clinical trial was performed on 120 PCOS women. At the beginning, hypocaloric diet was recommended for the patients. After one month while they were on the diet, the patients were randomly divided in 4 groups; metformin (500 mg, 3/day), flutamide (250 mg, 2/day), combined, metformin (500 mg, 3/day) with flutamide (250 mg, 2/day) and finally placebo group. The patients were treated for 6 months. Anthropometric indices and laboratory tests (fasting and glucose-stimulated insulin levels, lipid profile and androgens) were measured. A one-way ANOVA (Post Hoc) and paired t-test were performed to analyze data. A p â¤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results After treatment, reduction in weight, BMI, hip circumference was significantly greater in the metformin group in comparison to other groups (p<0.05). In addition, the fasting insulin was significantly greater in metformin group and flutamide group in comparison to metformin+flutamide and placebo groups after treatment (p<0.05). Within groups, insulin level showed significant changes (before and after treatment) in metformin+flutamide group and LDL reduction was significant in flutamide group before and after treatment. Post hoc tukey and two-tailed with pâ¤0.05 were used to define statistical significance. Conclusion Using combination of metformin and flutamide improves anthropometric indices and laboratory tests in obese/overweight PCOS women under hypocaloric diet.

However, over-emphasis on PCOS as a risk factor potentially results in over-investigation and treatment of some women with and under-recognition of cardiometabolic risk in obese women without PCOS. Our objective was to explore the association between waist circumference (WC) and indices of glucose and lipid metabolism in women with and without PCOS. (i) An exploratory cross-sectional study investigating association of potential cardiometabolic risk markers (PCOS status, anthropometric measures, hsCRP, HOMA-IR, SHBG, testosterone) with indices of glucose (frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test) and lipid metabolism (postprandial studies and lipoprotein particle size) in 61 women with (nÂ =Â 29) and without (nÂ =Â 32) PCOS; (ii) a cross-sectional study in 103 PCOS women and 102 BMI-matched controls to explore if between-group differences in indices of lipid and glucose metabolism persist after adjusting for WC. NIH criteria were used for PCOS diagnosis. Study 1: Univariate correlations and stepwise regression modelling identified waist circumference (WC), as a better surrogate than PCOS status, independently predicting multiple variables of glucose and lipid metabolism. Study 2: Fasting insulin and triglyceride, hsCRP and insulin resistance (according to HOMA-IR and SiM [Avignon index]) were greater, while fasting HDL was lower in women with PCOS compared to BMI-matched women without PCOS. None of these differences persisted when a subset of 80 women with PCOS was compared with 80 women without PCOS, pair-matched for WC. Some cardiometabolic abnormalities in PCOS are related to central obesity, and following adjustment for WC does not differ from normal subjects. Waist circumference measurement has potential to take precedence over PCOS status as part of the assessment of cardiometabolic risk in reproductive-age women.

Leptin, NPY, galanin, cholecystokinin (CCK) are involved in the regulation of eating behavior. PPARÎ³ are receptors that are probably involved in hyperandrogenism. This study was designed to assess associations between the Pro12Ala PPARÎ³2 gene polymorphism and satiety factors in PCOS. Fifty-four PCOS women and 51 healthy women were studied. Leptin, NPY, galanin, CCK levels, and genetic studies to detect Pro12Ala PPARÎ³2 gene polymorphism were assessed. The leptin levels in the PCOS women carrying Pro12Ala genotype were higher than in those with Pro12Pro and Ala12Ala. The PCOS women had higher leptin and NPY levels and lower galanin levels. Obese PCOS patients had lower CCK levels. In the PCOS women, a single Ala allele may have a protective role as far as hyperleptinemia is concerned. The PCOS women may reveal a disrupted central leptin/NPY feedback loop with some shifts in food intake.\n\nSurgical management of metabolic dysfunction in PCOS.\n\nPubMed\n\nEscobar-Morreale, HÃ©ctor F\n\n2012-03-10\n\nMetabolic disturbances are common in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Obesity is the major link in the association of PCOS with diabetes, metabolic syndrome, hypertension, low-grade chronic inflammation and increased body iron stores, among others. Metabolic prevention in PCOS women should start as early as possible, usually meaning at diagnosis. Among preventive strategies, those promoting a healthy life-style based on diet, regular exercising and smoking cessation are possibly the most effective therapies, but also are the most difficult to achieve. To this regard, every effort must be made to avoid weight gain and obesity, given the deleterious impact that obesity exerts on the metabolic and cardiovascular associations of PCOS. Unfortunately, classic strategies that address obesity by life-style modification and dieting are seldom successful on a long-term basis, especially in women with severe obesity. In selected cases, metabolic surgery in severely obese women may resolve signs and symptoms of PCOS restoring insulin sensitivity and fertility, and avoiding the long-term risks associated with PCOS and morbid obesity. Surgical techniques for bariatric surgery have evolved in the past decades and newer procedures do not longer carry the severe side effects associated with earlier bariatric procedures. The choice of bariatric procedure should consider both the severity of obesity and the possibility of future pregnancy, since fertility may be restored by the sustained and marked weight loss usually attained after bariatric surgery. Finally, avoidance of the risks associated with morbid obesity compensate for the possible residual risks for pregnancy derived from the previous bariatric procedure itself.

Of the total of 140 women, thirty obese and thirty nonobese, aged 20-40 years, were included in the study. Inclusion criteria were the women with normal level of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), prolactin (PRL), parathyroid hormone (PTH), and calcium, and those who had not received any medication or VD supplementation within the last 6 months. Serum 25- hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), C-reactive protein (CRP), lipid profile, fasting serum glucose, basal insulin, homeostasis model analysis of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), oestrogen, total testosterone, dehidroepiandrostendion-sulphat (DHEA-S), androstendione, and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) were determined at follicular phase. Body mass index (BMI), weight, waist, lipids, and CRP were significantly higher in obese than in non-obese PCOS women (p=0.000). Meanwhile, insulin and HOMA-IR were also higher in the obese PCOS (p less than 0.000), and so was the fasting glucose (p=0.004). Furthermore, obese PCOS showed significantly higher level of LH (p=0.012), but lower level of progesterone (p=0.001) and androstendione (p=0.006) than in non-obese PCOS. In total 68% of PCOS women had VD deficiency but without significant difference among groups according to BMI. There was no association of VD deficiency with gonadotropins and sex hormones except SHBG. Insulin resistance was a better independent risk factor for the presence of vitamin D deficiency than SHBG. The insulin resistance and vitamin D deficiency significantly predicted the obesity risk in PCOS women.\n\nClinical, hormonal and metabolic characteristics of polycystic ovary syndrome among obese and nonobese women in the Croatian population.\n\nPubMed\n\nBaldani, Dinka PaviciÄ; SkrgatiÄ, Lana; Goldstajn, Marina Sprem; VrciÄ, Hrvoje; CaniÄ, Tomislav; Strelec, Mihajlo\n\n2013-06-01\n\nObesity has a deteriorating impact on women with PCOS, although prevalence and the impact of specific traits of PCOS remain inconstant in different populations. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the differences in clinical, hormonal and metabolic features between obese and nonobese Croatian women diagnosed as having PCOS according to Rotterdam consensus criteria. The study included 74 obese and 208 nonobese women with PCOS. Clinical, biochemical and metabolic variables were compared among those PCOS subgroups. Obese subjects with PCOS had a higher risk of developing oligo-amenorrhea (OR 3.7; 95% CI, 1.1-12.5) and lower risk for developing hirsutism and acne (OR 0.2; 95% CI, 0.1-0.3 and OR 0.8; 95% CI 0.5-1.4, respectively). Obese PCOS subjects also had a higher risk of developing hyperandrogenemia (OR 2.5; CI 95% 0.9-6.7), insulin resistance (OR 4.5; CI 95%, 2.6-7.9), hypercholesterolemia (OR 5.0, CI 95% 2.5-10.2), hypertriglyceridemia (OR 5.2; 95% CI, 2.9-9.2) as well as elevated serum CRP levels (OR 4.1; 95% CI 1.4-12.2) compared to nonobese PCOS women. In conclusion, nonobese Croatian women with PCOS are more inclined to cosmetic problems associated with PCOS then metabolic ones. This is the first study to report the impact of obesity on acne and irregular menses as a study outcome. Obesity deteriorates menstrual regularity, insulin sensitivity and lipid profile in Croatian women with PCOS; therefore one of the fundamental treatment strategies of PCOS should be obesity prevention.\n\nCortisol production rate is similarly elevated in obese women with or without the polycystic ovary syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nRoelfsema, Ferdinand; Kok, Petra; Pereira, Alberto M; Pijl, Hanno\n\n2010-07-01\n\nThe pituitary-adrenal axis in obesity and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is marked by increased urinary excretion of cortisol and its metabolites. It is not as yet clear whether the increased cortisol production in PCOS is related to obesity per se. We investigated 15 obese PCOS women with a body mass index of 30-54 kg/m(2) and 15 healthy obese controls (body mass index 31-60 kg/m(2)) with a regular menstrual cycle. Patients and control women underwent 24-h blood sampling at 20-min intervals. Cortisol concentrations were measured with a sensitive assay. Data were analyzed with a new deconvolution program, approximate entropy, and cosinor regression. Basal, pulsatile, and total cortisol production expressed per liter distribution volume, per square meter body surface, and as absolute amount per 24 h was similar in PCOS patients and matched healthy control women. In addition, the regularity of cortisol secretion and the diurnal properties were identical. Compared with 10 lean control women, mean cortisol production per liter distribution volume was similar in the three groups, but the total 24-h cortisol production was increased in obese control women and PCOS women. This study demonstrates equally increased cortisol production in PCOS women and obese healthy control women.\n\nParaoxonase lactonase activity (PON-HTLase), asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and platelet activating factor-acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) activity in non-obese women with PCOS.\n\nPubMed\n\nBayrak, Tulin; Dursun, Polat; Bayrak, Ahmet; GÃ¼ltekin, Murat; KolusarÄ±, Ali; CakÄ±r, ErdinÃ§; Ozyurt, Merve; ZeyneloÄlu, Hulusi B\n\n2012-11-01\n\nParaoxonase1 (PON1), exhibits both esterase activity (PON1-AREase) and homocysteine thiolactonase activity (PON1-HTLase) which respectively prevent LDL oxidation and detoxify homocysteine thiolactone (HTL). Platelet-activating factor-acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) is an antioxidant enzyme preventing LDL oxidation by hydrolysis of oxidized phospholipids. Both of these enzymes exhibit a proatherogenic role. ADMA is an endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis causing endothelial dysfunction. The aim was to compare non-obese PCOS patients with a BMI matched control group using the following characteristics: serum PON1-HTLase, ADMA, PAF-AH, and lipid and hormonal parameters. 77 women with PCOS and 25 healthy subject were recruited for this study, The controls were non-obese BMI and age matched with the patients. There were no significant differences with respect to age, BMI, FSH, free testosterone, DHEA, androstenadion, total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL, LDL, VLDL, fasting glucose/insulin ratio and HOMA-IR among the groups (p > 0.05). However, total testosterone and fasting glucose levels were significantly higher in the PCOS group (p < 0.05). On the other hand, PON1-HTLase levels (39.6 Â± 5.77 vs. 33.8 Â± 8.2, p = 0.02) were significantly lower in the PCOS group while ADMA levels (1.14 Â± 0.6 vs. 3.37 Â± 6.4, p = 0.004) were significantly higher in the PCOS group. However, there was no significant difference in PAF-AH activity among the groups. Decreased PON1-HTLase and increased ADMA levels might be a relevant marker for the development of future atherosclerotic heart disease (AHD) in non-obese PCOS patients. Further studies are needed to confirm our results.\n\nBiomarker Profiles in Women with PCOS and PCOS Offspring; A Pilot Study.\n\nPubMed\n\nDaan, Nadine M P; Koster, Maria P H; de Wilde, Marlieke A; Dalmeijer, Gerdien W; Evelein, Annemieke M V; Fauser, Bart C J M; de Jager, Wilco\n\n2016-01-01\n\nTo study metabolic/inflammatory biomarker risk profiles in women with PCOS and PCOS offspring. Cross-sectional comparison of serum biomarkers. University Medical Center Utrecht. Hyperandrogenic PCOS women (HA-PCOS, n = 34), normoandrogenic PCOS women (NA-PCOS, n = 34), non-PCOS reference population (n = 32), PCOS offspring (n = 14, age 6-8 years), and a paedriatic reference population (n = 30). Clustering profile of adipocytokines (IL-1b, IL-6, IL-13, IL-17, IL-18, TNF-Î±, adiponectin, adipsin, leptin, chemerin, resistin, RBP4, DPP-IV/sCD26, CCL2/MCP-1), growth factors (PIGF, VEGF, sVEGF-R1), soluble cell adhesion molecules (sICAM-1/sCD54, sVCAM-1/sCD106), and other inflammatory related proteases (MMP-9, S100A8, Cathepsin S). Differences in median biomarker concentrations between groups, and associations with the free androgen index (FAI; Testosterone/SHBG x100). The cluster analysis identified leptin, RBP-4, DPP-IV and adiponectin as potential discriminative markers for HA-PCOS with a specifically strong correlation in cases with increased BMI. Leptin (R2 = 0.219) and adiponectin (R2 = 0.182) showed the strongest correlation with the FAI. When comparing median protein concentrations adult PCOS women with or without hyperandrogenemia, the most profound differences were observed for leptin (P < 0.001), DPP-IV (P = 0.005), and adiponectin (P < 0.001). Adjusting for age, BMI and multiple testing attenuated all differences. In PCOS offspring, MMP-9 (P = 0.001) and S100A8 (P < 0.001) concentrations were significantly higher compared to a healthy matched reference population, even after correcting for age and BMI and adjustment for multiple testing. In this preliminary investigation we observed significant differences in adipocytokines between women with or without hyperandrogenic PCOS and non-PCOS controls, mostly influenced by BMI. Leptin and adiponectin showed the strongest correlation with the FAI in adult women with PCOS.

H.; de Wilde, Marlieke A.; Dalmeijer, Gerdien W.; Evelein, Annemieke M. V.; Fauser, Bart C. J. M.; de Jager, Wilco\n\n2016-01-01\n\nObjective To study metabolic/inflammatory biomarker risk profiles in women with PCOS and PCOS offspring. Design Cross-sectional comparison of serum biomarkers. Setting University Medical Center Utrecht. Patients Hyperandrogenic PCOS women (HA-PCOS, n = 34), normoandrogenic PCOS women (NA-PCOS, n = 34), non-PCOS reference population (n = 32), PCOS offspring (n = 14, age 6â8 years), and a paedriatic reference population (n = 30). Main Outcome Measure(s) Clustering profile of adipocytokines (IL-1b, IL-6, IL-13, IL-17, IL-18, TNF-Î±, adiponectin, adipsin, leptin, chemerin, resistin, RBP4, DPP-IV/sCD26, CCL2/MCP-1), growth factors (PIGF, VEGF, sVEGF-R1), soluble cell adhesion molecules (sICAM-1/sCD54, sVCAM-1/sCD106), and other inflammatory related proteases (MMP-9, S100A8, Cathepsin S). Differences in median biomarker concentrations between groups, and associations with the free androgen index (FAI; Testosterone/SHBG x100). Results The cluster analysis identified leptin, RBP-4, DPP-IV and adiponectin as potential discriminative markers for HA-PCOS with a specifically strong correlation in cases with increased BMI. Leptin (R2 = 0.219) and adiponectin (R2 = 0.182) showed the strongest correlation with the FAI. When comparing median protein concentrations adult PCOS women with or without hyperandrogenemia, the most profound differences were observed for leptin (P < 0.001), DPP-IV (P = 0.005), and adiponectin (P < 0.001). Adjusting for age, BMI and multiple testing attenuated all differences. In PCOS offspring, MMP-9 (P = 0.001) and S100A8 (P < 0.001) concentrations were significantly higher compared to a healthy matched reference population, even after correcting for age and BMI and adjustment for multiple testing. Conclusion In this preliminary investigation we observed significant differences in adipocytokines between women with or without hyperandrogenic PCOS and non-PCOS controls, mostly influenced by BMI. Leptin and adiponectin showed the strongest correlation with\n\nPsychological Distress Is More Prevalent in Fertile Age and Premenopausal Women With PCOS Symptoms: 15-Year Follow-Up.\n\nPubMed\n\nKarjula, Salla; Morin-Papunen, Laure; Auvinen, Juha; Ruokonen, Aimo; Puukka, Katri; Franks, Stephen; JÃ¤rvelin, Marjo-Riitta; Tapanainen, Juha S; Jokelainen, Jari; Miettunen, Jouko; Piltonen, Terhi T\n\n2017-06-01\n\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with increased psychological distress, obesity and hyperandrogenism being suggested as key promoters. To investigate the prevalence of anxiety/depression and their coexistence in women with PCOS/PCOS-related symptoms at ages 31 and 46. The roles of obesity, hyperandrogenism, and awareness of PCOS on psychological distress were also assessed. Population-based follow-up. Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 with 15-year follow-up. At age 31, a questionnaire-based screening for oligoamenorrhea (OA) and hirsutism (H): 2188 asymptomatic (controls), 331 OA, 323 H, and 125 OA plus H (PCOS). Follow-up at age 46: 1576 controls, 239 OA, 231 H, and 85 PCOS. Questionnaire-based screening for anxiety and depression symptoms (Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25) and previously diagnosed/treated depression at ages 31 and 46. Body mass index (BMI), serum testosterone/free androgen index, and awareness of polycystic ovaries/PCOS on psychological distress were also assessed. Population-based prevalence of anxiety and/or depression in women with PCOS/PCOS-related symptoms at ages 31 and 46. Anxiety and/or depression symptoms, their coexistence, and rate of depression were increased at ages 31 and 46 in women with PCOS or isolated H compared with controls. High BMI or hyperandrogenism did not associate with increased anxiety or depression symptoms. The awareness of PCOS was associated with increased anxiety. Women with PCOS or isolated H present more often with anxiety and/or depression symptoms and their coexistence compared with controls. High BMI or hyperandrogenism did not provoke psychological distress in PCOS. The awareness of PCOS increased anxiety but did not associate with severe anxiety or depression.

A role of OGTT?\n\nPubMed\n\nAndersen, Marianne Skovsager; Glintborg, Dorte\n\n2018-06-19\n\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is common in premenopausal women. The majority of women with PCOS have insulin resistance and the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) is higher in women with PCOS compared to controls. In non-pregnant women with PCOS, glycemic status may be assessed by oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), or HbA1c. OGTT has been reckoned gold standard test for diagnosing T2D, but OGTT is rarely used for diagnostic purpose in other non-pregnant individuals at risk of T2D, apart from PCOS. OGTT has questionable reproducibility, and the high sensitivity of the 2 hour glucose value is at the expense of relatively low specificity, especially regarding impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). Furthermore, lean women with PCOS are rarely diagnosed with T2D and only few percent of normal-weight women have prediabetes. Glycemic status is necessary at diagnosis and during follow-up of PCOS, especially in women with high risk of T2D (obesity, previous gestational diabetes (GDM)). We suggest that OGTT should be used in the same situations in PCOS as in other patient groups at risk of T2D. OGTT is indicated for diagnosing GDM, however, OGTT during pregnancy may not be indicated in lean women with PCOS without other risk factors for GDM.\n\nThe effect of prolactin levels on MPV in women with PCOS.\n\nPubMed\n\nYilmaz, ÃzgÃ¼r; Calan, Mehmet; Kume, Tuncay; Temur, Muzaffer; Yesil, PÄ±nar; Senses, Mehmet Y\n\n2015-05-01\n\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with cardiovascular risk factors including hypertension, obesity, hyperlipidaemia and glucose intolerance. Several studies demonstrated the link between PCOS and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Platelets play a crucial role in the development of atherothrombotic disease. Mean platelet volume (MPV) is a marker of platelet size that reflects its activity. Research points to a link between prolactin (PRL) and platelet activation. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether prolactin levels are associated with MPV in women with PCOS. The research was designed as a cross-sectional study. Participants were divided into three groups-PCOS patients with mildly elevated PRL levels (n = 72), patients with PCOS with normal PRL levels (n = 207) and healthy controls (n = 90). They were body mass index and age-matched and consecutively recruited. Complete blood counts, serum glucose, prolactin, insulin, lipids, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and free-testosterone levels were measured. Among the three groups, MPV levels were higher in women with PCOS having mildly elevated PRL levels (P < 0Â·001) and MPV was found to be correlated with PRL levels (r = 0Â·387, P < 0Â·001). Multiple regression analysis showed that PRL levels were associated with MPV levels (R(2) = 0Â·239, Î² = 0Â·354, P < 0Â·001). Mean platelet volume levels are significantly increased in women with PCOS having mildly elevat"
