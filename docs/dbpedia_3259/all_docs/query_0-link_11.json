        "text": "The UK has a world-renowned architectural pedigree and has an enviable reputation for quality as the leading exporter of architecture in Europe . However, recent tragic events, such as Grenfell, have raised questions of the UK construction industry’s standards and processes. Institutions have responded with an abundance of regulatory code and quality infrastructures to conflate corporate governance strategies. I ask whether this approach is fit for purpose and how we might imagine an alternative future. Continued political uncertainty has reinforced the importance of maintaining reputation by ensuring quality through institutional forms and practices. For more than 42,000 worldwide RIBA members , recent changes in global trade dynamics will lead to reappraisal of service compatibility and professional mobility. Therefore, management strategies using globally recognized quality infrastructures are increasingly valuable in ensuring the highest possible standards and protecting trade. What if we were to imagine an alternative form of practice, futureproofed to remain competitive in the global marketplace ? What would be the critical factors in designing architectural labour for the fourth industrial revolution, and what might this new model look like? Primary research findings include the demonstration of interrelational distance between architects and their clients historically as well as a snapshot of architectural practice. The research then explores new models of creative labour in architectural practice and prototypes 5 speculative devices aligned with the RIBA Plan of Work to improve quality of the built environment for society.\n\nThe present work aims to create a space for reflection on the ethical training an engineering student receives during their degree studies. This training will facilitate the transmission of the value of responsibility as a quality essential to the proper development of the professional work of a civil engineer. Review of the curriculum of the civil engineering degree at The Universitat Politecnica Valencia in Valencia, Spain, in which it appears explicitly as a competition to the student acquired upon completion of their training &quot;to understand and take ethical and professional responsibility for the activity of the civil engineer&quot;. This review suggests two different methodologies to acquire such competition, responsibility.\n\nTraditionally, the public attributes certain characteristics to professions, including: (1) the profession must serve the needs of society rather than the interests of a special interest group, usually for the benefit of society, with an altruistic goal – as opposed to a materialistic one; (2) the profession should have a group identity and group consciousness that can be recognized by others; (3) the profession should develop and enforce its own code of ethics, standards of practice, and peer review. Underlying these criteria are values that lead to commitment to social goals and to accountability for individual as well as for collective action. This paper aims to elaborate an assertion that we believe to be fundamental: trustworthiness and integrity are cardinal virtues for engineers."
