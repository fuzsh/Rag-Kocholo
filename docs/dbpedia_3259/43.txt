Greek players on target in Europe Fanis Gekas and Sotiris Kyrgiakos, two of the Greek players who have announced their departure from the national soccer team, went on the score sheet last weekend for their clubs in Europe. Striker Gekas scored for the third round of games in succession, netting the first goal in Eintracht Frankfurt’s 2-1 victory over VfB Stuttgart yesterday. Gekas is now second on the scorers’ chart in the Bundesliga. Kyrgiakos, a central defender, was on target for Liverpool yesterday in Anfield, but he will not have enjoyed it as much given that the Reds surprisingly went down 2-1 to visiting Blackpool.
