        "text": "In Corpore\n\nIn Corpore delves deep into the grey areas of relationships, exploring how four couples deal with love and lust, commitment and infidelity, and traditional expectations versus self-fulfilment.\n\nWith four stories taking place in Berlin, Malta, Melbourne and New York, this international film tackles the consequences faced when one chooses to suppress or give into the inner desires of body and soul.\n\n\"Fearlessly acted, adequately shot, and nicely edited, In Corpore boldly examines the complexities of relationships.\" ~ Film Threat Review\n\n\"The DNA of such landmark empowerment films as Paul Mazurky’s An Unmarried Woman (1978) and Claudia Weill’s Girlfriends (1978) courses through its veins. Like those independently-minded films, In Corpore may also emerge as a work that ushered in a period of social change.\" ~ Screen-Space Review\n\n\"In Corpore goes deeper than its more titillating moments. There is a strong story regarding gender norms and identity.\" ~ AIPT\n\n\"The film ... features sufficient emotional truth to make it worthwhile viewing for broad-minded audiences.\" ~ The Hollywood Reporter"
