        "text": "Bela's Pancho Arango drives an automobile but Bela Lugosi is never seen behind the wheel, only exiting. It has been reported that, in real life, Bela Lugosi never drove, and that it was his wife Lillian who drove him around. However, in The Return of Chandu (1934), Bela is clearly seen driving down a winding mountain road.\n\nIn September 1928, Warner Bros. Pictures purchased a majority interest in First National Pictures and from that point on, all \"First National\" productions were actually made under Warner Bros. control, even though the two companies continued to retain separate identities until the mid-1930's, after which time \"A Warner Bros.-First National Picture\" was often used."
