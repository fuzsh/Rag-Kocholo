        "text": "Early work\n\nAfter the LeRoy family home was destroyed in the San Francisco earthquake of 1906, LeRoy earned his first money by selling newspapers; that became his entreé to show business when one of his customers helped him get a part onstage as a newsboy. He performed in vaudeville as “the Singing Newsboy.” His cousin Jesse Lasky helped him get a job folding costumes at Famous Players–Lasky in 1919, and from there he ascended from lab technician to assistant cameraman. LeRoy managed a parallel career as an actor, often playing juveniles in films from 1922 to 1924.\n\nAfter he outgrew those parts, LeRoy moved behind the scenes, writing gags (and sometimes more) for such Colleen Moore pictures as Sally (1925), Ella Cinders (1926), and Twinkletoes (1926). In 1927 Warner Brothers signed him to direct, and he commenced this most-important phase of his career with such low-budget efforts as Harold Teen (1928) and Oh Kay! (1928). Hot Stuff (1929), a comedy with Alice White, was his first sound picture, and White also starred in Broadway Babies (1929) and Show Girl in Hollywood (1930), an inside-Hollywood yarn with portions shot in Technicolor.\n\nAt Warner Brothers in the 1930s: Little Caesar, I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang, and Gold Diggers of 1933\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nOscar-Worthy Movie Trivia\n\nAlso in 1930 came Numbered Men, a prison drama, and Top Speed, a Joe E. Brown musical comedy. Then came Little Caesar (1931), the film that made LeRoy’s reputation, with Edward G. Robinson as a Capone-like crime czar. It stands as one of the seminal gangster pictures, along with William Wellman’s The Public Enemy (1931) and Howard Hawks’s Scarface (1932).\n\nGentleman’s Fate, Too Young to Marry, and Broadminded, the latter another comedy with Brown, all followed in 1931, though none had the impact of Little Caesar. However, Five Star Final (1931) again had the benefit of Robinson, this time playing a hard-boiled newspaper editor whose ethics are twisted out of shape in his pursuit of higher circulation. Local Boy Makes Good, yet another vehicle for Brown, and Tonight or Never completed LeRoy’s slate for 1931—seven releases, an impressive figure even by the standards of the time. High Pressure (1932) offered William Powell in top comic form as a promoter trying to find investors for an artificial rubber process, and Two Seconds (1932) had Robinson playing a convicted murderer who has just moments to relive his miserable existence before the electric chair ends it all.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

One of LeRoy’s most notable films was I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang (1932), a blistering adaptation of Robert E. Burns’s account of his horrible experiences in a Georgia prison camp. The film and Paul Muni’s harrowing portrayal of the unjustly imprisoned convict were nominated for Academy Awards. Hard to Handle (1933) did not have any such social consciousness but remains a fine example of Warner Brothers’s pre-Production Code comedies, with James Cagney as a press agent who will promote anything and everything.\n\nElmer, the Great (1933) had Brown as a very un-Ruthian home-run slugger, but it was the musical Gold Diggers of 1933 that became a classic. A follow-up to 42nd Street (1933), it had essentially the same cast and dance director Busby Berkeley, who staged such memorable production numbers as “We’re in the Money,” “Remember My Forgotten Man,” and “Pettin’ in the Park.” Tugboat Annie (1933), starring Wallace Beery and Marie Dressler, was another smash. LeRoy’s fifth release of 1933 was The World Changes, a soap opera starring Muni as a meatpacking tycoon and Mary Astor as his snobbish wife.\n\nThe advent in 1934 of the Production Code, which greatly restricted what could be shown on-screen, did not meld at first with LeRoy’s strengths. Hi, Nellie! (1934) had Muni again, this time in a minor newspaper story. Heat Lightning (1934) was a crime drama set in a gas station and motel in the Mojave Desert. Sweet Adeline (1934), a period musical, starred Irene Dunne as a Hoboken beer-garden singer and was awash in Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein II songs. In the comedy Page Miss Glory (1935), Marion Davies starred as a chambermaid who happens to resemble a composite photo created by con men to win a beauty contest. I Found Stella Parish (1935) was a soap opera with Kay Francis as an actress trying to cover up her scarlet past.\n\nLeRoy was finally given a prestige property with Anthony Adverse (1936), a hugely successful costume drama set in the 18th century and based on the Hervey Allen best seller. Fredric March starred as the globe-trotting hero, and the cast included Olivia de Havilland, Claude Rains, and Gale Sondergaard, who won the first Oscar for best supporting actress. The film was nominated for best picture.\n\nThey Won’t Forget (1937) was the most serious drama LeRoy had been given in years. Based on a novel by Ward Greene that dramatized the 1913 rape and murder of a 15-year-old Atlanta girl (played by Lana Turner, who was under personal contract to LeRoy) and the subsequent trial, the film was a powerful indictment of political ambition. But then came the frothy Fools for Scandal (1938), starring Carole Lombard and Fernand Gravet as lovebirds in Paris. These last two films were also produced by LeRoy, but it was becoming clear that Warner Brothers had no sense of what projects best suited him."
