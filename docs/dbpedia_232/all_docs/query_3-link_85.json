        "text": "So yesterday I sat down and took a deep breath and said, “Wow, thank goodness, 31 Days of Oscar is almost over.” And then I thought, “That means February is almost over.” And then I remembered I had to do this post. Good on me!\n\nFor those of you who are enthused about things that I am not, March 2020’s Star of the Month on Turner Classic Movies is none other than Joe E. Brown, whose massive mouth made him a reliable comic actor and leading man at Warners for much of the pre-Code era. Brown is an excellent actor and a great physical specimen, even if most of his movies are pretty dopey. I have a lot to catch this month, too, so here’s to that.\n\nAlso on the schedule are pre-Code tributes to people like Jean Harlow, Edward Everett Horton and Reginald Denny, which I know will make at least a few people happy.\n\nOtherwise, we’re less than two months away from the 11th annual Turner Classic Movies Classic Film Festival (TCMFF). I will be attending again this year, pending any pandemic or suspicious nitrate explosion. They’ve already announced four pre-Codes being shown, two of which are among my favorites: Jewel Robbery, The Sin of Nora Moran, Dinner at Eight, and Counselor at Law.\n\nThe last one will be shown at the Egyptian on nitrate with Leonard Maltin being given the annual Robert Osborne Award, and, if it’s anything like last year’s capper with A Woman of Affairs, it will be amazing.\n\nAs usual, I’m making pins for the festival to give away– all you have to do is recognize my ugly mug– as well as exclusive ones for backers. I’m still tinkering, but here’s one I’ve got for 2020 so far:\n\nIf you want the exclusive pin, you can become a Patron over at Patreon and be sure to allow me to access your address. It is very hard to send things to people otherwise. Every dollar helps!\n\nFor March, I also hope to continue my reviews through the early films of Cary Grant and any Joe E. Brown movies I haven’t seen– as many as there are.\n\nPre-Code Movies on TCM in March\n\nPlease note:\n\nAll times listed here are Eastern Standard.
