        "text": "National Film Registry, list of movies selected for preservation by the U.S. Library of Congress, in consultation with its National Film Preservation Board, the public, and LOC film curators. Every year, 25 films that have been deemed “culturally, historically or aesthetically significant” to America’s film heritage are added to the registry. While the selections are typically American movies, any work “originally created on film stock” is eligible.\n\nThe National Film Registry was established through the National Film Preservation Act of 1988. The legislation also created the National Film Preservation Board. While that group advises the Librarian of Congress on various matters related to American cinema, its most notable task is recommending movies for inclusion on the list. The public is also encouraged to make suggestions. Because of the registry’s broad eligibility requirements, TV programs, commercials, and videos can be considered, as can foreign-made works. However, priority is given to American films."
