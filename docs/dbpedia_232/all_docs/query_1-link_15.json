The company was formed in 1924 and the studio began construction in March of 1926 with its first production beginning only 3 month later. The original studio consisted of 4 stages, a few buildings built on a 68 acre parcel of land once owned by Luther Burbank.\n\nWarner Bros.acquired the site in 1928 giving them 4 studio properties: their original lot on Sunset Blvd., two as a result of their acquisition of Vitagraph (one in east Hollywood, and one in Flatbush, New York), and the new Burbank property.\n\nAfter Warner Bros. purchased the property, expansion continued at a frenzied pace with the addition of several sound stages and Hollywood's first permanent backlot.\n\nIn 1929 Warner Bros. purchased adjacent property to expand the backlot, and a 30 acre parcel up on Hollywood Way that today is known as Warner Ranch. In 1931 they bought Teddington Studios in London.\n\nNearby cities:"
