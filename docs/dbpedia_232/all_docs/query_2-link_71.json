        "text": "Joe E. Brown's latest effusion is intended primarily for the Summer life of the country and for those who like their comedy—well, with Joe E. Brown. Categorically, the first will allow a multitude of sins and omissions and the second will find peace in tricks with fountain pens and baby cars. That there are considerable of both seemed to be shown by the laughter—mild, anyway—which greeted the varied incidents of \"Broad Minded\" yesterday.The Strand's new occupant makes no pretentions beyond that of a program bit, with well-remembered situations and tried encounters between comic heroes and their fates. It is built around a series of misunderstandings, with letters and exposures and embarrassing circumstances. With half a dozen songs and a chorus it would be a musical comedy along the usual lines; nothing more Summery by nature than that could easily be found. And Joe E. Brown is all of it; or vice versa.The story is about a gay young man and the even gayer young lady who wants to marry him. His father decides to send him away, putting him in the care of his cousin—in this case, Mr. Brown. The trip West is made in a baby car, and there are adventures of one kind or another on the way. Then love, and further complications, set in (as they will in California) but strained circumstances ultimately iron out themselves. Life goes on Again.As the cousin, Mr. Brown plays in his usual boisterous fashion, although even he is not agile enough to keep up to some of \"Broad Minded's\" more far-reaching climaxes. William Collier Jr. has the part of the gay young man, and at times seems a trifle out of his territory. Ona Munson and Marjorie White have the two main parts opposite them. But it is all very difficult.\n\nLife in California.BROAD MINDED, based on a story by Harry Ruby and Bert Kalmer; directed by Mervyn LeRoy; a First National Picture.

George GrandeeThe restless screen of the Cameo goes in for science this week, with a picture that abandons the emotional high seriousness of cinematic art in favor of combined instruction and entertainment. For in \"The Mystery of Life\" the theories and proofs of evolution are laid down with deft explanations by Professor Parshley of Smith College and Clarence Darrow. It was the latter who emerged from the Scopes trial battered but unbowed.The picture is excellent in the way it presents its material—the history of life. It is constructed clearly and with due regard to the steps of the evolutionary doctrines, and if the lectures seem occasionally to be proving their contentions rather blandly, that is their purpose. Despite the laws of Tennessee, the Darwinian theory is plain to them beyond one of Mr. Darrow's reasonable doubts.Starting with the lowest forms of life, and swinging upward to the highest, the picture notes growth and similarities among the species. The so-called \"survival of the fittest\" theory is shown concisely and with examples, for the producers have sought these rather than the charts and graphs which usually accompany such pieces. Professor Parshley gives most of the actual scientific material; Mr. Darrow contenting himself mainly with the whimsical, pessimistic remarks for which he is known. One of them, on the difference between man and beast, is:\"Yes, we think—some of us—some of the time, and occasionally correctly.\"\n\nTheories of Evolution.THE MYSTERY OF LIFE, a film on the theory of evolution, with explanatory lectures by Clarence Darrow and Dr. H. M. Parshley; produced by Classic Productions; short subjects and news reels. At the Cameo.New York being what it was (in the bicycle days) the closing of McGovern's saloon sent Nell—the slavey—into the streets. There she had two choices; she could join the Salvation Army, or else—. She took the Army, and while the father of the flaxen-haired child contracted a cough and served five years for manslaughter, she rescued other sinners from the deep. For she was a sinner, too; like Frankie, she loved her man.Then he came out, tried going straight, failed and finally contracted an engagement for a visit to a bank. But before going he met his Nell—\"Salvation Nell\" by this time—and she tried to talk him out of it. He pushed her away, roughly; and while her heart was breaking she went as usual to the street corner meeting. There he appeared, he had not robbed the bank after all. And so, at the end, he entered the open door.Ralph Graves takes the part of the blustering, sin-sodden Jim Platt, and Helen Chandler is Nell. Kindness suggests a deep blanket over other names, other actors—indeed, over the whole thing. But it might be said that \"Salvation Nell\" did provide the Beacon's followers with certain entertainment. They chuckled at some of the speeches and many of the situations, despite the fact that the picture has no pretentions to comedy. But humor is there, regardless of all that.\n\n\"Brighten the Corner.\"SALVATION NELL, from the play by E. B. Sheldon; directed by James Cruze; a Tiffany picture.

Wally AlbrightThe ubiquitous newsreel cameras appear to have missed nothing in connection with the round-the-world flight of the Messrs. Post and Gatty, and the varied assortment of pictures is the leading feature of the program at the newsreel theatre. The crush at Roosevelt Field, the parade up the lower New York canyon and the reception at City Hall offer the most stirring moments. Mayor \"Walker wins a laugh by pointing out that the fliers must have changed the name of their craft from \"Winnie Mae\" to \"Winnie Must\" about the time they hit the wastes of Siberia.The flight of an autogiro airplane through the mist of Niagara Falls is another interesting feature. It represents daring navigation and exceptional camera work. Kalmikoff, a bearded Russian wrestler, wrings loud laughs with his exhibition at the Milk Fund show, and the Londos-Steele bout has its moments.Other subjects are: Al Smith showing the King of Siam over the Empire State Building; aquatic sports at Bear Mountain and Atlantic City; the Metropolitan women's track and field championships at Astoria; the opening of the Grande Semaine in Paris with the running of the Auteuil steeplechase; a rodeo on the ranch of James J. Jeffries; the French Grand Prix auto race; Japanese girls playing baseball; a parachute jump from an autogiro airplane; the opening of the tourist season in Yellowstone Park; the latest graduation class of the New York Police Department; Queen Wilhelmina of Holland visiting the Dutch exhibit at the Colonial Exposition in Paris; anti-aircraft gun demonstration at Fort Sheridan; the record-shattering run of the new rail Zeppelin; the inauguration of the 33-year-old Governor of Georgia, R. B. Russell Jr.; the annual ceremony of paving the streets with flowers at Genzano, Italy, and a livestock auction at Lancaster, Pa.On Other Screens.\"Fidlovacka,\" a Bohemian dialogue film, is at the Eighth Street Playhouse.At the Hippodrome the feature is \"The Maltese Falcon,\" with Bebe Daniels.\"The Viking\" is at the Little Carnegie Playhouse.The Fifth Avenue Playhouse is showing \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" today and \"Show Boat\" tomorrow and Wednesday.\"Monte Carlo\" is at the Little Picture House today and \"Tarnished Lady\" will be there from tomorrow until Thursday.\"Bachelor Apartment\" is at the Plaza until tomorrow and \"The Iron Man\" will be there from Wednesday until Friday.\"Zwei Herzen Im ¾ Takt\" is still at the Europa.\"The Black Camel,\" is at the Roxy; \"Laughing Sinners,\" at the Capitol; \"The Girl Habit,\" at the Paramount; \"Newly Rich,\" at the Rivoli; \"A Free Soul,\" at the Astor; \"The Smiling Lieutenant,\" at the Criterion; \"Die Privatsekretaerin,\" at the Belmont; \"Sweepstakes,\" at the Mayfair; \"Die Drei von der Tankstelle,\" at the Ufa-Cosmopolitan; \"Maciste in Hell,\" at the Warners'; \"Smart Money,\" at the Winter Garden, and \"The Vice Squad,\" at Loew's State and Paradise."
