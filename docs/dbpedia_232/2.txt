I continued my personal Joe E. Brown retrospective last night by watching BROADMINEDED, another 1931 First National Pictures release that was directed by Mervyn Leroy. Maltin gave this one 2.5 stars and that was probably a tad generous, though I thought BROADMINDED was better than the other Leroy-Brown collaboration I watched, LONELY BOY MAKES GOOD.

This film was too silly to engage me, but the welcome presence of Dracula himself, Bela Lugosi, livened up the proceedings as he spent most of the film chasing and failing to catch Brown. Brown is tasked to chaperone a rich kid on a road trip to Arizona. His snooty father sent him away to break up his romance with, God forbid, an actress.

Along the way they hook up with two females there and the rich guy, played by William Collier, quickly falls in love with one of the two while Brown hooks up with the other. Even the rich kid's daddy approves as his new paramour is from a social register type family. The actress shows up in Arizona to stick up the pot/muck up the proceedings.

Other than Brown & Legosi, I didn't recognize any of the other actors/actresses, though Thelma Todd's name is vaguely familiar.
