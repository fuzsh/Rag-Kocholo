        "text": "Surnames: find yours\n\nSince 2008 I have written a short column for Down Your Way magazine in which I look at the origin of surnames. I’ve concentrated mainly on Yorkshire names because that is the area covered by the publication. When researching the origins of surnames it is wise to look beyond the obvious – something not always done by some surname website compilers whose findings should often be taken with a pinch of salt. Over the centuries scribes and church officials did not always record names properly – perhaps they couldn’t understand a person’s accent, or colloquial terms were used. And it also has to be remembered that up to a couple of hundred years ago not a lot of people could read or write, so they wouldn’t know whether their surnames had been properly written down. There’s a certain amount of guesswork goes on in tracing surname origins and in some cases the truth has been lost over time. I’ve checked as many sources as possible for my research but I’ve also tried to keep my articles brief and light-hearted – I hope you find this section useful and entertaining.\n\nUse your search facility to look for your surname:\n\nAINLEY\n\nWhenever we hear the place-name Ainley nowadays it is usually because there’s some horrendous hold-up on the M62 motorway at Ainley Top above Brighouse. But Ainley was once the name of a whole district, stretching across the steep hillside from Elland. According to expert George Redmonds this area gave rise to the surname Ainley.\n\nThe area took in places like Fixby, Lindley and Knowles.\n\nThe place and the surname have taken on different forms over the centuries. A thousand years ago it was written as Auundeleia which gives a clue to its origins.\n\nThe Old English word ‘leah’&nbsp; means ‘a clearing in a wood’ and there is still wood-land clinging to the steep hillside known as the Ainleys.&nbsp; One theory regarding the first element is that it was originally an Old Norse personal name best interpreted as ‘Agwind’. The meaning of the place-name would, therefore, be Agwind’s clearing.\n\nThe Wakefield Manor Court Rolls (1297-1316) tell us some interesting tales involving the Ainley family and the Toothills of Rastrick. It is recorded that in 1297 William de Avenley was fined 3d for allowing an animal to escape; in 1314 John de Avenley fined 12d for blocking up a pathway within the bounds of Barkisland and a year later Richard de Avenley drew blood from Thomas de Tothill.&nbsp; In 1316 Richard son of Thomas de Aunley sued Thomas de Tothulle for trespass. The feud appears to have gone on for several years – hope they’ve made up by now!\n\nALDERSON\n\nAldersons have lived in Swaledale and areas to the north. There is even an Alderson Family History Society with around 5,000 members. It’s a little unclear how the surname started but it is possible that an Old English first name, Ealdhere (meaning ‘old army’), is the origin. The name Alderson has been uncovered in Lancashire in the 13th century while in February 1545 Gabrell Alderson married Agnes Garnet in Eaglescliffe, Durham. One early recorded spelling of the family name is thought to be that of Richard Aldersson, dated March 10, 1540, a christening witness, at Dewsbury.\n\nARMITAGE\n\nAlthough Armitage is a nationwide name it is most popular in the Huddersfield area. It is derived from the word hermitage and was probably originally given to someone who came from near a hermitage, or a place of learning, or an extinct place bearing the name. Early Yorkshire examples of the surname include:&nbsp; Willelmus del Ermytache (1379) and John de Armitage (Sheffield, 1423). But most of today’s Armitages can be traced back to a family living at Armitage Bridge, near Huddersfield, way back in the fourteenth century.\n\nARMITSTEAD\n\nOtley cyclist Lizzie Armitstead brought her Yorkshire surname to national prominence when she won a silver medal in the 2012 Olympics. The name appears to have started in the Giggleswick area where the place-name can still be found in house and farm titles.\n\nThere are several variant spellings of the surname, such as Ermystead, Armstead and Armistead, all of which mean ‘home of the hermit’. The ‘hermit’ referred to would probably originally been a person who lived somewhere isolated – even in a cave of which there are plenty in the limestone area of Craven.\n\nLaurence de Armitstead and John de Armitstead were mentioned in the 1379 poll tax rolls for Giggleswick and their descendants went on to become landowners and major yeoman families around the district where the name is still popular.\n\nSeveral Armitsteads went on to become clergymen, while one branch, involved in the flax trade,&nbsp; settled in Riga, Latvia. George Armitstead (1847-1912) was Mayor of Riga and a statue of him and his wife can be seen in a park there. His brother James founded a hospital in Riga which still bears his name. The only Armitstead peer – Baron George of Castlehill (1824-1915) – was born in Riga but settled in Dundee where he became an MP. He was, however (or should that be ‘of course’ when talking about a politician), the subject of a scandal involving the daughter of a Scottish laird.\n\nARMSTRONG\n\nArmstrong is a popular Yorkshire name but its origins lie further north. There are several myths and legends surrounding the surname but it is generally agreed that the original bearer was indeed ‘strong in the arm’.\n\nOne traditional tale says that the Scottish Armstrong clan was started by Fairbairn, an armour bearer to a king of Scotland, who rescued his master when his horse was killed in battle. Our hero grabbed the king by his leg and pulled him onto his own horse. Another story claims that the family took their name from Siward Digry (meaning ’sword strong arm’), a nephew of the Danish King Canute. The early Armstrongs were said to be Norse looking: blue-eyed and fair-haired.\n\nRecent DNA studies suggest the clan started in North East Scotland so was probably of Pictish origin. Early documented evidence of the name can be found in Ousby, Cumberland, in 1223 which is no surprise as the Armstrongs were among the clans who became known as the Border Reivers. For around 300 years from the 1300s the English-Scottish border was disputed land somewhat lacking law and order, and the Armstrongs were living on the front line.\n\nIn his book The Steel Bonnets: The Story of the Anglo-Scottish Border Reivers, George MacDonald writes: “The Armstrongs were the most feared and dangerous riding clan on the whole frontier. In Johnnie Armstrong’s day they could put 3,000 men in the saddle and probably did more damage by foray than any other two families combined, both in England and Scotland.”\n\nAt one point, the Armstrong clan was such a powerful force in the borders that King James V of Scotland saw them as a threat to his own authority. It is said that the last Chief of Clan Armstrong – Archibald Armstrong of Mangerton – was hanged around 1610.\n\nHowever, not all Armstrong were evil raiders or cattle rustlers, and several made their way further south or became peaceful citizens as the years went by, many of them settling in England’s North East and North West as well as North Yorkshire.\n\nArmstrong families also emigrated – or were deported – all around the world, including descendants of the first man to walk on the moon, Neil Armstrong. His 5xgreat-grandfather, John Armstrong, made his way to Pennsylvania more than 300 years ago.\n\nASKEY\n\nHello playmates! Before your very eyes … let me explain the meaning of former radio and screen star Arthur Askey’s surname. Although Arthur was a Liverpudlian, it’s doubtful that his surname sprang from that area. There are a few theories as to the name’s origin, one being that a branch started when families took on their village name of Aiskew in the North Riding of Yorkshire. The place-name was written as Echescol, meaning ‘oak wood’, in the Domesday Book but over time, like the surname, the spelling has changed many times. Variations include Haskew, Ascough, Ayscough, Askie, Haskey, Askew and others.\n\nThere may have been other similarly-named places around the country, too. Aske, near Richmond, cannot be ruled out as a candidate either.\n\nAnother possibility regarding the name’s origin is that it is a shortened or Anglicised variation of the Gaelic name McAskey (McAskie, McCaskey and several other variations). It is believed that this name started in the Galloway region, it’s translation meaning ‘son of Ascaidh’, a former personal name. This derives from the Old Norse personal name ‘Asketill’, which means ‘ cauldron of the gods’ and has formed the basis of many other surnames such as McCaskill and Gaskill.\n\nThe 1881 England and Wales census recorded 706 people with the Askey surname. Today, although there are still many Askeys registered in the York region, the largest concentration can be found in the potteries region of the Midlands.\n\nI thank you (pronounced, of course, as “Ay-Thang-Yaw”).\n\nASQUITH\n\nHerbert Asquith was a proud Yorkshireman, born in Morley, who became the country’s prime minister from 1908 to 1916. And his unusual surname – only around 50 people in every million have it – is of good White Rose stock, too. Although the spelling has been changed down the years, his ancient forebears would have originally come from Askwith, near Otley. Although the name has now spread around the UK, the greatest concentration of the name is around the Wakefield area. Askwith means ‘ash wood’ in the Old Norse language.\n\nATHA/ATHEY\n\nAtha is now predominantly a Yorkshire name with the largest concentration in the 1881 census to be found in the Leeds postal area. By 2000 Harrogate became the top region for housing the Atha clan.\n\nThere are a few major theories about how the surname came about. One has it of Anglo-Saxon origin, an amalgamation of two Old English (pre-seventh century) words ‘aet’ which just means ‘at’ and ‘hey’, meaning enclosure — so the original bearer of the name would have been identified as ‘the person living at the enclosure’. There are several variant spellings of the name such as Athey – as the case with former Yorkshire cricketer Bill Athey – Atty and Athy.\n\nAnother possible origin is that Atha was once a personal name, probably Gaelic, which was often recorded in the Welsh border regions during the fourteenth century.\n\nSome experts claim that the names Athey and Athy are derived from the Irish native Gaelic ‘Atoi Sept’ who were one of the main medieval ’Tribes of Galway’. These families were mostly of Norman descent but became integrated into Gaelic society having settled in County Kildare from the mid 1300s. The town of Athy can be found there.\n\nWith such a wide range of spellings of the surname it is impossible to be more exact about its origin.\n\nAVEYARD\n\nIt is generally thought that Aveyard, a good Yorkshire surname, stems from a place-name probably a minor place somewhere in the county which may no longer exist. The name derives from the Old English, pre seventh-century personal name Afa plus geard, an enclosure. The surname appears in Mirfield parish records in the 1560s alongside another spelling: Aviard. Sometimes those writing the registers – and even the surname holders themselves – did not know correct spellings and also had trouble understanding local accents. There is even a theory that Aveyard could actually have been a variant of the old first name, Everard, which was used as a surname in Yorkshire as early as the 1300s. The Bradford postal district contains more Aveyards than any other place in the world.\n\nAYCKBOURN\n\nAlan Ayckbourn has been associated with Scarborough’s Stephen Joseph’s theatre for so long you’d be forgiven for thinking that he is Yorkshire born and bred. He was actually born in Hampstead, London, in 1939 and didn’t arrive on Yorkshire’s coast until the 1950s. His surname is interesting and rare.\n\nWay back in Alan’s family history the name was Eichbaum. In the late 1600s his ancestors were living in Westfalen, Germany. One of them moved across to Britain during the second half of the 18th century when the surname became more Anglicised – originally Ayckbowm and eventually Ayckbourn (with or without the c). The root of the name remains the same, however, and a German speaker would probably still recognise its original meaning: ‘oak tree’.\n\nThere are many examples of foreign surnames being translated into English versions, whether this be for personal reasons or just for ease of communication. At least one English person called Taylor has tracked his ancestors back to the continent to discover that an ancestor’s surname was Schneider – the German equivalent of Taylor.\n\nBAIRSTOW\n\nBairstow is a solid Yorkshire name and it’s good to know it is being continued in the county’s cricket team, with young Jonny Bairstow taking over the wicketkeeping mantle from his late father David. Bairstow – and many similar sounding surnames – started as a place-name and was taken up in the Middles Ages by the people who lived there. The Yorkshire version probably started from an ancient field name or farmstead around Beacon Hill, Shibden, near Halifax. One of the first written versions of the name appears in the Wakefield Court Rolls of 1277 with a mention of Ralph de Bayrestowe. The name means either ‘a place where berries grow’ or ‘a bare/barren place’. In the 1880s Halifax was the top area in the country for the surname but a hundred years later Bradford held the most Bairstows.\n\nBALMER\n\nThere could be several origins for the name Balmer with a general north-south split. Often, names ending -er indicate an occupation – such as carpenter or weaver. A balmer was once someone who used or sold aromatic ointments, usually for preserving, the name stemming from an Old French word ‘baulmier’. The term was probably brought over here by the Normans or early traders from the continent.\n\nIn the north, however, there are also several place-names which use the word ‘balm’ as this in Gaelic meant ‘town’ and even ‘cave’ – there’s a small place in the north-west called Balmire, for example – and several more in Scotland and Ireland. By the 1700s the surname was recorded in Cumberland and Lancashire, the Cleveland area of North Yorkshire, County Durham and also in the eastern Scottish borders and Ulster.\n\nToday In Great Britain it is estimated there are around 1,600 families with the surname Balmer and it is the 6,047th most common name. The biggest concentration is to be found in Surrey, where it was recorded in the 1400s, and there is also a place called Balmer in East Sussex.\n\nBANNISTER\n\nMany people presume the surname Bannister must derive from the word we have for that structure we use to help our creaking bodies up the stairs. But the surname has nothing to do with that – the word banister we use today wasn’t around before the seventeenth century.\n\n‘Banastre’ is in fact an Anglo-Norman term for a basket, and the original bearers of the name would have been basketmakers –&nbsp; a very popular occupation around the time when surnames first became necessary.\n\nIn the 1841 census around two-thirds – approximately 2,800 – of those registered with the surname Bannister (or similar) lived in Yorkshire. But it is a country-wide name and early written records can be found in the twelfth century in Cheshire, Lincolnshire and elsewhere.\n\nSir Adam Banastre was a landowner in the parish of Standish, over the border in Lancashire, who led a local uprising, known as Banastre’s rebellion, in 1315.&nbsp; It failed and Sir Adam lost his head. Bannisters were then to be found in Barnoldswick and east Lancashire, these probably being related to current landowners in the area with the surname.\n\nThe famous four-minute-miler Roger Bannister can trace his ancestry back to the Trawden area\n\nas can Billy Bannister a former Burnley footballer who also played for England at the turn of the twentieth century.\n\nBARKER\n\nThe surname Barker, you’ll not be surprised to learn, has nothing to do with dogs. A barker in medieval Britain was someone who used the bark of trees to tan leather. The occupational term barker was used more in the north, while down south tanner was more common, and even now the surname Tanner is found more around the Wiltshire, Oxfordshire and Gloucester areas than elsewhere. The highest concentration of Barkers can be found in North Yorkshire. Barker is said to be the 136th most common surname in Great Britain.\n\nBARLOW\n\nI was surprised to read about Take That singer/songwriter Gary Barlow being made ‘honorary Yorkshireman’. Surprised firstly because I didn’t know folk could be awarded such an honour, and secondly because Barlow is such a Lancastrian name.\n\nHowever, it’s a fact that there are many Barlows living in Yorkshire because the main origin of the name – a place called Barlow – is only just over the border. The first written recording of the surname is thought to be that of Thomas de Barlowe in the Lancashire assize records of 1260. The Barlows include an ancient knightly family of Barlow Hall, near Manchester, who trace their pedigree back to the reign of Edward I (1272-1307).\n\nToday Barlow is thought to be the 6,937th most common in the world with around 78,000 bearing the name and Bolton having the biggest concentration.\n\nThere is also a place in Derbyshire from where a branch of the surname sprung, and there is a glimmer of hope for Yorkshire Barlows. A place called Barlow, a small chapelry in the parish of Brayton, exists three miles from Selby. Back in 1379, a ‘Johannes de Berlowe’ from here appears in the Poll Tax Records of Yorkshire, so it is quite possible a White Rose branch sprung from his family.\n\nHis hamlet is recorded as ‘Berlai’ in the Domesday Book of 1086, and derives from the Olde English (pre seventh century) ‘bere’ meaning barley, plus ‘leag’, a clearing. Barlow in Lancashire, appears as ‘Berlawe’ in early manuscripts and stems from Olde English ‘bere’ and ‘hlaw’, a hill; hence, ‘barley hill’. The Derbyshire village was ‘Barleie’ in the Domesday Book, with ‘bar’, a boar, plus ‘leie’, a clearing in a wood.\n\nHad Gary Barlow been from the Yorkshire branch I wonder if he would have named the group ‘Teck That, Pal’?\n\nBAYLISS\n\nThe surname Bayliss (and variant spellings) isn’t too common in Yorkshire – the majority of the families are to be found in Worcestershire – but it was recorded in the county as far back as 1547. In the register of the freemen of York there’s a Thomas Baillis. The name derives from an ancient word baili – the old job title for someone who was a local official who perhaps worked for the county or court, similar to our modern bailiff.\n\nThere is also an old French word baillis which means the same and this could have led to the name being prevalent in the southern counties as the Normans spread their language northwards.\n\nThe name is particularly strong around the Welsh border as the baili would have worked for the English lords who had taken over Welsh territories in the Middle Ages.&nbsp; In those days, when surnames became more necessary many people took on the title of their job… such as John the Carter, David the Baker etc. It’s a good thing we don’t have to do that today… not sure what we’d call Bert the Sewage-worker.\n\nBELL\n\nNo doubt you’ll come across a few bells this Christmas – whether they be ringing out from your local church, appearing on a card, or being downed, as in a glass or two of the famous whisky of that name.\n\nYou’d think a simple four-letter surname like Bell, with its perfectly obvious link with those great big noisy things in the church tower, would be simple to explain.\n\nThink again, however, because one surname researcher has discovered sixty different spellings of the name – from Bel to Baloil plus several Gaelic variations – and there is a vast range of possible origins too.\n\nIt is generally thought that the surname originated in Scotland and northern England. In fact, the vast majority of people with surname can be found to the north of a line drawn from the mouth of the Mersey across to the Wash.\n\nSome experts believe the name could have started as a nickname from the Old French words beu or bel, meaning ‘handsome’. There was also, in medieval times, a personal name ‘Bel’ which was commonly used. Another possible origin is that the name was derived from the Middle English&nbsp; word ‘belle’, denoting either an occupation, a bell-ringer or&nbsp; bell-maker, or even a location, ie someone who lived by a bell tower.\n\nFor centuries the Bell clan from Scotland were unwelcome visitors to the border regions as they raided the northern English counties for anything they could lay their hands on. Eventually, many Bell families settled in Yorkshire, Northumberland, Durham and Cumberland – and hopefully they will remain peaceful over Christmas.\n\nBENDELOW\n\nMrs Ann Jones of Wisbech writes to ask if we know the origin of her maiden name, Bendelow. Well it’s certainly a Yorkshire name – back in the 1800s very few people bearing the name lived outside the county and even today the biggest concentration is around the Harrogate area.\n\nThe original bearers of the name would have come from a place called Bendelow – the literal translation meaning ‘the place of bent-grass’ (this is the name of a species of tough grass and doesn’t relate to the normal meaning of ‘bent’).\n\nThere could have once been a small settlement or field name so called in the area during medieval times but more glamorously it could stem from someone who moved over from the continent. There is a place called Benteloo (same meaning) in what is now The Netherlands – perhaps an early visitor or even a Viking invader came over and settled here, and his name became more ‘Anglified’ as the centuries went by?\n\nOther written versions of the name include Bendlowes, Bendlous and Bendlow. To show how surname spelling have altered, a Robert Bendelow was christened on June 20th 1817 at Well, in Yorkshire yet a previous recorded spelling of his family name is shown to be Bentlowe.\n\nBENNETT\n\nThere are several opinions about how the surname Bennett originated, with most experts believing it started out as a first name. A shortened form of Benedict seems to be the favourite option, but also, when the Normans crossed the Channel they brought with them first names such as Beneit and Benoit.\n\nBefore the thirteenth century, the baptismal name Benne also appeared in transcripts (nothing to do with the modern name Benjamin or the shortened form, Ben). It is thought that this led to the Benn surname. Benne started as a nickname for someone, and stems from an Old English word ‘beonna’, often given to describe a healthy baby: as my mother would have said, ‘she’s a bonny baby’, meaning she looked well-fed and thriving. A Ricardus Benne was recorded in 1379 Poll Tax of Yorkshire, as was a Joanna Benet.\n\nWhether Benn and Bennet share the same origin we’ll never know, but the latter name is more popular and is found all over the country. There are thought to be around 94,000 Bennets in the UK, with the most numerous living in the West Midlands.\n\nInterestingly, while Furness Abbey in Cumbria was held by the Benedictine Order, Bennet was one of the commonest of baptismal names in the surrounding district. Among the benefactors of the Abbey and Conishead Priory were Benet, son of William (1256) and Benet, son of Alan (1290). Bennet(t) and Benson remain popular surnames wherever there was once a Benedictine abbey.\n\nThere is another theory about the surname which suggests it could derive from another Old English word ‘beonet’. This was what we now know as ’bent-grass’, so the original owner of the name could have come from an area know for, or overgrown with, bent-grass.\n\nLeeds-born Alan Bennett is of good Yorkshire stock, being born in 1934 to Walter and Lilian Mary who were married in Bramley in 1928. Alan’s mother’s maiden name was Peel – another strong name from the county which will be covered in a future column.\n\nAnd we mustn’t forget the expression ‘Gordon Bennett’. It has been said that this person was the son of James Gordon Bennett, a Scottish immigrant to America who founded the New York Herald newspaper. Gordon inherited the paper and wealth, and was known for his extravagant and shocking lifestyle. The term ‘Gordon Bennett’ is said to allude to his wild ways, and perhaps originated as a euphemism for ‘gorblimey’ (although there are other theories on the expression’s origin).\n\nBIBBY\n\nIf you live towards the west of the county you’ll recognise the unusual surname Bibby from the many coaches which run around the Yorkshire-Lancashire border bearing the name.\n\nThe Bibby family who run the business have lived and traded from Ingleton for more than a hundred years but the surname in the two counties goes back beyond the 1300s.\n\nSurname experts have come up with three possible explanations for the origin of the name, the most popular being that Bibby (or similar spellings) was a shortened form – a pet name – of Isabel. Today we might shorten the name to Izzie but in medieval times they plumped for Bibb and Bibbi.\n\nAnother possibility is that there is some Viking influence afoot, as Bebbe is also an ancient Scandinavian forename. Looking at the distribution of the surname down the UK’s north-western coast suggests this branch of the surname started after the invasion by Norsemen over a thousand years ago.\n\nA important family named Bibby, who were big landowners during the fourteenth century at Ribchester, just over the Lancashire border, is descended from a Richard Bibby. He lived in the late 1200s and records show he was the son of a woman called Bibbi.\n\nThe third theory, and probably unrelated to the Bibbys mentioned above, is that the surname derives from a village near Leicester now called Beeby.\n\nOther early recordings of the name include Robert Bybby in the city rolls of Wakefield in 1284, and Henricus Bibbe in the 1397 Poll Tax rolls of Yorkshire. Census figures show there are just under\n\nBIRD\n\nThink of the surname Bird and Yorkshire’s famous cricketing son, Dickie, immediately springs to mind. And although there’s a fair old sprinkling of people with the surname in the county – and it was recorded in the Pipe Rolls of Yorkshire as far back as 1193 – it is now essentially a name based in the Midlands and East Anglia.\n\nIt was originally given as as a nickname to one thought to bear a resemblance to a bird. This may have been from bright dress, or bright eyed and active, or perhaps to some one with a beautiful singing voice. Sometimes the surname Bird may have been given as an occupational name to a bird catcher, and as such was a shortened form of the name Birdclever, recorded in the 1427 Calverley Charters of Yorkshire.\n\nBLACK\n\nCalling people names because of the way they look could get you in trouble today, but some 700-800 years ago it was considered normal. In villages where there might have been dozens of people called John, they would have been distinguished one from another by describing their looks — perhaps John White, Grey or Brown etc, and these eventually became their surnames.\n\nSometimes the name might relate to a person’s complexion or the colour of their hair. It is even known to have been related to the dominant colour of the clothes a person was associated with.\n\nBlunt is another descriptive surname but not as we understand the word to mean today, for ‘blunt’ is an old Anglo-Norman French word meaning blonde.\n\nDon’t worry if your name is Green — your ancestors didn’t have oddly shaded skin or hair – they were probably so called because they lived near the village green. The surname Black is even more misleading as it is not possible to say from which Old English word the name is derived… ‘blaec’ or ‘blac’. The former meant the dark colour; the latter meant almost the opposite: ‘pale’ (think of our current word ‘bleak’).\n\nThankfully, there weren’t that many words around to describe colours back in the thirteenth century, therefore we don’t have people called ‘muted mocha’, ‘fresh mountain dew’ or ‘urban obsession’ — just three modern colours to be found at the DIY store.\n\nBLENKINSOP\n\nRecorded as Blenkinsop, Blenkinsopp, and Blenkinship, this is an English surname. It is locational from Blenkinsopp, a village in the county of Northumberland. The meaning is obscure, although it is thought to mean Blenkyn’s hill, from an early personal name and “copp”, a hill top. Locational surnames are nearly always “from” names. That is to say names given to people after they left their original village to move somewhere else. In so doing they took, or were given, as their surname the name of their original village. Spelling over the centuries being at best erratic and local dialects very thick, often lead to the creation of “sounds like” spellings. This surname however has largely retained its original spelling, perhaps because it was so unique in its form. The early recordings taken from surviving church registers include Thomas Blenkinsop, christened at the church of St. John’s Deansgate, Manchester, on June 16th 1700, and Thomas Blenkinship who married Isabella Ostel at Manchester Cathedral on December 6th 1873. The first recorded spelling of the family name is shown to be that of John Blenkinsopp. He is given as being a Freeman of the city of York, in 1553.\n\nBOOCOCK\n\nIf you’re hoping for a definitive explanation for this surname then I’m afraid you may be disappointed. What I can tell you with certainty is that you have northern ancestors dating back hundreds of years. Surname experts have debated long and hard about the origin of the name but there has been little agreement and much guesswork.\n\nWhat they can confirm is that at one point it was only found in the Pennine area between Lancashire and Yorkshire.\n\nLet’s look at the ending first … ‘cock’ derives from the pre seventh-century word ‘cocca’, a nickname usually applied to a young lad. For example, Hancock translates as ‘John’s young lad’ (son), and Hitchcock means son of Richard. So perhaps Boocock was once ‘Bawcock’, meaning Baldwin’s youngster.\n\nAnother expert says there was an old Norse first name Bui, leading to the theory that his son could have been Bui-cock. Elsewhere we read that Boocock stems from a nickname given to ’a proud or gawdy person’ – as with a peacock.\n\nThen there is the surname Bowker, an occupational name which means a butcher or slaughterer – could Boocock mean ‘the butcher’s young lad’?\n\nThe earliest written evidence of Boocock doesn’t appear until the early 1600s (one example is in Rothwell parish, near Leeds) which suggests that it was spelled differently in the preceding centuries.\n\nOne study of a family living in Bowland on the Yorkshire-Lancashire border shows spellings in local parish registers varying from Bulcock through Bowcock to Boocock. Way back in the Hundred Rolls of Yorkshire, written in 1276, appears a Geoffrey Balcok whose surname could also have altered down the years. One thing is for sure, that particular Mr Balcok definitely didn’t have anything to do with plumbing.\n\nBOLINGBROKE/ BOLLING\n\nDown Your Way reader Dorothy Holmes, of Sutton-in-Craven, has a new name in her family tree following the marriage of a granddaughter to a Bolinbroke. She wonders if through this famous ancient name her line could now be linked to Henry Bolingbroke (King Henry IV) who laid claim to the English crown in 1399. Without serious genealogical research it is not possible to confirm or deny a relationship to the king who reigned until 1413. Henry was born in Bolinbroke in 1367, but then again so were many more people who spread far and wide in search of work. Today there are two places with the name – in Lincolnshire and Surrey, the former being the most likely source of the surname.\n\nSome experts say the place-name means ‘the fen (broc) of the Bulla people’, an Old English tribe who probably flourished during the Dark Ages.\n\nThere’s no significant evidence of bearers of the surname settling in Yorkshire, with the biggest concentration today being in Norfolk. However, the Bolling surname is much more prevalent in the White Rose county than anywhere else.\n\nThere’s a great deal of speculation about the origin of the Bolling name, including that it was a nickname for someone with close-cropped hair or a large head, from the Middle English word bolling, meaning pollard. Also, in medieval England a heavy drinker was often called a bolling. There are several other possibilities, including that Bolling may be a corruption of Bowling, the place-name in Bradford where there is Bolling Hall. The Manor of Bolling (Bollinc) is mentioned in Domesday Book. By 1316 it was owned by William Bolling, and his family owned the estate until the late fifteenth century.\n\nBOOTH\n\nBooth is a northern name with the biggest concentration of those with the name being in the Huddersfield area. It was originally given as a name for someone who lived in a small hut or bothy – especially temporary accommodation such as that used by a cowman or shepherd. It stems from the Middle English word both(e) but the word is of Scandinavian origin which is why it is more common in northern England.\n\nBOYCOTT\n\nThat famous cricketing son of Yorkshire, (Sir) Geoffrey Boycott, was born in the mining village of Fitzwilliam, near Wakefield, the eldest of three sons of Jane and Thomas Wilfred Boycott. But the father of the county’s celebrated batsman – and his surname – are both from Shropshire. Thomas Wilfred was a Shropshire colliery worker who sought work in the Yorkshire coalfield, while the name stems from a place in the county that originally meant ‘Boia’s cot’ – the place of ‘Boia’ (a seventh-century term of endearment for a young man).\n\nThere is also a place called Boycott (sometimes recorded as Boycote) in Berkshire but the largest concentration of the surname has centred around Telford in Shropshire, with a growing population in the Wakefield area.\n\nHowever, if you were starting to worry about Geoffrey’s Yorkshireness you need not fear, as his mother was of sound Yorkshire stock. Her maiden name was Speight – a surname rarely found outside the boundary of Broad Acres.\n\nIts origins lie with the Old English and Saxon word ‘Speoht’ an ancient name for a woodpecker – even today the German and Dutch word for woodpecker is ‘specht’. Originally it would have been given as a nickname to someone whose personal characteristics, or even the way they dressed,&nbsp; were believed to match the animal or bird or even fish in question. In this case it could also have been given to a great chatterer, or one who talked a great deal… (especially when asked for an opinion on cricket?)\n\nEarly recordings of the name include John Speght of Wakefield in 1313 and Matilda Speght listed in the Yorkshire Poll Tax of 1379.\n\nPerhaps even more famous than Yorkshire’s own bearer of the name is Captain Charles Boycott (1832-1897). While acting as land agent to the earl of Erne in County Mayo, he was ‘socially excommunicated’ for his refusal to bow to the growing power of the Land League in Ireland. As a result his name became the verb we use today – ‘to boycott’.\n\nBRADDY/BRADY/BRODIE\n\nIf you know someone called Brady, Brodie or Braddy – or one of many other spellings of the name – you can say that one of their ancestors was thieving and dishonest without fear of being sued … but trying this is not recommended.\n\nThere are several theories surrounding the name’s origin, one being that it stems from the Irish term ‘brádach’, meaning thieving or dishonest, though in the family’s defence its original sense could also have denoted ‘spirited’. The Brady bunch were a powerful clan in Ireland, their chief holding control over a large territory lying to the east of Cavan from pre thirteenth century. In Scotland Brady families migrated to Lanarkshire and Angus. In England most ended up in Lancashire, Durham and Yorkshire.\n\nAnother, less likely origin for the name suggests it being a nickname given to a person with excellent eyesight. This is reckoned to come from the pre seventh-century term ‘brad-eage’, meaning broad eye.\n\nAnother idea is that it derives from a lost place known as ‘Broad isle’, while a fourth theory suggests it may be topographical for a dweller by woodland cleared for agriculture from the ancient term ‘brad gehaeg’. With Irish accents and language being difficult for many early scribes to translate, and with several different possible name origins, it is no wonder we encounter so many different spellings today.\n\nIn the 1841 census for England, there were around 18,000 people registered with the Brady/Brodie/Braddy spellings but only around a dozen with the Braddy spelling.\n\nBRISTOW\n\nA reader asks about the name Bristow – but this alas is unlikely to have originated in Yorkshire. It’s more likely the first bearers of the name travelled from what we now know as Bristol but which was once ‘Brycgstow’ – meaning a place of assembly by the bridge. Most early migrants from Bristol headed east for work in London. But at least one strand saw sense and headed for Yorkshire instead.\n\nBRONTE\n\nThere’s been much speculation over the surname Brontë. But there’s no doubt it started with Patrick Brunty, the Irish-born father of the famous Yorkshire novelists. Patrick was a Brunty until he entered St John’s College, Cambridge in 1802. Whether he took on the revised surname because the registrar couldn’t understand his thick Irish accent or whether he fancied something a little more impressive is not clear. He would have been aware of a mythological Greek god Bronte, meaning ‘thunder’, and also of the fact that Lord Nelson had been made Duke of Bronte in Sicily in 1799.\n\nThe later addition of an accent on the e is even more baffling, as this has also been recorded over the years as a macron, a tilde and an umlaut. Perhaps this addition was initially either another flight of fancy by Patrick or a hint to others as to how he wanted the surname pronounced.\n\nWhat is certain, however, is that his original surname of Brunty (also recorded as Prunty) is an anglicised version of the Gaelic given name Proinntigh.\n\nBROOKSBANK\n\nBrooksbank is an ancient Yorkshire name and a prime example of how surnames developed in the fourteenth century. It is recorded that back in 1371 a chap called Thomas Bythebrokesbank of Warley was paid to help with the rebuilding work at Erringden Park, near Halifax. In the Poll Tax Records of 1377 he was down as Thomas By-the-brokes-bancke of Elland, but just two years later the same man was recorded as Thomas de Brokesbank when employed to supervise the removal of Warley corn mill and rebuild it at Luddenden. In the next Poll Tax he was registered as Thomas Brokesbank.\n\nOver the centuries the family, besides taking on the more modern spelling of ‘brook’, spread throughout Calderdale and into Airedale (where they also became connected with my family). There is also a branch further east with the Brooksbank Baronetcy of Helaugh Manor in honour of Edward Brooksbank, a former Deputy Lieutenant for the West Riding. The family has royal connections – Jack Christopher Stamp Brooksbank (b1986), was reported last year as being engaged to Princess Eugenie, the Queen’s granddaughter. The pair are actually distantly related as Eugenie’s mother, Sarah, Duchess of York, is the great-great-granddaughter of Lady Julia Coke, the daughter of Jack’s great-great-grandfather Thomas Coke, 2nd Earl of Leicester (are you still with me?).\n\nBrooksbank school in Elland was founded by one of the clan 300 years ago. Joseph Brooksbank grew up in Elland but left to find his fortune in London and establish the family among the country’s aristocracy. One of his offspring, Stamp Brooksbank (1694–1756) was Governor of the Bank of England 1741-43 and represented Colchester as an MP. He was the one who acquired Healaugh Manor.\n\nSir Gilbert Brooksbank was a priest stemming from those early Warley families who lived at Bank House. He was murdered in a skirmish with Sir Richard Tempest’s men in 1536, and another member was killed in a duel.\n\nToday, they have calmed down a little, and the less affluent Brooksbanks are mainly concentrated around the BD postcode area.\n\nBROWN\n\nCalling people names because of the way they look could get you in trouble today, but some 700-800 years ago it was considered normal. In villages where there might have been dozens of people called John, they would have been distinguished one from another by describing their looks — perhaps John White, Grey or Brown etc, and these eventually became their surnames.\n\nSometimes the name might relate to a person’s complexion or the colour of their hair. It is even known to have been related to the dominant colour of the clothes a person was associated with.\n\nBlunt is another descriptive surname but not as we understand the word to mean today, for ‘blunt’ is an old Anglo-Norman French word meaning blonde.\n\nDon’t worry if your name is Green — your ancestors didn’t have oddly shaded skin or hair – they were probably so called because they lived near the village green. The surname Black is even more misleading as it is not possible to say from which Old English word the name is derived… ‘blaec’ or ‘blac’. The former meant the dark colour; the latter meant almost the opposite: ‘pale’ (think of our current word ‘bleak’).\n\nThankfully, there weren’t that many words around to describe colours back in the thirteenth century, therefore we don’t have people called ‘muted mocha’, ‘fresh mountain dew’ or ‘urban obsession’ — just three modern colours to be found at the DIY store.\n\nBUTTERFIELD\n\nWhat better name for a summer month than Butterfield. Back in the Middle Ages when surnames were becoming more necessary, some lucky person was living near a ’butere feld’ – ancient words which translate as ‘the open space where cows who give butter graze’.\n\nIt is thought that there was once a small hamlet or farmstead called Butterfield, some say it was around the Todmorden area near the Yorkshire-Lancashire border. There will have been others around the country, but Yorkshire was, and still is, where we find the largest concentration of folk with the surname.\n\nRobert de Butterfeld is recorded in the 1379 poll tax rolls for Slaidburn. His descendants spread around that area, especially to Keighley, Craven and Airedale where large branches of the family developed. Many Butterfields from that region are noted as fighting in the battle between the English and Scots at Flodden Field in 1513.\n\nBorn in Keighley on 20th February in 1781, was Isaac Butterfield, who at the age of just twenty months was three feet tall, and weighed nearly eight stone. He was exhibited as ‘a gigantic child’ in London, where he died just before his second birthday.\n\nButterfields from the Keighley line became successful mill owners. In the early 1800s they lived at Cliffe Castle in the town. Henry Isaac Butterfield restyled the castle in the 1870s and his son Frederick made it his permanent home.\n\nAnother famous Butterfield was Frederick from Harrogate who in 1973 at the age of 109 was declared at the time as being the world’s oldest man.\n\nAccording to the 1891 Census, there were 2,258 Butterfield families living in Yorkshire. This was about 54 per cent of all the recorded Butterfields in the UK. In the 1881 Census Keighley registered 240 Butterfields, Leeds 150, Horton (Bradford) 128 and Shipley 79.Today there are strong Butterfield lines in America and Australia, stemming from early emigrants (and convicts).\n\nCAPSTICK\n\nThe 1841 census records fewer than a hundred families with the surname Capstick, most of them being found in north-west Yorkshire, eastern parts of Lancashire and the south-west of Westmorland. There were a few others spread around the country and several with slightly different spellings of the name, such as Copestake, Copestick and Capstack – the variations stemming from regional accents and the way early scribes wrote the name in official documents.\n\nThe name is derived from a French word ‘coupe’ meaning ‘cut’ and an Old English word ‘sticca’, meaning stake. So the original bearer of the surname would have been a stake or stick cutter by trade. The popular name Cooper comes from the same French word and was given to someone who cut or shaped wood, such as a barrel maker.\n\nThe first recorded spelling of the surname is thought to be that of Geoffrey Coupstak, dated 1295 in the Register of the Freemen of the city of York. One Henry Coupestack was recorded in the Subsidy Rolls of Yorkshire (1301), and John Copestake (1474) in the Register of the Freemen of the city of York.\n\nThe majority of today’s Capsticks can still be found across the northern belt of Yorkshire and Lancashire but the surname has spread around the world, especially in America where several Capstick families in the nineteenth century left Liverpool in search of a better way of life on the other side of the Atlantic.\n\nCLEGG\n\nFoggy, Compo and Clegg… names of Last of the Summer Wine TV characters now written into Holmfirth folklore, but just where does the name Clegg come from? Clegg is actually a place-name called after an Old Norse word, kleggi, meaning haystack. There may originally have been more than one place with the name but the most likely location is in east Lancashire. Many early Cleggs soon saw the light and moved into Yorkshire and are recorded here as early as the 14th century. Clegg emerged as an influential family in Lancashire, flourishing from their original family seat at Clegg Hall, just outside what is now Rochdale. Nowadays the biggest concentration of Cleggs is to be found around the old Yorkshire/Lancashire border at Oldham… just a few miles from Holmfirth.\n\nCLOUGH\n\n‘Cloh’ is an Old English word – used mainly prior to the seventh century – for a narrow ravine or valley, usually having steep sides and forming the bed of a stream. It gave rise to many a place-name and later surnames, the main one being Clough which would have originally been given to someone who lived near a ‘cloh’.\n\nOne of the most common and once uniquely Yorkshire surnames using the word is Barraclough (and variants such as Barrowclough and Barrowcliffe). At one time almost all those called Barraclough lived in the Halifax area but the clan has spread all around the world, with one branch being early settlers in America.\n\nThe first recorded written spelling of the family name is shown to be that of Peter del Baricloughe, which was dated 1315 in the Court Rolls of the Manor of Wakefield.\n\nIt is thought the original site for the place Barrowclough was near Shibden where you can still find Barrowclough Lane. The first section of the name probably stems from another Old English word ‘bearu’ which means a small wood or grove in today’s language.\n\nThe Pennine landscape features numerous ‘clohs’ and that is why there are more families called Clough, Barraclough and Fairclough to be found either side of the Pennine chain than anywhere else in the country.\n\nCORBETT\n\nWhile the Barker half of the Two Ronnies duo seems to have come from humble origins (see above), the same cannot be said for the Corbett half. Shropshire has been the principal home for the Corbett clan – a common name there since the thirteenth century. According to Debrett’s, one ‘Corbet’ was a noble Norman who arrived on our shores with William the Conqueror. The family went on to hold lands in Scotland too, where the surname is still popular. Corbet, from which the surname is derived, is a French word for a little raven or crow. The first bearer of the name may have resembled the bird either through his ferocity or his looks.\n\nCRAVEN\n\nCraven is very much a Yorkshire name, given to people who originally came from the district of that name around Skipton and the southern edge of the Dales. The area was called ‘Crave’ as far back as the Domesday book in 1086. There’s been some doubt about the exact meaning of the name but most scholars think it comes from an old word ‘craf’ which means garlic. There has always been a profusion of wild garlic, of the allium family, growing in the region and the pungent smell in late spring and early summer would certainly have made an impression on early visitors.\n\nThe first recorded spelling of the family name is probably that of Paulinus de Cravene in 1284, recorded as a Freeman of Yorkshire, during the reign of King Edward I. It was also noted in the latter half of the thirteenth century when Agnes de Craven and Johannes de Craven, appear in the Poll Tax Returns of Yorkshire (1372).\n\nThe Cravens moved in search of work into the more populated and industrialised areas as the centuries went by and now the majority can be found in the Bradford and Leeds areas.\n\nCRAZY\n\nThere are some Crazy surnames. Before our erudite editor removes the capital C from the last sentence let me explain that I do mean Crazy the surname. It is estimated that approxiamately 3,200 Britons who share the name and that around five per cent of them live in the Leeds area.\n\nI checked in the 1911 census to see if I could find a Crazy family living in Yorkshire and sure enough there is a Jonathan Edward Crazy aged 41 living with his wife and three children in Gilling West, just a few miles north of Richmond. Whether this was a mispelling by the recorder or the family’s proper name I can’t tell.\n\nThere will be some people who have changed their surname by deed poll to Crazy but for most it will probably be a corruption of the more common name Creasey (found mainly in Suffolk). Down the years the name has been written in several forms including&nbsp; Crasey, Creissi, Cressy and Creci(y). It is thought the original bearers may have come from Crecy in Seine-Inferieure, France, which was a famous battle ground during the Hundred Years War.\n\nThere is also an Old English word, creas, which means elegant, and some believe the name could have been given originally as a nickname to someone who dressed in a fine and elegant manner.\n\nCROSBY\n\nThis festive period, while you are listening endlessly to Bing Crosby Dreaming of his white Christmas you might like to contemplate the fact that the crooner’s Crosby ancestors came from Yorkshire. The Crosby surname is more popular in Yorkshire than in any other county, with the biggest concentration today living around the York region.\n\nBing – real name Harry Lillis Crosby – lived from 1903 to 1977 but his ancestors were one of the earliest settlers in New England, sailing there in the Susan &amp; Ellen in 1635. The Rev Simon Crosby, his wife Ann and eight-week-old son Thomas made that tortuous journey which started from his place of birth, Holme-on-Spalding-Moor in the East Riding.\n\nThey were a local Puritan family, and American genealogists, perhaps keen to attach some romance to their hero, claim Bing’s line stretches back from those Yorkshire roots through sheriffs of London and on to early landowning Danish officers who came over with the Norsemen a thousand years ago.\n\nI’m not saying they are wrong – I haven’t seen their evidence – but they do seem to be assuming that the original Crosby family originated from the best-known town called Crosby on the west coast near Merseyside.\n\nThe place-name Crosby is certainly a Norse name, meaning ‘settlement at the cross’, but there are a lot more places bearing that name around the our country – including, perhaps most importantly in this case, one close to Rievaulx Abbey, near Helmsley. Today it is classed as a grange of the abbey but back in the time when surnames were being deemed necessary life there would have been very different.\n\nPerhaps Bing was dreaming of a white rose Christmas?\n\nCROWTHER\n\nWhen a surname ends in -er it usually means that the original bearer of the name carried out an important occupation in the local community. Obvious examples are Baker, Butcher and Carpenter etc. Back in medieval times when surnames started to become more necessary, musicians and entertainers were valued members of towns and villages, giving rise to many surnames such as Fidler, Piper, Harper – and Crowther.\n\nThe latter is generally considered to be a Yorkshire surname deeply rooted in the Huddersfield and Halifax areas. Around the country are several variations of the name, such as Crewther, Crother and Crowder which all give us a clue as to its original meaning. A ‘crowde’ or ‘croude’ is an old instrument played with a bow, similar to a fiddle, and modern equivalents are still often used in Celtic-style music. In our ancient language, similar to today’s Welsh, it would have been called a ‘crwth’, pronounced ‘krooth’.\n\nMedieval musicians didn’t just exist to entertain the wealthy at lavish parties in great halls. They also toured the country with travelling fairs, and in some towns musicians called ‘Waits’ were employed as watchmen (this occupation gave us the surname Waite). They alerted the townsfolk to danger by playing loud instruments, and they also performed at civic ceremonies.\n\nIn the 1379 Poll Tax Returns for Yorkshire there is recorded a Katerina Crowder. The top postal town for Crowthers is reckoned to be Halifax, and it is estimated there are around 16.500 Crowther adults in the whole country.\n\nDARNTON\n\nDarnton is a rare surname which has had researchers scratching their heads for a long time. It is definitely a name stemming from the north-east of Yorkshire which has led some to believe that at some point during early recording of surnames it may have been a shortened form of ‘Darlington’. One expert has also suggested Darnton is a shortened version of Darrington, another Yorkshire town. There could quite well have been a medieval scribe who on asking a local person where he came from, assumed the person as saying ‘Dar’n’ton’.\n\nIt may sound incredible nowadays but you have to remember that very few people could read or write several hundred years ago when surnames began, and scribes had great difficulty understanding local accents.\n\nOr there could once have been a small hamlet or farmstead called Darnton, and today there are several place-names – and even a river – stemming from the Old English word ‘dearne’, which means ‘water’. So originally a place called ‘dearne-tun’ would have meant ‘settlement by the water’. The area showing the largest number of written records since 1450 is Staindrop just north of Darlington north of the A66.\n\nJohn Darnton was the thirtieth abbot of Fountains Abbey (1478-95) and was responsible for much work including the West Window, over which is a stone corbel carved as a representation (called a rebus) of the man himself. The rebus is now very badly corroded but is supposed to show a bird (a dern) holding a barrel (a ton).\n\nDEIGHTON\n\nThere’s nothing gives away your Yorkshire roots more than having a surname which derives from a placename within the county. Two readers have written in asking about their family names of Learoyd and Deighton. The latter is a more common surname, perhaps because there are at least&nbsp; three places called Deighton in Yorkshire… near Huddersfield, Northallerton and York. They all got their names from old words ‘dic’ and ‘tun’ which basically means a settlement near, or surrounded by, a ditch or dyke. Nowadays the surname is most popular around the Harrogate to York region.\n\nUnlike Deighton, the place called Learoyd never developed into a modern-day settlement. It was probably originally just a farmstead or tiny settlement where habitation faded out or it changed name. It is very likely this place was around the Calder Valley area. In Old English, spoken before the seventh century, ‘leah’ meant wood and ‘rod’ meant clearing. Probably the first written record of the name is to be found in the Poll Tax returns for the West Riding of 1379 when Alicia Legh-rode was required to hand over money to the King. The biggest concentration of the name nowadays is around Huddersfield.\n\nDENIAL\n\nThe interesting surname Denial is not directly to do with the word we use today but derives ultimately from the Hebrew male personal name Daniel, which means ‘God is my judge’, and was borne by one of the most important prophets in the Bible. Daniel does not appear in England before the Conquest of 1066, suggesting that it was introduced by the Normans as both a given and a surname. The Denial strand may have started somewhere in the Sheffield area as by 1881 that is where the main concentration of Denials were to be found in the country. It is thought that only around three people in a million are named Denial in the UK.\n\nDEWHIRST/DEWHURST\n\nSurnames don’t come much more ‘northern’ than Dewhirst/Dewhurst. A quick scan through the 1841 census returns shows that 3,346 people were registered with one version or other of the name. Of those, just 714 had the ‘i’ spelling – most of these living in Yorkshire. Only a handful of the total can be found outside the white or red rose regions.\n\nDewhirst was originally a place-name, probably derived from the adjective ‘dewy’ plus the Middle English word ‘hyrst’, meaning wooded hill. Fourteenth-century records indicate that this place was in an area about six miles north of Blackburn, on the river Ribble close to the ancient boundary with Yorkshire. Other name experts claim that the ‘dew’ part might stem from the male given name ‘Dewey’ or ‘Dewie’ which are old forms of David.\n\nMany small settlements, especially in Pennine areas, disappeared when landowners made way for sheep pastures at the height of the wool trade from the fifteenth century onwards. Natural causes such as the Black Death of 1348, in which an eighth of the country’s population perished, also destroyed many communities.\n\nEarly records of the name are shown to be that of Adam del Dewyhirst, which was dated 1332 in the Lay Subsidy Rolls of Lancashire, and Roger de le Dewyhurst in the Coucher Book of Whalley Abbey (a register of charters, title deeds etc) written around 1300.\n\nDEWHIRST, CLEGG, SIMMONITE\n\nIf I ever the get the chance, I’d like to ask Last of the Summer Wine writer Roy Clarke what made him choose the surnames for his main characters, Foggy, Compo and Clegg. The trio were designated the surnames Dewhirst, Simmonite and Clegg, and I guess Roy saw them as suitably appropriate for the north of England.\n\nSurnames don’t come much more ‘northern’ than Dewhirst/Dewhurst. A quick scan through the 1841 census returns shows that 3,346 people were registered with one version or other of the name. Dewhirst was originally a place-name, probably derived from the adjective ‘dewy’ plus the Middle English word ‘hyrst’, meaning wooded hill. Fourteenth-century records indicate that this place was in an area about six miles north of Blackburn, on the river Ribble close to the ancient boundary with Yorkshire. Other name experts say the ‘dew’ part might stem from the male given name ‘Dewey’ or ‘Dewie’ which are old forms of David.\n\nMany small settlements, especially in Pennine areas, disappeared when landowners made way for sheep pastures at the height of the wool trade from the fifteenth century onwards. Natural causes such as the Black Death of 1348, in which an eighth of the country’s population perished, also destroyed many communities.\n\nClegg is also a place from where the first bearers of the name would have originated. It was named after an Old Norse word, kleggi, meaning haystack, a description given by locals for the shape of a nearby hill. There may have been more than one place so called, but the most likely location is again in east Lancashire. Many early Cleggs soon saw the light and moved into Yorkshire, and are recorded in the White Rose county as early as the fourteenth century. Nowadays, the biggest concentration of Cleggs is still to be found around the old Yorkshire/Lancashire border… just a few miles from Holmfirth, the ‘home’ of Last of the Summer Wine.\n\nCompo’s fictitious Simmonite surname derives from the name of an ancestor, literally meaning ‘the son of Simon’. It’s not a common name, with only around one out of 100,000 people in the country bearing it, but once again Roy Clarke did his homework for the surname is most prevalent in South Yorkshire, where 47 per cent of Simmonites are found, and in West Yorkshire, where there’s around seven percent.\n\nSo, full marks to Roy. And as for Nora Battye… I’ll save her for another day.\n\nDEXTER\n\nTheories abound regarding the origins of the surname Dexter. It’s certainly been around a long time — right back to the days when surnames began to become more commonplace in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. Some Victorian name experts believed the name to be a contraction of ‘de Exeter’; others put forward the idea that the name is derived from&nbsp; a Latin word dexter, in the sense of being lucky or fortunate.\n\nThis most likely source, however, is an Anglo-Saxon word, ‘dighester’. This was once an occupational name for a female dyer of cloth.\n\nThe name is most popular in the Midlands and early examples include John and Ralf Dextere in the Friary Rolls of Leicester in 1262, Robert le Digester in the Subsidy Rolls of Worcestershire in 1275, Walter Le Dighestre of Sussex in the same year, Simon Le Dykestre of Suffolk in 1305, and Thomas Dyster in the London Rolls of the Inquisition of 1290. However, the first recorded spelling of the family name is thought to be that of Robert le Dighestre, dated 1260, in the Somerset County Registers.\n\nDINSDALE\n\nThere are a whole host of surnames containing the word ‘dale’ – even more if we include different spellings such as those ending with -dall and others. Broadly speaking, we can assume that someone bearing a name which includes dale has ancestors who came from a place which either has dale in its name, or is a description of an area.\n\nAnglo-Saxons, who spoke Old English (5th to 11th century), used the word ‘dael’, while the Vikings, who spoke Old Norse (9th to 11th century), used ‘dalr’ – both words mean ‘valley’.\n\nThere are hundreds of of places-names in the country which include dale, plus many others which no longer exist or have changed names, so pin-pointing where your actual valley or village can be difficult.\n\nA long-standing ‘dale’ name is Dinsdale which we find mainly in the north of England. I hesitate in calling it a Yorkshire name because those who know the place called Dinsdale will tell you that it straddles the river Tees, the traditional boundary between Yorkshire and Durham.\n\nOriginally there was only one village named Dinsdale but now there are two – Low Dinsdale (on the ‘wrong’ bank of the Tees) and Over Dinsdale which is situated on a peninsula of land on the Yorkshire side.\n\nTo throw a spanner into the theory that surnames which include dale has something to do with a valley, Dinsdale was recorded in Domesday Book (1086) as Dignesale and Dirneshale, and a few years later it was written as Detnisale. The ending of the name in this case belongs to an Anglo-Saxon word ‘halh’ which means ’nook of flat land (in this case belonging to a chap or a manor called Deighton). At some point over the following centuries the place-name drifted into Dinsdale.\n\nThe 1841 Census for England & Wales records 1,059 people called Dinsdale, with around 700 of them being born in Yorkshire, so it seems most early Dinsdales headed to the land of milk and honey we know as Yorkshire.\n\nDRAKE\n\nA primary-school pal of mine was called Walter Raleigh, and later in life I befriended a Francis Drake. I’ve yet to meet a Christopher Columbus but I’m sure there’s one out there somewhere. Many of today’s Raleighs and Drakes – both fairly common names in the West Riding – will wonder whether they are related to the famous adventurers. Without detailed individual research it is impossible to confirm or deny but links are possible in both cases.\n\nDrake, which probably derives from a nickname, possibly from dragon or the male duck, was quite widespread from the twelfth century with concentrations in Devon, Dorset, Norfolk and the West Riding by the sixteenth century.\n\nWilliam Drake of Shibden, near Halifax, is mentioned in 1275 documents and a Drake family was in possession of Horley Green, Northowram, from the thirteenth to the nineteenth century. These Drakes were said to have come from Devon, birthplace of the famous Sir Francis Drake (1540-1596).\n\nBy the mid 1800s Drakes were to be found mainly in the Northowram area, Thornton, near Bradford, as well as in Huddersfield, Leeds and Sheffield.\n\nThe Raleighs are also an ancient Devon family, with the name probably stemming from a place-name in that area. There’s also always been a strong concentration of Raleighs in Yorkshire, especially in the Wakefield and Hull areas, so there may well have been a place in the county similarly named. Rawley, Rayleigh and Rawleigh are all variants. There is also a suggestion by experts that the name stems from an Irish given name (as in O’Riley). It is easy to imagine that an early scribe could translate Riley as Raleigh when listening to anyone with a thick Irish accent.\n\nColumbus? Of the three bearers of the surname recorded in England in the 1881 British census one was born in Italy, one in Ireland, and one in Russia.\n\nDRINKALL\n\nThere is a group of surnames that started out as nicknames. On many occasions the nickname was given to reflect a person’s appearance but others came about because of a person’s profession or habits.\n\nSome surname experts attribute Drinkall to the phrase ‘drinc hail’ – today’s equivalent would be raising a glass and saying ‘good health’, so perhaps the name was given to someone who said the phrase a lot. Others believe the name was given to someone employed to drink ale. In the 1362 Court Rolls for Bradford is recorded a William Drynkale who was described as being the ale taster for the manor. On the face of it, that sounds like my kind of job but unfortunately, back in the 1300s when beer was often considered safer to drink than water, testing for dodgy beer might not have been the healthiest employment. Being an ale taster was important in medieval times – in fact, many towns employed ale tasters right up to the nineteenth century. Duties involved visiting stalls on market days and during the town’s fairs to ensure that the ales, beers and other produce on sale were of good quality. They also kept an eye on local inns and beer houses, and made sure farms did not sell sour ale to travellers.\n\nThere are several early references to the name in Yorkshire, with variations such as Drynkell, Drinkald, Drinkal and Drinkhale.\n\nIn the 1841 Census there were 248 people recorded with the name Drinkall – with around 10 per cent of them living in Yorkshire and a larger contingent over the border in Lincolnshire.\n\nThere is also a chance that some variations of the name might have stemmed from a place-name. For example, there is a place in Yorkshire now called Dringhoe in the East Riding, which in the past was written as Drinkhoe. And there is also Dringhoe Hall, so it is not difficult to imagine a scribe writing down the name differently and it eventually turning into Drinkall.\n\nEARNSHAW\n\nIt’s many a century since eagles were regularly seen soaring over the Pennine hills. But it is possible that the distant ancestors of anyone called Earnshaw had the privilege of witnessing these magnificent birds in flight. The literal meaning of the name is ‘eagle nook or wood’ , derived from Old English words erne and halh or sceaga.\n\nThe original name would have been given to a place – probably no longer in existence, on the edge of the moors between Yorkshire and Lancashire – which was taken on as a surname during medieval times as people left their birthplace to find work elsewhere.\n\nThe first written evidence of the family name is thought to be that of Richard de Erneschaghe, which was noted&nbsp; in the Court Rolls of the Manor of Wakefield in 1316.\n\nBy the nineteenth century there were more Earnshaws in the Huddersfield area than anywhere else in the country.\n\nFABER\n\nBack in the 1300s when many surnames came into being, the scribes who recorded details for the governing bodies of the time often wrote in Latin or the language of their birthplace. This habit has given rise to a number of more unusual surnames, such as Faber.\n\nIn Latin, faber means craftsman, while in Old French it refers to a wright or a blacksmith. So really, anyone with the popular names of Smith or Wright should feel no different from the Fabers when it comes to considering their surname origins.\n\nIn the Yorkshire Poll Tax rolls of 1379 there is a record of an Adam Marshall being described as a faber, and another document shows Robertus le Faber. By the 1841 Census of England and Wales there were just 212 records of people bearing the surname, with around thirty of them being born in Yorkshire.\n\nAs usual with surnames, we can’t always be sure that these Yorkshire Fabers all have the same original meaning. There are several records in the county that show how the surname spelling has changed over the centuries.\n\nFor example, there’s a Leeds marriage in 1579 for Abraham Fawber, but seven years later the same man is described as Abraham Faber. When his wife died in 1588 she was recorded as Fawbert.\n\nThere are similar examples of Faber being written down for people who were called Falber and Falbergh. It is believed that the origin for these surnames is actually a small settlement called Fawber which lies on an old packhorse route out of Horton-in-Ribblesdale. The place-name means ‘the clearing on the hill’ and back in the 1400s it was written as Fallebergh.\n\nFAWCETT\n\nFawcett is a name which in its early history was found only in the north of England. In the 1800s Leeds was the area where it was more prevalent than anywhere else in the country, probably because people moved from rural regions to work in the factories. The original owners of the name would have come from a similarly-named place. There are a few possibles… in Cumberland, Lancashire and Forcett in North Yorkshire. The place-name either meant ‘bright slope’&nbsp; or ‘settlement by the ford’ in the Old English language.\n\nFAWKES\n\nAs many thousands of people around the country feel the urge this month to set fire to an effigy of a Yorkshireman it’s worth remembering that the surname Fawkes is ‘burnt’ deep into the county’s history.\n\nAlthough much detail of Guy Fawkes’s life is not known, and eminent genealogists still argue about certain ‘facts’, it is generally agreed that his line can be traced back to the mid 1400s around the Otley area where one of his ancestors was heir to the Farnley estate.\n\nGuy was born at Stonegate in York on 13 April 1570 the son of Edward Fawkes and Edith Blake. His father died when he was only eight and Edith remarried a catholic – and we all know what his consequent upbringing led to.\n\nThere are still many Fawkes families living in Yorkshire and elswhere in the UK – and there is a great variation in the spelling of the name, such as Faulks, Faulkes, Foulks, Foulkes and more.\n\nThey all stem from the same source, probably brought over as a first name by the Normans in 1066.\n\nThe name derives from Faulques which itself comes from an early Germanic given name, ‘Falco’, meaning falcon. This name would originally have been given as a nickname for a person thought to resemble a falcon in some way, either by appearance or action.\n\nFAWTHROP\n\nIf you search through the 1841 Census for England you’ll find only 198 people with the name Fawthrop. Of those, less than a dozen lived outside Yorkshire… and most of those few resided just over the border in Lancashire. The vast majority lived in the Halifax area and this for genealogists usually means that those whose surname is spelled as Fawthrop all sprang from a single family. At some stage during the history of the name one scribe wrote down Fawthrop and the spelling stuck with this particular branch.\n\nThere are records for at least seven different spellings of the name and there are probably even more stretching back to medieval times. It would originally have been a place-name and like most locational surnames, the further it travelled from its original ‘home’, the more unusual the spelling became. Medieval dialect was much stronger and peculiar to a specific area than it is today – even within the same county, – and spelling was certainly not universal.\n\nWritten records for various spellings of the name can be tracked in Yorkshire back to the mid 1500s but there is no record of the place-name (which could have originally meant ‘isolated farmstead’). The place could now have vanished, although there is a Felthorpe in Norfolk – it is not totally beyond the realms of possibility that someone travelled up from there in the 1500s and a scribe in Yorkshire who couldn’t quite understand a thick Broads accent wrote down Fawthrop.\n\nFEATHER\n\nMany a surname expert has pondered long and hard over the origin of Feather. Nationwide it’s an uncommon name with only around 1500 people with the surname being mentioned in the 1881 UK census. Most of them remain in Yorkshire, with the largest congregation being around the Keighley-Haworth region.\n\nDown the years some of those who study surnames have come up with the obvious conclusion that the original bearer of the name was someone who dealt with feathers, such as arrowmakers, quill makers, quiltmakers etc. The trade of feather mongers was recorded from the thirteenth century. It has also been suggested that it was originally given as a nickname for someone who was said to be as ‘light as a feather’.\n\nThere is also an idea that the name is a corruption of an old Anglo-Scandinavian personal name of Feador, which anyone who studies northern dialects will also recognise as ‘fadder’, meaning ‘father’.\n\nNo one really knows the true origin as our language and pronunciation has changed so much down the centuries… take for example the name Featherstone – it has nothing to do with feathers. In Old English the word would have been ‘fetherstan’, a northern form of feower (four) and stan (stone), this being a description of a prehistoric structure which comprised three standing stones capped by a fourth as a lid.\n\nFROBISHER\n\nMartin Frobisher was born at Thornes, near Wakefield, during the 1530s and was the son of a local merchant. His unusual Frobisher surname can still be found in the area and it has also spread further around the county. Martin was sent to school in London and after becoming a pirate (yes, a pirate – one paid by the Crown to raid French ships) he went on to become one of the country’s greatest navigators and explorers.\n\nAdmiral Sir Martin Frobisher, as this Yorkshireman later became titled, had many adventures, his most famous being a search for the Northwest Passage to the Pacific. In 1576 he crossed the Atlantic and discovered the bay in Canada that now bears his name.\n\nLater he sailed as vice admiral of Sir Francis Drake’s expedition to the West Indies, and also played a prominent part in the campaign against the Spanish Armada, during which he was knighted. In 1594 he was killed by the Spanish navy off the west coast of France.\n\nHis surname is derived from an ancient occupation. A ‘furbisher’ (or forber/furbearer as sometimes known) was someone who scoured and polished armour, swords and other metals.\n\nAlthoughYorkshire is home to many with the surname it can also be found elsewhere in the country and abroad which signifies the importance of the ‘furbisher’ in medieval times when surnames were starting to be used more frequently. Over the centuries, as spelling and pronunciation changed, so did the surname, giving rise to many different versions.\n\nGAUKRODGER\n\nGaukrodger is a fascinating Yorkshire name – and rarely found outside the county. In fact, the 1911 Census for England lists only 233 people with the name. It originated in the Sowerby area of Halifax and has been recorded there since the 1400s.\n\nContrary to what it may claim on the internet or in some reference books the surname does not stem from some ungainly chap nicknamed ‘Gawky Rodger’. Yes, gawky is an old word meaning clumsy or awkward, and even from my youth I recall children being called ‘gawky-handed’ – an old West Riding term for being left-handed (probably stemming from the French word for left, ‘gauche’.\n\nGawkro(d)ger (and several more different spellings) was initially a place-name. Close to Sowerby you’ll still find&nbsp; farmsteads called Upper and Lower Gaukroger.\n\nThe ‘rodger’ part of the name is a derivation of ‘roche(r)’ – a description you’ll find all over the Pennines, generally referring to ‘rocks’. ‘Gauk’ probably stems from an Old Norse word for ‘cuckoo’, but there is also a Norse first name ’Gauki’. Other Yorkshire place-names, such as Gawthorpe, were once ‘Gauki’s hamlet’.\n\nThe biggest clue to the name’s origin is through ancient Yorkshire court rolls. In 1402 John de Gawkrocher appears after being fined for a minor misdemeanour in the manor woodlands – the ‘de’ bit meaning he was from the place.\n\nAn eminent genealogist called George Redmonds proved that not all those born with the strange name wanted to keep it, and traced evidence of name-changing to amongst others: Barker, Platts, Brigg, Rodgers, Gawke and even Cockrobin – a nightmare for anyone wanting to trace a family tree.\n\nGELDART/GELDARD\n\nGeldart has the air of a foreign name about it – but it is firmly entrenched in Yorkshire. I have a Geldart branch in my own family tree dating back to the 1630s. The family lived on the Yorkshire-Lancashire border near Bentham. The name has the same origin as similar ones such as Geldard, Gelderd and Gelder – usually given to someone who looked after gelded horses. The Old Norse word for sterile was ‘gelda’, and the first written record of the name dates back to 1284 in the Court Rolls of the Manor of Wakefield. Today, the biggest concentrations of the name can be found in the Bradford and Harrogate postal areas.\n\nGLEWE\n\nIf you’ll pardon the awful pun, Glewe is a name that has stuck around Yorkshire for centuries. Some experts claim that the name originated in the county but that’s difficult to prove. It is generally agreed that the name is derived from the Old English (pre-seventh century) word ‘gleaw’, which meant cautious, prudent or wise (I thought all Yorkshiremen and women had those qualities?). There is also a theory that the name stems from another old word which has developed into our modern word ‘glee’, and would have been given to a person of a joyous disposition (again, surely that’s all Yorkshire folk isn’t it?).\n\nSo originally, as was common in medieval England, the name would have first been given as a nickname which then developed into a first name and later a surname.\n\nA Radulfus filius Gleu is mentioned in Yorkshire records from 1219, and a Peter Glew appears in the Subsidy Rolls of Yorkshire, dated 1301. The 1379 Poll Tax Returns Records of Yorkshire show the surname written as Glugh, Glewe and Glwe. The Glewe family is mentioned several times in the parish register of Masham during the early 1600s.\n\nOnly around 27 out of every million people have surname Glew or Glewe, and back in 1998 Doncaster boasted the largest concentration of Glewes.\n\nGRAINGER\n\nOne surname source reckons there are 13,063 people sharing the surname Grainger, the 733rd most common name in Great Britain. Make that 13,064 now that our editor has recently joined the clan. A grainger was an important chap, usually working for the Lord of the Manor in medieval or even earlier times, responsible for overseeing the collection of rent in kind into the barns and storehouses of the manor. He would look after the grange on behalf of his lordship and occupy one of the estate’s best cottages. The name is popular in Yorkshire but the biggest concentration is in the Midlands.\n\nGREEN/GREY\n\nCalling people names because of the way they look could get you in trouble today, but some 700-800 years ago it was considered normal. In villages where there might have been dozens of people called John, they would have been distinguished one from another by describing their looks — perhaps John White, Grey or Brown etc, and these eventually became their surnames.\n\nSometimes the name might relate to a person’s complexion or the colour of their hair. It is even known to have been related to the dominant colour of the clothes a person was associated with.\n\nBlunt is another descriptive surname but not as we understand the word to mean today, for ‘blunt’ is an old Anglo-Norman French word meaning blonde.\n\nDon’t worry if your name is Green — your ancestors didn’t have oddly shaded skin or hair – they were probably so called because they lived near the village green. The surname Black is even more misleading as it is not possible to say from which Old English word the name is derived… ‘blaec’ or ‘blac’. The former meant the dark colour; the latter meant almost the opposite: ‘pale’ (think of our current word ‘bleak’).\n\nThankfully, there weren’t that many words around to describe colours back in the thirteenth century, therefore we don’t have people called ‘muted mocha’, ‘fresh mountain dew’ or ‘urban obsession’ — just three modern colours to be found at the DIY store.\n\nHARDCASTLE\n\nPrior to the Industrial revolution, generations of families stayed in the same small rural region, such as the Yorkshire Dales, for hundreds of years. The Ellertons and Aldersons hailed from Swaledale, Metcalfe was and still is a Wensleydale name; Sedgwicks and Capsticks lived in Dentdale. The Redmaynes and Kidds were dominant in the Ingleton area; Demaime and Lister were Wharfedale families; Armitstead, Carr and Paley from North Ribblesdale… the list goes on.\n\nThe Hardcastle clan have been in Nidderdale at least since the thirteenth century. On a modern map you will still find Hardcastle Moor near Greenhow, and earlier maps show a farm or hamlet called Hardcastle. Whether this was named after the family, or the family took their name from the place we’ll probably never know for certain. In records from1358 Richard de Hardcastell also held property in the area.\n\nSome internet surname sites claim the name stems from the place we now know as Hardcastle Crags, near Hebden Bridge, but this is unlikely, especially in the case of the Nidderdale folk. In fact, a published study of the name – The Roots of the Hardcastles: An old Yorkshire Family – suggests the original Nidderdale family came from further north, probably Northumberland near Hadrian’s Wall, and were named after a former tower there. The book says they moved south to become tenants on land granted to the monks of Fountains Abbey who administered much of the land in Nidderdale at the time.\n\nMany will assume that the literal meaning of Hardcastle is ‘a strong fortified building’ but this is not necessarily so. In the Old English language ‘castel’ meant ‘a small village or settlement’. And ‘heorde’ meant herd (flock) or shepherd/cowherd. There could have been several places with such a name.\n\nIn the 1841 Census for England and Wales, there were 1,451 Hardcastles registered – 1,076 of them were living in Yorkshire at the time.\n\nHARDISTY\n\nA search of the 1911 Census for England and Wales reveals around 1,800 people with the name Hardisty (or similar spelling), with 90 per cent of them living in Yorkshire. Hardisty was one of the dominant family names in Nidderdale for centuries. In 1681 William and Arthur Hardisty bought the manorial rights to part of the Forest of Knaresborough. In the Hearth Tax of 1672 the Hardistys in Hampsthwaite and Fewston parishes, made up 7% of the taxpayers, meaning that many of them were landowners or well-to-do yeomen.\n\nThe surname goes back much further in Nidderdale history. Poll Tax records for the West Riding of 1379 show a Stephanus and a Johannes de Hardolfsty, both from the village of Great Timble.\n\nOriginally, Hardisty was a placename which has been recorded in several ways down the centuries, spelling varying as we changed our language. In Anglo-Saxon the place would have been called something similar to Heardwulfstig which means Hardulf’s path, Hardulf being the name of a Saxon landowner or an original settler in the area from pre-Norman times. His given name meant ‘brave wolf’.\n\nEven though the majority of Hardistys seem to have stuck to their Yorkshire roots, one branch did spread afar and gain fame. Richard Charles Hardisty (1831-1889) became a politician in Canada and was so revered he had a village in Alberta named after him. There was also a Hardisty amongst the early settlers to New England in 1635.\n\nHARKER\n\nThere has always been much speculation about the source of the&nbsp; popular Yorkshire surname Harker.\n\nOne theory is that it was an occupational name given to a member of the Medieval Watch, a sort of early policeman. This derives from the seventh century Old English word ‘herkien’ meaning to listen or harken. It has also been said that it comes from a continental personal name Arker or even that early holders of the name arrived from Harcourt in Normandy. Some claim it was a nickname for an eavesdropper while others say that a harker was a kind of spear used by ancient armies and so the name was given to someone who made or used them.\n\nMy preference for the Yorkshire clan is that it derives from a place in Swaledale which we now know as Harkerside but which was once recorded, amongst other names, as Herkey. Back in in the 1500s there were families called Harkaye listed in Swaledale manorial rolls and church records but by the 1600s the descendants of these families had changed the spelling to Harker… probably due to the fact that few people could read or write or the person recording the name could not clearly understand the local accent. The origin of that place-name is likely to be from a personal name of an\n\nHATTERSLEY\n\nThe largest concentration of the Hattersley surname is to be found in Yorkshire – in Sheffield in the south and the York area to the north. The name obviously stems from a location but surname experts don’t all agree as to where that place might be.\n\nThe most obvious choice you would have thought is a place just over the Yorkshire border in Longdendale, Cheshire, now called Hattersley, but which was once known as ‘heahdeor leah’ – a pre seventh-century term meaning ‘deer enclosure’.\n\nHowever, others believe the surname stems from what is now known as Haddlesey, near Selby. Around the time of the Norman conquest this place was recorded as Hathelsae, meaning ‘marshy pool’. The surname was first seen in writing in the Yorkshire Poll Tax returns for 1379 where Willelmus de Hatyray and Amicia Hattisray appear. Pronunciation and spelling for many surnames and place-names have changed dramatically over the centuries\n\nThe two places may explain the distinct regions of distribution for the surname. Former politician and author Roy Hattersley is famously connected with Sheffield, so he may well stem from the south Yorkshire clan.\n\nOther famous Hattersleys were Richard and his son George, the earliest manufacturers of power looms, based in Keighley. Their first loom, built in 1834, didn’t last long though as it was wrecked by Luddites at Nab Wood, Shipley, while being delivered to a mill.\n\nHEBBLETHWAITE\n\nThere are certain surnames which conjure up ‘Yorkshireness’&nbsp; all on their own. One such is Hebblethwaite, stemming as it does from a place meaning ‘clearing near the plank bridge’. There could once have been more than one place called Hebblethwaite but the most popular would seem to have been in the Calderdale area.&nbsp; When surnames first came into common use, around the 13th century, many people took on the name of the place where they originated when they moved from the village, probably for work ,and settled somewhere else. Not surprisingly, in 1881 the biggest congregation of Hebblethwaites was around Halifax but nowadays&nbsp; many seem to have migrated north east and can be found in the East Riding.\n\nHEMINGWAY\n\nI don’t know if the ancestry of American novelist Ernest Miller Hemingway has ever been researched throughly, but there’s a good chance it would uncover a connection with Yorkshire and in particular the West Riding.\n\nThe surname is derived from a minor locality, probably near Halifax, which cannot now be identified. The Scandinavian personal name Hemingr was still in use during the 1300s when many surnames started being used. The meaning of the place-name was probably Hemingr’s way – or ‘the path to Hemingr’s estate’.\n\nAccording to surnames expert George Redmonds, ‘the name is evidenced from the fourteenth century, ramified initially in Southowram and soon spread to Birstall and Dewsbury’.\n\nThere is a record in the Yorkshire Court Rolls dating from 1307 which relates to a Richard de Hemyngway of Hipperholme and in the 1379 Poll Tax records of a William Hemyngway of Southowram.\n\nHowever, tracing Hemingway ancestors can prove difficult. Spelling of this particular name has fluctuated greatly down the centuries. One researcher who has carried out a one-name study on Hemingway (www.hemingway.uk.com) has found well over a hundred written variations.\n\nThere are also other place-names stemming from that original personal name, such as Hemingfield near Wombwell, and Hemingby in Lincolnshire. And there are surnames which have derived directly from Hemingr, like Hemmings, or one ancestor of mine I discovered from the 1600s whose surname was Hermyne.\n\nIn the 1841 Census for England there were 1,483 Hemingways registered, with around three-quarters of them living in Yorkshire. Today it is thought there are around 12.5k people bearing the name worldwide, with the greatest number of British Hemingways still residing in the West Riding.\n\nHEPWORTH\n\nUnsurprisingly, the name Hepworth stems from people who, when surnames first started being needed (around the 1300s), lived in the village of Hepworth, near Huddersfield. The 1881 Census shows there were 3,418 Hepworths registered in the country — around 70 per cent of them living in Yorkshire. Further back, around 1274, six male ‘de Heppeworths’ were recorded in the County Court Rolls.\n\nOver the centuries the majority of Hepworths did not travel very far. The 1672 Hearth Tax returns for the West Riding stated that many of 40 taxpayers named Hepworth had moved to the nearby Calder Valley or the mining areas of south-west Yorkshire where work was available.\n\nIt is thought that there are less than 9,000 Hepworths around the world with the highest concentration now being in the Heckmondwike area – which happens to be where my late mother, a Hepworth herself, was born.\n\nThe place-name is thought to translate to ‘the farmstead of Heppa’, an Anglo-Saxon given name, although there is also an ancient word, ‘hep’, which means high. Hepworth is certainly high – and steep.\n\nIt is said that Hepworth was the most northern point reached by the plague of 1665 which devastated London. According to local legend the disease arrived via cloth brought from the capital. To save as many residents as possible, the village was split into two parts at Barracks Fold. Those who were infected were isolated in one half. Thirteen people died there – a considerable percentage of the village’s population at the time.\n\nJoseph Hepworth (1834–1911), from Lindley, founded clothing manufacturers Joseph Hepworth &amp; Son, which became the UK’s largest clothing manufacturer. Sculptor Barbara Hepworth’s family were from the Batley area, and it is likely that she, and most of today’s Hepworths, sprang from those half-dozen or so males who lived in the village back in the 13th century.\n\nHESKETH\n\nHesketh is best known as a Lancastrian name but there’s a fair sprinkling in Yorkshire too and it could be the different groups have separate origins. The surname started when someone moved from somewhere called Hesketh and took on the place of their birth as a surname so that he could be distinguished from someone else in the village or town to where he’d moved.\n\nThere are several places around the country called Hesketh – today the best known being Hesketh Bank, near Southport. There’s also Hesket in Cumberland but the Yorkshire branch of Heskeths could well have stemmed from a place near West Ardsley. At one time this Hesketh would have been a small hamlet but now it’s just about been gobbled up by surrounding areas. You will still find Hesketh Farm and Hesketh Lane etc.\n\nThere are also other places in Yorkshire named Hesketh and they were all originally to with horses. ‘Hestre’&nbsp; is an Old Norse name meaning horse while ’skied’ (or similar) was a word for course or track… in other words, what we now call a race course. Our Viking ancestors were very fond of horses… and yes, they did eat horsemeat.\n\nHESP\n\nDeep in the roots of my family tree is hidden the surname Hesp. Born around 1600 in West Heslerton near Pickering, was Peter Hesp, one of my 9xgreat-grandfathers. Other genealogists tracing the same line say that Peter’s father was a Mr Hespe born in 1575, but for me that’s where the trail goes cold.\n\nMy research into the origin of the name is somewhat chilly as well. In Britain the surname was once seemingly limited to that part of the East Riding, and some surname researchers believe it originated around there. Even by the 1881 Census all but 23 of the 236 Hesps recorded in the whole country lived in Yorkshire, with 31 in Pickering and 17 remaining in West Heslerton.\n\nThe most popularly accepted origin of the surname is that the name was given to someone who lived close to an important or striking aspen tree. The Old English word for aspen is ‘oespe’ and this has given rise to many variations of the surname such as Apse, Happs and Hepse.\n\nThe aspen would have been a significant tree in medieval times when surnames became more prevalent. It is a lightweight wood and was once used by ancient tribes for making shields. When dried aspen becomes very buoyant and was therefore a popular choice for making oars and paddles. Aspen shoots are also popular with grazing animals, and in the past aspen leaves were fed to cattle when other food was scarce.\n\nOther theories about the name’s origin include it deriving from the word ‘hasp’ which refers to hanks of linen, stemming from an Icelandic word ‘hespa’.\n\nPerhaps another clue to its meaning is that the surname is almost as popular in Holland as it is in Britain. In Dutch, particularly in the south of the country, ‘hesp’ is the word for ham. So perhaps a Hesp travelled over from the continent centuries ago to settle in the East Riding.\n\nHEY/HAWORTH\n\nToday we think of hay as being the animal feed farmers grow, but back when we spoke Old English (roughly between 500 and 1100) ‘hey’ meant a boundary or hedged enclosure. As surnames began to be needed, a person might have been known as ‘John from the Hey’ if he lived at such a place.\n\nThere are also several place-names called Hey, and someone moving from that settlement might have been initially called ‘John of Hey’. Because the surname Hey is most common in the West Riding of Yorkshire and East Lancashire it is likely that a large branch of the family originated in that district. There’s a Hey near Foulridge and another near Scammonden on the Yorks-Lancs border.\n\nThe Yorkshire Poll Tax of 1379 lists a few people with the name Hey, including Willelmus del Heye. In his book, Surnames, DNA & Family History, David Hey (so he should know!) states that documentary evidence suggests many with the surname descend from a family who farmed at the place now known as Hey Lathe near Scammonden.\n\nDavid writes about the smallholding being described in the 1600s as ‘perfectly preserved in the landscape by a dyke, a continuous wall, and a prominent bank thrown up from a well-defined ditch’ which matches perfectly with the original translation of ‘hey’. Alan del Heye and his son Thomas were recorded as paying fees for the land in 1333.\n\nThe word hey is also thought to have come from the Anglo-Saxon word ‘haga’, which again meant a fenced enclosure or hawthorn hedge. Some historians believe the place-name – and subsequent surname – Haworth has a similar origin to Hey.\n\nThe place was recorded as a settlement in the thirteen century as ‘Hauewrth’ in 1209 and as ‘Hawurth’ in 1252. A basic translation could be ‘the homestead at the enclosure’. The earliest record of the surname is that of Robert de Hawurth, dated 1200 in the Pipe Rolls of Yorkshire\n\nHOLMES\n\nThe origin of the surname Holmes is elementary, my dear readers. Basically, it describes someone who lived by a holm (or group of holms) – a Viking word for a slightly raised island, usually surrounded by streams or water. It is thought that because these ‘holms’ could not support many families they saw frequent migration and inevitably the new neighbours in the Middle Ages would have described the migrants as, for example, ‘John of the Holm/s’.\n\nThe surname is found chiefly in the north where the Viking influence was strongest, as can also be seen by the number of place-names containing the word holm.\n\nThe name Urkell de Holmes appeared in the Yorkshire assize court rolls of 1219, while today there are thought to be around 72,000 people called Holmes in the UK, with the most numerous being in Yorkshire.\n\nThe Holmes name appears frequently among the early farmers of Nidderdale while the alternative spelling, Holme, is also prevalent in the county. The manor of Paull Holme on Humberside was owned by the Holme family, who took their name from the place as early as 1295.\n\nWhat about Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes? Some say the fictional detective was named after The Holmes below Ribblehead Viaduct, with which Doyle would have been familiar, as his mother, Mary, lived in nearby Masongill. Furthermore, the vicar of Ingleton at that time was Rev Thomas Sherlock, whose father, Randal Hopley Sherlock, hit the headlines when he was killed by lightning at Ingleton Station.\n\nThe Sherlock Holmes Society, however, says there is no Yorkshire connection. They claim he started life on the page as Sherringford Hope but Doyle later changed it – probably naming the sleuth after a fellow jurist and doctor Oliver Wendell Holmes, while the first name may have come from Alfred Sherlock, a prominent violinist of his time.\n\nHOOD\n\nNot wishing to get embroiled in an argument over whether the legendary Robin Hood was from Yorkshire or one of those other places outside our boundary, all I will say that the surname Hood – and a multitude of different spellings – is mainly a northern name.\n\nBecause there are so many similar sounding surnames, such as Hud(d), Hode, Hude and several others, it is impossible to unravel the history of the name. Many experts think it stems from a time when Hud or Hood was given as a nickname for someone called Richard. In the Middle Ages there would have been a lot of children called Richard, so to distinguish one from another many would have been given such a nickname.\n\nBut Hud was also an ancient given name with many examples found in western and northern Europe from where settlers landed on these shores. Hud as a first name appears many times in the Domesday Book, while in the Yorkshire Poll Tax Rolls for 1379 there are references, such as Matilda Hud-doghter, Emma Hud-wyf, Johannes Hud-son. Hudson became another popular surname.\n\nThen there is the theory that the surname was given to someone who made hoods (hód is an Old English and Saxon word for a head covering). Hold on to your hood… I’ve not finished yet. Another theory is that the surname could come from and old Saxon word houdt, which for those who spoke the language meant ‘the wood’, referring to a local forested area.\n\nI’ll just throw in one more suggestion … in some parts of the country ’hud’ was an ancient word for ‘mill’, so the original bearer of the name could have been a miller or lived by a mill.\n\nHistorian Joseph Hunter discovered many different Robin Hoods (with different spellings) when looking at the history of mediev"
