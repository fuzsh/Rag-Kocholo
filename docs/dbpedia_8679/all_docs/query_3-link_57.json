        "text": "In the same vein as my earlier posts on important people associated with Cudworth, I can say without contradiction, that the manor and township had very close connections with some very important people – sometimes in two different ways.\n\nIt is a feature of the feudal system that the King (and later the Queen) owned all the land, but that this was freely given out to others with the condition of payments or service. As an example, the term ‘knights fee’ is fundamental to the feudal idea since the costs of maintaining a knight in the service of his overlord – the costs for his keep and sustenance, along with his family, the costs of paying, and equipping a number of armed assistants including any squire, the costs of purchasing and maintaining his weapons and armour, and a place to live. A manor was not a farm or a village in the modern sense it was in the feudal period simply an economic unit. In all its functions it had a value. The costs of maintain a knight to the manner appropriate to his particular rank was known and accepted and this was a knights’ fee. A manor may represent a fee, or a part of a fee.\n\nWhen Ilbert de Lasci was granted the great honour of Pontefract by the King (William I) – he became the tenant in chief of the honour, not the owner. The honour was nonetheless an hereditament, that is to say that it could be passed on to successors providing they were in the King’s good graces and that they continued to furnish armed men and equipment in time of war or insurrection. Ilbert having been granted the honour as reward for his services to the King during and after the conquest, he in turn rewarded his main supporters by grants of land for one or more knights’ fees dependent upon how important they were within his household.\n\nGilbert de Stapleton was granted several knights’ fees of which the manor of Cudworth amounted to between a quarter and a half of a knights’ fee. The chief manor of the fee was at Darrington (which included Stapleton) the centre of the de Stapleton estates.\n\nTherefore it is clear that from the start the King owned Cudworth, but it was nominally in the honour of Pontefract, rather than directly in the King’s hands. The honour of Pontefract through the next three centuries ended up as a constituent part of the Duchy of Lancaster.\n\nWhen Henry Bolingbroke (Duke of Hereford), following the death of his father the 1st Duke of Lancaster, challenged and took the throne of his cousin Richard II, the Duke of Lancaster and the reigning monarch became one and the same person. The manor of Cudworth was not only ultimately owned by King Henry IV of England, but it was in his tenancy in chief as Duke of Lancaster. This arrangement ceased as the Monarch took the Lancastrian rights as his own as the ultimate owner, excluding the Crown from all Lancastrian holdings – he was the Crown and could that if he wished!\n\nAfter the dissolution of the monasteries a great deal of monastic land found itself in the possession of the Duke of Lancaster (this would have been Henry VIII) including the land within Cudworth formerly in the possession of the Monastery dedicated to St Oswald and known as Nostell – it may be that the lands here possessed by the priory at Lund (Monk Bretton) also went to Lancaster. This complicates the picture because remember there is also a Lord of the Manor who is the tenant of the Duke, and now the Duke owns some of the land directly – one assumes that if the Lords of the Manor at that time were running Courts Leet or Courts Baron, that the King was not expected to turn up to swear allegiance and pay his dues to the Lord of the Manor!\n\nThe Duchy passed as it still does to the successive King or Queen. After Henry’s death it therefore passed to Edward VI (then briefly to Lady Jane Grey), then to Mary I.\n\nMary I, colloquially Bloody Mary, is remembered in history as retaining the religion of her mother Catherine of Aragon. Her marriage to Philip II of Spain reinforced the movement away from the Protestantism of Edward’s brief reign. In her capacity as Duke of Lancaster, she tried to found what she imagined would be a modern religious house, a hospital for holy charity on the site of the Savoy palace (which had been built between the City of London and Westminster by the first Duke of Lancaster, John of Gaunt – Bolingbroke’s father). This Savoy Hospital was established with a master and with chaplains and endowed with land. On 6 April 1558, Mary gave a whole raft of holdings in many manors, most of which had been monastic possessions until her father had suppressed the monasteries. Among these were “lands in Cudworth, late the tenures of Richard Coward and John Jenkenson, late belonging to St Oswald’s”.\n\nFrom that date then, Cudworth had a new landowner, the Master and Chaplains of the Savoy Hospital. In common with the issues that Thomas Cromwell had cited as being the problems of mismanagement and improper conduct within the monasteries, so these accusations came to be lodged against the hospital. It was suppressed by Elizabeth I and revived by the Stuarts, before being closed again with the ownership of its possessions passing back to the Duchy.\n\nQueen Elizabeth I made a great number of land acquisitions during her reign, including quite a few in the vicinity of Cudworth. The lands upon which the Crown lane, (later Crown Avenue and its estate) was built were actually Crown lands, hence the name. These were in the possession of Elizabeth I in right of the Crown, whereas the rest of the manor were hers ultimately (although tenanted to a Lord of the Manor) by right of the Duchy of Lancaster. Complicated eh?\n\nThe eighteenth century saw a great deal of upheaval in the family of the Lords of the Manor which resulted in all sorts of legal uncertainties about inheritance, and there was the growing clamour for enclosures. Thus the Duchy of Lancaster, made at least two surveys of their direct holdings in Cudworth, in 1770 and then again in 1816. These were in the name of the Duchy, but they included the heading Savoy lands. The Cudworth Inclosure Act came into force during the time of the Lordship of the Manor of Ann Elizabeth Meyrick, in 1809. It was her death as a spinster in 1816 that inevitably led to the several legal claims that ended up taking years to be considered in the Court of Chancery and finally resulted in an Act of Parliament on 10 June 1825.\n\nSome while ago I was having a conversation with a Cudworthian who was telling me about his knowledge of the origins of the street names in Cudworth. He had mentioned Bloemfontein Street as being named in celebration of the capture of Bloemfontein in South Africa during the second Boer War in 1900. This same person went on to say that neighbouring Jackson Street might have been named for a General officer, but that he was not sure.\n\nTo be quite honest, I have not yet seen the documents of the Cudworth Urban District Council, who would probably have been responsible for naming the street, but my guess is that the street was laid down during 1906 or thereabouts as it does not appear on any older OS maps, and that was the year that the Cudworth Gas Undertaking came into being. Cudworth UDC started a business to distribute gas to households and its works were set back from the Barnsley Road and were sited on what is today named as Birch Tree Farm. Their front wall is part of the legacy of the gas undertaking, as this was built by and for them.\n\nHow does this link with the name Jackson?\n\nHenry Jackson was the man who built the Midland Bleach works in Cudworth. He was essentially a self-made man, although as we shall see he was from a long line of notable land-owners. He had built up a significant business in Barnsley as a linen bleacher and merchant. He was in partnership with various others, including the Nottinghamshire born flax grower, William Bamforth, who by now was a yeoman farmer in Cudworth. His two companies made him one of the of the larger operators during the heyday of the Barnsley linen trade which was, in itself, the first of the major industrial waves to underpin the growth of Barnsley’s economy and arguably the catalyst for the urbanisation of the town. The period of the linen trade in Barnsley ran from when it was a small cottage industry in the 1740s, rising to its zenith after 1816 but declining to almost nothing by the late 1850s. It is likely that there is a story to tell of influence by Henry Jackson in the proposal for the Barnsley to Pontefract turnpike Act of 1825. The evidence I would cite is that his main bleach works before the Cudworth venture was his business named Harvey, Jackson & Co at the Beevor bleach-works. These works would have been entirely inaccessible until the new turnpike was built, and as I have written elsewhere, this was an entirely newly constructed road. The Midland bleach-works was constructed immediately past the toll gate at Cudworth bridge and adjacent to the even more recently turnpiked road which extended the trust’s control through Cudworth with the 1833 Act. [Jackson was also one half of the partnership of Jackson and Hodgetts (linen warehouse in Church Street), and was married to Jane Tee, whose father was a principal in the linen manufacturing business trading as Richardson, Tee and Rycroft)]\n\nHenry had purchased a sizeable chunk of Cudworth in a number of different transactions, including the Knowles (where the gas works was to be built) and Hugan Green and pretty much all the land to the west of the pre-1833 Barnsley to Pontefract Road (which came from Cudworth bridge on the Barnsley Road, along what is now Manor Road and St John’s Road to the junction where the Star Inn stands – which he also owned!) – watch this space, but I promise a map to show this old road which I have already described in an earlier blog. It is fascinating that the purchase of one or two of these plots was from various members of the Drummond banking family and the Cholmondeley’s, all of whom were litigants in a Chancery action against Meyrick Banks who became Lord of the Manor after his inheritance from Ann Elizabeth Meyrick, the last direct successor of the Jopson family – who was also a distant cousin! This was one of a number of actions that embroiled the extended family in dispute over the will of An Elizabeth’s older brother, from whom she had conditionally inherited the manor of Cudworth.\n\nHis father was the owner of Middlewood House in Darfield at some point, but Henry, as his wealth increased, also bought a home in Darfield. Eventually he bought the old Vicarage and this was where his children were born. As with all life it must end, and in his case his rational mind seems to have departed a little earlier than his physical self, since when he died he had been for some while an in-patient at a sanatorium for the insane in Liverpool (Tue Brook Villa). The location may have been because his son-in-law was an Anglican priest in that area and his daughter Edith may have been responsible for looking after his welfare. His son and daughter were both beneficiaries of his will, as was his widow. It was his children, however, who were mentioned in the 1906 documentation relating to the sale of the land to Cudworth UDC for the gas works.\n\nHis son was Henry Bradwardine Jackson, who became both a knight and an Admiral. Indeed his fame was gained as the leading authority on developing ship to shore wireless telegraphy – even Marconi regarded him as the senior partner in their joint work. He became assistant director of torpedoes and was appointed Third Sea Lord and Controller of the Navy at around the time that he was selling Knowles in Cudworth. After the failure of the Dardanelles and the public falling out between the First Lord of the Admiralty (Winston Churchill) and the First Sea Lord, John Fisher, Sir Henry was appointed First Sea Lord in Fisher’s place. He was uncomfortable in that role and stood down to be appointed Principal Naval ADC to the King and promoted to Admiral of the Fleet.\n\nStrangely it was this later Jackson that enabled me to join the dots and link them to the much earlier family as I shall explain in part two.\n\nWhen I first moved to Cudworth, I made initial enquiries about its history. In speaking to one local I was told that no-one famous ever came here. He was not, of course referring to modern celebrities since he appeared to have been at school with Sir Michael Parkinson, who grew up on or about the Birk Wood estate, and he claimed to know the Olympian Dorothy Hyman of old. He was talking about a deeper historical time-frame – and perhaps he was right. I suppose it does depend upon what you might regard as fame and history.\n\nMy researches tell me that a great many notable people from history have had contact with, owned land within or otherwise had an impact on Cudworth. This article is not likely to be long enough to do justice to the people concerned so I am going to tell the story of the Jopsons, since they were very important to Cudworth, being Lords of the Manor for a long while, and moreover, they lived here! They were also the connection with a wide range of politically important national figures, many of whom were to have legal tussles over the ownership of the manor of Cudworth. Even this would be too long a tale for a single article, so I shall start with the story of Mary Witham – known to history as Dame Mary Bolles!\n\nProbably the most enduring legacy of Dame Mary was the bequest that she made in her will in which £200 was left, the interest of which to be distributed primarily for educating the young, half for the parish of Royston (as a whole) and half for Cudworth (which was also a part of the parish of Royston). I understand that this and other charities were amalgamated in the early 1990s and so no longer exists, as such.\n\nMary Witham was born in 1579, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth I and even before the Armada sailed, she was the daughter of William Witham and his wife Eleanor (nee Neale). She was born at Ledston, part of the parish of Ledsham in the old West Riding. William Witham was Lord of the Manor of Ledston. Part of her later fame was derived from the fact that her family were reasonably well-off and that Mary became heiress to her brother Henry, who died unmarried leaving the Heath estate to her.\n\nMary first married Thomas Jopson, whose father Robert had purchased the Manor of Cudworth in 1585. Robert senior and his eldest son Robert junior had both purchased parcels of land as they became available within the manor from 1585 until 1599 when Thomas, the younger son also joined in the expansion of the family lands and the manor. The lands within the boundaries of the manor of Cudworth actually owned by the manor, in common with most manors, had been shrinking steadily since it was first formed in the twelfth century. The monasteries at Lund and at Nostell had both owned land here, which had been sold off to various people after the dissolution, although neither had ever actually owned the manor itself nor the mineral rights under it. The successors of the old Thegnal family of Ailric, Swein and Adam FitzSwein seem to have continued to hold a small holding here (they had been lords in right of their control of the wapentakes of Osgoldcross and Staincross before the Norman Conquest), although they had presented much of their holding to Lund, but the residue seems to have been vested in the holdings of the neighbouring manor of Brierley which had been granted to them by the founder of the manor of Cudworth, Ilbert de Lacey.\n\nRobert senior died leaving his estate to his second son Thomas and thereby to his wife, Mary Jopson as she then was. Their son Thomas was to inherit from Thomas senior, when he died at an early age. Thomas junior married Ann Stringer, with whom he had at least five children, but when he and Ann both died young (he had married a second time but had no issue from the second marriage) the care of his surviving children, especially his heir, was given to Mary.\n\nMary, in her first widowhood had married a second time. To a widow with a number of Children, Thomas Bolles of Osberton in Nottinghamshire. As Mary Bolles, she was a wealthy woman, both through her husband and because of her own inherited estates. When she became guardian of the young William Jopson, she became also de facto Lord of the Manor of Cudworth, during William’s minority. Her reputation is generally one of being able to be in charge of her situation, but also kindly to those to whom she is responsible and loved by her children and step-children. The evidence for this last assertion is given in the various wills of both her own children and those of her Bolles step-children, she is specifically mentioned in the most kindly way, and she outlived many of them.\n\nShe was also remembered in some accounts as being eccentric. It is unclear whether that is the case, but she was certainly a staunchly loyal person. When King Charles I wished to raise funds for the proper foundation of a colony in Nova Scotia he chose to create new baronetcies to sell off. Mary Bolles, a wealthy but laudably loyal subject, paid the heavy price for the honour in 1635, thus becoming the first, and so-far the only woman for whom a baronetcy has been created in Great Britain. Thus it was that Dame Mary Bolles, Baronetess of Nova Scotia gained her title.\n\nShe retired to her own estate at Heath, living in the Old Hall (which was built by her father or brother in 1595) and died there in 1666 – having survived the Tudors, the early Stuarts, the Inter-regnum and Civil War, and the restoration of the monarchy. Heath Old Hall was demolished in 1961, but in the estate there still stands the Dame Mary Bolles Water Tower which she had built.\n\nIt is almost certain that she lived in Cudworth during her marriage to Thomas Jopson, and very likely spent time her during the minority of William. Her successors were to hold the manor until it was inherited by a cousin on the death of Dame Mary’s great-great-great-great-granddaughter, Ann Elizabeth Meyrick in the early nineteenth century.\n\nThe deep mining period, especially that of the twentieth century is outside of my particular focus of study, but the local history group specialises in this later period. However, the mining heritage in Cudworth actually goes back much further, at least to the twelfth century and I know of at least three shallow mines here throughout the medieval period, along with related quarries. The shallow mines, probably bell type, examples were situated at either end of the main length of the Cudworth seam with pits on the north side of Cudworth Common near Grimethorpe dyke and just on the Cudworth side of the border with Brierley manor by Ferry Moor.\n\nThe mineral rights were, until the modern day, owned by the Lord of the Manor and leased to others for exploitation of the coal or other minerals. One very early mining organisation here was Monk Bretton priory at Lundwood (They also owned the Lund Wood of which the Birk Wood was probably a residual part]. There was a tradition of mining associated with the mediaeval monasteries in the old West Riding, such that one of the most noted mediaeval mining engineers was Prior at Nostell, a monk who originally came from Wombwell. He was the first to devise a means of pumping water from the pit.\n\nThe first deep mining operations were by private companies, and probably the most notable in Cudworth was the Carlton Main. People will tell you that there was no mine here in Cudworth, but what they mean is that the entrance to the mine was not actually within Cudworth’s traditional boundaries. However, the mines ran under Cudworth, and they had to have the consent of the mineral rights owner, the Lord of the Manor. They would have actively sought out and paid for these rights since the Barnsley seam coal from the Middle Pennine Coal Measures is regarded as of high quality, with the Cudworth seam being especially highly prized and valuable coal. The Cudworth seam runs parallel to the Darfield and Snydale road in a generally zig-zagging pattern due to ancient geological stresses, and it is in fact horizontally fractured just to the east of Darfield Road splitting the seam into two separate parts with the two previously joined ends being nearly 500 metres from each other. This is good evidence of great geological perhaps seismic activity in the distant past.\n\nThe lords of the manor did not own all the land within Cudworth, even from when the manor was first established back in the very early part of the twelfth century but they did have manorial and judicial rights granted by the King which included the sole right to the minerals below ground. The first lord of the manor was Gilbert de Stapleton, who was granted Cudworth at some point after 1086. The previous ‘owner’ a Thegn under Edward the Confessor before 1066 still retained some land in Cudworth, owing fealty to the manor court, and also appears to have been Lord of the manors of Carlton and Brierley. Ilbert de Lacy, Lord of the Honour of Pontefract was overlord and de facto tenant in chief of the king for all three manors. The grandson of the former Thegn was named Adam Fitz Swain, who founded the Priory at Lundwood, and within whose original gift included parcels of land in Cudworth including at least one of the mines.\n\nUnder the terms of the 1938 Coal Act and especially because of the 1946 Coal Nationalisation Act the mines, the mineral rights and the land holding of all private mines became the property of the National Coal Board. The NCB not having much need for farmland announced in the London Gazette in 1950 that they intended to sell off all these unneeded assets, but it took more than another decade before they finally did sell them off. Fred Silverwood was a young farmer and took advantage with his father’s support he was one of the tenants who bought their farms from the National Coal Board in the 1960s. These assets had been inherited from the nationalised Carlton Main, who had until 1936 been a tenant of the Lords of the Manor, but bought the mineral rights and the land, and probably the Manorial rights in that year. Interestingly the bricks used in parts of the local buildings in White Cross Road were made by Carlton Main in their specialist brickworks which eventually moved from Carlton to Grimethorpe – these bricks are identifiable by the name ‘Carlton Main’ in their frogs (that’s the indent on the top of a brick).\n\nI carried out an analysis of the population from 1850, these I have as spreadsheets, comparing the census details of the residents of Cudworth as they passed from a primarily agrarian to an industrial economy. The main employer in Barnsley in 1850 was linen weaving. The only scheduled monument in Cudworth relates to this trade, the chimney still visible from the new by-pass. The local farms were likely growing flax as a cash crop in addition to their more arable and other crops. The employment of the roughly 500 people was based on these general trades, although the railways had started to arrive and the deep mines were being sunk. The North Midland Railway (circa 1840) was the first to come to Cudworth, and is the one that runs nearest to the boundary of Cudworth along the line of the Small Bridge and Cudworth Dikes. The people working on the railway, in the main, were newcomers. As the deep mines were developed so the influx of newcomers increased and swamped the old population. Most of the new trades went to new people, trained in the Midlands or in South Wales. It would be interesting to discover if any of the children in the schools now in Cudworth are descended from pre-1850 Cudworth families. Most will be descended from families from much farther afield than Cudworth.\n\nIn the seventeenth century the manor was inherited by William Jopson, the great-grandson of Robert Jopson who bought the manor from the successors of the de Stapleton’s in 1585. He also inherited his grandmother’s baronetcy making him Sir William. When he died his wife Lady Lucy Jopson (nee Tindall), married again, this time to Sir John Jackson, Bt., of Hickleton, of whose descendants included Henry Jackson. Henry lived in Darfield eventually, but he built a business of linen weaving in Barnsley, one of the major firms in what before coal and wire making was the major employer in the town. Henry Jackson purchased a number of plots of land in the manor which included the area known as Knowles, much of the Hugan Green area right up to and including the Star Inn. The linen weaving trade relies on the raw material of flax. Henry Jackson built the bleaching works adjacent to where the North Midland railway was built and named it the Midland Bleaching Works. The remaining buildings include the chimney stack, visible from the new Cudworth Parkway, it is a protected building.\n\nIn 1826 a yeoman farmer of Cudworth, William Bamforth, ended his partnership with George Scales. The London Gazette tells us that Scales was a linen manufacturer in Hawton, Nottinghamshire and that William Bamforth was formerly of Hawton, and that their partnership was formed for the ‘spinning of flax, the bleaching and manufacturing of flax and linen cloth’. It is likely then that Bamforth, the farmer, was a flax grower. Hawton had been a centre for linen based on the extensive Hawton mills. We know that Bamforth was already in Cudworth since he is recorded in the 1822 Baines Trade directory, had occupation of the manor owned Malt kiln and was listed as the maltster and as a farmer, and he also purchased the land and rights of the Knowles quarry. He was listed as a trustee in both the 1825 and 1833 turnpike road Acts for Cudworth – as owner of the Knowles quarry, he would have had a great interest in it since the road was to pass through his quarry. In 1832 Bamforth’s daughter married a Mr T Scales at Royston.\n\nThe rest of the employed population were generally in agriculture, or a service trade. There were cordwainers, wheelwrights, blacksmiths, quarriers, carters, shop-keepers, victuallers, and butchers listed in the censuses. From earlier records we know that sheep had been important and there is record of a mill and extensive woodland within and outside of the township associated with the manor. Storrs Wood and Storrs Mill which was situated in the wood, were tenanted by the Lord of the Manor of Cudworth, although they belonged to the Manor of Darfield.\n\nA well known historian of the southern West Riding said to me that he was sure that when the Turnpike trusts were set up they were unlikely to spend money on building new roads, but rather they would merely make the existing ones reasonably sound. I used the Cudworth experience to refute that simple assertion, although I did appreciate that the evidence was not always easy to come by.\n\nCudworth was directly affected by two separate Turnpike Road Acts of Parliament, the first linked Cudworth and Barnsley and the second went through Cudworth and on to cross the Doncaster to Redhouse Turnpike at Ackworth Moor Top before continuing to join yet another Turnpike just to the south of Pontefract, which was the intended destination for the Barnsley to Pontefract road. The 1825 Act was the classic case of what I meant. The text describes how the road from Barnsley to Cudworth Small Bridge was to be turnpiked; it listed the trustees, several of whom were Cudworth men, it authorised the erection of toll gates and bars and it authorised the collection of tolls. What it failed to mention was that it was almost an entirely new road, although it does hint at it.\n\nThe traditional road from Barnsley to Cudworth was out along the Old Mill Lane towards Wakefield, past the modern junction with Harborough Hill and up to the lane that led up Burton Bank to Monk Bretton. It went along the lane between where the Norman public house and the church now stand and turned right down the hill towards Cudworth by passing along to where the Cudworth Fire Station now stands. It then passed over the Cudworth Small Dike Bridge (where the railway bridge was later to be erected over) and onto what we now know as Barnsley Road.\n\nThe problem with this route was the steepness of the gradient up to and down from the heights of Monk Bretton village. The promoters wanted a route that would reduce the gradient to make it easier for horse-drawn coaches. You can imagine the scenes in foul weather on an unmade Burton road up the incline of Burton Bank where the passengers would have been forced to alight and even to help turn the wheels on the coach to help them gain traction for the horses to effectively do their job.\n\nThe route selected was already in some senses being ‘developed’, the canal system was already changing the landscape between Barnsley and Cudworth along the side of which the new road was built. The junction that we know today as Cundy Cross simply did not exist as highway. The old road from Rotherham via Wombwell and Stairfoot to Wakefield crossed the river Dearne by the Priory and turned to pass through the Priory gates and up along Littleworth Lane to Monk Bretton. From there it descended down towards the Smithies.\n\nThe 1825 Act brought the road from Barnsley from Cheapside along what we now call the Pontefract Road. This road was built by the Turnpike trust and went past Beevor Hole, as it states in the Act. I can say that it was built, because since this was a relatively late Turnpike trust, it has the advantage that available cartography of the area is good for the period before 1825, and a road did not exist there, nor was there a road through Lundwood, because before the turnpike road, Lund Wood was simply that, a wood. Littleworth was a small hamlet within the parish between the village of Monk Bretton and the Priory, there was no ‘village’ of Lundwood.\n\nThis new road came to the Small Dike Bridge at Cudworth, the boundary for the township and manor, and that was where the trust’s authority ended. They sited a toll bar and side gate on the Monk Bretton side of the dike roughly halfway between the modern bridge and the roundabout. That then was the effect of the 1825 Act. The 1833 Act extended the authority of the Trust from the toll bar at Cudworth Small Bridge all the way to the junction with the other Turnpike at Ackworth Moor Top. This meant that the modern Barnsley Road and Pontefract Road in Barnsley were now no longer maintained by the parish.\n\nVery little road building was associated with the Cudworth section of this extended turnpike road, but there was just one diversion. The Knowles Quarry had probably already been exhausted, but as you can see from the rock faces alongside the houses almost opposite Manor road, the quarry once extended into what is now the Barnsley Road. This had anciently created a bit of a kink in the Barnsley to Pontefract road (a highway which had been of immense local importance throughout the mediaeval period). The road went along what is today called Manor Road and joined what is now St John’s Road before getting back onto the line of the road we see today. There is another example of a road through an exhausted quarry made around this time over in Royston. Station road in Royston goes through the site of a significant quarry and could not have existed as a highway in the mediaeval period.\n\nThis helps to explain a couple of things that puzzled me. First, Manor Road was previously called Barnsley Lane, and it was not clear why, but as the main lane to Barnsley it becomes very clear why. It also explains to some extent why the Manor was so far off the beaten track within the village, in terms of communicating with the outside world. In fact it was not, the manor’s demesne was bounded by Barnsley Lane, and whilst the Manor House would have been set back from it, the Manor’s home farm was right there. It also goes some way to explain why White Cross Road was Highway. It was not a part of an early rat-run but a fundamental link in the highways through Cudworth.\n\nPart of the fascination to me of studying the history of Cudworth is that the place and field-names that I have gathered together represent the whole linguistic history of this place. I have scoured countless primary and secondary sources looking for the evidence of these names. I have then tried to locate their geographical position from references in charters, plans or other references.\n\nUsing a range of reference sources including accredited British academic sources such as the Institute for place-names at Nottingham University and the many published works about the etymology of place-names, I have constructed a local gazetteer. In this work I realised that some respected texts contain uncertain references, even Smith’s work on the place-names of South-West Yorkshire from 1961. There is a very good reason for this of course, and it is nothing to do with my superiority in the subject – because I have nothing like the depth of knowledge of some of these academics. My advantage is that I am studying a very small and well defined area, and have a good repository of sources to call upon. In the case of Smith, he speculates (and he clearly states that he is speculating) about some names such as Belle Green. In that case, for example, he suggests two alternative possibilities for the name. My broader study of Cudworth has revealed the evidence that confirms just one of these alternatives.\n\nConscious of the rich linguistic heritage that is enveloped within the etymology of Cudworth, I have also armed myself with dictionaries for Old English (OE) (the language of the Anglians or Anglo-Saxons), of Icelandic and Faroese, being two living languages that have close ties with Old Norse (ON – by which I include old Danish also, since the Danish place-name institute in Copenhagen have chosen to do so). I have a Welsh dictionary (several in fact since my grandmother was Welsh and I inherited them!), as the Brythonic tongue is a close relative of the native speech used before, during and after the Roman occupation (the natives did not all speak Latin in everyday conversation, anymore than the Cudworthians of the time of the Domesday were speaking Norman-French). I regret that I have never tracked down an effective Old Frisian dictionary, since that would be even closer to ON, that remains a work in progress.\n\nI shall not go into the field and other names right now, but I shall presently produce a document for these pages.\n\nWhat I shall do here is to look at the origins of the name Cudworth itself. This is where it is as well to remember that names are not fixed in stone, they can and do change. By this I do not just mean that the spelling changes, but the names actually alter completely over time. In this case I suspect that the name is older than the manor and township, which are just a tad more than nine hundred and twenty-five years old; whereas the name I believe must date from the period between the seventh and ninth century of the current era (CE).\n\nMy reasoning is essentially linguistic and therefore must be open to challenge, but it is difficult for me to imagine a different history. Names are generally conferred on places by those in power. An existing name may continue but often it will be recorded phonetically using words that are meaningful in the native tongue of the scribe concerned. Just look at the evolution of the name of York, and the meanings of the similar sounding names applied by each succeeding administration. In the case of Cudworth, the generally accepted etymology is based on OE. The Anglians were the power in the land for a period of perhaps no more than two to three hundred years. The preceding Brythonic speakers would not have named a place except in their tongue, and would hardly have used the syntax of the Anglians, and would have been even less likely to incorporate an Anglian personal name. The onset of the Danelaw period, with the overthrow of the Anglian Northumbrian kingdom, was the catalyst for the ubiquitous ON influence. It is during this period that the -thorpes and the -bys along with the Carrs, the Storrs and the Ings arrived. They were, it seems to me, unlikely to create or recognise a new name from the tongue of the defeated nation, although they might continue to use an established one and to Norsify it!\n\nSmith, Gorman and most other commentators, but not all, agree that the etymology of the word Cudworth is a personal name for a person called Cutha (Cuða) with the suffix worth. Both elements are Anglo-Saxon. Worth is the difficulty, since Cutha (Cuða) was a common enough personal name to be accepted as just that. Worth by contrast has more than one meaning in OE. That favoured by the majority is that by which a worth is an enclosure. What the Norse or Danish may have called a Toft. There is also the possibility that it relates to an aspect of Anglo-Saxon law, in which it was essential that the value, or worth, of a person was understood by the community as a whole since in the event of either their testimony, or the geld payment to be made to their family in the case of death caused by another was valued.\n\nAll men were not equal, although they had equal rights in accessing justice as it was then understood. A cottar may not be valued as much, for example, as a Thegn; if both were witnesses in a case against another and their testimony disagreed, then the Thegn’s opinion would be worth more. In the event that a Thegn killed a cottar without judicial cause, then the Thegn would be just as likely to be found guilty than if the roles were reversed. The difference being how much would be paid in the judicial compensation that the law demanded for men of these different values. So, worth in the context of value is an extremely important concept that was readily understood in that period of history.\n\nOn balance I think that I tend towards the opinion of Mr Gorman and others, but I believe that it is an argument that will never be absolutely settled.\n\nThat being said, this means we have arrived at the idea that the origins of Cudworth dates from somewhere between the seventh and late ninth century, or, what must remain a possibility, Cutha(Cuða) was an Anglo-Saxon settler in the post-Danelaw settlement between the unification of the kingdom of England and the Norman Conquest – a period when the OE language once more regained the ascendancy. Yet, the name is not mentioned in Domesday survey, whereas neighbouring Carlton, Shafton and Brierley are. The fact that it was not yet a manor or taxable entity does not mean that a farmstead did not exist which in previous generations had belonged to someone called Cutha and whose name it continued to bear. It probably means that Cutha’s Worth was part of a neighbouring holding that had not yet been separated. I believe this to be additional evidence for the date of the creation of the manor, which is supported by other facts. I shall discuss this more fully when I get on to the origins of the manor. For this current discussion, suffice it to say that the name is almost certainly far older than the manor, whichever period you take in preference from the discussion, because the manor of Cudworth was a Norman creation.\n\n1Highways and Ways of Cudworth before 1840 Legend to accompany the map ______ Those drawn lines within the outer boundary are highways, by-ways, or drift-ways. 1 These numbers identify the highways and by-ways – refer to the table below for their names, cross-referenced with the modern names where they still exist. Upper Names of the two settlement nuclei of the Township of Cudworth. North Names of the great open fields and the other principal areas that formed the township. Huzzle Names of some individual fields or closes within the former open fields. Pond Names for some of the key features and buildings of the township. Names of the Highways and the By-Ways (see definitions below)\n\n1840 name Modern name\n\n1 Barnsley to Pontefract Turnpike Trust Road Barnsley Road and Pontefract Road\n\nThis was one of the two principal highways through Cudworth. It was an important road throughout the mediaeval period. The Barnsley to Cudworth Small Bridge Turnpike was created by an Act of 1825; as a result the road through Lundwood was created. Prior to this the ancient highway went up Littleworth Lane through Monk Bretton and back down Burton Lane before arriving at Cudworth Small Bridge. The Turnpiking of the road from Cudworth Small Bridge to Pontefract was enabled by an Act of 1833. See also Packhorse route. At the most easterly end of this road within the township it forms the southern of the two ways that gave the name to Shafton Two Gates.\n\n2 Snydale Lane Snydale Road\n\nIt is possible that this lane, which was legally a Highway, took its name from the village of Snydale between Featherstone and Normanton. It is, however, also possible that it took its name from the family called Snydall who owned land here. Richard Snydall was a tenant-at-will, meaning that he was a free tenant of the manor in settled occupation of Manorial land, and is recorded in the Manorial Court record of 1643. The Snydall family probably came originally from Snydale.\n\n3 Moor Lane Darfield Road\n\nThe land to the east of this lane, also legally Highway, was part of a moor whose remnants are recorded in modern names such as Moorland Terrace and Ferry Moor. In 1840, five of the closes along its eastern flank were called Moor Close.\n\n4 Common Lane Darfield Road and Storrs Mill Lane\n\nThis part of the Highway ran across the Common lands of Cudworth Manor. The name changed at Storrs Mill Bridge when the way passed out of the Township of Cudworth into the Township and Parish of Darfield. The mill was an important part of the Manor of Cudworth, although it was situated on the south bank of the Dearne.\n\n5 Pen Hill Lane end lost under former colliery waste tip\n\nThis was a by-way that came off of Coal Pit Lane. Its name relates to the fields in which it passes. The etymology of the fields is speculated by Smith (1961, p281), and others, as being a “nook of land worth a penny”. This was based on a fourteenth century reference to the purchase of pieces of the Lord’s waste for anything from 1d to 8d.\n\n6 Tofts Lane, later Royston Lane Royston Road\n\nThis Highway ran through the Tofts and formed part of the route to Royston when travelling by horse, wagon or cart; as such it was an important local route because it was the pedestrian route from Upper Cudworth and the carriage route from anywhere in Cudworth to the Parish Church. The Guide stoop found on Sid Cop being used as a gate- post dated 1738 would almost certainly have originally been sited at the junction of Tofts lane and the Barnsley to Pontefract highway where it also joins the Sidcop Lane.\n\n7 Three Nooks Lane Albert Street\n\nThere is a Three Nooks Lane in existence today but this was a part of old Weetshaw lane and runs across the older Three Nooks Lane. This original Three Nooks Lane was not highway but a linking drift way, enabling easier access to the fields on Killey Greave and the eastern side of Catwell and the Tofts and a direct foot route to Shafton Green; a footpath continued across Weetshaw to Shafton.\n\n8 Weetshaw Lane Weetshaw Lane\n\nTaking its name from that part of the old North Field called Weetshaw, which it crosses; this highway formed the northern arm of the junction that gave rise to the name of Shafton Two Gates and is part of the lane linking Cudworth, Shafton and Brierley with Carlton, and onwards to Penistone via Smithies. The North Field Laithe, or barn, was on the northern side of this lane; this was one of the two great barns of the manor, the other being the Tithe Laithe on the northern side of the Barnsley to Pontefract road. Weetshaw is probably the location of the oldest settlement within Cudworth, an overspill of the farming community that was centred upon Shafton, around the modern High Street, from a period of at least as far back as the Iron Age, possibly the Bronze or Mesolithic periods.\n\n9 Salter’s Gate Lane Shaw Lane\n\nThe Salter’s Brook was the ancient boundary between the parish of Penistone on the far western edge of the modern day Metropolitan Borough of Barnsley and the ancient county of Cheshire. There is a record of a Salter named Robert de Roreston living and working in Cudworth. He is listed as liable for the Poll Tax in 1379 is with his wife Agnes. Salter’s Gate Lane is a tautology. The word gate is attributable to the Old Norse gata meaning way, or in the modern sense, road. Lane is another word for road arising from old English. Therefore Salter’s Gate Lane might be interpreted as Salter’s road road! This lane was legally Highway.\n\n10 Downend Hill Lane no longer accessible\n\nThis Highway was the continuation of Tofts Lane across the junction with Weetshaw Lane and Salter’s Gate Lane and therefore served as part of s church way for Cudworth, leading as it did to the parish church at Royston. The stone or guide-post that was recorded as having stood here is most likely the stoop mentioned above, which will be described separately. This road perhaps ought to have been closed from the 1880s when the first of the Hull, Barnsley and West Riding Junction and Dock Acts was passed in Parliament. The resultant railway cut off the old route before the Great Boulder or Kirk Bridge could be reached from Cudworth and an alternative route crossed the new railways along Salter’s Gate Lane, before turning north on the newly created Boulder Bridge Lane . There is evidence that the railway workers continued to use Downend Hill Lane as their route to work right through to relatively recent times (before the railway yards were closed). This had always been an important route since it was along this lane that all, pedestrian, mounted and carriage traffic passed from Cudworth to the parish church in Royston. The Tofts lane route serving Upper Cudworth and the footpaths from Low Cudworth converged at the junction of this lane and Weetshaw Lane. The two fields crossed before reaching Great Boulder Bridge, or Kirk Bridge as it was also known, were called Woodcock Walker and Kirk Bridge Close. The footpaths leading up from Low Cudworth generally followed the lower ground between plateau of Sid Cop to the east and the Kirk Balk and Ings in the west. The Kirk Balk and Kirk Bridge appellations suggest the importance of the connection with the route to church, and in the case of the Balk, the origins of that path.\n\n11 Sidcop Lane Sidcop Road\n\nSidcop Lane was not a Highway, indeed its status today is just as it was in 1840, with the southern end from its junction with Tofts Lane (now Royston Road) and the Barnsley to Pontefract Turnpike Trust Road (now Barnsley Road). Once past the Tofts in the east the lane became a footway, which it remains today. It passed across the eastern side of the high area known as Sid Cop, hence its own name.\n\n12 Barnsley Lane Manor Road\n\nThis short lane was part of the original Barnsley to Pontefract route. The section of the modern Barnsley Road between the junction of Manor Lane and St John’s Road was constructed as highway as part of the turnpiking of the Barnsley to Pontefract road after the passing of the Barnsley to Cudworth Bridge Road Act 1833, which extended the effect of the 1825 Act to bring the turnpike through Cudworth.\n\n13 Low Town Lane sometimes Maltkiln Lane St John’s Road and Lunn Road\n\nThis lane was Highway, but it was important locally in any case. It was the most direct route from the centre of the Manor to Upper Cudworth to the principal holdings of the early Lords of the Manor near Pontefract. The precise definition of the points marking the start and finish of each named part is difficult to assess. Certainly Low Town Lane ran from where the Star Inn stands to the junction with Carr Lane during at least some of the nineteenth century and probably thought the preceding centuries. It is clear that the name Maltkiln Lane was applied to at least a part of this lane, near to the malt kiln, but whether that section was also simultaneously called Low Town Lane is not clear. It is unclear also whether Carr Lane or White Cross Road were once part of Low Town Lane. It is clear that St John’s Road could not have predated the church dedicated to St John and the establishment in 1893 of the District Chapelry, but the naming of St John’s Road may have been in celebration of achieving full parish status in 1911. There was wholesale development that included the demolition of the old Manor House and the building of the New Town estate in the early 1920s. These changes, along with the removal of the Manor House and the malt kiln and other features may have been the catalyst for name change; it certainly marked a serious decline in the importance of this lane since it had become merely a residential dormitory area with little or no direct employment. White Cross Road is dealt with below.\n\n14 Jenny Lane Jenny Lane\n\nThis is not a Highway, but probably a by-way that developed along part of a more ancient pathway. Mr Gorman in his book ‘Cutha’s Worth’ described this lane as a favoured route by the monks of Monk Bretton Priory going about their business in the Priory’s various holdings in Cudworth and Brierley/Grimethorpe. It leads up onto the High Royd, which as the name suggests is a high point. Whether the monks found it useful is unknown, indeed it is the monks of Nostell that are recorded as having had an interest in at least part of the High Royd to which Jenny Lane leads. The lane is not on any logical mediaeval route between the Priory at Lund and Cudworth or Brierley. I think, however, that Mr Gorman is perfectly correct in inferring the great antiquity of what I believe is a drift way and a convenient foot route between the centre of the manor and Upper Cudworth and the pond.\n\n15 Low Green Low Cudworth or Cudworth Green\n\nLow Green is named for Cudworth Green, the village green for Cudworth. This was not the small triangle of grass that is visible today (pictured on the ‘About’ page of this blog), indeed that triangle was formerly part of a plot of land associated with the neighbouring plot to the north. The Green itself was a number of later enclosed field plots running along the north-eastern side of Carrs Lane, south of the modern ‘green’ and bounded in the east by the parallel lane which is today called Low Cudworth. Cudworth Green stretched as far as the modern Sunny Bank Drive.\n\n16 Carrs Lane Carrs Lane\n\nThis lane is probably the least changed in modern times, excepting the bungalows built towards Low Cudworth. It was not Highway, but a drift lane leading to a number of holdings including the various Lund Closes and Ring Farm, previously the Pine Close and Croft. It leads directly to the Carrs, the marshy areas adjacent to the Cudworth Dike at a low point along the natural valley. A Carr is a Scandinavian influenced word meaning marshy ground. This was never a Highway.\n\n17 Intake Lane Intake Lane\n\nShown on later Victorian Ordnance Survey sheets as Tentake Lane, its name is taken from the fact that at least some of the land through which it passes, at the southern end of the Old Field was land more recently taken under the plough. This is a name with Scandinavian influences, derived from Intak meaning newly enclosed plough-lands. This was not a highway.\n\n18 Belle (or Bell) Green Lane (and Belle Green) Belle Green Lane\n\nAn intriguing name which Smith (1961) gives as possibly being a family name or referring to fields that provided income for the maintenance of church bells. In this case it is surely the former, since the Belle family were ubiquitous in Cudworth from at least as early as 1290 and through to at least 1379. Through marriage they were also linked to other Cudworth land-holding families including the de Pul’s (also Pull), the de Birkthwaites (and other spellings), the de Cudworth’s (probably the originators of many of the families now bearing the surname of Cudworth, especially those who own land in Oxspring, Thurlstone, and other parts of Yorkshire). This was not a highway.\n\n19 Ibbots Lane Ibbots Lane (sometimes Tippit Lane)\n\nThis lane, which was not a highway, probably took its name from the field-names Ibbots that once formed part of the South Field. Great Ibbots and Ibbots were both fields that bordered the Broad Ing across which the paths leading to Ferry Moor and Brierley came together. How the name Ibbots comes about is less certain, but there was a family called Ibbotson in Cudworth in the early nineteenth century, so there is no reason to think that a family named Ibbot may have held these plots for an extended period.\n\n20 Coal Pit Lane Coal Pit Lane\n\nA drift lane that served a large number of enclosures within the South Field leading to two of the three fields called Coal Pit Close and another known as Low Coal Pit Close. These lanes, the subsidiary lanes of which probably also had separate names, were not Highway, but must have been immensely important given the access that they provided to a substantial area of good quality fields that, unlike the lanes through the North Field, led nowhere else.\n\n21 Crown Lane (now partly) Crown Avenue\n\nThis drift way was probably named because these were Crown lands. Cudworth had parcels of land within them that were owned by the Monarch at that time, either by right of the Crown or by their right as the Duke of Lancaster.\n\n22 Deep Carr Lane Deep Carr Lane\n\nAnother lane with a fairly obvious nomenclature; the lane through the Deep Carr. This was not highway, and in modern times was partly absorbed by the neighbouring colliery.\n\n23 Byath or Byard’s Lane No longer exists\n\nThis lane no longer exists. It formerly ran from Snydale Road at the point that is today the car park entrance for the Dorothy Hyman Stadium. It was once not merely a lane or track but opened up into a field then known as Horse Ing and was a part of Belle Green. This divided field was adjacent to Byard Yard, which is the old name for the field into which Belle Green Lane terminated. The name derives from a fourteenth century land-holding family, of whom three generations are mentioned in a variety of charters and deeds from 1324- 1361 with Richard and his wife Avice Byard or Bierd, through their son Thomas, between 1342 and 1363, and finally with his son Richard with his wife Elena in 1379. The field to the north of Byath Lane was Burfit Gate Close, which in the post-war period was turned into playing fields with a pavilion. The fields to the south, Little and Low Gilbert Royd, were later added to the parcel that incorporated the old playing fields to become the Dorothy Hyman Stadium. This lane was not highway. The name Byath Lane appeared on Ordnance Survey maps until the 1962 edition.\n\n24 lane not named on maps until 1906 White Cross Road\n\nPossibly regarded as being part of Low Town Lane\n\nThis lane formed part of the route through Low Cudworth, past the manor house from the Snydale and Moor Lanes to Low Cudworth Lane (or Low Town Lane) and Barnsley Lane. The 1906 edition of the County Survey was the first published to show the name White Cross Road, so it was probably named by the then new Urban District Council. White Cross is derived from the farm which occupied a significant part of the south-eastern quarter of the road, some building remnants of which still exist (if no longer in their original position). That the lane is ancient is not disputed; the pinfold stood on an island in the middle of the junction with what had been Snydale Lane and Moor Lane (Snydale Road and Darfield Road in 2014). Alongside this pinfold there was once a stoop, on which the mileage and for Doncaster, Wakefield and Barnsley were shown with the appropriate mileages. This indicates that the lane was highway and a recognised link to Barnsley Lane. Understanding about the re-routing of the Barnsley-Pontefract road in 1833 makes greater sense of the importance of this road than its current place in the road network suggests.\n\nDefinitions:\n\nBy-way: In the modern context this refers to any small track, path or road that is not simply a defined footpath or bridle-way. In the mediaeval and earlier modern sense it was any sort of ‘road’ that was not maintained by statute labour or under the jurisdiction of the annually appointed ‘surveyor of the highway’ in a parish.\n\nChurch way: This term describes the principle routes to the parish church from any settlement. In the case of Cudworth, until the nineteenth century the parish church was in Royston and in consequence of that there were ‘church-ways’ serving both Low and Upper Cudworth. Tofts Lane (now Royston Road) was the main road to the church by means other than on foot. There was a path leading from near Cudworth Small Bridge by the Knowles, heading north parallel to Sid Cop to join with Tofts lane at its junction with Weetshaw Lane and Downend Hill Lane. Parts of this path follow a balk, this being a raised boundary between ‘furlongs’ or the plough lands of individual tenants in the great fields. The ridge of these balks became paths, since they were raised and therefore drier and easy to navigate. It is inferred that this part of the township west of Sidcop was therefore a part of the great open North Field.\n\nBy way: This term is applied to ways that essentially led just to enclosures, crofts, tofts, quarries, pits and other economic activities, but that they did not necessarily go anywhere else.\n\nHighway: Any ‘road’ designated as highway was maintained under statute by the parish through which it passed under the supervision of a ‘surveyor of the highways’ appointed annually. The Justices were empowered under the 1555 Highways Act and many subsequent Acts, to levy a rate to pay for the maintenance of the highways, and of bridges. Every parishioner was liable for the rate and also for providing physical labour along with tools. Initially this labour was for four days annually but was later extended to six, with an option for the surveyor to demand more. These rules were particularly onerous in parishes where very heavily used highways passed through. This was one of the primary drivers that gave rise to the idea of the turnpiked road in the seventeenth century. Highways were specifically routes to market towns or ports or where there were specific military or administrative demands.\n\nLane: This is a common word used to describe some lesser roads. It has Anglo-Saxon origins Lanu.\n\nRoad: The word road is a modern concept. Shakespeare is recorded as having written it just once in his compendium of works and it has never fully replaced the older term of ‘way’. Even in current legislation it is the term ‘Highways Act’ that is commonly used. The legal acronym BOAT, meaning a by-way open to all traffic or restricted by-ways (only introduced to the British legal lexicon in 2000); the term right-of-way, these are examples of current usage of the ancient. The labelling of our streets, lanes and roads is still termed way marking.\n\nFarrer W, (1916), Early Yorkshire Charters, Ballantyne, Hanson, Edinburgh Gorman K F and Gorman C, (2007), Cutha’s Worth, The social and local history of Cudworth, Gorman and Gorman, Barnsley Smith A H, (1961) Lower and Upper Strafforth and Staincross, part 1 of The place-names of the West Riding of Yorkshire, Volume 37 of the series; English place-name society, Cambridge University Press"
