        "text": "The fact that Asda is a Yorkshire creation is not particularly well known. What is even less well known is that its origins lie in the Wakefield five towns area.\n\nAsda, the colossal supermarket chain now owned by the American company Walmart, has its roots in two local West Yorkshire families, the Asquiths and the Stockdales.\n\nThe Asquith family were Knottingley based butchers in the 1920’s; their sons, Peter and Fred Asquith, the soon-to-become to become co-founders of Asda, opened their first store in Pontefract in 1958. Allegedly, this first store was located on Pontefract’s Horse Fair (approximately where the British Heart Foundation Furniture & Electrical shop currently stands). Though this initial store was not yet operating under the Asda name, it was the first in the line of a handful of stores set up by the brothers in Pontefract and surrounding Castleford, Edlington, and South Elmsall.\n\nAt the same period in which the Asquith family were operating, the Stockdale family were in business as dairy farmers in the West Riding area (now formally part of West Yorkshire). In 1949 Arthur Stockdale became managing director of Associated Dairies and Farm Stores Ltd.\n\nIn what was to be a successful partnership, on the 3rd of May 1965 the Asquith brothers merged their butchery and supermarket business with the Stockdale-run Associated Dairies, and a new company was formed: Asda – a combination of Asquith and Dairies. Following this merger stores opened in Wakefield and Leeds. By 1967 Asda was also operating stores in the town of Billingham, Teesside (which is, amazingly, still in operation).\n\nToday, with its headquarters in Leeds, Asda can be seen as still heeding its Yorkshire roots. In 2006, Peter Asquith, then 79 years of age, opened the Pontefract Asda on Halfpenny Lane by cutting a 15ft piece of liquorice at the inaugural ceremony. Speaking to the local newspaper, the Pontefract and Castleford Express, Peter Asquith said, “We are really excited at the prospect of bringing Asda back to where everything started. I’ve always lived within 20 miles of Pontefract, and the town is still very important to me.”\n\nIn 1999 Asda was subject to a £6.7 billion takeover by American retail corporation Walmart. As well as selling the same manner of goods as its founding families did over half a century ago, namely meat & dairy products, Asda now also offers a huge range of wares including clothes, fuel, a mobile phone network, financial services, and electrical goods.\n\nSo, next time you step foot in an Asda store in the Wakefield five towns area, remember that it’s more local thank you think.\n\n[This short article was originally written for use by The Pontefract Heritage group and has been adapted here for use by Thomas de Pontefract]\n\nHidden within the tower of All Saints Church, Pontefract exists a particularly special architectural curiosity: a double helix staircase.\n\nIf you’ve never heard of this local architectural treasure don’t be surprised, it’s one of only a handful of such staircases throughout the entire world. There are two in the United Kingdom: one in All Saints Church, Pontefract, and the other in St Ethilda’s Church, Tamworth, Staffordshire.\n\nIt is made up of two sets of stairs, both of which wrap around the same stone newel (the stem, to the layperson). The two sets of stairs have their own separate entrances and exits and from a design point of view resemble the strands of a DNA molecule, hence the name.\n\nTwo of the most notable examples of the double helix staircase are to be found within the Vatican Museums, Vatican City State and the Chateau de Chambard in France. The original name given to these intriguing staircases is the Bramante staircase, in honour of Donato Bramante, who created the designs in 1505. Of course, the renaming of the Bramante staircase to the double helix is undoubtedly a modern addition, the double helix model of DNA only being discovered in 1953 by molecular biologist Francis Crick.\n\nIt seems that the idea driving the design of the double helix staircase is functionality: the need to utilise as much space as possible within a limited area, not to mention enabling traffic to pass uninterrupted up and down stairs. It is therefore no great surprise to find double helix staircases most often used in church bell towers and other similar structures, such as the square tower of Belvedere Palace, Rome; and the Pozzo di San Patrizio (St. Patrick’s Well), Italy. Clearly, the staircases appear to be deployed most where space is often greatly constricted. The staircase in All Saints Church, Pontefract is certainly built for a narrow space – up to the bell ringing chambers high within the tower.\n\n[This short article was originally written for use by The Pontefract Heritage group and has been adapted here for use by Thomas de Pontefract]\n\nPeople of Pontefract – it may interest you to know that our town is the setting of a popular poem by Sir John Betjeman, a former Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom. Betjeman’s lively and folksy poem, The Licorice Fields at Pontefract, highly deserving of a place in Pontefract’s rich cultural tapestry, portrays some key features of the town: the history of manual labour, the pealing of the church bells, and of course, liquorice.\n\nJohn Betjeman (1906-1984), born near Highgate, North London, was a pupil at the illustrious Highgate School and was a student of another literary great, T.S Elliot. A few years later, as an undergraduate at Oxford University, he was an acquaintance of York-born poet, W.H Auden, and a student of the acclaimed Christian philosopher, C.S Lewis. Clearly, during the formative stages of his life, Betjeman was in contact with the world of arts and literature. After leaving university without a degree, Betjeman was to become a popular figure in the world of the arts, writing a great volume of poetry, including the excellent Diary of a Church Mouse, which is one of the nation’s best-loved poems. He also penned a number of books on the subject of architecture, which was one of his great passions (Betjeman was one of the founding members of The Victorian Society, an organisation that sought to preserve a selection of Britain’s most beautiful Victorian buildings, such as the Clayton Hospital in Wakefield). As well as being a successful author, Betjeman also excelled in broadcasting, presenting a number of programmes on British architecture, including one concerning the city of Leeds; yet, despite Betjeman’s varied array of interests and talents, it was to be his characteristically frugal and humorous verse that won him his widest audience and would cement his reputation as an important British cultural figure. Betjeman became Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom in 1972, a post held by other revered poets such as Alfred Lord Tennyson, William Wordsworth, Ted Hughes, and Carol Anne Duffy (who holds the post as of 2016). The fact that such a talented poet turned his eye to Pontefract is of great local interest and is surely something worth celebrating, perhaps with a heritage plaque featuring excerpts of the poem somewhere in Pontefract town centre.\n\nThe Licorice Fields at Pontefract is highly reminiscent of W.B. Yeats’ Down by the Salley Gardens; except Betjeman’s verse is infused with a bawdiness that gives life and virility to the poem, setting it apart from Yeats’ more sombre work. Notice Betjeman’s curious rendering of liquorice as ‘licorice’ also, which seems to be a quirk of his own making.\n\nThough it is not certain that Betjeman ever visited Pontefract himself, it does appear that he had an awareness of the town’s liquorice heritage and even a little knowledge about the town’s buildings, though he, rather oddly, fails to include coal mining, which is (or was) as prominent a pillar of Pontefract life as anything else that he might have considered. What is most curious in Betjeman’s poem, however, is his description of the liquorice flowers, which are described as “dangling”, when in fact liquorice flowers stand sturdy and erect. Even so, the description of the flowers on the liquorice bush is trivial when taken into consideration along with the overall poem. Indeed, the “blooming liquorice bushes” serve only as props, giving context to the piece; it is the “red haired”, “golden skinned” woman, with her “sulky lips” and “sturdy legs” that is given as the main focus. This lady amongst the ‘licorice’ bushes is a strong and stalwart ‘Northern lass’ who has clearly captured the heart of the poem’s narrator.\n\nIf you’d like to hear an audio recording of John Betjeman reading Licorice Fields, click on the following link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5tNpQZV0jQ. Of course, Betjeman being the highly productive man that he was, even released an album, Late Flowering Love, in 1974, which features The Licorice Fields at Pontefract as a track, complete with Sgt Pepper-style instrumentation accompanying Betjeman as he recites his verse. To hear this very 1970’s version, click on the following link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5tNpQZV0jQ.\n\nAs a final note, it would be very interesting to hear The Licorice Fields at Pontefract recited in Pontefract’s local dialect rather than Betjeman’s BBC accent, perhaps it would lend an air of authenticity to the poem.\n\nHere’s the poem’s opening stanza:\n\nIn the licorice fields at Pontefract\n\nMy love and I did meet\n\nAnd many a burdened licorice bush\n\nWas blooming round our feet;\n\nRed hair she had and golden skin,\n\nHer sulky lips were shaped for sin,\n\nHer sturdy legs were flannel-slack’d\n\nThe strongest legs in Pontefract.\n\n[This article was originally written for The Pontefract Heritage Group and has been adapted for Thomas de Pontefract.]\n\nCharles Dickens’ Bleak House is a mansion of novel, its staggering array of floors, rooms, and secondary staircases lead you to become wilfully lost within it. It is a novel that, taken at surface value alone, can simply be enjoyed like a soap drama, a Victorian style East Enders, if you will. However, if on the other hand, you care to peer deeper into the self-sufficient world of Bleak House and step through its crooked alleyways and paupers’ graveyards, there’s no end to the analogies to be drawn from its 989 pages. It is one of the few novels that I have read that gives the impression of being all encompassing. Its domain overshadows complex themes such as law, family, parenthood, disease, charity, birth, marriage, death, and much, much more. You could probably build a university degree course on the book alone, there’s that much you can read into it.\n\nThe genius behind Bleak House (written in the vintage year of 1852) is that all events, big and small, revolve around the central axis of the Jarndyce and Jarndyce case taking place in the Court of Chancery. Jarndyce and Jarndyce is an inheritance dispute that has been going on for so long and has become so pedantically complex that absolutely no one knows what’s going with it anymore, yet it sucks in and chews up all those around it like an indifferent black hole.\n\nBleak House is a gloomy novel, you get the impression that there is a shroud of muck and soot hanging over every page. This theme is present from the very beginning, in the now-famous opening scenes of a literally and symbolically fog besmirched London. Much of the novel’s atmosphere is reminiscent of Pip’s wanderings in the misty Kent marshes in Dicken’s earlier novel, Great Expectations. It is perfect for reading on a dark, cold winter’s night. If you’re well acquainted with the Holborn and Chancery Lane areas of London, then the scenes that take place there in Bleak House can be doubly engaging, but, if you’ve never had the misfortune of visiting London, Dickens does a grand job of transporting you there anyway. The Court of Chancery and the bafflingly intricate case of Jarndyce and Jarndyce reminds me of Franz Kafka’s The Trial and his other novel, The Castle, where K, the main protagonist, is faced with a shape-shifting maze of bureaucracy and frustration that acts as fuel for the engine of the novel.\n\nI have to admit that there was the odd occasion when reading this book when I found myself counting the pages until the next chapter or plot development, but that could’ve been my own weak-willed attention span. It only takes a moment’s glance to recognise that Bleak House is a big book; it can be a bit over facing at times, or at least that was my experience of it. It’s probable that the story was much easier to digest when it was first published and serialized in its 20 monthly installments, back in 1852, then it really would have been like experiencing a soap drama unfold like the ones on television today. Dingles with top-hats and a Southern twang.\n\nThere are over 70 characters in Bleak House, with around 20 of them being considered ‘major’ players in the dominant plot line. My favourite character by far was Jo the lowly street sweeper, one of my most beloved characters of all time. In Jo’s character Dickens portrays those at lowest socio-economic order of society, those who are abused, used, and discarded on a whim; Jo is homeless, hopelessly poor and uneducated, but his heart is made of gold, his personality shines right through his sodden rags and the muck on his bare, calloused feet. The character who I disliked most of all was Mr. Skimpole, a man who puts on childish airs and shirks all responsibility with regards to money and adult issues, often tricking more kindhearted characters into paying his debts for him and footing his bills. He’s a frustrating fellow, I couldn’t see the funny side of his whimsy. I think that a lot of the characters that populate the world of Bleak House are more caricatures than real people, their idiosyncrasies are exaggerated, which of course is a helpful way of ensuring that they are memorable, especially considering how many characters appear throughout the book. Though by the same token, you never get ‘beneath the skin’ of the characters, apart from perhaps the main protagonist Esther, never get a sense of their inner workings; some of them come across as more cardboard cut-outs, 2-D figures rather than full-bodied and full-blooded people. Though I suppose there has to be some compromise between character development and volume of characters. I found a similar problem with Dumas’ The Count of Monte Cristo, another big book serialized in 1842, roughly ten years before the publication of Bleak House. Dumas, like Dickens, populates Monte Cristo with a great many characters, some very memorable, such as Abbe Faria, Dantes’ cell mate and oracle in Chateau d’If; whilst others seem mere manikins for the plot to dress and subsequently dismantle, mere kindling for Edmond Dantes’ long-planned revenge.\n\nThe narrative style of Bleak House dances back on forth from chapters written in diary style from the pen of Esther Summerson, the chief protagonist, to chapters from the perspective of an omniscient 3rd person narrator. I am aware that this flitting back and forth between narrative voices has drawn criticism from some readers, but for me it added a welcome element of variety to the book, a nice change of pace to the story.\n\nIf you do choose to read this novel, I’d advise you keep a piece of paper and pen handy to make notes of the characters, subplots and plot developments, because they might get a little jumbled if you don’t stick to a regular reading routine. It took me about a month to read, with a little reading, chipping away at it almost every day. Either way, Bleak House is not a book you can cream off in an afternoon. That much is for certain.\n\nWe can credit Michel de Montaigne with the creation of the modern essay as we know it. In his Essays, first published in 1568, Montaigne engages in a number of ‘essais’ (meaning ‘trials’ or ‘attempts’) in which he seeks to test his mettle on an eclectic variety of subjects, including the glitteringly bizarre Of Cannibalism and Of the Custom of Wearing Clothes to the sobering Of the Education of Children and Of Cruelty.\n\nTaken as a whole, Montaigne’s essays combine to form a unique style of autobiography, the manner of which reminds me of the way the human eye views a painting – not through registering the painting as a full piece in itself straight off, but by building up an overall picture form various bits and pieces until the whole is accounted for. Indeed, one of Montaigne’s chief purposes behind writing his Essays was to leave behind a time capsule of sorts containing his thoughts and opinions through which his family and friends could remember him, warts and all.\n\nThrough his frequent digressions and wanderings off trail, which, by the way, add splashes of colour to some of the more austere aspects of his essays, Montaigne invites us to share in his enlightening anecdotes and notable personal experiences, each culminating towards a portrait of the author that is unbound from the chronology of time and is instead depicted simply through his ideas, opinions and remembrances.\n\nI took up Montaigne’s Essays bracing myself for an encounter with a chain of creaky and slow going pages, but pages from which I thought I might learn something worthwhile. It turned out that I was only half wrong. From very early on, particularly his essay Of the Power of the Imagination, Montaigne set me at ease with his frank and easy manner, even musing on subjects that are largely unspoken of even today. In Imagination Montaigne spends a page or two talking about how our imaginations can cause our bodies to enact things that are physically or psychologically harmful to us, he goes on to give us an example of one his acquaintances having reoccurring bouts of erectile dysfunction stemming from one bad experience in bed. To me, this passage came quite out of the blue, considering that I expected this book, written by an eminent 16th French landowner and courtier, to be overtly scholarly and conservative. Such was my misconception of Montaigne.\n\nSoon enough, Montaigne starts to become a familiar voice and face (which he describes in Of Presumption); and you quickly come to acknowledge that his goal of leaving a time capsule for his family and friends to remember him by has succeeded beyond all measure. You come to think that you yourself could be friends with Montaigne, have a pint with him, chat about the world; that is if you weren’t too occupied being driven out of town by the plague that was ravaging Europe at the time.\n\nThe fact that Essays is still read and enjoyed almost half a millennium after its first publication gives high commendation to the talents of Montaigne. If you’re looking for some time-honoured nuggets of wisdom or are perhaps more interested in learning about life (albeit of a socially privileged and luxurious kind) of one man in France in the 16th century, then Montaigne is as good a place as any to start."
