        "text": "Jonathan Mackman\n\nI completed my DPhil in medieval history at the University of York in 1999, my thesis focussing on the local gentry community of fifteenth-century Lincolnshire and their involvement in the Wars of the Roses. Since then, I have spent my entire career working in the world of historical and archival research, partly as an independent researcher, but mainly on various research and cataloguing projects, for universities across the country.\n\nMy research posts have mainly focussed on records at The National Archives in Kew, including such things as cataloguing the vast series of taxation returns in series E 179 and the medieval petitions in series SC 8, and examining the use of the central law courts by fifteenth-century Londoners. I have also contributed to the publication of records such as the Henry III Fine Rolls and the Gascon Rolls, and also researched the careers of fifteenth-century Yorkshire MPs for the History of Parliament. Most recently, however, I was the Research Fellow on the University of York’s ground-breaking ‘England’s Immigrants’ project, which examined the nature and extent of immigration into England between 1300 and 1550. This involved producing a huge on-line database and a website of resources, co-authoring a variety of publications, and even giving a presentation to BALH’s Local History Day in 2013!\n\nAs an independent researcher, I range extremely widely, and have worked on many interesting and satisfying cases, from all periods of history. These have included such things as transcribing early building accounts from Hampton Court Palace, and researching the histories of a medieval London town-house and a London leper hospital, but I even once spent a few weeks tracing the ownership of a Victorian tea set!\n\nI have published various articles over the years, often relating to my various research posts, but I am particularly interested in the local history of Yorkshire, Lincolnshire and the East Midlands. As a new Trustee of BALH, I am especially keen to increase links between local and academic historians, sharing knowledge and experience across disciplines, increasing the accessibility and awareness of archives, and encouraging more people to take an interest in local history in all its forms.\n\nJonathan Mackman, Trustee"
