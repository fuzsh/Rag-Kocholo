        "text": "Following on from last week's introduction to the vast St Pancras and Islington Cemetery, in today's post I explore some of the well-known people who have been buried here since its opening as Britain's first public cemetery in 1854.\n\nMathilde Blind (1841-1896) was born Mathilde Cohen in Germany but sought refuge in London after her stepfather, Karl Blind was involved in the Baden insurrection of 1848. In England she grew up around European refugees and revolutionaries, including Giuseppe Mazinni. Her brother, Ferdinand, committed suicide after failing to assassinate Otto von Bismark. Her political upbringing manifested itself in her poems, and she frequently tackled the subject of social injustice, including her attack on the Highland Clearances, 'The Heather on Fire'(1886). This monument to Blind (see below) was erected by the industrialist Ludwig Mond and features her likeness along with Greco-Romanesque images now partially obscured by ivy.\n\nA close friend of Blind was Ford Madox Brown (1821-1893), a painter associated with the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood through his tutorship of the young Dante Gabriel Rosetti. He is perhaps most celebrated for the murals of Manchester history that he painted in the city's Town Hall. Brown's grandson and namesake was the novelist Ford Madox Ford.\n\nOne of the most striking monuments in the cemetery is that of 50 year old William French who drowned 13 July 1896 while rescuing a dog in Highgate Ponds on Hampstead Heath. Little is known of French but The Morning Post of Wednesday, July 15, 1896 (p. 8) described him as a 'stableman'. The inscription on the stone reveals that the monument, known as the 'Highgate Dog', was paid for with money raised from fellow animal lovers: 'all classes of lovers of dumb animals'. French was originally buried in a pauper's grave, but moved to a 'first class' plot at the request of the Victorian writer and bon vivant George R. Sims (Berrow's Worcester Journal, Saturday, July 25, 1896). As is clear by the good condition of the ribbon and flower in this photograph, French's grave continues to receive regular visits.\n\nNot far from William French's grave is that of another hero - Irish cavalryman, John Hickey. Alfred Tennyson's poem, Charge of the Light Brigade, vividly recalls the fated attack by more than 600 British light cavalry on Russian forces during the Battle of Balaclava in October 1854. Like many other survivors of the Crimean War, Hickey was poorly treated by the British government and quickly fell to poverty. He ended his days in the squalor and degredation of St Pancras Union Workhouse. His stone reads:\n\nIn remembrance of John Hickey.\n\nOne of the 4th Light Dragoon Guards.\n\nDied May 30th 1896, aged 65 years.\n\nThis stone was erected by a few admirers to mark the last resting place of a brave man.\n\nOne of this group of admirers was the novelist Jerome K Jerome.\n\nSadly there is no headstone of the grave of another military hero, Victoria Cross awardee, Valentine Bambrick (1837-1864). Bambrick received the VC after being attacked at Bareilly in 1858 during the Indian Mutiny. Three years later, in London, Bambrick was convicted of assault and theft of a comrade's medals. He was thus stripped of his own medal and sent to Pentonville Prison, Whilst there, the stricken Bambrick killed himself. He was then buried in a pauper's grave. Perhaps one of the only momentoes of his death is this record found on the Deceased Online database of 25 year old Bambrick's burial in the cemetery at Finchley on 8 April 1864. A memorial plaque was belatedly erected to him in St Pancras and Islington Cemetery in 2002.\n\nAmong the many celebrated entertainers buried in the cemetery are:\n\nthe composer of 'La Varsoviana' (Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay), Henri d'Alcorn (born George Henry Stannard Allcorn; 1827-1905)\n\nthe Lyceum Clown, Harry Gardner (1871-1917)\n\ndance band leader who was killed during the Blitz in the Cafe de Paris, Ken 'Snakehips' Johnson (1914-1941)\n\nOther well-known burials in the cemetery include:\n\nCora 'Belle Elmore' Crippen (d. 1910), murdered wife of the notorious Dr. Harvey Crippen\n\nKingsley Amis (1922-1995), novelist and critic\n\nDame Anna Maria Crump (1850-1921), first Mayoress of Islington\n\nSir William Crump (1850-1923), first Mayor of Islington\n\nAndrew Fisher (1862-1928), Prime Minister of Australia\n\nGeorge Cuvier 'The Boy' Spencer (d. 1916), introduced the velocipede to England\n\nJohn Baptista De Manio (1874-1913), aviation pioneer and father of broadcaster Jack De Manio\n\nAre you aware of any other celebrated people in the St Pancras and Islington Cemetery?

Please let us know via the Comments Box below or on our Twitter and Facebook pages!\n\nLabels\n\nDeceased Online has just uploaded around 114,000 burial records from Spa Fields in the modern London borough of Islington Spa Fields today, with the Church of Our Most Holy Redeemer in the background Spa Fields Burial Ground became notorious in the 19th century for its overcrowded and insanitary conditions. Located in the parish of St James, Clerkenwell, the grave yard was not far from the ever-increasing City of London. Spa Fields was known also as Clerkenwell Fields and Ducking-pond Fields in the late 18th century, hinting at a dark side to what was then a summer evening resort for north Londoners. What would become a cemetery was a ducking pond in the rural grounds of a Spa Fields public house. It was here in 1683 that six children were drowned while playing on the ice. In his History of Clerkenwell (1865) William J. Pinks wrote that visitors, \"came hither to witness the rude sports that were in vogue a century ago, such as duck-hunting, prize-fighting, bull-baiting\n\nFollowing on from last week's post, I'm looking further into Deceased Online 's latest collection of burials. These military burials were digitized in partnership with The National Archives . Two notable institutions in the collection are Haslar Royal Navy Cemetery and the Royal Victoria Hospital in Netley. Both Haslar and Netley (as it was more commonly known) were Britain's foremost military hospitals during the bloodiest years of war in the western hemisphere The Royal Hospital Haslar and Clayhill Royal Navy Cemetery, Gosport, Hampshire The Royal Hospital Haslar dates from 1753. For over two hundred and fifty years Haslar served as one of main hospitals caring for sailors and marines of the Royal Navy and merchant services. Patients came from ships as well as from naval and seamen institutions in nearby Portsmouth and Gosport. The hospital closed as the last official military hospital in 2007. The Haslar Cemetery closed in April 1859 but the neighbouring Cl\n\nRecords for both crematoria in Wakefield, Yorkshire have been added to the Deceased Online database Above: Pontefract Crematorium The two sets of crematoria records have been added to Deceased Online 's Wakefield Collection . Wakefield district contains nineteen cemeteries and two crematoria. Many of the records go back to the mid and late 19th century when the cemeteries opened, and range across a wide geographical area. The full list of Wakefield cemeteries live on Deceased Online, with opening dates in brackets, is as follows: 1. Altofts Cemetery – Church Road, Altofts, Normanton (1878) 2. Alverthorpe Cemetery – St Paul’s Drive, Alverthorpe, Wakefield (registers from 1955) 3. Castleford Cemetery – Headfield Road, Castleford (1857) 4. Crigglestone Cemetery – Standbridge Lane, Crigglestone, Wakefield (1882) 5. Featherstone Cemetery – Cutsyke Road, North Featherstone (1874) 6. Ferrybridge Cemetery – Pontefract Road, Ferrybridge, P"
