        "text": "TEXT\n\nWhen Josiah Quincy Junior began a new commonplace book in June 1770 he wanted to be sure that he collected his thoughts carefully. He recorded those thoughts in a light brown, leather-bound book 7 3/8 inches tall by 6 inches wide.1 For Quincy as for other Patriots like John Adams and John Dickinson, maxims were self-evident truths, axiomatic expressions of the incontestable. They had served a similar purpose for John Locke and, before him, for Francis Bacon. Quincy’s first few entries, taken from Bacon, Baron Bielfield and David Hume, were reminders about the need for meticulous study and due consideration. Quincy copied passages into the commonplace book over a four-year stretch and turned to those excerpts when shaping his arguments for the Patriot cause. He filled in blank pages and went back to earlier entries to squeeze in another quote or paraphrase, or to refer himself to other thoughts on other pages.\n\nQuincy did not move chronologically through his sources, from the classics to more recent writers, nor did he proceed in thematic order, exhausting one subject before addressing the next.2 At first glance there may not appear to be a pattern to his note taking. But there is. It is detectable in his underlinings, cross-references, interjections, index, and, most especially, in the topical headings that he recorded to the left of most entries. Readers who run their eyes down those columns, as Quincy himself might have done while preparing his essays, will see the same words and phrases again and again: power and corruption, princes and tyranny, standing armies and militia, the duty of rulers and need for political virtue, submission and the right of resistance, representative government and freedom, Quincy’s condensed Latin phrase “Obsta Prin.”3—to be resolute from the beginning, and even “NB”—for nota bene, or to note well.\n\nIt is here that we also see the ideological underpinnings of Quincy’s political creed: not in a single source or from a particular era, not drawn from one tradition of thought but compiled from many. When Quincy warned of the danger of standing armies he quoted from Edward Montagu, a contemporary Englishman who studied the ancient republics, and from Thomas Gordon’s discourses on Sallust and Tacitus that focused so intently on Caesar’s Rome. He quoted, too, from William Robertson’s histories—both of Scotland and of Charles V, from Catharine Macaulay on seventeenth-century England, and from members of the British House of Commons in the 1740s who inveighed against tyranny in their own age by adverting to antiquity. When warning against complacency and trusting government too much, Quincy quoted as readily from Plutarch on Athens and Rome as he did Arthur Young on Great Britain in the 1770s.\n\nTo read the commonplace book is to enter Josiah Quincy’s political world. I have therefore kept editorial intrusions to a minimum, with the following exceptions. Entries that Quincy squeezed into the margins I moved to the body of the text and marked with a superscript §. Quincy often wrote the runic thorn “ye” for “the” and “yt” for “that,” a shorthand that I changed to the more familiar forms. I altered “comon” to “common” for the same reason. Where Quincy abbreviated, I expanded to full length. I also substituted “and” whenever Quincy used “&.” Those few words that Quincy habitually misspelled (such as reversing the ie in “chief” and writing “president” for “precedent”) or misconstructed (writing the contraction “it’s” when he should have used the possessive pronoun “its”) I corrected. Quincy’s underlined passages are italicized throughout. Otherwise, I changed very little and did not aim for perfect consistency: readers will encounter “publick,” as Quincy and some of his sources spelled it, as well as “public,” the spelling in other sources.\n\nQuincy sometimes paraphrased passages and quite often underlined words or phrases that were not highlighted in the original, and he capitalized as he felt inclined. I let all of that stand, since my purpose is to allow readers to see what was important to Quincy, not reproduce the source as he found it. Even if he started in the middle of a passage I thought it best not to insert the rest of that sentence. Quincy occasionally interjected comments. They, of course, have no source citations and usually took the form of a one line “Query.” I have marked with [Quincy] those few places where there might otherwise have been confusion about authorship. All of the topical headings in the margins are Quincy’s, as are the scattered cross-references to other pages in the text. The numbers in parentheses are for the original pages of the commonplace book. Quincy placed them at the outer top corner of each page; I have moved them to the center and bottom.\n\nTo assist the reader in finding Quincy’s sources, I clarified and standardized the citations at the end of each entry. Quincy made his entries for himself, not a future generation, and his citations could be fairly cryptic. For example, he drew heavily from David Hume’s Essays but he did not identify which ones. He just listed the page numbers for the 1758 edition from which he quoted and to which he could easily return. I have inserted the essay titles so that readers who only have access to later editions can find the relevant passages. Similarly, I included various individuals and dates for parliamentary debates that Quincy left out. All source references are in a short title form of my devising. Full bibliographical information can be found in the next chapter. In those few instances where Quincy was off by a page or two in his citations I made the correction silently. Volume and page numbers in brackets refer to editions that I used when the originals were unavailable or, despite my digging, simply could not be identified. In a few places Quincy gave no page numbers; those are also the places where he was most likely to paraphrase, perhaps because he worked from memory. In those instances the bracketed numbers to modern editions show what passages he might have had in mind when he made his entry.\n\nQuincy copied a long excerpt from John Dickinson’s 1774 Essay on constitutional power in the British empire and placed it at the end of aphorisms he had gleaned from Francis Bacon’s Advancement of Learning. He also copied passages out of Daines Barrington’s Observations on English law and inserted them as the last entry in the commonplace book. Quincy probably put Barrington’s passages there because of a shortage of space in the section ended at p. 234; the Dickinson passage is considerably longer than the other entries in the aphorism section. I moved both, so that the Dickinson excerpts, which appear on pp. 266, 268, and 272 in Quincy’s numbering,4 now follow the entries that end on p. 234. The Barrington excerpts follow those from Dickinson. Thematically, both fit better with this material.\n\nQuincy left pp. 235–236 blank. From pp. 237–272 he entered “Antitheta Rerum” (in essence, the pro and con of things), which were excerpts that he copied out of Bacon’s Advancement of Learning.5 Bacon worked through nearly fifty subject areas, such as pride, praise, and knowledge, giving the positive and negative side to each. Just as Bacon worried that commonplace books could devolve into collections of empty platitudes—anthologies giving the appearance rather than the substance of great learning, he worried that his readers would copy his words without improving their understanding. Quincy understood that fear. He only copied eleven of the categories and he did not give all of the same examples included by Bacon. He also added three of his own categories: flattery, antiquity, and precedents. A handful of the entries in this section appear to have been made by Josiah the Mayor years later, showing that he made use of his father’s jottings (see pp. 250, 255 and 260).\n\nQuincy made no entries between pp. 273–299 and 304–329. Beginning on p. 330, he added an index that continued for thirty-one unnumbered pages, which I have included. Page numbers there refer to the commonplace book pages in parentheses, not the numbers at the top of each page.\n\n***\n\nThe first quality that is necessary to a disputant, is reason, and the next, moderation; in what manner soever the contest is conducted, these two qualities should constantly be manifest during the whole course of Altercation. Bielfield, Universal Erudition, 1:60.\n\n(i)\n\nCrafty men contemn studies, simple men admire them, and wise men use them.8 Read not to contradict and confute, nor to believe, and take for granted, nor to find talk and discourse—but to weigh and consider. Bacon, “Of Studies,” Essays, [12:252].\n\nSuch an infinite superiority do the pursuits of literature possess above every other human occupation, that even he, who attains but a mediocrity in them, deserves the pre-eminence above those who excell the most in the common and vulgar professions. Hume, History, James I [5:132].\n\nThere is no method of reasoning more common, and yet none more blameable, than in philosophical debates, to endeavour the refutation of any hypothesis, by a pretext of its dangerous consequences to religion and morality. When any opinion leads into absurdities, ’tis certainly false; but ’tis not certain that an opinion is false, because ’tis of dangerous consequence. Such topics, therefore, ought\n\n(ii)\n\nto be entirely forborne; as serving nothing to the discovery of truth, but only to make the person of an antagonist odious. Hume, “Of Liberty and Necessity,” Essays, p. 336.\n\nEach Profession has a peculiar vice and dangerous inconvenience attached to it. Voltaire, Pupil of Nature, p. 170.\n\n(iii)\n\n“Corruption will never want a pretence.” Cato the Younger (of Utica) Langhorne, Plutarch’s Lives, 5:59.§\n\nand a fondness for diversions, in times of affluence and peace, will assume the specious names of politeness, taste and magnificence. Corruption will put on different masks. In the corruptors it will be termed able management, encouraging the friends of the administration, and cementing a mutual harmony, and mutual dependance between the three different states of the government. In the corrupted, it will be denominated loyalty, attachment to the govern-\n\n(1)\n\nment, and prudence in providing for one’s own family. In such times, these evils will gain a fresh accession of strength from their very effects; because corruption will occasion a greater circulation of the publick money; and the dissipations of luxury, by promoting trade, will gild over private vices with the plausible appearance of publick benefits. Montagu, Antient Republicks, p. 145.\n\nNo despotick government can ever subsist without the support of that instrument of tyranny and oppression, a standing army. For all illegal power must ever be supported by the same means by which it was at first acquired. Ibid., p. 153.\n\nAlways agreeable to the views of arbitrary princes. Macaulay, History, 2:163.§\n\nPhilosophy lays this down as a fundamental and incontestable maxim, that all the most flourishing states owed\n\n(2)\n\ntheir ruin, sooner or later, to the effects of luxury; and all history, from the origin of mankind, confirms this truth by the evidence of facts to the highest degree of demonstration. Montagu, Antient Republicks, p. 221.\n\nProceeding, therefore, upon the constant maxim of all tyrants, that idleness in the people is the parent of sedition, Tarquin exhausted them so much by the slavish drudgery, in which he kept them constantly employed at the publick works, that—from different causes—neither patricians, nor plebians, endeavoured to put a period to the common Calamities. Ibid., p. 234.\n\nJustice is now called Faction. Macaulay, History, 1:4–5.§\n\nThis cant term, disaffection, is the watch word of faction; and the charge of disaffection, that constant resource of iniquitous ministers, that infallible sign, that a cause will not stand the test of a fair inquiry, will be\n\n(3)\n\nperpetually employed by the tools of power to silence those objections, which they want argument to answer. Montagu, Antient Republicks, p. 275.\n\nThere cannot be a stronger proof of a weak or a corrupt administration, than when indigent and necessitous men are appointed to the government of distant provinces, from no other motive, than party merit, and with no other view, than to raise a fortune at the expence of the people. Ibid., pp. 337–338.\n\nIgnorance, which judges by its feelings, is less subject to error, than the knowledge of the laws, which judges by opinion. Happy the nation, where the knowledge of the law is not a science! Beccaria, Essay, p. 53.\n\nThe Best heads are no judges in causes belonging to the jurisdiction of the heart. Critical Review, 1 (April 1756):222.\n\n(4)\n\nAll governments and societies of men do in progress of long time gather an irregularity, and wear away much of their primitive institution. And therefore the true wisdom of all ages hath been to review at fit periods, those errors, defects or excesses, that have insensibly crept on into the publick administration; to brush the dust of the wheels, and oyl them again, or if it be advisable to chuse a set of new ones. Marvell, Rehearsal Transpros’d, Part II, p. 191.\n\nThe common People in all places partake so much of sense and nature, that could they be imagined and contrived to be irrational, yet they would ferment and tumultuate at last for their own preservation. Yet neither do they want the use of reason, and perhaps their aggregated judgment discerns most truly the errors of government, for as much as they are the first to be sure, that smart under them. In this only they come to be short-sighted, that though they know the diseases, they understand not the remedies; and though good patients, they are ill physicians. Ibid., p. 193.\n\nThose who are underdecks, being at present unfit for higher employments, may perceive those leaks which will inevitably sink a weak and ill-compacted vessell. Remonstrance and petition to the Massachusetts Bay General Court, 1646; Hutchinson, Collection, p. 188.§\n\n(5)\n\nIt hath been an ancient complaint drawn down from the best and wisest times, even to our age, that States were too busie with their Laws and too negligent in point of Education. Bacon, Advancement of Learning, Book I [6:109].\n\nHe that cannot contract the light of his mind, as he doth the eye of his body, as well as disperse and dilate it, wants a great faculty for an active course of life. Ibid. [6:113].\n\n☞\n\nIt becomes not subjects by bent and inquisitive observations, to penetrate into the hearts of kings, which the scripture hath declared to be inscrutable. Ibid. [6:114] Strange doctrine from so great a man! [Quincy]\n\nLaws are the instruments and sinews of All blessings. A law ought to give warning before it strikes: and it is a good rule, That is the best law which gives least liberty to the arbitrage of the Judge. Ibid., Book VIII [9:313, 314].9\n\n(6)\n\n☞\n\nThere are times wherein too great virtues are exposed to certain ruin. Cites Tacitus, History. Ibid. [9:263].\n\nThe blessing of Judah and Issachar will never meet. That the same tribe or nation should be both the lionswhelp, and the Ass between burdens; neither will it be that a people overlaid with taxes, should ever become valiant, and martial. It is true, that taxes levied by publick consent of the estate do depress and abate men’s courage less; as a man may plainly see in the tributes of the Low-countries, which they call excises; and in some degree in those contributions which they call subsidies in England. For you must note that we speak now of the heart and not of the purse; so that although the same tribute conferred by consent or imposed by command, be all one to the purse, yet it works diversly upon the courage. Therefore set down this too as a principle,\n\n(7)\n\nthat no people overcharged with tribute is fit for empire. Ibid. [9:302].\n\nLet States and kingdoms that aim at Greatness by all means take heed how the Nobility and Grandees, and those which we call Gentlemen, multiply too fast; for that makes the common subject grow to be a Peasant and Base-swain driven out of heart, and in effect nothing else but the Nobleman’s bond slaves and labourers. Even as you may see in Coppice-wood, if you leave your staddles too thick, you shall never have clean underwood, but shrubs and bushes: So in a country, if the Nobility be too many, the Commons will be base and heartless, and you will bring it to this, that not the hundreth pole will be fit for an helmet; especially as to the Infantry, which is the nerve of an army; And so there will be great population and little strength. Ibid. [9:302–303].10\n\nSee Pym’s argument against Strafford in Macaulay, History, 2:434.§\n\n(8)\n\nThe dominion of the Romans, like that of all great Empires, degraded and debased the human species. Robertson, Charles V, 1:3.\n\nIf men do not enjoy the protection of regular government, together with the certainty of personal security which naturally flows from it; they never attempt to make progress in science, nor aim at attaining refinement in taste, or in manners. Ibid., 1:18.\n\nTo abandon usurped power, to renounce lucrative error, are sacrifices, which the virtue of individuals, has, on some occasions, offered to truth; but from any society of men, no such effort can be expected. The corruptions of society, recommended by common utility, and justified by universal practice, are viewed by its members, without shame or horror; and Reformation never proceeds from themselves, but is always forced upon them by some foreign hand. Robertson, Scotland, 1:167.\n\n(9)\n\nA small body of troops, maintained in constant pay, and rendered formidable by regular discipline, had checked the progress of a martial people, though animated with zeal both for religion and liberty. The smallest addition to their number, and a considerable was daily expected, might prove fatal to public liberty, and Scotland might be exposed to the danger of being reduced from an independent kingdom, to the mean condition of a province, annexed to the empire of its powerful ally. Ibid., 1:198.\n\nBy private solicitations and promises, she shook the ardor of some. By open reproach and accusation, she blasted the reputation, and diminished the authority of others. Her emissaries were every where at work, and not with- standing the zeal for religion and liberty, which then animated the nation, they seem to have laboured not without success. Ibid., 1:202.\n\n(10)\n\nStrangers to those forms, which protract business; unacquainted with the arts, which make a figure in debate; and much more fitted for action, than discourse; a warlike people always hasten to a conclusion, and bring their deliberations to the shortest issue. It was the work but of one day, to examine and resolve this nice question, concerning the behaviour of subjects towards a ruler who abuses his power. But however abrupt their proceedings may appear, they were not destitute of solemnity. As the determination of the point in doubt, was conceived to be no less the office of divines, than of laymen, the former were called to assist with their opinion. Knox and Willox appeared for the whole order, and pronounced, without hesitation, both from the precepts and examples in scripture, that it was lawfull for subjects not only to resist tyrannical princes, but deprive them of that\n\n(11)\n\nauthority, which, in their hands, becomes an instrument for destroying those, whom the Almighty ordained them to protect. Ibid., 1:204–205.\n\nSir William Cecil, the great minister of Queen Elizabeth, lays it down as a principle, agreeable to the Laws both of God and of nature, that every society hath a right to defend itself, not only from present dangers, but from such as may probably insue; to which, he adds, that nature and reason teach every Prince to defend himself by the same means, which his adversaries employ to distress him. Ibid., 1:217.\n\n☞\n\nIn political conduct, it is childish to wait till the designs of an enemy be ripe for execution. Ibid., 1:219.\n\n☞\n\nThe affection of subjects—the firmest foundation of a Prince’s power, and the only genuine source of his happiness and glory. Ibid., 1:268.\n\n(12)\n\nThis general doctrine of resistance—(to those soveriegns, who trespass against the duty which they owe to the people)—is just in its own nature, but delicate in its application to particular cases. See Ibid. 1:315.\n\n☞\n\nRizio discovered, in all his behaviour, that assuming insolence, with which unmerited prosperity inspires an ignoble mind. Ibid., 1:321.\n\nAll the miseries of civil war desolated the kingdom. Fellow-citizens, friends, brothers, took different sides, and ranged themselves under the standards of contending factions. In every county, and almost in every town and village, King’s-men and Queen’s-men were names of distinction. Political hatred dissolved all natural ties, and extinguished the reciprocal good will and confidence, which hold mankind together in society. Religious zeal mingled itself with these civil distinctions, and contributed not a little to heighten, and to inflame them. Ibid., 2:20.\n\n(13)\n\nExperience had taught them with what insinuating progress, the hierarchy advances, and though admitted at first with moderate authority, and under specious pretences, how rapidly it extends its dominion. “Varnish over this scheme, said one of the leading Clergymen, with what colours you please; deck the intruder with the utmost art; under all this disguise, I see the horns of his mitre.” Ibid., 2:243.\n\nCommerce tends to wear off those prejudices which maintain distinction and animosity between nations. It softens and polishes the manners of men. It unites them, by one of the strongest of all ties, the desire of supplying their mutual wants. It disposes them to peace, by establishing in every state an order of citizens bound by their interest to be the guardians of publick tranquility. As soon as the commercial spirit begins to acquire vigour, and to gain an ascendant in any society, we discover a\n\n(14)\n\nnew genius in its policy, its alliances, its wars, and its negociations. Conspicuous proofs of this occur in the history of the Italian States, of the Hanseatick league, and the cities of the Netherlands during the period under review. In proportion as commerce made its way into the different countries of Europe, they successively turned their attention to those Objects, and adopted those manners, which occupy and distinguish polished nations. Robertson, Charles V, 1:81–82.\n\nCharles the 7th of France, under pretence of keeping always on foot a force sufficient to defend the kingdom against any sudden invasion of the English, at the time when he disbanded his other troops, retained under arms a body of 9000 cavalry and of 16,000 infantry.—Charles the 7th, by establishing the first standing army known in Europe, occasioned an important revolution\n\n(15)\n\nin its affairs and policy.—France, by forming this body of regular troops, at a time when there was scarce a squadron or company kept in constant pay in any other part of Europe, acquired such advantages, either for attack or defence, over its neighbours, that self-preservation made it necessary to imitate its example. Mercenary troops were introduced into all the considerable kingdoms on the continent. They gradually became the only military force that was employed or trusted. It has long been the chief object of policy to increase and to support them, and the great aim of Princes or ministers to discredit and to annihilate all other means of national activity or defence. Ibid., 1:94–95.\n\n(16)\n\nSee Gordon, Tacitus, 1:9.§\n\nLouis (the eleventh of France) was formed by nature to be a tyrant; at whatever period he had been called to ascend the throne, his reign must have abounden with schemes to oppress his people, and to render his own power absolute. Subtle, unfeeling, cruel; a stranger to every principle of integrity, and regardless of decency, he scorned all the restraints which a sense of honour, or the desire of fame, impose even on ambitious men. Sagacious, at the same time, to discern his true interest, and influenced by that alone, he was capable of pursuing it with a persevering industry, and of adhering to it with a sytematic spirit, from which no object could divert, and no danger could deter him.—This—was the first monarch in Europe who discovered the method of managing those great assemblies, in which\n\n(17)\n\nthe feudal policy had vested the power of granting subsidies and of imposing taxes. He first taught other Princes the fatal art of beginning their attack on publick liberty, by corrupting the source from which it should flow. By exerting all his power and address in influencing the election of representatives, by bribing or overawing the members, and by various changes which he artfully made in the form of their deliberations, Louis acquired such entire direction of these assemblies, that, from being the vigilant guardians of the privileges and property of the people, he rendered them tamely subservient, in promoting the most odious measures of his reign. As no power remained to set bounds to his exactions, he not only continued all the taxes imposed by his father, but made\n\n(18)\n\nimmense additions to them, which amounted to a sum that appeared astonishing to his contemporaries.—During the course of a single reign, France was formed into one compact kingdom, and the steady unrelenting policy of Louis XI. not only subdued the haughty spirit of the feudal nobles, but established a species of government, scarce less absolute, or less terrible, than eastern despotism. Ibid., 1:97, 100–101.\n\nSee Talbot, French Nation, 1:285–286.§\n\nTo invite when it is improper to constrain, to lead when it is improper to command, is the highest point of ability. Reason has a natural, nay, it has even a tyrannical sway; it meets with resistance, but this very resistance forms its triumph; for after a short struggle it forces an intire submission. Montesquieu, Spirit of the Laws, 2:310 (Book 28, Chapter 38).\n\n(19)\n\nThe whole business and employment of princes consists in endeavouring to increase their power. Princes are not usually esteemed for their truth, justice and integrity, like other men, but for their power, and knowledge how to exert both force and fraud upon a happy conjuncture. De Witt, Political Maxims, pp. xxiii–xxiv.\n\nA natural love of Freedom, lies latent in the breast of every rational being, till stifled by prejudice, or extinguished by the sordid allurements of private interest. Macaulay, History, 1:v.\n\n☞\n\nIndividuals may err, but the public judgment is infallible. Ibid., 1:10.\n\n(20)\n\nThere is not a more certain mark of an ill-designing or impotent administration, than attempts to restrain the liberty of speaking or writing. Virtue in high places is sure to gain the universal plaudit of mankind. Ibid., 2:58n. q.v.\n\nThe civility of our laws tells us, that kings can do no wrong*; but the people are alone secure when the judges, their ministers, dare do none. Ibid., 2:400.\n\n*See the sense of this Law and maxim well explained in ibid., 4:268n–269n.§\n\nMr. Maynard, in his pleadings against Strafford, asserted, that treason against the person of the prince fell short of treasons he had committed*: one prince might be succeeded by another; but when law and justice were taken from the throne, and Will placed in their stead, there was no hope of remedy.—to incite a prince to tyrannical acts was a greater offence, than to kill him: he might do otherwise with a fair reputation. Ibid., 2:421.\n\n*Vizt.—Treason against the constitution and liberties of the Subject. See ibid., 2:423–428n.§\n\n(21)\n\nDependent parliaments, the greatest curse the nation, can, in a political sense, be afflicted with. Ibid., 2:461n–462n.\n\nA character of the highest estimation in its just sense: but in that exalted appellation*, nothing more is meant by the vulgar than being a proficient in the narrow circle of ministerial juggling—the abilities of a Scapin, to cheat the credulous and unwary! A knowledge in the extensive science of politics, the different constitutions of different societies, the just interests of nations, and the operative effect which political institutions have on the public weal, when united to a head and a heart capable of employing it to the real service of mankind, constitute the character of a great Statesman. Ibid., 2:463–464.\n\n(22)\n\nReviled as contemptible in number, and inconsiderable in fortune and reputation. Ibid., 3:326.\n\nLevellers—is an hackneyed term of reproach flung out on all occasions against the partisans of Liberty; both with a view to throw ridicule on their systems, as visionary and impracticable, and to engage the selfish affections of men in the cause of arbitrary and unequal dominion. The levelling plan, according to the insinuations of these scoffers, never was, nor ever can be adopted by men, who have accurate notions of a state of nature, or who are well informed in the science of government and the laws of society; for though the justice and wisdom of God has given equal and impartial privileges to the species in general, yet the difference which exists in the judgment, understanding, sagacity, genius and industry of individuals, creates superiority and inferiority of character, and produces a state of dependance from man to man. To preserve the natural subordination established by God himself and to keep that accumulation of property and influence\n\n(23)\n\nwhich the different qualities of men occasion, from producing tyranny, and infringing the general rights of the species, lies the whole art of true and just policy. All political distinctions which are personal, however wisely and impartially distributed, are mischievous in their nature, because they give weight instead of ballance to the preponderating scale: but heriditary privileges are the mere establishments of selfishness, and attended with the most destructive consequences; since necessarily counteracting the laws of Providence, the vicious and the foolish bear rule over the wise and virtuous, the system of nature is not regulated but overturned, and those are prepostorously placed at the head of society, whose qualities often intitle them to no other than the most inferior station in it. Ibid., 4:332n.\n\nLevellers—a brave and virtuous party. Ibid., 5:205n.\n\n(24)\n\nSubjection to a sovereign is but a return for protection to the people, that that being denied by the king (Charles the first) subjection ought to be withheld, and the kingdom settled without him. By Commissary [Henry] Ireton in Parliament. Ibid., 4:344.\n\nGovernment never can stand on better, never on firmer, never on more equitable grounds, than on its good behaviour. Just government will be felt, its advantages will be seen, its security will be fixed in the hearts of its subjects, not to be shaken by the fantastic or selfish ends of individuals. The experience of all times shews, that the people are with difficulty moved to assert their rights, even against the most obnoxious, the most oppressive tyrrannys. Ibid., 4:408–409.\n\n(25)\n\nDeformity never appears so shocking as when compared with perfect beauty. Thus a truly pious man is, by every instance of his visible conduct, exposing to reproach some one or other, and by consequence provoking their resentment. It is for this reason, that men discover such a proneness to disparage every profession of piety superior to their own. How common is it to ascribe every such appearance to weakness or hypocrisy. In the generality of wicked men this is not so properly malice, as self-defence. If they should allow the excellence of such a character, it would be condemning themselves out of their own mouths. Witherspoon, Essays, 1:196–197.\n\nThe charge of SEDITION and FACTION against good men accounted for. Ibid., 1:196.\n\nThere is a love of dominion natural to all men, which is under no controul or restraint in those who are void of religion. This must naturally dispose them to carry on their schemes, and insist on having them universally complied with. It frets and provokes them,\n\n(26)\n\ntherefore, to find any who will not be subservient to their pleasures. A refusal to obey on a principle of conscience, is expressly setting bounds to their authority, and saying, Hitherto shalt thou go, but no further. How few are able to bear this with patience, the history of the world in every age is one continued proof. Ibid., 1:202.\n\nNot only officers, courtiers, idle gentry, and soldiery, but also all those that would be such, knowing that under the worst government they use to fare best: because they hope that with impunity they may rifle and plunder the citizens and country people; and so by the corruption of the government inrich themselves, or attain to grandeur, they cry up monarchical government for their private interest, to the very heavens. De Witt, Political Maxims, p. 7.\n\n(27)\n\nWith regard to political virtues, prudence is the only source from whence they are all derived. Bielfield, Universal Erudition, 1:247.\n\nIt is usefull to mankind to make the science of general policy their serious study; as their understanding will thereby always become more enlightened. They ought not however to place too great confidence in this study: reason is the guide that they should constantly follow in the career of life. Ibid., 1:353–354.\n\nHappiness is the goal to which all human mortals press, and policy, in general, is the art of obtaining our end. Ibid., 1:354.\n\nGeneral policy is, in fact, the same as common prudence in the course of life: the art of conducting all our Actions in such a\n\n(28)\n\nmanner as to make them truly useful, and we may Add, so as to merit the approbation of the wise and good. Ibid., 1:355.\n\nIn a word, general policy is a rational theory, a complete course of science for the right conduct of life; that teaches us to guide our bark through a sea that is constantly agitated, and frequently tempestuous; that directs us so to pass through life, that we may live in this world with security and integrity, religiously and agreeably, and in expectation of that true felicity which the divine mercy has prepared for us in eternity. Ibid., 1:358.\n\n(29)\n\nHistory, being the faithfull depository of all the actions, good and bad, of the whole race of mankind, who have lived in all ages, and have performed any distinguished part on the theatre of the world, forms the most powerfull incentive to virtue, and preservative from vice. The most successfull usurper, the most absolute and cruel tyrant would not have his memory appear loaded with infamy in the eyes of posterity. To cover the iniquity of his enterprises, he accompanies them with manifestoes, and other memoirs of justification. But history here tells him, that his efforts are vain, that the time will come when his iniquity will be unvailed, and the secret folds of his heart laid open; when neither the arts of his worthless ministers, nor the eulogies of venal pens, will be able to defend him: that posterity will be his judge; and that the only method\n\n(30)\n\nof obtaining a favourable sentence, is by performing worthy actions: that true glory is never to be found but in real merit: that history flatters not: that it treats the wicked even with an inexorable severity; and that it pays no respect to scepters or diadems. Ibid., 3:71–72.\n\nCredulity is the source of most errors, as doubt is the beginning of wisdom. It is therefore allowable to entertain a rational pyrrhonism concerning the relations of most travellers, and it is of the last importance to make a judicious choice of such as we propose to read: for the first accounts of any country, or people, make the strongest impressions on our minds, and if they should be false or erroneous, it is almost impossible for Us totally to\n\n(31)\n\neradicate such impressions, but we shall continue to entertain these false ideas during the remainder of our lives. It is highly necessary, therefore, to be previously acquainted with the degree of reputation each writer of travels bears, for veracity, and for a judicious relation of facts. Ibid., 3:286–287.\n\nThe wretched state to which the Greeks are reduced by the Turks, renders them insolent, and, by a necessary consequence, ignorant. The policy of the Ottoman Porte does not permit its subjects to apply themselves to study; and that same spirit, which has destroyed the finest monuments of antiquity, which has made of columns of porphyry and granate, balls for their cannons, has caused the decadency and total destruction of the Sciences. Ibid., 3:341.\n\n(32)\n\nSince phylosophy has confined sorcery to the wardrobe of ancient reveries; and since wise legislators have prohibited the tribunals from exercising their powers against it, and priests from pretending to exorcisms; there is no longer to be found in the world either demon, sorcerer, witch, conjurer, or sabbat. Ibid., 3:395.\n\nThere are some usefull and respectable prejudices in the world, which a wise man and a good citizen will never publicly expose; and if any one is rash enough to attempt it, he is worthy of chastisement. Ibid., 3:401.\n\nThe man who confines himself to his closet is but rarely visited by the sciences, the arts and belles lettres. To acquire their intimate acquaintance he must seek them in those places where Minerva, Pallas,\n\n(33)\n\nApollo and the Muses, have fixed their residence. Emulation, that strong impulse in the career of all our pursuits, should constantly attend the man of letters from his early youth to the last period of his life; in the school, at college, at the university, in those employments to which his knowledge may lead him, or in those academies of science to which he may be admitted. Emulation is an animating faculty that results from society: and few there are to whom nature has given a genius sufficiently strong to attain an extensive erudition in solitude; who are provided with wings that can bear them, without guides, without models, without companions or supports, to the lofty regions of the empyrean. Ibid., 3:403–404.\n\n(34)\n\nA grand Vizier always finds himself, amongst the Turks, in a critical situation. He is intrusted with absolute power, but then he is responsible for the event. And if the success of his operations turns out contrary to the publick expectation, his head is cut off, or he is sent into exile; the merit of having projected well being always destroyed by the misfortune of not having succeeded. Laugier, Peace at Belgrade, p. 135.\n\nSpend no time (says Cardinal Fleury in his Letter to the Turkish Grand Vizier) in disputing who have been in the wrong; as the present juncture of affairs requires us to act rather than to reason—being truly desirous—of a solid pacification, we ought not take up time in examining which of the belligerent powers has been in the right or in the wrong; but only to consider on what conditions matters may be now settled. Ibid., pp. 137–138.\n\n(35)\n\n☞\n\nEach man (of Sparta) concluded that he was born, not for himself, but for his country. Langhorne, Plutarch’s Lives, 1:134 (Lycurgus).\n\nIt would have been easier (said that sage law giver, the wise Solon) for them (the Athenians) to repress the advances of tyranny, and prevent its establishment; but now it was established and grown to some height, it would be more glorious to demolish it. Ibid., 1:240 (Solon).\n\n☞\n\nIntrepid courage is the commencement of victory. Ibid., 1:291 (Themistocles).\n\nPericles considered that the freedom of entertainments takes away all distinction of office, and that dignity is but little consistent with familiarity. Ibid., 2:10 (Pericles).\n\n(36)\n\nIt is the same want of judgment and skill that sometimes produces too much confidence, and sometimes leaves too little. Ibid., 2:98 (Pericles and Fabius Maximus Compared).\n\nIt was a shrewd saying, whoever said it, “That the man who first ruined the Roman people, was he who first gave them treats and gratuities.” But this mischief crept secretly and gradually in. Ibid., 2:171 (Caius Marcius Coriolanus).\n\nGravity and mildness are the chief political virtues, and the fruits of reason and education. The man who applies himself to public business, and undertakes to converse with men, should, above all things, avoid that overbearing austerity, which (as Plato says) is always the companion of solitude, and cultivate in his heart the patience which some people so much deride. Ibid., 2:172 (Caius Marcius Coriolanus).\n\n(37)\n\nThe generality of men are more apt to resent a contemptuous word than an unjust action, and can bear any other injury better than disgrace. Ibid., 2:248 (Timoleon).\n\n☞\n\nNo man ever began his attempts against government with an enormous crime; and the relaxing in the smallest matters, breaks down the fences of the greatest. Ibid., 2:260 (Paulus Amelius).\n\nIt was the maxim of Alexander and Phillip—to procure empire with money, and not money by empire, and, pursuing that maxim, they conquered the world. For it was a common saying “that it was not Phillip, but Phillip’s gold, that took the cities of Greece.” Ibid., 2:272 (Paulus Amelius).\n\nThe art of governing cities and commonwealths is the chief excellence of man; and it is generally agreed, that the art of governing a family, is no small ingredient in that excellence. Ibid., 2:495 (Aristides and Cato the Censor Compared).\n\n(38)\n\nThere is a complaisance which pays attention to the great, and bears with easiness the pride of power, whenever private interest is concerned: this complaisance, however, is considered by some as no small part of politics. See Ibid., 3:173 (Lysander*).\n\n*An Impious Butcher—a double-minded hypocrite. There is naturally (says Archbishop Leighton) a Popeness in every man’s mind, and most in the shallowest; a kind of fancied Infallibility in themselves, which makes them contentious and pertinacious. Stronger spirits are usually more patient of contradiction, and less violent, especially in doubtfull things; and they that see farthest are least peremptory in their determinations. Leighton, Expository Works, 1:468.\n\nDivide and conquer is the maxim of Satan, and all his followers:—and therefore (says the same good Archbishop) let us hold that Counter-maxim, Union Invincible. Ibid., 1:470.\n\n(39)\n\nWhen the Argives had a dispute with Lysander about boundaries, and thought their plea better than that of the Lacedemonians, he showed them his sword, and said, “He that is master of this can best plead about boundaries.” Langhorne, Plutarch’s Lives, 3:198 (Lysander).\n\nCompare and consider!§ [Quincy]\n\nHow much happier would it have been for Cicero if he had retired after the affair of Catiline; and for Scipio, if he had furled his sails, when he had added Numantia to Carthage. For there is a period when we should bid adieu to political contests; these, as well as those of wrestlers, being absurd, when the strength and vigour of life is gone. Ibid., 3:357 (Lucullus).\n\n(40)\n\nThe multitude (says Plutarch) are afraid of those who despise them, and love to promote those who fear them; because in general the greatest honour they can hope to obtain is not to be despised by the great. Ibid., 3:374 (Nicias). But question of Plutarch’s meaning and see the whole passage. [Quincy]\n\nIn vain the glare of pomp proclaims me master; (sayd Agamemnon) I’m servant of the people. Ibid., 3:378 (Nicias).\n\nBut in seditions bad men rise to honour. Ibid., 3:388 (Nicias).\n\nThe worst of mortals may emerge to honour. Ibid., 4:297 (Alexander).\n\nHe who wants to stand at the helm, should not consider what may expose him to envy, but what is great and glorious. Ibid., 3:471 (Nicias and Crassus Compared).\n\n(41)\n\nIn a Commonwealth which retains any sentiments of virtue, he who has the lead, should not give place for a moment to persons of no principle; he should entrust no charge with those who want capacity, nor place any confidence in those who want honour. Ibid.\n\nThe great law-giver (Lycurgus) infused a spirit of ambition and contention into the Spartan constitution as an incentive to virtue, and wished always to see some difference and dispute among the good and virtuous. He thought that general complaisance, which leads men to yield to the next proposal, without exploring each other’s intentions, and without debating on the consequences, was an inert principle, and deserved not the name of harmony.—This point however must not be agreed without some exception; for violent dissentions are\n\n(42)\n\npernicious to a state and productive of the greatest danger. Ibid., 4:69–70 (Agesilaus).\n\nThe Mamertines who were seated in Messina refused to appear before the tribunal of Pompey and acknowledge his jurisdiction, alledging that they stood excused by an antient privilege granted them by the Romans. “Will you never have done (said Pompey) with citing laws and privileges to men who wear swords.” Ibid., 4:126 (Pompey).\n\nCompare and consider!§ [Quincy]\n\nIt is not always in the most distinguished achievements that men’s virtues or vices may be best discerned; but very often an action of small note, a short saying, or a jest*, shall distinguish a person’s real character, more than the greatest sieges, or the most important battles. Ibid., 4:223 (Alexander). See same sentiment in ibid., 5:83 (Cato the Younger).\n\n*Those finer and minuter traits, which characterize the man more than his most popular and splendid operations. Ibid., 4:403n.§ Translators’ note.\n\n(43)\n\nWhen the popularity of Caesar was grown to such a height that it was scarce possible to demolish it, and had a plain tendency to the ruin of the constitution, people found out, when it was too late, that no beginnings of things, however small, are to be neglected; because continuance makes them great; and the very contempt they are held in, gives them an opportunity to gain that strength which cannot be resisted. Ibid., 4:328–329 (Caesar).\n\nCicero seems to be the first who suspected something formidable from the flattering calm of Caesar’s political conduct, and saw deep and dangerous designs under the smiles of his benignity. “I perceive,” said the orator, “an inclination for tyranny in all he projects and executes.” Ibid.\n\n(44)\n\nOn the death of Caesar’s wife, the people sympathized with him—considered him as a man of great good nature, and one who had the social duties at heart. Ibid., 4:330 (Caesar).\n\nBut when Lutatius Catulus, a man of the greatest reputation in Rome rose and accused Caesar, he uses this memorable expression, “you no longer attack the Commonwealth by mines, but by open battery.” Ibid., 4:331 (Caesar).\n\n“The crafty policy of a man who aspires to be the tyrant of his country.” Macaulay, History, 5:78.§\n\nMetellus the tribune opposed Caesar’s taking money out of the public treasury, and alledged some laws against Caesar—who had an army at his heels—said, “Arms and laws do not flourish together. If you are not pleased with what I am about, you have nothing to do but to withdraw.\n\nCompare and consider!§ [Quincy]\n\n(45)\n\n“Indeed, war will not bear much liberty of speech. When I say this, I am departing from my own right: For you and all whom I have found exciting a spirit of faction against me, are at my disposal.” Saying this, he approached the doors of the treasury, and as the keys were not produced, he sent for his workmen to break them open. Langhorne, Plutarch’s Lives, 4:365 (Caesar).\n\n“Pompey (says Cato) holds it but one step from anarchy to Absolute Power.” Ibid., 5:91 (Cato the Younger)… This maxim has been verified in almost every state. Translators’ note, ibid.\n\nLacedamon shewed that It is impossible for fortune to conquer virtue. Ibid., 5:183 (Cleomenes).\n\n(46)\n\n“Private soldiers fight and die, to advance the wealth and luxury of the great; and they are called masters of the world, while they have not a foot of ground in their possession.” Speech of Tiberius Gracchus from the Rostrum, Ibid., 5:194 (Tiberius Graachus).\n\nA passion for fame has great power to efface the tinctures of philosophy; and infuse the passions of the vulgar into the minds of statesmen, who have a necessary connection and commerce with the multitude. Ibid., 5:308 (Cicero).\n\nCaesar (Octavius) Lepidus and Antony shewed (by their execrable treatment of the immortal Cicero) that no beast is more savage than man, when he is possessed of power equal to his passion. Ibid, 5:323 (Cicero).\n\n(47)\n\nIt is an observation no less just than common, that nothing makes so thorough a trial of a man’s disposition, as power and authority. For they awake every passion, and discover every latent vice. Ibid., 5:329 (Demosthenes and Cicero Compared).\n\nIt was a maxim of Plato, that the man who would be truly happy, should not study to enlarge his estate, but to contract his desires. For he who does not restrain his avarice, must forever be poor. Ibid., 5:365 (Demetrius).\n\nThe Macedonians looked for the protection of a king—but they found the insolence of a tyrant—For Demetrius disregarded their petitions. See ibid., 5:376 (Demetrius).\n\nAlas America—! Remind GEORGE, whom the world call thy king, that future Plutarchs will record his reign. [Quincy]\n\n(48)\n\nAn Old woman was one day troublesome to Demetrius in the street, and begged wth great importunity to be heard. He said, “he was not at leisure.” “Then” cried the Old Woman, “you should not be a king.” Ibid., 5:376 (Demetrius).\n\nThe complaisance which produces popularity, is the source of the greatest operations in Government—says Plato. See ibid., 6:7n (Dion), translators’ note.\n\nFear and force, and fleets and armies, are not, (says Dion speaking to Dionysius, the son of Dionysius the tyrant) as your father called them, the adamantine chains of government; but that attention, that affection, that respect, which justice and goodness forever draw after them. These are the milder, but the stronger bonds of government. Ibid., 6:9 (Dion).\n\n(49)\n\nThe city (Rome) was now (after the death of Julius Caesar) divided, into two factions: some joined Caesar, (Octavius) others remained with Antony,—And the Army was sold to the highest bidder. Ibid., 6:72 (Marcus Brutus).\n\n“On the ides of March (said Brutus to Cassius at their parting conference just before the battle of Philippi) I devoted my life to my country, and since that time I have lived in liberty and glory.”\n\n“Let us march then (replied the high spirited Cassius, embracing his beloved friend) against the enemy; for with these resolutions, though we should not conquer, we have nothing to fear.” Ibid., 6:88 (Marcus Brutus).\n\nNB. This reply of Cassius refers to the preceding part of the speech of Brutus. [Quincy]\n\n(50)\n\nGalba had the greatest integrity of heart: but in the court of Galba appeared all the extortions of Nero’s reign: and as the rapacity and other excesses of his ministers were imparted to him, Galba was no less hated than if he had committed them himself. Ibid., 6:213n (Galba).\n\nSee Gordon, Tacitus, 3:19, 35, 38, 79.\n\nOh Britain! What an instructive lesson for thy Sovereign. [Quincy]\n\nIn every human society, there is an effort continually tending to confer on one part the height of power and happiness, and to reduce the other to the extreme of weakness and misery. The intent of good laws is to oppose this effort, and& diffuse their influence universally, and equally. But men generally abandon the care of their most important concerns to the uncertain prudence, and direction of those, whose interest it is to reject the best, and wisest institutions; it is not till they have been led into a 1000 mistakes in matters the most essential to their liberties, and are weary of suffering, that &c. Beccaria, Crimes and Punishment, p. xi.\n\n(51)\n\nThe provinces of absolute monarchies are always better treated than those of free states. Compare the Pais conquis of France with Ireland, and you will be convinced of this truth; though the latter kingdom being, in a good measure, people from England, possesses so many rights and privileges as should naturally make it challenge better treatment than that of a conquered province. Corsica is also an obvious instance to the same purpose. Hume, “That Politics may be reduced to a Science,” Essays, p. 14.\n\nPolitical writers have established it as a maxim, that in contriving any system of government, and fixing the several checks and controuls of the constitution, every man ought to be supposed a knave, and to have no other end, in all his actions, but private interest.\n\n(52)\n\nBy this interest we must govern him, and, by means of it, make him co-operate to public good, notwithstanding his insatiable avarice and ambition. Without this, say they, we shall in vain boast of the advantages of any constitution and shall find, in the End, that we have no security for our liberties or possessions, except the good will of Our rulers; that is, we shall have no security at all.\n\n’Tis therefore a just political maxim, That every man must be supposed a knave; Though at the same time, it appears somewhat strange, that a maxim should be true in politicks, which is false in fact. But to satisfy us on this head, we may consider, that men are generally more honest in their private than in their public character, and will go greater lengths to serve a party, than when their own private interest is alone\n\n(53)\n\nconcerned. Honour is a great check upon mankind: But where a considerable body of men get together, this check is, in a great measure, removed; since a man is sure to be approved of by his own party, for what promotes the common interest, and he soon learns to despise the clamors of his adversaries. To which we may add, that every court or senate is determined by the majority; so that, if self-interest influences only the majority, (as it will always do) the whole senate follows the allurements of this seperate interest, and acts as if it contained not one member, who had any regard to public interest and liberty. Hume, “Of the Independency of Parliament,” ibid., p. 30.\n\nThe share of power allotted by our constitution to the house of Commons is so great, that it absolutely commands all the other parts of the government. The king’s legislative power is plainly no proper check to it. For though the king has a negative in the passing\n\n(54)\n\nof laws; yet this, in fact, is esteemed of so little moment, that whatever is voted by the two houses, is always sure to be passed into a law, and the royal assent is little better than mere form. The principal weight of the crown lies in the executive power. But besides that the executive power, in every government, is altogether subordinate to the legislative; besides this, I say, the exercise of this power requires an immense expence, and the commons have assumed to themselves the sole power of disposing the public money. How easy, therefore, would it be for that house to wrest from the crown all these powers, one after another, by making every grant of money conditional, and\n\n(55)\n\nchoosing their time so well, that their refusal of subsidies should only distress the government, without giving foreign powers any advantage over us? Did the house of Commons depend in the same manner on the king, and had none of its members any property but from his gift, would not he command all their resolutions, and be from that moment absolute?\n\nHow therefore shall we solve this Paradox? And by what means is this member of our constitution confined within proper limits; since, from our very constitution, it must necessarily have as much power as it demands, and can only be confined by itself. How is this consistent with our experience of human nature? I answer, that the interest of\n\n(56)\n\nthe body is here restrained by the interest of the Individuals, and that the house of Commons stretches not its power; because such an usurpation would be contrary to the interest of the majority of its members. The Crown has so many offices in its disposal, that, &c. Ibid., p. 31.\n\n70 years have passed since this prerogative (viz. the King’s rejection of bill passed by the Lords and Commons) has been made use of. Young, Political Essays, p. 44. Question the reason and see the book.§ [Quincy]\n\n☞\n\nDeductions may be drawn and inferences made, from the four preceding pages of much importance to the British Colonies. [Quincy]\n\n(57)\n\n’Tis a maxim in politics, which we readily admit as undisputed and universal, That a power, however great, when granted by law to an eminent magistrate, is not so dangerous to liberty, as an authority, however inconsiderable, which he acquires from violence and usurpation. By the same right that one prerogative is assumed without law, another may also be claimed, and another with still greater facility; while *the first usurpations both serve as precedents to the following, and give force to maintain them. Hence the heroism of Hampden, who sustained the whole violence of royal prosecution, rather than pay a tax of 20 shillings not imposed by parliament; hence the care of all English patriots to guard against the first encroachments of the crown; and hence alone the existence, at this day, of English liberty. Hume, “Of some remarkable Customs,” Essays, p. 207.\n\n*See Macaulay, History of England, 5:8n, and vide Wilson, Reports, pp. 85–86.§ [Quincy]\n\nNB. Impressing seamen is a departure from it. In this instance the exercise of an illegal power is permitted in the Crown.§\n\n(58)\n\nWithout a militia, ’tis folly to think any free government will ever have security or stability. Hume, “Idea of a perfect Commonwealth,” Essays, p. 278.\n\nWhere the sword is in the hands of a single person—as in our constitution he will always neglect to discipline the militia, in order to have a pretext for keeping up a standing army. ’Tis evident, that this is a mortal distemper in the BRITISH government, of which it must at last inevitably perish. Ibid., p. 279.\n\n(59)\n\nThe people, if we trace government to its first origin in the woods and deserts, are the source of all power and jurisdiction, and voluntarily for the sake of peace and order, abandoned their native liberty, and received laws from their equal and companion. The conditions, upon which they were willing to submit, were either exprest, or were so clear and obvious, that it might be well esteemed superfluous to express them. If this, then, be meant by the Original Contract, it cannot be denied, that all government is, at first, founded on a contract, and that the most ancient rude combinations of mankind were formed entirely upon that principle. In vain are we\n\n(60)\n\nsent to the records to seek for this charter of our liberties. It was not wrote on parchment, nor yet on leaves or barks of trees. It preceeded the use of writing and all the other civilized arts of life. But we trace it plainly to the nature of man, and to the equality, which we find in all the individuals of that species. A man’s natural force consists only in the vigor of his limbs and the firmness of his courage, which could never subject multitudes to the command of one. Nothing but their own consent, and the sense of the advantage of peace, and order could have had that influence. Hume, “Of the Original Contract,” Essays, p. 253.\n\n(61)\n\nThere is a principle, supposed to prevail among many, which is utterly incompatible with all virtue or moral sentiment; as it can proceed from nothing but the most depraved disposition, so in its turn it tends still farther to encourage that depravity. This principle is, that all benevolence is mere hypocrisy, friendship a cheat, public spirit a farce, fidelity a snare to procure trust and confidencce; and while all of us, at the bottom, pursue only our private interest, we wear these fair disguises, in order to put others off their guard, and expose them the more to our wiles and machinations.\n\n(62)\n\nThere is another principle, somewhat resembling the former; which has been much insisted on by philosophers, and has been the foundation of many a system; that whatever affection one may feel, or imagines he feels for others, no passion is, or can be disinterested; that the most generous friendship, however sincere, is a modification of self love; and that even unknown to ourselves, we seek only our own gratification, while we appear the most deeply engaged in schemes for the liberty and happiness of\n\n(63)\n\nmankind. By a turn of imagination, by a refinement of reflection, by an enthusiasm of passion, we seem to take part in the interests of others, and imagine ourselves divested of all selfish considerations: But at bottom, the most generous patriot and most niggardly miser, the bravest hero and most abject coward, have, in every action, an equal regard to their own happiness and welfare. Hume, “Of Benevolence,” Essays, p. 400.\n\n(64)\n\nThough the people, in giving up the Sovereign authority to any one, without reserve, and that he should be invested with a power as extensive as possible; notwithstanding, he (the sovereign) has no more of Right, than each had in his private capacity, at the time when the society was first entered into and formed: No one had a right to do hurt to himself, nor to others; but only to procure his own good, and that of the Publick; consequently, the People could not convey any right of a different nature to the Sovereign Power.—No one ever consented to a Superior Power but with a view to their own advantage. If it answers the intention of the People, it is founded in Right.\n\n(65)\n\nBut, if the people find themselves mistaken, the Right of Superiority and Command immediately ceases.

Fortescue, Chapter IX, “The Nature of a Government which is Political,” De Laudibus, p. 17\n\n(66)\n\nThe people would be in a dismal state, in case they were to be governed by strange and foreign laws, such as they had not been used to, such as they could not approve of: More especially if those laws should affect them in their properties, for the preservation whereof, as well as of their persons, they freely submitted to Kingly Government; it is plain that such a power as this, could never originally proceed from the people; and if not from them, a king could have no such power rightfully at all.

Gordon, Tacitus, 1:79.\n\n(68)\n\nNothing has hitherto been found a sufficient check and barrier to the exorbitant passions of men; neither kindness nor severity; nor mulcts nor pains; nor honour; nor infamy; nor the terror of death: A proof how far human malice or ambition is an over match for human wisdom; since Laws and constitutions framed by the best and wisest men, have, first or last, become the sport and conquest of the worst, sometimes of the most foolish. Ibid., 1:64.\n\nPower of itself makes men wanton, distrustfull and cruel. Ibid., 1:72. q.v.\n\n(69)\n\nWhat avails the fair behaviour of one who may do what he pleases? What avails his promises, which he may break when he pleases? The worst of the Roman emperors began their reign well, many of them excellently well; as Nero, Claudius, Caligula, Domitian; some of them reigned well for many years. Caesar was generous, magnificent, and humane to affectation, but every passion, every sentiment must yield to the ardent lust of reigning. Had it not been for his great and acceptable qualities, he could not have introduced public bondage; the Hero, the Orator, and the fine Gentleman, hid the Usurper, and palliated at least the Usurpation. Ibid., 1:73.\n\nSee Debates in Commons, 1:331 [Edward Southwell, 8 December 1744].§\n\nYe men of Massachusetts! have you no Little Caesar—a miniature tyrant? [Quincy]\n\n(70)\n\nIf by a repitition of crimes, you become too mighty to be punished, you must be content to be accursed and abhorred as an enemy to human race; you must expect to have all men for your Enemies, as you are an enemy to all men; and since you make sport of the lives and liberties of men, you must not wonder, nor have you a right to complain, if they all of them have memories and feeling, and some of them courage and swords. Gordon, Tacitus, 1:87.\n\n(71)\n\nThe people (of Rome) were deceived into a belief that they still enjoyed the old government, because their Magistrates had still their old names, though with just as much power as he (Augustus Caesar) thought fit to leave them. This was the advice of Maecenas, that to the officers of the State, the same names, pomp and ornaments should be continued, with all the appearances of authority without the power. Ibid., 1:88.\n\nIf people have plenty at home, they will not be apt to discover many errors or much iniquity in the public, which will always be at quiet when particulars are so.—People in ease and plenty are under no temptation to be enquiring into the title of their Prince, or to resent acts of power which they do not immediately feel. Ibid., 1:89.\n\n(72)\n\nTo engage new creatures and dependencies, he (Augustus) created many new Offices; as the multitude of offices in France is reckoned a great support of the authority Royal. Ibid., 1:90.\n\nHaving lulled the Public asleep, he (Augustus) was sowing his tares. The Roman people and the Roman Senate he reduced to cyphers and carcasses. Certain wealth and preferment were the rewards of ready servility and acquiescence. Ibid., 1:92–93.\n\n(73)\n\n“Verily (said that great and good prince Marcus Antoninus) it is neither the influence of revenue and treasures, nor the multitude of guards, that can uphold a prince, or assure him of obedience, unless with the duty of obedience, the zeal and affections of his people do concur. Surely, only long and secure is the reign of such a one as by actions of benignity stamps upon the hearts of his people the impressions of love; not those of fear by acts of cruelty. A prince has nothing to fear from his people, as long as their obedience flows from inclination, and is not constrained by servitude; and subjects will never refuse obedience, when they are not treated with contumely and violence.”\n\nA man who means no ill would not seek the power to do it, and he who seeks that power, or has it, will be eternally suspected to mean no good. Ibid., 1:122–123.\n\n(74)\n\nBetween a prince’s forfeiting the public affection, and his incurring the public hatred, there is scarce any medium, and even that medium is a terrible one; since to be scorned is not much better than to be hated and often infers it. Ibid., 1:125.\n\nIf Princes would never encroach, subjects would hardly ever rebell; and if the former knew that they would be resisted, they would not encroach.—It is certain mischief to both prince and people, to assert slavish doctrines, and no security to Either; since nature oppressed will depart from passive principle.—\n\nThe least attempt upon public liberty is—alarming; if it is suffered once, it will be apt to be repeated often; a few repetitions create a habit; habit claims\n\n(75)\n\nprescription and right. Ibid., 1:128–129.\n\nRigorous punishments for small faults, or such as in the common opinion pass for none, is a mark of ill politics. Surely it ought to be a maxim in government, that errors which can have no consequences, ought to have no punishment. Ibid., 1:200.\n\nSuch has generally been the logic of the sword, that because it has saved, it may therefore oppress and enthrall, and for defending a part, take the whole. Armies be yet great taxes; heavy taxes waste and impoverish the country, even where armies commit no violence; a case seldom to be supposed; because it has seldom happened. But where great armies are, they must be employed, and do mischief abroad, to keep them from doing it at home; so that the people\n\n(76)\n\nmust be exhausted and oppressed to keep the men of the sword in exercise. Ibid., 1:220.\n\nIn regard to Public Liberty, armies if best disciplined are not less to be dreaded than the worst, but I think more; since their relaxation of discipline takes away from their union and sufficiency; it renders them weaker and less equal to mighty mischief; but where they are strict and united, the highest iniquities are not too big for them. Disorderly troops may rob particulars, ravage towns, and harrass a country; but if you would subdue nations, commit universal spoil, and enslave empires, your forces must be under the best regulations. It was with an Army victorious and brave, and consequently well disciplined, that Agathocles\n\n(77)\n\nslaughtered all the Nobles of Syracuse, and brought that illustrious state (the noblest of all the Greek cities) under bondage. Cromwell’s conquest of his own country was made by troops the most sober and best disciplined that this, or perhaps any other nation, had ever seen. And it was with the best of all the Roman Armies that Caesar established himself tyrant of Rome. Ibid., 1:221.\n\nSoldiers know little else but booty, and blind obedience; whatever their interest, or rapacity dictates, they generally will do; and whatever their officers command, they must do. It is their profession to dispute by force, and the sword; they too soon learn their own power, and where it is an overbalance for the Civil power, it will always controul the Civil power, and\n\n(78)\n\nall things. They find readily somewhat to say; the strongest is ever the best disputant, when he carries his reasons upon the point of his sword.—It is nothing to the purpose to say, that an army listed amongst the natives, especially the officers being natives, and many of them men of fortune, will never hurt or oppress their country; for such were Cromwell’s army, such were Caesar’s, and many other enslaving Armies; besides armies are soon modelled, and officers who are obnoxious, are soon changed.\n\nNo government can subsist but by force, and where ever that force lies, there it is that government is or soon will be. Free States have preserved themselves and their liberties, by &c. Ibid., 1:221–222.*\n\n*To be read by all Englishmen, but especially Americans.§ [Quincy]\n\n(79)\n\nGreat Britain has preserved its liberties so long, because it has preserved itself from great standing armies; which, wherever they are strong enough to master their country, will certainly first or last master it. Ibid., 1:227.\n\nAn important truth! Worthy the consideration of every Englishman. [Quincy]\n\n(80)\n\nThere is a tradition, that Tiberius, as often as he went out of the senate, was wont to cry out in Greek, Oh men prepared for bondage! Even he who could not bear public liberty, [was] nauseated [by] the prostitute tameness of slaves. Ibid., 1:238.\n\n“The authority of laws decreases, when that of the prince advances, and sovereignty is not to be exercised where the laws will serve.” A popular speech of Tiberius, joyfully received, as acts of popularity were rare with Tiberius. Ibid., 1:241.\n\n(81)\n\nWhat was, before the world was made, I leave to better Antiquaries than myself; but I am sure, since the world began, it was never storied, that Salus Populi began with Majestas Imperii, unless Majestas Imperii first unharboured it, and hunted it to a stand, and then it must either turn head and live, or turn tail and dye: but more have been storied on the other hand than Majestas Imperii is willing to hear: I doubt not but Majestas Imperii knows; that Commonwealths cost as much the making as Crownes.—But preces and lachryma, are the people’s weapons: so are swords and pistols, when GOD and Parliaments bid them arme. Prayers and tears are good weapons for them that have nothing but knees and\n\n(82)\n\nEyes; but most men are made with teeth and nails; onely they must neither scratch for liberties, nor bite prerogatives, till they have wept and prayed as God would have them. If subjects must fight for their kings against other kingdoms, when their kings will; I know no reason, but they may fight against their kings for their own kingdoms, when Parliaments say they may and must: but Parliament must not say they must, till God says they may.\n\nI can never believe &c. Ward, Simple Cobbler, pp. 44–45. q.v.\n\n(83)\n\nI have wondered this 30 years what kings aile: I have seen in my time the best part of 20 Christian kings and princes; yet as Christian as they were, some or other were still scuffling for prerogatives. It must be granted at all hands, that Prerogativa Regis are necessary supporters of State: and stately things to stately kings; but if withal, they be Derogativa Regno, they are but little things to wise kings. Equity is as due to the people, as eminency to princes; liberty to subjects, as royalty to kings: if they cannot walk together lovingly hand in hand, pari passu, they must cut girdles and part as good friends as they may. Ibid., p. 46.\n\nNB. What is here said of Liberty and Royalty may be as well said of Majestas Imperii & Salus Populi. See before, pp. 82, 83. [Quincy]\n\n(84)\n\nDistracted nature, calls for distracting remedies; perturbing policies for disturbing cures; if one extreme should not constitute its anti-extreme, all things would soon be in extremo: if ambitious winds get into Rulers Crowns, rebellious vapours will into Subjects caps, be they stopt never to close: yet the tongues of times tell us of ten Preter-royall usurpations, to one contra civil rebellion.\n\nPeoples prostrations of these things*12§ when they may lawfully helpe it, are prophane prostitutions: and just it is that such as undersell them, should not re-inherit them in haste, though they seek it carefully with tears. Ibid, pp. 46–47.\n\n(85)\n\nOur Common Law doth well, but it must doe better before things do as they should. There are some Maximes in law, that would be taught to speak a little more mannerly, or else well Anti-maxim’d: we say, the king can doe a Subject no wrong; why may we not say, the Parliament can do the King no wrong? We say, Nullum tempus occurrit regi in taking wrong; why may we not say, Nullum tempus succurrit regi in doing wrong? Which I doubt will prove a better canon, if well examined. Ibid., pp. 49–50.\n\nWhat good will it do you, deare countrymen, to live without lives, to enjoy England without the God of England, your kingdome without a parliament, your parliament without power, your liberties without stability, your lawes without justice, your honours\n\n(86)\n\nwithout vertue, your being without tranquility, your wives without honesty, your children without morality, your servants without civility, your lands without propriety, your goods without immunity, the Gospel without salvation, your churches without ministry, your ministers without piety, and all you have or can have, without more tears and bitternesse of heart, than all you have and shall have will sweeten or wipe away?\n\nGoe on therefore Renowned Gentlemen, fall on resolvedly, till your hands cleave to your swords, your swords to your enemies hearts, your hearts to victory, your victory to triumph, your triumph to the everlasting praise of him that hath given your spirits to offer yourselves willingly, and to jeopard your lives in high perils, for his name and service sake. Ibid., pp. 70–71. q.v.\n\n(87)\n\nImpartial posterity repays to every man his proper praise.—Hence we may justly mock the stupidity of those, who imagine that they can, by present power, extinguish the lights and memory of succeeding times. Gordon, Tacitus, 2:287.\n\n(88)\n\nThe guilty combine for mutual exemption from punishment.—Confederacies between guilty men in power and guilty men out of power, are frequent and natural; and no man who is corrupt or intends to be, will care to join in punishing any man for corruption. Ibid., 3:17.\n\nAll corruptions creep easily in, but are with great difficulty removed. In time they even grow fashionable, and then no man is ashamed of being in the mode, so that the greatest infamy upon earth ceases to be infamous when grown common, as every iniquity countenanced at Court will grow. When the shame of being vicious is banished, vice becomes established; nay, virtue will then be thought singularity and sourness, and be treated with coldness and contempt. Ibid., 3:132.\n\n(89)\n\nSuch is the nature of men, especially of men in power; that they will rather commit two errors than retract one; as Lord Clarendon justly observes. Sometimes they will commit a second, to shew that they are not ashamed of the first, but resolved to defy resentment, to declare their contempt of the people, and how much they are above fear and amendment. Some of them have delighted to heighten cruelty by mirth and derision, like &c. Ibid., 3:175.\n\nMen in power are much apter to oppress, than the people to rebel. People oppressed rejoice in public misfortunes. In disputes between magistrates and people, the former generally to blame. Ibid., 3:176.\n\n(90)\n\nPower is an enchroaching thing, and seldom fails to take more than is given. Men in limited authority are apt to covet more, and when they have gained more, to take all. The people, who chiefly aim at protection and security, are content to keep what they have, nor seek to interfere in matters of power, till power has attempted to rob them of liberty and right. Ibid., 3:178.\n\nThe power of protecting the people is the noblest trust that mortal man can possess.—A power to destroy you, none but a destroyer can want. Ibid., 3:184–185.\n\n(91)\n\nPeople who will not be oppressed, will always be reckoned ungovernable by men who are, or would be oppressors, and enemies of oppression will be stiled enemies of government. It will be seditious to blame the excesses of power; insolent to mention the insolence of those who abuse power; it will be the sign of a turbulent spirit, to distinguish between public right and wrong, between government and tyranny; nor will it be enough to own all good government to be irresistable, but the worst and the abuse of the best must be likewise irresistable. To complain of tyranny, will be faction; to throw it off, rebellion. They who oppress are the first and greatest rebels; and for the oppressed to turn upon them, is but to resist rebellion, is but to do a just and a natural\n\n(92)\n\naction. Whoever violates the Laws of reason, equity and nature, whoever violates the Laws of his country, whatever station or name he bears, is a rebel, subject to the Laws against violence and rebellion. Tyrants, therefore, and lawless oppressors are the highest and most consummate rebels to the world, capital traitors to GOD and man, and punishable by all the Laws of GOD and reason. Ibid., 3:186.\n\nWeak and poor is that loyalty which results only from force and fear, nor can it last longer than does the slavish passion which creates it, but goes with it, as it comes with it. Ibid.\n\nInstruction for Great Britain and the Colonies.§ [Quincy]\n\n(93)\n\nAbuses once suffered to creep in, so naturally gain ground, so quickly spread, that it requires constant vigilance to prevent their entrance and growth. A jealousy for the Public is a commendable jealousy, and if ever the excess of any passion were justifiable, it would be surely so here. Ibid., 3:247. q.v.\n\nAbuses of power make corruption necessary; corruption produces baseness, luxury, and the extinction of all virtue, and these seldom end but in usurpation and tyranny. Ibid., 3:249.\n\nSuch as are known not to love their country, cannot reasonably\n\n(94)\n\nexpect to be safe in it, or that enemity to the Public will not meet with public hate, which is the next step to public revenge. Ibid., 3:253–254.\n\nTreacherous is that repose which you enjoy amongst neighbours that are very powerfull and very fond of rule and mastership. Ibid., 4:549.\n\n(95)\n\nIf the despotism of a Sovereign enslaves genius and impairs courage, the evil is not so great as is imagined. But the despotism of a subaltern stifles even emulation, and produces the meanest and most complete of all servitudes. Talbot, French Nation, 1:307.\n\nFond and stubborn as are the prejudices of vulgar minds to precedent and custom, whatever is sublime in nature or in art is no sooner known than venerated. Governments formed on principles which promise the equal distribution of power and liberty, attach to their service every generous inclination which subsists in the human character: Monarchy, stripped of its\n\n(96)\n\ntrappings, and exposed naked to the eye of reason, becomes odious in the comparison; partial benefit is exploded, and the generous plan of universal happiness adopted, and the common good becomes the common care. Macaulay, History of England, 5:18–19.\n\nThe art of princes is to make conquests of their subjects, not to enlarge the Empire of a free people. A standing army is a never-failing instrument of domestic triumph; and it is very doubtfull whether a naval force could be rendered useful in any capacity but that of extending the power and prosperity of the country. Ibid., 5:106–107n.\n\n(97)\n\nGiving the purse of the people to the Chief magistrate is giving all the security they can have for their rights and liberties. Ibid., 5:216–217.\n\nRoyalist principles must be agreable to all governors. Ibid., 5:225.\n\nThe Republic is always attacked with greater vigour than it is defended; for the audacious and profligate by their natural enmity to it, are easily impelled to act upon the least nod of their leaders; whereas the honest, I [know] not why, are generally slow and unwilling to stir; and neglecting always the beginnings of things, are never roused to exert themselves, but by the last necessity, so that through irresolution and delay, when they would be glad to compound at last for their quiet, at the expence of their honour, they commonly lose them both. Cicero, “Oration for Sextius.”\n\n(98)\n\nMr. Locke, Mr. Molineux, Colonel Sidney, and other dangerous authors talk of Liberty as a blessing to which the whole race of mankind hath an original title; whereof nothing but unlawful force can divest them. I know a good deal of the several Gothick institutions in Europe; and by what incidents and events they came to be destroyed: And I ever thought it the most uncontrouled and universally agreed maxims, that Freedom consists in a people’s being governed by laws with their own consent; and slavery in the contrary. Swift, “A Letter to the Right Honourable the Lord Viscount Molesworth” (Drapier Letter no. 5, 1724) Works [10:86–87].\n\nSee the similar sentiment in Phillip DCommines (pp. 179–223 of his History), who was Prime minister to Louis the 11th of France mentioned on p. 17 ante.13\n\n(99)\n\nNo laws can be made to affect him (the subject) or his property but by his own consent; given in person if he be chosen, or by his representative if he is a voter. By Sir John Holt, in Ashby v. White, p. 20.\n\nEdward the first (the Despot) issued writs to the Sheriffs enjoining them to send to Parliament, along with two Knights of the Shire, two deputies from each Borough within their county, and these provided with sufficient power from their community to consent, in their name, to what he and his council should require of them. As it is a most equitable Rule, says he, in his preamble to this writ, that what concerns all should be judged of by All; a noble\n\n(100)\n\nprinciple, which may seem to indicate a liberal mind in the king, and which laid the foundation of a free and equitable government. Hume, History, Edward I [2:90].\n\nTo increase our national Land forces to double or treble what we have at present on foot; no one will say that this would be consistent, either with the preservation of our Constitution, or the preservation of our trade. The Honorable William Murray, Solicitor General, speech of 6 December 1743, Debates of the British Commons, 1:123.\n\n(101)\n\nI have generally observed, that when ministers do not like the advice proposed to be given they pretend, that the offering of any such advice would be an inchroachment upon the prerogatives of the crown; but when the advice proposed to be given by parliament to the crown, is such as the ministers approve of, or, perhaps, such as they have themselves before given, the prerogatives of the crown are forgot, and the Duties of Parliament only are thought on; one of the chief of which certainly is, to offer, upon all proper occasions, our best advice to Our sovereign; and this is never so much, or more indispensable our duty, than when we find, that ministers have given him bad advice, or seem resolved not to give him good advice for the sake of acquiring an interest in the closet, or for the fear of losing the Interest they have there. George Doddington, speech of 6 December 1743, ibid., 1:129–130.\n\n(102)\n\nThe exertion of Prerogative, and the advising how to exert prerogative, are two very distinct things: His majesty only is to exert the prerogative, but his Parliament is to advise him how to exert it. George Doddington, 6 December 1743, ibid., 1:137.\n\nIn this country it is hardly possible for discontent to deviate into disaffection, till the people are generally convinced, that they can expect no redress of grievances under the family then upon the throne. Then indeed, and not till then, they may become generally disaffected as well as discontented, and then they may cast their eyes upon another family for relief. Nicholas Fazakerley, speech of 3 May 1743, ibid., 1:202.\n\n(103)\n\nI think every Man (said Robert Vyner Esq. in Parliament) that takes or accepts of Public money, without having done, or being able to do some service to the Public, is a plunderer of the Public, and consequently a public criminal. Ibid., 1:315, on 8 December 1743.\n\nThere is no maxim in Politics more certain, than that it is impossible to preserve a free government in a country where the people are generally actuated by a selfish and mean spirit. Robert Vyner, 8 December 1743, ibid., 1:322.\n\nQuery: Then whether a commercial nation can have a free government? [Quincy]\n\n(104)\n\nAs to the danger that threatens Our liberties, I do no much wonder at our ministers not being affected with it; because from the whole course of our history, as well as from late experience, I have observed, that as soon as a gentleman becomes a minister, or, as he calls himself, a servant of the crown, he shakes off all concern for the liberties of his country, and whatever professions some of our present ministers may have formerly made, I am afraid it will be found, that they have no more virtue than their predecessors. Edward Southwell, speech of 8 December 1743, ibid., 1:332.\n\n(105)\n\nMen, capable of judging without prejudice, I am sure, must be sensible of the great danger Our liberties are in, from the vast influence the crown has of late years acquired by the multiplication of offices, and the increase of Officers, as well as the increase of the salaries and perquisites; surely no gentleman will say, that Our monarchy would continue to be a limited monarchy*, if the crown were sure of having always a parliament at its devotion; and that this may be the case, that this will be the case, is, I think, absolutely certain, if some effectual method be not very soon taken to prevent it. A reformation of some kind or other is become absolutely necessary, if we intend to preserve our liberties.\n\n*If the British Parliament have the purse-strings of the Colonies—the James Palace will soon have the American Assemblies at their devotion—and therefore, according to this reasoning &c. See before pp. 9, 53–54, 90–91.§ [Quincy]\n\n(106)\n\nI have such an opinion of ministers, that I cannot be easily perswaded that they will ever consent to have their power effectually abridged; therefore I must be of opinion, that if ever any such bill be passed, it must make its way through this house against the power and influence of the Administration, and must be forced through the other two branches of the Legislature, or one of them, at least, by the obstinate virtue of this Assembly: Thank GOD! we have still the power in our hands, in some measure, to compell a compliance with what our constituents, as well as Ourselves, think absolutely necessary for the preservation of Our Constitution. Edward Southwell, 8 December 1743, ibid., 1:334–335.\n\nQuery: If the Colonies have the Enjoyment of this rightfull power.§ [Quincy]\n\n(107)\n\nPlaces and Employments in the Government: are generally offered by ministers—upon condition of betraying their country. Edward Southwell, 8 December 1743, ibid., 1:339.\n\nTo talk of a man’s right to a pecuniary reward for serving his country, is to talk in that vile mercenary stile that has been designedly introduced of late years, in order to propogate ministerial corruption; but to talk justly, no man has a right to a pecuniary reward for any service he can do his country. Sir, the service of our country is like the service of GOD;\n\n(108)\n\nwhen we have done all we can, we have done but our duty; and no man can have a right to a reward for doing no more than his duty. The rewards, therefore, bestowed for public service, are not what any man has a right to demand, but such only as generosity, charity or prudence may induce the country to bestow; and I am sure &c. Edward Southwell, same speech, ibid., 1:340.\n\n(109)\n\nThe liberties of this country (Britain) cannot be preserved, unless some proper method should speedily be taken for preventing the effect of ministerial corruption, both in Parliament and at Elections; and the most proper and effectu-all method for the purpose, is to make elections as frequent as possible.\n\nGentlemen (members of the house of Commons) once chosen for a long term of years, they fix their abode in this city (London) and seldom revisit their constituents, till it becomes necessary for them to go down to solicit their votes at a new election. Nay, since the Establishment of Septennial Parliaments, we have often had Gentlemen in this house, who never saw the Borough that sent them hither, nor knew anything of its constitution or interest, perhaps could not recollect its\n\n(109)14\n\nname, till they looked into the Printed lists of Parliament, for their own names, and there found they represented such a Borough. Thomas Carew, 29 January 1744, ibid., 2:10–11.\n\nIn all countries, and in this as much as any other, ministers have an interest seperate from that of the people: they are for enriching themselves, their families, tools and sycophants, at the Expence of the people; and it is their business to keep all avenues to the Throne shut up against the complaints of the people. Thomas Carew, same speech, ibid., 2:12.\n\n(110)\n\nAnnual Parliaments are more agreeable to the reason of things and the nature of our constitution, than parliaments of any longer duration; and of this we must be convinced even to a demonstration, if we will but consider, that we are properly speaking of attornies of the people. Is it prudent, is it reasonable, that any men should give a power of Attorney irrevocable for a long term of years? Shall a whole people do what would be the height of foolishness in every individual? The people may guess at what sort of business is to come before the next ensuing session of Parliament, and they may chuse an Attorney who, they think, has capacity and integrity enough for transacting that sort of business for them; but they cannot so much as guess at what\n\n(111)\n\nmay come before parliament in a course of seven years, nor can they depend upon the continuance of any man’s integrity for such a number of years. It is, therefore, most unnatural and unreasonable to force the people to give an irrevocable power of Attorney for such a long term. The practice was first introduced under the reign of Richard II, and was approved of by a parliament that in every instance betrayed the liberties of the people they represented, and sacrificed the interest of the country to the violent passions of the Sovereign and the insatiable avarice of his ministers. Thomas Carew, same speech, in ibid., 2:13.\n\n(112)\n\nIf our septennial Parliament be any longer continued,*15 I shall not wonder to see the ministers letters of recommendation, with respect to the choice of any candidate, as implicity obeyed in all our counties, cities and boroughs, as the King’s Conge d’Elire is now in the chapters of our Episcopal Cathedral; and if this should ever come to be Our case, I shall look with indignation upon every man who pretends to be a Briton. The very pretence would be an insult upon the understanding of him it was addressed to. We should be all slaves: GOD knows to whom. Thomas Carew, same speech, ibid., 2:17.\n\nQuery: How far from it now–1771?§ [Quincy]\n\n(113)\n\nNo Turkish grand Signior or Eastern monarch, ever committed such barbarous and wanton cruelties, by the advice of his Divan, though all named by himself alone, as the Roman emperor did by the advice, or with the approbation of their senate, which had the appearance of being chosen by the people; and if our king and his ministers were assured of having always a corrupt majority in Parliament, under their direction, they might, and I am perswaded, some future Sovereign would, commit more acts of injustice and cruelty, under the Sanction of an act or order of Parliament, than any despotic monarch durst\n\n(114)\n\nventure upon, had he no Parliament to patronize and give countenance to his Crimes.\n\nOur people would be oppressed with taxes imposed by parliament, for the inriching of Royal favorites, or the carrying on of royal Schemes, that never were, nor could be of any service to the nation; and the most pernicious measures our ministers could pursue, would be approved and applauded by Our parliament.\n\nThe nation would be happier under a sole arbitrary monarch without a parliament, than under a sole arbitrary monarch supported and countenanced in all his\n\n(115)\n\nmeasures by a corrupt parliament. Sir John Phillips, 29 January 1744, ibid., 2:48–49.\n\n“What was once prophecy—is now history!” [Quincy]\n\n☞\n\nTo a free state, corruption is of all other dangers the greatest, because the least sensible. I shall grant, that after the people become sensible of their danger, the enemies, or the destroyers of their liberties must have force sufficient to compell their submission; but by what means can the enemies of public liberty possess themselves of the force requisite for this purpose? It is by corruption alone they can possess themselves of this force; and\n\n(116)\n\nbeing once possessed of it, those they can not corrupt, they compel, and those they cannot compel, they destroy. This, Sir, is the method by which all free states have been destroyed: the people are by corruption alone, induced to depart from some of the fundamental maxims of their constitution, or to delay, providing in a proper manner against some emergent dangers, and by this means, some one man, or some set of men, get so much power into their hands, and such a force at their command, as enable them to overturn the constitution. Till they have done this, they carefully conceal their designs.\n\nThough it be admitted, that the people of England could not be tempted, by corruption alone, to support an\n\n(117)\n\nadministration in an open and avowed attack upon their liberties; yet upon various pretences, rendered feasible by corruption, they may be tempted to lodge so much power in the crown, as may enable ministers to make use of open force, if ever they should find it necessary; for this they will never do, as long as they can obtain every thing they desire by corruption alone; and if the longer they succeed by corruption, the more easy and secure will their success become in every future period of time; because when opposition has, by long experience, been found to be fruitless, it will at last become ridiculous, and then the few virtuous that may remain amongst us, will think of nothing but passing\n\n(118)\n\naway their time in indolence and obscurity.\n\nBut if by chance a glimmering of public spirit should break forth, as it sometimes did, even under the Emperors of Rome, and our ministers should find, they could not carry their point by corruption alone, they would then do as the Roman Emperors did; they would make use of that power or force which corruption had before furnished them with, and pretences would be found for removing or destroying all those they found they could not corrupt. It would then be too late to think of a remedy for the Evil, by any bill that could be contrived. Inter Arma vilent leges: Against force nothing but a superior force could prevail; and if the army we now keep up should once be as much attached to the crown, as Julius Caesar’s\n\n(119)\n\nArmy was to him, I should be glad to know, where we could find a force superior to that army, considering the present unarmed and undisciplined state of the rest of the people of this kingdom. Sir John Phillips, 29 January 1744, ibid., 2:56–58.\n\nQuery: If this attachment is not now existing—and therefore ignore? [Quincy]\n\nThe effects of corruption (says the same speaker) have of late (1744) become so evident, that if we do not bring in and pass some proper and effectual bills, for securing our independancy, we ought, I think, to make our last will and\n\n(120)\n\ntestament; by bringing in and passing one short bill for vesting all the powers of parliament in the King and his privy council; which is the easiest and most expiditious way of putting an end to the form or shadow of our constitution; and in my opinion, no gentleman, who opposes the first of these expedients, will oppose the last, for any reason but that of his being loth to put an end to a market in which he has by experience found great advantage.\n\n—It is evident, that while Our ministers govern, or have any hopes of governing by a corrupt parliament, they will never duely\n\n(121)\n\nencourage or promote a true military spirit among our soldiers or seamen; and experience as well as reason, must convince us, that while they are provided by parliament with a standing army, they will discourage, as much as possible, any sort of martial spirit or military discipline among the rest of the people. Ibid, 2:61.\n\n(122)\n\nBy a numerous standing army and a severe riot act, you may, indeed, prevent mobs and riots among the people; but if this method be continued for any long time, you will make your ministers tyrants and your people slaves. Ibid.\n\nQuery: If this prophecy is fullfilling or already accomplished?§ [Quincy]\n\nThe populace of this kingdom have been of late bridled by standing armies, riot acts, and ministerial slaves, called justices of the peace. If a man has the prime minister for his protector, he has but little to fear from an enraged populace. Sir John Bernard, in the same debate, 12 February 1744, ibid., 2:118.\n\n(123)\n\nWas there ever a state-vulture (said Major Selwyn in the house of Commons 1744) brôt to a reckoning, that pleaded the general issue? George Augustus Selwyn, 26 February 1744, ibid., 2:176.\n\nIn former ages the complexion of this House might have been depended on as a true representation of the inclinations of the people; but, by whatever magick art it has been brôt about, the case is now directly otherwise. The complexion of this Assembly is always the same with that of Our ministers. We adopt all their measures: we applaud every step of their conduct: we are angry with those they happen to be angry with: we enquire when they set\n\n(124)\n\nus on; and we stop when they say, y"
