        "text": "Top 10 facts\n\nDrake was born in Tavistock, Devonshire. His family was very religious and his father was a Protestant preacher. Although the family were respectable they were not very wealthy and Drake was sent to sea at the age of twelve.\n\nDrake was apprenticed to a merchant and his seafaring skills brought him to the attention of his cousins, the Hawkins family, who were privateers. He participated in illegal slave trading expeditions with his cousin Sir John Hawkins.\n\nPrivateers were allowed by the government to commit acts of piracy against Spanish property; in return their sponsors received a share of the plunder. In 1572 Drake received his own privateer's commission from Elizabeth I.\n\nIn 1568 Drake and Hawkins were trapped by the Spanish at the port of San Juan de Ulua in Mexico. Many of their men were killed and Drake had to swim to safety. This incident resulted in him developing a life-long dislike of Spain.\n\nBetween 1577 and 1580 he successfully sailed around the globe becoming the first Englishman to do so. The first circumnavigation was made by Ferdinand Magellan some fifty years earlier.\n\nThe ship which Drake used to circumnavigate the world, the Golden Hind, was originally called the Pelican.\n\nOne of Drake’s most famous exploits was the ‘Singeing of King of Spain’s beard’. This refers to his attack on Cadiz in 1587. Drake and his fleet managed to destroy 20-30 enemy ships and their supplies, delaying the launch of the Armada.\n\nDrake was allegedly playing bowls on Plymouth Hoe when news reached him of the imminent arrival of the Spanish Fleet. He is said to have remarked that he had time to finish the game before defeating the Spanish.\n\nDrake was a vice admiral of the English fleet at the time of the Armada. He is credited with the idea of using fire ships to scatter the Spanish Fleet, making the individual ships more vulnerable to English gunfire.\n\nDrake’s final expeditions against the Spanish were unsuccessfully. In 1589 he lost 20 ships and 12,000 men trying to help the Portuguese who were rebelling against Spanish occupation. He died of dysentery after engaging with the Spanish in the Caribbean.\n\nTimeline\n\nDid you know?\n\nFrancis Drake was the first of twelve sons of Edmund Drake and Mary Mylwaye.\n\nDrake’s conduct as a young apprentice to a ship master was so impressive that the master later gave him his ship!\n\nWhen he landed in what is now California in the United States, Drake named it Nova Albion (new England)!\n\ntQueen Elizabeth I knighted Drake when she dined on board his ship, the Golden Hind, at Deptford on the River Thames.\n\nKing Philip II offered a reward of 20,000 ducats for Drake’s life.\n\nDrake died of dysentery and was buried at sea. He was dressed in full armour and placed in a lead coffin.\n\nDrake married twice but did not have any children.\n\nLook through the gallery below and see if you can spot the following:\n\nA statue of Sir Francis Drake in Portsmouth\n\nThe Golden Hind replica\n\nDrake being knighted by Queen Elizabeth\n\nDrake’s burial at sea\n\nDrake playing bowls at Plymouth Hoe\n\nA map showing the route taken by Drake as he circumnavigated the world\n\nGallery\n\nAbout\n\nDrake was one of the most successful privateers of all time. His exploits were legendary and his attacks on Spanish property and interests made him a very rich man.\n\nDrake demonstrated his abilities as a sailor from an early age. His explorations helped to increase knowledge about the world. He was the first Englishman to navigate the Straits of Magellan, a sea route at the southern tip of South America, and sailed further north along the coast of the Americas than any other European had before, landing in what is now California in the United States.\n\nHis daring raid on Cadiz and his tactical wizardry against the Armada demonstrated skilful seamanship and courage; he was a hero at home in England though he took part in the slave trade and was by all acoounts a very ruthless man.\n\nThe Spanish viewed Drake as a pirate who plundered and robbed their property, a ruthless destroyer of ships and killer of men. They nicknamed him ‘the Dragon’. Drake’s activities, supported by Elizabeth I, were a severe provocation to Philip of Spain and he sought his revenge with the launching of the Spanish Armada.\n\nFamous friends\n\nSir John Hawkins (1532-1595), a second cousin of Drake. He rose from being a privateer to treasurer and controller of the English navy. His innovations in ship design helped the English fleet to defeat the Armada. He was a vice admiral at the time of the Armada and was knighted by Elizabeth I. He died on the same final expedition as Drake.\n\nSir Walter Raleigh (1554-1618) an Elizabethan aristocrat, poet, explorer and adventurer. A great favourite of Elizabeth I, he was keen to promote English settlement in North America and is credited with introducing the potato and tobacco into England. Imprisoned on a number of occasions, he was finally executed by James I.\n\nRelated Videos\n\nJust for fun...\n\nExplore a portrait of Drake from the National Maritime Museum\n\nTake a CBBC quiz and see how much you know about Sir Francis Drake\n\nFind out more\n\nInformation about the swashbucking life of Sir Francis Drake, seafarer and pirate!\n\nLook at a map of Tudor exploration routes, including Drake's\n\nFind out about the lives of Tudor explorers including Sir Francis Drake\n\nSee pictures of important moments in Drake's life\n\nSir Francis Drake's Atlas of the World is now in Portsmouth\n\nBest children's books about Sir Francis Drake\n\nSee for yourself\n\nVisit Buckland Abbey, Drake’s home\n\nYou can see the Drake Jewel, a gift from Elizabeth I at the Victoria and Albert Museum London\n\nStep aboard a replica of The Golden Hind in Brixham, Devon\n\nAnother replica of Drake's galleon is moored in London: the Golden Hinde II\n\nAt the Pigott Family Gallery in the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich you can find out more about Tudor and Stuart seafarers\n\nAlso see"
