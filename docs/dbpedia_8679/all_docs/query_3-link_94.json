        "text": "When Thomas Pierrepoint removed the safety pin from the gallows at Strangeways Prison at 9 a.m. on the 24th June 1926, the diminutive figure of 31 year-old Mrs. Louie Calvert dropped through the hatch and in 20 seconds her life had ebbed away at the end of a hangman’s rope. Resigned to her fate after her conviction in court, she went to her maker quietly and in dignified fashion. Louie Calvert was one of the few British women ever to to be hanged and this was the first female hanging at Strangeways since that of Mary Ann Britland in 1886.\n\nAbove: Louie Calvert’s prison photograph taken shortly before she was hanged. This is the only known picture of Louie Calvert and is courtesy of Donna Johnson.\n\nHer tragically short life had never been easy and Louie Calvert (nee Gomersal) had been dodging the long arm of the law ever since she was sixteen years of age. She had given birth to two children: a girl Annie and a son Kenneth, both out of wedlock, whilst she worked as a prostitute in the seedy parts of Leeds. There’s no doubt that she led a double life, fabricated by a web of intricate lies and she alternated almost “Walter Mitty” like between a make believe world as a Salvation Army convert and the grim reality of scratching out a life in industrial Leeds after WW1. When you anlayse her story, sometimes it is hard to decide who really was the victim. Did Louie Calvert really murder two people or was she so mad, bad and committed to petty crime that the judge and both the prosecution and defence lawyers effectively gave up on her?\n\nLouie Gomersal was born in Ossett on the 12th January 1895, the daughter of woollen weaver Smith Gomersal and his second wife Annie Elizabeth (nee Clark). She was baptised at All Saint’s Church, Wakefield on the 14th April 1895. In 1901, the Gomersal family were living at Glenholme Terrace in Gawthorpe. Louie was the fourth of five children in the family. By 1911, the family had moved to live in nearby Pickersgill Street, and Smith Gomersal was now working as a caretaker at a school with Louie employed as a cloth weaver.\n\nAt the age of sixteen, in 1911, Louie Gomersal was bound over at Dewsbury Magistrates Court for for stealing Â£2 and for stealing 10 shillings in two separate offences of theft. This was just the start of her criminal career, and in July 1912, aged 17 years, she was sentenced to a year in Borstal for stealing a purse, a ring, a three-cent piece and a farthing from Mary Ann Carter on 25th September 1911 in Batley and Â£1 in money from Patrick Reynolds, also in Batley, on the 26th April 1912.\n\nLouie Gomersal was short, thin, undernourished, not particularly attractive and coarse in manners. In fact, she was less than five feet tall, but what she lacked in height, she made up for in assertiveness by way of a very strong personality. It was said that some people found her intimidating and they were genuinely scared of her.\n\nAfter leaving her home in Ossett, Louie Gomersal moved to Leeds, where she lived a hand-to-mouth existence as a prostitute. In about 1916, she gave birth to an illegitimate child called Annie, who went to live with Louie’s sister in Ossett. She also had a second child in 1919, a boy called Kenneth on whom she doted. Louie was fond of using an alias and for the Salvation Army meetings she sometimes attended, she used the name Mrs. Louise Jackson and also Edith Thompson when she was on the game.\n\nIn 1922, Louie using her “respectable” alias of Mrs. Louise Jackson, went to work as a housekeeper for 49 year-old John W. Frobisher, who lived in Mercy Street, lying between St. Philips Street and Wellington Lane, near the city centre of Leeds. On the 12th July 1922, Frobisher’s lifeless body was found 400 yards away from his house, near Monk Bridge, floating face down in the Leeds – Liverpool canal. He had a fractured skull and a massive head wound. Bizarrely, although he was found in the water fully clothed, Frobisher’s boots were missing.\n\nAlthough suspicion fell on Louie Gomersal initially, the police did not investigate further. At the inquest, Louie appeared and she stated that she had pawned John Frobisher’s boots. Had Frobisher walked to the canal with no boots on? He lived a quarter of a mile away from the canal, yet the inquest recorded a verdict of death by misadventure and it was assumed that he had simply drowned. Louie continued to live in Frobisher’s Mercy Street house until she was evicted a few months after his death for the non-payment of rent.\n\nAbove:Â Mercy Street, Leeds. The home of John Frobisher who was found dead in the Leeds-Liverpool canal on the 12th July 1922.\n\nArty Calvert, a poor night-watchman lived at 7, Railway Place in the Pottery Fields area of Hunslet, Leeds. In 1924, Louie went to live with Arty, ostensibly as his housekeeper, taking along her five year-old son Kenneth. Soon Louie and Arty were sleeping together and, after a while, Louie claimed that she was pregnant by him. Arty Calvert was old-fashioned and decided to do what he saw as being the right thing, so he offered to marry Louie. In the summer of 1925, the couple married in Hunslet, Leeds. Meanwhile, Louie managed to play out the deception that she was pregnant for some time. When no baby arrived. Louie initiated an elaborate web of lies. She wrote a note to herself, which she showed to the poor unsuspecting Arty, claiming it was from her sister in Ossett whom had invited her to stay during her confinement. After a brief visit to Ossett, she sent Arty a telegram to say that she had arrived, but in fact Louie had by then returned to Leeds.\n\nSomehow, to keep the deception going, Louie had to produce a baby and she did so by the simple means of advertising in the local Leeds paper, offering to adopt a newborn child. A teenager from Pontefract had recently given birth to a baby girl and her mother saw Louie’s advert in the paper. Giving birth to an illegitimate child in the 1920s was regarded much differently to today and there was great stigma attached to such events, which were all too common. Adoption provided a way out for the Pontefract girl and her mother. It didn’t take long to arrange for the baby girl, who had been named Dorothy, to be handed over to Louie Calvert. Pretending the little girl was hers, and to explain her absence, she told Arty that the newborn was in hospital.\n\nInstead of being at her sister’s home, Louie Calvert had actually taken up lodgings just two miles away from her husband’s house at Amberley Road, Leeds with 40 year-old widow, Mrs. Lily Waterhouse, a part-time prostitute and psychic, who to make ends meet rented out a spare room to working girls. Lily Waterhouse’s husband George had died aged 59 years about a year previously. She now lived in grinding poverty and squalor in the tiny rented terraced house with wooden boxes serving as tables, bare plaster walls and bare floorboards, except for newspapers under the mattress. Mrs. Waterhouse had been in poor health for some time and her post mortem revealed that she suffered with both scabies and body lice. Despite her ill-health, she survived mainly by prostitution and often entertained gentlemen back at the house. It was reported in one of the local newspapers by one correspondent that “she was suffering from a social disease”, which was a euphemism for some kind of venereal disease, although Lily’s post mortem didn’t substantiate this claim. It is easy for us to look critically at the morality of Lily Waterhouse, but these were very difficult times during a period of industrial unrest and staggering poverty. Making ends meet would have been difficult for a 40 year-old widow.\n\nAbove:Â Amberley Road, Wortley, Leeds, where Louie Calvert murdered Lily Waterhouse.\n\nLouie Calvert’s role was to act as some kind of maid servant or companion for Mrs. Waterhouse, though as we see later, they worked together as prostitutes. Unfortunately, the two women soon proved to be incompatible and to make matters worse Louie refused to do any housework, and then started stealing Lily’s bedding and crockery, which she pawned. Discovering the thefts, Lily Waterhouse went to the police in Leeds to complain that her belongings had been stolen. Detective-Sergeant John Holland was assigned to interview Mrs. Waterhouse on the 31st March 1926, and he was well aware of her minor notoriety. Proceedings were started against Louie Calvert for theft, but that same night Mrs Lily Waterhouse was murdered. The killing had been a brutal one involving aÂ “prolonged struggle before the knock out blow”Â and aÂ “penetrating wound down to the bone”Â at the back of the head prior to strangulation. Lily had also been tied up.\n\nSeveral neighbours heard the sound of a disturbance and loud banging from inside Mrs. Waterhouse’s house. Shortly after the commotion stopped, Louie left the house with the baby and was carrying a canvas bag with some crockery in it. One of the neighbours, a Mrs. Clayton commented to Louie that she had heard Mrs. Waterhouse making strange noises. Louie repliedÂ “Yes, I have left her in bed crying because I am leaving her.”Â Louie Calvert then caught the tram back to her marital home and her unsuspecting husband Arty.\n\nLater that evening a policeman called at Amberley Road to find out why Mrs. Waterhouse hadn’t returned to the police station to sign the complaint she had made against Louie Calvert. After hearing about the strange noises from the neighbours, the policeman obtained a key and let himself in. There he found Lily Waterhouse lying on her bed, with her hands tied, battered about the head and strangled to death. She was fully dressed, except for her boots, which were missing. There was no sign of a struggle and the dust in the room had not been disturbed, suggesting she had been killed elsewhere and carried to her room once dead. The killer had cut up some cloth to tie Lily’s hands and feet, yet there must have been something else used to strangle her because the ligature marks around her neck were wider than those caused by the strips of cloth.\n\nAt last Arty had his wife back, and also what he thought was his baby, little Dorothy. This was a brief happy time for the Calverts. Unknown to him and bordering on the unbelievable, Louie had gone back to Amberley Road at 5 a.m. the next morning and filled a large suitcase with the few possessions left in Lily Waterhouse’s home. Her compulsion to steal hadn’t been diminished by the horrors of the previous evening and by the murder of Lily Waterhouse. Several neighbours at Amberley Road had seen Louie Calvert leaving the house at 5:30 a.m. with a large suitcase. Arty Calvert was also surprised to see the suitcase, that had not been there the night before, in the downstairs room when he got up the next morning. Even more surprisingly, when she returned to Amberley Road to steal more things, Louie had left a note to say she was collecting items that had been given to her by Lily Waterhouse. Had she not done that, there is a real possibility that she could have escaped undetected. Lily Waterhouse’s neighbours had no idea who she was and she had only been at the house about three weeks.\n\nThe police in the form of Detective-Inspector Pass soon tracked down Louie Calvert and made their way to the marital home at Railway Place in Hunslet. When Louie opened the door, she was wearing Lily Waterhouses’s boots and scarf. Maybe this was an echo of something that happened four years previously when her then employer John Frobisher had been found face down in the Leeds – Liverpool canal with his head bashed in and also missing his boots. The police worked quickly and efficiently and found Lily Waterhouse’s few possessions in the house and in the suitcase. Louie was arrested, but crucially not charged until 24 hours later, which formed the basis of an appeal later on.\n\nRemanded in Armley Prison, and by now an ugly, wizened woman of 31 years without a tooth in her head, Louie was finally brought to trial at Leeds Assizes on the 6th and 7th May 1926, where, after a two-day court case, she was found guilty of the murder of Mrs. Lily Waterhouse. With the prisoner condemned by the jury, the judge Mr. Justice Wright, had few reservations about imposing the mandatory death sentence on the woman that stood in the dock before him. It was said that Louie Calvert received the notice of the death penalty with an air of calm indifference.\n\nDuring her incarceration, Louie Calvert was described as below by the prison authorities:\n\n“The prisoner has been known as a prostitute of a low type in Leeds for some years. She has a bad record of theft and house breaking that started from the age of 15. She has two illegitimate children aged 9 and 6 years. The prisoner is idle and of very dirty habits.”\n\nDetails of the trial are almost non-existent. Transcripts have not survived and there were no newspaper reports after the General Strike ended. Some information has been forthcoming from her Appeal, held on the 7th June 1926, which was fought on the grounds thatÂ “she was not charged within 24 hours after her arrest”Â and that during that time, she was subjected to an amount of questioning that exceeded what was allowable.\n\nThe appeal failed and the Lord Chief Justice responded thatÂ “nothing in the present case suggested that the police had gone beyond their duty.”Â He also felt that his summing up had been bothÂ “clear and fair”. He further commented thatÂ “Calvert did not give evidence, although her defence was that she was NOT the person who killed Mrs. Waterhouse.”Â Clearly, Lord Chief Justice failed to maintain a neutral attitude towards the fact that Louie waived her right to give evidence on her own behalf. He concluded the hearing by dismissing her appeal without calling upon the Crown to argue, and without legal obligation to consider the fact that 25 witnesses had appeared for the prosecution, whilst NONE had appeared for the defence. It seems likely that the Judge and the Defence deemed it likely that Louie Calvert was an unsuitable witness who would not make a good impression on the jury due to her social class, lack of education, personality and general demeanour.\n\nLouie’s final act of desperation was to tell one more lie in the court room in a last bid to save herself by claiming that she was pregnant. Whilst it was hard to find any redeeming features with Louie’s personality, there was plenty of opposition to her hanging. Mr. J. Lambert, a Leeds City Councillor who observed the trial declared that he wasÂ “full of pity for the poor woman, whether she was guilty or not. She was a thin, wan-looking creature only weighing a few stones. I should never legislate on the lines of hanging for women.”Â Meanwhile, Dr. Watts an MP, felt sufficiently concerned about Louie’s supposed pregnancy to raise the issue with the Home Secretary through a Parliamentary question. Sir William Joynson-Hicks, the Secretary of State answered that:Â “Any doubt which may have existed as to the prisoner’s condition has since been dispelled, and it is now certain that there was no pregnancy.”\n\nNevertheless, as the date of Louie’s execution drew nearer, strenuous efforts were made to obtain a reprieve. The Labour MP for Consett, the Reverend Sir Herbert Dunnico organised a petition, which was signed by 3,000 people, many from Louie’s home town of Ossett. There was also a motion for an address praying His Majesty the King to exercise his Royal Prerogative in the case of Louie Calvert, signed by six Labour MPs. However, it was all to no avail and Louie Calvert was moved to Strangeways Prison in Manchester to await her fate.\n\nWhilst awaiting her execution, Louie Calvert wrote her “Life Story”, which included her account of the events surrounding the death of Lily Waterhouse:\n\n“I got into the company of the young women with whose death I am charged. We used to go out at night and visit public houses with the intention of getting hold of any man who had money, to get them drunk, then rob them of any money they had left. The last Sunday I was there, this woman brought a man home supposed to be a soldier from Beckett’s Park hospital for wounded soldiers. After he had been there a few days we began to quarrel about him. She wanted him, and he wanted me, but I wanted neither. I wanted to leave them and go home again as it was beginning to get a little bit too hot. The detectives were on our tracks and we couldn’t go out without them pulling up and getting us fined.\n\nWell, on the Wednesday night, the day I was going to leave her, we went out and had a few drinks with this man and he fetched half a dozen pints of beer and stout home. After about half an hour we all started to quarrel and it got to fighting. Oh, the drink, it is the ruination of everything, for we do lots of things in drink and temper that we are most sorry for afterwards. Well he said something nasty to her and she landed out with her fist at him and they both rolled on the floor. When she got up and struck out again, I picked up the poker, which happened to be the nearest thing to me and my intention was to strike the man and make him leave off hitting her. Instead it struck her on the head through him dodging out of the road and she fell dead at our feet. He went mad and then got hold of a belt, strangled her and carried her upstairs. I got out and got home. God knows how I did it. I don’t.”\n\nLouie’s account makes it quite clear that a man was present at the killing. A Home Office memo confirmed that the legal teams at the trial had knowledge of the man being present at Amberley Road prior to her trial, a fact borne out by the neighbours of Mrs. Waterhouse who had seen the man. The police, when they visited Louie Calvert on the day after the murder, had found a piece of paper in her handbag with the (Canadian) address of a man called Crabtree and enquiry was made regarding the recent movements of a miner named Frederick Crabtree, who was an out-patient at Beckett’s Park hospital.\n\nDespite this evidence being provided by the Leeds police, when the Prison Governor passed Louie’sÂ “Life Story”Â to the Home Office after her conviction, a civil servant notedÂ “this is the first time the prisoner has told her story.”Â Fred Crabtree was actually summoned to appear in court as a witness, but he was never called.\n\nAbove:Â Strangeways Prison where Louie Calvert was hanged and where she was buried in an unmarked grave.\n\nLouie’s last request, before she was executed, was to see her 6 year-old son Kenneth and this was granted on her last afternoon when Arthur Calvert, her husband and Leah, her sister-in-law with young Kenneth all came to say goodbye. The meeting lasted half an hour and at the end, when the boy pathetically appealed to his mother to come home, he was told that she had to go to London to see the Queen.\n\nOn the 24th June 1926, the day of the execution at Strangeways Prison, a crowd of around 500 people gathered outside the prison walls. A little later than the usual time of 8 a.m. and upon a signal from the Prison governor, Thomas Pierrepoint, Britain’s most established hangman entered Louie’s cell, accompanied by two male prison warders. A woman warder told her to stand up and Pierrepoint took her arms and quickly strapped her wrists behind her back with a leather strap and then led the way out of the cell. Louie was led into the execution chamber and stopped whilst Pierrepoint marked out the letter “T” precisely over the divide of the trap doors. Pierrepoint’s assistant William Willis then put leather straps around her ankles and thighs. A white handkerchief was placed on her head, followed by a hood.\n\nPierrepoint slipped the safety pin out and the trap doors opened. Louie Calvert was dead in less than twenty seconds and at about nine o’clock, a strange hush fell upon a section of the crowd when a bell inside the prison began to toll in faint, ghastly tones to announce that the deed had been done.\n\nLooking back on all the evidence, it has to be said that there must be some serious doubts about Louie Calvert’s conviction for the murder of Lily Waterhouse. Was Fred Crabtree really the murderer? There was little sympathy from the Lord Chief Justice given her criminal past and her appearance. However, there seems little doubt from Louie’s confession in her condemned cell that she murdered John Frobisher in July 1922. Sadly, we shall never know the truth about what really happened at Amberley Road.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

Thomas had an older brother, William Henry. In 1867 he married Elizabeth Ashton at Louth in Lincolnshire. Some time between 1868 and 1870 he moved to Leeds and in the 1871 census he was recorded as being a chemist and druggist at 31 Stocks Hill. Thomas and Elizabeth had three children, John William Cussons was born in 1867 in Louth, Florence Cussons in Leeds and Alexander Cussons also in Leeds.\n\nIn 1880 he took over the chemist and druggist business of Richard Moore. He also took the position of postmaster at this time from Mr. Moore. He was already qualified as a chemist and druggist by examination.\n\nThe Ossett Observer reported at the time he had been working as a chemist in Louth, dispensing for doctors Sharpley & Higgins. I can find a Dr Sharpley in Louth in the 1860s but no Dr Higgins. In the 1861 and 1868 directories for that town there is no Cussons Chemist advertised so I assume he was working for another chemist before taking over his own business in Leeds. There was one chemist in Louth, Thomas Simons, who was also postmaster. Maybe Thomas worked for Mr Simons and learned his postmaster skills there too. By 1874 advertisements in the Leeds Mercury mentioned him as being at the Stocks Hill post office.\n\nIn his advertisement in the local press announcing his arrival in Ossett, he stated that he skilfully extracted teeth, as well as having:\n\n“a large and well assorted stock of patent medicines at reduced prices. A choice assortment of hair, tooth, nail, shaving, painters and other brushes. Also combs, toilet soaps, sponges, perfumery and other toilet requisites. The same quality tea and coffee, for which this establishment has so long been noted, will also be kept in stock, and may be relied upon. Agent for W & A Gilbey’s wines and spirits, also for Bass’s beers and Guinness’s stout”.\n\nApart from also producing his own baking powder, an essential requisite in those days. he provided veterinary medicines, which he would continue to make up from Mr. Moore’s own recipes. Â In the 1881 census, he is recorded as living in Dale Street with his wife, three children and servant Charlotte Robinson, aged 19 years.\n\nThe premises in which he took over Mr. Moore’s business were in Wesley Street, facing inwards towards the market place, roughly in front of where the Lloyds TSB bank now stands.Â In 1882, two years after moving there, he had to abandon his premises as they were compulsorily purchased by the Local Board of Health for the widening of Wesley Street and he moved business to the other side of the Market Place. Â The old premises were sold by auction on Monday, July 17th 1882 and it was reported that the energetic demolition of the old house commenced the same evening, for the recovery of the building materials. Â His address was nowÂ “Commercial Buildings”.Â Â About this time, he was also refused a beer licence and had to give up that part of his trade, which had been carried on a long time by Mr. Moore.\n\nMr. Cussons had three children, John William (b. 1867), Alexander Thomas (b. 1875) and Florence (b. c1870). In May 1889 it was announced that his son John William had passed the Pharmaceutical Society’s examination, and was now qualified to register as a chemist and druggist. He had been educated at Wakefield Grammar School, and commenced work in the post office in May 1882 as assistant to his father, a few months before their move of premises.\n\nIn 1892 Thomas Cussons retired his position as postmaster. Â He had seen 20 years of postmanship, the last twelve years of which were as a postmaster.Â For a while he had been running another chemist’s business in Swinton, near Manchester, with his son John William Cussons as partner. Â Â He now took the opportunity to move to take personal charge of that concern. Â Â John William Cussons took his place as postmaster, and was presented with a handsome pipe and a silver mounted walking stick by the staff of the Post Office. Â\n\nPictured Right:Â John William Cussons b. 1867.\n\nThe business in Ossett continued to trade under the name of Cussons & Son. This was to be an important year in the life of John, for on Wednesday 22nd June of that year he married his fiancÃ©e, Catherine Wilby at South Ossett Wesleyan Chapel. Â She was a daughter of woollen manufacturer Mark Wilby of Manor House, Manor Lane.\n\nBy the end of 1892 they were advertising that they had a large stock of chemical apparatus and pure chemicals:Â “important to chemistry students”.Â An illustrated price list was free on application.\n\nIt appears business was doing very well, for in April 1893 it was announced that Cussons had secured a site for building new premises for his shop and Post Office, on the corner of Prospect Road and the new Station Road. This was a new thoroughfare in the town, and was being rapidly developed. TheÂ “Dewsbury Reporter”Â at the time stated that it “was fast becoming the handsomest street in the Heavy Woollen district”.Â It was to be a grand building, with Mr. Cussons’ residence forming part of the building, his shop being on the corner, and Post Office business having a frontage of 27ft on to Station Road. A stone, Â carved with his entwined initials was to be set into the end wall. Â In early March 1894 the premises were occupied for the first time, the new Post Office opening on Tuesday, 6th March. Â On 22nd March, John William gave a dinner at the Coopers Arms to celebrate the opening of his fine new premises.\n\nIn 1895 John William was again applying to the Ossett Brewster Sessions to gain a licence to sell beer for consumption off the premises. Â However, it was pointed out that within 300 yards of his shop there were eleven licensed houses, of which four were fully licensed, the other seven being beer houses. On the grounds of the number of licences already issued in the area, his licence application was refused.\n\nIn 1897, John William Cussons was elected Hon. Secretary of the newly formed National Sub-Postmasters Association, however, after only two years in the position he announced at their annual conference that he would have to retire from the position and he was instead elected as vice- president. Â Two years later in October 1899 theÂ “Sub-Postmaster”, Â the official magazine of the National Federation of Sub-Postmasters, gave a portrait of John William, and biographical details. This portrait was reproduced in theÂ “Chemist and Druggist”Â journal, which also gave the information that Mr. Cussons was also a member of the executive of the Dewsbury & District Chemists’ Association. Â In June the following year he was the recipient of a beautiful marble timepiece, as a token of respect of the sub-postmasters for his services to the national federation.\n\nHowever, later that year it was announced that John William Cussons would be retiring his position. At the same time he was disposing of his business as a chemist and druggist. This was in consequence of having purchased the manufacturing drug business of Messrs. Sherratt & Co., of Harpurhey, Manchester. Â The latter had been amalgamated with a similar business in the same district belonging to his father, Thomas.Â The whole would be carried on as Cussons, Sons & Co., with John’s younger brother Alexander now being heavily involved in the family business. It was at this time that the Post Office in Ossett was to be separated from the family’s other business ventures and became independent. Â The Cussons business was to go from strength-to-strength, to become the household name of Imperial Leather we are now familiar with.\n\nOssett-Born Millionaire\n\nAt least one son of Ossett lived to become a millionaire, founding a firm which is known the world over. He was Alexander T. Cussons, younger son of Mr. T. T. Cussons, post-master and chemist, of Ossett Market Place. Father and son moved to Swinton, Lancashire where they began the manufacture of chemist’s products such as brilliantine and scented cachous, salts, etc.\n\nMr. A.T. Cussons expanded the business and took over a derelict factory at Kersal Vale, Manchester, which he turned into a modern factory covering 14 acres. He concentrated on the manufacture of high-class soaps, cosmetics and talcum powder which are sold all over the world under the brand name “Imperial Leather”.\n\nA nephew of W. Cussons is Mr. L.W. Cussons of Berry Lane, Horbury.Â\n\n“Ossett Observer Jubilee edition”,Â July 4th 1964:\n\nS. N. Pickard.\n\nIn November 1900 an advertisement appeared in theÂ “Ossett Observer”:\n\n“Mr. S. N. Pickard begs to announce that he has purchased the business of chemist and wine & spirit merchant, carried on successfully for many years by Mr. J. W. Cussons. Having had a large experience of the dispensing of medicines, analyses and pharmacy, he hopes to be accorded a fair share of the patronage from his many Ossett friends, and the public generally. The purest drugs and chemicals only employed. Patent medicines at lowest London prices. Note the address: S. N. Pickard, Member of the Pharmaceutical Society, Dispensing and Family Chemist, Station Road, Ossett”.Â Â\n\nSamuel Norman Pickard, a native of Ossett, was educated at South Ossett Church of England school, and then at Ossett Grammar School, when it stood on the site of the present Town Hall. Â As a committed Christian, Pickard became a Sunday School teacher. Â He served his apprenticeship with George Saville, chemist, in Wakefield when he was 16 and qualified as a chemist from the South London College Of Pharmacy then later became a member of the Pharmaceutical Society after passing their examination, which included Latin, Â in the spring of 1886.\n\nAfter this he went back to Mr. Saville for a short time as an assistant. He then moved on to become pharmaceutical dispenser at Clayton Hospital, Wakefield. Â Following this he took over the management of the business of Mr Handforth, chemist and dentist at 74 Manningham Lane, Bradford, around 1889 and subsequently acquired the business. He ran this business for 11 years before selling it to purchase the business of John William Cussons.Â Â\n\nIn March 1924 Mr. Pickard applied for transfer of his wines & spirits licence to new premises in Wesley Street, near to where the shop had stood, which Mr. Cussons had first taken when he moved to Ossett originally. The August 1st edition of theÂ “Ossett Observer”Â for that year carried the advert:\n\nâChange of premises: S. N. Pickard, chemist & optician, begs to announce that owing to expiration of lease he is transferring the business to larger and more commodious premises in Wesley Street, Ossett, which he hopes to open on Wednesday next, August 5thâ.\n\nThis building was built around 1880 by Mr. J. Hampshire-Nettleton who ran his butchers shop from there before moving into the Market Place. Later, the premises were used as the townâs first Labour Exchange, before Mr. Pickard took up occupancy.\n\nA little later, due to health reasons, he moved to Bridlington for a few years, but then moved back to Ossett shortly after war was declared. Â He celebrated his golden wedding anniversary on the 17th October 1943 at his home: The Knoll, West Wells Road. Â However, in November of the following year Pickard died in his 76th year. Â A photograph of Mr. Pickard was published in theÂ “Ossett Observer”Â after his death. Mr. Pickardâs daughter carried on the business until his grandson, Mr. Ian Pickard Rigg, came out of the army and became manager of the shop in 1955.\n\nMr. Rigg had in his possession books in which prescriptions were recorded which had been dispensed, from earlier days. The first book contained 1,994 prescriptions. Â The last entry bore the date 1872 and the stamp of C. H. Lockwood, chemist, Dale Street, Ossett.\n\nIn August 1963 the floor space was increased by 50% after alterations. Â A new modern dispensary was built in a back room, which was formerly used as a kitchen. Â Shelves were fitted in the shop and stocked supermarket style so that customers could serve themselves from the displayed products. The shop offered a fine selection of wines and Mr. Rigg often travelled abroad to choose them.\n\nThe company had bought the business of D. Haigh, chemist of 140 Dewsbury Road, but after five years of being open this branch had to close in December 1970. It had run at a loss for the previous two years, with the staff of two being reduced to one.\n\nMathew Marsh\n\nHe was born in York in 1866, but the majority of his days as a youth were spent in Normanton, where his father, Mr. William Marsh, was employed by Messrs. Henry Briggs, Son & Co, colliery proprietors. Â After he left Normanton National School,Â In 1881, Mathew Marsh took employment with Job & Carr, chemists, of Normanton and Wakefield. He stayed there until 1887 and for the last five years there, he was an articled apprentice. Â His father left Normanton to take up the position of deputy at Old Roundwood colliery in Ossett, and after living in Alverthorpe for a short while he moved to Ossett where he lived for 36 or 37 years before he died on “Peace Night” in 1918.\n\nAfter leaving Job & Carr’s, Matthew Marsh was employed for two years by Messrs. George Exley & Son, pharmaceutical chemists, Leeds, following which he became manager to Mr. John Day, chemist, Savile Town, Dewsbury. Â Â He was married in Leeds in 1891 to the daughter of an Armley builder, and shortly afterwards he moved to Great Stanmore in Middlesex, as manager to a chemist & druggist there. Â Â In 1895, he moved to Ossett where he commenced his business in Horbury Road,Â “Marsh’s Medical Hall”, opposite South Ossett Church, before moving to Victoria Buildings further along the road in 1900.\n\nDuring his residence in Ossett he took a keen interest in public matters, and associated himself with many useful movements of the day. He was a staunch churchman as a sidesman at South Ossett Church and he also sat on the church council.Â For several years he was Hon. Secretary of the South Ossett Working Men’s Institute, and a founder of the club in Belmont House. In gratitude for his services here he was awarded in 1906 a handsome marble clock and bronze ornaments.\n\nHe first took interest in local government matters in 1909 when he opposed Mr. Walter Townend, an ex-mayor, in the East Ward, and was returned by 398 votes to 192, a considerable victory. Â In 1912 he had a landslide victory, and since there were no elections during the Great War, he was not contested until 1919, when he was opposed by Mr. Alfred Renshaw, whom he defeated by 567 votes to 543, after the keenest contest in the history of the ward.\n\nMarsh always sat as an independent, not being affiliated to any political party. While in office his administrative skills were soon recognised and in 1914 he was elected Chairman of the Sanitary Committee in the town council. While he was involved in public affairs he worked tirelessly. He represented the corporation at the Royal Institute Congress at Birmingham, Folkestone and Newcastle, and his reports of these and other conferences on health matters were always interesting and instructive. Â He was prominent in connection with the organisation of the festivities in association with the coronation of King George V in 1911, and was in charge of the festivities at Southdale School, where the schoolchildren of the borough were entertained to tea. Â He was similarly active when the king and queen visited Ossett in 1912, and at the peace celebrations in 1919.\n\nDuring the Great War he proved himself a useful member of the Food Control Committee, and also acted as a Special Constable from October 1914 until the force was disbanded. His duties here included night patrol, where he would have been watching for air raids, and also the important matter of distributing butter and margarine. Â He was also a member of the Belgian Refugee Committee. Â It was these and other interests in public matters which eventually led to him being elected as Mayor of Ossett in 1921.\n\nZbigniew Franciszek Klatkiewicz was born in OporÃ³w, Poland on March 28 1922. He had dreamed of being a pilot ever since he was a child. But, as his dreams began to come true, World War II broke out and his family lost sight of him for over half a century.\n\nZbigniew Klatkiewicz’s war had begun whilst he was still a cadet at Szkola Podoficerow Lotnictwa dla Maloletnich (SPLdM), the Polish Air Force Non Commissioned Officer’s School for Minors. Prospective candidates were between the ages of 16 and 17 years and had to attend two days of rigorous examinations, be physically fit and possess the recognised aptitude required by the Polish Air Force (PAF). Zbigniew’s first year would likely have consisted of drill, physical training and formal learning of military regulations. By the end of the year the authorities would have selected those who would go forward for pilot training. Due to the pressure to train more pilots a satellite airfield was opened at the end of July 1939 and this is where Zbigniew Klatkiewicz was on September 1 1939 when Germany invaded Poland. At 6am almost thirty German airplanes attacked the school. It is reported that over 60 aircraft out of the 200 on the ground were destroyed and many others damaged. The bombs fell into the anti aircraft ditch, where the students had taken cover. The airfield was not prepared for defense – the only bomb shelter was badly disguised and the anti aircraft ditch was clearly visible from above. Thirty two were killed and many more were wounded. As a result of the attack, the Polish Air Force encouraged the students and their instructors to escape to England or France. The decision to evacuate was based on the notion that after the fall of Poland, its navy, soldiers and airmen would be needed in the defence of France and Britain.\n\nOn September 5 1939 SPLdM cadets, including 18 year old Zbigniew, set off from ModerÃ³wka to Warsaw, but on the way they were directed to Åuck (Lutsk) and from there to Sniatyn (both now located in the Ukraine) where there was a pre-war Polish border with Romania. In September 1941, Sniatyn came under German administration, but had previously been briefly under Romanian and then Hungarian control. Between September and December, hundreds of the town’s 3,000 Jews were murdered in death pits in the nearby forest. In April 1942 deportations began from the ghetto at Sniatyn to the death camp at Belzec. By September almost the entire Jewish population had been transported there and murdered.\n\nOn September 17 Zbigniew and the other cadets crossed the border and were interned. Almost all those interned in transit camps in Hungary and Romania escaped between the autumn of 1939 and the summer of 1940. The Hungarian and Romanian governments became anti-Polish while the people remained largely supportive and assisted in escapes. Conditions in the camps were very poor and medical support at best totally inadequate. The cadets managed to escape the camp, either by bribery or due to the lack of supervision by the guards. Many headed for the Polish Embassy in Bucharest where their photographs were taken, passports were made and forged visas under assumed names were issued. Zbigniew became ill with dysentery and so his escape from the camp was delayed. Once his health improved sufficiently, he secured for himself the necessary forged documents and eventually arrived, via Syria, in France.\n\nZbigniew was one of thousands of Polish servicemen who made their way to France. He said:Â “After six weeks they (the French) moved the Poles to Lyon, where they waited for further piloting instructions. However, it all went slowly and the French sent the Poles to the front as infantry with rifles from the Napoleonic era and with ten cartridges”. It was only later that Zbigniew wonÂ “a decent rifle after some German”. They retreated all the time in the direction of Toulouse, where he threw away everything he had. He was left with only a rifle, a haversack and a pouch. He walked from Lyon to Toulouse – a distance of over 400km. From Toulouse the Poles were driven to the Mediterranean. They had hoped that they would find a ship to take them onward, but they failed, making it necessary to move back through the Pyrenees to the Atlantic, where Zbigniew “managed to get on the penultimate ship from France to Africa”. The Germans tried to intercept the ship but failed and, after 10 days of sailing, Zbigniew managed to swim to Africa.\n\nThe first Polish pilots arrived in Britain on December 8 1939 and by the end of July 1940 the total of Polish airmen on British soil had reached 8,384. The Poles named Britain “Wyspa Ostatniej Nadziei” – “The Island of the Last Hope”. The British, like the French before them, were doubtful about the flying skills of the Polish pilots. But the fact that the British airmen were exhausted and the air force undermanned eventually overcame any reservations. It soon became clear to the British that the Poles were extremely skilled pilots and they quickly gained a reputation for being fearless to the point of recklessness.\n\nZbigniew Klatkiewicz arrived in England in 1941 and in May 1942 he graduated from RAF Henlow, Bedfordshire. During the war years, RAF Henlow became one of the largest RAF Maintenance Units in the country and was used to assemble the Hawker Hurricanes which had been built at the Hurricane factory in Ontario, Canada. After test flying in Fort William, they were disassembled and sent to Henlow in shipping containers and reassembled.\n\nOn May 25 1943 Zbigniew began combat training at RAF Finningley, Doncaster and graduated in August that same year. He was then incorporated into the 300th Squadron, a bomber squadron which was formed at Bramcote, Warwickshire on July 1 1940. During WW2 the RAF base was best known as the front line bomber command base and as a centre of excellence for training pilots and air crew. Robin Hood Airport now sits on the former site of RAF Finningley.\n\nZbigniew said:Â “I was very lucky. I made a lot of flights, until at the end of January 1944, my machine was shot badly, two engines fell on bombardment at one of the first airports, the machine fell apart. The whole crew went out, though no one was injured. Only I was crushed. I broke my left collarbone and a pair of ribs”. On March 20 1944 Zbigniew was sent toÂ “rest after combat flights”Â at an air base in Blackpool.\n\nBlackpool became the RAFâs largest training area during WW2. The Tower was requisitioned and had 10 feet removed to enable the fitting of a Radar Aerial. Another requisition was Burton’s, a Restaurant come Ballroom. This was used for testing Wireless Operator’s on their Morse Code â hence gone for a Burton. Stanley Park Municipal Airport, which is now Blackpool Zoo, opened in 1931.The airport was commandeered in 1939 by the Royal Air Force as No3 Technical Training School. Wellington Bombers were also assembled there. RAF Squire Gate, now Blackpool International Airport, was used as a fighter squadron base. It was also a training base. Hurricanes and Defiants were flown from here by British and Polish squadrons.\n\nAbove:Â Zbigniew Klatkiewicz aged 18 years with two other cadets.\n\nAfter a month of recuperation Zbigniew travelled to Scotland to RAF Evanton where he served as a staff pilot, tirelessly flying navigators into the air to train over the featureless mountains and lakes. The airfield was by the seashore of the Cormarty of Firth, 16 miles north of Inverness. From Scotland Zbigniew found himself assigned as staff pilot, instructor and test pilot to RAF Manby, Lincolnshire. RAF Manby was built as an Armament Training School and was responsible for training armament officers, bomb aimers, air gunners and armourers, using a variety of aircraft ranging from Hawker Hinds to Wellingtons.\n\nAfter the war fewer than 3,000 Poles returned to their homeland. 2,800 emigrated from the UK to other countries of residence, and 500, mostly flying personnel, joined the RAF.\n\nZbigniew’s parents, Marta and Marcin, didn’t know what had become of their son. He had simply vanished. They had spent many years looking for him with the aid of the Polish Red Cross (Polski Czerwony KrzyÅ¼ – PCK). Not until 1947 did the family learn that Zbigniew had survived the war and had settled in England.\n\nAfter a courtship which lasted at least two years, on Christmas Eve 1946 Zbigniew Klatkiewicz proposed to Marjorie Iseton. They were married in the Spring of 1947 in Sedgewick, Durham. Marjorie, born on July 29 1922, was the oldest of two daughters. Before her marriage she had been a typist. Her parents, Thomas and Ethel nÃ©e Dyke ran a draperâs shop, selling children’s clothing. Her younger sister Constance (born December 3 1923) worked in the shop with them.\n\nAbove:Â Zbigniew Klatkiewicz’s wedding to Marjorie Iseton in Spring 1947.\n\nIn January 1947, Zbigniew finally managed to establish contact with his family in Poland. After all of his previous letters had been “returned to sender”, he almost gave up hope of ever finding them. He was overjoyed to finally be in touch with everyone that everyone was “all right and healthy.” Zbigniew’s parents were still alive then. His father Marcin died in 1950 and his mother Marta in 1961.\n\nIn August 1948, Sergeant Pilot Zbigniew Klatkiewicz transferred to the Polish Aerospace Adaptive Corps (PRC) at RAF Hednesford, Staffordshire. He left military service in February 1949.\n\nZbigniew Klatkiewicz was awarded the Polish Order of the Virtuti Militari which recognises and rewards outstanding military valor above and beyond the call of duty. It is one of the oldest decorations for valor in the world and is equivalent to the US Medal of Honour and the British Victoria Cross. He was also awarded the Polish Cross of Valour (KrzyÅ¼ Walecznych) which is awarded to one who has demonstrated deeds of valor and courage on the field of battle. He also received: the Air Crew Europe Star, a medal awarded to Commonwealth aircrew who participated in operational flights over Europe from UK bases, between September 3 1939 to June 5 1944 (outbreak of war until the start of the D-Day Normandy Invasion), the 1939-1945 Star and the Defense and War medals.\n\nAlso in 1949 Zbigniew and Marjorie had their first son, Bernard who was born in Newcastle. By the summer of 1950 the family had moved to Wakefield where Zbigniew took a job in a bakery. They lived at 19 Duke of York Street, just off Jacob’s Well Lane. Their second son Paul was born in Wakefield in 1954. They then moved to Ossett where they opened a grocery shop at the junction of Dale Street and Church Street. “Klat’s”.\n\nZbigniew did plan to visit his family in Poland, but he was discouraged by the political situation. It’s certainly no coincidence that he waited until September 1991 to visit his sister in PoznaÅ, with Marjorie and his granddaughter. 1991 saw the first parliamentary elections since the fall of communism and Soviet troops started to leave Poland. All the family were awaiting his arrival in OstrorÃ³g and, as he greeted his sister Jadwiga, Zbigniew who was 69 years old, was overcome with emotion. He hadn’t seen her since he was 17. There was a huge celebration at the Mercure Hotel, after which he then travelled on to the home of his nephew where he greeted his relatives whom he had not seen for over 50 years. He had been there only two hours when he was taken ill and a doctor had to be called. Dr Tadeusz Tanalski diagnosed a heart attack. An ambulance took Zbigniew to the hospital in SzamotuÅy where he stayed for almost three weeks. However, his broken heart could not be cured.\n\nAbove:Â The last picture of Zbigniew Klatkiewicz during a visit to Poland in 1991, here greeting his sister Jadwiga whom he had not seen for over 50 years.\n\nZbigniew Klatkiewicz died on September 21 1991 in the SzamotuÅy hospital. Marjorie flew his Zbigniew’s coffin back to England where he was buried at the cemetery in Newark on Trent, Nottinghamshire with other Polish airmen from 300 Squadron. Sadly, the Polish Air Force’s 300 Squadron suffered the highest number of deaths of any Bomber Command unit.\n\nThe family in Poland cherish the memory of their uncle and they tell their children about Zbigniew Klatkiewicz, who left his home in OporÃ³w in 1938. And how, in 1991 when Poland was a free state, he returned to his homeland to die among his own people.\n\nReferences:\n\nhttp://irenakuczynska.pl/sierz-pil-zbigniew-klatkiewiczlotnik-dywizjonu-300-po-53-latach-spotkal-sie-z-rodzina-peklo-mu-serce/\n\nhttp://www.polandinexile.com/bartkowiak.html\n\nhttps://www.iwm.org.uk/history/the-polish-pilots-who-flew-in-the-battle-of-britain\n\nhttps://youtu.be/_BXTc034JTw\n\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/southyorkshire/content/articles/2005/03/03/i_love_sy_finningley__history_feature.shtml\n\nhttp://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/80011870\n\nhttps://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/research/online-exhibitions/taking-flight/pathway-to-pilot/second-world-war.aspx\n\nhttps://feefhs.org/index.php/resource/poland-virtuti-index-k1\n\nhttps://rememberourdead.weebly.com/poland.html\n\nhttp://www.polandinexile.com/escape.html\n\nMay 2019\n\nIn 1931 a new vicar, the Reverend George H. Marshall was taking up residence at the Holy Trinity vicarage on Dale Street, Ossett. Few in town knew then, or even now, of his connection to Baron Manfred von Richthofen, aka the Red Baron; the Prussian aristocrat who was said to be the deadliest flying ace of World War I.\n\nOn July 15 1889, George Herbert Marshall was born at Old Royd, Heptonstall, situated in the hillside above the Calder Valley, and he was baptised at St James’s Church, Heptonstall on September 17th that same year.\n\nGeorge was the fourth of five sons born to Richard Marshall and Annie Elizabeth Gomm who had married on Christmas Day 1882. Whilst their sons flourished, Clara, their only daughter, died in 1888 before she reached her first birthday.\n\nIn 1892 George’s father moved his family to Bankfoot House, Hebden Bridge, where he set up in business as a corn dealer. As the boys grew older, two of them in particular: George and his youngest brother, Norman attracted the attention of the Reverend Sidney Marshall Smith, who was then the vicar of Hebden Bridge and he encouraged them to enter the ministry.\n\nGeorge matriculated at the University of Manchester and, in 1912; he took his Bachelor of Arts degree. A year later he became a Master of Arts. He studied for Holy Orders at Egerton Hall, a new theological college in Manchester, and in 1913 he became a deacon, licensed to the curacy at Kirkburton, Huddersfield. The following year he qualified as a priest.\n\nDuring his time at university, George had been recruited by its Officer Training Corps. In the first sixth months or so of WW1 over 20,000 officers and more than 12,000 other ranks were recruited from British universities. On May 13th 1915 George was commissioned as a Chaplain of the Armed Forces with the rank of captain. On July 15th 1915, instead of celebrating his 26th birthday, George embarked on the journey to Gallipoli with the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force. According to the requirements of King’s Regulations, his role was toÂ “conduct the army’s compulsory religious services and bury its dead.\n\nThe Army Chaplain\n\nOn August 23rd George joined the British 13th (Western) Division. Up to then he had, for the most part, been acting as chaplain to one of the hospital ships, with the Australian troops, and had been in the trenches with them until he was taken ill with enteric and dysentery.\n\nWhen the troops were evacuated from Gallipoli on January 8th â 9th, 1916, George went with them. He was still attached to the 13th Division and was with them throughout the Mesopotamia campaign. The British Army in Mesopotamia would grow to about 440,000 men with almost three quarters of those who fought from the Indian Army. The 13th Division was sent to relieve Kut al-Amara in Iraq and it was during this journey that George spotted a wounded officer laying out in the open and in obvious imminent danger.\n\nFor more than an hour, using an entrenching tool, George worked to build a protective shield over him; all the while in full view of the enemy. A bullet struck the shield but all that George said was:Â “Not this time Brother Turk”. The officer he was protecting stated that it was a mystery to him how George escaped being hit.\n\nThe relief force never reached the British troops at Kut al-Amara who were, by then, starving and desperately running low on ammunition. The British Army did make several attempts to lift the siege but all were unsuccessful and on April 29th 1916, after 147 days, they surrendered to the Turks. At that time, it was the longest siege in British Army history.\n\nAbove:Â The Marshall family, circa 1910.Â Left to Right:Â Amos, mother Elizabeth, William, Norman, father Richard, George, Thomas.\n\nAt home in Hebden Bridge, in May 1916 Richard Marshall received a letter from his son George saying that he was in hospital with fever. George had contracted typhoid and was hospitalised in India from where he was subsequently sent home to England.\n\nGeorge then spent time at the Third London General Hospital in Wandsworth. The hospital had been the Royal Victoria Patriotic School but was requisitioned in August 1914 by the War Ministry and the children transferred to local houses nearby. There is no record of George having been the chaplain of this hospital which leads me to deduce that he was there as a patient.\n\nI have to wonder if this is where he first met Irene Carruthers, his future wife, who was by this time a qualified nurse. The medical staff were seconded from the Middlesex Hospital, St Mary’s Hospital and University College Hospital. It is quite possible that Irene could have been among those seconded.\n\nUpon leaving Wandsworth, George took a post as chaplain at the Guards Training Depot at Caterham in Surrey. In the London Gazette of December 22nd 1916 George wasÂ “mentioned in despatches”Â for his heroic actions in Mesopotamia. British commanders-in-chief of a theatre of war or campaign were obliged to report their activities and achievements to the War Office in the form of despatches, which were published in The Gazette.\n\nOn April 25th 1917, George was summoned to Buckingham Palace where King George V invested him as a Companion of the Distinguished Service Order. The DSO is awarded for meritorious or distinguished service by officers of the armed forces during wartime, typically in actual combat, serving under fire, and usually awarded to those above the rank of captain.\n\nIn October 1917, George was stationed in France, as the chaplain to the GHQ Machine Gun School in Wisques. The British Expeditionary Force had established the school three years earlier to train new regimental officers and machine gunners.\n\nFrom there George joined the Royal Flying Corps, 101 Squadron at Bertangles as their chaplain. The RFC had formed at Farnborough on July 12th 1917 and it was only two weeks later that it moved to France to operate as a night bomber squadron.\n\nThe Red Baron\n\nBaron Manfred von Richthofen was born on May 2 1892, into an affluent Prussian family. Growing up in the Silesia region of what is now Poland, he led a life of privilege playing sports, riding horses and hunting wild game. Under the instructions of his father, he was enrolled in military school at the age of eleven. Shortly before he turned 18, he was commissioned as an officer in the German cavalry.\n\nAfter the outbreak of WWI, the Baron served on both the Eastern and Western Fronts and he was awarded the Iron Cross for his daring trips, carrying messages along the front lines. In 1915, he transferred to the German air corps, initially serving as an observer and later as a pilot. He crashed during his first solo flight, but his determination eventually caught the attention of Germanyâs top ace, Oswald Boelcke, who recruited him for a new fighter squadron.\n\nThe Baron claimed his first confirmed aerial victory on September 17 1916. Over a period of 17 months he shot down 80 allied aircraft, though some historians believe the unofficial total to be closer to a hundred. He once said,Â “I never get into an aircraft for fun. I aim first for the head of the pilot, or rather the head of the observer, if there is one.”\n\nThe Baron’s victims were members of the Royal Flying Corps, many of whom were boys, often with barely a dozen flying hours under their belts. The RFC was soon known asÂ âthe suicide clubâÂ because pilots were only in the air for a maximum of 11 days before they were shot down. The Baron said that the English pilots wereÂ “dare devils personified and that their intrepidness made them foes to be respected”.\n\nIn January 1917 the Baron was given command of the German squadron Jasta 11. He celebrated the promotion by painting his Albatross biplane red, soon becoming known as The Red Baron. He is reported to have said:Â “I want them to see me. And I want them to be afraid.”Â He decorated his walls with the serial numbers of the aircraft he shot down and had a jeweller make him a small silver cup engraved with the date and make of each aircraft. He would eventually acquire sixty cups before a silver shortage eventually put a stop to his commemorative trophies. But the killing continued.\n\nThe Red Baron was eventually shot down whilst chasing a British fighter pilot. In 1997, almost 80 years after his plane was brought down, it was claimed that British flier Captain Tilden Thompson was the pilot who had deliberately lured the German ace into his final dogfight. By flying a two seater spotter plane low over German lines as a decoy, Captain Thompson is said to have set the trap.\n\nOfficially, the death of the Red Baron was credited to Canadian pilot Captain Roy Brown. With an advance in ballistics and forensics, it is now considered by some military historians that the Red Baron was actually killed by an Australian machine gunner, firing from the ground.\n\nLewis gunners attached to the 3 Squadron Australian Flying Corp were firing at the Red Baron when his machine spun to earth. Although he was shot in the torso the Baron still managed to land his plane but soon died from his wounds.\n\nOn April 21 1918, the Allies recovered the body of the Red Baron from a field in Vaux sur Somme, France. Captain George Herbert Marshall was still serving as chaplain to the Royal Flying Corps 101 Squadron at the time that the Red Baron was shot down. He was the closest Anglican chaplain to the scene and, as the Baron was a protestant, George was given the duty of officiating at his burial.\n\nA crowd of soldiers and several townspeople gathered around as a eulogy was given by George, and then the coffin was lowered into the grave. The brass plate on the coffin said that Baron von Richthofen was killed in action and that he was 25 years old. A firing party, made up of Australian forces, fired three volleys and a bugler sounded the last post.\n\nYou can seeÂ rare film footageÂ that shows Rev George Herbert Marshall walking at the head of the funeral procession and carrying out the service which took place with full military honours by clicking on the picture above.\n\nAfter WW1\n\nRev. George Marshall later proceeded to the 18th Division, where he remained during the allied retreat of March 1918 and the subsequent victorious advance. Demobilisation began on December 10 1918 and by March 1919 the division ceased to exist.\n\nAs well as the DSO, George was awarded the Victory and British Medals and the 1915 Star. After the war, George returned to Kirkburton and to his wife, Irene. At the age of 28, George had married 36 year old Irene at Westminster St James the Less. At the time of their marriage, on February 5 1918, Irene gave her address as 165 Vauxhall Bridge Road, Pimlico, just five minutes from St James’s. Home on leave from the war, George’s address was “Ivy Bank”, Hebden Bridge.\n\nIrene was the daughter of Scotsman, Rev George Thomas Carruthers MA, and his second wife Elizabeth (nee Cartwright). Rev Carruthers had been a senior chaplain in the Bengal Ecclesiastical Establishment and several of Irene’s siblings were born in India. Irene was born in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk on November 20th 1881.\n\nBy the time she was 18, both of her parents had died and Irene, with her sister Mabel and their brother Vincent, had moved to Edinburgh where Vincent was studying medicine. But the three siblings were soon separated when Mabel died in 1908 at the age of 31. In 1909 Vincent married and then joined the Royal Army Medical Corps and went to serve in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). In 1911 Irene enrolled as a student nurse at the East Suffolk and Ipswich Hospital, Anglesea Road, Ipswich.\n\nIn June 1919 Rev George Herbert Marshall MA, DSO became the curate at St Matthew’s, the Anglican Parish Church of Burnley. He and Irene had been there for less than a year when, in early 1920, George was offered the office of the Vicar of Shelley, a church connected to that at Kirkburton. The vacancy arose when Rev Hay, who had been at Shelley Church for twenty years, moved to Gawthorpe.\n\nGeorge was said to have taken a deep interest in the social side of church work and had a strong connection with the Young Men’s Institute. He had also earned the respect of his parishioners and they were sorry to see him move on. He didn’t want them to think that he was keen to leave and explained that the Vicar of Kirkburton and the Bishop of Wakefield were anxious that he should accept the new place at Shelley. George accepted the office and, at Easter that year, he left Lancashire and, with Irene, returned to Yorkshire.\n\nOn March 7th 1922, whilst at Shelley, George and Irene’s son was born; they named him George Carruthers Marshall.\n\nGeorge was the Vicar of Shelley for three years, until June 1 1923, when he was inducted as the Vicar of St Augustine’s Church, Pellon, Halifax. Traditional parish life at St Augustine’s was apparently in decline by this time but, with George’s natural enthusiasm and energy and the support of his wife Irene, the church gradually began to regain something of its former prosperity. Almost a decade after he first arrived, the Easter Sunday Service saw the largest congregation it had had for a quarter of a century, which was further testament to George’s determination and tenacity.\n\nAlong with his role as Vicar of St Augustine’s, George acted as chaplain to Alderman Robert Thomas who was the Mayor of Halifax in 1923-24. Both men were strong supporters of missionary work and, whilst at St Augustine’s, George was the Chairman of the Halifax Auxiliary of the Church Missionary Society\n\nOssett\n\nDuring his time in office at St Augustine’s, George was offered the living at Holy Trinity Church, Ossett but he chose to not accept it. He remained at St Augustine’s for eight years until July 1931 when he was again offered the living at Holy Trinity Church in Ossett. This time George did accept the offer and he moved with Irene, George, and his widowed mother Annie Elizabeth, to the Vicarage on Dale Street.\n\nRev. G.H. Marshall is mentioned many times in local newspapers in connection with births, deaths and marriages at Holy Trinity Church. In May 1936, the Rev. G.H. Marshall was mentioned in the Ossett Observer for something entirely different.\n\nHoly Trinity Church was built in 1866 and the total of the construction costs was more than Â£20,000. Today’s equivalent value is over one and a half million pounds so it’s hardly surprising that 70 years after it was built there was still a deficit of Â£200 (now just shy of Â£10,000). A fund was established to raise the Â£200 needed to pay off the debt.\n\nTo raise fund, Rev George Marshall volunteered to sit in the west end of the church for 24 hours between Friday and Saturday midnight and people took or sent their gifts to him. George had to break off during the day to perform two weddings and the congregation at each contributed generously to the fund. In total 580 people contributed to this novel way of raising funds for the church.\n\nThose who donated included many non-church people and many prominent Nonconformists. The first gift of a shilling was received from an unemployed man and the last came by post from Staincliffe. After 22 hours the total stood at Â£170. Mayor Gladstone Moorhouse, who was also the church warden, arrived with over Â£25 which he had collected from friends. Shortly afterwards the Â£200 mark was passed and at midnight the total had reached Â£225.\n\nWith the help of his friends, George had achieved his goal!\n\nGeorge was in the newspaper again in September 1936. This time he was explaining why he believed that the lack of trees in the town was connected to the lack of Ossett weddings almost two decades later. During WW1, Ossett’s many mills had used sulphuric acid in the process of making military uniforms. George explained how the acid which spewed from the mills killed off the trees in Ossett, leaving the town with noÂ “Lover’s Lane”Â and no leafy parks, turning the town intoÂ “a cheerless, romance discouraging waste, in which the marriage bells are virtually silent.”Â George said that the amount of marriages at Holy Trinity Church in 1936 was almost zero. He was reported as saying that he had beenÂ “prodding”Â the Afforestation department of the Ministry of Agriculture to plant some trees inÂ “the one treeless town in Yorkshire”.\n\nGeorge and Irene left Ossett in 1943. In 2001, his son, George Carruthers Marshall remembered his father telling him:Â “They (3 Squadron Australian Flying Corp) gave my father a cylinder from von Richthofen’s engine, which he kept in a tin box, wrapped in a sack. When he went back into the Army in WW2 he had to leave his Vicarage, so he donated the cylinder to the War Effort Scrap Drive!!!!”\n\nSteel and iron were in short supply and so 1943 saw the start of a national drive to collect scrap metal. By recycling unused or unwanted metal the government could build ships, aeroplanes and other equipment needed to fight the war. How ironic then that the Red Baron, indirectly, contributed to the building of Allied aeroplanes.\n\nOn October 9 1943 George was appointed as Army Chaplain to the Wireless School at Forest Moor near Harrogate. The establishment was part of a network of British signals intelligence collection sites which tracked and intercepted German radio transmissions. This information was so sensitive that it was taken by motorcycle riders directly to Bletchley Park, home of the famous Enigma; the encoder used by the Germans to encrypt secret messages.\n\nGeorge served at Forest Moor until July 5th 1945 when he became the vicar of St Paul’s Church in Alnwick, Northumberland.\n\n1949\n\nGeorge returned to Ossett, and to Holy Trinity Church, to officiate at the wedding of his son, George Carruthers Marshall, and Ann, the daughter of his old friend Gladstone Moorhouse, on April 21st 1949, which was the 31st anniversary of the death of the Red Baron.\n\nRight:Â The Vicarage, Dale Street, Ossett.\n\nThe Yorkshire Post, dated Friday April 22nd 1949, reported the wedding, saying that the bridegroom had served in the RAF during WW2 and, at the time of his marriage to Ann, was employed on the Duke of Northumberland’s estate where he was engaged in forestry. Perhaps he was inspired by his father?\n\n1949 was a year for celebration, but it was also a year for mourning when, on September 13th, George’s wife, Irene, was found dead on the lawn at St Paul’s Vicarage, Alnwick. At an inquest their son George gave evidence, saying that his mother had carried some carpets to the front lawn to be cleaned with a vacuum cleaner. At first it was thought by a maid that Irene had merely fainted. George went out and found her, lying on her back. She was dead and the cleaner was still running. The pathologist’s report stated that death was due to cerebral haemorrhage.\n\nThe last mention in the newspapers of George was a small notice, announcing his death in 1953.\n\n“MARSHALL – January 6, aged 63 years, the Rev George Herbert Marshall, of St Paul’s Vicarage, Alnwick, Northumberland, sometime Vicar of St Augustine’s, Halifax and Holy Trinity, Ossett. Service at St Paul’s Church, Alnwick on Friday at 2pm: interment Alnwick Cemetery 2:30pm”.\n\nThanks to Margaret Nettleton for this family picture, which shows a family wedding party in 1931 with theÂ Rev.

Kendallâs architectural achievements in Ossett but the story of this remarkable manâs life has never before been researched. Until now the story of this man who arrived in Ossett aged five years old has remained untold. This is the story of a kind, modest, understated man who led a most extraordinary life.\n\nUntil now this is what we didnât know about the life of W.A.Kendall, Architect and Surveyor.\n\nA nephew awarded the Military Cross in WWI who later co-designed the Ossett War Memorial; a niece who was mentioned in despatches and was the first Ossett woman to serve overseas in The Great War.Â A widowed father whoÂ went away with a lady, an uncle who was an embezzler, two nephews killed in action in The Great War and a great nephew who was awarded the Military Cross in WWII and who was subsequently awarded the M.B.E.\n\nWilliam Arthur Kendall. His Ossett Legacy.\n\nWilliam Arthur Kendall lived in Ossett for 75 of his 80 years.Â By the age of 24 years in 1881 he was a respected architect with an office on Bank Street. His services and skills were much in demand. In spite of his reputation at that time surprisingly little is known about William Arthur Kendall and those close to him. In the 1880âs and 1890âs he changed the streetscape of the town in which he lived for 75 of his 80 years.\n\nThis is his remarkable and unparalleled legacy to Ossett.\n\nThe Conservative ClubÂ New Street.(openedÂ 1881)\n\nTheÂ Temperance HallÂ Illingworth Street (opened\n\n1888Â The Mechanicsâ Institute & Technical SchoolÂ Station Road (openedÂ 1890Â latterly Ossett Library)\n\nThe Hannah Pickard FountainÂ (opening ceremony\n\n1893Â The Liberal ClubÂ (openedÂ 1893Â – formerly the British Railway Staff Association and latterly the Railway Club)\n\nThe Post Office and Chemistâs shopÂ at the junction of Prospect Road and Station Road (openedÂ 1894Â & known as Cussons and latterly the Yorkshire Bank),\n\nThe Infectious Diseases HospitalÂ Storrs Hill.(openedÂ 1894\n\nThe GablesÂ Station Road (lateÂ 1899-1900)\n\nSouthdale Council SchoolÂ Southdale Road (openedÂ 1908)\n\nWhat did late 19th century Ossett think of William Arthur Kendallâs architectural style?\n\nStation Road was built in the late 1880âs joining the Market Place to Park Square. In 1894 the Ossett Observer reportedÂ âGood stone buildings have arisen along both sides, and such is the impetus given to the adoption of a more ornamental style of architecture in the erection of new business premises that the appearance of the centre of the borough is altogether changed for the better…..â\n\nOn 4th FebruaryÂ 1919Â a war weary Ossett held a public meeting at the Town Hall to discuss how the town might remember its fallen heroes in The Great War 1914-1918.Â William Arthur KendallÂ spoke passionately about the need to ensure that whatever was done should be done for the benefit of those who had suffered and their dependants. He proposed that land be acquired on whichÂ to erect 50 or 60 cottages in picturesque blocks, as a miniature garden village for the benefit of the victims of the war, with a club room.\n\nNotwithstanding strong support for Mr. Kendallâs proposal a vote was taken and the proposal for a public park with a public building such as a library or art gallery was carried by 45 votes to 34. This was not to be the end of the Kendall familyâs connection with theÂ Ossett War Memorial.\n\nHis early life and family 1857 – 1880\n\nWilliam Arthur KendallÂ was born in Leadenham, Lincolnshire in spring 1857 the eldest son and third child of eight children born to schoolmasterÂ Stephen H. KendallÂ (1830-?) and his wifeÂ EmmaÂ (nee North) who married at Leeds Minster and Parish Church of Saint Peter-at-Leeds in August 1853.Â Â Stephen KendallÂ rarely used his middle name, whereas his brother was known by most asÂ William Holliday KendallÂ (1838- 1913), both schoolmasters, and the only sons of schoolmasterÂ William KendallÂ (1804-1891) and his wife, Ann (nee Holliday).\n\nWilliam Arthur Kendallâs father, schoolmaster Stephen, lived something of an itinerant existence flitting from school to school. In 1851 he was Tutor at Bridlington Parsonage.Â Married Â in August 1853, their first child, Clara Ann was born in Tadcaster in 1854 and was baptised there in October 1854.Â In summer 1855 the coupleâs second child, Agnes Louisa, was born in Luddenden where he was master of the National school. Sadly their first child, Clara Ann, died and was buried there in November 1856. By spring 1857 the couple had moved to Leadenham, Lincolnshire where William Arthur was born. Stephen was both post master and schoolmaster there and working alongside his wife who was school mistress. He earned Â£20 a year to teach 20 poor children.\n\nThe couple and their two surviving young children were soon on the move again and on 18 July 1858Â William Arthur KendallÂ was baptised at Tadcaster where Stephenâs father, William, had been a schoolmaster for at least ten years. By early April 1861 Stephen had taken a position of schoolmaster at York Walmgate whilst his father, William was living with his wife and their grand daughter, Agnes Louisa at Chapel Street Tadcaster. 1861 was an interesting year for the Kendall family. Stephen applied to join the local police force at Tadcaster and was admitted on 11 April. He resigned twelve days later. We learned that he was 31 years and 10 months old, 5â8 inches tall with a fresh complexion, grey eyes and black hair. In spring 1862Â Stephen Kendall, his wife Emma and their four children, aged seven years or under, made their way toÂ OssettÂ and a new home at Little Townend. Â Stephen took up a position at Ossett Free (Grammar) School and subsequently became Headmaster. His tenure was not to be without controversy.Â By 1871 at Little Townend the couple had three more children who were born in Ossett Â between summer 1863 and 1866.The family was complete.\n\nBy 1866, Stephenâs brother,Â William Holliday KendallÂ had journeyed with his father,Â William, toÂ Horbury. Both men were schoolmasters living in adjacent homes on Old School Road, Horbury. In December 1869 William Holliday Kendall married widow Amelia Elizabeth Earle in Lambeth and two years later they were living on Old School Road Horbury. His father and mother were living next door; both men were schoolmasters. Â The extended family was complete and local. What possibly could Â go Â wrong?\n\nÂ In 1880 almost 20 years after Stephen and his family arrived in Ossett they were living at the Masterâs house, Ossett Old Grammar School in the Market Place, adjacent to Dale Street. Tragedy struck in early February 1880 when William Arthurâs mother, Emma, died aged 55 years. His 21 year old brother, Walter Augustin, died six weeks later in mid March 1880. Mother and son were buried at Holy Trinity Church. A year later William Arthur, by this time 24 years of age and an Architect, was living with three of his sisters and their widowed father, Stephen aged 50 years. Worse was to come.\n\nAbove: Ossett Free School (aka Old Grammar School)in the Market Place\n\n1881 Disturbing and turbulent times\n\nBy early 1881 Stephenâs brotherÂ William Holliday Kendall, eight years his junior had worked in Horbury as assistant overseer, schoolmaster, collector to the Local Board, surveyor and inspector of nuisances. In March and April 1881 he was examined, tried and, onÂ 6th May 1881,Â Â convicted of defrauding the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company of Â£158 11s on two occasions in November and December 1876. This is equivalent in current (2020) values to almost Â£37,000.Â He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to six months imprisonment with hard labour which he served at Wakefield and Leeds HMP.Â\n\nIn a sign of those times His Lordship summed up at the trial revealing that he had the greatest reluctance to class with common prisonersÂ a man in the position of the prisonerÂ …… Two men who were tried on the same day as William Holliday Kendall was sentenced to six months for stealing Â£37,000 were each sentenced to 12 months. One man had stolen four shirts. The other man had stolen two geese. Sauce for the goose was plainly not sauce for the gander.\n\nWhat ofÂ Stephen Kendall? Itâs fair to suppose that the events of 1880, when he lost his wife and a child, would have caused Stephen and his children not a little torment. The imprisonment of his brother in 1881 and the shame to him and the repercussions for headteacher Stephen and his family may have been too much. William Arthur Kendall also had architectural contracts in place or pending and Victorian Ossett and Horbury might consider there was more than one bad apple in the Kendall barrel. Worse was to come.\n\nOn 1st June 1881 the Police Gazette issued the following notice seeking the whereabouts ofÂ Stephen Kendall, Master, Ossett Grammar School.\n\nWanted, on warrant, for embezzlement:- STEPHEN H. KENDALL, 50 years of age, 5 feet 8 inches high, dark complexion, dark brown hair and whiskers, turning grey, very stout, of drunken habits, and fond of low company: dressed in dark grey suit, and high hat; a schoolmaster, good address, and last residence Ossett Grammar School. Information to Mr. Supt., Airton, Dewsbury, Yorkshire â Bow-street,May 30.\n\nOn 12 November 1881 the Batley Reporter and Guardian reported;-\n\nTHE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD. â on Thursday, at the Dewsbury County Court,Â Mr. Burton, solicitor, made an application on behalf of the Wakefield and Barnsley Banking Company, that the service at the house of Stephen Kendall, schoolmaster, Ossett, might be declared sufficient, personal services being impossible on account of his continued absence. He said that Kendall had left household furniture to the value of about Â£100, besides shares in a building society.- The Judge asked if Kendall was keeping out of the way to avoid service?- Mr. Burton replied that he could not say so, he had gone away with a lady, and there was reason to believe he would not return.- The Judge observed that he could not grant the application under the circumstances.\n\nIn 1881 Mr.Thomas Burton, solicitor and Stephen Kendall , schoolmaster, were near neighbours on Dale Street.Â At that time Mr. Burton was also the clerk to the Ossett Local Board.Â Â\n\nSo it seems that Ossett and Stephen Kendall had parted company for good. Stephen would forfeit reputation and his position as Master of Ossett Grammar School. I suppose we shall never know if he left with the best wishes of the family he left behind, but there is little doubt that his six surviving children, including William Arthur Kendall, would be left to pick up the pieces.\n\nÂ This was 1881 and a scandal of immense proportions at a time when William Arthur was embarking on a career as an architect. His first commission, the design of Ossett Conservative Club came to fruition when it was built in this year. His next Ossett architectural commission was a long seven years hence when the Ossett Temperance Hall was opened on Illingworth Street in 1888.\n\nOssett was a small community and this would surely have been the talk of the town. Anyone who had or knew a child in secondary education would know, or speak of the circumstances.Â Even the main characters in the unravelling story were known to each other.\n\nFive years earlier the Wakefield Coroner, Mr. Thomas Taylor held an Inquest at The Fleece Inn, Spa Street, Ossett on Wednesday 26 July 1876. The Inquest was to hear into the death by shooting of a local man, John Gosney, from Spring End. Mr. Thomas Burton, solicitor, watched the proceedings on behalf of Joseph Lightowler who was being held in custody having been apprehended on suspicion of murder. Superintendent Airton was also present on behalf of the police. Stephen Kendall was the\n\nforeman of the jury who, after four hours deliberation returned a verdict that John Gosney had been accidentally shot. Two days later at Dewsbury Courthouse it was determined that, in view of the Inquest, no further evidence would be offered and Joseph Lightowler went free.\n\nAs fate would have it three years later in November 1879 Joseph Lightowler of Haggs Hill died in Clayton Hospital following an underground fall of coal at Roundwood Colliery. Mr. Thomas Taylor was the Coroner. Devine Retribution or plain misfortune?\n\n1882 – 1910. The best of times; the worst of times. Marriage, death and more desertion.\n\nIn early 1888 his married sister, Agnes Louisa Kendall, died aged 33 years. She was a mother of four young children including their youngest who was named after his uncle William Arthur. On 3 October 1888 he married Margaret Emma Wilkinson at the village of Rostherne, Cheshire and they moved into their first home together at Ryecroft Street, Ossett.\n\nIn the same year the Temperance Hall on Illingworth Street, designed by W.A. Kendall was opened. It was described by the Ossett Observer as âin the 17th Century style modernisedâ. By 1893 the recently wed Kendalls had moved to Ossett Town End which was, at least, closer to his Bank Street office. The period 1890-1894 was his most prolific and brought five significant public building design projects for William Arthur.\n\nPicture above courtesy: Cockburnâs Almanac 1880âs & 1890âs published by Ossett & District Historical Society 1987.\n\nIn spring 1887 his youngest sister Emma Kendall, born and baptised in Ossett in 1866, had married William Brotherton Hanson in Bradford. The couple had three children, Louisa (born 1887), Gladys (1889) and Charles Hanson (1893) who were all born in Bradford. In 1901 William Brotherton Hanson was a boarder in a Bradford boarding house whilst his wife Emma and daughter Gladys were living at the newly built home of her brother at no. 1 The Gables, Station Road.Â Emmaâs other children were elsewhere but joined their mother later. After 1901 no further record of William Brotherton Hansonâs whereabouts has been found. Emma, having been deserted by her father when she was 15 years old was now abandoned by her husband.\n\nFrom that time, maybe earlier, William Arthur Kendall stepped in, gave sister Emma and his nieces and nephew a home and became a father figure for the children. They were to repay his kindness handsomely.Â Sadly William Arthur lost his wife of 10 years, Margaret Emma in summer 1898. She was 39 years of age. The couple had no children. It is unlikely that she ever lived at the which William Arthur was building for her at The Gables, a terrace of six dwellings whichÂ was built in 1898/1899.Perhaps because of his wifeâs passing it appears that William Arthur remained at his Town end home until 1900 when he moved to live at no 1 The Gables. He was not alone as he was joined there by Emma and her children.\n\nWilliam Arthur Kendall was 41 years of age in 1898 and yet his relatively short life had been full of sadness, some joy and huge achievement. In less than 20 years he had lost both of his parents ,his mother by death, his disgraced father and a brother in law by desertion, aÂ shamed uncle had been jailed and a sister, a brother and a wife had been snatched away much too young. He overcame adversity and his eloquence, determination and vision had built a reputation for designing the finest of buildings which gave OssettÂ a more ornamental style of architectureÂ and took the town to a level of excellence and sophistication which was unimaginable just 10 years earlier.\n\nExcepting Southdale School (opened in 1908), the building of The Gables, a terrace of six dwellings, including the one in which he lived from 1900 was, perhaps fittingly, to be his last major building enterprise in Ossett.\n\nMeanwhile what was happening to the Horbury branch of the Kendall family,Â William Holliday KendallÂ and patriarch William Kendall, William Arthurâs uncle and grandfather? In 1881 Â schoolmaster William Holliday Kendall was imprisoned for 6 months for embezzlement. Whilst he was in Leeds and Wakefield HMP, his wife of 12 years, Amelia Elizabeth (nee Earle), was living alone at no. 1 Westfield Villas. His father, William, by now a widower aged 74, but still described as a schoolmaster, was living at Tithe Barn Road with his 23 year old, London born grandson, William E. Kendall who was a station master. By 1883 the family had moved to Barnsley.\n\nSadly Amelia Kendall died there in 1883 and widower William Holliday Kendall, an insurance agent, married his second wife, Kate Chesterman in January 1885 at Leeds Parish Church. William Arthur Kendall was a witness for his uncle.Â By 1891 the couple had two sons and were living at Cemetery Road, Barnsley with William Holliday Kendallâs octogenarian father, William, who died there in spring 1891.\n\n1911 â 1928 A niece and three nephews go off to war. Charles Kendall Hanson M.C., changes his name, co – designs The Ossett War Memorial & marries the widow of a soldier killed in action in WWI who was awarded an M.C. (Military Cross)Â Â\n\nIn 1911 William Arthurâs uncle,Â William Holliday Kendall, an assurance agent, was still living on Cemetery Road Barnsley with his wife and two sons who were both working as assurance collectors. He died in Barnsley in 1913 aged 71 years.\n\nAbove: Station Road Ossett about 1925 The Gables terrace on far left. (Courtesy WMDC Libraries)\n\nBack in Ossett in 1911 William Arthur Kendallâs sister Emma Hanson describing herself as married was living at The Gables, Station Road with her son Charles Kendall Hanson aged 17, an architectural student and her 22 year old daughter Gladys who was an elementary school teacher. Emmaâs daughter, Louisa was elsewhere possibly working or training as a nurse.\n\nIn the same year Architect/Surveyor William Arthur Kendall was visiting the Denby Dale home of his brother in law, Fred Lilley Cook, the husband of Eleanor Beatrice (nee Wilkinson) who was the sister of William Arthur Kendallâs late wife who died in 1898. Â Fred and Eleanorâs two sons were in the 1911 household;Â Frank Eaden CookÂ aged 20 years andÂ John (Jack) Eaden CookÂ aged 19 years. These two lads were William Arthurâs nephews by marriage. Remember the names.\n\nIn 1914 war was declared and on the 16th February 1917, 2ndÂ Lieutenant Charles Kendall HansonÂ embarked for France with the Sherwood Foresters (Nottinghamshire & Derbyshire Regiment). On 18th March 1918 it was reported thatÂ “he had been awarded the Military Cross For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty in training his men and leading them in a raid.”\n\nHe became one of only two Ossett men known to have been awarded the Military Cross for gallantry. Charles Kendall Hanson returned to his home in Ossett; a hero.\n\nNurse Louisa Hanson (1887-1981)Â was Charles Kendall Hansonâs sister and William Arthur Kendallâs niece. Like her mother, brother and sister, Gladys, she was abandoned by her father sometime between 1893 and 1901. Louisa looked upon William Arthur as a father figure. She is believed to be the first Ossett woman to serve overseas in The Great War 1914-1918. On 24th December 1914 theÂ “Ossett Observer”Â publishedÂ “Our Roll of Honour List of Ossett and Horbury men who are serving their country.”Â Despite the headline referring to theÂ menÂ serving their country, the listing includes the name of one woman; Nurse Louisa Hanson, The Gables, Station Road; Red Cross Society in France. In June 1918, she was awarded The Royal Red Cross, 2nd Class and was subsequently decorated by the King at a Buckingham Palace Investiture on 25th June 1920. Her Medal Card records that she was also Mentioned in Despatches.\n\nLieutenantÂ Frank Eaden Cook (1890-1918)Â who we met at Denby Dale in 1911 enlisted as a Private on 1st September 1914 just three weeks after war was declared. He rose through the ranks of the 1/10 battalion Manchester Regiment and was made full Lieutenant in April 1918. He was awarded the Military Cross on 30 August 1918 which was bestowed on him on 7 October 1918. He was killed in action two weeks later on 20 October 1918, aged 28 years. Frank Eaden Cook had married Nora Richardson in January 1918. A son, Frank Wilkinson Cook was born a year later. Father and son would never meet. Both were victims of war. Feel their pain.\n\nhttps://huddersfield.exposed/wiki/Frank_Eaden_Cook_(1890-1918)\n\nÂ Frankâs younger brother,Â John (Jack) Eaden Cook (1891-1916)Â enlisted with his elder brother on 1st September 1914.What did their parents, William Arthur Kendallâs in laws, make of that day? Jack joined the 20th battalion Royal Fusiliers and was killed in action on the Somme on 20 July 1916. He was 24 years of age. He is remembered on The Thiepval Memorial with another 72,336 soldiers who have no known grave.\n\nhttps://huddersfield.exposed/wiki/John_Eadon_Cook_(1891-1916)\n\nAll families suffer in war. Some families suffer more than others.\n\nOn the 27th October 1921, at Ossett Holy Trinity Church, Louisa married Thomas Allan Robertshaw,Â from Bradford. Rather fittingly the man who had been responsible for caring for her for most of her life, her Uncle William Arthur Kendall, signed the Register as her witness. Her birth father was not present.\n\nÂ Just days after the Armistice was signed on 11 November 1918Â aÂ war weary Ossett held a public meeting to discuss how the Ossett Fallen might be remembered. Less than 20 people attended. A second public meeting was held at the Town Hall on 4th February 1919 to discuss how the town might remember its fallen heroes in The Great War 1914-1918. Several speakers outlined their ideas and more than 120 people attended this meeting.\n\nWilliam Arthur Kendall spoke passionately about his proposal saying that Ossett should ensure that whatever was done should be done for the benefit of those who had suffered and their dependants. He proposed that land be acquired on whichÂ to erect 50 or 60 cottages in picturesque blocks, as a miniature garden village for the benefit of the victims of the war, with a club room.\n\nNotwithstanding strong support for Mr. Kendallâs proposal a vote was taken and the proposal for a public park with a public building such as a library or art gallery was carried by 45 votes to 34. A committee was formed and nine years later the Ossett War Memorial was unveiled on the newly built Kingsway.\n\nAfter the war, Charles Hanson, influenced so much by his architect & surveyor Uncle William, qualified as an architect and became an Associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects (A.R.I.B.A.). In May 1921 Charles renounced and abandoned his birth name Hanson and was thereafter known as Charles Kendall. Charles would have been familiar with his Uncleâs passion that Ossett remember its Fallen. In March 1925 the Borough and its committee had met, debated and proposed that Ossett should have a Cenotaph. A competition was held to encourage design proposals and further particulars were to be available from the Borough Surveyor.\n\nIt is not known whether Charles sought further particulars from the Borough Surveyor but a fruitful partnership developed between the two men. Shortly thereafter theÂ Ossett War MemorialÂ was designed and supervised by the said Borough Surveyor, Mr. H. Holmes, M.Inst.C.E.I. and Mr.Â Charles Kendall M.C., A.R.I.B.A. (Architect)Â who were the Joint Architects for the project.\n\nOn 5 January 1926 at Woodhouse Church Huddersfield Charles Kendall M.C., of The Gables, Ossett married Nora Cook, the widow of LieutenantÂ Frank Eadon Cook M.C.,Â and the daughter of J.Hamilton Richardson of Huddersfield.\n\nBy 11 November 1928 the Ossett War Memorial was in place on the newly constructed Kingsway in readiness for the Address and Unveiling of the Memorial by the Right Honourable Lord Viscount Lascelles Â K.G., D.S.O.\n\nWhat a day that must have been for the Kendall family having overcome so much adversity in their lives. How proud they must have been. Fittingly Charles Kendall, an Ossett war hero who had been awarded the Military Cross for gallantry, the nephew of William Arthur Kendall who had done so much for Ossett, was also the co-designer ofÂ The Ossett War Memorial.Â Ossett would look and see what he had madeÂ andÂ William Arthur would be reassured that his legacy to Ossett would be in the safe hands of his nephew.\n\n1928 â 1972 Charles Kendall makes a new home; William Arthur Kendall passes away, World War II is declared and Charles Kendallâs stepson Â is awarded the Military Cross and the M.B.E.\n\nIn September 1936, Charles Kendall purchased 22 yards of frontage on to Southdale Road, from the Greenwood family of Sowood House, and designed and built a house, Southdale Croft, between Lime Street and Southdale Road. His new home was only one dwelling away from Green Mount the former home of Hannah Pickard. Her 1891 Will required her Executors to erect a drinking fountain and water trough in the Market Place as a memorial of the 1890 Incorporation of Ossett and the donor.\n\nThe fountain was designed by Charles Kendallâs beloved uncle William Arthur Kendall who had this to say about Hannah Pickard in 1893;Â “A nobler woman than Miss Pickard had never lived and had she lived longer she would have been a yet greater blessing to the poor of the borough”. He added thatÂ “he hoped that her example might do something to spur others who were quite as able but not so willing”.\n\nLink below:Â Miss Hannah Pickardâs biography which provided the basis of the presentation to the Ossett Civic Trust to consider the approval of a Blue Plaque.\n\nIn February 1937 Alice Greenwood, the owner of the GPâs Surgery atÂ Sowood House on The GreenÂ commissionedÂ Ossett architect and surveyor, Charles Kendall A.R.I.B.A. of 10, Bank Street, OssettÂ to undertake a survey of Sowood House and to make recommendations regarding any necessary remedial work which may be needed to secure its future. At that time Sowood House was the GPâs Practice tenanted and run by Dr. Rene Wood who had also been awarded the Military Cross (M.C.) in WWI. He and Charles Kendall are the only two Ossett men known to have been awarded the Military Cross in The Great War.\n\nWilliam Louis Rene Wood\n\nHannah Pickford – Blue Plaque\n\nLater that year on 27 December 1937 William Arthur Kendall passed away at his home at no.1 The Gables, the terrace he had designed and supervised the building of in 1898/99. Â He was 80 years of age. He was cremated at Lawnswood Cemetery Leeds on Thursday 30th December 1937.\n\nHe insisted that there be Â âNo flowers. No mourning. By request.â He was understated to the very end of his life.. His effects were Â£6760 (equivalent to Â£464,000 current value).\n\nHis unremarkable and typically understated obituary from the Yorkshire Post & Leeds Intelligencer (29 December 1937) read as follows;\n\nMr William Arthur Kendall architect died at Ossett yesterday aged 80. The son of a former head master of Ossett Grammar School he practised as an architect for many years, and was responsible for the plans of numerous public schools and factories. He was past president of the Wakefield Paxton Society and a member of the Yorkshire Archaeological Society, the Wakefield Historical Society, the Wakefield Naturalistsâ Society and the Yorkshire Tykes.\n\nCharles Kendall and his wife, Nora, were living at Southdale Croft by 1939 and on 6 July 1948, Mrs. Charles Kendall of Southdale Croft Ossett was proud to announce the engagement of her son,Â Frank Wilkinson Cook M.C., to Edna Mary Braithwaite.\n\nIn case you missed it Mrs Charles Kendallâs late husband, her present husband and her son had each been awarded the Military Cross for gallantry. Her son and Charles Kendallâs stepson,Frank Wilkinson Cook, M.B.E., M.C., a career soldier, was awarded the Military Cross in June 1943 (North Africa Tunisia/Algeria) whilst an Acting Captain with 2/4 KOYLI. In 1957 (Cyprus) whilst a Major with KOYLI he was recommended for Â a second Â M.C., but the recommendation was amended to an award of an M.B.E. In 1972 he was appointed Deputy Colonel, The Light Infantry (Yorkshire).Charles Kendall M.C., of Southdale Croft, 18 Southdale Road, passed away on 17th April 1973, aged 80 years. His effects were Â£40190 (Â£490,000 at current values). His wife Nora passed away in late 1978.\n\nIn the end\n\nThis has been the story of the extraordinary life and work of a remarkable man, William Arthur Kendall (1857-1937) who in the late 19th Century changed the streetscape of Ossett. His story as told here has touched the many moments in his life when he would be left low.\n\nHe overcame adversity and his eloquence, determination and visionÂ built a reputation for designing the finest of buildings which took Ossett to a level of excellence and sophistication which was unimaginable just 10 years earlier. Ossett approved and was as effusive as any West Riding town could summon.\n\nIn 1894 the Ossett Observer reportedÂ âGood stone buildings have arisen along both sides (of Station Road), and such is the impetus given to the adoption of a more ornamental style of architecture in the erection of new business premises that the appearance of the centre of the borough is altogether changed for the better…..â\n\nIn truth Ossett knew very little about William Arthur Kendall. Now we know him much better. Thank you.\n\nÂ"
