        "text": "THE WALL PAINTINGS OF PICKERING CHURCH Their discovery, restoration and meaning by Kate Giles (Sean Tyas 2022 viii+200pp ISBN 978-1-915774-01-9) £20+p&p Shaun Tyas, 1 High Street, Donington PE11 4TA shaun@shauntyas.myzen.co.uk\n\nIn her introduction Kate Giles invites us to ‘Make a pilgrimage to Pickering in North Yorkshire [whose] remarkable scheme of wall paintings is one of England’s hidden church treasures’. This beautifully illustrated book recounts the discovery, restoration and conservation of these wonderful paintings in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and then explains their meaning. The fifteenth-century painted interior of the church of St Peter and St Paul, which may itself have overlayed an earlier painted scheme, was whitewashed over when the chantry commissioners visited in the 1540s. It ‘reappeared’ when some plaster fell off in 1852. The vicar, John Ponsonby, wanted to cover them over because of their association with Catholicism; indeed, he refused to preach while the paintings were exposed. However, the growth of the Oxford Movement and of antiquarian and archaeological societies in the mid-nineteenth century meant that there was interest in such artefacts. On receiving news of the discovery the Yorkshire Architectural Society immediately sent its member and architect, William Hey Dykes, to Pickering; he was accompanied by the Society’s artist, Mr Bevan. Dykes produced a detailed description of the paintings, which he presented as a talk on 21 October 1852, illustrated by Bevan’s drawings. On 30 October 1852 the York Herald and General Advertiser carried an article by Frank Howard, Liverpool-based artist, author and lecturer, who enthused ‘I can testify to their value as the most complete specimen of ancient mural decoration in existence, or at present discovered’. The archbishop of York apparently visited in early November and urged that the ‘paintings may be left undefaced and uninjured’ but when Dykes’ paper was published in 1853 he noted that since the paper was read ‘the paintings have been destroyed by the authority of the Vicar’.\n\nIn December 1876 George Lightfoot, the curate-in-charge at Pickering, applied to the Church of England for permission to restore the church. He wanted to renew it both architecturally and spiritually but, as a keen antiquary, he was aware of the archaeological significance of the paintings: their restoration was to attract national attention and criticism. In chapter 3 ‘Restoration’, Giles reappraises and re-evaluates Lightfoot’s legacy ‘and its impact on perceptions of the value and significance of the paintings as well as their physical condition, ever since’. A key feature of the restoration was the restitution of a division between the chancel and the nave: a new east end altar and rood screen were set up. The church was also re-pewed, and the north and south transcripts rebuilt. The archbishop preached in the transformed church in June 1879, but Lightfoot had not finished his restoration project: he had heard of the mural paintings which Ponsonby had had covered with copperas wash and he determined ‘that something so unusual as the paintings should not if possible be lost’. Work to uncover and restore the paintings started in 1882, overseen by Shrigley and Hunt (stained glass specialists) and their artist Edward Holmes Jewitt, one of the best stained-glass designers of his day. First, they had to remove the plaster with which the paintings had been covered in 1852. Initially Lightfoot simply chose to preserve what was left but the general effect was so unsatisfactory that, after careful consideration, it was decided to attempt restoration. Ultimately Lightfoot praised Jewitt and his colleagues ‘for the conscientious manner in which they resisted the temptation of improving the work, whose greatest value is not its beauty but its antiquarian interest’. Jewitt used oil-based paint and preservative waxes ‘so that what remained might be preserved and might once again regain something of a more permanent character’. There follows a close analysis of the images comparing the watercolours of 1852 with photos and postcards of the paintings dating to c.1902, as well as the paintings today. It reveals that Jewitt undoubtedly filled in gaps in the surviving imagery, in close dialogue with Lightfoot.\n\nOn 21 November 1889 a special ‘re-opening’ service celebrated the end of almost a decade of painstaking cleaning and restoration. Visits from various antiquarian societies provided mixed reactions to Lightfoot’s efforts but his parishioners and subsequent visitors over the years have appreciated them. Although Pickering was acknowledged as one of the most extensive schemes of medieval wall paintings to be discovered, an overriding concern with art historians was the concept of authenticity, which led to repeated assertions that it had been ‘over-restored’. Chapter 4, ‘Conservation’ shows how twentieth century conservation efforts preserved both the Victorian legacy of restoration and the medieval meanings of the paintings. Giles argues that the Victorian restoration also gave the paintings ‘a sense of visual coherence’ which exerted a profound impact, both visual and spiritual, on visitors and congregation alike. Preserving this visual integrity became the priority of twentieth-century conservation efforts. The next restoration of the paintings was completed in October 1937, using yet another variant of wax preservative, which protected the surface but allowed damp to quickly build up behind it and prevented it from escaping. The particularly harsh winter of 1947 caused extensive damage to the church building and to some of the paintings. Dr Clive Rouse was persuaded to undertake their conservation. In 1952-1953 he replaced the wax with ‘Silicaseal’. His assistant Janet Truda Lenton carried out repainting where Rouse considered it necessary, and this was considered permissible because of the extent of the damage caused by the winter of 1947 and because the paintings were, in effect, Victorian. Lenton made full- and half-scale post-restoration drawings which still survive.\n\nThe paintings deteriorated yet again and in the early 1960s the vicar, Canon William Wallis, sought advice from various bodies. In 1968 Rouse again oversaw restoration and conservation: the entire series of paintings was cleaned and plaster patches added where necessary. Discoveries made at this time include the figures of saints in the splays of the clerestory windows, revealed in outline but not repainted. Wallis was congratulated for this round of conservation completed in 1970, but by 1995 the paintings again had attracted dirt and dust, and were flaking. Lightfoot and Jewitt’s legacy at Pickering was long-lasting but problematic: their vision to restore the visual coherence of the paintings, together with the use of oil paint, wax and copal varnish preservatives created a scheme that required further cleaning and conservation every quarter of a century. Now, 50 years after the last restoration, further attention is needed.\n\nWhat do the paintings comprise? They are all beautifully illustrated by earlier images and photos taken in 2020. On the north wall are St George; St Christopher; St John the Baptist (Herod’s banquet); St Edmund; St Thomas Becket. On the south wall are St Catherine of Alexandria; the corporal acts of mercy; ‘The life of our Lord’, with scenes from the Passion, Crucifixion, descent from the cross and entombment; the death, funeral, assumption and coronation of the Virgin Mary. There are some vernacular texts, a reminder of the literacy of some of those viewing the paintings. Chapter 5, ‘Meaning’, discusses what has been preserved of the medieval meanings of the paintings. Although Lightfoot and Jewitt filled in the outlines and even added new elements, they did not change the basic iconography of the images. Giles evokes the medieval town and its parishioners to discover who might have been responsible for creating the wall paintings in the fifteenth century. By the third quarter of the century the walls of the nave had been raised to accommodate a clerestory of square-headed windows, with a new roof and embattled parapets. This ‘modest’ window scheme ‘resulted in the enlargement of the mural canvas’, offering painters and patrons the opportunity to create a continuous programme of paintings. Here Giles explains the meanings of the various saints’ stories and their relevance and compares them with paintings of the same saints elsewhere. The prominence of the Virgin suggests that the parish’s Gild of St Mary had a key influence on the scheme of the paintings, but other choices must have reflected personal devotions to other saints. Pevsner opined that the Pickering paintings ‘had never been great art’ but, as Giles argues, he misses the point of them: they were not designed to improve the parishioners’ cultural lives but to make them better Christians and to save their souls.\n\nGiles explains a ‘lightbulb’ moment when she realised how the Pickering paintings were organised: the days of the saints depicted on the north and south walls progress through the calendar from west to east. She believes that this is not coincidental. The first two months of the year are missing, but there are no paintings on the walls nearest the west end. The wall paintings were not simply a backdrop against which the liturgy unfolded: the imagery played an active part in the transformation of sacred space into something rich and meaningful during the cycle of the religious year.\n\nIn her conclusion Giles argues that the legacy of Pickering’s Victorian restoration by Lightfoot and his artist Jewitt is important in two ways: firstly, their use of inappropriate preservatives produced a dialogue between clergy and experts throughout the twentieth century debating the most appropriate ways to preserve the paintings, making Pickering something of a laboratory for their techniques and materials; secondly, it preserves one of the most comprehensive archives of correspondence and documentation for a painted scheme (letters, reports, watercolours, scaled drawings, photographs etc). The church has recently had underfloor heating and new lighting installed; the paintings need restoration work again, and she wonders what might lie under the layers of paint and plaster in the blank bays at the western and eastern ends of the nave. Her book gives a voice to, and canvas for, Pickering’s past. She is hopeful for its future.\n\nMANAGING FOR POSTERITY The Norfolk gentry and their estates c.1450-1700 by Elizabeth Griffiths, edited by Jane Whittle (University of Hertfordshire Press 2022 xviii+229 pp ISBN 978-1-912260-45-4) £35\n\nElizabeth Griffiths’ knowledge of, and research into, three influential Norfolk gentry families was formidable. As well as her PhD on the Hobart family estate centred on Blickling and the Windham estate centred on Felbrigg, she published various articles and chapters in edited collections, edited texts and co-authored a book on these two families and the Le Stranges of Hunstanton. When she died in April 2020 she was working on a book entitled Managing for Posterity: The Le Stranges of Hunstanton and their Estates 1604-1919. As Jane Whittle explains in the introduction, that book was only partly finished, with five chapters in draft, a sixth incomplete and another six unwritten. What has now been published are Griffiths’ first six chapters of new research on the Le Stranges, together with four chapters based on previously published work that are closely related to that new work.\n\nSuccessful estate management was the principal key to the long-term survival of English aristocratic and gentry families (provided that succession was also continuous). When in 1604, after a long minority, Sir Hamon Le Strange inherited the ancient estate at Hunstanton the buildings were in poor condition and the land mismanaged; however, with the help of his wife Alice, he ‘restored the fortunes of the family through the careful and innovative management of their estates’. This book tells how they achieved this and secured the future of the family. Hamon and Alice created, in Griffiths’ terminology, ‘a prototype knowledge economy’, which they handed down to their children, grandchildren and particularly to their great-grandson, Sir Nicholas Le Strange, who inherited the estate as a minor in 1669 and lived until 1724. How they did this was through exceptional record-keeping; how Griffiths was able to analyse this was through the exceptional survival of those records. They contain instructions to readers and cross-referencing back to earlier documents, indicating that knowledge was created, managed and transferred between generations. Tellingly, Sir Nicholas identified one of the rooms in Hunstanton Hall as ‘the old evidence house’ or ‘the Evidence Room’ and, as it was damp, determined to house the books and documents elsewhere so that the knowledge was preserved for future generations.\n\nThe medieval inheritance of the Le Strange estates was crucial to future generations. Having identified the first recognisable ancestor (Roland Le Strange, who held lands in Norfolk in 1112), Griffiths traces the family through the medieval period. An important local product was fish, but tracing fishing activities in the past is difficult due to lack of records. Its value only becomes apparent in the Le Strange household accounts: there are a few from the mid-fourteenth century, but they are continuous under Sir Thomas and his wife Anne from 1518 to 1545. These accounts contain a wealth of information about fishing and fishing rights. There were ongoing battles to secure the medieval fishing rights and the modern Le Strange Fishery, with the result that ancient documents were preserved and detailed estate records kept. In 1592 Sir Henry Spelman was appointed a trustee for the Le Strange estate. He was also a guardian of Sir Hamon, a minor. A skilled antiquarian, Spelman wrote up all of the evidences and other writings relating to the estate, working from 1605 until his death in 1619. A by-product of his work was the later family’s interest in its own family history.\n\nIn Chapter 3 Griffiths discusses the Le Strange estate in 1604, which is known about because Alice left detailed notes about the precarious financial position just after her marriage to Sir Hamon, not least because money and lands that were part of her marriage settlement were used to pay off her husband’s wardship. Since the death of his father Sir Nicholas the estate had not been well-managed but it had reasonably solid foundations. According to Griffiths, the couple turned its fortunes round through an adventurous approach to estate management. Due to the varied geography of the estate some areas were suitable for arable farming, others less so. In the latter the concept of ‘farming to halves’ was followed, with the landlord sharing costs of threshing, shepherds’ wages and payments associated with managing sheep. Chapter 4 outlines the context for the success achieved by Sir Hamon and Alice between 1604 and 1654 (the year of his death). By 1642 they had greatly increased their income and they also overcame the reversal of fortune that they suffered in the Civil War. Many Norfolk gentry families failed in both respects: what did it take to become a winner in that world of rising prices, falling income and a divided county? Having considered the fortunes of several families, including the Hobarts, the Cokes and the Cleres, Griffiths concludes that a range of problems might afflict gentry families and affect their ability to survive—not simply incompetence, adherence to the Catholic faith or failure of the male line, but also ‘weakness of character’ that developed in some of these leading families. She surmises that ‘the key to longevity was to commit yourself to the care and management of your estate and community and to pass on that culture to your children’.\n\nIn Chapter 5 ‘The knowledge economy of the Le Strange family’, Griffiths demonstrates that the key was the library at Hunstanton. Its catalogue, probably compiled by Hamon’s youngest son Roger, provides a meticulous record of the 2659 books acquired by the family from 1511 to 1698. As well as buying new books for the library and gathering historical material relating to his estate, Sir Hamon, with the help of Alice, reorganised the ‘evidence house’, commissioned maps and surveys (Table 5.1 lists them all), instigated field books and modernised rentals and accounts. Alice was involved with the accounts from 1609 and was systematic in her record keeping. For example, separate building accounts were introduced in 1620, when building projects across the estate were increasing: she paid bills and itemised expenditure while her husband concentrated on managing the building process, thus building up their knowledge of the estate. They needed to engage with a wide variety of people in the running of their estate, and especially in the building programme already alluded to, which included not only radical work on the hall but also numerous other structures from farm buildings and henhouses to the Octagon in the park where Hamon played his viols. Figure 6:1 shows the expenditure on building projects and repairs from 1607 to 1653. The Le Strange building programme is compared with that of Sir Roger Townshend at Raynham. This chapter includes numerous plans and drawings of Hunstanton Hall (before a great fire in 1853). Evidence of building activities also survives to the present day at Ringstead, Holme, Heacham and Sedgeford.\n\nIn 2015 Elizabeth Griffiths edited for the Norfolk Record Society (NRS) Her Price is Above Pearls: Family and Farming Records of Alice Le Strange, 1617-1656. This comprises a selection of documents that Alice produced, including sheep accounts, the early records she kept for her own estate at Sedgeford and her summary of the family finances. Chapter 7 is an abridged version of the introduction to that volume. The estate at Sedgeford had a complicated grazing system involving ‘brecks’. Towards the end of her life Alice drew up her ‘Sedgford [sic] Frimall and Breck Book 1647/8/9 & 1650’, a comprehensive reference work relating to those divisions, which was annotated by her successors until the 1700s. Chapter 8 reprints an article on the draining of the coastal marshes in north-west Norfolk, arguably an area of reclaimed land overlooked in general accounts of early modern drainage. The key difference from large-scale schemes in the Fens is that in areas like north Norfolk drainage was largely within a manor, where resident gentry were prepared to work with rather than against local communities. Chapter 9 is an abridged version of Griffith’s introduction to William Windham’s Green Book 1673-88 (NRS vol LXVI), which relates to the management of Windham’s estate at Felbrigg. In ‘Response to adversity’ Griffiths considers the changing strategies of two Norfolk landowning families, c.1665-1700, namely the Hobarts and the Windhams. The epilogue sketches the story of the Hunstanton estate up to the present-day.\n\nThis collection of essays has been thoughtfully edited by Jane Whittle, who emphasises that it is important for historians to keep records of their research so that it is not lost to future researchers. This insightful work by Elizabeth Griffiths would have been lost had she not followed the record-keeping example of Hamon and Alice Le Strange.\n\nHeather Falvey and Elizabeth Griffiths contributed chapters to several of the same edited collections.\n\nTHE REMEMBRANCE BOOKS OF ROBERT KNAPLOCKE 1575 AND JOHN JACKSON 1578 edited by Cheryl Butler (Southampton Record Series 49 2021 xlvii+194pp ISBN 978-1-912431-12-0) £30\n\nTHE REMEMBRANCE BOOKS OF RICHARD GODDARD 1583, JOHN CROOK 1584 AND ANDREW STUDELEY 1586 edited by Cheryl Butler (Southampton Record Series 50 2021 xlvii+194pp ISBN 978-1-912431-16-8) £30\n\nThe governance of Southampton was such that it generated numerous records over time and, fortunately for historians, many of them have survived. The mayor was elected annually, the mayoral year running from 1 October. His duties were many: he presided over the weekly council and various town courts, supervised regulations controlling trade and industries, managed corporation properties, dispensed poor relief and charity, and carried out orders from central government. These two volumes comprise transcripts of the rough notebooks of five late-sixteenth century mayors. The notebooks contain not only information that those men wished to be recorded but also the text of examinations of suspect persons and depositions from witnesses who appeared before the mayor’s court. Usually these items would subsequently have been copied into formal town record books, such as the Books of Remembrance and the Books of Examinations and Depositions; however, inspection of these formal books indicate that the notes kept by these particular mayors were not copied over.\n\nThe introduction to volume 49 discusses Southampton in the late-sixteenth century, covering industry and trade, the town’s ordinances, its social structure and various occupational groups. As it was a port, many matters dealt with by local courts related to the sea, including pirates and privateering, immigrants and incomers. Frequent passage between and communication with the Channel Islands is recorded, as are tortuous journeys that people might make, whether overland or by sea. The judicial system in operation is outlined, including the men involved in the arrest of suspects and lawbreakers (the sergeants and the watch), the process of arrest and investigation of the alleged crime by the local justices (one of whom was the mayor). Some of the evidence is more akin to gossip and hearsay, which therefore throws much light on daily life. Many of the people examined were foreigners, whether permanent residents or passing through. The authorities attached much importance to whether travellers had money in their purse: nearly every examination asks what money the deponent had, because the justices wanted to ensure that travellers were not vagrants, and were not likely to be a drain on public funds. There is also a discussion of the ‘instruments of justice’. Finally, the careers of the two mayors are considered. Robert Knaplocke (mayor 1575-76) was a lawyer. His remembrance book, which comprises 94 pages in the original, includes numerous depositions and examinations taken by the mayor and senior burgesses in their role as justices of the peace. John Jackson (mayor 1578-79, and also 1590-91) was by trade a draper and nowhere near as wealthy as Knaplocke. His examinations cover cases of immorality and stolen goods, and also episodes indicating the dangers of being a town watchman or sergeant trying to maintain the peace and make arrests. Appendices include examples of signatures and marks, and the translation of a Portuguese document.\n\nMuch of the introduction to volume 49 also applies to volume 50, so the introduction to the latter highlights any differences or new perspectives that become apparent in the 1580s. As the most obvious new development in cases investigated by the justices relates to religion, the editor has provided a brief summary of religious changes that affected the town from the time of the Reformation. There were several local Catholic recusant families and in the latter part of the sixteenth century Southampton itself was considered by some commentators to be ‘cold in religion’. Highly relevant here is that fact that three of mayor John Crooke’s [sic] sons-in-law were thought to be sympathetic to the old religion, if not actual papists. Although examinations of those suspected of being papists recorded in the books of Goddard, Crooke and Studeley represent a new element to the justices’ work, they spent far less time investigating such cases than those of robbery and theft of merchandise from local cellars. Richard Goddard (mayor 1583-84) was an important merchant who was also involved in privateering with his ship The Angel. It was eventually part of the English fleet during the Armada campaign and was sacrificed as one of Drake’s fire-ships (Goddard received £450 in compensation). John Crooke (mayor 1568-69 and 1584-85) originated in Poole but by the early 1560s had moved permanently to Southampton, becoming a leading merchant there. His many trading links with Spain meant that he suffered with the deterioration of relations between England and Spain. Andrew Studeley (mayor 1586-87 and 1587-88) was a mercer and a merchant, whose mayoralty was a time of national crisis, when invasion was imminent. His reputation was impugned on several occasions and eventually in 1603 he was discredited for defrauding the town. The indictment included accusations of destroying account books and other documents, which may explain why only some of his examinations can be found in his surviving remembrance book, covering only his first year in office. Appendices include information on droving routes, Salisbury races, personal marks and travel patterns of witnesses.\n\nThe introduction to both volumes ends with a description of the manuscripts and discusses the various hands (the writers), sometimes identifiable as the mayor himself or, for example, Richard Waterton, the town clerk. In both volumes the entries are numbered sequentially and the contents page helpfully lists each entry by number, name(s) of the principal individual(s) being examined (or whatever) and a short title. A few examples from the books demonstrate the kind of matters that needed to be ‘remembered’. Volume 49, entry 118, dated 16 January 1575/6, records that Goodwife Manfeilde and Goodwife Johns ‘this day made frindes and warned under paine of lawe so to continew’. Entry 222, dated 20 March 1578, records that Richard Bulling, late of Warrington in ‘lancon shere’, yeoman, had borrowed a small ‘bybell’ from a servant in the White Horse and had left this book as surety for payment for beer in another drinking house, as he did not have any cash on him. In volume 50, entry 100, William Gosse and Robert Fory (or Fleruy) of Southampton, mariners, gave evidence about events off the coast of Newfoundland while they were on board Mr Demaricke’s ship called the Archangel. Entry 155, dated 28 May 1585, is a letter from Lord Burghley, the Earl of Leicester, Lord Admiral Howard, Christopher Hatton and Francis Walsingham urging the local administration to be vigilant in looking out for ‘wicked persons’ with ‘develishe malice’ against the Queen.\n\nThe editorial decision to retain the original punctuation and capitalisation, which in both cases is minimal, makes the entries rather hard to follow; nevertheless, these two volumes contain a wealth of information about goings on in late Elizabethan Southampton.\n\nBURNHAM NORTON FRIARY AFTER THE DISSOLUTION by Sally Francis (Boydell 2023 xiii+168pp ISBN 978-1-78327-674-5) £19.99 also £19.99 ebook\n\nTracing what happened to the lands and buildings that had once belonged monasteries and other religious houses after those institutions were dissolved in the 1530s is difficult; however, this study by Sally Francis demonstrates that it may be possible. In her investigation into the subsequent ownership of the property of Burnham Norton Carmelite friary, she has used original and published documents, archaeological and site reports, and a survey of local houses to reconstruct the probable subsequent history of the site, to suggest the likely architecture of some of the friary’s buildings and to identify the various pieces of land that had comprised the friary’s estate.\n\nToday Burnham Norton in North Norfolk is a ‘rural backwater’ but during the Saxon period the several villages bearing the name Burnham were a single territory, populous and an area of much local significance. For example, excluding outlying Burnham Deepdale, the main group had nine parish churches within a square mile. The village of Burnham Norton moved, probably by the late-thirteenth century, so its parish church of St Margaret now stands alone in a field over a mile to the south east of the present village and just north of Burnham Market. This explains why two fields to the east of that church are the remains of Burnham Norton friary. Still standing today are the restored friary gatehouse, the first floor of which was (and is again) a chapel, and the west gable of the friary church, which at one time was converted into a barn. These are now a scheduled monument, leased to the Norfolk Archaeological Trust.\n\nFrancis argues that in its heyday the friary made a big impact on local life not only through the brothers’ preaching but also because it was a place of pilgrimage (to the gatehouse chapel and possibly the local holy well), home of a religious guild and a burial place. Carmelite records indicate that it hosted eight Provincial Chapters (meetings of representatives from houses in the English Province) and that some Burnham Norton friars rose to prominence in the order. According to the Valor Ecclesiasticus in 1535 their estate covered 68 acres, which would have provided income from rents. The number of friars at Burnham is unknown but was no more than 15 to 17 in the early sixteenth century. By the 1530s the friary was in a poor financial state: on 17 May 1538 the widowed Lady Jane Calthorpe, of nearby Polstead Hall manor, wrote to Thomas Cromwell asking to purchase the friary. She stated that there were only four friars, ‘in so grete povertie’ that they could not afford to sustain the house, which was ‘not unlike within short tyme to Fall in grete ruyne and decay’. The friary was dissolved later that year and she did subsequently have tenancy of part of the estate.\n\nUsing a wide variety of records, Francis has been able to construct an account of the people who expressed interest in, or had ownership or tenancy of, the friary from just before its dissolution until the present day. Dates, names and details are listed in Table 1 and then the parties and estate are discussed at length. She has also investigated possible parts of the friary’s estate by examining toponymic evidence; that is, names of fields and other features recorded in cartographical and oral history sources, as well as in documentary evidence. One name of particular interest is ‘Friars Thorne Farm’ in the westernmost part of Burnham Westgate, some miles from the friary itself. Parts of the former friary estate are referred to in different documents: Table 3 reconstructs nearly all the 68 acres; figure 4 shows the probable changes that the estate underwent after 1538; and figure 5 locates the various parcels on a map. The main point is that the estate did not survive as a single entity.\n\nViewing the site today, one might assume that the friary’s buildings were all demolished or allowed to decay soon after its dissolution, and that the site had no economic function. From Francis’s work, however, it becomes clear that at least some of the buildings, or their remains, were adapted and used for many years; indeed, the friary site was a working farm until at least 1843. In that year the owner, Horatio, 3rd Earl and 4th Baron Walpole, decided to have the crumbling gatehouse restored as an ‘Antiquarian relic’. Most of the other buildings still standing were cleared away at this time. Now the largest remaining structure is the restored gatehouse of c.1320 but the extent of its restoration is unclear. If the restoration is faithful to the original it may include some decorative blind tracery work on the west and east facades which represents the earliest use of that style of wall-surface decoration. But how to clarify this? Francis considers in detail various pictorial sources to try to reconstruct what it looked like prior to restoration (listed in Table 4) and draws conclusions from them: the tracery on the west façade is original, that on the east almost wholly Victorian. She also discusses the friary church, based on descriptions of the subsequent barn over time, but it was cleared away during the gatehouse restoration. She suggests that Walpole preserved the barn’s west gable because it contains a recognisable part of the friary church: an original doorway, remains of the west window, buttresses and niches.\n\nFrancis conducted a survey of the re-use of limestone in Burnham Norton to see whether any pieces of limestone might have come from the friary buildings. Appendix 3 lists the stone survey results. Another standing building is Friary Cottage, heavily modified but with a medieval core, which may have been an infirmary, guesthouse or the prior’s lodgings. Material robbed from the friary is visible in various alterations to that building but other buildings had not been surveyed previously. Identifiable architectural elements from the original friary buildings are listed in Table 5 but the majority of salvaged limestone was reused in a manner described as ‘casual’, that is, not for its original structural function, such as in quoins, window or door openings. Chapter 4 presents a new post-dissolution chronology of the friary, summarising the findings of the previous chapters. Two other appendices discuss the friary’s holy well and springs and, perhaps surprisingly, the use of the site as a prisoner-of-war camp during the First World War.\n\nIn general, many monastic remains are presented today as beautiful medieval ruins and their rather complicated post-dissolution histories have been largely ignored. Francis’s impressive reconstruction of events in the post-dissolution history of Burnham Norton friary, will, she hopes, ‘prove a timely catalyst for others to carry out fruitful studies elsewhere’. Her book certainly provides a model for such projects, although it must be said that most would relate to estates far exceeding 68 acres.\n\nOLD PARISH LIFE A guide for the curious. Parish life in England, broadly from medieval to Victorian times, particularly from c.1500 to c.1700, as revealed in churchwardens’ accounts and other records edited by Justin Lovill (Bunbury Press 2022 xiv+626pp ISBN 978-0-9562046-2-2) £20\n\n‘From medieval to Victorian times the parish, embodied in its church, dominated every local community in England and was the most significant institution in most people’s lives’, but now ‘many a parish church has an abandoned air … bothered only by the occasional curious visitor, a silent reminder of a world that once was’. Sadly, Justin Lovill’s melancholy evocation is not wrong. Whereas local historians appreciate the value of the records generated by the parish and its various officers and how they can be used to bring earlier generations into focus, as Lovill notes, his ‘occasional curious visitor’ may be unaware of what happened in the church, why people did what they did there, and even what Christianity is about.\n\nHis original intention was ‘to string together chronologically’ a selection of varied entries from churchwardens’ accounts (CWAs), augmented by others from parish registers, vestry minute books, church courts presentments and wills, to create a kind of ‘great parish book’ for the whole of England. Once begun it quickly became clear that this was too great an undertaking, not least because of the numerous explanatory footnotes that would be necessary. Instead, Lovill has produced an informal guide to parish life, based mainly on published CWAs from every part of the country (and it does have quite a few explanatory notes). He acknowledges the limitations of the book—it is not comprehensive because CWAs do not cover all aspects of parish life and have other limitations, his approach is anecdotal rather than analytical, the inclusions of many extracts makes the text rather note-like—but it is jam-packed with details.\n\nThe chapters are divided into six groups, all bar one with various subsections. ‘Tour’ guides the reader through the churchyard, the church itself, its bells, paraphernalia (or ‘The church stuff’), upkeep of the building, and routine and people. A few examples will give a flavour of the delights. In 1502 at Worfield (Shropshire) Agnes Haselwood gave 1d towards the painting of the angel before the rood. In 1603 at St Mary, Reading (Berkshire), 2d was paid to the smith for mending the hourglass candlestick (which regulated the length of the sermon). In 1572 at Bungay (Suffolk) 5s was paid to Scottowe the scrivener ‘for mending decayed places in the bible’. Ridding the building of vermin was important: in 1537 at St Mary at Hill (London) 4d was paid to ‘the rat taker for laying of his baite’.\n\nNext comes ‘The old parish year’, starting on 1 January. Technically he could have begun on 25 March (the feast of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin), but anyway Lovill covers all major Christian feasts and celebrations. The third section is ‘Rites of the life cycle’, from baptism and churching, through marriage, to death, burial and beyond. Particularly in these two sections Lovill also makes use of manuals and other writings that instructed priests or ministers regarding the conduct of celebrations, feasts and services, such as the Sarum use or the rite of Durham (‘official’ church texts). Alternatively, he scoured publications such as those by Thomas Becon, including The Reliques of Rome and Actes of Christ and of Antichrist. Becon was a Protestant reformer and one time chaplain to Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset, so he wrote in favour of Reformed religion, contrasting it with what had been done in the pre-Reformation church. Lovill thus throws light on so many religious practices lost long ago (in Protestant England anyway), like the daily rhythm of the bells, the ceremony of the ashes on Ash Wednesday and of Holy Fire on Easter Saturday. In ‘Death, burial and beyond’, having given an account of the conduct of the priest at the death bed as described in the Sarum manual, Lovill makes much use of bequests in wills to show how people provided for their soul’s health or (occasionally) stipulated where they wished to be buried. Richard Ashelworth, rector of St Alphage, Canterbury, wanted to be buried ‘in the chancel ... before the blessed sacrament, so that the priest may stand upon my breast at the beginning of his mass’. The section ends with details of three ‘grand funerals’ which demonstrate how such affairs might be conducted.\n\nNext is ‘The parish and those in need’, looking at the parish poor, outsiders, foundlings, pregnant women, and bastards. In ‘Disorder’, problems that might be brought to light include magic and witchcraft (of course), complaints against ministers and bodysnatching. Needless to say, this section is the most entertaining, but Lovill has provided details of various acts, orders and canons which should have been obeyed as well as scouring his sources for contraventions. In 1622 at Boxgrove (Sussex) five named men and several others were presented for ‘playing at cricket in the churchyard on Sunday, the fifthe of May, after sufficient warning given to the contrary, for three special reasons’, one of which was ‘that a litle childe had like to have her braines beaten out with a cricket batt’. This is the earliest dated mention of a cricket bat in the OED.)\n\nFinally, ‘History intrudes’ through the Reformation, Civil War and Puritans in power, plague and fire. Here Lovill gives a chronological account of changes in the practice of religion and how parishes (outwardly) conformed. Occasionally there are glimpses of the consequences of the dissolution of the monasteries: in 1538 Wing (Buckinghamshire) paid £9 for organs and ornaments and 3s 4d for a glass window that came from Woburn [Abbey]. In 1547 images had to be removed and books in English provided: at St Lawrence, Reading, 7d was paid for ‘paper and inke for pricking the songs in Englishe’ and at Worksop (Nottinghamshire) 2d was paid to ‘darken the images faces’. During the Civil War churches were desecrated by soldiers, so subsequent repairs and cleansing are recorded. After recounting the effects of the Great Fire of London, the book ends on an upbeat note, with charges incurred at St Bartholomew Exchange in 1677 when attending Dr Renn (Christopher Wren) ‘about the several artificers in order to finishing [sic] the church’.\n\nThere are numerous illustrations of the topics being discussed, such as the elaborate parish chests at Dersingham (Norfolk) and Harty (Essex). Also, Lovill has found several decorated initials in parish records, such as the two faces making an A at the beginning of the early parish register (1539) from St Peter, Dunwich (Suffolk); particularly poignant since the church itself was lost to the sea towards the end of the seventeenth century. Initially I was concerned that as, in effect, the numerous entries from CWAs are taken out of context, the whole might give an unbalanced view, leaning towards the sensational, but this is not the case. Lovill is to be congratulated on such an engaging book, particularly given its huge scope. And he has provided copious endnotes, a vast bibliography and two indexes (parishes & places and general). He has presented his ‘curious visitor’ with numerous insights into parish life over the centuries, many of which allow past parishioners to speak for themselves or bring others to the reader’s attention.\n\nTEACH YOURSELF PALAEOGRAPHY A guide for genealogists and local historians by Claire Jarvis (History Press 2022 153pp ISBN 978-0-750-998-772) £17.99\n\nClaire Jarvis says that she had two aims in mind when writing this book: firstly, to provide a guide to different handwriting through time, and secondly, to ‘provide a one-stop reference guide to all the different letter forms, symbols and abbreviations that have been used in English records over time’. The five main chapters cover the first aim. She begins with nineteenth-century handwriting and goes backwards in time (on the basis that genealogists generally work in that direction), moving ‘in easy stages’ to the medieval period, focusing on records that are of particular interest to family historians, although she does concede that some earlier hands are easier to read than later ones. The main point about getting to grips with the handwriting of any period is that one’s skill improves with practice. As the accuracy of one’s work needs to be checked at this learning stage, the book has a series of exercises in transcription with model answers.\n\nJarvis suggests that the nineteenth-century census is a good starting point from which to learn to read eighteenth- and nineteenth-century hands. She covers letters that take more than one form, abbreviations used in documents written in English and some unfamiliar words and idiosyncratic spellings. As well as working through the set exercises, she recommends practising on various documents of the period available through Ancestry or FindMyPast in local archives or local studies libraries (if the reader does not subscribe personally). The chapter ends with suggestions for further practice and resources for these hands, as do all the succeeding chapters.\n\nChapter 2 considers ‘The later seventeenth century’ and covers secretary letter forms in mixed hands, further abbreviations in English, dates and an introduction to documents in Latin (but she emphasises that this is not a Latin course). Some of the more unusual or confusing letter forms are highlighted, in particular capitals, with examples from lists of names, such as jury lists and parish registers. One of the exercises is a bastardy bond and for further practice Jarvis suggests sets of similar bonds that can be accessed on Ancestry. Chapter 3, ‘The sixteenth century: records in English’, examines Elizabethan secretary hand, letters taking more than one form, numbers and money, and dates in sixteenth-century records. Documents considered here include wills, inventories, accounts, letters, parish registers, deeds and court rolls. The letter forms of secretary hand are shown in Appendix C, Table C1. In ‘further practice’, for inventories Jarvis advocates reading a record society volume of such documents to get an idea of their contents and transcribing some parish registers on Ancestry (and submitting corrections where necessary).\n\nAlthough this is not a course in Latin, in Chapter 4 ‘The sixteenth century: Latin’, Jarvis gives examples of handwriting in Latin in such documents as parish registers and manor court rolls that are of interest to genealogists and local historians and that ‘may be understood with a minimal understanding of the Latin language’. Latin abbreviations feature strongly here and ‘further practice’ directs the student to various sets of published Latin manorial documents, some with parallel English translation. The final chapter considers fifteenth-century court hands (secretary and ‘anglicana’ letter forms) thus concentrating on legal records, in particular Chancery and Exchequer records as many of these records contain dated references to individuals and are thus of interest to genealogists. Typical letter forms in court hand are given in Appendix C, Table C2. The examples and exercises here are mostly from documents in The National Archives.\n\nThe blurb on the back states that ‘this is the very first “teach yourself” book on palaeography, covering all the skills that the genealogist needs to read any document that might be found at any date in English archives’. This is a huge but accurate claim insofar as other books on palaeography tend to concentrate on a particular period.\n\nI am in two minds about the book. In the main chapters Jarvis succeeds in her first aim of providing a guide to handwriting through time and in the appendices she has provided information relating to the second: a glossary; transcription conventions; typical letter forms; marks of abbreviation, punctuation and correction; and numbers (numerals, money and dates). The latter section refers to several books that are necessary to have on your shelf (even in this internet age). One of the modern issues that she highlights is that online indexes contain many mistranscriptions. This is a useful book but most of the document reproduced are not full size and so the handwriting is smaller than in the originals. Although A4-size books are annoying to shelve, many books on palaeography are that size in order to provide much more legible reproductions.\n\nHEATHER FALVEY is the Reviews Editor of The Local Historian.\n\nA MURDEROUS MIDSUMMER The Western Rising of 1549 by Mark Stoyle (Yale University Press 2022 xvi+363pp ISBN: 978-0-300266-32-0) £25\n\nMindful that much of the ground is well-trodden by distinguished scholars, Mark Stoyle hopes readers will find that his account of the Western Rising ‘has new and interesting things to say about an episode that remains obscure and mysterious in many respects’. To set the scene, he outlines what Devon and Cornwall were like at the time using the ‘travel-writing’ of the antiquarian John Leland, who journeyed through both counties in the late 1530s and early 1540s. The area was dominated by Exeter, the regional capital of the West Country, centre of local government in Devon and seat of the bishop of Exeter. The principal industry in most Devon towns was cloth-making, sheep abounded, particularly on Exmoor, and tin-mining was important. The physical boundary with Cornwall was (and still is) the river Tamar. The most populous town there was Bodmin, which had 35 religious gilds or fraternities and was where JPs for eastern Cornwall held their quarter sessions. Further west, the estuary of the Fal was protected by the twin castles of Pendennis and St Mawes. The economy of Cornwall, even more so than that of Devon, was built on tin.\n\nKey players in the events, whether protecting the interests of the Crown or of their own jurisdiction, were the aristocracy and leading gentry, such as the Courtenays, Godolphins, Carews and Arudnells. Coincidence, or fate, also played part; for example, Sir Peter Carew inherited the family estates on the death of his brother Sir George in the Mary Rose. Indeed, a tiny wealthy elite held all the levers of power in sixteenth-century Devon and Cornwall but those below them socially did hold the lesser local offices. Regarding religion, as Eamon Duffy and others have revealed, in the early 1500s most ordinary folk remained deeply attached to their traditional faith. However, there was another boundary just to the west of Bodmin—that of language. In west Cornwall most people still spoke Cornish but in the east both commoners and gentry spoke English. Stoyle finds contemporary evidence of ‘at least at times, an undercurrent of ethnic tension between the Cornish—perhaps especially the Cornish-speaking West Cornish—and their English neighbours’. As the story progresses, it becomes clear that this is highly relevant.\n\nObjections to religious change in the 1530s are outlined, including links with the Pilgrimage of Grace in the North and hostility towards Cromwell’s appointees in the region. A decade later religious changes brought about under Protector Somerset were radical and the subsequent controversial visitation of parishes in Devon and Cornwall was carried out by ‘visitors’ appointed by Cranmer. Similarly, appointments to the county benches included known evangelicals and omitted known religious conservatives. In fact, factional conflict was being waged between reformists and their traditional rivals not only in the West Country but between Somerset’s radical regime and its conservative opponents across the entire kingdom.\n\nIn ‘Foreshocks: the disturbances of 1547-48’, Stoyle discusses the activities of William Body, deputy archdeacon of Cornwall, who in 1547 was responsible for enforcing religious change and overseeing the inventories of church goods. On Easter Sunday 1548, for the first time, communion was to be received in both kinds by the laity and, after the celebrant had taken communion, he was to switch from Latin to English to conduct the next part of the service. Stoyle is tempted to suggest that in the Cornish-speaking parishes of West Cornwall this order played a part in sparking the major protest that broke out in the area around St Keverne just four days later. As no contemporary narrative survives, he has pieced events together from various sources, including the lynching of William Body in Helston. The 1000 to 5000 insurgents were eventually pacified and dispersed by local gentlemen, although how remains unclear.\n\nBeginning on 28 January 1549, the third year of Edward VI’s reign was trouble-filled. Arguably the principal causes were two acts of parliament: the Act of Uniformity and ‘the Act for the Relief of Sheep and Cloth’, granting the crown the right to raise money through a new poll tax on sheep and a new purchase tax on cloth. Stoyle argues that these religious innovations and financial impositions, on top of the earlier policies of Edward VI’s regime, hit parishes hard. John Hooker, the first and most influential historian of the ‘Comotion or Rebellion in … Devon and Cornewall’ in 1549, testified that it was the Book of Common Prayer that ‘finally set the spark to the tinder in Devon’. He eventually composed a series of different accounts of the revolt, the chief primary sources on which all subsequent histories of the rebellion have been based. As well as drawing on the well-known version subsequently published by Raphael Holinshed in 1587, Stoyle also uses a shorter (probably earlier) version now in the Bodleian Library. Similar to the 1587 version, it occasionally differs in significant respects, so Stoyle provides a different narrative from those published previously.\n\nUnrest broke out at Sampford Courtenay on Whit Monday 10 June 1549, protesting against the new service. Interestingly, Stoyle has found that in the unpublished Bodleian MS Hooker hints that there had been some sort of prearranged plan for protests on that date in various parishes, but he drew back from this in the published version. On 22 June the protestors moved from Sampford Courtenay to Crediton and Hooker reported that news of events there led the common people to ‘swarme together in great multitudes, some in one place, and some in another’. As a result the watch at Exeter was strengthened. On Sunday 23 June at Exeter disagreements between the leading JPs, Sir Thomas Denys and Sir Hugh Pollard, and Sir Peter Carew and Piers Courtenay, the sheriff, meant that local governors were unable to agree on a concerted course of action. Indeed, at this point Hooker, in the Bodleian MS, notes that Courtenay not only inveighed against Denys and Pollard, but ‘also against the commoners whom he termed to bee rebells’, thus rendering their activities seriously criminal. During the last week of June, rebel captains sent a message to John Blackaller, mayor of Exeter, to join them but, supported by most of the town governors, he refused and ordered the city’s gates to be firmly closed against the protestors.\n\nIn ‘Escalation, 1-15 July 1549’, Stoyle dates the timing of events in Cornwall to early July, rather than early June, as previously assumed. The Cornish story is largely told by the antiquary Richard Carew. Rebels there sent out ‘writings’ in the king’s name to local communities ordering them to send men, munitions and supplies. The main group of Cornish rebels left Bodmin and joined those of Devon at St David’s Down just north of Exeter. Their eventual bloody defeat by Lord Russell’s army is narrated in detail. In ‘Retribution: September 1549’, Stoyle describes the capture and examination of rebel ‘captains’ of relatively high status before their inevitable execution. At least 14 priests died at the hands of local loyalists, and many others were terrorised, fined or otherwise punished. Knowledge of what befell the rebel rank and file is more patchy and impressionistic, but it is clear that it took a long time for the ‘vengeful loyalists to be reined it’. The regime had been severely threatened and, as is well-known, the regent, Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset, was ousted from power in the aftermath. Stoyle has even found evidence that the future Queen Mary may have toyed briefly with the idea of installing herself as regent.\n\nIn this fascinating (and very reasonably priced) book, Stoyle does indeed have new and interesting things to say about the ‘rising’. Even to someone fairly familiar with the story of the 1549 rebellion in the West, he has opened up new facets of that ‘murderous midsummer’. This is a ‘must read’ for anyone interested in the mid-Tudor rebellions: it is local history with national ramifications."
