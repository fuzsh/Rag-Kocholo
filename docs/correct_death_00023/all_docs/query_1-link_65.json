The Museum is located near downtown Ketchum and includes other historical items and memorabilia related to the heritage of the Wood River Valley.\n\nDuring the later part of this life, Ernest Hemingway had strong ties to the Wood River Valley. Making his first trip to Sun Valley in 1939 as a part of a promotional event for the then new Sun Valley Resort, Hemingway returned many times over the next several years. It is reported that he spent time in his designated suite #206 in the Lodge working on his famous book For Whom the Bells Toll.\n\nIn 1959, Hemingway became a resident of the Valley along with his fourth wife, Mary Welsh. He spent time in his home writing and additionally enjoyed all the ambiance of the Ketchum/Sun Valley area. Many of the businesses that he frequented are still in operation today.
