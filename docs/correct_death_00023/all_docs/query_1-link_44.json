        "text": "We walk along the outside porch. Below, the Big Wood River rollicks through tall cottonwood trees, their yellow leaves dropping off and cascading to the dense litter below. A hint of snow from the distant mountains peeks through. Monster homes are scattered along the other side of the bank.\n\nThis isn’t the view Hemingway would have known. Those giant houses weren’t there. Neither were the giant cottonwoods. They were shorter, kept in check by a river that moved with the seasons. Now, development has kept the Big Wood in its banks, and tall cottonwood obscure a view that once stretched to town a mile away.\n\nThe caretaker opens up the door, a big door with the doorknob in the middle, and a musty whiff blows out. It’s the first feeling you get of there being something special about this house, a place locked, sealed up, closed off.\n\nWhen I first walk into the house, I walk through the vestibule, the place where Hemingway killed himself. His gun rack was here. He took his shotgun, loaded a pair of shells, placed it in his mouth and pulled the triggers. Always over the top, Hemingway had to pull two triggers and fire two shells into his brains.\n\nNo bloodstains left. No pellet marks on the walls. Not much of Hemingway left in the house at all really. He didn’t build the house. He didn’t even furnish much of it. Most of it is from the former owner, Toppings. Call it Ketchum’s first monster home.\n\nThe kudu and impala heads over the mantle are his, though. The old trunks marked “Hemingway” are his. They carried stuff he and Mary had brought from Cuba. The room lights up in the morning. The walls are light oak paneling, with photos from their last trip to Spain. Toreadors and Hemingway, old and grizzled. His last hurrah. The dangerous summer.\n\nMost striking are the two picture windows over the Big Wood River. I wonder about those last moments. I wonder if he took a look a last look out across the valley before he stepped into the vestibule, or if he knew what he was going to do and did it.\n\nIt would have been much the same view from his bedroom window, where he slept alone. Mary slept in another room. His typewriter would have sat on a traveling platform, where he wrote, or tried to write, looking across the valley. Did he look out that window that morning? Consider the view? Consider the green coming to the valley? He had almost never seen Idaho green. He knew this place cold and chill.\n\nHad he tried to write that morning and the words didn’t come?\n\nWhat we know is that he walked out of his bedroom, down the red-carpeted steps and strode across the long living room where he and Mary entertained guests. The shotgun. The shells. The vestibule. A blast.\n\nMary would tell the press it was a gun-cleaning accident, but she surely knew the truth.\n\nThis is less the place where Hemingway lived than the place where a different Hemingway might have lived. If he hadn’t shot himself. A modern home with a TV and a hi-fi and a screen for home movies, still stacked there in the vestibule in their tin discs.\n\nThis is the place Hemingway could have lived to old age, seen his children and grandchildren, watched them fly fish on the Big Wood. This isn’t the house where Hemingway lived. This is the house where Hemingway died."
