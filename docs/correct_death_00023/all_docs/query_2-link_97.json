        "text": "By Carmen McGarry | Contributing Columnist\n\nIn the midst of Key West stands a tribute to literary giant Ernest Hemingway, the home (now a museum) where he enjoyed life during the 1930s.\n\nBorn in Oak Park, Illinois, Hemingway’s birthplace is maintained there as a museum offering guided tours. His father Clarence was a medical doctor and his mother, Grace, an operatic singer and composer who taught music and voice lessons. His father, a sportsman, loved hunting, fishing and adventure, which greatly influenced Hemingway’s life and writings.\n\nHe began his career as a reporter, soon left his job to serve as an American Red Cross ambulance driver during World War I and was seriously wounded. Despite the injury that prevented him from fighting, his experiences contributed much to his fiction. After the war, he served as a news correspondent and settled in Paris. He soon became part of the American expatriates, including F. Scott Fitzgerald, Gertrude Stein, Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot. They worked by day and drank by night.\n\nWhen he returned home, a friend had told him about Key West. He spent long periods of time there as well as in Spain and Africa. Serving as correspondent in Spain and later as a reporter for the U.S. Army, he still loved the southernmost tip of America.\n\nHemingway had four marriages, three of them of short duration. His first was to Hadley Richardson whom he married in 1921. They lived much of the time in Paris. In 1927, he married fashion journalist Pauline Pfeiffer. They lived on and off in Key West, spending summers in Wyoming. In Key West he soon became enamored with deep-sea fishing and purchased his own boat, Pilar. He named himself “Papa Hemingway” and sailed with his friends who were known as the Key West Mob.\n\nIn 1940, he married Martha Gellhorn, a war correspondent. In 1946, he married another war correspondent Mary Welsh with whom he lived until his death in 1961. It was she who became the administrator of his works and who established the PEN/Hemingway Award.\n\nAt the time of his death by suicide, the couple were living in Idaho after almost two decades in Cuba. In Key West, Hemingway bought a house built in 1848 and designed by Asa Tift, a marine architect and salvage wrecker. Located across the street from the Key West Lighthouse, it became a museum in 1964 and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1968. The second story of the house was his writing studio and the basement a wine cellar. Today, all the rooms are open to the public, except the writing room which is seen through a screen.\n\nHe also kept peacocks on the property as well as organized boxing matches on the lawn.\n\nLegend reports a fellow sailor and ship captain presented Hemingway with a male cat with six toes named Snowball when he lived in Key West. Polydactyl cats were known among sailors for their rat-hunting skills and as a source of good fortune. Snowball seemed to love life with its pleasures and sexual liberation, and thus began many generations of six and seven-toed cats that still reside on the Hemingway Home. Today, more than 50 cats call it home and bear the names of celebrities such as Humphrey Bogart and Marilyn Monroe.\n\nIn 1952, Hemingway wrote “The Old Man and the Sea” which won the Pulitzer Prize in Fiction. In 1954, he won the Nobel Prize in Literature. He is noted for his concise writing style and influence on 20th Century writers. Other contributions include “A Farewell to Arms,” “For Whom the Bell Tolls,” “The Snows of Kilimanjaro,” and to “Have and Have Not.”\n\nKey West’s annual Hemingway Days returns July 17 to 21 and includes the Hemingway Look-Alike Contest, Running of the Bulls (with wooden bulls strolled by runners), fishing contest, storytelling of Hemingway, and various parties. Look-alike contestants are judged not only on their physical appearance and resemblance to Hemingway, but also on their zest for life."
