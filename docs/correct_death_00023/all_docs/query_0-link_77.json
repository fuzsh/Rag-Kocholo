        "text": "Overview\n\nErnest Hemingway took his own life in 1961 and was buried in the Ketchum cemetery. In 1966, a memorial was erected by his family and friends. The bronze bust of Hemingway and accompanying plaque was dedicated on July 21, 1966, which would have been the famous author's 67th birthday. The inscription on the plaque reads:\n\nBest of all he loved the fall\n\nthe leaves yellow on cottonwoods\n\nleaves floating on trout streams\n\nand above the hills\n\nthe high blue windless skies\n\n…Now he will be a part of them forever.\n\nLocation/Directions\n\nOne mile east of the Sun Valley Lodge on Trail Creek Rd.\n\nHours/Seasons\n\nThe Hemingway Memorial is open and accessible year round.\n\nFees/Cost\n\nThere is no cost or fee to visit the Memorial.\n\nMore Info\n\nIn 1939, Hemingway made his first trip to the area. Initially invited to the Sun Valley Resort as a part of the company's plan to use celebrities to lure tourists, Hemingway fell in love with the area. He worked on For Whom the Bells Tolls while staying in a luxury suite at the Sun Valley Lodge.\n\nTwenty years later, Hemingway established a residence in the Wood River Valley. In his home, he worked on two more works – A Moveable Feast and The Garden of Eden. Hemingway was an avid hunter and enjoyed duck hunting with friends who came to visit him. The beauty of the Wood River Valley is thought to have provided inspiration to Hemingway."
