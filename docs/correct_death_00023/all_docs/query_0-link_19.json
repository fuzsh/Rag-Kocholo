        "text": "On our way to Sun Valley we detoured into the cemetery to view Ernest Hemingway's grave.\n\nIt literally was a flying visit, off the coach check out the graves, take a few snaps and make our way out.\n\nNot much else to say, it's a small cemetery, well kept and worth a stop\n\nRead the directions below my entry and you will have no problem finding this very modest grave site.No one there while we visited- it is surprisingly ultra low key\n\nIt feels a little odd to review a cemetary but I am a fan of Hemingway so I was interested in taking a look at his grave site.\n\nIt wasn't easy to find if you don't where to look.\n\nHis grave is located under an evergreen tree if you are trying to find it.\n\nThere was lots of trinkets as well as books, beer cans, cigarettes, etc. left on his grave which I'm sure he'd find that interesting and humorous."
