        "text": "At the end of 1940, with money earned from For Whom the Bell Tolls, Hemingway and Martha bought a house in Cuba, La Finca Vigia. He would live there longer than any other place in his life − 21 years.\n\nThat year he signed a letter opposing the FBI’s arrest of Detroit citizens accused of violating the Neutrality Act by having encouraged enlistments for the Spanish Republican cause. Two years later, when the FBI officially opened a file on Hemingway, this letter was cited:\n\n“When the Bureau was attacked early in 1940 as a result of the arrests in Detroit…Mr. HEMINGWAY was among the signers of a declaration which severely criticized the Bureau in that case.”\n\nAnother 1942 memo to J. Edgar Hoover stated:\n\n“Hemingway, it will be recalled, joined in attacking the Bureau in 1940, at the time of the ‘general smear campaign’ following the arrests of certain individuals in Detroit…”\n\nHemingway was a “premature anti-fascist,” a term (possibly invented by J. Edgar Hoover) used for the Americans who fought for the Spanish Republic and against fascism before the U.S. government joined the battle. All the “premature anti-fascists” were subjected to years of FBI surveillance and harassment.\n\nIn April 1941, the Pulitzer Prize Committee unanimously voted For Whom the Bell Tolls the best American novel of 1940. But it did not receive the Pulitzer Prize. Nicholas Butler Murray, the fascist-sympathizer president of Columbia University (which administers the Pulitzer), vetoed the nomination; the book was “obscene, vulgar, and revolting.” No Pulitzer for literature was awarded that year.\n\nIn Europe one country after another fell to the Nazis. Britain and the Soviet Union put up strong resistance; the armed forces and the citizens of both countries suffered severely. The United States finally entered the war after Pearl Harbor was bombed on December 7, 1941.\n\nToo old to be a soldier, Hemingway came up with other ways to fight the Nazis.\n\nTHE CROOK FACTORY, OPERATION FRIENDLESS, AND THE F.B.I.\n\nIn May 1942, at the instigation and authorization of the U.S. Ambassador to Cuba, Spruille Braden, Hemingway organized a crew of 26, many of them in exile from the Franco regime, into a group he called the “Crook Factory.” Their purpose: to engage in counter-intelligence of fascists in Cuba.\n\nThe Crook Factory recruits came mostly from the anti-fascist Basque Club of Havana, and included jai alai players, former bullfighters, a Catholic priest who’d been a Loyalist machine gunner, waiters, Cuban fishermen, Spanish noblemen in exile, and assorted “wharf rats and bums.” They began operating in September 1942 with a monthly budget of $500 paid by the Embassy. Headquarters was at La Finca Vigia, where meetings were held and operatives reported information. Hemingway stayed up through the night writing reports, then drove 12 miles to deliver them to Robert Joyce, the Second Secretary of the Embassy, who had been placed in charge of the Embassy’s intelligence activities.\n\nHemingway detractors have ridiculed both the effort and the need. The detractors are wrong on both accounts.\n\nOf the 300,000 Spaniards then living in Cuba, an estimated 30,000 were “dedicated Falangists” (Spanish fascists) who were active and dangerous to American interests, according to Ambassador Braden. Cuba had deep historical ties with Spain and many Cubans were sympathetic to fascism, including the owner-editor of Havana’s most influential newspaper. Ambassador Braden “documented the Spanish Embassy’s clandestine support of the Falange” and the possibility that Falangists in Cuba were gathering information on military preparations, refueling German U-boats, and engaging in sabotage.\n\nMeanwhile, the German spy agency Abwehr snuck spies into Cuba as well as into the United States. Hemingway biographer Carlos Baker notes that “the arrival of foreign spies [in Cuba] was especially dangerous because of…German submarines” then preying upon tankers and cargo ships in the Caribbean. The Cuban Bureau of Investigation made 50 arrests for espionage in April 1942. Two German spies were put on trial in September, and one got a death sentence.\n\nIn July 1942, the FBI assigned Raymond G. Leddy to Havana as the attaché (and the FBI’s Special Agent) to the Embassy. (Leddy’s curriculum vitae is included in the notes to this section.)\n\nShortly after Leddy’s arrival, Hemingway introduced him, at a jai alai match, as a member of the American Gestapo. That remark infuriated Leddy and the FBI, and was cited in Hemingway’s FBI file for years to come.\n\nThe first document in the file is Leddy’s memo of October 8 to J. Edgar Hoover. Leddy informed the Director of the arrangement Hemingway had with the Ambassador, and expressed concern because of Hemingway’s Gestapo remark and his having signed the 1940 protest over arrests of Spanish Civil War recruits.\n\nEvidently the FBI was watching Hemingway before that October 8 memo. In December 1942 Hoover wrote that Hemingway’s judgment was questionable “if his sobriety is the same as it was years ago.” (Emphasis supplied.)\n\nWithin a short time Leddy warned FBI headquarters that Hemingway might expose “corruption in the Cuban government.” This prospect alarmed Leddy; he was “quite concerned” that Hemingway’s activities would be “very embarrassing unless something is done to put a stop to them.”\n\nLeddy’s FBI supervisor told Hoover of Leddy’s concerns and suggestions, which included pointing out to Ambassador Braden\n\n“…the extreme danger of having some informant [against Nazis] like Hemingway given free rein to stir up trouble such as that which will undoubtedly ensue if this situation continues….Leddy can handle this situation with the Ambassador so that Hemingway’s services as an informant will be completely discontinued. Mr. Leddy…can point out to the Ambassador that Hemingway is going further than just an informant; that he is actually branching out into an investigative organization of his own which is not subject to any control whatsoever.”\n\nTwo days later Hoover replied that the FBI would do nothing, noting that Ambassador Braden was “somewhat hot-headed” and would immediately tell Hemingway of FBI objections. Hoover also noted that Hemingway had ties to the White House.\n\nHowever, Hoover sanctioned Leddy’s wish to discredit Hemingway. Hoover wrote to Leddy that “any information…relating to the unreliability of Ernest Hemingway as an informant may discreetly be brought to the attention of the Ambassador.”\n\nIn late 1942 Hemingway enlisted a trusted friend to take over coordination of the Crook Factory, although several incidents show that he kept active in its operations.\n\nIn December, a week before Cuban president Batista and Ambassador Braden were to go to Washington, Hemingway warned that General Benitez, Chief of the Cuban National Police, was making plans for a coup in their absence. Leddy claimed to investigate and to have found no such preparations; “the danger of alienating police cooperation by this type of report was also pointed out to Mr. Joyce [head of Embassy’s intelligence].” But a few months later, Ambassador Braden learned of a plot by Benitez and other officers to seize the presidency. The plot was foiled.\n\nAlso in December 1942, Hemingway reported to the Embassy that an Italian fascist leader interned at a Cuban hospital for medical treatment was not actually ill but had paid off Chief Benitez, and that FBI agent Leddy had taken the police chief at his word without investigation. Subsequently Hemingway notified the Embassy that the Italian fascist had attended a luncheon honoring a Spanish diplomat. Ambassador Braden was greatly disturbed and asked Leddy to investigate. Leddy said he found no evidence that the Italian had attended the luncheon. The FBI memo reported that Hemingway wanted to see the FBI’s proof of that. The FBI’s response was not recorded.\n\nOn February 10, 1943 Hemingway wrote a detailed report to Ambassador Braden explaining why the new assistant legal attaché, FBI agent Ed Knoblaugh, was “unsuited” to investigate Falangist activity, since he was likely a Falangist sympathizer. Raymond Leddy opposed transferring Knoblaugh. More importantly, he was outraged.\n\nKnoblaugh, in fact, was a Falangist sympathizer, or at the least an apologist.\n\nWhen the Spanish Civil War broke out in 1936, Knoblaugh was the head of the Associated Press office in Madrid. He covered the Nationalist (Falangist) side of the conflict, and later wrote a book, Correspondent in Spain, which provided much compelling evidence for Hemingway’s objections. For example, Knoblaugh promoted the false claim that most of the damage to Guernica had not been from German bombs but had been caused by Republicans themselves, and backed up his claim by citing a joint statement of news correspondents. But “this ‘joint statement’ never existed.” Nevertheless, Knoblaugh’s “view eventually became gospel among conservative American Catholics.” Worse than that, Knoblaugh’s claim gave Secretary of State Hull an excuse for continuing America’s embargo on weapons to the Republic. Knoblaugh proclaimed that the bombing of Guernica was fortunate propaganda for the Republic; he also stated, perhaps not aware of being inconsistent, that the bombing was justified because the town “was used as a Loyalist military base” and was “in the path of Franco’s march on Bilbao.”\n\nOn December 9, 1942 the Pilar saw a German Model 740 submarine make contact with a Spanish steamer. They reported this immediately, via shortwave radio, to the U.S. Naval Attaché. The submarine sped away on a north-northwest course.\n\nThe FBI investigated and claimed to find “negative results.” The U.S. Navy, however, kept that Spanish steamer under close watch for the next few months. And when the Pilar set out again on January 20, 1943, it was assigned to patrol the same area, and “ordered to pay particular attention to the movements” of the Spanish ship, indicating that “not everyone shared the FBI’s skepticism about Hemingway’s earlier report.”\n\nThe Pilar crew learned that, several days after they’d seen it, the submarine “landed three men at the mouth of the Mississippi River,” near New Orleans.\n\nAmbassador Braden later wrote that on one occasion the Pilar was “lying off the coast about 100 miles west of Havana in a place where [Hemingway] was sure submarines would surface, when my Naval attaché, for some trivial reason, called him in. The next morning an aviator spotted a submarine in the exact place where Ernest had been lying in wait.”\n\nThe critical nature of Hemingway’s efforts was driven home by two tragic incidents. On March 31, 1943 the Pilar returned to home port for repairs. The very next day, a German U-boat torpedoed and sank a Norwegian freighter in that exact patrol area, and two days later an American tanker.\n\nSneers by Martha Gellhorn and others that Hemingway used the patrols as a way to obtain gas for the Pilar so he could go fishing are either misguided or scurrilous. Of course the crew had to fish; that was their cover. And the fish they caught helped to supplement their diet. But the conditions were uncomfortable at best. The boat was packed with men and equipment. Hemingway himself stood on the bridge from dawn to dusk on a leg that had been shattered and rebuilt in WWI, while the boat rolled and pitched, under a blazing sun with plenty of insects to add to the misery. Equipment and arms took up all the room in the head (bathroom), rendering it unusable. Hemingway would be held financially responsible for the very expensive gear he’d signed for.\n\nIn fact, there was a possibility they’d have to throw that gear overboard; it would be a dead give-away of their true intentions should the Germans board the Pilar. Hemingway came up with the idea of posing as a scientific vessel engaged in research on fishing conditions and he hung a sign identifying the Pilar as working for the American Museum of Natural History. The Naval Attache procured a letter to this effect.\n\nThe crew faced immense danger. No boat was considered too insignificant by the Nazis. For instance, near Havana one U-boat destroyed a small boat carrying three men and a load of onions. And there was certainly no guarantee that any survivors would be spared; on two separate occasions early in 1942, the Germans torpedoed freighters, then machine gunned the crews as they lowered the life boats.\n\nHemingway became a front-line correspondent for Collier’s National Weekly in April 1944. He was at Omaha Beach on D-Day in June, flew on missions with the RAF, and was with Patton’s army in France and at the liberation of Paris on August 25. He was briefly held on charges of being an armed newspaper correspondent. In Luxembourg to cover the Battle of the Bulge, he came down with pneumonia and was hospitalized.\n\nWhile in England, Hemingway met Mary Welsh, another war correspondent. After the war he returned to La Finca with her, and they were married in 1946.\n\nTHE COLD WAR\n\nIn 1947, Hemingway supported an expedition (ultimately unsuccessful) to overthrow Rafael Trujillo in the Dominican Republic. One of the young revolutionaries involved was Fidel Castro, then in high school.\n\nBut Hemingway had “foolishly given money to the cause in the form of personal checks.” A few months later, a friend flew him out of the country ahead of his being arrested for his role in the plot. The Cuban police came to La Finca to search it and held Mary at gunpoint. When the soldiers left, they took all the Hemingways’ guns with them, but returned them the next day. By the time Ernest returned to Cuba, things had blown over.\n\nIt would not be the last police raid on La Finca.\n\nIt could be said that 1948 was a turning point in the U.S. The Soviet Union, a staunch ally in the War, was now an enemy. The two countries were engaged in an arms race and wrangling over the fate of Europe.\n\nThe Hollywood Ten hearings and blacklists had occurred in 1947. In 1948 HUAC took testimony from Elizabeth Bentley and Whittaker Chambers, and when no indictments resulted, J. Edgar Hoover pressured HUAC to quickly start hearings.\n\nHUAC kept a file on Hemingway, but did not call him. One biographer speculates that this was because the files showed he wasn’t a Communist, but of course that had never stopped HUAC. More likely they feared his fame and stature − and his courage.\n\nHemingway openly condemned McCarthyism. In the mid-1950s he famously wrote in Look Magazine that he wondered if there was “anything wrong with Sen. Joseph McCarthy (Republican) of Wisconsin which a .577 solid would not cure.”\n\nIn 1948 Hoover engaged in massive data collection for anything and everything that could help candidate Thomas Dewey, including information about President Truman. Allegedly Hoover was motivated by Truman’s creation of the CIA, which eroded Hoover’s authority. The FBI was also busily engaged in disrupting the presidential campaign of Henry Wallace, a viable third-party candidate (and, as it turned out, the last such). One newspaper wrote:\n\n“The autumn of 1948 was a dangerous moment in American democracy. As the civilian leader in the war on communism, Hoover was no longer obeying the president….Hoover sought sweeping national security powers over law enforcement and intelligence, sufficient to make him a secret police tsar…Hoover wanted to detain thousands of politically suspect American citizens in the event of a crisis with the Soviets…[he] drew up plans for the mass detention of political suspects in military stockades; a secret prison system for jailing American citizens…”\n\n1948 may also have been a turning point for Hemingway. He began to distrust phones and mail after an “inside source” told him that “censors in Miami had orders to hold all of his mail for two weeks.”\n\nThat spring he met A. E. Hotchner, whose employer, Cosmopolitan magazine, sent him to Cuba to ask Hemingway to write an article. The two became friends and created what they called the Hemhotch Syndicate to bet on steeplechases. Later they incorporated in New Jersey as H&H Corporation; under its auspices Hotchner adapted Hemingway’s works and sold them to television, and received 50% of the income.\n\nMany of Hemingway’s friends disliked and distrusted Hotchner, believing he was on the make and that he brought out the worst in Hemingway. Valerie Danby-Smith, Hemingway’s secretary, described Hotchner surreptitiously taping Hemingway and his friends on many occasions in 1959-60. That may explain the numerous lengthy conversations Hotchner includes word-for-word in Papa Hemingway, a Personal Memoir. He either tape recorded his friends, or changed Hemingway’s letters into conversations without informing the readers (one of Hotchner’s explanations). Neither possibility speaks well of Hotchner’s integrity. (Hotchner offers several explanations, some contradictory, which are included in the notes.)\n\n1948 was also the year that Alfred Rice, who would cause many problems for Hemingway, became his lawyer. Early in their relationship Rice suggested tax loopholes; Hemingway told him that no “dishonorable, shady, borderline, or ‘fast’” action would be taken and that Hemingway himself, not Rice, would judge whether an action was “honorable and ethnical, not simply legally, but according to my own personal standards.”\n\nThe Old Man and The Sea was written in 1951 and published September 1, 1952, both in Life Magazine and as a hardcover book of the month club selection.\n\nIn January 1954, Hemingway and Mary were in Africa when their plane crashed. They escaped serious injury but the plane couldn’t be used, and a second plane was sent to rescue them. That plane also crashed, and caught fire. Mary and the pilot were able to squeeze out but Hemingway was too big. He had to use his head as a battering ram. Because the accident occurred far from a major city, he was not hospitalized for several days, and most of his injuries were not diagnosed for weeks. They included a fractured skull; ruptured spleen, kidney and liver; crushed vertebrae; first degree burns; dislocated shoulder; and a paralyzed sphincter. He also temporarily lost his vision in one eye and hearing in one ear. His skull was actually “broken open.”\n\nAfterward Hemingway aged visibly and became, in the words of some of his friends, old. He was 55.\n\nIn October 1954, he won the Nobel Prize for literature.\n\nA year later, he nearly died from a kidney infection and other organ diseases caused by the accident. He tired more easily and for a long time he could not travel. The lack of physical vitality was completely new to him. Writing was physically difficult. He could not sit for very long, due to the injury to his spine, and did his writing while standing.\n\nHe continued to write and worked on several books, but for the last ten years of his life he published none. Both A Moveable Feast and Islands in the Stream were published posthumously.\n\nBy this time Hemingway considered Cuba his home, although he spent time in Idaho every year. Most of his books, research, art and memorabilia were at La Finca Vigia. And so were most of his pets. One was a dog Hemingway and Mary had befriended in Idaho in winter of 1947-48 who had become Hemingway’s constant companion: Black Dog.\n\nREVOLUTION IN CUBA\n\nIn late 1956 Batista’s police searched La Finca, looking for rebel guns. Apparently Hemingway’s status as a Nobel Prize winner was no deterrent to the increasingly desperate Batista regime. Black Dog, old and nearly blind and deaf, snapped at a soldier, who struck the animal in the head with a rifle butt and killed him. Hemingway was devastated and, “ignoring the urgent advice from everyone,” lodged a formal complaint. Nothing came of the complaint, but the Cuban people knew of it and respected Hemingway enormously for making it.\n\nHemingway “never completely recovered from the loss of Black Dog.” Four years later he still mourned.\n\nIn early 1957, Herbert Matthews of the New York Times came to Cuba to meet with the rebels and to disprove Batista’s claim that Castro was dead. He dined at La Finca with his old friend Hemingway (they’d both worked in Spain as journalists and both supported the Republic). Hemingway encouraged Matthews’s praise of and respect for Castro. Matthews later expressed appreciation since he was otherwise standing alone among U.S. newspapermen.\n\nHemingway got another dog, Machakos, to provide some protection against Batista’s soldiers. But at 4 a.m. one morning in August 1957 La Finca was again raided by a government patrol looking for a rebel fugitive. A soldier shot and killed Machakos.\n\nMonths later, Hemingway wrote to a friend that the soldier who had killed Machakos and “tortured several of the boys of the village” had himself been executed by “the boys of Cottorro” (revolutionaries).\n\nHemingway was concerned about another raid should his political profile increase, and so, a few months after that second raid, he and his Cuban first mate Gregorio Fuentes went out on the Pilar and threw an assortment of guns into the sea. Fuentes later said these were arms that Hemingway had allowed him to hide for the revolutionary movement.\n\nAfter Castro called for a general strike and Batista authorized citizens to shoot strikers, most Cubans avoided public places. When the guerrillas began kidnapping Americans in Cuba, Hemingway wrote a friend that\n\n“Kidnappings are the latest local sport. They now have mining engineers, sugar mill technicians, consular officials, seamen (all ratings) and Marines − I called the Embassy to ask when they were going to start picking up the F.B.I.”\n\nMeanwhile Hemingway had to deal with an attempt by his lawyer, Alfred Rice, to disgrace Hemingway’s political integrity. Hemingway had refused Esquire magazine permission to republish some of his stories in an anthology because he was planning to revise and publish them himself in a new collection; as a peace offering, he said that Esquire could publish one story. But Rice filed court papers arguing that Hemingway would be damaged if the stories were reprinted because they’d been written when the Soviet Union was an ally but it was now “our greatest enemy.” This was reported by The New York Times. Hemingway immediately contacted the Times, which ran a story the next day reporting that Hemingway “sharply denied” that his views had changed. “Those statements were made by my lawyer, Alfred Rice, and I have just called him up and given him hell for it.”\n\nHemingway divided his time between Cuba and Ketchum, Idaho, and was in Ketchum in January 1959 when the Cuban Revolution was successful.\n\nA Cuban friend called Hemingway right away to say he’d been appointed as head of the provisional government and was personally protecting La Finca. Hemingway also heard from New York Times reporter Matthews and from people working at La Finca that all was well there.\n\nNews services immediately called Hemingway for comment. “I believe in the historical necessity for the Cuban revolution, and I believe in its long range aims,” Hemingway told newspapers. Enlarging his statement for the New York Times, he added that he was “delighted” with the Revolution. Upon Mary’s urging, he changed “delighted” to “hopeful.”\n\nWhen the Cuban government immediately began putting Batista’s soldiers on trial, newspapers and politicians in the United States expressed concern and outrage. “Executions in Cuba Protested,” “Military Court in Cuba Dooms 14 for ‘War Crimes’; Senator Morse Urges End of ‘Blood Baths’”, “US Will Speed Envoy to Havana”, “The Spectacle in Havana” are just some of the headlines in the New York Times in January 1959.\n\nA newspaper article headlined “Hemingway Defends Cuban Trials” was published on January 23, 1959. A second article, headlined “Hemingway Talks on Cuba; ‘I’ve Great Hope for Castro,’ Says Trials, Executions of Batistans Necessary” was published on March 9, 1959. Neither article ran in a major newspaper.\n\nThe first, published alongside a description of the first trial of a Batista soldier, ran in the Eugene (Oregon) Register-Guard and cited a telephone interview on radio station KING, in which “Hemingway condemned the Batista group as torturers and murderers.” Hemingway added that twelve boys from his own village in Cuba had been tortured and killed, and concluded, “I don’t think people outside the country have any business to criticize the justice of the trials since the trials are public and witnesses are heard and an impartial decision is given.”\n\nThe second article was published in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. The writer had spent an afternoon with Hemingway in Ketchum. “I believe in the cause of the Cuban people,” Hemingway said. While some of Batista’s officials and police were good and honest, many were “thieves, sadists and torturers. They tortured kids.” Hemingway said that bodies were found horribly mutilated and he “cataloged in unprintable details the methods of torture used by Batista police.” He said that if the government didn’t execute the torturers, the people would, and vendettas would follow. The trials gave people a respect for law and order. And the revolution depended in part on a promise to the Cuban people that those responsible for atrocities would be punished. Regarding one man who’d been executed recently, “ ‘I know him,’ he said. ‘If they shot him a hundred times it wouldn’t be enough punishment for the terrible things he has done.’”\n\nHemingway returned to Cuba on March 29, 1959 and stayed until April 22. Meanwhile, in February the United States had assigned a new ambassador to Cuba: Philip Bonsal.\n\nUpon learning of the Cubans’ proposed trip to the United Nations, Hemingway asked for a meeting with Castro, to brief the Cubans on American politicians and to warn them of tricks and traps by the media and of heckling. Castro sent an associate who met with Hemingway for several hours. When he left, Hemingway asked him to let his comrades know that he strongly supported the actions of the revolution.\n\nIn July Castro appeared on the American TV show “This Is Your Life”, and quoted Hemingway as approving executions of military criminals in Cuba.\n\nFrom May until October, 1959, Hemingway was in Spain. On November 4, 1959, he flew into Cuba and held a press conference at Rancho Boyeros (now José Martí) Airport. American Embassy employee J. L. Topping immediately reported to the FBI that Hemingway told journalists he completely supported the Castro government and that it was best thing that had ever happened to Cuba; that he didn’t believe information published abroad against Cuba; and that he sympathized with the Cuban government and “all our difficulties.” Topping added that Hemingway himself had emphasized “our” and when asked about that, said he hoped Cubans wouldn’t regard him as Yanqui but as another Cuban. With that, he kissed the Cuban flag.\n\nThe Hemingways went back and forth from Ketchum to Cuba over the next few months. In early March, Anastas Mikoyan, the Soviet foreign minister in Havana, visited La Finca. Mikoyan was a great admirer of Hemingway and presented him with Russian translations of his complete works. Mikoyan promised Hemingway the royalties he was due, which had been frozen in the USSR, but Hemingway said he could not accept unless royalties were paid to all American writers published in the USSR.\n\nWhen the Hemingways returned to Ketchum for hunting season, they were driving through town on a snowy night when Hemingway noticed lights on at the bank. One friend with him guessed it was the cleaning ladies; the other friend thought it must be the bank manager working late. Hemingway disagreed and said that the FBI was checking his accounts because “they want to get something on us.” Mary told him he must be tired. She later wrote that she’d never seen him “so disturbed about an imagined, illusory threat.”\n\nAccording to one source, Hemingway “said several times that he wanted to write a book about the Cuban Revolution.”\n\nIn May 1960, Hemingway and Fidel Castro met for the only time. Both attended the annual Hemingway fishing competition. Castro told Hemingway that the strategy used by the guerrillas in For Whom the Bell Tolls had given him ideas that were put to use by Cuban revolutionaries in the Sierra Maestra. Many photographs were taken; Hemingway had several prints developed and sent one to the Cuban premier with a dedication, “To Dr. Fidel Castro…in friendship.” Castro kept the photograph on his office wall next to a picture of his father.\n\nThat same month, May 1960, Raymond G. Leddy, who was now working for the State Department, testified to a Senate subcommittee on the dangers posed by Fidel Castro.\n\nA few months earlier, in March 1960, a French freighter, La Coubre, unloading 76 tons of munitions in Havana, suddenly exploded. 100 people died. Cuba accused the U.S. of sabotage. On June 30, Cuba nationalized the Texaco refinery. The appropriation was greeted with outrage in the United States, but the press neglected to mention that Texaco and other oil companies were refusing to refine crude oil for Cuba.\n\nHemingway presciently remarked to Hotchner, “I hope to Christ the United States doesn’t cut the sugar quota. That would really tear it. It will make Cuba a gift to the Russians.” But in July the U.S. reduced its quota of Cuban sugar. The USSR picked up the slack.\n\nDespite his awareness of the tension between the two countries that he believed was becoming dangerous and irrevocable, Hemingway continued to travel back and forth for a period of nineteen months after the Revolution. Diplomacy still existed, albeit an uneasy one. Travel wasn’t prohibited and many Americans visited Cuba. La Finca was often host to visitors, including Antonio Ordóñez, the Spanish bullfighter; Hotchner; the journalist Herbert Matthews; and friends from Idaho and Key West. Valerie Danby-Smith later wrote that “a number of other friends from the States popped over to Havana that spring [1960].” Hemingway also ran into famous people in Havana in 1959 and 1960, including Joseph Alsop, critic Kenneth Tynan, journalist George Plimpton, and playwright Tennessee Williams. Given that, and because of his fame and prestige, perhaps Hemingway believed his continued residency in Cuba was not endangered.\n\nTHE ULTIMATUM\n\nIn early 1960, a seminal event occurred, one that went unreported in the press and has even been omitted by most Hemingway biographers. Ambassador Bonsal came to La Finca and told Hemingway that the U.S. was probably going to break diplomatic relations with Cuba, and that “Washington” wanted Hemingway to stop living in Cuba and to denounce Castro and the Cuban regime. Hemingway objected to doing either, and Bonsal pressed harder: He said that Hemingway’s high-profile presence in Havana could become an embarrassment to the United States. He added that discussions amongst officials had included the word “traitor.”\n\nHemingway was shaken by the threat but didn’t back down. He stayed “at his home [in Cuba] working as a deliberate gesture to show his sympathy and support for the Castro Revolution.”\n\nThe night before Ambassador Bonsal left for the U.S. in late January, he visited La Finca again and reiterated the ultimatum. It had become even more important, he said, for Hemingway to “make an open choice between his country and his home — loudly and clearly, so the world would know where he stood.”\n\nHemingway still did not denounce the Cuban Revolution or Fidel Castro.\n\nOn July 25, Hemingway left for Key West. He planned on returning in the autumn and left La Finca fully staffed. He didn’t bring his books, paintings, or many of his manuscripts. He deliberately left without fanfare so that no one would think his leaving could be misinterpreted as a statement against Castro, whom he continued to support.\n\nHe would never be able to return.\n\nThe United States had already begun covert plans to overthrow the Cuban government, and on August 18, 1960, President Eisenhower authorized $13 Million in funding to a group created by the Deputy Director of the CIA. A few months later the CIA began training thousands of ex-Cubans in a plan to invade Cuba. The plan was called “Operation Zapata” and when it was put into action in April of 1961 it became known to history as the Bay of Pigs.\n\nOn Sept 20, 1960, Castro led a large Cuban delegation to New York City for meetings at the United Nations. This was the famous visit during which the Cubans stayed at the Hotel Theresa in Harlem and dined with the hotel workers while thousands of supporters filled the streets of Harlem.\n\nCastro’s speech to the UN was on September 26. The delegation returned to Cuba on September 28. On September 30 the U.S. told diplomats and others to send their wives and children home. On October 15, Cuba began the most extensive nationalization ever in the western hemisphere. The U.S. trade embargo was announced on October 19, and Ambassador Bonsal was recalled on October 20. Cuba’s nationalization continued on October 25.\n\nMost properties owned by US citizens were nationalized. La Finca Vigia was not.\n\nAfter spending a few months in Spain for research, Hemingway joined Mary in New York City on October 10, 1960, and holed up in her apartment because he believed he was being followed. Mary “lost patience and asked him to quit acting like a fugitive from justice.”\n\nThey soon left for Ketchum. Arriving at the Idaho train station, Hemingway glanced across the street, noticed two men in topcoats, and said they were agents tailing him. Mary observed that the men were not wearing “the usual Western dress of parkas or ranchers’ garb,” but told Hemingway not to be silly.\n\nBETRAYAL AND INCARCERATION\n\nIn November 1960, a month after he got to Ketchum, Hemingway and a friend picked up Hotchner at the same train station and Hemingway said that agents had followed them from Ketchum, that his car and phone were bugged, and that his mail had been intercepted. Hemingway also referred to a phone call he’d had with Hotchner that was cut off in such a way that he suspected a wiretap gone awry but Hotchner argued against there being any sinister reason for the malfunction. When they arrived in Ketchum that night, Hemingway pointed out the bank lights with two men working in back at a counter. They were auditors, he said, going through his accounts.\n\nNowadays these incidents are cited as proof of Hemingway’s paranoia. But in rural Idaho in 1960, men did not wear suits; people did not work in offices late at night as they do today; and the town was more or less shut down, with only one bar open, because no snow had fallen yet so the ski lifts at Sun Valley hadn’t been started up and no skiers were in town.\n\nThe idea that the U.S. Government might harass a world-famous Nobel Prize winning writer, might even monitor his bank accounts, was made to seem ludicrous, even crazy. Mary and Hotchner and other friends didn’t seem to notice, or would not admit, that the growing tension between the United States and Cuba made Hemingway’s fears realistic.\n\nAmong Hemingway’s supposedly delusional worries was whether enough money had been set aside for his taxes, a fear that Mary thought unreasonable. But it wasn’t. His lawyer-accountant, Alfred Rice, had just the previous year “grossly miscalculated” Hemingway’s estimated taxes, resulting in “Ernest receiving a hefty fine and having to borrow to meet the extra money owed.”\n\nHemingway wanted all his financial dealings to be completely legal, above-board, with all taxes paid; otherwise he could be prosecuted over a technicality. Mary and others repeatedly ridiculed such concerns, both to Hemingway and after his death. In 1960, for instance, Mary inexplicably refused to set his mind at ease by showing him check stubs proving that they had paid the Social Security tax for their housecleaner.\n\nHemingway also continued to worry about repercussions from an immigration problem with his friend and secretary, Valerie Danby-Smith, an Irish national. When the Hemingways and Valerie went from Cuba to Key West in July 1960, at a time of high tension between the two countries (and after the threat relayed by Ambassador Bonsal), an immigration officer noticed that Valerie’s visitor’s visa hadn’t been renewed. He let her into the U.S. but told her to renew the visa. This, writes Mary, sent Ernest into a “disproportionately large tizzy.” But such minor violations of law do provide excuses for prosecution of political enemies.\n\nMary tried to convince him to see a psychiatrist, but he wouldn’t; he was “fixated” about the FBI. This so-called fixation was the primary “evidence” that he was losing his mind.\n\nIn November of 1960, Mary and Hotchner concocted a plan to trick Hemingway into a mental hospital. Hotchner offered to “take over” the situation and go to New York to consult a “very fine psychiatrist” he knew. But before that, he met with George Saviers, Hemingway’s friend and physician in Ketchum, to figure out how they could get Hemingway’s cooperation. Hotchner suggested Dr. Saviers pretend to find Hemingway’s blood pressure significantly raised, enough that he would have to go to a facility recommended by the New York doctor.\n\nHotchner then visited the New York psychiatrist, Dr. James Cottell, who “acted quickly.” Based solely on Hotchner’s descriptions, Dr. Cottell came up with a diagnosis of Hemingway − whom he’d never met − and suggested the Mayo Clinic since it had both physical and psychiatric facilities “so that Ernest could be admitted for some physical ailment, thereby masking his true malady.” Dr. Cottell made all the arrangements and had conversations with the Mayo doctors ahead of time.\n\nMeanwhile, in Ketchum, “Ernest…reacted to the increased-blood-pressure readings with the alarm we had anticipated, and [Saviers] said he thought he might be able to get Ernest to go to Mayo on the basis of blood pressure tests and special treatment.”\n\nHemingway did, in fact, think he was going to the Mayo for treatment of his many physical problems.\n\nInstead, he was committed.\n\nDr. Howard Rome was the doctor in charge of Hemingway’s psychiatric evaluation. He found “no appreciable decline in…his delusions of persecution and poverty,” and ordered a series of electric shock treatments. Hemingway was shocked between eleven and fifteen times in December 1960 and early January 1961.\n\nThe ECT was administered despite the fact that Hemingway had had at least eight concussions in his life and had suffered serious brain trauma in the Kenyan plane crash. Also, high voltage was used, adding to the possibility of brain damage even without Hemingway’s concussion history.\n\nHemingway was not allowed to make or receive phone calls. He was frisked routinely. His room had double-locked doors and heavily barred windows. A light burned all night long.\n\nWhen Hotchner visited, Hemingway told him that he believed his room at the hospital was bugged. “He suspected that one of the interns was a Fed in disguise.” Hotchner says he thought this was another delusion.\n\nFBI documents released decades later established that Dr. Rome was reporting on Hemingway’s condition to the FBI’s Minnesota office.\n\nThe Mayo doctors also discontinued the anti-hypertension drug that had been keeping Hemingway’s blood pressure under control, because they thought the drug was causing depression, as evidenced by Hemingway “suffering delusions and feelings of persecution.”\n\nHemingway was discharged from the Mayo Clinic January 22, 1961. He returned to Idaho in a greatly deteriorated physical condition. He had lost nearly 40 pounds during those two months at the clinic and was emaciated.\n\nBut worst of all: he could no longer write. The electric shock “therapy” had destroyed his memory and with it his creative ability.\n\nAs he told Hotchner, in a famous quote, “It was a brilliant cure but we lost the patient.”\n\nHemingway was not the only prominent American during that period to be given electric shock. It was also done to Sylvia Plath, William Faulkner, Vivien Leigh, Judy Garland, and Frances Farmer, an actress and social activist who may also have been lobotomized. In September 1961, two months after Hemingway’s death, Paul Robeson was institutionalized in a London clinic where he received 54 electric shock treatments. He never recovered.\n\nHemingway continued to assert that he was being spied on and conspired against. His mistrust of the people around him had increased. These attitudes were, his “friends” claimed, indications of his continuing mental degeneration.\n\nOddly, they don’t seem to regard their having tricked him into being committed to a mental institution as a reason for mistrust.\n\nHis concerns were real, but Mary disparaged all of them. Hotchner thought his worries proved he was losing his mind. Saviers was convinced of that. All three lied to Hemingway often. Hotchner even kept Hemingway’s friend Gary Cooper away and didn’t tell Cooper what was being done to Hemingway at the Mayo. Valerie was in New York, absorbed in a new job. There was no one Hemingway could trust who was also politically savvy. Hemingway was isolated, and that made him vulnerable.\n\nIn February he was asked to write a short tribute to President Kennedy. He stood at his desk every day for hours. The words would not come. It took him a week to write a few simple sentences.\n\nHe was devastated − yet not completely broken. He continued to send money to the Cuban staff at La Finca, and routed it through Canadian banks. He worked on the Paris memoir, and wrote that, “this book contains material from the remises of my memory and of my heart. Even if the one has been tampered with and the other does not exist.”\n\nAnd he still didn’t denounce Cuba.\n\nOn April 15, 1961, the Bay of Pigs invasion occurred. It was a military and political disaster for the United States.\n\nThe FBI then informed Hemingway that he would not be allowed to return to Cuba. “This was devastating as it meant that he could not go back to his farm, his boat, his library of 9,000 books, his paintings, his unfinished manuscripts, and his family of dogs and fifty-seven cats…”\n\nOn April 21 Mary woke to find him in the kitchen with a gun. She talked to him for almost an hour until Dr. Saviers arrived and disarmed Hemingway, then took him to a local hospital where he was sedated.\n\nSaviers and two other friends flew Hemingway, against his will, back to the Mayo Clinic. On the way, he made two more suicide attempts.\n\nBefore entering the Mayo, Hemingway had not been seen by a psychiatrist. Nor had he ever attempted suicide until after receiving electric shock.\n\nOver the next two months he was given another ten electric shock treatments.\n\nDuring that period he was not allowed to make or receive phone calls or to have visitors, “not even his wife Mary.” When he did speak with Mary, Hemingway accused her of responsibility for, or collusion in, the shock treatments. She took this (or claimed she took it) as further indication of Hemingway’s mental illness.\n\nBut she realized that the ECT wasn’t helping, and wanted to get him into the Institute of Living in Hartford, CT, a facility set up for long term recovery in a less prison-like sanitarium. She asked Dr. Rome to recommend this, but he did not. Instead, he set up a “conjugal visit” that went horribly. Mary assumed the visit would be in her hotel room, but Dr. Rome refused; they had to meet “in the locked, barred wing of the hospital…other inmates pushed through the door…Ernest seemed to accept them as part of his incarceration, but they unnerved me. Our ‘solitude’ was not entirely satisfactory to either of us…”\n\nDr. Rome wrote that Hemingway “frequently” discussed suicide with him, promising not that he wouldn’t commit suicide, only that he would not do it at the Mayo.\n\nHemingway was released in June and returned to Idaho. He no longer harbored any hope of ever being able to write again.\n\nThe second night back, while at a local restaurant with Mary and a friend, Hemingway saw two men in “city clothes” and remarked that they might be FBI agents.\n\nThe next morning he was dead from a double-barrel shotgun blast.\n\n* * * *\n\nAlmost inconceivably, considering Hemingway’s stature, no inquest was held. The gun he’d been shot with was destroyed within two weeks.\n\nAccording to that memo, Hemingway was worried that his having registered under the name of his friend Dr. George Saviers would cause problems for Saviers with the FBI, and the FBI told the Mayo to reassure Hemingway that this wasn’t a problem. In one fell swoop, the FBI comes up with a benign explanation for its contact with the Mayo, and limits the contact to one occasion. Pardon my skepticism.\n\nThere is also a letter to J. Edgar Hoover a few years after Hemingway’s death written by a friend at Mary Hemingway’s behest, explaining that she’d had nothing to do with the commemorative stamp issued by Cuba. The stamp was included, along with Mary’s request that it be returned to her. At the bottom of the letter, in Hoover’s handwriting, is a note:\n\n“Return it. See that appropriate notation is made in our files. Knowing Hemingway as I did I doubt he had any communist leanings. He was a rough, tough guy & always for the underdog.”\n\nA cynical reader may notice the complete change of Hoover’s tone now that Hemingway was dead.\n\nThe only document pertaining to the Cuban Revolution is the J. L. Topping report of November 6, 1959 referred to earlier. The subject of Topping’s memo is “Ernest Hemingway Gives Views on Cuban Situation.” It describes Hemingway’s statements at the Havana airport with special concern over his kissing the Cuban flag and using the word “our” regarding Cuba’s difficulties. The document ends mid-sentence shortly after the “Begin Official Use Only” section begins. There is no indication of how many pages follow.\n\nNo more documents have been released. At least 15 pages (according to the FBI) remain classified.\n\nMary inherited everything, including the copyrights. She became a wealthy woman, managing Hemingway’s estate “with shrewdness and tenacity.” After Hemingway’s funeral the Cubans contacted her and asked for her consent to turn La Finca into a monument to Hemingway. She agreed, contingent on her being allowed to retrieve papers and personal belongings. The Cubans agreed.\n\nEven in the country’s most dire economic times, there has always been a full-time caretaker assigned to La Finca.\n\nA Moveable Feast was published posthumously, edited by Mary and titled by Hotchner. Three days before his death, Hemingway drafted (but did not mail) a letter to his publisher saying that the memoir could not be published in its current condition because it was unfair to Hadley (his first wife), Pauline (his second wife) and F. Scott Fitzgerald. But Mary ignored those concerns.\n\nAlthough A Moveable Feast gives a wonderfully descriptive portrait of his and Hadley’s life in Paris in the 1920s, and although it contains much generosity toward others (such as Sylvia Beach), there are some startlingly private anecdotes and cruel portrayals in the book that have been used ever since to show Hemingway’s supposed viciousness toward his friends F. Scott Fitzgerald and Gertrude Stein, among others.\n\nHowever, the book is beautifully written and Jeffrey Meyers believes this indicated that Hemingway had “regained the full force of his literary power only months before he entered the Mayo Clinic.” Except for The Old Man and the Sea, Hemingway’s work since 1940 had not equaled his earlier brilliance. If he was writing in 1960 as powerfully as he had in For Whom the Bell Tolls, and with the rage and sense of justice that had motivated him to write “Who Murdered the Vets?”, then those U. S. officials intending to overthrow the Cuban government had a big problem.\n\nHotchner, who said his partnership with Hemingway had been “lucrative,” published his memoir Papa Hemingway in 1966. He was also a neighbor and friend of Paul Newman, with whom he formed Newman’s Own, the non-profit food company, in 1982.\n\nHemingway’s suspicions of his lawyer-accountant, Alfred Rice, were not evidence of paranoia; Rice was stealing from Hemingway. After Mary’s death in 1986, Hemingway’s sons learned that Rice had secret Swiss bank accounts and had been taking a 30% commission instead of the usual 10%. “The sons sued Rice, who escaped being jailed for fraud and embezzlement by dying in April 1989.”\n\nMartha Gellhorn had what amounted to a second career as the supposed victim of Hemingway’s fame, complaining often that her writings had been unfairly overshadowed by his and that people only knew her as Hemingway’s wife even decades later. But one Hemingway expert believes that the very reason Martha married Hemingway was to advance her journalism career. Jeffrey Meyers writes that in the 40 years after Hemingway’s death, “while ostensibly refusing to discuss Hemingway, she [Gellhorn] constructed a careful, sanitized view of her own behavior, which stressed her independent achievement as a writer and journalist.”\n\nMany writers have continued to sanitize Gellhorn. For instance, a recent biography omits the fact that she had to leave Africa after living there over a decade when she ran over and killed a child in Kenya.\n\nIn 1964 Martha began the “best and longest relationship of her life.” It was with Laurance Rockefeller.\n\nIn 1964, Dr. Howard Rome provided the Warren Commission with a “psychological autopsy” of Lee Harvey Oswald.\n\nIn 2011, Hotchner wrote an editorial in the New York Times, admitting he’d been wrong not to believe Hemingway’s fears of being monitored by the FBI.\n\nIn 2015 Hotchner wrote another memoir about Hemingway. The book opens and closes with Hotchner’s visit to Hemingway at the Mayo in June 1961. During the visit Hotchner advised Hemingway to “get over this craziness” of believing he was being monitored by the FBI. “Why would the FBI….,” he asked, not finishing the sentence. Hemingway replied:\n\n“I write suspicious books that take place in foreign countries: France and Italy, Communist Cuba and fascist Spain. I lived among the Cuban Communists all those years. I shoot guns. I speak languages J. Edgar Hoover doesn’t understand. My lawyer, my doctor, my banker, all of them in cahoots with him.”\n\nCoda\n\nHemingway, the greatest American writer of the 20th century, was popular world wide. He was a stalwart anti-fascist all his life. He refused to become an anti-communist despite continued pressure to do so. His strength of character, uncompromising integrity, and great courage made him a huge obstacle to the efforts of the U.S. government to turn the American people against Cuba.\n\nThe U.S. had already used means both aboveboard (such as the embargoes) and clandestine (attempted assassinations of Castro, the Bay of Pigs invasion, training of mercenaries by the CIA, and manipulation of the media, to name a few) to try to oust the Cuban government. It intended on employing such means in the future. It could not afford to have one of America’s best known writers living in Cuba and thus be able to expose lies and, worse, to object to attacks. It certainly could not afford to have Hemingway write a book supportive of the Cuban Revolution.\n\nFrom that perspective, Hemingway was extremely dangerous."
