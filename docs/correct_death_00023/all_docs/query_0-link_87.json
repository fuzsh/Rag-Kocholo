        "text": "After his death from a self-inflicted shotgun blast to the head, Ernest Hemingway was laid to rest at Ketchum Cemetery.\n\nAt the time of the funeral, the death was reported as \"accidental.\" Hemingway had received several treatments of electroshock therapy at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN prior to his suicide.\n\nOne of the theories of Hemingway's physical and mental deterioration is the genetic disease hemochromatosis, an afflication that inhibits the metabolization of iron. This disease was diagnosed in Hemingway in 1961 and compounded by heavy drinking. Hemingway's brother, Leicester, and sister, Ursula, also committed suicide."
