        "text": "\"Auto-racing, bull-fighting and mountain-climbing are the only real sports. All others are just games.\"\n\nThat quote attributed to the great American author Ernest Hemingway is one I have used often to understand the need for risk-taking. Hemingway's point, I think, is that when you lay your life and health on the line, an experience becomes more meaningful. Land in a sand trap on a golf course, you add a few strokes to your game. Double-fault in tennis, and you lose a point. But if you screw up on a mountain or in a race-car or bull-ring, the consequences can be dire.\n\nAs a long-time adventure writer with a need for adrenaline, I am attracted to Hemingway’s sports. I have climbed my share of mountains, including the Matterhorn, driven Indy cars above 200 mph and yes, gotten into the ring with bulls, breaking a few ribs in the process.\n\nSo on a recent trip to Sun Valley, ID, a new place for me, I made the pilgrimage to the Nobel Laureate writer's grave. It is located without fanfare in a cemetery in Ketchum. Coincidentally, I was in Idaho to take a car above 200 mph in the Sun Valley Road Rally, a charity event.\n\nAs we approached the graveyard, I grew apprehensive. After all, I was about to visit the hallowed ground where the man who wrote my favorite short stories was buried. In addition to his world view, I also had gravitated early in life to his style, even trying to employ some of it in my own writing.\n\nHemingway's barren technique, called the iceberg theory, is one of showing only 20% of your cards in words, leaving the remaining 80% to a reader’s imagination. That’s like writing a 1,000-word story, but communicating 5,000 words of information. (Hemingway was even credited once with writing a story of just six words - \"For sale, baby’s shoes, never used\" - though later this was determined likely to be a hoax.)\n\nWhen we arrived at the grave itself, what I saw was not what I was prepared for. Haphazardly scattered on the stone were dirty pennies, a can of Pabst Blue Ribbon beer, an unwashed empty wine glass and some disintegrating flowers in a wine bottle, among other things. I don’t know what I had expected, but it wasn’t that.\n\nAfter taking some photos and saying a quick prayer, I turned and headed back to the car. Why had he killed himself on July 2, 1961? What had caused him at just 61 years of age to put a shotgun to his head and pull the trigger?\n\nI guess that will always remain a mystery to those of us who are Hemingway fans. We do know he was beginning to suffer from dementia after a swashbuckling life of drinking, war injuries and two plane crashes.\n\nIn the car back to my hotel, I thought about my favorite Hemingway short story, A Clean Well-Lighted Place*, where an old man leaves a café late at night. Perhaps there were some clues there. Perhaps when his own clean, well-lighted place deserted him, that was enough. But really, we will never know:\n\n“…Turning off the electric light, he continued the conversation with himself. It is the light of course, but it is necessary that the place be clean and pleasant. You do not want music. Certainly you do not want music. Nor can you stand before a bar with dignity although that is all that is provided at these hours. What did he fear? It was not fear or dread. It was nothing he knew too well. It was all a nothing and a man was a nothing too. It was only that and a light was all that was needed, and a certain cleanness and order...He disliked bars and bodegas. A clean, well-lighted café was a very different thing. Now, without thinking further, he would go home to his room. He would lie in bed and finally, with daylight, he would go to sleep. After all, he said to himself, it is probably only insomnia. Many must have it.”\n\nRest in peace, Papa.\n\n*A Clean, Well-Lighted Place, Ernest Hemingway, copyright 1933. Renewed copyright 1961, Mary Hemingway."
