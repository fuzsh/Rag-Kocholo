        "text": "Along with being a Pulitzer and Nobel Prize-winning author, Ernest Miller Hemingway was also an avid outdoor enthusiast. In fact, Hemingway spent a substantial amount of time enjoying Idaho’s natural beauty. He purchased a home in Ketchum in 1959 and lived there for a few years before sadly ending his own life in 1961. Since Hemingway lived and died in the Gem State, it’s only right that his final resting place is also here. You can find Hemingway’s Grave in the Ketchum Cemetery, but there’s a myriad of ways the writer has been immortalized around the small mountain town that he grew to love so much.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDid you know about Hemingway’s grave in Ketchum? It’s unfortunate the beloved writer couldn’t spend more time in the beautiful Gem State. Learn more about Ketchum and why it’s considered one of “the coolest towns in America” here.\n\nWant more Idaho in your inbox?\n\nGet the latest on things to see, do, and eat around Idaho!\n\nspinner\n\nThank you!
