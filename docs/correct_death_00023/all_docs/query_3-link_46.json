        "text": "There were five confirmed suicides in the family of the famous writer and Nobel Prize winner Ernest Hemingway.\n\nSuicide is a dark legacy of the Hemingway family. Including Ernest, five members of the family went from their own hands. Some speculated that number is treated and claim that at least seven members of the Hemingway family killed themselves. Genetics is a possible hypothesis that could explain why so many Hamingways took their own lives.\n\nHemingway’s Father Killed Himself\n\nHeingway’s father Clarence Edmonds killed himself in 1928 when he was 57 years old. Like his son, Clarence fatally shot himself. However, instead of a shotgun, he used a pistol. Clarence suffered from diabetes and depression which was probably the trigger for his decision. Three of Clarence Hemingway’s six children took their own lives\n\nHemingway’s Brother Committed Suicide\n\nLeicester Hemingway was the younger brother of the famous writer. He had depression and diabetes. Incapable to cope with weight loss, Leicester took his own life in 1982. Gun was his tool of choice and he shot himself in the head.\n\nThe Author’s Sister Ursula Also Killed Herself\n\nUrsula struggled with cancer and depression. She chose to leave this world through a drug overdose in 1966.\n\nHemingway’s Granddaughter Took Her Own Life\n\nMargot “Margaux” Hemingway was Earnest Hemingway’s granddaughter. She was an American fashion model and actress. On July 1, 1996, almost 35 years after her grandfather’s suicide, Margaux took her own life through drugs by purposely overdosing. It happened in Santa Monica, California.\n\nEarnest Hemingway"
