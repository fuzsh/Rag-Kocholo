        "text": "Situated on 12 acres near the Silver Creek valley, this home was purchased by the Hemingways in 1959 after they were forced to leave Cuba abruptly. In 1961, Ernest Hemingway committed suicide in this residence with a shotgun.\n\nIn 1989, the home was bequeathed by Mary Hemingway to the Nature Conservancy with the request that the home and site be maintained as a wilderness preserve. However, this home is something of an anomaly for TNC, whose typical mission is not of historical preservation but of preservation of landscapes and ecosystems.\n\nA board of directors at the Idaho Hemingway House Foundation maintains the location, and they are trying to make the home accessible as a writer's retreat or as a museum. However, residences of the surrounding affluent neighborhood are resistant to the traffic that either of those plans would bring. As of now, the home is vacant and as it was acquired in 1986."
