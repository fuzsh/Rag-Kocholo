        "text": "Inside Idaho\n\nThe stories of Idaho’s history, places, and oddities\n\nErnest Hemingway is arguably one of the most successful and well-known authors of all time – next to William Shakespeare, Jane Austen and Charles Dickens – to name a few.\n\nAnd as this edition of Inside Idaho is being written in the Wood River Valley, there is no questions as to why he chose to spend the last years of his life writing in his home next to the serene Big Wood River.\n\nHemingway first came to Idaho in 1939 when he was asked to promote the new Sun Valley Resort. He then came back to Idaho for years after that to hunt and fish.\n\nThen in 1959, Hemingway and his wife Mary, bought a home on the Big Wood River where he lived the last years of his life – and eventually died in 1961.\n\nAccording to the Ernest Hemingway Collection website, Hemingway wrote portions of several novels in Ketchum including For Whom the Bell Tolls, Islands in the Stream, The Garden of Eden and A Moveable Feast.\n\n“I think it’s really significant that Idaho was a creative space for him,” Community Library executive director Jenny Emery Davidson said in an article by Idaho Public Television. “Because he continues to be such an iconic figure, he provides an invitation for us to think about how Idaho can be a creative space … for lots of different people.”\n\nToday, Hemingway’s home and the 13 acres of land that its on is listed National Register of Historic Places for “its association with the great writer and because it is an exquisite example of mid-century architecture,” according to a Community Library article.\n\nThere is also a statue at the Hemingway Memorial which is about one and a half miles from the Sun Valley Lodge. “Best of all he loved the fall. The leaves yellow on the cottonwoods. Leaves floating on the trout streams. And above the hills the high blue windless skies… now he will be a part of them forever,” the memorial reads."
