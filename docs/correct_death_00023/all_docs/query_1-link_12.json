        "text": "The Hemingway Legacy Initiative comprises a portfolio of projects centered on providing educational and cultural opportunities in this remote mountain area. According to Jenny Emery Davidson, the library’s executive director, the initiative aims to “leverage the legacy of Hemingway to deepen a sense of place for local residents and also to engage a much broader populace. Hemingway is so integral to the history of this place, and he developed an abiding affection for the American West, and yet his time here is under-represented and little understood.”\n\nIn addition to preserving Hemingway’s Idaho home, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the library is providing summer internships for undergraduate and graduate students. These students, who are interested in both archives and public history, are inventorying the possessions that have remained in Hemingway’s Ketchum home since his wife, Mary Welsh Hemingway, died in 1986. These items will be preserved by the library, made accessible to researchers, and displayed in exhibitions. Among Hemingway’s books students have found a limited edition of Archibald MacLeish’s poetry, inscribed with a poem to Hemingway. They have also inventoried clothing, including haute couture belonging to Mary in the 1950s and 60s. In summer 2018, the students worked with Wyoming Humanities to begin development of an audio walking tour that showcases Ketchum and Sun Valley with a focus on Hemingway’s history there.\n\nThe library has built a state-of-the-art archive, the only one of its kind in Central Idaho, that will hold Hemingway’s possessions and other historic artifacts and to which community members can contribute—it already has photographs, oral histories, and ephemera documenting Hemingway’s time in Sun Valley. In addition, the Ketchum Community Library is launching a new literary residency program that will encourage ongoing artistic production in the place Hemingway loved.\n\nWith the support of the NEH, the library is inviting locals to reflect on their community’s heritage, while encouraging visitors to appreciate Hemingway’s legacy. And by bringing writers, scholars, and students to Ketchum, the library is bringing qualities of college town life to a rural area without higher education institutions, providing locals with new possibilities for literary and scholarly interactions."
