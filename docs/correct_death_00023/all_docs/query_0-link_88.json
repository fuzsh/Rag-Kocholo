Inside it is as it was when the novelist lived there. Animal skins with glassy eyes dot the floor and drape the furniture. Above a massive stone fireplace hang the mounted heads of an \"almost record\" impala shot by Ernest and a kudu shot by Mary Hemingway\n\twhen they were in Africa in the early 1950's.\n\t\n\tTall bookshelves on either side of the fireplace contain the latest editions of Hemingway's books, and in one corner an oil painting has the author, white bearded and unsmiling.\n\tlooking across the Idaho's Sawtooth Mountains are visible through a broad picture window.\n\t\n\tMary Hemingway spends the summer and autum in the house each year, and by the reports of Ketchum citizens, she is something of a recluse when in residence. Mrs. Hemingway laughs\n\twhen she hears this. If it is true, she says, it's because if she weren't more careful, interest and\n\tcuriosity about Ernest would prevent her from getting her own writing done. Hemingway became a celebrity with the publication of his first novel in 1926 and interest in him has never cooled. Even now dozens of articles and a handful of books appear each year re-evaluating the\n\tman and his work. Mrs. Hemingway feels much of what is written is unfair to her husband.\n\t\n\t Even the authorized biography, a best-seller by Hemingway scholar Carlos Baker  called \"Ernest Hemingway: A Life Story.\" she feels gives an \"incomplete, not very complimentary \"'picture. Baker got his facts mostly correct, she said, but failed to capture anything of her husband's spirit: \"How could he? They never went hunting or  drinking, or even chatted together. Mr. Baker is a very great scholar, but no one can describe a person he has never met.  \n\t\n\t\"One thing about Ernest that only his close friends were aware of was his humor. He had a marvelous, gay delightful sense of wit. That humor was a very big part of his personality.\n\tIt was a continuous game of give and take with friends. In Cuba, Paris. Africa, here, it was\n\tlike a volleyball game. Anyone who was around could take part.\" But Hemingway's humor,\n\t\"droll and wry. juicy and crazy-mitty.\" is missing  for the most part'from the tomes of biography written about him. M r s .

She chewed gum. smoked and gazed out over the valley as she recalled her life with Hemingway with obvious pleasure and generous elaberation.\n\t\n\tHemingway met Mary in 1944 in London where she was a reporter for Time magazine.
