        "text": "Ernest Miller Hemingway (July 21, 1899 - July 2, 1961) was an American author and journalist. Many of his works of fiction are considered classics of American literature.\n\nLife[]\n\nOverview[]\n\nHemingway was born and raised in Oak Park, Illinois. After leaving high school he worked for a few months as a reporter for the Kansas City Star, before leaving for the Italian front to become an ambulance driver during World War I (which became the basis for his novel A Farewell to Arms). In 1918, he was seriously wounded and returned home within the year. In 1922 Hemingway married Hadley Richardson, the 1st of his 4 wives, and the couple moved to Paris, where he worked as a foreign correspondent. During his time there he met and was influenced by modernist writers and artists of the 1920s expatriate community known as the \"Lost Generation\". His first novel, The Sun Also Rises, was published in 1926.\n\nAfter divorcing Hadley in 1927 Hemingway married Pauline Pfeiffer; they divorced following Hemingway's return from covering the Spanish Civil War, after which he wrote For Whom the Bell Tolls. Martha Gellhorn became his 3rd wife in 1940; they separated when he met Mary Welsh in London during World War II. During the war he was present at D-Day and the liberation of Paris.\n\nShortly after the publication of The Old Man and the Sea in 1952 Hemingway went on safari to Africa, where he was almost killed in a plane crash that left him in pain or ill-health for much of the rest of his life. Hemingway had permanent residences in Key West, Florida, and Cuba during the 1930s and 1940s, but in 1959 he moved from Cuba to Ketchum, Idaho, where he committed suicide in the summer of 1961.\n\nHe published 7 novels, 6 short story collections, and 2 non-fiction works during his lifetime; a further 3 novels, 4 collections of short stories, and 3 non-fiction works were published posthumously. His distinctive writing style, characterized by economy and understatement, influenced 20th-century fiction, as did his life of adventure and his public image. He produced most of his work between the mid-1920s and the mid-1950s.\n\nHe is the author of \"The Soul of Spain with McAlmon and Bird the Publishers,\" one of the worst poems ever written. Despite that, he won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1954.\n\nYouth and education[]\n\nHemingway was born on July 21, 1899, in Oak Park, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago.[1] His father Clarence Edmonds Hemingway was a physician, and his mother, Grace Hall-Hemingway, was a musician. Both were well educated and well respected in the conservative community of Oak Park.[2] Frank Lloyd Wright, a resident of Oak Park, said of the village: \"So many churches for so many good people to go to\".[3]\n\nWhen Clarence and Grace Hemingway married in 1896, they moved in with Grace's father, Ernest Hall,[4] after whom they named their son.[5] Hemingway claimed to dislike his name, which he \"associated with the naive, even foolish hero of Oscar Wilde's play The Importance of Being Earnest\".[6] The family's 7-bedroom home in a respectable neighborhood contained a music studio for Grace and a medical office for Clarence.[7]\n\nHemingway's mother frequently performed in concerts around the village. As an adult Hemingway professed to hate his mother, although biographer Michael Reynolds points out that Hemingway mirrored her energy and enthusiasm.[8] Her insistence that he learn to play the cello became a \"source of conflict\", but he later admitted the music lessons were useful in his writing, as in the \"contrapuntal structure\" of For Whom the Bell Tolls.[9] The family owned a summer home called Windemere on Walloon Lake, near Petoskey, Michigan, where Hemingway learned to hunt, fish and camp in the woods and lakes of northern Michigan. His early experiences in nature instilled a passion for outdoor adventure, and living in remote or isolated areas.[10]\n\nFrom 1913 to 1917 Hemingway attended Oak Park and River Forest High School, where he took part in a number of sports — boxing, track and field, water polo, and football — had good grades in English classes,[11] and performed with his sister Marcelline in the school orchestra for 2 years.[8] In his junior year, he took a journalism class, taught by Fannie Biggs, which was structured \"as though the classroom were a newspaper office\". The better writers in class submitted pieces to The Trapeze, the school newspaper. Hemingway and his sister Marcelline both had pieces submitted to The Trapeze; Hemingway's first piece, published in January 1916, was about a local performance by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.[12]\n\nHe continued to contribute to and to edit the Trapeze and the Tabula (the school's newspaper and yearbook), for which he imitated the language of sportswriters, and used the pen name Ring Lardner, Jr. — a nod to Ring Lardner of the Chicago Tribune whose byline was \"Line O'Type\".[13] Like Mark Twain, Stephen Crane, Theodore Dreiser and Sinclair Lewis, Hemingway was a journalist before becoming a novelist; after leaving high school he went to work for the Kansas City Star as a cub reporter.[14] Although he stayed there for only 6 months he relied on the Star's style guide as a foundation for his writing: \"Use short sentences. Use short first paragraphs. Use vigorous English. Be positive, not negative.\"[15]\n\nWorld War I[]\n\nEarly in 1918 Hemingway responded to a Red Cross recruitment effort and signed on to be an ambulance driver in Italy.[16] He left New York in May, and arrived in Paris as the city was under bombardment from German artillery.[17] By June he was stationed at the Italian Front, and on his 1st day in Milan was sent to the scene of a munitions factory explosion where rescuers retrieved the shredded remains of female workers. He described the incident in his non-fiction book Death in the Afternoon: \"I remember that after we searched quite thoroughly for the complete dead we collected fragments\".[18]\n\nA few days later he was stationed at Fossalta di Piave. On July 8 he was seriously wounded by mortar fire, having just returned from the canteen to deliver chocolate and cigarettes to the men at the front line.[19] Despite his wounds, Hemingway carried an Italian soldier to safety, for which he received the Italian Silver Medal of Bravery.[20] Still only 18, Hemingway said of the incident: \"When you go to war as a boy you have a great illusion of immortality. Other people get killed; not you ... Then when you are badly wounded the first time you lose that illusion and you know it can happen to you.\"[21] He sustained shrapnel wounds to both legs; underwent an operation at a distribution center; spent 5 days at a field hospital; and was transferred to the Red Cross hospital in Milan for recuperation.[22]\n\nHemingway spent 6 months in the hospital, where he met and fell in love with Agnes von Kurowsky, a Red Cross nurse 7 years his senior.[23] Agnes and Hemingway planned to marry, but she became engaged to an Italian officer in March 1919, an incident that provided material for the short and bitter work \"A Very Short Story\".[24] Biographer Jeffrey Meyers claims Hemingway was devastated by Agnes' rejection, and that he followed a pattern of abandoning a wife before she abandoned him in future relationships. During his 6 months in recuperation Hemingway met and formed a strong friendship with \"Chink\" Dorman-Smith that lasted for decades.[25]\n\nToronto and Chicago[]\n\nHemingway returned home early in 1919 to a time of readjustment. At not yet 20 years old, the war had created in him a maturity at odds with living at home without a job and the need for recuperation.[26] As Reynolds explains, \"Hemingway could not really tell his parents what he thought when he saw his bloody knee. He could not say how scared he was in another country with surgeons who could not tell him in English if his leg was coming off or not.\"[27] That summer he spent time in Michigan with high school friends, fishing and camping;[21] and in September he spent a week in the back-country. The trip became the inspiration for his short story \"Big Two-Hearted River\", in which the semi-autobiographical character Nick Adams takes to the country to find solitude after returning from war.[28] A family friend offered him a job in Toronto; having nothing else to do he accepted. Late that year he began as a freelancer, staff writer and foreign correspondent for the Toronto Star Weekly.[29] However he returned to Michigan the following June,[29] and then moved to Chicago in September 1920 to live with friends, while still filing stories for the Toronto Star.\n\nIn Chicago he worked as an associate editor of the monthly journal Cooperative Commonwealth, where he met Sherwood Anderson.[30] When St. Louis native Hadley Richardson came to Chicago to visit Hemingway's roommate's sister, Hemingway, who was infatuated, later claimed \"I knew she was the girl I was going to marry\". Hadley was red-haired, with a \"nurturing instinct\", and 8 years older than Hemingway.[31] Despite the difference in age, Hadley, who had an overprotective mother, seemed less mature than usual for a young woman her age.[32] Bernice Kert, author of The Hemingway Women, claims Hadley was \"evocative\" of Agnes, but that Hadley had a childishness that Agnes lacked.\n\nHemingway and Richardson corresponded for a few months, and then decided to marry and travel to Europe.[31] They wanted to visit Rome, but Sherwood Anderson convinced them to visit Paris instead.[33] They were married on September 3, 1921; 2 months later Hemingway was hired as foreign correspondent for the Toronto Star; and the couple left for Paris. Of Hemingway's marriage to Hadley, Meyers claims: \"With Hadley, Hemingway achieved everything he had hoped for with Agnes: the love of a beautiful woman, a comfortable income, a life in Europe.\"[34]\n\nParis[]\n\nEarly Hemingway biographer Carlos Baker believes that, while Anderson suggested Paris because \"the monetary exchange rate\" made it an inexpensive place to live, more importantly it was where \"the most interesting people in the world\" resided. There Hemingway would meet writers such as Gertrude Stein, James Joyce and Ezra Pound who \"could help a young writer up the rungs of a career\".[33]\n\nThe Hemingway of the early Paris years was a \"tall, handsome, muscular, broad-shouldered, brown-eyed, rosy-cheeked, square-jawed, soft-voiced young man.\"[35] He and Hadley lived in a small walk-up at 74 Rue du Cardinal Lemoine in the Latin Quarter, and he worked in a rented room in a nearby building.[33] Anderson wrote letters of introduction to Gertrude Stein and other writers in Paris.[36] Stein, who was the bastion of modernism in Paris,[37] became Hemingway's mentor for a period, introducing him to the expatriate artists and writers of the Montparnasse Quarter. She referred to artists as the \"Lost Generation\"—a term Hemingway popularized with the publication of The Sun Also Rises.[38] A regular at Stein's salon, Hemingway met influential painters such as Pablo Picasso, Joan Miró, and Juan Gris.[39] However, Hemingway eventually withdrew from Stein's influence and their relationship deteriorated into a literary quarrel that spanned decades.[40]\n\nAmerican poet Ezra Pound, older than Hemingway by 14 years, met Hemingway by chance at Sylvia Beach's Shakespeare & Company in 1922. The 2 toured Italy in 1923 and lived on the same street in 1924.[35] They forged a strong friendship and in Hemingway, Pound recognized and fostered a young talent.[39] Pound — who had recently finished editing T. S. Eliot's The Waste Land — introduced Hemingway to the Irish writer James Joyce,[35] with whom Hemingway frequently embarked on \"alcoholic sprees\".[41]\n\nDuring his first 20 months in Paris, Hemingway filed 88 stories for the Toronto Star.[42] He covered the Greco-Turkish War, where he witnessed the burning of Smyrna; wrote travel pieces such as \"Tuna Fishing in Spain\" and \"Trout Fishing All Across Europe: Spain Has the Best, Then Germany\"; and an article dedicated to bullfighting — \"Pamplona in July; World's Series of Bull Fighting a Mad, Whirling Carnival\".[43] Hemingway was devastated on learning that Hadley had lost a suitcase filled with his manuscripts at the Gare de Lyon as she was traveling to Geneva to meet him in December 1922.[44] The following September, because Hadley was pregnant, the couple returned to Toronto, where their son John Hadley Nicanor was born on October 10, 1923.\n\nDuring their absence Hemingway's debut collection, Three Stories and Ten Poems, was published. 2 of the stories it contained were all that remained of his work after the loss of the suitcase, and the 3rd had been written the previous spring in Italy. Within months a 2nd volume, in our time (without capitals), was published. The small volume included 6 vignettes and 12 stories Hemingway had written the previous summer during his earliest visit to Spain where he discovered the thrill of the corrida. He missed Paris, considered Toronto boring, and wanted to return to the life of a writer, rather than live the life of a journalist.[45]\n\nHemingway, Hadley, and their son (nicknamed Bumby), returned to Paris in January 1924 and moved into a new apartment on the Rue Notre Dame des Champs.[45] Hemingway helped Ford Madox Ford edit the transatlantic review in which were published works by Pound, John Dos Passos, and Gertrude Stein as well as some of Hemingway's own early stories such as \"Indian Camp\".[46] When In Our Time (with capital letters) was published in 1925, the dust jacket had comments from Ford.[47][48] \"Indian Camp\" received considerable praise; Ford saw it as an important early story by a young writer,[49] and critics in the United States claimed Hemingway reinvigorated the short story with his use of declarative sentences and his crisp style.[50] Six months earlier, Hemingway met F. Scott Fitzgerald, and the pair formed a friendship of \"admiration and hostility\".[51] Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby had been published that year: Hemingway read it, liked it, and decided his next work had to be a novel.[52]\n\nSince his earliest visit to see the bullfighting at the Festival of San Fermín in Pamplona in 1923, Hemingway was fascinated by the sport; he saw in it the brutality of war juxtaposed against a cruel beauty. In June 1925, Hemingway and Hadley left Paris for their annual visit to Pamplona accompanied by a group of American and British expatriates.[53]\n\nThe trip inspired Hemingway's debut novel, The Sun Also Rises, which he began to write immediately after the fiesta, finishing in September.[52] The novel presents the culture of bullfighting with the concept of afición, depicted as an authentic way of life, contrasted with the Parisian bohemians, depicted as inauthentic.[54] Hemingway decided to slow his pace and devoted six months to the novel's rewrite.[52] The manuscript arrived in New York in April,[55] and he corrected the final proof in Paris in August 1926.[56] Scribner's published the novel in October.[57] The Sun Also Rises epitomized the post-war expatriate generation,[58] received good reviews and is \"recognized as Hemingway's greatest work\".[59] However, Hemingway himself later wrote to his editor Max Perkins that the \"point of the book\" was not so much about a generation being lost, but that \"the earth abideth forever\"; he believed the characters in The Sun Also Rises may have been \"battered\" but were not lost.[60]\n\nHemingway's marriage to Hadley deteriorated as he was working on The Sun Also Rises.[56] In the spring of 1926, Hadley became aware of his affair with Pauline Pfeiffer,[61] although she endured Pauline's presence in Pamplona that July.[62] On their return to Paris, Hadley and Hemingway decided to separate; and in November she formally requested a divorce. They split their possessions while Hadley accepted Hemingway's offer of the proceeds from The Sun Also Rises.[63] The couple were divorced in January 1927, and Hemingway married Pauline Pfeiffer in May.[64]\n\nPfeiffer was from Arkansas — her family was wealthy and Catholic — and before the marriage Hemingway converted to Catholicism.[65][66] In Paris she worked for Vogue.[65] After a honeymoon in Le Grau-du-Roi, where he contracted anthrax, Hemingway planned his next collection of short stories,[67] Men Without Women, published in October 1927.[68]\n\nBy the end of the year Pauline, who was pregnant, wanted to move back to America. John Dos Passos recommended Key West, and they left Paris in March 1928. Some time that spring Hemingway suffered a severe injury in their Paris bathroom, when he pulled a skylight down on his head thinking he was pulling on a toilet chain. This left him with a prominent forehead scar, subject of numerous legends, which he carried for the rest of his life. When Hemingway was asked about the scar he was reluctant to answer.[69] After his departure from Paris, Hemingway \"never again lived in a big city\".[70]\n\nKey West and the Caribbean[]\n\nIn the late spring Hemingway and Pauline traveled to Kansas City where their son Patrick Hemingway was born on June 28, 1928. Pauline had a difficult delivery, which Hemingway fictionalized in A Farewell to Arms.[71] After Patrick's birth, Pauline and Hemingway traveled to Wyoming, Massachusetts and New York.[71] In the fall he was in New York with Bumby, about to board a train to Florida, when he received a cable telling him that his father had committed suicide.[72][73] Hemingway was devastated, having earlier sent a letter to his father telling him not to worry about financial difficulties; the letter arrived minutes after the suicide. He realized how Hadley must have felt after her own father's suicide in 1903, and he suggested, \"I'll probably go the same way.\"[74]\n\nUpon his return to Key West in December, Hemingway worked on the draft of A Farewell to Arms before leaving for France in January. The draft had been finished in August but he delayed the revision. The serialization in Scribner's Magazine was scheduled to begin in May, but by April, Hemingway was still working on the ending, which he may have rewritten as many as 17 times. A Farewell to Arms was published on September 27.[75] Biographer James Mellow believes Hemingway's stature as an American writer was secured with the publication of A Farewell to Arms, which has a complexity not apparent in The Sun Also Rises.[76]\n\nWhile in Spain during the summer of 1929, Hemingway researched his next work, Death in the Afternoon. He wanted to write a comprehensive treatise of bullfighting, with explanations of the toreros and corridas, complete with glossaries and appendices, because he believed bullfighting was \"of great tragic interest, being literally of life and death.\"[77]\n\nDuring the early 1930s Hemingway spent his winters in Key West and summers in Wyoming, where he found \"the most beautiful country he had seen in the American West\" and hunting that included deer, elk, and grizzly bear.[78] His 3rd son, Gregory Hancock Hemingway, was born on November 12, 1931 in Kansas City.[79][80] Pauline's uncle bought the couple a house in Key West with the 2nd floor of the carriage house converted to a writing den.[81] While in Key West he enticed his friends to join him on fishing expeditions—inviting Waldo Peirce, John Dos Passos, and Max Perkins[82] — with one all-male trip to the Dry Tortugas, and he frequented the local bar, Sloppy Joe's.[83] He continued to travel to Europe and to Cuba, and although he wrote of Key West in 1933, \"We have a fine house here, and kids are all well,\" Mellow believes he \"was plainly restless.\"[84]\n\nIn 1933 Hemingway and Pauline went on safari to East Africa. The 10-week trip provided material for Green Hills of Africa, as well as the short stories \"The Snows of Kilimanjaro\" and \"The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber\".[85] They visited Mombasa, Nairobi, and Machakos in Kenya, then on to Tanganyika, where they hunted in the Serengeti, around Lake Manyara and west and southeast of the present-day Tarangire National Park. Hemingway contracted amoebic dysentery that caused a prolapsed intestine, and he was evacuated by plane to Nairobi, an experience reflected in \"The Snows of Kilimanjaro\". Their guide was the noted \"white hunter\" Philip Hope Percival, who had guided Theodore Roosevelt on his 1909 safari. On his return to Key West in early 1934 Hemingway began work on Green Hills of Africa, published in 1935 to mixed reviews.[86]\n\nHemingway bought a boat in 1934, named it the Pilar, and began sailing the Caribbean.[87] In 1935 he first arrived at Bimini, where he spent a considerable amount of time.[85] During this period he also worked on To Have and Have Not, published in 1937 while he was in Spain, the only novel he wrote during the 1930's.[88]\n\nSpanish Civil War and World War II[]\n\nIt was in Christmas 1936 when Hemingway met war correspondent Martha Gellhorn at a bar in Key West, Florida.[89] In 1937 Hemingway agreed to report on the Spanish Civil War for the North American Newspaper Alliance (NANA).[90] In March he arrived in Spain with Dutch filmmaker Joris Ivens.[91] Ivens, who was filming The Spanish Earth, needed Hemingway as a screenwriter to replace John Dos Passos, who left the project when his friend José Robles was arrested and later executed.[92] The incident changed Dos Passos' opinion of the leftist republicans, which created a rift between him and Hemingway, who spread a rumor that Dos Passos was a coward for leaving Spain.[93]\n\nMartha Gellhorn went on to join him in Spain. Like Hadley, Martha was a native of St. Louis, and like Pauline, she had worked for Vogue in Paris. Of Martha, Kert explains, \"she never catered to him the way other women did.\"[94] Late in 1937, while in Madrid with Martha, Hemingway wrote his only play, The Fifth Column, as the city was being bombarded.[95] He returned to Key West for a few months, then back to Spain twice in 1938. He was present at the Battle of the Ebro, the last republican stand, and was among fellow British and American journalists who were some of the last to leave the battle as they crossed the river.[96][97]\n\nIn the spring of 1939, Hemingway crossed to Cuba in his boat to live in the Hotel Ambos Mundos in Havana. This was the separation phase of a slow and painful split from Pauline, which had begun when Hemingway met Martha.[98] Martha soon joined him in Cuba, and they almost immediately rented \"Finca Vigia\" (\"Lookout Farm\"), a Template:Convert/LoffAoffDbSonNa property Template:Convert/LoffAoffDbSoff from Havana. Pauline and the children left Hemingway that summer, after the family was re-united during a visit to Wyoming. After Hemingway's divorce from Pauline was finalized, he and Martha were married November 20, 1940, in Cheyenne, Wyoming.[99] As he had after his divorce from Hadley, he changed locations; moving his primary summer residence to Ketchum, Idaho, just outside the newly built resort of Sun Valley, and his winter residence to Cuba.[100] Hemingway, who had been disgusted when a Parisian friend allowed his cats to eat from the table, \"developed a passion for cats\" in Cuba, keeping dozens of them on the property.[101]\n\nGellhorn inspired him to write his most famous novel, For Whom the Bell Tolls, which he started in March 1939, finished in July 1940, and was published in October 1940.[89][102] Consistent with his pattern of moving around while working on a manuscript, he wrote For Whom the Bell Tolls in Cuba, Wyoming, and Sun Valley.[98] For Whom the Bell Tolls became a book-of-the-month choice, sold half a million copies within months, was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize, and as Meyers describes, \"triumphantly re-established Hemingway's literary reputation\".[103]\n\nIn January 1941 Martha was sent to China on assignment for Collier's magazine, and Hemingway accompanied her. Although Hemingway wrote dispatches for PM, he had little affinity for China.[104] They had returned to Cuba before the declaration of war by the United States that December, and he convinced the Cuban government to help him refit the Pilar to ambush German submarines.[21]\n\nDuring World War II, he was in Europe from June to December 1944. At the D-Day landing, military officials who considered him \"precious cargo\", kept him to a landing craft,[105] although biographer Kenneth Lynn claims Hemingway fabricated accounts that he went ashore during the landings.[106] Late in July he attached himself to \"the 22nd Infantry Regiment commanded by Col. Charles 'Buck' Lanaham, as it drove toward Paris\", and he led a small band of village militia in Rambouillet, outside of Paris.[105] Of Hemingway's exploits, World War II historian Paul Fussell remarks: \"Hemingway got into considerable trouble playing infantry captain to a group of Resistance people that he gathered because a correspondent is not supposed to lead troops, even if he does it well\".[21] This was in fact in contraversion to the Geneva Convention, and Hemingway was brought up on formal charges; he said he \"beat the rap\" by claiming that his entire participation was to give advice.[107] On August 25 he was present at the liberation of Paris, although the assertion that he was first in the city, or that he liberated the Ritz is considered part of the Hemingway legend.[108][109] While in Paris he attended a reunion hosted by Sylvia Beach, and \"made peace with\" Gertrude Stein.[110] Hemingway was present at heavy fighting in the Hürtgenwald near the end of 1944.[111] On December 17, a feverish and ill Hemingway had himself driven to Luxembourg to cover what would later be called The Battle of the Bulge. However, as soon as he arrived, Lanaham handed him to the doctors, who hospitalized him with pneumonia, and by the time he recovered a week later, the main fighting was over.[107]\n\nIn 1947 Hemingway was awarded a Bronze Star for his bravery during World War II. He was recognized for his valor in having been \"under fire in combat areas in order to obtain an accurate picture of conditions\", with the commendation that \"through his talent of expression, Mr. Hemingway enabled readers to obtain a vivid picture of the difficulties and triumphs of the front-line soldier and his organization in combat\".[21]\n\nWhen Hemingway initially arrived in England, he met Time magazine correspondent Mary Welsh in London, and was infatuated. Martha—who had been forced to cross the Atlantic in a ship filled with explosives because he refused to help her get a press pass on a plane—arrived in London to find Hemingway hospitalized with a concussion from a car accident. Unsympathetic to his plight, she accused him of being a bully, and told him she was \"through, absolutely finished.\"[112] The last time he saw her was in March 1945, as he was preparing to return to Cuba.[113] Meanwhile, he had asked Mary Welsh to marry him on their third meeting.[112]\n\nCuba and the Nobel Prize[]\n\nHemingway said he \"was out of business as a writer\" from 1942 to 1945.[114] In 1946 he married Mary, who had an ectopic pregnancy five months later. Hemingway and Mary had a series of accidents and health problems after the war: in a 1945 car accident he \"smashed his knee\" and sustained another \"deep wound on his forehead\"; Mary broke her right ankle and then her left ankle in successive skiing accidents. In 1947 his sons Patrick and Gregory were in a car accident, leaving Patrick with a head wound and severely ill.[115] Hemingway became depressed as his literary friends died: in 1939 Yeats and Ford Madox Ford; in 1940 Scott Fitzgerald; in 1941 Sherwood Anderson and James Joyce; in 1946 Gertrude Stein; and the following year in 1947, Max Perkins, Hemingway's long time Scribner's editor and friend.[116] During this period he had severe headaches, high blood pressure, weight problems, and eventually diabetes—much of which was the result of previous accidents and heavy drinking.[117] Nonetheless, early in 1946 he began work on The Garden of Eden, finishing 800 pages by June.[118][119] During the post–war years he also began work on a trilogy to be called \"The Land\", \"The Sea\" and \"The Air\" which he intended to combine in one novel titled The Sea Book. However, both projects stalled and Mellow considers Hemingway's inability to continue \"a symptom of his troubles\" during these years.[120][121]\n\nIn 1948 Hemingway and Mary traveled to Europe. During a several months long stay in Venice he fell in love with the then 19 year old Adriana Ivancich. The platonic love affair inspired the novel Across the River and Into the Trees, published in 1950 to bad reviews.[122] The relationship with Adriana lasted until 1955.[123] In 1951 Hemingway wrote the draft of Old Man and the Sea in eight weeks, considering it \"the best I can write ever for all of my life\".[117] The Old Man and the Sea became a book-of-the month selection, made Hemingway an international celebrity, and won the Pulitzer Prize in May 1952, a month before he left for his second trip to Africa.[124][125]\n\nIn Africa he was seriously injured in two successive plane crashes. Hemingway chartered a sightseeing flight of the Belgian Congo as a Christmas present to Mary. On their way to photograph Murchison Falls from the air, the plane struck an abandoned utility pole and \"crash landed in heavy brush.\" Hemingway's injuries included a head wound, while Mary broke 2 ribs.[126] The next day, attempting to reach medical care in Entebbe, they boarded a 2nd plane that exploded at take-off with Hemingway suffering burns and another concussion, this one serious enough to cause leaking of cerebral fluid.[127] They eventually arrived in Entebbe to find reporters covering the story of Hemingway's death. He briefed the reporters, and spent the next few weeks recuperating and reading his obituaries.[128]\n\nDespite his injuries, Hemingway accompanied Patrick and his wife on a planned fishing expedition in February, but pain caused him to be irascible and difficult to get along with.[129] When a bushfire broke out he was again injured, with second degree burns on his legs, front torso, lips, left hand and right forearm.[130] Months later in Venice, \"according to Mary they learned the full extent of Hemingway's injuries\". She reported to friends that he had two cracked discs, a kidney and liver rupture, a dislocated shoulder and a broken skull.[129] The accidents may have precipitated the physical deterioration that was to follow. After the plane crashes, Hemingway, who had been \"a thinly controlled alcoholic throughout much of his life, drank more heavily than usual to combat the pain of his injuries.\"[131]\n\nIn October 1954 Hemingway received the Nobel Prize in Literature. He modestly told the press that Carl Sandburg, Isak Dinesen and Bernard Berenson deserved the prize,[132] but the prize money would be welcome.[133] Mellow claims Hemingway \"had coveted the Nobel Prize\", but when he won it, months after his plane accidents and the ensuing world-wide press coverage, \"there must have been a lingering suspicion in Hemingway's mind that his obituary notices had played a part in the academy's decision.\"[134] Because he was suffering pain from the African accidents, he decided against traveling to Stockholm.[135] Instead he sent a speech to be read, defining the writer's life: \"Writing, at its best, is a lonely life. Organizations for writers palliate the writer's loneliness but I doubt if they improve his writing. He grows in public stature as he sheds his loneliness and often his work deteriorates. For he does his work alone and if he is a good enough writer he must face eternity, or the lack of it, each day.\"[136][137]\n\nFrom the end of the year in 1955 to early 1956, Hemingway was bedridden.[138] He was told to stop drinking to mitigate liver damage, advice he initially followed but then disregarded.[139] In October 1956 he returned to Europe and met Basque writer Pio Baroja, who was seriously ill and died weeks later. During the trip Hemingway became sick again, and was treated for \"high blood pressure, liver disease, and arteriosclerosis\".[138]\n\nIn November, while in Paris, he was reminded of trunks he had stored in the Ritz Hotel in 1928 and never retrieved. The trunks were filled with notebooks and writing from his Paris years. Excited about the discovery, when he returned to Cuba in 1957 he began to shape the recovered work into his memoir A Moveable Feast.[140] By 1959 he ended a period of intense activity: he finished A Moveable Feast (scheduled to be released the following year); brought True at First Light to 200,000 words; added chapters to The Garden of Eden; and worked on Islands in the Stream. The latter three were stored in a safe deposit box in Havana, as he focused on the finishing touches for A Moveable Feast. Reynolds claims that it was during this period he slid into depression, from which he was unable to recover.[141]\n\nThe Finca Vigia became crowded with guests and tourists, as Hemingway, beginning to become unhappy with life there, considered a permanent move to Idaho. In 1959 he bought a home overlooking the Big Wood River, outside of Ketchum, and left Cuba—although he apparently remained on easy terms with the Castro government, telling the New York Times he was \"delighted\" with Castro's overthrow of Havana.[142][143] He was in Cuba in November 1959, between returning from Pamplona and traveling west to Idaho, and the following year for his birthday; however, that year he and Mary decided to leave after hearing the news that Castro wanted to nationalize property owned by Americans and other foreign nationals.[144] In July 1960 the Hemingways left Cuba for the last time, leaving art and manuscripts in a bank vault in Havana. After the 1961 Bay of Pigs Invasion, the Finca Vigia was expropriated by the Cuban government, complete with Hemingway's collection of \"four to six thousand books\".[145]\n\nIdaho and suicide[]\n\nHemingway continued working on A Moveable Feast through the end of the 1950s,[140][146] and in the summer of 1959 he visited Spain to research a series of bullfighting articles for Life Magazine.[147]By January he returned to Cuba and continued work on the Life magazine series. The manuscript grew to 63,000 words—Life wanted only 10,000 words—and he asked A. E. Hotchner to help organize the work that would become The Dangerous Summer. Hotchner found Hemingway to be \"unusually hesitant, disorganized, and confused\".[148][149]\n\nAlthough Hemingway's mental state was noticeable in the summer of 1960, he again traveled to Spain to obtain photographs for the manuscript. Without Mary, he was lonely and took to his bed for days, retreating into silence. The first installments of The Dangerous Summer were published in Life in September 1960 to good reviews. When he left Spain, he went straight to Idaho,[150] but was worried about money and his safety.[148]\n\nHemingway believed the FBI was actively monitoring his movements.[151] In fact, the FBI had opened a file on him during WWII, when he used the Pilar to patrol the waters off Cuba, and J. Edgar Hoover had an agent in Havana watch Hemingway during the 1950's.[151] The FBI knew Hemingway was at the Mayo Clinic, as an agent documented it in a letter written in January 1961.[152] Hemingway suffered from physical problems as well: his health declined and his eyesight was failing.[152] In November he was admitted to the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota,[150] where he may have believed he was to be treated for hypertension.[153] Meyers writes that \"an aura of secrecy surrounds Hemingway's treatment at the Mayo\", but confirms that in December 1960 he received electroconvulsive therapy as many as 15 times, then in January 1961 he was \"released in ruins\".[154]\n\nThree months later, back in Ketchum, Mary found Hemingway holding a shotgun one morning. She called Dr. Saviers, who sedated him and had him admitted to the Sun Valley Hospital; from there he was returned to the Mayo for more shock treatments.[155] While Hemingway consented to the additional treatments, he was bitter about their apparent effect on his memory and writing. As he put it,\n\n\"What these shock doctors don't know is about writers...and what they do to them...What is the sense of ruining my head and erasing my memory, which is my capital, and putting me out of business? It was a brilliant cure but we lost the patient.\"[156]\n\nHe was released in late June and arrived home in Ketchum on June 30. Two days later, in the early morning hours of July 2, 1961, Hemingway \"quite deliberately\" shot himself with his favorite shotgun.[157] He unlocked the gun cabinet, went to the front entrance of their Ketchum home, and \"pushed two shells into the twelve-gauge Boss shotgun, put the end of the barrel into his mouth, pulled the trigger and blew out his brains.\"[158] Mary called the Sun Valley Hospital, and Dr. Scott Earle arrived at the house within \"fifteen minutes\". Despite his finding that Hemingway \"had died of a self-inflicted wound to the head\", the story told to the press was that the death had been \"accidental\".[159] During his final years, Hemingway's behavior was similar to his father's before he himself committed suicide;[160] his father may have had the genetic disease hemochromatosis, in which the inability to metabolize iron culminates in mental and physical deterioration.[161] Medical records made available in 1991 confirm that Hemingway's hemochromatosis had been diagnosed in early 1961.[162] His sister Ursula and his brother Leicester also committed suicide.[163] Added to Hemingway's physical ailments was the additional problem that he had been a heavy drinker for most of his life.[117] Writing in \"Ernest Hemingway: A Psychological Autopsy of a Suicide\", Christopher Martin evaluates the causes of the suicide: \"Careful reading of Hemingway's major biographies and his personal and public writings reveals evidence suggesting the presence of the following conditions during his lifetime: bipolar disorder, alcohol dependence, traumatic brain injury, and probable borderline and narcissistic personality traits\".[164] Martin claims suicide was inevitable because Hemingway \"suffered from an enormous burden of psychiatric comorbidities and risk factors for suicide\", although without a clinical evaluation of the patient, Martin concedes a diagnosis is difficult.[164]\n\nHemingway's family and friends flew to Ketchum for the funeral, which was officiated by the local Catholic priest, who believed the death accidental.[159] Of the funeral (during which an altar boy fainted at the head of the casket), his brother Leicester wrote: \"It seemed to me Ernest would have approved of it all.\"[165]\n\nIn a press interview five years later Mary Hemingway admitted her husband had committed suicide.[166]\n\nWriting style[]\n\nThe New York Times wrote in 1926 of Hemingway's first novel: \"No amount of analysis can convey the quality of The Sun Also Rises. It is a truly gripping story, told in a lean, hard, athletic narrative prose that puts more literary English to shame.\"[167] The Sun Also Rises is written in the spare, tightly written prose, for which Hemingway is famous; a style that has influenced countless crime and pulp fiction novels.[168] In 1954, when Hemingway was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, it was for \"his mastery of the art of narrative, most recently demonstrated in The Old Man and the Sea, and for the influence that he has exerted on contemporary style.\"[169]\n\nHenry Louis Gates believes Hemingway's style was fundamentally shaped \"in reaction to [his] experience of world war\". After World War I, he and other modernists \"lost faith in the central institutions of Western civilization,\" by reacting against the \"elaborate style\" of 19th century writers; and by creating a style \"in which meaning is established through dialogue, through action, and silences—a fiction in which nothing crucial—or at least very little—is stated explicitly.\"[21]\n\nIf a writer of prose knows enough of what he is writing about he may omit things that he knows and the reader, if the writer is writing truly enough, will have a feeling of those things as strongly as though the writer had stated them. The dignity of movement of an ice-berg is due to only one-eighth of it being above water. A writer who omits things because he does not know them only makes hollow places in his writing. —Ernest Hemingway in Death in the Afternoon[170]\n\nBecause he began as a writer of short stories, Baker believes Hemingway learned to \"get the most from the least, how to prune language, how to multiply intensities and how to tell nothing but the truth in a way that allowed for telling more than the truth.\"[171] Hemingway referred to his style as the iceberg theory: in his writing the facts float above water; the supporting structure and symbolism operate out-of-sight.[171] Writing in \"The Art of the Short Story,\" he explains: \"A few things I have found to be true. If you leave out important things or events that you know about, the story is strengthened. If you leave or skip something because you do not know it, the story will be worthless. The test of any story is how very good the stuff that you, not your editors, omit.\"[172]\n\nJackson Benson believes Hemingway used autobiographical details as framing devices about life in general—not only about his life. For example, Benson postulates that Hemingway used his experiences and drew them out with \"what if\" scenarios: \"what if I were wounded in such a way that I could not sleep at night? What if I were wounded and made crazy, what would happen if I were sent back to the front?\"[173] The concept of the iceberg theory is sometimes referred to as the \"theory of omission.\" Hemingway believed the writer could describe one thing (such as Nick Adams fishing in \"The Big Two-Hearted River\") though an entirely different thing occurs below the surface (Nick Adams concentrating on fishing to the extent that he does not have to think about anything else).[174]\n\nThe simplicity of the prose is deceptive. Zoe Trodd believes Hemingway crafted skeletal sentences in response to Henry James's observation that World War I had \"used up words.\" Hemingway offers a \"multi-focal\" photographic reality. His iceberg theory of omission is the foundation on which he builds. The syntax, which lacks subordinating conjunctions, creates static sentences. The photographic \"snapshot\" style creates a collage of images. Many types of internal punctuation (colons, semicolons, dashes, parentheses) are omitted in favor of short declarative sentences. The sentences build on each other, as events build to create a sense of the whole. Multiple strands exist in one story; an \"embedded text\" bridges to a different angle. He also uses other cinematic techniques of \"cutting\" quickly from one scene to the next; or of \"splicing\" a scene into another. Intentional omissions allow the reader to fill the gap, as though responding to instructions from the author, and create three-dimensional prose.[175]\n\nIn the late summer that year we lived in a house in a village that looked across the river and the plain to the mountains. In the bed of the river there were pebbles and boulders, dry and white in the sun, and the water was clear and swiftly moving and blue in the channels. Troops went by the house and down the road and the dust they raised powdered the trees. —Opening passage of A Farewell to Arms showing Hemingway's use of the word and[176]\n\nIn his literature, and in his personal writing, Hemingway habitually used the word \"and\" in place of commas. This use of polysyndeton may serve to convey immediacy. Hemingway's polysyndetonic sentence—or in later works his use of subordinate clauses—uses conjunctions to juxtapose startling visions and images; Jackson Benson compares them to haikus.[177][178] Many of Hemingway's followers misinterpreted his lead and frowned upon all expression of emotion; Saul Bellow satirized this style as \"Do you have emotions? Strangle them.\"[179] However, Hemingway's intent was not to eliminate emotion, but to portray it more scientifically. Hemingway thought it would be easy, and pointless, to describe emotions; he sculpted collages of images in order to grasp \"the real thing, the sequence of motion and fact which made the emotion and which would be as valid in a year or in ten years or, with luck and if you stated it purely enough, always.\"[180] This use of an image as an objective correlative is characteristic of Ezra Pound, T. S. Eliot, James Joyce, and Proust.[181] Hemingway's letters refer to Proust's Remembrance of Things Past several times over the years, and indicate he read the book at least twice.[182] His writing was likely also influenced by the Japanese poetic canon.[183][184]\n\nThemes[]\n\nRecurring themes in American literature exist with clarity in Hemingway's work. Leslie Fiedler sees the theme he defines as \"The Sacred Land\" — the American West — extended in Hemingway's work, to include mountains in Spain, Switzerland and Africa, and to the streams of Michigan. The American West is given a symbolic nod with the naming of the \"Hotel Montana\" in The Sun Also Rises and For Whom the Bell Tolls.[185] Although Hemingway writes about sports, Carlos Baker believes the emphasis is more on the athlete than the sport.[186] According to Stoltzfus and Fiedler, Hemingway's nature is a place for rebirth, for therapy, and the hunter or fisherman has a moment of transcendence when the prey is killed.[187] Nature is where men are without women: men fish; men hunt; men find redemption in nature.[185]\n\nFiedler believes Hemingway inverts the American literary theme of the evil \"Dark Woman\" versus the good \"Light Woman\". The dark woman — Brett Ashley of The Sun Also Rises — is a goddess; the light woman — Margot Macomber of \"The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber\"— is a murderess.[185] Robert Sholes admits that early Hemingway stories, such as \"A Very Short Story\", present \"a male character favorably and a female unfavorably.\"[188] According to Rena Sanderson, early Hemingway critics lauded his male-centric world of masculine pursuits, and the fiction divided women into \"castrators or love-slaves.\" Feminist critics attacked Hemingway as \"public enemy number one\", although more recent re-evaluations of his work \"have given new visibility to Hemingway's female characters (and their strengths) and have revealed his own sensitivity to gender issues, thus casting doubts on the old assumption that his writings were one-sidedly masculine.\"[189] Nina Baym believes that Brett Ashley and Margot Macomber \"are the two outstanding examples of Hemingway's 'bitch women.'\"[190]\n\nThe theme of women and death is evident in stories as early as \"Indian Camp\". The theme of death permeates Hemingway's work. Young believes the emphasis in \"Indian Camp\" was not so much on the woman who gives birth or the father who commits suicide, but on Nick Adams who witnesses these events as a child, and becomes a \"badly scarred and nervous young man.\" Hemingway sets the events in \"Indian Camp\" that shape the Adams persona. Young believes \"Indian Camp\" holds the \"master key\" to \"what its author was up to for some thirty-five years of his writing career.\" [191] Stoltzfus considers Hemingway's work to be more complex with a representation of the truth inherent in existentialism: if \"nothingness\" is embraced, then redemption is achieved at the moment of death. Those who face death with dignity and courage live an authentic life. Francis Macomber dies happy because the last hours of his life are authentic; the bullfighte in the corrida represents the pinnacle of a life lived with authenticity.[187] In his paper The Uses of Authenticity: Hemingway and the Literary Field, Timo Müller writes that Hemingway's fiction is successful because the characters live an \"authentic life\", and the \"soldiers, fishers, boxers and backwoodsmen are among the archetypes of authenticity in modern literature\".[54]\n\nThe theme of emasculation is prevalent in Hemingway's work, most notably in The Sun Also Rises. Emasculation, according to Fiedler, is a result of a generation of wounded soldiers; and of a generation in which women such as Brett gained emancipation. This also applies to the minor character, Frances Clyne, Cohn's girlfriend in the beginning in the book. Her character supports the theme not only because the idea was presented early on in the novel but also the impact she had on Cohn in the start of the book while only appearing a small number of times.[185] Baker believes Hemingway's work emphasizes the \"natural\" versus the \"unnatural\". In \"Alpine Idyll\" the \"unnaturalness\" of skiing in the high country late spring snow is juxtaposed against the \"unnaturalness\" of the peasant who allowed his wife's dead body to linger too long in the shed during the winter. The skiers and peasant retreat to the valley to the \"natural\" spring for redemption.[186]\n\nSome critics have characterized Hemingway's work as misogynistic and homophobic. Susan Beegel analyzed four decades of Hemingway criticism, published in her essay \"Critical Reception\". She found, particularly in the 1980s, \"critics interested in multiculturalism\" simply ignored Hemingway; although some \"apologetics\" have been written. Typical is this analysis of The Sun Also Rises: \"Hemingway never lets the reader forget that Cohn is a Jew, not an unattractive character who happens to be a Jew but a character who is unattractive because he is a Jew.\" During the same decade, according to Beegel, criticism was published that investigated the \"horror of homosexuality\", and racism in Hemingway's fiction.[192]\n\nInfluence and legacy[]\n\nHemingway's legacy to American literature is his style: writers who came after him emulated it or avoided it.[193] After his reputation was established with the publication of The Sun Also Rises, he became the spokesperson for the post–World War I generation, having established a style to follow.[168] His books were burned in Berlin in 1933, \"as being a monument of modern decadence\", and disavowed by his parents as \"filth\".[194] Reynolds asserts the legacy is that \"he left stories and novels so starkly moving that some have become part of our cultural heritage.\"[195] In a 2004 speech at the John F. Kennedy Library, Russell Banks declared that he, like many male writers of his generation, was influenced by Hemingway's writing philosophy, style, and public image.[196] Müller reports that Hemingway \"has the highest recognition value of all writers worldwide\".[197] Conversely, as early as the 1930s Hemingway's style was parodied, and criticized as \"lazy\" within the context of the \"American literary tradition.\"[198]\n\nBenson believes the details of Hemingway's life have become a \"prime vehicle for exploitation\", resulting in a Hemingway industry.[199] Hemingway scholar Hallengren believes the \"hard boiled style\" and the machismo must be separated from the author himself.[194] Benson agrees, describing him as introverted and private as J.D. Salinger, although Hemingway masked his nature with braggadocio.[200] In fact, during World War II, Salinger met and corresponded with Hemingway, whom he acknowledged as an influence.[201] In a letter to Hemingway, Salinger claimed their talks \"had given him his only hopeful minutes of the entire war\" and jokingly \"named himself national chairman of the Hemingway Fan Clubs.\"[202]\n\nThe extent of Hemingway's influence is seen in the tributes and echoes of his fiction in popular culture. A minor planet, discovered in 1978 by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Stepanovich Chernykh, was named for him (3656 Hemingway);[203] Ray Bradbury wrote The Kilimanjaro Device, with Hemingway transported to the top of Mount Kilimanjaro;[79] the 1993 motion picture Wrestling Ernest Hemingway, about the friendship of 2 retired men, Irish and Cuban, in a seaside town in Florida, starred Robert Duvall, Richard Harris, Shirley MacLaine, Sandra Bullock, and Piper Laurie.[204] The influence is evident with the many restaurants named \"Hemingway\"; and the proliferation of bars called \"Harry's\" (a nod to the bar in Across the River and Into the Trees).[205] A line of Hemingway furniture, promoted by Hemingway's son Jack (Bumby), has pieces such as the \"Kilimanjaro\" bedside table, and a \"Catherine\" slip-covered sofa. Montblanc offers a Hemingway fountain pen, and a line of Hemingway safari clothes has been created.[206] The International Imitation Hemingway Competition was created in 1977 to publicly acknowledge his influence and the comically misplaced efforts of lesser authors to imitate his style. Entrants are encouraged to submit one \"really good page of really bad Hemingway\" and winners are flown to Italy to Harry's Bar.[207]\n\nIn 1965 Mary Hemingway established the Hemingway Foundation and in the 1970s she donated her husband's papers to the John F. Kennedy Library. In 1980 a group of Hemingway scholars gathered to assess the donated papers, subsequently forming the Hemingway Society, \"committed to supporting and fostering Hemingway scholarship.\"[208]\n\nAlmost exactly 35 years after Hemingway's death, on July 1, 1996, his granddaughter Margaux Hemingway died in Santa Monica, California. Margaux was a supermodel and actress, co-starring with her sister Mariel in the 1976 movie Lipstick.[209] Her death was later ruled a suicide, making her \"the fifth person in four generations of her family to commit suicide.\"[210] Margaux's sister, Mariel, is an actress, model, writer and film producer.[211]\n\nPublications[]\n\nPoetry[]\n\nThree Stories & Ten Poems.
