        "text": "By Shawn Parker\n\nThis episode holds a special place in my heart.\n\nErnest Hemingway has been my favorite author since my freshman year in high school (when he overtook J.R.R. Tolkien in my pantheon of legends). I have since read all of his novels, most of his short stories, and even letters he wrote to friends that contained his favorite recipes for drinks and pan-fried trout. When I was offered the opportunity to assist Sheridan College, the City of Sheridan, and Sheridan County on attracting a 2020 Hemingway Society event, I jumped at the challenge.\n\nAnd then 2020 happened.\n\nLucky for us, the conference was not cancelled outright, but rather pushed to July 18-24, 2021. And with that delay came an opportunity for my office to showcase why exactly the Hemingway society chose Sheridan County as host for this prestigious event, why fans of Hemingway and American literature should consider visiting, and why the author himself came to Wyoming over and over again.\n\nFor me, this passage from A Farewell to Arms perfectly answers the question why:\n\n“But we were never lonely and never afraid when we were together. I know that the night is not the same as the day: that all things are different, that the things of the night cannot be explained in the day, because they do not then exist, and the night can be a dreadful time for lonely people once their loneliness has started. But with Catherine there was almost no difference in the night except that it was an even better time. If people bring so much courage to this world the world has to kill them to break them, so of course it kills them. The world breaks every one and afterward many are strong at the broken places. But those that will not break it kills. It kills the very good and the very gentle and the very brave impartially. If you are none of these you can be sure it will kill you too but there will be no special hurry.”\n\nAnd with this passage as our guide, we proudly present to you Death in the Mountains: Ernest Hemingway’s Wyoming.\n\nDeath on the Mountains alludes to Hemingway’s non-fiction book about Spanish bullfighting. The book is a remarkable exploration of the nature of fear and courage, which, put simply, could define any grand adventure in the Bighorn Mountains. To that end, our story is not about death being an end, but of the death of old things, and the beginning of new experiences. Of how the mountains change us, and of how Wyoming becomes a critical part of our selves.\n\nTHE WYO THEATER\n\nSheridan in the late 1920s was a rip-roaring place, and while Hemingway found some of the peace and quiet he so fervently desired at the Sheridan Inn, there were also many distractions to occupy a young man’s attention.\n\nOne of those distractions was the WYO Theater, known then as the Lotus. The Lotus was legendary in its time for its Vaudeville acts, but also for its showing of early motion pictures. The theater was lauded as Wyoming’s Wonder Picture Palace, given its state-of-the-art chops, and ability to show the most modern films and performances. The WYO, since its opening in 1923, has always been deeply tied to the cultural heart of Sheridan. In fact, when the first talkies were show in 1929, hundreds of people from all over Northern Wyoming flocked to Sheridan for the event. And in the mid-1930s, when Sheridan’s reputation as a dude ranching mecca reached its zenith, the Lotus was rebranded the “Western Theater for Western People.” A remodeling dressed the theater in massive log slabs, pine panels, huge western murals, buffalo heads, and Indian rugs. It’s really no surprise why Hemingway loved to visit this place, when it was charged with so much energy. Of course, little has changed – the WYO continues to host local events, galas, and festivals, like the world-famous WYO Film Festival.\n\nTHE MINT BAR\n\nThere were plenty of other distractions for young Ernest back in those early days. Remember that he visited during Prohibition, when booze flowed more freely than perhaps any other time in American history. One place he loved to imbibe was the Mint Bar, a watering hole that needs no introduction.\n\nFrom its time as The Mint Cigar Company and Soda Shop with a speakeasy run in the back room during the sneaky times of Prohibition, to the multiple times horses stopped in for a drink, The Mint Bar has served as a backdrop for the personal legends of generations.\n\nHemingway famously loved his drink, but he was also a veracious carnivore. While in Wyoming, Hemingway served his friends a lunch of bear steaks: “The meat was rank and stringy, cooked middling rare, and eaten in the form of sandwiches made from sourdough pancakes spread with orange marmalade. But Ernest consumed his portion with evident gusto, chewing long and appreciatively, his black beard glossy with bear fat,” said a friend.\n\nSPEAR-O-WIGWAM\n\nSpear-O’s association with Hemingway has brought much attention to the mountains over the years. This, wild place is as spectacular today as it was nearly a century ago. His intention upon visiting Spear-O in 1928 was to find a quiet place to “finish the damn book,” in reference to A Farewell to Arms (which was eventually completed in Wyoming).\n\nBut rather than go into detail on Hemingway’s time in Wyoming here, we encourage you to watch our special episode of The Backyard, and check out the resources we have included below. And we hope that you will consider joining us next year, when the Hemingway Society celebrates the legendary author’s life and times in Wyoming.\n\nTHE DETAILS\n\nHOW TO GET THERE:\n\nThe WYO Theater and the Mint Bar are located on Main Street, in the heart of Downtown Sheridan. Folly Ranch, briefly mentioned in our episode, is located in the Bighorn National Forest, but is not open to the public. Please respect rights of the landowners and do not attempt to visit on your own. The Bozeman Stable Grillroom & Saloon is located in the heart of beautiful Big Horn, Wyoming, a short, scenic drive from downtown Sheridan.\n\nSpear-O Wigwam:\n\nStraight shot via Big Horn and Red Grade\n\nFor the impatient adventurer! 28 Miles – approx. 1 hour – high clearance vehicle recommended. Not for inexperienced mountain drivers.\n\nScenic route through Ranchester and Dayton\n\nEasier, longer drive than Red Grade. Plenty to see on the way. Relax and enjoy the mountains. 72 Miles – approx. 3 hours, longer with a climb up Steamboat Point about 12 miles past Dayton. Exhilarating!\n\nFor more detailed driving instructions to Spear-O, visit www.spearowigwam.com\n\nENJOY NATURAL PLACES RESPONSIBILITY\n\nSheridan County Travel & Tourism, the Wyoming Office of Tourism, the US Forest Service, Sheridan County, and all our local communities hope you have a wonderful experience when you explore Wyoming. We want to encourage you to WY Responsibly, and wish to share these great tips. For more information, please visit https://travelwyoming.com/wy-responsibly\n\nWyoming’s wide-open spaces make for epic camping and hiking. But before you set out, here are a few things to know.\n\nAvoid overcrowding: Outdoor recreation is more popular than ever right now, causing overcrowding in some of Wyoming’s most beautiful areas. So what do you do if you show up to a trail and the parking lot is packed? Instead of joining the crowd, know what other options are around. Be ready to seek different trails and lesser-known experiences. We have dozens of suggestions on our website.\n\nKeep it clean: Almost half of Wyoming’s 98,000 square miles is publicly owned, including many undeveloped areas that have no bathrooms or garbage facilities. It is up to all of us to do our part in keeping these spaces clean. Take all trash with you when you leave, don’t burn glass and metal in your campfire and bury human waste at least 100 feet from water sources.\n\nBe fire aware: Help prevent human-caused fires by following basic best practices. Respect fire bans in place, choose a campsite with a pre-existing fire ring whenever possible and never leave your fire unattended. Make sure you have plenty of water available to put out your fire; you’ll need to completely extinguish it at night and before you leave camp. And remember, there are strict guidelines on fires in the Cloud Peak Wilderness.\n\nStick to the trails: Ride, hike or drive only on designated trails to help reduce impacts and protect wildlife. Planning to do some off-roading? The state of Wyoming requires a permit to use trails and roads that are part of Wyoming’s State ORV program. You can find more information on trail etiquette in Wyoming here.\n\nRespect Local History: Tread lightly and take only photographs with you when you leave. You will find ancient historic and ceremonial sites, Indian Wars Battle Sites, and many other iconic locations on your travels our here. Sites like the Medicine Wheel are still in use by native peoples; pictograph and rock art sites are extremely fragile, and should not be touched, defaced, or otherwise disturbed. We appreciate all of the wonderful folks who come to Wyoming to explore responsibly.\n\nWILDERNESS REGULATIONS:\n\nNote that professional filming is not allowed within the Cloud Peak Wilderness, and therefore, all the filming for The Backyard takes place outside of the wilderness boundary, in the Bighorn National Forest. Please remember to practice good leave no trace principals, and leave the wilderness, as well as the forest, in the same condition you found it, so that those who come next may experience it the same way you did.\n\nClick here for more information on wilderness regulations via the US Forest Service.\n\nWHEN TO GO:\n\nSheridan County is a bustling community year-round, with many events, activities and attractions operating 12 months of the year. Spear-O is currently open seasonally (with plans to open longer in the future); please call ahead when you are considering a vacation in the Bighorns.\n\nIf you are interested in experiencing the Hemingway Society’s Hemingway in Wyoming and Montana Conference, July 18-24, 2021, please sign up for information at www.hemingwaysociety.org\n\nRESOURCES:\n\nWYO History:\n\nThere are several excellent Hemingway in Wyoming resources available.
