        "text": "I met Ernest Hemingway in the ninth grade. Not the Nobel Prize winning writer, but his novel, “The Old Man and The Sea.” It was required reading in Ms. Lyon’s literature class but I spent much of third period math sneaking glances at the book open on my lap below the desk. While Mr. Manfred worked through a geometry equation, I met Santiago, the Cuban fisherman who had gone eighty-four days without a catch. I learned the boy Manolin’s parents forbid him to fish with Santiago who planned to sail alone from Cuba into the Straits of Florida. There in the Gulf Stream, he believed his luck would change in the deep water where the schools of bonita and albacore lived.\n\nIt was nine that night when my brother complained about the light and I retreated to our single bathroom. I was still reading in the empty tub at midnight when my mother knocked at the door. “Do you know what time it is?” she whispered.\n\n“No...I’m almost finished with this book,” I thumbed the remaining pages.\n\n“You have school tomorrow,” she reminded me.\n\n“Ten pages more,” I returned to Santiago and his cramping left hand.\n\n“Andrew,” she whispered and returned to bed.\n\nBy then the Marlin had found Santiago’s bait.\n\n“Yes,” he said. “Yes,” and shipped his oars without bumping the boat. He reached for the line and held it softly between the thumb and forefinger of his right hand. He felt no straining nor weight and he held the line lightly. Then it came again. This time it was a tentative pull, not solid nor heavy, and he knew exactly what it was. One hundred fathoms down a marlin was eating the sardines that cover the point and the shank of the hook where the hand-forged hook projected from the head of the small tuna.”\n\nThirteen years old and embraced by the tub’s cold porcelain, I could not know how hard Hemingway must have worked to write sentences that drove goose flesh onto my arms and back. Sitting in the bow of Santiago’s skiff, I listened to the Old Man beseech the fish, “Just smell them. Aren't they lovely? Eat them good now and then there is the tuna. Hard and cold and lovely. Don’t be shy, fish. Eat them.”\n\nDuring the following two hours I felt Santiago’s pain when the Marlin ran and the line cut into his right hand. I watched the blood drift away when he rinsed it in the Gulf Stream. And then when the fish died and gripped by his own approaching death, Santiago lashed it to his boat and turned toward Cuba, I felt the strike of the first shark and the despair when the Old Man’s good fishing knife broke off in the Mako’s head. I suffered through the passage when he finally reached home and the Marlin’s skeleton remained as a testament to Santiago’s courage, failure and guilt. Hemingway wrote when Manolin found the Old Man, “The boy saw the old man was breathing and then saw the old man’s hands and started to cry.” At that moment the power of Hemingway flooded into the cold tub and I too started to cry.\n\nI finished the book at two am. Haunted by images of the old fisherman and the giant Marlin, I didn’t sleep that night and for days afterward would stare into the distance. Years later I can still summon images of the Marlin’s first bite that served as a warning of the fight to come. And I still see the skeleton lashed to the skiff and of Santiago dragging the mast up the street. Hemingway knew exactly what he intended when he wrote the scene. I may have been thirteen, but the hard image of Jesus dragging a cross along the Via Delarosa in Old Jerusalem haunted me as I lay in the bathtub.\n\nI was living on Front Street in Lahaina on Maui when I submitted my first short story. Hammered out on a Royal typewriter there was no way to correct typos, no way to cut and paste—no email or text. It was all careful hunt and peck, snail mail, self-addressed stamped envelopes and months waiting for a response. My first was about an old woman waiting for an afternoon train in Martinez, California. Born before the Great Quake, she had lived well and loved many and now waited for long dead friends she was sure were on the train. I slipped the manuscript into a manila envelope, addressed it to The Atlantic Monthly and dropped it in front of a half-blooded Hawaiian postman.\n\nTouched by the salt air, the Royal gradually rusted to a stop while I waited for a reply that never came. Three in One oil eventually freed the keys but it spotted my manuscripts and between the stained pages and a year of rejections, it took a day to pack my fins, mask, shorts and scuba regulator and catch a flight back to San Francisco.\n\nI didn’t track Ernest Hemingway to Ketchum, Idaho. Instead I planned to ski a hundred and twenty days between November and April. Crossing Trail Creek bridge on Highway 93 on a late afternoon in October of 1974, I looked west to the cottonwoods that flared brilliant yellow above the Wood River then to Bald Mountain that brooded over the small town and finally to the yellow and red aspens that crowded into the blue, sage covered south slopes. That evening I followed Main Street past the Casino Club, Slaveys, Lane Mercantile and Duffy Witmer’s Pioneer Saloon that remained unchanged since the writer lived his final years in the Hemingway House above the confluence of Warm Springs Creek and the Wood River."
