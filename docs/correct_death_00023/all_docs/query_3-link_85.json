        "text": "If there ever was a candidate for history’s real “Most Interesting Man In the World,” the frontrunner for the title would have to be famed writer, boxer, veteran, and adventurer Ernest Hemingway. He drove an ambulance in World War I, covered the Spanish Civil War, hunted Nazi submarines in the Pacific, gave relationship advice to F. Scott Fitzgerald, and even drank with Castro after the 1959 Cuban Revolution.\n\nThat brief paragraph barely scratches the surface of the man’s epic life. But truthfully, Hemingway should have died many, many times during his epic journey. In the end, he was the only one who could have ever ended such a life. The Grim Reaper was probably afraid to come around.\n\nAs the man himself once said, “Death is like an old whore in a bar. I’ll buy her a drink but I won’t go upstairs with her.”\n\nThis article originally appeared on We Are The Mighty\n\nMore From We Are The Mighty\n\nThis Long-Forgotten Unit was the Direct Predecessor of Delta\n\nDifferences Between Delta Force and SEAL Team 6\n\nAirmen Prepare for Heavenly Warefare in Space Flag\n\nFollow We Are The Mighty on Twitter\n\nREAD NEXT\n\n2019 Hot Jobs for Veterans\n\n(VIDEO) Submit to G.I.
