        "text": "Mary Welsh Hemingway was a journalist and author, and the fourth wife of Ernest Hemingway. She wrote for the Chicago Daily News and the Daily Express in London, a position which brought her to Paris in the years leading up to World War II. During the war she worked as correspondent for Time and Life.\n\nOne day in London in 1944, Mary was having lunch with the playwright Irwin Shaw when Hemingway approached and asked to be introduced to her. Like Hemingway, Mary was married at the time; but Mary’s husband, an Australian reporter named Noel Monks, was out of the country, and Hemingway was determined in his pursuit.\n\nIn the summer of 1953, twenty years after Hemingway’s first safari, Mary and Ernest travelled to East Africa. During the trip they were involved in two separate plane crashes on successive days. Mary broke two ribs and was knocked unconscious in the first crash; Ernest nearly died in the second. A search plane spotted the wreckage of the first crash but failed to see any survivors, and news of Hemingway's death was reported around the world.\n\nIn 1959, Hemingway and Mary moved to their home in Ketchum, Idaho, which they had purchased as a fall-back in case the revolution in Cuba made it impossible to stay there.\n\nOn the morning of Sunday, July 2, 1961, in their home in Idaho, Mary was awakened by a loud bang. Ernest had commited suicide. He was sixty-one.\n\nAfter Ernest's death, Mary served as his literary executor. She edited A Moveable Feast from Ernest’s unfinished manuscript and notes. For many readers, the novel would be Ernest Hemingway’s final masterpiece.\n\nMary’s autobiography, entitled How It Was, was published in 1976.\n\nMary Welsh Hemingway, the widow of Ernest Hemingway, died on November 26, 1986 in New York City. She’s buried next to her husband, in Ketchum, Idaho.\n\nBorn: April 5, 1908, Walker, Minnesota\n\nDied: November 26, 1986, New York, New York"
