        "text": "Hemingway lived in Chicago very briefly just after World War I. There he met his first wife, Hadley Richardson. The newlyweds moved to Paris soon after.\n\nErnest Hemingway lived in Toronto, Canada, twice: a few months in the winter of 1920; a few more in 1923-1924. Ongoing work for The Toronto Star provided the young writer with needed support.\n\nHemingway's three decades on the Gulf Stream, its importance to his world-view, and the works inspired by his research and experiences.\n\nErnest Hemingwayâ€™s twenty-two year relationship with Idaho began in 1939, deepened over many long autumn stays in the Wood River Valley, and culminated with him making his final home in Ketchum in 1959. He died by suicide there in 1961 and is buried alongside family and close friends in the Ketchum cemetery. Idaho subtly influenced several of Hemingway's later works, most notably For Whom the Bell Tolls."
