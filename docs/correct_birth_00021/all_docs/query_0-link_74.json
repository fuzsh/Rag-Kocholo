        "text": "It has been announced that the pre-Broadway world premiere stage adaptation of Prince’s legendary film and album, PURPLE RAIN, will take place in Prince’s hometown, Minneapolis, in Spring 2025.\n\nThe musical will be staged at Hennepin Theatre Trust’s historic State Theatre in Minneapolis as part of its 2024-2025 Bank of America Broadway on Hennepin season. Exact production dates and additional production details will be announced in the coming weeks.\n\nPrince’s former manager L Londell McMillan and founder of Primary Wave Music Larry Mestel said: “Prince talked about adapting PURPLE RAIN for the stage for years. It’s only fitting that we launch this world premiere musical version in the city where it all began, Prince’s hometown, Minneapolis. We’re very excited for the creative team to be inspired by the Minneapolis sound and the unparalleled and unique spirit of the city that Prince inspired.”\n\nAs previously announced, this stage adaptation will feature a book by two-time Pulitzer Prize-finalist Branden Jacobs-Jenkins, based on the original screenplay by Albert Magnoli and William Blinn, with music and lyrics by Prince, and direction by Tony Award-nominee Lileana Blain-Cruz."
