        "text": "CHANHASSEN, Minnesota – It’s almost as if Prince himself is going to greet us in the next room.\n\nThe Minnesota-born musician, who died in 2016, is still very much alive at Paisley Park, the home-studio he built in suburban Minneapolis.\n\nHere’s the Little Kitchen, where he cheered on the Minnesota Lynx women’s pro basketball team; the studio where he (and many others) recorded some of the top music of the 1980s and beyond; his pianos, his guitars, his shoes and elaborate outfits.\n\nMore than a house and more than an office, Paisley Park is a 65,000 square-foot shrine to a musician and music generally, a love letter to what was and what might have been.\n\nInterestingly, Prince’s death wasn’t mentioned on my recent 90-minute tour of the complex. I asked tour guide Laurel Gray why not.\n\n“We concentrate on his life and legacy,” she told me.\n\nI would argue that Prince’s death – an accidental fentanyl overdose on the grounds of this estate – and the huge outpouring of sympathy it triggered is part of his legacy. But no matter. His 57 years on earth provide more than enough material for an educational, entertaining tour.\n\nMusical prodigy\n\nBorn in 1958, Prince Rogers Nelson grew up in Minneapolis, the son of two musicians; his dad, John Nelson, used the stage name Prince.\n\nThe junior Prince was a prodigy piano player who formed his first band at age 14. He signed with Warner Bros. in 1977.\n\nPaisley Park – the name of the complex is taken from one of Prince’s songs -- is not some millionaire musician’s over-the-top mansion. The building, constructed in 1986 and 1987, looks like it belongs in a suburban office park, with nondescript white walls hiding a trove of Prince treasures. The purple symbol out front is the only clue of what lies within.\n\nMost of the complex is workspace – Paisley Park has just two bedrooms, both on the second floor, off-limits to tours. The property opened to the public just a few months after Prince’s death, fulfilling a desire by the musician to turn his home studio into a museum.\n\nAdmission is by guided tour only. Upon entry, visitors are required to deposit their cell phones in Yondr bags, to prevent photos or recordings. We were permitted to retrieve our devices to document the last couple of stops on the tour, including the Paisley Park Soundstage, where numerous movies, music videos and other programming were filmed.\n\nOn tours, the soundstage serves as something of a concert venue, with Prince performing “1999″ on a huge screen, with iconic items from his career displayed around the perimeter, including the piano and microphone from his last show in 2016, his 2006 baby blue Bentley and a custom case that he would sometimes hide inside to surreptitiously exit concert venues.\n\nMuch of the building is as it was when Prince lived and worked here, including the vending machine in the kitchen stocked with his favorite candy bar, Snickers.\n\nWhite clouds are set against a blue sky on the ceiling in the atrium. “Prince wanted to give the illusion that there were no ceilings,” said Gray. There are even two live doves on site, Majesty and Divinity.\n\nPrince’s office is largely intact, although an adjacent closet has been outfitted with a “Lovesexy” theme, including costumes and instruments and other memorabilia from the 1988 album.\n\nOther stops on the tour:\n\n* The Purple Rain Room, originally used as dance rehearsal space, has several items and props from the 1984 movie, including one of three motorcycles used in the film, a purple piano (“It still has scuff marks from Prince dancing on it,” said Gray) and the Acadamy Award Prince won for best original song score.\n\n* The Beautiful Collection, an exhibit of 300 pairs of custom-made shoes on display, most of a similar style, but with wide variations in color and pattern. A pair of shoes was made to match every single outfit created for Prince. “Be sure to note the many variations of the color purple alone,” reads a display. Among the shoes here: the glittery pair from the “Diamonds are Forever” gala in 1999, featuring a purple bat logo from the “Batman” era in 1989, and a white with black polka dots pair he wore to the Grammy Awards in 1988.\n\n* The Emancipation Room, formerly a game room, which attempts to explain Prince’s dispute with Warner Bros. and his decision to change his name in 1997 to an unpronounceable symbol, a merging of the male and female symbols. During this time, he also appeared with the word “Slave” written on his face, a not-so-subtle protest against corporate influence over artistic freedom.\n\nAmong the tour highlights was Studio A, “the center of Prince’s recording universe,” according to Gray. “Most songs and albums that you know and love were probably recorded here.” Those include “Batman,” “Diamonds and Pearls” and “Emancipation.”\n\n“Prince would be alone in this space for hours and hours,” said Gray, who pointed out a condenser microphone hanging above a black chair behind glass. “Prince preferred to sit when recording vocals.”\n\nShe then played for us an unreleased track, “Cheesy,” recorded on Sept. 18, 1983.\n\n“There’s so much Prince music we haven’t heard yet,” she said. “Lucky for us we haven’t heard the last from him.”\n\nStudio A was – and still is – used by other musicians, including Sting, Madonna, REM, Lizzo and Mavis Staples.\n\nOutside the studio is a mural Prince commissioned – with musicians who influenced him on one side and musicians he influenced on the other. Among those on the right side: James Brown, Miles Davis, Joni Mitchell and Carlos Santana. And those on the left: Sheila E., Morris Day and the Time, Wendy and Lisa and others.\n\n“The mural is 15 years old,” said Gray. “Imagine how many more would be on the left today?”\n\nThe tour ends at the Paisley Park Soundstage and NPG Music Club, both still in use.\n\nGray noted that in 2016, when Madonna was touring in Minneapolis, she stopped by Paisley Park and Prince “serenaded her for three hours straight.\n\n“You would never guess what would happen when you came down here,” she said. She added: “These events always happened late – at 3, 4 or 5 a.m., Prince would finally take the stage.”\n\nAbsent attending one of those epic middle-of-the-night shows, touring Paisley Park may be the next best thing.\n\nIf you go: Paisley Park\n\nWhere: 7801 Audubon Road, Chanhassen, about 20 miles west of downtown Minneapolis\n\nWhen: The estate is open five days a week, Thursday through Monday. Tours are by timed entry only.\n\nHow much: The Paisley Experience, a 90-minute tour, is $65; longer tours include the two-hour VIP Experience ($100) and the three-hour Ultimate Experience ($189).\n\nMore information: paisleypark.com"
