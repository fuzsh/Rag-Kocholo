        "text": "Superstar musician Prince has died, according to a family member. He was 57 years old.\n\nThe singer was reported to be not feeling well earlier this month when he cancelled a concert in Atlanta. He performed a few days later, seemingly in good health. After the show, his plane had to make an emergency landing because of a medical issue, which representatives cited as the flue. A spokesperson said that he was fine and resting at home.\n\nPolice were notified of a death at Prince’s Minnesota home Thursday morning. His publicist later confirmed that it was the musician, but the cause of death has not been released.\n\nAn autopsy was conducted Friday and it will likely be several days before results are determined. The Carver County sheriff’s department said that it did not appear to be suicide.\n\nPrince was born Rogers Nelson and has gone by many names during his career, including a symbol of love pronounced “The Artist Formerly Known as Prince.” He won seven Grammy awards and sold over 100 million albums. He won an Academy Award for best original score for “Purple Rain.” He performed at the Super Bowl halftime show in 2007— a performance generally regarded as one of the best in Super Bowl history.\n\nThe singer-songwriter-guitarist was enormously prolific across genres, from rock to funk to R&B. His hits include “Raspberry Beret,” “1999,” “Kiss,” “When Doves Cry,” and “Nothing Compares 2 U.”\n\nPrince’s death was mourned across the country and around the world as fans celebrated his life and legacy.\n\nThis post will be updated as details are released."
