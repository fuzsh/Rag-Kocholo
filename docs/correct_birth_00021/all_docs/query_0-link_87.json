        "text": "The stage adaptation of Purple Rain has set a world premiere run for Minneapolis, Minnesota's State Theatre, where performances will begin in spring 2025. Exact dates are to be announced.\n\nAs previously announced, Pulitzer finalist and Appropriate playwright Branden Jacobs-Jenkins is penning the book, adapted from Albert Magnoli and William Blinn's screenplay for the 1984 film. Seven-time Grammy winner Prince starred in the original film, which also featured a soundtrack of songs written and performed by the late artist. The Minneapolis world premiere will see the musical debut in Prince's hometown.\n\nThe project is being shepherded by director Lileana Blain-Cruz and producer Orin Wolf.\n\nPurple Rain tells an original story of an up-and-coming Minneapolis rock musician. The movie was a hit with audiences upon release, though it is the film's soundtrack—which comprises nine songs written and performed by Prince—that has been the most enduring. His work on the songs and score earned Prince Grammy and Academy Awards, and the album has since been certified 13-times Platinum. Among the songs included are \"When Doves Cry,\" \"The Beautiful Ones,\" \"Baby I'm a Star,\" and the title song. Prince died in 2016.\n\n\"Prince talked about adapting Purple Rain for the stage for years. It’s only fitting that we launch this world premiere musical version in the city where it all began, Prince’s hometown, Minneapolis,\" say NorthStar Group Chairman L Londell McMillan and Primary Wave Music Founder and CEO Larry Mestel in a joint statement. “We’re very excited for the creative team to be inspired by the Minneapolis sound and the unparalleled and unique spirit of the city that Prince inspired.\"\n\nNo casting has been revealed. The Minneapolis engagement is being billed as \"pre-Broadway,\" indicating that a Main Stem bow is planned to follow.\n\nJacobs-Jenkins previously contributed new material to Lincoln Center Theater's 2022 Broadway revival of The Skin of Our Teeth, also directed by Blain-Cruz. He's currently making his Broadway debut with Appropriate, running at The Hayes Theater via Second Stage and starring Sarah Paulson. His earlier works include The Comeuppance, Girls, Everybody, Gloria, and An Octoroon."
