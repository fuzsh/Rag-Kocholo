        "text": "Just a short trip from Mall of America and Bloomington, you can step into The Purple One’s beloved studio and home and party like it’s 1999.\n\nIf there is one place Prince loved more than any other, it was his birthplace and lifelong home of Minnesota. His passion for his Minnesotan roots and the local music culture ran so deep that he built his home filled with music, Paisley Park, right near the Twin Cities and was a regular at many local establishments. The unique artist home and studio space was where the late Prince welcomed celebrated artists and neighbors for a creative, collaborative escape. Today it is still a space open to the public for tours and open at night for special inspiring arts and cultural events with the mission to promote diverse artists.\n\nToday you can retrace the iconic singer’s steps and explore the place he called home, only minutes away from Mall of America. For any Prince fan, a trip to experience Paisley Park is a must. It is located in Chanhassen, Minnesota, only a 20-minute drive from Bloomington so it can easily fit in your schedule. On the outside, Paisley isn’t too flashy, with it’s simple yet elegant white tiled exterior with purple hued lighting illuminating the building at night. On the inside, Prince’s style shines through! The Paisley Experience gives you access to a 90-minute guided tour of Prince’s home and creative sanctuary where you can visit the legendary sky-blue atrium, recording studios, soundstage, concert hall and private NPG Music Club. You will also be able to see some of his instruments, collectable photos, numerous Grammy Awards and of course, some pieces from his iconic wardrobe.\n\nIf that isn’t enough Prince for you, Paisley Park also offers some enhanced tour experiences. You can upgrade to the VIP Tour Experience which is a longer guided tour with access to additional\n\ncontent, rooms and studio areas, a chance to see more Prince artifacts and an exclusive photo opportunity in a limited access area. For the ultimate fan, book the three-hour Ultimate Experience and see even more exclusive content, additional rooms, have a private screening of exclusive video footage of Prince in his editing suite and hear some of his never-released music. Truly a once in a lifetime experience.\n\nBeyond Paisley Park, tributes to Prince are throughout the Twin Cities and your time with Prince doesn’t need to end with your tour at Paisley. Visit major Prince landmarks around the Twin Cities, including First Avenue nightclub, where Purple Rain was filmed and Prince has a gold star on the side of the building dedicated to him. Additional must-see spots include The Electric Fetus record store, a favorite spot for Minnesota artists and music fans; the \"Kids Home\" from Purple Rain; a photo opportunity at the Prince wall mural; a visit to an underground graffiti tunnel, where there is Prince art galore; plus, the famous music note mural in Minneapolis dedicated to our vibrant music scene.\n\nBetter yet, MSP International Airport has a Prince store where you can purchase exclusive apparel, music, books, memorabilia and gifts for loved ones who also love Prince! At Mall of America, there is the Prince Music Company store that sells guitars inspired by Prince’s expansive instrument collection.\n\nFinish off your trip with something sweet and enjoy Prince’s favorite dessert, a slice of turtle cheesecake from Cheesecake Funk. Since 2013, a local baker, Vanessa Drews, has been baking sweet treats for Paisley Park events and has now expanded her cheesecake business to be served at establishments across the Twin Cities.
