        "text": "Introducing Prince\n\nPrince Rogers Nelson was born June 7, 1958, in Minneapolis, Minn. He released his debut album, For You, in 1978, followed by Prince (1979), Dirty Mind (1980) and Controversy (1981). All of them traded in his trademark sound — deep synth funk grooves with provocatively sexual lyrics and heart-piercing ballads sung in pure falsetto.\n\n‘1999’ in 1982\n\nHis mainstream breakthrough came with back-to-back albums with his backing band the Revolution: In 1982, 1999 launched several pop and dance floor hits onto the charts, including \"Little Red Corvette\" and the title song, a post-apocalyptic party anthem.\n\n‘Purple Rain’ (1984)\n\nThe album — a soundtrack to his movie-starring debut — was a searing musical backdrop to a semi-autobiographical tale of \"the Kid,\" a Minneapolis rocker from an abusive family. The album launched five singles, two of which — “When Doves Cry” and \"Let’s Go Crazy” — went to No. 1 on the Billboard chart.\n\nCirca 1986\n\nPrince starrted in 1986's Under the Cherry Moon, in which he played a gigolo wooing Kristin Scott Thomas in the south of France. The movie bombed, but produced a successful soundtrack album: Parade, which featured the hits \"Kiss\" and \"Mountains.\"\n\nCirca 1991\n\nThroughout the 1990s, Prince was backed by a large band known as The New Power Generation, and his sound moved away from synth and heavy rock guitars and into one of brassier R&B.\n\nTackling the Grammys with Beyonce (2004)\n\nThe legend's opening performance with Beyonce at the 2004 Grammy Awards is known as one of the best in the awards' history.\n\nMarried Man (2004)\n\nPrince and his wife Manuela Testolini, to whom he was married from 2001 to 2006. Previously, he was married to his backup singer and dancer Mayte Garcia from 1996 to 1999.\n\nEssence Music Festival (2004)\n\nIn New Orleans, he wore a wig, sunglasses, and a false goatee as a disguise with the opening act of the Essence Music Festival.\n\nSuper Bowl XLI Halftime Press Conference (2007)\n\nThe musician performed a set during the Super Bowl XLI Halftime Press Conference, which took place on Feb. 1, 2007 in Miami, Florida.\n\nSuper Bowl XLI Halftime Show (2007)\n\nPrince performed a medley of iconic hits during his Super Bowl XLI Halftime Show in 2007, including \"Baby I'm a Star,\" \"Let's Go Crazy,\" Creedence Clearwater Revival's \"Proud Mary\" and Foo Fighters' \"Best of You.\" The Super Bowl match between the Indianapolis Colts and the Chicago Bears took place on Feb. 4 in Miami Gardens, Florida.\n\nApollo Theater Gala (2009)\n\nPrince and Mariah Carey were both in attendance at the Apollo Theater's 75th Anniversary Gala, which took place on June 8, 2009 in New York City.\n\nPerforming With Mary J. Blige (2012)\n\nThe iconic singer surprised audiences when he joined Mary J. Blige onstage at the 2012 iHeartRadio Music Festival for a duet of \"Nothing Compares 2 U.\""
