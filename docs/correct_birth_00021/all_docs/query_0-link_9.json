        "text": "Get your umbrellas! The pre-Broadway world premiere stage adaptation of Princeâs legendary film and album, Purple Rain, will take place in Princeâs hometown, Minneapolis, MN, in Spring 2025.Â\n\nThe musical will be staged at Hennepin Theatre Trustâs historic State Theatre in Minneapolis as part of its 2024- 2025 Bank of America Broadway on Hennepin season. Exact production dates and additional production details will be announced in the coming weeks.\n\nâPrince talked about adapting Purple Rain for the stage for years. Itâs only fitting that we launch this world premiere musical version in the city where it all began, Princeâs hometown, Minneapolis,â said L Londell McMillan, former Prince manager, attorney and Chairman of The NorthStar Group, and Larry Mestel, Founder & CEO of Primary Wave Music.Â\n\nAs previously announced, this stage adaptation will feature a book by two-time Pulitzer Prize-finalist Branden Jacobs-Jenkins, based on the original screenplay by Albert Magnoli and William Blinn; music and lyrics by Prince; and direction by Tony Award-nominee Lileana Blain-Cruz.Â\n\nPrince Rogers Nelson is widely regarded as one of the greatest musicians of all time. A singer, songwriter, musician, and music producer, he received countless awards, nominations and accolades for his music, performances, and skill as a multi-instrumentalist, frequently playing all or most of the instruments on his recordings. His music incorporated a wide variety of styles, including funk, rhythm and blues, rock, new wave, soul, blues, jazz, and hip-hop. Prince produced his albums himself, pioneering the Minneapolis sound.\n\nPrince has sold over 150 million records worldwide, ranking him among the best-selling music artists of all time. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004, the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2006, and the Rhythm and Blues Hall of Fame in 2016. He received seven Grammy Awards, seven Brit Awards, six American Music Awards, four MTV Video Awards, and Academy Award for Best Original Score for Purple Rain, and a Golden Globe Award.\n\nPURPLE RAIN tells the fictional story of The Kid, an up-and-coming rock musician in the Minneapolis club scene, as he contends with a tumultuous home environment, a rival band, and a budding romance. Released in July 1984 by Warner Bros, the film was originated by Prince, directed by Albert Magnoli and written by Magnoli and William Blinn. It was Princeâs film debut.Â"
