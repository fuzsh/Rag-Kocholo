        "text": "REMEMBERING A MINNESOTA ICON\n\n'My name is Prince...'\n\nPrince Rogers Nelson was one of us. He was born in Minneapolis, grew up on the South Side and the North Side, and moved to Chanhassen when he became rich and famous. We flocked to his arena concerts, movies and intimate gatherings at Paisley Park. We saw him around town, taking in a Wolves game, browsing at the Electric Fetus or watching a show at the Dakota. Since the '70s when he was a newcomer to the music scene, through his heyday in the '80s, and on past his feud with his record label and resurgence as a more approachable artist, the Star Tribune has followed our biggest homegrown celebrity. Prince's energy and genius seemed boundless; they will live on in our hearts.\n\nAbove: A contact sheet of a Prince performance at First Avenue dated March 3, 1986 by David Brewster - Star Tribune\n\nCommemorative covers\n\nSee the four special covers the Star Tribune created to remember a Twin Cities music legend.\n\nA community grieves its Prince\n\nVideo (02:04): The Twin Cities erupted in memories, grief and song after the passing of Minnesota's brightest star.\n\nPrince's albums: A complete critical guide to all 37 official releases\n\nHere's a look at the legacy left by one of pop music's most prolific recording artists. The following list of 37 albums is as complete as we can make it, omitting remixes, fan-club releases and all but one best-of.\n\nMusicians speak the loudest on Prince's genius\n\nThink of all the other rock stars who wasted no time covering his songs. The president who took ample time talking him up to reporters. The late-night TV show that used all of its weekly time slot to honor him. The city that ignored time altogether and stayed up dancing until dawn three nights in a row.\n\nPrince of pop, king of style\n\nPrince was more than a musical virtuoso; he was a veritable style magnate. Onstage and off, his style transcended narrow gender constructs and pushed boundaries for what fashion means for both men and women. Prince fired a revolution in diversity in race and gender\n\nBeneath the glyph, the flamboyant outfits and all that purple, a sociocultural revolution was brewing.\n\nPrince and First Avenue: a history of the club's ties to its brightest star\n\nFirst Avenue nightclub will forever be tied to Prince's legacy, as it has been since 1981. Here's a look at the history they shared.\n\nDearly beloved: A variety of voices pay tribute to Prince\n\nTributes from our music critic and others Prince inspired\n\nKey events in Prince's life\n\nA look at the legacy left by Prince.\n\nPrincely tour of the Twin Cities\n\nGuide to the homes, hangouts and landmarks that Prince frequented and/or made famous."
