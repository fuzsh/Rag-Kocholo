        "text": "Prince Rogers Nelson (June 7, 1958 – April 21, 2016), professionally known as Prince, was an American singer-songwriter, dancer, actor, musician, and record producer. The recipient of numerous awards and nominations, he is widely regarded as one of the greatest musicians of his generation. He was known for his flamboyant, androgynous persona; his wide vocal range, which included a far-reaching falsetto and high-pitched screams; and his skill as a multi-instrumentalist, often preferring to play all or most of the instruments on his recordings. Prince produced his albums himself, pioneering the Minneapolis sound. His music incorporated a wide variety of styles, including funk, R&B, rock, new wave, soul, synth-pop, pop, jazz, and hip hop.\n\nPrince signed a record deal with Warner Bros. Records at the age of 19, soon releasing the albums For You (1978) and Prince (1979). He went on to achieve critical success with the influential albums Dirty Mind (1980), Controversy (1981), and 1999 (1982). His sixth album, Purple Rain (1984), was recorded with his new backing band the Revolution, and was also the soundtrack to the film of the same name in which he starred. Purple Rain garnered continued success for Prince and was a major commercial achievement, spending six consecutive months atop the Billboard 200 chart. The soundtrack also won Prince the Academy Award for Best Original Song Score. After disbanding the Revolution, Prince released the album Sign o' the Times (1987), widely hailed by critics as the greatest work of his career. In the midst of a contractual dispute with Warner Bros. in 1993, he changed his stage name to the unpronounceable symbol (known to fans as the \"Love Symbol\") and was often referred to as The Artist Formerly Known as Prince (or TAFKAP) or simply The Artist.\n\nAfter signing with Arista Records in 1998, Prince reverted to his original name in 2000. Over the next decade, six of his albums entered the U.S. top 10 charts. In April 2016, at the age of 57, Prince died after accidentally overdosing on fentanyl at his Paisley Park home and recording studio in Chanhassen, Minnesota. He was a prolific musician who released 39 albums during his life, with a vast array of unreleased material left in a custom-built bank vault underneath his home after his death, including fully completed albums and over 50 finished music videos. He also released songs under multiple pseudonyms during his life, as well as writing songs that were made popular after being covered by other musicians, most notably \"Nothing Compares 2 U\" by Sinéad O'Connor and \"Manic Monday\" by the Bangles. Estimates of the complete number of songs written by Prince range anywhere from 500 to well over 1,000. Released posthumously, his demo albums Piano and a Microphone 1983 (2018) and Originals (2019) both received critical acclaim.\n\nPrince sold over 120 million albums worldwide, ranking him among the best-selling music artists of all time. His awards included the Grammy President's Merit Award, the American Music Awards for Achievement and of Merit, the Billboard Icon Award, an Academy Award, and a Golden Globe Award. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004, the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2006, and the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame in 2016, and was inducted twice into the Black Music & Entertainment Walk of Fame in 2022.\n\nBiography\n\nEarly Life\n\nBorn in Minneapolis, Minnesota. His parents were John Nelson, a musician whose stage name was Prince Rogers, and Mattie Shaw, a jazz singer who performed with the Prince Rogers Band.\n\nPrince became interested in music at a young age and taught himself how to play the piano, guitar and drums. His parents broke up when he was about 10, and he and his sister split their time between their parents’ homes. He eventually ran away and moved in with neighbors, the Anderson family. In high school, Prince formed the band Grand Central (later known as Champagne) with André Anderson (who later changed his name to André Cymone) and Morris Day.\n\nIn 1978, Prince was signed to Warner Bros. Records. The record company agreed to give Prince creative control for three albums and retain his publishing rights. Husney and Prince then left Minneapolis and moved to Sausalito, California, where Prince's first album, For You, was recorded at Record Plant Studios. The album was mixed in Los Angeles and released on April 7, 1978. According to the For You album notes, Prince wrote, produced, arranged, composed, and played all 27 instruments on the recording, except for the song \"Soft and Wet\", whose lyrics were co-written by Moon. The cost of recording the album was twice Prince's initial advance. Prince used the Prince's Music Co. to publish his songs. \"Soft and Wet\" reached No. 12 on the Hot Soul Singles chart and No. 92 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song \"Just as Long as We're Together\" reached No. 91 on the Hot Soul Singles chart.\n\nBeginning of Career\n\nIn 1978, Prince dropped his debut album, For You, which was followed by Prince (1979). He played practically all of the instruments on the albums, and the sophomore release contained his first Top 20 pop hit, the easygoing \"I Wanna Be Your Lover.\" The critically acclaimed Dirty Mind dropped in 1980, consisting of material that was graphic in its exploration of sexuality and fantasy.\n\nControversy (1981) continued playing with the themes of its predecessor, as seen with the dance-oriented title track, which reached No. 3 on the R&B charts, as well as songs like \"Sexuality\" and \"Do Me Baby.\" Yet as Prince continued to develop his career, he would also be known for tracks that had a deep spirituality, with a yearning for majesty and wonder.\n\nThe singer found international success with the release of his 1982 album, 1999, which included the Top 20 title track, an exquisite synth-funk ode about nuclear doomsday, as well as the Top 10 hits \"Little Red Corvette\" and \"Delirious.\"\n\nPurple Rain\n\nWith his band the Revolution, Prince went on to create the classic album Purple Rain (1984), which also served as the soundtrack to the film of the same name, grossing almost $70 million at the U.S. box office. Co-starring Apollonia Kotero and Day, the movie garnered an Academy Award for Best Original Song Score.\n\nIts melancholy title track reached No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100, while the hits \"When Doves Cry\" and \"Let's Go Crazy\" both reached No. 1. While \"Crazy\" readily joined the pantheon of wild, electrifying rock songs, \"Doves Cry\" had one-of-a-kind signatures, displaying an otherworldly meld of electronic and funk elements without a traditional chorus. The soundtrack offered two other hits: \"I Would Die 4 U\" and \"Take Me With U.\" Prince simultaneously became a well-known visual icon with his trademark curls, flowing jackets and ruffled attire with punk embellishments.\n\n\"Darling Nikki\" was another tune from Purple Rain that incited controversy due to its explicit visuals. After senator Al Gore's wife Tipper Gore bought the album for their daughter and listened to the track, she eventually pushed for albums to sport labels that warned parents of graphic lyrics.\n\n1985 saw the release of Around the World in a Day, which had the Top 10 tracks \"Raspberry Beret,\" a whimsical mid-tempo tune, and \"Pop Life.\" The record continued to feature Prince's penchant for playing a range of instruments and desire to impart messages of self-love, as seen with \"Paisley Park,\" a track inspired by the name of his Minneapolis studios.\n\nIn 1986 Prince released his eighth studio album, Parade, which included his pulsating No. 1 pop/R&B single \"Kiss.\" Parade served as the soundtrack for the artist's second film, Under the Cherry Moon, which he directed and starred in.\n\nAfter the disbanding of the Revolution, Prince was able to consolidate various shelved projects into what ultimately became the double album Sign 'O' the Times (1987), with the title track reaching No. 3 on the pop charts and No. 1 in R&B. The album was known for its stark commentary on social issues yet also contained fun jams like \"U Got the Look,\" a raucous duet with Scottish singer Sheena Easton that reached No. 2 on the pop charts. (He had previously penned the lasciviously charged pop/R&B hit \"Sugar Walls\" from her 1984 album A Private Heaven.) Sign was easily among Prince's most critically acclaimed albums, yet its sales lagged in the U.S., finding more of an audience in Europe, where the artist launched a successful tour.\n\nMaintaining a prodigious output, Prince released Lovesexy in 1988, known for its album cover featuring a photo of the artist in the nude as well as the Top 5 up-tempo R&B hit \"Alphabet St.\"\n\nBy the time he released his 11th studio album, the soundtrack to Batman, in 1989, Prince had become one of America's most commercially successful pop artists, continually making waves on the charts. Batman offered up the No. 1 romp \"Batdance\" as well as the Top 5 R&B hit \"Partyman.\" The video for \"Batdance\" famously featured Prince in split-effect makeup and costuming meant to symbolize both the film's shadowy hero and his crazed nemesis, the Joker.\n\n1991 began with a performance in Rock in Rio II and marked the debut of Prince's new band, the New Power Generation, Prince's latest band that featured a blend of contemporary R&B, hip-hop, jazz and soul along with the vocals of Rosie Gaines. The group was first called out in the soundtrack to Graffiti Bridge, a 1990 sequel to Purple Rain that didn't fare well at the box office yet still yielded the Top 10 track \"Thieves in the Temple.\"\n\nPrince's work with the NPG continued to unashamedly toy with ideas around sexuality, gender norms and the body. To promote the album, Prince had appeared on the 1991 MTV Video Music Awards to do a live performance of \"Gett Off.\" Echoing parts of the track's music video, the performance featured an array of dancers and musicians in an onstage bacchanal, with the artist famously turning around towards the end of the song to show off his seatless pants.\n\nIn the fall of 1992 Prince had signed a record $100 million dollar deal with Warner Bros., which was considered \"the largest recording and music publishing contract in history\" at the time and allowed him the freedom to pursue TV, film, book and merchandising deals separately. As a comparison, fellow industry giants Michael Jackson and Madonna had $60 million-plus contracts that were all-inclusive.\n\nName Change\n\nThe lack of success for Love Symbol Album created tension between Prince and his record label Warner Bros. Over the ensuing years, the singer's career went through a roller coaster of ups and downs. Turned off by feeling controlled by his label, Prince changed his name to the unpronounceable glyph ( O(+> ) in 1993, a fusion of female and male astrological symbols which he used until 2000.\n\nDuring that time, he was more frequently referred to as \"the artist formerly known as Prince,\" and his new symbol was not embraced by most fans. He also started making appearances with the word \"SLAVE\" drawn on the side of his face, meant to convey the great disdain he had for his label. Prince did release the 1995 album The Gold Experience during this time of duress, and scored another Top 5 song with \"The Most Beautiful Girl in the World.\"\n\nAside from the symbol, he also had other aliases which include:\n\nThe Artist (Formerly Known as Prince) (TAFKAP)\n\nCamille\n\nJoey Coco\n\nThe Kid\n\nAlexander Nevermind\n\nJamie Starr\n\nTora Tora\n\nChristopher Tracy\n\nHis Royal Badness\n\nComeback\n\nAfter several years of relative obscurity, Prince returned to the limelight in 2004 to perform at the Grammy Awards with Beyoncé Knowles, the same year he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. That spring, he released Musicology with a tour that became the top concert draw in the United States. The album won two Grammys and added another dreamy ballad, \"Call My Name,\" to the Prince canon.\n\nHis next album, 3121, was released in 2006. That year, he wrote and performed \"Song of the Heart\" for the animated film Happy Feet, and won a Golden Globe (Best Original Song) for the composition. In 2007 he performed during the Super Bowl XLI halftime show on a massive stage shaped as his famous symbol amid pouring rain. The event was watched by 140 million fans.\n\n2010 was the year of accolades for Prince. He not only was lauded by Billboard.com as the greatest Super Bowl performer ever, but he was also featured in TIME magazine's \"100 Most Influential People in the World\" and earned a Lifetime Achievement Award from the BET Awards. He ended the year with an induction into the Grammy Hall of Fame.\n\nDeath\n\nOn April 21, 2016, Prince was found dead at his Paisley Park compound in Minnesota. The week prior, his plane made an emergency landing and the singer was hospitalized for what was purportedly a severe case of the flu, though reports later stated that the musician was actually given a life-saving \"safe shot\" for a Percocet overdose. The Carver County sheriff's department and Midwest Medical Examiner's office launched an investigation into the cause of death. After the autopsy was performed, his remains were cremated and his close family and friends gathered for a small, private funeral on April 23.\n\nAlmost two weeks after the musician's death, a lawyer revealed that Dr. Howard Kornfeld, a California-based physician who specializes in treatment for those dependent upon and addicted to pain medication, had been called upon by Prince's team to aid the musician. (The performer had undergone hip surgery some years earlier, and was believed to have endured recurring discomfort while giving concerts.) Kornfeld's son had reportedly flown to Prince's compound to initiate the recovery process and was among those who found him dead. While Prince's state of health at the time of his death is unknown, attorney William Mauzy said the artist \"was dealing with a grave medical emergency\" when Kornfeld was called, as reported by The Minneapolis Star Tribune.\n\nOn June 2, 2016, the Midwest Medical Examiner’s office released results of its investigation, which determined that Prince died from an accidental overdose of “self-administered” fentanyl, a synthetic opiate.\n\nTributes to a profoundly unique artist poured in from fans across the globe, as evidenced by impromptu memorials and celebrations of his work. With love especially hailing from the city where Prince was born and continued to live, thousands of mourners sang \"Purple Rain\" in downtown Minneapolis on the night of his death.\n\nHis Minnesota home/studio, Paisley Park, officially opened its doors as a museum in October 2016. The following month, his first posthumous song, \"Moonbeam Levels,\" was released. Additionally, production began on a documentary about the singer’s early years, entitled Prince: R U Listening?\n\nOn April 19, 2018, Carver County concluded its two-year investigation with the announcement that no criminal charges would be filed in Prince's death. Attorney Mark Metz said that it was unknown who supplied the musician with the fentanyl-laced pills that killed him, and that there was no evidence that any associates knew he was ingesting such a dangerous substance.\n\nMichael Jackson and Prince's Relationship\n\nRumors speculate that Prince and Michael Jackson shared an ongoing rivalry that went well beyond pop chart domination. According to some reports, the two legends even took their feud to physical and occasionally dangerous extremes. What began as occasional rumors or biographical tidbits leaped into the limelight a few years ago, with the release of a previously unheard Michael Jackson recording. Made in 1988 when Jackson was working on his autobiography, “Moonwalk,” the recording features the King of Pop speaking openly about his animosity toward His Royal Badness.\n\nTalking to an interviewer, Jackson said, “I have proven myself since I was real little. It’s not fair. He feels like I’m his opponent…I hope he changes because boy, he’s gonna get hurt. He’s the type that might commit suicide or something…I don’t like to be compared to Prince.” Later in the recording, Jackson described Prince as “one of the rudest people I have ever met,” who’d been “mean and nasty to my family.”\n\nIn 1983, James Brown was performing a concert when he invited Jackson onto the stage for some song and dance. Jackson demonstrated his impeccable vocals and classic dance moves like the James Brown Shuffle and the Moonwalk. He then whispered something in Brown’s ear. According to source he was letting Brown know that Prince was in the crowd as well. Brown stepped to the mic and told the crowd that someone named Prince would be joining them onstage. Seizing the opportunity, Prince hopped onstage and played on the guitar. Taking off his jacket to reveal a bare chest, he started howling into the mic and executing some sexy dance moves of his own. He then exited stage right and leaned against a prop lamppost, unceremoniously falling into the crowd and bringing the lamppost with him. After the performance, rumors report that Prince tried to run Michael over with a limousine after being embarrassed onstage. Though many believe its nothing more than tabloids.\n\nWhile working on Bad, Quincy Jones suggested that Prince and Michael should perform together on the song for the upcoming album of the same name. Likewise, they would both appear in the adjoining music video, which depicted faux gang warfare and predictably exceptional dance choreography. According to legend, Prince was initially somewhat receptive to the idea…until he saw the lyrics. Specifically, the opening line “Your butt is mine” turned him off to the entire idea. In a 1997 interview with comedian Chris Rock, Prince offered up his take on the whole affair: “You know that Wesley Snipes character? That would have been me…You run that video in your mind. The first line in that song is, ‘your butt is mine’ so I was saying, ‘Who gonna sing that to whom? Because you sure ain’t singing it to me, and I sure ain’t singing it to you.’ So right there we got a problem.” Actor Wesley Snipes put forth a different narrative in a 2017 interview when he said, “Me and Prince were auditioning together, and I blew Prince out of the water…Michael had told Prince that he had the role, and then he met me and kicked Prince to the curb. Imagine that.”\n\nIn an interview with Esquire, Rolling Stone contributing editor Steve Knopper recalled a story once told to him by Black Eyed Peas leader will.I.Am. Here’s what Knopper had to say:\n\n“When Prince was doing his Vegas residency around late 2006, Michael was living in Vegas. Will was a guest artist at the Prince residency, but he was also friends with Michael. So Will arranged it for Michael to be a guest in the audience at Prince’s show. No one knew it really, but Prince knew it. There was a point during the show where Prince was playing bass and he came out into the audience with this giant bass—he knew where Michael was sitting—and he walked right up to Michael and started playing bass in Michael’s face. Like aggressive slap bass.”\n\n“The next morning, Will went over to Michael’s house for breakfast, and they’re talking about Prince and the show. And then Michael goes, ‘Will, why do you think Prince was playing bass in my face?’ “Michael was outraged. And then started going on. ‘Prince has always been a meanie. He’s just a big meanie. He’s always been not nice to me. Everybody says Prince is this great legendary Renaissance man and I’m just a song-and-dance man, but I wrote “Billie Jean” and I wrote “We Are the World” and I’m a songwriter too.'”\n\nDespite the apparent animosity, there was one story that states the day Michael Jackson died, Prince locked himself in a room for several days and didn't speak to anyone. He refused to speak about Jackson's death publicly afterward, saying that he felt \"too close\" to it. Prince did, however, tell talk show host Tavis Smiley that despite the tensions between them, Prince had nothing but respect for Michael's creative genius. He even defended him from his child abuse allegations.\n\nIn a question on Quora with the title \"Did Prince and Michael Jackson really have a rivalry?\", Randall Peede––who claims to have worked in one of Jackson's tours––answered, \"How could Prince ignore Michael? Dislike? No. A smiling rivalry, yes. Both were similar-aged black men who were frequently on the edge of genius. Not much competition for those two. They were both really nice people.\"\n\nMichael Jackson and Prince were two of the most iconic and influential musicians of their time, both achieving immense success and leaving a lasting impact on popular music. There are several reasons why people often compared them:\n\nMusical Prowess: Both Michael Jackson and Prince were exceptionally talented musicians, singers, and songwriters.

Their popularity and fan loyalty led to natural comparisons and debates among fans about their respective talents and contributions to music.\n\nIt's important to note that while comparisons between Michael Jackson and Prince were common, they were also recognized as unique artists with their own individual styles and contributions. Each artist had a distinct musical identity and left an indelible mark on the music industry, making them legendary figures in their own right.\n\nGallery\n\nVideos\n\nDiscography\n\nPrince's albums discography consists of forty studio albums (including four soundtrack albums and one posthumous album), five live albums, and numerous compilations.
