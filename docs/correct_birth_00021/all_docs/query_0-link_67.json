        "text": "For fans of Prince, the musician’s death just over a year ago from an accidental opioid overdose still stings.\n\nDrama with supposed heirs, his first ex-wife’s tell-all memoir, and the music distribution and streaming deals have not helped with the grief.\n\nAround the anniversary of his death, though, fans were treated to a celebration of his life at Paisley Park. In late April, thousands of fans gathered at his Paisley Park complex in Chanhassen, a suburb of Minneapolis, to celebrate his 35-plus years of making phenomenal music.\n\n“There is an instant community with Prince fans,” said Sherida Bradby, a Richmond-area fan who attended Celebration 2017 at Paisley Park, where Prince lived and worked.\n\n“A big part of it was to be with others who feel the same way I do. No one in my day-to-day life understands. It’s good to be with people you don’t have to explain yourself to,” said Bradby, a supervising librarian who has been a Prince fan for decades.\n\nSince last fall, Paisley Park has been operated as a museum by Graceland Holdings, which also manages Elvis Presley’s home, Graceland, in Memphis, Tenn. Visitors can tour the studios where Prince created music and experience the album- and era-themed rooms that hold his guitars, wardrobe and other memorabilia.\n\nOn weekends, events have included DJ dance parties and concert footage screenings. You may even get a chance to sample some of his favorite dishes, prepared by the chefs who cooked for him.\n\n“Everybody had a different reason to be there and a different connection,” said Rodney Keller, another Richmond-area resident who attended the celebration. He said he saw Prince in concert 13 times, including twice in Richmond.\n\n“But at the end of the day, we all had something in common that brought the community together,” Keller said. “It’s the music, the musicianship. You never know what you are going to get with Prince. It was pretty cool that for four days we didn’t think a lot about the world’s problems. We were on Prince time, and that’s what it was like going to a Prince concert.”\n\nCelebration 2018 is already planned for April 19-22. Tickets will be available first to those who attended this year, with return visitors having the option of reserving a spot with a $100 deposit. This year’s tickets cost $500 to $1,000. (More on that in a minute.)\n\nIf you’ve never been to Minneapolis and are a Prince fan, Celebration 2018 would be a great time to connect with Prince’s Purple Army of fans.\n\nBut the musician’s hometown is a great place to visit anytime. The bike-friendly city has 22 lakes and a population of about 411,000. In nearby Bloomington, the behemoth Mall of America has an indoor theme park. Minneapolis is also home to a number of professional sports teams: football’s Minnesota Vikings, basketball’s Minnesota Timberwolves and baseball’s Minnesota Twins.\n\nAnd it’s easy for Richmond-area residents to get there. Delta Airlines recently added a second daily nonstop flight from Richmond, though any airline can get you there. A quick look at fares for July and August showed a range of $276 to $419 for a round-trip ticket.\n\nPrince was proud of his hometown, featuring the city in his music and on his clothing. See for yourself! If you visit, add these Prince-inspired places to your must-see list.\n\nPaisley Park\n\nA visit to Paisley Park — Prince’s studios, offices and concert venue — is a must. Sign up beforehand for a tour (regular or VIP) at https://officialpaisleypark.com. The $100 VIP tour is longer than the regular tour and includes a commemorative photo. Since cameras and recording devices are prohibited at Paisley Park, this is your best chance at getting a photo. (During Celebration cellphones were turned off and locked inside pouches that participants carried with them. Staff unlocked the pouches as people left.)\n\nFor quality time at Prince’s compound, Celebration 2018 would be your best bet. Although details (other than the dates) aren’t available yet, it’s likely to resemble this year’s event. For Celebration 2017, fans paid $500 to $1,000 for four days of events. People who bought VIP tickets ($1,000) enjoyed such extras as on-site parking, priority seating and more intimate studio tours.\n\nEach of the four days offered five hours of events in two waves — either from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. or 5 to 10 p.m.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | RSS Feed | Omny Studio\n\nEach wave kicked off with an hour of concert footage. Day one featured Prince’s “Piano & A Microphone Tour,” filmed at Paisley Park the January before he died. Each five-hour block ended with a live performance. Day one was George Clinton and his band, Parliament Funkadelic. Clinton collaborated with Prince, recorded at his studio and was in Prince’s movie “Graffiti Bridge.” On the other days, The Revolution, Morris Day and The Time, New Power Generation and 3rdEyeGirl performed.\n\nIn between, there were panel discussions with those who worked with Prince, including guitar techs, wardrobe folks, photographers, studio engineers, road crews, band mates and his hairstylist. There were lots of Prince stories — Prince the workaholic, Prince the practical joker, Prince the perfectionist, Prince the musical genius.\n\nAll that talk can make a Prince fan hungry. Organizers thought of that, too, and made food available on site. For an extra $100, participants received a four-day meal ticket for a buffet of food inspired by Prince’s vegetarian lifestyle. Each day’s offerings (prepared at Paisley Park) included pasta and rice dishes, a green salad, cookies and drinks.\n\nMusic venues\n\nWith so many Prince fans in town during Celebration, other venues in Minneapolis took advantage of the crowds to offer Prince-themed events.\n\nBunker’s Music Bar & Grill, Dakota Jazz Club and Restaurant and Lee’s Liquor Lounge all had performances by musicians who had worked with Prince or who did tribute concerts. Vocalist Shelby J, who performed with Prince’s New Power Generation band, performed and released her new album at Dakota. Jesse Johnson, former bass player with The Time, played at Bunkers. Vocalist and guitarist Andy Allo, also part of New Power Generation, sang at Dakota.\n\nAll the venues offer live music year-round. Just visit their websites to see a schedule of upcoming performances.\n\nFirst Avenue, where the music and some scenes from “Purple Rain” the movie and album were filmed, offers live music year-round. During Celebration weekend, the venue hosted a Prince-themed street party and dance parties. First Avenue also offers a behind-the-scenes tour of the venue by guides who might tell Prince stories. Book early because slots are limited.\n\nSightseeing\n\nThere’s a Prince-themed bus tour, or you can go it alone with a car and a map from the Minneapolis Convention & Visitors Association.\n\nSome places to visit: the house where some outside scenes from “Purple Rain” were filmed; Prince murals on the Chanhassen Cinema and in the Uptown neighborhood; the Electric Fetus record store that Prince gave a shout-out to now and then; and Lake Minnetonka, made famous in the movie “Purple Rain.”\n\nSome other Prince themes appeared around town for Celebration 2017: an exhibit of Prince-themed quilts at Textile Center; Prince’s purple maxi coat from the film “Purple Rain” on display at the Minnesota History Center in nearby St. Paul. Hard Rock Cafe at the Mall of America has Prince clothing and guitars on display.\n\nFans have created their own memorial to Prince in two nearby tunnels near Paisley Park. Prince supposedly rode his bicycle through the Riley Creek tunnels, which connect to a city park. Graffiti and images and messages to him line the tunnels.\n\nReasons to go\n\nMinneapolis and Paisley Park without Prince? You may ask, “Why bother?”\n\nBradby said she went because she wanted to honor Prince’s legacy and escape the anniversary stories that dwelled on how he died.\n\n“For a lot of people that seemed to overtake all that he had accomplished and had left behind. ... I knew if I went to Paisley Park, it would be focused on the positives,” Bradby said.\n\nPrince may be gone, but his music lives on — and there are promises of more to come from his vault of unreleased music.\n\nFans can rejoice that on June 23, a remastered three-CD set of the “Purple Rain” album will be released. The set will include previously unreleased songs and a DVD of concert footage from a 1985 tour. Even hardcore fans who have bootleg copies of obscure Prince music are excited about the prospects of new releases for years to come."
