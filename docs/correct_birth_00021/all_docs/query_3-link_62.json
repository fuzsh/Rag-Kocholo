        "text": "Minneapolis >> The world learned what it sounds like when doves cry after legendary Minneapolis musician Prince died Thursday morning at his Paisley Park studio in Chanhassen, Minn. The cause of death is under investigation. He was 57.\n\nThe news shocked friends, family and followers of the man born Prince Rogers Nelson, who signed his first record deal as a teenager and went on to become one of the world’s biggest, most influential stars. Through a career that lasted nearly four decades, he blurred racial, sexual and musical lines and sold millions of albums in the process.\n\nReaction ranged from stunned fans who made a pilgrimage in the rain to Paisley Park on Thursday morning all the way to the White House, where President Barack Obama took to Facebook to write: “Today, the world lost a creative icon. Michelle and I join millions of fans from around the world in mourning the sudden death of Prince. Few artists have influenced the sound and trajectory of popular music more distinctly, or touched quite so many people with their talent.”\n\nPrince was found unresponsive in an elevator in his studios about 9:40 a.m. Thursday, the Carver County Sheriff’s Office in Minnesota said. Efforts to revive him failed, and he was pronounced dead at 10:07 a.m.\n\nHe had been suffering from the flu and, while flying back from what were his final live performances in Atlanta on Friday, his plane made in emergency stop in Moline, Ill., where he was rushed to the emergency room, but released after three hours. He seemingly bounced back Saturday and was spotted riding a bicycle around Chanhassen. He also hosted a dance party that night at Paisley Park.\n\n“His music is going to live on and on,” said Mark Bonde, a Minneapolis fan who saw about 160 Prince concerts over the years, most of them at Paisley Park. “This is not something that’s going to fade away. The appreciation is going to go up over time. His catalog is so deep and diverse and amazing, his music will bless generations to come.”\n\nMUSICAL FAMILY\n\nBorn June 7, 1958, in Minneapolis, Prince was named after his father, a jazz pianist and songwriter. Encouraged by his father and mother, a jazz singer, Prince wrote his first song at the age of 7. By the time he was a teenager, Prince was playing in several bands and generating enough buzz to land him a record deal with Warner Bros.\n\nIn late 1977, he recorded his debut album, “For You,” in California. His unique deal with Warner Bros. gave him complete control over his music, and Prince took full advantage of that, carving out a sound that incorporated rock, funk, R&B, soul, gospel, new wave and whatever other genre struck his fancy.\n\nPrince found success with such early singles as “I Wanna Be Your Lover” and “Uptown,” and also turned heads with his flamboyant personal style that was on full display in the cover art for his third album, 1980’s “Dirty Mind.” On it, he wore an intricate, studded jacket over his bare chest and little else beyond heavy makeup, a bandana and bikini-style underwear. His musical genius was already apparent, but Prince also exuded a sense of mystery and danger at the start of the Reagan administration.\n\nIn 1982, Prince landed his first Top 10 album on the Billboard charts with “1999,” a wildly ambitious collection of songs that solidified what would become known as the “Minneapolis Sound” thanks to its hits “Little Red Corvette,” “Delirious” and the anthem-like title track. He was building such a strong audience, it forced MTV to make him one of the first black artists the network put into heavy rotation, alongside Michael Jackson. But that was just the start.\n\nTwo years later, Prince turned his next project, “Purple Rain,” into a multimedia extravaganza, with a hit album, smash singles, feature film and sold-out tour. He didn’t take the easy route, either, as the lead single “When Doves Cry” had Warner Bros. executives sweating with its squealing guitars, harsh electronics and lack of bass. It sounded unlike anything on the radio, yet set the stage for the “Purple Rain” soundtrack to sell 1.5 million copies its first week. It topped the charts in August and stayed there for 24 consecutive weeks. Prince was just 26, but he set a new record by simultaneously claiming the No. 1 album, single and film in the country.\n\nThe success of “Purple Rain” allowed Prince to build Paisley Park and transformed First Avenue, where much of the “Purple Rain” film was shot, from a dingy club into a tourist destination and cultural treasure.\n\nPrince’s muse didn’t stop with own material, either, and he turned musicians such as Sheila E. and the Time into stars, while collaborating with a long line of other artists, including Chaka Khan, Stevie Nicks, the Bangles, Sheena Easton and Madonna.\n\nGrammy Award-winning Minneapolis native Dan Wilson, of Trip Shakespeare and Semisonic, said Prince also served as an example to other local musicians trying to make it in the business.\n\n“I feel like living and making music in Minneapolis when he was ascendant was a giant stroke of luck for me and my friends,” said Wilson, who now lives in Los Angeles. “He stayed in town, made his career and his life in his hometown, and gave us all the crazy idea that we could do that, too. And of course, his personality was endlessly puzzling and fascinating. ‘What makes Prince tick?’ could have been the unofficial title of a hundred conversations between me and my Twin Cities music friends.”\n\nInstead of riding the “Purple Rain” wave, Prince moved on to the next project and released “Around the World in a Day,” an impressionistic, psychedelic rock record that surprised and confounded his fans, not to mention his record label.\n\n“I was trying to say something about looking inside oneself to find perfection,” Prince told Rolling Stone in 1985. “Perfection is in everyone. Nobody’s perfect, but they can be. We may never reach that, but it’s better to strive than not.”\n\nPrince continued to score radio hits with “Raspberry Beret,” “Kiss” and “U Got the Look,” although his later movie projects struggled to find an audience. Undaunted, he released his masterpiece in 1987, the sprawling, epic double album “Sign o’ the Times,” which started as a 22-song opus before the label forced him to edit it to 16 tracks.\n\nHe appeared naked, sprawled across a bed of flowers on 1988’s “Lovesexy” and helped turn the 1989 film “Batman” into a blockbuster with his best-selling soundtrack. But Prince’s ambitions increasingly left him at odds with Warner Bros. The label wanted Prince to slow down his output, and Prince responded by changing his name to an unpronounceable symbol in 1993 and scrawling the word “Slave” across his cheek to protest his label’s attempts to limit his artistic freedom.\n\nAfter a messy few years, Prince terminated his relationship with Warner Bros. and spent the rest of his career releasing albums on his own and through one-off deals with other labels, starting with 1996’s “Emancipation.” All the while, he continued to make his presence felt in the Twin Cities.\n\nProlific Minneapolis musician Jeremy Ylvisaker, who performs in numerous local bands and tours with Andrew Bird, met Prince on stage when Ylvisaker was taking part in a jazz and hip-hop improv night at the Front in the late ‘90s.\n\n“We get word from someone in the crowd that ‘his boss’ wants to come play with us,” Ylvisaker said. “I had no idea what was going on and then there he was. He looked perfect, he had the jewels in his ears. He started playing and burned it down, dancing and spinning around. And then he just left. It was the most intense thing I’ve ever seen.”\n\nA NEW ERA\n\nAt the start of the new century, Prince had converted to the Jehovah’s Witness religion, which was reflected in his controversial 2001 album “The Rainbow Children.” He had largely fallen out of the mainstream spotlight by this time, but solidified his relationship with fans through frequent parties at Paisley Park and a membership-driven website where he shared many unreleased songs from his storied vaults.\n\nBut when the 20-year anniversary of “Purple Rain” rolled around in 2004, Prince jumped right back to the forefront. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and played the Grammy Awards with Beyonce before launching a comeback tour that earned $87.4 million.\n\nThat turned out to be Prince’s final major, traditional tour. He instead turned his concerts into special events, performing residencies in Las Vegas, London and on July 7, 2007, downtown Minneapolis when he played three shows that ended with his return to First Avenue. Prince played the Super Bowl halftime show in 2007 and the Coachella Festival in the California desert the following year. In 2010, Time named him among the most influential people in the world.\n\nIn recent years, Prince began opening Paisley Park once more for last-minute weekend gigs where he sometimes, but not always, performed live. Last year, he announced plans to play a series of solo piano shows in Europe, but postponed them after the terror attacks in Paris.\n\nIn January, he debuted the solo piano concept at Paisley Park during two intimate, autobiographical performances unlike anything he had done in the past. He then took his piano on the road, first to Australia and New Zealand and then on to Oakland, San Francisco, Montreal and Toronto. He postponed performances in Atlanta earlier this month after coming down with the flu. While still ill, he played two shows Friday in Atlanta. During the dance party the following night at Paisley Park, he told the audience he planned to release a live recording from Atlanta, and played a half-hour of it over the loudspeakers.\n\nIn yet another surprise, the famously private Prince announced last month that he was going to write his autobiography. He rarely gave in-depth interviews during his lifetime, leaving many personal details lodged somewhere between fact and legend.\n\nHe married Mayte Garcia in 1996, and they had a son who died a week after he was born due to a rare birth defect. They divorced, and Prince went on to marry Manuela Testolini, from 2001 to 2006.\n\nFormer Fox 9 reporter and anchor Robyne Robinson befriended Prince during his marriage to Garcia. Her on-air piece about Garcia won Prince over, and he asked Robinson to accompany him to the Essence Awards in 1988.\n\n“I had many cool experiences with him,” Robinson said Thursday between tears. “One night, the two of us just watched old ‘Midnight Specials’ together at Paisley Park. He was incredibly generous to me, and I wouldn’t have a career in this town if it wasn’t for him.\n\n“He liberated people’s minds and cared about people and his community. Yes, he was misunderstood and he screwed up sometimes and made people mad. But you can never doubt that what he brought to people’s lives was unmatched. There will never be another Prince, never. We should all celebrate the fact that we got to witness him while he was here.”\n\nDFM reporters Tory Cooney, Sarah Horner and Marino Eccher contributed to this report.
