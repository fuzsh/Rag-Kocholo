        "text": "About\n\nPaisley Park, Prince’s private estate and production complex in Chanhassen, Minnesota offers fans of the late music icon the unprecedented opportunity to tour the legendary 65,000-square-foot complex that served as the center of Prince's creative universe. Tours take visitors throughout the extensive main floor of Paisley Park, including studios where Prince recorded, produced and mixed most of his biggest hits, exhibit spaces that chronicle films such as Purple Rain, Prince's private NPG Music Club, and a massive soundstage and concert hall where Prince rehearsed for concert tours and held exclusive private events and concerts. Visitors can see artifacts from Prince's personal archives, including iconic concert wardrobe & memorabilia, awards, musical instruments, artwork, rare music and video recordings and motorcycles. Prince sold over 100 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling artists of all time. He won seven GRAMMY Awards, a Golden Globe Award, and an Academy Award for the film Purple Rain, all of which are displayed at Paisley Park. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004, the first year of his eligibility. Prince was born in Minneapolis and resided in the Minneapolis area throughout his life.\n\nIt is highly encouraged to purchase tickets online prior to arrival. Due to high demand, in-person ticket purchases may not be available. Unless otherwise notified, all parking is on-site at Paisley Park. You will be admitted through the gates 20 minutes prior to the start of your tour. Parking is free."
