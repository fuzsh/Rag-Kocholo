        "text": "MINNEAPOLIS — The new musical based on Prince’s breakthrough film and album “Purple Rain” will have its world premiere at Minneapolis’ State Theatre in the spring of 2025, producer Orin Wolf announced Tuesday.\n\nProduction dates and additional details will be announced in the coming weeks.\n\n“Prince talked about adapting ‘Purple Rain’ for the stage for years. It’s only fitting that we launch this world premiere musical version in the city where it all began, Prince’s hometown, Minneapolis,” former Prince manager L. Londell McMillan and Primary Wave Music CEO Larry Mestel said in a news release. “We’re very excited for the creative team to be inspired by the Minneapolis sound and the unparalleled and unique spirit of the city that Prince inspired.”\n\nWhen “Purple Rain” hit radio and movie screens in 1984, Prince had already established himself with hits like “1999,” “Little Red Corvette” and “Delirious.” But “Purple Rain” firmly established him as a worldwide superstar.\n\nThe soundtrack album became Prince’s first chart-topper on the Billboard 200 and went on to spend 24 consecutive weeks at No. 1. It has sold more than 25 million albums worldwide. Prince closed out the year by playing five sold-out shows at the former St. Paul Civic Center.\n\nConsidered semi-autobiographical and shot at First Avenue and in and around Minneapolis, the “Purple Rain” film grossed $70.3 million worldwide against its $7.2 million budget and won an Oscar for best original song score. In 2019, the Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being “culturally, historically or aesthetically significant.”\n\nAs previously announced, the stage adaptation will feature a book by two-time Pulitzer Prize finalist and MacArthur Foundation “genius” grant winner Branden Jacobs-Jenkins (“Appropriate”), based on the original screenplay by Albert Magnoli and William Blinn.\n\nTony Award-nominee Lileana Blain-Cruz (“The Skin of Our Teeth”) will direct."
