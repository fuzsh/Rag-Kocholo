        "text": "His New York City connection\n\nPrince may be from Minnesota, but he got his big break in the Big Apple.\n\nWanting to make it in the music biz, he set off for New York City as a teenager — eventually scoring a record deal with Warner Bros. at age 18.\n\nIn a candid interview with The Post in 1985, Prince (shown visiting New York City in 1988) described what motivated him to be such a talented — and sexually charged — musician.\n\n“There is a reason I’m doing these songs,” he said. “I’m coming to grips with myself and I want to tell the truth.”\n\nReligion\n\nDespite his raunchy reputation, Prince was a conservative Christian who once went door to door proselytizing on behalf of the Jehovah’s Witnesses.\n\nThe Minneapolis-born bad boy converted to Jehovah in 2001 and later, in an interview with the New Yorker, he described reactions he got spreading the good word.\n\n“Sometimes people act surprised,” he said in 2008. “But mostly, they’re really cool about it.”\n\nThe symbol\n\nOne of the uber-eccentric singer’s most bizarre moments occurred in 1993, when he changed his name to this unpronounceable symbol.\n\nFor six years, the legendary guitarist referred to himself as the indecipherable glyph that unified the male and female symbols into the image.\n\nThe move stemmed from a dispute with his rec­ord label, Warner Bros. — and he was referred to as the “Artist Formerly Known as Prince.”\n\nHis publicist at the time, Garvey Rich, told The Post that the change had reporters and p.r. agents pulling their hair out.\n\n“Only Prince could make news by changing his name to a symbol which literally forced the news wires to upgrade their systems to insert the graphic symbol into their text feeds,” Rich said.\n\nPrince went back to his old moniker in May 1999 — after his publishing contract with Warner Bros. ended.\n\nThe hoopster\n\nHe pranced around in high heels on stage, but on the basketball court, he was all business.\n\nA newspaper article posted online by the Minneapolis Star Tribune features a photo of the 5-foot-2 musician posing with his high school basketball team and outlines his career on the court.\n\n“Though music was his calling, Prince mostly hung around with the jocks at Bryant Junior High and Central High,” it reads. “He was good enough as a freshman to make the Central junior varsity basketball team.”\n\nIn 2004, Comedy Central aired a sketch on “Chappelle’s Show” that featured comic Charlie Murphy recalling a time when he and his friends got slaughtered by Prince and The Revolution in a game of pickup basketball — and how the singer grilled them all pancakes afterward.\n\nIn his prime\n\nThe release of “Purple Rain” in 1984 was the pinnacle of Prince’s career and started his reign as one of music’s most eccentric style icons — as he donned a purple trench coat and demanded that no one else wear his signature color.\n\n“He was the only one who could wear purple,” designer Cynthia Vargas Sieloff said. “I had to dress his band and The Time [his opening act] in other colors.”\n\nWhile she was making the star’s trench coat, she discovered she had only plaid. So Prince flew her from Minnesota to Los Angeles, where she purchased $10,000 of purple material in which to dress him.\n\nShe also made the glove that Prince wore for a picture that adorned the album, which featured hits like “When Doves Cry,” “Let’s Go Crazy” and “Purple Rain.”\n\nHis father and family\n\nBorn the son of a half-black, half-Italian jazz-band leader and a female vocalist, Prince was one of the most naturally gifted musicians of all time.\n\nHis father, John Nelson, met his mother, Mattie Della Shaw, in 1956 at a show in Minneapolis. Shaw went on to become the singer in Nelson’s band.\n\nWhen Nelson divorced Shaw and moved out, he left behind his piano — sowing the seeds for Prince’s love of music. At age 7, Prince taught himself to tickle the ivories, and the rest is history.\n\nBoozer\n\nThe rocker rented a West Hollywood mansion from Chicago Bulls player Carlos Boozer in 2004, then did a slew of Prince-style renovations to the home — and wound up paying the NBA star $1 million to smooth things over.\n\nPrince installed a new front gate with his inimitable symbol, turned the master bedroom into a hair salon and ran purple water through the estate’s fountains.\n\nHe then slipped the Bull a cool mil to undo the renovations.\n\nRoller skating\n\nPrince was an avid roller skater who owned a mesmerizing pair of light-up skates and threw rink parties for celebs.\n\nQuestlove, the drummer for and leader of The Roots, recalled in his book, “Mo’ Meta Blues,” that Prince invited him to a skating party “in the middle of nowhere” with a few pals.\n\nAfter about an hour, Questlove saw Prince arrive carrying a briefcase. “He clicked the lock and opened it, and took out the strangest, most singu­lar pair of roller skates I had ever seen,” Questlove said. “They were clear skates that lit up, and the wheels sent a multicolored spark trail into your path.”"
