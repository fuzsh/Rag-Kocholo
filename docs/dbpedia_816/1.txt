Miss Universe 1990, the 39th Miss Universe pageant was held at Shubert Theatre, Los Angeles, USA on April 15, 1990. Mona Grudt of Norway was crowned as Miss Universe 1990. Seventy-one contestants competed for the crown.

For the first time, the judges' individual scores were visible to the viewing audience, adding transparency to the pageant. Also in this year, a major format change that transformed the Miss Universe competition for the next decade was introduced, in which the delegates would face an extra round of elimination on finals night: the Top 6 judges' questions.

In the Parade of Nations, television viewers got to see each delegate in national costume, as well as her swimsuit, evening gown and interview preliminary scores for the first time. Host Dick Clark also called out each country individually, as compared to the 1980s where all the delegates introduced themselves in rapid succession. This format of Parade of Nations continued until 1997. The presentation of the delegates in continental order, introduced in 1989, also continued until 1997.

Also, instead of reducing the Top 10 to the usual Final 5, the judges picked a momentary Top 6. Those 6 finalists would answer questions and the field was reduced to a Final 3 who would face the traditional final question. This format was discontinued in 2001.

Note: The scores shown during the Parade of Nations were miscategorized later on in the telecast, creating confusion. The Top 3 Preliminary Interview Scores were labeled as Preliminary Swimsuit scores. Similarly, the Top 3 Swimsuit scores were miscategorized as Preliminary Evening Gown scores, a mistake that would not be repeated the following year.
