        "text": "DONALD Trump’s launch party for the next Miss USA Pageant was held at the trendy downtown nightspot Life, and there wasn’t a single Big Hairdo or garish ballgown in sight. Instead, a tide of black-clad hipsters flowed around the lovely Miss New York and 11 of her equally gorgeous colleagues, each of them sleekly wrapped in fluorescent Lycra courtesy of Max Azria and BCBG.\n\nSomething big has changed in the world of the beauty pageant – that peculiar, ostensibly antiquated institution that has mysteriously survived the onset of feminism. The three key pageants – Miss Universe, Miss USA and Miss Teen USA, all of them run by the Miss Universe Organization – have become slick and chic and even hip. (These three are separate from the Miss America Pageant, a not-for-profit event that provides scholarships.)\n\nAt the Miss Universe Pageant in Hawaii last year, all the contestants wore little black dresses by Betsey Johnson in the opening number. Later, Miss Russia wore Prada, Miss Japan wore a $15,000 Dior gown by John Galliano and Miss Trinidad and Tobago won the title in a white Badgley Mischka.\n\nTommy Hilfiger now sponsors Miss Teen USA. The judges are now cutting-edge folk like Russell Simmons, the rap entrepreneur. And as part of the ongoing redefinition of the Miss Universe brand, the company has just secured ultra-hot Nine West as footwear sponsor for the Miss USA contest.\n\nThe transformation from an embarrassing, tacky orgy of small-town corn and cheese has been masterminded by a New York woman handpicked by The Donald two years ago – at the age of only 26 – to do just that. And she’s done it together with an aggressive all-woman team of managers and marketers.\n\nThe revolutionary in question is Maureen Reidy, a certified public accountant and president of the Miss Universe Organization. (Her boss calls her ‘the most beautiful accountant in the world.”) It’s the first time in half a century that the Miss Universe Organization is not run by men.\n\nAnd if beauty pageants can be made relevant and contemporary in some post-feminist way, then Maureen Reidy is determined to do it. After all, she says, ‘Miss Universe is about the young woman of today who works, and I am that.” And thanks to her, in little more than a year the shows have gone from prom dresses to couture.\n\nReidy met Trump by chance at a fund-raiser in the mid-1990s. When she told him that she crunched numbers for a living, he said, ‘An accountant? Get the hell out of here!”\n\nReidy thought she might be about to snag a sexy new client for her employers, the vast Price Waterhouse company. But Trump wanted her for his own organization. And although Price Waterhouse was about to put her through Columbia Business School on full salary, the Trump temptation was too great.\n\n‘Look,” Reidy says, ‘he’s the master of the deal, and every day I learn something from him – more than I could ever learn doing an MBA.”\n\nSoon she was helping Trump turn his Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, into a private club and performing due diligence for Trump’s acquisitions. Then one day Trump came to her with some financial statements in hand and asked her to do an initial evaluation of the Miss Universe Organization.\n\n‘Donald had spotted what he suspected was a sleeper, and he was interested in it because [then-Mrs. Trump] Marla Maples had hosted Miss Universe in Las Vegas in 1996,” the accountant says. What Reidy saw was a dated, decaying brand, based in Los Angeles but owned by Madison Square Garden, which had inherited it through the Viacom-Paramount merger.\n\nOn the other hand, the property had ‘an internationally known trademark and three live, prime-time, major network television specials seen in 75 countries.” Trump bought the company, flipped half of it to CBS, and then set about finding someone to run it.\n\nBecause Reidy had done the due diligence, she sat in on the interviews. She felt strongly that the company could be a gold mine, but only if the whole concept was reinvented ‘to make it more in tune with women today. It had to be made into a hip, contemporary, cutting-edge entertainment property.”\n\nShe made the point so forcefully that, after one of the interviews, Trump turned to her and said, ‘Well, you know what, why don’t you run the company, then?”\n\nIf that sounds implausible, recall that Trump himself started buying hotels while in his early 20s, and, as he says, ‘She’s young, she’s beautiful, she’s intelligent and that’s a rare combination. And she has added flavor and flair to the whole enterprise.”\n\nWorking with Molly Miles, the organization’s CEO, the newly appointed President Reidy then set about propelling Miss Universe into the 21st century. First of all, she decided, ‘I need a good-looking show, which means getting hold of an A-list Hollywood team – the same people who produce the Oscars, the VH-1 Fashion Awards, etc.”\n\nThen there was the question of style. ‘A third of the show is taken up by the evening-gown competition. You know how with the Oscars everyone talks about who’s wearing what? Well, at the Miss Universe award it should be a scandal if Miss Italy turns out in anything but Versace,” she says.\n\nReidy hired Hollywood’s premier fashion stylist, Philip Bloch, and explained to the various fashion houses that the Miss Universe show is seen by more than a billion people.\n\n‘No one had really thought of it before, but these pageants are a publicist’s dream. Look at the exposure you can get.”\n\nReidy was born in Smithtown, L.I. Her father is a New York City firefighter (‘Engine 302 and Ladder Company 155 in Jamaica, Queens”) and her mother is a math teacher at Sachem, the same high school she attended. Of Irish and Italian extraction, she was a typical Long Island girl of her generation: ‘I had big hair and I rode around in a Camaro.”\n\nShe attended the University of Maryland, where she was a business major and captain of the cheerleading squad, and where she dated a pro football player she prefers not to name.\n\nAn accounting specialist, she was hired out of school by Price Waterhouse. She joined the entertainment group and worked on projects such as the acquisition of CBS by Westinghouse. ‘But,” she confides, ‘my first job at Price Waterhouse was counting ballots at the MTV Awards, locked in a room with some secure fax machines!”\n\nReidy has dark hair and flashing dark eyes and gestures frequently. She consumes coffee and Diet Coke in large quantities. She poached her vice president for marketing, Maureen Murray Quinn – a former Miss New York – from the International Management Group.\n\nReidy bridles at the way people sometimes stereotype her contestants as bimbos. ‘Last year we had four M.D.s and a couple of lawyers and some journalists doing the competition,” she says.\n\nAbroad, being Miss Universe can be an extraordinary launching pad. Irene Saez, the 1981 winner, was a presidential candidate in her native Venezuela and is in her second term as the mayor of Chacao. Another Venezuelan Miss Universe, Barbara Palacios Teyde, who won the title in 1986, is both a popular talk-show host and a former minister for tourism.\n\nReidy has made it part of the mission statement of Miss Universe to help the winners and contestants in their career goals.\n\nAnd, as she points out, many of her innovations are designed to make sure that the contestants really do get a chance to make it in the industries that appeal to them. ‘It’s all about access,” she says. ‘It’s up to them to take advantage of it.”"
