But this is not meant to be a comprehensive list. If a station is deemed worthy of inclusion by most\n\ncable outlets, it will appear here...but with its complete history based strictly on its over-the-air vitae\n\nDesignations for low-power (LPTV) and stations utilizing repeaters or translators to simulcast elsewhere are usually not mentioned\n\nwithin a station's details, unless there is some historical relevance. Same for digital subchannels. Also, digital channel designations\n\n(enacted in 2009) will likely differ from stations' original analog designations, but for clarity's sake, channels will be identified\n\nand organized here by their common (former) analog number. Local and national streaming-only channels have been deleted\n\nor are not provided here, due to their typically constant and untrackable/undocumented changes and insignificant viewership.\n\n.\n\nABBREVIATIONS GUIDE\n\nSM: Station Manager (the similar \"Sales Manager\" will always be spelled out to eliminate confusion.) GM: General Manager.\n\nPD: Program Director. ND: News Director. PM: Program Manager. MD: Music Director. CE: Chief Engineer. VP: Vice-President.\n\nAKA: \"Also Known As.\" LMA: Local Marketing Agreement, where a third party leases most or all of a station's airtime to\n\nbroadcast its own format or simulcast. LPTV: Low-power TV station, meant to serve a limited segment of a community.\n\nRoman numerals in parentheses [\"(I)\" or \"(II)\" etc] next to a name denote another person (not related or directly connected)\n\nusing the same moniker (or coincidentally sharing the same name) within the north Texas market\n\nFIRST...A BRIEF, GENERAL HISTORY OF\n\nTELEVISION IN DALLAS-FT WORTH:\n\nTruett Kimzey displays the first television\n\nbroadcasting setup in North Texas, 1934\n\n.\n\nThe first television experiment in North Texas was conducted by station W5AGO. It was assembled by engineer Truett Kimzey (who later started Greenville TX radio station KGVL,) and, in March, 1934, his $1,500 worth of TV equipment was put on display for viewing at the Fort Worth Stock Show (a video signal was sent there from Kimzey's TV studios at Downtown Fort Worth's Commercial Standard Building.) Unfortunately, the crude equipment was soon outdated, as the FCC was still hammering out industry standards for technology that wouldn't be in wide use for another 20 years...and the Southwest wouldn't see television again until the late 1940s.\n\nSeptember 29, 1948 brought regular television broadcasting to the airwaves of the Metroplex when Fort Worth's WBAP-TV signed on. The very next day, the FCC froze all TV applications until they could sort out standards and procedures for the quickly-evolving medium. Applicants who had already received construction permits (CPs) could go ahead and build, however, or one could purchase an existing station to get into the TV business (as did the Belo Corporation with Channel 8.) Although the freeze was lifted on 4/14/1952, the DFW area did not see a new station established until KFJZ-Channel 11 in 1955.\n\nDuring the past 75 years, North Texas viewers have seen television evolve from humble beginnings, with four channels filled with mostly local programming in the 1950s, to 'colorcasting' and six local channels in the 1960s, to the news sensationalism and ratings battles of the 1970s, to the introduction of cable TV to the masses in the 1980s, to a major reshuffling of network affiliations in the 1990s, to watching the advent of HDTV and digital unfold and gain traction in the 21st century.\n\nRETURNING TO THE SITE EVENTUALLY:\n\n\"DFW Television Memories\"\n\nSTATIONS: 2\n\n.\n\n.\n\nKDTN, Denton. Station established 9/1/1988. PBS affiliate. Call letters initially stood for \"Denton;\" after ownership change, they were said to stand for DaystarTelevision Network (a backronym.) Nickname: \"TV 2 and You.\" Owner: Marcus and Joni Lamb dba Daystar (starting 1/13/2004,) North Texas Public Broadcasting (NTPB)/KERA (9/1/1988-1/13/2004.) Public broadcasting/educational programming (to 2004,) religious (started 2004.) Daystar sold KMPX-Channel 29 to purchase KDTN. Was sister station to KERA-TV and KERA-FM; KERA first expressed interest in the dormant frequency in 5/1977, but it would be more than 11 years later before KERA obtained FCC approval and signed on the air. Referred to as \"KERA 2\" in the early 2000s, although no official change in calls was made. Channel 2 was officially allotted as an educational station for Denton in 1952. Right before NTPB relinquished control to Daystar, the station played a marathon of every episode of PBS's \"Upstairs Downstairs.\"\n\nKDNT, Denton. Station applied for in 1958 by Harwell V. Shepard, owner of KDNT-AM/FM, but others insisted to the FCC that Channel 2 remain designated as a future educational station instead. Shepard's application was denied.\n\nKIXL, Dallas. Station applied for in 1948 but never went on the air. Owner: Lee Segall. To have been sister to KIXL-AM/FM. By the time the television license freeze was lifted in 1952, Channel 2 had been reassigned to Denton and as an educational station.\n\n3\n\n\"Showbiz\" subscription/pay TV service. Established 1981. Owner: Digital Paging Systems of Texas d/b/a MovieVision; later owned by Graphic Scanning Inc. Notable: Dick Morrison. Like ONTV and VUE, Showbiz offered first-run movies and soft-porn features on a subscription basis, broadcasting directly by microwave to \"yagi\" antennas mounted on the roof of subscribers homes. But, unlike ONTV and VEU, the company did not lease evening and nighttime hours on a local, over-the-air UHF station. Parent company MovieVision offered cable TV-style programming in select markets, catering mainly to multi-family complexes, but not delivered with a conventional cable setup (i. e. Warner-Amex \"QUBE,\" who held the sole rights as the dedicated franchise to provide cable TV in the city of Dallas.)\n\n.\n\n4\n\n.\n\nKDFW, Dallas. Call letters established 7/2/1970.

Station located at 3900 Barnett on \"Broadcast Hill\" in Fort Worth.\n\nMISC TIDBITS:\n\nWhen area cable provider Telecable threatened to drop KXAS from its channel lineup in 1993, Channel 5 fought back by airing commercials urging subscribers to fight back with calls and letters. Telecable finally relented. This attempt to 'bully back' cable providers over proposed licensing rate increases was the first to be seen in the market.\n\nKXAS was the original contender for switching to a CBS affiliate when KDFW first announced their defection to Fox in 1994.\n\nChannel 5 was notorious in the 1970s and 80s for rearranging their NBC daytime schedule to fit their wants. One day's programming would be taped from the NBC feed, then individual shows would be shown in a different order the following day. This wreaked havoc on soap watchers, who would get the typical Friday climax show on Monday instead. KXAS also shortened \"The Tonight Show\" by 30 minutes, much to Johnny Carson's chagrin. He verbally blasted the station on his program in early 1978 for doing so, as the only NBC affiliate in the nation who trimmed back his show.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nWBAP, Fort Worth.

The studios were still under construction at the time, and Channel 5 endured a 17-minute power outage in the middle of their inaugural programming (not the station's fault, but angry viewers blamed them nonetheless!)\n\nAlso, in WBAP's early days, viewers didn't fully understand the concept of television...one viewer called WBAP on the first night of telecasting, complaining that she was not receiving any picture. The receptionist asked, \"What kind of set are you using?\" The viewer responded, \"Why, my RADIO set, of course!\" Others thought that TV was a utility, like electricity or water, and that you called the TV station to come fix it if it broke!\n\nThe late Frank Mills, the first broadcaster to ever appear on WBAP-TV, was hired at sister stations WBAP-AM/KGKO-AM in 1936. He and friend Ronald Reagan were en route to Hollywood to try their hand at acting. Passing through Fort Worth, Mills found out that WBAP was hiring, and opted to stay for the sure thing and not risk finding no work on the coast (it didnt hurt that Mills girlfriend lived in nearby Wichita Falls!) Reagan went on to California alone, and the rest is history! (Contributed by Ward Andrews)\n\nKCPN, Fort Worth.

Station originally located at Harry Hines and Wolf Street, north of downtown (current home of KERA-TV;) moved to state-of-the-art facility, \"Communications Center,\" 606 Young Street, on 4/2/1961.\n\nTRIVIA TIDBITS:\n\nUnder GM Mike Shapiro, WFAA felt a responsibility to pre-empt any network programming that didn't fit their opinion of moral standards. Racy and risque movies were commonly pulled from the schedule, and, in one instance where Channel 8 let one slip by, an apology announcement by the station was made afterwards, with the assurance that the program would never air on WFAA again. Even \"American Bandstand\" was pre-empted by Channel 8 for many years starting around 1970; the official reason was for the station to air pertinent public service programming instead, but rumors long abounded that the station buckled to religious groups who wanted 'evil' rock and roll off local television.\n\nChannel 8's success since the mid-1970s is attributed to \"The Oklahoma Mafia,\" the nickname given to a group of star reporters that ND Marty Haag brought down from his former station in Oklahoma City in late 1973: Tracy Rowlett, Doug Fox and Byron Harris. Mike Miller was also recruited for the same team from KTUL-TV in Tulsa.\n\nCalled in for emergency duty when a killer tornado swept across Oak Cliff, west and northwest Dallas on April 2, 1957, Channel 8 staffers responded with incredible live coverage of the event. This was perhaps the biggest story local news had covered since TV had signed on in the area. Contributing their skills in the field were Jim Gibbs (news director,) cameramen Mal Couch, Forrest Moore, Jim Goodwin, John Starr and Marion Carlton. Reporting in the studio were Pete Hott and Bob Tripp, along with Joe Templeton, Don Norman and Dean Duerkson. The crew, using WFAA's \"Newsmobile,\" stayed within 300 feet behind the tornado as it trekked across the city. The coverage was combined into a half-hour documentary entitled, \"Disaster...Dallas,\" and shown several times on the station beginning April 4, 1957. The filmwork received the top national award for excellence by the Radio -Television News Directors Association (RTNDA.)\n\nCostliest move: Belo management attended an RCA/NBC affiliate meeting in 1946, along with WBAP radio executives. Aside from threatening their affiliates with a loss of affiliation if they did not apply for FM licenses, both television and facsimile-delivered newspaper technology were introduced...affiliates could choose whichever idea they thought would be the most successful. WBAP chose television, and WFAA chose facsimile. After facsimile technology didn't take off, WFAA was forced to enter the TV market late...their application for Channel 12 was denied, and it cost them $1 million to purchase KBTV from Tom Potter! As the FCC had TV license issuance in a freeze mode from 1948-1952, an existing station had to be purchased just to get into the TV business.\n\nAnd in 1974, former state senator Jim Wade tried to get the FCC to strip WFAA of its license and award it to him!\n\n.\n\nKBTV, Dallas.

On 10/23/1944, Dallas business magnate Karl Hoblitzelle dba Interstate Circuit (Theatres) applied for the Channel 8 license, beating WBAP to the punch as the first local TV applicant by a matter of weeks. The station was to be based at downtown's Republic Bank building, and Hoblitzelle even conducted a closed-circuit TV broadcast of the opening of his new Wilshire Theatre.

The station returned to the air for another week before signing off for good on September 5 (apparently the FCC reconsidered their decision, as station manager Bob Weatherford told the media that they would return in three months, on December 1. It didn't happen.) When the station failed to sell in the fall of 1969, the equipment was hauled away and the license was sent back for cancellation. KFWT then filed bankruptcy on 3/27/1970.

Simply put, we should create the news, not just respond to it.' In other conversations, Schonbak said, 'Let's dig up some white collar dirt' and 'Give me five Sam Donaldsons who don't care who they offend,' and 'This city is so smug in its so-called virtue...no city can be that good...let's get the big boys.'

For example, the radoi call letters \"KFJZ\" were not originally chosen to stand for \"Fort Worth Jazz;\" this was a phrase designed way after the fact to fit the old call letters.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS OF USE\n\nThis entire website and its contents are copyright 1984-2024 Mike Shannon.
