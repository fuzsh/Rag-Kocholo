        "text": "Annual international beauty pageant competition\n\n\"MUO\" redirects here. For other uses, see MUO (disambiguation).\n\nFor the most recent competition, see Miss Universe 2023. For the upcoming competition, see Miss Universe 2024. For the Nilüfer Yanya album, see Miss Universe (album).\n\nMiss Universe is an annual international major beauty pageant that is run by a Thailand and Mexican-based Miss Universe Organization.[1] Along with Miss World, Miss International, and Miss Earth, it is one of the Big Four beauty pageants.[2]\n\nThe Miss Universe Organization and its brand, is currently owned by JKN Global Group and Legacy Holding Group USA Inc., an American division of Mexican company Legacy Holding through the joint venture company JKN Legacy Inc.[3] Telemundo has the licensing rights to air the pageant through 2023.[4] The pageant's advocacy is \"humanitarian issues and is a voice to affect positive change in the world.\"[5][6]\n\nThe current Miss Universe is Sheynnis Palacios of Nicaragua who was crowned on November 18, 2023 in San Salvador, El Salvador.\n\nHistory\n\nThe title \"Miss Universe\" was first used by the International Pageant of Pulchritude in 1926. This contest was held annually until 1935, when the Great Depression and other events preceding World War II led to its demise.\n\nThe current Miss Universe pageant was founded in 1952 by Pacific Knitting Mills, a California-based clothing company and manufacturer of Catalina Swimwear, and has since been headquartered in the United States. The company was the sponsor of the Miss America pageant until 1951, when the winner, Yolande Betbeze, refused to pose for publicity pictures wearing one of their swimsuits. In 1952, Pacific Knitting Mills organized the Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants, co-sponsoring them for decades to follow.[7]\n\nThe first Miss Universe Pageant was held in Long Beach, California in 1952. It was won by Armi Kuusela from Finland, who gave up her title, though not officially, to get married shortly before her year was completed.[8] Until 1958, the Miss Universe title, like that of Miss America, was dated by the year following the contest, so at the time uusela's title was Miss Universe 1953. Since its founding by Pacific Mills, the pageant has been organized and conducted by the Miss Universe Organization. Eventually, Pacific Mills and its subsidiaries were acquired by the Kayser-Roth Corporation.[9]\n\nThe pageant was first televised in 1955. CBS began broadcasting the combined Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants in 1960, and as separate contests in 1965. Eventually, Gulf and Western Industries bought the Kayser-Roth Corporation in 1975 which also acquired the Miss Universe pageant until 1991 when it was bought by Procter & Gamble.[9]\n\nIn 1996, Donald Trump bought the pageant from ITT Corp, with a broadcasting arrangement with CBS until 2002.[10] During this time, in 1998, Miss Universe, Inc. changed its name to the Miss Universe Organization, and moved its headquarters from Los Angeles to New York City.[11][12] By late 2002, Trump entered into a joint venture with NBC,[1][13] which in 2003 outbid the other markets for the TV rights.[14] From 2003 to 2014, the pageant was broadcast in the United States on NBC.\n\nIn June 2015, NBC cancelled all business relationships with Trump and the Miss Universe Organization in response to controversial statements about illegal immigrants who crossed the border from Mexico.[15][16] As part of the legal settlement, in September 2015, Trump bought out NBC's 50% stake in the company, making him the company's sole owner. Three days later, he sold the whole company to WME/IMG.[17][18] Following the change of ownership, in October 2015, Fox and Azteca became the official broadcasters of the Miss Universe and Miss USA pageants.[19] The broadcast rights to the Miss Universe Pageant was temporarily split between Telemundo and FYI during the 2020 pageant. amidst COVID-19 pandemic restrictions at the time. The contract with Fox and then-emcee Steve Harvey was resumed for the 2021 edition.\n\nOn October 26, 2022, Thailand-based JKN Global Group acquired Miss Universe Organization (MUO) from Endeavor Group Holdings-owned IMG Worldwide at $14 million, making Anne Jakapong Jakrajutatip the first transgender woman to own the organization and marking the first time the organization expands its headquarters outside the U.S. From the 2022 edition onwards, NBC has re-acquired broadcast rights via The Roku Channel for the competition as a result of the ownership changes, marking the first time in Miss Universe history that the pageant has transitioned from traditional broadcast network coverage to full streaming service in the United States.[20]\n\nOn November 16, 2023, Paula Shugart, president of the Miss Universe Organization, announced her departure from the Miss Universe Organization.[21] The aforementioned position will not be replaced.[21] Following the departure of Shugart, CEO of the Miss Universe Organization Amy Emmerich also announced her departure on 8 February 2024 and will be leaving the organization on 1 March 2024.[22]\n\nContestant selection\n\nTo gain participation in Miss Universe, a country needs a local company or person to buy the local rights of the competition through a franchise fee. The fee includes the rights of image, brand and everything related to the pageant. Often the owner of the franchise returns the franchise to the Miss Universe Organization, which resells it to a new stakeholder. The reselling of the franchise from one owner to the next is recurrently common in the history of the event, sometimes for contractual breaches or financial reasons. The number of participants fluctuates annually because of the franchising of the pageant paired with conflicting schedules to the regular calendar, but has steadied above 70 countries since 1989.\n\nUsually a country's candidate selection involves pageants in the nation's local subdivisions, where local winners compete in a national pageant, but there are some countries who opt for an internal selection. For example, from 2000 to 2004, Australian delegates were chosen by a modeling agency. Although such \"castings\" are generally discouraged by the Miss Universe Organization, Jennifer Hawkins was chosen to represent the country in Miss Universe in 2004 (where she would eventually win the crown). Australia would eventually reinstate its national pageant for Miss Universe from 2005 onwards.\n\nRecent countries that debuted in the pageant include Bhutan (2022) and Pakistan (2023). Pakistan is the latest newcomer and the most recent country to obtain its first ever semifinal placement at Miss Universe, after debuting in 2023 as a semifinalist in the Top 20.\n\nThere have been widespread speculations regarding Saudi Arabia's potential entry into the Miss Universe pageant. However, the Miss Universe Organization has officially denied these claims and dispelled any rumors regarding Saudi Arabia's participation in the contest. [23]\n\nMeanwhile, Botswana remains the most recent first-time entry to ever win Miss Universe on its debut year (with Mpule Kwelagobe in 1999), and Nicaragua is the most recent country to obtain its first ever national win in Miss Universe (with Sheynnis Palacios in 2023).\n\nCultural barriers, particularly with the swimsuit competition, and the prohibitive franchise fees of the event have prevented some countries like Mozambique from participating. Nevertheless, the Miss Universe Pageant has historically proven popular in regions like the Americas, Africa and Asia, especially in countries like United States, Philippines, Colombia, Brazil, Venezuela, South Africa, Thailand and Indonesia, given their successful track record of multiple semifinal appearances in the last decade and combined multiple titles in the competition's history. As of 2024, only two countries have been present at every Miss Universe since its inception in 1952: Canada and France.\n\nSince 2012, openly transgender women have been allowed to compete as long as they won their national pageants.[24] Six years after this rule went into effect, Angela Ponce of Spain became the first openly transgender candidate to compete in the contest, in the 2018[25] edition. In 2019, Myanmar's Swe Zin Htet became the first openly lesbian woman to compete in Miss Universe. Spain's Patricia Yurena Rodríguez is currently the highest-placed LGBT member at Miss Universe, placing second to Venezuela's Gabriela Isler in 2013, but did not come out until years after the competition.[26][27][28] In 2021, the Philippines' Beatrice Gomez became the first openly bisexual (and LGBT) contestant to enter the Miss Universe semifinals, after finishing as a finalist in the Top 5 that year. In 2023, Portugal's Marina Machete became the first transgender contestant to enter the Miss Universe semifinals, after finishing as a semifinalist in the Top 20.\n\nPreviously, official rules had stated that pageant contestants, \"must not have ever been married, not had a marriage annulled nor given birth to, or parented a child. The titleholders are also required to remain unmarried throughout their reign.\"[29][30] However, in August 2022, the Miss Universe Organization announced that mothers, married, or pregnant women are eligible to compete in the pageant.[31] The new rule has been instituted since 2023. Accepting married contestants reinvigorates tension between the American-based Miss Universe pageant and the European-based Mrs. Universe pageant, which was previously the only avenue for married women to compete for the Universe title. Later that same year, Colombia's Camila Avella became the first candidate to become a mother before clinching a semifinal placement at Miss Universe, after finishing as a finalist in the Top 5.\n\nMoreover, Miss Universe has always strictly prohibited age fabrication. While the pageant's minimum age limit has been set at 18 years old, this presents a problem for several European countries that allow 17-year-old contestants to compete in their pageants. National titleholders under 18 years of age must be replaced by their runner-up or another candidate in the main pageant. In recent years, all Miss Universe candidates have been required to be at least university degree holders or working professionals from the onset of their national pageants. In September 2023, R'Bonney Gabriel announced that the organization would be dropping the upper age limit. Previously, contestants had to be between 18 and 28 years old by the start of the pageant. Beginning in 2024, \"every adult woman in the world will be eligible to compete to be Miss Universe.\"[32]\n\nMain pageant\n\nFor full list and details, see List of Miss Universe editions.\n\nThroughout the history of Miss Universe, the main pageant has varied widely in terms of annual scheduling. In the last decade, the Miss Universe competition has been consistently held over a two-week period between early November and late January. Because of television schedule demands (largely as a result of international time zone differences) or conflicting national events happening during the organizing process (such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the Olympics, FIFA World Cup and national elections depending on the hosting country), four editions have been postponed to next year (as with the 2014, 2016, 2020, and 2022 editions). Since the 2022 edition held in New Orleans, United States during the 2023 calendar year, the Miss Universe Organization has regularly announced the hosting nation of the immediate next edition during the live coronation night. The next edition is scheduled for 2024 in Mexico. Between the early 1970s through the late 2000s, the pageant spans a full month (typically between March and June) to allow time for rehearsals, appearances, and the preliminary competition, with the winner being crowned by the previous year's titleholder during the final competition.\n\nAccording to the organizers, the Miss Universe contest is more than a beauty pageant, though they are expected to participate in swimsuit and evening gown competitions. Women aspiring to become Miss Universe must be intelligent, well-mannered, and cultured. If a candidate is unable to perform well during each round, she is often eliminated. Normally, the placements of the candidates are determined by a ranked vote, where each judge ranks each of the candidates individually and within the stipulated rules. In the past, the pageant semifinalists were chosen on a round robin system. Between 2017 and 2019, the semifinalists were selected based on highest scores per continental group followed by the judging panel's wildcard list along an extra candidate chosen in popular choice. All preliminary results were reset and a new competition starts with the highest placed positions at the semifinals. From 2020 onwards, the round robin system was reinstated where in each round of the grand final, the group of candidates with the lowest rates are progressively eliminated. However, this criterion has been modified to use weighted averages or with points accumulated by stages from the preliminary competition to coronation night, with the assessment in ascending or descending order. From 2011 to 2014, 2016, 2020 and since 2022, the public can also select another semifinalist via fan-voting. Since the pageant's inception, all semifinalists are announced at the beginning of the live telecast regardless of the edition's format and if ties occur in the final rounds, the preliminary results are used.\n\nThe winner then signs a contract with the Miss Universe Organization that can last at least seven months to more than a full year as per demands of the Miss Universe Organization. The new Miss Universe takes office immediately after the coronation and takes on a public cause in which she becomes the ambassador for a year to spread messages about the control of diseases, peace, and public awareness of AIDS (though the organization's more recent humanitarian works have included various causes such as women's and ethnic minority rights, along with contemporary racial issues, public health issues and the consequences of global warming). The winner also receives a cash allowance for her entire reign, a New York Film Academy scholarship, a modeling portfolio, beauty products, clothes, shoes, as well as styling, healthcare, and fitness services by different sponsors of the pageant. She also gains exclusive access to events such as fashion shows and opening galas, as well as access to casting calls and modeling opportunities throughout New York City. Between 1996 and 2015, the winner is given the use of a Trump Place apartment in New York City during her reign, which she shares with the Miss USA and Miss Teen USA titleholders. Starting in 2022, the winner and the two runners-up in the Top 3 will shuffle between residences in New York, United States and Bangkok, Thailand.[33]\n\nIf the winner, for any reason, cannot fulfill her duties as Miss Universe, the first runner-up takes over. This protocol has happened only once as of 2024, when Panama's Justine Pasek succeeded Russia's Oxana Fedorova as Miss Universe in 2002 after the latter's dethronement later that same year. Aside from the main winner and her runners-up, special awards are also given to the winners of the Best National Costume, Miss Photogenic, and Miss Congeniality. The Miss Congeniality award is chosen by the delegates themselves. In recent years, Miss Photogenic has been chosen by popular internet vote (the winner used to be chosen by media personnel covering the event), and the winning country for Best National Costume is announced live after the naming of the semifinalists during the coronation night.\n\nCrowns of Miss Universe\n\nThe crown of Miss Universe has changed nine times over the course of its 70-year history.[34]\n\nRomanov Imperial Nuptial Crown (1952) as the first crown, was previously owned by the now-defunct Russian monarchy. It was used by Armi Kuusela in 1952.[34]\n\nRomanov Diadem Crown or Metal Bronze Crown (1953) — When Christiane Martel became Miss Universe 1953, the nuptial crown was replaced by a metallic bronze crown. She was the only Miss Universe titleholder to wear this crown.[34]\n\nStar of the Universe (1954–1960) — This crown was used from 1954 to 1960. It was named as such due to the star shape at the top of the crown. It is made up of approximately 1,000 Oriental cultured and black pearls set in solid gold and platinum and only weighed 1.25 pounds. It was insured for US$500,000.[34]\n\nLady Rhinestone Crown or Coventry Crown (1961–2001) — This crown was purely made from rhinestones, debuting in 1961 as part of the 10th anniversary of the Miss Universe pageant. Only Marlene Schmidt and Norma Nolan wore this crown.[34] In 1963, renowned jeweler Sarah Coventry reinvented the rhinestone crown which featured a female figure (holding a scepter) as its main centerpiece. The cheaper cost of its rhinestone design made it possible to create exact replicas of the crown to be given to outgoing titleholders. The design was slightly modified in 1973 for the wearer's convenience, and was dubbed as The Lady Crown. This was used until 2002, when Denise Quinones became its last crown holder before relinquishing her role as Miss Universe, and the Mikimoto Pearl company accepted the offer to sponsor a commemorative crown for the Miss Universe Organization during the same year's 50th overall edition for the pageant.[34]\n\nMikimoto Crown (2002–2007; 2017–2018) — used from 2002 to 2007 for the 50th commemorative anniversary of the Miss Universe organization, this crown was designed by Tomohiro Yamaji for the Mikimoto Company, the official jewel sponsor of the Miss Universe Organization. The crown depicted the phoenix rising, signifying status, power and beauty, as stipulated in their sponsorship deal. The crown has 500 natural colorless diamonds of almost 30 carats (6.0 g), 120 South Sea and Akoya pearls, ranging in size from 3 to 18 mm diameter and is valued at US$250,000.[34] The crown was designed for the pageant on Mikimoto Pearl Island in Japan with the Mikimoto crown and tiara being first used for Miss Universe 2002, which was unveiled by former proprietor Donald Trump.[35] Among pageant connoisseurs, the Mikimoto crown is reputedly the most sought among beauty titleholders, before finally being retired for use after Catriona Gray became the last Miss Universe winner to ever use the crown on her reign until 2019.\n\nCAO Crown (2008) — in 2008, Dayana Mendoza was crowned with a tiara designed by a tandem of Rosalina Lydster and Dang Kim Lien of CAO Fine Jewelry. The crown was valued at US$120,000, was made of an 18 karat combination of white and yellow gold and composed of over 1,000 precious stones, including 555 white diamonds (30 carats), 375 cognac diamonds (14 carats), 10 smoky quartz crystals (20 carats) and 19 morganite gemstones (60 carats). The yellow lustre of the gold represents the prosperous thriving economy in Vietnam as symbolized by a Vietnamese Crane heron. However, Mendoza declined to use this crown and thus insisted on the Mikimoto crown when she crowned her compatriot, Stefanía Fernández as her successor.\n\nDiamond Nexus Crown (2009–2013) — From 2009 to 2013, Diamond Nexus Labs made the Miss Universe crown. The crown is set with 1,371 gemstones, weighing a total of 416.09 carats (83.218 g). It contains 544.31 grams of 14k and 18k white gold as well as platinum. The crown features synthetic rubies to represent Miss Universe's HIV/AIDS education and awareness platform. Diamond Nexus Labs is the first ever eco-friendly Official Jeweler of Miss Universe and was selected as part of NBC Universal's \"Green is Universal\" initiative.[36][37]\n\nDIC Crown (2014–2016) — From 2014 to 2016, Paulina Vega, Pia Wurtzbach and Iris Mittenaere were decorated with the DIC Crown, estimated to be worth US$300,000 and produced by Czech company Diamonds International Corporation (DIC).[38][39] The whole production process took approximately four months and required the work of ten artisans. The crown is reminiscent of the Manhattan Skyline and is composed of 311 diamonds, 5 pieces of blue topaz, 198 pieces of blue sapphire, 33 pieces of heat—fired crystals, and 220 grams of 18 karat white gold. The grand total weight of the crown is 411 grams. This crown was retired in 2017 due to a copyright infringement and subsequent payment issues between DIC and the Miss Universe Organization.[40]\n\nMouawad Power of Unity Crown (2019–2021) — On December 5, 2019, Mouawad Jewelry became the new jeweler for the Miss Universe Organization. With an estimated average worth of almost US$6 million, the Mouawad crowns are the world's most expensive set of pageant crowns on record. From 2019 to 2021, Zozibini Tunzi, Andrea Meza and Harnaaz Sandhu were decorated with the first-generation Mouawad Crown, revealed the Mouawad Power of Unity Crown.[41] The crown consists of Golden Canary Diamond that weighs 62.83 carat. According to Pascal Mouawad, the crown symbolizes Ambition, Diversity, Community, and Beauty.[42]\n\nMouawad Force for Good Crown (2022–present) — In 2022, with the ownership of the Miss Universe Organization transferred to Jakkaphong Jakrajutatip, the contract with Mouawad Jewelry was renewed and the current crown design was created. The second-generation Mouawad crown is called Force for Good and was introduced on December 19, 2022. The crown holds 110 carats of blue sapphires, 48 carats of white diamonds, and a 45.14-carat royal blue sapphire at its center.[43]\n\nGallery of Miss Universe crowns\n\nThe Romanov Diadem Crown, as worn by Miss Universe 1953, Christiane Martel\n\nThe Star of the Universe Crown, as worn by Miss Universe 1957, Gladys Zender\n\nThe Coventry Lady Rhinestone Crown, as worn by Miss Universe 1968, Martha Vasconcellos\n\nThe CAO Crown as worn by Miss Universe 2008, Dayana Mendoza\n\nThe Diamond Nexus Crown as worn by Miss Universe 2011, Leila Lopes\n\nThe DIC Crown as worn by Miss Universe 2015, Pia Wurtzbach\n\nThe Mouawad Power of Unity Crown as worn by Miss Universe 2019, Zozibini Tunzi\n\nRecent titleholders\n\nFor full list and details, see List of Miss Universe titleholders.\n\nEdition Year Representing Miss Universe National title Competition venue Number of entrants 68th 2019 South Africa Zozibini Tunzi Miss South Africa 2019 Atlanta, Georgia, United States 90 69th 2020 Mexico Andrea Meza Mexicana Universal 2020 Hollywood, Florida, United States 74 70th 2021 India Harnaaz Sandhu Miss Diva Universe 2021 Eilat, Israel 80 71st 2022 United States R'Bonney Gabriel Miss USA 2022 New Orleans, Louisiana, United States 83 72nd 2023 Nicaragua Sheynnis Palacios Miss Nicaragua 2023 San Salvador, El Salvador 84\n\nGallery of winners\n\nMiss Universe 2023\n\nSheynnis Palacios\n\nNicaragua\n\nMiss Universe 2022\n\nR'Bonney Gabriel\n\nUnited States\n\nMiss Universe 2021\n\nHarnaaz Sandhu\n\nIndia\n\nMiss Universe 2020\n\nAndrea Meza\n\nMexico\n\nMiss Universe 2019\n\nZozibini Tunzi\n\nSouth Africa\n\nMiss Universe 2018\n\nCatriona Gray\n\nPhilippines\n\nMiss Universe 2017\n\nDemi-Leigh Nel-Peters\n\nSouth Africa\n\nMiss Universe 2016\n\nIris Mittenaere\n\nFrance\n\nMiss Universe 2015\n\nPia Wurtzbach\n\nPhilippines\n\nMiss Universe 2014\n\nPaulina Vega\n\nColombia\n\nMiss Universe 2013\n\nGabriela Isler\n\nVenezuela\n\nMiss Universe 2012\n\nOlivia Culpo\n\nUnited States\n\nMiss Universe 2011\n\nLeila Lopes\n\nAngola\n\nMiss Universe 2010\n\nXimena Navarrete\n\nMexico\n\nMiss Universe 2009\n\nStefanía Fernández\n\nVenezuela\n\nMiss Universe 2008\n\nDayana Mendoza\n\nVenezuela\n\nMiss Universe 2007\n\nRiyo Mori\n\nJapan\n\nMiss Universe 2006\n\nZuleyka Rivera\n\nPuerto Rico\n\nMiss Universe 2005\n\nNatalie Glebova\n\nCanada\n\nMiss Universe 2004\n\nJennifer Hawkins\n\nAustralia\n\nMiss Universe 2003\n\nAmelia Vega\n\nDominican Republic\n\nMiss Universe 2002\n\nJustine Pasek\n\nPanama\n\nMiss Universe 2001\n\nDenise Quiñones\n\nPuerto Rico\n\nMiss Universe 2000\n\nLara Dutta\n\nIndia\n\nMiss Universe 1999\n\nMpule Kwelagobe\n\nBotswana\n\nMiss Universe 1998\n\nWendy Fitzwilliam\n\nTrinidad and Tobago\n\nMiss Universe 1997\n\nBrook Lee\n\nUnited States\n\nMiss Universe 1996\n\nAlicia Machado\n\nVenezuela\n\nMiss Universe 1994\n\nSushmita Sen\n\nIndia\n\nMiss Universe 1993\n\nDayanara Torres\n\nPuerto Rico\n\nMiss Universe 1992\n\nMichelle McLean\n\nNamibia\n\nMiss Universe 1991\n\nLupita Jones\n\nMéxico\n\nMiss Universe 1989\n\nAngela Visser\n\nNetherlands\n\nMiss Universe 1987\n\nCecilia Bolocco\n\nChile\n\nMiss Universe 1986\n\nBárbara Palacios\n\nVenezuela\n\nMiss Universe 1984\n\nYvonne Ryding\n\nSweden\n\nMiss Universe 1983\n\nLorraine Downes\n\nNew Zealand\n\nMiss Universe 1980\n\nShawn Weatherly\n\nUnited States\n\nMiss Universe 1979\n\nMaritza Sayalero\n\nVenezuela\n\nMiss Universe 1978\n\nMargaret Gardiner\n\nSouth Africa\n\nMiss Universe 1977\n\nJanelle Commissiong\n\nTrinidad and Tobago\n\nMiss Universe 1976\n\nRina Messinger\n\nIsrael\n\nMiss Universe 1973\n\nMargie Moran\n\nPhilippines\n\nMiss Universe 1971\n\nGeorgina Rizk\n\nLebanon\n\nMiss Universe 1970\n\nMarisol Malaret\n\nPuerto Rico\n\nMiss Universe 1969\n\nGloria Diaz\n\nPhilippines\n\nMiss Universe 1968\n\nMartha Vasconcellos\n\nBrazil\n\nMiss Universe 1967\n\nSylvia Hitchcock\n\nUnited States\n\nMiss Universe 1965\n\nApasra Hongsakula\n\nThailand\n\nMiss Universe 1963\n\nIêda Maria Vargas\n\nBrazil\n\nMiss Universe 1960\n\nLinda Bement\n\nUnited States\n\nMiss Universe 1959\n\nAkiko Kojima\n\nJapan\n\nMiss Universe 1958\n\nLuz Marina Zuluaga\n\nColombia\n\nMiss Universe 1957\n\nGladys Zender\n\nPeru\n\nMiss Universe 1956\n\nCarol Morris\n\nUnited States\n\nMiss Universe 1955\n\nHillevi Rombin\n\nSweden\n\nMiss Universe 1954\n\nMiriam Stevenson\n\nUnited States\n\nMiss Universe 1953\n\nChristiane Martel\n\nFrance\n\nMiss Universe 1952\n\nArmi Kuusela\n\nFinland\n\nMiss Universe Organization\n\nThe Miss Universe Organization currently owns and runs the Miss Universe, Miss USA, and Miss Teen USA beauty pageants.
