        "text": "I’ve always been a talker. My family’s stories from before I can remember prove I was born this way. But in my defense, what is better than truly connecting with another person? Whether it is a few words for a shared laugh, a deep conversation where things are learned or a friendship that gives you both for years?\n\nBeing on camera for over 20 years gave me the chance to talk to a lot of people, social media gave them the chance to talk back. I loved both. This page is a natural next step. It is a place to share a passion for fashion, beauty, recipes, exercise, travel and viewpoints, and a place for you to talk back. This page is a relationship, a friendship that will evolve and change with time. Is it going to be perfect? No. Is it going to be set in stone? No. Is it going to change with your thoughts and feedback? Yes, but please be gentle, lol!\n\nThis is a place where you can find all the blogs that I have done and of course, I’ll be adding a lot of new ones. It is also a place where we can all decide the questions we want answered and I will find the experts who can answer them.\n\nThere are more things coming, but for right now, let’s talk. Isn’t that how a good friendship starts?\n\nAbout Lisa\n\nLisa Robertson is a designer, fashion authority and TV personality. She created and designed the G.I.L.I. Line starting in 2012.
