A0JKU Editors Letter aGood Evening, Mr. Bond\" ith his billions, his Moorish Mexican hideaway with its own private army, and his cool, Anglo-French brio, Sir James Goldsmith is a char- acter right out of Ian Flem- ing—Ian Fleming by way of Thomas Nast. A former indus- trialist and a political icono- clast. Goldsmith, like any Bond villain worth his salt, appears constantly to be smil- ing. It is a brilliant and clearly calculated device: a smile gives almost nothing of the inner strategist away. And because there is always the threat that the smile will disappear, it is infinitely more menacing than a per- manent scowl. Goldsmith has an aversion to scorpions; his compound in Mexico is surrounded by traps to keep them out. And although he owned a major stake in Goodyear Tire & Rubber at one point, he has a phobia about rub- ber bands too. He has always had designs on the world, first as a buccaneering capitalist, later as a would-be en- vironmentalist. Bond-villain-wise, he has everything but the claw hand and the white cat. In an age when most major business figures have beaten a hasty retreat from the tumble of public scrutiny, Goldsmith, now 64, continues to conduct his private and professional lives on an epically grand scale. His first wife, a Bolivian tin heiress, died five months after they were married. He present- ly has an ex-wife, a wife, a mistress, and eight children scat- tered about in five residences in four countries. Goldsmith is both drawn to the press and repulsed by it. As is the press to and by him. He has had a particularly stressful time of it with the British media la ly over his current passion, the Referendu Party, through which he is spearheading 1 crusade against the unification of Eurof When Vanity Fair contributing editor Sa. Bedell Smith first approached Goldsmith f an interview, he passed along the same coi; teous response he has given hundreds of joi nalists who have sought him out over the pi> two decades: sorry, but he simply doesn't gi: personal interviews. Smith discovered, ho* ever, that Goldsmith often answers his ov phone. By the time she reached him, she had talked to i merous members of his inner circle and had read both his published political jeremiads as well as the two biogj phies of him and every newspaper article she could flit \"I think he's somebody who doesn't like to do things perficially, so he responded to that,\" she says. \"And he sponds to persistence, because he's that way, too.\" Goldsmr heard Smith out and called her back later that same I to ask her to meet him in Paris. Her report on page 136 is a candid look at one of I century's more colorful figures. He is certainly in a leagj with the subjects of Smith's two biographies— Williami Paley and Pamela Harriman— and of her previous profif for Vanity Fair: Gianni Agnelli, Stavros Niarchos, aj the Rothschilds. Goldsmith's opponents should bewaree that smile. For that matter, Sally Bedell Smith's is pn ty deadly as well. ^ffaC&iU, Liv for Today ON THE COVER Liv Tyler wears a lace bolero by John Galliano for Couture Givenchy. Skirt by John Galliano.

I got stuck on the other side of the lake, paddling into the wind trying to keep up with her.\" Now a V.F. contributing editor, Shoumatoff {above, right, contributing photographer Jonathan Becker) explores the world of the great camps for this issue— a lifestyle he understands well. In 1988, he \"packed it in\" a moved from Mexico City to the Adirondacks, where he lives with his wife and children in a house he built with the help of local craftsmen. \"It's been one unbroken chain,\" admits Sally Bedell Smith about her recent work, \"and it's all been an accident.\" The contributing editor's 1990 biography of William S. Paley sparked her interest in Edward R. Murrow's mistress, Pamela Harriman. While researching her book on the late ambassador, Smith learned the details of Harriman's affair with Baron Elie de Rothschild, who then figured in her January V.F. article on the banking dynasty. That story, in turn, stirred Smith's curiosity about Lord Jacob Rothschild's close friend Sir James Goldsmith, who is her subject this month.

Lonlrihiiiors CONTINUED FROM PAGE 3* Because they were Vietnam War correspondents at different times, contributing editor David Halberstam and his subject this month, novelist Ward Just, never met in Saigon. \"All the ambitious young men knew about all the other ambitious young men. And everyone was in awe of Just's reporting,\" then New York Timesman Halberstam recalls about his Washington Post rival's dispatches. \"He was someone I was intrigued by and nervous about.\" The two finally had dinner at La Coupole in Paris in 1966, and Halberstam has continued to admire Just's work.

Now, with China in the spotlight, Klein profiles one of the many new overseas- Chinese entrepreneurs, millionaire former playboy Dickson Poon, who took an unusual tack with his interrogator during their first meeting, in Hong Kong's luxurious Regent Hotel. Wearing a diamond-encrusted watch, Poon kept feeding Klein with chopsticks, insisting he sample each and every local delicacy. In 1980, British-born biographer Sylvia Jukes Morris came across a New York Times interview with Clare Boothe Luce that had been languishing in her \"Interesting People\" file, and thus began 15 years of work on the Luce biography excerpted in this issue. By the time of her death in 1987, Luce had become so candidly confiding that at times e Morris's husband, Edmund, found himself distracted from writing the second volume of hisr life of Theodore Roosevelt. \"He'd be writing about the Interstate Commerce Act,\" recalls Mo \"and Clare would drop by and start talking about one of her love affairs.\" Needless to say, the Commerce Act had to wait. Interview editor in chief Ingrid Sischy, a new V.F. contributing editor, spent her first nine years in apartheid South Africa, where television was banned and she saw only one movie, Around the World in Eighty Days, before her family moved to Scotland. A contributor to books by Robert Mapplethorpe and V.F. photographers Annie Leibovitz and Herb Ritts, Sischy was the editor of Artforum and a staff writer at The New Yorker, and is an artistic director of the Florence Biennale. Contributing editor Kevin Sessums is working on the final chapter of his novel, Porterhouse, which, he promises, will be published \"before the end of the millennium.\" The characters are drawn from the many eccentric people he has encountered in New York City, where he has liv for 21 years, and the French Quarter of New Orleans, where he has an apartment and spends much of his free time.

CECILIA MOSTAGHIM San Francisco, California Ebonic Plague I WANT to express my delight in reading Christopher Hitchens's article \"Hooked on Ebonics\" [March]. I found it witty, informative, and thought-provoking. Ex- actly what I expect from my Vanity Fair. MATTHEW L. STOTTS San Francisco, California I FOUND the lilting, oh- so-English treatise on Ebonics by Mr. Hitchens to be a fascinating cu- riosity piece, conveying both stodgy old-world sensibilities and contra- dictions which bordered on camp. His dismis- sive anti-Ebonics mes- sage is clear enough and is shared by many reasonable leaders who have voiced justifiable doubts, but the haughty tone in which he choos- es to denounce and be- little individuals who do not share his opinions betrays his own chutz- pah (translation in the Queen's English: colos- sal nerve) and ignorance. PATRICK J. WEN I Alamo, California AS AN ENGLISH teacher who is often asked her opinion on the validi- ty of Black English, I I was thankful that Chris- topher Hitchens cap- tured the essence of this - hybrid of a language and its effect in this country— recognizing its merit on one hand, yet wary of its per- petuation in our culture on the other. PAULA S. M. HORNE Seattle, Washington AS A BLACK AMERICAN MALE, I must] let you know that \"Hooked on Ebonics\" was first-rate. KEVIN DARREN NASH Atlanta, Georgia CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS may have left England to get away from Margaret Thatcher, but many others are leaving there just to get away from the contemp- tuous nostril raising he practices so as- siduously. It is either amazing or amus- ing to watch how gleefully white com- mentators always go after black people as soon as they find a politically safe pretext: O.J., Marion Barry, Afrocen- trism, the old Cosby show, and now-' Ebonics.

Gangstas— in the streets or in the studios— are doomed to shoot or be shot in the name of empty, worthless causes. Tupac saw his own light too late in the game to use his power over millions of loyal listeners and the media to make any changes worthy of remembrance. JAMES TUVERSON Los Angeles. California I HAVE READ SEVERAL pieces on Tupac Shakur's death, and yours was the only one to shed any light on the side of him that was a dedicated volunteer on behalf of children who are growing up on the streets as he did.

The recent revelations of Swiss complicity and deceit only deepen my conviction to bring up our two pre- cious sons to be proud of their Jewish identity and heritage. JOANNE L. KLEIN Clinton Corners, New York THOUGH THE NEWS of Swiss plans to construct a multimillion-dollar fund for Holocaust victims may hardly address the claims of survivors, it certainly proves that efforts made by moral entre- preneurs such as Edgar Bronfman finally do bear fruit, even if it takes the form of a symbolic gesture.

NANCY NEHLS NELSON Naperville, Illinois Hong Kong Affair WITH REGARD TO \"Hong Kong Sur- prise\" [by Andrew Neil, March], every- thing is on target, but it's important to note that, while Britain has been around for 99 years, only after the turn- over was imminent did it try to imple- ment democratic reforms. Its words ring hollow. For Britain to suggest democra- cy when it suddenly served its interest is at best an example of that annoying British arrogance and at worst tossing a match into the village as it leaves. The Opium Wars are a blight and a disgrace that will always be the legacy of Britain in China. That its \"empire\" was built on drugs eviscerates any lofty democracy path, a path it did not offer to the Chinese or Hong Kongers in the previous 90 -plus years. What was good enough for the home country and others in the rest of the commonwealth was not good enough for Hong Kong. GARY ZUINAN Danville, California YOUR STORY ON Hong Kong rightly makes much of the marriage between Cantonese hard work and British admin- istration, which was a major factor in the city-state's rise to wealth and prominence. But what of the Shanghaiese, who came from China's biggest city after the 1949 Communist takeover? They are generally regarded as being among Hong Kong's most savvy and shrewd entrepreneurs.

Adopting the tone of a contempo- rary reporter, he goes on to tell how Jef- ferson haggled with Houdon about the price, and gave up on the idea of a bronze equestrian hero in favor of the cheaper model. Switching from the pro- fane to the sacred, he demonstrates that the placement of the statue is exactly analogous to the siting of a god in a Rt man temple. Finally, he draws the viewer eye to the marble lapel of Washingtoi jacket. There is a button missing, and sculptor must have taken some trouble execute the mistake.

Robert Hughes is the most successful art historian, or ex- plainer of art, of his time. His latest book is American Visions: The Epic History of Art in America (Knopf). Its octuplet tele- vision version premieres this month on PBS. Like its chart-busting predecessor, The Shock of the New (1981), which dis- covered a mass audience for the subject of artistic modernism, American Visions is a history as much as a critique. The national canvas is unrolled, and the story of a people is related through its attain- ment in painting, architecture, design, and manufacture. It takes some kind of a polymath to conceive such a project. In an age of credentials and specialization, Hughes is a polymath of a distinct type. He has made amateurism professional. He is the marsupial critic. Marsupials are known for three things. They can look at the world from an upside-down and antipodean per- spective without losing balance or pro- portion. They have creative pouches and pockets for live, wriggling births. And they are capable of great leaps and bounds. You could also say that they are an ancient presence in a very young and new society. The versatility of Robert Hughes is a product of both his rooted- ness and his deracination; perhaps not since Alexis de Tocqueville has a foreign spectator seen so much of the American game. Here is our resident Australian alien, scrutinizing one of America's best- loved painters, Thomas Eakins, and telling us why he was considered un- American in his time: On one level, it [Swimming] is a wholly \"classical\" picture. Its scheme is Arcadian and virile— healthy bodies at play, in and out of their element—and its ancestry in- cludes Roman sculpture and the prints of bathing soldiers made after Michelangelo's lost Battle of Cascina. The figure lying on the rock is the Dying Gaul, reversed: a cast of this sculpture was in the Academy's col- lection. The broad stability of the triangu- lar composition reminds you of Poussin. But Eakins got into trouble in the Philadelphia of the 1880s, not so much for his homoerouc underlay as for the candor of his modeling classes. Just as | VANITY FAIR ismunfoncnB you are thinking that this sounds like the oil-and-brush version of what happened to Walt Whitman, Hughes quotes from Whitman's Leaves of Grass, expertly con- trasts the differing \"tones\" of Eakins and Whitman with the buttocks of Donatel- lo's David, and reveals details of the odd but close friendship that sprang up be- tween the young Victorian -American painter and the venerable poet of the Civil War. \"Only connect,\" said E. M. Forster. Or, as Hughes once put it to me, \"I'm busy. They want me to update Tlie Shock of the New and take in postmodernism. Sounds easy? It's only like trying to shift a ton of shite with a shoehorn.\" The marsupial achievement lies in pre- cisely this combination of qualities: the polished and the demotic. It used to be that America was young and brash but slightly insecure, and required the occa- sional reassurance of a high-culture Euro- pean critic, usually an Englishman like Lord Clark. Today, the United States is simultaneously swamped in mass popu- lar culture and uncomfortably stuck with a \"toney\" and plutocratic art establish- ment. It actually needs someone from a younger and more egalitarian society, both to challenge its vulgarity and to mock its elitist pretensions. Someone who knows the difference between Giot- to and Guernica and can freely quote Latin as well as filthy Australian limer- icks. Someone whose working title for his brilliant 1987 history of Australia, The Fatal Shore, was \"Kangaroots.\" Marsupials can contain contradic- tions. In that same shite/shoehorn preface to the second edition of The Shock of the New, Hughes wrote with distinct reserve about the medium that has made him famous: By forming images meant to be slowly contemplated into merely narrative frames, and thus imposing the fast time of TV on the slow time of painting and sculpture; by eliminating surface, texture, detail and au- thentic color . . . and above all, by the brief attention span it encourages, TV— even in the hands of the most sympathetic direc- tor—cannot construct a satisfactory parallel to the experience of a static work of art. Hughes was breezy enough when I asked him about this apparent irony. \"Yeah, well, odi et amo,\" he said in flu] ent street Roman about this love -hate relationship. \"Telly demands movement. It's wonderful for comparing motif and! image. It's awfully good at iconography] And that's about it. But one can givd people intellectual entertainment witbj out being definitive. What I'm telling! them on the screen is to get off thd couch and go and see it for themselves.'lj This is actually the same injunction ha] has been issuing from his atelier at Timi since 1970. And he can be as critical oi his mass-market weekly as he is of the M boob tube. In American Visions he re-H lates with relish the story of the bogus \"Helga\" flap of 1986: the supposed disj covery of a job lot of \"unknown\" works by Andrew Wyeth. This turned out td] be a scam and a stunt, but not before,w as Hughes puts it, everyone had been royally had, in a classid folie a deux, joined by the rest of the medial Time made Newsweek do it and Newsweea made Time do it, and neither could let goj And, of course, the publicity ensured than special exhibitions of the Helga paintings would be mounted, with great pomp, at tha National Gallery of Art in Washington bej fore touring the rest of America. But on J deeper level, the Great Helga Hype was thd natural outcome of fantasies about art and artists that had been brewing in American culture for years, spurred on by museumsJ the market and the blockbuster mentality with its overheated imagery of secret troves, 3 Unknown Treasures, Hidden MasterpiecesJ Gold of the Gorgonzolas, and the rest. (It helps to read the above out loud,; bearing in mind Hughes's own encapsuji lation of the accent of his native Sydney, Australia, as \"high in the nose, drawl-J ing, flat and brown.\") He is at war on) two fronts, first against the neoconservaj tive art essayists like Hilton \"Breath o» Hot Air\" Kramer, who affect to thinli that all is barbarism and decay, and seoj ond against the posturing neophiliaca like Julian Schnabel, he of the thickly1 applied crockery, who bring the meretri- cious skills of Madison Avenue to bear on \"the art market.\" Hughes has onl)| one non -marsupial attribute. The platyJ pus and the wallaby are not predators and do not slay. He, in bold contrast, is a good and consistent hater. When the pseudos meet the continued on page 7j MAY 19 9?

As he puts it with such scorn in American Visions: At the opening of the decade in 1980, the three most expensive paintings ever sold at public auction were Turner's Juliet and Her Nurse ($6.4 million), Velazquez's Portrait of Juan de Pareja ;$5.4 million), and van Gogh's Poet's Garden ($5.2 million). These prices seemed scandalous at the time— head- ine stuff. Eight years later, they would scarcely have been thought worth re- sorting. Pumped by its own fetishism, by millionaires competing in the auction 'oom like mountain goats clashing over sossession of a crag or a mate ... the narket went off the chart and then off the wall. ... In 1990 a Japanese wood-pulp 3aron named Ryoei Saito paid $82.5 mil- ion for van Gogh's portrait of his physi- :ian, Dr. Gachet, and, two nights after :hat, $78.1 million for Renoir's Au Moulin ie la Galette. That one man could spend wer $160 million (roughly the entire an- lual budget of America's National En- iowment for the Arts) on a brace of paintings sent the top end of the art mar- cet from obscenity into farce. Only connect . . . Hughes doesn't al- ways take so long to find and saturate lis target. He can be pithy as occasion demands. \"New Zealand? Great place :o visit, but you wouldn't want to spend i weekend there.\" At Time's elevator )ank, he once saw his boss and patron Henry Grunwald emerge in the compa- ny of Henry Kissinger. Glimpsing this sair of rotund Central Europeans in one rame, so to speak, he gaily cried, \"If it sn't Tweedledum and Tweedledee!\" The Vagrant and fastidious Rhoda Koenig Mice asked him if there had to be quite »o much flogging in his description of :onvict life in Australia: \"Ah, well, /'see, darling, that was for the English narket. We wanted to do well in the rhristmas trade,\" and in American Vi- rions the following observation: \"It is a ;urious fact that America, even though t is one of the most religious countries )n earth, has produced very little in the vay of original religious art.\" I'm still hinking about that: an apparently casu- il apercu that can be the outcome only )f a long engagement. (It occurs in the :ourse of a passage on Andy Warhol, in artist once much ridiculed by Hughes /t AY 19 9 7 For art in America's sake: John Singleton Copley's Watson and the Shark, above, and Jean-Antoine Houdon's George Washington, details right and below, are among the works featured in Robert Hughes's upcoming PBS series, American Visions. and now upgraded by this sternly ex- Catholic writer precisely because he did try to capture and employ the religious impulse. We used to disagree about this: Hughes today says with perfect generos- ity that he was wrong. \"I've mellowed on him, and on the unwilled impudence of his cultural existence. I once thought he'd artificially constructed his own pro- file and I now think he didn't fake it.\") The great pre -modern confrontation between a certain kind of art and a certain sort of aesthetics came when Whistler sued John Ruskin. Ruskin had accused Whistler of \"flinging a pot of paint in the public's face.\" In court, Whistler was asked how much he was charging for a certain picture. \"Two hun- dred guineas.\" And how long had it taken him to execute the painting? \"A couple of days.\" \"And for the labor of two days you asked 200 guineas?\" \"No. It was for the knowledge gained through a lifetime.\" Hughes might well have been on both sides of that controversy, because the snobs rallied to one party and the free -market forces gathered behind the other, and he believes that both factions are inimical to art. His own lifetime of experience in- cludes failing the first-year arts course at Sydney Universi- ty (\"a course that a mono-cellular or- ganism could have I passed with ease\"), wasting a bit of time in the discovery that he couldn't paint like de Kooning, and taking the first leap that every ambi- tious marsupial must make— the jump out of Australia. \"Australia is often compared to Ameri- ca as a young country with a frontier tra- dition. But actually we're very different. America was colonized in hope and we were colonized as a punishment. We don't have any 'Australian exceptional- ism'— the messianic idea that dooms Americans to endless disappointment. There's no stuff about being a city on a hill. We have no moral mission to other countries. Pragmatism and skepticism are what we have instead, and these are quite useful critical tools.\" And so they are. Reviewing John Singleton Copley's painting Watson and the Shark (1778), Hughes (who knows from sharks, having learned to sail off the Great Barrier Reef) can zigzag between Raphael and Jaws for his references, and hold the at- tention of someone who thinks of Don- atello as one of the Ninja Turtles. In dis- cussing New York City as a cultural arti- fact, he can discourse on the banal way that zoning laws led to skyscrapers, and then turn to a comparison between the step-back design of high-rises and the Mayan ziggurat. On his way through an elucidation of American Gothic he pun- gently minutes that Grant Wood was \"a closet case if ever there was one.\" Occa- sional five-dollar words— \"apotropaic\" is VANITY FAIR Hitchens * \"It is,1' Hughes told me bluntly, \"a shitty time artistically\" ? a favorite one— pepper the delivery like nuggets in an alluvium. One advantage of a marsupial upbringing is that, with its kookaburras and other exotica, it in- culcates an early familiarity with poly- syllabic words. Hughes's Irish-Australian Catholic fa- ther died when he was 12, and he was immensely fortunate in having the Australian writer Alan Moorehead as a surrogate papa. (The title of Tfte Fatal Shore is an hommage to Moore- head's history of Polynesia, The Fatal Impact.) One day, as they were having lunch with the Australian painter Sidney Nolan, Moorehead turned to Hughes and said, \"If you stay here another 10 years, Australia will remain a very inter- esting place, but you, meanwhile, will have become a bore.\" That was all the cue he needed. Following the lead of many other ambitious young Aus- tralians, Hughes went to London and wasted the 1960s in fine style, splashing his money up against the wall and be- lieving that drinking and wenching were a necessary part of the writerly life. (\"I only got the first two bits right.\") A marsupial underground magazine, Oz, which was the object of a celebrated ob- scenity prosecution, carried an essay by Hughes which recounted acid days and praised Theodore Roszak's book The Making of a Counter Culture for its de- termined revolutionary style. This feuil- leton is not represented in Hughes's fine collection. Nothing if Not Critical. Pho- tographs of the period show him in a Road Warrior pose as a roughneck bik- er. But before leaving he had undertak- en, at the ripe age of 24, a book called The Art of Australia. This work, which he now dismisses as juvenilia, has the same quality— of setting down a national narrative through art— that he has de- ployed with American Visions. From the Aborigines and the first convicts and warders, through the exploration of the outback, the perspective widens to take in Nolan's series on Ned Kelly and Gal- lipoli: the modern Australian traumas and rites of passage. \"When I look at Nolan's first Kelly series,\" wrote Hughes, \"I am reminded of an observation by Karl Marx: that the epic is the art form of an undeveloped society.\" This was Portrait of the art critic as a young man: In his second year as Time's art critic, Robert Hughes takes in the Marlborough Gallery's Picasso show, New York City, October 1971. good training. And Hughes was wise to return to his first love. After an immer- sion in the churches and galleries of Italy— also conducted under the aegis of Alan Moorehead— he was able to sober up, break his writer's block, and pick up work as an art critic for the London Sunday papers and for the BBC. Lord Clark himself took an interest in the young fellow, which meant that he came highly recommended to Time when it needed a new art critic. With the pa- tronage of Henry Grunwald, Hughes immigrated to New York in 1970 and completed his knight's move across the English-speaking world. \"My Australian relatives used to use English cosmology without realizing its absurdity. They would refer to New Guinea or Indone- sia as 'the Far East' when of course it was the Near North.\" This trick of per- spective, putting him at a double angle to his adopted country, has served him well ever since. Though American Visions can be read perfectly easily as a marsupial trib- ute to the vastness and variety of the American canvas, and to the huge inge- nuity and scope of the American imagi- nation, it is actually a warning against decline. Remember, says Hughes, that Boston is older than St. Petersburg. America's middle age is creeping in, un- recognized. The galleries are ossifying.^ The art mart has become like the junk*, bond market of a decade ago. The cul- ture wars consist of more and more>| noise about less and less. No American^ network would have backed the series,' which was commissioned by the BBC| and— after a lot of arm-twisting on theij part of Hughes— by Time Warner. Gresham's law is working its dumbing-i down effect on television and the mov- ies. \"It is,\" he told me bluntly, \"a shit- ty time artistically.\" It has also, one gathers, been a shitty time for him per- sonally. He suffered from tenacious.] blues last year and plans to lie fallow] after this book. And then, perhaps, a memoir of his Catholic Australian up-d bringing. His thoughts are turning homeJ again as the prospect of Australia^ declaring itself a republic becomesd more real. \"It's the only thing I agrees with Rupert Murdoch about. It's got tot) come. It would be the most terrible actJ of provincial abandonment if the BritsJ got rid of the monarchy before we did.' Against the swirls of fashion and the pressure of commodification and chi-i canery, Hughes has been urging Ameri-r cans to use their own eyes, form theiij own judgments, have the courage to de4| velop their own taste. I made him z\\ present of Ralph Waldo Emerson's red mark, quoted by Edward Hopper in hiaj essay on Charles Burchfield: In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts; they come back to us with a certain alienated majes< ty.

By holding up a mirror of the Ameri can artistic past, from the classical t< the high modern, and by contrasting i to the current mediocrity, Hughes ha not tried to establish an orthodoxy o his own.

Wolcott strong-armed into doing by the mobster Sam Giancana.) The Rat Pack kine- scope, found in a closet at the Dismas House, is more than a historical curio. It has the glamorous wham of a champi- onship prizefight. It's an opportunity to catch three of America's greatest show- men in their tigerish prime (with Carson along for the ride), before they became total legends and turned into leather. There's Dean Martin with his sleepy power, like a leopard in a smoking jacket, finishing his few songs with the words \"I'd like to do some more for ya, but I'm lucky I remembered these.\" says that the song he's about to perform makes for \"a slight duplication here, but I don't think you'll mind too much,\" launching into his own rendition of \"I've Got You Under My Skin,\" which he con- tours and tattoos as if romancing for the first time. Dean amuses, Sammy is mahvelous, but only Sinatra, with his Manhattan-skyline voice, conjures a mood and a spell. After Sinatra's set comes the usual Rat Pack foolery, some at Dean's ex- pense (\"The only reason he's got a good tan, he found a bar with a skylight\"), but with Sammy as the primary butt. The racial ribbing, though not as crass or The excitement that this kinescope has sparked testifies to the unfading leg- end of the Rat Pack and their stream- lined influence on male bravado, which can be observed in everything from the resurgence of \"bachelor pad\" music and the cocktail hour to the nostalgia for the . Vegas of yore in movies like Casino and Bugsy, when the city still swung and the red lobbies weren't clogged with Mr. and . Mrs. Big-Butt America pushing strollers between the slots. The Rat Pack is the Mount Rushmore of men having fun. The designer Mossimo Giannulli keeps a large photograph of the Rat Pack in his Laguna Beach home, like an eternal There's Sammy Davis Jr., a gleaming revolver of a man, belting out a maudlin Anthony Newley torch song as if he means it, goofing around with \"I've Got You Under My Skin\" (\"it's a little lumpy, but you're under my skin\"), demonstrating the latest go- go dances (the monkey, the jerk, the frug, the mashed potato), and, in a fi- nal tour de force, doing quick carbon copies of Billy Eckstine, Nat King Cole, Frankie Laine, Mel Torme, Tony Ben- nett, and Dean himself. And then there's Sinatra, confident, not the Adam's apple on a stick he was or the barrel-chested belter he would become, cruising inside the luxury-limousine sound of the Count Basie band, not so much singing the up-tempo numbers (\"Fly Me to the Moon,\" \"You Make Me Feel So Young\") as riding them home, his rabbit jabs providing the punctuation to his cagey phrasing and eased-off vow- els. Frank Sinatra has been called great for so long that it's easy to forget how great he is. Praise becomes platitude. At one point, alluding to Sammy's set, he persistent as the kidding on the Villa Venice CD, conveys the edgjness of the civil-rights era Sammy men- tions something about get- ting Martin Luther King Jr.'s permission to appear. Dean lifts Sammy in his arms and says, \"I'd like to thank the N.A.A.C.P. for this wonderful trophy.\" Sammy, who had converted to Judaism, is hailed as the only Jewish Muslim: Ir- ving X. What's interesting about the last segment, aside from the forced joviality of the racial horseplay, is Carson's sur- facing irritation as the buffoonery (de- liberately bad imitations of Jimmy Cagney, etc.) drags on too long. He feels extraneous on the stage, checking his watch and saying he has to catch a plane, and although he is not nearly the star at that point that Frank, Dino, or Sammy is, he isn't grateful to play stooge to the gods. We see in his broom- stick posture and sentry eyes the isolat- ed power that Carson would become. The show ends with all four wailing away at \"The Birth of the Blues,\" with Dean taking a brilliantly timed pratfall just as he wings into his verse. flame. \"These guys are my idols,\" he told InStyle magazine. \"They just cruised. They had this great group of people, love and friendship.\" The fact that the press keeps trying to manufacture fresh new Rat Packs— the acting Brat Pack of Judd Nel- son, Ally Sheedy, Andrew McCarthy, Molly Ringwald, and Rob Lowe; the lit- erary Brat Pack of Jay Mclnerney, Bret Easton Ellis, and Tama Janowitz— indi- cates the constant itch for a group energy, a moving amoeba of excitement, a scene. The term \"Rat Pack\" originally desig- nated not Sinatra and his flying wedge but an informal Hollywood social set re- volving around Humphrey Bogart and his pals. Nathaniel Benchley designed the letterhead of the group's stationery, which bore the loyalty oath coined by Bogart, \"Never rat on a rat.\" Sinatra, who idolized Bogart, was a member in good standing, along with Judy Garland and agent Irving \"Swifty\" Lazar. After Bogart's death in 1957, Sinatra, with his natural charisma and inability to be alone (see Gay Talese's classic study in Esquire in 1966, \"Frank Sinatra Has a Cold\"), filled the social void and then some with his own Rat Pack, also known as the Clan- names Sinatra disavowed as inaccurate r VANITY FAIR MAY 19 9 7 Wolcott and uncouth. \"There is no such thing as a clan or pack,\" he explained. \"It's just a bunch of millionaires with common in- terests who get together to have a little fun.\" The members of this floating bac- chanal included Martin (with whom Sinatra co-starred in Some Came Run- ning), Joey Bishop, Sammy Davis Jr., and Peter Lawford, classy dames like Angie Dickinson and Shirley MacLaine, and supporting players like Sammy Cahn, Cesar Romero, Don Rickles, Milton Berle, and the director Lewis Milestone. It never hit me until now that the Rat Pack formed during the same period that the Beats rolled onto the scene- Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, William Burroughs, and all those other sponta- neous bopsters. (Kerouac's On the Road was published in 1957, the year Bogart's Rat Pack gave way to Sinatra's.) At first the two outfits couldn't seem more bizarro-world apart, the Rat Packers showing the money in their sharkskin suits and slick grooming, the Beats bum- ming around in fleapit pads from Mon- terey to Morocco on the path to Buddha- hood. Yet both were a reaction to the suburban conformism of work-home- family in the Eisenhower era. The Rat Pack, like the Beats, disdained middle- class moderation in their pursuit of free- wheeling kicks. (\"This [cigarette] ain't got no printin' on it at all,\" Dean Mar- tin muses in the Rat Pack video.) Like the Beats and their fictional alter egos, the Rat Pack were always in motion, nocturnal creatures partying in a perpet- ual Now. And like the Beats, the Rat Pack had their own special hipster lingo to winnow out the squares from the truly anointed, a code that sounds like something cooked up by Steve Allen in a jazzy frame of mind. Kitty Kelley provides a glossary in her 1986 biogra- phy of Sinatra, His Way: women were \"broads,\" \"bird\" equaled penis (as in \"How's your bird?\"), \"a little hey-hey\" meant a good time, \"clyde\" was an all- purpose noun, and death was \"the big casino.\" Nice, France, August 1 1 (A. P.)— The sec- ond wave of Frank Sinatra's Hollywood clan hit the Riviera beaches as cane- twirling Sammy Davis Jr. danced down the ramp of a jet airliner. \"I would have been here earlier, daddy- ohs, but the hotel clerk in London forgot to wake me,\" Davis told waiting reporters and photographers. -New York Post, August 11, 1961. Personal hygiene aside, where the Rat Pack and the Beats parted company was in their attitudes toward power in all its seductive guises. To the Beats— self- educated in the prophecies of William Blake and Eastern notions of nonattach- ment— the Pentagon, Madison Avenue, and Hollywood were all manifestations of Moloch. \"Hollywood will rot on the windmills of Eternity / Hollywood whose movies stick in the throat of God,\" Allen Ginsberg declared. (And this was before Pauly Shore.) While the Beats were content to woo nodding fields of young minds, the Rat Pack enjoyed the view from the penthouse suite, where sex and money were plugged into the same socket. With Sinatra as their king. their Pope, // padrone, the Rat Pack were a royal court, granting and receiv- ing favor. Seas of gawkers parted in hushed wonder when they crossed the lobby of Las Vegas's Sands Hotel, the casino which is the Xanadu of Rat Pack fields wanted to tap into the electricity] John F.

The Sands was where they did their most famous engagements (the double live album Sinatra at the Sands, avail- able on CD, preserves the brassy ebul- lience), drawing the high rollers and their minked molls. Nick Tosches sets the scene in his 1992 Dean Martin bi- ography, Dino: It was not just the dirty-rich giovanostri and padroni who were drawn to them, to their glamour, to the appeal of darkness made respectable. The world was full, it seemed, of would-be wops and woplings who lived vicariously through them, to whom the imi- tation of cool took on the religiosity of the Renaissance ideal of imitatio Christi. The very songs that Sinatra and Dean sang, the very images they projected, inspired lavish squandering among the countless men who would be them. It was the Jew-roll around the prick that rendered them ithyphallic godkins, simulacra of the great ones, in their own eyes and in the eyes of the teased-hair lobster-slurping Bimbo sapiens they sought to impress. Not exactly how I would phrase it, but, hey, man, to each his own bird! The ranks of Rat Pack wannabes weren't restricted to swarthy men and wives in lobster bibs. Elvis Presley's \"Memphis Mafia\" was a high-cholesterol Rat Pack. Heavy swingers in their own with Robert Kennedy, tried to commii suicide at Sinatra's Cal-Neva Lodgea in Nevada, a favorite hangout of Gianj cana's, and succeeded a few days latea in Los Angeles. Sinatra, the Kennedys,;l Monroe, the Mob— for a few short years! it was a dizzying round of musical bedsJ Perhaps no book captures the dangerous! golden-nooky pop-myth glamour of tha period better than Norman Mailer's An American Dream, which begins with a reverie about double-dating with J.F.K.' and ends with a drive to Las Vegas] where the narrator phones his dead* sweetheart in Heaven, who tells him thafti Marilyn says hello. It's an honorary Ra& Pack novel. In the first flush of Camelot, beforer- Marilyn Monroe overdosed, Giancana1 tried to arrange a hit on Castro, and J.F.K. was assassinated, Sinatra and pals! shot a caper movie for his production^ company that stands as the definitive photo album of the Rat Pack phenome- non, Ocean's 11. Other Rat Pack filmsji would follow, such as Robin and the Sev\\' en Hoods, but this is the one with the essence de rat. Shot in 1960, Ocean's 11 was directed by Lewis Milestone, who* had earned his distinction with All Quiet on the Western Front and A Walk in the VANITY FAIR MAY 19 9 7 DOMN/\\K/\\R/\\N N E W Y O R K CASHMERE MIST INTRODUCING A FRAGRANCE AS SOFT AND SENSUAL AS CASHMERE AGAINST BARE SKIN.

After !7onte buys the big casino, suffering a peart attack as he crosses the street, other jnembers of the gang gather on the street !o share the news. Heads nod. Without mothering to change expression, Sinatra hen exits the scene as if heading for a andwich, and Lawford remarks, \"He's aking it hard.\" Not so you'd notice! 'Vhat rescues the movie from utter ply- »vood is its comic anticlimax, when the 'cheme runs aground and the money 1 it- Tally goes up in smoke, and the Rat off bis stripper wife with the words \"You're just nothing but a bringdown anyway!\" What the SCTV parody exu- berantly nails is the gee-whiz juvenile giddiness underlying the Rat Pack swag- ger and camaraderie. Their jive is not the genuine laid-back hip of jazz, but the loud tones and threads of lounge lizards trying to pass as jazzy. Most of the Rat Pack humor is corny, retrograde. The Rat Pack mystique is not about being in- nately cool; it's about wanting to be cool so much you give each other contact highs. \"Oh, yeah!\" It's white soul, with- out the soul. The fascination with the Rat Pack ex- presses a longing for an everyday mas- culine style that's cool and crisp, with- out being James Bond swanky. The Rat Pack video was shot in 1965, before the hippie insurgence feminized men, fluffing their hair and softening the sharp cut of their wardrobes into more flowing lines. Even the slouchier postures of the Rat Packers (like Dean's modified John Wayne roll) carry more purposeful thrust than is there, the look is wanting. A lot of the younger male stars, even when they dress keen, have junkie-dank skin and sticky, unwashed hair that would have made Sinatra in his prime drag them through a car wash to straighten out their clyde. The razor-blade flair of the Rat Pack style gleams best in a time bubble or a deliberately retro fashion spread. It com- plements the overall style of the Kennedy- kaboom 60s; it jibes with the design and decor— tail fins, stand-up bars, African masks, breezeways, Mondrian rectangles, and curvilinear signs. The ladies in this bachelor paradise sported cocktail dresses and bouffants with enough hair spray to stop a bullet; when these walking powder puffs made small talk or indulged in dry laughter, they turned up their wrists just so. That's all Audrey Hepburn now. The natty extravagance of the Rat Pack look clashes with shopping-mall functional- ism— fern bars, family minivans, video rentals, and computer monitors casting gray death rays. Clubs have lost most of their dressy cachet; they've become day- care centers for night owls.

Years later, Ocean's 11 inspired one of he classic movie parodies, SCTV's Maudlin's 11,\" in which the StTFregu- ars trade finger-snapping slang with one mother (\"Absopositively,\" \"Bingo, din- ;o!\") as they plan a heist with such vocal :nthusiasm (\"Oh, yeah!\" \"Cool, man, :ool!\") that everybody in Vegas knows he score. In a takeoff on the Ocean 's 11 itrip-club scene, the acerbic Bill Needle Dave Thomas) belts out the theme from Exodus, acknowledging the crowd's flat esponse with a surly \"Thank you for hat great round of indifference,\" kissing the nudist-colony droop of male hippies. When unabashed masculinity re- turned to pop culture, it did so with a vengeance, pumped up on steroids and so thickened that its meat-men (Conan the Bar- barian, Rambo) could barely speak, or, conversely, ranted like a neighborhood bully (Andrew Dice Clay). Rat Pack male-bonding infiltrates such revisionist guy pictures as GoodFellas (a rotting- carcass Rat Pack) and Tlw Usual Suspects (the twist being that the soulful gang leader is played for a fool by the Joey Bishop mascot, portrayed by Kevin Spacey). Quentin Tarantino's stuff has a perverse Rat Pack streak.
