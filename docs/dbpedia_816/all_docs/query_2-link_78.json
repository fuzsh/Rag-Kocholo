By Mike Hughes Gannett News Service Rough Guide begins an eight-week series at 10 tonight on Mississippi ETV. Magenta De Vine who hosts with Sankha Guha or Rajan Datar talks of givinga fresh face to TV travel. \"I think it's more of an attitude; they wanted a fresh approach.\" Rough Guide is a British show, far from celebritydom. In the opener, it roams Australia .\n\nIt meets people who explore Melbourne's drainage pipes; they also meet young cowgirls who castrate sheep. \"This seems to give you a license, when you've got a camera,\" De Vine says. So she meets strangers, goes to strange places, even forgets to be frightened. In Zimbabwe, she was chatting calmly to the camera as a rogue elephant approached from behind. De Vine says she loves the journeys but also enjoys American visits .\n\n\"I love the convenience. I love the fact that you can pick up a phone and order anything.\" De Vine was a BBC radio staffer who switched to TV. She brought a distinctive look, including short hair and long body, usually swathed in black. sister for son, Cody, next month, has made noises about leaving the show. That would blow a hole in the talk-show landscape big enough for Tesh, Gibbons and three other chatty co-hosts .\n\nWhatever happens, Tesh and Gibbons know that in following the trail blazed by Reege and Kathie, they are treading on sacred ground. Tesh: \"I have encouraged Leeza to name her next child Cody.\" Gibbons: \"I wrote to (Philbin and Gifford) and said we're thinking about doing this show, and if we do, it will be because of you.\" On other fronts, Tesh wins Em-mys for his musical compositions, including the much-played theme for the 1992 Summer Olympics. Gibbons is a host of the Miss Universe Pageant, the annual Hollywood Christmas Parade, two radio shows and a cable show on parenting. She has two small children, a husband and, naturally, her own production company: Leeza Gibbons Enterprises. Oprah, watch out .\n\nThe pair plans to continue En-tertainment Tonight host jobs Tesh with Mary Hart on week-nights, and Gibbons with Tesh on weekends. Gibbons: \"John and I are having a great ride with E. T. It's quite simply the best gig in town.\" The new show is, on the other hand, \"probably one of the more outrageous talk shows you'll ever see\" (Gibbons) and has \"unscripted bizarre Lettermanesque events\" (Tesh). The Entertainment Tonighthosts begin a new daytime venture .\n\nBy Susan Stewart Knlght-Rldder Newspapers Entertainment Tonight co-hosts John Tesh and Leeza Gibbons will talk about anything. Her kids, his sex life. Her high school debate triumphs, his incalculable ambitions. The question is, will America want to listen? In a clear case of talk-show copycat crime, John Leeza from Hollywood debuts today at 10 on WLBT-Channel 3. The hourlong show will feature 8 to 10 minutes of \"host chat,\" capitalizing on its hosts' \"chemistry, spontaneity, knowledge and likability,\" accord-ing to the NBC press release .\n\nThere will be friendly celebrity interviews and off-beat segments, too. Sounds familiar. Gibbons: \"If there's a competitor, if you're counting apples and apples, the real competitor might be Live! With Regis Kathie Lee.\" No kidding! Thanks to the chemistry, spontaneity, knowledge and likability of Regis Phil-bin and Kathie Lee Gifford, not to mention their 17 minutes of \"host chat,\" friendly celebrity interviews and off-beat segments, Live! is huge, the talk-show world's biggest phenomenon since Jay Leno was a substitute host. Live's numbers are still good, but co-host Gifford, expecting a Oliver Stone will produce a TV version of Randy Shilts' controversial best seller, Conduct Unbecoming, for HBO Pictures. This is Shilts' second project with Stone, who .\n\nis producing the big-screen production of Shilts' The Mayor of Castro Street. It's based on the life of murdered gay rights activist Harvey Milk. Shilts' And the Band Played On, about the AIDS crisis, will debut on HBO later this year. Entertainment's Ken Taylor, the host of US Magazine Show, has joined VH-1, where he'll be host of Top 21 Countdown. So long for now to that CBS sitcom deal between Roseanne and Tom Arnold and Linda Bloodworth-Thomason and Harry Thomason .\n\nThere's no bad blood between the two couples, but the Thomasons have told CBS it's free to shop the project around tcother producers. That sitcom was to featured Tom Arnold whose Jackie Thomas show ABC recently canceled in the lead role. PBS' American Playhouse will co-produce Armistead Maupin's classic Tales of the City. Tales, based on Maupin's colorful novels about gay-and-straight residents of a San Francisco apartment house in the '70s, will air over six hours in 1994. It will run first in the fall on Great Britain's Channel 4, which put up seed money for the long-delayed production .\n\nOscar-winner Olympia Dukakis stars as Anna Madrigal, the maternal landlady. Rajan Dafar and Magenta Devine are the hosts of Rough Guide. for me now.\" That gives him a feeling for the problems he and De Vine have found on the road, from racism toward natives to damage of the environment. It's a rough (and fascinating) world. \"That's sort of her trademark,\" Datar says .\n\nDatar recently replaced Guha as co-host. He's an English native with family roots in India. \"As a child, I faced quite a bit of prejudice,\" he said. \"Life's gotten easier MONDAY NIGHT Movies Specials Sports News Best bet: \"Rough Guide\" (10 p.m., ETV).
