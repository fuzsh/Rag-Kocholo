The experiences, though, are entirely dif- ferent. In New York I'd walk tour blocks, take a brief subway ride, and walk another six blocks. After a day of work, just covering that short distance provided a chance to decompress— to use my legs, to breathe in something other than office air. By the time I had reached my apart- ment 1 had shaken off most of the day. In L.A., when my workday is over, I drive. Driving requires physical skill, but it doesn't offer physical release. It demands that you make instant decisions, even when inching your way along the freeway, there's nothing passive about the act. Which means that not only is there little chance to decompress, there's a good chance you may be more wrung out when you arrive home. What driving pro\\ides is the opportunity to be alone and the illusion of control. You can take a shortcut, you can blast the radio, you can abruptly change your mind about where you're headed. You can't do that in a subway But driving gives something else: You enter a half-meditative state in which you are both acutely aware of everything around you and lost in yourself You're listening to a book on tape or to Chick Heam, and at the same time you're braking for a light or switching lanes without being conscious of your actions. For no reason an idea f)ops into your head or a long-forgotten memory resurfaces as you steer the car up an on-ramp. When we drive we are of this world and removed from it. This is one of the centra! experiences of Los Angeles. It is our paradox, our version of being alone in a crowd. Contributor Russ Rymer's The Accidental Life\" is about when those meditative states are sud- denly violently interrupted. It is about the dark side of dri\\ ing in Los Angeles: the jangled nerves, the rudeness, the knowledge that you risk death every time you get into your car. A month after I moved to L.A., I had my first near miss. A car cut around me as I was about to switch lanes. I swerved to avoid hitting it. When I got to the office, still unsetded, I told a colleague what had happened, and he smiled \"Oh,\" he said, \"youTl have that experience at least once a month.\" Pferhaps 1 that's our other paradox. Driving fills our days with both peace and utter honor.

O S A N a E L E S J U N F 2 0 0 2 I ' V 0 R Y avnilabic at select blooniingdales nordstrom saks fifth avenue (lXeItXtIeIrIsI ALTERNATIVE SCENARIO IN HIS INTRIGUING COLUMN ON the L.A. Weekly [Media, \"Ping-Pong Diplomacy,\" April], RJ Smith states that the paper that new editor Laurie Ochoa \"inherited from [former editor] Sue Hor- ton was lucrative but dull.\" Dull enough, I guess, to be named best alternative newsweekJy by the Utne Reader in 1999, and to dominate the awards given by the Association of Alternative Newsweeklies (AAN) since 1996. \"Inside its Hollywood offices,\" Smith goes on, \"the paper was running on a comfortable 9 -to- 5 sched- ule.\" This is news to those of us who re- peatedly worked into the early morning hours. \"The paper didn't tell stories,\" Smith continues, in which case it's sur- prising that Horton's Vdekly had finalists for the PEN West literary journalism award every year from 1996 to 2001, win- ning it once, and took two first- and one second-place AAN award for feature story. Smith also states that \"the arts were featured sparingly on the cover— they just weren't serious enough.\" As arts editor under Horton (and currently un- der Ochoa), I certainly share the resfxjn- sibility for arts cover stories. But I dispute his latter claim, and suggest that, rather, Horton saw the traditional alternative weekly dependence on soft arts covers as a weakness, and sought to address it— as well as to expand the readership— through a greater emphasis on news, fxjl- itics, and city government. If there were failures (and there were), if there were people in the arts and culture communi- ties who were sometimes less than en- thralled (and I was sometimes one of them), I can at the same time attest to the fact that Horton knew a good arts piece when she saw one: Under her watch, the Weekly won AAN's best arts feature award four years running— an award voted on by the likes of John Leland, Emily Eakin, Raymond Sokolov, Evgenia Peretz, and Abe Peck. In any case, cov- ers aren't everything: When I started at the paper in 1995, the arts section averaged 6 pages weekly; under Horton it increased to 9 or 10 and sometimes 11 pages— much to the annoyance of the news editor. Laurie Ochoa has indeed brought a welcome new energy and sensi- bility to the Weekly, but what she inherited was what most people agree was already the best alternative weekfy in the country Tom Christie Arts editor KIND OF BLUE THANKS FOR THAT GREAT, HEART- rending article on the Dod|gers [\"Art- less Dodgers,\" April]. It's been so long since I've been excited by the Dodgers. Just thinking about the Piazza trade still makes my blood boil. Karros seems like the last man standing. So much has changed. Jesse Katz's article really cap- tured a feeling of loss, of something that was truly great and now is no longer ours. Dorrin Bode Mar Vista WHAT I TOOK AWAY FROM READ- ing \"Artless Dodgers\" is that the city of Los Angeles loves a winner. As the team strives to build on last year's suc- cesses, all of us wiU again be reminded of the pride and tradition that is Dodgers baseball. Soon, I hope. Kent A. Whitaker Newcostle, Maine ITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO JESSE Katz and Don Newcombe, Don . was not the first African American pitch- ing star in the major leagues. In 1948, be- fore Newcombe joined the Dodgers, the Cleveland Indians signed a \"rookie\" who won six games down the stretch to help them win the pennant. This gendeman, who may have been one of Newcombe's childhood heroes, is now in the Hall of Fame. His name is Leroy \"Satchel\" Paige. Goldy Norton Los Angeles The editors respond: During two decades in the Negro Leagues, Satchel Paige estab- lished himself as one of the greatest pitchers in baseball history, but by the time he signed a major league contract in 1948 he was over 40 and hardly the ace of the Indians' staff. Don Newcombe, who signed with the Dodgers in 1949, is the only player ever to have won all three of baseball's coveted awards: Rook- ie of the Tear, Most Valuable Player, and the Cy Tbung.

I Ic'd con- sidered applying before, but the last presidential election cemented his re- solve. \" There were a lot of us sitting around — a couple of Canadians, a couple of Brits, a couple of Aus- tralians— lamenting the situation that was unfolding. We said, 'We've got to make sure we can vote next time.' \" I le warms to the topic the way he usually can be heard cozying up to bands. \"Clearly, when a group of people get to- gether, they create momentum and can make a difference.\" 1 larcourt has visited Franklin Roosevelt's I lyde Park birthplace, but the Reagan era conjures up the less remote world of his ear- ly twenties, long before he became the most powerful arbiter of new music in Southern California. At the time he was lead singer of a rock band called Red Cas- sette, which played outsiile Birmingham. \"I had a lot of energv. I used to bounce around onstage,\" says Har- court, his slender frame tightlv c()ilc<l in black jeans and a red, white, an<l blue knit shirt. \"The first few gigs we played I think we were drunk. After that we began to t;ike it seriously\" Red Cassette cut a demo that, like so many of the demos he listens to now, was destined for nowhere. Har- court can empathize with the acts that flood his KCRW mailbox with CDs, and the others that reach out to him in more immediate ways. In restaurants, at clubs, or on the street, I larcourt \"s sonorous Brit delivery gives him away. \"They'll pop their head ;iround the comer and say. Are you . . . ?' And that's okay In many cases ' they follow up by handing me a CD, which is also fine.\" For struggling bands and solo acts, Flarcourt's decision to cue up their homemade demo or indie re- lease and play it alongside Air, Semison- ic, Kinla; Stew, or Frank Sinatra on his 9 . a.m.-tn-noon show might just mean the L.A.

I larcourt 's early discovery of David Gray and Coldplay preceded their first platinum albums. At the Reagan library, I larcourt stops to admire a presidential place setting. In an enormous photo, the first lad\\' keeps a delighted eye on the presidenrial pastry chef A recorded voice sets the stage for some bygone diplomatic dirmer: \"Mrs. Reagan is wearing an organza dress for the occasion. The first lady says she is a mood dresser, one who selects her gown at the last minute.\" \"I'd go to a dinner at the White House if they asked me,\" Marcourt says. \"I just hope they would have something vegetarian.\" Lindsey Poulin, a pleas- ant Reagan library intern as- signed as tagalong, breaks m the bad news: \"I think they ft ser\\'e a lot of veal.\" \"I don't eat meat or fish,\" he says. \"I eat organic eggs, but I'm not a fascist about it.

It's Australian for beer, mate, and its name isn't Foster's. A crisp and inex- pensive lager in a green can, Victoria Bitter is a favorite down under, where it's affectionately known as VB, but it's impossible to find here. Carlton & United Breweries makes the beer in Australia but has decided to focus on promoting Foster's, another of its brands, in the States. The problem, say expats, is that the Foster's sold here is brewed in Canada and tastes weaker than VB (even though it's not). VB's only avenue into this country is in your luggage or through diplomats, who can arrange to buy it duty-free. What with the Aussie invasion of Hollywood, last year L.A.'s Australian consulate surmised that the promise of a little VB might elevate its soirees to A-list af- fairs. \"It's an extra incentive to get Aussies at parties,\" says Helen Pike, the personal assistant to the consul general and, more important, the per- son in charge of VB requisition.

It is more like bushwhacking, like barreling up rocky es carpmcnts on all tours and sliding down sandy gulches on your rear, like trying to catch a billy goat. I liking with the Sixes is not really what comes to mind when you think of the Sierra Club. It is more like what you expect from the X-Games or Survivor or boot camp. Hiking with the Sixes is not really about communing with nature. It is more like turning nature into a StairMaster. Every Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday— in heat and in cold, in light and in darkness — the Sierra Club's An- geles chapter hosts a free two-hour hike at 7 p.m. in the hills of Griffith Park. It is a tradition now in its 4irh vear. one ot those secret Los Angeles rituals that defies the mjth of a city without community, of a cit)' too obsessed with luxury cars and cell phones and plastic surgery to go for a walk in the woods. In the beginning there was only slow, medium, and fast to choose from. But in the 1990s, as the crowds began to swell, the club devised a more nuanced system, ranking its hikes on a scale ot one to six. Several hundred people show up most nights; only 10 to 20 dare to be Sixes. The first time I tried to be a Six, I was politely, but tlrmly, rejected. No rookie should ever go beyond a Three or a Four, I was told. \"The Sixes have been known to get a little carried away,\" says Ron Brusha, a retired U.S. Army engineer who has been taking these hikes since 1979. 1 was handed a brochure that described the cri- T! ■ HE LOVE CHILD of Walt Disney and Steve Jobs might have envisioned a place like Fry's. Since 1985 the Fry family of Silicon Valley has filled its electronics superstores — 1 6 and count- ing—with fanciful sets, props, and dio- ramas devoted to themes lilie Mayan astronomers and the Wild West. Its six Southern California outlets are especially over-the- top. In Anaheim, customers file through a NASA flight deck; in Manhattan Beach, tiki heads and a tropical rain forest tower over a display of Bose speakers. Burbank features giant irradi- ated ants and the big-brained aliens ; from the Mars Attacks! comic books. The most recent Fry's — a \"salute to the industrial Revolution,\" sans the soot and sweatshops— opened in February, ap- propriately enough in City of Industry. Eric Christensen, a veteran of the prop shop at Industrial Light and Magic, de- signed the place, as well as every other Fry's. Drawing from Charlie Chaplin's Modem Times and the murals of Diego GEOGRAPHIA Home Fry's Rivera, he created the interior's giant cogs, turbines, and conveyor belts, at a fi- nal cost of more than $1 million. Theme ideas come directly from CEO John Fry and his partners. \"[Fry] will tell me, 'We're going to do ancient Egypt,' \" says Chris- tensen. \"So I go to Egypt and look around for ideas.\" Fry's at- tempts to match the themes to the store's locale (Burbank and B movies, for example), but some ideas ate odd fits. Why Roman ruins in Fountain Valley? Headquarters is tight-lipped about the selection process. 'That's what the partners wanted,\" is all that company spokesperson Manuel Valerio will reveal. Despite notoriously surly service (as detailed on numerous \"Fry's sucks\" Web sites), hordes of loyal fans continue to mob the outlets — a constant design con- cern for Christensen. \"The stuff you build for movies is very flimsy,\" he says.

A few yciirs back, a hiker got separated from his group and had to be guided down the trail by a helicopter with searchlights. Doggett was suspend- ed for six months. \"People say, 'Don't go with Peter, he's crazy, you're going to hurt yourself,' \" says Doggett, who insists he was unfairly blamed for the mishap. With a Five under mv belt— and a pair of new hiking boots, with enough traction for a lunar assault, on my feet— the Sixes could no longer deny me. 1 )oggett suggested a 1,000-foot ascent to a stone outcropping known as the Bal- cony \"It's like where only eagles dare,\" he announced giddily Ariagno interceded. \"Peter's a very nice man, but— I don't know if I should be saying this to a re- porter—but, well, he lacks a little bit of judgment about certain leadership skills.\" Under .'Kriagno's guidance, we em- barked on a safer, though no less strenu- ous, route called the Goat Trail, pulling ourselves up a slipper\\' chute ot eroded earth and gravel. Crisscrossing from Ra- zorback to Serpentine to Cactus I^dge, we scurried over boulders and charged down gullies, dodging poison oak and exposed water pipes, with onlv the toggy glow of a distant city to illuminate our path. Most of the time I was breathing too hard to even talk, which pretty much defeats the social and romantic possibil- ities that the majorir\\' of Griffith Park hikers cite as their incentive. Doggett, though, was far from satisfied.

He died March 29, at age 71. A poem of his, engraved on a wall on the Venice boardwalk, contained this summary of his life: \"Even the barrel of my pen is lull of the ghosts of uncouth poets.\" A raconteur, generator of epigrams and tall talcs, and symbol of much that separates L.

Born in Baltimore, Thomas cited early visits with Ezra Pound as decisive. Migrating west in mifilifc. he carried Pound's commitment to pure and clear poetic knowledge — in con- trast to the reigning Beat focus on self-expression and inspiration — into an open, raucous (California mi- lieu. Internationally recognized L.A. poet Wanda Ck)leman has called him \"my first real teacher.\" Longtime friend C'harles Bukowski regarded Thomas as his equal. Poet and edi- tor Paul Vangelisti, who spent hours with Thomas and published much of his early work, says, \"All of us chose him over Bukowski,\" the far more renowned poet. Bearing influences as diverse as ancient Chinese p<H;t Li Po, mcnlem philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, and his own stint as an air force crypy- tographer, Thomas collected things— both objects and quotes — incessantly, dispensing them to those in need. \"When we were talking about Vietnam, people getting beaten in the streets, the absurdities of Hollywood, all the nonsense,\" Vangelisti says, \"John used to get up and say, 'It is not un- believable. It happened. It requires no lielief ' \" I'or Thomas, the fascination of the 20th centurv was to watch people, big and small, work out \"false ideas,\" often monstrously. Thomas's poems mixed direct address, uncluttered language, and a vast and learned imagination with what he phrased \"delicate perversion.\" \"He was a gadfly in a time of self-mythologies,\" Vangelisti says. \"John made us understand that what's going on inside the mind can have nothing to do with what's going on outside. John made no bones.\" Povert)' and love were equ;J teachers in a life of wisdom. Thomas dedicatetl his last poems to Philomene Long, the poet, writer, and film- maker he married, ;ind was inseparable from, in the hist, bone-aching years of their lives together It was for these works that 'ITiomas said he wanted to Ik- remembered. In the conclusion of his Venice bo;irdw;ilk poem, the ghosts of uncouth poets form \"the bitter crackling sound I hear / when Philomene brushes her hair. / In case you wondered, / they are the small transparent parasols / all of us stroll beneath.\" —Fred Dewey FINE LINES: Reading in Venice in i p/o 2 8 I.

In 1986 the Museum of Contempwrary Art opKned its Grand Avenue temple, designed by Arata Isozaki. A decade later the Getty Richard Meier's masterpiece, created one million square feet of new research and gallery space, the equivalent of five Guggen- heim Bilbaos. Soon after, the L. A. County Museum of Art acquired the adjacent May Company building at Wilshire and Fairfax, a copper-and-travertine ode to big-city shopping. And earlier this year the county museum— or more precisely, Eli Broad— adopted the proposal of enigmatic Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas to raze 'William Pereira's kitschy albatross and replace it with a S200 million zeppelin. The Cali- fornia Science Center, the last great exhi- bition hall to hold its ground in Exposition Park, where the county museum resided before its retreat to Wilshire Boulevard, is about to undergo a S140 million face-lift. The Los Angeles Architecture + Design Museum op)ened in January The growing stature of the city's exhibit halls coincides with the growing stature of California art. The UCLA Hammer Museum presented Pacific Dreams, on California's largely for- gptten \"pKJStsurrealists.\" LACMA weighed in with Made m California. MOCA showed Ed Kienholz's L.A.-steeped sculpture in Kienho/z. A Retrospective. It is as if Los Angeles awakened and discovered itself on the West Coast. But something has gone missing. The Getty, despite Meier's nearly perfect evo- cation of a Renaissance piazza, hovers over the city like an archangel, exquisite yet ethereally inaccessible. With Koolhaas as its demiurge, LACMA has explicitly global ambitions to loft itself out of the shadow of the Getty and, [lerhaps, right out firom under Los Angeles. For all the apparent turning inward, the California art scene has only gotten a glance. That may soon change.

Financed by local art collectors Robert and Arlene Oltman, the S5 million mu- seum is housed in a new three- story plaster-and-limestone building one block off Colo- rado Boulevard in the center of Pasadena's bustling urban scene. Taking their cues from the light and space artist and L.A. native James Turrell, Culver City architects Steve Johnson and Jim Favaro have constructed a stack of open- air loggias, tied together by an undulating, Gaudi'-esque indoor-outdoor staircase capped by an oculus that admits a piece of the sky into the building. Behind those spaces are the second-floor galleries, a bookstore, and a community room. The io,ooo-square-foot ground floor, present- ly configured for parking, is slated to become a gallery for large-scale works. The top level contains an L-shaped, 5,000-square-foot residence for the Oltmans and a public roof terrace with expansive views of the San Gabriels and the dome of Pasadena City Hall. The museum seems to have come out of nowhere. Robert Oltman, 63, was a practicing architect who amassed a small fortune throu^ Space Bank Mini Storage, which he cofounded in 1977. Thirty years ago he and his wife, Ariene, 62, started buying American paintings, slowly assembling a collection specializing in late-igth- and early-20th-century works by such land- scape and plein air painters as Conrad Buff Edgar Payne, and William Wendt but ex- panded to include artists like Bay Area figura- tive painter (and Latvia's most famous play- wright) Raimonds Staprans. It's a respectable if narrowly focused collection, but it hardly puts them in the league of a Peter NortoiL The couple originally planned to take the empty land they owned on Union Street in Pasadena's Playhouse district and build a home atop some kind of commercial com- plex. The idea of living in downtown com- motion morphed into PMCA, which was fu-st conceived as a private space to display their 300 paintings. That notion, too, had to change, since to maintain tax-free status the museum had to offer educational exhibits open to the public. Remarkably, the Oltmans agreed to provide the museum operating ex- penses, roughly $500,000 annually, for five years. Both the building and the collection, which they own, vitU remain in their hands, eventually to be given to PMCA. \"There is no museum in Southern Cali- fornia totally dedicated to all of the art forms,\" says Robert Oltman. \"I think we are pre- senting the time line of California art. It is a venue for seeing how, to put this in really overly simple terms, historical movements affect conteniporar\\- movements. It's fasci- nating to me to look back and see historical painters doing things that, if you look closely you're amazed at how contemporary it is.\" PMCA will inaugurate its 8,000-square- foot gallery with On-Ramps: Transitional Moments in CalifomiaArt, an exhibition spot- lighting four pivotal 20th-century schools. The modest show of approximately 100 works has four independent curators: \"Impressionism to Post- Impressionism\" was put together by Nancy Moure, the author of the definitive CalifbrniaArt, Michael Duncan, a critic for Art in America, dealt with \"Post Surrealism\"; Peter Frank, anLA. Weekly arts writer, assembled \"Hard PIdge Abstraction to Finish Fetish\"; and Thomas Solomon, who owned the gallery Tom Solomon's Garage, tackled \"Bay Area Conceptualism.\" \"The exhibition is designed to be an in- troduction of the museum to Southern Cali- fornia,\" says PMCA director Wesley Jessup. Jessup, 32, is an art historian who worked at the Guggenheim in New York and was assis- tant director of the Spencer Museum of Art at the University of Kansas before coming to Pasadena. \"We want to show the variety of work in California, the variety of styles his- torically, and the variety of media. From oil and canvas and sculpture, which are very convenrional, to the Bay Area conceptualists, who moved beyond boundaries. For exam- ple, there is a sandpile. There are 40 loaves of bread painted red. One piece lives inside and outside the gallery The gallery space is really challenged. When jjeople leave, I want them to leave with the idea of the rich variety of work and a sense of the experimentation in California art.\" i MOST MAJOR CITIES, LIKE ' New York and Paris, have \"city\" museums. A California art museum is, in a way long overdue. It is one more chance to help define ourselves in the shifting, inefiable place where . we live. \"Being grounded in a place and un- derstanding its past,\" Duncan says, \"is a clue to the future and a clue to the present.\" True enough. But are Ed Ruscha's sardonic puns, in paintings like Hollywood and Norms, La Genega, on Fire, purely local, or an East Coast sensibility — pop art — done to an L.A. tee? DoClyfford Still's color-field paintings have anything to do with San Francisco, where he lived and taught? Or are they more closely related to the effort of Barnett Newman, Still's good friend and the quintes- sential New 'Vbrk painter, to make a canvas radiate with the pure expression of the sub- lime? It is a tricky business to claim art as an | extension of one place at one time. ' The PMCA arrives, perhaps, at an esjje- cially fortunate moment. \"Right now,\" says Michael Dawson, the owner of L.A.'s oldest bookstore specializing in California history and the curator of his eponymous gallery on Larchmont, \"we arc riding this crest of all things Southern California. We are defining ourselves for the 21st century, and we want to know everything about the past, after com- pletely ignoring it. Hopefiilly, there is a con- tinuing audience for it.\" To succeed, the new museum must con- front the tendency of bigger institutions, such as LACMA and MOCA, to dismiss Cali- fornia art as \"regional.\" PMCA must also grapple with the diminishing but still widely held belief, pungently enunciated in 1974 by Peter Plagens in Sunshine Muse, that California has never been the crucible of great modem art: \"The West Coast art world has lamented ... a never-was forest of great oaks and wondered aloud when one would grow. Perhaps (to continue the strained metaphor) ours will always be a seasonal garden of odd little plants.\" \"We've always shied away from the term 'regionalism,' \" says Susan Ehrlich, an art his- torian at Loyola Marymount University and the curator of the Hammer's jR/f{^rDn?</»M. I CULTURE Regional doesn't always mean provincial, Ehrlich says. It can mean freedom to toss aside the fixed language of established art movements. \"California has something to add, a countcrviiiling voice,\" she argues, and that's where PMCA fits in. Unlike the East Coast abstract expressionists, for instance, California artists were \"less tough and ag- gressive and angry. It might be cliche, but there is some truth in it: Lifestyles were eas- ier. There were visions of beaut); lyrical na- ture visions, an alternative to abstract expres- sionism on the East Coast.\" Inclutling in an j exhibition like On-Riinijis the surreal visions of Helen Lundebcrg and the methodical geometry of Frederick I lamnierslev, lx)th of whom were influenced by the flat light and youthtiil ebullience of L.A., might help situ- ate Ciilifornia art. The trouble is that there might not be enough compelling work to sustmn a mascum whose mission is conspicuously regiomil. And regional can become \"capricious.\" A maseum, in effect, c;in turn into a boutique, reflecting the {X\"culi;ir tastes of its donors and st;iff ITiis, i as some critics have noted, is what happened J f N n 200: /. O S A N C E I. i .S 3 S c ■I C U LT U R E to the Irvine Museum, with its focus on California impressionists. Another danger, as Ehrlich points out, is that the PMCA emerges as \"an academy where the art is chosen to prove a theory\" ITiis was the chief criticism of LACMA's Made in California exhibition two years ago: that it squeezed vastly different visual experiences into pre- conceived, politically charged themes. Thus was the moody Elmer Bischoff paired wdth upbeat fashion designer Rudi Gernreich and the modernist aesthetician Lorser Feitel- son lumped together with the blacklisted Hollywood Ten because he spoke out against McCarthyism. \"I think we can avoid these problems,\" Jessup says. \"You don't see the name Oltman anywhere in this museum, even though they live right upstairs. Their collection isn't on dispky It isn't even part of the museum, for now. And On-Ramps is an exhibition that avoids an explicit theme.\" What's more, board members like Mary Norris, who also sits on the board of the Southern California Institute of Architecture and was involved in starting MOCA, will help give the new mu- seum ballast. THE KEY TO PMCA IS ITS SIZE and the absence of a core collec- tion. It is a Kunsthalle, an exhibi- tion hall that is \"unencumbered,\" says Paul Karlstrom, of the Smithsonian Archives of American Art and the curator of a forthcoming Staprans exhibition at PMCA. \"It is a virtue not to have a collection. Tradi- tional museums, even those that deal with contemporary art, put much of their energy into building a collection. This museum can focus on building exhibitions.\" Unlike big museums that have to put on extravaganzas to attract big crowds, the PMCA, while not actively avoiding stellar names, can draw smaller audiences to smaller exhibits and still pay the bills. \"It will be a good venue for shows other museums won't take a chance with,\" says Ilene Susan Fort, a chief curator of Made in California, who is working on an Edward Bibcrman retrospec- tive for PMCA. It is a sad fact, as Plagens has observed, that serious art in America is \"a social luxury, propped up by rich jjcople.\" The new mu- seum will need more than the generous purse of the Oltmans— which, in any event, is due to close sometime in 2005. PMCA will need hard currency, and to get that it will have to go out into a marketplace that is teeming with mendicants and may soon run dry when LACMA swings into fiiU-time fund-raising to finance its Koolhaas. Jessup plans to tap corporate and foundation money He intends to keep overhead low, by limiting his staff to six and by bringing in traveling exhibits, like the Oakland Museum's Capturing Light: Masterpieces of California Photography, 18^0-2002 and the San Jose Museum of Art's Not So Still Life: A Century of California Painting and Sculpture. Like the indejjendent curators he has recruited to assemble the mu- seum's inaugural show, he hopes that the choices they've made will draw patrons —at S5 a head. \"Theyll be cautious at first, but if the artistic community and the philanthrcpists can see that this isn't a vanity museum,\" says Fort, \"hopefully theyll be encouraged to give.\" Keeping its doors open, of course, will be one clear measure of success. The more elusive measure will be how much PMCA can become a home for silent contemplation, a place where art will be free to surprise and confound, as much apart from the region as in it.

O S A N C, h: L E S } V S t 2 0 0 2 Cci Fast Times at Poly High At A SCHOOL LONG KNOWN FOR TURNING OUT FAMOUS ATHLETES, THE PRIMACY OF Don Norford's track program is academic by David Davis THE AFTERNOON WIND HAS kicked up, turning the ancient cinder track at Long Beach Poly High into a dust bowl. Fine brown sand swirls through the air as dozens of runners labor down the back- stretch, their bodies straining against the coastal breeze. Coach Don Norford watches their exertions and chuckles. This is what we call Poly weather,\" he says. \"This is what makes us champions.\" Since taking over the track program in 1989, Norford has shaped the girls team into a dynasty Last season the Jackrabbits whipped archrival Long Beach Wilson to win the state crown— their sixth in ten years. (The boys team has won it twice during that span.) This year the girls, led by sophomore sprinters Shalonda Solomon, Jasmine Lee, and Chanda Picott, are favored to repeat. \"We want to live up to the Poly name,\" says Picott, \"and go for four in a row.\" On this windy day, Norford outfits the trio with weighted vests and directs them to the infield to work on their starts. It's the most technical aspect of sprinting, de- manding equal parts explosive reaction, balance, and precision footwork. In a 100- meter race, which top hi^ school gjils typ- ically run in just under 12 seconds, a good start can mean the difference between win- ning and finishing fourth. The three students alternate, with Solomon leading off She wiggles into her stance before bursting from the blocks with a grunt. I^c is battling a cold she caught when the team competed in New York City; she coughs and wheezes all through the workout. Even so, she is the smoothest of the bunch, slipping effordessly into full stride. Picott makes her starts with dainty steps that belie her power. Being teenagers, they also fiddle with their spikes, fix their hair, and chat inter- minably while stretching. Anything but practice. \"Fire out those first three steps,\" Norford barks. \"iVlake those blocks ratde.\" He cannot hide his pride, however 'These girls'll test you every step of the way,\" he says. \"But if you stick with 'em, if you let them know you're there for them, they'll run right as rain.\" * * * LONG BEACH POLYTECHNIC IS THE state's hig^ school sports poweriiouse. Com- bined, its teams have won 19 California Interscholastic Federation titles, ranking first all-time. No other hig^ school has pro- duced as many NFL players, quarterback turned wide receiver Gene Washington and defensive end Willie McGinest among them. Tennis great Billie Jean King went there. So did future baseball Hall of Famer Tony Gwynn. Poly sits in a gritty part of Long Beach just east of the Los Angeles River. Founded in 1895, the school was rebuilt after the 1933 earthquake destroyed the original build- ing. The compwct campus can scarcely con- tain its 4,600 students. But as the largest 3 8 LOS ANGELES JINE 2002 PHOTOGRAPHS BY MOJGAN B. AZIMi n BUCCELLArr REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE 9500 VVILSHIRE BLVD. BEVERLY HILLS. CA 90212 310 • 276 • 7022 high school in the state's third-largest school district, it enables Norford to draw from a wide talent pool. Agrandfatherly man whose ample belly is a testament to his wife's cooking, the 55- year-old Norford jjeers through jierpetually crooked glasses. He favors baggy jeans and bulky sweatshirts, and his hair is more salt than pepper. Everybody who stops by the decrepit track takes time to greet him; even the ninth graders address him as \"Don\" or \"Coach Don.\" Norford has devoted his life to Poly. When his parents migrated to Long Beach, part of the post-World War II exodus of AfHcan Americans firom the South, they set- ded around the comer from the school. He and his buddies grew up watching meets along what's now called Martin Luther King Boulevard. Afterward they'd scramble onto the track, which was gravel back then, and fling themselves into the sawdust that served as the long-jump pit. \"You couldn't wait to be a Polyjackrabbit when you were a kid,\" he s^. This place has mystique.\" He played football and ran with the track team, which won the state championship his senior year. It was 1964, the last gasp before racial strife, drugs, gangs, and reduced pub- lic-education spending would ravage Poly and many other inner-city high schools. According to journalist and alum Don Wallace, who is writing a book about the school. Poly \"went into a tailspin. The area developed a reputa- tion as a ghetto.\" In time \"a line was drawn,\" says coprin- cipal Mel Collins. \"The administration said, 'We will not tolerate negative behavior, continued negative grades, disrespect.' You know what.' 'ITie kids responded.\" Today Poly boasts an open enrollment policy and two magnet schools (one in international com- merce and languages, the other a college prep program). Newsweek has ranked it among the top 100 public high schools in the coun- try academically It's also become a model of diversity Long gone are the days when whites were the over- whelming majority Nearly a third of the stu- dents are Asian (primarily Cambodian and Vietnamese), followed by African Americans, Latinos, whites, and Pacific Islanders. Sports' importance in the Poly culture is evident as soon as you walk through the front doot A floor-to-ceiling gjass case occupies the entry, bursting with gold and silver trophies. McGinest's New England Patriots uniform is displayed, as is Stanford quarterback Chris Lewis's. There's nothing for two other famous grads, Cameron Diaz and Snoop Dogg. After stints in college and in business (the \"real world,\" as he says), Norford returned to Poly in 1976 to coach football. (He remains an assistant with the program.) But the for- mer sprinter gravitated to track and soon established himself as a speed sp>ecialist. One ofhis students, Andrea Anderson, won a gold medal in the 4-by-400 -meter relay at the 2000 Olympics. Many college and profes- sional football players who went to Poly come back during the off-season to train with him, hoping to improve their \"40\"— the ^o-yaid dash that NFL teams use to measure quick- ness. This year USC wide receiver Kareem Kelly worked out with Norford only days before spring practice. ALSO RAN: Even pros seek Coach Norford \"You can't teach talent,\" says Norford, \"but you can always improve speed. We teach them techniques, from perfecting the start to the way they move their arms, so they be- come power runners.\" His wife, Carol, who also attended the school (as did their three children), often cooks for the students and coaches, prepar- ing enormous spreads for meets outside California. \"Don and Carol open their home— their souls— to everyone,\" says as- sistant coach Rob Shock. \"It provides a great support system.\" As part of the \"Poly fam- ily,\" several renowned alumni help Norford train his charges. Olympic bronze medal- ist John Rambo (class of '61) tutors high jumpers. Norford's classmate Earl McCul- louch, who once owned the world record in the 100-meter hurdles (and later played wide receiver for the Detroit Lions), is at the track every afternoon to teach the timing and gait required for that event. \"If you've been a win- 40 LOS ANGELES JUNE 2002 aterial at M OCA r FRESH, ORIGINAL ART AND MUSIC FREE EVERY THURSDAY, 5-8PM.

Aware of the limited educational oppor- tunities for women of color, who receive only 25 percent of scholarships given to female ath- letes, Norford preaches the importance of academics to his students. Losing money raised from fish-fr)' dinners and barbecues, he takes his top runners to meets in New \"Vbrk, Texas, and Pennsylvania so more collc^ coaches can watch them. I^t year five of his eight grad- uating girls received Division I scholarships. \"I could run the girls harder,\" he S£^, \"but we want them to have something left for col- lege and beyond. Wfe don't ■ww.x them to f)eak here. Poly is just the first step for them.\" I le could be speaking about Crystal Irving. A Long Beach nati\\'e, she ran for Poly in the late '80s before setting records at the Univer- sity of Nevada, Las Vegas. She returned to the high school in 1997 to \"give something back.\" Irving has since become Norford's second in conunand. \"These days girls who are athletic have more choices,\" says Irving, who looks like she could still compete. \"Families now push their girls to make it.\" Keeping tabs on 150 boys and girls from under an ever-present visor, she is the most likely candidate to replace Norford when he retires. (Irving will become the girls ath- letic director this fall.) After a bout with diabetes hospitalized him last year, Norford began talking openly about an heir apparent. But he isn't ready to hang up his whistle yet- not with the talent he coaches daily, and not when he has the opportunity to perf)etuate the school's legend. AS THE GIRLS RACKKD UP victories during the spring, Norford downplayed their chances at the state meet, to be held May 31 and June i at Cerritos College. He told the L.A. Times that Poly doesn't de- serve to be ranked first in the paf)er's presea- son poll. (It rated them tops anyway.) He pointed out, correctly, that his team is young. I le observed, truthfuUv, that Long Beach NX^ilson and Rrs'erside North, which won the title in 1999 and 2000, are talent laden. He noted, accurately, that anything can happ)en, from injuries to dropped relay batons. That said, his team is loaded.

In honing his three sophomores, Norford coaches with dueling interests. On the one hand, he prepares them to race against one another in the individual events. They must also learn to run together, as a team, in the all-important relays. \"Com- petition will make them work harder,\" he says. \"It could be like Kareem [Kelly] and Darrell Rideaux\"— two former students— \"who pushed each other all the way to the state championship.\" Shalonda Solomon has emerged as the star. In her white Poly T-shirt and baggy warm-ups, her hair pulled back in small braids, she doesn't apjjear intimidating. But the lithe Solomon is powerful— she squats 265 pounds in the weight room— and compulsively com- petitive. During practice she refuses to let anyone beat her. She finished second in the ICQ and third in the 200 at states in 2001, an extraordinary feat for a freshman. She does everything fast— speaking, fidgeting, flirting with the guys. Norford calls her \"Speedy\" and likes to tease her, \"Can you ever stay stilP\" Before attending Poly, the 16-year-old Solomon ran for four years with the L.A. Jets, one of Southern California's many youth track clubs. She credits Norford with im- proving her concentration. \"Coach Don, he brings joy to me,\" she says. \"He's the one who, like, taught me how to use the starter's blocks. Now, after I key on my form, I can get out and run like I know how.\" Lee, whom everyone calls \"Jazz,\" ran briefly with the Perfect Harmony club. Last year she finished fifth in the 100 at the state meet Her hair tucked beneath a beaded black . bandanna, the 15-year-old is soft-spoken and polite. Rurming in Solomon's shadow might trouble a less confident competitor; but Lee in- sists that she isn't bothered. \"I see I'm getting better,\" she shrugs. \"I just want to run n^ best.\" Another longtime member of the Jets, the 15-year-old Picott has struggled the past two seasons with injuries related to a growth spurt. She is only now feeling healthy Although she runs with small, almost hesitant steps, the girl can motor. (Norford calls her \"Scooter.\") She says she chose to attend Poly because of its academic reputation. \"I have good grades,\" she says, smiling behind delicate glasses. \"I've always wanted to go to college, and I know that doing well in track might help me.\" NORFORD SCHEDULES early-season meets, from Pomona to Northridge, as tune-ups for the state cham- pionships. They can serve another purpose as well: As top dog. Poly must always be pre- pared to meet challenges firom other schools. So while Norford prefers the girls to round slowly into form, he's not averse to having them make a statement. At the annual Earl Engman Relays, held at Santa Ana Junior College, they do exacdy that during the 4-by-ioo relay The \"four-by- one,\" which pits the four festest sprinters from each school against one another, is all about machisma. It answers the most basic ques- tion in track: Who's the fastest of them all? Norford sends out his \"A\" team— the three sophs and freshman Shana Solomon, Shalonda's younger sister. They jog slowly onto the infield, then peel off their sweats to reveal their uniforms: gold shorts and white t£ink tops emblazoned with a green BiiACH. Shana leads off and opens a small gap on the gleaming, all-weather surface before she hands the baton to Picott, who bolts to give Poly breathing room. On the third leg, Lee pulls away from the pack before she passes to Shalonda at the far curve. Well ahead of the field, Solomon acceler- ates with a whoosh. Jaw set, arms churning, she runs as if the ground were made of hot coals. She flashes across the finish line and, careful not to appear winded, takes several deep breaths before joining her teammates. The girls hug briefly, put on their oversize green sweats, and saunter off as slowly as pos- sible. Their time is a jackrabbit-quick 46.9, breaking the old track record held by Long Beach Wilson. Coach Don allows a small smile. Message delivered. Ct^) Cc, PROMOTION ORDER YOUR TICKETS NOW! Los Angeles Magazine's TM 7th Annual Best of L.A.

In January, the Italian Trade Commission launched \"Life in T Style,\" a threeyear marketing campaign that promotes Italian fashion, home design and film through cultural and commercial events celebrating the ancient country's artistic heritage and craftsmanship, with the goal of introducing even more Americans to la dolce vita. The campaign's cultural kick-off, now showing at the Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA) at the Geffen Contemporary until September 22, 2002, is \"Zero to Infiniti: Arte Povera 1962-1972\", o retrospective organized by the Walker Art Center of Minneapolis and London's Tate Modern of one of Italy's most innovative post-industrial art movements. Photog[aphy: Counes/ of Italian Government Tourist Boaid SPECIAL ADVERTISING SECTION Arte Povera - artists' reaction to industrialization and technology using ephemeral materials like cardboard, wood, grains and plants, as well as marble, glass, silk and gold - \"has had a tremendous impact on contemporary artists today, not just In L.A. but in the world,\" notes MOCA curator Almo Ruiz, adding that some seminal works from this movement featured in the exhibit hove never before been seen in Los Angeles. Interest in Italy and all things Italian is so pervasive on the West Coast that Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACAAA), Art Center College of Design, the Museum of Crafts and Folk Art, and the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) have all held major exhibits (many of which were sponsored by the 20year-old Los Angeles-bcsed Italian Heritage Culture Foundation) of Italian art, crafts, and industrial and automotive design over the past 40 years. One particularly active vehicle for the dissemination of \"la dolce vita\" is the Italian Cultural Institute's Spazio Italia gallery, which annually hosts 7 exhibitions of young and emerging Italian artists, designers ond architects, in addition to a highly popular film program. On a recent April showing of \"Unfair Competition\", a film by legen- dary director Ettore Scola, \"We had to turn away people,\" confesses Spazio Italia ca curator Giovanna Zamboni-Paulis, who added that Italion Institute events draw more Americans than Italians. Italian design also draws crowds at UCLA: According to Nathan Shapiro, professor emeritus of design, the university's most popular class was \"FHistory of Italian cinema\" taught by Professor Cechetti, UCLA was also the first American university to introduce a course in the history of Italian design, some of whose students have gone on to work for such preeminent Italian industrial designers as Ettore Sottsass Jr. One needs no better example of Italian home design than Snaidero, Cassina, Poliform, Donghia, and Poggenpohl (all available through Pacific Design Center), which offer comfortably minimalist kitchens and furniture combining form, function and technology in keeping with the times. Unlike other major cities like New York, Boston or San Francisco, Los Angeles has no Little Italy neighborhood where citizens sample the delights of the Italian cuisine and lifestyle. It is, nonetheless, a highly visible advertisement for Italian style. At last year's Academy Awards, a stunning Julia Roberts accepted her Oscar for best actress in a leading role swathed in a stunning black and white vintage Valentino gown. This year, she presented Denzel Washington with the award for best actor in a leading role poured into a striking black Giorgio Armani sheath cut out at the shoulders and legs.

A case in point: This past March, beauties such as Jodie Foster, Helen Mirren, and Laura Elena Herring strode down the Academy Awards red carpet in Armani, while Jennifer Lopez and Sharon Stone revealed luscious curves in Versace, Sandra Bullock and Reese Witherspoon shone in Valentino, and Cameron Diaz radiated in a floral Ungaro. Armani (who, in the 1980s, revolutionized Oscars fashion by dressing Jodie Foster and Michelle Pfeiffer in sober sheaths and pantsuits in sharp contrast with the garish designs of the time) garnered many of the mole nominees and presenters, from Robert Redford and Sidney Poitier to Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe, while other attendees wore Gucci and Prado and songwriter Randy Newman looked every part the winner in bespoke Brioni.

They are perfect for us.\" Martens also points to the quality of the goods, so outstanding that many American and European fashion houses and shoe designers like Calvin Klein, Burberry, Ralph Lauren Purple Label, Manolo Blahnik and Christion Louboutin have some, or most, of their products manufactured in Italy. Dotted around town, more fashion designers beckon commoners and stars alike. In Beverly Hills, in addition to the usual suspects Prada, Gucci, Armani, Frette et tutti quanti, II Bisonte offers leather goods and clothing to the elite and Avant Garde presents Cividini and other Italian designers. On Melrose Avenue, Costume National's sleek, form-fitting designs appeal to toned stars like Tom Cruise. On Beverly Boulevard, former fashion stylist and costume designer Elisabetta Rogiano lures shapely beauties like Salma Hayek, Milla Jovovich, and Lucy Liu with her one-of-a- kind \"new vintage\" designs from bridal ond evening dresses to active wear and bikinis. \"Italian designers break the rules,\" says Rogiano. \"There is a competition with yourself and others to find new shapes, a drive to do better.\" The same principle applies to every realm of Italian design, including jewelry. The Italian Trade Commission attributes the success of Italian jewelry to several factors: First, it is hand-mode and hand-finished with the highest quality row materials; second, by maintaining small production centers, most jewelry manufacturers are able to keep a close eye on the purity and craftsmanship of their goods; third, Italian gold casting has a smoother finish and greater resiliency; finally, Italian jewelers combine the most technology advanced manufacturing methods with a traditional methodology born from a tradition dating bock to the Etruscans. Some 35% of Italy's gold and jewelry production is exported to the United States, and it's not much of a stretch to assume that Los Angeles comprises a prime market. Known for its contemporary designs and cabochon jewelry made with diamonds and colored stones, Bvlgari is a major player in the entertainment industry, sponsoring high-profile events such as the recent Stars 2001 gob RESTAURANT 8c BAR BKVKRI.Y HIl.LS Fine Northern Italian Cuisine.

Building on its own celebrity connection, Damiani lias enlisted actor Brad Pitt to design an exclusive collection, while his wife Jennifer Aniston will appear in Damiani's fall 2002 international advertising campaign (she will not be seen in the United States). AAeanwhile, ensconced in its shoebox boutique in the Regent Beverly Wilshire hotel, Buccellatti continues to lure visitors with exquisitely engraved jewelry in gold, precious and semi-precious stones inspired by periods from the Renaissance to French Rococo. And on a trendier note, the Italian jeweler Italargento is sweeping LA with his unique charm bracelets that have been seen on fHolle Berry and Madonna. Bedecked in all of their Italian finery, Angelenos are starting to parade around town perched atop adorable Vespa scooters in mouthwatering colors like frosted green and baby blue. The hallmark of Italian youth, Vespa has opened two stores in the Los Angeles area - in Sherman Oaks and Santo Monica - within only nine months of each other. \"From FHollywood's elite to the average American, the cult of Vespa remains relevant,\" soys Pioggio USA president Gioncario Fantoppie. \"Since open-ing our first Vespa boutique late last year, already we have satisfied a celebrity list that includes Jerry Seinfeld, Jay Leno, Sting and Steven Speilberg.\" Several of the above, and many more, are also devotees of sleek, sexy and speedy Italian cars. Every year on Father's Day, the Concours on Rodeo showcases 1 GO of the most beautiful vintage automobiles in the world, drawing over 60,000 visitors to Vicini the three blocks of Rodeo Drive between Santa Monica and Wilshire Boulevards closed off to traffic for the occasion. The largest crowds ore usually seen around the Ferrari and Italian cars. \"They ore by far the biggest draw,\" says organizer Andy Cohen. The owner of the Beverly FHills Classic Collection automobile showroom on Robertson Boulevard, Cohen sells a variety of high- end cars including Mercedes, Porsche, Ferrari, Lamborghini and Maserati and says that the Italian cars are always the most popular. People buy a car for emotional reasons, he explains. \"Italian cars always have the best design, both interior and exterior. Combine that with excellent handling and performance, limited production (Ferrari sells only 1000 cars in the U.S. each year, compared with 200,000 cars for Mercedes), astronomical prices (from $90,000 for the new Maserati Spider to over $275,000 for the Ferrari AAercielego), and you've got a winner.\" [Oh, and by the way - cliches of the flashy red Ferrari notwithstanding, the most popular colors for Italian cars are muted silver, gray, black and blue. ] Frank Gehry himself, architect of the much-admired Getty Center and Bilbao museum, has spoken of the influence of Italian architect Bruno Zevi on his work. No doubt in years to come, more Los Angeles artists, designers and architects will look to Italy for inspiration, while growing numbers of elegant Angelenos will adopt Italian designers' surefire recipe for elegance and success. In the words of UCLA's Shapiro, \"Art interrupts reality and design improves it. Italian design does both.\" ?4 LOS A.NGELES JUNE 2002 ale iaI SPECIAL ADVERTISING SECTION LA Dolce Vita resource guide Alessi Ristorante & Bar 6602 Melrose Ave., Los Angeles (323) 935-1197 Avant Garde 9612 Brighton Way, Beverly Hills (310) 55CH)105 Beverl/ Hills Classic Collection 209 Soutti Robertson Blvd., Beverly Hills (310) 360-6900 Brioni 337 North Rodeo Dr., Beverly Hills (310) 271-1300 Buccellati 9500 Wilshire Blvd., Beverly Hills (310) 276-7022 Bvlgari 250 North Rodeo Dr., Bevedy Hills (310) 858-9216 Ciao Trattoria 81 5 West 7th St., Los Angeles (213) 624-2244 Costume National 8001 Melrose Ave., Los Angeles (323) 655-8160 Damiani Avoiloble at Dejoun Jewelers 14006 Riverside Dr. #35A, Shetmcn Ooks (818) 783-3960 Avoiloble of: Westime 10800 West Pico Blvd., Los Angeles (310) 470-1388 Ermenegildo Zegna 301 North Rodeo Dr., Bevedy Hills (310) 247-8827 Frette 459 North Rodeo Dr., Bevedy Hills (310) 273-8540 Georgio Armani 436 North Rodeo Dr., Beverly Hills (310) 271-5555 Gucci 347 North Rodeo Dr., Beverly Hills (310) 278-3451 II Bisonte 409 North Camden Dr., Beverly Hills (310) 275-3261 Italian Cultural Institute 1023 HilgardAve,, Beverly Hills (310) 443-3250 Italian Government Tourist Board 1 2400 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 550, Los Angeles (310) 820-0098 Italian Trade Commission 1 801 Avenue of the Stars, Suite 700, Los Angeles (323) 879-0950 LA Dolce Vita Ristorante 9785 Little Santo Monico Blvd., Bevedy Hills (310) 278-1845 MOCA 250 South Grand Ave., Los Angeles (213) 621-2766 My Philosophy/ltalargento, Inc. 2170 Century Pork Eost, Suite 1606, Los Angeles (310) 552-1600 Neiman Marcus Beverly Hills 9700 Wilshire Blvd., Bevedy Hills (310) 550-5900 Pacific Design Center 8687 Melrose Ave., Los Angeles (310) 657-0800 Prado 469 North Rodeo Dr., Beverly Hills (310) 385-5959 Saks Fifth Avenue 9600 Wilshire Blvd., Beverly Hills (310) 275-421 1 Tanino 1043 Westwood Blvd., Los Angeles (310) 208-0444 Valentino 360 North Rodeo Dr., Bevedy Hills (310) 247-0103 Versace 248 North Rodeo Dr., Beverly Hills (310) 205-3921 Vespa 1 453 Lincoln Blvd., Santo Monica (310) 434-9929 Andrea Pfister at Neimon Marcus JUNE 2002 LOS A \\ C E L E S 5? When Sean MacPherson and Jon Side! opened Olive in 1990, they created a scene that gave birth to 32 bars and restaurants, transformed Hollywood, and redefined L.A. nightlife ByOaveGardetta Photographs by David Drebin ONE AFTERNOON IN 1991, RUTH Reichl, who was then food editor at the Los Angeles Times, dialed the number 213-939-2001 to book a reservation at a new restaurant named OHve. After years of re- viewing, Reichl was accustomed to disguising herself on such phone calls in order to evade de- tection from a knowing maitre d'. She was not accustomed, howev- er, to the deception of this new restaurant. Hidden in the Fairfax district, Olive had no pubHcist, no sign, no listed phone number. In addition, there were rumors about a code one had to use if one did lo- cate the phone number: Either you had to ask for \"Tiny\" to get a reser- vation, or you had to make sure you didn't mention Tiny if you wanted in— it was all mysterious. The restaurant critic was finally confronted by a raspy voice that de- manded, \"Who are you and how did you get this number?\" Reichl even- tually got her reservation— a terri- ble review ensued— but it's doubtful she had to worry about disguising herself The hottest nightspot in L.A. at the time, Olive was run by two kids in their twen- ties who'd just opened their first restaurant and had never cooked a meal in their lives, much less read a review J U N t 2 0 0 2 L O S A N G i: I. H S 5 I t NCH Olive was not necessarily about food, though chef Fred Eric did busy himself putting out salads that looked like boxes and enormous serving trays that resembled torture gadgetry, sprout- ing jagged metal on which seared flesh was speared. Nor was Olive about location, a motel parking lot on Fairfax Avenue, or even the design of its interior, which Gourmet food writer Jona- than Gold remembers as \"decorated like a harlequin's jock- strap.\" What was important about Olive was how it felt, and— depending on whom you speak to — that was either like Berlin, 1925, or the Lower East Side of Manhattan, 1985, but certainly not L.A. in 1990 when the little restaurant opened. Olive turned out to be an in- cubator, the type of restaurant whose employees leave to open their own, which like the biology of cell division in turn begets even more restaurants and bars. Jon Sidel and Sean MacPherson are the names of the two kids who ran Olive — together and separately they would open Swingers,Jones, Good Luck Bar, El Carmen, and a half dozen oth- er places that would cast the die for the '90s boom in cool bars and restaurants. Their employ- ees would follow, opening © bar, Fred 62, Sugar, the loi Coffee Shop, and Lucques— in fact, 32 nightsfwts have come out of Si- del and MacPherson's first res- taurant, and more are slated to open soon. Even the busboys, the brothers Lopez, had their own West L.A. establishment. By 1994 Olive's doors were shut forever. The partnership of Sidel and MacPherson would also not last the decade it in- spired. All families are unhappy in their own way, but restaurant families can be particularly un- happy. In continental terms, the two could not have started far- ther apart— Sidel growing up on Manhattan's Upper East Side, MacPherson surfing the waves off Malibu— and today they rarely, if ever, speak. Maybe what Olive was most famous for was spanning that original distance, bringing to- gether all the nation's precincts.
