        "text": "WHAT: Miss Universe Pageant\n\nHOSTS: Dick Clark, Leeza Gibbons.\n\nWHEN: 8 p.m. Sunday.\n\nWHERE: KOTV-6.\n\nHOLLYWOOD - She's tall, she's thin, she's gorgeous, she\n\nloves to talk, she would like to change the world and she\n\nhopes to become the first American Miss Universe since 1980.\n\nCarole Gist, a 20-year-old Detroit native, started to make\n\nchanges in the world six weeks ago when she became the first\n\nblack Miss USA. Since then, she has been accused of trying\n\nto downplay her race, but the 6-foot Gist says that is not\n\ntrue.\n\n\"I'm proud of being an African-American,\" she said in\n\nan interview. \"But we Gists are so multiracial, I don't\n\nlike to choose just one. I'm part African-American, part\n\nCherokee, part Caucasian, part Filipino, part Polynesian.\n\nMy hope for the future is that we all get so mixed up no\n\none can discriminate against anyone anymore.\n\n\"I personally prefer just to be Carole Gist. That's who\n\nI am first. I don't want to make my race an issue. But of\n\ncourse I'm proud to be the first black Miss USA. It's an\n\nhonor, and I love it. I hope because I'm first I can get\n\nmy word across to people even more so.\"\n\nBut she also worries that success may go to her head.\n\n\"I told my family `Here's a pin. Let the air out if you\n\never see it swelling,' \" she laughed.\n\nHer family probably won't have any problem bringing her\n\nback to earth if needed. Growing up in middle-class Detroit\n\nneighborhoods, some of which were integrated, Gist was teased\n\nmercilessly about her height.\n\n\"I always had to show I was tough,\" she recalled. \"There\n\nwere no other girls on my block I could play with, so all\n\nI had available was the guys on the block. I was a latchkey\n\nkid, and I learned to tackle and all that. My backyard was\n\nkind of a playground for me. It had trees and a garage to\n\njump off. It made me tough. And then I was labeled a bad\n\nchild by my family because I was tough.\n\n\"My other cousins were goody-two-shoes, and people always\n\nasked why I couldn't be like them. And they teased me about\n\nmy height. So I eventually turned it around and started\n\nexcelling in school and dance and sports. I loved running\n\nthe hurdles and high jumping and running the mile in track.\"\n\nEventually, even people who had taunted Gist began to see\n\nher beauty. \"Some people who had teased me began to say,\n\n`Gee, you should model.' No one ever told me flat out `You're\n\npretty,' but they said I had a good walk and things like\n\nthat.\"\n\nGradually, Gist began to believe in herself. \"It was basically\n\ntaking the initiative to take myself in hand and build my\n\nself-esteem,\" she said. \"The church was a help. I realized\n\nit was wrong not to be grateful to God for the blessings\n\nI had.\"\n\nGist's confidence became so great that before the Miss USA\n\ncontest in Kansas City last month, she spent only two days\n\nbeing coached and arranged for her own gown, rather than\n\nusing the one provided.\n\n\"For Miss USA, I decided to go and enjoy myself and have\n\na good time,\" she said. \"I felt if I was happy being myself\n\nand being Miss Michigan USA, I would make some friends and\n\nthe positive in me would shine.\"\n\nGist's warm-up for this week's Miss Universe pageant in\n\nLos Angeles is similar. \"I'll prepare myself mentally and\n\nspiritually,\" she said. \"All I can do is be the best Carole\n\nGist I can.\"\n\nShe also will have a bit more coaching on how to walk stairs,\n\nthe angle at which she should look at the judges and how\n\nto walk in a swimsuit. But all that won't take more than\n\na few hours.\n\n\"I believe you are born to win and conditioned to lose,\"\n\nGist said. \"So I'll go into it thinking positively. This\n\nis the first time in 10 years they've held the Miss Universe\n\npageant in the United States, and there hasn't been a winner\n\nfrom America in all that time. Maybe that's good for me.\"\n\nWin or lose, Gist eventually will return to college at Northwood\n\nInstitute in Midland, Mich., where she is a junior. She\n\nheatedly denies rumors appearing in tabloids of an impending\n\nengagement to singer Al B. Shore. \"I'm not engaged and\n\nI'm not getting married, not to him or anyone else,\" she\n\nsaid.\n\nWhat she wants to do is establish a fine-arts institute\n\nfor children. \"I'd take them just as soon as they learn\n\nto walk,\" she said.\n\nGist, convinced that the modern world stresses business\n\nand sports to the exclusion of less competitive activities,\n\nsaid the institute would be her way of helping to change\n\nthe world.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
