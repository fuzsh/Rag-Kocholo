        "text": "Miss America History\n\nWomen's History\n\n1845\n\nNewspaperman Horace Greeley publishes a landmark book by journalist and social reformer Margaret Fuller, Woman in the Nineteenth Century. The work argues for women's equality in all aspects of life.\n\n1848\n\nAmerican women move further into the public sphere; the first Women's Rights Convention is held at Seneca Falls, New York.\n\n1849\n\nAmelia Bloomer begins her crusade to reform American women's fashions.\n\n1854\n\nP.T. Barnum's efforts to launch a live beauty contest are unsuccessful. Respectable women do not parade their beauty in public. He launches a picture-based beauty contest sponsored by local newspapers. It is highly successful and imitated.\n\n1861-64\n\nThe nation is divided in two as North and South clash in the U.S. Civil War.\n\n1863\n\nJanuary 1: President Abraham Lincoln signs the Emancipation Proclamation.\n\n1880\n\nThe first recorded bathing beauty contest takes place at Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. Inventor Thomas Edison is a judge. A bridal trousseau is the prize. Contestants must be under 25, not married, at least 5 feet 4 inches tall, and weigh no more than 130 pounds.\n\n1889\n\nNovember 18: Journalist Nellie Bly sets off to travel around the world in under 80 days.\n\n1890\n\nAn umbrella organization, the General Federation of Women's Clubs, is formed. Women's clubs are venues for women's education and development, and will increasingly focus on community service.\n\nIn a second wave of U.S. immigration, people from Eastern Europe and Italy come to America.\n\n1893\n\nThe Chicago Columbian Exposition features a Congress of Beauty.\n\n1895\n\nThe National Federation of Afro-American Women is formed. A year later it joins with the League of Colored Women to become the National Association of Colored Women.\n\n1896\n\nU.S. Supreme Court case Plessy v. Ferguson rules that segregation is not unconstitutional. The doctrine treating African Americans as \"separate but equal\" holds for the next half century.\n\n1898\n\nAmerican soldiers fight the Spanish American War in Cuba and the Philippines.\n\n1902\n\nThe National Women's Trade Union League is formed.\n\nNovember: McClure's Magazine publishes the first installment of muckraker Ida Tarbell's exposé, The History of the Standard Oil Company.\n\n1907\n\nSwimmer Annette Kellerman is arrested for indecent exposure while trying to popularize a one-piece swimsuit worn with tights rather than bloomers.\n\n1909\n\nThe National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) is founded.\n\n1914\n\nWorld War I begins in Europe.\n\n1915\n\nD.W. Griffith's Birth of a Nation is the first full-length feature film in the new motion picture industry. It portrays the Ku Klux Klan as American heroes.\n\nThe new sound recording industry begins a phase of rapid growth.\n\n1917-18\n\nThe U.S. enters World War I. Of the 4.3 million American soldiers who fight, 126,000 are killed. The total number dead in the bloodiest war mankind has ever seen is 8.5 million, from over a dozen nations.\n\n1919\n\nThe First International Congress of Working Women meets in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe Red Summer: widespread anti-Communist sentiment, racial and labor unrest, and the aftermath of war combine and cause the nation to erupt in violence.\n\n1920\n\nJanuary: The Eighteenth Amendment makes the sale, manufacture, and transportation of intoxicating liquors illegal.\n\nAugust: The Nineteenth Amendment is ratified, giving women the right to vote.
