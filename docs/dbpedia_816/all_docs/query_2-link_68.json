Similar to his predecessor, Schwarzenegger will have a family member present — his nephew, high-powered entertainment attorney Patrick Knapp Schwarzenegger.\n\nNBC — home of “The Celebrity Apprentice” — cut ties with Trump in June 2015, after he made racist remarks about Mexicans, but he remains an executive producer. Arnold Schwarzenegger’s net worth of $300 million can’t compare to Donald Trump’s net worth of $4.5 billion, but it will be interesting to see how they compare to the show’s head honcho.\n\nThe 25 Richest Celebrity Apprentice Cast Members\n\n“The Celebrity Apprentice” is a star-studded affair by nature, with many of the biggest names from various industries joining the contest to raise money for their favorite charities. But some celebrities have far more in their bank accounts than others. Click through to see some of the richest cast members to ever appear on “The Celebrity Apprentice,” and how they got to be so wealthy.\n\n1. Warren Buffett Net Worth: $65 Billion\n\nNicknamed the Oracle of Omaha, billionaire Warren Buffett is an adviser on the new season of “The Celebrity Apprentice.” The Berkshire Hathaway CEO is the third-richest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of $65 billion. Largely considered one of the best investors of all-time, Buffett has stakes in a variety of big name stocks, including Geico, Dairy Queen, Coca-Cola, American Express and Fruit of the Loom.\n\nNotoriously frugal, Buffett has lived in the same Omaha, Neb., home since 1958 — purchased for $31,500. He can afford any car he wants, but the always economical Buffett swapped his 2006 Cadillac for a Cadillac XTS in 2014.\n\n2. Steve Ballmer Net Worth: $24 Billion\n\nFormer Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer is serving as an adviser on the new season of “The Celebrity Apprentice.” Ballmer helmed the tech giant from 2000 to 2014. After stepping down, he purchased the NBA team the Los Angeles Clippers for $2 billion in 2014.\n\nThe billionaire businessman earned an undergraduate degree in mathematics and economics from Harvard, where he befriended Bill Gates. After a brief stint at the Stanford University Graduate School of Business, he dropped out to join the Microsoft team. He served as president of the company from July 1998 until February 2001, when he took over for Gates.\n\nForbes noted that much of Ballmer’s estimated net worth is tied to Microsoft stock. He also became one of Twitter’s largest shareholders in October 2015, when he purchased a 4 percent stake in the company.\n\nMake your money work for you\n\nGet the latest news on investing, money, and more with our free newsletter.\n\nBy subscribing, you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.

Jessica Alba Net Worth: $350 Million\n\nAnother adviser on the new season, Jessica Alba is both a successful Hollywood actress and savvy businesswoman. She co-founded the Honest Company, a socially responsible family brand that sells everything from diapers to cleaning products. A cult favorite, the Honest Company is valued at $1.7 billion — and she owns 15 to 20 percent of stock in the company, according to Forbes.\n\nHer billion-dollar business keeps her plenty busy, but Alba still finds time to maintain her acting career. In 2016 alone, she starred in three movies — “Mechanic: Resurrection,” “Dear Eleanor” and “The Veil.” Some of her most popular films include “Little Fockers,” “Valentine’s Day” and “Sin City.”\n\n4. Gene Simmons Net Worth: $300 Million\n\nGene Simmons is definitely most famous for sporting radical styles and black-and-white makeup as a founding member of Kiss, which has sold over 100 million copies of its albums since the band formed in 1973. The success of Kiss is the main source of Simmons’ massive $300 million fortune though he has other business ventures, like his partnership in the international chain restaurant Rock & Brews.\n\nSimmons appeared on season one of “The Celebrity Apprentice” in 2008 and raised $20,000 for the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation before he was fired in the third episode. In addition to appearing on “The Celebrity Apprentice,” Simmons has made other forays into reality TV with his shows “Gene Simmons Family Jewels” on A&E and “Rock School” for U.K. television.\n\n5. Sharon Osbourne Net Worth: $220 Million\n\nSharon Osbourne has long enjoyed financial success through her career of managing music artists Motorhead, Smashing Pumpkins and, of course, her husband Ozzy Osbourne, lead singer of hugely popular heavy metal band Black Sabbath. Sharon Osbourne’s current net worth stands at $220 million.\n\nOsbourne broke into the reality TV scene in the iconic show about the Osbourne family, “The Osbournes,” which debuted in 2002. She’s had some misses since then, like failed talk show “The Sharon Osbourne Show,” but has enjoyed more profitable projects, like her stints as a judge on “The X Factor” in the U.K. and “America’s Got Talent.”\n\nSharon appeared on season three of “The Celebrity Apprentice” and raised $50,000 for the Cedars-Sinai Sharon Osbourne Colon Cancer Program. Currently, she appears as one of the hosts on “The Talk.”\n\n6. Penn Jillette Net Worth: $175 Million\n\nPenn Jillette’s net worth of $175 million has been built in large part thanks to his career as half of the comedy and magic show “Penn & Teller,” which has long been a popular show in Vegas. But he’s also been a part of various other projects, from appearing in a Showtime program based on his Vegas show to producing the 2005 film “The Aristocrats,” as well as starring and writing in the upcoming film “The Grounds.”\n\nPenn appeared on the fifth and sixth seasons of “The Celebrity Apprentice.” In the fifth season, he finished seventh and raised $40,000 — with a grand total of $300,000 after Caesars Entertainment chipped in $250,000 — for Opportunity Village, a Las Vegas community charity. But Penn returned the next year for the All-Star Season to become the runner-up, raising a whopping $663,655 for Opportunity Village.\n\n7. Joan Rivers Net Worth: $150 Million\n\nComedian Joan Rivers, who made great strides for women in the fields of comedy and television, passed away in September of 2014 at the age of 81. Rivers amassed a fortune of $150 million throughout her long comedy career through stand-up gigs, TV appearances, hosting gigs and a clothing and jewelry line. She was the host of “Fashion Police” on E! when she passed away.\n\nIt’s been more than two years since her sudden passing, and the world is still mourning the loss of the iconic funny lady. Rivers was a cast member on “The Celebrity Apprentice 2” alongside daughter Melissa. Joan won the title of Celebrity Apprentice that season and also made a posthumous guest appearance on the last season of “The Celebrity Apprentice.”\n\n8. Lennox Lewis Net Worth: $140 Million\n\nLennox Lewis is a retired boxer worth $140 million. He won 41 of 44 career bouts and claimed Olympic gold for Canada in 1988, retiring in 2004. In August 2015, Lewis was honored with an induction into the Nevada Boxing Hall of Fame.\n\nLewis competed in the first season of “The Celebrity Apprentice” and took fourth place. He raised $40,000 and donated it to his charity, the Muhammad Ali Parkinson Center.\n\nAlong with his wife, Violet, Lewis is the co-founder of the Lennox Lewis League of Champions. The foundation helps children in underserved communities gain access to the world of boxing. In July 2016, the nonprofit held its first Lennox Lewis Boxing Camp in Jamaica. The group had a nutrition workshop in Jamaica one year earlier, as well.\n\n9. Melissa Rivers Net Worth: $100 Million\n\nMelissa Rivers is the daughter of Joan Rivers, and the duo competed together in “The Celebrity Apprentice 2.” Melissa is best known as a red carpet reporter and hosted several shows alongside her mother. She’s currently starring on “Fashion Police,” which is likely bittersweet since her late mother was previously one of her co-stars.\n\nMuch of Melissa’s net worth can be attributed to an inheritance from her famous mother, which included $75 million in cash and a New York City penthouse worth $35 million. She also auctioned several of her mother’s possessions off in the summer of 2016. The events benefited two charities close to Joan’s heart: Guide Dogs for the Blind and God’s Love We Deliver.\n\n10. Tyra Banks Net Worth: $90 Million\n\nFormer “America’s Next Top Model” host Tyra Banks has returned to reality TV to serve as an adviser on the new season of “The Celebrity Apprentice.” The supermodel rose to fame in the early ’90s and graced the cover of many magazines, including Harper’s Bazaar, Vogue and GQ. Her portfolio includes gigs for numerous brands, such as Ralph Lauren, Yves Saint Laurent, Tommy Hilfiger and Victoria’s Secret.\n\nBanks has realized considerable success as a model and is also an established actress and host. In late 2016, she guest starred on the TV series “Blackish.” She’s also appeared on several other shows, including “Gossip Girl,” “Felicity” and “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.” Of course, she also hosted “The Tyra Banks Show” from 2005 to 2011 and co-hosted FabLife until July 2016. Also a businesswoman, Banks is the founder of cosmetics line Tyra Beauty.\n\n11. Johnny Damon Net Worth: $60 Million\n\nJohnny Damon was a cast member of the seventh season of “The Celebrity Apprentice.” After making it pretty far into the competition — 11 rounds — Trump fired him and Brandi Glanville because neither was willing to sell the other one out as a lesser player.\n\nDamon is a professional baseball player who first entered the Major Leagues in 1995 and played for 18 seasons. The legendary athlete is one of just a handful of MLB players to ever win a World Series with both the Yankees and Red Sox.\n\nNow retired, Damon is sitting on a comfortable $60 million fortune. The married father of six has a charitable heart. He created The Johnny Damon Foundation to raise money for various local and national charitable programs that offer leadership and growth opportunities for at-risk children.\n\n12. Meat Loaf Net Worth: $45 Million\n\nMeat Loaf, or Marvin Lee Aday, has had a long and storied career in both music and acting. He’s released 13 studio albums, including his latest “Braver Than We Are,” which debuted in September 2016. In 1993 he won a Grammy for Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance for his hit “I’d Do Anything For Love (But I Won’t Do That).”\n\nAlso a successful actor, Meat Loaf has appeared in nearly 75 films and television series. Some of his most high-profile works include “Fight Club,” “The Rocky Horror Picture Show” and “Wayne’s World.”\n\nMeat Loaf’s colorful persona added a lot of flavor to “The Celebrity Apprentice” during his time on the show in season 11. Meat Loaf’s net worth is estimated to be $45 million.\n\n13. Scott Hamilton Net Worth: $30 Million\n\nScott Hamilton is best known for his dominance as a male figure skater in the ’80s and ’90s, which included winning gold in the 1984 Winter Olympics. Hamilton made his $30 million net worth through his figure skating career, first in competitions, then by touring in the “Ice Capades” show, and later founding and starring in his own ice skating tour, “Discover Stars on Ice.”\n\nHamilton also forayed into show business multiple times. He starred alongside Will Ferrell and Jon Heder in the film “Blades of Glory” and hosted the television series “Skating With Celebrities.” He was a cast member of “The Celebrity Apprentice 2” in 2009, but he didn’t fare too well — he was the second cast member fired.\n\n14. Cyndi Lauper Net Worth: $30 Million\n\nAs a singer who gave voice to many popular hits in the ’80s, like the seminal “Girls Just Want to Have Fun,” Cyndi Lauper has sold over 50 million albums and managed to acquire quite the fortune, as well as two Grammys, an Emmy and Tony award. She won the latter for writing the original score for the musical Kinky Boots.\n\nThe exceptionally talented artist is also a New York Times Best Selling author for her autobiography “Cyndi Lauper: A Memoir.” All this success has brought Lauper’s net worth to $30 million.\n\nIn 2010, the charitable star teamed up with Lady Gaga as the faces of the MAC Cosmetics Viva Glam: From Our Lips campaign, which donated 100 percent of proceeds to the MAC AIDS Fund. Lauper appeared in season three of “The Celebrity Apprentice” and raised $45,000 for her charity, the True Colors Fund.\n\n15. Lil Jon Net Worth: $28 Million\n\nRapper Lil Jon got his start as a DJ in the early ’90s and has since enjoyed success through his career as a rapper and music producer. Thanks to earnings from his music career and other business ventures like his Crunk energy drink, line of Oakley sunglasses and wine company, Little Jonathan, Lil Jon’s net worth is estimated at a healthy $28 million.\n\nDuring his run on the fourth season of “The Celebrity Apprentice,” Lil Jon had a seriously impressive third place finish that raised $80,000 for the United Methodist Children’s Home — a Georgia nonprofit that places children into foster and adoptive homes and works to strengthen family relationships. He also participated in the all-star sixth season, raising $160,000 for the American Diabetes Association.\n\n16. Michael Andretti Net Worth: $20 Million\n\nA retired racer, Michael Andretti was a successful American CART and Formula One driver, following in the footsteps of his famous father, Mario Andretti. Michael’s career helped him accumulate his current net worth, estimated at $20 million.\n\nAndretti’s impressive record on the racetrack includes more Champ Car World Series race wins than any other driver in history — including a 1991 Indy championship. He now owns the Andretti Autosport racing team.\n\nAndretti opted to participate on “The Celebrity Apprentice 5” as a last minute replacement for his son Marco Andretti. However, his tenure on the show was cut short when he didn’t take the lead on a challenge to create a promotional pitch for Buick — a move not well-received by Donald and Ivanka Trump.\n\n17. Piers Morgan Net Worth: $20 Million\n\nA British journalist, Piers Morgan is best known among American audiences for his stint as host of CNN’s “Piers Morgan Tonight.” Since its 2014 end, he’s hosted a variety of series, including “Piers Morgan’s Life Stories,” “Loose Women” and “Good Morning Britain.”\n\nThe controversial host regularly makes headlines for his feuds with celebrities and was slapped on air by reporter Richard Arnold during a December 2016 “Good Morning Britain” segment. All his success in television has brought Morgan’s net worth to an estimated $20 million.\n\nBefore his stint as a host on CNN, Morgan was the winner of the first season of “The Celebrity Apprentice” in 2008, racking up a whopping $754,300 on behalf of his charity, the Intrepid Fallen Heroes Fund.\n\n18.

All this success has brought Leeza Gibbons’ net worth to a healthy $20 million.\n\nShe’s currently staying busy with the show “Home & Family” and her charity Leeza’s Care Connection. Located at Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, Calif., the foundation provides support to those caring for a loved one with a memory disorder or a chronic or progressive illness.\n\n19. Kevin Jonas Net Worth: $20 Million\n\nAs the oldest of the three siblings who make up the band the Jonas Brothers, Kevin enjoyed a lot of financial success in his teens and early 20s. The Jonas Brothers had a streak of mega-success in the late ’00s, selling millions of records and appearing in Disney Channel shows and in several of the group’s own movies.\n\nKevin’s reality TV debut came in 2012 with “Married to Jonas,” which featured Jonas and his wife Danielle Deleasa and lasted two seasons. The famous celebrity couple’s first child Alena was born in February 2014 and they welcomed another baby girl, Valentina, in November 2016.\n\nThe Jonas Brothers broke up in 2013, but all of their success brought Kevin’s’ net worth to 20 million.

Throughout her successful career, Taylor has done modeling work for major brands including Cover Girl and Nokia.\n\nThe beautiful blonde model’s life hasn’t been picture-perfect, as she’s been forced to overcome some grave tragedies. In 1995, she lost her sister — and best friend — Krissy Taylor to a rare heart condition and was almost killed in a serious car accident in 2001 that left her hospitalized for three months.\n\nThroughout her career, Taylor has acquired a net worth of $18 million.

Adam Carolla Net Worth: $15 Million\n\nAdam Carolla got his break in show business by making appearances on KROQ’s “Kevin and Bean Morning Show,” a popular Los Angeles radio show. Dr. Drew Pinsky liked his style and in 1995 invited Carolla to co-host “Loveline,” a nationally syndicated late-night radio talk show. Soon after, the radio show spun off on television and “Loveline” debuted on MTV in 1996.\n\nThough the “Loveline” TV show ended in 2000, Carolla continued to co-host the radio show until 2005. Since then, Carolla has written two books that became New York Times best-sellers, records one of the most popular podcasts out there and even started his own line of alcoholic drinks called Mangria.

In addition to touring as a stand-up comic, he landed his own Fox 21 sitcom “Dice.” It’s second season debuts in 2017. He also appeared in the films “Blue Jasmine” and “Entourage” — after several cameos in the HBO series. This success earned Andrew Dice Clay a net worth of $10 million.\n\nClay wasn’t as successful on “The Celebrity Apprentice 2,” however, as he was the first cast member to be fired that season.\n\nThe 25 Poorest Celebrity Apprentice Cast Members\n\nSure, there are plenty of huge net worths on a show about celebrities, but what about “The Celebrity Apprentice” cast members who have ended up in the red? It turns out you don’t need to be a millionaire to secure a spot on “The Celebrity Apprentice.” In fact, the poorest contestants of the show are millions of dollars in debt. Here are the 25 poorest cast members to appear in a season of “The Celebrity Apprentice,” along with how much they are worth — or not worth.\n\n1. Teresa Giudice Net Worth: -$11 Million\n\nTeresa Giudice first rose to prominence as a main cast member of “The Real Housewives of New Jersey.” She’s also an author with four New York Times best-sellers, including three cookbooks and a memoir. Guidice secured a spot on “Celebrity Apprentice 5” and raised $70,000 for the NephCure Foundation.\n\nBut Giudice’s season on “The Celebrity Apprentice” has been overshadowed by more recent legal troubles. She and her husband, Joe, filed for bankruptcy in 2009, claiming debts of $11 million, her attorney told People. But investigations into the couples’ finances uncovered that they had misstated their income on several documents, from loan applications to bankruptcy claims, and were indicted on 39 counts of fraud.\n\nThe pair ended up getting jail time. Joe was sentenced to 41 months and Teresa got 15 months. She started her sentence in January 2015 and secured an early release in December 2015.\n\n2.

In 2009 he appeared on “The Celebrity Apprentice 3,” but was fired in week two.\n\nIn 2013, Sinbad filed for bankruptcy and revealed he was nearly $11 million in debt, TMZ reported. Despite his bankruptcy, Sinbad said he wouldn’t change a thing.\n\n“I didn’t buy Bentleys,” he said in an episode of “Oprah: Where Are They Now?” “I didn’t live large. I invested in me. I invested in a lot of other people. I would not change it; I would not go back.”\n\n3. Dionne Warwick Net Worth: -$10 Million\n\nDionne Warwick is a singer and actress, popular as the voice behind songs like “I Say a Little Prayer” and “Walk On By.” Warwick was a cast member of season four of “Celebrity Apprentice.”\n\nWarwick had been struggling financially for years, but her troubles came to a head after her stint on “The Celebrity Apprentice,” when she filed for bankruptcy in 2013. Despite decades of success in show business, Warwick had only $25,000 to her name along with over $10 million in debt, according to CNN. However, in 2014 a bankruptcy trustee excused her from paying off the debts — which dated back to 1991 — and allowed her to keep her assets.\n\nWarwick seems to be working hard to rebuild her fortune. In 2016, she performed on the soundtracks of “Vinyl,” “Roadies” and “Bridget Jones’ Baby.” You can also catch her in the upcoming film “If.”\n\n4.

The second time around, he was fired for spelling Melania Trump’s name wrong as part of a challenge to create a campaign for her skincare line.\n\nDespite a successful NBA career that earned Rodman millions in NBA salaries and five NBA championships, the former pro basketball player is worse than broke. In 2012, Rodman was ordered to pay his ex-wife $500,000 in back child support, according to USA Today. Financial woes aren’t his only issue right now — in November 2016, he was charged with a hit-and-run for driving on the wrong side of the road on a Southern California freeway and could face two years in jail.\n\n5.

Terrell Owens Net Worth: $0\n\nAs a former NFL wide receiver, Terrell Owens had a 16-season career, an impressively long run for a professional football player. His long career playing for the San Francisco 49ers, Philadelphia Eagles and Dallas Cowboys led to millions in career earnings.\n\nOwens hit financial troubles soon after 2010, which marked his last season playing in the NFL. In 2011, he petitioned to have his child support payments, which totaled $50,000 a month according to ESPN, reduced as he had no income post-NFL.\n\nTerrell Owens’ net worth is $0, but it could soon change, as he launched his athleisure clothing brand, Prototype81, in 2016.
