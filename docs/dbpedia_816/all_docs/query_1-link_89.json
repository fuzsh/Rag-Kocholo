        "text": "POP! is INQUIRER.net’s premier pop culture channel, delivering the latest news in the realm of pop culture, internet culture, social issues, and everything fun, weird, and wired. It is also home to POP! Sessions and POP! Hangout,\n\nOG online entertainment programs in the\n\nPhilippines (streaming since 2015).\n\nAs the go-to destination for all things ‘in the now’, POP! features and curates the best relevant content for its young audience. It is also a strong advocate of fairness and truth in storytelling.\n\nPOP! is operated by INQUIRER.net’s award-winning native advertising team, BrandRoom.\n\nThe Miss Universe pageant started almost on a whim. In 1951, newly-crowned Miss America Yolanda Betzbe refused to do swimsuit publicity shots.\n\nThis didn’t sit well with the pageant’s major sponsor, Catalina Swimsuits. Former Miss America Jacque Mercer suggested, “Why don’t you start your own pageant?”\n\nSo in 1952, Catalina established the current Miss Universe as we know it. The first competition was in Long Beach, California. It was an instant hit. Armi Kuusela of Finland was the first winner. Before her reign was over, she had to give up her title to get married to a Filipino tycoon, Virgilio Hilario.\n\nThe Miss Universe pageant was first televised in 1955. John Charles Daly was the original host of the pageant, from 1955 to 1966. Bob Barker took over for 20 years, from 1967 to 1987. A succession of hosts soon followed, but none served as long as Daly and Barker.\n\nIn 1962, Miss Haiti Evelyn Miot, became the first black woman to make the semi-finals.\n\nIn 1972, the Miss Universe pageant was broadcast live around the world for the first time. Televised from Dorado, Puerto Rico, this started the tradition of the pageant broadcasting from exotic locales.\n\nThe following year, the pageant broadcasted from the Parthenon in Athens, Greece. Many consider it one of the most stunning pageant broadcasts ever.\n\nThe Miss Universe pageant continued breaking racial barriers. In 1977, Miss Trinidad-Tobago Janelle Commissiong became the first black Miss Universe. In 1995, Miss USA Chelsi Smith became the first bi-racial title holder.\n\nThe final question was never a regular feature of the pageant. It was only in 1990 when it became mandatory for the top 5 contestants to answer a final question.\n\nOn December 20, 2015, Pia Alonzo Wurtzbach became the third Filipina to hold the title.\n\nThe last time the Philippines won was in 1973 by way of Maria Margarita Moran.\n\nIn 1996, Donald Trump bought the operating company, Miss Universe, Inc. Two years later, Miss Universe, Inc. changed its name to Miss Universe Organization. Its headquarters moved from Los Angeles to New York City.\n\nFor the second time in history, the pageant skipped an entire year. Miss Universe 2016 will be crowned on January 30, 2017. The first time this happened was when Miss Universe 2014 aired on January of the following year.\n\nThe Miss Universe beauty pageant has come a long way since 1952, but its ethos has remained the same: Finding the most beautiful woman in the entire universe.\n\nFor more on your favorite Miss Universe candidates, visit InqPOP!’s official Miss Universe webpage HERE!"
