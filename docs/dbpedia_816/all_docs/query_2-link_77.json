        "text": "I was a Mass Communications Major in college and was always involved in the newspaper, yearbook, student government and planning special events. During my child rearing years, I’ve worked for political campaigns, made videos for my husband’s business, and created my own “Best Kept Secrets” show for my Real Estate company. I produced my first film, paid for it myself, got distribution for it and won several awards for it including Best Feature from the New York Film and Video festival. I found Zac Efron right before High School Musical found him! I asked old friends and newer friends to be in it and darn if we didn’t make a good film.\n\nThe movie is The Derby Stallion and I’m now working to transform it to 2K for Ad based VOD release. Turns out Samual Goldwyn Meyer has had a great response to the film on it’s recent re-release to Amazon, Tubi and other AVOD stations and now prime pay streaming services are interested.\n\nI left Hollywood to go to Ohio to have my children and be with Ed's family. I was propelled into philanthropy as a Board Member of United Cerebral Palsy of Ohio, and I had worked with UCP in New York, then loved working with Project Love in Ohio, which taught kindness in the schools.( I can tell you more about that later). I was shocked when I was awarded The Woman of the Year Award for my work with UCP in New York! I had always just loved doing this work and visiting with the people at the centers. This award was presented to me by Matilda Cuomo, truly one of the most sophisticated and impressive women I have known. Then with Whitney Houston and Michael Bolton’s Foundations, I was so honored to receive The American Cinema Foundation Award during the years after our children were in their early school days. We had as we gotten a place in New York that I could work out of from time to time. I was so happy about that because I missed the city, and my husband the kids all loved it there, too.\n\nAfter my husband passed away in December 2018, I was in shock and mourning for quite sometime. I thought I would be okay financially and not have to go back to work, but we had discovered a treatment from the UK that kept him alive 4 years longer than the doctors had expected. It was very expensive, but of course it was worth it since we got so much more time with him. I had to sell the house, and I needed to get back to work. My daughter Bella was out here in school and my daughter Abby was going to Dallas to go to college, so I moved us to California.I’ve been coming to the desert regularly for 40 years. My husband and I were going to move here after he got well. So I stayed the course when he passed. We got here December 2019 and rented a house until I could find one to call our home. Then the pandemic hit. That is a whole other story for another time!"
