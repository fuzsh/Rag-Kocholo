        "text": "The lovers, the dreamers and Shavana! Connecticuts Shavana Clarke proudly waives the rainbow flag being Connecticut's first openly lesbian titleholder and an advocate of the LGBTQ+ community. Under the previous rules, Shavana wouldnt have been able to compete since she is 29 years old but now that the age limit has been lifted, Shavana is competing loud and proud. This spunky sista previously placed as 3rd runner-up at Miss Connecticut USA 2023 and went unplaced at Miss Connecticut USA 2021 but her distinct style made her an instant stand-out at her state pageant and she is one to watch this year at Miss USA. Shavana is a first-generation Jamaican-American and earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Acting from the University of Connecticut. Shavana is employed as a sales coordinator, model, entrepreneur, and philanthropist. Shavana is an avid crochet artist and parlayed that talent into her own business where she makes and sells trendy crochet-wear and even wore a swimsuit that she crocheted herself during her states swimsuit competition. On the right, pictured here is Shavana sporting that very unique and interesting crocheted swimsuit that she wore during her state competition. That's a pretty cool talent! Shavanas business is named Sour Candy Studio, where she makes unique and fun one-of-a-kind sustainable pieces. Shavana is an advocate of supporting positive mental health and after suffering her own mental health issues, she started a Blog entitled #YourMentalHealthBestie enabling her to divulge her own experiences on social media to help educate and encourage others. The Constitution state has only captured one Miss USA crown thanks to Erin Brady in 2013 and after placing among the semifinalists last year thanks to Karla Aponte Roque, will Shavana continue the trend and possibly capture another crown for Connecticut?? All of us under her spell we know that its probably magic!\n\nShavana also posted one of those applying make-up videos combatting the bullying suffered by fellow contestant, Gabriella Vigorito who didn't make top 5 at Miss Connecticut USA 2024 despite making top 5 in the previous year. Gabriella stars on TLC's show 'sMothered' with her mother, Miss Connecticut USA 1988-Cathy Galasso-Vigorito. Gabriella posted a Tiktok video while applying make-up discussing her feelings about her placement at Miss Connecticut USA.\n\n@gabriella_vigorito Wait till the end for all the tea! Always know your worth and thank you all for being here ???? #gabriellavigorito #pageantry #tea #knowyourworth ? original sound - Gabriella Vigorito\n\nAnd here's is Shavana's response video.\n\n@shavanakrln Lets talk #MissConnecticutUSA #GRWM ? original sound - Shavana Karoline\n\nMarry-land??\n\nIts almost ironic that Maryland (or for the purposes of this article, Marry-land) is sending a delegate to Miss USA that breaks ALL the old rules when Marylands first Miss USA (Leona Gage who won the crown in 1957) was dethroned when it was discovered that she was a twice-married mother of two young boys who even lied about her age claiming she was 21 when she was only 18! I honestly think the infamy of Leona Gage and her historical public shaming led to many of the Miss USA and Universe contestant restrictions being changed today.\n\nMarylands 2024 delegate is Bailey Anne Kennedy who was born in Cambodia and emigrated to the United States when she was eleven years old due to the humanitarian efforts by The US Ambassador and Thai officials allowing her grandfather to help her and her entire familys immigration to America 20 years ago. Let me count the ways that Bailey Anne breaks all the stereotypes of your typical Miss USA contestant. She is 1.) Transgender. Transgendered delegates were not allowed to compete at any international pageant traditionally for natural born females until 2012 when Vancouvers Jenna Talackova (a transwoman that was born male originally having the name Walter and later transitioning to female) originally was denied entry into the 2012 Miss Universe Canada pageant but after lawyering up with prominent feminist attorney, Gloria Allred showing that her Canadian passport indicated that she was female, the rules were changed and transgendered delegates were allowed to compete in the national pageants leading to the Miss Universe stage and Jenna would make the top 12 of Miss Universe Canada 2012 but would not make the top 5 in a pageant won by Vancouvers Sahar Biniaz who was later replaced by her runner-up, Adwoa Yamoah who represented Canada at Miss Universe 2012 but going unplaced. A few transgendered delegates have since attempted to win their state titles but the only one that managed to win prior to Bailey Anne was Kataluna Enriquez, a transwoman of Filipina descent who won Miss Nevada USA 2021 but would go unplaced at Miss USA 2021. It was 2018 when the first trans delegate made it to the Miss Universe stage and that was Spains Angela Ponce who went unplaced at Miss Universe 2018, then the 2023 Miss Universe pageant would see the first trans semifinalist at Miss Universe with Portugals Marina Machete making the top 20 of Miss Universe 2023 and another trans delegate, Netherlands Rikkie Kollé also competed but went unplaced at Miss Universe 2023. She is 2.) Married. Married delegates had some exceptions in the early years of 1952-56 but not permitted fully in 1957 leading to the first dethronement of Leona Gage but women who have been married are now allowed to compete as of 2023 and last year saw one married candidate, Maines Juliana Morehouse-Locklear (husband of Taylor Reed Locklear and Juliana is the daughter of Lynn Jenkins-Morehouse who was Miss North Carolina USA 1994 and 2nd runner up to Miss USA 1994). Bailey Anne is a military wife married to Casey Gup, an officer of the United States Marine Corps who was once the USMC Tank Commander and now the USMC Naval Aviator in Montgomery County Courthouse in her hometown of Silver Spring and Bailey Anne serves the USO as a center representative with pride. She is 3.) Over the age of 28. At 31 years of age, Bailey Anne is her state oldest representative at Miss USA so far with the age limit of 28 being removed as of this year so it seems fitting that her platform is called Beauty Without an Expiration Date. She might not hold on to the oldest Miss Maryland USA record for long but we never know what the future holds! Bailey Anne was also the first woman from the UMBC Dance Team to be named Captain and she later pursued her NFL Cheerleading career as a Rookie Trainee for The First Ladies of Football\n\nBailey Anne would be deemed a triple-threat anomaly delegate being trans, married and over the age of 28 and while she is not the first visible minority to represent Maryland, she is the first Miss Maryland USA of Asian descent so will all of these history-making aspects make her a complete stand-out and could she take the crown and finally get a full reign for the Old Line state and Free state of Maryland which saw its first Miss USA winner, Leona Gage dethroned in 1957 and Maryland only inherited the Miss USA crown in 2012 when it was given to Nana Meriwether who was originally 1st runner-up to Rhode Islands Olivia Culpo who would win Miss USA and then Miss Universe 2012?? Will Bailey Anne be Maryland's first full-term Miss USA??\n\nIs There Anything More I Can Do For You?\n\nShall I Let The Green Grass Turn Blue For You?\n\nThe bluegrass state sends us a real contender in Connor Perry this year. A first-time competitor winning on her first try, Kentuckys representative hails from the Heart of Lexington and also holds a degree in Neuroscience with ambitions to pursue continued education and a career as an Anesthesiology Assistant. Connor certainly moves gracefully on stage as she is currently a professional dancer touring and performing with Movement Continuum. She also serves as a dance educator for young artists. This appetite for dance has motivated Connor to advocate for the arts, and work with various non-profit organizations to provide accessible and equitable opportunities, ensuring that more children of all backgrounds are granted the opportunities and access to pursue their passions. No limits! Connor has been a model and actress for several years with some commercials she has been in being featured during the Super Bowl! Connors fresh overall look and great body and captivating smile has made her an obvious contender for the Miss USA crown. Kentucky captured their second Miss USA crown just three years ago thanks to Elle Smith and they captured their first Miss USA crown in 2006 with Tara Conner so will there be another successful Connor from Kentucky and is the land of fried chicken about to capture their third Miss USA crown??\n\nIndian Summer\n\nWe have had two Miss Teen USA winners of Indian descent which were Miss Teen USA 2022, Nebraskas Faron Medhi and the resigned Miss Teen USA 2023, New Jerseys UmaSofia Srivastava who both have fathers of Indian descent. We have yet to crown a Miss USA of Indian descent but we have two very accomplished contenders this year that could change all that. The first of which is New Jerseys Jabili Kandula who triumphed to win her state crown after multiple attempts previously placing as a semifinalist for 2023 and 2022 but going unplaced for 2021 and 2020 and also placing as a semifinalist for Miss New Jersey Teen USA 2018. Jabili was even born in the year 2000 which was dominated by India in international pageantry winning the Miss Universe, Miss World and Miss Asia Pacific titles that year with the Femina Miss India 2000 winners: Lara Dutta, Priyanka Chopra and Diya Mirza Handrich respectively. Jabili earned her private pilots licence in 2020 and is Associate Editor of the Women in Aviation magazine. She is currently working on her commercial pilot license at Air Fleet Training Systems. She is a M.S. candidate at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, studying Aeronautics with a specialization in Space Operations. The 24-year old holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in journalism and media studies from Rutgers and is using her Miss New Jersey USA title to expand her work with Women in Aviation International. New Jersey has never won the Miss USA crown. Their closest placement was as 1st runner-up which happened two times: 1991 thanks to Charlotte Ray and in 2017 thanks to fellow competitor of Indian descent, Chhavi Verg so will the garden state finally fly to the Miss USA crown with Jabilis piloting skills??\n\nVirginias Himanvi Panidepu is also an accomplished woman proud to be of Indian descent. She graduated Cum Laude with a dual degree and minor graduate from Virginia Tech. Himanvi is well-rounded being an athlete, artist, advocate, and model. She describes herself as a trailblazer in cybersecurity and one who can demonstrate the power of breaking barriers and embracing diverse talents. She faced challenges trying to get into a male dominated field but this inspired her to take initiative and become a leader in her companys Women in Tech program and founding her initiative, STEMpowered Leaders aiming to motivate and teach the next generation to explore occupations in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. An interesting factoid is that Himanvi was a runner-up at the Miss Dallas USA pageant (preliminary for Miss Texas USA) which was won by Aarieanna Ware and Himanvi hopped from Dallas to Virginia and both Aarieanna and Himanvi won the respective state titles of Texas and Virginia on the same weekend! Could these two ladies find themselves in the finals yet again at Miss USA??? Himanvi previously held the title of Miss Virginia Teen USA 2018 but mysterlously went unplaced at Miss Teen USA 2018 but we have seen non-placers at Miss Teen USA go on to win the Miss USA crown like New Yorks Kimberly Pressler in 1999 and Nebraskas Sarah Rose Summers in 2018 so is Himanvi about to take this same path?? Virginia has claimed the Miss USA crown twice and even consecutively thanks to Wendy Dascomb in 1969 and Deborah Shelton in 1970 so is there another win in the cards for the Old Dominion state??\n\nSix Foote Four\n\nTennessees Christell Foote stands above the competition easily being this years tallest delegate with a height of six feet and four inches and thats not even in high heels!!\n\nLong legs have long been a thing to admire in pageants so will Christells height cause her to tower over the competition and take the Miss USA crown??\n\nBut of course, theres much more to this young lady than just height. Hailing from Rocky Top, Christell is an award-winning Sales and Marketing executive giving her the ability to uplift brands like Miss USA. Christell is a sought-after guide to assist up-and-coming leaders and entrepreneurs to carve out a path to success in the world of business. Coaching young people to make their next sale isnt the only things that excites her, she is also enthusiastically follows the world of Formula One racing and she is also a ballet dancer and a scratch golfer. A graduate of the University of Georgia, Christell is clearly very determined as she has been told no many times throughout her life which instills within her the motivation to encourage others to keep trying and find someone to tell them yes and this is further demonstrated by the fact that it took a while for Christell to make it to the Miss USA stage since prior to winning her state title, she was previously 2nd runner up at Miss Tennessee USA 2023, a semifinalist for Miss Tennessee USA 2022, 4th runner up at Miss Georgia USA 2021, a semifinalist at Miss Georgia USA 2020, 1st runner up at Miss Georgia Teen USA 2019 and 3rd runner up at Miss Tennessee Teen USA 2018. Tennessee has long been a successful state at Miss USA boasting two of the best winners, Lynnette Cole in 2000 and Rachel Smith in 2007 but recent years have been on and off for Tennessee sporadically going unplaced in some years like last year but Christell certainly hopes to stand a Foote above the competition and is set on getting that coveted Miss USA crown!\n\nK? K.\n\nWith the age limit removed as of this pageant season for 2024, the oldest contestant to win a Miss USA state title this year is Miss Arizona USA 2024, K Johnson. The K stands for Kristina but she is going by K. K? K. The judges were certainly okay with K being 41 years old and she now holds the record for being the oldest woman to compete on the Miss USA stage. Making history by seizing this opportunity regardless of her age, K believes in shattering age-related limitations and she did so by going after a dream once lost and it paid off. Winning her state title on Memorial Day (May 27), it doesnt offend K to be referred to as the oldest contestant and she wants to spread the message that you can be 40 plus and still be fabulous. K attended college in San Diego and competed for the Miss California USA title four times until she aged out. While she went unplaced on her first three years, K did make the top 10 on what she then thought was her final year of eligibility at Miss California USA 2010 which was won by another notable Johnson; Nicole Johnson who would go on to become the wife of the gold medal winning Olympic champion swimmer, Michael Phelps. Michael and Nicole were dating at the time she won her title and Michael and Nicole now have four sons together: Boomer, 8, Beckett, 6, Maverick, 4, and newly born Nico born in January 2024.\n\nThe top 10 of Miss California USA 2010 features some notable pageant names: On the far left is: Miss Arizona USA 2024, Kristina (K) Johnson and the rest of the competitors pictured here are: Jessica Morgan-sister of Jennifer Morgan-Miss California Teen USA 2002 and 1st runner up to Miss Teen USA 2002, Bianca Castillo Peters (Emmy winning news anchor), Nia Sanchez-Miss USA 2014, Louise Wu (appeared on Ellen DeGeneres talk show), Nana Meriwether-Miss USA 2012, Brittany McGowan-Miss Nevada USA 2015 and 3rd runner up to Miss USA 2015, Bonnie Carmalt (actress), Nicole Johnson-Miss California USA 2010 and top 10 at Miss USA 2010 and Brandi Milloy (TV Host)\n\nK is also one of the mothers competing this year. She says she saw Oprah Winfrey say that some people dont know where theyre going because they dont have a destination in sight so this gave K the determination and drive to go after her dream. K is embracing this experience and the recent resignation of the Miss USA and Miss Teen USA winners doesnt diminish her desire to compete and states that your beauty shouldnt be defined by your age. Dreams have no age limits. Most of this years contestants fall into the previous 18-28 years of age category. This years two youngest contestants are both 19 years old and they are Kansas Bella Whitlock and Wyomings Mackenzie Rush. Arizona inherited its only Miss USA crown in 1980 when Jineane Ford accepted the Miss USA title when the original winner, South Carolinas Shawn Weatherly went on to win Miss Universe 1980. Could K Johnsons unique status win over the judges and get her Arizonas first outright Miss USA win and could this inspire other women over the age of 30 to compete in their Miss USA state pageants?? As previously mentioned, Texas had a 71-year-old contestant with Marissa Teijo of Paso Del Norte so could we be seeing someone even older competing in the near future?? We shall see K? K.\n\nAli Allies\n\nWe have two delegates that share the last name Ali and they are the delegates representing Nevada and Minnesota. Nevadas Najah Ali is a newbie to the pageant world. If you can believe it, this is the first time that someone with no prior experience in the Miss USA state pageant system has won Miss Nevada USA since 2013. With her doll-like face and figure, its easy to see why Najah is a heavy favorite for the Silver State. Najah is a 23-year-old recent summa cum laude graduate with a degree in broadcast journalism from the University of Nevada. She comes from a family of seven and prides herself in being known for her tenacity in setting and achieving her goals. Najah even lived in Italy for six months in 2023 after receiving the prestigious Gilman Scholarship. Nevada won its only Miss USA crown in 2014 thanks to Nia Sanchez and Nevada has had a decent track record in recent years so we shall see if Najah and her broadcasting skills can outtalk the competition and capture the Miss USA crown.\n\nThe other Ali is Minnesotas Muna Ali who always dreamed of becoming the first Somali to be crowned Miss Minnesota USA. On June 23, 2024, that dream came true. She is the first in her family to be a college graduate obtaining a Bachelor of Science Degree in Pre-Med. Muna is also an entrepreneur who has started two home healthcare companies. She is the founder and board member of a peace and social justice college organization and for the past four years, has supported Educare Haiti non-profit, contributing to education and community development for impoverished children. Passionate about living a healthy lifestyle, Muna has also travelled the world having visited 17 countries. Minnesota claimed its only Miss USA crown in 1976 thanks to Barbara Peterson and their placements have been sporadic in recent years but they did make the top 12 in 2022 so could Munas unique style and impressive resumé get her noticed in a big way?\n\nRest in Peace\n\nThe Original Miss USA\n\nJackie Loughery-Miss USA 1952\n\nThe very first Miss USA has left us. Jacqueleen (Jackie) Virginia Loughery became an angel at the age of 93 passing away on February 23, 2024 in Canoga Park, California. Jackie was born on April 18, 1930 in Flatbush, Brooklyn, New York as the daughter and only child of Joseph and Ellen (née Avery) Loughery. Her father served as a Naval intelligence specialist during World War 2 later working for ITT(International Telephone and Telegraph). Her mother, known as Ella came from a musical Brooklyn family. While in Flatbush, Jackie attended New Yorks St. Francis Xavier Academy for Young Ladies. Jackies mother encouraged her show business aspirations from an early age. Jackie worked as a print model and a dancer in a New Orleans nightclub during her teenage years. She was crowned Miss New York State and Miss Rockaway. In 1952, she won the first ever Miss USA pageant leading to a contract with Universal Pictures. Jackie came out to Hollywood, which would end up being home for the rest of her life. She acted during the golden age of television playing lead characters in shows such as Judge Roy Bean and Mr. District Attorney. She was a popular guest star on many TV Westerns including Steve McQueens Wanted series. She worked closely with both Jack Benny and Johnny Carson. Her movie roles culminated in a lead role in Pardners, the Western comedy with Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis. She had a striking turn as blonde femme fatale in Jack Webbs film, The D.I. but Jackie decided to retire from show-business in the 1960s but continued to live in her beloved Encino. She worked in the field of banking until her retirement in the early 1990s and remained active in the Miss USA system and serving as an occasional judge.\n\nJackie was proud to win Miss USA for her state of New York. Described as a pert redhead, Jackie said she was awfully glad that she won due to the glory that would go to her native borough and she was an ardent fan of the New York Dodgers baseball team. When Jackie won Miss USA, she was 22 years old and her measurements were 34-23-34 standing at a height of five-feet and four inches and weighed 108 pounds. She won on a re-vote to break a tie with her first runner-up, Louisianas Jeanne Thompson. Jackie would go on to place among the top 10 at the first official Miss Universe pageant held in 1952 which was won by Finlands Armi Kuusela.\n\nJackie was married three times. Her first husband was the notable crooner Guy Mitchell and they were married from October 26, 1952 (only four months after Jackie won Miss USA on June 27, 1952!) until they divorced on March 9, 1955. Jackie's marriage to Guy shortly after her win meant that she would not complete a full-year reign as Miss USA and her successor, Miss USA 1953, Illinois' Myrna Hansen was crowned instead by Miss New Jersey USA 1952, Ruth Hampton who was among the top 10 of Miss USA 1952. Jackie was married to Jack Webb from June 24, 1958 until March 24, 1964 and they shared homes in Encino, Palm Springs and an apartment on the Republic Pictures lot in Studio City. Jackies final marriage was to Gelsons executive Jack Schwietzer. They remained together in their Encino home from 1969 until Jacks death in 2009. Besides for Jack, the love of Jackies life were her dogs, mostly miniature poodles and mostly always with her. Jackie was survived by her cousins Dalton Avery of Concord, MA, Deanna Avery of Los Angeles, and her lifelong friends Mari Brown of Colorado and Pauline Ganz and Alan Rodriguez of Arizona.\n\nJackie made a few appearances at the Miss USA pageant over the years. During the 1970 Miss USA pageant, Jackie was featured speaking with the color commentator of that pageant, June Lockhart What??? June Lockhart is still alive??? Yes! June is 99 years old! (Of course, you will remember that the main host of the 1970 Miss USA pageant, Bob Barker just passed away last year on August 26, 2023 at the age of 99.) June asked Jackie during the 1970 Miss USA pageant if the pageant had changed much since she became Miss USA. Jackie replied, Oh yes, June! Considerably! Of course, back then, we only had 48 states and we didnt have the facilities that the pageant offers the girls now. By that I mean, we didnt have state costumes and the gowns certainly were not as lavish as they are today. As a matter of fact, I won my pageant in a far-out gown. June then asked if there was a question from the judges to help determine the winner and Jackie replied, Well, not really. They interviewed us for personality and for poise and then they asked us what our hopes were for the future. June asked Jackie what was her answer about her future hopes. Jackie replied, Well, my future hopes, my answer was that I wanted to become an actress and I did become an actress. I signed a contract with Universal Studios and then I acted in many of their television shows and movies and they have been very loyal to me, June. Im going back to do a number of the television shows for them this season. June said it was lovely talking to Jackie and she looked forward to seeing Jackie on television to which Jackie replied, Thank you. Youre lovely.\n\nJackie would later appear as a judge for the 1995 Miss USA pageant where coincidentally during the round of judges questions, the delegate representating the state of New York (which Jackie also represented at Miss USA), Shanna Moakler randomly selected Jackie to ask Shanna her question which was, Yes. Um, Miss New York. Uh. Some surveys indicate that more and more women are buying handguns to protect themselves. Would you ever buy a handgun to protect yourself? Shanna answered, I definitely feel that its every Americans right to protect themselves with arms and I would if I felt that I was unsecure[sic], uh, in society, I would definitely buy arms. I think its every human beings right. That answer would get Shanna into the top 3 for Miss USA 1995 but she would finish as 1st runner up to Texas Chelsi Smith who went on to win Miss Universe 1995 allowing Shanna Moakler to inherit the title of Miss USA 1995. Jackie did not return to any other Miss USA pageants after this appearance. The 2011 Miss USA pageant had a reunion of titleholders for the 60th anniversary of Miss USA and while Jackies successors, Miss USA 1953, Illinois Myrna Hansen and Miss USA and Universe 1954, South Carolinas Miriam Stevenson were in attendance, Jackie did not attend but she will forever go down in history as the first Miss USA which is an honor of a lifetime and her life was certainly long and wonderful. Thank you, Jackie Youre lovely.\n\nRest in Peace, Jackie Loughery-Miss USA 1952 (April 18, 1930  February 23, 2024)\n\nSo as of July 21, Toms tentative top 5 for Miss USA 2024 are:\n\n1.
