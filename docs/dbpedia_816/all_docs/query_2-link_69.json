From my window on popular culture, I can see all that sizzles and excites. I have interviewed legends who have left us, such as Bette Davis and Sammy Davis, Jr., and have brushed shoulders with the names who have caused\n\na commotion with their sheer outrageousness, like Boy George and Madonna. Whether it’s by nature or by design, pop icons generate interest, and I think they are a mirror of who we are at any given time. Who are your heroes and heroines, the people you most admire? Outside of your own family and friends, to whom do you look for inspiration and guidance, as examples of the type of person you would like to be as an adult? How do we decide who will be the most popular and influential members of our society? You may be surprised by your answers. According to recent polls, you will probably respond much differently than your parents or grandparents did to the same questions at the same age. Increasingly, world leaders such as Winston\n\nChurchill, John F. Kennedy, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and\n\nevangelist Billy Graham have been replaced by entertainers, athletes, and popular artists as the individuals whom young people most respect and admire. In surveys taken during each of the past 15 years, for example, General Norman Schwarzkopf was the only world leader chosen as the number-one hero among high school students. Other names on the elite list joined by General Schwarzkopf included Paula Abdul, Michael Jackson, Michael Jordan, Eddie Murphy, Burt Reynolds, and Sylvester\n\nStallone.\n\nOOK\n\nkkk\n\nOk\n\nkt\n\nkk\n\ntk\n\nMore than 30 years have passed since Canadian sociologist Marshall McLuhan first taught us the huge impact that the electronic media have had on how we think, learn, and understand—as well as how we choose\n\nour heroes. In the 1960s, Pop artist Andy Warhol predicted that there would soon come a time when every American would be famous for 15 minutes. But if it is easier today to achieve Warhol’s 15 minutes of fame, it is also much harder to hold on to it. Reputations are often ruined as quickly as they are made. And yet, there remain those artists and performers who continue to inspire and instruct us in spite of changes in world events, media technology, or popular tastes. Even in a society as fickle and fast moving as our own, there are still those performers whose work and reputation endure, pop culture legends who inspire an almost religious devotion from their fans. Why do the works and personalities of some artists continue to fascinate us while others are so quickly forgotten? What, if any, qualities do they share that enable them to have such power over our lives? There are no easy answers to these questions. The artists and entertainers profiled in this series often have little more in common than the enormous influence that each of them has had on our lives. Some offer us an escape. Artists such as actress Marilyn Monroe, comedian Groucho Marx, and writer Stephen King have used glamour, humor, or fantasy to help us escape from our everyday lives. Others present us with images that are all too recognizable. The uncompromising realism of actor and director Charlie Chaplin and folk singer Bob Dylan challenges\n\nus to confront and change the things in our world that most disturb us. Some offer us friendly, reassuring experiences. The work of animator Walt Disney and late-night talk show host Johnny Carson, for example, provides us with a sense of security and continuity in a changing world. Others shake us up. The best work of composer John Lennon and actor James Dean will always inspire their fans to question and reevaluate the world in which they live. It is also hard to predict the kind of life that a pop culture legend will lead, or how he or she will react to fame. Popular singers Michael Jackson\n\nKKK\n\nKK KKK\n\nKKK\n\nKKK\n\nKKK\n\nKk KKK\n\nkkk\n\nand Prince carefully guard their personal lives from public view. Other performers, such as popular singer Madonna, enjoy putting their private lives before the public eye. What these artists and entertainers do share, however, is the rare ability to capture and hold the public’s imagination in a world dominated by mass media and disposable celebrity. In spite of their differences, each of them has somehow managed to achieve legendary status in a popular culture that values novelty and change. The books in this series examine the lives and careers of these and other pop culture legends, and the society that places such great value on their work.\n\nEach book considers the extraordinary talent, the stubborn\n\ncommitment, and the great personal sacrifice required to create work of enduring quality and influence in today’s world. As you read these books, ask yourself the following questions: How are the careers of these individuals shaped by their society? What role do they play in shaping the world? And what is it that so captivates us about their lives, their work, or the images they present? Hopefully, by studying the lives and achievements of these pop culture legends, we will learn more about ourselves.\n\nWeer:\n\nMet\n\n+ *\n\n*\n\n.:\n\neee\n\nxe ®\n\nety\n\n* *\n\n*\n\n°\n\n» Carried earrie Away\n\na\n\nALLED OUT OF A FACULTY MEETING in the spring of 1973, Stephen King drove home as fast as he could. As he had done every weekday since 1971, the 26-year-old King taught six classes of English at Hampden Academy, a small public school in Maine across the Penobscot River from Bangor. He carried a satchel full of student papers to read before he could turn to his real work—writing. A good teacher with a family to support, he earned just $6,400 per year, barely enough to sustain one person. Times were very hard. In March, the Kings had been forced to cancel their telephone service because they could no longer afford it. So King’s wife, Tabitha, had used a\n\nphone across the street from their home to call her husband and tell him that a telegram had arrived with news that would transform their lives. The financial strain had begun to wear the Kings down. With their two small children, Naomi and Joseph, they lived in a rented trailer, and money\n\nwas always tight. They had had to sublet one room in their already overcrowded home to King’s childhood friend, Chris Chesley, to pay the rent. Stephen King struggled financially before his first novel, Carrie, was published in 1973. King had originally thrown out the manuscript of Carrie, but his wife rescued the pages from the garbage and urged him to continue.\n\nK STEPHEN\n\nStevens Hall housed the English department at the University of Maine at Orono in the late 1960s, when\n\nKing attended the college. Upon King’s graduation in 1970, he failed to find a job\n\nin which he would be able to use his English degree. Instead, King worked at a\n\ngas station and at a laundry.\n\nKING®\n\nKing and his wife had met five years earlier, when they were both students at the University of Maine at Orono. Everyone on campus recognized Stephen King, atall, shambling figure who wrote a popular column called “King’s Garbage Truck” for the campus newspaper. Most impressively, as an undergraduate he co-taught a course on popular culture. Politically active, he protested the Vietnam War and worked for civil rights. He and Tabitha, a history major, started dating after they met working in the stacks of the library during his junior and her sophomore year. The two hada lot in common—they had both grown up in Maine, and they were both writers. In 1970, King received his English degree and graduated with honors. They were married in January 1971, during her senior year. The future seemed promising for this bright young couple.\n\nKCARRIED\n\nAWAY\n\nBut when King graduated, he discovered that an En-\n\nglish degree did not automatically guarantee him employment. Too many other people with liberal arts educations were looking for work; the only job he could find was at a gas station. Soon he obtained another job at a laundry, earning $60 per week. Finally, he landed a teaching position where he could use his academic training, even\n\nif his salary was not enough to cover the bills. Tabitha went to work at Dunkin’ Donuts, and King sometimes moonlighted at the laundry. Nevertheless, King still held on to his childhood dream. When he was two years old, his father had disappeared. Stephen’s mother, Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King, tried to support Stephen and his older brother, David, by herself. The family had to move frequently so she could find work, and they stayed with various relatives. Ruth King always worked several jobs at one time, and her only “vacations” were found in the pages of the books she read and treasured. By age seven, Stephen King was writing. At first it was just for fun, but it soon became his dream to be a successful writer, and he became very disciplined and\n\ndedicated to writing. After moving around alot, his mother took 11-yearold Stephen and his brother back to Maine, where she had grown up, so she could care for her ailing parents. Stephen and David would live here until they went to college. It was at this time that King met Chris Chesley, a classmate, and they began to write together. Since then, through all the hard times growing up, during college, and in the years he spent teaching, King always found time in every day—either early in the morning before he went to work, or late at night after the kids had gone to sleep—to spend a few hours writing. Those hours were difficult but the most compelling of the day. Piled on a shelf were more than 2,000 pages of\n\n13\n\nK STEPHEN\n\nKING&\n\nunpublished manuscripts and a stack of rejection slips. But he believed in his potential as a writer, and his endeavors eventually did pull in some extra money. Sometimes King was able to sell short stories to magazines. He would write a story, send it off to a magazine, and start writing the next story. If a magazine editor decided to publish a story, he still had to wait until it actually was in print before he received a check for his work. He counted on the checks to arrive just in time to “buy penicillin for one of the kids’ ear infections or help meet the rent,” paying off whatever bills demanded the\n\nmost immediate attention. The stress of their uncertain way of life took its toll. Sometimes King drank too much beer. Sometimes, sit-\n\nting up with his sick, crying baby at three o’clock in the morning in the living room of the trailer, he wondered whether he would ever become a successful writer. In 1972, King had sent several of his novels to pub-\n\nlishers in New York City, who had rejected them. Occasionally, King had received some encouraging feedback from editors. One of his manuscripts was still at Doubleday for review, but he did not have high hopes for it. Actually, he disliked that particular novel.\n\nThe idea had seemed interesting at first. He had noticed that books like Ira Levin’s Rosemary's Baby (1967)\n\nand William P. Blatty’s The Exorcist (1970) had gotten a lot of attention, so he had tried to write his own supernatural horror novel instead of the usual naturalistic tales he wrote. He made some notes and began writing the story, but he got bored with it and threw the first few chapters in the trash. Tabitha, however, had fished the manuscript out of the garbage, read it, and told her husband that she really liked it and that he should try to finish it. King took another look at the story. He had culled elements from his life to write it, from his high school\n\n14\n\n°\n\nKCARRIED\n\nAWAYX\n\ndays and his job as a teacher. There had been a strange, nerdy girl at his high school. She was overweight, had greasy hair and pimples, and did not talk to other people much. What had she really been like? he wondered. He began to write about her interior life. Then he added a twist to the plot. What if this lonely outcast had telekinetic powers? To fill out the story he added some realistic newspaper accounts, as if he had had a scrapbook of the media’s investigation into the girl’s story. This made the book longer and gave it an authentic flavor. He still did not like the manuscript, but he sent it to Doubleday anyway. But as he drove his car home on that spring day in 1973 after his wife’s phone call, none of his writing ef-\n\nforts seemed to matter. His family was barely surviving above the poverty line. The checks from the sales of his short stories were sporadic and could not be counted on, and recently he had taken on the additional responsibility of caring for his mother, who had cancer. He did not\n\nknow what he could do to keep all their heads above water. Moreover, he was beginning to doubt that he would ever be taken seriously as a writer. As he drove up to his family’s trailer, Tabitha was waiting outside, holding an envelope. It was a telegram. Chesley stood in the doorway, watching. When King got out of the car he probably thought the telegram contained bad news because Tabitha was crying. She ran up to him holding the telegram and told him that Carrie—his novel that he had detested so much— had been accepted for publication by Doubleday. King would be receiving an advance check for $2,500 within days. King stood in front of his trailer and put his arms around his wife and cried. Chesley, who had known King for more than 10 years, looked on for a few minutes, then\n\nwent back inside the trailer and tried to keep the kids 5\n\nKSTEPHEN\n\nKING&\n\nCarrie (actress Sissy Spacek) and Tommy (actor William Katt) are selected as King and Queen of the Bates High School prom in the 1976 movie Carrie. King’s Carrie, a best-selling novel, was the first of his\n\nworks to be made into a movie.\n\nquiet while his two friends had a private moment of happiness together. A month and a half later, on Mother’s Day, King got a telephone call: Doubleday had sold the paperback rights to Carrie for $400,000. King received half of that amount.\n\nWithin a few months, his whole life would\n\nchange. He could resign from his teaching position—he enjoyed it and the students liked him, but he wanted to write full-time. He and his family could move out of their trailer and buy a house. But most of all, King wanted to do something special for Tabitha, who had stuck by him\n\nPuLG\n\nKCARRIED\n\nAWAYX%\n\nthrough the worst of times and had always encouraged him to keep writing. She had even rescued Carrie from the trash. He wanted to buy her a great present now that he had money to spend on her. He walked around their small town for hours, looking in shop windows for the perfect present that would show his wife how much he appreciated her support and love. But his life had changed so quickly that he was totally overwhelmed—“freaked out,” is how he phrased it. He could not concentrate. He shopped aimlessly, in a daze, and finally, he decided to buy her a hair dryer. It was not quite the gesture he had hoped to make, but Tabitha knew her husband, and he thought she would understand what he was trying to say. Since 1973, King has published over 30 books, more than half of which have been made into movies. Today he is paid millions of dollars for each book he writes. A huge media storm accompanies every new Stephen King book that comes out—television and radio interviews, newspaper stories, reviews of the book, and even discussions about how much money he will receive in advance and how much in royalties. He rarely appears at book conventions anymore. If he does, he inevitably ends up\n\nbeing mobbed by fans. Thousands of people line up for hours just for the privilege of seeing King or perhaps getting an autograph. It is impossible for him to sign as many as are requested— he gets tired after only 40 autographs. So he tends to remain secluded with his family in a big, rambling Victorian mansion—complete with a wrought-iron fence decorated with bats and spiders—in Bangor, Maine. He also owned a radio station, WZON\n\nin Bangor, where for\n\na time he made sure rock music prevailed. There is no doubt that King is enormously popular. He seems to have a profound effect on a variety of people. Many critics complain that his books are not “serious”\n\n17\n\nK STEPHEN\n\nKING&\n\nand dismiss him as a blood-and-guts, gross-out type of horror writer. The bad reviews hurt him. But why would simple horror attract so much attention? The truth is, some of King’s novels are fantasy stories,.some are sciKing, photographed here\n\nence fiction, and at least one is just a fairy tale. Even his\n\nin the 1970s, maintains that\n\nmost “horrible” novels are actually stories about real\n\nhis novels are not merely horror tales but stories about real people and how they react in extreme circumstances. He takes readers out of the ordinary world and frightens them with his suggestions that the terrifying situations he creates could happen to them.\n\nhuman relationships and how people operate in extreme circumstances.\n\nCertain themes, like the lost father and the monstrous machine, occur and recur; train accidents often loom large. And King pays a great deal of attention to what goes on in his society: the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, nuclear accidents, toxic waste. One dedicated critic, Tony Magistrale, argues that “King’s fiction . . . is contemporary social satire, revealing\n\nKCARRIED\n\nAWAYX%\n\ncollective cultural fears and fantasies.” His work reflects “the current maladies of our social relationships,” especially “the narcissistic concern with the self . . . fostered by discontent-with institutions.” Social narcissism means being concerned only with one’s own pleasures and performance, ignoring the social contract and the greater needs of society at large. In King’s work, the circumstances are a little bit more\n\nextreme than the average person might expect. For example, a winter storm might strand a family in a haunted hotel, and the father might begin to act strangely. Or a writer may suddenly discover he has an evil twin who is murdering everyone he ever knew. Ora devilishly charming old man might open an antique store that turns out to have human souls on its shelves. King concocts these bizarre and frightening situations, digging into his own\n\nsecret fears to find them, and drops in regular people like his readers. Perhaps that is why his books sell so well: the reader sees how he or she might act ina situation with which—hopefully—he or she will never be confronted. King still remembers how impressed he was asa child when he read The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, one of the books in C. S. Lewis’s Narnia series. The heroine,\n\nLucy, goes into a closet and drops into another world. That is what King wants to do—drop readers out of the ordinary world—and he wants to scare people. King’s books are favorites worldwide. But King sees himself as a regular person who works hard fora living. He said in an interview, “For me, writing is like a little\n\nhole in reality that you can go through and you can get out and you can be somewhere else for a while. I live a very ordinary life. I have the children, and I have the wife—except for this thing that I do, this glitch, it’s a very ordinary life.”\n\nae aesKING WAS BORN ON September 21, 1947. Two years later, his\n\nfather, Donald Edwin King, went out for a pack of cigarettes and never came back home. He had married Nellie Ruth Pillsbury, who was called Ruth, in 1939, before he left with the merchant marine during World War II. Born in Peru, Indiana, to a family that had come from Ireland some years before,\n\nDonald King had very poor eyesight, a characteristic his son inherited. King describes his father in his critically acclaimed nonfiction book, Danse Maca-\n\nbre, as “a man of average height, handsome in a 1940’s sort of way, a bit podgy, bespectacled.”\n\nYears later, Stephen King would find his father’s legacy in his aunt Ethelyn’s attic. Donald King had accumulated a large collection of paperback books, all fantasy and horror. He could always be found with a book, which\n\nwhen he was in the company of others he pretended was a Western. Stephen’s father had wanted to be a writer, and he created many science fiction and horror short stories. None of Donald’s stories were ever published, but Stephen did find a few encouraging rejection slips. In this illustration from H. G. Wells’s 1898 classic novel, The War of the Worlds, a man encounters a Martian as the creature’s flying disk opens. The Wells story about Martians invading Earth was one of King’s favorites as a child because it frightened him.\n\n2I\n\nK STEPHEN\n\nKING®\n\nRuth Pillsbury King told her son that she was distantly related to the well-known purveyors of instant crescent rolls, but theirs was a very distant relation indeed. She grew up in Maine; her father was a carpenter, and her mother was an intelligent, well-read housewife. Pillsbury played piano‘ very well and had an eccentric sense of humor. She married Donald King in Croton-onHudson, New York, in 1939. When Donald King returned from World War II in 1945, the couple adopted a boy, David, because Ruth’s doctor said that she would never be able to bear children. The Kings moved to Maine, where Donald worked as a door-to-door salesman for various companies, including the Electrolux vacuum cleaner company. He began spending much of his time on the road for business. However, on September 21, 1947, much to the Kings’\n\nsurprise, Stephen was born at Maine General Hospital in Portland. Donald was spending more and more time away from home, and in 1949, when he left for good, Ruth had to\n\nraise her two small children by herself. The closest Ruth came to criticizing her errant husband was to say that he lacked sticking power. Stephen King stated that his mother “landed on her feet, scrambling. Somehow she kept things together, as women before her have done and as other women are doing now as we speak.” She began working a succession of low-wage jobs to support her family. They had to move often, as Ruth searched for better jobs, and they sometimes had to move in with other members of their family. At one time, Stephen King stayed with his aunt Ethelyn, one of his mother’s sisters, in Durham, Maine, while\n\nDavid stayed with Molly, another maternal aunt, in Massachusetts. Their mother was forced to work elsewhere and could not keep the family together for this brief period, though she did visit both her sons.\n\nwid\n\nKGROWING\n\nUP*\n\nWhen the boys and their mother were reunited, they moved to Chicago, Illinois, and lived with Donald King’s\n\nMerchant marines in training stand in formation on a ship\n\nfive. A year later they moved to De Pere, Wisconsin,\n\nin 1938, one year before the outbreak of World War Il. Stephen's father, Donald King, was a captain in the\n\nwhere they lived in a house and got a dog. Their next move was to Fort Wayne, Indiana, where they stayed with\n\nU.S. merchant marine during the war. Stephen\n\nparents, the Spanskys (Donald had changed his last name). Stephen was about three years old, and David was\n\nDonald King’s sister, Betty, who was a schoolteacher, and\n\nher friend Rudy. Finally, they got their own apartment, also in Fort Wayne, which David King says they shared with “a number of cockroaches.” The moves continued throughout Stephen’s youth. Still, remembering those years, King says, “ours wasn’t a\n\n13\n\nnever knew his father; when\n\nStephen was two years old Donald left home and never returned.\n\nWKSTEPHEN\n\nKING®\n\nlife of unremitting misery by any means, and we never missed a meal.” Ruth worked constantly, sometimes having two or In this scene from the 1932 movie Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, the evil Mr. Hyde (right), played by Fredric March, looks sinisterly at a companion in a bar.

She also read to her sons, especially “Classics Comics,” illustrated versions of great works of literature. Her favorites—and Stephen’s— were the more frightening stories, such as H. G. Wells’s The Time Machineand The War ofthe Worlds, and Robert Louis Stevenson’s The Strange Case ofDr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. When many years later in 1979 an interviewer asked\n\nKing how he felt about children reading horror stories,\n\nKGROWING\n\nUP®\n\nhis answer was: “I don’t know. I did, and it warped me\n\nreally good!” Presumably, this sense of being “warped” is part of King’s background as a writer, something he approves of and cherishes. According to his mother, when Stephen was four years\n\nold, he went out to play with a friend but returned sooner than expected, looking pale and shocked. Ruth asked him why he was home so soon, but he would not—or could not—speak for the rest of the day. Later that day, she found out that his friend had been run over bya freight train, possibly in Stephen’s presence. Yet King has absolutely no memory of this accident. Psychologists have speculated that King has been reliving the death of his friend in his subconscious ever since it happened, and that this explains King’s fascination with the horror genre. King, however, disputes this theory. “I think that writers are made, not born or created out of dreams or childhood trauma, that becoming a writer . . . is a direct result of conscious will,” he wrote in Danse Macabre. Still, if the impulse is subconscious, he would not\n\nnecessarily be aware that witnessing this accident is the reason for his fascination with horror. Although it is true that becoming a writer requires “conscious will,” it is also true that not every writer chooses to write about the often gruesome subjects that King depicts. Despite King’s denials, this early experience of seeing his friend die might\n\nhave contributed greatly to his later writing. Certainly, accidents involving trains occur in a number of King’s stories. ‘Some of King’s dreams have worked their way into his\n\nfiction. In the chapter entitled “An Annoying Autobiographical Pause” in Danse Macabre, King reported one vivid nightmare that he had had at about age eight: “I saw the body of a hanged man dangling from the arm of a scaffold on a hill. This corpse bore a sign: ROBERT\n\n5\n\nK STEPHEN\n\nKING&\n\nBURNS. When the wind caused the corpse to turn in the air, I saw that it was my face—rotted and picked by the birds, but obviously mine. And then the corpse opened its eyes and looked at me.” Sixteen years later, he used this dream, changing the name of the corpse to Hubie\n\nMarsten, as a central image in Salem's Lot. Another dream recurs every so often in moments of stress and sends King shivering to Tabitha’s side of the bed. As he describes in Danse Macabre: I am writing a novel in an old house . . . in a third floor room. A door on the far side communicates with the attic and I know—I know she [a homicidal maniac] is in there,\n\nand sooner or later the sound of my typewriter will cause her to come after me. She finally comes through the door ... all gray hair and crazed eyes, wielding a meat ax. And when I run, I discover that somehow the house has. . .\n\ngotten ever so much bigger—and I’m totally lost.\n\nKing jokes that the madwoman in his attic might be a critic for the New York Times Book Review. He admits that bad reviews make painful reading. But he writes and talks about these dreams to make the important point that traumatic events do not make the writer. Instead, writers use material from all stages of their lives to create a successful finished work, but talented writers first work and study hard, then hone what they have observed, read,\n\nand dreamed into a shapely, well-paced narrative. Throughout the King family’s constant changes in location, Ruth managed to instill in her sons a strong Methodist background, always requiring them to attend church and Bible school. “There was a high premium on maintaining a pleasant exterior—saying ‘please’ and ‘thank you’ even if you’re on the Titanic and it’s going down, because that was the way you were supposed to behave,” King told critic Douglas E. Winter in a 1982 interview.\n\n26\n\nKGROWING\n\nUP*\n\nAs far back as King can remember, he was very interested in good storytelling. Bible stories he first heard when he was six years old remain vivid. Other stories found their way into young Stephen’s life, too; in 1953,\n\ntwo years after the incident in which his friend was killed, Stephen stood outside his mother’s closed bedroom door as she listened to a Ray Bradbury story called “Mars Is Heaven!” on the radio. In the radio drama, space travelers land on Mars and\n\nfind themselves in what looks like their hometown— Greentown, Illinois. They are welcomed into the homes Science fiction writer Ray Bradbury poses with space attire in a 1959 photograph. When King was six years old, he wanted to listen\n\nto a radio adaptation of Bradbury's story “Mars Is Heaven!” one night, but his mother would not allow it. Nevertheless, he listened to the story through his mother’s closed bedroom door and afterward was so scared by what he had heard that he could not fall asleep.\n\n21\n\nK STEPHEN\n\nKING&\n\nof beloved parents, teachers, and sweethearts who have\n\ndied; they celebrate. Only one space traveler remains quite rightly distrustful. For, in the night, the familiar\n\nfaces melt away, and the travelers who thought they had found their way to heaven are all massacred. Stephen crept back to his room and tried, unsuccessfully, to persuade his big brother to let him sleep in his bed for safety. He later wrote that, scared out of his wits,\n\n“T slept in the doorway, where the real and rational light of the bathroom bulb could shine on my face.” He considers himself the last of the generation that was spellbound by radio drama, a medium designed to\n\nrouse fear and trembling in its listeners as they imagined monsters far more terrifying than today’s special effects that appear on atelevision or movie screen. “ \"A bug ten feet tall is pretty horrible,’ the audience thinks, “but I can deal with a ten-foot-bug. [In my imagination] I was afraid it might be a hundred feet tall,” King wrote in “Radio and the Set of Reality,” a\n\nchapter in Danse Macabre. He also had great storytellers around him. As he describes in Danse Macabre:\n\nSome of the best yarns in those days were spun by my Uncle Clayton, a great old character who had never lost\n\nhis childlike sense of wonder. Uncle Clayt would cock his hunting cap back on his mane of white hair . .. and launch into great stories, not only about ghosts but about local legends and scandals, family goings-on, the exploits of Paul Bunyan.\n\nNot only could Uncle Clayton transport young Stephen into another world, but he could also “line bees.” That is, Uncle Clayton could follow a bee back to the\n\nhive. He could also locate water by dowsing (using a divining rod that supposedly dips over the right spot when underground water is found). One dry summer, Uncle Clayton “magically” located a well, but the family\n\n‘28\n\nKGROWING\n\nUP*\n\ndid not have the money to drill for it. Years later when the Kings could afford to drill, the well came in just where\n\nUncle Clayton said it would.\n\n“Bone-skeptical” if credulous, King suspects that logical explanations exist for dowsing, but he quotes the\n\nsaying of British scientist J. B. S. Haldane: “The universe is not only queerer than we suppose, but it is queerer than we can suppose.” Even as a child, King read voraciously. Among his absolute favorites was Robert Louis Stevenson’s The\n\nStrange Case ofDr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, in which the good doctor is transformed by a magic potion into a homicidal monster. King remembers an incident in second grade, when his teacher caught him reading a book by Jack London in class. The book was The Call of the Wild, generally considered to be difficult material for a sevenyear-old. Certainly his teacher thought so; she accused him of only pretending to read, and kept him after school. King had to read the book aloud to prove he could do it. Of course, he passed her test. It is hard to imagine the husky, tall man that King is\n\ntoday ever having had a sick day in his life, but King was often ill during his childhood. He was even out of school for an entire year, bedridden. During these times, he had plenty of opportunity to read, and he also started to write. He began by copying some of the stories that he read, and then he became motivated to write his own stories. One of the earliest was about dinosaurs taking over the world,\n\nwhich was much like the simplistic adventure stories he was reading at the time. A scientist discovers that the dinosaurs are allergic to leather (an idea that has no basis\n\nin fact, but bear in mind, King was only seven years old at the time), and the townspeople throw all their leather coats, car seats, boots, and saddles at the dinosaurs. The dinosaurs run away. A clever story, it shows that King thought about storytelling at a very early age.\n\n29\n\nwK STEPHEN\n\nKING&\n\nIn the 1954 film The Creature from the Black Lagoon, the half-man, half-fish creature seen here is discovered by scientists near the Amazon River. Although the seven-year-old Stephen knew that the creature in the movie was not real, the\n\nmonster still terrified him. King believes today that children are the best audience for the genre of horror because they can easily suspend disbelief.\n\nKing still remembers seeing his first horror movie, The Creature from the Black Lagoon, at a drive-in theater. One scene still haunts him—the monster, slowly but surely, walls in the idyllic hero and heroine, as they cavort,\n\ninnocent and unaware, in a lovely pool. Even at age seven, King knew that the creature was not real. Nonetheless, it became ingrained in his mind. It visited his dreams, waited in the closet, lurked in the\n\nbathroom at the end of the dark hall. He was the perfect audience for horror movies.\n\n30\n\nKGROWING\n\nUP®\n\nIn fact, King thinks children are the perfect audience for horror films because they do not make sharp distinctions between reality and the imagination. They can suspend disbelief. They might know that the dead woman who suddenly comes after Danny in The Shining is really an actress earning her salary, but they scream because they are as frightened as they would be if they were the pursued. The “willing suspension of disbelief,” which the English poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge talked about, is how audiences accept poetry, fantasy, or any work of the imagination. Disbelief, King says, is very heavy, “a lead weight.” He feels some sympathy for people who tell him they dismiss fantasy, science fiction, and horror because\n\nthey are not real. “The muscles of the imagination” have grown too flabby. They are simply too weak to “lift the weight of imagination.” Kids may be small, but “they are the jugglers of the invisible world,” accepting with ease talking trees, mice in tuxedos, and fat Santas who slide down narrow chimneys. And horror stories, like fairy tales, give children and\n\nadults ways to handle and come to terms with their fears. Always interested in monsters, as a child King devoured Fate, an occultist magazine. He sees that his attraction to horror stories has a solid psychological basis. His childhood nightmares were inadequacy dreams, “standing up to salute the flag and having my pants fall down” or getting to class unprepared. Without a father, he needed his “own power trips.” His alter ego as a child was the made-up daredevil Cannonball Cannon, a hero\n\nwho “did good deeds” at home and in the West. In a June 1983 Playboy interview with Eric Norden, King described himself as “prey to a lot of conflicting emotions as a child.” Despite having friends, Stephen “often felt unhappy and different.” Buck-toothed with thick glasses, “I was a fat kid—husky was the euphemism\n\n3]\n\nwKSTEPHEN\n\nKING&\n\nthey used in the clothing store—and pretty poorly coordinated, always the last picked when we chose [sports] teams.” There were compensations. Stephen King began his lifelong love of rock-and-roll music early. His first record,\n\na Christmas gift from.his mother, included Elvis Presley's “Hound Dog” on one side and “Don’t Be Cruel” on the other. He played that 78 rpm until the grooves were worn down. Discovering rock and roll meant “finding something that was very, very powerful. It made you bigger than you were . . . tough even if you weren’t tough. I just love rock and roll,” King told Mat Schaffer in an October\n\n31, 1983, radio interview. King still plays the guitar, and he remains as committed to rock and roll as ever. When King was 10 years old, his family lived in Stratford, Connecticut, where King came to a realization\n\nthat he has said was a turning point in his life. On October 4, 1957, he attended a Saturday matinee of Earth us. the Flying Saucers, a mediocre science fiction film,\n\nwhich was not particularly frightening, but King remembers it vividly because the projectionist stopped the screening midreel and the house lights came on. The theater manager came out, stood in front of the blank\n\nmovie screen, and announced that the Soviet Union, which was an enemy superpower of the United States’s at the time, had successfully launched a space satellite, Sputnik I, into orbit. Then the lights went down, and the\n\nTechnicolor monsters on-screen continued their attack on humankind. This may not seem like a cataclysmic event today, when so many countries have satellites in orbit and the United States has sent people to the moon many times over. But in 1957, the United States and the Soviet Union were locked in a standoff called the cold war, both racing for technical superiority. As King describes it, he\n\nwas\n\n“\n\n“a member\n\nof that entire generation .\n\n(2\n\n.\n\nof war\n\nKGROWING\n\nUP® On October 4, 1957, the\n\nSoviet Union launched the first space satellite, Sputnik |,a replica of which is shown here. The fact that the chief rival of the United States had managed to get ahead of them in the “space race” shocked and frightened most Americans. King remembers the news of Sputnik’s launch as the time when his innocence was lost.\n\nbabies . . . reared smug in the myth of America’s military invincibility and moral supremacy.” The idea that the Soviet Union could have beaten the United States in the race into space was terrifying. At that moment, the imaginary horror of his childhood became the reality of an adult world where his way of life really could be threatened. He remembers it as one of the most frightening and depressing moments of his life, the moment when his innocence was lost.\n\n33\n\n.\n\nes te\n\nK yy\n\n*\n\nI: 1958, WHEN STEPHEN WAS 11 and David was that her parents, Guy Pillsbury and Nellie Fogg their eighties and in poor health, needed help. Her arrangement: they would all help her out financially\n\n13, Ruth King realized Pillsbury, who were in sisters offered Ruth an if she would move into\n\nthe modest farmhouse down a dirt road in Durham, Maine’s western section,\n\nknown as Methodist Corner. She would aid their ailing parents, acting as a nurse-caretaker. Caring for the two invalids would not be an easy job, but Ruth would lovingly tend to her parents, and the family would settle down in a town they already knew well. Stephen had been spending his summers there with his aunt and uncle, and now he and David could go to school without fear of having to move before the end of the year. At last they could put down roots and live a more stable life. Ruth and her sons moved into the little house in Durham, a small working-class town.\n\nStephen attended classes in a one-room schoolhouse. His teacher described him as “a smart, friendly, outgoing boy” who was always writing. He attended This picture of Stephen King appeared in the Lisbon High School yearbook in 1966, the year he graduated.

Years later, in a 1983 interview with Eric Norden,\n\nKing said, “For ten years, we lived a virtual barter existence, practically never seeing any hard cash. If we needed food, relatives would bring a bag of groceries; ifwe needed clothes, there'd always be hand-me-downs.” In the summers, the well went dry, and water had to\n\nbe trucked in. The house also had no indoor plumbing. Stephen and David had to walk to their aunt’s house for baths, and if Stephen needed to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, he had to make his way across a\n\ndark backyard to the blue outhouse. King always was and still is afraid of the dark. “I suffered from any number of irrational fears,” he admits. Stefan Kanfer, who interviewed King for a Time cover story in October 1986 listed King’s fears as “spiders, elevators, closed-in places, the dark, sewers, funerals, the idea of being buried alive, cancer, heart attacks, the\n\nnumber 13, black cats and walking under ladders.” King reasons that his fears stem from the fact that he was and is “unreservedly credulous.”\n\nThe introduction to Nightmares & Dreamscapes, the most recent collection of his short stories, begins, “When\n\nI was a kid I believed everything I was told, everything I read, and every dispatch sent out by my own overheated imagination.” The last on his block to decide that “those street-corner Santas meant there was no rea/Santa,” King accepted his uncle’s assertion that you could tear a person’s shadow with a steel tent-peg and his aunt’s belief that shivering meant a goose had just walked over your eventual grave. And he believed school-yard yarns even when they contradicted themselves. Somehow, simultaneously, he managed to believe that a dime left on a railroad track would derail a train and that the same dime left on a track\n\n36\n\nWKITHE\n\nMAINE\n\nYEARS*® A view from Acadia National Park on Mt.

King wrote that his “primary sources of wonderful\n\nand amazing facts in those days were the paperback compilations from Ripley’s Believe It or Not!” Ripley’s curiosities were real to King, teaching him “how fine\n\nthe line between the fabulous and the humdrum could sometimes be.”\n\nDespite their poverty, King told spgrts announcer Mel Allen, his mother “was determined that David and I\n\n37\n\nK STEPHEN\n\nKING®\n\nwould go to college. She always told us that dreams and ambitions can cause bitterness if they’re not realized, and she encouraged me to submit my writings.” Around 1960, Stephen and David made a discovery that would change their lives. On a chilly autumn day in the attic over their aunt and uncle’s garage, the boys discovered a box filled with possessions their father had left behind. Inside were memorabilia from the merchant marine, including scrapbooks, manuals, and the maritime uniform Donald had worn, as well as Super 8 movie reels. The brothers rented a movie projector and watched films of their father taken sometime during World War II. There was also some color footage of Donald King standing on the deck of a ship waving. Both David and Stephen have said that they still feel some anger toward their absent father, but they do not seem to think about him often. Another box proved even more precious: it contained a treasure trove of paperback books—horror tales—and Stephen proceeded to read every one of them. In particular, King remembers books by H. P. Lovecraft, a popular horror writer of the twenties and thirties, as well as other stories from Weird Tales magazine. Stephen had seen horror movies, but they were B movies (low-budget) and\n\nhard to take seriously. He was struck by the sincerity of these books. Not just silly camp, horror was something that could be done well and that could really scare people. His mother told him that his father had written stories and tried to have them published. Stephen found rejection slips, some of which were encouraging, but none of Donald’s work had’ survived. Stephen had been writing stories since he was seven without even suspecting that his father had written them, too. In 1959, Stephen met Chris Chesley, another creative young man who shared his interest in reading good stories and trying to write them. They met at the one-room\n\n* 38\n\nwKITIHE\n\nMAINE\n\nYEARS®\n\nschool that they both attended, where King was a grade ahead of Chesley. Chesley was immediately interested in this intelligent 12-year-old who, as Chesley says, “already\n\nhad a way with words.” King showed Chesley some of the stories he had written, and Chesley was greatly impressed. The writing was better than any published work he had ever seen by a contemporary author. This illustration appears on the book jacket of a collection of H. P. Lovecraft’s stories,\n\nentitled The Horror in the Museum, and depicts a creepy skeleton crawling out of a chasm. In their aunt's attic, Stephen and his brother,\n\nDavid, found a box left by their father that was full of books,\n\nincluding some by H. P. Lovecraft, a popular horror writer of the 1920s and ’30s. King once described Lovecraft, who was a powertul influence on King, as “the best writer\n\nof horror fiction that America has yet produced.”\n\n39\n\nK STEPHEN\n\nKING&\n\nThe two began writing stories together. Sometimes they would take turns writing paragraphs, while at other times they would each write their own stories and then give them to each other to critique. They also read aloud to each other from their favorite books, such as Richard\n\nMatheson’s Am Legeridand Don Robertson’s The River and the Wilderness. Meanwhile, David had acquired an old Underwood typewriter and a mimeograph machine that had to be cranked by hand. He began publishing a local newspaper called Dave’s Rag, with astaff consisting of him, his cousin\n\nDonald Flaws, and his younger brother, Stephen. David was editor-in-chief, Donald was the sports editor, and Stephen was a general reporter. The boys included everything that they thought would be of interest in the town of Durham, from church news to people’s birthdays to local renovations. In imitation of Mad magazine, the top right corner of Dave’s Ragannounced the price: “5 cents—cheap!” They later increased the price to 20 cents. If readers wanted a copy of a photograph taken by David that appeared in the newspaper, they could buy it for 35 cents. And if local businesses wanted to advertise their wares, it would cost\n\nthem two cents per line fora classified ad. Stephen King’s contributions to Dave's Ragvaried. In one column he gave readers a preview of the new shows that would be coming on television. He went to movies and provided reviews and synopses of their plots. He also published his first short stories in the paper, copies of which readers could also buy directly from him. King’s grandmother, Nellie Fogg Pillsbury, died at the age of 85, “blind and bedridden, but still able to decline Latin verbs and name all of the Presidents up to Truman.” Fourteen-year-old Stephen was the one to find her body after she died in her sleep. He did not know what to do. He had seen people in movies hold a mirror up to a dead\n\n40\n\nAKITHE\n\nMAINE\n\nYEARS*®\n\nperson’s mouth to make sure there was no breath, so this is what he did to verify that she was indeed dead. He would use this material in a short story, “Gramma,” printed first in the semiprofessional magazine Weirdbook, issue number 19, in spring 1984, and reprinted in Skele-\n\nton Crew, a 1985 collection of his short stories. Real evil also fascinated King. He kept a scrapbook documenting the murders committed in cold blood by Charles Starkweather in January 1958. Starkweather and his girlfriend, Caril Fugate, went on a killing spree through the states of Nebraska and Wyoming. “I loved the guy,” King said. “At the same time, he scared me.”\n\nKing claims that his mother was ready to have him placed in analysis. He used that material in the short story “The Revenge of Lard Ass Hogan,” which appeared in the Maine\n\nReview in 1975,\n\nand in another\n\nshort story,\n\n“Nona” in 1978. “The Revenge of Lard Ass Hogan” was revised and reprinted in the novella “The Body,” appearing as a story written by the character Gordon Lachance, which had purportedly been published in Cavalier, a magazine that printed King’s early stories. In 1986, “The\n\nBody” was made into the movie Stand By Me. Stephen graduated from grammar school at the top of his class, which consisted of just three students. There was no high school in Durham,\n\nso the eight eligible\n\nstudents were sent to Lisbon Falls, a nearby town. Because there was no bus, the town paid a service to drive the\n\nstudents to and from high school every day. If Stephen stayed late for an activity and missed the cars that left for home, he would hitchhike or walk the six miles back to Durham. A girl who commuted to high school with young Stephen was one of the people on whom, some years later,\n\nhe would model the character Carrie for the novel of the same name. Nobody wanted to be sguck sitting next to the pimply, nerdy girl in the crowded backseat of the car.\n\n4|\n\nK STEPHEN\n\nKING&\n\nReligion played a major part in the Kings’ lives.

Huff had “a profound impact” on both boys, according to David. When he passed away, Stephen delivered a eulogy for “Hufty. In 1962, at age 15, Stephen began submitting his short stories to science fiction magazines. He did not meet with\n\nnovella, “The Body.”\n\nmuch success. In fact, he had a huge pile of rejection slips\n\nMe. The film, directed by Rob Reiner, was based on\n\nwKITIHE\n\nMAINE\n\nYEARS*®\n\nthat he speared on a nail on his desk. He was proud of his collection of rejections; it showed he was trying, anyway, and paying his dues. Stephen did well in high school. In his free time, he played in a rock band and was on the football team. He also started an underground newspaper, the Village Vomit, a satirical version of the school paper, where he mocked teachers and administrators. He got in trouble for that, but the principal, seeing that he had potential, arranged for him to write about high school sports for the local newspaper. Another odd thing he did was write detailed stories about his high school and the people in it, but he put his acquaintances in extraordinary circumstances. For in-\n\nstance, in one story, the school was attacked by the Soviet army, and the students fought back. Friends who appeared as characters in his stories knew Stephen liked them if they were among the last to go or if they died gloriously. According to Chris Chesley, “Steve’s characters are based not only upon the horror genre tradition but also on actual people he has known.” Chesley has said that King was fashioned by his “working class, gritty little town. A lot of the narrative force in his writing stems directly from his sense of being outside the mainstream,\n\noutside the middle class ethos [values].”\n\nIn 1963, Chris and Stephen published an 18-page anthology of their short stories called People, Places, and Things using the typewriter and the mimeograph machine that Stephen’s brother had used to put together his newspaper a few years back. They sold it to friends and family. And in 1965, King had “I Was a Teenage Grave\n\nRobber” published in an actual magazine—Comics Review. He did not get paid for this short story, but at last he could point to a story he had written that was\n\nactually published.\n\n43\n\n—\n\n: CO_.\n\n—\n\n.

King told Mel Allen that his mother would “send us $5 nearly every week for spending money. After she died, I found she had frequently gone without meals to send that money we'd so casually accepted. It was very unsettling.” Fellow students remember King as a big, hulking figure with a wild beard and untamed hair who would never win the best-dressed award.

Gothic fiction, prevalent in the late 18th\n\ncentury and early 19th century, is a literary style that stresses grotesque, mysterious, and melancholic themes.\n\nKing produced “Jerusalem’s Lot,” later published in Night Shift, his 1978 collection of short stories, and an early draft of one of King’s favorite novels, Salem’s Lot. Though the professor had warned his students that his standards for fiction were very high, “Jerusalem’s Lot” earned King an A, which King said he did not deserve. “The story,” he said, “wasn’t so much Gothic as it was outrageous Lovecraft pastiche [imitation].” In “Jerusa-\n\nlem’s Lot,” set in 1850, Charles Boone travels back to a deserted Maine town where he discovers that his ancestors worshiped vampires, the undead. The last of his kind, he chooses to end his life to rid the world of their\n\ndreadful practices. King switched political allegiances when he got to college. In high school he was a conservative Republican who believed in the government and the status quo. He voted for Richard Nixon for president because he believed Nixon would end the war in Vietnam. Tabitha claims that he was absurdly naive, King reports in the introductory chapter of Nightmares & Dreamscapes. “My wife still delights in telling people that her husband cast his first Presidential ballot, at the tender age of twenty-\n\none for Richard Nixon. ‘Nixon said he hada plan to get us out of Vietnam,’ she says, usually with a gleeful gleam in her eye, ‘and Steve believed him?” But in college, as he watched America become increasingly involved in Vietnam, he became more and more\n\n» 46\n\nKSA\n\nMARKETABLE\n\nOBSESSION’®\n\nliberal and even radical. He rallied against the war and also involved himself in civil rights causes. In 1966, his freshman year, his short story “The Glass Floor” was accepted for publication by Startling Mystery Stories, a semiprofessional science fiction magazine. This\n\nwas the first story for which King actually received money. He also completed a dystopian (depressingly wretched and involving people who lead a fearful existence) novel, The Long Walk, which he submitted to a first-novel contest. Set in the future, the novel follows a\n\ngroup of teenagers on a long journey during which they are killed one by one. Crushed by the standard rejection letter, King packed the manuscript away without show-\n\ning it to any other publishers. 4]\n\nThis photograph, taken around 1963, shows the sprawling campus of the\n\nUniversity of Maine at Orono. When King attended college there, he was a\n\ncampus icon widely known for his column “King’s Garbage Truck’ in the university newspaper, the Maine Campus.\n\nK STEPHEN\n\nKING&®\n\nKing submitted the novel he completed in his sophomore year to a dozen publishers, and it was rejected by all of them. Interestingly, when he took classes in creative writing, they interfered with his productivity. King called the classes “a constipating experience” and “the worst thing I could have done to myself.” He told Douglas E. Winter, “it really muffled everything for awhile.” Strong positive influences were such realist and naturalist writers as Thomas Hardy, Jack London, and Theodore Dreiser, who carefully document every detail of scene and character. King says he wants his readers to know that they always walk into the middle of a story; that is, that everything and everyone has histories. When\n\nw“A\n\nMARKETABLE\n\nOBSESSION”&\n\nKing jumps into a story, he wants to tell readers what has already happened to everyone before the tale begins. A poetry seminar taught by Burton Hatlen focused on contemporary American mythology and taught King that he could bridge the gulf between academic and popular culture. Hatlen read and admired King’s work, as did Ted Holmes, who taught creative writing. But King had running battles with other professors “who sneered at the popular fiction I carried around all the time.” But popular authors taught King a lot about plotting and pace. According to King, his muse was definitely not\n\n“some cute little pudgy devil who floats around the head of the creative person sprinkling fairy dust.” King deOn May 4, 1970, at Kent State University, Ohio,\n\nNational Guardsmen shot tear gas and fired rifles into the masses demonstrating against the war in Southeast Asia, killing four students\n\nand wounding several more. In high school, King had been a conservative Republican, but in his college years, during the late 1960s, he became increasingly radical and fought for civil rights causes and rallied against the Vietnam War.\n\n49\n\nK STEPHEN\n\nKING&\n\nscribes his muse as “a guy with a flattop in coveralls who looks like Jack Webb [the actor who starred in the 1960s\n\ntelevision show “Dragnet”] and says, “All right, you son of a bitch, time to get to work.” A number of King’s short stories appeared in college literary magazines. One story, “It Grows On You,” which originally appeared in a University of Maine literary magazine, Marshroots, was revised and republished in the most recent collection of King’s short stories, Nightmares\n\ne Dreamscapes. The story is now “a final look back at the doomed little town of Castle Rock [the fictional town that is the setting of many of King’s novels].”\n\nThe Accident, a one-act play, won a drama award from the university, and a number of other stories that King wrote in college would resurface later. “Stud City,” first published in the fall 1969 issue of Ubris, a campus literary magazine, reappears in “The Body,” where it supposedly is the early work of the character Gordon Lachance, who criticizes it. He calls it “derivative and sophomoric,” all too clearly “THE PRODUCT OF AN UNDERGRADUATE CREATIVE WRITING WORKSHOP.”\n\nIn 1969, King began talking to various professors and administrators about an idea he had for a course on popular literature and culture. The world had changed so much in the sixties—since the forties, really—and now there was a huge amount of information, entertainment,\n\nand music that no one was studying. Administrators did not think it was a serious enough topic to warrant study in an academic institution. King was persistent, however,\n\nand eventually he ended up teaching the course. Officially, he was a teaching assistant, anda full professor was in charge. While in college, King met Tabitha Spruce, a history major from Old Town, Maine. The third of eight children, Tabitha had wanted to study archaeology and history at the University of New Mexico but could not\n\n» 50\n\nw NA\n\nMARKETABLE\n\nOBSESSION’& An artist’s sketch of Theodore Dreiser depicts the novelist in 1938. Dreiser, who is considered by most critics to be the pioneer of naturalism in American literature, wrote his most acclaimed novel, An American Tragedy, in 1925.

Like King, she landed at the university library, working part-time in the stacks. They began dating and were soon a couple. According to King, “Tabby looked like a waitress. She came across—and still does—as a tough broad.” Tabitha Spruce has French-Canadian forebears who,\n\nshe says, changed their name from Pinette, which means “Little Pine,” to Spruce, an American tree. They used the\n\nnew name to disguise their Roman Catholicism from the local Ku Klux Klan, a secret society that began terrorizing\n\nCatholics, among other religious and racial groups, in the late 19th century.\n\n5|\n\nKK STEPHEN\n\nKING&\n\nWearing a borrowed suit that was too big for him,\n\nKing married Tabitha in January 1971, soon after his graduation. Tabitha completed her degree in history a year later. His final column for “King’s Garbage Truck” in the Maine Campus was a‘ caricature birth announcement: Stephen King had been born into the “real” world. That summer he contributed weekly installments of a comic Western novel, S/ade, to the campus newspaper. Slade, a two-gun cigar smoker swathed in black who has lost his sweetheart, Miss Polly Peachtree of Paduka, triumphs\n\nover various villains and rides off into the sunset in search of new adventures. King himself would have a rather more difficult time of it. Artist Max Beerbohm’s caricature of Thomas Hardy shows the English novelist and poet composing a lyric. Hardy, whose work impressed King, was a realist in his portrayal of details and a naturalist in his philosophic outlook. His novels, such as The Mayor of Casterbridge and Tess of the D'Urbervilles, take place in fictional Wessex in southwestern England and involve simple country folk.\n\nwSA\n\nMARKETABLE\n\nOBSESSION”&\n\nWhen King graduated from college, the working world was not very receptive to a recent graduate with a degree in English. King worked a variety of jobs, including pumping gas for $1.25 per hour. Soon he was able to switch to a higher-paying job, such as pressing sheets at the New Franklin Laundry in Bangor for $1.60 an hour. In one of his early stories, “The Mangler,” an auto-\n\nmatic ironing and folding machine turns into a murderous satanic monster, stalking the countryside, searching\n\nfor victims. That industrial speed ironer is very much like the machines King operated when he worked at the laundry. Also, in Carrie the creepy mother works at a laundry. In other words, no experience of King’s is wasted—he may have hated that job, but he found something to use during those hours, and he turned it into a story, then used it in a book. The Kings moved into a rented trailer. In May 1971, after she graduated, Tabitha put on a hot-pink uniform and began working at Dunkin’ Donuts. Their daughter, Naomi, born within the first year of their marriage, was dressed mostly in scrounged clothes. And on June 4,\n\n1972, their second child, Joseph, was born. In 1971, King landed a teaching job at Hampden Academy, where he had been a student teacher during his\n\nsenior year of college. His salary of $6,400 per year was not much more than he had earned at the laundry. He went back to work at the laundry during the summer break. Times were really hard, but King managed to make\n\ngood use of his surroundings, no matter how uncongenial. For example, he began to wonder what the children of a co-worker at the laundry, an extremely religious older woman with “a strange aura,” were like.\n\nShe became the prototype for Carrie’s mother in that novel. Even though there was precious little room in their tiny trailer, the Kings took in Stephen’s childhood friend,\n\n53\n\nK STEPHEN\n\nKING®\n\nChris Chesley, as a boarder. King said, “Budget was not\n\nexactly the word for whatever it was we were on... .It was more like a modified version of the Bataan Death March [the infamous 65-mile death march of American\n\nand Filipino prisoners of war from Bataan, a peninsula in the Philippines, to: Japanese prison camps during World War II].” Through it all, King continued to write, working for two hours every night in the furnace room of their trailer,\n\nTabitha’s typewriter perched on a child’s rickety desk or on his lap. When he got excited the desk jiggled up and down. King would “go down there and fight vampires” at will. He had started writing a book, The Dark Tower, and his short stories occasionally brought in a little money—just in time, usually. He had a dartboard on which he could post rejection slips. “When I was really feeling down I used to throw darts at them and I would say, “There, that’s for you, Cosmopolitan. Take that, Alfred Hitchcock!” He points out that writers need thick skins. Noting a horror trend that began with Rosemary’s Baby (1967) and included The Exorcist (1970), King began\n\nwriting Carrie in the summer of 1972 but tossed the notes in the trash; Tabitha rescued the pages and told him to continue. He hated it, but he finished the book and sent it to a publisher anyway. His expectations were low; he had gotten many, many rejections. In the novel, Carrie, the plain daughter of a religious\n\nfanatic, is tormented by her high school classmates. Her experience of puberty is so harrowing that she develops paranormal powers and takes cataclysmic revenge upon her tormentors. Then the telegram arrived—Carrie was to be published! And King would receive a $2,500 advance. A month and a half later, on May 12, 1973, King got an\n\nastonishing phone call. His publisher, Doubleday, had\n\n54\n\nwk SA\n\nMARKETABLE\n\nOBSESSION’&\n\nDuring his junior year in college, King began dating fellow student Tabitha Jane Spruce, shown here in a later photograph. They had met while working in the university's library and were married January 2, 1971. Years later, King wrote, “The only important thing| ever did in my life for a conscious reason was to ask Tabitha Spruce. . . to marry me.”\n\n55\n\nK STEPHEN\n\nKING&\n\nsold the paperback rights for $400,000, of which Stephen King got half. The Kings’ lives could have changed immediately and dramatically. But they took things one step at a time. First, they moved\n\nto a modest apartment\n\nin Bangor,\n\nwhere King thought about whether or not to give up teaching. He was a popular teacher and liked his job, but Stephen King speaks to children at the Waterford Memorial School in Waterford, Maine, in 1990.\n\nKing was familiar with the classroom—in 1971 he began teaching at Hampden Academy, near Bangor,\n\nwhere the school’s principal later said “King was a promising teacher.” He resigned from this position in 1973 to dedicate his time to writing.\n\nhe finally decided to resign and dedicate himself to writ-\n\ning full time. The family then moved to Windham, near Sebago Lake, where King could fish and spend the sum-\n\nmer writing his next book, with occasional forays into New York to see his publisher and take in a baseball game. King is an avid fan of the Boston Red Sox. The book, initially titled “Second\n\nComing,”\n\nthen\n\n“Jerusalem’s Lot,” would eventually appear as Salem’s Lot in 1975 and would be nominated for Best Novel in the World Fantasy Awards the next year. From then on he would write every day, 362 days per year. King takes vacation days on his birthday, Christ-\n\n56\n\nKSA\n\nMARKETABLE\n\nOBSESSION’&\n\nmas, and the Fourth of July. “I have a marketable obsession,” he tells his readers in the foreword to Night Shift, a 1978 collection of his short stories. He attributes his success at least in part to his mother’s partaking of America’s national habit: worrying. “I was brought up by a mom who worried all the time. She’d say, ‘Put on your rubbers, Stevie, you'll get a cold. You’re gonna get pneumonia and die.’ You couldn’t go swimming in public pools because of polio and stuff like that.” Worry, King says, is\n\n“a luxury we can afford,” because we are a rich nation, “the best educated nation on earth. We have everything.” King’s\n\nhardworking,\n\nbeloved\n\nmother\n\nlived\n\nlong\n\nenough to hear the good news of the publication of Carrie, but not long enough to hold the book in her hand. On December 18, 1973, Ruth died at age 59, after\n\na long and painful battle with cancer. One of King’s greatest regrets is that his mother, who encouraged him so much to write throughout his childhood, did not live\n\nto see Carrie actually in print. He told radio announcer Mel Allen, “she was old-fashioned about Carrie. She didn’t like the sex parts. But she recognized that a lot of Carrie had to do with bullying. If there’s a moral in the book it is “Don’t mess around with people. You never know whom you may be tangling with.” King added, “Ah, if my mother had lived, she’d have been the Queen of Durham by now.”\n\n5]\n\nActor Max von Sydow (right) presents author and producer William Blatty (left) and actress Linda Blair (center) with Golden Globe awards for their work on the 1973 movie The Exorcist. Upon realizing that horror novels, like Blatty’s The Exorcist, were getting much attention during this time, King decided to write one himself.\n\ne\n\n“ \\\n\nSS\n\nee\n\nI: 1974, ANXIOUS TO TRY NEW SETTINGS, King moved his family to Boulder, Colorado, where he thought he could seclude himself and write.\n\nWhile living there he heard of an old resort and decided to go there for a short visit. He and his family stayed at the Stanley Hotel, where according to fable, Johnny Ringo, a local legendary bad man, had been shot. King had to pay the bill in cash because the hotel had closed for the season. “We were the only guests,” King said, “and we could hear the wind screaming outside.” When\n\nthey went down to supper, they walked “through these big bat-wing doors into a huge dining room.” Plastic sheets covered the tables, and chairs were\n\nstacked up on them. A band dressed in tuxedos played, but the place was empty. On the way back to his room, King got lost in the warren of dark corridors. When he found his room, he went into the bathroom and looked In 1974, King and his family temporarily moved to Boulder, Colorado, where King wrote The Shining. He believed Colorado was an ideal locale for a horror novel, because, he said, it is “a spooky state\n\nwith mountains and high passes and the wind howling and the wolves.”\n\n59\n\nKKSTEPHEN\n\nKING&\n\nat the claw-foot tub and thought, “What if somebody died here? At that moment, I knew I had a book.” That visit to the Stanley Hotel in Estes Park, which\n\nbegan the day before Halloween, would provide the plot and setting for The Shining (1977), originally titled “The Shine,” from a song by John Lennon and the Plastic Ono\n\nBand called “Instant Karma”: “We all shine moon and the stars and the sun.” In just over a month, King wrote the major Shining in a rented room because there was work at the house in which the Kings lived\n\non, like the\n\npart of The no space to in Boulder.\n\nHe paid $17.50 per week to a landlady he had seen once,\n\nleaving the check on the counter. All he knew when he started writing his novel was that it would be five acts,\n\n“in the form of a Shakespearean tragedy.” He said that he “just never hit a snag in the whole writing of the book.” While in Boulder, he also began working on The House on Value Street, a novel loosely based on the true story of newspaper heiress Patty Hearst’s February 1974 kidnapping by the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA), her brainwashing, and her apparent participation in a bank robbery. Though the real-life drama seemed to have all the elements for great nonfiction, King felt that fiction might better be able to explain all of the contradictions. The themes and material would eventually resurface in The Stand, arguably his most popular work, but no matter how hard King tried, he could not make Value Street work. He dropped the book. Like the doomed Jack Torrance\n\nof The Shining,\n\nwho can only type over and over again, “All work and no play makes Jack a dull, boy,” King has had serious bouts of writer’s block, which he calls “a mental constipation.” In a radio interview recorded in 1992, he said, “When I can’t work, I tell myself it will pass. I am\n\ncompulsive. If I don’t write, a voice inside agitates for the work. If you don’t use it, you'll lose it. ’ve had\n\n» 60\n\nwKKING\n\nOF\n\nHORROR\n\nperiods when I’ve written nothing but crap for as long as a year. ss King is usually amazingly prolific, producing one or\n\ntwo best-sellers a year, as well as movie and television scripts and solid advice for novice writers. He rewrites his books three or four times, though “most of what you want should be there” the first time around. He tells stories about real, not cardboard, characters, people his audience cares about. In the second draft, he goes back\n\nand fixes whatever is wrong. “The second draft is especially critical,” he told critic Tony Magistrale in a 1989 interview, because often “a\n\nwriter is unaware of what he’s really writing until after he is done. It’s like drawing pictures in a dark room, and\n\nthen a sudden illumination shows you what you’ve been drawing. Before you write it down, the story exists, but it takes the actual writing to recognize it.” He often finds that the second half of a book teaches him what the book is really about, and he must revise the earlier sections so\n\nthat they lead more naturally to the end. “On the third draft I concentrate on language and make the sentences feel balanced. Good writing should be accessible.” King gets fan mail from kids who do not usually read at all, let alone write letters. “Labored, almost scrawled things in pencil, they say, I don’t read much, but I love what you do,” King told interviewer David Stevens. An inveterate reader who believes a day without a book is a total waste, King is pleased that these readers gain confidence and sharpen their skills by reading his stories. The story grabs them, and despite the difficulty, they read on to find out what happens next. With their newfound assurance, “they go on from there.” Within a year of moving to Colorado, King returned to Maine—where he has always felt most at home—and bought a house in Bridgton. His second novel, a particular favorite of his, ‘Salem’s Lot, was published in 1975,\n\n6|\n\nKSTEPHEN\n\nKING&\n\n2|\n\n2 < We\n\n\\S\n\n~\n\nIn 1975, King published his second novel, ‘Salem's Lot, which is a modern-day vampire story set in a New England town. With the publication of this novel, King’s editor, Bill Thompson, was worried that King would be typecast as a horror writer.\n\nKKING\n\nOF\n\nHORROR*®\n\nhitting the best-seller list and proving that Carrie was not a fluke. A vampire story set in Jerusalem’s Lot, a small New England town, the novel reverses the traditional American hate affair with cities. This time, the small town, usually a place of peace and quiet, is the site of malevolence. Readers of ‘Salem’s Lotsometimes believe that King himself hates small towns, but in a 1979 interview he told Mel Allen that though the novel shows the defects, the negative side of middle-class America,\n\nue\n\nof it is a\n\nlove song to growing up in a small town.’ King acknowledges the influence of his beloved horror movies on this novel, especially the paranoia that informs\n\nInvasion of the Body Snatchers. The movie responded to the witch-hunts of Senator Joseph McCarthy, who was chairman of the special Senate investigating committee that insisted that communism had infested the country,\n\nsmearing numerous citizens by innuendo. The paranoia of Salem’s Lot, King says, is a parallel response to the Watergate scandal, the Republican break-in at the Democratic campaign headquarters that led to the eventual resignation of President Richard Nixon. He also found the ending of Jnvasion quite romantic: the last two uncontaminated humans, the lovers, are wrapped in one another’s arms as the podpeople, who once were their neighbors, close in on them.\n\nKing has also discussed the influence of Bram Stoker’s bloody vampire saga, Dracula (1897), on his own novel. He has taken out the sexual element (because he believes\n\nsexual perversion is omnipresent in this country), but King’s undead sport all the insignia of the traditional vampire saga: they lust for blood, shun the sun, eschew garlic, and fly away at the sign of the cross. But King does not have Bram Stoker’s faith in science and rationality. He is all too aware of holes in the ozone layer, nerve gas, and the neutron bomb, all products of a\n\n63\n\nKSTEPHEN\n\nKING&\n\nscience that is far too careless, and so, in his novel, King\n\nmakes superstition triumph. Asked how he got the idea in the first place, King said Bela Lugosi (right) as Count Dracula and Helen Chandler as Mina Seward in the 1931 horror movie Dracula,\n\nbased on Bram Stoker's classic 1897 novel. King credits Stoker's book as the inspiration for ‘Salem’s Lot. While teaching the novel at Hampden Academy, King pondered, “What would happen if Dracula came back today?”\n\nin a 1983 lecture at a Massachusetts library, “Skeletons\n\nin the Closet: An Evening at the Billerica Library,” that he had been teaching Dracula in high school and liking it better every semester. Finally, he asked “the magic question. What would happen if Dracula came back today?” His wife, Tabitha, suggested, “Well, he’d land at Port Authority in New York and get run over by a taxicab and that'd be the end of him.” But Chris Chesley came up with a different scenario.\n\n“But suppose he came back to a little town somewhere\n\nHKKING\n\nOF\n\nHORROR*\n\ninland in Maine. You know, you go through some of those little towns and everybody could be dead and you'd never know.” Chesley does not even remember the conversation, but it haunted King until he recycled it into Salem’s Lot. This habit of using people, places, and stories from his life in his fiction is pervasive. In fact, Eric Norden began his 1983 Playboy interview with King with a question that underlines that interaction: The protagonist of Salem’s Lot, a struggling young author with a resemblance to his creator, confesses at one point “Sometimes when I’m lying in bed at night, I make up a Playboy Interview about me.” [Now that it’s happening] How does it feel?\n\n“It feels great. I love it!” King answered. In that interview, King places himself in the long and honorable tradition of storytelling that begins with the ancient Greek bards and medieval minnesingers. He sees himself as “the modern equivalent of the old Welsh sin eater, the\n\nwandering bard who would be called . .. when somebody was on his deathbed. The family would feed him, because while he was eating, he was also consuming all the sins of the dying person . . . [whose] soul would fly to heaven untarnished, washed clean.” Sin eaters died fat, with\n\neveryone believing they would drop straight down to hell. King sees himself and other horror writers as taking upon themselves the task of defusing the “fears and anxieties and insecurities” of their time. He says, “We’re sitting in the darkness beyond the flickering warmth of\n\nyour fire, cackling into our cauldrons and spinning out our spider webs of words, all the time sucking the sickness from your minds and spewing it out into the night.” King wrote in Danse Macabre, “I recognize horror as the finest emotion, and so I will try to terrorize the reader. But if I find I cannot terrify him/her, I will try to\n\n65\n\nKSTEPHEN\n\nKING&\n\nhorrify; and if I find that I cannot horrify, Pll go for the\n\ngross-out.” Landscape and places clearly structure King’s works. The influence of Nathaniel Hawthorne’s primitive forests, claustrophobic villages, and haunted houses, like the Pyncheon mansion in The House of the Seven Gables (1851), has often been remarked on. In Danse Macabre,\n\nKing talks of paying homage to Hawthorne. Certainly Hawthorne’s Goodman Brown of the short story “Young Goodman Brown” and Arthur Dimmesdale of The Scarlet Letter made the kind of journeys that King’s characters make a century later. For Hawthorne, however, the individual must establish communion, whereas for King the individual must reject the dominant community’s values in order to survive. In 1976, Brian DePalma directed the film version of\n\nCarrie, still considered by most critics to be one of the best movie adaptations of a King book. The story is sad, the viewer feels for this strange girl, and the audience\n\ncomes to understand why she unleashes her horrible anger. The book and the movie both capture the universal lonely, left-out feeling that afflicts so many high school students. Actress Sissy Spacek, who played Carrie, regarded the character as “a secret poet” and “thought about the terrible feeling of having to suppress one’s true nature” as she developed the character. Film critic Donald Peary said, “Spacek is painfully convincing.” She “puts us firmly on her side—we identify with her depression, her happiness when invited to the prom, and her need for revenge\n\nwhen the one happy night of her life is ruined by her mother and schoolmate.” Also in 1976, King wrote a guest article for the New York Times Book Review. He talked about how a writer like David Madden, whose work he deems excellent,\n\ncan spend six years writing the admirable novel Bijou and\n\n' 66\n\nHKKING\n\nOF\n\nHORROR*® An artist captures the grandiose Pyncheon mansion and its huge elm tree in this illustration from Nathaniel Hawthorne’s 1851 novel The House of the Seven Gables. King acknowledges Hawthorne’s\n\nimpact on his work; both authors set their stories in New England, writing about a particular kind of people, customs, and traditions that are authentic to the area. King said, “If you’re going to live in a place all your life, and if you want to write seriously, you almost have to write about that place.”\n\nearn only $15,000 from his work. At the time, King expected to make half a million dollars for eight months’ work. Yet he could not feel guilty, because he knew he was writing as honestly as he could. Nonetheless, King had a difficult and depressing year. He started several novels that did not work out. He shifted from one draft to another, finally focusing on\n\nFirestarter. The book would not be published until 1980. In 1977, King moved his family to England with intentions of staying for a year. There he met horror\n\n67\n\nKSTEP HEN\n\nKiNG\n\nwriter Peter Straub, with whom, years later, he would coauthor The Talisman. After just three months, the\n\nKings returned to Maine to buy a summer home in Center Lovell.\n\nIn the same year, King published The Shining, his first hardcover best-seller. This is another solid human drama;\n\nCarrie White, portrayed by actress Sissy Spacek in the 1976 film version of Carrie, stands in fury, drenched with pigs’ blood, just before she uses her telekinetic powers to cause explosions and fires in the town of Chamberlain, Maine. The movie, directed by Brian DePalma, is considered by most critics to be one of the best adaptations of a King book.\n\nWKKING\n\nOF\n\nHORROR®\n\nit is really about a family’s unraveling. Initially, King liked the scene where the woman gets out of the bathtub and pursues the child, Danny. But he scared himself while doing the rewrite; in many of his televised interviews, he describes the feeling of “oh no, it’s the lady in\n\nthe tub, thirty more pages and I have to face the lady in the tub!” The Overlook Hotel, like Marsten House of Salem’s\n\nLot, is a typical haunted house, straight out of traditional Gothic fiction. King pays homage in The Shining to Edgar Allan Poe’s “Masque of the Red Death.” In that terrifying tale, the opulently dressed revelers who have taken refuge in a castle confront death, the plague, which is personified by a figure wearing a black disguise. An even stronger influence on King’s novel is Poe’s “Fall of the House of Usher.” In King’s hotel, special rooms, most notably the Colorado Lounge and room 217, act as\n\ngateways to alternate worlds and function the way Poe’s crypts and chambers do. Back in Maine, King became politically active again,\n\nthis time campaigning in a fight against censorship in his home state. Disgusted by the idea of banning books, he has remained involved in this struggle. Though his books are often banned, that is not why he supports the First\n\nAmendment (freedom of speech and of the press). He sees censorship as “repulsive to the whole idea of education.” He remains dedicated to the right of authors to write and readers to read what they wish. In 1986, he was the Friends of the Library featured speaker for Banned Books Week in Virginia Beach, Virginia. King began to feel trapped by his fame and his reputation as a horror writer. His publisher, Doubleday,\n\nfearful that his public would tire of King if too many of his books came out at the same time, would publish just one King blockbuster each year. Because he often writes two novels per year, as well as short stories, the backlog\n\n69\n\nK STEPHEN\n\nKING&\n\nwas considerable. He worried that his early work might easily grow stale. He went to his editor, Elaine Koster, at New American Library, his paperback publisher, and asked if she would be willing to publish Getting It On under a pseudonym. He chose Guy Pillsbury, his maternal grandfather’s name. When people at New American Library connected Pillsbury with King, King rebaptized himself and his novel. In 1977, the same year that The Shining came out, New American Library published Rage, the revision of Getting It On, using the pseudonym Richard Bachman for the first time. Begun in 1965 when King was 17, Rage took seven\n\nyears to complete. Charlie Decker, a high school student who shoots his algebra teacher and takes over the class, narrates the story. King does here what he will do again and again, culminating in The Stand: he isolates a group of people and subjects them to stress. Social structure breaks down, revealing darker, more primitive patterns.\n\nThe first half of the book went virtually unrevised. Before Carrie was accepted, King had submitted Rage to Bill Thompson, an editor at Doubleday and an important influence on King. Doubleday came close to publishing it but decided against it. Possibly, King would never have evolved into the master of the horror story had he succeeded in “straight fiction.” Rage was very different from his other novels. King says, “All the Bachman books are sad books. They all\n\nhave downbeat endings. I don’t think the ending of a novel is particularly important, thoughalot of people do. I’m more interested in how, people react along the way. As far as ’'m concerned, we’re all going to come to an unhappy ending.” The Bachman novels fall easily into the naturalist tradition. The way the naturalists look at the world seems accurate to King. He told one interviewer, “I’m not very\n\n10\n\nHKKING\n\nOF\n\nHORROR*® Free-spirited King rides his motorcycle through Maine. His reputation as a renegade writer still exists today—in 1994, King rode his new\n\nHarley Davidson to 10 cities across the country to promote his novel /nsomnia.\n\noptimistic about the world.” He is like “all those people of the naturalistic school [who] believed once you pull out one rock, it’s sort of a relentless slide into the pit.” Though the condition of society looks insecure and disturbing, King says, “I try to do as well by my family as I can. I try to raise my kids to be good people. You know,\n\nthe good guys. But I don’t think the future looks bright.” Richard Bachman’s Rage sold moderately well but was not as conspicuous abest-seller as the Stephen King books were. Still, he was relieved to have another outlet. The pressure of being King, the master of horror, was arduous. Though his fans would vehemently disagree, King has said, “I’m not a great artist but I’ve always felt impelled to write.”\n\nOver the coming years, he would publish four more novels under the pseudonym Richard Bachman. New American Library treated Bachman well. Koster kept his identity a secret from some of her own senior executives,\n\ndespite the enormous pressures to tell the world that Bachman was really King. Grateful to New American Library for the way they treated “my friend Bachman,” King decided to work exclusively with that publisher.\n\nTI\n\n& _\n\nI 1978, KING BRIEFLY RETURNED TO TEACHING as a writer-in-residence\n\nat his alma mater, the University of Maine at Orono. The King family rented a house that fronted a busy road in Orrington, near Bangor. The neighborhood children had constructed alittle graveyard in the woods for the many animals killed by trucks on the highway. Among the victims was King’s daughter Naomi’s cat, Smucky. Tabitha convinced her husband that they had to tell Naomi about the fate of her pet, and upon hearing the bad news, Naomi cried and cried.\n\nThree days after Smucky’s funeral, the idea for the novel Pet Sematary came to King. His younger son, Owen, had been running toward the road when King caught hold of him. What if not only the cat but also the two-year-old son were killed? That night King dreamed of “a corpse walking up and down outside the house,” he told writer and critic Douglas E. Winter. King thought about funeral customs, a subject that he had preferred to avoid until now. He knew that he would write a novel that would consciously retell that most depressing of short stories, W. W. Jacobs’s “The Monkey’s Paw” (1902). In King imitates the mounted head ofa rattlesnake he is holding. Nearly all of his novels have become best-sellers, making King one of the most successful authors in the world.\n\n73\n\nK STEPHEN\n\nKING&\n\nthat tale, grieving parents are granted their most fervent wish: to have their son come back from the dead. Their\n\nson returns to them, but he is merely a powdery corpse. Stephen King published Pet Sematary in 1983. He had completed the first draft in 1979, but because the book dealt with the realistic death of a child, King believed it was too horrible to read and\n\nhesitated having it published. However, to fulfill a contract\n\nwith Doubleday, he agreed to publish the book.\n\nThe moral: do not wish for what you cannot have.\n\nKing found writing Pet Sematary “a gloomy exercise, like an endless marathon run.” Images from the book— the dead child, the funeral home, and the mortician’s\n\nroom—were always with him, even when he was trying\n\nto teach. One of his own worst fears has always been that something would happen to one of his children. His early fears for his youngest child irrationally resurfaced, as the boy once had been misdiagnosed as a hydrocephalic, one\n\nwho has a congenital condition in which water accumulates around the brain, enlarging the skull and squeezing the brain. Whenever an innocent child dies in one of his works, as Tad Trenton does in Cujo, King suffers.\n\nIn Pet Sematary, not only did he write about the death of a child, one subject that he never wanted to address, but he had to deal with the aftermath: “the funeral parlors, the burial, the grief, and . . . the\n\nguilt—the feeling that you are somehow at fault. . . . It was like looking through a window into something that could be.”\n\nTabitha King cried when she read the story. The novel was so painful that King stuck the first draft into a drawer, and when a television interviewer asked whether King had ever written\n\nanything\n\ntoo\n\nhorrible\n\nto\n\nbe\n\nprinted, he referred to the buried\n\n14\n\nwK “SPIDER manuscript,\n\nWEBS\n\nOF\n\nWORDS”\n\nstirring up ru-\n\nmors among his millions of fans of a book more horrifying than any they had already experienced. The fact that Pet Sematary did appear at all might be the happy result of an unfortunate contract dispute with Doubleday. To get a substantial amount of money that was due him, King had to offer them a novel. He rewrote the first draft in 1982, and one year later when the book was published, for the publicity campaign, he gave Doubleday permission to use the previous rumors that had been stirred up. But King himself took no part in promoting the book, nor would\n\nhe talk about it until his January 15, 1984, interview with Douglas E. Winter. King said, [The book] never left my mind, it never ceased to trouble\n\nme. I was trying to teach school, and the boy was always there, the mortician’s room was always there. .. . So it hurts me to talk about it, it hurts me to think about it. Pet Sematary is the one book I haven’t reread—I never want to go there again, because it is a real cemetary.\n\nIn the writing workshops King ran that year at the university, he taught his students the way he thought writers needed to be treated. For example, he made sure his writing workshops had a friendly atmosphere, and he\n\ntook the young writers seriously. But, King told Paul Janeczko in a February 1980 interview published in English Journal, which is intended for English teachers, creativity cannot be taught. Teachers are useful, however,\n\nonce writers have developed to a certain point. These\n\n15\n\nA set from the 1989 movie Pet Sematary, which\n\nwas based on King’s novel, shows the cemetery for pets. The idea for the book came from a real pet graveyard in Orrington, Maine, that the neighborhood children created. The “Pets Sematary” (a child’s misspelling) had become the resting place for King’s daughter's cat, Smucky.\n\nK STEPHEN\n\nKING&\n\ntalented novices can be taught to write better. They can learn to experiment with point of view, to pace the work, to spot their themes, and to rewrite to integrate beginnings into the endings. He found that teaching creative writing had been easier in high school,' where students had selected the course just to have fun. King felt he could say, “Rip this\n\nout and put it here.’ And they did it. They took a lot more chances.” In college, where egos are “mortally involved,” he\n\nbecame timid, fearful of destroying students’ confidence. “Unfortunately, with a lot of poetry students you're laboring under a lot of terrible burdens like [poet] Rod McKuen and [“Star Trek” actor] Leonard Nimoy and\n\nHallmark greeting cards. You’ve got to work against\n\nthat.” Young poets are far too easily influenced by phony sentimentality and pseudoscientific solutions. He assigned a few novels, including James Cain’s\n\nDouble Indemnity and David Morrell’s First Blood. He\n\nsays, “Ifa writer isn’t reading, he’s in big trouble anyway.” From what they read, writers learn what to do and what not to do. Students need to get to the point when they\n\ncan say, “I do better stuff than that.” But King is quick to point out that writers need to be talented in the first place for all the hard work to pay off. He uses himself as an example. He has played guitar since he was 16 years old but says, “I’ve not progressed much beyond where I was at sixteen, playing “Louie, Louie’ and ‘Little Deuce Coupe’ on rhythm guitar with a group called the MoonSpinners.” He still plays now and then, especially to cheer himself up when he gets the blues. But he says, “I think Eric Clapton is still safe.” The talented writers have to work to refine that talent.\n\n“Refining talent,” King says, “is merely a matter of exercise. If you work out with weights for fifteen minutes a day over a course of ten years, you're gonna get muscles.\n\n16\n\n~A SPIDER\n\nWEBS\n\nOF\n\nWORDS”®\n\nIf you write for an hour and a half a day for ten years,\n\nyou re gonna turn into a good writer.” While King was a writer-in-residence at the University of Maine, he developed and began to write Danse Macabre, which was published in 1981. It is an analysis of the horror genre in literature, film, and television. The idea for the book came from his friend and first editor, Bill Thompson, and grew out of the course that he was teaching. He included notes about his own evolution and that of the radio shows, the movies, the comic books, and the sociopolitical conditions that surface in his work, and he discusses what the horror genre does.\n\nThe horror story lets readers prove that they are not afraid of the monstrous and that, however unpleasant,\n\n7]\n\nIn 1981, King autographs Danse Macabre, his nonfiction analysis of the horror genre. His wife, Tabitha, was\n\nalso on hand to sign copies of her first novel, Small World, at a Bangor, Maine, bookstore.\n\nK STEPHEN\n\nKING®\n\nthe real world is better than what is on the page or the screen. It confirms the status quo. In Danse Macabre, which King calls his “dance with death,” he asserts that horror “appeals to the conservative Republican in a threepiece suit who resides within all of us; its main purpose\n\nis to reaffirm the virtues of the norm by showing us what awful things happen to people who venture into taboo lands.” He finds “a strong moral code” in most horror tales. Apologizing for the academic metaphor, he suggests “that the horror tale details the outbreak of some Dionysian [frenzied] madness in an Apollonian [rational] existence, and that horror will continue until the Dionysian forces have been repelled and the Apollonian norm restored again.”\n\nHe says, “We fear the Ghost for much the same reason as we fear the Werewolf: it is the deep part of us that need\n\nnot be bound by piffling Apollonian restrictions. It can walk through walls, disappear"
