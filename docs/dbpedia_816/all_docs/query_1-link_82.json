        "text": "alma cooper miss michigan : Garcelle Beauvais of Real Housewives of Beverly Hills and E! The two-hour Miss USA 2024 pageant, hosted by news presenter Keltie Knight, aired live from the Peacock Theatre in Los Angeles, with 51 women – one from each state and the District of Columbia – competing for the coveted title of Miss USA. And when the ballots were counted, the 73rd Miss USA crown was placed on the head of 22-year-old Miss Michigan Alma Cooper.\n\nAfter a pageant that included interviews, evening gowns, swimwear and more, Cooper was crowned by current Miss USA 2023 Savannah Gankiewicz of Hawaii, who inherited the title after Noelia Voigt of Utah stepped down in May citing mental health reasons.\n\n“As the daughter of a migrant worker, a proud Afro Latina woman, and an officer in the United States Army, I am living the American dream,” Cooper said during the Q & A session of the competition.”” If my life and my mother have taught me anything, it is that your circumstances never define your destiny: You can make success accessible by demanding excellence.”\n\nCooper, a U.S. Army officer who holds a master’s degree in data science from Stanford University, will represent the United States at the 2024 Miss Universe pageant, which will be held in Mexico in November.\n\nThe final five included:\n\n1st Runner-Up: Miss Kentucky Conner Perry\n\nSecond Runner-Up: Miss Oklahoma Danica Christopherson\n\nThird runner-up: Miss Tennessee Crystal Foote\n\n4th Runner-up: Miss Ohio Maisie Hudson\n\nThis year’s judges included Shayna Shay, star of Bravo’s Vanderpump Rules; Anastasia Sorey, CEO of Anastasia Beverly Hills; Gavin DeGraw, singer of the One Tree Hill theme song; shoe designer Jojo Bragis; Carol Gist, winner of Miss USA 1990; and Lou Parker, winner of Miss USA 1994.\n\nA new rule this year allowed women 28 years of age or older to participate, meaning this year’s Miss Arizona K. Johnson is the oldest woman ever to compete for the title at age 41. Earlier the age restriction was less than 18 to 28 years.\n\nThe beauty pageant was held at the Peacock Theatre in Los Angeles and aired on The CW for the second year.\n\nMiss USA contestants by state\n\nAlabama: Diane Westhoven, 21\n\nAlaska: Brenna Schaake, 29\n\nArizona: K Johnson, 41\n\nArkansas: Madeline Bohlman, 22\n\nCalifornia: Samantha Ramos, 24\n\nColorado: Jessi Kalambayi, 26\n\nConnecticut: Shavana Clarke, 29\n\nDelaware Alysa Bainbridge, 25 (Previously Miss Pennsylvania 2022)\n\nDistrict of Columbia: Kleo Torres, 26\n\nFlorida: Peyton Lewis, 26\n\nGeorgia: Emmaline Farmer, 24\n\nHawaii: Breea Yamat, 27\n\nIdaho: Kaitlyn Widmyer, 28\n\nIllinois: Grace Rodi, 23\n\nIndiana: Stephanie Sullivan, 33\n\nIowa: McKenzie Ariana Kerry, 26\n\nKansas: Bella Whitlock, 19\n\nKentucky: Connor Perry, 23\n\nLouisiana: Sydney Taylor, 23\n\nMaine: Anne Baldridge, 25\n\nMaryland: Bailey Anne Kennedy, 31\n\nMassachusetts: Melissa Sapini, 21\n\nMichigan: Alma Cooper, 22\n\nMinnesota: Muna Ali, 27\n\nMississippi: Kaylee Brooke McCollum, 23\n\nMissouri: Ashleigh Bedwell, 25\n\nMontana: Shelby Dangerfield, 30\n\nNebraska: Kamryn Buchanan, 24\n\nNevada: Najah Ali, 23\n\nNew Hampshire: Ariel Sullivan, 28\n\nNew Jersey: Jabili Kandula, 24\n\nNew Mexico: Mackenzie Sydow, 22\n\nNew York: Marizza Delgado, 25\n\nNorth Carolina: McKenzie Hansley, 24\n\nNorth Dakota: Codi Miller, 31\n\nOhio: Macy Hudson, 24\n\nOklahoma: Danika Christopherson, 22\n\nOregon: Shayla Montgomery, 21\n\nPennsylvania: Noni Diarra, 23\n\nRhode Island: Kaitlynne Santana, 22\n\nSouth Carolina: Gracen Grainger, 22\n\nSouth Dakota: Ahmitara Alwal, 25\n\nTennessee: Christell Foote, 24\n\nTexas: Aarieanna Ware, 26\n\nUtah: Alyssa Chandler, 21\n\nVermont: Samantha Vocatura, 27\n\nVirginia: Himanvi Panidepu, 23\n\nWashington: Tiffany Rea, 27\n\nWest Virginia: Caylie Simmons, 24\n\nWisconsin: Tori Trittin, 22\n\nWyoming: Mackenzie Rush, 19\n\nThe 73nd Miss USA Pageant airs live Sunday, August 4 at 8 p.m. ET/PT on The CW."
