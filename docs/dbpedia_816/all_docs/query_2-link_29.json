Her 1953 recording of Santa Baby and her recurring role as Catwoman on TV's Batman are familiar examples of her work. While many of her roles epitomized the Hollywood stereotype of \"sex kitten,\" her social consciousness often made it difficult for her to land jobs. Her refusal to perform for segregated audiences effectively relegated her to European venues in the 1940s and 50s. In the 1970s, she was blacklisted by the American entertainment industry when she spoke out against Vietnam at a White House luncheon. But Eartha Kitt's career came back, time and time again.

She became the first Executive Director of United Communities for Child Development, which worked to promote community-controlled childcare centers.

Rockefeller, III, Public Service Award as well as the Marian Wright Edelman Award for Service to Children.\n\nDarla Moore - In 1997, when Fortune magazine made her the first woman ever featured on a cover, they called her the \"Toughest Babe in Business.\" A native of Lake City and a graduate of the University of South Carolina, Mrs. Moore focuses a great deal of her considerable acumen on increasing South Carolina's economic vitality.

Rebecca's husband had recently died, and she and her children were relegated to an outbuilding. Legend has it that when General Francis Marion decided he needed to burn down the house in order to roust the Tories, Rebecca not only consented, she handed him a burning arrow to shoot at her own roof! Luckily, the British surrendered before the flames spread too far.

Today, her property is known as the Fort Motte Battle Site.\n\nO\n\nMary C. Simms Oliphant - This historian literally \"wrote the book\" on the history of South Carolina! Just prior to marriage, Miss Simms undertook the task of updating History of South Carolina, first written by her grandfather, William Gilmore Simms, in 1840. Her revised text was adopted by the South Carolina Board of Education in 1917 and employeed by schools throughout the state until 1932. That year, she printed her own, completely new textbook entitled The Simms History. This guide was used by SC students for over 50 years, until 1985.

She is remembered for her non-stereotypical depictions of black people, whom she treated with a wholeness and humanity unknown to white writers of the time. This honest outlook earned her the disdain and rebuke of her social class, which ostracized her from its ranks.\n\n– Langs Syne - Julia Peterkin's plantation\n\nEliza Lucas Pinckney - As a planter, she was responsible for the success of indigo as a cash crop in Colonial South Carolina. As a businesswoman, she was savvy enough to realize the growing textile industry was a ripe market for new dyes. Working on her farm near Charleston, she methodically experimented and developed improved strains of indigo. In 1745, only 5,000 pounds of indigo were exported from the Charleston area. Within two years, Eliza's efforts increased that volume to 130,000 pounds.\n\nThe Pollitzer Sisters - Anita, Carrie, and Mable Pollitzer were suffragettes who grew up at 5 Pitt Street in downtown Charleston.

After several days, the Queen of the Cofitachiqui escaped, accompanied by several of de Soto's men.\n\n– de Soto's 1540 encounter with Queen of the Cofitachiqui\n\nR\n\nBernice Robinson - This Civil Rights activist, along with Esau Jenkins and Septima Clark, established Citizenship Schools to teach black people how to read the Constitution so they could register to vote, a requirement of the time.

During her long career, this Spartanburg physician fought valiantly against everything from pellagra to child abuse. Our state led the nation in maternal and infant mortality, and perhaps her most important accomplishment was to establish America's first family planning clinic for a county health department.
