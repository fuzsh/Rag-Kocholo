        "text": "Jonathon Wolfson will resign his position on the Calabasas City Council effective Dec., 15. He is moving to Bell Canyon, The Acorn has learned.\n\nWolfson, a lawyer and former member of the city’s planning commission, was elected in March 2005 and re-elected in 2009. He served as mayor of Calabasas from 2009-2010. His term was set to expire in 2013.\n\n“It has been a privilege and honor to be a representative of the residents of Calabasas on the City Council, Wolfson said in a statement.\n\n“I have very much enjoyed my tenure and am proud of the many accomplishments made by our City Council during the last seven years.”\n\nAn Agoura High School graduate, Wolfson attended law school in Washington, D.C. before moving to Calabasas with his family in 1997. He served on the Calabasas Planning Commission for two years before being elected to the City Council.\n\n“Although my family and I are sad to be leaving the City of Calabasas, we are looking forward to our new home,” he said, thanking the community for their trust and support.\n\n“(I) know that this city will continue to shine and have a very bright future.”\n\nMayor James Bozajian said he will miss Wolfson’s expertise and professionalism.\n\n“His intelligent, well-reasoned approach to the issues coming before us was a calming influence at many times when our debates often became quite contentious. In particular, Jonathon’s work in pre-analyzing our annual budgets and his service as our liaison to the school district was exemplary,” Bozajian said.\n\nIn coming weeks, the City Council will work publicly to decide whether the vacancy should be filled through an appointment or via special election.\n\n“I’d like to look at all the options and then see what the choices are,” Councilmember Lucy Martin said. “Jonathon has been a dedicated and effective city council official with whom it’s been a pleasure to serve with.”\n\nWhen Robert Sibilia resigned from the Calabasas council and moved away from the city in 2000, his seat was left vacant and not filled until the 2001 general election. In this year’s city election, Sibilia fell 200 votes shy in his bid to return to the council. Challengers Martha Fritz and Alicia Weintraub followed Sibilia in the voting and might also be potential appointees.\n\nBozajian said, “I have no intention of voting to leave (the seat) open. I don’t think the public is going to want that.”\n\nA special election would have to wait until April 2012 at the earliest and could cost up to $50,000, The council is likely to save time and money by making an appointment.\n\nThe appointment will require votes from three out of the four remaining council members and must be made within 60 days of Wolfson’s departure, or the middle of February.\n\n“I plan to ask the council to hold special meetings to discuss this. If an appointment is decided, we will seek applicants and interview them publicly,” Bozajian said.\n\nAlso to be considered is whether or not the council wants a caretaker appointee, one who will fill Wolfson’s term and retire in 2013, or someone who intends to run for a second term, Bozajian said\n\nMary Sue Maurer, who joined the Calabasas council with Wolfson in 2005, said she will miss her colleague’s kind and thoughtful personna.\n\n“Some of my proudest accomplishments have been projects where I collaborated with Jon including developing a grant funding program for Calabasas schools and creating a number of disaster preparedness programs such as the drive-thru flu clinics and a special needs evacuation contact list,” Maurer said.\n\nResponsible for leading the global, commercial strategy for Princess Cruises, a division of Carnival Corp.
