        "text": "Hoju Koolander Posted on Jan 03, 2015 at 04:22 AM\n\nHoju Koolander Posted on Jan 03, 2015 at 04:19 AM\n\n@pikachulover Sky was appropriately named, she had good reach in The Wall and Hang Tough. I did actually catch an episode of Gladiators 2000, but the educational element took away the fun for me. GUTS on Nickelodeon was more my style, but came at the end of my Nick watching phase so I only saw it a few times. Thanks for mentioning it and the Hulk Hogan hosted reboot.\n\n@vaporman87 \"Rowsdower!\" oh, I own The Final Sacrifice on DVD, but I never made the Csonka Connection. It's funny how the brain can miss things like that.\n\nI had a hard time finding an attractive female Gladiator to crush on, but I always thought Lace was okay, since she was just fit and not ripped. My favorite male Gladiator was actually Hawk from the later seasons, he had a lot of energy and a little touch of crazy that made him extra cool.\n\npikachulover Posted on Jan 03, 2015 at 02:47 AM\n\nI liked American Gladiators as a kid. My favorite was Sky because she was really tall and the kids at school used to think I would grow up to be like seven feet! Sorry to say I only grew to be 5'7\". When I was kid I wanted to be on a Gladiator on the show.\n\nI'm surprised you didn't write about the kids' show Gladiators 2000. I liked that show. They would teach me about proper hygiene and nutrition.\n\nDo anybody remember when it was spoofed in Eek the Cat? Sharky watched a show called Patriotic Warriors and his favorite was named Platinum.\n\nWhen the revived version came out on NBC it wasn't as good. I didn't like that version.\n\nVaporman87 Posted on Jan 02, 2015 at 05:33 PM\n\nSweet! I can't say I watched American Gladiators religiously, but whenever I saw it on as I flipped through channels, I stopped to see the action.\n\nMy favorite events were usually the jousting and assault segments, but I also like the even where the contestant had to swing across on ropes, trying to avoid the Gladiator.\n\nThere were times that I wondered if the Gladiator was not quite giving it his/her all. Like, maybe they had to hold back a bit at a director/producer's request in order to make the show exciting. I don't know though. I haven't heard anything like that from any former Gladiators or folks on the show. Still, who knows.\n\nMy favorite Gladiators were Blaze and Siren (because I thought they were attractive). Among the male Gladiators, I really didn't have a favorite.\n\nMy favorite event was Assault. How I wished I could be a part of that one!\n\nWatching this show was never the same for me after watching the MST3K episode \"The Final Sacrifice\". In that episode (if you haven't watched it, you absolutely MUST!) Mike and the Bots constantly refer to Larry Csonka because the main character's dad looks exactly like him in a photo. Just a funny little tidbit there for you to chew on.\n\nAnybody who might suggest that the competition was never fierce on the show might want to watch this clip."
