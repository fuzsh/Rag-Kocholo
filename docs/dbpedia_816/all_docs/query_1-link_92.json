        "text": "Showtime can’t let “Dexter” die — the franchise and, it turns out, the eponymous antihero himself.\n\nFans were unhappy with the ending of the original series in 2013, which remains the most watched program in the history of the Paramount-owned premium cable network. They were perhaps even angrier about how the recent revival, “Dexter: New Blood,” concluded in 2022, with Dexter Morgan’s son, Harrison, murdering him.\n\nLoyal followers were having none of it. They didn’t buy the ending, believing it betrayed the character of the brilliant serial killer with a code played by Michael C. Hall.\n\nBut Paramount Global co-Chief Executive and Showtime boss Chris McCarthy saw an opportunity to harness viewers’ enthusiasm, even if their emotions were negative. This was a group of people who cared enough about the show to go into painstaking detail online about how the finale didn’t work and how the show should have ended. Those are the makings of a potentially lucrative multipronged franchise.\n\n“To fall in love with a serial killer, frankly, takes a minute,” McCarthy, president and CEO of Showtime/MTV Entertainment Studios and Paramount Media Networks, said in an interview. “I knew that there would be a really big opportunity if we could crack the nut of what is the love and passion of the series but then actually explode it into a franchise.”\n\nSo Paramount is taking a gamble. It’s branching out one of Showtime’s most beloved properties, much in the same way that the company turned Taylor Sheridan’s “Yellowstone” into a western cable TV and streaming universe with spinoffs and prequels. The first show in this effort is “Dexter: Original Sin,” which launches on Paramount+ with Showtime in December.\n\nSet in the 1990s, the origin story features several actors who became famous during that era of movies and TV, including Christian Slater and Sarah Michelle Gellar. At Comic-Con San Diego last month, the company announced that Hall would return to star in the new series, “Dexter: Resurrection,” effectively bringing the character back from the dead, and to do voice-over work for “Original Sin,” a prequel in which Patrick Gibson plays a younger Dexter.\n\nClyde Phillips, the original showrunner on “Dexter” and “New Blood,” happened to have seen every episode of “Yellowstone” and its Paramount+ prequels, “1883” and “1923,” so he understood what McCarthy was looking for when they started talking about where to go with the property.\n\n“This will appeal to a new audience, who will then go back and watch the original show,” Phillips said of the strategy. “That’s the wisdom here. Rather than just continuing with the show, we’re giving them a prequel, and they can watch and say, ‘Hmm, this is interesting. I wonder what the old show is.’ ”\n\nThe broader idea is to use “Dexter” and new Showtime series, including “The Agency” starring Michael Fassbender, to bring a bigger audience to streaming service Paramount+, which is growing but still lags rivals including Netflix and Disney+. The service reached 71 million subscribers after adding 3.7 million during the most recent quarter. It accounted for just 1.1% of U.S. TV viewing in June, according to Nielsen.\n\nBoosting Paramount’s streaming prowess is a high priority for a company that is in the midst of a tumultuous period of change. Paramount and David Ellison’s Skydance Media are set to merge next year, after finally getting the sign-off for the complicated deal from Paramount’s board and its controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone.\n\nShowtime has already undergone its own massive overhaul. After years of being a respected but distant No. 2 to HBO in the premium pay-TV business, the Showtime brand was merged with Paramount+, essentially ending its run as a standalone force in cable and streaming.\n\nBut Paramount’s theory is that Showtime and its shows still have appeal among a more affluent and city-dwelling audience than many of the channels, such as CBS, that feed the company’s larger streaming effort, which is powered by content such as “Mayor of Kingstown,” “Star Trek” and “NCIS.”\n\nTo further stoke momentum for the “Dexter” expansion, Paramount turned to Netflix.\n\nFans of “Dexter” tend to be in an age range of 40 to 60 years old, so Paramount needed a way to get the series in front of younger viewers. To do that, the company took the usual step of making a one-year licensing deal for Netflix to stream the original eight seasons on its service. Execs were hoping for a version of the “Netflix effect” that made basic-cable stalwart “Suits” a streaming hit years after its run on USA Network.\n\nAfter all, Netflix had already seen major success with serial killer-themed shows such as “You,” “Dahmer” and “Mindhunter.” So Paramount ended up turning to an ostensible rival in order to, in McCarthy’s words, create “a conduit for brand-new fans.” The Netflix license expires next summer, around the time when “Resurrection” is scheduled to debut.\n\nThe show landed on Netflix in mid-June with 96 episodes and quickly rose into the top-10 charts for U.S. streaming across all services, according to Nielsen data. During the week of July 1-7 (the most recent data available), “Dexter” amassed 1.2 billion minutes viewed, making it the sixth most-watched program on streaming during that time period.\n\nPremiering in 2006, Dexter eventually grew to 3.6 million linear viewers for its series finale, nearly five times the audience of its debut, making it the No. 3 premium cable show at the time, behind HBO’s “Game of Thrones” and “True Blood.”\n\nBy the time “Dexter: New Blood” arrived in 2021, the world of cable had changed dramatically, with pay-TV bundles on the decline and streaming on the rise. The premiere drew 1.2 million viewers to Showtime, but its audience increased to 3.9 million through streaming and video on-demand. It was easily the top driver of signups for Showtime’s now-defunct standalone streaming offering.\n\nToday, the television landscape has shifted even more, and it remains to be seen whether the fan base for “Dexter” can support multiple continuations and offshoots after all this time. But McCarthy is optimistic that old fans and new ones will come back to Paramount+ for more.\n\n“We can create a universe as big as we want, but there is still a really large younger audience that is not in our service today but could potentially be,” McCarthy said. “Those were the elements that we pulled together to make what I think is going to be a monster hit for us.”\n\nThe other big question remains: Will audiences buy Hall’s return to the role of Dexter Morgan, after he was so controversially killed off?\n\n“Who are we kidding?” Phillips said. “If we get Michael C. Hall back into Showtime’s No. 1 show on Paramount+, people are gonna watch it. So we’re invigorated in the writing room, now that we’ve figured out how to bring him back.”\n\nStuff we wrote\n\nWhy Amazon Prime’s hit anti-superhero series ‘The Boys’ keeps getting bigger.
