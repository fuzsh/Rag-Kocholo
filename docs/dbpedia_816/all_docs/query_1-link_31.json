        "text": "It’s almost time to crown the next Miss USA, and what better way to gear up for this year’s competition than to look back at the most memorable moments of years past — from famous actresses that once competed for the title, to the most cringe-worthy answers to judge’s questions. Husband and wife duo Nick and Vanessa Lachey will host this year’s competition at the Grand Sierra Resort and Casino in Reno, Nevada. Tune in May 2 to see current titleholder Sarah Rose Summers pass on her crown to the next Miss USA.\n\n1. “The Bachelorette” Hannah Brown Competes for Miss USA 2018 Before Brown found fame on Colton Underwood’s season of “The Bachelor” and was chosen to be next season’s bachelorette, Brown was crowned Miss Alabama 2018. But she didn’t make it into the top 15 at Miss USA — in fact, she was bested by fellow contestant Miss North Carolina 2018 Caelynn Mill-Keyes. The two were known for feuding on “The Bachelor.”\n\n2. “The Bachelor” contestant Caelynn Miller-Keyes Named Runner Up to Miss USA 2018 One of the women who took a shot at winning Colton Underwood on ABC’s “The Bachelor” was once a pageant queen. After winning Miss North Carolina 2018, she become one of two finalists at Miss USA 2018 — but lost to Miss Nebraska Sarah Rose Summers.\n\n3. Miss Hawaii Is Asked Who She’d Vote For in 2016: Clinton or Trump? At the 2016 Miss USA pageant, Chelsea Hardin of Hawaii was asked a political (and personal) question that would make the audience boo and plunge Twitter into heated discussion: “With Hillary Clinton expected to surpass the delegate count needed to win the Democratic party nomination, my question to you is: If the election were held tomorrow, would you vote Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump for President and why would you chose one over the other?” asked Harper’s Bazaar Executive Editor Laura Brown. Her answer: “I would get that right? All I have to say — it doesn’t matter what gender. What we need in the United States is someone who represents those of us who don’t feel like we have a voice, those of us who want our voices heard. We need a president to push for what is right, and push for what America really needs.”\n\n4. The Jonas Brothers Rock Out During the 2013 Swimsuit Competition Way before the JoBros broke up the first time, they played their song “Pom Poms” at Miss USA 2013 — and they had a team of swimsuited pageant queens for backup dancers. Hey, since they’re back together now… maybe this year we’ll get an encore?\n\n5. DJ Pauly D Deejays at Miss USA 2013 Another celebrity who’s as relevant today as he was in 2013 — DJ Pauly D, whose latest reality show “Double Shot at Love” is currently airing on MTV. The “Jersey Shore” star spun some discs and pumped his fist while each finalist had her moment to strut onto the runway. Come for the fresh beats, stay for the awkward dance interactions between Pauly and the contestants.\n\n6. Miss Utah Answers a Question About the Gender Wage Gap in 2013 It was an eventful year. Nick Jonas was actually standing on stage with Miss Utah Marissa Powell when Nene Leakes asked her a hard hitting question: What does it say about society that 40% of women are the primary earners in their household but continued to be paid less than men? “The men are seen as the leaders of this, so we need to try to figure out how to create education better so we can solve this problem,” was Utah’s answer.\n\n7. Olivia Culpo Becomes the First Miss Rhode Island to Win Miss USA in 2012 Culpo, who hails from Cranston, Rhode Island, was crowned Miss USA in 2012, becoming the first contestant from Rhode Island ever to win the title. Before winning Miss Rhode Island, Culpo had never competed in a pageant before — she entered the pageant on a whim. She would go on to become Miss Universe 2012 — the last Miss USA to hold the title.\n\n8. Rima Fakih Becomes First Muslim Woman to Win Miss USA in 2010 Born in Lebanon, Fakih and her family immigrated to the U.S. in the 1990s and later moved to Dearborn, Michigan, where she became Miss Michigan. Now an actress, model, and professional wrestler, Fakih’s Miss USA title was called into question twice during her reign — once when photos surfaced of her at a pole dancing class, and again for sleeping through an interview after a night of drinking. She was allowed to keep her crown both times.\n\n9. Perez Hilton Asks Miss California Her Opinion on Same-Sex Marriage in 2009 During the question-answer portion of Miss USA 2009, celebrity blogger Perez Hilton asked Miss California Carrie Prejean if she believed all states should follow Vermont in legalizing same sex marriage. Her answer would land her in hot water, and some believe it’s the reason she ended up as the runner up to Miss North Carolina. She responded: “I believe marriage should be between a man and a woman, no offense to anybody out there.”\n\n10. Miss USA 2006 Tara Conner Goes to Rehab for Substance Abuse After a TMZ article claimed Conner was in danger of being dethroned for excessive drinking and other misconduct, she was allowed to keep her title as Miss USA under the condition that she spend time in a rehabilitation center. She was released two months later, and acknowledged having had problems with substance abuse in an interview with Matt Lauer.\n\n11. Ali Landry Becomes Miss USA 1996 This Louisiana native is known as the “Doritos Girl” for a 1998 Super Bowl commercial, and for playing Rita Lefleur on sitcom “Eve.” She’s also known for her two-week marriage to Mario Lopez in 2004, whom she met at Miss Teen USA 1998 where he was a presenter and she was a commentator.\n\n12. “Meet the Barkers” Actress Shanna Moakler Named Miss USA 1995 Runner-Up …but she later inherited the title of Miss USA when the winner, Chelsi Smith of Texas, went on to win Miss Universe 1995. Moakler was originally Miss New York 1995.\n\n13. Kenya Moore Wins Miss USA 1993 Moore, who previously won the title of Miss Michigan, was the second African American woman to ever win Miss USA. The first was Carole Gist in 1990. Moore would go on to act in “The Real Housewives of Atlanta” among other credits.\n\n14. Halle Berry is First Runner Up to Miss USA 1986 Before she was an actress, she was a pageant queen. Berry was crowned Miss Ohio 1986, and came very close to being Miss USA. She would go on to compete at Miss World, where she came in 8th."
