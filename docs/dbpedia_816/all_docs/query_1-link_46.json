        "text": "Miss USA 1990 Date March 3, 1990 Presenters Dick Clark, Leeza Gibbons and Laura Harring Venue Century II Convention Center, Wichita, Kansas Broadcaster CBS, KWCH Winner Carole Gist\n\nMichigan Congeniality Janet Tveita Photogenic Stephanie Teneyck\n\nMiss USA 1990, the 39th Miss USA pageant, was televised live from the Century II Convention Center in Wichita, Kansas on March 2, 1990.\n\nAt the conclusion of the final competition, Carole Gist of Michigan was crowned by outgoing titleholder Gretchen Polhemus of Texas. Carole became the first African American winner ever and the first woman from Michigan to be crowned as Miss USA.\n\nFor the first time, the judges' individual scores were visible to the viewing audience, adding transparency to the pageant.\n\nAlso in 1990, a major format change that transformed the Miss USA competition for the next decade was introduced, in which the delegates would face an extra round of elimination on finals night: the Top 6 judges' questions.\n\nInstead of reducing the top 12 to the usual Final 5, the judges would pick a momentary top 6. Those 6 finalists would answer questions from the judges and the field was reduced to a final 3 who would face the traditional final question, adding unpredictability to the competition after 5 Texan Miss USA winners from GuyRex Associates, who would lose their Miss Texas USA franchise the next year.\n\nThe pageant was hosted by Dick Clark for the second of five times, with color commentary by Leeza Gibbons and Laura Harring, Miss USA 1985.\n\nThis was the first time the pageant was held in Wichita, where it would be staged for the next four years.\n\nContents\n\n1 Results\n\n1.1 Placements\n\n1.2 Special awards\n\n1.3 Historical significance\n\n2 Scores\n\n2.1 Preliminary competition\n\n2.2 Final competition\n\n3 Delegates\n\n4 Crossovers\n\n5 References\n\n6 External links\n\nResults\n\nPlacements\n\nMiss USA 1990: Carole Gist (Michigan)\n\nThe runners-up were:\n\n1st runner-up: Gina Tolleson (South Carolina)\n\n2nd runner-up: Karin Hartz (New Jersey)\n\nThe other top six finalists were (in alphabetical order): Karin Meyer (Alaska), Brenda Leithleiter (Georgia) and Tiffany Tenfelde (Kentucky).\n\nThe remaining semi-finalists were (in order of placement): Catherine Staples (District of Columbia), Charita Moses (Tennessee), Stephanie Kuehne (Texas), Karla Myers (Illinois), Stephanie Teneyck (Mississippi), Melissa Proctor (Ohio)\n\nSpecial awards\n\nMiss Congeniality: Janet Tveita (Minnesota)\n\nMiss Photogenic: Stephanie Teneyck (Mississippi)\n\nHistorical significance\n\nCarole Gist was Michigan's first placement since 1983 and went on to win the title.\n\nNew Jersey placed second runner-up for the second consecutive year, a record for the state.\n\nThis was Alaska's fourth placement ever, and their first since 1978.\n\nKentucky placed for the first time since 1982.\n\nGeorgia placed for the sixth consecutive year, with top six placements or higher every year.\n\nThis was District of Columbia's first placement since 1984. District of Columbia would not place again until 2001.\n\nIllinois placed for the seventh consecutive year.\n\nTexas had a semifinalist for the sixteenth and last year in succession. The state would not place in 1991.\n\nMississippi recorded their fourth placement in five years, a record for the state. They did not place again until 2005.\n\nOhio placed for the first time since Halle Berry was first runner-up in 1986. The state did not place again until 1999.\n\nGina Tolleson went on to represent USA at Miss World which she won. Carole Gist represented USA at Miss Universe 1990 where she finished runner-up to Norway's Mona Grudt. If Carole had won Miss Universe, Miss South Carolina, Gina Tolleson would have become Miss USA and Miss New Jersey, Karin Hartz, would have gone on to represent the USA at the Miss World Pageant.\n\nScores\n\nPreliminary competition\n\nThe following are the contestants' scores in the preliminary competition.\n\nState Interview Swimsuit Evening gown Average Alabama 7.633 7.639 8.148 7.807 Alaska 8.939 8.022 8.021 8.327 Arizona 7.956 7.547 7.698 7.734 Arkansas 7.482 7.241 7.992 8.040 California 8.372 7.709 8.378 8.153 Colorado 8.311 7.778 7.888 7.992 Connecticut 7.406 7.427 7.577 7.470 Delaware 8.128 7.584 8.411 8.041 District of Columbia 8.187 8.358 8.088 8.211 Florida 7.867 8.220 8.088 8.058 Georgia 8.944 8.217 8.329 8.497 Hawaii 6.094 7.673 7.672 7.146 Idaho 7.561 7.036 7.239 7.279 Illinois 8.317 8.294 8.372 8.328 Indiana 8.717 7.438 7.644 7.933 Iowa 7.600 7.700 7.327 7.542 Kansas 8.078 8.167 8.350 8.198 Kentucky 8.733 8.383 8.338 8.485 Louisiana 8.044 8.094 7.848 7.995 Maine 7.678 7.620 7.322 7.540 Maryland 8.121 7.868 7.872 7.954 Massachusetts 7.638 7.180 7.287 7.368 Michigan 8.481 8.303 8.649 8.478 Minnesota 7.871 7.948 7.783 7.867 Mississippi 8.316 8.271 8.161 8.249 Missouri 8.449 8.009 7.861 8.106 Montana 7.250 7.004 6.987 7.080 Nebraska 8.304 7.123 7.326 7.584 Nevada 8.000 7.861 7.947 7.936 New Hampshire 7.744 7.411 7.423 7.526 New Jersey 8.711 7.753 8.306 8.257 New Mexico 7.472 7.367 7.437 7.425 New York 8.444 8.140 7.928 8.171 North Carolina 7.561 7.556 7.546 7.554 North Dakota 8.139 7.444 7.809 7.797 Ohio 8.244 8.294 8.544 8.361 Oklahoma 8.144 8.150 7.989 8.094 Oregon 8.128 7.290 6.833 7.417 Pennsylvania 7.944 7.552 7.806 7.767 Rhode Island 7.080 7.643 7.428 7.384 South Carolina 8.589 8.314 8.641 8.515 South Dakota 7.233 7.604 7.249 7.362 Tennessee 8.526 8.186 8.614 8.442 Texas 8.156 8.310 8.279 8.248 Utah 8.722 7.838 7.606 8.055 Vermont 7.267 7.256 6.983 7.169 Virginia 8.310 8.189 7.622 8.040 Washington 7.817 7.960 7.700 7.826 West Virginia 7.894 7.706 8.022 7.874 Wisconsin 8.028 7.670 7.589 7.762 Wyoming 7.650 8.012 8.128 7.930\n\nWinner\n\nFirst runner-up\n\nSecond runner-up\n\nTop 6 Finalist\n\nTop 12 Semifinalist\n\nFinal competition\n\nCountry Interview Swimsuit Evening Gown Average Michigan 9.261 9.364 9.489 9.371 New Jersey 9.344 9.206 9.414 9.321 Alaska 9.111 9.322 9.218 9.217 Kentucky 8.981 9.100 9.289 9.123 South Carolina 8.848 9.139 9.259 9.082 Georgia 8.683 9.325 9.100 9.036 District of Columbia 8.577 9.078 9.157 8.937 Tennessee 8.739 8.903 9.023 8.888 Texas 8.922 8.839 8.869 8.876 Illinois 8.622 8.772 9.176 8.856 Mississippi 8.574 8.694 8.792 8.686 Ohio 8.481 8.370 8.746 8.532\n\nWinner\n\nFirst runner-up\n\nSecond runner-up\n\nTop 6 Finalist\n\nDelegates\n\nThe Miss USA 1990 delegates were:\n\nAlabama - Natalie Moore\n\nAlaska - Karin Meyer\n\nArizona - Lezlie Leonard\n\nArkansas - Kathryn Harris\n\nCalifornia - Cynthia Nelson\n\nColorado - Michelle Harrison\n\nConnecticut - Allison Barbeau-Diorio\n\nDelaware - Nicci Dent\n\nDistrict of Columbia - Catherine Staples\n\nFlorida - Tricia Hahn\n\nGeorgia - Brenda Leithleiter\n\nHawaii - Leimomi Bacalso\n\nIdaho - Cindy Estey\n\nIllinois - Karla Myers\n\nIndiana - Meri Lyn Buker\n\nIowa - Elizabeth Muelhaupt\n\nKansas - Rebecca Porter\n\nKentucky - Tiffany Tenfelde\n\nLouisiana - Jeanne Burns\n\nMaine - Leigh Bubar\n\nMaryland - Julie Stanford\n\nMassachusetts - Laureen Murphy\n\nMichigan - Carole Gist\n\nMinnesota - Janet Tveita\n\nMississippi - Stephanie Teneyck\n\nMissouri - Lori Suschnick\n\nMontana - Kimberlee Burger\n\nNebraska - Angela Humphrey\n\nNevada - Michelle Yegee\n\nNew Hampshire - Lisa Parnpichate\n\nNew Jersey - Karin Hartz\n\nNew Mexico - Larissa Canaday\n\nNew York - Patricia Murphy\n\nNorth Carolina - Altman Allen\n\nNorth Dakota - Kari Larson\n\nOhio - Melissa Proctor\n\nOklahoma - Lauralynn Norton\n\nOregon - Elizabeth Michaud\n\nPennsylvania - Elizabeth Cebak\n\nRhode Island - Susan Lima\n\nSouth Carolina - Gina Tolleson\n\nSouth Dakota - Valerie Sejnoha\n\nTennessee - Charita Moses\n\nTexas - Stephanie Kuehne\n\nUtah - Debra Linn\n\nVermont - Stephanie Bessey\n\nVirginia - Evelyn Green\n\nWashington - Melissa Dickson\n\nWest Virginia - Sabrina Anderson\n\nWisconsin - Lynn Mulcahy\n\nWyoming - Cheryl James\n\nCrossovers\n\n1990 was the year with the smallest number of crossover contestants since 1986.\n\nOnly three delegates had previously competed in the Miss Teen USA pageant:\n\nJulie Stanford (Maryland) - Miss Maryland Teen USA 1986\n\nKari Larson (North Dakota) - Miss North Dakota Teen USA 1984 (Semi-finalist at Miss Teen USA 1984)\n\nAllison Barbeau-Diorio (Connecticut) - Miss Connecticut Teen USA 1987\n\nNo former Miss America delegates competed for the second year in a row.\n\nGina Tolleson later won Miss World 1990.\n\nReferences"
