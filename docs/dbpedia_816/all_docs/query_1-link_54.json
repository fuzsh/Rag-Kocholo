Vanessa Williams became the first Black woman to win the Miss America title in 1984. Carole Gist won Miss USA in 1990. Janel Bishop won Miss Teen USA in 1991.\n\nEach competition has had multiple Black winners since.\n\nLast week, for the first time, black women wore the crowns of all three major pageants simultaneously.\n\nCheslie Kryst, 28, won the Miss USA contest, and Kaliegh Garris, 18, won Miss Teen USA. They joined Nia Franklin, 25, who was crowned as the 2019 Miss America in September 2018.\n\nThe three wins have become a powerful symbol of how much American views on beauty have evolved from a past marred by racism and gender stereotypes, even as Black women leaders are still severely underrepresented in other fields, like corporate America or in Congress.\n\n“It is important to little Brown and Black girls to see three strong figures, three strong women, African-American women that are doing so much great work,” Ms. Franklin said on Saturday. “People will argue that race doesn’t matter. But race does matter in America, because of the history, because of slavery.”\n\nNews of the pageant wins resonated with many last Saturday, drawing words of support from the actress Halle Berry and Sen. Kamala Harris, who is vying for the 2020 Democratic Party presidential nomination, among other influential figures.\n\n“Nia, Cheslie, and Kaliegh: you are trailblazers, creating your own path on your own terms,” Harris said on Twitter.\n\nMihir Zaveri, NY Times\n\nPost Staff\n\nCelebrating African American legacy through food, music and art, Oakland’s Ninth Annual Black-Eyed Pea Festival will be bigger and better at its new location at Marston Campbell Park in West Oakland on Sept. 14.\n\nAppealing to all ages, the free festival will feature African American traditional music from several genres including straight-ahead jazz, New Orleans-style second-line and Zydeco. Our full line-up includes headliner Andre Thierry Accordion Soul Music (Zydeco); MJ’s Brass Boppers (second-line); Valerie Troutt’s MoonCandy, and Dimensions Dance Theatre.\n\nThe festival will begin with sacred acknowledgment of the land by Wakan-Wiya Two-Spirit Drum and Awon Ohun Omnira’s drumming homage to African ancestors.\n\nEspecially for kids\n\nThe BEPF is providing dedicated fun for children.\n\nFrom 1:30-2:30, the festival has entertainment for children by youth members of the Prescott Circus including stilt walkers, juggling, and tumbling. They will remain on hand for the day so children can learn the African roots of circus arts.\n\nPatanisha Williams will provide arts and crafts for toddlers up to early teens, using black-eyed peas as well as drawing and painting with a focus on Ghana’s Adinkra ‘alphabet’ of symbols.\n\nFor adults, Bushmama will conduct an indigo dying workshop, referencing the African origins of the plant cultivated by enslaved Africans that would eventually give rise to the denim industry.\n\nHand-made items for sale by people of African descent will include among others the paintings, mugs and prints by the festival’s poster designer Karin Turner.\n\nCome and eat\n\nLocal chefs from Ate O Clock catering and Coco Breeze restaurant offer typical soul food and Trinidadian fare, including black-eyed peas. Hal Stephen’ will have your festival fare – hot dogs and hamburgers – but also a vegan Black-eyed pea patty.\n\nWhy a Black-Eyed Pea Festival?\n\n“The black-eyed pea is a metaphor for what is resilient, creative, and collaborative about African-American culture,” said Wanda Ravernell, director of the Black-Eyed Pea Festival and founder of Omnira Institute.\n\n“We are especially pleased to have a range of genres in this year’s line-up because it brings to mind the time when Oakland’s Seventh Street was the ‘Harlem of the West,’” Ravernell said. Gentrification has almost finished the job that the construction of the Grove Shafter Freeway, BART tracks and the Post Office did in dividing what had once been a thriving Black community.\n\nThe sound of the music, the scent of the food and the creativity of the artists invokes that time of prosperity. “Their work is entertaining, but it’s also a history lesson and a healing.”\n\nThe festival is sponsored by the Post News group and receives support from the California Arts Council, The San Francisco Foundation, the Alliance for California Traditional Arts and the Center for Cultural Power.\n\n“This festival brings our mission to life,” says Ravernell. “We want to highlight and preserve the cultural and spiritual traditions of African Americans and demonstrate how these traditions are connected to Africa and the African Diaspora.”\n\nThe festival still has a few slots left for vendors of African descent who create their own work. The fee is $70. The City of Oakland requires vendors to have an Oakland business license as well as a temporary seller’s permit.\n\nFor more information on vending opportunities or the festival in general, please see our web site www.oakbepf.com or email us at oakbepf@gmail.com or call (510) 332-5851.\n\n# # #\n\nWho: The 9th Annual Black-Eyed Pea Festival\n\nWhen: Sat.

Richard Curtis IV, an Oakland native and renowned dancer, made a triumphant return as a featured performer on the “Out of This World” tour starring hip-hop legend Missy Elliott. The tour captivated a nearly sold-out crowd at the Oakland Arena on Tuesday, July 9.\n\nRichard Curtis IV, the creative force behind the SwaggBounce dance style, shared the stage with hip-hop icons Missy Elliott, Ciara, and Busta Rhymes. The “Out of This World – The Experience” tour has been making waves across major U.S. cities, and the special performance in Oakland resonated deeply with the community.\n\nKnown by his social media handle @yoitswagg, Curtis has garnered a massive following online for his unique dance style that blends precision, energy, and innovation. His SwaggBounce dance has revolutionized the dance community, solidifying his status in urban music culture.\n\nCurtis attended St. Paul’s Episcopal School and graduated from the Oakland School for the Arts’ School of Dance. His early dance training began at the age of 4 at Oakland’s New Style Motherlode Dance Studio and Culture Shock Oakland.\n\nSince then, he has performed with some of the biggest names in the music industry, including Janet Jackson, Rihanna, Nicki Minaj, Childish Gambino, and Ozuna. His dynamic choreography and high-energy performances have taken him from the United States to Europe, leaving a lasting impact on audiences worldwide.\n\nReflecting on his return to Oakland, Curtis said, “I am thrilled and honored to have the opportunity to dance for the legendary Missy Elliott on her tour and to inspire my community in Oakland. Missy’s music has been a source of inspiration for me throughout my career, and it’s a blessing to bring the SwaggBounce to the stage alongside such an iconic artist.”\n\nCurtis’ journey from local dance studios to international stages serves as a powerful reminder to young people in Oakland to follow their dreams. His success story is a beacon of hope and inspiration, proving that with hard work and dedication, anything is possible.\n\nFor more information about Richard “Swagg” Curtis IV and his upcoming performances, follow @yoitswagg on all social media platforms.
