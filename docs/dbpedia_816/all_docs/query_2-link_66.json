Fred was a longtime sports guy who stepped down in 1999. In playful play on words, morning anchor Tom Haule introduced Fred for the last time as \"not shy, certainly retiring.\" Tom had high praise for Fred near the end of his shift: \"Sometimes we’re moody in here and Fred has always been a joy to work with. Constantly in control, just setting a standard for the rest of us. You approach the job with a very even tempo and a very clear control over everything you’ve done. We’re gonna miss you. We really are.\"\n\nCo-anchor Linda Nunez joined in the farewell praise. \"They’ve had lots of people sitting in this anchor chair. You’ve been the only one, the only sports guy. You’re the only morning guy left in the 10 years that I’ve been here. We’re really going to miss you,\" echoed Linda. Fred is well known for his long sportscasts. \"We figured it out,\" Tom told Fred. \"You were actually going to retire at the end of the year but taking all of your sports reports, realizing how each one has gone over time, it’s now over for you. We’re actually a dysfunctional family at times, but as we like to say, we’re losing one big member,\" Tom concluded.\n\nGALLAGHER, Mike: KRLA, 2001-23. Mike's syndicated Salem show moved to morning drive on October 1, 2001. In August 2002 he moved out of morning drive and is now heard late nights at KRLA.\n\nHow Mike fell in love with radio: \"In 1978, as a high school senior, I got a job at a local construction company in my hometown of Dayton, Ohio. I worked in the mailroom as an assistant to a great guy named Grady. He loved the local talk radio station, WAVI (\"People Power - WAVI\"), and always had it on in the mailroom. I, too, became enamored with the format and loved the local personalities: Bob Kwessel, Brad Clay, Chris Mitchell, and Art Barrett. I remember those guys like it was yesterday. One day, I mustered up the nerve to drive to the station and ask for a tour. As I walked by the bulletin board, there was a memo saying they were still looking for a young \"talkmaster\" (\"talkmaster\" was the fairly pretentious term they used for talk hosts then) and I figured, heck, I'm 17 and I want to talk on the radio, I can do that. So I knocked on program director Chris Mitchell's door, introduced myself, and told him I wanted a job. He let me go on that evening for one of the hosts who was out sick, and they hired me the next day. I've been talking on the radio ever since.\"\n\nGallardo, Fred: KLOS, 1977; KLSX, 1987-88. Fred was last seen working for a car dealership in Simi Valley.\n\nGalvez, Francisco: KLAX, 2001; KMJR, 2001. Pacorro is part of a syndicated afternoon drive show. He is a seasoned voice actor and imitator, and he lends different voices to create characters for the show.\n\nGAMACHE, Tom: KPPC, 1969; KMET, 1969-71. Tom was at the vortex of “underground radio.” He was born and raised in Manchester, New Hampshire. Tom became good friends with Peter Wolf (later of the J. Geils Band) while attending Boston University’s School of Communication. Tom was quoted in an R&R special edition on “The AOR Story” about Peter’s influence. “Peter was responsible for getting me to sit down in front of the microphone for the first time. He and I used to sit around listening to our collections of Little Walter records.” Peter told Tom about the MIT 30-watt FM off-campus radio station that reached practically every student in the city.\n\nArmed with a box of his own records, Tom set out “to make as much of a travesty of commercial radio as possible.” He spent 2 years at MIT radio and two more years across town at Boston University’s 50,0000 watter, WBUR. A few more months at WBCN-Boston and then he sold everything, bought his first new truck ever and headed West looking for any and all other “progressive” stations.\n\nHe got to L.A. and took a late evening shift at KPPC and soon thereafter was one of the first three “live” jocks on KMET. “I believe that what we were doing on the radio in the mid to late sixties was exactly the opposite of what financially successful ‘rock stations’ (like KMET) would later become. Today the written history of the format picks up in the early seventies and sings the praises of profit rather than the early history of the creation of a culture.”\n\nAfter radio Tom became involved with record production, management and radio syndication. He also became a master of outdoor photography, working with many national parks, magazines and newspapers doing both landscape and wildlife work. From Arnold Passman’s book, D.J.’s: “Tom is generally recognized as the first of the underground rock jocks.” R&R concluded: “Tom was a radio revolutionary in the truest sense.”\n\nGandell, Al: KTYM. Unknown.\n\nGARBER, Mary Beth: Mary Beth was president of the SCBA and she was the Katz Radio Group Executive Vice President for Radio Analysis and Insights. She now has a successful VO career narrating audio books.\n\nIn 2008 Mary Beth was named Broadcaster of the Year at the annual national Radio Advertising Bureau convention in Atlanta. Mary Beth led the SCBA for over a decade. During that time the Los Angeles Radio market grew to be the largest in the world, and the only one with annual revenues – again in 2007 – exceeding one billion dollars. During her tenure she co-produced, in conjunction with Arbitron, three behavioral studies about media usage and created the concept of ‘The Virtual Neighborhoods of Radio.’ (\n\nAn early and vocal advocate of radio’s continued importance as a 21st century medium, she has written and spoken throughout the country on the value of using Radio together with the Internet to build stronger, more targeted marketing campaigns. After receiving her award in Atlanta, Mrs. Garber continued her advocacy urging the ballroom of 1,200 Radio execs to spread the word that “The Internet won’t kill Radio. It will make Radio.” Mary Beth has received numerous honors over her distinguished advertising and broadcast career including the Genii Award for Excellence in Radio, from the American Women in Radio and Television, the 2007 Golden Buccaneer Award from PIRATES (Print, Interactive Radio and TV Education Society) for her philanthropic endeavors, and she has been on Radio Ink magazine’s list of ’20 Most Influential Women In Radio’ since its inception in 1999.\n\nGARCIA, Dominick: KRLA, 1986-97; KIKF, 1997-99. Dominick also worked at Metro Networks.\n\nDominick grew up and went to school in Denver where he got his early broadcasting experience working as an assistant tv director and part-time booth announcer as well as doing weekends on radio. \"I was always playing with tape recorders and listening to the radio. Growing up, one of my favorite radio stations was the ‘Mighty 95,’ KIMN. When the boys in the neighborhood were saving up for a new football, I was saving up for another new album.\" In 1974 and through the disco era, he jocked on KDKO-Denver. The station was cited as station of the year by Billboard. Later in the 1970s, Dominick worked in radio and acted in community theater in Santa Fe. He spent half of the 1980s back in Denver radio working on KBRQ, KDKO, KLSC and Magic Johnson's station, KRZN.\n\nHe moved to Southern California with the sole purpose of getting a radio gig but ended up working as part of the crew for Hollywood Center Studios. Eventually Dominick joined KRLA in a behind-the-scenes capacity. From the all-night shift he spent three years doing middays. At KIKfm, he worked as Donnie Lee.\n\nGarcia, Eleazar: KSCA, 2002-05. Eleazar took over as pd at the Spanish KSCA in the summer of 2002.\n\nGARCIA, Jeff: KPWR, 1998-2015; KRRL, 2015-23. In the early Fall of 2005, Jeff was promoted to sports guy in Big Boy's Neighborhood. He's now executive producer of The Cruz Show at KRRL (Real 92.3).\n\nJeff is a bright example of hustling that pays off. Born in Orange County, he grew up in Hacienda Heights. \"I was working in a restaurant when I heard ‘Power’s’ Frank Lozano invite people to be guest dj’s. I used to take him food from the restaurant. He really piqued my interest in radio. I’ve always been a music person, but he got me excited about radio.\"\n\nJeff joined the Academy of Radio & TV in Huntington Beach and got the basics. \"Just knowing about cart machines and reel-to-reel gave me an advantage over other interns.\" In 1993, Jeff started working overnights at KGGI and eventually moved to evenings. Early in 1996 he joined KMXE-Las Vegas and shortly after he arrived, the station flipped formats. \"During the summer of 1996 I was playing Hootie & the Blowfish six days a week in Las Vegas while I drove through 130 degree temperatures for the weekend shift at KPWR.\" Eventually he was offered two weekend shifts and decided to move back to the Southland. \"Vegas pretty much sucked.\" When overnighter Josefa Salinas married Coolio, Jeff was offered the all-night shift on an interim basis and decided to quit a weekday job at a beer distributor and make a commitment to do anything he could at the station. From a part-time production guy, he is now doing it full-time.\n\nGarcia, Vince: KTWV, 1998-2004. Vince worked swing at \"the WAVE.\"\n\nGARDNER, Bill: KPCC, 1984-2000; KKJZ, 2006-07; KPFK, 2000-20. Bill hosted the quintessential doo-wop music show on Friday nights at KPCC until a format change dropping all music programming in the spring of 2000. He is a supervisor of social workers who aid victims of child abuse in Los Angeles County. His weekly show, Rhapsody in Black, moved to KPFK in May 2000 and he hosted a weekend show on KKJZ playing jazz, blues and classic r&b until the spring of 2007 when there was a management change.\n\nBorn June 4, 1938, in Los Angeles, Bill is the quintessential host of Southern California's long-standing doo-wop music show, the “R&B Time Capsule.” He graduated from Jefferson High School and Cal State Los Angeles. When KPCC eliminated music, Bill took his show to KPFK. The tall historian is frequently seen supporting the Southern California Doo-Wop Society. \"My mother used to play all those old r&b records [Louis Jordan and Dinah Washington] and that's how I got interested in music.\" His mother worked at Flash Record Store at Western and Jefferson.\n\nGardner, Jay: KHJ, 1984-85; KRTH, 1985-90; KCBS/fm, 2002-04; KRTH, 2006-15.

He's also been the voice of CBS/TV.\n\nFollowing their years together at MTV, Garland and Robert W. Pittman co-founded Quantum Media, launching a music company and television properties such as The Morton Downey Jr. Show and Streets, television’s first reality cop show.\n\nDuring the prime years of contemporary music radio, Les programmed KELI-Tulsa, WRKO-Boston, K-100 (KIQQ), and CKLW-Detroit, the Motor City’s Big 8. Discovered by pop radio producers Bill Drake and Paul Drew, Garland became a top radio programming executive.\n\nGarland was later picked by Doug Morris and Ahmet Ertegun to head up West Coast operations for Atlantic Records. During the 1980s, record-setting revenues were achieved through releases from Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones, Genesis, Abba, Aretha Franklin, Foreigner, The Spinners, Phil Collins and many other chart-topping recording artists. Additionally, Garland is a founding member of both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and The Academy of Digital Music Arts and Sciences.\n\nGARMAN, Ralph: KROQ, 1998-2017. Ralph was the entertainment guy on the morning KROQ Kevin & Bean show and a great contribution to the success of the show before he was unceremoiously let go. Originally hired to be the entertainment guy, he ended up doing bits, sketches and voices. He’s always wanted to act and because of the morning show, he met one of the producers of NYPD Blue resulting in playing a recurring role as a policeman for four seasons.\n\nRalph realized the biggest jump in his acting career – a movie starring Al Pacino.\n\nA career in radio was never on his radar screen while growing up in a Philadelphia suburb. His father worked the central part of the East Coast for the distribution arm of Paramount Pictures, which meant that he booked Paramount films. He graduated from LaSalle University and he was determined to get a Screen Actors Guild card before moving West to pursue his dream. He appeared in an ABC Afterschool Special that was filmed in Philadelphia, which resulted in SAG membership.\n\nSince 2018, Ralph hosts a five-day-a-week “The Ralph Report,” along with comedian Eddie Pence.\n\nGARNER, Anita: KBIG, 1984-88; KBLA, 1990-91. Anita's personal journey with preacher/singer parents is now a book called The Glory Road that was published in the spring of 2021.\n\nAnita was KBIG’s first full-time on-air female, hosting afternoon drive. With AM driver, Byron Paul, she also co-hosted MCA/Universal’s nationally syndicated “Great Starship.” After leaving KBIG, she wrote, produced and hosted “Something Special” for Media America. It was a weekend radio magazine, featuring celebrity interviews and lifestyle topics along with AC hits.\n\nAnita was “Lovely Nita” in the ‘70’s on KROY in Sacramento. “KROY was a rock powerhouse and I spent most of my time in production or going to contest-giveaway-public-appearances as ‘KROY’s Miss Money,’ but they’d occasionally throw me on the air in place of one of the guys, surprising the young girl groupies who pressed their faces [and more] against the control room window where their [male] deejay idols usually held forth.\"\n\nAnita grew up on the air, singing with her parents, who were evangelists and recording artists in the Deep South. “We were gospel gypsies, criss-crossing several Southern states, which is good training for a career in broadcasting.” She later owned an advertising agency in Northern California, working with a mix of retail, corporate and broadcast accounts, winning creative awards for writing and producing. As a voiceover, Anita has also represented many national, regional and local accounts. For a decade she was the voice of KCET/tv. As a writer for hire, she’s edited, “sweetened” and “doctored” for others. And now she has her own book.\n\n(Gillian and Goodfellas)\n\nGARNER, Blair: KIIS, 1992-93.

Blair left KIIS to concentrate on Country formatted-satellite services and the \"After MidNite Show\" (syndication canceled in 2020) under the name Blair Garner.\n\nIn the spring of 1997 he began hosting the syndicated “The Country Chart.”\n\nBorn in Canyon, Texas, a small town near Amarillo, Blair caught the broadcasting bug at an early age. The owner of Canyon’s only radio station who encouraged him to try his hand at broadcasting discovered him. During his college years, Blair worked at KAFM-Dallas, WASH-Washington, DC and Austin’s KHFI. After receiving his degree in advertising from the University of Texas, Blair joined KKBG-Houston. From there he went to WPLJ. His next stop was afternoons at KIIS. In addition to radio, Blair has a love affair with cars, owning and restoring over 50 of them. On Country music, Blair said: “This is the music I grew up with and have always been drawn to. It’s so exciting for me to be doing this show with all the music and artists I love!”\n\nGARR, Bill: KRKD, KNX, KIEV. Bill broadcast race results for Southern California radio stations for close to 40 years. He died March 28, 2015, at the age of 98.\n\nBorn and reared in San Francisco, Bill was the manager of the UC Davis radio station. After graduation, he became a newscaster in San Francisco. During the 1950s, Bill was a dj in Los Angeles until he began covering the thoroughbred racing circuit in 1959.\n\n“Bill had a gift for making a race come alive,” said a colleague, “so much so that your heart pounds as the field nears the finish line. Only the smell of the stables is missing when he’s on.”\n\nBill did an old fashioned, easy paced program about horse racing where he would call the races and give the results at the end of the day. Bill also hosted “Call About Racing,” which aired on weekend mornings. His morning show included scratches, interviews, plus calls and results.\n\nGarr had been retired for years and had been in poor health, preventing him from coming to the track he loved most, Santa Anita, according to a story in the Daily Racing Form.\n\nGarr’s first live show from Santa Anita was broadcast on December 26, 1959. For nearly four decades, he broadcast his show – a forerunner of today’s racing shows – from Santa Anita, Hollywood Park, and Del Mar. He also worked on local racing telecasts in the 1960s.\n\nIn addition to his exhaustive broadcast schedule, Garr was known for some of the corniest jokes at the racetrack, ones in which he took great delight in telling if only to see the reaction of his audience.\n\nHe’d remind you to have a hot dog, because you were “guaranteed to have a weiner.” After watching a horse named Forty Winks win, he called the horse “a real sleeper.” When Jerry Bailey was riding, he’d ask, “If Barnum runs a horse does he have to put Bailey on him?”\n\nGarrett, Keli: KORG, 1978-80; KUTE, 1980-87; KXEZ, 1990-93; KACE, 1990-93.

He left the Southland to program an Oldies station in Salinas.\n\nIn 1998 he was the image voice at KBIG.\n\nGARROWAY, Dave: KFI, 1970-71. Dave was part of a historic day in tv. In early 1952 NBC opened a broadcast with a shot of Dave looking outside through the \"Window on the World\" in New York City. The Today show was the first that featured his signature sign-off with hand raised, uttering one word, \"Peace.\" He hosted the show from 1952 to 1961. He was acclaimed for his calm, understated manner. His thick-rimmed glasses gave a whole generation of imitators that owlish look.\n\nHis broadcast career began shortly after he got his college degree from Washington University in St. Louis where he majored in abnormal psychology. He was visiting New York City in 1937, as he told it, when \"some gal got me drunk and I woke up next morning as an NBC page.\" He spent many years at WMAQ-Chicago. After his wife died a tragic death by jumping from a building in 1961, he felt compelled to quit the Today show. He went on to do local radio and tv shows in Boston and then to KFI. Dave committed suicide on July 21, 1982, in Swarthmore, Pennsylvania. He was 69.\n\nGarver, Gary: KLSX, 1993-2006. Gary worked production and hosted a weekend show, \"The Single Life\" at KLSX until the Spring of 2006. He now hosts a syndicated radio talk show that is televised live at RockMeTv.com. He's also business manager at KCAA-Inland Empire.\n\nGARZA, Erika: KRTH, 2005; KLAX, 2006-08 and 2015-17. Erika joined Hollywood Hamilton as co-host of the morning K-EARTH show in February 2005 and left a month later. She worked twice at LaRaza 97.9/fm.\n\nErika is a Mexican-American, multi-facet, bilingual, bicultural journalist. She began her career in 1997 in news at Univision Fresno, later worked at ABC-Bakersfield and CBS Radio. In 2003, Erika moved to Los Angeles and transferred into entertainment on radio and television. In entertainment, Erika hosted national tv shows for Univision, Telemundo, TV Azteca, LATV and Mun2. She has hosted dozens of live events and award shows such as the red carpet of Latin Billboards, Fiesta Broadway, Fiestas Patrias, Premios de la Calle and Premios Los Angeles.\n\nIn 2017 she was active in an effort to bring SAG-AFTRA union to Spanish Broadcasting System (owner of KLAX). She was terminated by La Raza during an on-air commercial break from her show, according to the LA Weekly. “I was given no reason. They said they wanted to exercise their right to do it.” Garza said the union drive gathered steam in part because young on-air personalities with hit shows at the station allegedly were being paid less than minimum wage. “Some of my co-workers are 21 years old. [The station is] No. 1 in the market, and [the co-workers] aren’t making money and don’t have medical coverage or anything like that.” Nine months after SAG-AFTRA accused SBS of numerous violations of labor laws, the two sides hammered out a nearly half-million dollar settlement.\n\nGarza thanked those that spoke out on their behalf. “We hope our experience inspires those living in the shadows to step up,” Garza said.\n\nGarza, Joaquin: KLAX, 2000-10. \"El Chulo\" joined KLAX from the Z Spanish Network. Since 2010, Fiesta 97.1 is a radio station that focuses on the Hispanic Population in Austin, Texas and its Metropolitan Area. “El Chulo de la Manana” is the most important program of the radio.\n\nGarza, Pepe: KBUE, 2004-06.

Yolanda hosted a talk show on “the Zone” (KTZN) until the late summer of 1997 when a format switch to “Disney Radio” occurred. She left the station when it was KMPC in late 1996 and rejoined the Talk facility in early 1997. Yolanda is an attorney and the first African American woman talk show host on KABC. She left the station to become the midday host on KLIF-Dallas on January 6, 1999.\n\nIn 2003, Yolanda moved to Washington, DC and began hosting a show (Love & Money) on XM satellite radio. She left XM in 2006 to start Gaskins Media Works, a strategic communications firm. Yolanda is an honors graduate of Lincoln University in Pennsylvania and Georgetown University Law School.\n\nIn a profile in the LA Times, Yolanda related how she became interested in broadcasting. It was when she was 7, on the back porch of her grandmother’s house in Washington, where she grew up, and was inspired seeing Leslie Uggams, one of the first African American woman on tv. Yolanda was also profiled in O Magazine (April 2005.) Yolanda began work in television as co-host of PM Magazine on the Fox station in Washington and then became talent/senior producer for Black Entertainment Television. She moved to Miami to become Entertainment Reporter for the NBC affiliate in Miami.\n\nWhile at KABC, Yolanda began making appearances on CNN as a commentator and in 1993 became the first African American woman to become a show host/news anchor on a cable news network.

They provided unique coverage of the annual Pasadena Rose Parade to listeners of KPCC. They have over 20,000 old radio shows in their collection and \"a ton of interviews.\"\n\n\"Same Time, Same Station began as a documentary program in 1971 and lasted until 1973. It was produced by KRLA. Much of the content for the show came from the archives of the Pacific Pioneer broadcasters in Hollywood. In 1980 Woody Schultz from KPCC Pasadena launched another version of the show. He played old radio shows weekly. John and I appeared many times during that year as guests. When Woody decided to move to Arizona, he asked John and I to take the producing and hosting chores. We began the show in October of 1980. It lasted on KPCC until February 2000. They are currently heard on the Internet.\n\nGATES\n\n, Daryl: KFI, 1992-94. The LA Police Chief died April 16, 2010. He was 83. “Controversial” snaked its way throughout the three-page profile of his life in the LA Times obit, much of it centered on the tumultuous years as Los Angeles Police Chief from 1978-92. But this story begins where his police career ends.\n\nIn early 1992, there was a sea of voices calling for Gates to step down. A 50,000-watt voice, KFI, loudly led the charge along with the LA Times. Talk show hosts were merciless in their frustration with Gates and demanded his resignation. The day after Gates announced that he was stepping down; KFI’s pd David G. Hall stepped up with an offer to host a daily show at KFI. “I knew in a million years there was no way he was going to take my phone call so I sent him a fax. I suggested to him that instead of constantly being a 10-second sound bite, he could have a full four hours to do with what he wanted.”\n\nHall was shocked with a return fax saying Gates was interested. “We met and made a deal.” Hall was a relatively new program director in 1992, just two years on the job. He had just let another controversial figure, Tom Leykis, go from afternoons and was planning to bring in John & Ken from a successful run in New Jersey. It was a timing issue for Hall. He knew that Leykis’ supporters would take out their rage about losing him on the new guys, John & Ken, so David needed a bridge, a program to separate the end of Leykis and beginning of John & Ken. Enter Daryl Gates.\n\n“I knew we would have an unbelievable cume with Daryl Gates,” said Hall, “and there would be people waiting to hear him and what he was going to say. This gave me a honeymoon period to work on his talk show skills. When we made the deal it was for afternoon drive for 3-4 months and then he would move to 7 p.m. – 9 p.m. Gates told me that when it came to law enforcement he was the expert and I was the idiot but when it came to doing a talk show, he was the idiot and I was the expert. He told me to never hold back on giving advice. He said he wanted to be a sponge because he didn’t want to go on the air and embarrass himself. I could sit with him and he would take notes.”\n\n“I’ll tell you one thing he didn’t like,” said his original producer, Marc Germain. “It was racist jokes. From time to time people thought that was a way to ingratiate themselves into the conversation and he wouldn’t crack a smile. You could tell he was kind of insulted by it. He was not the guy that some media portrayed, that sense of white versus them. He was not in any way, shape or form a Klan member, white supremacist or anything like that. He was completely the opposite. Another behavior that people might be surprised about is that the Chief used to drive through the worst parts of town and he was greeted like a returning king. They loved him. The idea that he was somehow hated and vilified just wasn’t true.”\n\nGates admitted that it was pretty sweet to be on KFI, a station that once called for his resignation. The honeymoon period and perhaps novelty of having the embattled police chief as a talk show host came to an unhappy end. Perhaps like when Kato Kaelin and Susan Olsen (Brady Bunch) talked out their celebrity status at KLSX, there was nothing more for the Chief to talk about and his contract was not renewed.\n\nGates, Gene: KZLA, 2000. SEE Gene & Julie\n\nGates, Kelli: KLYY, 1997-98; KLOS, 1998-2012. Kelli was part of the morning team at KLOS, until late summer of 2012 when Mark & Brian left after 25 years.

She is now a news anchor with KSL-Salt Lake City.\n\nAfter a radio career in the biggest markets in the country, Mary Ellen has experienced some major adjustments in both her outlook on life and her day-to-day mindset. “I had to change my whole way of thinking when I got off the hamster wheel. I’ve started working on a second book. I sing in small jazz clubs, in fact, I communicate with my father through singing. And I have no money but I am happy. It is a different kind of life. I am on the cusp here that if I don’t get another book deal.\n\n\"Ken Beck trained me and he was such a wonderful mentor. Without Ken Beck I wouldn’t be here. I don’t think any of the wonderful things would have happened to me in radio if he didn’t take me under his wing. Coming from Michigan I had no idea what I was doing and he just saw potential in me. He was the best. I followed him to KGO and he just taught me so much and had incredible patience. I feel so incredibly fortunate to have begun my radio career with Ken Beck at the helm.”\n\nGeller, Andy: KODJ, 1989; KLOS; KSWD, 2015. Andy has an active voiceover career and does promos for network tv. In the summer of 2015, he joined KSWD (100.3/The Sound) for fill-in.\n\nGELLER, Valerie: KFI/KOST, 1988-90. Valerie is the author of Creating Powerful Radio and Beyond Powerful Radio, the books that have become the bible for all programming and station execs. She travels the world consulting stations that emphasize news, talk, information, and personality radio.\n\nValerie has a love affair with radio, not just any old Talk Radio, but compelling Radio. For decades she has been part of major broadcast seminars and conventions. The former program director at WABC-New York and executive producer at KFI/KOST explained one of strategies of compelling radio in an LARadio essay:\n\nUse \"YOU.\" If there was a magic word to guarantee you could get the attention of a listener would you use it? Of course. And there is such a word. Radio's Magic Word is: \"YOU.\" Always talk to the individual. Of course, logically and intellectually you know that when you are talking on the radio you are in reality, talking to more than one person, but on the radio, the magic, the connection, the power of radio, is based on the feeling of intimacy between the presenter on air and each individual person listening. It never works as well on radio to talk to all those \"folks\" or \"People out there listening\" or \"all of you...\" USING YOU instead of \"I.\" Whenever you can, always try to talk to one individual. If you use YOU instead of We-I-Me or Us, listeners feel the deeper, and true connection. Think of the difference, \"I have tickets to give away\" or \"You can win tickets.\"\n\nAnd it's not just radio. A few weeks ago, I went looking at houses with a friend who has just had twins and they need more space. The realtor said: \"Now, this would be your kitchen over here. Your bedrooms are upstairs, the guest room is in the back. Now, you could knock out this wall and make this an open plan. Your garden would be here, in the back...\" This REALLY REALLY works. It may take a little time to get it, but it is worth the effort, as long as you have patience, and understand that as human beings, it is hard to change old habits. Perhaps you are familiar with the work of Australian based brain researcher Dr. Evian Gordon? (www.brainresource.com) If so, you may already know that according to the research, it takes a 1000 times of repeated behavior before you rewire your brain to change a habit, so KEEP TRYING. I have a stack of bright yellow \"post-it\" notes. They are everywhere and have the word YOU on them. It helps.\n\nGene & Julie: KZLA, 2000. Gene Gates & Julie Jacobson spent 8 years working at KVIL-Dallas until exiting in late 2012. They own an Italian restaurant in Dallas.\n\nGENTRI, John, KHJ, 1965. John was at KHJ just before \"Boss Radio\" and left before the \"Boss Jocks\" arrived. After leaving radio, John went on to write, produce and direct documentaries for KNBC/Channel 4. He won the Emmy for best documentary for “Whatever Happened to Hollywood?” Nearly every one of his documentaries were nominated for the Emmy or won other achievement awards. John also starred in his own talk show in the late 60’s called “Boutique.” With all seven of his children in tow, he received a master’s of communications from Loyola University in Los Angeles.\n\nA firm believer in education, he continued to work on his PhD until his health forced him to move his family to Connecticut. There he began writing a book and returned to host his radio show at WGCH in Greenwich. He began his company, Deltri Media and developed numerous programs for the American Heart Association. In July of 1976 at the age of 48, John passed away from a massive heart attack. A devout Catholic, he never liked the idea of ‘passing away’ but much preferred the term “temporarily interrupted.” John was a one-of-a-kind human being. He had a hilarious sense of humor, incredible intellect, and sparkling blue eyes and was completely devoted to his family. He loved his “Dear hearts and Gentri People,” and they loved him. He is greatly missed by his children, his 20 grandchildren and 3 great-grandchildren.\n\nGeorge told the Los Angeles Times in 1984 that fans saw him as a \"down-to-earth guy who's speaking not so much from a highly intelligent brain but who's speaking from his heart and gut. They say that I'm a lunatic, that I'm a maniac, but why do you have to smile at your guests and be nice and let them say what they want to say?\"\n\nBorn George Walter Pearch in Oakland to a former vaudeville actress and the owner of a shipping company, George moved to Hollywood with his mother and at age 14 became a disc jockey with KIEV.

She is is president/producer of Savannah Films.\n\nGERMAIN, Ann: KFI, 1989-93; KEZY; KIEV; KFWB, 1999. Ann was a news anchor at KFI.\n\nBorn in Southampton, New York, on December 3, 1966, she was raised in Calverton, New York. Ann landed her first job in radio as a part-time dj and production engineer at age 17 after first interning at WRIV/AM in Riverhead, New York. While attending Syracuse University (1985-’88), she spent summer holidays working at WBAZ/fm in Southold, New York. Ann graduated from Syracuse with a B.S. degree in broadcast journalism at the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications in December of 1988. Following graduation, she moved to California and landed a job as a tv production assistant at KCOY/TV in Santa Maria. In 1989 she was hired by KFI/KOST to work for both the news and programming departments. In March of 1990 she was promoted to KFI operations coordinator, but continued to work as a fill-in news anchor/reporter. While at KFI, she met and married Marc Germain (a.k.a. Mr. KFI, then Mr. KABC). In 1993 she joined Air Traffic Communications in Santa Ana as a traffic reporter, news writer and anchor, broadcasting on a number of Southland stations including KEZY and KIK/FM. “In 1997, I bowed out of radio life to become a stay-at-home mom to two children.” She joined KFWB in 1999 as a part-time writer.\n\nGERMAIN, Marc: KFI, 1992-96; KABC, 1997; KTLK, 2007. Marc worked afternoon drive at K-TALK until late 2007. He was formerly Mr. KFI and Mr. KABC. He now broadcasts at TalkRadioOne.com.\n\nFirst introduced to local audiences as “Mr. KFI,” then renamed as “Mr. KABC,” Marc finally used his own name on the air, though sometimes referring to himself as “Mr. K” while on KTLK. When he left KTLK, he said, \"I understand how business works. I appreciate that radio is focused on cutting costs right now. But, I worry about what's being cut along with costs: character, originality and individuality – the very heart of what makes radio great. Reducing all of radio to a handful of voices really is the opposite of what the audience is asking for. It shouldn't be a surprise to anyone who thinks clearly why audiences are shrinking. The growth of podcasting demonstrates that people are hungry for more points of view, not fewer. What encourages me is the belief that there are still people in this industry who want to restore radio, not decimate it. I want to believe that the pendulum will swing the other way, and companies will start working to make radio a more dimensional and exciting experience that will deliver big audiences for advertisers. And I want to believe that will happen soon, because technology is enabling us to make our own entertainment if as consumers we aren't getting what we want from traditional media outlets.\"\n\nGERARD, Nick: KSUR, 2003-04; KKJZ, 2008. Nick worked morning drive at Adult Standards, \"K-Surf\" until a format change in the summer of 2004. He's now hosting Nothing But the Blues at K-Jazz.\n\n\"My decades-long obsession with radio began at age ten,\" wrote Nick. \"When I’m on the air today, I still experience the same wonderful thrill I did in my first on-air job at age 17. In fact, it’s better, because I’m far more sure of myself behind the mic than I was back in the early years. I would have, however, managed my career differently. I’d have made career decisions based on my strengths: on-air performance and production. Instead, I took some detours into medium-market pd positions. I also hit the streets as a radio AE for five years. I learned much and had some success in these jobs, but personally speaking, for pure, exhilarating professional satisfaction nothing beats the euphoric rush of a good day on the air! LThirty-five years into it, I’m thrilled to be here. With all that’s happening, why would a radio pig like me do anything else?\"\n\nGERSHAN, Kevin: KIQQ, 1974; KMPC, 1975; KMGG, 1983-84; KQLZ, 1985; KRTH, 1992-98.

It was shaking uncontrollably. I wouldn’t have an answer for my son for seven months when I was diagnosed. “My symptoms were a disparate collection annoyances; a shuffling, foot-dragging walk, tremors in my arm, loss of coordination and balance, and difficulties speaking, sleeping and focusing sometimes. I never linked the symptoms as one thing. I assumed I was tired or my shoes were too heavy, or I was just out of shape. By the time I was diagnosed, I probably had been battling the disease for a decade. Symptoms began appearing three or four years ago, and through those undiagnosed years, doctors tell me I lost approximately eight per cent of my brain cells.”\n\nLarry says he and his family create new memories each day that he hopes aren’t stolen by Parkinson’s.\n\nGilbert, Jack: KMPC, 1965; KGIL, 1966.

My senior year of college at CSUF I took a radio class as an elective and ended up interning at 99.1 KGGI. That internship really propelled my interest in radio to the next level. Shortly after my internship, I was offered a position on the street team where I learned SO much. I loved working on the street team because the interaction with our listeners was constant. After doing street team for some time I was given the opportunity to learn how to run boards which were super exciting but also slightly daunting because the pressure was on.\"\n\nTwo years later, she was offered a board-op job at sister station, KIIS. This led to an opportunity to produce the afternoon show. \"The biggest struggle for me was balancing my finances all while trying to chase this dream of being on the radio and learning how to dj. I don’t come from a silver spoon, so my parents were never really able to help me financially (even if they wanted to). I took on some debt when I first started interning because I left my job working at the Four Seasons so that I can fully dedicate my time to the radio. In retrospect, I think I should have been a little wiser, but you live, and you learn right?\n\nGonzalez, Amalia: KSKQ; KHJ; KTNQ; KRCD/KRCV. Amalia is program director at \"Recuerdo\" KRCD/KRCV.

His wife, voiceover artist and former news and traffic reporter Tammy Schroeder wrote: “I've tried to find the right words to post on Steve's Facebook page for three days now. Steve's battle with brain cancer was tough to say the least, yet he never once complained or said ‘Why me?’ He lived every moment to the fullest and he cherished every day he was able to spend with his 4 children and 10 (soon to be 11) grandchildren.”\n\nTammy continued: “As the day drew near for him to meet his Savior, he told me he was ready. He was so excited he would be able to see again! Relapsing Polychondritis, blindness and brain cancer, none of these health challenges ruffled his feathers or got him down. When I asked him why he never complained, he laughed and said it wouldn't change anything so why make everyone else miserable.”\n\nSteve was unable to speak since July 26th because of how the cancer affected the speech part of his brain. “One of the last things I heard him say was ‘Lord! Please take care of my children!’ And that says it all,” said Tammy.\n\nA celebration of life will be held Sunday, October 1, at 5:30 p.m. at Lake Avenue Church, Pasadena. He will be buried with military honors Monday, October 2nd at noon, at Riverside National Cemetery.\n\nDiana Kirchen Kelly wrote “Many of us fondly remember Steve Gonzales, ‘Steven G’ from KWIZ/fm and then KWIZ-AM. He was funny and talented. Steven Gonzalez will be missed.\n\nSteve Kindred wrote: “I've lost a great friend and terrific LARP. Steve and I were fierce competitors covering some of the biggest stories of the last two decades. He was always objective and a straight shooter when it came to getting a story quickly and correctly. He was also a terrific family man, and a strong Marine who fought his disease fiercely right up to the end.”\n\nGONZALO, Melissa: KFI, 2012-15.

His work has earned him numerous industry awards. In December, 1960, Jon graduated from the two-year course, with a first class FCC license, of the Don Martin School of Radio & TV Arts & Sciences on Cherokee at Hollywood Blvd. He had been working nights as an ABC Messenger for about a year and was looking for a tv studio camera job.\n\nThings changed in February 1961. As Jon tells the story, “The resumes were going out, the replies were not coming in. Late on a Wednesday night, a call came into work for me from Russ White, the program director at 5000 watt, KIMA-Yakima, Washington. On the recommendation of The Real Don Steele, White offered me an-on-air job as a Top 40 dj for $100 a week. White said that no resume, no audition, no air-check from school were necessary. Steele's word was enough for him. Steele and I had been at Martin's together, where he was a student and taught electronic theory. The only catch was, I had to be in Yakima Monday morning if I wanted the position. I said yes, quit my messenger job, my wife Donna and I sold and gave away what we couldn't jam into a small U-Haul trailer and we were off for Yakima, arriving Sunday afternoon. I spent nearly two years at KIMA where I found out I was not destined to be a dj.”\n\nJon then spent the next three-and-a-half years at middle-of-the-road 5000 Watt KERG in Eugene, Oregon where he became a stringer for KNX.

In 1973, she was nominated for DJ of the Year. Her voice work included Gidget in an animated ABC/TV movie and NBC/TV's Inch High Private Eye.
