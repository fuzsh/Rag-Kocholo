        "text": "The hosts and judges for Miss USA 2024 have been announced. And some familiar faces from reality television will be front and center for the competition. Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Garcelle Beauvais will be hosting, and Scheana Shay from Vanderpump Rules will be taking a seat at the judges’ table. Read on for all the details.\n\nMiss USA 2024 hosts and judges include Scheana Shay and Garcelle Beauvais\n\nUS Weekly reported that Garcelle and E! News star Keltie Knight will serve as hosts of the Miss USA pageant. The duo will host the live competition from the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles on Sunday, August 4. The show, which will air on the CW, hasn’t been held in Los Angeles in almost 20 years.\n\nEach state will have a contestant competing to be crowned Miss USA 2024. And then Miss USA will compete at the Miss Universe 2024 pageant. Listen, I’m all about a tiara.\n\nMeanwhile, judges for Miss USA include Anastasia Soare, who is the CEO of Anastasia Beverly Hills, and Scheana. NJ Falk, who is the managing partner of Athletic Propulsion Labs (APL), will also judge along with Miss USA 1990 Carole Gist. Natasha Graziano, who is a motivational speaker, rounds out the judging panel. That is an interesting mix. I’m glad that Scheana is branching out, especially with the uncertain future of Pump Rules.\n\nBefore this event kicks off, Miss Teen USA 2024 will be selected on Thursday, August 1. E! News host Justin Sylvester and The Bachelorette star Rachel Lindsay will handle hosting duties. Among the judges is Miss Teen USA 2019 Kaliegh Garris, actress Francia Raísa, and Shree Saini, who is a model. Rounding out the judges is Dancing with the Stars pro-Rylee Arnold and Alyssa Carson, who is an influencer.\n\nMiss Teen USA 2024 airs on Thursday, August 1 on The CW at 8 p.m. ET. Then you can catch Miss USA 2024 on Sunday, August 4, on The CW at 8 p.m. ET."
