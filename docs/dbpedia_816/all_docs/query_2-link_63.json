        "text": "Invited to close the November 4, 2001 53rd Annual Primetime Emmy Awards at L.A.'s Shubert Theatre with “You'll Never Walk Alone,” Rodgers & Hammerstein's inspirational song from their musical Carousel, Barbra Streisand surprised the theater and television audience in the show's closing moments with a thoroughly stirring rendition. The finale segment, introduced by host Ellen DeGeneres, began with the camera focusing on a dimly lit stage adorned with candles and wall of names for those who perished on September 11th. In silhouette, facing the names, Barbra sang, “When you walk through a storm, hold your head up high and don't be afraid of the dark.” Turning to face the already appreciative audience and spotlight it was indeed Barbra continuing her emotional performance, backed by a choir on stage. A rousing climax and poignant ending saw Barbra turning back to the wall of names before receiving a standing ovation as the house lights brightened the theater.\n\nBarbra had rehearsed the David Foster-arranged number throughout the week and again on stage around midnight the Friday before. In fact, she requested that more camera time be spent on the wall of names and less on her. Immediately after the performance, she admitted being nervous to Entertainment Tonight's Mary Hart backstage. “But I love the message of the song. We're all slightly afraid, aren't we?” Inspired by America, Barbra observed, “We at least are united as a people. It's wonderful to feel so much brotherhood...”\n\nAfter the telecast, in the Chinese restaurant-turned-into-media center across the street, carrying the Emmy won earlier in the evening for Timeless, Barbra chatted with reporters about what brought her to perform in front of a live TV audience again.\n\n“I was focused on my song and my stage fright,” Barbra told reporters about her surprise performance. “I kept thinking, 'How am I going to stop my voice from trembling?' A performance like that with an orchestra takes a lot of work, and we didn't get enough rehearsal. You don't just show up and sing. The song was my priority. I was there to give something, not get something.”\n\nOn the cable entertainment channel E!, Barbra confirmed that “You'll Never Walk Alone” was the producers' suggestion, and she “couldn't have thought of a better choice” considering the current situation in this country. Asked whether it was difficult to sing on the show, Barbra said, “It's always difficult for me to sing...but there's a sense of purpose.” She explained that since September 11th, particularly having not been asked to join the first televised tribute, she had felt compelled to perform in a patriotic spirit for the nation. Barbra humbly said, “This is just my little way of doing something because I don't enjoy public singing.” In fact, Barbra hadn't intended to attend the Emmys until just recently, having decided “never to do this again” following her 1995 multiple-Emmy wins for Barbra Streisand: The Concert. “I didn't want to go to another award ceremony to compete against my fellow professionals.” But, this year was different. “I'm just grateful we live in a country where we're allowed to sing and have music and express ourselves and our emotions. It's a very sad time in our history, a frightening time, and I wanted to give something back to the people and our country.” Regarding the country's fears regarding terrorism and her own performance anxiety (including a dry throat remaining from the flu), Barbra turned it into a positive. “We need to let our fear make us into better people somehow. Tonight actually had a purpose, so I was a little less afraid actually. It was good that those of us who could came out to honor our profession and make a statement that we go on through our fear.”\n\nShe had never performed on an Emmy Awards show, and she last sang for an audience on September 28, 2000 at Madison Square Garden. Her previous live TV performance (actually live to tape) was on ABC 2000 from her Millennium Eve concert in Las Vegas. For Barbra, singing for America was what this night was primarily about, not making sure to arrive in time perhaps to accept an award. Publicist Dick Guttman subsequently explained that she was driving to the theatre when her award was announced. To Extra's Leeza Gibbons, Barbra said, “I came to give a message in song and be part of the patriotism that is overwhelming the country in a positive way.” Of the September 11th events, she reflected, “As they say, we will never forget. This is something that we will live with the rest of our lives.” She acknowledged valuing her time at home with husband James Brolin (who escorted her to the theater, post-show Unity Dinner, and Trader Vic's West Wing party). “I think we have come to a different kind of consciousness, that we really take the time to smell the flowers and treat each other a little more respectfully and feel the power of love. The power of love is stronger than death.” She told Gibbons, “Every day is a blessing. Every day is a gift — the gift of life.”"
