        "text": "The Council on Foreign Relations has given rise to its own mythology, attracting attacks from both Right and Left in American politics as an example of the ability of anti-democratic, elitist groups to set governmental policy. Robert D. Schulzinger, Michael Wala, and Inderjeet Parmar have also studied the Council’s role and influence upon American foreign affairs. Their works largely concentrate upon the period from approximately 1940 onwards, when the United States began to take an increasingly important part in world affairs, and upon the Council’s contribution to its country’s international transformation. This essay focuses on the Council’s earlier interwar activities, in the fifteen or twenty years after its foundation, and in particular upon its impact upon Anglo-American relations. In recent years historians have drawn attention to the development between the wars among certain sections of the foreign-policy elite in both Britain and the United States of sentiments in favour of closer Anglo-American relations. This essay suggests that the roots of the transformation in American international policies, most notably the dedication and commitment with which the United States government supported the Allies, especially Britain, during the Second World War, owed something to the Council’s previous efforts to improve Anglo-American relations.\n\nThe current dissertation aims to analyse the evolution of the US-UK \"special relationship\" from 1945 to the present day, focusing on the impact of systemic and intra-systemic changes. Methodologically, the \"special relationship\" is traced through the structural influences of the international system, and a comparative examination is conducted to determine the extent to which systemic changes, such as the transition from a bipolar system during the Cold War to a unipolar system after the end of the Cold War, and intra-systemic changes, such as the Iraq war, Brexit, and the AUKUS security agreement, have influenced the \"special relationship.\" The Anglo-American theme is explored in three chapters, taking into account the history of the relationship and its development. The first chapter provides an overview of Anglo-American relations and the political-historical background of the two countries. The second chapter examines the origins and development of the \"special relationship,\" including its evolution and adaptation to meet the challenges of the Cold War. The third chapter assesses the evolution of the \"special relationship\" with a focus on key events and its relevance in the present day. Despite various international and domestic challenges, the \"special relationship\" between the UK and the US remains a significant factor in international relations and has played a central role in shaping the global order.

The American perspective of the Vietnam War is voluminous in the historiography, which is understandable given the distressing experience the War had on US domestic politics. Yet, analysis of the British perspective has been much more limited, with only a handful of major studies specifically focusing on the Anglo-American relationship in the context of the Vietnam War, with Peter Busch and Sylvia Ellis making notable contributions to the subject. This study will attempt to add to our current historical understanding of Britain’s involvement in the Vietnam War by taking a thematic approach in analysing the balancing act of the major issues facing Britain with the demands of the Anglo-American ‘special relationship’ in Vietnam between 1960 and 1968, based primarily on previously unused archival sources and existing memoirs. The period starts at the end of Eisenhower’s tenure, when escalation begins in earnest, and finishes at the start of 1968, when the Vietnam War reaches its peak in the Tet Offensive. Much of the historical literature on Anglo-American relations, in the context of British foreign policy towards Vietnam, either mentions Vietnam in passing, isolates Vietnam from other foreign policy considerations, or has a narrow focus. There are currently no thematic studies which assess British foreign policy towards Vietnam, in the context of the special relationship, and its wider effects from 1960 to 1968. This study aims to serve as a bridging of the gap in historical understanding of this period.\n\nWoodrow Wilson saw the League of Nations as the embryo of a fuller global polity. To illuminate his vision, this essay turns to Wilson’s elaborate theories of how national polities develop. The result significantly revises prevailing portrayals of Wilsonianism, both scholarly and popular. They emphasize Wilson’s determination either to spread liberal democracy abroad or to support international law and organization. On both counts, however, Wilson’s principles and actions betrayed deep ambiguities. Mixing Burkean organicism with a loosely neo-Hegelian teleology, Wilsonianism was a capacious set of ideas that, on principle, could and did cut either way on whether to implant democracy by force of arms. It gave Wilson a particular conception of liberal democracy, one that challenges Wilson’s reputation as a champion of the rule of “global public opinion.” Wilson meant “public opinion” non-literally. Statesmen in the League were supposed to divine the latent general will of international society through introspection, not to obey momentary mass preferences. Nor was Wilson the wholehearted advocate of binding international institutions that he might seem. His progressive, teleological vision allowed him to skate over the tensions between unilateralism and multilateralism, national interests and common concerns. Rather than decisively prioritize one value over the other, Wilson assumed there was no need, for national and common interests would draw ever nearer to one another. Moreover, Wilson in 1919 rejected popular proposals to strengthen the League’s commitments to international law and collective security. He did so to preserve the League as a flexible and thus formally weak organization that would constantly remold itself around an organically growing world spirit. In sum, Wilsonianism is unintelligible except by understanding the categories Wilson employed himself. His assumptions are so unlike those currently popular in international-relations discourse that it is difficult to apply Wilsonianism to present dilemmas."
