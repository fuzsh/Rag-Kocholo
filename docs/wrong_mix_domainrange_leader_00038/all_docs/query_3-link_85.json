        "text": "There are calls to create a statue of Harold Wilson in Westminster on the centenary of his birth.\n\nLord Wilson, who died in 1995, was prime minister for eight years in two separate spells in the 1960s and 70s.\n\nWhile there are full-length statues of other 20th Century prime ministers in Westminster, there is only a bronze bust of Lord Wilson, supporters said.\n\nA House of Commons spokesperson said there were no plans to commission a full-length statue.\n\nThe figure of the former Labour Prime Minister already welcomes travellers to Huddersfield from a plinth in the square by the town's railway station.\n\nHuyton, on Merseyside, where he served as the local MP for more than 30 years, hosts a second statue in his honour.\n\nDespite these two bronze monuments, some believe another should exist in the Parliament building where he dominated the stage for so many years.\n\nVeteran Labour MP for Huddersfield Barry Sheerman said the bronze bust depicting Lord Wilson was \"relatively small\" compared to a statue of Margaret Thatcher.\n\n\"It is time to give him the credit he deserves as the man who won four General Elections and brought politics and the country into the 1960s,\" he said.\n\n\"Amongst many other things his policies created the Open University and reformed capital punishment and homosexuality.\""
