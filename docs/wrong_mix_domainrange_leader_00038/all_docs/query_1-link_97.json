Under .)resont British cur -coley nnd banking control, It oeemo decidedly ill-advised for our organn.intiOn to Indulge in the ttrohacto of British currency below the legal rate or exchange and to run the attendant risk of sending that eur- reney into the country by pouch. It should ho recognized that the Speeisl Panda accounto whieh are now hold it my Mutt for our organization Also registored socounts and as ouch are subjeet to n eertsin amount of ocrutiny by the DritiOh Treasury and Poreign txehange Control. Therefore it to reasonable to assume thnt tiny largo mountii of cash in my possession not directly ehargoable tn those aceounto could Oautie ua considerable embarrassment. Currency above denominations of 10 does not now circulate legally in thio country, fact witch Oolonol Rehm has recog- nized in his advice to mo to dispose of the t100 notes \"with discretion\".

For me when a country loses any part of her sovereignty she is no more a nation. I would rather take the chance on losing the country completely�seeing it sunk, wrecked�my family lost, my fortune ruined, than to try to save her existence by losing part of her independent individuality by linking with a federation of countries-- identifying herself as a part of a group--or by becoming an economic semi-colony, taking her cue on how to trade or produce from a big power. Let her be invaded, and go down, fighting with honor. Let her perish from the face of the earth. But never for a minute should she, through fright and desire of protection or for the convenience of a big power, give up one inch of her sovereignty.\" He went on to say that the very word federation meant giving up one's complete liberty to the common need for coming to common decisions and therefore means loss of complete liberty in selC rule. Any plan of action made for all has to include compromises from everyone. since twenty nations of such varied types cannot live exactly by each other's method�it would have to be a general melange of everything, and then none would be free to use exactly his own particular methods of governing and trade. \"Argentina can only exist as a nation by standing alone,\" he said. \"She loses her identity as a nation by connecting up with federations or submitting to a big power. If she's taken by force she at least sinks honestly. She must, to stand alone, fortify herself internally. We've got to find a way�economically somehow When I arrived in Buenos Aires I found my old friend, Doctor Felipe Espil, Argentine Ambassador to the United States, who told me that he had been asked by his Foreign Office what Washington generally and the Adminis- tration in particular thought of his countrymen. \"I told them,\" said he, \"that the opinion generally held in the States was that the Argentines were Nazis.\" Last year I spent ten weeks in Argentina and visited many of the provinces of the country north of Tierra del Fuego.

Friction has devel- oped, and the diplomatic attitudes of both countries have reached the jittery stage. Our Ambassador to the Argentine, Norman Armour, is held in high esteem. Rs ability is well known to all, and his patience and under- standing have endeared him to the very sensitive, cultured and realistic people of Chile and Argentina. It is, of course, terribly disappointing to him that these two countries 'where he has served ss Ambassador are the only South American republics who have refused to join up in Western Hemisphere solidarity. While the Argentines respect Armour's ability and feel that he is honest with them, they distrust our other diplomatic officials, and a resentment has been growing ever since 1936, when the mission from this country concluded a visit to Buenos Aires by promising the Argentines they would purchase from them an amount of their beef equal to 2% of the cattle produced in the United States. Doctor Felipe A. Espil, the Argentine Ambassador to the United States, was called back to Buenos Aires early in August, at which time our Ambassador to the Argentine was on leave in this country. The Foreign Office felt Espil was not doling a good Job here, and had offered the post to a friend of mine, Dr. Angel Sanchez-Elfa , Sanchez-Ela is violently pro- British, and for this reason declined this offer and would decline any other post that was tendered him because he is not in sympathy with the policy of Rniz-Gui6azu. The post in Washington was then offered to Miguel Angel Car- can�, who is now Ambassador to England. Careen� was in Buenos Aires when I was there, having come for the wedding of his son. Both Espil and his wife broadcast generally that the Administration and people of Washington went out of their way to be rude to the staff of the Embassy here.

The Administration in Argentina make no attempt to deny that messages go out over the regular airways to the Axiu notions in code. Messagee also go out to the United Nations in code. They pro- claim, however, inasmuch as the representatives in our Stete Department find this to be the pot point on which they condemn their neutral stand, the Foreign Office is looking into the possibility of placing a ban on all code messages. I was told that Chile yearu ago adopted such a measure and they refer to this act as the precedent they would use as a basis should they adopt the plan they now have under consideration. Aside from this one point, they are unwilling to concede that the United Stat ee has any logical basis for criticizing their neutral stand. On numerous occasions I war reminded that the War had been in progress for twenty- eight months before we were attacked at Pearl Harbor; and that it was their considered opinion had it not been for this treacherous attack the United States would have remained neutral in this War. The Naval strength of Argentina is pathetic in comparison with the coast line they have to defend. The Military strength at present con- sists of 80,000 officere and men. As they have compulsory military train- ing, it would be poesible in a crisis to increase the strength of the Army up to around one million men, and the one thing Argentina is deter- mined to do is to put up a defense against any attempt to invade their land no matter who the foe may be. There are over two hundred thousand Germans living in the country, and I have given you a verbal report as the plan of action with respect to this colony ehould the Axis ever aLt Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/08/01 : CIA-RDP13X00001R000100470001-2 Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/08/01 : CIA-RDP13X00001R000100470001-2 The nost pathetic attempt to stir up a favorable emotional reac- tion is that which has been undertaken by the de Gaullists. In spite of the almost universal love of France which exists in Argentina, the \"Free French\" under the leadership of Bernard de Seiyes, have been able to accom- plish exactly nothing. De Seiyes I understand, in spite of the role he is enacting, still maintains his connections with the Textile industry in Lyons, and is still suspected of being one of the Directors of the Bank of France. Harold Horan scouted the last meeting of the de Gaullists, which he told me was depressing as to size and enthusiasm, and that the Jewish race accounted for over 90% of these present. The British LColony in Argentina is by far the most important. They own the railroads and furnish all the coal; they own the public utili- ties, the \"undergrounds\" in Buenos Aires--their real estate holdings are enormous and they provide a substantial portion of the money loaned on Estanci&s. They are extremely popular with the Argentines. Senora Santa- marina, wife of the President of the Bank of the Nation, told me frankly a year ago that the Argentines didn't mind having the British as their masters, but didn't believe they would relish a change. She went on to explain that the credit which the United States had extended to the Argentine consisting of 1116,000,000 was handed out so freely as to make them suspicious of What we might demand in return for it. I notice that our Under-Secretary of State announced last week that this credit .had been of it had ever been used.

In Argentina, in Chile and elsewhere I yea told that the British had indicated that they preferred to have those nations as neutrals rather than hooked to Western Hemisphere Solidarity. They see nothing to be gained in breaking off relations with the Axis. On the contrary, I am told, they find the situation \"ea is\" to be advantageous in many mays. This is a report, and I have tried to be an accurate and impartial reporter. For this reason I would like to have you check on what I dis- covered with reference to the British attitude toward the neutral position Chile and Argentina.

They wish to settle their affairs between themselves without help or obstacles from other countries.

The munitions of war sent in to Chungking are not sufficient in volume, and cannot ever be, to do more than keep CHina barely going. They are not sufficient to bring China victory over Japan. No heavy munitions are now going to Chungking from Russia.\" \"If war should come between Japan and the United States, it will be found that Siberia has been dangerously denuded of Russian troops. The Rostov offensive by the Russians was fought by twenty of the best divisions of the Siberian army, taken from vital Siberian points, to strengthen Timoshenko's army. japan will now have no difficulty in overwhelming the maritime area of Siberia if they decide to move there.
