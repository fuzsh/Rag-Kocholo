Ayakawa argued that American foreign and racial policies contradicted its democratic principles, publishing Jinshu mondai kenkyu (Study of the Race Question) in 1925 and other studies. (Sharon Minichiello, Japan's Competing Modernites: Issues in Culture and Democracy, 1900-1930 [Honolulu, 1930], 198; Sven Saaler and Christopher W. A.

After meeting free thinker Charles Bradlaugh and helping to found the Freethought Publishing Company, Besant and Bradlaugh decided to test Britain's obscenity law by reissuing Charles Knowlton's The Fruits of Philosophy (1877), a treatise advocating contraception, but both were eventually exonerated. In 1878 Besant published her own booklet, The Law of Population, which was notable for its up-to-date data on contraceptives, including pessaries, the Indian rubber cervical cap, and such spermicides as quinine (Vern L. Bullogh, ed., The Encyclopedia of Birth Control [Santa Barbara, Calif.: ABC-Clio, 2001], pp. 29-30).\n\nZelma Corning Brandt (1891-1990) was a publicist and literary agent with the firm of Brandt & Kirkpatrick, which had represented Sanger since 1921 (Social Security Death Index; Brandt & Kirkpatrick to Margaret Sanger, 22 August 1921, Reel 135, frame 88, Papers of Margaret Sanger, 1900-1966, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).\n\nGeorge Gordon Noel Byron, sixth Baron Byron (1788-1824), noted poet and symbol of 19th century Romanticism, and honored for his commitment to liberty and independence, was also known for his unorthodox, often scandalous private life (Oxford Dictionary of National Biography accessed November 10, 2009.)\n\nHarold Hannyngton Child (1869-1945), a British writer, poet, and drama critic.

Fielding (1886-1973), was a writer of books on psychology, sex and love, and one of the most successful writers and publishers of the Haldeman-Julius series of Little Blue Books, which eventually included Sanger's What Every Girl Should Know and What Every Mother Should Know. Sanger also read the manuscript of the birth control chapter in Fielding's Sanity in Sex, which was translated into Japanese in 1921 (Social Security Death Index; William J. Fielding, Sanity in Sex [New York: Dodd, Mead and Company, 1920], pp. xv-xvii; Newsday, 12 April 1966.)\n\nBenjamin Wilfred Fleisher (1870-1946), was the publisher and editor (1908-1940) of the Japan Advertiser, an English-language daily.

She married English-born missionary and University of Tokyo professor, George Edward Luckman Gauntlett (1869-1956). Shidzue Ishimoto thought Gauntlett \"interjected a puritanical Christian conscience into her chores,\" forcing Ishimoto to retranslate on a few occasions (\"Japan Feminist Dies,\" Los Angeles Times, 13 November 1953; 1871 England Census; Hopper, New Woman of Japan, 27, quote.) For more on Gauntlett, see Taeko Shibahara, \"How Did Japanese Women Peace Activists Interact with European Women as they Negotiated between Nationalism and Transnational Peace Activism to Promote Peace, 1915-1935?\"\n\nJohann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832), poet, novelist, dramatist and philosopher, was one of the great figures in world literature.

In 1926, Inagaki's prediction that Japan's population growth would stabilize once it reached 104 million (ca. 2200) was widely reported, but based on faulty calculations (The Japan Biographical Encyclopedia and Who's Who vol. 3 [Tokyo: Rengo Press, 1964-65], p. 374; Ryoichi Ishii, Population Pressure and Economic Life in Japan [London: P. S. King, 1937], p. 129.)\n\nKōsai Inoue (1870-1943), Governor of Kanagawa Prefecture, which included Yokohama.\n\nBaron Keikichi Ishimoto (1887-1951?), the son of a war hero, was a mining engineer, labor reformer and a Christian humanist.

She was inspired to lead the birth control cause after meeting Sanger in New York in 1920. In the summer of 1921, she formed the short-lived Birth Control League of Japan. In May 1922, she hosted the first meeting of the newly formed Birth Control Study Society. Known as the \"Margaret Sanger of Japan,\" she was the driving force of the movement until the late 1920s, and opened several birth control clinics in the 1930s, until her arrest and imprisonment in 1937 during a crackdown on radicals. After World War II she became a prominent politician and was active in public life into her 100s. (\"Shidzue Kato,\" London Times, 1 January 2002; Hopper, New Woman of Japan, pp. 20-22.)\n\nElizabeth Rosevear Jewett (1866-1940), was the wife of successful silk merchant John Hill Jewett, who spent most of his life in Japan (\"Mrs. J. H. M. Jewett,\" New York Times, 28 July 1940; The Jewett Family of America, Year Book of 1958 [Rowley, Mass.: Jewett Family of America, 1958], p. 29.)\n\nWilliam Eugene \"Pussyfoot\" Johnson (1862-1945) was a prominent prohibitionist who became famous for his efforts against bootleggers in the Indian Territory and Oklahoma.

Called the \"White Angel of Tokyo,\" she left the YWCA, after one of her Bible class students was convicted of murdering a geisha and executed, to dedicate herself to visiting prisoners. She received the manuscript for A Gentleman in Prison from Tokichi Ishii, who was on death row for murdering a geisha. MacDonald was invited to at least two of Sanger's meetings in Tokyo, finding her \"a very interesting and nice woman\" who had gotten \"the right end\" of the population issue (Patricia E. Roy, \"Review of Margaret Prang, A Heart at Leisure from Itself: Caroline Macdonald of Japan,\" Historical Studies in Education [Fall 1996]: 254-55; Ontario, Canada Deaths, 1969-1934; Margaret Prang, A Heart at Leisure from Itself: Caroline MacDonald of Japan [Vancouver: University of British Columbia Press, 1997], pp. 188-89.)\n\n\"Mashima\" is Kan Majima (1893-1969), among the first physicians in Japan to take up the cause of birth control.

The article summarized the contraception methods advocated by Annie Besant, including suppositories, rubber pessaries and sea sponges. According to Kaji, he also translated a book on birth control, Shakai Kairyo Jitsuron (Key of Social Reformation) in 1903, which, according to one source, gave him the idea of making a quinine-based suppository called \"kijonotomo\" (Lady's Friend), one of the few contraceptives on the market in 1922 Japan (Tokijiro Kaji, \"Methods of Birth Control Known and Used Japan,\" in Pierpont, Report of the Fifth International, pp. 297-99; Callahan, \"Dangerous Devices,\" pp. 39, fn 31 and 53.)\n\nKischichiro Oka (1868-1947), was a police superintendent in Tokyo or Yokohama.\n\nTatsunosuke Okano was an author and founding member of the short-lived Birth Control Study Society, formed in May 1922 (WorldCat.)\n\nClare Ousley [DuBose] (1896-1931), an occasional journalist, was married to Associated Press reporter Clarence DuBose, then stationed in Tokyo.

Shidehara sought to promote Japanese interests by cooperation with Western powers, and after the Conference his policies were criticized as weak and conciliatory. Shidehara withdrew from politics in the 1930s but was selected as Japan's second post-World War II Prime Minister, serving only one term (1945-46) (Janet Hunter, Concise Dictionary of Modern Japanese History [Berkeley, 1984], 197.)\n\nPercy Bysshe Shelley (1792-1822), English Romantic poet whose passionate and non-conforming personal life, his vocal atheism, and his radical political views, reinforced contemporary resistance to his poetry (Oxford Dictionary of National Biography accessed November 10, 2009.)\n\nJ. Noah Slee (1860-1943) was a South African-born businessman who emigrated to the U.S. in 1873 and founded the Three-In-One Oil Company in 1894.

Stopes had visited Japan for eighteen months (1907-1909) on a fossil-collecting trip before she quit science to focus on birth control. Stopes met Sanger in 1915 and while they were initially friendly, the two fell out in 1921 when Stopes appeared in the United States under the auspices of Sanger's rival, Mary Ware Dennett. Stopes's Married Love (1918) and Contraception (1929) were translated into Japanese.

It is difficult to know Takashima's take on birth control. His publications (which come to about 100 books and numerous articles) focus largely on child psychology and education. In his book published in 1936, he advises women, in a few pages, to choose their spouses carefully and have superior children. But it appears that he wrote little on birth control itself in his lifetime.\n\nKorekiyo Takahashi (1854-1936) was the Prime Minister of Japan and president of the Rikken Seiyukai political party. Despite his experience in management and finance, when he served as president of the Yokohama Specie Bank (1906), the Bank of Japan (1911), and as Minister of Finance (1913-1921), he was an ineffective prime minister who could not control the factions within his party, resigning in June 1922 (Encyclopedia of World Biography 2nd ed. Vol. 15, pp. 84-85. [Detroit, Mich.: Gale Research, 2004].)\n\nSanger's reference to Tate is unclear.

Wells (1866-1946), the renowned British author and social thinker, started a love affair with Margaret Sanger in 1920 that lasted, on and off, into the 1930s. Wells had attended the Washington Disarmament Conference, writing a series of newspaper essays about the issues. In \"The Future of Japan,\" published on 21 November 1921, Wells reported that Japan's overpopulation was the root of its aggressive efforts at imperialism, and suggested, \"that the troubles arising from excessive fecundity within a country justify not an aggressive imperialism on the part of that country, but a sufficient amount of birth control within its proper boundaries.\" Wells did not travel to Japan (Oxford Dictionary of National Biography accessed November 10, 2009; Wells, \"The Future of Japan,\" reprinted in Washington and the Riddle of Peace [New York, N.Y.: Macmillan Company, 1922], pp. 101-11.)\n\nKaiser Wilhelm II (Frederick Wilhelm Viktor Albert) (1859-1941) was the last emperor of Germany and King of Prussia (1888-1918) (Encyclopedia Britannica Online.)\n\nHugh Robert Wilson (1885-1946), American diplomat, held a number of junior diplomatic posts in Cuba, Argentina, Austria and Switzerland, and Japan (\"Hugh R.

She was deposed for defying her husband, and eventually replaced by Esther. Though the tale ostensibly gave a lesson that the man should be king in his home, feminists lauded Vashti as a heroine (Louise Jacobs, Oxford Concise Companion to the Jewish Religion Online [Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2003-] accessed Dec. 4, 2009.)\n\nShichitaro Yada (1879-1957), a lawyer and diplomat who had spent most of his career in China, was the Japanese Consul General, stationed in San Francisco from 1920-23 (Barbara J.

He translated her Family Limitation into Japanese in 1922, and helped found the Osaka Sanji Seigen Kenkyûkai (Osaka Birth Control Research Society) and launch and edit the Sanji Chôsetsu Hyôron (Birth Control Review). The reference to his wife is likely a typographical error, as she was not involved in birth control work (Kodansha Encyclopedia of Japan Online accessed December 4, 2009; Callahan, \"Dangerous Devices,\" pp. 107-21.)\n\nKeiichi Yamasaki (1882-?) was a Foreign Service officer who had served at the Japanese Embassy in London, Chicago, Shanghai, and from 1921-24, in Honolulu.
