        "meta_description": "In keeping with the long tradition of previous decennial conferences (starting in 1971), departments of Mathematics &amp; Statistics and Supply Chain &amp; Business Technology Management of Concordia University will host the Statistics 2021 Canada conference during July 15-18, 2021, on a virtual platform. It was announced as an onsite conference; however, due to the evolving situation of the COVID-19 pandemic, the organizers have decided to hold it online. The mixer that was planned on the evening of July 15, 2021, will be turned into a virtual networking opportunity, thus the main presentations will take place during July 16-18, 2021.\r\n\r\nThe conference will feature plenary lectures, invited sessions, contributed sessions, and poster presentations. The presentations are dedicated to all areas of statistical sciences. The conference will also feature some invited talks in the area of Actuarial Mathematics, in honour of Professor Jose Garrido, on his retirement from Concordia University. A special session will also be organized in honour of Professor T.D. Dwivedi, the founder of the series of applied statistics decennial conferences at Concordia.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the traditional theoretical/applied areas, interdisciplinary research would be encouraged and promoted including major theme areas given below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tApplied Statistics • Big Data, Bioinformatics\r\n\tBiostatistics • Computational Statistics\r\n\tData Mining • Data Science\r\n\tDemography • Econometrics\r\n\tHealth Statistics • Model Selection and Validation\r\n\tSocial Statistics • Supply Chain\r\n\tSurvival Analysis • Stochastic Methods in Ecology, Finance, and Engineering",
