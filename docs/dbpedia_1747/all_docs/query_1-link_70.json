        "text": "ENGLEWOOD, Colo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--CSG International, Inc. (NASDAQ: CSGS), a global provider of interactive transaction-driven solutions and services, today announced that Paul Nguyen, president of CSG Invotas global security solutions, has been named to the Internet Security Alliance (ISA) board of directors.\n\nISA combines the thought leadership of a think tank with the advocacy and operational focus of leading professional and industry associations. Its members include top executives from industries that include aviation, banking, communications, defense, education, financial services, health care, insurance, manufacturing, security, and technology.\n\n\"We warmly welcome Paul Nguyen to our board of directors,\" said Larry Clinton, president and chief executive officer of ISA. \"We are thrilled to be working with companies like CSG that can share decades of successful commercial technology expertise with other ISA members. We believe that market forces need to be more affirmatively harnessed to enhance the security of information infrastructure; CSG and Paul Nguyen's expertise across many industry sectors brings fresh perspectives and ideas to the table.\"\n\nNguyen's extensive experience as a seasoned cybersecurity expert for the federal government and the commercial sector and his proven track record in developing continuously-managed protection layers, data orchestration, and dynamic defense strategies provide a unique and strategic fit to ISA's diverse board.\n\n\"In Paul Nguyen, the ISA board gains an experienced security expert who can combine CSG's proven solutions and technologies with deep domain knowledge of security operations and processes,\" said Mike Henderson, president of CSG Invotas. \"We are excited to work with ISA as we develop and deliver the next generation of global security solutions.\"\n\nIn addition to the ISA board of directors, Nguyen serves on two working groups for the Communications Security, Reliability, and Interoperability Council.\n\nAbout ISA\n\nISA was founded in 2000 in collaboration with Carnegie Mellon University. ISA membership is open to public and privately held entities and currently has substantial participation from the aviation, banking, communications, defense, education, financial services, health care, insurance, manufacturing, security and technology industries. The ISA believes that the ubiquitous and interconnected nature of digital technology demands that industry and government work collaboratively on their mutual security interests. A traditional government regulatory model will not work in combating the quickly evolving cyber threats. Instead, market forces need to be more affirmatively harnessed to create an appropriate incentive structure to enhance the security of the information infrastructure. The ISA has laid out this model in a 21st Century \"Social Contract,\" which integrates both the technological and economic aspects of cybersecurity. The ISA also initiates and operates pragmatic programs to demonstrate leadership in achieving a more sustainable cyber system.\n\nAbout CSG Invotas\n\nCSG Invotasâ„¢ offers security orchestration and automation solutions that provide dynamic, real-time management of large security ecosystems. It enables security professionals to respond effectively to ever-changing cyber threats. Invotas builds upon CSG's proven solutions and expertise to support the mitigation and eradication of cyber attacks across complex enterprise environments.www.csginvotas.com.\n\nAbout CSG International\n\nCSG Systems International, Inc.
