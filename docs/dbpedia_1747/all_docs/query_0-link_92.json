        "text": "Abstract\n\nThe selection of liver transplant (LT) candidates with alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) is influenced by the risk of alcohol relapse (AR), yet the ability to predict AR is limited. We evaluate psychosocial factors associated with post-LT AR and compare the performance of high-risk alcoholism risk (HRAR), sustained alcohol use post-LT (SALT), and the Stanford Integrated Psychosocial Assessment for Transplantation (SIPAT) scores in predicting relapse.A retrospective analysis of ALD patients undergoing LT from 2015 to 2021 at a single US transplant center was performed. Risk factors associated with post-LT AR were evaluated and test characteristics of 3 prediction models were compared.Of 219 ALD LT recipients, 23 (11%) had AR during a median study follow-up of 37.5 mo. On multivariate analysis, comorbid psychiatric illness (odds ratio 5.22) and continued alcohol use after advice from a health care provider (odds ratio 3.8) were found to be significantly associated with post-LT AR. On sensitivity analysis, SIPAT of 30 was optimal on discriminating between ALD LT recipients with and without post-LT AR. SIPAT outperformed both the HRAR and SALT scores (c-statistic 0.67 versus 0.59 and 0.62, respectively) in identifying post-LT AR. However, all scores had poor positive predictive value (<25%).AR after LT is associated with comorbid psychiatric illness and lack of heeding health care provider advice to abstain from alcohol. Although SIPAT outperformed the HRAR and SALT scores in predicting AR, all are poor predictors. The current tools to predict post-LT AR should not be used to exclude LT candidacy.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1097/TP.0000000000004800\n\nView details for PubMedID 37899485\n\nAbstract\n\nConsumption of alcohol in excess leads to substantial medical, economic, and societal burdens. Approximately 5.3% of all global deaths may be attributed to alcohol consumption. Moreover, the burden of alcohol associated liver disease (ALD) accounts for 5.1% of all disease and injury worldwide. Alcohol use disorder (AUD) affects men more than women globally with significant years of life loss to disability in low, middle and well-developed countries. Precise data on global estimates of alcohol related steatosis, alcohol related hepatitis, and alcohol related cirrhosis have been challenging to obtain. In the United States (US), alcohol related steatosis has been estimated at 4.3% based on NHANES data which has remained stable over 14 years. However, alcohol-related fibrotic liver disease has increased over the same period. In those with AUD, the prevalence of alcohol related hepatitis has been estimated at 10-35%. Globally, the prevalence of alcohol-associated cirrhosis has been estimated at 23.6 million individuals for compensated cirrhosis and 2.46 million for those with decompensated cirrhosis. The contribution of ALD to global mortality and disease burden of liver related deaths is substantial. In 2016 liver disease related to AUD contributed to 50% of the estimated liver disease deaths for age groups 15 years and above. Data from the US report high cost burdens associated with those admitted with alcohol-related liver complications. Finally, the recent COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with marked increase in alcohol consumption worldwide and will likely increase the burden of ALD.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jceh.2022.09.001\n\nView details for PubMedID 36647400\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC9840073\n\nAbstract\n\nTo analyze the impact of access to routine health care, as estimated by health insurance coverage, on hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection prevalence in US adults born after 1965 (post-baby boomer birth cohort [post-BBBC]) and to use the data to formulate strategies to optimize population screening for HCV.Adult examinees in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey with available anti-HCV data were divided into era 1 (1999-2008) and era 2 (2009-2016). The prevalence of HCV infection, as defined by detectable serum HCV RNA, was determined in post-BBBC adults. In low prevalence groups, prescreening modalities were considered to increase the pretest probability.Of 16,966 eligible post-BBBC examinees, 0.5% had HCV infection. In both eras, more than 50% had no insurance. In era 2, HCV prevalence was 0.26% and 0.83% in those with and without insurance, respectively (P<.01). As a prescreening test, low alanine aminotransferase level (<23 U/L in women and 32 U/L in men) would identify 54% of post-BBBC adults with an extremely low (0.02%) HCV prevalence. Based on these data, a tiered approach that tests all uninsured directly for HCV and prescreens the insured with alanine aminotransferase would reduce the number to test by 56.5 million while missing less than 1% infections.For HCV elimination, passive \"universal\" screening in routine health care settings is insufficient, although the efficiency of screening may be improved with alanine aminotransferase prescreening. Importantly, for individuals with limited access to health care, proactive outreach programs for HCV screening are still needed.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.mayocp.2023.02.009\n\nView details for PubMedID 37661141\n\nAbstract\n\nClinical trials have been a central driver of change and have provided the evidence base necessary to advance new therapies for liver diseases. This review provides a perspective on the status of trials in hepatology, and a vantage point into the emerging capabilities and external forces that will shape the conduct of clinical trials in the future.The adaptations to clinical trials operations in response to the disruptions by the COVID-19 pandemic, and opportunities for innovation in hepatology trials are emphasized. Future trials in hepatology will be driven by unmet therapeutic needs and fueled by technological advances incorporating digital capabilities with expanded participant derived data collection, computing, and analytics. Their design will embrace innovative trial designs adapted to these advances and that emphasize broader and more inclusive participant engagement. Their conduct will be further shaped by evolving regulatory needs and the emergence of new stakeholders in the clinical trials ecosystem.The evolution of clinical trials will offer unique opportunities to advance new therapeutics that will ultimately improve the lives of patients with liver diseases.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1097/HEP.0000000000000436\n\nView details for PubMedID 37140242\n\nAbstract\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the care of patients with liver disease. We examined impact of COVID-19 on liver transplant (LT) activity in the USA.LT listings in the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database (April 2018-May 2021) were analyzed to examine the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the LT activity based on etiology: hepatitis C virus (HCV), alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), alcoholic hepatitis (AH), and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) complications: hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) grade 2 or 3) and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score. Joinpoint regression models assessed time trend changes on a log scale.Of 23,871 recipients (8,995 in the COVID era, April 2018-February 2020), mean age 52 years, 62% men, 61% Caucasian, 32% ALD, 15% HCC, 30% ACLF grades 2-3, and mean MELD score 20.5), monthly LT changes were a decrease of 3.4% for overall LTs and 22% for HCC after September 2020, and increase of 4.5% for ALD since 11/2020 and 17% since 03/2021 for ACLF grade 2-3. Monthly MELD scores increased by 0.7 and 0.36 after June 2020 for HCV and HCC respectively.The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted LT activity, with a decrease of LTs especially for HCC, and an increase of LTs for ALD and severe ACLF. Strategies are needed to reorganize cirrhosis patients to overcome the aftereffects of COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nView details for DOI 10.14218/JCTH.2022.00129\n\nView details for PubMedID 36406316\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC9647098\n\nAbstract\n\nSignificant teratogenic effects have been demonstrated for ribavirin in animal studies. Ribavirin is prescribed for chronic hepatitis C and is contraindicated in pregnant women and their male sexual partners. Both are advised to avoid pregnancy for 6 months after exposure. The registry monitored pregnancy exposures to oral formulations of ribavirin for hepatitis C for signals of possible human teratogenicity from 2004 to 2020.Pregnant women were voluntarily enrolled following direct exposure (ribavirin use during pregnancy or the 6 months prior) or indirect exposure (through sexual contact during pregnancy or 6 months prior, with a man who has taken ribavirin within 6 months). Women were followed until the end of pregnancy. Infants were followed until 1 year of age. Birth defect rates were compared with the published rate of 2.67 per 100 live births from the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program (MACDP).The registry enrolled 280 pregnancies resulting in 186 live births: eight birth defect cases among 88 directly exposed [9.09% (8/88, 95% CI: 4.01, 17.13)], and six birth defect cases among 98 indirectly exposed [6.12% (6/98, 95% CI: 2.28, 12.85)]. The 95% CI around the birth defect rate among directly exposed pregnancies exceeds the MACDP rate; however, no patterns suggestive of a teratogenic mechanism or safety signal were detected.Based on the patterns of birth defects reported, the final results from this registry do not suggest a clear signal of human teratogenicity for ribavirin. The registry did not meet sample size requirements; therefore, caution should be exercised when interpreting the results.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1002/bdr2.2094\n\nView details for PubMedID 36305304\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) contributes to significant morbidity and mortality in hospitalised patients with cirrhosis.AIMS: To examine recent trends, magnitude and outcomes of HRS, in National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database.METHODS: Among the NIS database on cirrhosis hospitalisations (2016-2019) due to alcohol (ALD), chronic viral hepatitis (CVH), or NASH and complicated by acute kidney injury (AKI) were analyzed.RESULTS: Of 113,454 hospitalisations, 18,735 (16.5%) had HRS (mean age 56years, 36% females, 68% whites, 80% ALD, 7% NASH) with a stable trend overtime. Among 1:1 propensity-matched 36,090 hospitalisations, the odds of HRS were 12% higher in NASH versus CVH. Based on weighted national estimates, there were 27,180 (8.3 per 100,000 US population) HRS hospitalisations in 2019, with economic burden of $4.2 billion USD. Mean hospitalisation and total charges (ALD vs. CVH vs. NASH) were 11 versus 10.8 versus 9.2days and 151,000 versus 157,000 versus 120,000 USD, respectively; p<0.001. In-hospital mortality was 18.9%, higher in HRS (25.8 vs. 12%, p<0.001), and decreased by 15% annually. Survivors were more likely to be discharged to short- or long-term care facilities (HRS vs. non-HRS [42 vs. 27%, p<0.001]); only 28.7% received palliative care.CONCLUSION: HRS was the cause of AKI in 16.5% of patients hospitalised with cirrhosis and conferred significant healthcare burden with 27,180 HRS hospitalisations in 2019 and requiring an estimated 4.2 billion USD for hospital care. While there has been a decrease in in-hospital mortality over time, it remained high at 23.7% in 2019 in those with HRS.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1111/apt.17232\n\nView details for PubMedID 36196562\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Malignancy-related ascites accounts for approximately 10% of causes of ascites. Our AIM was to characterize the ascites fluid and correlate clinical outcomes in those with extrahepatic malignancy and ascites.METHODS: 241 subjects with extrahepatic solid tumors and ascites were reviewed from 1/1/2000 to 12/31/2019, 119 without liver metastasis and 122 with liver metastasis.RESULTS: Ascites fluid consistent with peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) was most common, 150/241 (62%), followed by fluid reflecting the presence of portal hypertension (PH), 69/241 (29%). 22/241 (9%) had low SAAG and low ascites fluid total protein, with evidence of PC on cytology and or imaging in 20/22. Lung cancer was the most common malignancy in subjects with ascites due to PC at 36/150 (24%), pancreatic cancer was the most common in subjects with ascites with features of PH at 16/69 (23%). Chemotherapy or immunotherapy alone was the most common management approach. Significantly higher 5-year, 3-year and 1-year mortality rate were noted in subjects with evidence of PC on cytology/imaging versus subjects with no evidence of PC, and in subjects with liver metastasis compared to subjects without liver metastasis. Subjects with pancreatic cancer and evidence of PC on cytology/imaging had higher 1 and 5-year mortality rates compared to subjects without PC.CONCLUSIONS: Ascites in solid tumor malignancy is most commonly due to PC. We also observed ascites fluid with characteristics of PH in 29% of subjects. Higher mortality rates in subjects with peritoneal carcinomatosis and liver metastasis were noted. These findings may help inform prognosis and treatment strategies.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1186/s12876-022-02487-4\n\nView details for PubMedID 36064324\n\nAbstract\n\nChronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is the leading risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of this study was to explore the incidence of HCC in a cohort of subjects with HBV and correlate with HBV treatment current guidance. We identified 2846 subjects with HBV over the study period. HCC was diagnosed in 386 of 2846 (14%) subjects; 209 of 386 (54%) were on nucleos(t)ide analogue (NA) therapy at time of HCC diagnosis, and 177 of 386 (46%) were not on NA therapy. Of the 177 subjects not on NAs who developed HCC during follow-up, 153 of 177 (86%) had cirrhosis. Within the 177 subjects not on NAs, 158 of 177 (89%) had undetectable HBV DNA, 10 of 177 (6%) had detectable HBV DNA < 2000 IU/L, and 9 of 177 (5%) had HBV DNA > 2000 IU/L. Of those with cirrhosis and undetectable HBV DNA, 115 of 141 had compensated cirrhosis, and 26 of 141 had decompensated cirrhosis. Significant predictors of HCC on time to event analysis included cirrhosis (hazard ratio [HR] 10, 95% confidence interval [CI] 5.8-17.5; p < 0.001), alanine aminotransferase level (HR 1.004, 95% CI 1.002-1.006; p < 0.001), age (HR 1.04, 95% CI 1.03-1.06; p < 0.001), (HR 1.9, 95% CI 1.2-3.1; p 0.007), and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (HR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1-2.8; p 0.02). Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated the cumulative incidence of HCC in subjects with compensated cirrhosis receiving NA therapy was significantly lower compared to subjects with compensated cirrhosis outside current HBV treatment practice guidance (undetectable HBV DNA) (32% vs. 51%; p < 0.001). Conclusion: Those with untreated compensated cirrhosis with undetectable HBV DNA who do not meet current guidance for treatment had higher rates of HCC than those with compensated cirrhosis and suppressed HBV DNA by NA therapy. This study highlights the need for earlier diagnosis and treatment of HBV.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1002/hep4.2064\n\nView details for PubMedID 36004713\n\nAbstract\n\nThe demand for orthotopic liver transplants (OLT) is projected to increase which indicates a need to expand the liver donor pool. We aimed to investigate the utilization of hepatitis B (HBV)-positive graft utilization and the outcomes of recipients undergoing orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) with HBV-positive grafts.We conducted a retrospective cohort study analyzing all deceased donors and OLT recipients in the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network database from January 1999 through March 2021. Donor HBV status was positive if HBsAg was positive or HBV nucleic acid testing was detectable. Recipients of HBV-positive allografts were matched 1:5 to recipients of HBV-negative allografts based on recipient and donor age, transplant year, recipient gender, donation after circulatory death, recipient location, and MELD score at transplant.Among the 185,212 potential donors, 422(0.2%) were HBV-positive and 265(63%) of the HBV-positive grafts were transplanted (14 of 265[5.3%] in HBV-positive recipients). The overall discard rate for HBV-positive donors of 37.2% (157/422) remained significantly higher than the discard rate for HBV-negative donors of 26.5% (49,026/185,212) during the study period (p < 0.001). Recipients of HBV-positive (n = 209) had similar mortality (log-rank, p=0.47) and graft loss (log-rank, p=0.72) to matched recipients of HBV-negative allografts (n = 1,045). The 3-year graft survival was 77.9% for the HBV-positive group and 79.7% in the matched HBV-negative group.Based on this analysis, transplant recipients of HBV-positive liver allografts do not experience increased rates of mortality or graft loss. Utilizing these HBV-positive allografts is one strategy that may help expand the donor pool and lower the waiting-list mortality rate.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1002/lt.26543\n\nView details for PubMedID 35844046\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND AND AIMS: Nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors do not completely suppress hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA in chronic HBV infection (cHBV). Vebicorvir (VBR) is an investigational core inhibitor which interferes with multiple aspects of HBV replication. This phase 2 trial (NCT03577171) evaluated the efficacy and safety of VBR in combination with entecavir (ETV) in treatment-naive patients with cHBV.METHODS: Hepatitis B \"e\" antigen positive, treatment-naive patients without cirrhosis were randomised 1:1 in a double-blind manner, to once-daily VBR 300 mg+ETV 0.5 mg or placebo (PBO)+ETV for 24 weeks (W). The primary endpoint was change in mean log10 HBV DNA from Baseline to W12 and W24.RESULTS: All patients in both treatment groups (PBO+ETV: 12/12; VBR+ETV: 13/13) completed the study. At W12, VBR+ETV led to a greater mean (SD) reduction from Baseline in log10 IU/mL HBV DNA (-4.45 [1.03]) vs PBO+ETV (-3.30 [1.18]; p=0.0077). At W24, VBR+ETV led to a greater reduction from Baseline in log10 IU/mL HBV DNA (-5.33 [1.59]) vs PBO+ETV (-4.20 [0.98]; p=0.0084). Greater mean reductions in pregenomic RNA were observed at W12 and W24 in patients receiving VBR+ETV vs PBO+ETV (p<0.0001 and p<0.0001). Changes in viral antigens were similar in both groups. No drug interaction between VBR and ETV was observed. Two patients experienced HBV DNA rebound during treatment, with no resistance breakthrough detected. Safety of VBR+ETV was similar to PBO+ETV. All treatment-emergent adverse events and laboratory abnormalities were Grade 1/2. There were no deaths, serious AEs, or evidence of drug-induced liver injury.CONCLUSIONS: In this 24-week study, VBR+ETV provided additive antiviral activity over PBO+ETV in treatment-naive patients with cHBV with a favourable safety and tolerability profile.LAY SUMMARY: Hepatitis B is a long-lasting viral infection of the liver. This study demonstrates that vebicorvir (a core inhibitor) with entecavir is generally safe, well tolerated, and demonstrates greater antiviral activity compared with entecavir alone in treatment-naive patients chronically infected with hepatitis B virus. This study supports continued evaluation of vebicorvir in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B.CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: NCT03577171.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jhep.2022.05.027\n\nView details for PubMedID 35697332\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) implemented medical eligibility and safety-net policy on 8/10/17 to optimize simultaneous liver-kidney (SLK) utilization. We examined impact of this policy on SLK listings and number of kidneys used within 1-yr. of receiving liver transplantation (LT) alone.METHODS AND RESULTS: OPTN database (08/10/14-06/12/20) on adults (N = 66,709) without previous transplant stratified candidates to listings for SLK or LT alone with pre-LT renal dysfunction at listing (eGFR<30mL/min or on dialysis). Outcomes were compared for pre (08/10/14-08/09/17) vs. post (08/10/17-06/12/20) policy era. SLK listings decreased in post vs. pre policy era (8.7% vs 9.6%;P<0.001), with 22% reduced odds of SLK listing in the post-policy era, with decrease in all OPTN regions except regions 6 and 8, which showed an increase. Among LT alone recipients with pre-LT renal dysfunction (N = 3272), cumulative 1-yr. probability was higher in post vs. pre-policy period for dialysis (5.6 vs. 2.3%; P<0.0001), KT listing (11.4 vs. 2.0%; P<0.0001) and KT (3.7 vs. 0.25%; P<0.0001). 67 (2.4%) kidneys were saved in post policy era, with 18.1%, 16.6%, 4.3%, and 2.9% saving from regions 7, 2, 11, and 1, respectively.CONCLUSION: Medical eligibility and safety-net OPTN policy resulted in decreased SLK use and improved access to LT alone among those with pre-LT renal dysfunction. Although decreased in post-policy era, regional variation of SLK listings remains. In spite of increased use of KT within 1-yr of receiving LT alone under safety net, less number of kidneys were used without impact on patient survival in post-policy era.

We aimed to study TAF real-world outcomes with other first-line regimens for chronic hepatitis B (CHB). We enrolled patients with CHB from 10 centers retrospectively and followed them for 36months prospectively. We analyzed switching patterns of antiviral therapy and treatment outcomes of TAF, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), and entecavir therapy. For efficacy and safety, we analyzed a subset of patients with complete data at 24months after switching to TAF or remaining on TDF or entecavir. Among 1037 enrollees, 889 patients were analyzed. The mean age was 52%, and 72% were hepatitis B e antigen-negative. After enrollment, shifts in therapies were mostly in reduced use of TDF from 63% to 30% due to switching to TAF. Clinical parameters were compared at enrollment or initiation to measures at 24months for patients remaining on TAF (187), TDF (229), or entecavir (181). At 24months, a significantly higher portion of patients on TAF achieved hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA ≤20IU/ml (93% vs. 86%; p=0.012) and normalized alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (66% vs. 56%; p=0.031) with stable estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFRs). However, a higher percentage of the patient with eGFR <60ml/mi/1.7m2 was observed in the TDF-treated group (9% vs. 4%; p=0.010). In patients who remained on entecavir or TDF for 24months, ALT and HBV-DNA results did not differ significantly from baseline. Treatment of CHB in the United States has significantly shifted from TDF to TAF. Our data suggest that switching from TDF or entecavir to TAF may result in increased frequency of ALT normalization and potential clearance of viremia at the 24-month time point.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1002/hep4.1964\n\nView details for PubMedID 35445803\n\nAbstract\n\nHepatitis B virus (HBV) nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NrtI) do not completely suppress HBV replication. Previous reports indicate persistent viremia during NrtI treatment despite HBV DNA being undetectable. HBV core inhibitors may enhance viral suppression when combined with NrtIs. This phase 2 trial (NCT03576066) evaluated the efficacy and safety of the investigational core inhibitor, vebicorvir (VBR), in virologically-suppressed patients on NrtI.Noncirrhotic, NrtI-suppressed patients with chronic HBV were randomised to VBR 300 mg once daily or matching placebo (PBO) for 24 weeks. Treatment was stratified by hepatitis B \"e\" antigen (HBeAg) status. The primary endpoint was change from Baseline in serum HBeAg or hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) after 24 weeks.Of 73 patients enrolled, 47 and 26 were HBeAg positive and negative. In HBeAg positive and negative patients, there were no differences in the change from Baseline at Week 24 for HBsAg or HBeAg. Using a novel, high-sensitivity assay to detect HBV DNA, a greater proportion of patients with detectable HBV DNA at Baseline receiving VBR+NrtI achieved DNA target not detected at Week 24 compared to PBO+NrtI. In HBeAg positive patients, a greater change from Baseline in HBV pregenomic (pg)RNA was observed at Week 24 with VBR+NrtI vs PBO+NrtI. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in VBR+NrtI patients included upper respiratory tract infection, nausea, and pruritus. No serious adverse events, Grade 4 TEAEs, or deaths were reported.In this 24-week study, VBR+NrtI demonstrated a favourable safety and tolerability profile. While there were no significant changes in viral antigen levels, enhanced viral suppression was evident by greater changes in DNA and pgRNA with the addition of VBR compared to NrtI alone.Core inhibitors represent a novel approach to treating chronic HBV infection, with mechanisms of action distinct from existing treatments. In this study, vebicorvir added to existing therapy reduced HBV replication to a greater extent than existing treatment and was generally safe and well tolerated.NCT03576066.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jhep.2022.04.005\n\nView details for PubMedID 35460726\n\nAbstract\n\nIMPORTANCE: Electronic health record (EHR) tools such as direct-to-patient messaging and automated lab orders are effective at improving uptake of preventive health measures. It is unknown if patient engagement in primary care impacts efficacy of such messaging.OBJECTIVE: To determine whether more engaged patients, defined as those who have an upcoming visit scheduled, are more likely to respond to a direct-to-patient message with an automated lab order for hepatitis C virus (HCV) screening.DESIGN: Randomized trial PARTICIPANTS: One thousand six hundred randomly selected Stanford Primary Care patients, 800 with an upcoming visit within 6 months and 800 without, born between 1945 and 1965 who were due for HCV screening. Each group was randomly divided into cohorts of 400 subjects each. Subjects were followed for 1 year.INTERVENTION: One 400 subject cohort in each group received a direct-to-patient message through the EHR portal with HCV antibody lab order.MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: The EHR was queried on a monthly basis for 6 months after the intervention to monitor which subjects completed HCV screening. For any subjects screened positive for HCV, follow-up through the cascade of HCV care was monitored, and if needed, scheduled by the study team.KEY RESULTS: Of 1600 subjects, 538 (34%) completed HCV screening. In the stratum without an upcoming appointment, 18% in the control group completed screening compared to 26% in intervention group (p<0.01). Similarly, in the stratum with an upcoming appointment, 34% in the control group completed screening compared to 58% in the intervention group (p<0.01).CONCLUSION: Direct-to-patient messaging coupled with automated lab orders improved HCV screening rates compared to standard of care, particularly in more engaged patients. Including this intervention in primary care can maximize screening with each visit, which is particularly valuable in times when physical throughput in the healthcare system may be low.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1007/s11606-022-07460-1\n\nView details for PubMedID 35230622\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND & AIMS: Vasoconstrictors are the treatment of choice for hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), a potentially lethal complication of end-stage liver disease. We evaluate the real-life effectiveness of a sequential vasoconstrictor regimen of midodrine-octreotide followed by norepinephrine in a non-ICU setting in the United States, where terlipressin is not available.APPROACH & RESULTS: Adult patients diagnosed with HRS were treated with oral midodrine and subcutaneous octreotide in conjunction with albumin. The diagnosis of HRS and definitions of acute kidney injury were based on 2015 guidelines from the International Club of Ascites. A partial response was defined as regression of acute kidney injury (AKI) stage with reduction in serum creatinine to ≥0.3 mg/dL above baseline, whereas a full response was regression of AKI stage with return to a value within 0.3 mg/dL of baseline. In patients without partial or full response, norepinephrine was administered at a starting dose of 5 mcg/min, with a goal to achieve a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 10 mmHg above baseline. We assessed predictors of response and treatment outcomes. 61 patients received midodrine and octreotide for the treatment of HRS, with a 28% response rate. The median MELD-Na was 30 (IQR 24-35), with median MAP of 73 mmHg (IQR 67-79) at the start of treatment. Responders were more likely to have alcohol-related liver disease and lower ACLF grade. Of the non-responders, 20 then received norepinephrine, of whom 45% achieved full or partial response. Achieving MAP increase of ≥10 mmHg was associated with a greater probability of response. Patients who responded to norepinephrine experienced improved transplant-free survival at 90 days (88% v. 27%, p=0.02). Five of 20 patients experienced norepinephrine treatment-related adverse events, namely arrhythmias.CONCLUSION: Norepinephrine can be effectively used in a non-ICU setting as rescue therapy in patients who have not responded to midodrine and octreotide. Based on these data, we propose a practical stepwise algorithm for vasoconstrictor therapy to manage HRS in situations where terlipressin is not an option.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1002/lt.26065\n\nView details for PubMedID 33837624\n\nAbstract\n\nLiver transplantation (LT) is definitive treatment for end-stage liver disease. This study evaluated factors predicting successful evaluation in patients transferred for urgent inpatient LT evaluation. Eighty-two patients with cirrhosis were transferred for urgent LT evaluation from January 2016 to December 2018. Alcohol-associated liver disease was the common etiology of liver disease (42/82). Of these 82 patients, 35 (43%) were declined for LT, 27 (33%) were wait-listed for LT, 5 (6%) improved, and 15 (18%) died. Psychosocial factors were the most common reasons for being declined for LT (49%). Predictors for listing and receiving LT on multivariate analysis included Hispanic race (odds ratio [OR], 1.89; P = 0.003), Asian race (OR, 1.52; P = 0.02), non-Hispanic ethnicity (OR, 1.49; P = 0.04), hyponatremia (OR, 1.38; P = 0.04), serum albumin (OR, 1.13; P = 0.01), and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD)-Na (OR, 1.02; P = 0.003). Public insurance (i.e., Medicaid) was a predictor of not being listed for LT on multivariate analysis (OR, 0.77; P = 0.02). Excluding patients declined for psychosocial reasons, predictors of being declined for LT on multivariate analysis included Chronic Liver Failure Consortium (CLIF-C) score >51.5 (OR, 1.26; P = 0.03), acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) grade 3 (OR, 1.41; P = 0.01), hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) (OR, 1.38; P = 0.01), and respiratory failure (OR, 1.51; P = 0.01). Predictors of 3-month mortality included CLIF-C score >51.5 (hazard ratio [HR], 2.52; P = 0.04) and intensive care unit (HR, 8.25; P < 0.001). Conclusion: MELD-Na, albumin, hyponatremia, ACLF grade 3, HRS, respiratory failure, public insurance, Hispanic race, Asian race, and non-Hispanic ethnicity predicted liver transplant outcome. Lack of psychosocial support was a major reason for being declined for LT. The CLIF-C score predicted being declined for LT and mortality.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1002/hep4.1644\n\nView details for PubMedID 33681683\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC7917272\n\nAbstract\n\nAlcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is emerging worldwide as the leading cause of liver-related morbidity, mortality, and indication for liver transplantation. The ALD Special Interest Group and the Clinical Research Committee at the digital AASLD meeting in November 2020 held the scientific sessions to identify clinical unmet needs in ALD, and addressing these needs using clinical research methodologies. Of several research methodologies, the sessions were focused to a) study disease burden of ALD using large administrative databases, b) develop biomarkers for non-invasive diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis (AH) and estimation of disease prognosis, c) identify novel therapeutic targets for ALD and AH, d) derive accurate models to predict prognosis or post-transplant alcohol relapse as a basis for developing treatment algorithm and a uniform protocol on patient selection criteria for liver transplantation, and e) examine qualitative research methodologies in studying the barriers to implementation of multidisciplinary integrated care model by hepatology and addiction teams for the management of dual pathology of liver disease and of alcohol use disorder. Prospective multicenter studies are required to address many of these clinical unmet needs. Further, multidisciplinary care models are needed to improve long-term outcomes in patients with ALD.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1002/hep.32143\n\nView details for PubMedID 34496071\n\nAbstract\n\nChronic hepatitis C infection is a major cause of liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide. While hepatitis C has been treated for decades with some success, the introduction of direct acting antiviral agents has revolutionized the treatment of hepatitis C with finite, highly effective, well-tolerated therapy and there are few populations that cannot be successfully treated now or are complicated to manage. The World Health Organization has released elimination targets in an effort to eliminate viral hepatitis and reduce dramatically the morbidity and mortality caused by both viral hepatitis. While hepatitis C is straightforward to treat, it remains problematic to eliminate on a global scale. Diagnosis of hepatitis C remains the major gap in the cascade of care and numerous screening strategies will be required to reduce this gap. While historically, treatment of hepatitis C has been centralized, decentralized approaches will be required to diagnose, evaluate, and link to care the large population of individuals worldwide with hepatitis C across low-, middle-, and high-income countries. With the introduction of multiple pangenotypic treatment options and reduced cost for these therapies, assessment and treatment for those with hepatitis C has been simplified and made more accessible worldwide. There are multiple populations for whom care models are being developed and refined, including those when inject drugs, those who are incarcerated, those who present with sexually transmitted disease including the men who have sex with men population, amongst many others. While a vaccine for hepatitis C remains elusive these efforts continue. Multiple successful elimination efforts have been reported.\n\nView details for DOI 10.3350/cmh.2020.0230\n\nView details for PubMedID 33317245\n\nAbstract\n\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is generally considered a silent and potentially reversible condition. The subtype of NAFLD that can be classified as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) can progress to advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis. Because of the metabolic nature of the pathogenic mechanism underlying NAFLD and NASH, it is often accompanied by common comorbidities such as obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The increase in the prevalence of these comorbidities has resulted in a parallel increase in the prevalence of NAFLD and NASH, globally, nationally, and even in children. In recent years, it has been identified that the stage of fibrosis is the most important predictor of liver outcomes; therefore, identifying patients with NAFLD and NASH with more advanced stages of fibrosis can be essential for optimal management. Several noninvasive tools for diagnosing and staging NAFLD and NASH are available, but simple and straightforward recommendations on the use of these tools are not. Recognizing these unmet needs, hepatologists who are members of the American College of Gastroenterology and the Chronic Liver Disease Foundation created a practical decision tree/algorithm to risk stratify NAFLD/NASH as a resource in gastroenterology/hepatology clinical practices. This review will provide insight into how this algorithm was developed, describe it in detail, and provide recommendations for its use in clinical practice.\n\nView details for DOI 10.14309/ajg.0000000000001054\n\nView details for PubMedID 33284184\n\nAbstract\n\nDirect-acting antiviral treatments for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are generally safe; however, understanding the safety profile of each regimen is essential for their continued use. Safety data were pooled from 12 clinical trials of elbasvir/grazoprevir (EBR/GZR) that enrolled adult participants with HCV infection. Pooled analyses are presented for participants receiving EBR/GZR for 12 weeks and those receiving EBR/GZR plus ribavirin (RBV) for 16-18 weeks. Safety data are also presented for participants with comorbidities receiving EBR/GZR for 12 weeks in individual clinical trials (chronic kidney disease [CKD] stage 4/5, inherited blood disorders [IBLD], or receiving opioid agonist therapy [OAT]). Among 1743 participants receiving EBR/GZR for 12 weeks, 1068 (61.3%) reported ≥1 adverse event (AE) and 491 had AEs (28.2%) considered drug-related. The most frequent AEs were headache (10.6%), fatigue (8.7%), nasopharyngitis (5.8%), nausea (5.1%), and diarrhea (5.0%). Serious AEs were reported by 37 participants (2.1%), and 12 (0.7%) discontinued treatment due to an AE. In populations with CKD 4/5 or IBLD or receiving OAT, safety was similar in participants receiving EBR/GZR for 12 weeks and those receiving placebo. Some AEs occurred at higher frequencies in participants receiving RBV compared with those receiving EBR/GZR alone: fatigue (32.7% vs 8.7%); headache (21.6% vs 10.6%); and nausea (15.8% vs 5.1%). Safety was similar in participants with and those without cirrhosis. Grade 3/4 alanine aminotransferase elevations were reported in 0.7% participants.EBR/GZR is a safe treatment option for individuals with HCV genotype (GT)1 or GT4 infections, even those with challenging comorbidities such as CKD or IBLD and in those receiving OAT.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1111/jvh.13357\n\nView details for PubMedID 32594612\n\nAbstract\n\nThe hepatitis C virus (HCV) is among the most common blood-borne infections worldwide and a major cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. HCV was first identified in 1989. The current use of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) to cure HCV reflects rapid diagnostic and therapeutic advances in a short period of time that is seen in few diseases. Both the cost and access to DAAs have improved since the introduction of these therapies in 2014. While HCV is very easy to treat, it will be difficult to eliminate worldwide. The tools exist to create strategies to treat and eliminate HCV as a public health threat; however, elimination of HCV will involve improving access to diagnostic testing for HCV with confirmation of active infection. Models of care will need to be revised from centralized, specialized care to decentralized, point-of-care treatment for HCV patients. These models should include clinics that care for populations with a high prevalence of HCV, such as those treating intravenous drug users, needle exchange services, community health centers, and prisons, in addition to primary care clinics. These care pathways are feasible because of the simplicity of pan-genotypic therapies for HCV that require minimal monitoring. Many countries and regions of the world have embarked on programs with the goal of achieving the World Health Organization target of elimination by 2030. Best practices in HCV elimination should be shared globally.\n\nView details for DOI 10.14744/hf.2020.2020.0009\n\nView details for PubMedID 35949441\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC9349344\n\nAbstract\n\nDirect-acting antiviral (DAA) HCV therapy is used in decompensated cirrhosis with the expectation of improvement in hepatic function. Little is known about the long-term benefit of successful treatment.Patients with advanced/decompensated cirrhosis (MELD ≥10) in HCV-TARGET who initiated NS5A-containing DAA therapy prior to September, 2018, were included. Treatment outcomes and the impact of treatment on short-term and long-term hepatic function were examined.642 patients were analyzed. The mean age was 60 years, 68% were male. The median baseline MELD was 12 (range 10-39) and 64% had prior decompensation. Among patients with available virologic outcomes, 90.5% achieved SVR12. Twenty-four % achieved a clinically significant decrease in MELD by ≥3 points during short term follow-up (9-26 weeks after the end of treatment). However, in long-term follow up (median of 4 years after treatment), mean changes in MELD (-0.30 points), total bilirubin (+0.23 mg/dl) and albumin (+0.36 g/dl) were marginal. Fifty-one patients died and 22 underwent liver transplant. In long term follow up, a clinically meaningful decrease in MELD of ≥3 occurred in 29% and a final MELD score of <10 was achieved in 25%.In a large real-world experience of patients with advanced/decompensated HCV cirrhosis treated with DAA, there were only marginal improvements in MELD, total bilirubin, or albumin in long-term follow up (median of 4 years after treatment) after achieving SVR; a clinically meaningful decrease in MELD of ≥3 occurred in 29% and a final MELD score of <10 was achieved in 25%. These patients may remain at high risk of decompensation and must continue to be closely followed.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jhep.2020.03.031\n\nView details for PubMedID 32243960\n\nAbstract\n\nThrombocytopenia is a consequence of portal hypertension and is the most common hematological manifestation of chronic liver disease (CLD) (ie, cirrhosis). Data indicates the rates of CLD are increasing and, as a result, so will the incidence of this complication. Although bleeding risks are only relevant when elective procedures are performed, this is a frequent concern as these procedures are commonly part of the spectrum of care for patients with cirrhosis. As such, thrombocytopenia remains a pertinent issue. Fortunately, we now have effective and accurate treatment modalities to raise platelet counts before scheduled procedures, known as thrombopoietin receptor agonists. Two drugs in this therapeutic class (avatrombopag and lusutrombopag) are now approved for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adults with CLD undergoing a procedure and have revolutionized how this is managed. Although there is progress in the field, peer-reviewed literature and expert guidance are lacking. Recognizing these unmet needs, a group of expert hepatologists comprised this review, which summarizes the most current and relevant peer-reviewed literature on thrombocytopenia in CLD and provides clinical expertise on this timely topic.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1097/MCG.0000000000001338\n\nView details for PubMedID 32195771\n\nAbstract\n\nAmong candidates listed for liver transplant (LT), MELD score may not capture acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF) severity. Data on interaction between ACLF and MELD score in predicting waitlist (WL) mortality are scanty.UNOS database (01/2002 to 06/2018) on LT listings for adults with cirrhosis and ACLF (without HCC) was analyzed. ACLF grades 1, 2, 3a, and 3b- were defined using modified EASL-CLIF criteria.Of 18,416 candidates with ACLF at listing (mean age 54 years, 69% males, 63% Caucasians), 90-d WL mortality (patient death or being too sick for LT) was 21.6% (18%, 20%, 25%, and 39% for ACLF grades 1, 2, 3a, and 3b respectively). Fine and Gray regression model identified interaction between MELD and ACLF grade, with higher impact of ACLF at lower MELD score. Other variables included candidate's age, gender, liver disease etiology, listing MELD, ACLF grade, obesity, and performance status. A score developed using parameter estimates from the interaction model on the derivation cohort (N=9181) stratified the validation cohort (N=9235) to four quartiles Q1 (score <10.42), Q2 (10.42-12.81), Q3 (12.82-15.50), and Q4 (>15.50). WL mortality increased with each quartile from 13%, 18%, 23%, and 36% respectively. Observed versus expected deciles on WL mortality in validation cohort showed good calibration (goodness of fit P=0.98) and correlation (R=0.99).Among selected candidates who are in ACLF at listing, MELD score and ACLF interact in predicting cumulative risk of 90-d WL mortality, with higher impact of ACLF grade at lower listing MELD score. Validating these findings in large prospective studies will support to factor in both MELD and ACLF in prioritizing transplant candidates and allocation of liver grafts.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jhep.2020.12.003\n\nView details for PubMedID 33326814\n\nAbstract\n\nLong waiting times due to ongoing organ shortage has led to increased utilization of locoregional therapies (LRTs) to bridge patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to liver transplantation (LT). We performed this study to evaluate the impact of LRTs on post-LT outcomes. We conducted a retrospective study of patients who were transplanted for HCC at Stanford University Hospital between 2008 and 2018 (n = 302). We found that receipt of ≥ 5 LRTs was an independent and significant predictor of poor overall 5-year survival (58.3% vs. 83.3%; HR 2.26, p = 0.03), poor recurrence-free 5-year survival (51.9% vs. 80.4%; HR 2.12, p = 0.03), and was associated with higher rates of recurrence (25.0% vs. 7.4%, p = 0.001). Moreover, recurrent HCC was more likely to be the cause of death (58.3% vs. 41.7%, p = 0.04) in patients who received ≥ 5 LRTs. Also, patients who required ≥ 5 LRTs showed an overall lower rate of radiological complete response (46.9% vs. 97.8%, p = 0.001) and were more likely to have more advanced pathological stage tumors in the explant (65.6% vs. 29.6%, p < 0.001). In conclusion, receipt of ≥ 5 bridging LRTs prior to LT is associated with worse post-transplant clinical outcomes.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1111/ctr.14128\n\nView details for PubMedID 33098134\n\nAbstract\n\nHepatitis C virus (HCV) has high genetic diversity with 6 major genotypes (GT) GT1-6 and global distribution. HCV GT5 and 6 are rare with <10 million people infected worldwide. Data on direct-acting antiviral use in these rare HCV genotypes are limited. The study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (G/P) in a pooled analysis of phase 2/3 trials in HCV GT5 or 6-infected patients without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis.Patients with chronic HCV GT5 or 6 infection received oral G/P (300 mg/120 mg) once daily for 8 or 12 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was sustained virologic response at post-treatment week 12 (SVR12) in the intention-to-treat population.One hundred eighty-one patients were evaluated; 56 with HCV GT5 and 125 with HCV GT6. The majority were treatment-naïve (88%) and non-cirrhotic (85%). Overall SVR12 rate with 8- or 12-week G/P treatment was 98% (178/181). Eight-week treatment with G/P yielded SVR12 rates of 95% (21/22) in HCV GT5- and 99% (69/70) in HCV GT6-infected non-cirrhotic patients. Eight- and 12-week treatment of patients with compensated cirrhosis achieved SVR12 rates of 100% (10/10) and 94% (17/18), respectively. The G/P regimen was well-tolerated; 3% (6/181) Grade 3 or higher adverse events, and no serious adverse events were attributed to G/P or led to study drug discontinuation.This integrated dataset demonstrates a high SVR12 rate following 8-week G/P treatment in patients with HCV GT5 (96%) or GT6 (99%) infection without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1111/liv.14535\n\nView details for PubMedID 32445613\n\nAbstract\n\nChronic liver disease (CLD) represents a major global health burden. We undertook this study to identify the factors associated with adverse outcomes in patients with CLD who acquire the novel coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19).We conducted a multi-center, observational cohort study across 21 institutions in the United States (US) of adult patients with CLD and laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 between March 1, 2020 and May 30, 2020. We performed survival analysis to identify independent predictors of all-cause mortality and COVID-19 related mortality, and multivariate logistic regression to determine the risk of severe COVID-19 in patients with CLD.Of the 978 patients in our cohort, 867 patients (mean age 56.9±14.5 years, 55% male) met inclusion criteria. The overall all-cause mortality was 14.0% (n = 121), and 61.7% (n = 535) had severe COVID-19. Patients presenting with diarrhea or nausea/vomiting were more likely to have severe COVID-19. The liver-specific factors associated with independent risk of higher overall mortality were alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) (hazard ratio [HR] 2.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.29-4.55), decompensated cirrhosis (HR 2.91 [1.70-5.00]) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (HR 3.31 [1.53-7.16]). Other factors were increasing age, diabetes, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and current smoker. Hispanic ethnicity (odds ratio [OR] 2.33 [1.47-3.70]) and decompensated cirrhosis (OR 2.50 [1.20-5.21]) were independently associated with risk for severe COVID-19.The risk factors which predict higher overall mortality among patients with CLD and COVID-19 are ALD, decompensated cirrhosis and HCC. Hispanic ethnicity and decompensated cirrhosis are associated with severe COVID-19. Our results will enable risk stratification and personalization of the management of patients with CLD and COVID-19.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.cgh.2020.09.027\n\nView details for PubMedID 32950749\n\nAbstract\n\nThe incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is growing in the US, especially among the elderly. Older patients are increasingly getting transplanted for HCC, but the impact of advancing age on long-term post-transplant outcomes is not clear. To study this, we used data from the US Multicenter HCC Transplant Consortium (UMHTC) of 4980 patients. We divided the patients into 4 groups by age at transplantation- 18-64 (n = 4001), 65-69 (n = 683), 70-74 (n = 252) and ≥ 75 years (n = 44). There were no differences in HCC tumor stage, type of bridging locoregional therapy or explant residual tumor between the groups. Older age was confirmed to be an independent and significant predictor of overall survival even after adjusting for demographic, etiologic and cancer-related factors on multivariable analysis. A dose-response effect of age on survival was observed, with every 5-year increase in age over 50 years resulting in an absolute increase of 8.3% in the mortality rate. Competing risk analysis revealed that older patients experienced higher rates of non-HCC-related mortality (p = 0.004), and not HCC-related death (p = 0.24). To delineate the precise cause of death, we further analyzed a single-center cohort of patients transplanted for HCC (n = 302). Patients older than 65 years had a higher incidence of de-novo cancer (18.1% vs 7.6%, p = 0.006) after transplantation and higher overall cancer-related mortality (14.3% vs 6.6%, p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Even carefully selected elderly patients with HCC have significantly worse post-transplant survival, which are mostly driven by non-HCC related causes. Minimizing immunosuppression and closer surveillance for de novo cancers can potentially improve outcomes in elderly patients transplanted for HCC.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1002/lt.25974\n\nView details for PubMedID 33306254\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground/Aims: Patients with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) have a high risk for readmission. We studied the role of palliative care consultation (PCC) in ESLD-related readmissions with a focus on health care resource utilization in the United States. Methods: We performed a retrospective longitudinal analysis on patients surviving hospitalizations with ESLD from January 2010 to September 2014 utilizing the Nationwide Readmissions Database with a 90-day follow-up after discharge. We analyzed annual trends in PCC among patients with ESLD. We matched PCC to no-PCC (1:1) using propensity scores to create a pseudorandomized clinical study. We estimated the impact of PCC on readmission rates (30- and 90-day), and length of stay (LOS) and cost during subsequent readmissions. Results: Of the 67,480 hospitalizations with ESLD, 3485 (5.3%) received PCC, with an annual increase from 3.6% to 6.7% (p for trend <0.01). The average 30- and 90-day annual readmission rates were 36.2% and 54.6%, respectively. PCC resulted in a lower risk for 30- and 90-day readmissions (hazard ratio: 0.42, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.38-0.47 and 0.38, 95% CI: 0.34-0.42, respectively). On subsequent 30- and 90-day readmissions, PCC was associated with decreased LOS (5.6- vs. 7.4 days and 5.7- vs. 6.9 days, p<0.01) and cost (US $48,752 vs. US $75,810 and US $48,582 vs. US $69,035, p<0.01). Conclusion: Inpatient utilization of PCC for ESLD is increasing annually, yet still remains low in the United States. More importantly, PCC was associated with a decline in readmission rates resulting in a lower burden on health care resource utilization and improvement in cost savings during subsequent readmissions.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1089/jpm.2019.0100\n\nView details for PubMedID 31397615\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection with genotypes (GT) 1 and 2 accounts for over 50% of HCV infections globally, including over 97% of all HCV infections in Japan. Here, we report an integrated analysis of efficacy and safety of 8-week treatment with the all-oral, fixed-dose combination of the direct acting antivirals (DAA), glecaprevir and pibrentasvir (G/P), in DAA-naive Japanese and overseas patients without cirrhosis and with HCV GT1 or GT2 infection.METHODS: Data from 899 DAA-naive patients without cirrhosis and with HCV GT1 or GT2 infection treated with G/P (300/120mg) for 8weeks in the six Phase 2 or 3 overseas or Japan-only clinical trials were included. All patients who received ≥1 dose of G/P were included in an intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis. The objectives were to evaluate rate of sustained virologic response 12weeks post-treatment (SVR12) and safety of the 8-week regimen in the ITT population.RESULTS: Overall, SVR12 was achieved by 98.9% (889/899) of DAA-naive patients without cirrhosis, including 99.2% (597/602) of GT1-infected and 98.3% (292/297) of GT2-infected patients.Less than1% (2/899) of patients overall and no Japanese patients experienced virologic failure. SVR12 rate was >97% for patients regardless of baseline characteristics, and common comorbidities or co-medications. Overall, <1% (2/899) discontinued G/P due to an adverse event (AE) and 1.6% (14/899) of patients experienced a serious AE.CONCLUSIONS: 8-week G/P treatment is safe and efficacious in DAA-naive patients without cirrhosis and with HCV GT1 or GT2 infection, demonstrating high SVR12 rates regardless of baseline patient and disease characteristics.

This study evaluated treatment initiation, time to treatment, and real-world effectiveness of direct-acting antiviral therapy in individuals with hepatitis C virus infection treated during the first 2 years of availability of all-oral direct-acting antiviral therapies.A retrospective cohort analysis was undertaken using electronic medical records and chart review abstraction of hepatitis C virus-infected individuals aged >18 years diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C virus infection between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2015 from the Indiana University Health database.Eight hundred thirty people initiated direct-acting antiviral therapy during the 2-year observation window. The estimated incidence of treatment initiation was 8.8%±0.34% at the end of year 1 and 15.0%±0.5% at the end of year 2. Median time to initiating therapy was 300 days. Using a Cox regression analysis, positive predictors of treatment initiation included age (hazard ratio, 1.008), prior hepatitis C virus treatment (1.74), cirrhosis (2.64), and history of liver transplant (1.5). History of drug abuse (0.43), high baseline alanine aminotransferase levels (0.79), hepatitis B virus infection (0.41), and self-pay (0.39) were negatively associated with treatment initiation. In the evaluable population (n = 423), 83.9% (95% confidence interval, 80.1-87.3%) of people achieved sustained virologic response.In the early years of the direct-acting antiviral era, <10% of people diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C virus infection received direct-acting antiviral treatment; median time to treatment initiation was 300 days. Future analyses should evaluate time to treatment initiation among those with less advanced fibrosis.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.0218759\n\nView details for PubMedID 31437170\n\nAbstract\n\nIntroduction: Some direct-acting antiviral regimens for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection pose safety or efficacy concerns if coadministered with drugs containing ethinyl estradiol. The present analysis was conducted to examine the impact of concomitant oral contraceptive pills (OCP) or hormone replacement therapy (HRT) during treatment with elbasvir (EBR)/grazoprevir (GZR) in women with HCV genotype (GT)1 or GT4 infection.Methods: This is a post hoc, integrated retrospective analysis of female participants with HCV GT1 or GT4 infection who received EBR 50mg/GZR 100mg once daily for 12weeks in phase 2/3 clinical trials. The primary end point was sustained virologic response at 12weeks after therapy completion (SVR12). For this analysis, participants were stratified according to whether they received OCP or HRT during the original treatment study.Results: A total of 1,022 women with HCV GT1 or GT4 infection were included (receiving OCP/HRT, n=81; not receiving OCP/HRT, n=941). Most participants receiving OCP/HRT were treatment-naive (79%), noncirrhotic (91.4%), and aged >35years (71.6%). SVR12 rates were similar in women receiving OCP/HRT and those not receiving OCP/HRT (95.1% vs 96.3%). SVR12 rates remained high across all subgroups within the population receiving OCP/HRT: SVR12 rates were 94.6%, 100%, and 100% in participants with GT1a, GT1b, and GT4 infection, and all women aged 18-35years achieved SVR (21/21). Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 40.7% (33/81) and 30.1% (283/941) of women receiving and those not receiving OCP/HRT, respectively.Conclusion: The efficacy and safety of EBR/GZR administered for 12weeks was similar in women receiving OCP/HRT and those not on OCP/HRT. These data indicate that EBR/GZR can be safely used for the treatment of HCV GT1 or GT4 infection in women receiving concomitant OCP/HRT.\n\nView details for DOI 10.2147/IJWH.S203022\n\nView details for PubMedID 31819666\n\nAbstract\n\nCurrent estimates of the population-based disease burden of liver failure or end-stage liver disease (ESLD) are lacking. We investigated recent trends in hospitalizations and in-hospital mortality among patients with ESLD in the United States (US).A retrospective analysis was performed utilizing the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) from 2005 to 2014. We defined ESLD as either decompensated cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), criteria obtained from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision. Nationwide rates of hospitalization and in-hospital mortality were analyzed from 2005 to 2014.Hospitalization rates for decompensated cirrhosis during this period increased from 105.3/100,000 persons to 159.9/100,000 persons. In terms of HCC, hospitalization rates increased from 13.6/100,000 to 22.1/100,000. In patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)-related decompensated cirrhosis, the hospitalization rate increased from 13.4/100,000 to 32.1/100,000 with an annual incremental increase of 10.6%, a magnitude two-fold higher than other etiologies. The proportion of NAFLD among hospitalizations with ESLD steadily increased from 12.7% to 20.1% for decompensated cirrhosis while the proportion of chronic hepatitis C (HCV) and alcoholic liver disease (ALD) declined (29.3% to 27.6% for HCV; 39.0% to 37.4% for ALD). Although the overall in-hospital mortality rates for ESLD declined during the study, mortality rates for NAFLD-related decompensated cirrhosis showed no significant change.Among etiologies of chronic liver disease, NAFLD demonstrated the fastest growing rate of hospitalizations in non-HCC patients with ESLD in the US. Our study highlights the need for a focus on NAFLD-related hospitalizations and its impact on resource utilization. This article is protected by copyright.

PBC can cause debilitating symptoms including fatigue and pruritus and, if left untreated, is associated with a high risk of cirrhosis and related complications, liver failure, and death. Recent changes to the PBC landscape include a name change, updated guidelines for diagnosis and treatment as well as new treatment options that have recently become available. Practicing clinicians face many unanswered questions when managing PBC. To assist these healthcare providers in managing patients with PBC, the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) Institute for Clinical Research & Education, in collaboration with the Chronic Liver Disease Foundation (CLDF), organized a panel of experts to evaluate and summarize the most current and relevant peer-reviewed literature regarding PBC. This, combined with the extensive experience and clinical expertise of this expert panel, led to the formation of this clinical guidance on the diagnosis and management of PBC.\n\nView details for PubMedID 30429590\n\nAbstract\n\nGlecaprevir coformulated with pibrentasvir (G/P) is approved to treat hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and was highly efficacious in phase 2 and 3 studies. Treating HCV genotype (GT) 3 infection remains a priority, as these patients are harder to cure and at a greater risk for liver steatosis, fibrosis progression, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Data were pooled from five phase 2 or 3 trials that evaluated 8-, 12-, and 16-week G/P in patients with chronic HCV GT3 infection. Patients without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis were either treatment-naive or experienced with interferon- or sofosbuvir-based regimens. Safety and sustained virologic response 12 weeks post-treatment (SVR12) were assessed. The analysis included 693 patients with GT3 infection. SVR12 was achieved by 95% of treatment-naive patients without cirrhosis receiving 8-week (198/208) and 12-week (280/294) G/P. Treatment-naive patients with cirrhosis had a 97% (67/69) SVR12 rate with 12-week G/P. Treatment-experienced, non-cirrhotic patients had SVR12 rates of 90% (44/49) and 95% (21/22) with 12- and 16-week G/P, respectively; 94% (48/51) of treatment-experienced patients with cirrhosis treated for 16 weeks achieved SVR12. No serious adverse events (AEs) were attributed to G/P; AEs leading to study drug discontinuation were rare (<1%). G/P was well-tolerated and efficacious for patients with chronic HCV GT3 infection, regardless of cirrhosis status or prior treatment experience. Eight- and 12-week durations were efficacious for treatment-naive patients without cirrhosis and with compensated cirrhosis, respectively; 16-week G/P was efficacious in patients with prior treatment experience irrespective of cirrhosis status.

Current data regarding outcomes after donor-derived HCV in previously non-viremic liver transplant recipients are limited. Clinical data for adult liver transplant recipients with donor-derived HCV infection from March 2017 to January 2018 at our institution were extracted from the medical record. Ten patients received livers from donors known to be infected with HCV based on positive nucleic acid testing (NAT). Seven had a prior diagnosis of HCV and were treated before liver transplantation. All recipients were non-viremic at the time of transplantation. All 10 recipients derived hepatitis C infection from their donor and achieved sustained virologic response at 12 weeks post-treatment (SVR-12) with DAA-based regimens, with a median time from transplant to treatment initiation of 43 days (IQR 20-59). There have been no instances of graft loss or death, with median follow-up of 380 days (IQR 263-434) post-transplant. Transplantation of HCV-viremic livers into non-viremic recipients results in acceptable short-term outcomes. Such strategies may be used to expand the donor pool and increase access to liver transplantation. This article is protected by copyright.

Once-daily glecaprevir/pibrentasvir demonstrates high rates of sustained virologic response at 12 weeks posttreatment (SVR12) across all major HCV genotypes (GTs). This trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir for patients with chronic HCV GT1-6 infection who had received a liver or kidney transplant. MAGELLAN-2 was a phase 3, open-label trial conducted in patients who were ≥3 months posttransplant. Patients without cirrhosis who were HCV treatment-naive (GT1-6) or treatment-experienced (GT1, 2, 4-6; with interferon-based therapy with or without sofosbuvir, or sofosbuvir plus ribavirin) received glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (300/120 mg) once daily for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint compared the percentage of patients receiving glecaprevir/pibrentasvir with SVR12 to a historic SVR12 rate based on the standard of care. Safety of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir was assessed. In total, 80 liver transplant and 20 kidney transplant patients participated in the trial. Most patients had no or minimal fibrosis (80% had fibrosis scores F0-F1) and were infected with HCV GT1 (57%) or GT3 (24%). The overall SVR12 was 98% (n/N = 98/100; 95% confidence interval, 95.3%-100%), which exceeded the prespecified historic standard-of-care SVR12 threshold of 94%. One patient experienced virologic failure. One patient discontinued because of an adverse event considered to be unrelated to treatment; this patient achieved SVR12. Adverse events were mostly mild in severity, and laboratory abnormalities were infrequent.Once-daily glecaprevir/pibrentasvir for 12 weeks is a well-tolerated and efficacious, ribavirin-free treatment for patients with chronic HCV GT1-6 infection who have received a liver or kidney transplant.

Patients had <12-month life expectancies per the local investigator. Patients received daclatasvir 60 mg and sofosbuvir 400 mg once daily, with/without ribavirin, for 24 weeks. Sustained virologic response (SVR) at posttreatment week 12 (SVR12) was measured. Assessments adhered to local standards. One patient (prior Child-Pugh class C who improved to class B) enrolled by exemption was included in the overall data but not the class C cohort efficacy/safety data. Of the 77 treated patients, including 62 liver transplant recipients (genotype 1, n = 43, 69%; genotype 3, n = 16, 26%) and 14 patients with Child-Pugh class C cirrhosis (genotype 1, n = 4, 29%; genotype 3, n = 10, 71%), 63 (82%) completed treatment. SVR12 rates by modified intention-to-treat analysis (excluding nonvirologic failures lost to follow-up and withdrawal [consent/no reason]) in the overall, liver transplant, and Child-Pugh class C cohorts were 84% (n = 64/76), 90% (n = 56/62), and 62% (n = 8/13), respectively. Rates increased to 96% (n = 64/67), 97% (n = 56/58), and 89% (n = 8/9), respectively, in patients with available virologic data (including early discontinuations); 22/23 patients with genotype 3 (96%) achieved SVR12. Single cases of virologic nonresponse and relapse (both in liver transplant recipients with genotype 1) and viral breakthrough (Child-Pugh class C; genotype 3) occurred. Six patients died, 10 had adverse events leading to discontinuation, and 30 experienced serious adverse events. Conclusion: Daclatasvir plus sofosbuvir, with/without ribavirin, provided high SVR12 rates and was generally well tolerated in patients with life-threatening disease and high unmet needs.

We evaluated liver transplant waitlist trends and outcomes based on ethnicity and race in patients with PBC in the United States.METHODS: Using the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) registry, we collected data on patients with PBC on the liver transplant waitlist, and performed analysis with a focus on ethnicity and race-based variations clinical manifestations, waitlist mortality and LT rates from 2000 to 2014. Outcomes were adjusted for demographics, complications of portal hypertension, and Model for End-stage Liver Disease score at time of waitlist registration.RESULTS: Although the number of white PBC waitlist registrants and additions decreased from 2000 to 2014, there were no significant changes in the number of Hispanic PBC waitlist registrants and additions each year. The proportion of Hispanic patients with PBC on the liver transplant waitlist increased from 10.7% in 2000 to 19.3% in 2014. Hispanics had the highest percentage of waitlist deaths (20.8%) of any ethnicity or race evaluated. After adjusting for demographic and clinical characteristics, Hispanic patients with PBC had the lowest overall rate for undergoing LT (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% CI, 0. 60-0.83; P < .001) and a significantly higher risk of death while on the waitlist, compared to whites (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.15-1.74; P < .001). Furthermore, Hispanic patients with PBC had the highest proportion of waitlist removals due to clinical deterioration.CONCLUSIONS: In an analysis of data from UNOS registry focusing on outcomes, we observed differences in rates of LT and liver transplant waitlist mortality of Hispanic patients compared with white patients with PBC. Further studies are needed to improve our understanding of ethnicity and race-based differences in progression of PBC.\n\nView details for PubMedID 29427734\n\nAbstract\n\nGlecaprevir and pibrentasvir are direct-acting antiviral agents with pangenotypic activity and a high barrier to resistance. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of 8-week and 12-week courses of treatment with 300 mg of glecaprevir plus 120 mg of pibrentasvir in patients without cirrhosis who had hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 or 3 infection.We conducted two phase 3, randomized, open-label, multicenter trials. Patients with genotype 1 infection were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive once-daily glecaprevir-pibrentasvir for either 8 or 12 weeks. Patients with genotype 3 infection were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive 12 weeks of treatment with either glecaprevir-pibrentasvir or sofosbuvir-daclatasvir. Additional patients with genotype 3 infection were subsequently enrolled and nonrandomly assigned to receive 8 weeks of treatment with glecaprevir-pibrentasvir. The primary end point was the rate of sustained virologic response 12 weeks after the end of treatment.In total, 1208 patients were treated. The rate of sustained virologic response at 12 weeks among genotype 1-infected patients was 99.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 98 to 100) in the 8-week group and 99.7% (95% CI, 99 to 100) in the 12-week group. Genotype 3-infected patients who were treated for 12 weeks had a rate of sustained virologic response at 12 weeks of 95% (95% CI, 93 to 98; 222 of 233 patients) with glecaprevir-pibrentasvir and 97% (95% CI, 93 to 99.9; 111 of 115) with sofosbuvir-daclatasvir; 8 weeks of treatment with glecaprevir-pibrentasvir yielded a rate of 95% (95% CI, 91 to 98; 149 of 157 patients). Adverse events led to discontinuation of treatment in no more than 1% of patients in any treatment group.Once-daily treatment with glecaprevir-pibrentasvir for either 8 weeks or 12 weeks achieved high rates of sustained virologic response among patients with HCV genotype 1 or 3 infection who did not have cirrhosis.

The diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is typically made by multiphasic imaging studies demonstrating arterial enhancement with washout on arterial, portal venous, and delayed phase imaging. The aim of our study was to determine how the presence of TIPS would affect the imaging diagnosis of HCC.METHODS: This was a single-center electronic database review of all patients who underwent multiphasic imaging with MRI or CT scan for HCC screening between January 2000 and July 2017 and who were subsequently diagnosed with HCC. Data collected included patient demographics, liver disease characteristics including CPT score, MELD-Na, AFP, type of imaging, tumor stage, and lab values at the time of HCC diagnosis. The diagnosis of HCC was made using LI-RADS criteria on contrast-enhanced CT or MR imaging and confirmed by chart abstraction as documented by the treating clinician. Demographic and imaging characteristics for HCC patients with and without TIPS were compared.RESULTS: A total of 279 patients met eligibility criteria for the study, 37 (13.2%) of whom had TIPS placed prior to diagnosis of HCC. There was no significant difference in demographics or liver disease characteristics between patients with and without TIPS. Compared to cirrhotic patients with no TIPS prior to HCC diagnosis, patients with TIPS had significantly more scans with a longer duration of surveillance until HCC diagnosis. However, LI-RADS criteria and stage of HCC at diagnosis were not significantly different between both groups. There were no differences in outcomes including liver transplant and survival.CONCLUSION: The presence of TIPS does not lead to a delayed diagnosis of HCC. It is associated, however, with greater duration of time from first scan to diagnosis of HCC.\n\nView details for PubMedID 30592722\n\nAbstract\n\nTargeted cancer treatments offer the prospect of precise inhibition of tumor growth without the untoward off-target toxicity of traditional chemotherapies. Still, unintended, often idiosyncratic side effects, such as drug-induced liver injury, can occur. We discuss the case of a 26-year-old female with a history of ROS1-rearranged lung adenocarcinoma, undergoing treatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor crizotinib, who presented to our hospital with abdominal pain and scleral icterus. Liver chemistries were notable for hyperbilirubinemia (5mg/dL total) and marked transaminasemia (AST 1736 U/L, ALT >3500 U/L); liver biopsy demonstrated acute hepatitis with extensive necrosis. There was no evidence of an infectious or autoimmune etiology. It was discovered that the patient was taking a 500mg once daily dose of crizotinib, in lieu of the intended dose of 250mg twice daily. After immediate cessation of crizotinib therapy upon hospital admission, there was complete biochemical resolution of the hepatitis. This case highlights the potential reversibility of fulminant crizotinib-associated hepatoxicity, possibly related to supratherapeutic dosing, when managed with abrupt stoppage of the drug and initiation of supportive care.\n\nView details for PubMedID 30155324\n\nAbstract\n\nSignificant teratogenic effects have been demonstrated in all animal species exposed to ribavirin. Ribavirin is prescribed for chronic hepatitis C and is contraindicated in women who are pregnant and in the male sexual partners of women who are pregnant. Both sexes are advised to avoid pregnancy for 6 months after exposure. The Ribavirin Pregnancy Registry was established in 2003 to monitor pregnancy exposures to ribavirin for signals of possible human teratogenicity.This voluntary registry enrolls pregnant women with prenatal exposure to ribavirin. Exposure is classified as direct-women taking ribavirin during pregnancy or the 6 months prior to conception-or indirect-women exposed through sexual contact, 6 months prior to or during pregnancy, with a man who is taking or has taken ribavirin in the past 6 months. Women are followed until delivery and infants for 1 year. When enrollment is complete, birth defect rates will be compared with the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program's published rate of 2.67. Using data collected since inception in 2003 through February 2016, preliminary rates were calculated.The registry has enrolled 272 pregnant women, with 180 live births: there were seven birth defect cases among 85 directly exposed women [7/85 (8.2%) (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.4-16.2)] and four birth defect cases among 95 indirectly exposed women [4/95 (4.2%) (95% CI 1.2-10.4)]. Of the 11 infants, nine had structural defects and two had chromosomal anomalies. Patterns suggesting a common etiology or relationship with ribavirin exposure are not seen.Based on the patterns of birth defects reported, preliminary findings do not suggest a clear signal of human teratogenicity for ribavirin. However, the current sample size is insufficient for definitive conclusions, and ribavirin exposure should be avoided during pregnancy and during the 6 months prior to pregnancy, in accordance with prescribing information.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00114712.\n\nView details for PubMedID 28689333\n\nAbstract\n\nThis study assessed the efficacy and safety of ribavirin-free coformulated glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (G/P) in patients with hepatitis C virus genotype 3 infection with prior treatment experience and/or compensated cirrhosis, a patient population with limited treatment options. SURVEYOR-II, Part 3 was a partially randomized, open-label, multicenter, phase 3 study. Treatment-experienced (prior interferon or pegylated interferon ± ribavirin or sofosbuvir plus ribavirin ± pegylated interferon therapy) patients without cirrhosis were randomized 1:1 to receive 12 or 16 weeks of G/P (300 mg/120 mg) once daily. Treatment-naive or treatment-experienced patients with compensated cirrhosis were treated with G/P for 12 or 16 weeks, respectively. The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage of patients with sustained virologic response at posttreatment week 12 (SVR12). Safety was evaluated throughout the study. There were 131 patients enrolled and treated. Among treatment-experienced patients without cirrhosis, SVR12 was achieved by 91% (20/22; 95% confidence interval [CI], 72-97) and 95% (21/22; 95% CI, 78-99) of patients treated with G/P for 12 or 16 weeks, respectively. Among those with cirrhosis, SVR12 was achieved by 98% (39/40; 95% CI, 87-99) of treatment-naive patients treated for 12 weeks and 96% (45/47; 95% CI, 86-99) of patients with prior treatment experience treated for 16 weeks. No adverse events led to discontinuation of study drug, and no serious adverse events were related to study drug.Patients with hepatitis C virus genotype 3 infection with prior treatment experience and/or compensated cirrhosis achieved high SVR12 rates following 12 or 16 weeks of treatment with G/P. The regimen was well tolerated.

The efficacy and safety of 8- and 12-week treatments with glecaprevir (ABT-493; NS3/4A protease inhibitor) and pibrentasvir (ABT-530; NS5A inhibitor) were evaluated in non-cirrhotic patients with chronic HCV genotype 1-6 infection.SURVEYOR-I and SURVEYOR-II were phase II, open-label, multicenter, dose-ranging trials including patients with chronic HCV genotype 1-6 infection who were either previously untreated or treated with pegylated interferon plus ribavirin. Patients received once-daily glecaprevir plus pibrentasvir at varying doses with or without ribavirin for 8 or 12weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage of patients with a sustained virologic response at post-treatment week 12 (SVR12).Of the 449 patients who received varying doses of glecaprevir plus pibrentasvir, 25%, 29%, 39%, and 8% had HCV genotype 1, 2, 3, and 4-6 infection, respectively. Twelve-week treatment achieved SVR12 in 97-100%, 96-100%, 83-94%, and 100% in genotypes 1, 2, 3, and 4-6, respectively. Eight-week treatment with 300mg glecaprevir plus 120mg pibrentasvir in genotype 1-, 2-, or 3-infected patients yielded 97-98% SVR12 with no virologic failures. Three (0.7%) patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events; most events were mild (grade 1) in severity. No post-nadir alanine aminotransferase elevations were observed.Glecaprevir plus pibrentasvir was well tolerated and achieved high sustained virologic response rates in HCV genotypes 1-6-infected patients without cirrhosis following 8- or 12-week treatment durations.The combination of direct-acting antivirals glecaprevir and pibrentasvir comprise a once-daily, all-oral, pangenotypic treatment for HCV genotype 1-6 infection. This article describes results from two phase II trials investigating a range of doses at treatment durations of 8 or 12weeks in 449 patients without cirrhosis. Efficacy of the optimal dose, as determined by rates of sustained virologic response at post-treatment week 12, ranged from 92%-100%; treatment was well tolerated and significant laboratory abnormalities were rare.clinicaltrials.gov Identifiers: NCT02243280 and NCT02243293. http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT02243280, http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01939197.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jhep.2017.03.039\n\nView details for PubMedID 28412293\n\nAbstract\n\nPatients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1, 4, or 6, with or without cirrhosis, previously treated with peg-interferon and ribavirin, are a challenge to treat. We performed a phase 3 randomized controlled open-label trial to assess the effects of 12 or 16 weeks of treatment with once-daily elbasvir (an HCV NS5A inhibitor, 50 mg) and grazoprevir (an HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitor, 100 mg), in a fixed-dose combination tablet, with or without twice-daily ribavirin, in this patient population.We analyzed data from 420 patients (35% with cirrhosis, 64% with a null or partial response to peg-interferon and ribavirin) who were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to groups given elbasvir and grazoprevir once daily, with or without twice-daily ribavirin, for 12 or 16 weeks, at 65 study centers in 15 countries in Europe, Asia, and Central and North America. Randomization was stratified by cirrhosis status and type of peg-interferon and ribavirin treatment failure. HCV RNA was measured using COBAS TaqMan v2.0. The primary end point was HCV RNA <15 IU/mL, 12 weeks after completion of treatment (SVR12). We aimed to determine whether the proportion of patients achieving an SVR12 in any group was greater than the reference rate (58%).With 12 weeks of treatment, an SVR12 was achieved by 92.4% of patients given elbasvir and grazoprevir and 94.2% of patients given elbasvir and grazoprevir with ribavirin. With 16 weeks of treatment, an SVR12 was achieved by 92.4% of patients given elbasvir and grazoprevir and 98.1% of patients given elbasvir and grazoprevir with ribavirin. Among patients treated for 12 weeks without ribavirin, virologic failure occurred in 6.8%, 0%, and 12.5% of patients with HCV genotype 1a, 1b, or 4 infection, respectively. Among patients given elbasvir and grazoprevir for 12 weeks, virologic failure occurred in 0% of patients infected with HCV genotypes 1 and 4 who relapsed after completing peg-interferon and ribavirin, and 7.5% infected with HCV genotypes 1 and 4, respectively, with a null or partial response to peg-interferon and ribavirin. Among patients treated for 16 weeks who received ribavirin, there were no incidences of virologic failure. Common adverse events were fatigue (23.1%), headache (19.8%), and nausea (11.0%).The combination tablet of elbasvir and grazoprevir, with or without ribavirin, was highly efficacious in inducing an SVR12 in patients with HCV genotype 1, 4, or 6 infection failed by previous treatment with peg-interferon and ribavirin, including patients with cirrhosis and/or a prior null response. The treatment was generally well tolerated.

We performed a phase 3 randomized controlled open-label trial to assess the effects of 12 or 16 weeks of treatment with once-daily elbasvir (an HCV NS5A inhibitor, 50 mg) and grazoprevir (an HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitor, 100 mg), in a fixed-dose combination tablet, with or without twice-daily ribavirin, in this patient population.We analyzed data from 420 patients (35% with cirrhosis, 64% with a null or partial response to peg-interferon and ribavirin) who were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to groups given elbasvir and grazoprevir once daily, with or without twice-daily ribavirin, for 12 or 16 weeks, at 65 study centers in 15 countries in Europe, Asia, and Central and North America. Randomization was stratified by cirrhosis status and type of peg-interferon and ribavirin treatment failure. HCV RNA was measured using COBAS TaqMan v2.0. The primary end point was HCV RNA <15 IU/mL, 12 weeks after completion of treatment (SVR12). We aimed to determine whether the proportion of patients achieving an SVR12 in any group was greater than the reference rate (58%).With 12 weeks of treatment, an SVR12 was achieved by 92.4% of patients given elbasvir and grazoprevir and 94.2% of patients given elbasvir and grazoprevir with ribavirin.

The most common liver chemistries ordered are serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin.

Cholestatic injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of alkaline phosphatase level as compared with AST and ALT levels. The majority of bilirubin circulates as unconjugated bilirubin and an elevated conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or cholestasis. Multiple studies have demonstrated that the presence of an elevated ALT has been associated with increased liver-related mortality. A true healthy normal ALT level ranges from 29 to 33 IU/l for males, 19 to 25 IU/l for females and levels above this should be assessed. The degree of elevation of ALT and or AST in the clinical setting helps guide the evaluation.

In addition, a history of prescribed and over-the-counter medicines should be sought. For the evaluation of an alkaline phosphatase elevation determined to be of hepatic origin, testing for primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis should be undertaken. Total bilirubin elevation can occur in either cholestatic or hepatocellular diseases. Elevated total serum bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin fractions and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings.

We describe 2 open-label phase 2 studies investigating the efficacy and safety of ABT-493 plus ABT-530 with or without ribavirin (RBV) in GT1- or GT3-infected patients with compensated cirrhosis.Patients with GT1 infection received 200 mg ABT-493 plus 120 mg ABT-530 for 12 weeks. Patients with GT3 infection were randomized 1:1 to receive 300 mg ABT-493 plus 120 mg ABT-530 with or without once-daily 800 mg RBV for 12 weeks; treatment-experienced patients who were not treated with RBV received 16 weeks of therapy. Efficacy was measured by SVR12, defined as an HCV-RNA level less than 25 IU/mL. Adverse events and laboratory parameters were evaluated throughout the study.Twenty-seven patients with GT1 infection and 55 patients with GT3 infection were enrolled. The majority were treatment-naive (84%) and male (65%). In patients with GT1 infection, SVR12 was achieved by 96% (26 of 27; 95% confidence interval [CI], 82-99) of patients, with 1 relapse. Among GT3-infected patients, SVR12 was achieved in 96% (27 of 28; 95% CI, 82-99) of patients in the RBV-free arm (1 relapse), and in 100% (27 of 27; 95% CI, 88-100) in the RBV-containing arm. The most common adverse events were headache, fatigue, and nausea. Laboratory abnormalities were rare; no patient discontinued treatment.In cirrhotic HCV GT1- or GT3-infected patients, ABT-493 plus ABT-530 with or without RBV achieved SVR12 rates of 96%-100% and was well tolerated.

The phase 2 COSMOS study reported high SVR rates in treatment-naive and prior null-responder HCV genotype (GT) 1-infected patients receiving simeprevir+sofosbuvir±ribavirin for 12 or 24 weeks. OPTIMIST-1 (NCT02114177) was a multicenter, randomized, open-label study assessing the efficacy and safety of 12 and 8 weeks of simeprevir+sofosbuvir in HCV GT1-infected treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients without cirrhosis. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1; stratified by HCV GT/subtype and presence or absence of NS3 Q80K polymorphism [GT1b, GT1a with Q80K, GT1a without Q80K]), prior HCV treatment history, and IL28B GT [CC, non-CC]) to simeprevir 150 mg once daily+sofosbuvir 400 mg once daily for 12 or 8 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was SVR rate 12 weeks after end of treatment (SVR12). Superiority in SVR12 was assessed for simeprevir+sofosbuvir at 12 and 8 weeks versus a composite historical control SVR rate. Enrolled were 310 patients, who were randomized and received treatment (n = 155 in each arm). SVR12 with simeprevir+sofosbuvir for 12 weeks (97% [150/155; 95% confidence interval 94%-100%]) was superior to the historical control (87%). SVR12 with simeprevir+sofosbuvir for 8 weeks (83% [128/155; 95% confidence interval 76-89%]) was not superior to the historical control (83%). The most frequent adverse events were nausea, headache, and fatigue (12-week arm: 15% [23/155], 14% [22/155], and 12% [19/155]; 8-week arm: 9% [14/155], 17% [26/155], and 15% [23/155], respectively). No patients discontinued treatment due to an adverse event. One (1%, 12-week arm) and three (2%, 8-week arm) patients experienced a serious adverse event (all unrelated to study treatment).Simeprevir+sofosbuvir for 12 weeks is highly effective in the treatment of HCV GT1-infected patients without cirrhosis, including those with Q80K.

We performed a phase 2 study to determine the efficacy and safety of the combination of the nucleotide polymerase inhibitor sofosbuvir, the NS5A inhibitor velpatasvir, and the NS3/4A protease inhibitor GS-9857 in these patients.We performed a multicenter, open-label trial at 32 sites in the United States and 2 sites in New Zealand, from March 3, 2015 to April 27, 2015. Our study included 128 treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced patients (1 with HCV genotype 1b, 33 with HCV genotype 2, 74 with HCV genotype 3, 17 with genotype HCV 4, and 3 with HCV genotype 6), with or without compensated cirrhosis. All patients received sofosbuvir-velpatasvir (400 mg/100 mg fixed-dose combination tablet) and GS-9857 (100 mg) once daily for 6-12 weeks. The primary endpoint was sustained virologic response 12 weeks after treatment (SVR12).Following 6 weeks of treatment, SVR12s were achieved by 88% of treatment-naïve patients without cirrhosis (29/33; 95% CI, 72%-97%). Following 8 weeks of treatment, SVR12s were achieved by 93% of treatment-naïve patients with cirrhosis (28/30; 95% CI, 78%-99%). After 12 weeks of treatment, SVR12s were achieved by all treatment-experienced patients without cirrhosis (36/36; 95% CI, 90%-100%) and 97% of treatment-experienced patients with cirrhosis (28/29; 95% CI, 82%-100%). The most common adverse events were headache, diarrhea, fatigue, and nausea. Three patients (1%) discontinued treatment due to adverse events.In a phase 2 open-label trial, we found sofosbuvir-velpatasvir plus GS-9857 (8 weeks in treatment-naïve patients or 12 weeks in treatment-experienced patients) to be safe and effective for patients with HCV genotype 2, 3, 4, or 6 infections, with or without compensated cirrhosis.
