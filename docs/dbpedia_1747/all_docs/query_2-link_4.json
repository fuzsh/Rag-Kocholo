Here he studied at the university in Nice where he met Polish-Jewish refugee Jadwiga Alfabet. When the French police started arresting Jews in 1942 he married Jadwiga on September 5th, 1942 in an attempt to keep her from being deported. When in September 1943 deportation seemes inevitable, Paul managed to smuggle his wife, child and some relatives to Switserland.\n\nDo you have more information about this person?
