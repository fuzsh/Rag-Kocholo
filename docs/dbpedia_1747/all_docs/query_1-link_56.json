        "text": "May is Asian Heritage Month in Canada and the York University Athletics & Recreation Department is honouring its Asian athletes by showcasing their inspiring contributions over the course of the month.\n\nMen's wrestler Paul Nguyen is profiled this week. A third-year kinesiology & health science major, Nguyen only stands at 5'3\" – but as you will read today, his goals and aspirations increase his stature. He is eternally grateful for having the opportunity to attend university and compete as a varsity student-athlete. Outside of athletics, Nguyen is currently a marketing intern.\n\nHow did you get into high performance sport in the first place?\n\nI only got into wrestling because I didn't have any other options. My family has zero history in the sport. I'm a pretty small guy – in public school I wanted to join the track team or the basketball team, but all the coaches would deny me simply because of the fact that I was too small and frail. There were always bigger, faster, stronger, better kids than I was. I was 75 pounds and 4'11, and because there are weight classes in wrestling, I was able to join the team. The coach needed more bodies for his team. So I figured I could join and maybe even contribute relative to the other student-athletes. Lo and behold, I became the hardest worker on the team in my opinion.\n\nWhat's your greatest achievement to date? This month is about highlighting Asian contributions to Canada, so we want to talk about your successes!\n\nIn terms of athletics, there are a few things I've achieved in terms of accomplishments, but the biggest achievement in my mind is just being involved in intercollegiate sport. Having the opportunity to represent my school in this sport – and to represent the Asian community in a sport that doesn't have many – has been extremely rewarding for me. To add onto it, I will become the only person among my direct family and extended family to graduate from university. I have one more year and just finished my hardest semester, and I think if I can finish that I can definitely move onto bigger and better things. Just having the opportunity to be at university and to represent York as a student-athlete – I know that sounds small to a lot of people, but it has a lot more impact than it appears to have.\n\nIn an effort to learn more about the broad scope of Asian culture, tell me a unique way you celebrate your culture at home.\n\nI'm Vietnamese Canadian and my parents were born in Vietnam. There are times when we eat on the floor. We have tables and chairs to eat at, but it was a thing back in Vietnam where impoverished households didn't have tables or chairs to eat at. The floor would be the dining room. When we do that, it brings a lot of memories back from when I used to visit Vietnam as a kid. It helps me realize where my family came from. They weren't the most fortunate people, and it makes me grateful for them sacrificing everything to come here for a better life. I feel like not a lot of varsity student-athletes can say that because immigrants are not the most privileged. With any family of a different ethnic background, their families came here to live a better life. I think to be able to experience some form of culture from back home brings you down to Earth and makes you realize you're in a better spot. And that we should be grateful for that.\n\nWho or what gives you inspiration?\n\nEven though this is the shortest question, I feel like this is the answer that will have the most depth. It's a given that your inspirations are typically your parents. Although I haven't received the same support that a lot of other kids may receive from their parents. My dad especially believes in tough love. He wasn't affectionate while I was growing up. As I've gotten older, I've understood why this is was the case. In the end, they're my parents, and they've given everything for me. So I'm determined to give it back to them later down the line. I want to give them back ten-fold what they gave me, because I have lived a much better life here than I would have in Vietnam. Another inspiration are my two younger siblings. They are both autistic, so it's hard for me to be able to interact with them, but they do understand some things and are able to show some emotion. I want to be able to succeed for them – they are disabled, and I'm abled. It's not the easiest thing in the world to deal with family members who are sick or disabled, but it's just something I have to do. If they were able, they would do it for me too. Lastly, I'd say my biggest inspiration was my high school wrestling coach. He was always there for me and willing to provide support as a father figure and is still there for me today. He has given me a lot of insight into the world that was rough through his experience. He's Black, and he has gone through hell and back multiple times. The experience he has shared has opened my eyes to the things people of colour have to go through. Chris Kelman, if you're reading this, you're my inspiration, and I want to succeed for you.\n\nWhat are your hobbies and interests outside of athletics?\n\nOutside of athletics entirely, I enjoy spending time watching basketball and other sports, especially mixed martial arts. Hobbies – I work out a lot, just to keep up with programs especially during covid. I like to keep myself accountable and stay involved when I can't be involved in wrestling. Other hobbies I have are video games. I grew up on them. My cousins and I used to play a lot back then, and it's stuck with me growing up. Community service – in the past, I have volunteered at a community temple. I grew up as a Buddhist. I would organize prayers and set up events, I would help cook and clean, stuff like that. There were also summers that I would go up to this camp called Olympia Sports Camp with my assistant wrestling coach and help with the instruction. We haven't been able to do that recently, obviously, but I would like to get back to it.\n\nHow did the coaching come about? Was it something you always wanted to do?\n\nIn the first two years of high school, my high school coach actually brought me to a camp with a bursary, and after that point he wanted to give the bursary to other outstanding athletes. So his solution was bringing me back to the camp as an assistant coach where I could act as one of the adults and help with the teaching of younger athletes. By extension, I learned a lot more about wrestling, about myself, what I enjoyed about the sport. It just felt good being able to relay what I learned from my coach to the next generation. I think it's something I want to do in the future."
