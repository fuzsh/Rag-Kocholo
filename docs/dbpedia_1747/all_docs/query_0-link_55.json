The governance structure of the SSC must be reconstituted every four years, as per the IUCN Statutes.\n\nThe SSC Chair, in consultation with the Steering Committee, can establish various SSC Committees and Task Forces. The Chairs of these Committees or Task Forces are often members of the SSC Steering Committee. Additionally, the SSC Chair, in consultation with the Steering Committee, must appoint Chairs for the various SSC Specialist Groups at the beginning of each Quadrennium.

With a solid educational background in multilateral environmental conventions from the International University of Andalucia and biology from the University of Jordan, I uniquely combine my academic background with practical experience in nature conservation, leveraging these advantages to position myself as one of the leading professionals in West Asia. My professional journey has been vibrant, delving into the complexities of marine and terrestrial biodiversity and ecosystems, resulting in a profound understanding and extensive contributions to the conservation landscape. This foundation, coupled with my roles as a steering committee member and vice-chair at the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), specifically within the Species Survival Commission (SSC) and the Expert Assessment Group for the Green List (EAGL) focusing on the West Asia region, has honed my skills in strategic conservation planning and implementation. Furthermore, serving as an editorial board member at IUCN has allowed me to contribute to the dissemination of cutting-edge research and best practices in biodiversity and species conservation. I have published numerous peer-reviewed articles, each contributing to the growing body of knowledge aimed at protecting and restoring our planet's natural heritage. My overarching mission is twofold: to actively contribute to global conservation efforts, particularly in the Middle East region, and to mentor and inspire the next generation of conservation leaders, raising the expertise of Middle Eastern conservationists. Through my work, I have witnessed firsthand the challenges and opportunities facing conservation in the Middle East. The region, with its unique biodiversity and fragile ecosystems, is at a critical juncture where sustainable practices must be integrated into every aspect of development to ensure the well-being of both nature and communities. One of the key aspects of my work has been bridging the gap between scientific research and on-the-ground conservation action. Furthermore, I actively engage with policymakers, communities, and other stakeholders to promote dialogue and foster partnerships that can drive meaningful change. By bringing together diverse perspectives and expertise, we can develop holistic solutions that balance conservation goals with societal needs. Looking ahead, my vision is to continue advocating for nature conservation and sustainable development, with a focus on integrating scientific research, policy advocacy, and community engagement.\n\nWith over two decades of expertise in nature conservation and environmental protection, including specialized knowledge in biodiversity conservation, protected areas management, climate change ...\n\nMs Gabriela LICHTENSTEIN\n\nGabriela Lichtenstein is the Regional Vice-Chair for Meso and South America.
