Jonathon earned his B.S. in Physics and Mathematics in 2015 from the University of Minnesota, where he was active in Saint Paul’s Outreach. He first heard of the Oblates when reading Fr. Tim Gallagher’s Discernment of Spirits, and he was recommended to them by the campus minister at his university. He took the leap in August 2016 to begin seminary formation in Boston. He professed his perpetual vows in May 2023, and was ordained to the transitional diaconate in September 2023. In his free time, Dcn. Jonathon plays a lot of chess and enjoys outdoor activities such as hiking and camping.\n\nDcn. Jorge Sanchez, OMV\n\nBorn as the second of three children in Fullerton, CA, Dcn. Jorge later resided in Long Beach. He pursued his passion for film, earning an AA degree in Film from Cerritos College and gaining experience as an assistant on various film shoots. Dcn. Jorge’s journey towards the Oblates of the Virgin Mary began when he learned about their mission through his godparents, who celebrated their marriage at the OMV parish of St. Peter Chanel in Hawaiian Gardens, CA.\n\nA lover of film, Dcn. Jorge finds inspiration in the works of cinematic giants such as Charlie Chaplin, Alfred Hitchcock, and Christopher Nolan. Beyond his appreciation for the art of filmmaking, he also enjoys editing and writing scripts for films. He professed his first vows in August 2019.\n\nDcn. Jorge has already reached significant milestones in his journey. He took his final vows and was ordained as a transitional deacon in May and September 2023, respectively. These events marked key steps in his dedication to the Oblates of the Virgin Mary and his spiritual journey.\n\nBr. Christopher Puglia, OMV\n\nBr. Chris was born and raised in Townsend, Massachusetts, along with his younger brother. He earned a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Northeastern University in 2017.

He became Catholic during his freshman year of college at Arizona State University, where he studied Biochemistry. Shortly after his Confirmation, he felt the Lord calling him to discern the priesthood and eventually spent five years studying in Denver, CO for the Diocese of Phoenix. He later decided to step away from the diocesan formation and take some time to discern where God may be calling him, which led him to the Oblates, who he had met during his time in Denver. Andrew began his first year of postulancy in August of 2022.\n\nFr. Jay-Ar San Juan, OMV\n\nFr. Jay-Ar was born and raised in the city of Bandar Seri Begawan in the sultanate of Brunei Darussalam. His family are members of Couples for Christ, an international Catholic lay ecclesial movement originating from the Philippines, and he was a member of their Kids for Christ and Youth for Christ ministries. In 2008, his family migrated to Vancouver, Canada, where he earned an AA from Corpus Christi College and a BA from Christ the King Seminary. He first learned about the Oblates through the VISION Vocations Network, and was attracted to their spirituality and community life. Fr.
