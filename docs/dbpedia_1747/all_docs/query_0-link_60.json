        "text": "Generate is the one-stop shop for the Infrastructure Revolution. Together with our partners—the technology companies and project developers pioneering the Infrastructure Revolution—we are rebuilding the world. Generate has pioneered many emerging infrastructure asset classes, including battery storage; community, commercial, and industrial solar; energy efficiency; electric vehicles; fuel cells; wastewater treatment; distributed desalination; and organic waste management. We turn technology projects into infrastructure so customers don’t have to take risks they don’t want to take or spend money they don’t have.\n\nAs a trusted infrastructure provider, our singular goal is to provide the most reliable, sustainable, resilient energy and resource solutions. We beat the traditional utilities, who are typically slow to adopt new and innovative approaches, who are not incentivized to respond to customers’ ever-changing needs, and who aren’t working to win your business, and your trust, every day like we are. Whether you’re a city manager, a campus facilities operator, an energy manager, or a CFO, you can turn to us to help meet your resource and sustainability goals, however complex they may be. We have the expertise and experience to understand your needs. And we take on all of the risk—we use our capital, we pay all up-front costs, we take on the technical evaluation, and we manage the long-term operations—so you don’t have to."
