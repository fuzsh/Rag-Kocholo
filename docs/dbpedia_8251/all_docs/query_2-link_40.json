        "text": "The statistics in the chart above are based on Eurostat's Non-national population by group of citizenship, 1 January 2023. The next Eurostat update is expected in March 2025.\n\nAccording to Eurostat's Migration and migrant population statistics, as of 1 January 2023, there were about 402 800 third-country nationals (TCNs), representing 1.1% of the population, and another 32 600 EU citizens (0.1%) living in Poland at the time.\n\nIn 2021, 81.7% of first permits were issued for work reasons, 4.7% – for study purposes, and 1.2% - for family reunification, according to the European Migration Network (EMN)’s 2022 country factsheet for Poland. Overall, on 1 January 2022, according to Statistics Poland, 347 447 TCNs had temporary residence permits and 110 825 - permanent ones. Most TCNs that year came from neighbouring states Ukraine (73%) and Belarus (5%), as citizens of both these countries have easy access to the Polish labour market based on the employers’ declarations (which waive the requirement for a work permit) or the so-called based on(acquired through Polish ancestry or other proven ties with Poland as the country of origin). The share of immigrants from India and Georgia in Poland in 2021 was also relatively high (around 3% for each country).\n\nIn terms of citizenship, according to Statistics Poland , 10 122 people were naturalised in 2022, of whom 95% were TCNs. In terms of naturalisation, 7 176 TCNs received Polish citizenship in 2021, as opposed to 6 799 and 6 186 in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Other detailed statistical data is available in the EMN 2022 country factsheet for Poland, with insights about the age and gender of TCNs, the most common types of residence permits issued and international protection statistics.\n\nBy the end of March 2024, however, Poland counted a total of 955 520 non-EU citizens who had fled the war against Ukraine and were living in the country under temporary protection – see monthly updates in the numbers of temporary protection beneficiaries on Eurostat. According to data from the United Nations High Commissioner for refugees (UNHCR), however, the total number of people displaced by the war against Ukraine who applied for protection in Poland was close to 1.8 million by mid-May 2024.\n\nFinally, the OECD/EC Indicators of Immigrant Integration 2023: Settling In report provides further breakdowns of the composition of migrant populations and households in Poland, including in terms of immigration flows by legal category, concentration in densely populated areas, duration of stay and household composition.\n\nPoland does not have a dedicated integration strategy.\n\nIn 2020, the Inter-Ministerial Team for Migration developed a document entitled Migration Policy of Poland – Diagnosis of the Initial State. Based on this document, a strategy entitled Migration Policy of Poland - Directions for Action 2021-2022 was drafted, but it was not been adopted. One of the chapters in this document concerned the integration of foreigners.\n\nCurrently, the Expert Team for Social Inclusion Strategy, operating within the Prime Minister’s Office, works on a 5-year strategy concerning various groups at risk of exclusion, including foreigners, and especially beneficiaries of temporary protection from Ukraine.\n\nThis lack of national integration policy in Poland is somewhat made up for by the increasing cooperation between cities affiliated with the Union of Polish Metropolises and the multiplication of local integration policies in recent years. The city of Gdansk is a pioneer in the field.\n\nIn 2021, the Council for the Model of Migrant Integration in the Mazovian Voivodeship, established by Caritas Poland and composed of representatives of Mazovian public institutions and NGOs, prepared assumptions for the strategy of integration of migrants in the Mazowieckie Voivodeship.\n\nOn 24 October 2023, the Board of Directors of the region of Malopolska adopted the Programme of Integration of Immigrants in the Malopolska Region (Open Malopolska). This is the first document of its kind officially adopted at the regional level in Poland.\n\nIn 2014, the Supreme Audit Office (NIK) conducted an audit of Individual Integration Programmes for beneficiaries of international protection. The main conclusion of this audit, published in the report entitled Social Assistance for Refugees, was formulated as follows: ‘The social assistance system for beneficiaries of international protection operating in Poland does not ensure their proper integration into society and does not create conditions for them to lead an independent life’. The main objectives of integration – learning the Polish language or obtaining assistance in finding a job – are not sufficiently implemented. Support is mostly available contingent on cash benefits. There is a lack of monitoring of the situation of foreigners after the completion of integration programmes, so there are no tools to assess the effectiveness of the measures taken. The NIK study revealed that few beneficiaries of international protection manage to obtain permanent employment and that, following the completion of the integration programme, a significant part of them end up needing social assistance.\n\nThe Mazowieckie Province Governor’s Office used to prepare periodical internal evaluation reports. It concluded in 2015 that the 1-year period is too short for foreigners to gain sufficient levels of knowledge of the Polish language, be able to participate in local vocational training and find well-paid jobs that give them financial independence. The report also pointed out the lack of affordable housing – especially since waiting times for social housing can last several years – as a major barrier to social integration.\n\nBefore this internal evaluation, non-governmental organisations such as the Institute of Public Affairs and the Association for Legal Intervention conducted an assessment of the individual integration programmes in cooperation with the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy. The document entitled Poland’s Stop. The analysis of individual integration programmes for beneficiaries of international protection revealed similar findings. The authors of the analysis pointed to the need for more individualised programmes with a more active role allowed to the beneficiaries of international protection themselves.\n\nIn addition, the international Migrant Integration Policy Index (MIPEX) points out that, just like in most Central and Eastern European countries, migrants in Poland enjoy basic rights, but not equal opportunities, with policies generally unfavourable towards newcomers. The country’s approach to integration is therefore classified as providing ‘equality on paper’, with Poland scoring 40 out of 100 points on the MIPEX 2020 scale, with the average score being 49.\n\nFinally, Poland is one of the 14 countries included in the National Integration Evaluation Mechanism (NIEM) that measures refugee integration policies in 14 EU Member States and establishes a framework for evidence-based policy-making. Poland scores 36.9 across indicators on the NIEM scale of 100, thus being seen as a marginally supportive country.\n\nLaw on foreigners\n\nThe Polish Act on Foreigners of 12 December 2013 lays down the principles and conditions governing entry into, transit through, residence on and departure from the Polish territory. An important change related to integration was the introduction in 2018 of a Polish language requirement (B1 level) for obtaining a long-term EU resident’s residence permit.\n\nAsylum law\n\nThe Act of 13 June 2003 regulates the granting of all forms of international protection and provides for social assistance for the beneficiaries. Two major amendments respectively introduced the status of subsidiary protection in 2008 and the principles of resettlement and relocation in 2011.\n\nIntegration law\n\nPoland does not have a self-standing integration law.\n\nChapter 5 of the Act on Social Assistance, adopted in March 2004, regulates the Individual Integration Programmes for beneficiaries of international protection. An amendment of 2008 granted beneficiaries of subsidiary protection the right to participate in the 1-year programmes which were previously reserved for beneficiaries of international protection alone.\n\nCitizenship law\n\nThe Act on Polish citizenship of 2 April 2009 regulates ways of acquiring and losing Polish citizenship. In 2017, a major amendment granting foreigners the right to apply for citizenship after 1 year of residence based on a permanent residence permit issued in connection to Polish origin or a valid Card of the Pole was introduced. Previously, the waiting period was of respectively 2 and 3 years.\n\nAnti-discrimination law\n\nThe Act of 3 December 2010 implementing certain EU regulations concerning equal treatment specifies areas and methods of counteracting violations on equal treatment. It covers discrimination on the grounds of sex, race, ethnic origin, nationality, religion, denomination, beliefs, disability, age or sexual orientation. No major amendments have been made so far.\n\nAct on assistance to Ukrainian citizens\n\nThe Act of 12 March 2022 on assistance to Ukrainian citizens in connection with the armed conflict on the territory of the country sets out specific rules for the legalisation of the residence of beneficiaries of temporary protection, as well as their employment and other entitlements."
