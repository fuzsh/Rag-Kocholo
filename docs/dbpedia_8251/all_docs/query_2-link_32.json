        "text": "What did you want to address in this study?\n\nUnderstanding the local epidemiology of vaccine-preventable diseases is critical for establishing prophylactic measures. Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) cases should be reported to the national surveillance system. We compared the reported case numbers with the number of patients hospitalised for TBE to see how complete the reporting is and also compared them with other European countries; a large difference might indicate that cases in Poland are underestimated.\n\nWhat have we learnt from this study?\n\nOur findings suggest that the number of cases of TBE in Poland are underestimated, because more patients were hospitalised for TBE than recoded by the surveillance. Suboptimal use of laboratory diagnostics to identify of TBE cases, was one of the probable causes.\n\nWhat are the implications of your findings for public health?\n\nTBE is Poland's most common cause of viral encephalitis; therefore, efficient and high-quality monitoring of its occurrence is essential for planning adequate prophylactic measures. We should raise awareness among hospital managers and the National Health Fund to expand diagnostics for central nervous system infections, including TBE.\n\nData sources and statistical analysis\n\nNIPH NIH-NRI reports were the primary source of data in this study. Data on hospitalisations from the NGHMS, collected by NIPH NIH-NRI as directed by the Ministry of Health, were used for comparative analysis. The survey and the epidemiological surveillance system were based on the ICD-10 classification of diseases [19]. We also used data from European countries collected by ECDC. The notification rates for TBE are given per 100,000 inhabitants. The period analysed for European data ranged from 2015 to 2020, where available [20,21]. However, it should be noted that the definition of a confirmed case of TBE is not the same in all countries.\n\nThe NIPH NIH-NRI data included national and regional epidemiological data of encephalitis or meningitis cases reported to the surveillance system [17,18]. The analysed period was 2008 to 2020. Data until 2019 refer to confirmed cases and for 2020, the analysed data refer to confirmed and probable cases. We used the probable cases as a proxy for the maximum number of all cases, temporarily awaiting confirmation.\n\nThe NIPH NIH-NRI organised the NGHMS as directed by the Ministry of Health. The data included in the analysis refer to the number of hospitalisations for tick-borne encephalitis (A84), viral encephalitis (A86), and meningitis (A87) for the years 2008 to 2020. The research from which the data on hospitalisations are derived is part of the survey ‘Hospitalisation’ covered by the Programme of Public Statistical Research. It collects unit data on all hospitalised cases in Poland in the scope compliant with the general hospital statistical card. Data on hospitalisations are collected regardless of a patient's place of residence, citizenship or insurance status. The transferred data are anonymous; they do not include personal details or other identifiers such as the patient’s insurance number. The obligation to provide data for the survey applies to entities performing medical activity subordinate to the Ministry of Health, Ministry of National Defence, and Ministry of Interior and Administration, except for facilities included in the Council of Ministers' ordinance. It lists inpatient hospices and psychiatric hospitals, among others.\n\nWe conducted a comparative analysis to assess the consistency of national epidemiological data from NIPH NIH-NRI with data from the NGHMS; we also analysed differences in reporting between regions. The collected data were analysed using a spreadsheet. Bar graphs, line graphs, and cartograms were used for data visualisation, and MS Excel version 2019 was used for data analysis.\n\nComparison between data from the epidemiological surveillance system and the NGHMS in Poland\n\nBetween 2008 and 2020, respectively 3,016 and 3,620 cases of TBE (A84) were reported to the surveillance system and hospitalisations database. The case numbers reported for unspecified viral meningitis (A86) were 1,332 and 3,474, respectively. shows an increasing number of TBE hospitalisations reported in the NGHMS across the analysed period, while the NIPH NIH-NRI reports demonstrate the opposite. illustrates the case numbers for unspecified viral meningitis for both databases.\n\nNGHMS: Nationwide General Hospital Morbidity Study; NIPH NIH-NRI: National Institute of Public Health NIH – National Research Institute.\n\nCases registered as per IDC10 code A84 for viral encephalitis: tick-borne.\n\nNGHMS: Nationwide General Hospital Morbidity Study; NIPH NIH-NRI: National Institute of Public Health NIH – National Research Institute.\n\nCases registered as per IDC10 code A86 for viral encephalitis: unspecified.\n\nBetween 2013 and 2014, NIPH NIH-NRI changed the definition of a confirmed TBE case by [22,23]. Since 2014, it has been possible to classify a confirmed case based on detection of TBEV RNA in blood by RT-PCR; however, this method is only used to a limited extent. In addition, the neutralisation test criterion was removed from the laboratory criteria in 2014 as it is very rarely used in practice because there is no reference laboratory for arboviral infections in Poland and the associated costs are high [23,24]. Cases of TBE and unspecified viral encephalitis ratios between numbers reported by both databases, are shown in and .\n\nAt the beginning of the study period 2008 to 2012, differences between the number of TBE cases reported by NIPH NIH-NRI and NGHMS were small. In the following years (2013–2015), the number of cases recorded by NGHMS was smaller than in the NIPH NIH-NRI reports. This trend was reversed in 2016. The difference in the number of TBE cases reported to the NGHMS and NIPH NIH-NRI became considerable (mean difference: five cases in the period 2008–2015 vs 112.8 cases in 2016–2020). According to NGHMS data, the annual number of TBE-related hospitalisations increased from 127 in 2015 to 396 cases in 2016 (more than threefold). In the NIPH NIH-NRI reports the number of cases increased by 90% (149 in 2015 vs 283 in 2016). The difference between the systems reached 113 cases in 2016, which corresponds to 40% of the total cases reported to NIPH NIH-NRI.\n\nInterestingly, in the period 2016 to 2020, there was a substantial difference in the number of hospitalisations for TBE (A84) between NIPH NIH-NRI and NGHMS ( ). In those 5 years, the cumulative difference reached 564 cases, more than reported to the surveillance system yearly. A similar phenomenon was observed for unspecified viral encephalitis, with a difference of 371 cases reported between 2018 and 2020 ( ). As shown in , there has also been a notable decrease in viral meningitis cases (A87) reported to the NGHMS since 2018. In 2018, 1,550 cases were recorded in the NGHMS, and in 2020, the number of recorded cases decreased by almost a thousand (a 69% decrease) [17].\n\nNGHMS: Nationwide General Hospital Morbidity Study.\n\nCases registered as per ICD-10 code A87 for viral meningitis.\n\nDuring the first pandemic year, 2020, the discrepancies between the TBE cases reported to the analysed databases were the largest in the whole study period. The NGHMS recorded 354 hospitalisations for TBE. Compared with the beginning of the observation period, this was an increase by 149 cases (73%). The number in 2020 was 11% lower than the historical maximum recorded in 2016 and 280% higher than the historical minimum recorded in 2015. At the same time, unspecified viral encephalitis cases in 2020 decreased to a historical minimum. For more details please refer to and .\n\nThe number of hospitalised TBE patients in 2020 reported in NGHMS was 2.23 times higher (by 123%) than the number reported to the national surveillance (NIPH NIH-NRI). The reporting rate in the pre-pandemic year 2019 was much higher: 82% of hospitalised cases were also reported to the NIPH NIH-NRI. In contrast, at the beginning of the analysed period in 2008, the difference between the cases reported to NIPH NIH-NRI and NGHMS was negligible, with an excess of only 1%. There was, however, a period (2013–2015) during which the number of cases reported to NIPH NIH-NRI was higher than recorded in NGHMS.\n\nThe discrepancies in reporting during the first year of the pandemic were also observed for other viral neuro-infections. In 2019, NGHMS recorded 2.97 times the number of unspecified viral meningitis cases than NIPH NIH-NRI, and this difference increased to nearly five-fold in 2020 (103 vs 21 cases). In contrast, the number of cases reported by NGHMS in 2008 was only 1.39 times the number reported to NIPH NIH-NRI.\n\nThe ratio of reported cases of unspecified viral encephalitis vs TBE in the NIPH NIH-NRI database was consistently below the rate in NGHMS, suggesting a different proportion of cases reported to NIPH NIH-NRI from both groups of encephalitis ( ). At the beginning of the study period, the ratio was 1.13 for NGHMS and 0.83 for NIPH NIH-NRI, a historical maximum for the latter. In the NGHMS data, the historical maximum was in 2014, with a ratio of 2.04. The ratio decreased from 2018 to 2020 and reached 0.29 for NGHMS and 0.13 for NIPH NIH-NRI, the historical minimum for both databases; this represents a 50% decrease. For more details about the number of cases reported to the surveillance and the hospitalizations databases by ICD_10 codes, please refer to Supplementary Table S1.\n\nNGHMS: Nationwide General Hospital Morbidity Study; NIPH NIH-NRI: National Institute of Public Health NIH – National Research Institute.\n\nCases registered as per IDC10 code A84 for viral encephalitis: tick-borne and code A86 for encephalitis cases: unspecified.\n\nCase numbers and serological tests for tick-borne encephalitis in different regions of Poland\n\nWe analysed the number of TBE diagnostic tests performed to investigate whether the regional variation in testing corresponded with the number of reported cases. The endemicity of TBE in some regions might be related to a higher number of diagnostic tests performed. Two procedures were included in the analysis – F84 and F85, detecting, respectively, TBEV-specific IgG antibodies and IgM antibodies. The data demonstrated a link between the number of tests performed in a region and reported TBE cases ( and ). For further reference on the geographical distribution of TBE and other viral CNS infections, we provide that information in the Supplementary Figures and Tables S2–S4.\n\nNGHMS: Nationwide General Hospital Morbidity Study; TBEV: tick-borne encephalitis.\n\nNGHMS: Nationwide General Hospital Morbidity Study; TBEV: tick-borne encephalitis.\n\nThe number of F84 procedures performed in 2020 was highest in Podlaskie voivodeship, which is known to be a hyperendemic region for TBE with an annual incidence > 5 per 100,000 population; the second-highest number of tests was performed in Wielkopolska, while Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship ranked third. From 2017 to 2019, the total number of tests performed increased, with an average annual growth rate of 19%. From 2019 to 2020 (COVID-19 pandemic period), there was a marked reduction in the number of F84 tests performed, from 603 procedures in 2019 to 297 in 2020 (a 51% decrease). The voivodeships with the highest number of F85 procedures performed were Podlaskie, Łódź Voivodeship and Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship. There was also an increase in the number of tests performed from 2017 to 2019, with an average annual growth rate of 19%. In contrast to the F84 procedure, there was a drastic decrease (by 42%) in 2020. A similar regional distribution may be found in the case of IgM antibody testing. Again, Podlaskie voivodeship performed most tests ( ). Four of 16 voivodeships used 0 tests per 100,000 inhabitants, whereas only five, including Podlaskie region, conducted more than one test per 100,000 habitants."
