        "text": "Rental income and capital gains of Polish real estate\n\nTaxpayerBasis of taxTax leviedTax rates (2024)\n\nRental income\n\nIndividuals\n\nRental income is taxed as ordinary private or business income.\n\nLiability to tax\n\nRental income derived by individuals may be subject to taxation in different forms:\n\na tax on recorded revenue - in case of private lease,\n\na tax on recorded revenue, a flat tax and a personal income tax according to general rules -in case of performing business activity.\n\nBasis to tax\n\nTaxation of rental income by individuals is conditioned by reached revenue threshold. If the annual revenue on rental does not exceed PLN 100 000, then 8.5% tax rate applies. The surplus over PLN 100 000 is taxed at a rate of 12.5%. In this case, the tax base consists of income without deducting any costs. This rules applies to both private and business rental income.\n\nHowever, in case of business income, if taxation on general principles is chosen a flat tax rate of 19% or progressive tax rates of 12% or 32% are applied. In such cases the taxable base is income constituted by revenues minus the tax-deductible costs. Individuals are not able to depreciate residential buildings and residential premises.\n\nCompanies\n\nRental income is taxed as ordinary business income.\n\nLiability to tax\n\nRental income earned by companies is subject to corporate income tax and taxed as ordinary business income.\n\nBasis to tax\n\nIf the value of sales revenue (along with amount of the due VAT) does not exceed an equivalent in PLN of EUR 2 000 000 both in the previous and current tax year or when the taxpayer starts his business activity (in the year of beginning), a company is subject to corporate income tax at a flat rate of 9%.\n\nOther companies are subject to corporate income tax at a flat rate of 19%. The tax base in both cases is income equal to revenue less the tax-deductible costs. Companies are not able to depreciate residential buildings and residential premises.\n\nCapital gains\n\nIndividuals\n\nCapital gains resulting from the sale of real estate are taxed within the scope of personal income tax. Capital gains arising from the sale of real estate within five years of purchase are taxed at a flat tax rate of 19%. The sale of real estate after the end of 5 years holding period is exempted from taxation.\n\nLiability to tax\n\nCapital gains are subject to personal income tax. Capital gains derived from the sale of real estate are exempt from tax if an individual - upon its sale, has been in possession of the real estate for at least five years counting from the end of the year in which it was purchased.\n\nBasis of tax\n\nA flat-rate income tax applies to capital gains at a rate of 19%. The revenue derived from the sale of a real estate doesn't fall within aggregation with revenues reached from the other sources. Sales revenue is decreased by tax-deductible costs represented by the purchase price and transaction costs, as well as expenses for renovation etc.\n\nCompanies\n\nRevenues derived from sale of real estate are not considered as capital gains (which is a separate source of revenues) and are taxed as usual business income.\n\nLiability to tax\n\nSale of a real estate is subject to corporate income tax. Such income is taxed at a rate of 19% or a decreased rate of 9%.\n\nBasis of tax\n\nRevenue derived from the sale of real estate is decreased by tax-deductible costs incurred in order to achieve revenues or to maintain or secure a source of revenues. These are the underappreciated parts of a real estate, transaction costs and expenses for renovation and improvement.\n\nReal property company\n\nA real property company is defined as an entity other than a natural person, obliged under the accounting regulations to prepare a balance sheet, in which:\n\nin the case of entities starting their activity:\n\non the first day of the tax year at least 50% of the market value of its assets is the market value of real estate located in Poland or rights to such real estate, and;\n\nthe market value of such real estate exceeds PLN 10 000 000 (ca. EUR 2,3m).\n\nin the case of other entities:\n\nas at last day of the year preceding the tax year, at least 50% of the book value of assets is the book value of real estate located in Poland or rights to such real estate, and;\n\nthe balance value of such real estate exceeds PLN 10 000 000 (ca. EUR 2,3m), and;\n\nin case of the real property company not being a taxpayer of income tax, in the previous tax year the company obtained at least 60% of tax revenues from (sub)lease, of real estate and agreements of similar nature or from ownership rights relating to real estate/other real property companies.\n\nReal property companies:\n\nhave additional reporting obligations,\n\nfall within the scope of application of real estate clause,\n\nare obliged to tax on the profit obtained by the shareholders from the sales of shares.\n\nLiability to tax\n\nSale of shares (or rights and obligations of similar nature) in real property company is subject to corporate income tax. Such income is taxed at a rate of 19%.\n\nBasis of tax\n\nRevenue derived from sale of real estate is value expressed in the price specified in the sales contract. If the price without a justified reason significantly deviates from the market value of these items or rights, the revenue shall be determined by the tax authority in the amount of market value. If a real property company does not have information about the value of the transaction, the fair market value of shares in the company subject to transaction should be taken as the basis of tax.\n\nPlace of effective management\n\nPolish CIT regulations contain the definition of \" place of effective management\". A company registered outside Poland may be considered a Polish tax resident when:\n\npersons or entities sitting in control bodies, constituting or managing the taxpayer,\n\nthey actually handle the current affairs of this taxpayer.\n\nIn order to determine whether a taxpayer has a management board in Poland, it should be examined whether its current affairs are conducted on the basis of, in particular:\n\na contract, decision, court ruling or other document regulating the establishment or functioning of that taxpayer, or\n\npowers of attorney granted, or\n\nconnections within the meaning of transfer pricing regulations).\n\nIf a foreign company actually has a place of effective management in Poland, it is subject to taxation on its entire income in Poland. This means that the company is obliged to pay income tax, submit an annual declaration and make advance payments for income tax in Poland.\n\nPolish VAT & transfer taxes\n\nTaxpayerBasis of taxTax leviedTax rates (2024)Resident individualRental incomeValue Added Tax23%/8%*Transfer of real estateTransfer Taxes2%Non-resident individualRental revenue (income) Value Added Tax23%/8%*Transfer of real estateTransfer Taxes2%Resident companyRental incomeValue Added Tax23%/8%*Transfer of real estateTransfer Taxes2%Non-Resident company Rental incomeValue Added Tax23%/8%*Transfer of real estateTransfer Taxes2%\n\n*Sale of a real estate is subject to the VAT against a rate of 23% as a rule.

The sale of private property is not subject to VAT.\n\nExempt from the VAT is a sale, which is not affected as part of the first settlement, or if between the first settlement and the delivery of a building elapsed at least two years. If certain conditions are met, the exemption might be opted out. The seller and purchaser may relinquish the above-mentioned tax exemption on some conditions specified in the VAT Act.\n\nIf the above-mentioned exemption cannot be applied, a tax exemption may be applied if the seller did not have the right to deduct VAT when acquiring a real estate, and has not made any expenses for its improvement - exceeding 30% of real estate's value, from which they would have deducted VAT.\n\nSale of a real estate is subject to the VAT against a rate of 23%. However residential estates up to 150 m2 (flats) and 300 m2 (buildings) are taxed at a rate of 8%. Rental income is taxed at a rate of 23%.\n\nInteraction with transfer tax\n\nAs a rule, if the delivery of real estate is exempt from the VAT, then the obligation arises to pay transfer tax (in Poland: podatek od czynności cywilnoprawnych - PCC). This rule does not apply if the subject of sales agreement is a residential premises constituting a separate property, taxed at a 6% tax rate (please see details in “Transfer taxes”).\n\nThe purchaser of a real estate is committed to pay the tax which amounts to 2% of real estate's market value, except for special situations in which the tax is 6% (please see details in “Transfer taxes”).\n\nCompanies\n\nThe same rules apply as for individuals.\n\nTransfer taxes\n\nIndividuals\n\nTransfer tax is a tax on the passing of real estate from one person or company to another where the supply of real estate is exempt from the VAT. Transfer tax is also applicable when the supply of real estate will be classified as the supply of an enterprise or as an organised part of the enterprise.\n\nLiability to tax\n\nTransfer tax applies by the sale of real estate or proprietary law and their trade. Transfer tax is paid by the purchaser within 14 days from signing the sale agreement.\n\nBasis of tax\n\nMarket value of real estate is subject to tax.

Minimum tax is calculated and based only on the area of buildings actually subject to lease.\n\nBasis of tax\n\nTaxon revenues from buildings amount to 0.035% of building's worth a month which is 0.42% a year. The tax base is the value of the real estate on the first day of the month as per fixed asset register. The tax allowance is PLN 10 000 000 (ca.

EUR 3,9m) achieved in a given month.\n\nThe tax is progressive with two tax rates:\n\n0.8% of the tax base - in the part in which the tax base does not exceed PLN 170 000 000 (ca. EUR 38,9m);\n\n1.4% of the excess of the tax base over PLN 170 000 000 - in the part in which the tax base exceeds PLN 170 000 000.\n\nCompanies\n\nThe same rules apply as for individuals.\n\nVehicles for Polish real estate\n\nCommonly used vehicles for Polish real estate\n\nLimited\n\nA limited liability company (in Poland: spółka z ograniczoną odpowiedzialnością - sp. z o. o.) is a private limited company which has legal personality. The company itself is a separate entity from the company's stakeholders. Income tax is paid both at the level of the company (corporate income tax) and at the level of the company's stakeholders - here the tax is levied on a profit distribution (dividend).\n\nPartnership & joint ventures\n\nReal estate may be owned either by an individual or a private limited company (i.e. limited liability company or public corporation). Many entities can invest in real estate. There is no distinction between taxation of joint ventures, individuals or partnerships.\n\nLimited partnerships\n\nLimited partnership is a partnership which has got no legal personality (in Poland: spółka komandytowa - sp. k.). Two categories of partners are distinguished: general partners (responsible for the company’s obligations without any restrictions) and limited partners (responsible for the company’s obligations only to the level of a limited liability amount). By establishing a limited partnership, partners determine the amount of contributions, the limited partner determines additionally the limited liability amount.\n\nLimited partnerships are corporate income tax payers.\n\nThe profits achieved by the limited partners are double-taxed - once when they are achieved by the partnership and a second time when they are paid to the partners (as in case of a limited liability company).\n\nThe amendment provides for the exemption of an amount equal to 50% of the revenue obtained by a limited partner from a share in the profit of a limited partnership, but not more than PLN 60 000 (ca. EUR 13k). However, the exemption does not apply to all limited partners.\n\nGeneral partners of limited partnerships may deduct from income tax, calculated on income from a share in the profits of a limited partnership, the amount of tax paid by that partnership, in proportion the general partner’s share in such partnership’s profit.\n\nProfit achieved by a limited partnership will be taxed at a rate of 19% or a decreased rate of 9%.\n\nSole proprietorship\n\nAn individual who sells and buys real estate permanently and in an organised manner, should set up a sole proprietorship (in Poland: jednoosobowa działalność gospodarcza) and settle the income and the VAT on the basis of a business activity.\n\nSole proprietorship is a business activity of an individual who is unlimitedly liable for all the payables, both with sole proprietorship assets and his personal property. The taxpayer, as provided for by law is an individual himself.\n\nForeign partnership\n\nNon-residents are subject to tax only on the income (revenue) derived in Poland, within the scope of limited tax obligation. Having real estate in Poland leads to a fixed establishment (for VAT purposes) and might lead to the permanent establishment in Poland (for CIT purposes).\n\nThe same rules apply to the legal entities and their income derived in virtue of possessed real estates.\n\nFiscal unity\n\nAs provided for by law, it is possible to form a tax capital group (in Poland: podatkowa grupa kapitałowa - PGK) as a result of signing a contract between at least two private limited companies (i.e. limited liability companies or public corporations) that have Polish tax residence and remain in capital relationships. The holding company is required to have a direct shareholding of 75% of the capital of other companies from the group. PGK applies only to corporate income tax. In such a case the group is taxed on the surplus of profits and losses of all entities in the group. In case the group suffers a loss, it dissolves as of the next fiscal year.\n\nFiscal unity can be also used not only for CIT purposes but also for VAT purposes (under some conditions).\n\nPolish holding company\n\nLimited company can act as holding company if it meets conditioned specified in the definition of holding company:\n\nholds, directly on the basis of ownership, at least 10% of shares (shares) in the capital of the subsidiary,\n\nis not a company forming a tax capital group,\n\ndoes not benefit from the tax exemptions through activity in the Special Economic Zone or on the basis of a decision on support,\n\nconducts actual business activity,\n\nshares (shares) in this company are not held, directly or indirectly, by a shareholder (shareholder) having its registered office or management board or registered or located in countries and territories that engage in harmful tax competition, indicated in the EU list of non-cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes or with which the Republic of Poland has not ratified an international agreement.\n\nUnder some conditions, the Polish holding company would be exempt from tax on:\n\ndividend (100% value of dividend) obtained from subsidiaries;\n\nincome on a disposal of shares in subsidiaries.\n\nSpecific real estate vehicles for Polish real estate\n\nReal estate investment trusts - REIT\n\nReal Estate Investment Trust (REIT) is a special purpose vehicle or investment fund established to invest in the market of commercial and rental real estates (in Poland: firma inwestująca w najem nieruchomosci- FINN), which is a company investing in real estates' rental. Instead of direct purchase of real estate, the purchaser invests his capital in shares of FINN. Frequency of dividend pay-outs is provided for by law. FINN has not become effective in Polish legal system yet.\n\nFunds for joint account\n\nInvestment funds may invest directly in proprietary interests, including real estates. They are a type of closed-end investment funds, so that they offer investors investment certificates, that can only be purchased periodically during the usually non-public offer.\n\nReport on execution of a tax strategy\n\nReal property companies, as well as other companies, will be required to prepare and publish a report on execution of a tax strategy if their revenues in the tax year exceed 50m euros. The reports should include, among others:\n\nthe approach to processes and procedures for managing the tax-related obligations,\n\nthe number of provided information on tax schemes,\n\nthe number of provided information on tax schemes,\n\ntransactions with related entities, the value of which exceeds 5% of the balance sheet total,\n\nsubmitted applications for a tax ruling, binding VAT rate information (WIS) and binding excise information (WIA)\n\nrestructuring activities planned or undertaken by the taxpayer.\n\nTaxpayers should publish an information on the implemented tax strategy for the tax year (prepared in Polish or its translation into Polish) on their website by the end of the twelfth month following the end of the tax year. Taxpayers should also provide relevant information to the tax office. A consequence of non-compliance with this obligation may result in a penalty of up to PLN 250 000 (ca. EUR 57k)."
