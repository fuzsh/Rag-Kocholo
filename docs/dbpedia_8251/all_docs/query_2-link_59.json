        "text": "1824Â - At 22 years of age John Cadbury opens his first grocerâs shop next door to his fatherâs drapery and silk business at 93 Bull Street, a fashionable part of Birmingham, England. John Cadbury sells hops, mustard and a new sideline â cocoa and drinking chocolate made with cocoa beans imported from South and Central America and the West Indies.\n\n1831Â - With growing sales of cocoa and drinking chocolate, Cadbury decides to produce hem on a larger scale. He rents an old warehouse in Crooked Lane, Birmingham to use as a factory.\n\n1842Â - Cadbury is now selling 16 kinds of drinking chocolate and 11 kinds of cocoa.\n\n1847Â - Cadbury rents a larger factory in the centre of Birmingham in Bridge Street. His brother Benjamin Cadbury joins him and the business becomes Cadbury Brothers of Birmingham.\n\n1853Â - Cadbury Brothers open a sales office in London.\n\n1854Â - Cadbury Brothers receive their first Royal Warrant on 4 February as âmanufacturers of cocoa and chocolate to Queen Victoria.â\n\n1856Â - A more established chocolate company, Fry, proves to be tough competition for Cadbury Brothers. Business declines and the partnership dissolves. John Cadbury takes over sole ownership of the struggling firm.\n\n1861Â - John Cadbury is in poor health and hands the reigns of the business to his sons Richard and George Cadbury. The young men are just 25 and 21 years old respectively. They struggle to keep the business and work hard at promoting their goods to the trade. Their dedication, in addition to innovative new products and quality improvements, help the business survive and prosper.\n\n1866Â - The turning point for the young Cadbury brothers is a new processing technique and the resulting product: Cadbury Cocoa Essence. The new cocoa press, purchased from a Dutch manufacturer, squeezes out much of the cocoa butter from the beans so it is no longer necessary to put starches in the cocoa. The Cadbury brothers are the first British chocolate manufacturer to use this new process. The marketing of Cadbury Cocoa Essence as âAbsolutely Pure, Therefore Bestâ helped sales increase dramatically.\n\n1879Â - Now employing 200 people, Richard and George Cadbury need a bigger factory. Instead of looking at another city location they chose a greenfield site four miles from the centre of Birmingham on what would be called Bournville Lane. There are practical business reasons why this site is appealing: canal and rail links, roads and water supply. Also, the workers can live in far better conditions than in the crowded slums of Birmingham. Production begins on this âfactory in a gardenâ in September.\n\n1897Â - Using left over cocoa butter from its drink powder, Cadbury produces its first milk chocolate bar for eating. However, the bar is dry and not sweet enough to be successful.\n\n1899Â - Richard Cadbury dies and the business becomes a private limited company: Cadbury Brothers Limited. George Cadbury becomes chairman of the new board. By this time the Bournville factory has more than 2,600 employees.\n\n1919Â - For many years Cadbury has had close links with U.K. chocolate maker J.S. Fry and Sons Limited. The two companies sign an agreement to create a new holding company, the British Cocoa and Chocolate Company, which takes over the assets of both businesses.

It is named Somerdale.\n\n1921Â - Cadbury becomes an international company when its first overseas factory opens in Tasmania. Other factories soon follow in Canada, Dublin and South Africa.\n\n1939Â - The second World War begins. During the war, rationing is enforced and raw materials are in short supply. The company produces Ration Chocolate made with dried skimmed milk powder.\n\n1949Â - Cadbury opens a factory in India.\n\n1953Â - Wartime rationing comes to an end in the United Kingdom and full supplies of sugar and full cream milk are again available. During the 1950âs Cadbury expands its product range, undertakes a lot of promotional work and manages to fend off competitors by keeping its direct distribution system.\n\n1955Â - Cadbury launches its first television advertising on 22 September with an ad for drinking chocolate.\n\n1964Â - Cadbury acquires the London-based confections business of James Pascall, maker of chocolate Ã©clairs.\n\n1967Â - The holding company British Cocoa and Chocolate Company changes its name to Cadbury Group Ltd.\n\n1969Â - Cadbury Group Ltd. merges with Schweppes Ltd. to create Cadbury Schweppes plc.\n\n1970sÂ - The Cadbury chocolate business experiences a decade of unprecedented sales growth, partially due to hugely successful and memorable television advertising campaigns.\n\n1980Â - Dominic Cadbury becomes managing director of the UK Confectionery Division and institutes the biggest revolution of Cadburyâs UK factories since the rebuilding of Bournville in the 1920s. The number of production lines decreases from 78 to 33 in a Â£110 million investment which replaces aging equipment with state-of-the-art production technology.\n\n1988Â - Cadbury Schweppes acquires Chocolat Poulain, maker of the number 3 chocolate brand in France at that time. This is the first major acquisition in Cadburyâs new strategy of growth through acquisition.\n\n1989Â - Cadbury Schweppes acquires both Trebor Group Ltd â maker of Trebor and Maynards sugar confections â and Bassett Foods plc â the maker of Bassetts licorice.\n\n1990Â - Trebor and Bassett merge to form Trebor Bassett Ltd.\n\n1995Â - Cadbury Schweppes acquires Allan Candy, including the Sour Patch trademark in Canada.\n\n1997Â - Cadbury Schweppes acquires Jaret International, including the Sour Patch trademark, in the U.S.\n\n2000Â - Cadbury Schweppes acquires Hollywood, a leading French chewing gum brand.\n\n2002Â - Cadbury Schweppes acquires Dandy A.S. of Denmark, including Stimorol, Dirol and V6 gum brands.\n\n2003Â - Cadbury becomes the worldâs number one confectionery company ( and number 2 in chewing gum) with the acquisition in March of U.S.-based Adams chewing gum business. This includes Halls, Dentyne, Trident brands and the Bubbas bubble gum range.\n\n2005Â - Cadbury Schweppes acquires U.K. premium organic chocolate brand Green & Blackâs.\n\n2008Â - Cadbury and Schweppes de-merge effective 7 May, separating the confections and beverages businesses into two companies.

This move eventually makes Kraft a household name throughout the world.\n\n1915Â - J.L. Kraft & Bros. Co. begins producing process cheese in 3-1/2 ounce and 7-3/4 ounce tins.\n\n1916Â - J.L. Kraft receives a U.S. patent for his method of producing process cheese in tins.\n\n1921Â - J.L. Kraft & Bros. Co. headquarters is now located at 400 Rush Street in Chicago, Illinois.\n\n1924Â - J.L. Kraftâs sales operation shows its first signs of global expansion when Kraft establishes a sales office in London.\n\nJ.L. Kraft & Bros. Co. changes its name to Kraft Cheese Company.
