        "text": "Here’s where you get started with human resources best practices and hiring in Poland.\n\nCurrency of Poland\n\nPolish Zloty (PLN)\n\nThe Capital of Poland\n\nWarsaw\n\nTime Zone in Poland\n\nGMT+1\n\nImportant Facts About the Country of Poland\n\nIntroduction to Poland\n\nPoland, officially called the Republic of Poland, is a country in Central Europe. It is divided into 16 administrative provinces and has a population of just under 38 million people. The capital city Warsaw (‘Warszawa’) is also the economic and political center of the country. As a result of a state-paid university system, many workers are highly qualified and specialized. This is especially true in the fields of IT and engineering.\n\nWhat to Know about Poland's Geography\n\nPoland covers an area of 313,000 square kilometers, making it the ninth largest country in Europe. Poland has a border with Germany to the west, with the Czech Republic and Slovakia to the south and with Ukraine, Belarus, Lithuania and Russia to the east and northeast.\n\nClimate in Poland\n\nPoland has a moderate climate characterized by relatively cold winters and warm summers.\n\nThe Culture of Poland\n\nPoland’s traditions and customs are based on a history with origins in the Slavic culture. The church affiliation has influenced the holidays and traditions, forming an essential part of Polish culture. Family values are also very important in Polish society. Most Poles speak more than one language because of the country’s proximity to many other countries. Notably, most Poles speak English at least at a conversational level.\n\nReligions Observed in Poland\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church is the largest church in Poland with the majority (around 95%) of the population being Roman-Catholic. Approximately 75% of the population attends church services regularly.\n\nPolish Human Resources at a Glance\n\nEmployment Law Protections in Poland\n\nPoland’s Labor Code is the key legal act regulating relations between employers and employees. It sets out conditions under which work can be executed in Poland. Employment contracts cannot be less advantageous to the employee than the regulations provided in the Labor Code and any secondary regulations issued thereto.\n\nKey Points – Employers in Poland should prepare for:\n\nan ever-evolving tax and social security system\n\nstrong presence and high activity of trade unions (in the case of major employers)\n\nlabor courts sensitive to employee rights\n\nstrict EU data protection regulations (e.g. hindering the transfer of personal data outside of the EU)\n\nThe rights and obligations of both employees and employers are defined in the following sources of labor law:\n\nThe Constitution of the Republic of Poland, which defines general principles of freedom to work and social rights\n\nThe law established by the appropriate bodies of the European Union in the scope of labor law\n\nInternational agreements concerning labor law issues\n\nLabor Code,\n\nActs and secondary legislation, defining the employees’ and employers’ rights and obligations\n\nProvisions of collective labor agreements and other agreements, rules, procedures and statutes setting forth the rights and obligations of the parties to the employment relation\n\nThe mutual rights and obligations of both parties are also defined in an employment contract.\n\nEmployment Contracts in Poland\n\nThe employment contract is concluded in writing. If the employment contract is not concluded in writing, the employer will be obliged to confirm to the employee in writing the arrangement as to the contracting parties, the type of the contract and employment terms before admitting them to work.\n\nMinimum requirements for inclusion in a contract of employment:\n\nthe contracting parties\n\nthe type of contract\n\nthe date of its conclusion\n\nthe conditions of work and remuneration, in particular:\n\nthe type of work\n\nthe place of work\n\nthe remuneration for work corresponding to the type of work, with indication of the remuneration components\n\nthe working hours\n\nthe start date of work\n\nAdditionally, the employer must notify the employee in writing about other conditions of pay indicated in the Labor Code within seven days from concluding the employment agreement. All changes to the conditions of work and pay require a written form.\n\nPoland's Contract Terms\n\nThe following types of the employment contract are recognized in the Polish Labor Code, with unlimited-term contracts being most typical:\n\na contract of employment for a probationary period\n\na contract of employment for an indefinite term\n\na contract of employment for a fixed term\n\nAn employee who has been employed with an employer for at least six months will be able to request (once per calendar year) a change in the type of employment, the type of contract for an indefinite period, or full-time employment. The employer should, as far as possible, accommodate such a request from the employee. The employer must respond to the request no later than one month from the date of receipt of the request, and in the event of a refusal, with reasons for the refusal.\n\nPoland's Guidelines Regarding Probation Period/Trial Period\n\nAn employment contract for a trial period can be entered into for no more than three months in order to check the employee’s qualifications and whether he can be employed to carry out a specific type of work. After the trial period, the parties are not allowed to conclude another contract for a trial period, except when the employee is to be employed in order to carry out a different type of work.\n\nFor fixed-term contracts, the maximum length of the probation period is dependent on the period of the contract:\n\nLess than six months: One month\n\nAt least six months and less than 12 months: Two months\n\nAt least 12 months or an indefinite period: Three months\n\nRegulations and Rules Regarding Working Hours in Poland\n\nIn Poland, the working time may not exceed 8 hours per day and 40 hours in an average five-day working week in the agreed settlement period, which does not exceed, as a rule, 4 months. At GoGlobal, a one-month settlement period applies. The weekly working time including overtime cannot exceed an average of 48 hours in the adopted settlement period. Every employee is entitled to uninterrupted daily rest of at least 11 hours.\n\nOvertime\n\nWorking overtime is allowed in two situations only:\n\nif overtime work is necessary to conduct a rescue operation in order to protect human life or health, to protect the property or to protect the environment.\n\nin the case of special needs of the employer. It is the employer who assesses whether there special needs have occurred that justify working overtime.\n\nThe regulations on the daily rest period have an indirect effect on the maximum daily hours of overtime. Working hours plus overtime may not exceed 13 hours per day due to the necessity to ensure that an employee receives 11 hours of daily rest. The maximum number of overtime hours per year may not exceed four hours per day or 416 hours per calendar year.\n\nOvertime is paid at 150% of normal hourly remuneration for work on weekdays and on Saturdays.\n\nHealth and Safety in the Workplace\n\nThe Constitution of the Republic of Poland states that everyone is entitled to safe and hygienic work conditions. This principle has been specified in the Labour Code, which states that both the employer and the employee have obligations in the field of health and safety at work.\n\nEmployers are required to provide employees with adequate training in health and safety regulations. This training should be conducted before an employee is permitted to start working, and should be repeated periodically throughout their employment. By doing so, employers can ensure that their workers have the necessary qualifications and skills to work safely and avoid any workplace accidents or injuries. This includes providing employees with sufficient knowledge of the regulations and rules of health and safety at work.\n\nHealth and safety training that should be provided:\n\nInitial training, which is organized on the first day.\n\nHealth Checks\n\nEvery employee must undergo an initial medical examination (“badania wstępne” before starting work and then a periodic examination (“badania okresowe”) before the initial check’s expiry date (roughly after 2-4 years from the initial check). In certain situations, an employee will also be required to complete a check-up examination (if the employee has been signed off sick for at least 30 calendar days). In such case, they will need to complete a check-up examination before coming back to work.\n\nRules Regarding Bonus and 13th Month Pay in Poland\n\nIt is common practice in Poland for employees to be awarded with bonuses. Although the law does not regulate bonuses, usually they are divided into awards of a discretionary nature (so employees cannot effectively claim them) and bonuses which can be claimed by employees.\n\nBonuses are awarded to employees on the fulfillment of objective criteria. This is outlined in the employment contract, employer’s internal labor law regulations or other documents.\n\nTermination\n\nPolish law maintains detailed rules regarding the unilateral termination (with notice and with immediate effect) served by both employers and employees. These regulations vary depending on the type of employment contract. A contract of employment can be terminated:\n\nby mutual agreement of the parties\n\nby a statement of will issued by one of the parties with a period of advance notice (‘termination of a contract of employment with notice’)\n\nby a statement of will issued by one of the parties without a period of advance notice (‘termination of a contract of employment without notice’)\n\nupon expiry of the agreed contract term\n\nGrounds: An employer that terminates the open-ended employment contract or fixed-term contract, or terminates the employment with immediate effect must specify the reasons for termination, which must be concrete, justified and real. The termination letter must detail all the reasons for termination as it is not possible to later bring up other reasons before the court. In the case of termination with immediate effect, Polish law counts the reasons for termination.\n\nEmployees subject to termination laws: Polish law provides for general protection against dismissal, which is granted to all employees engaged under open-ended contracts. Special protections against termination may also apply due to an employee’s life situation or the specific role the employee holds.\n\nProhibited or restricted terminations: There are statutory limitations on an employer’s right to unilaterally terminate the employment relationship with some groups of employees due to their age (e.g. employees who will reach retirement age in less than four years), life situation (e.g. due to pregnancy, when using maternity leave, paternity leave, parental leave and childcare leave, during sick leave, holiday leave) or the function they hold (e.g. trade union leaders and works council members).\n\nThird-party approval for termination/termination documents: In the case of protected employees, the restriction on termination may require the employer to seek the consent of certain bodies for the termination of employment. For example, they may need to seek a trade union’s consent for summary dismissal of a pregnant employee.\n\nIn the termination of an open-ended employment contract with notice or termination with immediate effect with an employee represented by the trade union, the employer must notify the trade union in writing on the intended termination and the reasons for the termination. The trade union’s opinion is not binding for the employer.\n\nMass layoff rules: There is a special procedure for terminations in the case of collective redundancies. This applies to employers engaging at least 20 employees and terminating employment on grounds not related to individual employees. Collective redundancies cover the dismissal of at least:\n\n10 employees in entities normally employing less than 100 employees\n\n10% of the employees in entities normally employ at least 100, but fewer than 300 employees\n\n30 employees in entities normally employing at least 300 employees.\n\nUnfair dismissal: In the case of unlawful or unjustified termination with or without notice, an employee can claim reinstatement to work on the previous conditions or compensation in the limited amount specified in the statutory regulations.\n\nPoland's Requirements Regarding Notice Periods\n\nThe period of notice for an employment contract set for an indefinite period of time depends on the employment period with a given employer. The notice period amounts to:\n\ntwo weeks if the employee has been employed for less than six months\n\none month if the employee has been employed for at least six months\n\nthree months if the employee has been employed for at least three years\n\nThe period of notice for a contract of employment concluded for a probationary period is:\n\nthree working days if the trial period is not longer than two weeks\n\none week if the trial period is longer than two weeks\n\ntwo weeks if the trial period is set at three months\n\nGarden Leave: The employer may exempt the employee from the obligation to perform work until the lapse of the notice period upon termination of the employment contract. During the period of exemption, the employee will retain the right to remuneration.\n\nIf the annual leave is not used by the date of termination of the employment contract, the employee is entitled to a cash equivalent.\n\nRedundancy/Severance Pay in Poland\n\nSeverance pay is necessary for individual terminations of employment for reasons unrelated to the employee (by employers engaging at least 20 employees). Severance pay is granted to redundant employees based on their length of service with their current employer as follows:\n\n1 month’s salary if the service period is less than 2 years\n\n2 months’ salary if the service period is between 2 and 8 years\n\n3 months’ salary if the service period is 8 years or more.\n\nSeverance pay cannot exceed 15 times the minimum wage (4,242 PLN as of January 2024 ) (minimum wage will rise to 4,300 PLN on July 2024.)\n\nPost-Termination Restraints / Restrictive Covenants\n\nNon-competes\n\nThe Labour Code explicitly allows for the parallel employment of an employee with another employer. The employer cannot prohibit such employment unless a non-compete agreement is concluded. Non-competition agreements with key employees can be considered.\n\nIn the absence of a non-competition agreement, employee’s additional employment cannot be a reason justifying the termination of the employment contract.\n\nParties to an employment relationship can enter into a non-compete agreement which will be effective during the term of employment, as well as after the employment relationship has ceased. A non-compete agreement must be concluded in writing in order to be valid. A non-compete agreement effective after the termination of employment must specify the period of prohibition of competition, the scope of the non-compete restriction and the amount of compensation due to the employee. The compensation must not be lower than 25% of the remuneration received by the employee prior to the termination of the employment relationship for a period corresponding to the period of validity of the prohibition of competition. Polish law allows such compensation to be paid in monthly instalments.\n\nCustomer non-solicits\n\nStatutory prohibition to induce the employer’s clients to terminate, not to fulfil or improperly fulfil their contractual duties with an aim for the inducing person to gain benefits for him/herself or for a third party or to cause damage to the employer.\n\nEmployee non-solicits\n\nNon-solicitation of employee clauses are invalid based on case law as they violate the right to free choice of employment. No person may be prohibited from exercising their profession.\n\nPolish Timesheets\n\nIn 2019, the European Court of Justice stated companies must set up an objective, reliable and accessible system to record the working time of their employees.\n\nTrade Unions / Collective Agreements in Poland\n\nFreedom of association in trade unions is guaranteed to anyone engaged in gainful employment in Poland.\n\nMembership in a trade union is voluntary. No one can suffer negative consequences due to their membership in a trade union. Trade unions represent both collective and individual rights and the interests of employees. In respect of collective rights and interests, trade unions represent all employees regardless of their union membership (e.g. they conclude collective bargaining agreements, arrangements, agree on work regulations, remuneration, the company social benefits fund, etc.).\n\nIf a trade union operates in the workplace, it may request an employer adopt workplace or remuneration regulations. This applies if the employer has between 20 and 49 employees. The content of the workplace and remuneration regulations must be agreed with the trade unions, if one operates at the entity.\n\nFixed Term Contacts for Polish Employees\n\nFixed Term Contacts for Polish Employees\n\nA contract of employment for a fixed term, and the total period of employment where multiple consecutive fixed-term contracts are concluded between the same parties in the employment relationship, must not exceed 33 months. A maximum of three consecutive fixed-term contracts are allowed.\n\nIf the period of employment on the basis of a fixed-term contract or contracts of employment is longer than 33 months (or if the number of fixed-term contracts is greater than three) then, from the day following the lapse of that period or from the date of conclusion of the fourth fixed-term contract of employment, the employee is deemed to be employed under an indefinite-term employment contract.\n\nThere are four exemptions, when fixed-term employment contracts can exceed the period or number mentioned above:\n\nfor the replacement of an employee during their justified work absence\n\nfor the purpose of performing work of ad hoc or seasonal nature\n\nfor performance of work for a term of office\n\nif the employer indicates objective reasons attributed to specific business needs\n\nIn point four above, the need must serve a real periodic demand and be necessary in consideration of all the circumstances of the conclusion of the contract. This also applies to the situation where a fixed-term employment contract (which would have been terminated after the end of the third month of pregnancy) has been extended until the date of childbirth. The relevant district labor inspector must be notified in writing by the employer when concluding a fixed-term employment contract.\n\nTax and Social Security Information for Employers in Poland\n\nPersonal Income Tax in Poland\n\nIn 2024, Poland applies a progressive income tax scale to individuals as follows:\n\nAnnual Income Rate Up to 120,000 12% minus *tax-reducing amount PLN 3,600 over PLN 120,000 PLN 10,800 plus 32% of any amount over PLN 120,000\n\n*The tax-reducing amount in 2024 will be settled monthly, in the amount of PLN 300 (PLN 3600 /12).\n\nPolish employers must deduct tax from their employees’ taxable salary and pay it to the tax office by the 20th day of the month following that for which the tax is payable. Annual returns must generally be filed by employees (and tax due paid) by April 30th of the following year, stating all sources of income and showing any additional tax due.\n\nSocial Security in Poland\n\nIn Poland, social security contributions consist of pension, disability, accident and sickness insurance. Social security contributions are compulsory and payable by employers. The contributions are financed by both employers and employees. Employers must deduct the appropriate amounts from the employee’s salary and pay the contributions monthly to the social security office by the 15th day of the month following that for which they are payable. The amounts of contributions for each type of insurance are:\n\nType of Insurance Paid by Employer (%) Paid by Employee (%) Total (%) Pension Fund* 9.76 9.76 19.52 Disability Fund* 6.50 1.50 8.00 Bridging Pension Fund (FEP) 0.00 or 1.50 0.00 0.00 or 1.50 Health Fund 0.00 9.00 9.00 Illness Fund 0.00 2.45 2.45 Accident Fund** 0.67 – 3.33 0.00 0.67 – 3.33 Employees’ Guaranteed Benefits Fund 0.10 0.00 0.10 Labour Fund 2.45 0.00 2.45 PFRON (State Fund for Rehabilitation of the Disabled) 1.00 (estimated, subject to revision every quarter) 0.00 1.00 Total (up to limit) 20.48 – 24.64 13.71 33.19 – 35.85\n\n* Once an individual’s gross remuneration exceeds 30 average estimated national salaries for a given year (PLN 208 050.00 for 2023), contributions toward these funds cease.\n\n** Accident fund contributions are calculated based on the number of individuals registered for accident insurance and the activity of the payer specified under the employer’s statistical REGON number (according to the Polish Classification of Business Activities-PKD). The level of the accident fund is determined through the decision of social security authorities.\n\nThe above rates serve as a broad guideline. Actual rates charged by GoGlobal will differ.\n\nImportant Information for Polish Employees\n\nSalary Payment\n\nEmployees are typically paid their salaries on a monthly basis in Poland. The labor code provisions stipulate that remuneration will be paid to employees to the bank account of their choosing. Cash payments to employees are only possible if the employee specifically requests it.\n\nPayslip\n\nEmployers may provide payslips to their employees online.\n\nAnnual Leave\n\nStatutory minimum holiday leave is either 20 or 26 days in a calendar year, depending on the employee’s employment record. Employees who have worked for less than ten years are entitled to 20 days while employees who have worked for at least ten years are entitled to 26 days. The period based on which holiday entitlement is calculated accounts for education. For example, graduation from university counts as eight years’ employment. For the period of leave, the employee is entitled to the remuneration they would receive if they were working during that time.\n\nThe employer grants leave to the employee in the calendar year in which the employee acquired the right to it. As part of holiday leave, the employer is required to grant leave (of not more than four days per calendar year) on the dates specified by the employee.\n\nCarry Over Rules\n\nOverdue leave should be used by the end of the third quarter of the following calendar year.\n\nSick Leave\n\nAll individuals, including foreign citizens, employed in Poland under a contract of employment or a contract of mandate are registered with the Polish National Health Fund (NFZ) and entitled to healthcare benefits. Contributions to NFZ are deducted every month from the employee’s income.\n\nEmployees who are unable to work due to illness or injury are entitled to time off if they justify their absence from work by providing the employer with a medical certificate (sick leave note – zwolnienie lekarskie). Polish employees cannot self-certify their illness in order to receive sick pay.

Most other individuals will need a visa to stay in the country as well as a permit to work.\n\nThere are several types of visas available for non-EU citizens seeking entry into Poland for employment purposes, including:\n\nWork Permit (Type A): This permit is required for foreigners who work for a Polish employer.\n\nWork Permit (Type C or E): This permit is available for those sent to work in Poland through an intra-company transfer.\n\nBusiness visa (Schengen Visa C or D)\n\nFreelance/entrepreneur visa\n\nWork Permits\n\nProcedure for obtaining approval: The employer must provide several documents to obtain a work permit on behalf of a foreign employee. Work permits are issued by the province governor (‘voivode’ or ‘wojewoda’) for the employer’s registered office.\n\nThe province governor issues a work permit for a fixed-term not exceeding three years. In the case of managers (management board members), a work permit can be issued for up to five years.\n\nA work permit can be issued by the province governor if both:\n\nThe foreign national’s remuneration is not less than the remuneration paid to a Polish employee in a similar role.\n\nThe district governor (‘starosta’) confirms the vacancy cannot be filled by a person registered as unemployed or seeking employment – or if the recruitment organized for the employer turns out to be ineffective.\n\nSeveral exceptions to these requirements exist within specific regulations.\n\nA work permit is issued on the employer’s request and the documents to be provided include:\n\nA completed application form\n\nEvidence of payment of application fees\n\nConfirmation of the legal status of the employer from the National Court Register\n\nCurrent records of the employer’s economic activity\n\nCopies of the applicant’s passport pages with relevant travel information\n\nConfirmation that the applicant has health insurance\n\nA deed for the company\n\nA copy of a statement regarding profits or losses sustained by the employer\n\nA copy of a contract in accordance with the service being provided in Poland\n\nThe employment contract with the foreign national must strictly reflect the conditions relating to employment duration, workplace and the employee’s role.\n\nTime frame: It usually takes up to 6 months for a work permit to be obtained.\n\nForeign nationals must also legalize their residence in Poland by obtaining a temporary residence permit if their stay in Poland is to exceed three months. This is subject to certain exceptions. A temporary residence (‘karta pobytu’) in Poland can be obtained if the employee can demonstrate they will be staying in Poland for more than three months in order to work. Permission for temporary residence is normally granted for a maximum of two years. A residency permit can then be renewed every subsequent two years.\n\nGetting a Tax Number\n\nThe PESEL number (Polish acronym for “Universal Electronic System for Registration of the Population”) must be obtained by foreigners wanting to stay in Poland for longer than a few months. This applies whether the individual is an EU citizen or not. An employee can be hired without the PESEL number. However, the employer will need it soon after employment commences to fulfill their obligations of paying insurance and taxes.\n\nAnyone who registers their address will be granted this important identification number. In Poland, any person who wishes to stay in Poland for longer is obliged to register where they live with the local City Council (‘Urząd Miasta’). Polish and EU citizens have three months to register their new place of living and non-EU citizens need to fulfill this requirement within 30 days from the day they arrive in Poland. Once that requirement is fulfilled, the local government automatically generates the PESEL number and sends the document to the provided address.\n\nPublic Holidays Recognized by Poland in 2024\n\nOccasion Date 1 New Year’s Day January 1 2 Epiphany January 6 3 Easter Sunday March 31 4 Easter Monday April 1 5 Labour Day May 1 6 Constitution Day May 3 7 Whit Sunday (Pentecost) May 19 8 Corpus Christi May 30 9 Assumption Day and Polish Armed Forces Day August 15 10 All Saints’ Day November 1 11 Independence Day November 11 12 Christmas Day December 25 13 Second Day of Christmas December 26\n\nThe content provided in this publication is for general information purposes only and should not be considered legal advice.
