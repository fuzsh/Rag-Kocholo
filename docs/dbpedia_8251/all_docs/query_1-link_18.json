        "text": "Basics[]\n\nPoland have 4 GSM-based network providers:\n\nPlay (by P4, part of Iliad group)\n\nOrange (formerly IDEA)\n\nPlus (by Polkomtel, merged with Aero2)\n\nT-Mobile (formerly ERA)\n\nMore and more MVNOs and subsidiaries of the operators are arriving on the scene competing with four major operators and reselling their networks. The first 4 operators have pretty similar market shares around 25%. Their price battles have led to some of the lowest rates for mobile data in the world for the consumer, but also to congestion and slow speeds at peak times too.\n\nCoverage and network quality[]\n\nFrequencies in Poland Network Orange T-Mobile Play Plus (merged with Aero2) 2G 900 MHz 3G 900 MHz1 n/a 900 MHz 900 MHz, 2100 MHz 4G/LTE B20: 800 MHz (10 MHz)B8: 900 MHz (5 MHz)1\n\nB3: 1800 MHz (10 MHz)\n\nB1: 2100 MHz (15 MHz)\n\nB7: 2600 MHz (15 MHz)\n\nB20: 800 MHz (10 MHz)B8: 900 MHz (5 MHz)\n\nB3: 1800 MHz (10 MHz)\n\nB1: 2100 MHz (15 MHz)\n\nB7: 2600 MHz (15 MHz)\n\nB20: 800 MHz (5 MHz)\n\nB3: 1800 MHz (15 MHz)\n\nB1: 2100 MHz (15 MHz)\n\nB7: 2600 MHz (15 MHz)\n\nB8: 900 MHz (5 MHz)B3: 1800 MHz (20 MHz)\n\nB1: 2100 MHz (10 MHz)\n\nB7: 2600 MHz (20 MHz)\n\n5G n1: 2100 MHz (15 MHz)2n78: 3600 MHz (100 MHz) n1: 2100 MHz (15 MHz)2n78: 3700 MHz (100 MHz) n1: 2100 MHz (15 MHz)2n78: 3500 MHz (100 MHz) n1: 2100 MHz (10 MHz)2n38/n41: 2600 MHz (40 MHz)\n\nn78: 3400 MHz (100 MHz)3\n\nCoverage map Orange T-Mobile Play Plus Sub brand nju, Orange Flex heyah, tuBiedronka Virgin Mobile, Fakt Mobile Plush\n\nPrimary bands for networks are bolded.\n\n1 3G coverage on Orange is currently in the process of a phased shutdown and switching to LTE and should be completed across the Poland by the end of 2025.\n\n2 Dynamic Spectrum Sharing (DSS) in use to share capacity between 4G & 5G networks.\n\n3 Not yet started\n\nWhen coverage is concerned T-Mobile and Orange are best sharing 12,000 transmitters in the country, followed by Play with 11,500 in 2024 and Plus on 4th position with only 8,500 antennas. Play also has roaming agreement with Orange, that are only available on some tariffs.\n\nOperators slowly opens 5G for prepaid with special, more expensive packages, and not all sub-brands and MVNOs have access to 5G (with exception of Plus, which opened up 5G for all own customers and most MVNOs). After much delay, the Polish telecommunications regulator UKE has completed the 3.5GHz spectrum auction, issuing licenses to Orange, Play, T-Mobile, and Plus. The first base stations to use this new spectrum are already live, translating into significant improvements in data transmission speeds and network availability.\n\nFollowing a public consultation, UKE determined that there is no immediate demand for the 26GHz (24.25-27.5GHz) spectrum for 5G services. Major operators, including T-Mobile, Play, and Orange, have suggested that this spectrum should be allocated no earlier than 2027-2028 due to insufficient equipment to support commercial services at this frequency.\n\nT-Mobile continues to show the best overall network quality in Poland, followed by Orange and Play, with Plus still trailing.\n\nAvailability[]\n\nSIM cards can be bought at many places: shops, kiosks, newsagents, petrol stations, post offices, vending machines (online registration only), tobacconists or the stores of the network operators. A SIM card with preloaded credit is called a starter. Żabka stores and Ruch kiosks carry starters of all four networks while Biedronka supermarkets carry T-Mobile, Heyah and tuBiedronka starters.\n\nManaging your account online by web browser may require some Polish language skills. The sites of all operators (except Lycamobile, which has its website fully in English) are mostly in Polish with no direct translation except for the \"Offer for foreigners\" tab, but the apps are usually translated to English and Ukrainian.\n\nSIM cards are sold in all sizes. Prepaid still has about 50% share of the total market in Poland and is called Na kartę. Tethering and VoIP are available without any additional cost on all operators.\n\neSIM[]\n\neSIM is supported by all main operators. For now, when you want to activate eSIM, first, you need to buy classic starter pack, register it and generate eSIM profile on operator website or in app. For now only Orange (Flex) supports additional eSIM card to be used on smartwatch. Lyca Mobile as the first MVNO offers eSIM for prepaid customers.\n\nMost MVNOs support eSIM, but some do not. tuBiedronka (on the T-Mobile network) doesn't support eSIM at all and njumobile (on the Orange network) only supports it in subscriptions, not prepaid.\n\nTop-ups[]\n\nPolish operators may decline foreign credit or debit cards for top-ups on their website. It is worth to try in the operator app or website, it however may be a hit or miss whether your debit card will be accepted. In Poland you should go to shops and kiosks instead that sell recharges (called doładowanie) all over starting at 5 zł. Credit validity varies between providers and tarrifs and often depends on the top-up amount.\n\nYou can top-up in operator apps by using Google Pay or Apple Pay, which is the most convenient way in which also you'll get extra bonusses, but not all operators support it (e.g. Plus). Two local Polish top-up sites have proven to accept foreign credit cards without surcharges:\n\non the website http://doladowania.payu.pl/ payed by credit or debit card\n\non the app or website: http://www.doladowania.pl/ by credit/debit card through MasterPass\n\nSo there should be no need to go to 3rd party sites paying high premiums.\n\nSIM card validity and inactivity fees[]\n\nThe four major network operators (Play, Orange, Plus and T-Mobile), most of their subbrand and MVNOs diversify the validity of the SIM card from the amount of the last top-up (the higher top-up amount, the longer period of active mode). When active mode period is ended, your SIM will enter in passive mode in which you'll be able only to receive calls and SMS - data transmission will be blocked. The period of passive mode depends on operator:\n\nPlus has an expiry policy of 2 years (or 730 days) since the last top-up\n\nOrange has an expiry policy of 1 year (or 365 days) since the last top-up\n\nT-Mobile has an expiry policy of 31 days since active mode expiration\n\nPlay: it depends on tarriff line - mostly is 60 days since active mode expiration\n\nLegally, topped up credit must not be lost and the provider is obliged to give it back to you after having disconnected the SIM, but this procedure requires Polish a bank account (to which your unused credit will be transferred) and attracts a 20 zł fee which makes it pointless to apply for a small amount.\n\nOperators offer paid options to extend your SIM card validity (up to 1 year) or will automatically extend the validity if you have any credit on your balance (e.g. T-Mobile and its subbrands), but it doesn't prevent inactivity fees which most operators have. Now operators requires from users to do any activity or spend more than 5 zł per month to prevent from being charged. Sometimes even top-ups are not counted as paid activity. This fees makes very hard to keep a SIM card alive from out of the country. So it's recommended to run down your balance to avoid any unexpected charges.\n\nDifferent situation is in subscription offers - when you terminate your current plan, your SIM card will be blocked (you can't even receive calls & SMSes!), but your number will be preserved (for max. 6 months).\n\nMandatory SIM card registration []\n\nSince July 2016 you are required to register your SIM card in order to use it. For registration you will need, an ID card (Polish, EU/EEA citizens only), passport or residence permit. In Poland they will rarely, but usually never accept a driving licence as proof of ID. The minimum age for registration is 13 years of age.\n\nIt's still possible to buy a prepaid starter set without showing your ID, however your SIM card won't be activated unless registered. Places where cards can be registered differ depending on the operator. Often some small kiosks sell SIM cards, but are unable to register them. That's why it's recommended to go directly to an operator's store instead, which are located in towns and shopping centres.\n\nWhen you have already registered (and active) SIM card and when you buy another SIM card from the same provider, you can easily register it by assigning your data from them. This can be done online or by sending SMS from your active/registered SIM card. More details are provided on operators websites (only in Polish language): Orange, Play, Plus, T-Mobile.\n\nOperators also provides fully online registeration, but is only available for people with polish bank accounts (which supports mojeID), hence not available for short-term visitors.\n\nFurthermore, electronic markets, convenience stores of the Żabka chain (locator), kiosks of the Ruch chain (locator) and many post offices sell and register SIM cards of all 4 providers and most MVNOs. For all operators maps of registration points are linked. More than 50 million prepaid SIMs in Poland have been registered in Poland in 2016/7 and all unregistered SIM cards have been shut off.\n\nIt is worth noting however, that it is possible and perfectly legal to use a SIM card registered to another person. The only law regulating prepaid SIM registration is Article 60b of The Telecommunication Act (Journal of Laws of 2004, No. 171, item 1800, as amended), which only enforces providers to collect personal information from entities who are a party to the Service Contract, that is who bought the prepaid SIM from the provider. Although such pre-activated cards can be found online on polish marketplace sites like Lento, as reselling of those has not been prohibited by law, please be aware that the service could be suspended or terminated without any notice if the registree has too many active SIMs assigned to them[1]. Moreover, you do not have any control over the balance withdrawals or any other aspect of the account, so do not use any 2FA on the given phone number. Using data only along with VoIP, topping up just the exact cost of the packet and blocking all inbound calls and text messages (*35*0000# to activate, #35*0000# to deactivate, *#35# to check) is advisable in this case.\n\n3G shutdown & VoLTE/VoWiFi[]\n\nAll operators (except Plus) have already shut down 3G on 2100 MHz. 3G is now used only at 900 MHz for additional coverage (except T-Mobile, which has no 3G coverage at all), but will most likely be phased out soon.\n\nT-Mobile Poland has already shut down their 3G network in April 2023.\n\nOrange is already shutting down their 3G network from September 2023 and will be done by end-2025 with launching LTE 900 MHz.\n\nPlay has also confirmed, that they will completely shut off 2G and 3G by 2027, but now 2G/3G in some places are not accessible anymore.\n\nPlus will also shut down its 3G network, but there is no further information about time of disabling.\n\nSo be sure to bring compatible 4G/LTE device and consider using IMS services, such as VoLTE and VoWiFi, which are available for customers of these four operators (including sub-brands), but not for all MVNOs. You need to have compatible device (not always, depending on device firmware) and sometimes you'll need to activate it.\n\nData rollover[]\n\nDue to fact, that most offers with data packages consists of two parts (bonus for top-up and data with no-limit package) it is possible to rollover your data. But take care that mostly only free bonus for top-up and some once-off packages (when you buy another before the previous one expires) can rollover and free top-up bonus is used first.\n\nPrice comparison with the rest of the world[]\n\nUK internet comparison site cable.co.uk has ranked Poland as 27th out of 237 countries/territories and 4th in the OECD (36 countries) in terms of mobile data affordability with data costing on average PLN 1.58 (approximately US$0.37) per GB (August 2023). This means Poland's prices are approximately US$2.24 per GB cheaper than the global average. Data in Poland is thus cheaper than Germany, Spain, Portugal, Australia, Canada, Brunei, Singapore, the UK, New Zealand, the US, and Switzerland; relatively on par with Montenegro, China, Martinique and Samoa; but more expensive than in France, Italy, Ukraine, San Marino, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Haiti, India, Indonesia, Israel, Malaysia, Fiji and Kyrgyzstan. (source)\n\nEU roaming[]\n\nAfter Brexit, surcharge-free roaming on most Polish providers in the United Kingdom and Gibraltar has now ended. Most major operators have removed UK and Gibraltar out of their EU/EEA zone, but launched temporary promotional price floors for mobile data roaming in the UK above EU regulated rates. All main operators, their sub-brands and most MVNOs using either aforementioned network now charge separate price floors for data in UK/Gibraltar. Lyca Mobile PL, as the only MVNO, continue to apply RLAH rules to the UK and Gibraltar for an indefinite period (but with smaller caps).\n\nAlso, be aware that Poland shares three borders with Belarus, Ukraine and Kaliningrad Oblast (Obwód królewiecki) of Russia, which are located outside the EU. If your device accidentially picks up a Belarusian, Russian or Ukrainian network, you will be charged a much higher rate. You can prevent this by manually selecting a Polish network if you're travelling to any of the aforementioned border areas or, if you have Polish SIM, you can temporarily disable roaming.\n\nPlay[]\n\nPlay (owned by P4, now part of Xavier Niel's Iliad group), was historically the smallest of the 4 network operators in Poland. But with their aggressive marketing, Play finally moved to the 1st position in 2017/8 as far as number of subscribers is concerned.\n\nBy mid-2020, it had covered 98.7% of the population with 3G/UMTS, which is called 4G. Real 4G/LTE covers 99% of population. 4G LTE Ultra and 5G READY is an area where LTE-Advanced is available (maximum speed: 262 Mbit/s or 600 Mbit/s) covering 91%. 5G is mostly available on 2100 MHz (n1) frequency, but is now also available on 3500 MHz (n78) frequency offering speed up to 1048 Mbit/s. 5G is available for prepaid users, but only with selected, most expensive packages.\n\nPlay customers using most tariffs are allowed to roam for free on Orange 4G/LTE network in places without Play's own coverage. Roaming speed is no longer limited like before. Be aware that the budget Internet na Kartę 2.0 tariff is excluded from domestic roaming and stays on Play's own network only. National data roaming on Orange will end in 2025.\n\nPlay has one of the most confusing SIM card portfolios in Europe. They have different tariff lines with default rates. Their website contains a description of prepaid plans as well as instructions for choosing a plan, but lacks some packages offer or how to terminate a package.\n\nAvailability[]\n\nTheir SIM card can be bought at kiosks, petrol stations and other points of sale: Play Store Locator. If you want to be sure, that your SIM is registered at the point of sale, go to a branded Play store and show your ID. Registration takes place at all Play stores, Ruch kiosks and postal offices (see map).\n\nRecharge vouchers are available at service stations, supermarkets, and many other places starting 5 zł up to 150 zł. To check balance, type *101#. To check internet allowance, type *108#. You can also top-up by Google Pay or Apple Pay in Play24 app.\n\nYou can download the Play24 app for iOS and Android to manage your account and check balances. App is available in English and Ukrainian language.\n\nPlay[]\n\nTarriff lines[]\n\nPlay na kartę\n\nPlay na Kartę is their standard prepaid product line sold for 5 zł in a starter pack (with 6 GB preloaded for 10 days). You can change from any tariff to this one by typing *163*6#. Card is valid for 10 days. Default data rate is high 1.20 zł/MB.\n\nTop-ups are from 5 zł valid for 50 days to 100 zł valid for 150 days. They don't include bonus data. You need to add a data package (see below).\n\nFORMUŁA Play na Kartę\n\nThis tariff can be activated/changed by *163*10# or with starter pack (contains 6 GB for 10 days) . Default data rate is 0.20 zł/MB up to 5 zł (max. 25 MB), after speed throttled to 8 kbps. Top-ups are from 5 zł valid for 5 days to 100 zł valid for 150 days. They don't include bonus data.

On the majority of 4G base stations LTE Advanced is available to compatible devices at no extra cost. LTE-A in T-Mobile can offer up to 650 Mbit/s of download speed. T-Mobile also offers widely available 5G network on 2100 MHz (n1) frequency, but real 5G on 3700 MHz (branded as 5G Bardziej) is now available in most big cities and some tourists spots with speeds up to 1100 Mbit/s. 5G is available for all own and Heyah prepaid customers up to 30/SEP/2024.\n\nBefore 2011 it used to be the second-largest operator in Poland, but after rebranding to \"T-Mobile.pl\" (from \"Era\") and during period with disappointing offers compared to other operators, it started losing customers. Currently it has least market share.\n\nT-Mobile has a union with Orange Polska to improve infrastructure called NetWorks - T-Mobile and Orange are building cellular network together, but don't share frequencies. It means that subscribers can use both networks' base stations (that is not equal to domestic roaming, but basically T-Mobile and Orange subscribers are using the same antennas).\n\nT-Mobile has already shut down its 3G network, so be sure to bring compatible 4G/LTE device for data.\n\nT-Mobile na kartę[]\n\nAvailability []\n\nThey sell four prepaid starter packs for 5 zł in their stores (locator)\n\nfor 5 zł valid for 14 days preloaded\n\nfor 10 zł valid for 60 days (without start credit) with GO!
