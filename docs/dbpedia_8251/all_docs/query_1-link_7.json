        "text": "What types of companies exist in Poland?\n\nThere are several types of companies in Poland, each with its own particularities, requirements for founders, authorised capital, taxation and management. Here is an overview of the main forms of entrepreneurship available in Poland:\n\nIndividual entrepreneur (Jednoosobowa działalność gospodarcza)\n\nThis is the easiest and most common way to run a business designed for a single owner. It requires no initial capital. Individual entrepreneurs operate in their own name and are fully financially responsible with all their property.\n\nCivil law partnership (Spółka cywilna)\n\nA simple form of co-operation between two or more entrepreneurs that does not require registration with the National Court Register (KRS). It is based on a contract and is mainly used for small businesses. The participants are jointly liable for the obligations.\n\nLimited Liability Company (Spółka z ograniczoną odpowiedzialnością, sp. z o.o.)\n\nThe most popular form of legal entity for small and medium-sized businesses. It requires a minimum authorised capital of PLN 5,000. The founders are liable only to the extent of the contributed capital. Ideal for entrepreneurs who wish to limit their personal financial liability.\n\nJoint Stock Company (Spółka akcyjna, S.A.)\n\nDesigned for large businesses with a minimum authorised capital of PLN 100,000. Allows to attract investments through the sale of shares. Shareholders are liable only to the extent of their shares.\n\nSpółka komandytowa (Spółka komandytowa, sp.k.)\n\nCombines elements of a legal entity and a partnership. Has at least one seconder (investor) whose liability is limited to the invested capital and one complementer (manager) who has unlimited liability.\n\nProfessional partnership (Spółka partnerska)\n\nDesigned for members of the free professions (doctors, lawyers, architects), it allows them to join forces without the need to set up a limited liability company or joint stock company.\n\nSpółka komandytowo-akcyjna (Spółka komandytowo-akcyjna, S.K.A.)\n\nCombines the elements of a commandite company and a joint-stock company. It has shareholders instead of teamsters, but retains the role of a complementary company.\n\nEach of these forms has advantages and disadvantages that should be taken into account when choosing the most suitable structure for doing business in Poland. The decision should be based on the size of the company, future plans, willingness to be financially responsible and other key factors.\n\nTable with current tax rates for companies registered in Poland in 2024. This data will help to get an idea of the tax burden on business in Poland.\n\nName of tax Tax rate Corporate Income Tax (Corporate Income Tax) Standard rate – 19%, Reduced rate for small enterprises and start-ups – 9% for revenues up to 2 million EUR Value Added Tax (VAT) Standard rate – 23%, Reduced rates – 8%, 5%, some goods and services – 0% Personal Income Tax (Personal Income Tax) Two rates, 17% and 32%, depending on income level Social Security Contributions (Social Security Tax) Different rates, depending on employment status and type of insurance, the total burden can be around 35% of payroll Dividend Tax (Dividend Tax) 19% Average salary 2023 Depending on the source, the average salary in Poland may vary. For an accurate figure, it is recommended to refer to the current statistics at the time of enquiry.\n\nThis table reflects the main tax rates for companies in Poland, but it is important to remember that tax legislation is subject to change. There are also various reliefs and exemptions that may apply depending on the specific nature of the company’s business, its size and other factors. It is always advisable to contact a qualified tax advisor or accountant from Regulated United Europe for detailed information and advice.\n\nWhat is the amount of the authorised capital of a company in Poland?\n\nIn Poland, the amount of the authorised capital of a company depends on the chosen form of legal entity. Authorised capital is the amount contributed by the founders when registering a company and is intended to ensure its financial stability and cover its start-up costs. Let us consider the requirements for the authorised capital for the most common types of companies in Poland:\n\nLimited Liability Company (Spółka z ograniczoną odpowiedzialnością, sp. z o.o.)\n\nThe establishment of a limited liability company requires a minimum authorised capital of PLN 5,000. This makes sp. z o.o. an affordable option for small and medium-sized businesses wishing to limit the personal liability of the founders. The capital can be contributed in the form of cash or property, the value of which must be confirmed by an appraisal.\n\nJoint Stock Company (Spółka akcyjna, S.A.)\n\nA joint-stock company is intended for large businesses and provides for a minimum authorised capital of PLN 100,000. This form of company allows raising additional funds through the sale of shares, which makes it attractive for larger projects and investments.\n\nSpółka komandytowa (Spółka komandytowa, sp.k.)\n\nThere is no strictly defined minimum amount of authorised capital in a commandite company. However, the company formation agreement must contain information on the contributions of each of the participants, which may be either monetary or non-monetary (e.g. property, knowledge or skills).\n\nSpółka komandytowo-akcyjna (Spółka komandytowo-akcyjna, S.K.A.)\n\nA limited liability company requires authorised capital similar to a joint stock company – a minimum of PLN 100,000. This form combines elements of a joint-stock company and a limited company, providing flexibility in attracting investments and managing the company.\n\nProfessional partnership (Spółka partnerska)\n\nFor a professional partnership, legislation does not set a minimum amount of authorised capital. The focus is on the professional qualifications of the founders rather than the amount of funds contributed.\n\nConclusion\n\nChoosing the form of legal entity and the appropriate amount of authorised capital is an important stage of business planning in Poland. Smaller authorised capital may attract start-ups and small businesses, while large companies and projects that need significant investments and have a higher financial risk may choose forms with higher capital requirements. In any case, the choice should be in line with the strategic goals of the business, its scale and the specifics of its activities.\n\nDoes a company in Poland have to have a local director?\n\nPolish law does not require the mandatory presence of a local director to manage a company. In none of the forms of legal entities, be it a limited liability company (sp. z o.o.) or a joint stock company (S.A.), the law does not explicitly state the need for one of the directors or members of the management board to be a Polish citizen or have a place of residence in the country.\n\nLimited Liability Company (sp. z o.o.)\n\nFor sp. z o.o., the most popular form of business among SMEs, the legislation allows the appointment of non-Polish residents as directors (board members). It is important that directors meet the general requirements for the position, including the absence of a criminal record for economic offences.\n\nJoint Stock Company (S.A.)\n\nIn joint-stock companies there are also no requirements for the nationality or place of residence of the members of the management board. However, an important aspect is the presence of the company’s registered address in Poland and the possibility to carry out management activities in the interests of the company within the country.\n\nAdvantages of having a local director\n\nWhile it is not mandatory to have a local director, having one can be helpful for several reasons:\n\nImproved communication with local authorities and banking institutions.\n\nBetter understanding of the local market and legislation.\n\nSimplification of the process of company registration and subsequent conduct of business.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn general, doing business in Poland does not require the appointment of a local director, which makes the country attractive to foreign investors. However, having someone on the team who is familiar with the local market and legal context can be a significant advantage for effective management and business development.\n\nWhat are the state fees for establishing a company in Poland?\n\nWhen setting up a company in Poland, entrepreneurs are faced with the need to pay various state fees and charges, which may vary depending on the form of the company’s legal entity and the method of registration. These fees are mandatory and are intended to cover the costs of the state authorities for processing documents and entering information into the relevant registers. Let’s take a closer look at the fees for establishing the most popular types of companies in Poland.\n\nLimited Liability Company (Spółka z ograniczoną odpowiedzialnością, sp. z o.o.)\n\nRegistration fee: To register a limited liability company in the National Court Register (Krajowy Rejestr Sądowy, KRS), a registration fee is required. As of the latest period of my knowledge, it amounts to PLN 500.\n\nAnnouncement fee: In addition, a fee of PLN 100 is charged for publishing information about the company in the Official Court Gazette (Monitor Sądowy i Gospodarczy).\n\nJoint Stock Company (Spółka akcyjna, S.A.)\n\nRegistration fee: For joint stock companies, the registration fee in KRS is also 500 PLN.\n\nFee for the announcement: The cost of publication in the Official Judicial Gazette remains the same and is PLN 100.\n\nSpółka komandytowa (Spółka komandytowa, sp.k.)\n\nRegistration fee: The registration fee in KRS is 600 PLN for business travellers.\n\nAnnouncement fee: The cost of publication in the Official Gazette is PLN 100.\n\nProfessional partnership (Spółka partnerska)\n\nRegistration fee: The registration fee for professional partnerships in the KRS is similar and amounts to PLN 600.\n\nAnnouncement fee: A fee of PLN 100 is also required for publishing information in the Official Gazette.\n\nElectronic registration\n\nIt is worth noting that by using the system of electronic registration via the Internet (S24), which is designed to simplify the process of establishing companies, the amount of state fees can be reduced. For example, for a sp. z o.o., electronic registration reduces the fee for making an entry in the KRS to PLN 250.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe amount of state fees in Poland is an important part of financial planning when setting up a company. Although the figures shown here are current at the time of my last update, it is advisable to check the current information immediately before incorporation, as the rates may be subject to change. In addition to state fees, you should also take into account possible legal and consulting costs as well as the need to deposit the authorised capital.\n\nWhat is the annual cost of maintaining a company in Poland?\n\nThe annual cost of maintaining a company in Poland depends on many factors including the type of company, size of business, turnover, number of employees, and the industry in which the company operates. In this article we will try to cover the main aspects and costs encountered when doing business in Poland to provide an insight into the annual cost of maintaining a company.\n\nAuthorised capital\n\nAuthorised capital is not a recurring annual cost, but it is important to consider it when establishing a company. Depending on the type of legal entity, the minimum requirements for authorised capital may vary, e.g. for Spółka z ograniczoną odpowiedzialnością (sp. z o.o.) it is 5,000 PLN and for Spółka Akcyjna (S.A.) it is 100,000 PLN.\n\nRegistration fees and state charges\n\nThese are one-off fees charged at the time of incorporation. However, companies may also be required to pay certain fees for amendments to the registration data or for obtaining specific licences and permits depending on the field of activity.\n\nTaxation\n\nCorporate Income Tax (CIT): The standard rate is 19%, but there is a reduced rate of 9% for small businesses for the first few years of operation.\n\nValue Added Tax (VAT): The standard VAT rate in Poland is 23%, there are also reduced rates for certain goods and services.\n\nLocal taxes and fees: Includes property tax, vehicle tax and others.\n\nAccounting and auditing\n\nThe cost of accounting services can vary greatly depending on the size and complexity of a company’s operations. Small businesses can expect to spend between 500 and 2,000 PLN per month, while large companies with high transaction volumes and international operations may pay significantly more.\n\nLegal services\n\nThe annual cost of legal services strongly depends on the specifics of the business and the need for specialised advice. Regular legal support can cost from several thousand to tens of thousands of PLN per year.\n\nOffice expenses\n\nOffice rent, utilities, internet and telephony also affect annual costs. Rental costs can fluctuate depending on the location, quality and size of the office space.\n\nSalaries and social contributions\n\nEmployee salaries and mandatory social contributions constitute a significant part of a company’s costs. In Poland, employers are obliged to pay social contributions on behalf of their employees, which increases the total cost of labour by about 20-30%.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe annual cost of maintaining a company in Poland depends on many variables and can vary considerably. It is important to plan carefully for all upcoming expenses and to consider both fixed and variable costs in the course of doing business. Industry specifics, the size of the company and the scale of its operations play a key role in shaping the overall cost picture.\n\nWhat are the main advantages of setting up a company in Poland?\n\nEstablishing a company in Poland offers many advantages for entrepreneurs and foreign investors, making this country an attractive place to do business. Let’s take a look at the main advantages that may encourage you to choose Poland as a place to develop your company.\n\nStrategic location\n\nPoland occupies a strategic position in the centre of Europe, serving as a bridge between the eastern and western parts of the continent. This provides convenient access to European markets, including those of the European Union, as well as those of Eastern Europe and Asia. This position is ideal for companies looking to expand their presence and manage their logistics efficiently.\n\nAttractive investment and tax policies\n\nPoland offers a competitive tax system with reduced corporate income tax rates for small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as numerous tax exemptions and incentives for investors in certain sectors and economic zones. In addition, there are various grants and support programmes from the European Union to stimulate innovation, infrastructure development and job creation.\n\nDeveloped infrastructure\n\nPoland has a well-developed transport, digital and social infrastructure, which creates favourable conditions for doing business. The country continues to invest in the modernisation of roads, railways, airports and ports, as well as in the development of the digital economy, which facilitates access to local and international markets.\n\nSkilled labour resource\n\nPoland offers access to a large pool of qualified and highly educated professionals in various sectors. The level of education in Poland is high, while salary expectations in the country remain relatively low compared to Western Europe, making the Polish labour market attractive to employers.\n\nA dynamically developing market\n\nPoland’s economy is characterised by stable growth, supported by domestic consumption and investment. The country’s market has more than 38 million consumers, offering a wide range of business opportunities in a variety of sectors, from manufacturing to IT and services.\n\nEase of doing business\n\nPoland is making significant efforts to simplify bureaucratic procedures and improve the business environment. In recent years, the country has significantly moved up in the ease of doing business rankings thanks to simplified company registration, taxation and authorisation processes.\n\nConclusion\n\nEstablishing a company in Poland offers entrepreneurs a number of important advantages, including a strategic geographical location, attractive tax policy, developed infrastructure, access to skilled labour, a dynamically developing market and an improved business environment. These factors make Poland one of the most attractive investment and business development destinations in Central and Eastern Europe.\n\nWhat are the ways to set up a company in Poland?\n\nEstablishing a company in Poland can be done in several ways, each of which has its own features, advantages and is suitable for different business purposes. The choice of the optimal method depends on many factors, including the size and type of the proposed business, the number of founders, the required authorised capital and other key aspects. Let’s take a look at the main ways to set up a company in Poland.\n\nRegistration of an individual entrepreneur (Jednoosobowa działalność gospodarcza)\n\nThis is the easiest and fastest way to start a business in Poland, ideal for single entrepreneurs. To register, you need to apply to the Central Register and Information on Enterprises (CEIDG), which can be done online. Individual entrepreneurs pay taxes on their personal income and have the right to choose the most favourable tax system.\n\nEstablishment of a limited liability company (Spółka z ograniczoną odpowiedzialnością, sp. z o.o.)\n\nSp. z o.o. is one of the most popular forms among small and medium-sized businesses due to the limited liability of the founders. Registration takes place through the National Court Register (KRS) and requires a minimum authorised capital of PLN 5,000. The process can be done online through the S24 system, which speeds up and simplifies registration.\n\nFormalisation of a joint stock company (Spółka Akcyjna, S.A.)\n\nA joint-stock company may be suitable for large businesses or for attracting investments through a public offering. The authorised capital must be at least PLN 100,000. S.A. registration also takes place through the KRS and requires a more complex procedure, including the drafting of articles of association and the formation of a founding committee.\n\nEstablishment of the Spółka Komandytowa (Spółka Komandytowa, sp.k.)\n\nA teaming society is suitable for partners who wish to share responsibility and contribution to the business. One or more teamsters have limited responsibility, while one or more complementarians have full responsibility. This format is suitable for business projects with a division of roles and responsibilities between partners.\n\nNotarisation of documents\n\nFor some forms of companies, including sp. z o.o. and S.A., the statutory documents must be notarised. This step requires the personal presence of the founders or their official representatives and incurs additional costs.\n\nRegistration with the relevant state authorities\n\nAfter all the necessary documents have been prepared and certified, the company must be registered with the KRS. It is also necessary to ensure registration with the tax office, the Social Insurance Fund (ZUS) and the statistical office in order to obtain the relevant identification numbers.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe choice of how to set up a company in Poland depends on many factors, including the size of the company, the number of founders, the intended field of activity and financial possibilities. Each of the listed methods has its own peculiarities, documentation requirements and deadlines. It is important to thoroughly research all available options and, if necessary, consult with legal and financial experts to choose the best way for your business.\n\nIs it necessary to have a registered office in Poland?\n\nThe issue of having a legal address for companies in Poland plays a key role in the process of registration and further operation of the company. A legal address not only fulfils the legal requirements, but also serves as an important element for interaction with state authorities, clients and partners. Let’s take a closer look at why having a legal address in Poland is mandatory and what functions it fulfils.\n\nLegal requirements\n\nAccording to Polish law, every company registered in Poland is obliged to have a legal address in Poland. This address is entered in the National Court Register (Krajowy Rejestr Sądowy, KRS) and is used as the official address of the company for legal, tax and correspondence purposes.\n\nFunctions of a legal address\n\nRegistration and legal processes: The registered office is used when registering a company and in all legal documents, contracts and licences.\n\nTax liabilities: A registered office is required to determine the tax jurisdiction of the company and to manage its tax affairs. It determines in which tax office the company will be accounted for and pay taxes.\n\nCorporate correspondence: The legal address is used to receive official correspondence from government agencies, banking and financial institutions, as well as from partners and customers.\n\nHow to ensure that you have a legal address\n\nRenting an office space: Companies can rent an office space to be used as their registered office. This is the most traditional method, but it can be expensive, especially for start-ups or small businesses.\n\nVirtual office: As a more cost-effective option, companies can utilise the services of a virtual office, which provides a registered office address as well as additional services such as mail acceptance and telephone service.\n\nUsing the address of the founder or director: In some cases, companies may use the home address of the founder or director as the registered office, provided that all requirements and authorisations are met.\n\nConclusion\n\nHaving a registered office in Poland is an integral part of establishing and doing business in the country. It not only complies with legal requirements, but also plays an important role in tax planning, legal defence and corporate image of the company. The choice of the best option for securing a legal address should take into account both the financial capabilities of the company and the strategic goals of the business.\n\nIs it possible to open a branch office of a foreign company in Poland?\n\nOpening a branch office of a foreign company in Poland is a feasible and often profitable step to expand business into the Polish market and further expansion into Central and Eastern Europe. Poland attracts foreign companies with its strategic location, developed infrastructure and skilled labour force. In this article we will look at the key aspects related to opening a branch office of a foreign company in Poland.\n\nLegal aspects\n\nA branch of a foreign company in Poland is considered as its branch without legal personality.

In this article, we will look at the steps involved in the company formation process and how long each step may take.\n\nChoice of legal entity form\n\nThe first step is to choose a suitable form of legal entity. The most common forms of companies in Poland are: sole proprietorship (jednoosobowa działalność gospodarcza), limited liability company (spółka z ograniczoną odpowiedzialnością, sp. z o.o.) and joint stock company (spółka akcyjna, S.A.).

Although the process may seem lengthy, it is an important step on the way to successfully doing business in Poland. Proper planning and consultation with legal and accounting professionals can help speed up the process and avoid potential complications.\n\nWhat kind of activities can a company engage in in Poland?\n\nIn Poland, companies can engage in a wide range of activities covering almost all aspects of the economy and business. Polish law provides equal opportunities for foreign and local investors to engage in a wide range of activities, from manufacturing to high-tech services. In this article we will look at the key sectors and activities that companies can engage in in Poland, based on current economic trends and the legal framework.\n\nProduction activities\n\nPoland has traditionally been strong in the manufacturing sector, including mechanical engineering, automotive, consumer electronics and electrical engineering, and chemicals. Foreign companies can set up manufacturing plants, taking advantage of skilled labour and relatively low production costs compared to other European Union countries.\n\nTrade\n\nTrade is one of the most accessible and widespread activities, including both retail and wholesale trade. Many foreign companies operate successfully in the retail sector, opening chains of shops, supermarkets or specialised outlets. Wholesale trade also presents significant business opportunities, including export and import operations.\n\nServices\n\nThe service sector in Poland is broad and diverse. It includes financial and insurance services, real estate, tourism, education, medical services, IT and telecommunications, as well as professional, scientific and technical services. The IT sector is developing particularly fast, where Poland aims to become one of the leading centres for software development and digital technologies in Europe.\n\nConstruction\n\nThe construction sector in Poland offers a wide range of opportunities for foreign investors, including residential and commercial construction, infrastructure projects and specialised construction works. Poland is actively developing its infrastructure, which creates additional demand for construction and engineering services.\n\nEnergy and renewable energy sources\n\nPoland is interested in developing the energy sector, including traditional energy sources and renewable sources such as wind and solar energy. Foreign companies can contribute to the modernisation of the energy sector and the development of new renewable energy technologies.\n\nResearch and development\n\nThe R&D sector in Poland provides opportunities for innovative companies engaged in research in biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, new materials, digital technologies and other promising areas.

Flexible legislation, economic stability and access to the European market make Poland an attractive place to do business. However, it is important to take into account industry specifics, local regulations and licensing requirements for certain activities.\n\nDoes a company in Poland have to have employees?\n\nThe question of whether it is necessary for a company registered in Poland to employ workers depends on a number of factors, including the company’s form of legal personality, its size, area of activity and specific legal requirements. In this article we will look at various aspects related to the employment of workers by companies in Poland to provide an insight into the obligations and opportunities for businesses in this context.\n\nMandatory availability of employees\n\nLegal requirements: Polish law does not impose mandatory requirements for companies in general to have employees. Most forms of companies, including sole proprietorship (jednoosobowa działalność gospodarcza), limited liability company (sp. z o.o.) and joint stock company (S.A.), can operate without hiring employees if their activities do not require additional staff.\n\nForms of legal entity and personnel requirements: Some specific forms of legal entities, e.g. professional partnerships (spółka partnerska), presuppose the existence of several founders with certain qualifications, but this does not amount to an obligation to have employees.\n\nReasons for hiring workers\n\nBusiness expansion: Business growth and development often requires hiring additional staff to perform various tasks and functions within the company.\n\nSpecialised expertise: Having qualified specialists on staff can be critical for companies operating in high-tech industries or providing specialised services.\n\nLegislative and tax incentives: The Polish government offers a number of tax exemptions and incentives for companies creating jobs, especially in certain economic zones or industries.\n\nRequirements for employers\n\nCompanies employing workers in Poland are obliged to comply with Polish labour law, including drawing up employment contracts, paying at least the minimum wage, ensuring working conditions in accordance with health and safety standards, and paying social contributions and taxes.\n\nAlternatives to hiring workers\n\noutsourcing and freelancing: Companies can use the services of third-party organisations or self-employed individuals to perform certain tasks, thus avoiding the direct employment of workers.\n\nUse of temporary labour: Through employment agencies, companies can hire temporary workers for projects with a limited time frame.\n\nConclusion\n\nAlthough Polish law does not oblige companies to have employees, the hiring of staff may be driven by business needs and development strategy. It is important to consider all labour law and social security requirements when deciding whether to expand the workforce. Companies seeking to remain flexible may consider alternative ways of carrying out work through outsourcing or hiring freelancers.\n\nHow to choose a name for a company in Poland?\n\nChoosing a name for a company in Poland is an important step when establishing it, as it not only forms the first impression, but also plays a key role in branding and marketing strategies. When choosing a name, it is important to consider both marketing aspects and legal requirements. This article provides basic guidelines for choosing a name for a company in Poland, which will help to make it recognisable and compliant with the law.\n\nUniqueness and distinction\n\nThe name must be unique and different from the already existing names of companies registered in Poland. This requirement not only helps to avoid legal conflicts with owners of similar trade marks, but also ensures brand recognition among consumers.\n\nChecking the availability of the name\n\nBefore making the final selection, it is necessary to check the availability of the name by using the database of the National Court Registry (KRS) and the Intellectual Property Office (IPO) for trade marks. This will ensure that the selected name is not registered by another entity.\n\nClarity and simplicity\n\nThe name should be easy to pronounce, memorable and reflect the scope of the company. Avoid using complex and obscure acronyms that can confuse consumers.\n\nInternational adaptability\n\nIf the company plans to operate not only on the Polish market, it is worth thinking about making the name understandable and accepted in other countries. Avoid words that may have negative connotations abroad.\n\nCompliance of the company’s activities\n\nThe name should be appropriate to the type of business you are doing. This is not only a legal requirement, but also an important aspect of branding that helps potential customers immediately understand what your business does.\n\nLegal aspects\n\nMake sure that the name does not violate anyone’s intellectual property rights and does not contain elements prohibited by law. There are certain restrictions in Poland, for example, you cannot use words that offend public morals in the name.\n\nLong-term perspective\n\nWhen choosing a name, think about the long-term vision for your business. It should be flexible enough to accommodate potential expansion or markets, but at the same time reflect the company’s core ethos and values.\n\nConclusion\n\nChoosing a company name in Poland is not only a marketing issue, but also a legal necessity. The right name can play a significant role in the success of a business, ensuring that it is recognisable and differentiated from competitors. During the selection process, it is worth carefully researching potential names for uniqueness and legal compliance, as well as assessing their attractiveness and memorability to the target audience.\n\nBusiness Register in Poland\n\nThe business register in Poland, known as the National Court Register (Krajowy Rejestr Sądowy, KRS), is a key element of the country’s legal and economic system. This register ensures the transparency of the business environment by providing up-to-date information on all registered legal entities, including companies, foundations and other organisations.

The registration process requires careful preparation and compliance with all legal requirements. However, successful registration opens up a company to a wide range of opportunities to develop its business, enhance its prestige and expand its commercial relations."
