        "text": "Our manufacturing plant in Schaan, Liechtenstein specializes in metal anchors, direct fastening elements, such as nails and fasteners, and diamond segments for core bits and saw blades.\n\nThe plant was founded in 1941 and was our first Hilti production facility. It has been extensively expanded and modernized over the years. The facility produced direct fastening elements when it was first opened but other products have been added to the manufacturing line since then.\n\nThe plant is located close to our Hilti Research and Development facilities – that is why our Schaan plant concentrates on developing and manufacturing innovative products before they’re available to our manufacturing plants worldwide. All operations are executed and improved continuously on the basis of Lean Manufacturing. The plant won the Swiss Lean Award, a prize for achieving top performance in lean management, as well as the Manufacturing Excellence Award in the field of process innovation.\n\n360 employees work at our Schaan plant, including around 80 apprentices. The plant is one of the largest vocational training facilities in the Rhine Valley region.\n\nOur plant in Thüringen, Austria specializes in machining technology, component assembly and the final assembly of our tools for drilling and demolition, diamond coring and sawing tools and fastening technology tools.\n\nWith dedicated teams for production technology development, machinery engineering & construction and tool prototype manufacturing plant 4 contributes significantly to innovation and speed in new product introduction.\n\nThe plant was founded 1970 and has steadily expanded since then.\n\nThe most recent expansions were in 2009 with the completion of a new production hall and in 2010 when final assembly production was relocated to Thüringen from our plant in Mauren, Liechtenstein.\n\n400 employees work at the Thüringen plant, including 70 apprentices, making the plant one of the largest centers for vocational training in the region. In 2009 it was named the best vocational training operation in Austria.\n\nOur plant in Kaufering, Germany manufactures motors, premium drill bits, anchor channels, bonded anchors and firestop products.\n\nOur Kaufering plant develops and applies modern manufacturing concepts, technologies and processes, which are then shared with our production plants around the world. Kaufering also creates innovative products working with our marketing and development units.\n\nThe plant operates successfully according to lean manufacturing principles and has won the Manufacturing Excellence Award several times.\n\nThe plant runs a structured energy management system, making responsible use of energy and resources and has ISO 50001 certification.\n\nThe production facility is located near Munich and began operations in 1971.\n\nIt has 500 employees including around 65 apprentices.\n\nChisels, special and lengthy drill bits, rock drill bits, hollow bits, saw blades for wall saws and diamond coring bits are manufactured at the Hilti plant in Kecskemét, Hungary.\n\nThe company was founded in 1989 and production capacity has regularly expanded. From 2004, apart from the manufacturing processes the test activities started with an increasing portfolio. Since 2013 the plant launched the NQA program for the manufacturing of HDA products.\n\nThe first production hall was completed in 1994 with a substantial expansion in 2010. In 2012 the production area was enlarged to cover roughly 12,000 square meters.\n\nThe plant in Kecskemét has established close ties with a number of Hungarian universities and technical colleges.\n\nThe plant employs around 250 people.\n\nEurofox is based in Lanzenkirchen, Austria and was founded in 1993. The Hilti Group acquired the company in July 2011 and expanded the facilities in 2015. Today, the facility hosts manufacturing of Hilti’s innovative range of substructure systems for ventilated facades. It is also home to our development teams for ventilated façades, allowing us to test new solutions and ideas in constant alignment with production and supply.We further operate our own engineering office, which develops specific project designs for end-customers around the globe. Ventilated façade systems made by Eurofox are known for their high quality, long lifetime, high load-bearing capability and energy-efficiency. Hilti ventilated façade substructure systems have been used in many leading construction projects, such as the Gazprom Arena, in St. Petersburg, “The Corniche” towers, in London, or the 264-meter-high Triumph Tower, in Moscow.\n\nOur global center of excellence for pipe fastening is also located at our site, where we develop highly productive and innovative solutions in the field of pipe clamps and pipe shoes.\n\nThe facility employs around 40 people in production and 80 people in office functions."
