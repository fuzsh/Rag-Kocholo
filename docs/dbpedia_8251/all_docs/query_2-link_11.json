Ten years on, there are more than half a billion Alexa devices out there with customers, including Echo devices, Fire TV and Fire tablets, and more - including third-party products such as cars, speakers, and computers.\n\nEvery day, Alexa helps customers with daily tasks, keeps them informed, and manages smart home needs; and Alexa is also helping customers – especially those with disabilities - live more connected, independent, and happy lives. You can learn more about the stories of those customers here.\n\nIn the decade since Amazon acquired IVONA, the number of employees based at the Amazon Development Center in Gdańsk has increased more than tenfold, and from 2012 to 2022, Amazon invested more than PLN 20 billion (€5 billion) in development in Poland.\n\nSince 2010, Amazon has established more than 25 research and development sites across Europe, and invested €215 billion in our operations and innovations in Europe."
