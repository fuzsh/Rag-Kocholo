        "text": "​​​​\n\n1961 was the foundation year of a company that radically transformed a mere vehicle component into a distinctive element with its own unique identity, both in terms of estethics and performance.\n\nIn 2021, Brembo celebrates its first 60 years of history: An entrepreneurial adventure steeped in technological innovation and continuous research in design and performance, which led to a starring role in Motorsport and a constant commitment to sustainability.\n\nIn over 50 years, Brembo’s growth path has been dotted with great technological, sport and commercial successes, which have made the company a top leader in Italy and worldwide – a brand whose name is synonymous with “brakes” the world over. Its successes include the production of the first complete braking system, installed as standard on Guzzi and Laverda motorcycles in 1972; the Formula 1 supply for Ferrari in 1975; the first aluminum caliper and the first carbon discs in the 1980s. And then followed the listing on the stock exchange, the opening of new plants in all countries where the company’s clients operate, the inauguration of the Kilometro Rosso innovation district just outside Bergamo, up to the latest challenges met to respond to the current profound transformations and trends in mobility, now conceived as increasingly electric and sustainable."
