        "text": "Latest industry consultations for mandatory KSeF B2B e-invoicing; Launch: 1st February 2026: April 2026 for taxpayers below PLN 200m sales\n\nThe Polish Ministry of Finance held latest industry pre-consultation workshops on 18 July 2024 for the launch of mandatory B2B e-invoicing National E-invoicing System (‘KSeF’). This is being done two phases from February 2026.\n\nDuring the meeting, the Ministry confirmed:\n\nRevised FA(3) schema will be issued shortly. Previously, the Ministry had said no new schema;\n\nKSeF will allow for adding attachments to issued e-invoices;\n\nnew solutions for local government units.\n\nFull development roadmap September;\n\nOptions for issuing invoices outside of KSeF, including potential 6-month transition period. Micro-taxpayers may be given 6-month transition period (Sept 2025);\n\nFurther pre-consultations will take place in September;\n\nFormal public consultations will follow in the autumn.\n\nIn the meantime, there is an Ombudsman challenge of the data request on the ground of privacy and commercial sensitivities.\n\n1 February 2026 first phase KSeF launch\n\nThe launch dates are:\n\n1 Feb 2026: large taxpayers, over PLN 200 million (€46m) per annum turnover in the previous year; and\n\n1 Apr 2026: other taxpayers.\n\nOriginal July 2024 launch scrapped\n\nThe original plan was for July 2024, but following a technical audit, it has been concluded that a full architecture rebuild is required.\n\nA contract engineer will be appointed, rearchitecture, expanded testing and better documentation, better maintenance planning, training and support for taxpayers.\n\nFollowing a winter of public seminars, the Polish Ministry of Finance had launched a consultation on legislative amendments and software interface specifications issues new launch date. The consultation completed 19 April. Key points from the consultation documents and changes to the original July 2024 regime:\n\nNew fine regime, with initial soft-launch 1-day delay on live reporting\n\nOffline mode for emergency QR Code generation for invoices\n\nProvision to add attachments to e-invoices\n\nVoluntary use of KSeF to issue B2C invoices\n\nLimit on VAT deductibility with PIT or CIT taxpayer’s tax ID number.\n\nChanges to transmission of payment details\n\nLatest proposed amendments to the now abandoned July 2024 launch include:\n\nPossibility to continue using paper invoices for micro taxpayers if no invoice exceed PLN 450 or monthly total invoicing does not exceed PLN 10,000;\n\nLikely 1-day grace period on reporting invoices for initial soft landing phase;\n\nOption for structured attachments for certain supplies (telecoms; electricity, water and similar utilities etc);\n\nThere will be some minor amendments to the SAF-T JPK VAT return, and details will be available in June\n\nMobile phone app to be published in April/May;\n\nEmergency QR Code generation for invoices were service failure and invoices created in ‘offline mode’;\n\nThere will be no phased introduction (which had been suggested), and exempt supplies will be included (had proposed 6-month after taxable supplies);\n\nGuidance for non-residents with Fixed Establishment (and therefore potential liable to report invoices) will be issued soon.\n\nFebruary KSeF consultations reassure taxpayers\n\nThe Ministry’s consultations were held in the second half of February 2024. This follows the delay of the July 2024 mandatory e-invoicing regime for B2B taxpayers. The Ministry has committed to giving at least six months notice of the new launch date and the final revised requirements – which points to Spring or Summer 2025 given all of the new pre-launch plans.\n\nThe consultations provided some early insight into how the delayed mandate may change. This could include:\n\nB2C invoices may be included earlier than planned. Potentially on a voluntary basis at the outset.\n\nReflecting concerns in the EU ViDA Pillar 1 discussions (harmonising e-invoicing), the Ministry may water down requirements on bank payment or identifier details in transaction reporting.\n\nAbandoning phased introduction of the KSeF regime by company size (turnover). Instead go for a big-bang of all companies. This is partially because so much preparation has been made by taxpayers and the supporting services that a large proportion of small businesses are ready. But also that it is difficult to monitor which counter-parties are mandated, and therefore to manage processing vendor invoices properly.\n\nThe Ministry has recommitted to retaining the existing FA(2) scheme until at least post KSeF launch.\n\nJPK_V7 – will be maintained because it contains data that is missing from KSeF\n\nThe Ministry has also published a new Frequently Asked Questions page on its website.\n\n2025 launch date to be announced April or May\n\nThe new launch date will be announced end of April or start of May. A July 2025 date looks likely given the need to avoid clashing with 2024 year-end accounting work at the start of 2025. Plus, all of the Ministry’s plans (to be confirmed 9th February) over the next few months to reboot the launch:\n\nThis month, the Ministry is looking to appoint an outside consultant to audit the technical problems and IT architecture redesign needed to overcome the scaling issues which led to the recent postponement.\n\nIn early May, the Ministry expects to announce a new launch date.\n\nExtensive working groups will be established to ensure an open dialogue on progress towards the 2025 launch. This will be in four groups:\n\nAccountants and tech;\n\nLarge and mid-sized companies;\n\nSmall and micro businesses, including flat-rate payers; and\n\nGroup developing training and communications materials.\n\nThe Ministry does not anticipate any, or major changes to the data schema or deadlines, so taxpayers who have already undertaken significant development work should not be concerned.\n\nBut some changes that are under consideration include:\n\nDelay on the imposition of fines (likely to Spring or Summer 2026) once the mandate is eventually launched;\n\nDelay to mid-2026 for exempt taxpayers;\n\nDelay on inclusion on including invoices from cash registers; and\n\nB2C e-invoicing delays when eventually included.\n\nDuring 2024, new support will be offered to help medium and small enterprises ready themselves for the new launch. This will include:\n\nTo be announced later this month, a round of public consultations on the design and launch of KSeF;\n\nTraining programs on free KSeF software from May 2024 by the local tax offices;\n\nA new free helpline service from the National Tax Administration; and\n\nClarifications of the obligations of non-resident VAT registered taxpayers will be provided. Whilst notionally not obliged to comply with KSeF, questions on their liabilities remain.\n\nIn addition, taxpayer groups have already asked for consideration of:\n\nRemoving obligation for KSeF number in the purchasing declaration of SAF-T VAT return;\n\nObligation to identify taxpayers B2B v B2C status via their NIP number; and\n\nObligation to provide KSeF number on transfers;\n\nExempt taxpayers will be still be brought into the KSeF net, but likely only in mid-2026.\n\nPoland’s existing derogation from the EU VAT Directive to permit mandatory e-invoicing only runs to March 2026. It will therefore have to apply to the European Commission for an extension soon without the benefit of evidence of success.\n\nJan 2023 Non-resident guidance expected for KSeF\n\nAhead of the launch of Polish KSeF B2B e-invoicing, the Ministry of Finance is set to issue guidance for foreign companies providing or receiving supplies within scope of the new mandate. Generally, only foreign businesses with a VAT Permanent Establishment (e.g. offices; staff) are required to issue sales e-invoicing from July next year.\n\nQuestions to be resolved include Polish taxpayer recipients of taxable supplies from non-residents may self-invoice via KSeF, but require authorisation from the foreign counter partly, However, at present, the supplier would need a Polish NIP (tax number).\n\n3 Dec 2023: National e-Invoice System (KSeF) B2B e-invoicing mandate – new public consultation\n\nA new KSeF e-invoicing consultation has been opened this week on two draft pieces of legislation:\n\nUpdated technical regulations covering: QR Codes; new types of authorisations and authentication methods, also in relation to VAT RR and VAT RR CORRECTION invoices; methods of marking with QR codes invoices issued in KSeF and entered into KSeF (in the event of failure or unavailability), made available to the buyer in a way other than in KSeF or used outside KSeF.\n\nChanges to invoice issuance regulations: new rules for VAT exempt invoices which come within KSeF in 2025; invoices for continuous services (e.g. supply of utilities), the documentation of these transactions.\n\n1 Sept 2023: New FA(2) API live\n\nThe new, FA(2) structure production environment is now live, replacing the existing FA(1) logic structure on 1 September 2023.\n\nThe new publications cover:\n\nlogical structure of e-Invoice FA(2)\n\nlogical structure of the FA e-Invoice(1)\n\nSample files for the logical structure of e-Invoice FA(1)\n\nChanges to the draft FA(2) compared to the FA(2) submitted for consultation on 1 December 2022\n\nChanges to FA(2) submitted for consultation on 1 December 2022 compared to FA(1)\n\nLearn about our VAT e-invoicing offering, which not only creates and submits e-invoices to global tax authorities, but is unique in providing full audit against local tax legislation. And since it is build on the same application as our VAT Filer, all of your sales or purchase e-invoices are fully reconciled to your VAT returns.\n\n28 Aug Frequently Asked Questions issued\n\nPoland’s Ministry of Finance has addressed a range of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ’s) for the up-coming 2025 B2B mandate on VAT e-invoices. The questions include:\n\nWill it be possible to mass download invoices in the form of XML and PDF files via the API? Yes, but only in XML.\n\nWill it be possible to perform administrative operations, e.g. appointing invoicing persons and generating authorization tokens via the application provided by the Ministry of Finance? Yes.\n\nAre tokens permanent or do they expire? The generated token remains valid until it is revoked by the user or until the user’s rights are revoked.\n\nHas KSeF undergone or will undergo a security audit conducted by an independent external company? Yes.\n\nDoes KSeF enable checking that the invoice has been downloaded by the buyer? No.\n\nIs it possible to generate a seal in the test environment? Yes.\n\nIs there any redundancy for the application in the event of a failure? What is the expected availability of the application? Yes.\n\nAre the servers of the Ministry of Finance ready to accept large amounts of invoices and archive them? Yes.\n\nWill KSeF indicate broker platforms and when? This isn’t required by KSef.\n\n11 August 2023 – e-invoicing law gazetted; Ministry of Finance issues KSeF regulations\n\nThe legislation implementing mandatory e-invoicing was published in the Polish Journal of Laws on 11 August 2023. Key elements of the law include:\n\nKSeF only applies to domestic B2B invoices\n\nIt will only apply to taxpayers (with a Polish VAT number) established in Poland\n\nInvoices may be issued separately, but must be submitted to KSeF the following day\n\nCash register or simplified invoices may be issued in current form for six months after the launch\n\nThe penalty regime will not be imposed for the first six months of the regime\n\nOSS and IOSS invoices are excluded\n\nTransactions exempt from VAT (e.g. financial services) are out-of-scope until six months after the launch\n\nMinister of Finance also issued amending regulations on the use of the National e-Invoice System due to become mandatory. There will be a public consultation on these regulations.\n\nThe latest amendments, which the Ministry is aiming to implement this October for the existing, voluntary regime, mainly concern the procedures for group companies, including branches and internal units. It is hoped these changes will encourage early, voluntary adoption.\n\nFree KSeF App to be available early 2024\n\nThe Polish Ministry of Finance is to offer a new free mobile application for taxpayers to report e-invoices – which will be mandated for all from 2025. The App will enable the real-time creation, submission of sales e-invoices. It will also allow for the receipt and review of purchase e-invoices.\n\nMarch 2023: New draft law KSeF\n\nThe latest draft law for the introduction of mandatory e-invoicing in Poland has been published on 17 March 2023. This confirmed the exclusion of B2C B2C transactions. This draft added some additional points, including:\n\nissuing invoices in the case of a failure of the KSeF platform, and deadlines;\n\npenalties for not issuing an e-invoice will be 100% of the invoice value (and not just the VAT amount);\n\nthe idea of adjustments notes for purchasers has been dropped;\n\nclarification that whilst non-residents with Fixed Establishment are in scope, only when transactions are related to the FE status; and\n\nhow to record FX rates where they are to be set on the date of invoice settlement.\n\nSince the first publication of the law, the EU’s VAT in the Digital Age proposed reforms have been published. This will require member states to adopt structured e-invoicing for cross-border e-invoices from 2028. This isn’t provided for in KSeF.\n\nFeb 2023 – Ministry of Finance delays entry into force of mandatory B2B e-invoicing for six months until 1 July 2024\n\nThe Ministry of Finance plans to extend the date of entry into force of the National e-Invoice System. The obligation to issue electronic invoices will come into effect on July 1, 2024, and for taxpayers exempt from VAT – on January 1, 2025. B2C transactions remain exempt. There will also be a penalty moratorium between July and December 2024. The National E-invoicing System (NeIS) will not apply to tickets treated as invoices (including toll tickets). In addition, cash register invoices and simplified invoices can be issued in their current form until 31 December 2024.\n\nThe Ministry of Finance also announced SLIM VAT 4, the latest round of compliance reforms for 2024.\n\nThis latest delay follows requests from taxpayers and e-invoice service providers for more time to prepare.\n\nThe plan until this change was for 1 January 2024. The original aim had been January 2023.\n\nVATCalc can produce valid KSeF e-invoices via it’s VAT Filer app. Contact us to see full demo.\n\nKSeF National e-invoicing System voluntary launched 2022; mandatory 2025 following EU approval\n\nPoland’s Ministry of Finance has introduced voluntary B2B electronic invoices on 1 January 2022 after a delay from 1 October 2021. This is supported with a centralised clearing invoice database – Continuous Transaction Controls (CTC). Businesses using the system will benefit from tax incentives such as fast credit payments. The aim will be to move to mandatory e-invoices by July 2024 for all taxpayers. Voluntary or mandated (1 April 2023) taxpayers can use the KSeF system to create and enter structured XML invoices via specialist software application or free tools from the tax authorities.\n\nThe European Commission granted Polish e-invoicing derogation from the VAT Directive in March 2022.\n\nCheck VAT Calc’s global live VAT invoice transaction and e-invoice reporting tracker to see where else real-time submissions of invoices is being implemented.\n\nRead more in our Polish VAT guide.\n\nKrajowy System e-Fakturr (KSeF) structured e-invoices\n\nThe new invoices, faktura ustrukturyzowana, will initially be optional with paper or other e-invoice formats. They will be reported to a new national e-invoice system, Krajowy System e-Fakturr (KSeF) by either adapted accounting software or through a government reporting portal. This would be via and an Application Programming Interface (API). Alternatively, they may outsource the process to outside certified agents.\n\nThe invoice details must follow the existing Polish rules, but includes additional data, including:\n\nTerms of payment\n\nAny settlement details\n\nPayment of any related customs\n\nThe e-invoice will then be given a unique ID number following basic validation checks. The e-invoice will only become valid VAT invoices when the customer has accepted them. If a customer refuses the invoice alternative delivery will have to negotiated. There are a number of different ways to obtain the electronic certification.\n\nThe Polish version of the OECD’s Standard Audit File for Tax (SAF-T) was introduced in 2016. Poland SAF-T replaced VAT return from 1 October 2020.\n\nEU harmonised live transaction VAT reporting proposals\n\nEU VAT in the Digital Age reforms include a channel for harmonised Digital Reporting Requirements (DRR) and Continuous Transaction Controls (CTC) by EU states. This grew from the 2020 Tax Action Plan proposals for a fairer and more efficient EU tax regime.\n\nFor invoice VAT calculations, you can check the right VAT calculations on individual or batch transactions with our Advisor and Auditor tool.\n\nEurope e-invoicing and live reporting"
