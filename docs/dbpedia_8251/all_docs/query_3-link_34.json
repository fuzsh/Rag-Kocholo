        "text": "Language Requirement for Certificates\n\nPoland generally requires certificates for consignments from the United States to be in both English and Polish. [Some border inspection posts (BIPs) may be willing to accept English certificates even without official translations-exporters should have their importers confirm with the BIP prior to shipment if English certificates are acceptable.] In cases where the BIP requires the certificate to be in Polish, the importer can obtain an \"official\" translation of English certificates from any licensed translation service in Poland. In these cases, after APHIS endorses the English version, the U.S. exporter can send the certificate via a courier service to the importer who can then have the translation service attach the Polish translation prior to presentation to the Polish BIP when the consignment arrives. If the importer has questions about whether a particular translation service in Poland is licensed, they should check with the pertinent BIP. Alternatively, the exporter can work with their importer to create a truly bilingual version of the certificate prior to presentation to APHIS for endorsement.\n\nCountry BIP Contact\n\nWET@WETGIW.PL\n\nWhen a Consignment is on Hold in Poland\n\nOnce a consignment is place on hold in Poland, the Polish importer or their agent will be given by the BIP a Notification called a WEZWANIE indicating the deficiency or deficiencies identified by the BIP, and what they consider required to fix the issue. The importer or importer’s representative can pick it up from the BIP, or receive it by fax, email, or regular mail. At any point the importer can appeal the decision to the central authorities by emailing the BIP to appeal the decision.\n\nIt is unlikely that APHIS will be able to gain release of a consignment if it is placed on hold by the BIP since this likely indicates the consignment was exported without having the pertinent requirements verified. However, if the WEZWANIE indicates that the consignment may be able to be released, and if the U.S. exporter is seeking APHIS assistance, the exporter should send the following information to the APHIS Veterinary Services field office that endorsed the original certificate for the consignment:\n\nThe WEZWANIE\n\nEnglish translation of the WEZWANIE\n\nScan of export certificate issued for the consignment\n\nScan of the bill of lading (or airway bill)\n\nA list of materials in the consignment (unless obvious from the certificate)\n\nA description of the intended use in Poland of the materials in the consignment\n\nThe name of the BIP where the material is on hold\n\nContact information for the exporter • Contact information for the importer and if applicable the importer’s agent.\n\nCommodity Specific Information\n\nDiagnostic and research samples (10.93 KB) - June 2014"
