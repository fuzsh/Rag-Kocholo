        "text": "Poland became a member of the European Union (EU) in May 2004. The zloty (PLN) is the official currency in Poland. A value-added tax has existed since 1993, but to harmonize Polish regulations with EU law, this was implemented with a corresponding legislative reform, the Polish VAT Act (adopted on 11/3/2004). Turnover tax in Polish is “Podatek od tomaròw i uslug”. The Polish Ministry of Finance (Ministerstwo Finansów) is responsible for tax issues.\n\nCompanies must apply to the competent tax office to register turnover taxation in Poland. For companies that are not residents or have a branch in Poland, the “Warszawa-Śródmieście Second Revenue Office” is responsible. The authority also issues the VAT ID, and the application can be submitted in person, post or electronically.\n\nContact details:\n\nWarszawa-Śródmieście Second Revenue Office\n\nul. Lindleya 14, 02-013 Warsaw\n\nTel.: 22 58 46 100\n\nNote: Much of the information provided by the Polish authorities is in Polish. Communication with the authorities is also usually in Polish. Companies from EU member states are not obliged to appoint a fiscal representative. However, in the event of language difficulties, it may be helpful to seek assistance.\n\nVATRules knows all the VAT rates you have to calculate in the EU-27 and UK and assigns them to your product groups.\n\nIs the sale of goods taxable or tax-free? Which tax rate is applicable? — Regular, reduced or super-reduced? Which exemptions and re-exemptions apply?\n\nVATRules applies this tax content in your ERP or shop system. Article-specific, always up-to-date, and all EU-27 (plus Norther Ireland)."
