SENATE 2d Session } { 114-3 ====================================================================== TAX CONVENTION WITH POLAND _______ February 8, 2016.--Ordered to be printed _______ Mr. Corker, from the Committee on Foreign Relations, submitted the following REPORT [To accompany Treaty Doc. 113-5] The Committee on Foreign Relations, to which was referred the Convention between the United States of America and the Republic of Poland For the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income (the ``Convention'') (Treaty Doc. 113-5), having considered the same, reports favorably thereon with one declaration, as indicated in the resolution of advice and consent, and recommends that the Senate give its advice and consent to ratification thereof, as set forth in this report and the accompanying resolution of advice and consent.

Annex 1.--Technical Explanation..................................6 I. Purpose The purpose of the Convention is to promote and facilitate trade and investment between the United States and Poland. The proposed Convention replaces the existing convention, signed in 1974, and would bring United States-Poland tax treaty relations into closer conformity with current U.S. tax treaty policies. The Convention contains rigorous protections designed to protect against ``treaty shopping,'' which is the inappropriate use of a tax treaty by third-country residents, that are not contained in the existing treaty. While the proposed Convention generally follows the 2006 U.S. Model Income Tax Treaty (the ``U.S. Model''), it deviates from the U.S. Model in certain respects discussed below. II. Background The United States has a tax treaty with Poland that is currently in force, which was concluded in 1974 (Convention between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Polish People's Republic for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Income, and a related exchange of notes, signed at Washington on October 8, 1974.). The new Convention was negotiated to bring United States-Poland tax treaty relations into closer conformity with current United States tax treaty policies. For example, the proposed Convention contains comprehensive provisions designed to address ``treaty- shopping.'' The existing Convention with Poland signed in 1974 does not contain treaty shopping protections and, as a result, is susceptible to abuse by third-country investors. III. Major Provisions A detailed article-by-article analysis of the Convention may be found in the Technical Explanation Published by the Department of the Treasury on June 19, 2014, which is included at Annex 1 to this report. In addition, the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation prepared an analysis of the Convention, JCX-68-14 (June 17, 2014), which was of great assistance to the committee in reviewing the Convention. A summary of the key provisions of the Convention is set forth below. LIMITATION ON BENEFITS Consistent with current U.S. tax treaty policy, the proposed Convention includes a ``Limitation on Benefits'' provision, which is designed to avoid treaty-shopping by limiting the indirect use of a treaty's benefits by persons who were not intended to take advantage of those benefits. The limitation of benefits provision states that a corporation or similar entity resident in a contracting state (i.e., the United States or Poland) is not entitled to the benefits of the treaty unless that entity meets certain tests, such as carrying on an active trade or business, or being a publicly-traded company on certain specified stock exchanges. The provision is designed to identify entities that have established residency for tax-abuse purposes. DIVIDENDS Although the treatment of dividends in the proposed Convention is generally consistent with the U.S. and OECD Model treaties, the proposed Convention does not provide for the complete exemption from withholding tax for certain direct dividends as is found in several recent U.S. tax treaties. Article 10 of the Convention includes a five percent withholding rate on direct dividends (where a 10 percent ownership threshold is met) and 15 percent on all other dividends. The proposed Convention allows for a zero percent withholding rate on certain dividends received by pension funds. EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION The proposed Convention provides the authority for the two countries to exchange tax information that is foreseeably relevant to carrying out the provisions of the proposed Convention or the domestic tax laws of either country. The proposed Convention allows the United States to obtain information (including from financial institutions) from Poland regardless of whether Poland needs the information for its own tax purposes. IV. Entry Into Force Article 28 states that the proposed Convention shall enter into force when both the United States and Poland have notified each other that they have completed all required internal procedures for entry into force. For withholding taxes, the proposed Convention will have effect for amounts paid or credited on or after the first day of the second month following the date on which the proposed treaty enters into force. For other taxes, the proposed Convention has effect for taxable years beginning on or after January 1 of the calendar year immediately following the date on which the Convention enters into force. V. Implementing Legislation As is the case generally with income tax treaties, the Convention is self-executing and does not require implementing legislation for the United States. VI. Committee Action The committee held a public hearing on the Convention on October 29, 2015. Testimony was received from Robert Stack, Deputy Assistant Secretary (International Tax Affairs) at the U.S. Department of the Treasury and Thomas Barthold, Chief of Staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation. A transcript of the hearing is included in Annex 2 of Executive Report 114-1. On November 10, 2015, the committee considered the Protocol and ordered it favorably reported by voice vote, with a quorum present and without objection. In the 113th Congress, on April 1, 2014, the committee considered the Protocol and ordered it favorably reported by voice vote, with a quorum present and without objection. VII. Committee Comments The Committee on Foreign Relations believes that the Convention will stimulate increased trade and investment, reduce treaty shopping incentives, and promote closer co- operation between the United States and Poland. The committee therefore urges the Senate to act promptly to give advice and consent to ratification of the Convention, as set forth in this report and the accompanying resolution of advice and consent. A. LIMITATION ON BENEFITS The committee applauds the Treasury Department's significant efforts to address treaty shopping both in this Convention and in other bilateral tax treaties. After careful examination of this Convention, as well as testimony and responses to questions for the record from the Treasury Department, the committee is of the view that the Convention's protections against treaty-shopping are robust and will substantially deny treaty shoppers the benefit of the Convention. The committee believes that it is critical for the Treasury Department to closely monitor and keep the committee informed on the effectiveness of the above-mentioned provisions in discouraging and eliminating treaty-shopping under the Convention. B. INFORMATION EXCHANGE The Convention would replace the existing Convention's tax information exchange provisions with updated rules that are consistent with current U.S. tax treaty practice. The Convention would allow the tax authorities of each country to exchange information relevant to carrying out the provisions of the Convention or the domestic tax laws of either country. It would also enable the United States to obtain information (including from financial institutions) from Poland whether or not Poland needs the information for its own tax purposes. After careful examination of this Convention, as well as witness testimony and responses to questions for the record, the committee believes that the exchange of information provisions in the Convention will substantially aid in the full and fair enforcement of United States tax laws. According to witness testimony, the ``foreseeably relevant'' standard used in the Convention does not represent a lower threshold than the standard found in earlier U.S. tax treaties. Witnesses also testified that the ``foreseeably relevant'' standard has been extensively defined in internationally agreed guidance to which no country has expressed a dissenting opinion to date. The committee is also of the view that the Convention provides adequate provisions to ensure that any information exchanged pursuant to the Convention is treated confidentially. In sum, the committee believes these provisions on information exchange are important to the administration of U.S. tax laws and the Convention provides adequate protection against the misuse of information exchanged pursuant to the Convention. C. DECLARATION ON THE SELF-EXECUTING NATURE OF THE CONVENTION The committee has included one declaration in the recommended resolution of advice and consent. The declaration states that the Convention is self-executing, as is the case generally with income tax treaties. Prior to the 110th Congress, the committee generally included such statements in the committee's report, but in light of the Supreme Court decision in Medellin v. Texas, 128 S. Ct. 1346 (2008), the committee determined that a clear statement in the Resolution is warranted. A further discussion of the committee's views on this matter can be found in Section VIII of Executive Report 110-12. VIII. Text of Resolution of Advice and Consent to Ratification Resolved (two-thirds of the Senators present concurring therein), SECTION 1. SENATE ADVICE AND CONSENT SUBJECT TO A DECLARATION The Senate advises and consents to the ratification of the Convention between the United States of America and the Republic of Poland for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income, signed on February 13, 2013, at Warsaw (the ``Convention'') (Treaty Doc. 113-5), subject to the declaration of section 2. SECTION 2. DECLARATION The advice and consent of the Senate under section 1 is subject to the following declaration: The Convention is self-executing. IX. Annex 1.--Technical Explantion DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY TECHNICAL EXPLANATION OF THE CONVENTION BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION AND THE PREVENTION OF FISCAL EVASION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES ON INCOME This is a Technical Explanation of the Convention between the United States and the Republic of Poland for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income, signed at Warsaw on February 13, 2013 (the ``Convention''). Negotiations took into account the U.S. Treasury Department's current tax treaty policy, and the Treasury Department's Model Income Tax Convention, published on November 15, 2006 (the ``U.S. Model.'' Negotiations also took into account the Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital, published by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (the ``OECD Model''), and recent tax treaties concluded by the United States and Poland. The Technical Explanation is an official guide to the Convention. It reflects the policies behind particular Convention provisions, as well as understandings reached during the negotiations with respect to the application and interpretation of the Convention. References in the Technical Explanation to ``he'' or ``his'' should be read to mean ``he or she'' or ``his or her,'' respectively. References to the ``Code'' are to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. References to a ``Treas. Reg.'' are to regulations issued under the Code by the Internal Revenue Service and the Treasury Department. ARTICLE 1 (GENERAL SCOPE) Paragraph 1 Paragraph 1 of Article 1 provides that the Convention applies only to residents of one or both Contracting States except where the terms of the Convention provide otherwise. Under Article 4 (Resident) a person is generally treated as a resident of a Contracting State if that person is, under the laws of that State, liable to tax therein by reason of domicile, citizenship, residence, or any other criterion of a similar nature. However, if a person is considered a resident of both Contracting States, Article 4 provides rules for determining a single Contracting State of residence (or no Contracting State of residence). This determination governs for all purposes of the Convention. Certain provisions are applicable to persons who may not be residents of either Contracting State. For example, paragraph 1 of Article 24 (Non-Discrimination) applies to nationals of the Contracting States. In addition, under Article 26 (Exchange of Information), information may be exchanged with respect to residents of third states. Paragraph 2 Paragraph 2 states the generally accepted relationship both between the Convention and domestic law and between the Convention and other agreements between the Contracting States. That is, no provision in the Convention may restrict any exclusion, exemption, deduction, credit or other benefit accorded by the laws of either Contracting State, or by any other agreement to which both Contracting States are parties. The relationship between the non-discrimination provisions of the Convention and the General Agreement on Trade in Services (the ``GATS'') is addressed in paragraph 3. Under paragraph 2, for example, if a deduction would be allowed under the Code in computing the U.S. taxable income of a resident of Poland, the deduction also is allowed to that person in computing taxable income under the Convention. Paragraph 2 also means that the Convention may not increase the tax burden on a resident of a Contracting State beyond the burden determined under domestic law. Thus, a right to tax given by the Convention cannot be exercised unless that right also exists under domestic law. It follows that, under the principle of paragraph 2, a taxpayer's U.S. tax liability need not be determined under the Convention if the Code would produce a more favorable result. A taxpayer may not, however, choose among the provisions of the Code and the Convention in an inconsistent manner in order to minimize tax. Thus, a taxpayer may use the Convention to reduce its taxable income, but may not combine both treaty and Code rules where doing so would be inconsistent with the intent of either set of rules. For example, assume that a resident of Poland has three separate businesses in the United States. One activity is a profitable permanent establishment and the other two are trades or businesses that would earn taxable income under the Code but do not meet the permanent establishment threshold tests of the Convention. One is profitable and the other incurs a loss. Under the Convention, the income of the permanent establishment is taxable in the United States, and both the profit and loss of the other two businesses are ignored. Under the Code, all three would be subject to tax, but the loss would offset the profits of the two profitable ventures. The taxpayer may not invoke the Convention to exclude the profits of the profitable trade or business and invoke the Code to claim the loss of the loss trade or business against the profit of the permanent establishment. (See Rev. Rul. 84- 17, 1984-1 C.B. 308.) If, however, the taxpayer invokes the Code for the taxation of all three ventures, he would not be precluded from invoking the Convention with respect, for example, to any dividend income he may receive from the United States that is not effectively connected with any of his business activities in the United States. Similarly, except as provided in paragraph 3, nothing in the Convention can be used to deny any benefit granted by any other agreement to which both Contracting State are parties. For example, if certain benefits are provided for military personnel or military contractors under a Status of Forces Agreement between the United States and Poland, those benefits or protections will be available to residents of the Contracting States regardless of any provisions to the contrary (or silence) in the Convention. Paragraph 3 Paragraph 3 relates to non-discrimination obligations of the Contracting States under the GATS. The provisions of paragraph 3 are an exception to the rule provided in paragraph 2 of this Article under which the Convention shall not restrict in any manner any benefit now or hereafter accorded by any other agreement between the Contracting States. Subparagraph 3(a) provides that, unless the competent authorities determine that a taxation measure is not within the scope of the Convention, the national treatment obligations of the GATS shall not apply with respect to that measure. Further, any question arising as to the interpretation or application of the Convention, including in particular whether a measure is within the scope of the Convention, shall be considered only by the competent authorities of the Contracting States, and the procedures under the Convention exclusively shall apply to the dispute. Thus, paragraph 3 of Article XXII (Consultation) of the GATS may not be used to bring a dispute before the World Trade Organization unless the competent authorities of both Contracting States have determined that the relevant taxation measure is not within the scope of Article 24 (Non- Discrimination) of the Convention. The term ``measure'' for these purposes is defined broadly in subparagraph 3(b). It would include a law, regulation, rule, procedure, decision, administrative action or any other similar provision or action. Paragraph 4 Paragraph 4 contains the traditional saving clause found in all U.S. income tax treaties. The Contracting States reserve their rights, except as provided in paragraph 5, to tax their residents and citizens as provided under their domestic laws, notwithstanding any provisions of the Convention to the contrary. For example, if a resident of Poland performs professional services in the United States and the income from the services is not attributable to a permanent establishment in the United States, Article 7 (Business Profits) would by its terms prevent the United States from taxing the income. If, however, the resident of Poland is also a citizen of the United States, the saving clause permits the United States to include the remuneration in the worldwide income of the citizen and subject it to tax under the normal Code rules (i.e., without regard to Code section 894(a)). Subparagraph 5(a) of Article 1 also preserves the benefits of special foreign tax credit rules applicable to the U.S. taxation of certain U.S. income of its citizens resident in the other Contracting State. See paragraph 4 of Article 23 (Relief from Double Taxation). For purposes of the saving clause, ``residence'' is determined under Article 4 (Resident). Thus, an individual who is a resident of the United States under the Code (but not a U.S. citizen) but who is determined to be a resident of the Poland under the tie-breaker rules of Article 4 would be subject to U.S. tax only to the extent permitted by the Convention. The United States would not be permitted to apply its domestic law to that person to the extent that its law is inconsistent with the Convention. However, the person would still be treated as a U.S. resident for U.S. tax purposes other than determining the individual's U.S. tax liability. For example, in determining under Code section 957 whether a foreign corporation is a controlled foreign corporation, shares in that corporation held by the individual would be considered to be held by a U.S. resident. As a result, other U.S. citizens or residents might be deemed to be United States shareholders of a controlled foreign corporation subject to current inclusion of subpart F income recognized by the corporation. See Treas. Reg. section 301.7701(b)-7(a)(3). Under paragraph 4, each Contracting State also reserves its right to tax former citizens and former long-term residents in accordance with domestic law for a period of ten years following the loss of such status. Thus, paragraph 4 allows the United States to tax former U.S. citizens and former U.S. long- term residents in accordance with Code section 877. Section 877 generally applies to a former citizen or long-term resident of the United States who relinquishes citizenship or terminates long-term residency before June 17, 2008 if he fails to certify that he has complied with U.S. tax laws during the 5 preceding years, or if either of the following criteria exceed established thresholds: (a) the average annual net income tax of such individual for the period of 5 taxable years ending before the date of the loss of status; or (b) the net worth of such individual as of the date of the loss of status. The United States defines ``long-term resident'' as an individual (other than a U.S. citizen) who is a lawful permanent resident of the United States in at least 8 of the prior 15 taxable years. An individual is not treated as a lawful permanent resident of the United States for any taxable year in which the individual is treated as a resident of Poland under this Convention, or as a resident of any country other than the United States under the provisions of any other U.S. tax treaty, and the individual does not waive the benefits of the relevant tax treaty. Paragraph 5 Paragraph 5 sets forth certain exceptions to the saving clause. The referenced provisions are intended to provide benefits to citizens and residents even if such benefits do not exist under domestic law. Subparagraph 5(a) lists certain provisions of the Convention that are applicable to all citizens and residents of a Contracting State, despite the general saving clause rule of paragraph 4: (1) Paragraph 2 of Article 9 (Associated Enterprises) grants the right to a correlative adjustment with respect to income tax due on profits reallocated under Article 9. (2) Paragraphs 2, 3 and 5 of Article 18 (Pensions, Social Security, Annuities, Alimony and Child Support) provide exemptions from source or residence State taxation for certain pension distributions, social security payments, alimony and child support. (3) Article 23 (Relief from Double Taxation) confirms to citizens and residents of one Contracting State the benefit of a credit for income taxes paid to the other or an exemption for income earned in the other State. In addition, paragraph 5 of Article 23 coordinates the tax systems of the Contracting States to avoid double taxation that could result from the imposition of an exit tax or similar regime on an individual who ceases to be treated as a resident (as determined under paragraph 1 of Article 4 (Resident)) of one Contracting State and becomes a resident of the other Contracting State. (4) Article 24 (Non-Discrimination) protects residents and nationals of one Contracting State against the adoption of certain discriminatory taxation practices in the other Contracting State. (5) Article 25 (Mutual Agreement Procedure) confers certain benefits on citizens and residents of the Contracting States in order to reach and implement solutions to disputes between the two Contracting States. Subparagraph 5(b) provides a different set of exceptions to the saving clause. The benefits referred to are all intended to be granted to temporary residents of a Contracting State (for example, in the case of the United States, holders of non- immigrant visas), but not to citizens or to persons who have acquired permanent residence in that State. If beneficiaries of these provisions travel from one Contracting State to the other, and remain in the other long enough to become residents under its internal law, but do not acquire permanent residence status (i.e., in the U.S. context, they do not become ``green card'' holders) and are not citizens of that State, the host State will continue to grant these benefits even if they conflict with the statutory rules. The benefits preserved by this paragraph are: the host country exemptions for government service salaries and pensions under Article 19 (Government Service), certain income of visiting students and trainees under Article 20 (Students and Trainees) and the income of diplomatic agents and consular officers and under Article 27 (Members of Diplomatic Missions and Consular Posts). Paragraph 6 Paragraph 6 addresses special issues presented by the payment of items of income, profit or gain to entities that are fiscally transparent, such as partnerships, estates and trusts. Because countries may take different views as to when an entity is fiscally transparent, the risk of both double taxation and double non-taxation is relatively high. The provision, and the corresponding requirements of the substantive rules of the other Articles of the Convention, should be read with two goals in mind. First, the intention of paragraph 6 is to eliminate a number of technical problems that could prevent investors using such entities from claiming treaty benefits, even though such investors would be subject to tax on the income derived through such entities. Second, the provision prevents a resident of a Contracting State from claiming treaty benefits in circumstances where the resident investing in the entity does not take into account the item of income paid to the entity because the entity is not fiscally transparent in its State of residence. In general, the principles incorporated in this paragraph reflect the regulations under Treas. Reg. section 1.894-1(d). Treas. Reg. 1.894-1(d)(3)(iii) provides that an entity will be fiscally transparent under the laws of an interest holder's jurisdiction with respect to an item of income to the extent that the laws of that jurisdiction require the interest holder resident in that jurisdiction to separately take into account on a current basis the interest holder's respective share of the item of income paid to the entity, whether or not distributed to the interest holder, and the character and source of the item in the hands of the interest holder are determined as if such item were realized directly by the interest holder. Entities falling under this description in the United States include partnerships, corporations that have made a valid election to be taxed under Subchapter S of Chapter 1 of the Code (``S corporations''), common investment trusts under section 584, simple trusts and grantor trusts. This paragraph also applies to payments made to other entities, such as U.S. limited liability companies (``LLCs''), that may be treated as either partnerships or as disregarded as a separate entity for U.S. tax purposes. Except as otherwise provided under subparagraph 6(b), under subparagraph 6(a), an item of income, profit or gain derived by or through such a fiscally transparent entity will be considered to be derived by a resident of a Contracting State if a resident is treated under the taxation laws of that State as deriving the item of income. For example, if a company that is a resident of Poland pays interest to an entity that is treated as fiscally transparent for U.S. tax purposes, the interest will be considered derived by a resident of the United States, but only to the extent that the taxation laws of the United States treats one or more U.S. residents (whose status as U.S. residents is determined, for this purpose, under U.S. tax law) as deriving the interest for U.S. tax purposes. Where the entity is a partnership, the persons who are, under U.S. tax laws, treated as partners of the entity would normally be the persons whom the U.S. tax laws would treat as deriving the interest income through the partnership. Also, it follows that persons whom the United States treats as partners but who are not U.S. residents for U.S. tax purposes may not claim a benefit under the Convention for the interest paid to the partnership, because such third-country partners are not residents of the United States for purposes of claiming this benefit. If, however, the country in which the third-country partners are treated as resident for tax purposes, as determined under the laws of that country, has an income tax convention with Poland, they may be entitled to claim a benefit under that convention (these results would also follow in the case of an entity that is disregarded as a separate entity under the laws of one jurisdiction but not the other, such as a single-owner entity that is viewed as a branch for U.S. tax purposes and as a corporation for tax purposes under the laws of Poland). In contrast, where the entity is organized under U.S. laws and is classified as a corporation for U.S. tax purposes, interest paid by a company that is a resident of Poland to the U.S. corporation will be considered derived by a resident of the United States since the U.S. corporation is treated under U.S. taxation laws as a resident of the United States and as deriving the income. Under subparagraph 6(a), the same result would be reached even if the tax laws of Poland would treat the entity differently (e.g., if the entity were not treated as fiscally transparent in Poland in the first example above where the entity is treated as a partnership for U.S. tax purposes). Similarly, the characterization of the entity in a third country is also irrelevant, even if the entity is organized in that third country, although subparagraph 6(b) imposes an additional requirement in the case of entities organized in a third country. Subparagraph 6(b) imposes an additional requirement in cases of payments through an entity that is organized in a third country. In such cases, if the entity is not treated as fiscally transparent under the laws of the State in which the income, profit or gains arises, and if the entity is eligible in its own right for benefits under a convention for the avoidance of double taxation between the third state and the State in which the income, profit or gain arises with respect to the particular item of income, profit or gain that are more favorable than the benefits provided under the Convention with respect to that item, subparagraph 6(a) shall not have application. For example, assume that USCo, a corporation resident in the United States, is the sole shareholder of FCo, an entity established in Country F. Under the laws of the United States, FCo is treated as fiscally transparent, but under the laws of Poland, FCo is treated as a corporation. FCo receives Poland-source interest which, under the provisions of Article 11 (Interest) of the Convention, would be subject to tax in Poland at a rate of 5 percent. Pursuant to subparagraph 6(a), USCo would be considered as deriving the Poland-source interest. However, subparagraph 6(b) provides that if the tax treaty between Poland and Country F provides a limitation on the rate of interest withholding that is lower than 5 percent, and if FCo would be eligible for such lower rate in its own right on the payment of interest, USCo shall not be deemed as deriving the interest payment. Nevertheless, FCo may claim the more favorable treaty benefits from Poland in its own right under the tax treaty between Poland and Country F. The principles of paragraph 6 apply to trusts to the extent that they are fiscally transparent in either Contracting State. For example, suppose that X, a resident of Poland, creates a revocable trust in the United States and names persons resident in a third country as the beneficiaries of the trust. If, under the laws of Poland, X is treated as taking the trust's income into account for tax purposes, the trust's income would be regarded as being derived by a resident of Poland. In contrast, since the determination of deriving an item of income, profit or gain is made on an item by item basis, it is possible that, in the case of a U.S. non-grantor trust, the trust itself may be able to claim benefits with respect to certain items of income, such as capital gains, so long as it is a resident liable to tax on such gains, but not with respect to other items of income that are treated as income of the trust's interest holders. As noted above, paragraph 6 is not an exception to the saving clause of paragraph 4. Accordingly, paragraph 6 does not prevent a Contracting State from taxing an entity that is treated as a resident of that State under its tax law. For example, if a U.S. LLC with members who are residents of Poland elects to be taxed as a corporation for U.S. tax purposes, the United States will tax that LLC on its worldwide income on a net basis, without regard to whether Poland views the LLC as fiscally transparent. ARTICLE 2 (TAXES COVERED) This Article specifies the U.S. taxes and the taxes of Poland to which the Convention applies. With two exceptions, the taxes specified in Article 2 are the covered taxes for all purposes of the Convention. A broader coverage applies for purposes of Articles 24 (Non-Discrimination) and 26 (Exchange of Information). Article 24 applies with respect to all taxes, including those imposed by state and local governments. Article 26 applies with respect to all taxes imposed at the national level. Paragraph 1 Paragraph 1 identifies the category of taxes to which the Convention applies. Paragraph 1 is based on the OECD Model and defines the scope of application of the Convention. The Convention applies to taxes on income, including gains, imposed on behalf of a Contracting State, irrespective of the manner in which they are levied. Except with respect to Article 24 (Non- Discrimination), state and local taxes are not covered by the Convention. Paragraph 2 Paragraph 2 also is based on the OECD Model and provides a definition of taxes on income and on capital gains. The Convention covers taxes on total income or any part of income and includes tax on gains derived from the alienation of property. The Convention does not apply, however, to social security or unemployment taxes, or any other charges where there is a direct connection between the levy and individual benefits. The Convention also does not apply to property taxes, except with respect to Article 24 (Non-Discrimination) or to Article 26 (Exchange of Information) to the extent that such property taxes are imposed at the national level. Paragraph 3 Paragraph 3 lists the taxes in force at the time of signature of the Convention to which the Convention applies. The existing covered taxes of Poland are identified in subparagraph 3(a) as the personal income tax and the corporate income tax, hereinafter referred to as ``Polish tax''. Subparagraph 3(b) provides that the existing U.S. taxes subject to the rules of the Convention are the Federal income taxes imposed by the Code, together with the Federal taxes imposed on the investment income of foreign private foundations (Code sections 4940 through 4948) hereinafter referred to as ``United States tax.'' Social security and unemployment taxes (Code sections 1401, 3101, 3111 and 3301) are specifically excluded from coverage. Paragraph 4 Under paragraph 4, the Convention will apply to any taxes that are identical, or substantially similar, to those enumerated in paragraph 3, and which are imposed in addition to, or in place of, the existing taxes after February 13, 2013, the date of signature of the Convention. The paragraph also provides that the competent authorities of the Contracting States will notify each other of any significant changes to their taxation laws. ARTICLE 3 (GENERAL DEFINITIONS) Article 3 provides general definitions and rules of interpretation applicable throughout the Convention. Certain other terms are defined in other articles of the Convention. For example, the term ``resident of a Contracting State'' is defined in Article 4 (Resident). The term ``permanent establishment'' is defined in Article 5 (Permanent Establishment). These definitions apply for all purposes of the Convention. Other terms, such as ``dividends,'' ``interest'' and ``royalties'' are defined in specific Articles for purposes of those Articles. Paragraph 1 Paragraph 1 defines a number of basic terms used in the Convention. The introduction to paragraph 1 makes clear that these definitions apply for all purposes of the Convention, unless the context requires otherwise. This latter condition allows flexibility in the interpretation of the Convention in order to avoid results not intended by the Convention's negotiators. Subparagraph 1(a) defines the term ``person'' to include an individual, an estate, a trust, a partnership, a company and any other body of persons. The definition is significant for a variety of reasons. For example, under Article 4, only a ``person'' can be a ``resident'' and therefore eligible for most benefits under the treaty. Also, all ``persons'' are eligible to claim relief under Article 25 (Mutual Agreement Procedure). The term ``company'' is defined in subparagraph 1(b) as a body corporate or an entity treated as a body corporate for tax purposes in the state where it is organized. The definition refers to the law of the state in which an entity is organized in order to ensure that an entity that is treated as fiscally transparent in its country of residence will not get inappropriate benefits, such as the reduced withholding rate provided by subparagraph 2(b) of Article 10 (Dividends). It also ensures that the Limitation on Benefits provisions of Article 22 will be applied at the appropriate level. The terms ``enterprise of a Contracting State'' and ``enterprise of the other Contracting State'' are defined in subparagraph 1(c) as an enterprise carried on by a resident of a Contracting State and an enterprise carried on by a resident of the other Contracting State. An enterprise of a Contracting State need not be carried on in that State. It may be carried on in the other Contracting State or a third state (e.g., a U.S. corporation doing all of its business in Poland would still be a U.S. enterprise). Subparagraph 1(c) further provides that these terms also encompass an enterprise conducted through an entity (such as a partnership) that is treated as fiscally transparent in the Contracting State where the entity's owner is resident. The definition makes this point explicitly to ensure that the purpose of the Convention is not thwarted by an overly technical application of the term ``enterprise of a Contracting State'' to activities carried on through partnerships and similar entities. In accordance with Article 4 (Resident), an entity that is fiscally transparent in the Contracting State in which it is organized is not considered to be a resident of that Contracting State (although income derived through such an entity may be taxed as the income of a resident of a Contracting State to the extent that it is taxed in the hands of resident partners or other resident owners). The definition makes clear that as provided in Article 1 (General Scope) paragraph 6, an enterprise conducted by such an entity will be treated as carried on by a resident of a Contracting State to the extent its partners or other owners are residents. This approach is consistent with Code section 875, which attributes a trade or business conducted by a partnership to its partners and a trade or business conducted by an estate or trust to its beneficiaries. Subparagraph 1(d) defines the term ``enterprise'' as any activity or set of activities that constitutes the carrying on of a business. The term ``business'' is not defined, but subparagraph 1(e) provides that it includes the performance of professional services and other activities of an independent character. Both subparagraphs are identical to definitions added to the OECD Model in connection with the deletion of Article 14 (Independent Personal Services) from the OECD Model in 2000. The inclusion of the two definitions is intended to clarify that income from the performance of professional services or other activities of an independent character is dealt with under Article 7 (Business Profits) and not Article 21 (Other Income). Subparagraph 1(f) defines the term ``international traffic.'' The term means any transport by a ship or aircraft except when such transport is solely between places within a Contracting State. This definition is applicable principally in the context of Article 8 (Shipping and Air Transport). The definition combines with paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article 8 to exempt from tax by the source State: profits from the rental of ships or aircraft on a full (time or voyage) basis; profits from the rental on a bareboat basis of ships or aircraft if the rental income is incidental to profits from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic; profits from the rental on a bareboat basis of ships or aircraft if such ships or aircraft are operated in international traffic by the lessee; and profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State from the use, maintenance, or rental of containers (including trailers, barges, and related equipment for the transport of containers), where such use, maintenance or rental, as the case may be, is incidental to the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic. The exclusion from international traffic of transport solely between places within a Contracting State means, for example, that carriage of goods or passengers solely between New York and Chicago would not be treated as international traffic, whether carried by a U.S. or a foreign carrier. The substantive taxing rules of the Convention relating to the taxation of income from transport, principally Article 8, therefore, would not apply to income from such carriage. Thus, if the carrier engaged in internal U.S. traffic were a resident of Poland (assuming that were possible under U.S. law), the United States would not be required to exempt the income from that transport under Article 8. The income would, however, be treated as business profits under Article 7 (Business Profits), and therefore would be taxable in the United States only if attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment of the foreign carrier, and then only on a net basis. The gross basis U.S. tax imposed by section 887 would not apply under the circumstances described. If, however, goods or passengers are carried by a carrier resident in Poland from a non-U.S. port to, for example, New York, and some of the goods or passengers continue on to Chicago, the entire transport would be international traffic. This would be true if the international carrier transferred the goods at the U.S. port of entry from a ship to a land vehicle, from a ship to a lighter, or even if the overland portion of the trip in the United States was handled by an independent carrier under contract with the original international carrier, so long as both parts of the trip were reflected in original bills of lading. For this reason, the U.S. Model refers, in the definition of ``international traffic,'' to ``such transport'' being solely between places in the other Contracting State, while the OECD Model refers to the ship or aircraft being operated solely between such places. The U.S. Model language is intended to make clear that, as in the above example, even if the goods are carried on a different aircraft for the internal portion of the international voyage than is used for the overseas portion of the trip, the definition applies to that internal portion as well as the external portion. Finally, a ``cruise to nowhere,'' i.e., a cruise beginning and ending in a port in the same Contracting State with no stops in a foreign port, would not constitute international traffic. Subparagraph 1(g) defines the term ``competent authorities'' for Poland and the United States. The U.S. competent authority is the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate. The Secretary of the Treasury has delegated the competent authority function to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, who in turn has delegated the authority to the Deputy Commissioner (International) LB&I. With respect to interpretative issues, the Deputy Commissioner (International) LB&I acts with the concurrence of the Associate Chief Counsel (International) of the Internal Revenue Service. The competent authority in the case of Poland is the Minister of Finance or his authorized representative. The geographical scope of the Convention with respect to Poland is set out in subparagraph 1(h). The term ``Poland'' means the Republic of Poland, including the territorial sea thereof and any area outside the territorial sea of the Republic of Poland designated under its laws and in accordance with international law as an area within which the sovereign rights of the Republic of Poland with respect to the sea bed and sub-soil and their natural resources may be exercised. The geographical scope of the Convention with respect to the United States is set out in subparagraph 1(i). It encompasses the United States of America, including the states, the District of Columbia, and the territorial sea of the United States. The term does not include Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, Guam or any other U.S. possession or territory. For certain purposes, the term ``United States'' includes the sea bed and subsoil of undersea areas adjacent to the territorial sea of the United States. This extension applies to the extent that the United States may exercise sovereignty in accordance with international law for the purpose of natural resource exploration and exploitation of such areas. This extension of the definition applies, however, only if the person, property or activity to which the Convention is being applied is connected with such natural resource exploration or exploitation. Thus, it would not include any activity involving the sea floor of an area over which the United States exercised sovereignty for natural resource purposes if that activity was unrelated to the exploration and exploitation of natural resources. This result is consistent with the result that would be obtained under Code section 638, which treats the continental shelf as part of the United States for purposes of natural resource exploration and exploitation. The term ``national,'' as it relates to the United States and to Poland, is defined in subparagraph 1(j). This term is relevant for purposes of Article 4 (Resident), Article 19 (Government Service) and Article 24 (Non-Discrimination). A national of one of the Contracting States is either an individual who is a citizen or national of that State, or any legal person, partnership or association deriving its status, as such, from the law in force in the State where it is established. Subparagraph 1(k) defines the term ``pension fund.'' The term means any person that is established in a Contracting State and satisfies two criteria. First, as provided in clause 1(k)(i), the person must be generally exempt from income taxation in the Contracting State in which it is established. Second, as provided in clause 1(k)(ii), the person must be operated principally either to administer or provide pension or retirement benefits, or to earn income for the benefit of one or more persons established in the same Contracting State that are generally exempt from income taxation in that Contracting State and are operated principally to administer or provide pension or retirement benefits. The definition recognizes that pension funds sometimes administer or provide benefits other than pension or retirement benefits, such as death benefits. However, in order for the fund to be considered a pension fund for purposes of the Convention, the provision of any other such benefits must be merely incidental to the fund's principal activity of administering or providing pension or retirement benefits. The definition also ensures that if a fund is a collective fund that earns income for the benefit of other funds, then substantially all of the funds that participate in the collective fund must be residents of the same Contracting State as the collective fund and must be entitled to benefits under the Convention in their own right. In the case of the United States, the term ``pension fund'' includes the following: a trust providing pension or retirement benefits under a Code section 401(a) qualified pension plan (which includes a Code section 401(k) plan); a profit sharing or stock bonus plan; a Code section 403(a) qualified annuity plan; a Code section 403(b) plan; a trust that is an individual retirement account under Code section 408; a Roth individual retirement account under Code section 408A or a simple retirement account under Code section 408(p); a trust providing pension or retirement benefits under a simplified employee pension plan under Code section 408(k); a trust described in section 457(g) providing pension or retirement benefits under a Code section 457(b) plan; and the Thrift Savings Fund (section 7701(j)). A group trust described in Rev. Rul. 81-100, as amended by Rev. Rul. 2004-67 and Rev. Rul. 2011-1, qualifies as a pension fund only if substantially all of its activity is to earn income for the benefit of pension funds that are themselves entitled to benefits under the Convention as a resident of the United States. Paragraph 2 Terms that are not defined in the Convention are dealt with in paragraph 2. Paragraph 2 provides that in the application of the Convention, any term used but not defined in the Convention will have the meaning that it has under the domestic law of the Contracting State whose tax is being applied, unless the context requires otherwise. If the term is defined under both the tax and non-tax laws of a Contracting State, the definition in the tax law will take precedence over the definition in the non-tax laws. Finally, there also may be cases where the tax laws of a State contain multiple definitions of the same term. In such a case, the definition used for purposes of the particular provision at issue, if any, should be used. The reference in paragraph 2 to the domestic law of a Contracting State means the law in effect at the time the treaty is being applied, not the law as in effect at the time the treaty was signed. The use of ``ambulatory'' definitions, however, may lead to results that are at variance with the intentions of the negotiators and of the Contracting States when the treaty was negotiated and ratified. The inclusion in both paragraphs 1 and 2 of an exception to the generally applicable definitions where the ``context otherwise requires'' is intended to address this circumstance. Where reflecting the intent of the Contracting States requires the use of a definition that is different from a definition under paragraph 1 or the law of the Contracting State applying the Convention, that definition will apply. Thus, flexibility in defining terms is necessary and permitted. ARTICLE 4 (RESIDENT) This Article sets forth rules for determining whether a person is a resident of a Contracting State for purposes of the Convention. As a general matter, only residents of the Contracting States may claim the benefits of the Convention. The treaty definition of residence is to be used only for purposes of the Convention. The fact that a person is determined to be a resident of a Contracting State under Article 4 does not automatically entitle that person to the benefits of the Convention. In order to obtain the benefits of the Convention, such person must satisfy all applicable requirements specified in the Convention, including other applicable requirements of Article 1 (General Scope), beneficial ownership and Article 22 (Limitation on Benefits). The determination of residence for treaty purposes looks first to a person's liability to tax as a resident under the respective taxation laws of the Contracting States. As a general matter, a person is liable to tax as a resident under the domestic laws of one Contracting State and not of the other need look no further. For purposes of the Convention, that person is a resident of the State in which he is liable to tax as resident under domestic law. If, however, a person is liable to tax as a resident under the domestic laws of both Contracting States, the Article uses tie-breaker rules to assign a single State of residence (or no State of residence) to such a person for purposes of the Convention. Paragraph 1 The term ``resident of a Contracting State'' is defined in paragraph 1. In general, this definition incorporates the definitions of residence in U.S. and Polish law by referring to a resident as a person who, under the laws of a Contracting State, is liable to tax therein by reason of his domicile, residence, citizenship, place of management, place of incorporation or any other similar criterion. Thus, residents of the United States include aliens who are considered U.S. residents under Code section 7701(b), entities organized in the United States and that have elected under Treas. Reg. 301.7701- 2 to be taxed by the United States as a corporation, and companies that are treated as domestic corporations under Code section 7874(b). Paragraph 1 also specifically includes the two Contracting States, and political subdivisions and local authorities of the two States, as residents for purposes of the Convention. The fact that a particular entity does not pay tax in practice will not necessarily mean that the entity is not a resident. An entity that is not fiscally transparent in its Contracting State of residence for purposes of paragraph 6 of Article 1 (General Scope), and is not unconditionally exempt from tax, will generally be treated as a resident for purposes of the Convention. This is generally true even for an entity that, in practice, is not required to pay tax if it meets certain requirements with respect to its activities, types of income, or distribution practices. For example, a U.S. Regulated Investment Company (RIC) and a U.S. Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) are residents of the United States for purposes of the treaty. These entities are taxable to the extent that they do not currently distribute their profits, and therefore may be regarded as liable to tax, even though these entities do not generally have taxable income in practice. They also must satisfy a number of requirements under the Code in order to be entitled to their particular tax treatment. A person who is liable to tax in a Contracting State only in respect of income from sources within that State or of profits attributable to a permanent establishment in that State will not be treated as a resident of that Contracting State for purposes of the Convention. Thus, a consular official of the other Contracting State who is posted in the United States, who may be subject to U.S. tax on U.S. source investment income, but is not taxable in the United States on non-U.S. source income (see Code section 7701(b)(5)(B)), would not be considered a resident of the United States for purposes of the Convention. Similarly, an enterprise of Poland with a permanent establishment in the United States is not, by virtue of that permanent establishment, a resident of the United States. The enterprise generally is subject to U.S. tax only with respect to its income that is attributable to the U.S. permanent establishment, not with respect to its worldwide income, as it would be if it were a U.S. resident. Paragraph 2 Paragraph 2 provides that entities such as pension funds as defined in Article 3 (General Definitions) and legal persons organized under the laws of a Contracting State and established exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, artistic, cultural, or educational purposes are residents of the Contracting State in which they are established or organized. Such persons are liable to tax, notwithstanding that all or part of its income or gains may be exempt from tax under the domestic laws of that State. Thus, a section 501(c) organization organized in the United States (such as a U.S. charity) that is generally exempt from tax under U.S. law is nevertheless a resident of the United States for all purposes of the Convention. Paragraph 3 If, under the domestic law of both Contracting States, and, thus, under paragraph 1, an individual is a resident of both Contracting States, a series of tie-breaker rules are provided in paragraph 3 to determine a single State of residence for that individual. These tests are to be applied in the order in which they are stated. The first test is based on where the individual has a permanent home. If that test is inconclusive because the individual has a permanent home available to him in both States, he will be considered to be a resident of the Contracting State where his personal and economic relations are closest (i.e., the location of his ``center of vital interests.'' If that test is also inconclusive, or if he does not have a permanent home available to him in either State, he will be treated as a resident of the Contracting State where he maintains a habitual abode. If he has a habitual abode in both States or in neither of them, he will be treated as a resident of the Contracting State of which he is a national. If he is a national of both States or of neither, the competent authorities shall endeavor to settle the question by mutual agreement. Paragraph 4 Paragraph 4 addresses dual residence issues for companies. A company is treated as resident in the United States if it is created or organized under the laws of the United States or a political subdivision. If, as is frequently the case, a company is treated as a resident of Poland if it is either incorporated or managed and controlled there, dual residence can arise in the case of a U.S. company that is managed and controlled in Poland. In other cases, a company may be a dual resident because it was originally incorporated in one Contracting State but has ``continued'' into the other Contracting State. Paragraph 4 thus attempts to deal with each of these situations. Under paragraph 4, the residence of a dual resident company will be in the Contracting State under the laws of which it is created or organized if it is created or organized under the laws of only one of the other Contracting States. Thus, if a company is a resident of the United States because it is incorporated under the laws of one of the states and is a resident of Poland because its place of effective management is in Poland, then it will be a resident only of the United States. However, if the incorporation test does not resolve the question because, for example, the company was incorporated in one Contracting State and continued into the other Contracting State, but the first-mentioned Contracting State does not recognize the migration and continues to treat the company as a resident, the case would then be addressed by paragraph 5. Paragraph 5 Paragraph 5 addresses situations when by reason of the provisions of paragraph 1, 2 or 4, a person other than an individual is a resident of both Contracting States. In such cases, the competent authorities of the Contracting States may, but are not required to, use the mutual agreement procedure to endeavor to determine the mode of application to the dual resident person. If the competent authorities do not reach a mutual agreement regarding a single State of residence, such dual resident person cannot claim any benefit accorded to residents of a Contracting State by the Convention. The person may, however, claim any benefits that are not limited to residents, such as those provided by paragraph 1 of Article 24 (Non-Discrimination). Thus, for example, a State cannot impose discriminatory taxation on a dual resident person. Regardless of the outcome under this paragraph, dual resident companies may be treated as a resident of a Contracting State for purposes other than that of obtaining benefits under the Convention. For example, if a dual resident company pays a dividend to a resident of Poland, the U.S. paying agent would withhold on that dividend at the appropriate treaty rate (assuming the payee is entitled to treaty benefits), because reduced withholding is a benefit enjoyed by the resident of Poland, not by the dual resident company. The dual resident company that paid the dividend would, for this purpose, be treated as a resident of the United States under the Convention. In addition, information relating to dual resident companies can be exchanged under the Convention because, by its terms, Article 26 (Exchange of Information) is not limited to residents of the Contracting States. ARTICLE 5 (PERMANENT ESTABLISHMENT) This Article defines the term ``permanent establishment,'' a term that is significant for several articles of the Convention. The existence of a permanent establishment in a Contracting State is necessary under Article 7 (Business Profits) for the taxation by that State of the business profits of a resident of the other Contracting State. Articles 10 (Dividends), 11 (Interest) and 13 (Royalties) provide for reduced rates of tax at source on payments of these items of income to a resident of the other State only when the income is not attributable to a permanent establishment that the recipient has in the source State. The concept is also relevant in determining which Contracting State may tax certain gains under Article 14 (Capital Gains) and certain ``other income'' under Article 21 (Other Income). Paragraph 1 The basic definition of the term ``permanent establishment'' is contained in paragraph 1. As used in the Convention, the term means a fixed place of business through which the business of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried on. As indicated in the OECD Commentary to Article 5 (see paragraphs 4 through 8), a general principle to be observed in determining whether a permanent establishment exists is that the place of business must be ``fixed'' in the sense that a particular building or physical location is used by the enterprise for the conduct of its business, and that it must be foreseeable that the enterprise's use of this building or other physical location will be more than temporary. If an enterprise carries on a business through a sub-contractor, a permanent establishment may also exist for the enterprise if all the requirements of Article 5 are met. For example, under paragraph 1, a permanent establishment may exist where an enterprise carries on its business through sub-contractors at a fixed place of business of the enterprise. Factors that indicate that a location is a fixed place of business of the enterprise, (i.e., a general contractor) include legal possession of the site, controlling access to and use of the site, and overall responsibility for what happens at the location. Paragraph 2 Paragraph 2 lists a number of types of fixed places of business that constitute a permanent establishment. This list is illustrative and non-exclusive. According to paragraph 2, the term permanent establishment includes a place of management, a branch, an office, a factory, a workshop, and a mine, oil or gas well, quarry or other place of extraction of natural resources. Paragraph 3 This paragraph provides rules to determine whether a building site or a construction, assembly or installation project, or an installation or drilling rig or ship used for the exploration of natural resources constitutes a permanent establishment for the contractor, driller, etc. Such a site or activity does not create a permanent establishment unless the site, project, etc. lasts, or the exploration activity continues, for more than twelve months. It is only necessary to refer to ``exploration'' and not ``exploitation'' in this context because exploitation activities are defined to constitute a permanent establishment under subparagraph (f) of paragraph 2. Thus, a drilling rig does not constitute a permanent establishment if a well is drilled in twelve months or less. However, the well becomes a permanent establishment as of the date that production begins. The twelve-month test applies separately to each site or project. The twelve-month period begins when work (including preparatory work carried on by the enterprise) physically begins in a Contracting State. A series of contracts or projects by a contractor that are interdependent both commercially and geographically are to be treated as a single project for purposes of applying the twelve-month threshold test. For example, the construction of a housing development would be considered as a single project even if each house were constructed for a different purchaser. In applying this paragraph, time spent by a sub-contractor on a building site is counted as time spent by the general contractor at the site for purposes of determining whether the general contractor has a permanent establishment. However, for the sub-contractor itself to be treated as having a permanent establishment, the sub-contractor's activities at the site must last for more than twelve months. For purposes of applying the twelve-month rule, time is measured from the first day the sub- contractor is on the site until the last day. Thus, if a sub- contractor is on a site intermittently, intervening days that the sub-contractor is not on the site are counted. These interpretations of the Article are based on the Commentary to paragraph 3 of Article 5 of the OECD Model, which contains language that is substantially the same as that in the Convention. These interpretations are consistent with the generally accepted international interpretation of the relevant language in paragraph 3 of Article 5 of the Convention. If the twelve-month threshold is exceeded, the site or project constitutes a permanent establishment from the first day of activity. Paragraph 4 This paragraph contains exceptions to the general rule of paragraph 1, listing a number of activities that may be carried on through a fixed place of business but which nevertheless do not create a permanent establishment. The use of facilities solely to store, display or deliver merchandise belonging to an enterprise does not constitute a permanent establishment of that enterprise. The maintenance of a stock of goods belonging to an enterprise solely for the purpose of storage, display or delivery, or solely for the purpose of processing by another enterprise does not give rise to a permanent establishment of the first-mentioned enterprise. The maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of purchasing goods or merchandise, or for collecting information, for the enterprise, or for other activities that have a preparatory or auxiliary character for the enterprise, such as advertising, or the supply of information, do not constitute a permanent establishment of the enterprise. Moreover, subparagraph 4(f) provides that a combination of the activities described in the other subparagraphs of paragraph 4 will not give rise to a permanent establishment if the combination results in an overall activity that is of a preparatory or auxiliary character. Paragraph 5 Paragraphs 5 and 6 specify when activities carried on by an agent or other person acting on behalf of an enterprise create a permanent establishment of that enterprise. Under paragraph 5, a person is deemed to create a permanent establishment of the enterprise if that person has and habitually exercises an authority to conclude contracts on behalf of the enterprise. If, however, his activities are limited to those activities specified in paragraph 4 which would not constitute a permanent establishment if carried on by the enterprise through a fixed place of business, the person does not create a permanent establishment of the enterprise. The reference to the ability to habitually exercising an authority to conclude contracts ``on behalf of'' an enterprise should be interpreted consistently with the analogous terms found in the OECD Model ``in the name of that enterprise'' and the U.S. Model ``binding on the enterprise.'' As indicated in paragraph 32 to the OECD Commentaries on Article 5, paragraph 5 of the Article is intended to encompass persons who have ``sufficient authority to bind the enterprise's participation in the business activity in the State concerned.'' Paragraph 6 Under paragraph 6, an enterprise is not deemed to have a permanent establishment in a Contracting State merely because it carries on business in that State through an independent agent, including a broker or general commission agent, if the agent is acting in the ordinary course of his business. Thus, there are two conditions that must be satisfied: the agent must be both legally and economically independent of the enterprise; and the agent must be acting in the ordinary course of its business in carrying out activities on behalf of the enterprise. Whether the agent and the enterprise are independent is a factual determination. Among the questions to be considered is the extent to which the agent operates on the basis of instructions from the enterprise. An agent that is subject to detailed instructions regarding the conduct of its operations or to comprehensive control by the enterprise is not legally independent. In determining whether the agent is economically independent, a relevant factor is the extent to which the agent bears business risk. Business risk refers primarily to risk of loss. An independent agent typically bears risk of loss from its own activities. In the absence of other factors that would establish dependence, an agent that shares business risk with the enterprise, or has its own business risk, is economically independent because its business activities are not integrated with those of the principal. Conversely, an agent that bears little or no risk from the activities it performs is not economically independent and therefore is not described in paragraph 6. Another relevant factor in determining whether an agent is economically independent is whether the agent acts exclusively or nearly exclusively for the principal. Such a relationship may indicate that the principal has economic control over the agent. A number of principals acting in concert also may have economic control over an agent. The limited scope of the agent's activities and the agent's dependence on a single source of income may indicate that the agent lacks economic independence. It should be borne in mind, however, that exclusivity is not in itself a conclusive test; an agent may be economically independent notwithstanding an exclusive relationship with the principal if it has the capacity to diversify and acquire other clients without substantial modifications to its current business and without substantial harm to its business profits. Thus, exclusivity should be viewed merely as a pointer to further investigation of the relationship between the principal and the agent. Each case must be addressed on the basis of its own facts and circumstances. Paragraph 7 This paragraph clarifies that a company that is a resident of a Contracting State is not deemed to have a permanent establishment in the other Contracting State merely because it controls, or is controlled by, a company that is a resident of that other Contracting State, or that carries on business in that other Contracting State. The determination of whether a permanent establishment exists is made solely on the basis of the factors described in paragraphs 1 through 6 of the Article. Whether a company is a permanent establishment of a related company, therefore, is based solely on those factors and not on the ownership or control relationship between the companies. ARTICLE 6 (INCOME FROM REAL PROPERTY) Paragraph 1 The first paragraph of Article 6 states the general rule that income of a resident of a Contracting State derived from real property situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in the Contracting State in which the property is situated. The paragraph specifies that income from real property includes income from agriculture and forestry. This Article does not grant an exclusive taxing right to the situs State; the situs State is merely given the primary right to tax. The Article does not impose any limitation in terms of rate or form of tax on the situs State. Paragraph 2 The term ``real property'' is defined in paragraph 2 by reference to the domestic law definition in the situs State. In the case of the United States, the term has the meaning given to it by Treas. Reg. 1.897-1(b). In addition to the statutory definitions in the two Contracting States, the paragraph specifies certain additional classes of property that, regardless of domestic law definitions are within the scope of the term for purposes of the Convention. This expanded definition conforms to that in the OECD Model. With respect to the United States, the definition of ``real property'' for purposes of Article 6 is more limited than the reference to a ``United States real property interest'' in paragraph 2 of Article 14 (Capital Gains). The Article 14 term includes not only real property as defined in Article 6 but certain other interests in real property. Paragraph 3 Paragraph 3 makes clear that all forms of income derived from the exploitation of real property are taxable in the Contracting State in which the property is situated. This includes income from any use of real property, including, but not limited to, income from direct use by the owner (in which case income may be imputed to the owner for tax purposes) and rental income from the letting of real property. In the case of a net lease of real property, if a net election has not been made, the gross rental payment (before deductible expenses incurred by the lessee) is treated as income from the property. Other income closely associated with real property is covered by other Articles of the Convention, however, and not Article 6. For example, income from the disposition of an interest in real property is not considered ``derived'' from real property; taxation of that income is addressed in Article 14. Interest paid on a mortgage on real property would be covered by Article 11 (Interest). Distributions by a U.S. REITor certain regulated investment companies would fall under Article 14 in the case of distributions of U.S. real property gain or Article 10 (Dividends) in the case of distributions treated as dividends. Finally, distributions from a United States Real Property Holding Corporation as defined under Code section 897(c)(2) are not considered to be income from the exploitation of real property; such payments would fall under Article 10 or Article 14. Paragraph 4 This paragraph specifies that the basic rule of paragraph 1 (as elaborated in paragraph 3) applies to income from real property of an enterprise. This clarifies that the situs country may tax the real property income (including rental income) of a resident of the other Contracting State in the absence of attribution to a permanent establishment in the situs State. This provision represents an exception to the general rule under Articles 7 (Business Profits) that income must be attributable to a permanent establishment in order to be taxable in the situs state. ARTICLE 7 (BUSINESS PROFITS) This Article provides rules for the taxation by a Contracting State of the business profits of an enterprise of the other Contracting State. Paragraph 1 Paragraph 1 states the general rule that business profits of an enterprise of one Contracting State may not be taxed by the other Contracting State unless the enterprise carries on business in that other Contracting State through a permanent establishment (as defined in Article 5 (Permanent Establishment)) situated there. When that condition is met, the State in which the permanent establishment is situated may tax the enterprise on the income that is attributable to the permanent establishment. Although the Convention does not include a definition of ``business profits,'' the term is intended to cover income derived from any trade or business. In accordance with this broad definition, the term ``business profits'' includes income attributable to notional principal contracts and other financial instruments to the extent that the income is attributable to a trade or business of dealing in such instruments or is otherwise related to a trade or business (as in the case of a notional principal contract entered into for the purpose of hedging currency risk arising from an active trade or business). Any other income derived from such instruments is, unless specifically covered in another article, dealt with under Article 21 (Other Income). In addition, as a result of the definitions of ``enterprise'' and ``business'' in Article 3 (General Definitions), the term includes income derived from the furnishing of personal services. Thus, a consulting firm resident in one State whose employees or partners perform services in the other State through a permanent establishment may be taxed in that other State on a net basis under Article 7, and not under Article 15 (Income from Employment), which applies only to income of employees. With respect to the enterprise's employees themselves, however, their salary remains subject to Article 15. Because this Article applies to income earned by an enterprise from the furnishing of personal services, the Article also applies to income derived by a partner resident in a Contracting State that is attributable to personal services performed in the other Contracting State through a partnership with a permanent establishment in that other State. Income which may be taxed under this Article includes all income attributable to the permanent establishment in respect of the performance of the personal services carried on by the partnership (whether by the partner himself, other partners in the partnership, or by employees assisting the partners) and any income from activities ancillary to the performance of those services (e.g., charges for facsimile services). The application of Article 7 to a service partnership may be illustrated by the following example: a partnership formed in Poland has five partners (who agree to split profits equally), four of whom are resident and perform personal services only in Poland at Office A, and one of whom is a resident and performs personal services at Office B, a permanent establishment in the United States. In this case, the four partners of the partnership resident in Poland may be taxed in the United States in respect of their share of the income attributable to the permanent establishment, Office B. The services giving rise to income which may be attributed to the permanent establishment would include not only the services performed by the one resident partner, but also, for example, if one of the four other partners came to the United States and worked on an Office B matter there, the income in respect of those services. Income from the services performed by the visiting partner would be subject to tax in the United States regardless of whether the visiting partner actually visited or made use of Office B while performing services in the United States. Paragraph 2 Paragraph 2 provides rules for the attribution of business profits to a permanent establishment under which the attributed business profits are determined as if the permanent establishment were a separate enterprise that is independent from the rest of the enterprise of which it is a part, as well as from any other person. The Contracting States will attribute to a permanent establishment the profits that it would have earned had it been a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment. However, the business profits attributable to a permanent establishment are limited to those profits derived from the functions performed, assets used and risks assumed by the permanent establishment. Whereas paragraph 2 of Article 7 of the OECD Model provides that the paragraph applies ``[F]or the purposes of this Article and Article [23A][23B],'' paragraph 2 Article 7 applies only for purposes of attributing business profits, and does not have relevance for purposes of relief from double taxation, other than the narrow circumstances as provided in paragraph 3 of this Article (described below). The ``attributable to'' concept of paragraph 2 employs the arm's length principle reflected in the report of the OECD ``2010 Report on the Attribution of Profits to Permanent Establishments'' (the ``2010 Report'') for determining the amount of business profits that shall be taxable to a permanent establishment, in place of the analogous principles in Code section 864(c). In effect, paragraph 2 allows the United States to tax only the lesser of two amounts of income: the amount determined by applying U.S. rules regarding the calculation of effectively connected income and the amount determined under Article 7 of the Convention. That is, a taxpayer may choose the set of rules that results in the lowest amount of taxable income, but may not combine both treaty and Code rules in a way that would be inconsistent with the intent of either set of rules. Because the purpose of paragraph 2 is to determine the profits that are attributable to a permanent establishment, paragraph 2 applies in place only of Code section 864(c), which has an analogous function. The amount of income ``attributable to'' a permanent establishment under Article 7 may be greater or lesser than the amount of income that would be treated as ``effectively connected'' to a U.S. trade or business under section 864. Moreover, the profits attributable to a permanent establishment may be from sources within or without a Contracting State. However, as stated in paragraph 2, the business profits attributable to a permanent establishment include only those profits derived from the functions performed, assets used and risks assumed by the permanent establishment. For example, a foreign corporation that has a significant amount of third party foreign source royalty income attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment may find that it will pay less tax in the United States by applying section 864(c) of the Code, rather than Article 7, if the royalty income is not derived in the active conduct of a trade or business in the United States under Code section 864(c)(4)(B)(i). But, as described in the Technical Explanation to paragraph 2 of Article 1 (General Scope), if the foreign corporation chooses to apply Code Section 864(c) to determine its effectively connected income, it may not also use Article 7 principles to reduce its third party royalty income by interbranch royalty expense, since doing so would be inconsistent with either the principles of the Code or the Convention. (See Rev. Rul. 84-17, 1984-1 C.B. 308.). Conversely, if the taxpayer opts to use Article 7 to calculate the amount of business profits attributable to its U.S. permanent establishment, it must include all foreign-source income, from third parties and interbranch income in its business profits whether or not such income would be effectively connected income under the Code, if attributable to functions performed, assets used or risks assumed by the permanent establishment. Then, as stated above, the foreign corporation may elect to be taxed on the lower of the two amounts. Article 7 can only be used to reduce the amount of tax that would have otherwise been calculated using Code section 864(c) principles. Paragraph 2 refers specifically to the dealings between the permanent establishment and other parts of the enterprise of which the permanent establishment is a part in order to emphasize that the separate and independent enterprise fiction of the paragraph requires that these dealings be treated the same way as similar transactions taking place between independent enterprises. That specific reference to dealings between the permanent establishment and other parts of the enterprise does not, however, restrict the scope of the paragraph. Where a transaction that takes place between the enterprise and an associated enterprise affects directly the determination of the profits attributable to the permanent establishment (e.g. the acquisition by the permanent establishment from an associated enterprise of goods that will be sold through the permanent establishment), paragraph 2 also requires that, for the purpose of computing the profits attributable to the permanent establishment, the conditions of the transaction be adjusted, if necessary, to reflect the conditions of a similar transaction between independent enterprises. Assume, for instance, that the permanent establishment situated in State S of an enterprise of State R acquires property from an associated enterprise of State T. If the price provided for in the contract between the two associated enterprises exceeds what would have been agreed to between independent enterprises, paragraph 2 of Article 7 of the treaty between State R and State S will authorize State S to adjust the profits attributable to the permanent establishment to reflect what a separate and independent enterprise would have paid for the property. In such case, Sate R will also be able to adjust the profits of the enterprise of State R under paragraph 1 of Article 9 of the treaty between State R and State T, which will trigger the application of the corresponding adjustment mechanism of paragraph 2 of Article 9 of that treaty. Computation of the profits attributable to a permanent establishment under paragraph 2 takes into account the profits from all its activities, transactions with both associated and independent enterprises, and dealings with other parts of the enterprise. This analysis involves two steps. The first step requires a functional factual analysis to determine: the attribution to the permanent establishment of the rights and obligations arising out of transactions between the enterprise of which the permanent establishment is a part and separate enterprises; the identification of significant people functions relevant to the attribution of economic ownership of assets, and the attribution of economic ownership of assets to the permanent establishment; the identification of significant people functions relevant to the assumption of risks, and the attribution of risks to the permanent establishment; the identification of other functions of the permanent establishment; the recognition of dealings between the permanent establishment and other parts of the enterprise; and the attribution of capital based on the assets and risks attributed to the permanent establishment. The second step is to price any such dealings that are attributed to the permanent establishment in accordance with the 2010 Report. Thus, any of the methods permitted in the 2010 Report, including profits methods, may be used as appropriate and in accordance with the principles of the OECD's Transfer Pricing Guidelines. However, the attribution methods apply only for purposes of attributing profits within the legal entity. It does not create legal obligations or other tax consequences that would result from transactions having independent legal significance. In order to facilitate the administration of the two step process, taxpayers are encouraged to provide documentation supporting the conclusions reached in the first step, and demonstrating the appropriateness of the dealings and the associated prices. An entity that operates through branches rather than separate subsidiaries will typically have lower capital requirements because the capital of the entity is available to support all of the entity's liabilities (with some exceptions attributable to local regulatory restrictions). This is the reason most commercial banks and some insurance companies operate through branches rather than through subsidiaries. The benefit that comes from such lower capital costs must be allocated among the branches in an appropriate manner. This issue does not arise in the case of an enterprise that operates through separate entities, since each entity will have to be separately capitalized or will have to compensate another entity for providing capital (usually through a guarantee). Under U.S. domestic regulations, internal ``transactions'' generally are not recognized because they do not have legal significance. In contrast, paragraph 2 provides that such internal dealings may be used to allocate income in cases where the dealings accurately reflect the allocation of risk within the enterprise. One example is global trading in securities. In many cases, banks use internal swap transactions to transfer risk from one branch to a central location where traders have the expertise to manage that particular type of risk. Under the Convention, such a bank may also use such swap transactions as a means of allocating income between the branches, if use of that method is the ``best method'' within the meaning of regulation section 1.482-1(c). The books of a branch will not be respected, however, when the results are inconsistent with a functional analysis. So, for example, income from a transaction that is booked in a particular branch (or home office) will not be treated as attributable to that location if the sales and risk management functions that generate the income are performed in another location. In the case of financial institutions, the use of internal dealings to allocate income within an enterprise may produce results under Article 7 that are significantly different than the results under the effectively connected income rules of Code section 864(c). For example, income from interbranch notional principal contracts may be taken into account under Article 7, notwithstanding that such transactions may be ignored for purposes of U.S. domestic law. Under the consistency rule described above, a financial institution that conducts different lines of business through its U.S. permanent establishment may not choose to apply the rules of the Code with respect to some lines of business and Article 7 of the Convention with respect to others. If it chooses to use the rules of Article 7 to allocate its income from its trading book, it may not then use U.S. domestic rules to allocate income from its loan portfolio. Paragraph 2 provides that deductions shall be allowed for expenses incurred for purposes of a permanent establishment, ensuring that business profits will be taxed on a net basis. These deductions may include compensation to other parts of the enterprise for functions performed for the branch's benefit, if they are functions that would be compensated at arm's length. Thus, deductions against business profits may be allowed when an accounting unit of the enterprise books third-party expenses for purposes of the permanent establishment. However, the amount deducted to determine net business profits is not the actual amount of third-party expense booked, but rather the amount of compensation that would be paid at arm's length by the branch for the function performed. For example, when the home office of an enterprise books interest expense that is used in part to fund the permanent establishment, the permanent establishment may deduct an arm's length amount of interest paid to the home office to compensate it for an appropriate amount of debt-funding. The permanent establishment may also take into account arm's length fees to an enterprise's treasury center for functions performed for its benefit. In each case, the amount of expense allowed as a deduction is determined by applying the arm's length principle. Similarly, where the branch and other parts of the enterprise share benefits of centralized functions, such as research and development or headquarters services, the deduction allowed to the permanent establishment would be its appropriate share of the arm's length compensation for such shared functions. The method to be used in calculating that compensation, and the permanent establishment's appropriate share thereof, will depend on the facts and circumstances, including the terms of the arrangements between the branches and head office. The amount of deduction could be computed as a share of either the total costs, or other value indicator, of the centralized function, depending on which provides the most reliable measure of the arm's length charge for sharing in the centralized functions in the facts and circumstances. The permanent establishment's appropriate share of such compensation for these functions will depend on the benefits it reasonably expects to receive from the arrangement as a proportion of the total reasonably expected benefits of all parts of the enterprise. A permanent establishment cannot be funded entirely with debt, and must have sufficient capital to carry on its activities as if it were a distinct and separate enterprise. To the extent that the permanent establishment has not booked adequate capital, a Contracting State may attribute such capital to the permanent establishment and deny an interest deduction to the extent necessary to reflect that capital attribution. The method prescribed by U.S. domestic law for making this attribution is found in Treas. Reg. 1.882-5. Both Treas. Reg. 1.882-5 and the method prescribed in this paragraph start from the premise that all of the capital of the enterprise supports all of the assets and risks of the enterprise, and therefore the entire capital of the enterprise must be allocated to its various businesses and offices. However, Treas. Reg. 1.882-5 does not take into account the fact that there is more risk associated with some assets than others. For instance, an independent enterprise would need less capital to support a floating rate U.S. Treasury security than it would need to support an equity security or other asset with significant market and/or credit risk. Accordingly, in some cases Treas. Reg. 1.882-5 would require a taxpayer to allocate more capital to the United States, and therefore would reduce the taxpayer's interest deduction more, than is appropriate. To address these cases, the Convention allows a taxpayer to apply a more flexible approach that takes into account the relative risk of its assets in the various jurisdictions in which it does business. In particular, in the case of financial institutions other than insurance companies, the amount of capital attributable to a permanent establishment is determined by allocating the institution's total capital between its offices on the basis of the proportion of the financial institution's risk-weighted assets attributable to each office. This recognizes the fact that financial institutions are in many cases required to risk-weight their assets for regulatory purposes and, in other cases, will do so for business reasons even if not required to do so by regulators. However, risk- weighting is more complicated than the method prescribed by Treas. Reg. 1.882-5. Accordingly, to ease this administrative burden, taxpayers may choose to apply the principles of Treas. Reg. 1.882-5(c) to determine the amount of capital allocable to its U.S. permanent establishment, in lieu of determining its allocable capital under the risk-weighted capital allocation method provided by the Convention, even if it has otherwise chosen to apply the principles of Article 7 rather than the effectively connected income rules of U.S. domestic law. Paragraph 3 Paragraph 3 provides that where, in accordance with paragraph 2, a Contracting State adjusts the profits that are attributable to a permanent establishment of an enterprise of one of the Contracting States and taxes accordingly profits of the enterprise that have been charged to tax in the other State, the other Contracting State shall, to the extent necessary to eliminate double taxation, make an appropriate adjustment if it agrees with the adjustment made by the first- mentioned State. If the other Contracting state does not so agree, the Contracting States shall eliminate any double taxation resulting therefrom by mutual agreement. Paragraph 4 Paragraph 4 coordinates the provisions of Article 7 and other provisions of the Convention. Under this paragraph, when business profits include items of income that are dealt with separately under other articles of the Convention, the provisions of those articles will, except when they specifically provide to the contrary, take precedence over the provisions of Article 7. For example, the taxation of dividends will be determined by the rules of Article 10 (Dividends), and not by Article 7, except where, as provided in paragraph 6 of Article 10, the dividend is attributable to a permanent establishment. In the latter case the provisions of Article 7 apply. Thus, an enterprise of one State deriving dividends from the other State may not rely on Article 7 to exempt those dividends from tax at source if they are not attributable to a permanent establishment of the enterprise in the other State. By the same token, if the dividends are attributable to a permanent establishment in the other State, the dividends may be taxed on a net income basis at the source State full corporate tax rate, rather than on a gross basis under Article 10. As provided in Article 8 (Shipping and Air Transport), income derived from shipping and air transport activities in international traffic described in that Article is taxable only in the country of residence of the enterprise regardless of whether it is attributable to a permanent establishment situated in the source State. Paragraph 5 Paragraph 5 incorporates into the Convention the principles of Code section 864(c)(6), but not section 864(c)(7). Like the Code section on which it is based, paragraph 5 provides that any income or gain attributable to a permanent establishment during its existence, following the rules of paragraph 2 and 3, is taxable in the Contracting State where the permanent establishment is situated, even if the payment of that income or gain is deferred until after the permanent establishment ceases to exist. This rule applies with respect to paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 7(Business Profits), paragraph 6 of Article 10 (Dividends), paragraph 6 of Article 11 (Interest), paragraph 4 of Articles 13 (Royalties) and 14 (Gains) and paragraph 2 of Article 21 (Other Income). The effect of this rule can be illustrated by the following example. Assume a company that is a resident of the other Contracting State and that maintains a permanent establishment in the United States winds up the permanent establishment's business and sells the permanent establishment's inventory to a U.S. buyer prior to winding up in exchange for an interest- bearing installment obligation payable"
