        "text": "Starting from 15 April 2013 WARSET, the old WSE's trading system based on the French NSC platform stops working. WARSET has been replaced by a new trading system called the Universal Trading Platform (UTP) bought from NYSE Technologies as a part of a multi-year commercial agreement of 12 July 2010 on strategic and long-term cooperation between NYSE Euronext (NYX) and the Warsaw Stock Exchange (WSE) UTP has been launched for both cash and derivative markets in order to increase efficiency of trading on WSE.\n\nIn continuous trading, buyers and sellers place orders which, after being transferred to the exchange, are either executed immediately (on the condition that their prices match), or are entered into the order book, where they await orders of the appropriate price on the other side. There are two priorities in order execution: Price and order placement time. This means that whenever two orders of identical price are awaiting execution, the first one to be transacted is the one submitted earlier. On a given day, between the moment when acceptance of broker orders begins and the start of continuous trading, between the moment when acceptance of orders for closing begins and the moment at which the closing price is determined, and during the market balancing period, the indicative price is calculated on an ongoing basis.\n\nThe most liquid stocks are traded in the continuous system, as well as all bonds, investment certificates, futures contracts and warrants. Subscription rights and allotment certificates are traded in the continuous system only if their underlying stocks are traded in this system.\n\nTrading in the single-price auction system is based on an auction procedure, i.e. determination of a security's price based on orders submitted before the start of trading. The first phase of the session is the so-called pre-opening phase, during which the system accepts buy and sell orders, but no transactions are executed. However, the indicative opening price (IOP) is calculated and published. Next, using the appropriate algorithm, the computer system calculates the single price at which transactions are to be executed. The single price is determined on the basis of broker orders containing a limit price and orders with no such limit. Once the single price is published, it becomes the price at which transactions are concluded.\n\nOrders are prioritised for execution by price and time of acceptance or activation, observing the principle of minimising the number of transactions. First, all must-be-filled orders, then those with a limit price better than the single price are executed in full. Next, market-on-opening orders are realised, and then those with a limit price equal to the determined single price. If it is not possible to determine a single price within the permissible price variation limits, a non-transactional price is always given. In such situation, transactions are not executed, and this price becomes the reference price for the next session.\n\nApart from continuous and single-price auctions trading also block trades may be executed on the market. Block trades are those concluded outside of the continuous and single-price auction systems. The subject of this type of transaction can be large blocks of any security (except futures contracts). Most often, these transactions are between major players who have previously agreed upon the details of the transaction – i.e. the price, amount, and settlement date. The Exchange Rules specify the conditions for block trades, setting the minimum size of a block and maximum difference between the price in the block trade and the price of the security during the trading session on a given day.\n\nA company can be traded only in one of the above mentioned systems. The Exchange Management Board may decide to introduce shares to a particular quotation system regarding to the number and value of the shares and their projected liquidity (liquidity assessment is carried out quarterly).\n\nShares are classified in the following regulated market segments:\n\n250 PLUS (dedicated to the shares of issuers whose capitalisation in PLN exceeding the equivalent of EUR250,000,000)\n\n50 PLUS (dedicated to the shares of issuers whose capitalisation in PLN is greater than equivalent of EUR50,000,000 but do not exceed EUR250,000,000)\n\n5 PLUS (dedicated to the shares of issuers whose capitalisation in PLN is greater than equivalent of EUR5,000,000 but do not exceed EUR50,000,000\n\n5 MINUS (dedicated to the shares of issuers whose capitalisation in PLN is not greater than equivalent of EUR5,000,000)\n\nALERT LIST (includes the shares of issuers who has declared bankruptcy or the share price is subject to a very strong volatility)\n\nShares that are classified to Alert List may then be moved to a single price quotation trading system.\n\nBesides shares are listed within ALERT LIST segment also if their average price was lower than PLN0.50 in the quarter directly preceding the date of classification of the company's shares in the ALERT LIST. In addition the WSE Management Board may decide to include the shares in to ALERT LIST when it is required in the interest of trading participants.\n\nA minimum trading lot is one unit (in case of shares – one share). A particular trade order placed with a local broker or foreign broker recognized as a remote broker (having the status of WSE Remote Member) may be executed on the market (the Exchange) in many individual lots and at different prices dependently on a price limit for that trade order. Such a trade order may also settle respectively at NDS upon trade confirmations and with the clients upon settlement instructions within so called post-transaction settlements.\n\nBrokerage houses operating in UTP system can act as market makers upon a market making agreement with WSE who's the main task is to maintain liquidity of a particular security. There are two groups of them: a) market makers, b) issuer's makers. The Exchange Management Board may oblige an Issuer of securities to make a market making agreement with WSE if it believes the liquidity of securities requires so.\n\nWARSET system enables an immediate dissemination of market information to each market participant (during the pre-opening phase - incoming orders and indicative price, the book orders and any changes on an on-going basis; while session – current quotations). The investors are able to monitor sessions in a real time.\n\nPolish Financial Supervision Authority(PFSA): commenced its activity on September 19, 2006, when the Act on Supervision of the Financial Market of July 26, 2006 (Dz. U. of 2006, No. 157, item 1119, as amended) came into force taking over the duties of both Insurance and Pension Funds Supervisory Commission and the Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC).\n\nBanking supervision in PFSA: due to the decision of the merger of financial and banking supervision based on evolution of the Polish financial market, since January 1, 2008 banking supervision has been carried out by the Polish Financial Supervision Authority, as stipulated in the Act of July 21, 2006 on Supervision of the Financial Market. As of that time employees of the General Inspectorate of Banking Supervision (which was part of Poland's central bank, NBP) became employees of the PFSA. All strengths of former banking supervision are maintained. Requirements for banking supervision inspectors remain unchanged.\n\nThe Polish FSA is supervised by the President of the Council of Ministry and is to ensure among others regular operation of the financial market, its stability, security and transparency, confidence in the financial market and to protect market interest of investors and all market participants. The main tasks of PFSA cover capital market supervision, insurance supervision, pension scheme supervision and complementary supervision of financial conglomerates whereof the supervised entities constitute the part.\n\nWarsaw Stock Exchange: a joint-stock company in the meaning of the Act on Trading in Financial Instruments (art.21 of the said Act) that debuted on the Main List of the Warsaw Stock Exchange on 9 November 2010 (free float of 64.79% bearer shares, representing 47.92% of the total vote in total at the General Meeting of Shareholders). The remaining shares (all the remaining shares are preferred ones) belong to two groups of shareholders, State Treasury with its 35% share in capital representing 51.76% share in voting at the General Meeting of Shareholders and other shareholders (investment firms, banks and other shareholders) with their 0.22% share in capital in total representing 0.32% share in voting. WSE conducts and organises public securities trading. WSE also creates non-Exchange regulated trading within an alternative trading system (NewConnect for shares and Catalyst for debt securities other than Treasury Debt securities).\n\nThe majority shareholder, the State Treasury is the only shareholder holding an equity stake greater than 5% of the total vote in the Company within the meaning of Article 22.5 of the Act on Trading in Financial Instruments dated 29 July 2005 (as amended).\n\nStock Exchange Supervisory Board: the board controls operations of the stock exchange, admits securities for trading as well as grants and recalls stock exchange memberships.\n\nNational Depository for Securities (Polish short name KDPW): a non-profit and joint stock company that oversees settlement and clearing transactions on fully dematerialised securities admitted to public trading. KDPW is a Polish central securities depository responsible for management and supervision of the depository settlement system in relation to trading in financial instruments in Poland. It is owned by WSE, NBP and the State Treasury each holding equal stakes.\n\nIn 2013 KDPW has launched trade repository service. On November 7, 2013 the European Securities Market Authority (ESMA) registered KDPW Trade Repository (KDPW_TR) as one of the fourth trade repositories in Europe and the first and only Trade Repository in Central-Eastern Europe. As a result KDPW_TR is able to register all classes derivative contracts both, on a regulated and OTC market.\n\nAs of July 1, 2011, there has been a new clearing house, named KDPW_CCP in the Polish market. KDPW_CCP a wholly owned by KDPW, as a modern clearing house, was created in order to secure settlements of transactions with its own capital as a guarantor of transaction settlements within the system of Settlement Guarantee Fund. In line with international standards KDPW_CCP is a separate legal entity launched for the purposes of providing clearing house services in Poland. On April 8, 2014 Polish FSA authorized KDPW_CCP as full Clearing House, confirming that KDPW_CCP fulfils all requirements for clearing houses under the EU regulations EMIR as the third Clearing House in Europe. On December 12, 2013, KDPW_CCP received from KDPW_TR a LEI (legal entity identifier under ISO17442) necessary to comply with the obligation of reporting to trade repositories effective as of February 12, 2014.\n\nThe KDPW_CCP LEI is: 2594000K576D5CQXI987.\n\nThe Polish Clearing House is responsible for clearing of transactions concluded on organized market (regulated market and alternative trading system, ATS), using a range of mechanisms which reduce the risk of counterparty default on a systemic basis. The main objective of KDPW_CCP is to guarantee settlement of transactions executed on the regulated cash market (trading platforms of Warsaw Stock Exchange S.A. and BondSpot S.A.), and within alternative trading system, ATS (trading platforms of NewConnect, Catalyst , BondSpot S.A.). KDPW_CCP is equipped with share capital amounted to PLN 190 million (roughly EUR 45 million), which can be used in the clearing guarantee system, thus reinforcing the safety of clearing. Under the requirements of EMIR, KDPW_CCP's special reserve resources are PLN 13.1 million.\n\nNational Bank of Poland (NBP): is the central bank of Poland and its fundamental objective is to maintain price stability by stabilising the inflation rate at the level of 2.5% with a permissible fluctuation band of +/- 1 percentage point as well as guarding the stability of the financial system.\n\nNBP is responsible for stability of the national currency (Polish zloty, PLN), developing and implementing the Polish monetary policy strategy and the annual monetary policy guidelines. It manages the official reserves to ensure the requisite level of the State's financial security.\n\nAs an issuer of the Polish currency, NBP maintains the liquidity of cash payments. Due to its supervisory and regulatory functions, NBP oversees the liquidity, efficiency and security of the payment system contributing also to the development of a secure infrastructure of the financial market. Moreover, NBP undertakes activities aimed at disseminating knowledge about economics, e.g. through publishing information on its website and operating the NBP Economics Education Portal.\n\nEquities:\n\nEquity trading for publicly traded securities is commenced in majority on the Warsaw Stock Exchange (WSE) including its alternative trading system, NewConnect market. Additionally some equities are traded on regulated off-market, Treasury BondSpot Poland (less listing requirements attracting smaller companies). Equities can be also traded OTC, but such trades may be subject to 1% stamp duty tax, unless concluded with an intermediation of an investment firm/foreign investment firm, or directly with an investmentfirm/foreign investment firm.\n\nAccording to existing regulations foreign institutions can provide brokerage services in Poland by establishing a branch or repo office or participate in WSE remotely as WSE members. At the moment, there are 27 foreign brokers that conclude WSE trades remotelyand 2 others act through their branches in Poland directly or indirectly.\n\nEach WSE transaction (a so called market transaction) can be concluded only by a WSE member (domestic or foreign). A trade order placed by an investor with a WSE member(local broker or foreign remote WSE member) is executed directly on WSE. The orders can also be placed with foreign brokers (being not a remote broker) and then they can be executed on WSE through the intermediary of a WSE member. Once the Exchange executes the trade, confirmation of the execution of the transaction is sent simultaneously to the clearing house (KDPW_CCP) and to the WSE members. In case of foreign exchange members, KDPW _CCP provides the transaction executions in the form of contract notes to relevant clearing agents in order to clear the transactions and settle themon the brokers' accounts on SD at KDPW (the Polish CSD). The on-exchange transactions are cleared and settled automatically without any settlement instructions from the WSE members delivered to their clearing agents.\n\nThe transactions with clients/investors (post-trade transactions) are effective based on settlement instructions delivered to local agents by the WSE members on one side, and by investors on the other side. Such settlements are recognised by the market as post-trade settlements. Settlement instructions are required to be delivered to NDS by 10:30 CET on SD (free of charge market deadline). The instructions delivered to NDS after that deadline, but before the market deadline for settlement on SD, i.e. 15:30 CET are charged with a penalty fee imposed by NDS on the deliverer (here, local Agent).\n\nOn settlement date (T+2) upon successful matching at the KDPW level (verification of securities and cash positions on the KDPW participants' accounts), the transaction is settled on one of the several KDPW settlement sessions. The vast majority of settlements are performed in the main settlement session at 10:30. After the trade settled, KDPW provides the participants with the confirmation of transaction settlement. Upon the confirmation from KDPW, the transaction is settled on Client's account with subcustodian/broker and then the settlement confirmation is delivered to the client.\n\nAll trades executed on WSE (concluded by the WSE members) are covered by the Settlement Guarantee Fund, and are subject to clearing by KDPW_CCP (clearing house). These transactions are also settled by KDPW, in the dedicated depository account of a WSE member's Settlement Agent, who is a direct participant of KDPW (the functionality of Settlement Agent together with an institution of clearing house for the convenience of foreign WSE members operating directly as clearing members of KDPW_CCP, is performed usually by local Agents). The suspension of settlement of these transactions will result in running an automatic securities lending, offered by KDPW, subject to the securities being available for the loan. The automatic securities lending service is subject to charge in accordance with the KDPW Fee Schedule. Post-trade transaction settlements are covered by other rules and are not subject to the Settlement Guarantee System. Such settlement may be suspended due to a shortage of securities or insufficient cash to cover cash liability in connection with the settlement on client's account.\n\nA settlement of transaction failure can be done also due to lack of client's settlement instruction that has to be provided to the client's local agent on SD the latest. Only upon such instruction the Agent issues the instruction to KDPW in order to match and settle the trade finally. There is no possibility to cancel a trade that has been correctly executed by a WSE member. Automatic partial settlements have been allowed since August 1, 2014. Automatic partial settlement functionality is used to optimise the settlement process by enhancement the liquidity of settlements in KDPW (optimisation of settlement of trades) and improving the liquidity of clearing in KDPW_CCP.\n\nLocal licensed custodians, who maintain clients' securities accounts, are obliged to settle trades on behalf of their customers only upon clients' instructions matched with counterparties' instructions at the level of KDPW. Thus, there is an irrevocable settlement commitment (the payment commitment as well as the obligation to deliver customer's securities). Resulting from that there is no market practice to verify securities and cash positions by local brokers prior to accepting any client's trade order. The brokers while concluding stock exchange transactions upon clients' orders are not obliged to block security holdings on clients' custody accounts (art.121 of the Act on Trading in Financial Instruments of July 29, 2005).\n\nSettlement based on art. 121 of the Act on Trading in Financial Instruments of July 29, 2005:\n\nArt. 121 of the Act on Trading in Financial Instruments of July 29, 2005 provides the legal framework for settlement process of transactions upon clients' instructions as well as direct settlement of transactions through a foreign broker's clearing account. Art.121 gives ground to the local custodians to issue settlement instructions to KDPW system only upon the customer's instruction. The rule of mandatory settlement of transactions is still preserved for the settlement of on-exchange transactions (market side of transaction). It also allows registering the trades done by the intermediaries (i.e. international brokers) on their own accounts (proprietary accounts) also in order to sell the securities deposited thus further to the brokers' clients (client side of transaction, also called as post-trade transaction/OTC transaction).\n\nArt. 121 does not abolish the irrevocable settlement of securities transactions executed on WSE. WSE transactions are subject to Settlement Guarantee Fund system that secures settlements of transactions concluded on the stock exchange (on-exchange trades). Art. 121 allows a foreign broker to buy securities traded on the Warsaw Stock Exchange, settle them through its own clearance account in order to deliver them further to an ultimate investor. The settlement of such a transaction may be done through a foreign broker's securities account without a need to open segregated clients' securities accounts. In the meaning of the Polish Regulations an securities account's structure reflects also an ownership structure (since 1 January 2012 the above statement refers only to a segregated account structure) – an account holder is considered as an investor identified by a name of account. Starting from 1 January 2012 omnibus account structure has been allowed by the Polish law so underlying investors are not recognised by the market until they are revealed for the tax purposes if want to benefit from DTT tax rates at source or tax exemptions at source based on Polish Act on CIT.\n\nIn this meaning, art. 121 changes the scope of responsibility of international brokers. It means that upon the agreements on guaranteeing the payments and delivery of securities concluded between international brokers and local brokers, the international brokers are responsible for settlement of transactions with local brokers in the same way like local custodians were responsible before art.121 has been introduced. Shares are no longer blocked on the final beneficiary's account and cannot be moved from the final beneficiary's account without the instruction. To avoid settlement failure caused by shortage of securities that might lead to huge penalties imposed by KDPW, the broker is authorised to use its proprietary assets, borrow securities on the market or execute a buy-in transaction with settlement on T+0 in order to settle the trade.\n\nIn accordance with the amendments to Detailed Rules approved by the Resolution of the KDPW Management Board, dated September 20, 2004, international brokers acting under art.121 are allowed to settle their on-exchange transactions with custodian's clients on a \"free of payment\" basis. Currently the same rule is used for settling of transactions also between two brokers' accounts.\n\nKDPW settles transactions executed on the regulated market on a DvP basis, however not via a true DvP model as settlement of cash is processed separately via the Banks' accounts at the Polish central bank, National Bank of Poland (NBP). Securities settlement between KDPW participants is executed on gross basis in accordance with contract notes (per execution basis) for market settlement (interbroker) while in case of post-trade transaction settlement it is based on matched instructions provided by KDPW participants. Cash settlement between KDPW participants is done on a net basis at the level of NBP. One of the new services to be offered by KDPW_CCP (Polish CCP) is securities netting mechanism on the cash market. The service has been formally available in the Polish market since August 4, 2014. The implementation of the netting mechanism has been co-ordinated with KDPW's simultaneous project \"Introduction of automatic partial settlement.\". In practice, netting and partial settlement are only applied to instructions for guaranteed transactions concluded as of 4 August 2014 (inclusive).\n\nThe DvP procedure is assured by KDPW which controls the availability of cash in the participants' accounts at the Polish central bank (NBP) before securities movements are processed (matching criterion at the KDPW level). Should there be an insufficient amount of money in the participant's account at NBP, KDPW chooses transactions to be suspended and adjusts payment instructions to NBP.\n\nFixed Income:\n\nT-Bonds - Primary auctions for Treasury bonds are organised by NBP (BondSpot). According to the provisions of Rules and Regulations Governing the Activities of the Treasury Securities Dealers as of September 21, 2007 only Treasury Securities Dealer (TSD) chosen in way of Competition arranged by the Minister of Finance for entities that apply for a TSD function has a right to attend and organise primary auctions on T-bonds. The Rules do not limit applicants for a TSD to only local banks. The terms of participants are detailed in art.13, par.2 of the Rules. One of the principle criteria for Applicants is:\n\nto have T-bills account with NBP, or securities/deposits account with KDPW (clearing agents set up an adequate account at KDPW for foreign entities), to point settling participant and consent to provide by him data on activity of the Applicant on financial markets in extend needed for the Applicant evaluation in the Competition.\n\nForeign Entities can also apply for a TSD function however an applicant must submit the statement on fulfilling the function of government securities dealers in one of the OECD countries excluding Poland. Minister of Finance signs agreements on fulfilling the function of TSD for one year with those applicants who have been chosen in way of the Competition.\n\nTreasury BondSpot Poland participants can act on the market either in the capacity of Market Makers (currently 20 entities including 6 foreign ones) or Market Takers (currently 6 entities including 5 foreign ones).\n\nSecondary trading in T-bonds takes place on WSE and off the regulated market, also known as \"interbank market\". The settlement of T-bonds transactions on the secondary market is supervised and conducted by KDPW.\n\nThe most liquid T-bonds market is off-exchange market called interbank market where the trading is done with Polish banks. This trading is possible due to general exemption of treasury securities from obligatory trading on regulated markets. These transactions are identified by the market as OTC transactions. OTC transactions on T-bonds are exempt from Stamp Duty obligation on contrary to OTC transactions on equities due to the fact that debt securities does not generate ownership as it is in case of equities. Free of payment transactions on T-bonds are freely allowed between counterparties even if they are different entities.\n\nFor WSE transactions on T-bonds the same procedure as for equities is applied except for settlement cycle, which is T+2. In case of interbank market transactions settlement takes place on individually negotiable basis upon the agreement between parties, usually on T+1.\n\nOff the regulated market practice is that repo transactions, buy-sell-back or sell-buy-back settlements take place on negotiable basis as well as on T+0. The settlement of transaction is done upon a client's instruction, prior pre-matched with counterparty's instruction by agents (client's and counterparty's local custodians).\n\nOnce they are initially pre-matched by the agents they are delivered to KDPW in order to be matched and settled finally. If any discrepancies appear in participants' instructions, local custodians go to their clients with the reason of not pre-matching. Pre-matching is continuing after all discrepancies are clarified.\n\nT-bonds transactions concluded on interbank market may be settled both versus payment (upon standard RVP/DVP instructions) and free-of-payment (upon RF/DF instructions).The transactions settle at KDPW upon matched settlement instructions delivered by local agents.\n\nIn case of RF/DF settlement, cash clearing may take place elsewhere, as agreed between the counterparties, e.g. in USD outside Poland or via different local clearing channels.\n\nT-Bills - Primary auctions for Treasury bills are organised by NBP every Monday and available only to Treasury Securities Dealers (also used Primary Dealers).\n\nSecondary trading in T-bills takes place on the interbank market and are listed on Treasury BondSpot Poland. All investors may become counterparties for such transactions. T-Bills settlement is negotiable between parties but usually settles on T+1 basis. Settlement is done on RTGS basis in both cash and securities via system SKARBNET4 (former Securities Registrar)within the National Bank of Poland.\n\nAfter the instructions are pre-matched by local custodians, the banks deliver settlement instructions through RTGS system or DSP to the SKARBNET4 system at NBP between 08:00 and 17:00. T- bills settlement instructions are settled against payment, however free of payment settlements are also allowed. The market practice is to settle T-bills on a negotiable basis, however usually on T+1 basis.\n\nFor secondary market trades, same day settlement is possible under the following conditions:\n\nsettlement must be initiated by the local custodian before an irrevocableSKARBNET4deadline, SD at midday, thus both counterparties of the transaction are required to comply with the deadlines and necessary pre-matching procedures agreed with local custodians.\n\nSince January 1, 2006, foreign banks that have the status of Treasury Securities Dealers (Primary Dealers), are able to participate in the T-bonds and T-Bills primary market auctions (please also refer to the section Settlement Procedures: T-bonds). Such participation will be required either to:\n\nbecome a SKARBNET4 participant – in this case the foreign bank that is the Treasury Securities Dealer (here TSD) must sign a SKARBNET4 participation agreement and find a bank, that has its own cash account with NBP to support cash settlements, or\n\nuse its local custodian to settle primary market auctions. A foreign bank with the status of TSD, would be required to sign a separate agreement with NBP on servicing of the primary market auctions. According to that agreement, TSD is required to provide its bids to the primary market auctions via SWIFT upon MT598.\n\nDerivatives\n\nGoverned by the same trading and settlement principles as equities admitted to public trading. The primary difference is that the Depository (KDPW) shall maintain individual deposit accounts for those investors who trade in derivative instruments in the derivatives markets. In Poland mark to market for derivatives is used and investors have to maintain margin accounts with their local brokerage houses or local agents in order to cover their positions on a daily basis\n\nShare holdings may be required to be disclosed by the beneficial owner, particularly when holdings reach or exceed prescribed disclosure limits. Investors must ensure that they comply in full by reporting such holdings to the appropriate organisations for this market, within the timeframe required. If you have any questions regarding this issue we encourage you to consult your legal counsel.\n\nFailure to comply with reporting requirements may lead to pecuniary penalty of up to PLN1,000,000.00 and/or other sanctions.\n\nNotification must be made to the Polish Financial Supervision Authority and the issuer within four working days from the date the investors became, or could become aware taking due care about crossing the threshold for off-market trades, and within six trading days from the trade date in case of transactions executed on the regulated market.\n\nDue to the changes in the Act on Public Offering, Conditions Governing the Introduction of Financial Instrument to the Organised Trading, and Public Companies (the Act on Public Offering) that became effective from August 5, 2009 the following situations need to be reported:\n\nif account holders acquiring shares of a public company achieve or exceed 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 33%, 33⅓%, 50%, 75% or 90% of the total vote at its general meetings.\n\nif account holders, prior to a sale, owned shares of a public company entitling them to at least 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 33%, 33⅓%, 50%, 75% or 90% of the total vote, and after the sale achieved accordingly 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 33%, 33⅓%, 50%, 75%, 90% or less of the total number of votes.\n\nif account holders entitled to more than 10% of the total vote changed their threshold in connection with acquisition or sale of shares resulting in changes of the total vote by at least 2% when shares of a public company are traded on official stock exchange listing market or at least 5% when shares of a public company are traded on other regulated markets, and the holders entitled to more than 33% of the total vote when acquiring or selling shares resulting in changes of the total vote by at least 1%.\n\nInvestors having, directly or indirectly, at least 5% of voting rights in real property companies are obliged to inform the relevant Polish Tax Authority about the number of shares and other rights. Deadline for the report is to be established individually based on the real property company’ financial year.\n\nThe reporting obligation applies also to investors who achieved or exceeded the threshold prescribed by the law to report in relation with:\n\ncoming into being legal event other than act in law\n\nacquiring or selling financial instruments giving unconditional right or obligation of acquisition of shares already issued by the public company\n\nindirect acquisition of shares in the public company\n\nMoreover, with regards to substantial holdings in public companies the following rules apply:\n\nthe acquisition of shares constituting more than 10% of the total vote within a period of less than 60 days by the holders entitled to less than 33% of the total vote may be effected only as a result of announcing a public offer to subscribe for sale or conversion of equities representing not less than 10% of the total vote.

KIR operates through its regional centres and organised the cash clearing through its electronic payment system called ELIXIR.\n\nAnother cash clearing system is conducted by DSP (Department of Payments Systems) of NBP through its system called SORBNET.\n\nELIXIR\n\nAn electronic settlement based on a system that is used by local banks only for processing customers' payments not exceeding PLN 1 million. Funds transfers are processed electronically while grouping in larger (\"wholesale\") payments (all payments of one particular local bank, for instance) and delivered to NBP (DSP in fact) through SORBNET to settle finally. There are three ELIXIR sessions per day: morning session (10.30 – 11.00), afternoon session (14.30 – 15.00) and evening session (19.00 – 19.30).\n\n.\n\nFunds transfers, initiated during the first, and/or second session of ELIXIR, are available for the beneficiaries on the same day as value date and the payments are booked with the same value date. As funds from the third ELIXIR session are only available to the beneficiary's bank in the evening, market practice is for Polish banks to book payments cleared through this session in the morning on the next day with the original value date. Some banks may book such payments with the next-day value.\n\nSORBNET / SORBNET-EURO\n\nAn electronic real time settlement system. Same-day funds transfers are processed electronically for all cash payment orders in the amount of or exceeding PLN 1 milliononly via SORBNET. Due to a real time basis of cash settlements, payment orders of the value below PLN 1 million can be processed via both systems.\n\nThe main features of interbank settlement in the SORBNET system are:\n\nunconditionally between 08:00 and 16:00, in exceptional emergency cases, upon prior approval with beneficiary's bank, the payment may be effected by 17:00, pursuant to the rule of real-time settlement, i.e. immediately, once payment order has been submitted by the bank to the NBP payment orders executed via SORBNET may not be cancelled once executed interbank settlements in SORBNET take place through simultaneously debiting and crediting banks' accounts maintained with DSP and serviced in this system payment orders in SORBNET are executed pursuant to the gross settlement rule, i.e. by separate execution of each payment order.\n\nEffective March 7, 2005, NBP launched SORBNET-EURO, while the National Clearing House (KIR) launched Euro-ELIXIR, the local payment systems which allow Euro domestic payments and Euro cross-border payments from/to TARGET and STEP2 payment systems. In order to join TARGET system, the NBP opened an account with the Italian central bank Banca d`Italia, which is a member of TARGET.\n\nSORBNET-EURO allows domestic payments in the form of RTGS, whilst Euro-ELIXIR allows domestic payments to be made via two settlement sessions a day (the same-day settlement). With regards to cross-border payments SORBNET-EURO allows RTGS, while Euro-ELIXIR allows overnight processing.\n\nThere is no limit for cash payment for domestic payments via Euro-ELIXIR. For cross-border payments via Euro-ELIXIR, there is an EUR 50,000 limit. For foreign currency securities traded in Poland, except for securities in EUR, KDPW has an agreement with the local commercial bank, BZ WBK S.A. (formerly it was Kredyt Bank S.A. – BZ WBK is a successor of the agreement between Kredyt Bank S.A and NBP after the takeover Kredyt Bank S.A. by BZ WBK S.A.), which acts as cash clearing agent for foreign currencies.\n\nAs a result of the launch of SORBNET-EURO payment system by the NBP, effective from March 7, 2005, KDPW moved Euro payments of issuers' obligations to the entitled holders of securities such as dividend and interest, and cash settlement of securities transactions denominated in Euro to NBP.\n\nAt present, there are only a few securities quoted in Euro admitted to the trading on WSE. Euro accounts of KDPW participants opened with NBP are mostly used for processing of payments of issuers' obligations in Euro to the entitled holders of securities (i.e., dividend payments) for several companies from the Euro zone traded on WSE that are quoted in PLN.\n\nTrading on WSE in other currencies than PLN are available also for the following currencies: EUR, USD, GBP, CZK, and HUF, however issuers do not register their securities at KDPW denominated in other currencies than PLN. Both WSE system of quotation and clearing and of KDPW_CCP and KDPW are prepared for trading in financial instruments denominated in other currencies than PLN.\n\nProceeds from shares like dividends can be paid out in foreign currencies depending on the Issuer's decision as for dividend payment procedure."
