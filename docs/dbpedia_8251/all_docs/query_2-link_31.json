Currently more than 55 million scans of archive materials are available in the service, their number still growing.\n\nService content\n\nThe source of the archive descriptions in the service are the data from the Integrated Archive Information System (ZoSIA). The service also contains data from the Programme for the Registration of Records from Parish and Civil Registration Offices (PRADZIAD), which collects information on genealogical materials kept in the state archives. Scans of archive materials are derived from the collections of the Polish state archives and other cultural institutions. The information of interest may be easily found thanks to the user-friendly search engine offering many useful filters and options.\n\nCopies of archive materials presented in the service may be used in any manner, including downloading, copying and other distributing using any technology unless otherwise stated in the descriptions of the materials or on the digital copies.\n\nUsers\n\nThe Search the Archives service may be used by genealogists, students, teachers, academics, and any other person interested in using the resources of the Polish archives. The service renders it possible to use archive materials kept in the archives in the various parts of Poland from home. You only need Internet access and a browser to use the service.\n\nHistory of development"
