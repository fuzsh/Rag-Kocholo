        "text": "For Chi-chi Nwanoku, coming up with the right name for her new minority orchestra was a stressful experience.\n\nThough Ms. Nwanoku had quickly formed a board of directors and had already selected most of her players — 62 musicians representing 31 different nationalities — she was constantly reminded that it would be hard to promote their first concert at the Queen Elizabeth Hall at the Southbank Center here in September 2015 or to even set up a website without a name.\n\nShe knew she did not want it to be the Such-and-Such Philharmonic or the Something Symphony, and the recent trend for orchestras to take Latin or Greek names also did not inspire her. But the night before one of her board meetings, the name came to Ms. Nwanoku, a double bass player who grew up in Britain, where she was classically trained.\n\n“I literally sat bolt upright in my bed at 4 a.m. and I just shouted ‘Chineke!’ ” she said, referring to a word from the Nigerian Igbo tribe, which was her father’s clan. “In Chinua Achebe’s book ‘Things Fall Apart,’ you see the word ‘Chineke’ every now and then, with people exclaiming it when something amazing happens. It means ‘wonderful’ or ‘wow.’ ”"
