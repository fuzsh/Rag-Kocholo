        "text": "The String Family\n\nThe string family of the orchestra makes up the majority of the musicians on stage, and is comprised of 5 instruments:\n\n1.) the Violin, 2.) the Viola, 3.) the Cello, 4.) the Double Bass, and 5.) the Harp.\n\nThe four main instruments of this family (violin, viola, cello, and double bass) are made out of carved wood, and strung with 4 metal strings. They have bodies that are hollow, and feature elegantly carved sound holes on their fronts that project their beautiful, resonant sound. (The harp is a little different, but we’ll talk about that in a minute…) String instruments can produce their sound in one of two main ways ways:\n\nThey can pluck the strings with their fingers (a technique which is called “pizzicato”), which produces a short, clear sound;\n\nOr, they can draw a wooden bow strung with horse tail hairs across the strings (which is called “arco”), which produces a warm and continuous sound.\n\nString players can also use wooden part of their bows to hit the strings, which produces a thin, metallic sound (called “col legno”), as well as different types of bow strokes, with each creating a different and unique sound effect.\n\nThe Woodwind Family:\n\nThe Woodwind family is comprised of 4 main instruments: 1.) the Flute, 2.) the Oboe, 3.) the Clarinet, and 4.) the Bassoon.\n\nThe woodwind family (so named because it’s members are made out of various types of wood, except for the flute) is comprised of instruments that require blowing air into to for sound production. All four of these instruments consist of a single, long tube with holes drilled along their length. To change the note being played, the musician will either cover or uncover a specific pattern of holes. Some of these holes are covered just with the tip of the players fingers, while others that are too far away from the player’s hands are covered using a mechanism made of keys, rods and pads.\n\nAll of these instruments, with the exception of the Flute, are “Reed” instruments; in other words, the air is blown through a mouthpiece with a thin wooden reed attached to it, which produces the vibrations that create the instrument’s sound. By contrast, a flute player creates their sound by blowing air across an open hole in the head joint (much like blowing across a Coke bottle and making it whistle).\n\nDoubling Up\n\nIt is common for several woodwind players in the orchestra to “double” on a piece of music, which means playing two instruments during a piece. This additional instrument will always be a member of their main instrument’s family. For flute players, this can mean also playing the Piccolo; oboe players might have to play the English Horn; clarinet players might have to play either the E-flat Clarinet or the Bass Clarinet; and bassoon players might play the Contrabassoon. In every orchestra, one of the woodwind players in each section, usually the 3rd chair player, will be responsible for playing the doubling instrument part. It just depends on the piece, and what instruments the composer has written to use.\n\nAltogether then, there are 9 woodwind instruments we’ll look at that feature prominently as a part of the orchestra. This is not including a number of other woodwinds that are used in some orchestral music but are not a standard part of the woodwind section (these include the Alto Flute, Oboe d’amore, Bass Oboe, Heckelphone, Alto Clarinet, Contrabass Clarinet, and the members of the Saxophone family)."
