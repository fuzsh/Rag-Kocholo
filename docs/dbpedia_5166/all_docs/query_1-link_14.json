        "text": "Mission: ECHO is a musical collaborator dedicated to sharing musical and arts experiences through concerts, private events, and educational programs that will strengthen the community and enhance appreciation of orchestral music.\n\nIn the fall of 2014 a great endeavor was hatched and now ECHO is headed into the next decade with exciting new collaborative programming, free public concerts and outreach events, and the addition of a 4th children’s concert. We couldn’t be more proud of how far we have come as a 501(c)(3) non-profit arts organization. Since our founding we have continued to grow financially and artistically and we couldn’t have done it without the support of our community. Over the last 10 seasons ECHO has collaborated with many different Houston area arts and community organizations and talented local musicians and artists. Some of the featured artists include Mercy Renteria with Undabel Flamenco, Steven Greenman (Klezmer Violinist), Houston Symphony Musicians (Rodica Gonzales, 1st violin; Wei Jiang, Assistant Principal Viola; MuChen Hsieh, principal 2nd violin), Tianna Hall, Houston Brass Quintet, Fly Dance Company, Silambam Houston, and more! ECHO was also awarded “Best Community Orchestra” in 2021 by the Houston Press. Now that we are moving into a new decade with our orchestra we feel as though we have a lot to look forward to and to share with the West Houston community. Our season runs from August to June with full orchestra concerts, community chamber events, a Young Artist Concerto Competition for high school students, a Summer Camp for middle school string students, and community collaborations with the Energy Corridor District. We look forward to serenading you and we hope you will join us as we ignite the spirit of music in West Houston!\n\nPerform\n\nIf you would like to perform with ECHO please set up an audition with our conductor Michael Fahey at: conductor@ECHOrchestra.org\n\nEducation\n\nECHO members have many talents, so if you are looking for private lessons please contact us.\n\nPrivate Events\n\nWe also provide the opportunity to entertain your next event. Please contact us if you would like us play at your next party or fundraiser at info@ECHOrchestra.org\n\nVolunteer\n\nIn order to ensure a successful performance we are always looking for volunteers to usher, organize donor events, ticketing, help with marketing, and much more.
