        "text": "By Kayleigh Gallagher, Digital Storytelling and Creative Marketing Manager June 22, 2023\n\nDuring our upcoming 2023-24 Season, The Phoenix Symphony will perform in eight different venues across The Valley including Symphony Hall, Orpheum Theatre, Mesa Arts Center Ikeda Theater and many more. With hundreds or thousands of seats at each concert hall, you might be wondering, how do I pick the best seats? Some of the factors to look at when choosing your seats are the view, sound and experience that each seat offers.\n\nVIEW\n\nWhile the music of the orchestra will reach you no matter where you sit, your view will differ depending on your seat. Some people prefer to sit on the main floor closer to the stage to get a good look at the conductor and guest artists. Others prefer to choose a seat in the balcony to take in the full scene of everything happening on stage. Think about which parts of the performance you are most interested in to determine where in the hall will give you the best view of the action.\n\nSOUND\n\nThe most balanced sound in the hall is usually in the center of the hall. If you are looking for the purest sound, this area would be a great place to look! If you are looking for a seat closer to the stage, some parts of the orchestra will be more prominent. Nearer to the front of the Hall, the strings are usually the foremost sound. If you choose a seat that gives you the full view of the orchestra, the sound will be more balanced than if you sit closer to the stage.\n\nEXPERIENCE\n\nSitting nearer to the back or side of the hall in a less dense area will give you a more relaxing experience. This is a good spot for first-time symphony goers to get their bearings before choosing to sit in the front and center of the hall. Sitting closer to the stage amongst a crowd of other patrons can make your night more evocative. These seats will give you a more active experience and the chance to meet and interact with other concertgoers (during intermission of course!).\n\nTALK TO THE EXPERTS\n\nTo get the absolute best advice on where to sit in each concert hall, talk to Patron Services! The Patron Services team knows the halls very well and they hear feedback from other patrons. They can give you information to make the most informed decision about where to sit. Now that you know how to choose your seats, donâ€™t hesitate to book your 2023-24 Season subscription with The Phoenix Symphony to lock in your favorite spot in the hall!"
