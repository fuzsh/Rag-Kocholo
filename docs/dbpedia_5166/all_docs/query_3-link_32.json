        "text": "The Mission of the Southwest Florida Symphony is to perform outstanding orchestral music for the enrichment, entertainment and education of the broadest possible public. Fulfilling this mission is only possible through the generosity of our supporters. Visit our CONTRIBUTE page to learn more about how your gift can make a difference in the cultural landscape of our community and beyond.\n\nThe Southwest Florida Symphony is Lee and Charlotte Countiesâ€™ only fully professional symphony orchestra and is one of the oldest symphony orchestras in the state. For more than six decades, the Southwest Florida Symphony has grown to a roster of 70 world-class musicians. Artists travel from around the country to participate in a rigorous audition process for an opportunity to join our ranks. Each season, our orchestra performs a series of mainstage concerts at Barbara B. Mann Performing Arts Hall, with select programs being repeated at the Charlotte Performing Arts Center in Punta Gorda. We also perform with smaller ensembles at more intimate venues throughout Lee and Charlotte Counties.\n\nBarbara B. Mann Performing Arts Hall Series\n\nThis is our signature concert series at the performing arts center that was constructed as a musical home for the Southwest Florida Symphony. The Barbara B. Mann Performing Arts Hall Series features a variety of genres, including bold fusions of classical and popular works, performed by a full symphony orchestra, including world-renowned guest artists and conductors.\n\nGet Involved\n\nThere are many ways to support the Southwest Florida Symphony!\n\nDid you know it takes much more than ticket sales to bring orchestral music to Southwest Florida each year? Ticket sales cover only 40% of the Symphonyâ€™s annual expenses. The remaining 60% is provided by charitable contributions from friends like you, businesses, foundations and grants.\n\nLEARN MORE"
