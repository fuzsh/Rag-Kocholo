        "text": "The Wisconsin Chamber Orchestra was founded in 1960 by Gordon B. Wright as the Madison Summer Symphony Orchestra. The Summer Symphony’s repertoire consisted of great orchestral music from all ages. Our concerts were free to the public from the beginning. Upon leaving Wisconsin in 1969, Wright tapped David Lewis Crosby to lead the orchestra.\n\nIn 1974, the Madison Summer Symphony officially became the Wisconsin Chamber Orchestra to reflect our expanded mission to serve communities across the state throughout the entire year. Continuing to grow, in 1980, we debuted our first season of indoor concerts, called the Artist Series, at the Madison Civic Center during its first year of operation. That series has evolved over time and today is the WCO’s Masterworks series, which has brought dozens of world-class guest performers to Wisconsin audiences.\n\nIn the winter of 1983, Madison businesswoman Pleasant Rowland saw the opportunity to improve access to the arts and create a sense of community while gathering on the beautiful Wisconsin State Capitol lawn. By the next summer, that idea evolved into our first season of Concerts on the Square. Like today, the series was completely free of charge for the entire community. It has grown into a gem of Madison, and annually over 200,000 patrons come together on Square for this six-concert series.\n\nFollowing the unexpected passing of Maestro Crosby in 1998, Andrew Sewell was named Music Director in fall 2000. Under Maestro Sewell’s 20 years of leadership, the WCO’s ventures have grown to include the statewide Young Artist Concerto Competition, Messiah performances at Blackhawk Church, performances of The Nutcracker in collaboration with Madison Ballet, and our Side by Side project concerts with young musicians of the Wisconsin Youth Symphony Orchestras.\n\nThe WCO has been a resident company of Overture Center for the Arts in Madison, WI since its opening in 2004. The Overture Center was made possible by the trailblazing philanthropy of Jerry Frautschi, who donated $205 million to initiate its creation. Since becoming one of the resident companies of Overture, the WCO has fully established itself as one of the premier chamber ensembles in the United States and brings the best of classical music to hundreds of thousands of Wisconsinites each year.\n\nWCO Milestones\n\n1960\n\nConductor Gordon B. Wright founds the Madison Summer Symphony. The first performances of this new orchestra take place during the summer months at the East Side Business Association on the shore of Lake Monona. Following the first season, performances were moved to Edgewood College on the shore of Lake Wingra, where they remained for the next 10 years. The orchestra performed a four-concert series on Sunday evenings in July. Three people comprised the board of directors during the ’60s, and all concerts are free to the public.\n\n1968-1969\n\nGordon Wright is engaged as conductor of the Fairbanks College Symphony Orchestra in Alaska in late 1968. David Lewis Crosby moves to Madison about this same time and meets Wright in Otto-Werner Mueller’s graduate conducting class. Wright recruits Crosby as Wright’s successor. Crosby assumes the titles of Artistic Director and Conductor. The annual budget is $4,000.\n\n1974-1975\n\nThe Madison Summer Symphony changes its name to the Wisconsin Chamber Orchestra to reflect its expanded mission to serve communities across the state. The summer series is now performed at various parks in Madison.\n\n1980\n\nThe WCO debuts the Artist Series – a series of performances featuring classical repertoire and guest artists during the fall and winter months. It performs this season in the Madison Civic Center during the Civic Center’s first year of operation. The core orchestra grew from 20 to 30 musicians.\n\n1983-1984\n\nPleasant T. Rowland, a Madison businesswoman, approaches the WCO about moving its summer programming to Wisconsin’s Capitol Square. Subsequently, the first season of Concerts on the Square takes place in 1984. Founding sponsors for the series are the Evjue Foundation and the Norman Bassett Foundation. The Board of Directors is in place. The first full-time manager is hired. The annual budget is approximately $150,000.\n\n1985\n\nArtist Series moves to First Congregational Church to take advantage of the superior acoustics, sight-lines, and price.\n\n1991\n\nThe run-out program begins with a performance in Columbus, Wisconsin. The stage is built from scratch and shaded by a winter pool cover.\n\n1992-1994\n\nThe WCO experiences a running $50,000 budget deficit for years 1992-1993. Wisconsin’s state government bails the WCO out with a one-time $100,000 grant to cover the deficits. The WCO develops its first long-range strategic plan to provide clear direction and a strong foundation for the Orchestra. The orchestra finishes the year with a small surplus absent state funding.\n\n1998\n\nMadison mourns the sudden death of David Lewis Crosby on July 29, just two hours before the final Concert on the Square of the season is to take place. Following a tribute concert in September, the WCO Board announces an 18-month search process that will be used to select Crosby’s successor. Crosby served the WCO for 28 years.\n\nThe day before Crosby’s death, local businessman Jerry Frautschi announces a $50 million gift for a new arts facility in Madison. Ultimately, the gift grows to over $200 million by the time Overture Center is completed in 2006. WCO has the opportunity to be part of the planning process for the new facilities.\n\n1999\n\nThe WCO celebrates its 40th anniversary. The Music Director search draws over 240 applicants from around the world; a new logo is developed; and the Artist Series is renamed Concerts OFF the Square.\n\n2006\n\nConcerts on the Square celebrate Madison’s sesquicentennial, including Home to Madison, a song commissioned from Tracy Silverman. The first WYSO Side by Side Project is held. Masterworks features soloists pianist Garrick Ohlsson, French saxophonist Claude Delangle, violinist Rachel Barton Pine, and pianist Adam Neiman. The WCO records a double CD, Mozart – The Early Concerti, with Adam Neiman performing three early Mozart piano concertos and the Symphony No. 38 Prague, scheduled for release in May 2008.\n\n2007\n\nThe WCO’s founder, Gordon Wright, dies at the age of 72 while on the porch of his cabin in Rainbow, Alaska. After 17 years, CEO Bob Sorge announces his departure to take a position at the Madison Community Foundation. Repertoire highlights to the indoor season include Mahler’s Death and The Maiden, Shostakovich’s Prelude and Scherzo, Shchedrin’s Chamber Suite. The WCO purchases a building downtown at 321 E. Main Street. The core orchestra is 34 musicians.\n\n2008\n\nThe WCO marks the 25th anniversary of Concerts on the Square with special guests Philadelphia-based Time For Three, trumpet virtuoso Ryan Anthony, and pianist Wendy Chen opening with Rhapsody in Blue. The season includes a collaboration with the Isthmus Vocal Ensemble and Met mezzo-soprano star Kitt Foss performing for the finale summer concert. Doug Gerhart is appointed as CEO on September 1. The indoor season is cut short by the announcement of a musician strike on October 3, lasting seven months.
