In addition, music directors work with the general manager, business manager, and other senior staff to develop and implement long-term artistic, financial, and administrative plans for the orchestra.\n\nMusic directors are skilled instrumentalists and seasoned conductors who have worked tirelessly to develop their artistry, build a reputation, and ascend the ranks."
