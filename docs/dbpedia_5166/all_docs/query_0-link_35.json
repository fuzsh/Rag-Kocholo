A cultural leader in a city known for its vibrant arts community, Sarasota Orchestra’s threefold mission is dedicated to exquisite performance and first-class musical education.\n\nAs the oldest continuing orchestra in the state of Florida, each year the 76-member Orchestra performs more than 100 classical, pops, chamber music, and community outreach concerts.\n\nSarasota Orchestra's acclaimed music education program includes the Sarasota Youth Orchestras, established in 1959 and currently supporting eight student ensembles, as well as the annual Summer Music Camp. Sarasota Orchestra also offers music lessons for students of all ages and abilities and sponsors multiple outreach programs. An annual tradition since 1953, the Orchestra’s Young Person’s Concerts brings the joy and wonder of a symphony orchestra performance to nearly 10,000 Sarasota and Manatee County fourth- and fifth-graders every fall."
