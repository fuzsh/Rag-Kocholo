For a comprehensive narrative on the history of the Portland Symphony Orchestra and Merrill Auditorium featuring a searchable digital library of 2000+ concert performances, copies of 1500+ original concert playbills and seven decades of pre-season brochures, and several hundred photographs, please visit PSOHistory.org, curated and authored by Hank and Sue Schmitt, with technical website assistance from their daughter and son-in-law Val Schmitt and Rob LeVine.\n\nDecember 1923\n\nA group of leading Portland musicians comes together to form a musical organization. Invitations for membership are sent to interested parties throughout the area.\n\nJanuary 18, 1924\n\nThe newly formed group, the Amateur Strand Symphony Orchestra, holds its first rehearsal with 75 instrumentalists. “Portland Symphony Orchestra” was suggested for the name, but rejected as being “too imposing for this tenuous new adventure”! Arthur F. Kendall begins his term as the first conductor (1923-26).\n\nFebruary 24, 1924\n\nThe first concert is given at the Strand Theatre.\n\nApril 24, 1924\n\nA committee comprising Henry C. Cook, Mildred M. Dugan, Carroll Brow, Arthur H. Stevens, Clinton W. Graffam Sr., and Hiram Gratrix meet at the Strand Theatre and vote to organize into a corporation called the Portland Orchestral Society “to advance and encourage the study and appreciation of music; to demonstrate to and educate our citizens about the advantages and value of good music to the community; the giving of private and public concerts; and to otherwise fulfill the offices usually devolving upon and fulfilled by such an orchestral body.”\n\n1925\n\nThe first appearance of the Portland Orchestral Society.\n\nFebruary 1927\n\nThe organization became known as the Portland Municipal Orchestra, and comprised 65 musicians.\n\n1927-32\n\nCharles Raymond Cronham, Portland’s Municipal Organist, serves as conductor. He extends rehearsals and the concert schedule, and inaugurates out-of-town concerts.\n\nMay 1927\n\nThe first concert of the Portland Municipal Orchestra is given, not in Portland, but in Bridgton at the Town Hall. The 65-member Orchestra arrives to find the hall locked up, and the custodian off fishing! Eventually, the hall is opened and the concert goes on, though somewhat late. The orchestra follows this debut a few days later with their first Portland performance.\n\nDecember 25, 1927\n\nThe orchestra participates in the Portland Music Commission’s Christmas program.\n\nJanuary 1928\n\nThe orchestra gives a concert at Bowdoin College. Transportation of the entire orchestra and all the instruments, including two pianos, is furnished by public-spirited citizens. Among the 82 players were men and women of some 20 professions, and boys and girls, the youngest of whom was 14-year-old Katherine Hatch (later Graffam), who went on to serve as the principal cellist for 30 years, as the orchestra’s historian, and as music critic for the Gannett Newspapers. In the trumpet section was William Vacchiano, who went on to be principal trumpet of the New York Philharmonic.\n\nApril 26, 1932\n\nThe Portland Symphony Orchestra is incorporated.\n\n1933-34\n\nCharles A. Warren, school music supervisor for Brunswick, becomes conductor.\n\n1935-37\n\nPaul E. Melrose, Warrant Officer and Band Leader, 5th U.S. Infantry Band at Fort Williams, serves as conductor.\n\n1937\n\nThe orchestra engages its first paid conductor.\n\n1938-51\n\nThe tenure of conductor Dr. Russell Ames Cook. Dr. Cook, from Boston, was the first out-of-state conductor, who also taught at Waynflete School. Friendly and polished, he made firm connections with many of the leading families in the city, and was able to interest them in giving substantial support to the orchestra. This initiated the steadily increasing list of public donors, supporters and volunteers who have played a tremendous part in helping the symphony achieve its present high standing in the life of the community and the world of music.\n\n1938-39\n\nThe orchestra institutes Young People’s Concerts and the Portland Pops, and the Women’s Auxiliary (later the Women’s Committee, and then the Friends of PSO) is established, boasting an initial membership of 15.\n\n1939\n\nThe orchestra performs Oedipus Tyrannus by John Knowles Paine, born in 1839 on Oxford Street in Portland, in observance of his centenary.\n\n1940\n\nUnder the guidance of Mrs. Guy Gannett, the 24 members of the Women’s Auxiliary spearhead such activities as selling tickets, seeking sponsorships, and fund-raising by telephone.\n\n1941-1945\n\nDuring the years of World War II, a tremendous influx of people into Portland from the South Portland Shipyard and other war industries make both the orchestra and its audiences flourish. All concerts open with “The Star-Spangled Banner.”\n\nMarch 22, 1942\n\nThe first rehearsal of the 65-member Student Philharmonic Orchestra, created and conducted for 32 years by Clinton W. Graffam Jr., is held at the Chestnut Street Church. Mr. Graffam, whose father was one of the PSO’s founders, was a PSO oboist for 53 years.\n\nMay 19, 1942\n\nThe first concert by the Student Philharmonic is given at Portland City Hall Auditorium before an audience of 1,200. The soloist was 15-year-old Cape Elizabeth pianist David Baker, who played the first movement of Mendelssohn’s G-minor concerto. The concert was sponsored as a benefit for the War Service Department by the Maine Federation of Music Clubs. In place of an admission fee, concert-goers donated sheet music and phonograph records, which were to be distributed to members of the Armed Forces throughout Maine.\n\nDecember 7, 1943\n\nOn the second anniversary of the bombing of Pearl Harbor, the orchestra gives a concert with uniformed soloist PFC Leonard Pennario, who receives a tremendous reception following his performance of Chopin’s Piano Concerto No. 2 in F minor.\n\n1952-56\n\nRichard Burgin, Concertmaster and Associate Conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, becomes conductor. He was particularly effective in improving the string section.\n\n1956-58\n\nGuest Conductors:\n\nSamuel Seineger\n\nRouben Gregorian\n\nAttilio Poto\n\nFrancis Findlay\n\n1958-61\n\nRouben Gregorian serves as conductor. A graduate of Central College in Iran, he was the co-founder and past conductor of the Tehran Symphony Orchestra. In Portland, he finalized the enactment of a fully paid orchestra in 1959, and inaugurated young artists talent auditions in 1960.\n\n1962-67\n\nArthur Bennett Lipkin, from Philadelphia, becomes the first resident conductor. He is the first to commission new works. During his tenure, Youth Concerts were begun, and the orchestra was involved with the Voice of America broadcasts, including the broadcast to Kyoto, Japan, on November 16, 1965, featuring a world premiere by Walter Piston.\n\n1966-67\n\nGuest Conductors:\n\nCharles Gabor\n\nElyakum Shapiro\n\nMaurice Kaplow\n\nAndrew Galos\n\nPaul Vermel\n\n1967-75\n\nPaul Vermel’s tenure as conductor. Mr. Vermel conducts a five-day Canadian Tour, and inaugurates outdoor concerts and concert previews. During this time, Portland City Hall Auditorium is renovated and redecorated, and the Community Orchestra of the Portland Symphony is born.\n\n1969\n\nThe orchestra changes its name from the Portland Maine Symphony to the Portland Symphony Orchestra.\n\n1974-75\n\nThe 50th Anniversary Season poster is created by artist Robert Indiana. The Willamain McPhee Thaxter Memorial Composition Fund is created for commissioning new works. Commissioned works by Walter Piston and Elliott Schwartz are premiered. The PSO Women’s Committee publishes Portland Symphony Orchestra Cookbook, which goes on to sell 45,000 copies over five printings.\n\n1975-76\n\nGuest Conductors:\n\nMichael Palmer\n\nMichael Charry\n\nClaude Monteux\n\nBruce Hangen\n\nMaurice Kaplow\n\nRichard Williams\n\nTibor Pusztai\n\n1976-86\n\nBruce Hangen’s tenure as Music Director and Conductor. Under his leadership, the PSO develops a national reputation for its artistic quality. Larger and broader audiences are developed through a variety of programs, and summer concerts become established events for Maine residents and visitors. Expanded education programs attract children of all ages. Performances of works by many contemporary composers are given, and eight works are premiered. Mr. Hangen also creates and develops the Portland Symphony Chamber Orchestra.\n\n1976-77\n\nKinderKonzerts for pre-school and primary grade children are inaugurated. James Barbagallo wins the PSO/Unionmutual Piano Competition.\n\n1977-78\n\nSuperBand production is given at WGME 13.

Guest narrator Margaret Hamilton (the Wicked Witch of the West from The Wizard of Oz) narrates “A Visit from St. Nicholas” at two sold-out concerts. The Christmas Chorus (now the Magic of Christmas Chorus) makes its first of 20 consecutive “Magic” appearances (and still counting!).\n\n1981\n\nSymphony by the Sea at the Atlantic House is held.

Summer concerts are held in Cape Elizabeth, Portland, Ogunquit, Old Orchard Beach, Bridgton, Bath, Auburn, Kingfield, and North Conway.\n\n1986-2006\n\nTenure of Music Director and Conductor Toshiyuki Shimada. He is credited with tightening the orchestra’s grasp of symphonic masterworks and deepening its commitment to youth and family programming, while building higher on the firm musical foundations left by his predecessors. Under his guidance, the PSO was one of 23 American orchestras receiving an award from the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) for adventuresome programming of contemporary music.\n\n1987\n\nJane E.

Tchaikovsky Competition winning pianist Brigitte Engerer wows Portland with her performance of Tchaikovsky’s Piano Concerto No. 1, and several other wonderful soloists took the stage with the PSO as well. Three Mozart & More concerts are performed in Rockland.

Bruce Hangen returns to lead Magic of Christmas, and opera superstar Renee Fleming makes her Maine debut with the PSO in an endowment benefit concert, a first for the orchestra. A painting is commissioned from artist Debra Yoo, which is used to create the inaugural season commemorative poster.\n\n2009-2010\n\nThe PSO presents a truly extraordinary 85th anniversary season. Concerts feature collaborations with Portland Stage, Portland Ballet, Choral Art Society – and notably with Figures of Speech Puppet Theatre on an exceptional reinvention of the 30thannual Magic of Christmas. Celebrated guest artists include mandolin virtuoso Chris Thile and percussionist Dame Evelyn Glennie among others. The season closes with a bang – a Pops! finale featuring Portland’s favorite disco party band Motor Booty Affair and Robert Moody in full disco-era regalia, as well as two performances of the titanic Mahler Symphony No. 2 – Maestro Moody’s favorite work to conduct. Technological innovations include the launch of Online Insights, a series of informational webisodes, and the release of the PSO iPhone application with support from the Maine Arts Commission. New audience engagement initiatives include Afterglow, a post-concert social event, and a “Student Rush” ticket discount program. The PSO is named a “Community of Honor” for Ford’s Made in America collaborative commissioning project in April 2010, and is also honored to receive the Governor’s Award for Nonprofit Excellence from the Maine Association of Nonprofits.\n\n2010-2011\n\nThe season opened with a collaboration with New England Rehab Hospital and Maine Medical Center focusing on music and healing featuring violist Harold Lieberman. A new work by composer Del Case was commissioned for our KinderKonzert series, based on the true story of Abbie Burgess, a heroic girl who kept Matinicus Lighthouse burning during an 1856 nor’easter. November brought a whirlwind visit with the energetic trio Time for Three who performed at King Middle School, taught a Suzuki workshop, played at private donor event targeted to an audience of young professionals, appeared on 207, performed their Sunday Classical concert and played an encore after-concert for musicians and audience members. What incredible energy and passion for music! Speaking of passion, in January we held an educational, multi-perspective panel and community dialogue on Bach’s St. John’s Passion – often a controversial piece for communities – with Robert Moody, Rabbi Carolyn Braun, and Reverend Frank Strasburger, moderated by Bob Keyes of the Portland Press Herald. And another kind of passion entirely inspired our first public proposal of marriage at the PSO Pops! Motown tribute concert around Valentine’s Day. (She said yes!)\n\nThis season also brought Lisa Dixon as Executive Director, and marked the launch of a Strategic Planning process, involving over 100 members of the PSO family and community members, designed to establish a blueprint for sustainability and future growth.\n\n2011-2012\n\nThe PSO’s 87th season opened with a pair of concerts featuring world-class pianist Awadagin Pratt playing the beloved Beethoven “Emperor Concerts.” In October, the US Naval Academy Glee Club joined Maestro Moody for a Pops concert to remember, with President and Mrs. Bush (#41) making a surprise visit to enjoy the stirring military music. At Halloween, the PSO donned their scariest costumes to present our very first family-friendly Discovery Concert (“Symphony Spooktacular”) to a sold-out crowd. Magic of Christmas returned in December, featuring the high-flying aerialists of Cirque de la Symphonie. Christopher Warren Green, conductor for the royal wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton, was a guest conductor in January, and in February romance was close at hand with the performance of suites from “Romeo and Juliet” and Mozart’s dreamiest Piano Conert, No. 21. Two centennials coincided with the season’s finale: the mighty Kotzschmar Organ, and season sponsor LL Bean. The Kotzschmar, and Portland Municipal Organist Ray Cornils, were featured in this last concert, with symphonies from Jongen and Saint-Saens, before it was temporarily dismantled and shipped to Connecticut for 2 years of pampering and some well-deserved refurbishing.\n\n2012-2013\n\nRobert Moody’s fifth season as Music Director of the PSO featured many “fives,” including a well-received performance of Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony. The season opener coincided with sponsor Verrill Dana’s 150th anniversary, which made for a festive beginning to the PSO’s 88th season. October brought a “Cello-bration” with a concert that opened with a piece for 15 cellos (including Music Director Robert Moody) and continued to feature two solo cellists with a PSO connection, Joel Noyes and Brian Thornton. The celebration of the cello also brought the first-ever PSO Community Cello Choir, bringing cellists of all ages and skill levels together for a Sunday afternoon concert on the Merrill stage. To celebrate Mozart’s 256th birthday in January, PSO Concertmaster Charles Dimmick performed the master’s Third Violin Concerto to great acclaim. The classical season ended in May with Mahler’s emotional Fifth Symphony. A second Discovery Concert was added in the Spring (“Carnival of the Animals”), featuring four-legged, feathered, and scaly special guests, brought to Merrill Auditorium by the Chewonki Foundation and Smiling Hill Farm. Finally, we announced the hiring of Assistant Conductor Norman Huynh."
