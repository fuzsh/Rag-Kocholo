Due to our Late Seating Policy, we strongly recommend that you plan on arriving 30 to 45 minutes before the concert to allow enough time to comfortably be seated. Out of courtesy to musicians and other patrons, latecomers and those who must leave during the performance will be seated or reseated between complete works or at intermission. TV monitors are stationed near each of the theater doors.\n\nWhere can I get more information if I can't find my answer on mso.org?\n\nFor information on tickets, performances, programs, parking, restaurants, or anything else having to do with your MSO experience, call the MSO Box Office at 414.291.7605. We will be happy to assist you.\n\nWhat should I wear to an MSO performance?\n\nWhether you wear bejeweled rings or nose rings, everyone is welcome at our concerts and we’re happy to say that we have no dress code. As a general guideline, most of our audience members opt for business casual attire. Please remember that this time is for you, and we want you to be comfortable.\n\nCan I take photos or videos at concerts?\n\nPlease be advised that there are no photographs or video recordings of any kind allowed during Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra performances.\n\nHow long do most concerts last?\n\nMost Classics, Pops, and Special Presentation concerts last about two hours, including intermission.\n\nWhen do I applaud?\n\nWe love your enthusiastic applause! At Pops concerts, we encourage applause after every piece. During Classics concerts, it is customary to hold your applause until all movements are complete. We list the number of movements for each work in our program book, Encore.\n\nDo I need to “prepare” for classics concerts in order to appreciate the music?\n\nWhile you can always enjoy the music as it is performed, you can enhance your concert experience with a better understanding of the story behind the music. We invite all ticket holders to attend Meet the Music, a FREE informational presentation held one hour before each Classics concert. We publish program notes in our program book, Encore, and you can read them ahead of time at mso.org.\n\nCan I bring my children to concerts?\n\nIntroducing children to the spectacular world of classical music is a gift that will last a lifetime. Please do note that we require all patrons of any age to have their own concert ticket. Children six years of age and older are welcome to attend regular concerts when accompanied by an adult, while Joan Steele Stein Family Concerts are especially designed for children 3-10 years of age.\n\nWhat is the MSO Weather Policy?\n\nThe Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra rarely cancels public performances due to weather and we recommend adjusting your travel time accordingly. If you are joining us from out of town, you may wish to seek overnight accommodations from this list of downtown area hotels.\n\nShould a performance be cancelled due to weather, the Milwaukee Symphony will announce the cancellation no later than 3 hours before scheduled curtain time. Cancellation information will be posted on our homepage and on MSO social media channels, including Facebook and Twitter.\n\nSchool programs and student performances will be cancelled due to weather upon closing of the MPS School district. Schools will be notified by a member of the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra’s Education staff in advance of the scheduled program. Every effort will be made to reschedule performances for schools missing a program due to weather. Additional information specific to Concerts for Schools and inclement weather/event cancellation can be found here.\n\nWhat if I have special ticketing or seating needs?\n\nThe Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra is dedicated to making sure each patron is equipped to enjoy the concert at its fullest. The Milwaukee Symphony and the Bradley Symphony Center has partnered with KultureCity to improve our ability to assist and accommodate guests with sensory needs. Our objective is to provide an inclusive and seamless experience for all guests for all events including those with sensory needs.\n\nThe Bradley Symphony Center has wheelchair seating available on both levels. Bariatric chairs, with a width of 30” and capacity of 800 lbs., are available upon request. Many orchestra-level aisle seats are also equipped with swing-away end panels. Please call our Ticket Office at 414.291.7605 and inform a customer service representative of your needs.\n\nAllen-Bradley Hall is equipped with a tele-coil or T-coil Loop system. No additional assistive listening devices are required for patrons with compatible hearing aids or cochlear implants. If you do not have a compatible device, please pick up a loop receiver from the House Manager.\n\nAllen-Bradley Hall is also equipped with an infrared listening system. Headsets are available from the House Manager.\n\nAssistive listening devices are offered free of charge, but a driver's license or valid ID is required as security.\n\nThe Milwaukee Symphony offers Braille and Large Print program books for all performances. Please inquire with an usher when you arrive at the venue.\n\nSensory bags and weighted lap pads are available for checkout (at no cost by leaving an ID) at our Coat Check Room located in the Gallery of the Pavilion. Noise canceling headphones can also be checked out individually.\n\nWhat can I bring into the Hall during the concert?\n\nOnly beverages with lids are permitted inside Allen-Bradley Hall during performances. MSO souvenir cups are available for purchase at the Bradley Symphony Center to reuse throughout the season. Cough drops are also permitted, but we ask that you open the wrappers prior to or during a break in the music.\n\nWe encourage that strong fragrances be left at home, as fellow concertgoers may be sensitive or allergic.\n\nWhere can I find parking information for all MSO performances?\n\nParking information can be found at mso.org/parking for various Milwaukee-area venues we perform at throughout our season. Click here to watch an instructional video for how to park at The Avenue Parking Garage.\n\nWhat is the weather policy for schools programs and student performances?\n\nSchool programs and student performances will be cancelled due to weather upon the closing of a majority of the surrounding school districts. Schools will be notified by a member of the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra’s Education staff in advance of the scheduled program. Every effort will be made to reschedule performances for schools missing a program due to weather.\n\nWhat security measures are in place at your performance venues?\n\nThe Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra performs at the Bradley Symphony Center. Our venue has detailed security and bag policies that are strictly enforced. Use of cameras or recording devices is strictly prohibited at all MSO events. Smoking and eating are also not permitted. We also ask that you turn off cell phones, beepers, alarm watches, and anything else that might go “beep” during the concert. MSO venues are smoke-free environments - smoking is only permitted outside."
