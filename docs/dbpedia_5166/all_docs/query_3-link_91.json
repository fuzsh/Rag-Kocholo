        "text": "Fully digital program pages at FloridaOrchestra.org replace the printed program book with a wealth of resources: audio program notes for Masterworks, videos, repertoire and sample music, full bios of guest artists, musicians and conductors, venue information and maps, resources about the orchestra, and much more. These can be accessed from FloridaOrchestra.org anytime or with a QR code at the concert hall. Printable versions of the repertoire and program notes are available online.\n\nOne of the many benefits: zero trash. Scarcity and the increasing cost of paper are also significant factors. As a responsible non-profit, our goal is to put our resources behind the music and the musicians, not paper, whenever possible.\n\nIf you need to exchange your tickets, please do so no later than 48 hours before any concert presented solely by TFO. A change in price level may incur additional charges. Here are your options:\n\nVirtual Ticket Center: Now you can make ticket exchange requests, donate your tickets, see your upcoming concerts and more through our easy-to-use Virtual Ticket Center. Click here for more information.\n\nEmail: Email a copy of the voided tickets with your request to ticketcenter@floridaorchestra.org.\n\nMail: If there are more than 10 days until the concert you are exchanging, you can mail your tickets with your request to 244 2nd Ave N. Suite 420, St. Petersburg, FL 33701.\n\nHow can I donate my tickets?\n\nIf you canâ€™t use your tickets and want to donate them back to the orchestra, simply follow one of the options above to return your tickets. You will receive a tax deductible donation letter.\n\nAny exchanged tickets put on account must be used by the end of the season. Any unused money on account will revert back to TFO as a tax deductible donation.\n\nHow can you contact us?\n\nIn-person: The Ticket Center is open for in-person transactions Monday through Friday, 9 am to 5 pm\n\nPhone: 727.892.3337 Mon-Fri 9 am-5 pm; Saturday 10 am-2 pm\n\nEmail: ticketcenter@floridaorchestra.org\n\nMail: 244 2nd Ave N. Suite 420, St. Petersburg, FL 33701"
