        "text": "The Max? The Cube? Sosnick Courtyard? What is all this?\n\nGreat question. The Max is our name for the Max M. and Marjorie S. Fisher Music Center, the cultural campus that serves as the DSO’s home in Midtown Detroit. (Not to be confused with the Broadway-presenting Fisher Theater in Detroit’s New Center neighborhood.)\n\nThe Max includes historic Orchestra Hall, where most DSO performances take place. It also includes The Cube (the Peter D. and Julie F. Cummings Cube, to be exact), a black box theater-style venue for curated, urban, boundless experiences.\n\nHundreds of musicians who participate in our Civic Youth Ensembles also call The Max home (in the Jacob Bernard Pincus Music Education Center).\n\nThe Max also includes the Paradise Lounge (a cool spot for pre-concert food and drinks), the Oval Lobby (the historic, wood-clad entrance to Orchestra Hall), the Herman and Sharon Frankel Donor Lounge, the William Davidson Atrium, and more. It’s a lot—if you’re ever confused about where to go (or where you already are), just ask an usher or DSO staff member for assistance.\n\nJust outside of the DSO off of , Sosnick Courtyard is our outdoor venue perfect for enjoying a variety of artists ranging from classical to funk to jazz on warm summer evenings. The Sosnick Courtyard allows guests to enjoy first-come-first-served seating with bring-your-own chairs and blankets welcome. It also features an outdoor bar and is a social distancing-friendly option to enjoy live music.\n\nChoosing a Seat\n\nOrchestra Hall\n\nThere are three main levels in Orchestra Hall: the floor (including sections Main Floor A and Main Floor B), the Box Level, and the balcony (including the Dress Circle, Mid Balcony, and Upper Balcony sections).\n\nWhen we say there are no bad seats in the house, we mean it. That said, different areas of the hall provide different experiences. For example, if you’re looking to see a soloist up close, look for seats on the floor. If you want to see each section of the orchestra and how they share the stage, try an upper level.\n\nThe Cube\n\nOne reason we love The Cube so much is that it offers very flexible seating. For shows with lots of movement and dancing we tend to keep the floor wide open; for film screenings and other “eyes up front” events we can pull tiered auditorium-style seating out from the wall.\n\nMost performances in The Cube have a general admission ticket option and a VIP reserved seating option.\n\nSosnick Courtyard\n\noutdoor event venue, Sosnick Courtyard, is the perfect location to enjoy the bliss of the warm summer air and the sense of community that comes from attending live, outdoor performances. Sosnick Courtyard offers an open, flexible venue with bring-your-own seating and VIP seating options, an outdoor bar, and community greenspace. Performances in Sosnick Courtyard include a wide variety of genres and guarantee a summer evening you won’t forget.\n\nOther Venues\n\nThe DSO regularly performs at venues outside of The Max, and each one is different – so your best bet is to contact us directly with questions.\n\nIf you have questions about seating at any venue, or if you’d like a recommendation, please don’t hesitate to contact the Box Office."
