        "text": "All students majoring in an orchestral instrument play an integral role in NEC’s orchestra program. As orchestra members, students are immersed in a season of rehearsals, concerts, and reading sessions each year, mirroring the professional orchestra experience.\n\nStudents participate in five to six public concerts throughout the season, with additional opportunities to perform in opera orchestras. The program emphasizes a wide-ranging repertoire, from Baroque classics to contemporary compositions, ensuring a comprehensive musical education. Additionally, students benefit from focused sectionals led by distinguished members of the Boston Symphony Orchestra and top local musicians. This experience fosters musical growth while providing students firsthand exposure to the excitement and challenge of professional orchestral life.\n\nNEC Philharmonia\n\nA showcase of musical excellence, the NEC Philharmonia primarily features NEC’s third- and fourth-year undergraduates and graduate students in a dynamic lineup of ten concerts each year. Additionally, the Philharmonia accompanies two opera productions, two New Music Ensemble concerts, and two Baroque Ensemble concerts annually. The ensemble thrives under the leadership of Hugh Wolff, the Stanford and Norma Jean Calderwood Director of Orchestras, and David Loebel, the Associate Director of Orchestras. An impressive roster of guest conductors joins the Philharmonia for performances each year, including recent luminaries such as Shiyeon Sung, Earl Lee ‘15 GD, Carlos Miguel Prieto, Mei-Ann Chen ‘95, ‘98 MM, Jeffrey Kahane, Xian Zhang, and Ludovic Morlot.\n\nLab Orchestra\n\nUnder the leadership of Director of Orchestras Hugh Wolff, students are paid to participate in NEC’s Lab Orchestra, which meets once a week for an immersive and enriching experience. The Lab Orchestra explores and interprets scores under the guidance of graduate students from NEC’s orchestral conducting program, offering invaluable hands-on practice. This unique opportunity provides a true-to-life professional environment for both aspiring conductors and orchestra members. The culmination of their hard work is showcased in a concert at the end of each semester, highlighting their growth and talent."
