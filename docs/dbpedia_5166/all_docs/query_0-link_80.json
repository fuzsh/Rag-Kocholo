        "text": "Ohio University Orchestras\n\nOhio University offers two orchestral ensembles which welcome participation by all Ohio University students. The Symphony Orchestra is devoted to the training of the outstanding instrumentalists in the performance of a wide range of styles in the orchestral repertoire. In addition to its own concert series, the Symphony Orchestra collaborates in performances with choral ensembles, Opera Theater, and the Performing Arts Series. Orchestra scholarships are available to highly qualified music majors and to a limited number of non-majors on the basis of an audition.\n\nThe Campus Orchestra is a string ensemble open to intermediate level students, community members, and Athens Community Music School young musicians and performs less demanding repertoire. Both orchestras collaborate in the annual Hallowpalooza music gala in late October, and both are open by audition to all Ohio University students.\n\nNon-music majors who wish to continue their participation in either orchestra should contact the director for information about how to join.\n\nAudition information and excerpts can be found for each Fall and Spring.\n\nFor additional information on orchestral performance opportunities, please contact:"
