        "text": "The National Repertory Orchestra provides life-changing experiences to aspiring professional musicians, preparing them to shape the future of classical music. We are a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization dedicated to education. Through diverse programming—including orchestral performances, education programs, and community engagement initiatives—the NRO nurtures connections and enriches lives through the transformative power of music.\n\nThe NRO is honored to reside in the beautiful and historic ski town of Breckenridge, Colorado, and proud to celebrate over 60 years educating the next generation of classical musicians with our prestigious, tuition-free program. At the acclaimed Summer Music Festival, 80 talented musicians are selected to perform more repertoire than any other festival of its kind. These orchestral performances showcase the culmination of the musicians’ training, while initiatives like local music scholarships and programs for youth extend the NRO’s dedication to education. During the Festival season, led by Music Director Michael Stern and joined by world-renowned guest conductors, the NRO performs as many as 18 concerts and over 85 free events in Summit County and throughout Colorado.\n\nThe NRO prepares and empowers its participants for professional careers and fosters a legacy of music leadership. Our alumni can be found in major orchestras around the world and have taken on influential roles throughout the classical music industry.\n\nMusic Director Michael Stern\n\nConductor Michael Stern has long been devoted to building and leading highly acclaimed orchestras known not only for their impeccable musicianship and creative programming, but also for collaborative, sustainable cultures that often include a vision of music as service to the community. He also is passionate about working with young musicians not only in music making, but also to incorporate the idea of “service” into their experiences.\n\nStern currently holds three Music Director positions: with the Kansas City Symphony, where he will be concluding his 19-year tenure at the end of the 2023-2024 season; with the National Repertory Orchestra, a summer music festival in Breckenridge, CO; and with the newly rebranded Orchestra Lumos (formerly the Stamford Symphony). Stern was recently named Artistic Advisor of the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra. And, following a 22-year tenure as founding Artistic Director of Iris Orchestra in Germantown, Tennessee, he now serves the newly reimagined Iris Collective as Artistic Advisor."
