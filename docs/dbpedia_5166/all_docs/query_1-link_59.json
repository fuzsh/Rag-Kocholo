John Greaves joins on bass, but no steady drummer is found until much later. FF: \"We spent more time playing as a trio without a drummer than we did with a drummer in that period. Frank Perry auditioned with us but wasn't interested in the job - he auditioned us, effectively. Ashley Brown was a jazz drummer who auditioned but didn't fit... Neither of them was ever Henry Cow's drummer. Sean Jenkins did join for a while, but he was in another band, the Elastic Band, and had to travel a long way to work with us, and since we didn't have any money, he kind of lost interest after a few months\".\n\nAutumn\n\n\"Trapezium\" Rock Ballet\n\nHomerton Dance\n\nShelter Benefit\n\n1970\n\nSeptember\n\nFrith, Hodgkinson and Greaves move into a house together.
