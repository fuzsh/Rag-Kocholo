        "text": "Memphis has a deep history with music, including the Memphis Symphony Orchestra (MSO). From early years and through several wars, there were iterations of a local symphony. However, MSO was officially established in 1953 under the baton of the esteemed Vincent de Frank as the Memphis Sinfionetta. We have now grown into a full-scale nonprofit organization, complete with staff, volunteers and 36 core musicians.\n\nToday, as the Mid-South’s resident professional orchestra, we employ 80+ musicians and arts professionals, and present Masterworks, Classic Accents and Pops subscription concerts, as well as multiple special concerts a year. We are the largest performing arts institution in the Memphis region, and the orchestra for a myriad of other arts organizations, including Opera Memphis and Ballet Memphis.\n\nJust as a symphony takes four movements to create a musical composition for a full orchestra, we could not create MSO without the movement of our history, musicians, leadership and community. We are forever grateful to those who came before us and built MSO into the incredible organization it is today. Their work has continued to the present as we provide even more musicians and community members an opportunity to benefit from performances, programming and outreach."
