We honor this body of work by holding ourselves to the highest artistic aspirations, bringing it to life in new and exciting ways. While we pay homage to the great masters, we also seek out new voices that speak to our contemporary landscape. As we perform, we engage the diverse international community of our city, bringing people together in harmonyâ€”including our youngest citizens, with extensive opportunities for youth and families to fall in love with music.\n\nVision\n\nTo be locally beloved, internationally recognized, and internally unified."
