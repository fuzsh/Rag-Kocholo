        "text": "The NC State Orchestras—Raleigh Civic Symphony and Raleigh Civic Chamber Orchestra—are open to both students and local musicians who play string, woodwind, brass and percussion instruments.\n\nThey each perform one world premiere composition on every concert in addition to both traditional and contemporary repertoire. Their concerts have been called “some of the most fascinating and inventive programs in the area” by IndyWeek.\n\nStudents in the orchestras have the opportunity to workshop new music by diverse composers and learn alongside experienced musicians.\n\nMy experience in the symphony has been very fun and fulfilling. I really enjoy being able to forget my stresses of the day and take a break every Monday night to work on beautiful music with some very talented people.\n\nHannah Maier\n\nInnovation and representation\n\nOur orchestra programs often leverage technology and innovation and highlight themes which address social, environmental or historical contexts to create immersive events. Repertoire and commissions frequently include voices which have been underrepresented in the concert hall, such as the US Premiere of Florence Price’s “Ethiopia’s Shadow in America”.\n\nRecent projects have included virtual reality experiences, multi-disciplinary collaborations, world premiere performances, and real-time, technology-enabled distance collaboration (the orchestras recently made their Broadway debut as part of NYC’s Kaufmann Music Storefronts series.)\n\nConcerts frequently celebrate vital issues of our time: Martin Luther King Jr.’s Rocky Mount, NC “I Have a Dream” speech, the 100th anniversary of women’s suffrage, the National Park System, the effect of humans on animals and the environment, and music exploring the hidden histories of NC psychiatric institutions (composed by Grammy-nominated Raleigh native Tift Merritt, below).\n\nRecent world premieres include works by composers Michael Thomas Foumai, Phil Kline, Allison Loggins-Hull, Tift Merritt, Jessica Meyer, Jeff Peterson, Rufus Reid, Jeff Scott, Liliya Ugay, Aleksandra Vrebalov and Paul Wiancko.\n\nFaculty\n\nFrequently asked questions"
