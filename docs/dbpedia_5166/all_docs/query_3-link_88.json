        "text": "Learn everything you need to know about hiring an orchestra for your event, featuring tips on budgeting, selecting the right orchestra size, and frequently asked questions.\n\nBy Sam Berry\n\nblog\n\nUpdated: 03rd July 2024\n\n\"No one can whistle a symphony. It takes a whole orchestra to play it.\" - Halford E. Luccock\n\nFrom grand concert halls to elaborate weddings, a live orchestra promises to create a unique musical experience at a wide range of events. Such a broad range of musicians, each adding their unique timbre to the musical pot, provides a rich texture of sound beyond that of any other musical act.\n\nIf you're hoping to create an unforgettable atmosphere at your event, trust us when we say hiring an orchestra is the ultimate statement. Exuding sophistication, grandeur and opulence, an orchestra is the perfect centrepiece for your special occasion.\n\nHiring an orchestra is simple, but you'll need to answer a few essential questions before doing so. With this in mind, we've created this easy-to-follow booking guide for hiring an orchestra.\n\nHow large is an orchestra?\n\nThe size of an orchestra varies from 10-40 musicians, also known as a chamber orchestra, to 80-100 musicians, also known as a symphony orchestra.\n\nTake a look at Stardust Orchestra performing 'Eternal Flame' as a perfect example of what a chamber orchestra sounds like.\n\nWhat size orchestra do I require for my event?\n\nTo find out the size of orchestra required for your event, you'll need to answer the following questions:\n\nHow big is your venue?\n\nHow many guests will be attending the event?\n\nWhat sort of music are you hoping to have performed?\n\nWhat kind of musical impact are you hoping to achieve?\n\nWhat is your budget?\n\nThe size of your venue and budget will determine how many musicians you can hire. Once you have this number, you can begin to understand the type of musical impact and song choice your orchestra can provide.\n\nFor example, playing 'Can't Help Falling In Love' as you walk down the aisle would work well with just strings, but the 'Concerning Hobbit' (and other film scores) would work better with a larger orchestra.\n\nHow much does it cost to hire an orchestra?\n\nA small chamber orchestra of 15 musicians is around £3000 - 6000, whereas a symphony orchestra of 50 players is between £15,000 - 25,000, depending on the calibre of orchestra booked.\n\nThe total quote will include more than just the musicians' fees, so please take a look at the basic breakdown of costs below:\n\nBetween £150-£300 per musician per hour\n\nOver £200 per hour for the conductor's expertise\n\nAdministrative fees (£1000-2000) encompassing music rental, larger instrument hire (grand piano, harp, etc.), rehearsal space, transport of equipment\n\nExtra charges for custom musical arrangements\n\nTravel expenses for the orchestra\n\nTechnical setup, including microphones and sound systems\n\nWhat type of events does an orchestra perform at?\n\nIn all honesty, the list is never-ending, and this is partially due to how versatile orchestras can be.\n\nFrom grand weddings to corporate award ceremonies and elaborate proposals to launch events, the musical experience an orchestra can provide is powerful and unforgettable.\n\nA symphony orchestra is commonly hired for a performance or concert, whether for a corporate or private event or a showcase. Hiring an orchestra for a recording session is also popular.\n\nA chamber orchestra is better suited to smaller events that still want the impact of an orchestra but don't have the space or budget for a more extensive lineup.\n\nWhat type of performance does an orchestra provide?\n\nAn orchestra can tailor its sound and performance style depending on the brief you provide them with. Please see some examples of the types of performances they offer below:\n\nBackground music - ideal for a drinks reception, private dinner or social event to create a musical backdrop without overpowering the occasion.\n\nConcert or headliner - perfect for putting on a spectacular show for a charity, corporate or private event to entertain guests for a sitdown show.\n\nBallroom dancing - for a memorable experience, an orchestra can provide music for guests to dance to, such as traditional waltzes or popular songs. A Bridgerton-style ballroom dance accompanied by a live orchestra performing classical takes on modern hits is a sure-fire winner!\n\nHow long does an orchestra take to set up?\n\nA chamber orchestra can take 45-60 minutes to set up, whereas a symphony orchestra will likely take 1-2 hours.\n\nA smaller group of musicians will require less time to tune up their instruments and will not necessarily require a PA system for their performance.\n\nMeanwhile, a larger orchestra may require a PA system to play through for a concert or ballroom dance. In this case, they'll require a more extended sound check to ensure everyone's levels are satisfactory before performing.\n\nHow much space does an orchestra require?\n\nAs a general rule of thumb, the recommended guideline for space is 1.5 square metres per musician.\n\nHowever, the instrumentation of your chosen orchestra will need to be considered, i.e. a grand piano is approximately 1.5m x 3m.\n\nBelow is an approximation of the space required for different types of orchestras:\n\n10-15 piece orchestra - 4 x 6m or 24 square metres\n\n30 -40 piece orchestra - 5 x 9m or 45 square metres\n\n70 - 80 piece orchestra - 12 x 12m or 144 square metres\n\nWhat equipment does an orchestra provide?\n\nMost orchestras will provide equipment, including instruments, music stands, and a PA system if required.\n\nHowever, it's worth assuming this may not always be the case, so here is a handy checklist to run past them before booking:\n\nHow many armless chairs do you require?\n\nDo you require music stands for each musician?\n\nDo you need a PA system? If so, will you provide one?\n\nDo you require power outlets? If so, how many?\n\nWill you arrange to hire and deliver larger instruments, such as a grand piano or harp?\n\nDo you require a conductor's podium?\n\nLuckily, you'll be able to direct these questions to your orchestral director or booking agent, who can help orchestrate (pun intended) the event for you.\n\nWhat type of music does an orchestra play?\n\nYou'll be surprised to learn classical musicians cover a wider range of popular songs than you imagine.\n\nFor example, string arrangements for Taylor Swift and Harry Styles' latest songs have become popular due to the popular Netflix show Bridgerton.\n\nAn eclectic range of scores are written for popular films and TV shows every year. Whether you're an anime fan and love studio Ghiblis' Spirited Away or Howl's Moving Castle, or perhaps a fan of fantasy and enjoy Game of Thrones and Westworld - all these spectacular scores can be brought to life at your event via an orchestra.\n\nA hugely popular score that's been requested more than a few times for a bridal entrance springs to mind. Yes, it's the Jurassic Park theme tune! Just take a listen to this epic score performed by the Zebrowski Music School Orchestra:\n\nAs you can see, the world is your musical oyster if you're considering hiring an orchestra.\n\nCan an orchestra perform a special song request?\n\nProviding the sheet music is available, then the orchestra should have no trouble performing a specific song request for you.\n\nThey may charge an admin fee for printing the scores out or if they are required to purchase the score.\n\nIf no score is available for your chosen song, they may be able to write an arrangement for you at an additional cost.\n\nDon't be afraid to think out of the box; take a look at this fantastic tribute to the popular video game The Legend of Zelda for Nintendo:\n\nHow long will the orchestra perform?\n\nTypically, an orchestra will not play for more than 3 hours in total, including breaks.\n\nFor a concert that extends beyond 45 minutes, it's common to include an intermission.\n\nIn settings such as ballrooms, where the orchestra provides background music, or during any extended performance, it's wise to allow a brief pause of 15-20 minutes roughly every 45 minutes.\n\nExtras to consider when hiring an orchestra:\n\nParking - the orchestra will require a parking space for a coach and possibly a few cars. However, public transport might be an option if the event is local to them, although some equipment will need transportation regardless.\n\nFood & Refreshments - the orchestra may request a meal for their musicians if they're expected to perform during the evening. For any daytime events, the orchestra may request food providing, like sandwiches or fruit, depending on the duration of their stay. Refreshments are always required regardless of how long they are on-site.\n\nDress & Attire - what the musicians wear on the day depends on the event they are playing at. A concert will typically see the musicians wearing black dresses and tuxedos. In contrast, a ballroom may include smart-casual wear or even fancy dress depending on the event's theme (Georgian dresses and suits for a Bridgeton-themed event).\n\nSet up & Soundcheck - depending on the orchestra size, you'll need to allow roughly 60 - 90 minutes for them to set up and tune their instruments.\n\nPA System - not all orchestras will provide this equipment, but you'll find most orchestras are loud enough that they don't necessarily need a PA system to be heard. Also, the venue may already have a built-in PA system that the orchestra can use, so it's worth communicating on both ends to ensure everything runs as expected.\n\nHow far in advance should I book an orchestra?\n\nDepending on availability, booking an orchestra at the last minute is possible. However, we advise booking well ahead of time since musicians often fill their schedules quickly, especially for peak season dates such as summer weekends or during the holiday periods.\n\nReady to hire an orchestra?\n\nWe hope our comprehensive guide for 2024 has armed you with insights, from understanding the costs involved to selecting the appropriate size orchestra for your venue and occasion.\n\nWhether it's a symphony orchestra to captivate your guests at a gala or a chamber group to add a touch of sophistication to your intimate gathering, the opportunity to hire such an illustrious act could transform your event into an unforgettable experience."
