        "text": "Symphony Center meets all CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) guidelines on fresh air intake and air circulation, with approximately 5-6 air changes per hour. Orchestra Hall's HVAC system uses a double-filter system: a MERV 8 pre-filter to remove large particles from the air, followed by a MERV 14a or 15 filter, the same used in hospitals, to remove finer particles.\n\nHigh-touch areas, including countertops, door handles and elevators, are cleaned and sanitized regularly.\n\nHand sanitizer stations are available throughout Symphony Center. Per CDC guidelines, people should wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.\n\nSymphony Center is a mask-friendly environment where everyone is expected to adhere to current venue requirements and respect one anotherâ€™s preferences.\n\nAll attendees are encouraged to self-screen for any illness symptoms before entering Symphony Center or attending a CSOA event. If you are not feeling well you should not attend and instead contact Patron Services for ticket options.\n\nIf you can no longer attend a performance, you may exchange or donate your tickets up to one hour before the concert using an online form or contacting Patron Services.\n\nExchange requests are subject to availability, and fees or upgrade costs may apply. For ticket donations, you will receive receive a receipt letter that can be used for tax purposes at the end of the calendar year."
