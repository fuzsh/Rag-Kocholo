        "text": "The UMD Repertoire Orchestra (UMRO) has rebranded to a new name: University Orchestra. Conducted by graduate students of the conducting studio, the University Orchestra is the all-campus orchestra here at UMD. It is comprised of students in non-music degree programs as diverse as engineering, math, journalism, English, computer science, physics and more, music minors, music majors in piano or composition, faculty and staff in non-music areas and affiliated community members.\n\nUniversity Orchestra rehearsals take place in the School of Music wing of The Clarice Smith Performing Arts Center, Room 1230, on Mondays and Wednesdays from 3:00-5:00 p.m. University Orchestra performs two concerts per semester in the Dekelboum Concert Hall, the 760-seat venue in The Clarice Smith Performing Arts Center.\n\nIf you have played in high school orchestra, a local youth orchestra or have taken private lessons on your instrument for several years, you are a perfect fit for University Orchestra! If you are just learning your instrument, the University Orchestra repertoire will likely be too challenging. The repertoire often focuses on the integration of symphonic masterworks with repertoire by women, BIPOC and LGBTQ+ composers.\n\nIf you are interested in joining the University Orchestra, please email UMRO@umd.edu.\n\nRepertoire From Past Seasons:\n\n2019\n\nOpera at the Symphony!\n\nMozart: Overture to The Magic Flute\n\nSmetana: \"Three Dances\" from The Bartered Bride\n\nBizet: Suites No. 1 and 2 from Carmen\n\nTheir Time Has Come: Music by Women Composers\n\nBoulanger: D’un soir triste\n\nChaminade: Flute Concertino\n\nPrice: Symphony No. 1 in E Minor\n\n2020\n\nSongs of War\n\nStill: In Memoriam “The Colored Soldiers Who Died for Democracy”\n\nTchaikovsky: 1812 Overture\n\nElgar: Cello Concerto\n\nBeethoven 5 (cancelled due to COVID-19)\n\nRossini: Overture to La Gazza Ladra\n\nDvořák: The Noonday Witch\n\nBeethoven: Symphony No. 5\n\nUMRO did not perform during the 2020-21 school year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n2021"
