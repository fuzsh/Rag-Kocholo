        "text": "History of Winchester Chamber Orchestra\n\nIn the beginning...\n\nThe orchestra was originally founded as an evening class in 1988 and was known as the \"Adult Education Orchestra\". Their first ever concert was performed in Itchen Abbas Village Hall in June 1989. There were 16 members then: 6 clarinets, 2 flutes, 2 'cellos, 1 french horn, 1 viola, 3 violins and 1 tenor sax! The programme for that first concert included \"French Comedy Overture\" (Bela), \"RAF March Past\" (Walford Davies), a waltz from \"Der Rosenkavalier\" (Strauss), plus a selection of other short pieces.\n\nPracticing for the first concert in 1989\n\nBusking during a late night shopping evening leading up to Christmas.\n\nIn September 1991 Hampshire County Council withdrew funding for non-vocational courses and so the members decided set up their own orchestra, paying a subscription to keep it going. The orchestra's name changed to \"Winchester Amateur Chamber Orchestra\" and had grown to 30 members.\n\n\"Winchester Amateur Chamber Orchestra\" with conductor Peter Parfitt."
