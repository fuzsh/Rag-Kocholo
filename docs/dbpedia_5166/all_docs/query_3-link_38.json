We recommend arriving no later than 30 minutes prior to concert start time.\n\nYou may find directions and parking information for all concert locations at this link: View Directions & Parking\n\nAbsolutely. The safety of our patrons is of the utmost importance to us. If you would like a security escort to your car, simply notify any usher or our front of house manager, and we will happily arrange this for you.\n\nThe Patron Services Center is open Monday through Saturday, from 12 noon to 6 p.m., at its location in the courtyard of Jones Hall or by phone at 713.224.7575.\n\nWe recommend patrons elect to have their tickets electronically delivered via email.

Alternatively, tickets purchased in advance of a performance can be mailed.\n\nStreet-level entrances provide access to the main lobby from Louisiana Street and the side entrance on Texas Avenue. The courtyard entrance is accessible through the tunnel from the Theater District Parking Garage.\n\nRestrooms are located throughout Jones Hall, on the courtyard, mezzanine, and balcony levels. If you need help finding the nearest restroom, just ask an usher!\n\nCONCERT ETIQUETTE, SEATING AND SOCIAL MEDIA\n\nWe want your concert experience to be as relaxing and enjoyable as possible. You will see patrons in formal attire, business casual, and everything in between.\n\nUnfortunately, we do not allow cameras or any audio or recording devices during a performance. Photography, cameras or any audio or visual recordings of performances is strictly prohibited.\n\nThough we encourage the use of social media before or after a performance, patrons may not use their phones during a performance.\n\nEach performance typically allows for late seating, which is scheduled in intervals and determined by the conductor. Our ushers and front of house staff will instruct you on when late seating is allowed.\n\nFood is not permitted inside the auditorium. Patrons may bring drinks into the auditorium for POPS Series concerts. Drinks are not permitted inside the auditorium for Classical concerts.\n\nThe Encore Café and in-hall bars are open for Symphony performances, and food and drink will be permitted in bar areas.

Children of all ages are welcome at Family Series performances. Children must have a ticket for all ticketed events.\n\nFor Classical Series performances, holding applause between movements is considered respectful of the performers’ concentration and mindful of musical continuity. The conductor generally signals when a piece is over by putting his or her arms down and turning to the audience.\n\nUnfortunately, we are unable to accommodate requests for autographs. However, patrons are allowed to wait outside at the stage door on Texas Ave.\n\nTHE PATRON EXPERIENCE\n\nPrelude is currently presented live in hall.\n\nIn-hall Prelude: Pre-concert discussions are held in Jones Hall prior to each Classical Series concert on Friday and Saturdays at 7:15 p.m., and Sundays at 1:45 p.m.\n\nPrelude sometimes features guest artists and members of the orchestra.\n\nCurrently there are no performance recordings available for purchase at the Houston Symphony.
