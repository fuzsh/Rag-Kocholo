        "text": "These are great questions. BIG questions, but great nonetheless.\n\nHow so works get performed?\n\nThere is an old composition adage: first you write for yourself, then you write for your friends, then you write for others. This basically sums it up. If your friends trust you and you do a good job, they'll keep playing your stuff. If you're lucky enough, people who aren't your friends might notice and want to play your stuff too.\n\nOrchestras, because of their size, are always a bit of a luxury in terms of performance. Many orchestras hold composition competitions in which they'll premiere and record a winning work. Other orchestras hold workshops / intensives where they do the same thing.\n\nA lot of composers do what's called \"cold-calling\" with directors, sending them a score with a recording or a note. Most directors don't like this. ALL directors have a stack of about 2-3ft of scores they've been sent. When they feel nice, they'll pick one out at random and take a look. Sometimes it can take 10 years before they get to your piece, and even then they might not like it.\n\nIf a conductor really likes you, they'll come to you for projects. It's much, much easier if they're your friends.\n\nSoloists are a little different. Depending on the level of the soloist, they might be really flattered that you sent them music. After all, it helps you both out. Just like writing music, projects come about all different ways. For example, I was a guest composer at a festival, and a horn soloist liked one of my pieces so much, he commissioned me right there for a piece for the following season. I didn't know him at all then, but now he's a colleague and friend. Again, all this stuff is easier if you're working with your friends.\n\nPublishing\n\nAlso a big topic here. I will scratch the surface like I did with the other question. Some composers work exclusively for publishers. These are mostly the \"educational\" composers that feed kids' brains. Band. Chorus. Etc. Many more composers are self-publishing now or are published through boutique publishing houses representing a small number of composers (10-30 usually). It is not hard to self-publish, but there's a big trade between how much you own versus how you're marketed.\n\nA final thought related to this subject as I've seen it pop up in other answers and I know my posts can have a long reach:\n\nNetworking is bullshit. I'll say it again: Networking is bullshit. You either have friends and people you care about or you don't. Plain and simple. Otherwise, you're just using people, and if you think they can't sense that a mile away, you're silly and they'll never work with you, or worse, they'll work with you once and be done forever.\n\nYou'll just come across as being fake and disingenuous. Just find people who dig you and the stuff you do. Find people who you dig and the stuff they do, and make stuff together. Whatever \"success\" happens from that is just gravy.\n\nGood luck.\n\nI can only answer the first question, as nothing of mine has ever been published in spite of winning a first prize and an honorable mention in a prestigious contest.\n\nThe way I get my work performed (and I know a lot of other composers use the same approach) is to make friends with an established conductor or assistant conductor, do him or her a lot of favors connected to the orchestra (NOT favors for the conductor personally), and when he or she eventually gets around to asking about my music, say, \"Well I have this piece I wrote that I'd love to hear.\" The conductor will usually schedule it for a run-through at a rehearsal. If the conductor likes it and the consensus among the musicians is that they wouldn't mind performing it, it gets played at a concert. Other musicians in the geographical area spread the word and some other conductor approaches me, etc., etc. I don't have the kind of reputation that has people from timbuktu coming after me, but it works at a low level.\n\nSame with soloists, most of whom I meet through the conductors. Though one of my soloists is my Voice Teacher!\n\nIn other words, Networking. Just like you would to get a job. (Which is what you're doing. Sort of.)"
