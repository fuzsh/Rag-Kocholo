        "text": "Orchestras have been around for hundreds of years and we’re just the latest in a group of musicians who are engaging in this art form. We bring that art to life, not only in rehearsal, but also in performance, using compositions that were created anywhere from several hundred years ago to just a few months ago, by some of the finest composers in the world. Our symphony orchestras include almost every single traditional instrument you would find in an orchestra or a band program at school, or in private instruction. There are opportunities in this group of symphony orchestras for hundreds of students. It’s fun to play in a large orchestra with other students, rehearse regularly, and achieve greater results together. Over the years, our students grow together and friendships develop that can last a lifetime."
