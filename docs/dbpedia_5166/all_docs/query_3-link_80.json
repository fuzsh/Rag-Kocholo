        "text": "Spotlight | Principal Trumpet, James B. and Annabel Nutter Chair\n\nJulian Kaplan\n\nOriginally from Cleveland, Ohio, Julian Kaplan and his family moved to North Carolina, where he began playing trumpet at age 12. He soon began studying with the principal trumpet of the Charlotte Symphony, Michael Miller, who now plays in the Cleveland Orchestra. Kaplan received a full-tuition scholarship to the University of Kentucky, where he earned his bachelorâ€™s degree in trumpet performance and studied with Mark Clodfelter. He also was a student of Vince DiMartino at Centre College. While at the University of Kentucky, Kaplan performed at some of the most famous venues, including the Kennedy Center and Carnegie Hall, and performed concerts in Greece and China. Shortly before graduation, Kaplan was appointed principal trumpet of the Lexington Philharmonic, where he played for two seasons, before being appointed second trumpet of the Jacksonville Symphony Orchestra. After two seasons as second trumpet, Kaplan was appointed principal trumpet of the Jacksonville Symphony Orchestra in 2013. Julian also served on faculty at the University of North Florida from 2014-2015. Kaplan has been a guest principal trumpet with the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, St. Louis Symphony and Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, among others, and has appeared as a soloist with the Kansas City Symphony many times during his tenure so far. Outside of trumpet, Julian enjoys playing competitive video games, and spending time with his two Huskies, Winston and Wattson."
