        "text": "This can be a controversial question, and here’s why: in the early days of classical music, the audience was rather rowdy—clapping, talking, and even shouting during the performance. Then, at some point during the 20th century, this changed, and the social norm became to applaud only at the end of the piece and not in between movements (in other words, clap at the end of Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony and stay silent during the breaks between movements 1, 2, 3 and 4). While this may be the current tradition, if you feel particularly moved after a certain soloist performance or movement and would like to show your appreciation and clap between movements go ahead! You may be the only one, but don’t hold in a natural emotional response on our account.\n\nIf you still feel unsure of what to do, watch the conductor and the musicians, their body language is a great help, or simply clap when everyone else does.\n\nWhat’s a subscriber?\n\nSubscribers, or season ticket holders, are patrons who commit to purchasing a series of concerts over the entire season. Our different packages are designed with every type of patron in mind: some prefer to keep the same seats year after year, others prefer a more flexible compose-your-own series option. No matter the package there is an array of benefits to be had including:\n\nSavings – Subscribing automatically saves you money over the general single ticket prices. In fact, you can save 10% and more on individual ticket prices by becoming a subscriber, and you can even add on additional tickets for friends and family when you need it. The savings continue on those tickets, too!\n\nExchange flexibility – Always on the go? Afraid of that next big ice storm? We offer subscribers the most flexible exchange policy in town. Subscribers can exchange tickets prior to the concert date with no additional fees, so you never have to miss a concert.\n\nPackage flexibility – Whether you prefer the keep the same seats all season, or are looking for a more flexible option that allows you to create your own season, we have options for everyone! A subscription series package includes all the concerts in a given series and your very own subscription seat, while a compose-your-own package allows you to pick dates, times, and concert offerings that best fit your schedule and tastes!\n\nAdvance Access – Only subscribers can purchase single tickets in advance, months before PortTIX opens them up to the general public."
