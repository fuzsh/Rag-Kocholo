        "text": "University Symphony Orchestra\n\n(MU 302)\n\nOur Symphony Orchestra serves as a model for the 21st-century orchestra and is CSU's premier orchestral ensemble. We strive to celebrate the talents of our diverse student body, including music majors, minors, and non-majors. We offer a variety of performance experiences, including opera, dance, theatre, Colorado All-State, and other interdisciplinary collaborations. Our programs explore and expand the existent canon with new music and music by historically under-programmed composers. Recent performances include Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov's Scheherazade, Piotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 5, Jerod Tate's Ghost of the White Deer bassoon concerto with Cayla Bellamy, and Englebert Humperdinck's Hansel and Gretel.\n\nAuditions for all instruments are held at the beginning of the fall semester. Winds, brass, and percussion must reaudition in the spring. String players who participate in symphony in the fall are not currently required to re-audition for the spring; however, new string players are welcome to audition at the start of the spring semester."
