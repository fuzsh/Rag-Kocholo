        "text": "BRAND NEW RECORDINGS AND\n\nREIMAGINED ORIGINAL CONTENT\n\nBrand new recordings include a new 18 violin string section for Hollywood Strings, new ensembles for Hollywood Brass and Hollywood Orchestral Woodwinds, plus new string, brass, and wind multi ensembles. \"The new 18 violins are an alternate to the first 16 violins of the original library. They have a different sound,\" says producer Nick Phoenix, \"the players are different. The vibrato is different. The legato is the best we have ever recorded. They work well with the existing collection or as a replacement for the original 1st violins. The new 2 tenor trombones have a completely different sound from the 3 trombones in the original collection. The new trombones are warm, full, and extremely precise. 2 trumpets were recorded again using two of the best players in the Hollywood film score scene. The legato is blazing at high velocities and sounds like a live performance.\"\n\nThe programming of the original content from Hollywood Orchestra has been updated to take advantage of the features included in the new Opus software engine, as well as the Hollywood Solo Instrument Series (now included in this expansion). Particular focus was placed on Hollywood Orchestral Woodwinds. After improving the original woodwinds, new ensembles were recorded, including 3 bassoons, 3 clarinets, and 3 flutes. \"Once again, this was a huge success because of the quality of the players,\" says Phoenix, \"Each woodwind ensemble works together on a regular basis and the tuning and timing are immaculate. These new recordings are unmatched in the virtual instruments world. The Opus Edition also includes new string, brass and wind multi ensembles that have a unique fat sound that captures the tuning of a large orchestra playing together in a live setting.\"\n\nPOWERFUL\n\nNEW CONTROLS\n\nPowerful new controls include Master key-switches where all articulations can be fully customized in the new OPUS articulation palette. You can customize the sound of each instrument using the new MOODS feature. Classic Mood is the original Hollywood Orchestra sound. Soft modifies the sound for slower, more emotional passages. Epic Mood does the opposite, giving you a sound perfectly suited for your next Action Adventure score. Each mood changes the settings and look of the interface, which has been completely redesigned and stylized for Hollywood Strings, Hollywood Orchestral Woodwinds, Hollywood Percussion, Hollywood Solo Violin, Hollywood Solo Cello, and Hollywood Harp. In addition, we simplified all instrument versions down to LITE and MAX, making Hollywood Strings in particular much easier to navigate.\n\nOUR REVOLUTIONARY\n\nNEW OPUS SOFTWARE ENGINE\n\nOur brand new OPUS software engine replaces PLAY after 5 years of development. “Many improvements were made to the PLAY software engine over the last decade but we suddenly had a unique opportunity,” says producer Doug Rogers, “we were able to bring Wolfgang Kundrus in as head of software development. He was the mastermind behind the creation of Cubase, Nuendo, and Studio One. Then we were able to bring in Wolfgang Schneider, the creator of Kontakt. With these two titans of music software development now on our team, we decided it was time to develop a brand new software engine from the ground up.\n\nThe OPUS software engine is the realization of this effort. Not only is it faster, more powerful, more flexible, and better looking than PLAY, it comes with incredible new features such as individual instrument auditioning and downloads, customized key-switches, dozens of new MIDI Tools and mixer effect, scalable retina GUI upgrades for legacy products, a powerful new script language, and many more features that allow you to completely customize the sound of each instrument. It’s one of the most exciting developments in the history of the company and will be the launching pad for many exciting new products in the future”\n\nALSO INCLUDES\n\nHOLLYWOOD ORCHESTRATOR\n\nCreate full-scale orchestral music with complex arrangements by playing a few simple chords with one hand and shaping expression with the other. Developed in collaboration with Sonuscore, Hollywood Orchestrator uses all the instruments in Hollywood Orchestra Opus Edition to create real-time arrangements based on your MIDI input with our Innovative Scoring Engine.\n\nCOMPOSE A BLOCKBUSTER\n\nSOUNDTRACK IN SECONDS\n\nWith over 500 customizable presets, you can instantly create music in the style of Hollywood's greatest composers. Select from Ensemble presets to quickly create rich orchestral arrangements. With Ostinato presets, you can build rhythmic tension in different meters or create moving melodic lines by only changing a few notes. With Score, classic Hollywood orchestrations become an endless source of inspiration. Create your own User presets by modifying existing presets or build your own ensembles from scratch!\n\nOUR INNOVATIVE\n\nSCORING ENGINE\n\nAt the heart of Hollywood Orchestrator is our innovative Scoring Engine, which produces everything from basic string arrangements to very complex orchestrations played by the full orchestra. This is where you can create new presets or alter any existing preset by changing the melodic pattern in each step sequencer or by completely switching the instruments and voicings of that preset.\n\nIn the Mixer section, refine the final output of each instrument by adjusting the volume, pan, equalization, reverb preset, reverb send amounts, and other reverb controls like pre-delay, length, and filters.\n\nHollywood Orchestrator is the perfect tool both for new composers who want to get that magical Hollywood sound quickly and effortlessly, and for professional composers who need to produce large amounts of compositions on a deadline. Please note: Hollywood Orchestrator requires Hollywood Orchestra Opus Edition, it is not a standalone product, and is not compatible with the original Hollywood Orchestra or Hollywood Solo Instruments which are now included in the Opus Edition along with the newly recorded instruments."
