        "text": "Participation in the Brown University Orchestra is open to all members of the Brown community: undergraduate and graduate students, faculty, and staff. Members of the RISD community are also eligible to participate. Musicians from the local community are welcome to audition and may be invited to join if openings exist.\n\nEach fall, all musicians interested in joining the orchestra are required to audition, including returning members. Individuals who are abroad or away during the fall should audition at the start of the spring semester.\n\nThe audition will take approximately 10 minutes and consist of the following parts (no sight reading or scales will be required):\n\nA two-minute excerpt of a work of your choice. This piece should display your best playing, and demonstrate your technical and expressive capabilities. You may bring a second contrasting selection, but it is not required and might not be requested because of time constraints.\n\nOrchestral excerpts drawn from the season’s repertoire (one or two excerpts, depending on the instrument). Orchestra audition info available via this Google Doc.\n\nAnyone who plays a secondary instrument, like piccolo, English horn, bass clarinet, etc., is encouraged to bring it to the audition and prepare the associated excerpt, if possible. If you plan to audition on more than one instrument and think you will need more than 10 minutes, sign up for two audition times (preferably back-to-back).\n\nRosters and seating assignments will be announced once all auditions have been completed. Rotating seating is used in the string sections, with new assignments for each concert. Principal string players are selected from the pool of principals determined by the auditions. Seating in the rest of the orchestra rotates to varying degrees according to each section. No distinction is made between music and non-music concentrators when determining seating; our philosophy is to judge chair placement based on the fall audition and subsequent performance in rehearsals and concerts.\n\nFor Prospective Members\n\nIncoming students are encouraged to visit the Orchestra Open House (held every September in Alumnae Hall), where they can meet conductor Mark Seto as well as upperclassmen in the orchestra. Please audition! We accept large numbers of new members every year, and chair placement is not determined by class year. First-year students have the same shot as everyone else who auditions. Although orchestra is a time commitment, students taking the most difficult course loads at Brown still find the time to perform.\n\nMusic for an audition can be obtained at Orwig Music Library, located on the south side of campus next to Perkins Hall. Instruments to use or practice on for an orchestra audition (especially large instruments such as the marimba, harp, tuba, etc.) can be arranged by emailing the conductor, Mark Seto. If you have any questions or concerns about auditions, don’t hesitate to contact him.\n\nCourse Information\n\nA practical study of the orchestral repertoire from Bach to the present, offered through rehearsals and performances. Enrollment is by audition and written permission. Restricted to skilled instrumentalists. May be repeated once for credit. Written permission required. S/NC.\n\nGuidelines for Participation\n\nAll prospective and returning members are required to audition each September. To get an audition time, go to the Music Department homepage and click on the appropriate link for audition sign-ups.\n\nOnce auditions have been completed, the roster of Brown University Orchestra will be announced by the date of the first rehearsal. If selected as a member of the orchestra, you should register for MUSC 0610. Registration for MUSC 0610/0611 is not required for membership in the orchestra, but is strongly encouraged. The Music Department staff in Orwig 101 will have a copy of the roster and be able to sign your permission slip.\n\nOne half-credit will be awarded for each semester of participation in the Brown University Orchestra with registration for MUSC 0610 or 0611. Students who do not register for credit are encouraged to register as an Audit.\n\nRules of the Course\n\nAttend all rehearsals, which take place Tuesday and Thursday evenings from 7:15-9:45 p.m. Come 30 minutes prior to the beginning of rehearse to assist with the set-up and help strike the equipment at the end of each rehearsal. Most rehearsals take place in Alumnae Hall; most dress rehearsals and performances are in Sayles Hall.\n\nPractice your music diligently in order to come to rehearsals as prepared as possible, and strive to achieve the highest level of music-making of which you and the orchestra are capable.\n\nParticipate in all concerts.\n\nNotify the personnel manager and conductor as early as possible in advance if unable to attend a rehearsal, or part of a rehearsal.\n\nGrades for MUSC 0610 and 0611 (S/NC only) are based on musical achievement, personal effort and attendance.\n\nProcedures\n\nEach member of the orchestra will be given a folder and music for each piece in which they have a part to play.\n\nRehearsal schedules are sent out by email prior to each rehearsal.\n\nSeatings are determined by the September audition and subsequent achievement in rehearsals and concerts. Rotating seating is used in the string sections, with new seatings for each concert. Principal string players are selected from the pool of principals determined by the auditions. Seating in the rest of the orchestra rotates to varying degrees according to each section.\n\nString principals will meet with the conductor to determine bowings for each concert and are responsible for making sure that bowings are distributed to all members of their sections.\n\nMusic is returned by leaving all parts on your stand following the final performance of each program. Folders are returned at the end of the year following the final concert.\n\nSectional rehearsals are held periodically throughout the year.\n\nScores and recordings of most works played by the orchestra are placed on reserve for MUSC0610/611 in the Orwig Music Library. All members of the orchestra are strongly encouraged to use these materials in order to learn the music as thoroughly as possible.\n\nDigital recordings are made of all Brown University Orchestra concerts and are available for downloading shortly after each concert take place.\n\nThe Conductor\n\nMark Seto\n\nMark Seto leads a wide-ranging musical life as a conductor, musicologist, teacher, and violinist. In addition to his duties as Director of the Brown University Orchestra, he is the Artistic Director and Conductor of The Chelsea Symphony in New York City.\n\nAt Connecticut College, Seto directed the faculty ensemble and the Connecticut College Orchestra, and taught music history, theory, conducting, and orchestration. During Seto’s tenure at Connecticut, he helped double student enrollment in the orchestra. Furthermore, the ensemble assumed a greater role in the College’s cultural and intellectual life. Seto aimed to connect the learning he and his ensembles undertook in rehearsal to themes that resonate with them as engaged global and local citizens. For example, Seto programmed Tchaikovsky’s “Little Russian” Symphony and used the opportunity to convene a discussion about Russian-Ukrainian relations with Connecticut College’s Slavic Studies Department; and he served as music director for a staged production of Rodgers and Hammerstein’s Carousel, partnering with the New London organization Safe Futures to offer programming about domestic violence.\n\nSince Seto’s tenure with The Chelsea Symphony began in 2011, the ensemble has programmed more than three dozen world premieres and has had debut performances at David Geffen Hall, Alice Tully Hall, the DiMenna Center for Classical Music, Merkin Concert Hall, and Symphony Space. Under his leadership, the orchestra launched an annual composition contest for early-career composers in partnership with Gerard Schwarz, Conductor Laureate of the Seattle Symphony and Music Director of the All-Star Orchestra; and established an outreach program to bring music to Rikers Island Correctional Facility. Seto’s recent engagements with The Chelsea Symphony include a popup performance in Times Square to promote the BBC America series Blue Planet 2, and an Earth Day collaboration at the American Museum of Natural History featuring Become Ocean, the Pulitzer Prize-winning work by John Luther Adams.\n\nSeto’s research as a musicologist explores issues of influence, nationalism, and cultural identity in fin-de-siècle Paris. Seto’s articles and reviews have been published in 19th-Century Music (University of California Press), Nineteenth-Century Choral Music (Routledge, 2013), Nineteenth-Century Music Review (Cambridge University Press), Current Musicology, and Nineteenth-Century French Studies. Working from manuscript sources in Paris, Seto prepared performance materials and conducted the western hemisphere premiere of La Nuit et l’amour by Augusta Holmès, one of the most significant women composers of the French Third Republic.\n\nSeto was the founding music director of Morningside Opera in New York City, a company acclaimed by The New York Times for its “bold imagination and musical diligence.” In 2009, he conducted the western hemisphere premiere of J.A. Hasse’s Alcide al bivio in a production praised by Opera News as a “lively, well calibrated performance.” He has also served as Assistant Conductor of the New York Youth Symphony, Yale Symphony Orchestra, and Columbia University Orchestra.\n\nMark Seto studied at the Pierre Monteux School for Conductors in Maine, where he served as an assistant to music director Michael Jinbo for two seasons. His conducting teachers include Lawrence Leighton Smith and Shinik Hahm, and he has participated in workshops with Kenneth Kiesler, Daniel Lewis, Donald Portnoy, Donald Thulean, and Paul Vermel. He was the 2003 recipient of the Yale Friends of Music Prize and has been honored with an ASCAP Morton Gould award.\n\nGuests of the Orchestra\n\nGuest conductors and composers are brought in every academic year to enrich the orchestra's perspective and exposure to living musicians. Past guest performers have included, Joseph Kalichstein, Christopher O'Riley, Itzhak Perlman, Navah Perlman '92, Mstislav Rostropovich, Isaac Stern, Eugenia Zukerman, Pinchas Zukerman, and most recently pianist Jeffrey Biegel (at Carnegie Hall). Guest Conductors have included Dr. Walter Damrosch (orchestra conductor of the New York Symphony Orchestra) in 1891, in Daniel Barenboim in 2006 during his residency with the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra, and a surprise run through of Mahler's First Symphony in 2014 with David Harrington, leader and founder of the Kronos Quartet following a panel with the quartet. Composers-in-residence hosted by the Brown Orchestra include Samuel Adler, Peter Boyer, Lukas Foss, Steve Reich, Joseph Schwantner, Steven Stucky, Michael Torke, Nico Muhly, Bill Harley, and most recently Philip Glass in February of 2015.\n\nHistory of the Orchestra\n\nPaul Phillips, a former pupil of Leonard Bernstein, became musical director and conductor of the Brown University Orchestra in the Fall of 1989. He helped put Brown's name on the musical map on a global scale. In December 2006, the Brown Orchestra became one of the first US collegiate orchestras to tour China, performing a two-week New Year’s concert tour of Beijing, Shanghai, Dalian, Suzhou, Changzhou and Ningbo produced by the Dalian Yilong Performance Company. The Brown Orchestra also completed a 10 day tour of Ireland, including performances with the Limerick Choral Union and a performance in the famous Wexford Opera Hall. A documentary about this trip can be found in the media section of this website, located here.\n\nItzhak Perlman, Navah Perlman ’92, Pinchas Zukerman, Eugenia Zukerman, Isaac Stern, Sergiu Luca, Mstislav Rostropovich, Laurence Lesser, Masuko Ushioda and Joseph Kalichstein are among the many renowned musicians who have appeared as soloists with the Brown University Orchestra during this period in its history. Actors Barry Bostwick and Brown alumna Kate Burton ’79 performed Peter Boyer's multimedia composition Ellis Island: The Dream of America with the orchestra in 2004 at Veterans Memorial Auditorium in Providence. Composers-in-residence hosted by the Brown Orchestra include Steve Reich, Steven Stucky, Michael Torke, Lukas Foss and Samuel Adler. Notable events in the orchestra’s history include trips to New York for concerts in Carnegie Hall and Avery Fisher Hall and to Montreal for a concert and recording sessions with choruses from McGill University; a 2006 concert in Boston’s Faneuil Hall; and concert exchanges and collaborations with orchestras and choruses from MIT, Tufts and Wellesley.\n\nThe Brown University Orchestra, a member of the American Symphony Orchestra League, has won the prestigious ASCAP Award for \"Adventurous Programming of Contemporary Music\" seven times since 1994, including 1st Prize in 2005 in the Collegiate Orchestra Division. The BUO sponsors orchestra retreats (usually held at Brown’s Haffenreffer Grant in Bristol, RI, or at Camp Canonicus in Exeter, RI) and its annual Concerto Competition, whose winners perform full concertos with the orchestra. In addition to student soloists, numerous student conductors and composers have performed with (or had their works performed by) the Brown Orchestra. The Orchestra’s alumni include current and former members of the Chicago Symphony, New York Philharmonic, New World Symphony and other outstanding orchestras."
