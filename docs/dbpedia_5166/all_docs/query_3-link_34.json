        "text": "About Your First Concert\n\nI’ve never been to an orchestra concert before. What should I expect?\n\nExpect to enjoy yourself! This is the time to let go of any preconceptions you may have about classical music or the concert experience. Some things about the concert may seem strange because they’re new to you, but if you just focus on the music, you’ll have a great time. Open yourself up to the music. Feel the rhythms; follow the tunes. Watch the musicians and Maestro Bay; see how they interact with each other. Notice how the music ebbs and flows – surging and powerful at some times, delicate and ephemeral at others.\n\nWhat if I don’t know anything about classical music? Do I need to study beforehand?\n\nThere’s no need to study. The music will speak for itself. Just come and enjoy! Over time, many frequent concertgoers do find their enjoyment is deeper if they prepare for a concert. This can be simple, like reading the program notes beforehand; or it can be more involved, like listening to recordings of the music to be performed in the days before they attend a concert. We do have pre-concert talks before each Masterworks performance beginning at 7:10 PM. It last 20 minutes.\n\nWill I recognize any of the music?\n\nYou might! Classical music is all around us: in commercials, movie soundtracks, television themes, cartoons, retail shops, and even some elevators. Popular music often quotes classical melodies, as well. You’ll notice that each classical piece uses its own group of several tunes over and over, in different ways. You’ll start to “recognize” these melodies as a work progresses. Listen for the ways a melody is repeated: Is it exactly the same as the first time, or with a different character? Does it start the same as before, but go off in a different direction?\n\nWhat is the difference between your Masterworks Series and your Butler Pops Series?\n\nOur Masterworks Series is where you will hear typical classical pieces by Bach, Beethoven, Brahms, Bernstein, Grieg, Mozart, Copland, etc. etc. etc. The Butler Pops Series is where you’ll hear “popular” type music like The Beatles, Queen, movie music, Frank Sinatra, Broadway, and area always popular: listen to the orchestra as they play along with a movie.\n\nWhat should I wear?\n\nThere is no dress code! The days of monocles and top hats are over (unless you want to wear that). Anything that makes you feel comfortable is fine. Most people will be wearing business clothes or slightly dressy casual clothes, but you’ll see everything from khakis to cocktail dresses. Some people enjoy dressing up and making a special night of it. If you do decide to dress up, though, go easy on the perfume and cologne. It can distract others near you and even prompt them to sneeze (which may distract you).\n\nShould I arrive early?\n\nPlan to arrive at least 30-45 minutes before concert time, so you can find your seat, turn off your cell phone, take a look at your surroundings, absorb the atmosphere, and have time to glance through the program book, too. Most concerts start on time. If you’re late, you may end up listening from the lobby! If that happens, the usher will allow you inside during a suitable pause in the program, so your arrival won’t disturb other concertgoers.\n\nHow long is the concert?\n\nIt varies, but most orchestra concerts are about 90 minutes to two hours long, with an intermission at the halfway point.\n\nCan I take pictures?\n\nCameras, video recorders, and tape recorders are not permitted during a performance.\n\nWhy is there an intermission, and what should I do during it?\n\nIt’s a short rest period for the musicians and conductor – once you see how much activity goes into a performance, you’ll understand why they need a break! Listening to music is also an intense activity and a break in the middle helps the audience concentrate better in the second half. Some concerts, though, have no intermission because it would interrupt the flow of a long work. Check the program before the concert so you know what to expect. Most intermissions of the ASO are 20 minutes long.\n\nCan I bring my kids?\n\nIt depends on the concert and on the age of your kids. Many standard-length classical concerts are inappropriate for small children because they require an attention span that is difficult for youngsters to maintain. The ASO does present concerts designed especially for children (Education Programs). These are a great way for families to enjoy classical music together. To further build your children’s interest in classical music, play classical radio or CDs around the house. When they are old enough to sit quietly for an extended period, you may wish to bring them to the first half of a standard concert. In all cases, it’s a good idea to check with the orchestra directly about the appropriateness of the concert you plan to attend with your kids. Ask about discounts for students and children.\n\nWhat should I expect differently when attending a Butler Pops Series performance?\n\nThe Butler Pops Series a little more relaxed than a Masterworks Series performance. If it’s a pop singer or a film with orchestra, you’ll see people singing along, dancing, or eating some popcorn and cheering at their favorite part of the movie. The doors to the concert hall are typically left unlocked during a Butler Pops Series performance, unlike a Masterworks Series performance where the doors are locked until a suitable pause so as not to distract the orchestra or soloist.\n\nAbout the Orchestra\n\nWhat is a symphony orchestra, exactly?\n\nA symphony orchestra is a collection of up to about 100 musicians who play instruments of four basic types:\n\nStrings – violins (smallest, and highest in pitch), violas, cellos, and double basses (largest and lowest in pitch). These players sit in a semicircle directly in front of the conductor and make up more than half the orchestra.\n\nWoodwinds – flutes, oboes, clarinets, bassoons, and related instruments. These players sit a few rows back from the conductor, in the center of the orchestra.\n\nBrass – trumpets, horns, trombones, tubas, and similar instruments. These instruments are the loudest, so you’ll see them in the rear of the orchestra.\n\nPercussion – drums, bells, and other fascinating paraphernalia that are struck, plucked, rubbed, etc. This includes the tympani, the harp, and, on occasion, the piano. Some works use lots of different percussion; others may have a single musician playing the tympani, or no percussion at all. The percussion section is also found at the rear of the orchestra.\n\nWhy are the musicians onstage playing before the concert begins?\n\nJust like athletes warming up before a game, musicians need to warm up their muscles and focus their concentration. Some of them are working on the passages they need to polish up before the performance, with no regard for what anyone else is practicing.\n\nWhy do the musicians wear formal black clothes?\n\nThis is a long tradition that started centuries ago. Sometimes musicians dress a little more casually, but they still try to look uniform, so that the audience can concentrate on the music. Soloists are the exception: they often dress differently, because they are the focus of attention.\n\nHow come there are more stringed instruments than anything else?\n\nThe sound of each individual stringed instrument is softer than a brass or woodwind instrument. But in large numbers, they make a magnificent, rich sonority.\n\nWhy do their bows move together?\n\nThe players of each individual section – first violins, second violins, violas, cellos, and double basses – play in unison most of the time. So all the cellos move together, for instance. As you listen, noticing the different bowings for each section gives you a visual clue to sort out the various melodies you are hearing.\n\nWhat does the concertmaster do?\n\nThe concertmaster sits in the first chair of the first violins. This person acts as leader of that section, but also plays a leadership role with the orchestra as a whole. This person is also the last orchestra member to enter the stage before a concert, and cues the oboe to “tune” the orchestra.\n\nWhy do all the musicians tune to the oboe?\n\nThe penetrating tone of the oboe is easy for all players to hear. And its ability to sustain pitch is very secure. The oboe plays the note “A,” and all the players make sure their “A” is exactly on the same pitch as the oboe’s “A”. This ensures that they all are in agreement about the tuning before the concert begins.\n\nWhy do the string players share stands?\n\nFewer stands mean that the musicians, who are moving around quite a bit, have more room to play freely. Also, because the strings play more continuously than the other parts, their page turns can fall in inconvenient places where there should be no break in the music.\n\nWhy does Maestro Bay leave after every piece of music?\n\nThis provides the conductor a little breather – a chance to collect his or her thoughts before starting the next piece. If the applause is very enthusiastic, the conductor will come onstage again, bow, and perhaps recognize some musicians who played important solos in the piece.\n\nWhy don’t the musicians smile while they play?\n\nLook closely and you’ll see that some of them do! But in general, they are concentrating deeply, just like outfielders waiting for the fly ball or pitchers winding up to a curveball. They’re “in the Zone.” After the music is over, you may see them smiling broadly. If it was a concerto, and they liked the soloist’s performance, they won’t just smile – the string players will tap their stands with their bows as a sign of appreciation.\n\nBefore the Next Concert\n\nHow can I learn more about classical music?\n\nThere are several ways to learn more about the music you hear at the Symphony. Program notes are provided online for each concert at least one month prior to the concert. These same program notes are provided in the concert program at the concert that evening. Jeffrey Blair hosts “Concert Conversations” at 7:10 in the concert hall on classical concert nights. These can be entertaining and enlightening, offering information about the composers and works for the evening. He will often have guest soloists, conductors or composers of a featured work for that concert.\n\nCheck out our website for future concerts that are specifically designed to help you hear the many layers in the music."
