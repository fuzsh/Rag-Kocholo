        "text": "Amateurs are messing up rhythmically, embouchure, accidentals, bow leading, concentration, chatting, breathing, phrasing, intonation ... profis shouldn‘t! They are trained, payed and if they mess up, they are fired. There‘s an enorm pressure and concurrence.\n\nthe order and structure in music and composition/arrangement is composing and arranging the order and structure in the body of mind of hundreds of people.\n\nThere‘s a flow in the music - rhythmically and melodic - that keeps the whole orchestra together.\n\nThe conductor - inspired by the artwork - inspires the musician by the movements of his hands, the stick, his face, his eyes, his eyebrows, mouth, lips, tongue, his head, his whole body.\n\nThere are voice leaders in each section who are responsible for the mental presence of their colleagues and who coordinate the bow leading, the phrasing and breathing.\n\nThe concertmaster (1st violinist nearest the conductor‘s desk) - assisted by the oboe - is responsible for the tuning.\n\nEach musician has to be maximally prepared and to know his part.\n\nEach musician is contributing his best and has learnt to communicate and express his intensions by his tone and his gestures. (Have a look at the percussionist playing the cymbal or the triangle!)\n\nThere is a more or less strict hierarchy (written or unwritten) from the conductor, soloist, concert master, voice leaders, percussionist to the single musicians.\n\nThe unwritten hierarchy is formed by the ranked position, by the ancienity and the virtuosity of the members.\n\nSo the reason of the fact that there’s not a lot of mess is the sum of a good communication and interaction, gestures, positive group dynamic, motivation, competition, sympathy, ability and quality in practice and the will to do something beautiful for god.\n\nWhere one of these points lacks there will be a mess and you‘ll miss the good spirit and may not be touched.\n\nWatch and listen to this:\n\nThe string players in a symphony orchestra have a LOT of notes to play, often intricate passage-work at high speed. The odd 'domino' is almost inevitable - but there are typically 8 First Violins, 8 Second Violins - everyone DOESN'T have a different job! (And just occasionally we hear a top-class orchestra which has had ample rehearsal time and NO-ONE is 'faking it' in the tricky bits. It's a wonderful thing.)\n\nOutside the fiddle section, everyone is expected to (and capable to) play every note correctly. Of course, there's the occasional mishap. But it's rare to hear one with a good orchestra.\n\nOf course, there are plenty of not-so-good orchestras :-("
