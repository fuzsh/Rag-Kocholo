History of Winchester Chamber Orchestra

In the beginning...

The orchestra was originally founded as an evening class in 1988 and was known as the "Adult Education Orchestra". Their first ever concert was performed in Itchen Abbas Village Hall in June 1989. There were 16 members then: 6 clarinets, 2 flutes, 2 'cellos, 1 french horn, 1 viola, 3 violins and 1 tenor sax! The programme for that first concert included "French Comedy Overture" (Bela), "RAF March Past" (Walford Davies), a waltz from "Der Rosenkavalier" (Strauss), plus a selection of other short pieces.

In September 1991 Hampshire County Council withdrew funding for non-vocational courses and so the members decided set up their own orchestra, paying a subscription to keep it going. The orchestra's name changed to "Winchester Amateur Chamber Orchestra" and had grown to 30 members.
