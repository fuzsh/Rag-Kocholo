He was born in the Oriente province of Cuba and became a famous television star. When he hears the Castillo brothers in a nightclub, he invites them to perform on his television sitcom, I Love Lucy. Cesar remembers having Desi and his wife, Lucille Ball, to their apartment for some Cuban food, spending the night eating and drinking with them, but he questions whether his memory is accurate. In the last section of the book, Nestor's son Eugenio goes to visit Mr. Arnaz, and finds that he remembers the Castillos very well and has a picture of them on his wall.\n\nLucille Ball"
