        "text": "15. FEMME FATALE (2002)\n\nWritten and Directed by Brian DePalma. Starring Antonio Banderas, Rebecca Romijn, Peter Coyote.\n\nBanderas collaborated with Brian DePalma for this sly, sexy film noir tribute. Rebecca Romijn stars as Lauren Ashe, an icy Hitchcock blonde who steals $10 million worth of diamonds off the body of a supermodel at the Cannes Film Festival. As she tries to avoid capture, she keeps running into a paparazzo named Nicolas Bardo (Banderas) who continuously snaps her photo at the most inopportune times. “Femme Fatale” is high on style, with a convoluted plot that doubles and triples back on itself, while Romijn and Banderas have an erotic chemistry so steamy you can practically feel the sweat dripping off the screen.\n\n14. DESPERADO (1995)\n\nWritten and Directed by Robert Rodriguez. Starring Antonio Banderas, Joaquim de Almeida, Salma Hayek, Steve Buscemi, Cheech Marin, Quentin Tarantino.\n\nBanderas first collaborated with Robert Rodriguez in this loose followup to the director’s indie breakout “El Mariachi” (1992). He plays a gunslinger embroiled in a war with Bucho (Joaquim de Almeida), a violent drug runner. Along the way he starts a romance with Carolina (Salma Hayek), the beautiful bookstore owner who’s more than she appears to be. Like most Rodriguez films, “Desperado” is highly entertaining while being substantially empty, like a big budget grindhouse movie. Rodriguez, Banderas, and Hayek would later reunite for the sequel “Once Upon a Time in Mexico” (2003).\n\n13. SPY KIDS (2001)\n\nWritten and Directed by Robert Rodriguez. Starring Antonio Banderas, Carla Gugino, Alexa Vega, Daryl Sabara, Alan Cumming, Teri Hatcher, Cheech Marin, Danny Trejo, Robert Patrick, Tony Shalhoub, Mike Judge.\n\nIf you’re a millennial, chances are you got your introduction to Banderas in this Robert Rodriguez family adventure film. He stars as Gregorio Cortez, a retired spy living with his wife – fellow former spy Ingrid (Carla Gugino) – and their kids (Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara). When they’re called back into action, it’s up to the children to rescue their parents from the evil Felix Floop (Alan Cumming). The film’s success spawned three sequels, but none could match the fun and spontaneity of the first, which remains an entertaining yarn for viewers of all ages.\n\n12. LAW OF DESIRE (1987)\n\nWritten and directed by Pedro Almodovar. Starring Eusebio Poncela, Carmen Maura, Antonio Banderas, Miguel Molina, Bibi Andersen.\n\nAs an openly gay filmmaker, Pedro Almodovar has never shied away from representing the LGBTQ community in his work, and in “Law of Desire,” he weaves that into a story about the perils of fandom. Eusebio Poncela stars as Pablo, an acclaimed gay director having problems with his lover, Juan (Miguel Molina), and his transgender sister, Tina (Carmen Maura). Into his life comes Antonio (Banderas), a sexually-repressed young fan whose obsessive admiration quickly turns murderous. As he often does, Almodovar twists Banderas’ leading man charm to create a creepy loner who’s oddly relatable.\n\n11. MATADOR (1986)\n\nDirected by Pedro Almodovar. Written by Pedro Almodovar and Jesus Ferraro. Starring Assumpta Serna, Antonio Banderas, Nacho Martinez, Eva Cobo, Julieta Serrano, Chus Lampreave, Carmen Maura, Eusebio Poncela, Bibi Andersen.\n\nAmong the most controversial efforts from a notoriously rabble-rousing filmmaker, “Matador” forgoes the playfulness and slapstick of Pedro Almodovar’s previous efforts and ramps up the perversion and kinkiness. The results are a dark, disturbing foray into the depths of depravity, albeit a highly entertaining one that brought its director box office success. Banderas stars as a sexually frustrated bull fighter who attempts to rape the girlfriend (Eva Cobo) of his mentor (Nacho Martinez). When that fails, he falsely admits to a series of murders he didn’t commit. Meanwhile, the elder bullfighter links up romantically with his student’s defense attorney (Assumpta Serna), with whom he shares an unsettling sexual obsession.\n\n10. INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE (1994)\n\nDirected by Neil Jordan. Written by Anne Rice, based on her book. Starring Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Stephen Rea, Antonio Banderas, Christian Slater, Kirsten Dunst.\n\nBanderas sent chills down our spines as a debonaire bloodsucker in Neil Jordan’s adaptation of the Anne Rice bestseller. The film follows 200-year-old Louis de Pointe du Lac (Brad Pitt) as he recounts his life of vampirism to a San Francisco journalist (Christian Slater). His story begins in New Orleans in the late 1700s, where fellow night-stalker Lestat (Tom Cruise) first sinks his teeth into poor Louis’ neck. His centuries-long journey takes him to Paris, where he encounters Armand (Banderas) and Santiago (Stephen Rea), who run a secret underground society of vampires. “Interview with the Vampire” is mournful, operatic, and scary as hell. The film received Oscar nominations for its lavish production design and score.\n\n9. THE MAMBO KINGS (1992)\n\nDirected by Arne Glimcher. Written by Cynthia Cidre, based on the book “The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love” by Oscar Hijuelos. Starring Armand Assante, Antonio Banderas, Cathy Moriarty, Maruschka Detmers.\n\nArne Glimcher’s “The Mambo Kings” tells the story of two brothers – Cesar (Armand Assante) and Nestor (Banderas) – who flee Cuba in the 1950s for America to strike it big as musicians. Luckily, the two are really good singers. As Nestor, Banderas creates a brooding songwriter who can’t get over the woman who broke his heart in Havana, a stark contrast to his skirt-chasing older brother. The film is best known for its Oscar, Golden Globe, and Grammy nominated song “Beautiful Maria of My Soul,” and is of special note for being Banderas’ first English-language film role.\n\n8. WOMEN ON THE VERGE OF A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN (1988)\n\nWritten and Directed by Pedro Almodovar. Starring Carmen Maura, Antonio Banderas, Julieta Serrano, Rossy de Palma, Maria Barranco, Fernando Guillen.\n\nBanderas is a bit of an art house fixture through his frequent collaborations with Pedro Almodovar, the cult filmmaker who became an international name with “Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown.” The film stars Carmen Maura as a TV actress who takes a deadly combination of sleeping pills and gazpacho after her boyfriend, Ivan (Fernando Guillen), leaves her. Luckily, a series of events puts her suicide attempt on hold, including the arrival of her ex-lover’s son Carlos (Banderas). “Women” introduced American audiences to Almodovar’s unique blend of lurid melodrama and screwball comedy. The film received Oscar, Golden Globe, and BAFTA nominations as Best Foreign Language Film.\n\n7. ONCE UPON A TIME IN MEXICO (2003)\n\nWritten and Directed by Robert Rodriguez. Starring Antonio Banderas, Salma Hayek, Johnny Depp, Mickey Rourke, Eva Mendes, Danny Trejo, Enrique Iglesias, Marco Leonardi, Cheech Marin, Ruben Blades, Willem Dafoe.\n\nRobert Rodriguez wrapped up his Mexico Trilogy (which began with “El Mariachi” and “Desperado”) with this highly entertaining spaghetti western tribute. Banderas reprises his role as El Mariachi, a hitman who become entangled in international espionage when a psychotic CIA agent (Johnny Depp) recruits him to kill a Mexican drug lord (Willem Dafoe) planning to assassinate the President of Mexico. At the same time, he’s seeking revenge against a corrupt general who killed his wife (Salma Hayek) and daughter. The film hits the ground running and never pauses for a breath, making for a rollicking and brainless good time.\n\n6. THE SKIN I LIVE IN (2011)\n\nWritten and Directed by Pedro Almodovar, based on the book “Tarantula” by Thierry Jonquet. Starring Antonio Banderas, Elena Anaya, Marisa Paredes, Jan Cornet, Roberto Alamo.\n\nThe working relationship between Banderas and Pedro Almodovar remains a gift that keeps on giving. In “The Skin I Live In,” Banderas gives one of his best performances as Dr. Robert Ledgard, a brilliant plastic surgeon with a haunted past who has created a synthetic skin that can withstand any kind of damage. His guinea pig is a mysterious and volatile woman (Elena Anaya) who has played a key role in his inner pain. As the story takes one shocking twist after another, “The Skin I Live In” becomes a cinematic experience you won’t likely forget. Despite receiving a Golden Globe nomination and winning the BAFTA as Best Foreign Language Film, the film was snubbed at the Oscars.\n\n5. EVITA (1996)\n\nDirected by Alan Parker. Written by Parker and Oliver Stone, based on the musical by Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber. Starring Madonna, Antonio Banderas, Jonathan Pryce, Jimmy Nail.\n\nBanderas got to show off his musical theater chops in Alan Parker’s big screen adaptation of the Broadway classic. The film recounts the true story of Eva Peron (Madonna), a B-movie actress who married Argentinian president Juan Peron (Jonathan Pryce). Banderas plays Che, an everyman who acts as narrator, allowing the actor to assume different roles throughout the story. Despite receiving a Golden Globe nomination as Best Comedy/Musical Actor, Banderas was snubbed at the Oscars. He shouldn’t feel too bad, though: Madonna won the Globe as Best Comedy/Musical Actress over eventual Oscar-victor Frances McDormand (“Fargo”), but was noticeably absent from the Academy lineup.\n\n4. PHILADELPHIA (1993)\n\nDirected by Jonathan Demme. Written by Ron Nyswaner. Starring Tom Hanks, Denzel Washington, Jason Robards, Mary Steenburgen, Antonio Banderas.\n\nJonathan Demme’s “Philadelphia” came out at the height of the AIDS crisis, at a time when many Americans kept themselves blissfully ignorant about the deadly disease. Tom Hanks won a Best Actor Oscar for playing Andrew Beckett, a gay lawyer dying from AIDS who hires an ambulance-chasing attorney (Denzel Washington) to defend him in a wrongful dismissal suit against his former law firm. Banderas costars as Miguel, Andrew’s faithful lover. The film went a long way in opening audience’s eyes to the effects of AIDS, generating empathy for its victims and survivors.\n\n3. TIE ME UP! TIE ME DOWN! (1990)\n\nDirected by Pedro Almodovar. Written by Pedro Almodovar and Yuyi Beringola. Starring Victoria Abril, Antonio Banderas, Loles Leon, Francisco Rabal, Julieta Serrano, Maria Barranco, Rossy de Palma.\n\nOf all the collaborators Banderas has had throughout his career, no one has utilized the actor’s unique talent quite like Spanish auteur Pedro Almodovar. In “Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!,” the two create one of their most bizarre, delectable melodramas. Banderas plays Ricky, an unbalanced former mental patient who takes a beautiful porn star (Victoria Abril) prisoner in the hopes that she’ll marry him. Thirty years onward, “Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!” remains a provocative, sexy, and hilarious examination of Stockholm syndrome. The film received multiple Goya nominations – including Best Film, Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Actress – but was overlooked by the more conservative Academy.\n\n2. THE MASK OF ZORRO (1998)\n\nDirected by Martin Campbell. Written by John Eskow, Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, story by Elliott, Rossio, and Randall Jahnson, based on the character created by Johnston McCulley. Starring Antonio Banderas, Anthony Hopkins, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Stuart Wilson, Matt Letscher.\n\nWith all due respect to Douglas Fairbanks, Tyrone Power, Guy Williams, and George Hamilton, the best actor to ever wield the blade of Zorro is Antonio Banderas. In Martin Campbell’s adventure flick, Banderas dons the iconic black mask and cape of the 19th vigilante in an origin story that finds him being trained by an aging Zorro (Anthony Hopkins) to take over for him. Together, they plan to bring down an evil land baron (Stuart Wilson), but not before the young hero can romance the bad guy’s beautiful daughter (Catherine Zeta-Jones). Banderas brings just the right sly wit and charm to the role, a throwback to old Hollywood swashbucklers of yore. He received a Golden Globe nomination as Best Comedy/Musical Actor for the film, yet was overlooked at the Oscars.\n\n1. PAIN AND GLORY (2019)\n\nWritten and directed by Pedro Almodovar. Starring Antonio Banderas, Asier Etxeandia, Leonardo Sbaraglia, Nora Navas, Julieta Serrano, Penelope Cruz.\n\nBanderas scored his first Oscar nomination for longtime collaborator Pedro Almodovar’s deeply personal “Pain and Glory.” He plays Salvador Mallo, a director modeled closely on Almodovar (right down to the actor wearing his clothes and living in his apartment) whose career is in decline due to severe physical pain. As he faces the possibility of never working again, he reflects on his past, including his childhood in the village of Paterna, his love of cinema and his failed relationship with a former lover. The role brought Banderas additional bids at the Golden Globes and Critics Choice Awards."
