        "text": "Born and raised in Harlem, New York, Tito Puente follows a lineage of musicians who have pushed Latin American sounds to the future while holding onto traditional forms and century-old rhythms. There aren't many who could handle the burden of moving forward with an eye on the rearview mirror, but Puente, a son of immigrants, did it gracefully. Whether playing his famous, devilish timbales and his ever-precise vibraphones or arranging multiple orchestras sections, from brass to drums, Tito was a key-figure in shaping Latin American modern music in the U.S. and across the world.\n\nPuente's life was intertwined with music from an early age. First a piano student (his mom enrolled him in a 25 cent class) and then a teenage dancer who loved drumming, he always showed a knack for going beyond reading music scores or reproducing the same old standards. In Tito Puente and the Making of Latin Music, ethnomusicologist Steven Loza, the six-time GRAMMY winner recalled mixing \"jazz and Latin music all the time while I was a young kid, you know, studying.\"\n\nA talented kid who was used to playing at every impromptu stage in Spanish Harlem and who got the chance to attend the Juilliard School of Music, Tito's credentials were solid by the early 1950s when he first started his professional career. From then on, the maestro enlisted in several projects, recordings, and collaborations. It didn't take long for him to become synonymous with the modern Latin Music that was beaming out of the Latino diaspora in the States. In the 1950s and '60s, Puente helped to shape a melting pot of identities that found common ground on the dance floor.\n\nTito was the go-to person for the likes of Celia Cruz or La Lupe and an inspirational figure for musicians such as Carlos Santana. Even during the '80s and '90s, he didn't quit touring and writing new music. Sones, montunos, boleros, merengues, salsas, cha cha chas, rumbas, and mambos: there's only so much Puente could carry in his bag, but he made a lot by reassembling all of these cards into more than a hundred albums, countless performances, and several all-time songs.\n\nTito Puente passed away in 2000, yet his legacy in Latin music continues unabated. In honor of his centennial birthday on April 20, GRAMMY.com revisits 10 essential songs in Tito Puente's canon.\n\n\"Oye Mi Guangancó\" (1956)\n\nAt Legacy Records, a hotspot for haute Mediterranean fare in Manhattan's Hudson Yards neighborhood, Nathy is draped in an oversized blazer and pants. She looks like a relaxed, elegant CEO and the style becomes her, especially as she balances it with ultra-feminine touches. Today, its long nails tipped in fire-engine red.\n\nHer fashion choices are as pointed as her manicure, on and off stage. In the recent video for \"Aprender a Amar,\" she raps ferociously into a mirror, sharply dressed in a pin-stripe tie, a jacket with exaggerated shoulders, and delicate black lace gloves. These sartorial choices ask, Why settle for a mob-wife aesthetic when you can be a don yourself?\n\nBoth visually and aurally, Nathy Peluso is part cinematic diva and part underworld kingpin, with a fair amount of Missy Elliott swagger. Her tough, independent persona was on full display on her now-multimillion streamed 2020 Bizarrap session, which smoldered and crackled with her bombast. It was fully formed on \"Business Woman,\" from Calambre, and returned with a roar on her 2021 single \"Mafiosa,\" a high drama salsa track.\n\nHer powerful energy is pure hip-hop in steel-toe Timbs, but she performs with the generous spirit of a burgeoning pop star ministering to a big house of fans. On Grasa, Nathy Peluso brings humanity to her braggadocio. This doesn’t stop her from picking up the mafia saga where she left off on Calambre. The opening track is titled \"Corleone.\"\n\nAhead of the release of her first album in four years, Nathy Peluso spoke with GRAMMY.com about overcoming creative burnout, taking inspiration from mob movies, and the true meaning of \"grasa.\"\n\nThis album is more personal than your previous releases. What led you to open up more lyrically?\n\nI think it just happened because I am growing. I am learning and I need to tell my truth. The way for me to do that is music. It’s been four years, but, when the moment came, I was ready.\n\nSpeaking of four years ago, 2020 was a very big year for you. A lot happened. What are your most vivid memories from that time?\n\nCalambre was the moment. It was really special for me. Winning the GRAMMY was the moment, and then touring with that album was an amazing learning experience for me. I grew up on the stage.\n\nI grew up as a woman, as an artist, as a performer, maybe as a lover too. You are traveling around the world with so much pressure. Physically, it was a difficult show. I was alone on stage, with my musicians, but no dancers. It was a challenge.\n\nI grew up in so many ways, but when I finished that tour I was broken. My soul was broken. I was empty. I started looking for myself. It was very tough.\n\nIt sounds like you were experiencing creative burnout.\n\nYes, my brain was broken, but it was necessary in order to start again. I did an album then, but I decided not to go with that album and to start again. So, it was a very long path.\n\nYou wrote a whole album and then discarded it? What wasn’t working about it?\n\nIt was working, but it wasn’t the feelings I wanted to share and the music I wanted to share. Sometimes there are projects whose purpose is just to learn from. It was a process of learning for me. That was a very special moment.\n\nYou start feeling like a failure, but no. It was necessary to go through that to get to Grasa. The things I learned were exactly the things I needed to know to then make this music.\n\nSo, how did you overcome this period of burnout and get to the point where you were feeling creative again?\n\nA lot of therapy. A lot of working on my s— and confronting it.\n\nIs there one song on Grasa that is more intense to perform, or more emotional for you than the others?\n\n\"Envidia\" is talking real s—. Things happen around you and you need to know who you are and what your intention is. You have to be focused on what you want to bring to the world and not care about anything besides your craft. People are going to talk. Things are going to be crazy. You’ve got to know your choice, your path.\n\nCan you tell me about the song \"Corleone\"? How do gangster movies inspire you?\n\nI have a song called \"Mafiosa.\" It’s a character I love to perform and I see myself in that character. It’s relatable. The mafia have codes that represent me — not everything [laughs] — but, you know, the family, the legacy, working hard, respect. That kind of feeling in music, in cinema, is what I was looking for. I love the aesthetic. I love Tarantino. I love Tony Montana, the character. On stage, I feel like him sometimes.\n\nI love for a woman to be that type of character. I think it’s interesting. Usually, those kinds of feelings in music or cinema are represented by men. It’s always that way in salsa. If you look at Celia or Gloria, they were always more romantic. Maybe La Lupe was dangerous. For me, it’s important to bring that energy to the music, like, rude, strong, dangerous. Be careful, bitch!\n\nWhat were some of your specific musical influences while working on this album?\n\nAlways folklore and roots, salsa and bolero, but then I was paying attention to Kendrick Lamar and Kanye West. They are a big inspiration for me.\n\nHow do you bridge the gap, or find the connections among your different influences?\n\nI don’t even know. I just do music, really. I go to the studio and I start singing. I just feel it. I go to the studio, and suddenly I want to sing, and I want to cry. And then another day, I feel powerful and I want drama and aggressive stuff. It’s very honest. The starting point is always the way I feel.\n\nIs it important to you to make music that empowers other women?\n\nYes. For sure. But it wasn’t ever a strategy, like, \"I want to do music for empowering women.\" I just did my music without direction. Then I discovered people were feeling the power and using it. I feel inspired by that, but it wasn’t the point.\n\nWhat does the word \"grasa\" mean to you?\n\nI chose that word because it’s the strongest word. It’s dirty. It’s funky. But it’s a word that, at least in Spanish, has a lot of meanings. So, I want people to choose the meaning. After listening to the album, you can choose the meaning and maybe redefine it with the album.\n\nHow Danna Paola Created 'CHILDSTAR' By Deconstructing Herself\n\nThe 2024 GRAMMY nominations are right around the corner — and as always, inspired Latin musical offerings will lie within the heart of the list.\n\nWhile the Recording Academy’s sister academy, the Latin Recording Academy, naturally honors this world most comprehensively, it plays a crucial role in the GRAMMYs landscape just as in that of the Latin GRAMMYs — and there’s been crossover time and time again!\n\nOn Nov. 10, the world will behold nominations in all categories — including several within the Latin, Global, African, Reggae & New Age, Ambient, or Chant field. Within the world of Latin music, the awards are: Best Latin Pop Album, Best Música Urbana Album, Best Latin Rock or Alternative Album, Best Música Mexicana Album (Including Tejano), and Best Tropical Latin Album. The Recording Academy also offers a GRAMMY Award for Best Latin Jazz album, though that award is a part of a different field.\n\nLike the Recording Academy and GRAMMYs themselves, these categories have evolved over the years. Along the way, various Latin music luminaries have forged milestones in Academy history.\n\nAhead of the 2024 GRAMMYs nominations, here are some key facts to know about Latin music’s history at the GRAMMYs.\n\nThe First Award For Latin Music At The GRAMMYs Was Given In 1975\n\nThe first winner for Best Latin Recording was pianist and composer Eddie Palmieri, for 1974’s The Sun of Latin Music. Now an eight-time GRAMMY winner, Palmieri took home the golden gramophone in this category at both the 1976 GRAMMYs and the following year for Unfinished Masterpiece.\n\nAt the 1980 GRAMMYs, the first group winner was the thrice nominated Afro-Cuban jazz band Irakere, for their 1978 self-titled debut.\n\nPercussionist Mongo Santamaria holds the record for the most nominations within the Best Latin Recording category.\n\nThe Sound Of Latin Pop — And The Title Of The Award — Has Shifted Over 40 Years\n\nBack in 1983, this category was called Best Latin Pop Performance. The first winner was José Feliciano, who took home the golden gramophone for his album Me Enamoré at the 26th GRAMMY Awards.\n\nBest Latin Pop Performance eventually pivoted to Best Latin Pop Album and Best Latin Pop or Urban Album, then back to Best Latin Pop Album — just another example of how the Academy continually strives for precision and inclusion in its categories.\n\nAs for most wins, it’s a tie between Feliciano and Alejandro Sanz, at four. Feliciano also holds the distinction of having two consecutive wins, at the 1990 and 1991 GRAMMYs.\n\nThe Best Latin Urban Album Category Was Introduced In 2007\n\nThe first winner in this category was the urban hip-hop outfit Calle 13, for their 2007 album Residente o Visitante.\n\nThe first female nominee was Vanessa Bañuelos, a member of the Latin rap trio La Sinfonia, who were nominated for Best Latin Urban Album for their 2008 self-titled album at the 2009 GRAMMYs.\n\nHere’s Who Dominated The Best Norteño Album Category\n\nThe first GRAMMY winner in the Best Norteño Album category was Los Tigres Del Norte, for their 2006 album Historias Que Contar, at the 2007 GRAMMYs. To date, they have landed four consecutive wins — at the 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010 GRAMMYs.\n\nThe Intersection Between Latin, Rock & Alternative Has Shifted\n\nBest Latin Rock Or Alternative Album; Best Latin Rock, Alternative Or Urban Album; Best Latin Rock/Alternative Performance… so on and so forth.\n\nIf that’s a mouthful, again, that shows how the Academy continually hones in on a musical sphere for inclusion and accuracy’s sake.\n\nWithin this shifting category, the first winner was Los Fabulosos Cadillacs, who won Best Latin Rock/Alternative Performance for 1997’s Fabulosos Calavera at the 1998 GRAMMYs.\n\nAt the 2016 GRAMMYs, there was a tie for the golden gramophone for Best Latin Rock, Urban Or Alternative Album, between Natalia Lafourcade and Pitbull. Overall, the most wins underneath this umbrella go to Maná, with a total of three.\n\nThese Artists Made History In Tropical Latin Categories\n\nOver the years, this component of Latin music has been honored with GRAMMYs for Best Traditional Tropical Latin Performance, Best Traditional Tropical Latin Album, Best Tropical Latin Performance, and Best Tropical Latin Album.\n\nThe first winner of a GRAMMY for Best Tropical Latin Performance was Tito Puente & His Latin Ensemble, for \"On Broadway,\" from the 1983 album of the same name.\n\nUnder the same category, the first female winner was Celia Cruz, for \"Ritmo En El Corazón.\" Overall, Rubén Blades has taken home the most GRAMMYs under this umbrella, with a total of six.\n\nThis Was The First Latin Artist To Win Album Of The Year\n\nTen-time GRAMMY winner and 14-time nominee Carlos Santana holds this distinction for 1999’s \"Supernatural,\" at the 2000 GRAMMYs.\n\nThis Was The First Spanish-Language Album To Be Nominated For Album Of The Year\n\nThat would be Bad Bunny’s Un Verano Sin Ti, at the 2023 GRAMMYs; Bad Bunny also performed at the ceremony, but Harry Styles ended up taking home that golden gramophone.\n\nDitto Música Mexicana — Formerly Known As Best Regional Mexican Music Album\n\nMúsica mexicana — a broad descriptor of regional sounds, including Tejano — is having a moment in recent years, which points to the incredibly rich GRAMMYs legacy of these musical worlds.\n\nThe first winner for Best Mexican-American Performance was Los Lobos, for 1983’s \"Anselma.\" For Best Regional Mexican or Tejano Album, that was Pepe Aguilar, for 2010’s \"Bicentenario.\"\n\nThe Inaugural Trophy For Best Música Urbana Album Went To…\n\nThe one and only Bad Bunny, for 2020’s El Último Tour Del Mundo. He took home the golden gramophone again at the 2023 GRAMMYs for Un Verano Sin Ti.\n\nKeep checking back as more information comes out about the 2024 GRAMMYs — and how the Recording Academy will honor and elevate Latin genres once again!\n\nWhat's Next For Latin Music? A Roundtable Discussion About Reggaetón, Indie Acts, Regional Sounds & More\n\nSalsa was born in New York City, so it's only natural that there should be a museum dedicated to its origins, influence and multifarious sounds.\n\nThe Bronx-based nonprofit International Salsa Museum is at the center of that mission. While they don't have a dedicated space yet — organizers hope to take over a decommissioned armory in the Bronx within five years — ISM brought part of their collection to the New York International Salsa Congress over Labor Day weekend.\n\nFeaturing art, clothing, instruments and photography, the exhibit highlighted legendary musicians such as percussionist Ralph Irizarry and singer/songwriter Luis Figueroa, as well as trailblazing choreographer Eddie Torres sr. Images of Latin culture in New York from the 1980s and '90s, from block parties to early shots of Marc Anthony, were also present.\n\nYet the heart of the exhibit centered on Tito Puente, the six-time GRAMMY-winning percussionist, bandleader and producer, and Cuban singer La Lupe. Dubbed \"The Queen of Latin Soul\" in her 1960s heyday, La Lupe sold millions of records and was the first Latina to perform at Carnegie Hall and Madison Square Garden. She was a friend and frequent collaborator of Puente's in the '60s.\n\nISM Co-Founder and musician Willy Rodriguez went to the musicians' families to speak to them about their relative's legacy. \"I get emotional talking about it,\" Rodriguez told GRAMMY.com. \"Us doing this is not necessarily just showing the history, but it's also healing for the families.\"\n\nOn display is one of Puente's suits — a black three-piece with a wide lapel, which he wore while performing with the Puerto Rican Symphony — alongside his bandstand, musical charts, contracts and various honors. La Lupe's music charts, photos and albums were all rescued following a devastating fire in her New York City apartment in the 1980s; some of the items bear water and fire damage. \"Looking at these pictures, I can envision her going into the apartment, grabbing her kids, grabbing all these items and just running out. That's why this is so important,\" Rodriguez says.\n\nThe Puente/La Lupe section of the exhibit was curated around feeling, Rodriguez adds. \"It's about going out to the family, speaking to them about: What is it that we're doing? Why are we doing it? It's not about the money; it's about the legacies of these people.\"\n\nWith preservation and education in mind, read on for eight things GRAMMY.com learned about La Lupe and Tito Puente.\n\nLa Lupe Transcended Genre And Broke Barriers For Women In Latin Music"
