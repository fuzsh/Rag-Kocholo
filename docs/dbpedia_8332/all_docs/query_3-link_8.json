        "text": "About halfway through \"The Mambo Kings,\" the adaptation of the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Oscar Hijuelos, there is a brief moment in which all of the elements work as they were meant to. At a wedding reception, Celia Cruz, the veteran salsa performer who appears as a Harlem nightclub owner, can't restrain her good feelings.\n\nYet the Cuban-born Miss Cruz is a figure of light and shadow, a one-woman definition of chiaroscuro. Her broad smile, the lightness of her walk, the easy way she carries herself become an expression of the exuberant Latin music that is the other side of the mismatched, melancholy lives of the film's Latin exiles.\n\nAlthough the sequence is a good one, it probably should have been cut and burned. It suggests everything that is otherwise missing from \"The Mambo Kings,\" a handsome production that has been directed with no elan whatsoever by Arne Glimcher, the New York art-world figure. Mr. Glimcher, the director and founder of the Pace Gallery in Manhattan, has lately been dealing in movies, first as a producer (\"The Good Mother,\" \"Gorillas in the Mist\") and now as a director.\n\nThere is a lot of music in \"The Mambo Kings,\" but it seldom animates this tale of two Cuban brothers who, in 1952, come to New York to cash in on the popularity of the Latin beat. It's as if there were a terrible telephone connection between the film's vivid sound track and its tepid romantic melodrama, to which the music is supposed to give style and substance.\n\nLike its title, \"The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love,\" the Hijuelos novel has been boiled down and unimaginatively straightened out in Cynthia Cidre's screenplay. Cesar Castillo (Armand Assante) drags his younger brother, Nestor (Antonio Banderas), with him to New York after Nestor's life is threatened by the new husband of Nestor's true love, Maria (Talisa Soto). Nestor doesn't know this and so is resentful of his adoring older brother's highhandedness.\n\nFor Cesar, New York in the early 1950's is the promised land of beautiful easy women and the possibilities of stardom to equal Tito Puente's. He forms a band, the Mambo Kings, which earns a certain amount of success, although Cesar refuses to cooperate with the underworld characters who control the club scene. He works hard, drinks hard and takes life as it comes.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
