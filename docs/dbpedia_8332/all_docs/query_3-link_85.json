        "text": "February 5, 1999\n\nBOOKS OF THE TIMES\n\nUnlike Mambo Kings, an Empress Tidies Up\n\nBy MICHIKO KAKUTANI\n\nEMPRESS OF THE SPLENDID SEASON\n\nBy Oscar Hijuelos\n\n342 pages. Harper/Flamingo. $25.\n\nike so many of Oscar Hijuelos' earlier novels, \"Empress of the Splendid Season\" is a chronicle of familial love that unfurls in New York over the last five decades. It is another tale of a Cuban family, torn between fading memories of life back home in Cuba and the glittering promises of the American Dream, between the centripetal powers of kinship and tradition and the centrifugal forces of history and generational change.\n\nWhereas Hijuelos' two best known novels, \"The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love\" (1989) and \"The Fourteen Sisters of Emilio Montez O'Brien\" (1993), worked these themes on a colorful, epic canvas, \"Empress\" is a smaller, more modest book. It is less fecund in its peopling of a fictional world, less ambitious in its orchestration of overlapping stories. Even its language tends to be less expansive, less exuberant than its predecessors.\n\nBecause Hijuelos is such a fluent writer, because he writes with such affection for his characters, the novel is not without its rewards, but it remains, in contrast to his earlier books, an oddly attenuated piece of fiction, lacking both the energy of \"Mambo Kings\" and \"Sisters\" and the fierce narrative control of \" Ives' Christmas\" (1995). In fact it often feels like a tired reworking of old material, a musty, paint-by-numbers version of Hijuelos' favorite preoccupations and motifs, brightened with a few splashes of inspiration.\n\nThe title character of \"Empress\" is Lydia Espana, a Cuban emigre who has been a cleaning woman since her husband, Raul, a waiter, began having heart problems. Lydia, who carries herself \"with the imperious attitude of a young movie starlet,\" strikes many of her acquaintances as snobbish, self-pitying and pretentious. She likes to think she has more in common with the cultivated people she works for than with many of her neighbors, and she imposes a strict code of behavior and dress on her children.\n\nSigrid Estrada/ HarperFlamingo Oscar Hijuelos\n\nIn quick, summary fashion, Hijuelos sketches in Lydia's history and the events that transformed her from \"the Empress of the Splendid Season\" into \"Lydia the Spanish cleaning lady.\"\n\nLydia, we're told, was the spoiled daughter of a well-to-do Cuban businessman who kicked her out of the house when he found out about her affair with a middle-aged man. She left Cuba for New York in 1947 and soon found her movie-fueled dreams of America -- \"where life was all pearl necklaces, fancy mansions, speak-easies, gangsters, cowboys and unbelievably glamorous women or drop-dead handsome men\" -- dissolving in the fetid gloom of a sweatshop where she worked as an apprentice seamstress.\n\nCleaning rich people's apartments is something of an improvement, but it's still a demeaning job, and it's portrayed by Hijuelos in flat, generic terms that substitute clumsy symbolism for the mythic resonance of his earlier books.\n\nHijuelos makes broad generalizations about cleaning women daydreaming about \"winning new washing machines on the 'Queen for a Day' television show,\" and wearing tennis shoes and \"thick nylons with runs in them.\" He writes about the hardships endured by cleaning women with children -- women \"who dragged themselves out of bed early in the mornings and, leaving the kids with a neighbor, if they could, worked six days a week and still could never earn enough to make ends meet.\"\n\nHe tries to flesh out Lydia's experience with little vignettes about other cleaning women she knows: one who won the lottery and moved from the Bronx to Astoria, Queens; another who scrimped and saved with her husband to buy a bungalow in the Catskills, only to die of cancer shortly after retiring from her job.\n\nNone of these walk-on characters develops into a memorable human being, and the same might be said of Lydia's employers, a motley assortment of rich people and eccentrics whose lives Lydia vicariously enjoys. Even Osprey, her favorite employer, who helps her son, Rico, remains a strangely fuzzy collection of class stereotypes: a wealthy, aristocratic lawyer who knew President Eisenhower, who liked to travel abroad and who treated his staff with paternalistic affection.\n\nThroughout the novel, the contrast drawn between Osprey's life and Lydia's feels mechanical and pat. His world is filled with \"glamour and money, cleanliness and good manners,\" while hers is defined by what she will never do: \"Never buy a piece of property. Never own a firsthand car. Never sit by a late 19th-century French writing desk at the Armory Show, scribbling out checks without a single doubt.\"\n\nA similar predictability attends Hijuelos' depiction of the generational disputes within the Espana family: just as a sexually precocious Lydia rebelled against her strict father, so her liberated daughter Alicia rebels against her; and just as Lydia grew estranged from her family, so her children drift away from her. This sort of schematic rendering of the schisms in the Espana clan stands in sharp contrast to the highly nuanced dissection of the familial bonds of love, resentment and regret found in the author's earlier novels, and it's qualified only by Hijuelos' sympathetic rendering of the difficulties Rico has leaving the world of his parents behind.\n\nPropelled by his mother's expectations, Rico works hard in school, goes to college and grad school and becomes a highly paid psychotherapist, ministering to well-heeled yuppies. In achieving success, however, Rico has misplaced his sense of self. There is a chilliness to his dealings with his parents now, and he eventually realizes that he belongs nowhere, neither to his mother's world in Harlem nor to Osprey's world on Park Avenue. He has become an emotional exile, disconnected from both his past and his present.\n\nRico's story, detailed in the final chapters of \"Empress,\" closes the novel on a persuasive note but does not make up for the perfunctory tone of much of his mother's saga. From another writer, \"Empress\" might read like a promising work of fiction, filled with hints of better things to come. From the richly talented Hijuelos, who has spoiled his readers until now, it comes as a disappointment."
