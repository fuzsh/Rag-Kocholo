        "text": "Carolrhoda Lab Blanca: Life is not a multiple-choice test. Verdad: Hell is now, saying it happens later is a power play. Honest. Tragic. Realist. Truthful. This is a bold novel that deals with hard topics like death, betrayal, homelessness and sexual orientation. It’s well-written, with a great cast of characters. It’s also very realistic, and like today’s youth, Verdad and Danny face hard choices as they learn who they truly are, who they want to be, and whom they want to love. SUMMARY: A powerful exploration of love, identity, and self-worth through the eyes of a fierce, questioning Puerto Rican teen. Fifteen-year-old Verdad doesn't think she has time for love. She's still struggling to process the recent death of her best friend, Blanca; dealing with the high expectations of her hardworking Puerto Rican mother and the absence of her remarried father; and keeping everyone at a distance. But when she meets Danny, a new guy at s\n\nAl jibaro nunca se le quita la mancha de platano. A jibaro can never wash away the stain of the plantain . -Esmeralda Santiago Vintage, 1990 If you are Puerto Rican, you have probably heard of Esmeralda Santiago. She is the author that gave Puerto Ricans a face and a voice. She is every Boricua – torn between two cultures, two languages, two identities. Which is the real Esmeralda? The answer is another question – why can’t she be both? Esmeralda’s WHEN I WAS PUERTO RICAN is the first of three memoirs that take readers from the pueblitos of the small Caribbean island to the big city in Manhattan. Esme’s new life is full of challenges, discoveries and dualities. In fact, the original version of the novel had two parts – Puerto Rico and America. Esmeralda is both Puerto Rican and American. There are no sides to choose. Her journey is ours, and hopefully, we can do it with equal grace and success. SUMMARY: In a childhood\n\nIn honor of Father’s Day, The Latina Book Club , has put together this short list of male authors. We selected a wide variety, from coming of age stories to political poems to dark thrillers. G reat selections all. Happy Reading. LOVE by Matt de la Peňa (G.P. Putnam) Written by a Newbery Medal winning author, this novel is about the love that surrounds us. As children we can see it, feel it, even taste it. We lose that feeling as adults, but this beautifully illustrated picture book by Loren Long, brings those loving feelings back to life.

Superb. A Triumph. The difficult journey of an immigrant child struggling to navigate two cultures, two languages, two worlds is the same now as it was in the 1960’s and 1970's. The struggle to learn a new language, to be accepted, to belong to the new world takes a toll on the child and can often threaten the bonds of family and culture. Such is Richard’s story. HUNGER OF MEMORY is the story of Mexican-American Richard Rodriguez, who begins his schooling in Sacramento, California, knowing just 50 words of English, and concludes his university studies in the stately quiet of the reading room of the British Museum. Here is the poignant journey of a “minority student” who pays the cost of his social assimilation and academic\n\nThe taste of you remains Clinging to paradise But as the distance from you grows All that my heart ever knows Hunger for your kiss Longing for your touch Beautiful Maria of my soul --Lyrics, Beautiful Maria of My Soul Song by Los Lobos THE MAMBO KINGS PLAY SONGS OF LOVE By Oscar Hijuelos (1989) Farrar Straus Giroux Winner of the 1990 Pulitzer Prize in Literature We loved the book, the movie and the sequel !!! SUMMARY: It's 1949 and two young Cuban musicians make their way from Havana to the grand stage of New York City. It is the era of mambo, and the Castillo brothers, workers by day, become stars of the dance halls by night, where their orchestra plays the lush, sensuous, pulsing music that earns them the title of the Mambo Kings. This is their moment of youth, exuberance, love, and freedom―a golden time that decades later is remembered with nostalgia and deep affection. Hijuelos's marvelous portrait of the Castillo brothers, their families,\n\nThe Latina Book Club supports our Black Brothers and Sisters and our Afro Latinx / Black Latinx Communities during these hard times.

Unapologetic. Quixotic. Rebellious. Ana Castillo’s debut novel, THE MIXQUIAHUALA LETTERS, was “groundbreaking” and largely misunderstood. Mainly because the book was not a novel per se, instead the 138-page book is a collection of letters from Teresa to her friend Alicia, an artist. Readers are cautioned at the beginning of the book that they have three options on how to move forward – “for the conformist, the cynic and the quixotic.” Depending on which option the reader takes that would determine his journey and satisfaction at the end. The letters are only from Teresa’s point of view, but they contain enough substance to flesh out both women, and to highlight their adventures. Confronted with strict societal roles and rules of conduct, Teresa"
