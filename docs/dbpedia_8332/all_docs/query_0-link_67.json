        "text": "MIAMI — Oscar Hijuelos stopped abruptly on Calle Ocho at a mural of Latino celebrities. “Wow,” he said, pointing to colorful portraits of people he knew: Celia Cruz, Cuba’s queen of salsa, and Tito Puente, the drummer extraordinaire.\n\n“They used to send me Christmas cards,” Mr. Hijuelos said. He chuckled at the thought, his eyes bright as a child’s, his pale, bald forehead wet with sweat. Even without a camera, he had come to resemble what he admits he is here in Miami: a tourist.\n\nThat may sound strange for a son of Cuban immigrants who won the Pulitzer Prize in 1990 for “The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love,” a melancholy, sex-soaked novel about two Cuban brothers trying to make music in Havana and New York before the Castro revolution. But Mr. Hijuelos has never felt entirely comfortable here in the city of “Scarface” and Elían González, nor is he the kind of Cuban who talks politics or demands attention for his own family’s post-Castro losses.\n\nHis art instead reflects his bebop personality — one moment humble, the next riffing passionately on love and literature. His newest book, “Beautiful Maria of My Soul,” published last month by Hyperion, shows once again that he is a careful, distant observer, whose Cubanía, or Cubanness, comes from sitting in the audience, not performing center stage.\n\nHis vantage point has shifted this time, but only slightly. María García y Cifuentes was the heart of “Mambo Kings,” the lost love of Nestor Castillo, the quiet, virile hero of the book who wrote a bolero in her honor. This ballad is now the name of the sequel, which follows Maria, who has now lost the accent on her name, from the moment she leaves her small village as a teenager through years as a dancer in Havana and a retiree in Miami.\n\nMr. Hijuelos, 58, said he returned to Maria in his eighth novel because she was never fully explored. In “Mambo Kings” she was mostly a sensual vision of unsatisfied desire. Now given her own narrative voice, she is still sexy — with escapades described in graphic detail — but she is also hard as a stiletto, giving up Nestor for a richer man (with a cold pragmatism that Mr. Hijuelos’s wife connects with his mother).\n\nReviewers have described the novel as a stylistic counterpoint to “Mambo Kings,” but it also explores a contrast in geography and identity: what it means to be Cuban in Miami, and what it means anywhere else.\n\nMr. Hijuelos, like the Castillo brothers of his fiction, came of age in New York. His father worked at a hotel, and his mother did odd jobs to bring in extra money. Being Cuban sometimes required explaining.\n\nOver a lunch of roasted pork and beer in Little Havana, he recalled a moment early in his career when a white acquaintance referred to Desi Arnaz, the Cuban actor who played Ricky Ricardo on “I Love Lucy,” as “that Spanish guy.” It was generic. It was wrong.\n\n“That was one of the first things I intended to explore,” Mr. Hijuelos said.\n\n“Mambo Kings” brought Mr. Arnaz back to life, along with the hip-shaking music of the ’50s. In that novel he gives the Castillo brothers their big break by inviting them to play the song about Maria on his show. Lucie Arnaz, the daughter of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, said in an interview that she respected Mr. Hijuelos’s depiction because it showed that her father had stayed rooted despite his celebrity.\n\nBut the ideal that Mr. Arnaz embodied — “my father was very concerned about trying to pass as a hardworking, smart American,” she said — pushed many sons and daughters of Cuban immigrants away from the insular worlds of Miami or Havana.\n\nMs. Arnaz and Mr. Hijuelos ended up hyphenated (more American-Cuban than Cuban-American) so that when Mr. Hijuelos speaks Spanish, he repeats words under his breath to make sure he has them right. He says “Fuhgeddaboutit” far more than the typical Cuban curse words.\n\nMr. Hijuelos described his upbringing as outside the “exact moment of the culture” that has come to define the Cuban exile experience. Just a few tables away sat men roughly the same age, wearing guayaberas, speaking rapid Spanish.\n\n“Others might be trapped in a certain time or emotion,” he said.\n\nStill, partly because of that frozen-in-time feel, Cuban Miami has always been a touchstone for immigrants from the island, and Mr. Hijuelos is no exception. Driving through the middle-class neighborhood where his aunt lived in the ’60s, he recalled feeling a deeper connection to his roots whenever he came here as a child. He had cousins, friends, all Cuban, all playing in a subtropical world with the small ranch houses and scented trees that evoked their homeland.\n\n“It’s so perfumed,” he said. “It’s a different world from what I saw in New York.”\n\nAt the main domino park on Calle Ocho and in a souvenir shop nearby, Mr. Hijuelos said he did not mind much that Cuban culture had become kitsch for many visitors to the city. He wished more of the culture, the music, the literature, were being sold alongside the posters, cigar boxes and T-shirts that said “made in America with Cuban parts.” But he appreciated that this world was being celebrated.\n\n“There are so many different levels of ‘Cuban,’ ” he said.\n\n“Beautiful Maria” actually tackles this idea head-on. In a self-referential twist near the end, Mr. Hijuelos himself makes an appearance at a Coral Gables bookstore for a reading, where he is confronted by Maria’s daughter, Teresa, who accuses him of invading her mother’s privacy. He accurately describes himself as “not very Cuban-looking at all,” with a stocky build, glasses, and light skin that makes him “more Fred Mertz than Desi Arnaz.”\n\nWhen he meets Maria later on, they are able to connect because she, with her “amber dignity,” takes pity on him. Teresa grows to appreciate him as well — and this, to some degree, is Mr. Hijuelos’s greatest wish, to be embraced by his own people.\n\nAs a writer, he is a laborer like his father: he sometimes comes out of his studio with his elbows bloodied from banging against his desk. And while nothing he’s written since “Mambo Kings” has created the same kind of stir, he remains passionate. More than anything, he loves hearing that the characters he has created ring true to those who know from experience the worlds that he mostly imagines.\n\nHe smiles most broadly, in fact, when he talks about those who say they remember hearing the Mambo Kings play, as if they were real, as if they too belonged on the Calle Ocho mural with Tito Puente and Celia Cruz. Maria, in his mind, is no less alive.\n\n“I know for a fact that there are many Marias in Miami who are lovesick for musicians,” he said. “I wrote the book on the assumption that it’s a true story; it may not be, but it feels real to me.”"
