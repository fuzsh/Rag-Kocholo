        "text": "‚ÄúIn the name of the Mambo, the Rumba, and the Cha cha cha.‚Äù\n\nThis film was one of my main boys, Antonio Banderas‚Äôs first English-speaking part in his filmography, and he was good looking of course, and it was a good one with great performances from not only my boy Antonio but also my boy Armand Assante. I love the musical score and cinematography, which captured that period beautifully.\n\nI can't say I was blown away by the plot or anything, but this is a film where the production, lead actors and music make it worth watching.\n\nAssante and Banderas are good together, and it seemed like they were true brothers. I'm quite sure they did all their own singing and instrument playing, so it felt real. I just wish the supporting ladies got more to do.\n\nI loved the bit they did with the I LOVE LUCY footage.\n\nAww man this movie got me in the end!\n\nWhat a sad tale of lost love and missed opportunities!\n\nI‚Äôm not going to spoil anything cause I think it‚Äôs worth the watch! There‚Äôs definitely a lesson on love and the heart in this one that‚Äôs worth the watch.\n\nWatched with my Momma ü•∞\n\nKinda mixed on this one. The music and dancing is phenomenal and the acting is great, I especially loved a baby faced Antonio Banderas, but the story and writing is super mid and general direction is uninspired. There's probably a direct correlation between how much you like Cuban music and how much you'll dig this movie. I dig Cuban music but it wasn't really enough to overcome the minuses of this film. You might think different.\n\nThe film was the reason I was born!\n\nThis job was very important to me because my father, after watching this film, decided that my brother would be too lonely and bor–µd in his life, so I was born.\n\nThis is how cinema can affect people! It can give life!)\n\nIs it ridiculous in hindsight to have an Italian-American and a Spanish man play Cubans? A bit, yeah. But at the same time, I can't deny just how god damn good Assante and Banderas are as the titular musicians, portraying them with so much emotional nuance. Their performances carry this movie.\n\nThe writing's not bad, but it also doesn't hit as hard as it feels like it could.\n\nAnd then you have the soundtrack, which is fantastic, giving us a mix of the typical sweeping movie score and traditional Cuban music. And then there's that one song, Beautiful Maria of My Soul, a masterful tune that maaaaay have hit my brain and soul in a way a song hasn't in a while.\n\nSo yeah, pretty solid drama."
