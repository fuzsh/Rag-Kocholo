        "text": "Gamespot said:\n\nBurnout Crash will land this fall on the Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network. As was rumored, it will challenge gamers to maximize the damage done to vehicles and buildings while behind the wheel. No price point was offered for the game.\n\nBurnout Crash sports three game modes across six unique locations, and it boasts 18 crash junctions. Additionally, the game supports the Autolog feature, an online social infrastructure that was first introduced in Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit.\n\nGamespot said:\n\nThe XBLA iteration of Burnout Crash will support Microsoft's gesture-recognition technology, Kinect. The Kinect-enabled game mode has two teams using gesture controls to crash and burn in what EA calls a \"party battle.\"\n\nhttp://www.gamespot.com/events/ea2011/story.html?sid=6322804&tag=topstory;title\n\nParadise is rather boring. Only good part of it was motorbike racing but races for it consisted only of those time trial races which get boring fast. I never even bothered driving cars musc as they all felt like friggin boats. Awful. Plus open world doesn't make it better, it makes it worse. I have enjoyed Burout Takedown, Revenge and Dominator on PS2 far more. And i mean FAAAAAR more.\n\nI have Burnout Paradise on PC though but still, that doens't change the fact that things aren't done too good. Open world might work in GTA series but in most of other games it just made things worse (NFS series and Burnout for example). There were some bright spots but no one ever bothered upgrading the whole thing to a next level. They just jumped the bandwagon so they could brag about having open world in the game.\n\nNFS HP 2010 is far from terrible. It's actually quite brilliant, they'd just have to invest a little bit of time in it. Coz they don't seem to give a damn about it. No balance fixes (SL65 AMG crap is still way way way overpowered car so every race consists of just SL65's despite that class has like 15 cars), no general fixes (weather still doesn't even work in anything but Interceptor games), no anti-cheat features at all. And what i hate the most, even though many of us would gladly buy extra DLC's, they don't even want to sell them to us. I mean have you seen any company that doesn't want your money?\n\nThe driving model with it's crazy drifting is just superb and i wish all NFS's would drive like this. It's fun, feels cool and still requires loads of driving hours to perfect the cornering and drifting."
