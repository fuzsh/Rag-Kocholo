Well, it appears that Electronic Arts is giving the Sony current-gen platforms some love through an all new Burnout game called Burnout Dominator. \"The series was born on the PlayStation 2, and Burnout Dominator is about celebrating the essence of Burnout,\" said Nick Channon, Senior Producer of Burnout Dominator.\"Celebrating the essence\" of the franchise makes this upcoming game sound a lot like PSP's Burnout Legends, which was an amalgamation of various games from the acclaimed series. Considering how excellent Legends was, PSP gamers have a lot to look forward to.(Of course, a DS version wasn't announced. Probably because the first DS Burnout was a horrible idea.)[Via Gamasutra]",
