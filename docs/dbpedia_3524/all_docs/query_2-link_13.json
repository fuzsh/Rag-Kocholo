        "text": "Officials from major developer and publisher Electronic Arts have announced the development of Burnout Dominator, a new entry in the company's crash-centric racing series, exclusively for the PlayStation 2 and PSP. According to EA, the game will shift the focus from traffic checking, prominently featured in the most recent Burnout Revenge, and instead places the emphasis back on trying to avoiding crashes while driving at high speeds. The new title will also challenge players to face off against a series of rivals in several racing challenges involving aggressive driving techniques in an attempt to rack up the highest possible score. Interestingly, the game seems to be a further attempt at providing exclusive experiences on a platform basis, after Burnout Revenge was released on Xbox, PS2, and Xbox 360 home consoles, accompanied by Burnout Legends exclusively for on the Nintendo DS and PSP. While Burnout Dominator is currently in development at EA’s UK Studio team in Guildford, UK, the series' previously announced fifth iteration is in continued development for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The next-generation version of the game is said to step away from the series' emphasis on tracks, and instead adopt a more open, 'sandbox' experience. “The series was born on the PlayStation 2, and Burnout Dominator is about celebrating the essence of Burnout,” commented Nick Channon, the game's senior producer. “Burnout Dominator focuses on the reckless skill-based racing and fear of crashing that fueled the first games.”"
