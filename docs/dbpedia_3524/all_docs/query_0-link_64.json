        "text": "Coches clásicos... bueno, es una pequeña novedad. No me gusta la idea de una única ciudad para todo el juego, pero en fin... ellos verán lo que hacen... No me hice con Burnout Revenge... así de que dependiendo de lo que hagan igual tampoco compro éste.\n\nMás imágenes:\n\nSea una únicaciudad o no, no pinta mal, pero si no lo desarrolla Criterion, me da que la cosa pinta rara.\n\nInfo: http://www.operationburnout.com/index.php?subaction=showfull&id=1165563684&archive=&start_from=&ucat=4&&PHPSESSID=b61434d70ecf1dba66bfc72945949076\n\nPress Release\n\nGuildford, UK - Thursday 7th December 2006 - Get ready for complete and total domination. Electronic Arts (NASAQ: ERTS) today announced that Burnout™ Dominator is in development exclusively for the PlayStation®2 computer entertainment system and PSP® (PlayStation®Portable) system.\n\nBurnout Dominator is an all-new installment of the legendary and multi-award winning Burnout™ series, loaded with intense racing action and dozens of retina-searing World Tour events. Burnout Dominator challenges gamers to face off against a series of hot-blooded rivals in brutal tests of aggressive driving techniques where performing burnouts gives you the advantage and multiplies your score potential. For the ultimate nerve-wracking experience, Burnout Dominator takes you to the very edge of control, punishing the smallest mistakes and rewarding drivers for taking outrageous risks.\n\n\"The series was born on the PlayStation 2, and Burnout Dominator is about celebrating the essence of Burnout,\" said Nick Channon, senior producer of Burnout Dominator. \"Burnout Dominator focuses on the reckless skill-based racing and fear of crashing that fuelled the first games.\"\n\nBurnout Dominator will ship in 2007 under the EA brand and is developed by EA's UK Studio team in Guildford, UK.\n\nGamespot have also added a Q&A about the game with Nick Channon, senior producer at Criterion Games. The interview reveals a lot of new points about the game.\n\nPSP Game Details\n\n- All modes on PSP will be playable in ad hoc\n\n- PSP game will feature \"record breakers\" mode where the user can play a single event on any unlocked track and set records. These records will be tracked and can be shared with friends via Wi-Fi, and the user will also be able to upload high scores to a Web site. We will also be offering some really cool additions to the game via download.\n\n- There has been tuning the car handling specifically for the PSP. It was important that with the new modes we have introduced that the cars feel responsive and that you can really feather the car whilst doing a drift.\n\nPS2 Game Details\n\n- The game features a number of skill-based challenges which are the ultimate test of dangerous driving.\n\n- You'll need to master the art of performing Burnouts; this involves filling your boost bar then completely draining it whilst driving as dangerously as you can. Drain your boost multiple times to perform a Burnout.\n\n- This is the key to earning massive scores in the drift and near miss challenges, and the brand-new maniac mode makes the user put all these skills together to deliver the most dangerous run imaginable."
