        "text": "Racing has been one of the most popular video game genres from almost the moment this industry was born, and it's easy to see why – most people will never get the chance to step into the cockpit of a Formula 1 car or test drive a Ferrari at full speed around a professional race circuit. But through the medium of gaming, anyone can experience some semblance of what these events must feel like – but up until very recently there was a catch. Save for the Carmageddons of this world, most racing titles prior to 2001 totally ignored the concept of high-impact damage – a fact which removed some of the tantalising danger of driving a chunk of expensive metal at insane speeds.\n\nIt would be Criterion's classic 2001 racer Burnout that would right this wrong and give the racing genre a much-needed adrenaline shot of destructive realism. The first game, for PS2, Xbox and GameCube might seem basic now – but it put into the place the core tenets of the franchise.\n\nFinishing first was still the ultimate aim, but the chance to be caught in – and cause – massive pile-ups gave each race a tense feel. Unlike other racers of the period, where contact with another vehicle or piece of roadside scenery would merely slow you down, hitting a solid object in Burnout had the same end result as it would do in the real world: namely, catastrophic destruction.\n\nWhat made Burnout so gloriously thrilling was the fact that while avoiding such a messy end was your prime directive, the closer you got to wrecking your car the quicker you would fill your heart rate meter. Near-misses and driving into oncoming traffic would build your meter faster, and once full you could unleash a turbo boost. This mechanic suited the game perfectly; it delivered a risk-and-reward system which became a trademark of the entire franchise.\n\nBut it would be the crashes which made the original game stand out. Seeing glass shatter and metal flying in all directions provided a visceral reminder that cars are not indestructible, but can bend, break and fall apart when they hit other objects at high speeds. Decades of watching virtual vehicles merely bounce off one another were quickly forgotten, and Burnout became the unlikely saviour of the racing genre. It thrilled players with its wanton destruction and thrilling action, but even when gripped by the game's white-knuckle gameplay, it was clear that there was plenty of room for improvement.\n\nThankfully developer Criterion agreed, and Burnout 2: Point of Impact was a true sequel in every sense of the word; bigger, bolder and infinitely more brash, it arrived a year after the first game and brought with it the now-legendary \"Crash\" and \"Pursuit\" game modes. The former took Burnout's main hook – vehicular destruction – and turned it into a puzzle game. The objective was to drive towards several pre-determined traffic settings and cause as much damage as possible by cannoning into cars, buses, trucks and other moving objects. The variety of environments was impressive, and there seemed to be no limit to the mode's depth – successive plays would reveal new strategies and ways to cause even more carnage. Pursuit took inspiration from the classic Taito coin-op Chase HQ, with the player driving down another car through busy traffic and wrecking it.\n\nBurnout 2 bettered its forerunner in every possible department, but it arguably wouldn't be until 2004’s Burnout 3: Takedown appeared that the series truly hit its stride. The third title took the concept to the next logical stage – proactively inflicting damage on other racers. While this was technically possible in the first two games (you could cause other cars to crash via your actions), Burnout 3: Takedown gave you a more direct means of doing so. Smashing into another racer with enough momentum would total their car, resulting in the now-iconic slow-motion replay of the climatic event. Opponents could also be smashed against walls or pushed into oncoming traffic, or scenery. Wiping out a rival filled your boost meter, offering yet another addictive risk-and-reward mechanic.\n\nEven when you were on the receiving end of a crash, you could turn your car into a deadly weapon via \"Aftertouch Takedowns\". Deft use of the controller would give you the opportunity to impact other racers, meaning that your failure would not be in vain – it was even possible to detonate your car's fuel tank using the \"Crashbreaker\" command, the resultant blast being used to trigger a chain-reaction of carnage. Criterion's graphics engine had evolved so much by this point that you took time to savour every frame of the crash replays, and no two ever seemed to look the same. Burnout's third outing took horrendous motoring accidents and elevated them almost to the point of being an artform.\n\nHowever, that wasn't the only area where Burnout 3 put one over its predecessors. By this point Criterion had come under the wing of super-publisher Electronic Arts, and the veteran firm did a lot to polish up the series even further. Using its wide range of contacts EA gave the game a dynamic soundtrack comprised of the world's most popular rock bands of the time, including My Chemical Romance, Franz Ferdinand, The Ordinary Boys, Fall Out Boy and Jimmy Eat World. Music had arguably been the weakest element of the first two Burnout games, and while it could be argued that Burnout 3's music dates the experience somewhat, the racious tunes were the perfect accompaniment to the on-screen devastation.\n\nThe fourth entry – Burnout Revenge – focused almost entirely on expanding the number of takedown options available to players. Traffic could be used as a weapon – you could nudge same-way traffic into rival racers, executing a \"Traffic Takedown\", while Vertical Takedowns were possible by landing your airborne car onto a hapless opponent.\n\nFinally, Revenge Takedowns made the game more personal: as the name suggests, you could earn extra kudos by eliminating a rival who had previously taken you off the road. Burnout 3's stellar soundtrack set a precedent for the series, and Revenge would feature 41 new tracks from the likes of The Bravery, The Chemical Brothers, Bullet for my Valentine, Maximo Park and Bloc Party. However, Revenge is perhaps most famous for being the first Burnout entry to be available in HD, with an enhanced Xbox 360 version arriving shortly after the PlayStation 2 and Xbox editions.\n\nAs playable as it was, the fourth game in the franchise seemed to be largely covering old ground and Criterion appeared to have taken the standard Burnout concept to its logical conclusion. Something revolutionary was required for the next outing, and 2008’s Burnout Paradise certainly lived up to expectation. Rather than confine players to single circuits, Paradise gave an entire world to explore, with racing occurring at set points but never leaving the massive main world map.\n\nThis sandbox design would lay down the template for Criterion's take on the Need for Speed series and gave Paradise a feeling of almost unlimited depth. The inclusion of online play reinforced this impression even further, and it should come as little surprise to learn that fans are still returning to this seminal release seven years since its launch. Of course, another reason for Paradise's fame is that it remains – at the time of writing – the final chapter in the mainline Burnout series.\n\nThat's not to say we haven't had similar games from Criterion since then, of course. The studio was drafted in to work on EA's million-selling Need for Speed brand, producing Hot Pursuit in 2010, Most Wanted in 2012 and Rivals in 2013. All three of these titles would retain the open world template of Paradise, along with the familiar destructive streak popularised by the Burnout series. The big change with Criterion's Need for Speed outings is the welcome inclusion of real-world cars from manufacturers such as Ferrari, Aston Martin, Nissan and Ford.\n\nHowever, the series which has continued the Burnout pedigree is at something of a crossroads. Alex Ward – one of the leading Burnout team members and creative director of Criterion – has since left the studio he helped to found in order to go indie, and Criterion itself isn't working on a new Need for Speed title. Instead, it’s focusing its energies on a brand new IP which contains ATVs, helicopters and even wingsuits. Ghost Games UK – a studio which employed a large number of ex-Criterion staff and became development custodian of the Need for Speed series – was in 2014 subject to a large number of layoffs, and it is rumoured that the Need for Speed game the company was working on is now on hold.\n\nWhile the future of the series is surely not in doubt – it's too big a name for EA to simply ignore – it would appear that Criterion's involvement is now at an end, and we may never see another Need for Speed title which showcases the unmistakable DNA of Burnout. It's a bitter end to an amazing ride, but at least we have over a decade of fond memories and amazing games to fall back on. And, hey, if Viacom can resurrect Rock Band after a long dormant period, never say never."
