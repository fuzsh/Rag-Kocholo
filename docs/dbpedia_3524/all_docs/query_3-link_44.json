After staring at balls for two years, he became a freelancer where he contracted porting responsibilities for OLO Loco. Thoroughly depressed with freelance life and looking to improve his pool game, he joined Fireproof as Technical Designer in 2021.\n\nBarry\n\nCommercial Director & Co-Founder\n\nBarry’s career began in Dublin in 1992 working on 'edutainment' titles for SNES, Amiga and PC. In 1994 he joined Bullfrog in the UK as lead designer and artist/animator on Magic Carpet, Syndicate Wars, Dungeon Keeper and many others. Game designer roles followed at Acclaim, Negative Productions & Mucky Foot before joining Criterion in 2004 working on Black and subsequently Burnouts 3, 4 and Paradise. In 2008 Barry and five friends left Criterion to form Fireproof Studios.\n\nChris\n\nLead Design/Artist & Co-Founder\n\nGraduating in Computer Animation from Teeside University in 2000 Chris worked in many roles from storyboards to scene modelling & animation before joining Criterion Games in 2005. While working on Burnout Revenge, Burnout Dominator & Burnout Paradise he progressed from Graduate artist/tea monkey to Track & Gameplay Designer/Artist before leaving in 2008 to co-found Fireproof Studios.\n\nChris\n\nSenior Animator\n\nChris studied animation at Duncan of Jordanstone Collage of Art & Design in Dundee, graduating in 2009. His career in animation began in 2010 when he relocated to London to join VFX studio Jellyfish Pictures, working on the BBC’s Planet Dinosaur series. Over the next 11 years at the company, he worked on a host of different projects including documentaries, advertising campaigns, tv shows and feature films. In 2021 he decided that a change of scene was needed, and his skills could be put to good use in the world of videogames.\n\nDamien\n\nLead Artist & Co-Founder\n\nDamien’s videogames career began at Rebellion, where he worked on the first Sniper Elite game on PS2 & Xbox. In 2004 Damien joined Criterion Games and found himself working on the critically acclaimed Burnout series and Black.

He cut his teeth on Burnout 3: Takedown, and went on to make Burnout Revenge & Burnout Paradise as a Senior Environment Artist. He was also a level lead on Criterion's first FPS, BLACK. Dave left Criterion Games in 2008 to form Fireproof Studios with 5 other mates.\n\nDave\n\nSenior Software Engineer\n\nIn 2006 Dave was forced into making video games to pay off his online poker debts. He first started at Criterion coding physics on Burnout Paradise, and developing car crashing tech with Rob. Since then he shipped Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit and was physics lead on Need for Speed: Most Wanted. After 7 years of coding physics and car handling he was thoroughly bored of driving games, and jumped at the chance to reunite with the team at Fireproof.\n\nDerek\n\nSenior Artist\n\nDerek entered the games industry in 1998 at Bits studio and worked on Constantine and Die Hard Vendetta.

He then joined Fireproof in 2011 and made the magic happen.\n\nEthan Prime\n\nSoftware Engineer\n\nEthan has always had a passion for video games, which was joined by a passion for coding as he learnt to be a genius programmer. After graduating from the University of Southampton in 2022, with a masters in computer science, he was dead set on entering the video game industry. Hearing that Fireproof were looking for a Software Engineer to join the team and work closely with their Senior Engineers, he jumped at this great opportunity.\n\nJeremy\n\nDesigner\n\nJeremy’s career in the games industry began at Supermassive Games where he worked as designer on Tumble (the finest motion controlled, block-stacking physics puzzle game on PS3) and Start the Party: Save the World (the finest Start the Party game since Start the Party). He joined Fireproof in 2013 because they said he could and that was just fine by him. His free time is spent playing games, arguing and playing games which involve arguing.\n\nKarol\n\nVFX Artist\n\nAfter graduating in Computer Games Development from the University of South Wales in 2020, Karol spent a few months polishing up his portfolio with the aim of progressing in technical art. Karol was hired by Freejam in 2021 as a Junior VFX and Technical Artist on Techblox, though after 9 months heard that Fireproof Games needed a full-time VFX Artist, so after a short interview process he joined in spring 2022.\n\nKat Talar\n\nConcept Artist\n\nKat’s love for art and videogames reaches back as far as she can remember, but it was graduating in European Engineering Business Management which served as a wake up call to rethink her career and pursue her creative passions instead. Since then she has bounced around many interesting places, from an Oscar winning stop motion animation studio to various gaming companies to finally be adopted by the wonderful world of Fireproof.\n\nLyndon\n\nSenior Artist\n\nLyndon studied Games Design at Teesside University in 2000.

In 2010 Lyndon left Criterion to join Fireproof Studios.\n\nMark\n\nDesign Director & Co-Founder\n\nAfter studying Architecture & Engineering at Strathclyde University Mark realised that 3D modelling was far more interesting than Building Regulations and BREDEM calculations, so he applied for a job at Criterion Games.

After 4 years of programming character into Harry Potter, he'd had enough of wizardry and joined Supermassive Games, where he worked on the Start the Party games and the BBC title Walking with Dinosaurs.

After a year he moved South of the wall to work as part of the production team at London VFX studio Jellyfish Pictures. He gained credits on multiple projects including Rogue One: A Star Wars Story and Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi before deciding he missed the games industry too much. With that being the case, Fireproof answered the call to adopt him in 2018.\n\nTony\n\nLead Artist & Co-Founder\n\nTony began his career in art so far back now (though not as far back as Barry) that he can’t really remember how it all started. During the course of his career he has worked for a several game companies, some that he would prefer not to mention, working on titles that he’d also prefer not to mention. Then he joined Criterion, creating artwork for the Burnout games and Black. Since co-founding Fireproof he has worked on almost a million (estimated figure) other awesome games.\n\nVesper Chu\n\nTechnical Artist\n\nVesper was educated at art college, though she always nurtured a strong interest in technology and videogames. During her time at University College London, she enjoyed working on several indie games and developed a passion for game development.
