        "text": "Anyways, like in the first devlog for Redline: Overdrive, I revealed some of pictures of what will eventually become the title screen and the cars that will be featured in the game, I have made a start on a test track environment and created some menu mockups using Canva. This is to try and give an idea of the stage of development the game is at.\n\nBelow are some screenshots:\n\nTest track images (WIP)\n\nMain Menu mockup screen\n\nWorld Tour select screen mockup.\n\nAs you can see I created a couple of mockup menu screens using Canva. These are ideas for what the main menu of the game but also the world tour screen of the game could look like. These are early designs so may change later on into development. For the world tour I decided to add a bit on the bottom which would track vehicles unlocked but also medals earned from events and championships completed as the game will have 4. I also wanted to go with red for the title name and grey for the subtitle as that design was inspired by games such as Burnout Legends, Burnout Revenge & Burnout Dominator.\n\nJust to note that in one image it shows some of the player vehicles in different colours which will hint that each car except some will have some form of colour selection that being 6 with the exception of the Police Cruiser which will only have 4. To also add on, the traffic will use a pathfinding system which will be added in later on so they can stay on the roads but also pass through the track chevron/no entry barriers which will be designed to block the player off from going out of the track. Traffic will also spawn/despawn from those areas but make their way onto the track. They will be designed to despawn from the track after a crash caused by the player or rivals and a new one spawn in its place. Rivals will use something similar to the Police AI as they will drive aggressively and will constantly target the player but will also be designed to target/attack each other.\n\nAnother thing I’d like to talk about is that the world tour. This will be the main career mode for the game but also the main way of progressing through the game to unlock new cars and tracks. How it will work is that the player will have to complete all events within one region to move onto the next and play through all events in order. Players will need to attain at least a bronze medal to progress onto the next event except for Hot Pursuit & Showdown by reaching the end of the track without taking 10 hits or getting busted or finishing 1st as the player will need to attain a gold medal to progress but these events will take place on the Point to Point tracks only.\n\nThat’s all I want to talk about for this devlog but I do plan on creating a demo soon using the test track map for people to get an idea of what to expect in the final game but also use it to test things post launch.\n\nAs always, feedback, suggestions or improvements are welcomed."
