        "text": "And they need your help.\n\nhttp://nextcargame.com/\n\nFlatout/offroad-racing fans have been constantly nagging Bugbear to release a new game, true to the roots of Flatout. Unfortunately, publisher demands have prevented them from making the kind of games they want to make (see: Sega Rally and Ridge Racer Unbounded). Now they've decided to forgo publishers completely and opt for community funding instead. They now have complete freedom to create the offroad driving game that people want.\n\nFor as little as $25, you can pre-order the game and also have access to an early build when it becomes available. People who pay more money will get some other goodies as well. The working title for the game is currently \"Next Car Game\"; it sounds a bit silly, but I suspect it might change sometime later on.\n\nIf you enjoy Flatout, then you should absolutely look into this. If you're not convinced, watch the video on their page for a small taste of what it will be like. Look at those glorious vehicle physics and destruction. It puts Burnout to shame.\n\nEdit: Here's the Steam Greenlight page - http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=176123360\n\nHere some new info about NCG pre-oders:\n\nwebsite pre-order vs steam??\n\nJoonas Laakso said:\n\ncrazychris4124 said:\n\ni also posted this on steam but\n\nwill there be any difference between those who purchased on steam and those who purchased on your website?? i got the wrecker edition which gives me a bonus car\n\nWe're not sure yet how we're going to structure the Steam Early Access. Likely it's a one size fits all deal (low price and just the game); if you want the good stuff, you need to pre-order from us. We really prefer pre-orders from us as that leaves us with considerably more of the money.\n\nPre-orders from us do come with Steam keys now that we're through Greenlight (once we have a Steam build available, naturally).\n\nHere it is, Bugbear has release video of some ingame racing on a dirt track.\n\nNote: This is pre-alpha build of Next Car Game.\n\nTeam Bugbear -\n\nThis is the moment youve all been waiting for: were finally ready to show you some proper racing action on a dirt track! Here we are testing with a powerful rear-wheel drive car how our handling works on gravel, and were glad to let you know that it feels SUPERB!\n\nThanks to our great physics, you really get the full white-knuckle racing experience with Next Car Game, if thats what you prefer. On the other hand, if youre a budding race car driver, you can still enjoy the game (and remain competitive!) by enabling a selection of driving aids.\n\nPlease note that the game is still very much work-in-progress, and what you see is not representative of the final quality. For example the track has not been properly decorated yet, and theres a lot of additional polish thats going to be done on it. Also, the player car damage has been disabled for the demonstration purposes.\n\nCheck out the video on our Kickstarter page and let us know what you think!\n\nAs you know, we still have a plenty of distance to cover if were going to succeed with our Kickstarter campaign, but you can help us meet our goal. Now its time for the racing game fans to unite and show us that you want a game like Next Car Game! Our team is having great fun playing the game, and we feel that no other game can match the amazing racing experience offered by Next Car Game. We cant wait to share it with you!\n\nPLEASE SUPPORT US AND SPREAD THE WORD!\n\nAs a bonus, heres a few new screenshots from the same track:\n\nThe Kickstarter campaign slowed down this last week, with only about 2 weeks left, Flatout fans need to get the word out and support Bugbear so they can give us the extra features they would like to add to NCG game. After watching video and you know you going want to buy Bugbear new derby/racing, go pledge $20 and pickup NCG cheap. Pledge $30 and you get to test out alpha/Early Access version later on.\n\nBugbear of Flatout fame, has release new sneak peek playground demo for players that pre-ordered their new derby/racing game. Bugbear has taken their damage model from the Flatout series to a whole new level!!\n\nYou like soft body car damage, checkout the soft body damage being done in this video I did:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgrO9eMxysw\n\nIf like what you see, be sure to head on over to Bugbear pre-order page and get your pre-order in and get link to sneak peek demo and show your support for Bugbear who is trying to go without a publisher this time around. And yes the \"Next Car Game\" has been already Greenlighted on Steam. Will see Steam early access ( alpha version ) in the near future. Maybe full game get release in May 2014 if Bugbear stay on schedule.\n\nhttp://nextcargame.com/pre-order/\n\nHere some more big news from Bugbear this Sunday:\n\n24 cars on track - GREAT! And a quick question\n\nJanne Suur-Näkki said:\n\nWell, more cars was one thing that you guys were asking, wasn't it?\n\nUnless something major comes up, we will keep the 24 cars for the full game at least for offline play. We have been already testing track races and derbies with the full grid of 24 cars, and thanks to our efficient tech, the performance hit is surprisingly minor. The chief problem is that, as you can imagine, the tracks get extremely crowded since most of them have been designed for a lesser amount of cars, so the going gets quickly very rough. But of course that's something that can be worked around, so it's not really going to pose a problem.\n\nOnline is something that we cannot confirm yet.\n\nHere a good video of guy enjoying the sneak peek video:\n\nLGR Plays : Bugbear's Next Car Game\n\nNew sneak peek V2.0 is out. Has a new toy to play with, an object canon that can fire spheres and rockets and can pick objects from the playground and fire them too.\n\nThis is my idea for a new derby mode for Bugbear \"Next Car Game\". I suggest using the sneak peek canyon in a derby.\n\nI'm thinking online we could use the spheres or the rockets to wreck the other player's cars. This mode could be last man standing or do a deathmatch with respawns. Deathmatch would have a time limit, say 4 mins, who ever gets the most kills, win the match. I'm not a fan of respawns in a derby, but in a deathmatch mode I be OK with it. Cars would need to ghost for a few seconds after respawn so players could not camp respawn spots for easy kills.\n\nI also think canon derby mode would work good for Team derbys.\n\nNot sure if this mode would work offline with the AI. So I suggest in an offline canon derby, you use a free camera mode and are give a time limit to wreck all 23 AI with the canon.\n\nOne problem I see with this mode that would need some tweaking, is how fast you can fire spheres or rockets. I don't think it be good for this mode it you can rapid fire the spheres/rockets. Should only be able to fire 1 object per second. and if that too fast, make it 1 object fire every 2 seconds.\n\nBugbear could use existing derby pits, no need for new derby pits, unless Bugbear put this mode into the sneak peek playground.\n\nSo what you guys think?\n\nNew derby mode with the sneak peek canon? video\n\nI started new thread over at Bugbear forum: New derby mode with the sneak peek canon?\n\nStress test, how many balls can your computer juggle ( 58 FPS )?\n\ni5 2500 and a nvidia 660 ( 10 FPS )\n\nOK this weekend I tried my hand at derby pit making. Here repost of my posts I did over at Bugbear forum:\n\nEasy to make your own \"custom\" track or derby pit in Sneak Peek demo v2.0.\n\nPurple44 said:\n\nTried my hand at making a derby pit with the v2.0 Sneak Peek using object cannon.\n\nFirst try I use the big red part of the car crusher to outline the derby pit. I started the playground and let the AI come in a little closer, then hit Esc and disable the AI cars. then I circle the cars. This derby pit felt to big.\n\nSecond try I let the AI cars come closer, then disable them, then use my car to push AI into a tighter circle. This time I tried using the car crusher long roller to outline derby pit, but rollers sometimes rolled into the cars. I tried 3 times to make derby pit with rollers, after screwing up the third time, I went with a shorter car crusher roller.\n\nProblem with this derby pit, AI cars were getting stuck in the holes some the rollers made. And most the AI ending up resetting outside derby pit eventually.\n\nThird try I did not push the AI cars as far in as In did on second derby pit. This time I use the end of a spinner for object cannon. This object gave me better control in dropping them. But had to put a lot more objects to encircle the pit. AI cars not getting stuck as much with the spinner object, but AI still resetting out side of derby arena. Lot of work to do a short live derby and \"repair all\" option only repairs your car, not the AI.\n\nMaybe have some video uploaded later today.\n\nSneak peek not design to do derbys, but had to give it a try and see if it was possible to have a good derby with the AI in close quarters.\n\nPurple44 said:\n\nGot my derby pit video uploaded today:\n\nv2.0 Sneak Peek derby pits using object cannon.\n\nPurple44 said:\n\nI decide to do one more derby pit. This time I just push about a 1/3 the AI cars towards middle of derby pit. The other 2/3 AI cars I left alone. These cars should reset inside of derby pit this time.\n\nHere video of new derby pit:\n\nv2.0 Sneak Peek derby pit, part 2.\n\nFor a close up of car damage, you can jump ahead to 21:55.\n\n******************************\n\nIf Sneak Peek playground is release with final release version of NCG , I hope Bugbear will also include a Sneak Peek derby pit with all 24 cars inside it, with the physics of the playground demo. And include the object cannon with rockets.\n\nIf you have not heard yet, Bugbear has sent out emails Saturday to those that have pre-order the Next Car Game, with a link to Steam key for NCG pre-alpha. The pre-alpha has the muscle car from Sneak Peek demo and also the small Euro car. There 1 derby pit, 1 dirt track and 1 tarmac track. Can select 12 car or 24 car race or derby.\n\nYou can remap your wheel, pad or KB now. Also you can go with all assists ON or better yet turn all assists OFF. All assists off, with a wheel on the dirt is fun drifting the car around the corners.\n\nHere a post from a Bugbear Dev:\n\nhttp://community.bugbeargames.com/index.php/topic,1659.msg17929.html#msg17929\n\nJanne Suur-Näkki said:\n\nThanks guys, we're really happy to hear you're having such a great experience. To be honest, we didn't have too much time for testing to get the release out in time for the holidays, so we were a bit anxious about the quality of the build. Like I think I already stated elsewhere, there are quite a few issues that need to be fixed, but luckily they should not be too detrimental to the experience at this point.\n\nWe're also really happy that the first build is finally out because it means that we have pretty much nailed all the boring (to any of our coders reading this, sorry!) stuff and can finally concentrate on building the game around the base we now have. That means more tracks with more content, more cars, proper upgrading, better driving dynamics, and so on, and of course a lot of fine-tuning to everything that we already have.\n\nOf course you guys will be first ones to enjoy all the improvements first-hand with our future Early Access releases.\n\nCheckout this thread for some videos and pics:\n\nEarly Access Videos/Photos\n\nThanks to all them youtude videos of the Sneak Peek playground demo and the pre-alpha release before Christmas, Bugbear has now reach their 10,000 pre-order goal:\n\nEarly Access through Steam.\n\n16,885 Backers\n\n$ 491,331\n\nNext Car Game - Early Access Pre-Alpha Gameplay - video\n\nNow Bugbear can take some extra time and add some extra stuff they want to do before releasing Next Car Game. And no middle man publisher to screw things up!!\n\nBugbear >>>\n\nWhy Do We Need Your Help?\n\nIts actually very simple. This is not going to be a small game, we have a lot of ambition on what Next Car Game could be. Weve invested over one million dollars into the game already. This would normally be the time when we go looking for a publisher to take us the rest of the way. This time, however, we want to make the game that we want  the game that you want  not the game that a publisher wants. Making games costs some serious money, but if everything goes well, well have a great, tight-knit community thats going to support a lot of awesome content over the years!\n\nWe at Bugbear have a long track-record of making high-octane racing games, and we know that we can pull it through with your support. Weve been making racing games for over 13 years, and this is our tenth (10 !) game. Were recreating a type of experience weve already shipped three times on four different platforms, so we do know what were doing.\n\n\"Next Car Game\" pre-order may go live on Steam this month and hopefully Bugbear will have pick the official new name for NCG."
