        "text": "God, I’ve missed the soundtrack. When Burnout Paradise was released in 2008 it was one of the first racing games of its kind — a breakneck paced bullet-speed ride through a richly saturated city, where the racers rule the road and blast Guns’n’Roses and indie rock out of their in-car radios. It’s a dumb, absurd concept but it absolutely worked, wrenching the Burnout series away from its roots into the open world. It ditched circuits, abandoned any concept of laps, and instead asked “what if we just set the start and finish lines and let the player decide how to get there?”\n\nIt was a bold move then and, even now, after several iterations of Need For Speed and the rise of Forza Horizon, you can feel what a breath of fresh air it was to be given such a free open road on which to wage automotive war. Having played its predecessor, Burnout Revenge, for god knows how many hours in my youth (for my sins), I was ranked 10th in the global online leaderboards — the release of Burnout Paradise came with tentative doubts about what the franchise would become. Was it going to become a lesser racer? As it happened, Paradise ended up being the last Burnout game to date. It was a climax I didn’t expect to rise as high as it did.\n\nTo play it now comes with several considerations. It’s still an incredible racer that starts unbelievably fast and gets even faster, to the point you’ll wonder how you navigate the criss-crossed maze of Paradise City without crashing constantly, but there are foibles that were acceptable in 2008 and are unavoidable now. There’s no fast travel. Changing your car is a bothersome annoyance, too, forcing you to drive to preset destinations across the city to switch. They’re not dreadful hindrances but they are noticeable, especially if you’ve kept up with the genre these past ten years.\n\nPlaying on a PS4 Pro or Xbox One X, you get the access to full 4K visuals, while base hardware gets 1080p resolution. It’s a nice visual bump but, again, it’s not a major overhaul. With an abundance of lower resolution textures, it especially stands out after last month’s absolutely remarkable Shadow Of The Colossus remake. In a way, it’s a little disingenuous for publisher EA to price this as highly as it has. For £30, this is more a scaled up re-release than a proper remaster.\n\nBesides this, it’s a testament to how good Burnout Paradise was that ten years later it’s still a joy to play. The catapulting effect of the boost button; the way every single billboard, jump or gate to smash is emblazoned with colour just so you don’t miss them at ridiculous speeds; the fact there’s a multitude of entirely different events, all of which challenge you to different skills as you dart about the city. It’s a brilliant racer that’s tightly tuned to deliver some of the best point-to-point track action you can find.\n\nYou’ll almost never touch the brake, while hitting the e-brake ever so slightly results in exaggerated, satisfying drifts that can go for miles if you let them. Dodging oncoming traffic and committing daring takedowns on other racers — which deliver some of the most violent crashes in video games — nets you more boost, which in turn lets you go faster and faster. Your only real consideration is which way to go next. With no traditional circuits, *Burnout Paradise *instead lets you choose the routes, relying on the on-screen compass to check the best way to go next. It takes some learning at such high velocity.\n\nAs well as the base game, Remastered comes with the entire \"Big Surf Island\", \"Cops And Robbers\" and \"Burnout Bikes\" add-ons. It’s all nice to have, but I don’t quite understand why the game allows you to access some of the additional cars from get go. While it’s cool to get a broader choice, it actively destroys the sense of progression – rather than work your way through faster cars, you just get the strongest, fastest and most stunt-adept vehicles without any effort. I was winning some races head and shoulders above any of my opponents.\n\nIt’s a strange choice but one that doesn’t ruin the game, providing you play it as you’re supposed to. Do that, and Burnout Paradise is pretty much everything it was a decade ago, plus a little bit more. There’s still a lot to love in this insane piece of racing game history.\n\nOut on 16 March for Xbox One and PS4\n\nLike this?
