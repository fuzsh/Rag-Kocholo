        "text": "1 it is a good and all although we need more stuff and other cars like kranky and other ones we the stuff like the headers you need to buy a car for six dollars just to get a header and all the other stuff that the car has like I keep on trying to get me mum to buy them but she wonât let me I can not make kranky and other cars because there are not that much stuff in it\n\n2 the garage it should be buy more cars the bigger it gets like we need an update for the game to get more stuff added to the game like I want to get more money really fast and when I do to make car I find out I have no space for it so I have to sell a car and that is all so put in an update and add more stuff and add kranky and more cars make the garage less expensive\n\nThis game has been the best game for burnouts ever. The pricing for the pro cars is spot on and there is a good range of cars. However I would like to see more customisation for the cars, like the ability to add decals or change the style of your number plate (WA,NSW,VIC,ACT,QLD,NT,SA) for the final note the smoke could use a little work so it is affected by the exhaust placement how most burnout cars have straight pipes, the smoke gets blown backwards or how side pipes blow the smoke outward. One more thing is how the supercharger whine is pitched and affected, so the pitch of the whine can be lower and when in an event the whine is really loud towards the camera but when itâs does a tip in and faces away from the camera it quiets down and all you hear is the engine. However this game is an absolute life saver and keep up the great work Road Burn Games ð¤ð¼ One last thing could you guys add the VH commodore, FRYLC, BLWNVK, SKDUTE, CUTSIK, McFRY and LOOKOUT as pro cars, Holden HR and a LandCruiser 79 series and LX Torana sedan. For engine swaps a Cummins diesel engine, 510 cube v8, 8.9L v8 hemi used in Top Fuel dragsters, RB26 and 1UZ, more cosmetic items, parachutes, wheelie bar, more exhaust exits, roll cage, bucket seats, customise the size of the bonnet cut out and some more rims please. If this finds you (team at Road burn games)I will absolutely jump for joy and scream WHOO!!ðð¤ð¼\n\nThis game is amazing and just a great game, I cannot thank you enough. This game has probably saved me multiple times because lately, as in the past few years Iâve been a bit suicidmle,but this game has genuinely made my life better I couldnât leave all of my progress just there so I had to stay. Itâs an amazing game I would have some suggestions though as in 1. In the suspension with tilt it tilts forwards more than it does backwards so it would be good for the back to tilt the same if not more than front. 2. Please can we have the old paint texture back like how it was all shiny yeah like that. 3. Can you make it so if you put on drag grip it doesnât slide around a bunch. 4. Same with drag grip but with sport grip or at least have something in settings like that. 5. This one isnât really a suggestion itâs more of âI think this would be coolâ which is basically the same but trucks as in semi trucks they would be soo cool. 6. I think thatâs it that I can remember but thank you so much and also these are just suggestions the game is amazing how it is. -Charley (or Jim if youâre using my in game name)"
