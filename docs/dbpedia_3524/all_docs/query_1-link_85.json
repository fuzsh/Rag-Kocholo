Might as well save another $5 since you already bought it. The PriceGrabber bonus is still up for grabs.\n\nI'd say Legends, it has much better gameplay modes and looks a bit cleaner.\n\nDominator isn't a bad game though.\n\nI've had both and Legends is much better. I don't like the Boost system in Dominator.\n\nIsn't Legends essentially a remake of Burnout 3 while Dominator's a love note to Burnout 2? That would mean that whatever style of Burnout you prefer is the game you should get. I didn't get into the series until 3, so Legends is the game I'd get.\n\nLooks like I made the right choice. Burnout 3 was the first I played."
