I'm not sure, but I remember a discussion around Burnout 3's release that the PS2 version had better motion blur while the Xbox version had sharper textures. You'd have to use the search function though to get a definite answer on that one though. Perhaps \"Revenge\" isn't much different?\n\nLunchBox said:\n\nThis is more an inquiry.\n\nMy friend has told me that he read an article saying that the PS2 version of Burnout: Revenge is better than the Xbox version.

If there's anything else, it would mainly be due to the fact that it's a game built for PS2 as the lead platform, so most of the effort would go into PS2 development.\n\nlondon-boy said:\n\nWell like Phil said, if it's true, the Xbox version will still have sharper textures, and the PS2 version might just have better looking effects like particles and framebuffer effects like motion blur.

Because the PS2 version has a noticeable superior particle effects. Many thought it was some sort of EA conspiracy against Xbox.\n\n.Z\n\nHardly a conspiracy. They want to sell as amny titles on Xbox as they can. Botching the Xbox version would be stupid.\n\nWhat did happen is that the version with most development resources behind it will most likely be more polished and more optimised for that platform.\n\nEA felt the Xbox version was fine like it was and didn't find it worth it to push that version more.\n\nI heard that the PS2 version shows more \"particles\" than the Xbox version. Therefor making the crashes more eye popping. I can't tell you from personal experience, but I also can't believe that the PS2 version would look better than the Xbox version...unless it was botched but like L-B pointed out...why would a company do that when their ultimate goal is to sell more games...\n\n...unless..ULTERIOR MOTIVES\n\nDifferences\n\nstuart_r said:\n\nThe lighting on the PS2 version does look cool though ;-)\n\nThere are advantages in both consoles but here are most noticable differences:\n\nXbox\n\ntextures\n\nPS2\n\nlighting\n\nparticles\n\nNot so surprising the same situation as Burnout 3.\n\nAlso, Criterion says both versions developed independantly. Up to you to decide what you choose to believe but given that either version is among the best of either console in appearance and frame-rate I think its fair claim. Criterion also said with Burnout 3 release that they are beginnning to get better performance from PS2 than Xbox, very rare for cross-platform games but not first time.\n\nOutrun2?\n\nLazy8s said:\n\nCriterion said that they design the Burnouts around the PS2 yet program each console's version with a fully custom engine. The PS2 rev of parts 3 and Revenge have better post processing effects while the Xbox versions have a clearer and more stable graphics.\n\nOutRun 2 and 2SP are better representations of the Xbox architecture's capabilities.\n\nWhat is 2SP?\n\nAlso, maybe it is matter of taste, but I found outrun2 weaker than most top range xbox games. Positive is main car model, certain environment objects, appearance of water and draw-distance but compromise is LOD is very noticable, lighting/reflections on other cars not so impressive, and handling is very innaccurate represenation of real life. Also, a bit more cartoon style than Burnout, Forza, PGR2 no?"
