        "text": "All those whoâve been with us for a while should know Iâm a complete Burnout whore and will lap up anything Burnout. Even though I never got to play the first two Burnout games, I played Takedown for nearly a year (yes, I loved it that much) and was quick to follow the obsession up with Revenge for another year on the PS2 as well as the Xbox 360.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEvery one knew this series would make the transition to next gen consoles one day and as expected, Criterionâs Alex Ward confirmed the development of a next gen Burnout for the PS3 as well as the Xbox 360. I was beyond elated when I heard this since Iâm fortunate enough to own 360 but what off all the people who owned only the PS2? Would this be the end for the Burnout franchise for them?\n\nWell apparently not since the lads at Criterion are a pretty considerate bunch and have released the final current gen Burnout title exclusively for the PS2 and the PSP. Enter Burnout Dominator&mldr;\n\nYes, itâs awesome and yes, itâs time to rejoice but there are some things you need to know before you dive into the game headfirst. First and foremost, traffic checking has been removed; thatâs right folks, cry all you want, no more slamming into cars traveling in the same direction; itâs all about driving like a maniac WITHOUT hitting traffic now. The reason Criterion decided to axe this feature from Dominator is probably because after Revenge many fans of the series felt the series had become too simple and so theyâve gone ahead and listened to those whiners for a change. This may disappoint lots and I know tons of people from work who were really put off by this, but I for one find the game a lot more challenging now since itâs like Takedown all over again.\n\n__PAGEBREAK__\n\nOk this one is probably going to make you strangle your pet cat but Iâm still going to give it to ya&mldr; straight up! Criterion have axed Crash Junction from Dominator as well so you will not be able to ram your vehicle into crowded junctions to cause massive pileups anymore. Now this move I cannot understand since this was one feature even the whiners loved and axing this has really pissed people off. Some feel Criterion just didnât have the time to work on a good Crash mode and that Dominator is a rushed project while some feel this was a conscious decision made by the English developer since they have something even bigger planned for Burnout V and since Criterion havenât disappointed me all that much, Iâll stick with the latter as of now.\n\nThe last and probably the most insignificant of them all is the removal of Signature Takedowns, in the place of which we now have Signature Shortcuts thatâll open up a whole new route for you as and when you take your opponent out through the barrier of a shortcut entrance.\n\nOk so we donât have Traffic Checking, nor do we have Crash Junction, so why should you play this game? Well honestly speaking if all the above mentioned stuff has turned you off, thereâs really nothing thatâll motivate you to play it, but if you like the speed and the reckless driving this series has to offer, Dominator does not disappoint as it still retains the sense of speed synonymous with Burnout games.\n\nWhat it also gives you, is the ability to chain burnouts once again, which is what the gameâs all about at the end of the day. First of all in case you havenât played older Burnouts, hereâs a slight lowdown on how this mechanic works; you have to constantly drive recklessly (near misses, driving on the wrong side of the road and so on) to earn boost, but wait, you canât use it just yet; you have to fill the entire bar up and once thatâs done itâll turn to blue indicating itâs time to let the supercharge rip. Once you start burning all your supercharge, youâll have to continue driving recklessly to recharge it (yeah itâs a little confusing) and upon successfully refilling this supercharge gauge you perform a burnout chain. Chaining burnouts does take sometime to get used too but thereâs something weirdly satisfying about trying to chain as many Burnouts as you can before crashing into an oncoming vehicle.\n\n__PAGEBREAK__\n\nLike I said earlier, Chaining burnouts is the name of the game here and is the key to dominating all of Dominatorâs game modes be it Road Rage (thank God we still have this), Maniac Mode (driving like a loon to earn high scores) the Near Miss challenge (trading paint with other vehicles) or the crowd favorite Drift challenge.\n\nVisually the gameâs a mixed bag; if like me youâve been playing Revenge for the 360, this game is downright hideous and will make you cringe with all those ugly jaggies synonymous with most PS2 games, but if you havenât been spoilt by next gen visuals, it looks pretty much the same as Revenge did and as usual, the frame rate holds up extremely well throughout most of the game. One thing I really liked about the game was its presentation and all the loading menus which as usual look ultra cool. I wasnât too happy with the gameâs OST since it was waaaaay too teen oriented for my linking; I mean punk rock and angry music is cool but a song by Avril Lavigne&mldr; in four different languages??!! Come on people, Iâm really trying hard to like the game but itâs this kind of stuff thatâll push me into “Dominator sux b***z” territory.\n\nEven though Dominator may not be all of us imagined it to be, itâs still pretty entertaining and should provide you with enough fast paced hyper-kinetic racing till we get our hands on the next gen iteration of this series. If you liked Takedown, youâll love this game but if youâve gotten used to Traffic Checking, kindly stay away from this game as itâll only end up frustrating you.\n\nAnd hey, if it helps, donât look at Dominator as a full fledged game; think of it as an expansion pack and your probably wonât feel all that cheated."
