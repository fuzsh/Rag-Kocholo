        "text": "Complaints from the public have prompted the Advertising Standards Authority to ban an ad for Burnout Dominator in the UK. Thirty-seven separate complaints were lodged about the poster, which featured a crashed car and the tag line \"Inner Peace Through Outer Violence.\"\n\nEA's stance was that the image was meant to imply that playing Burnout Dominator was a good way to relieve real-life stress, but the ASA wasn't buying it:\n\nWe considered that the images of a car that seemed to have crashed at high speed and a burning tyre, together with a reference to violence, could be seen to condone a violent lifestyle, anti-social behaviour or dangerous driving. We concluded that the ad was irresponsible.\n\nNormally, I think these sorts of complaints are little more than the blatherings of oversensitive ninnies, but in this case, I must admit I really do see their point. Though EA's explanation of the ad does make sense, there's definitely a lot of room left for interpretation, especially if you have no idea what the Burnout games are all about.\n\nViolent advert banned from Tube [Metro, via Next-Gen]\n\nThe 20 Best Movies on Amazon Prime Right Now\n\nThe Idea of You, Brittany Runs a Marathon, and American Fiction are just a few of the movies you should be watching on Amazon Prime Video this week.\n\nThe 30 Best Movies on Max (aka HBO Max) Right Now\n\nLove Lies Bleeding, Dune: Part Two, and Beetlejuice are just a few of the movies you should be watching on Max this month.\n\nThe 29 Best Shows on Apple TV+ Right Now\n\nSunny, Constellation, and Presumed Innocent are among the best shows on Apple TV+ this month.\n\nThe 52 Best Shows on Disney+ Right Now\n\nArctic Ascent With Alex Honnold, X-Men ’97, and Star Wars: Young Jedi Adventures are just a few of the shows you should be watching on Disney+ this month.\n\nFortnite Has a Political Violence Problem\n\nIn a report shared exclusively with WIRED, the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism says it found more than a dozen user-generated games on Fortnite that featured antisemitism and political violence.\n\nThe Trump Shooting Fueled an Online Sticker Battle\n\nAfter the attempted assassination of former president Donald Trump last weekend, Sticker Mule sent messages to customers suggesting they back Trump and asking to “stop the hate.” That’s not what happened.\n\nThe Inevitability of Big Tech Backing Trump\n\nSilicon Valley, fueled by greed and acting in its own calculated interest, seeks to influence the 2024 presidential election.
