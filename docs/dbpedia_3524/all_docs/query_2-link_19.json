        "text": "Description\n\nBurnout Dominator is an installment of the Burnout series for the PlayStation 2 and the PlayStation Portable systems.\n\nThe game is mainly focused on the returned burnouts feature – draining a complete boost meter without stopping which was last seen in Burnout 2: Point of Impact (2004). With return of burnouts feature there were four new game modes added including:\n\nManiac Mode – Players need to drive dangerously to get highest scores by earning drifts, air, oncoming and near misses. Chaining burnouts in this mode increases the score multiplier.\n\nDrift Challenge – Players need to obtain as many feet of drifting as possible. Chaining burnouts also increases the score multiplier here.\n\nNear Miss Challenge – Similar as Drift Challenge, but player needs to score near miss bonuses.\n\nBurnout Challenge – Also similar to Drift Challenge, but focusing on obtaining burnouts score.\n\nSome options have been removed from the game – for instance the Burnout Dominator doesn’t feature Crash Mode, there is also no Traffic Checking Mode and Online Multiplayer. The PSP version features Burnout HQ where the player may upload scores and download new tracks.\n\nThe game consists of 12 different tracks, in 8 different real world locations. Each track has a forward and a reverse configuration."
