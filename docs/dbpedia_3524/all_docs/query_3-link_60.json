That is why they made Criterion make Need For Speed games instead since they always sell a alot based on the name. I doubt we will see another Burnout.\n\nI liked Burnout 3 on the original XBOX and to some extent Burnout Revenge on 360 but never cared much about Paradise. Burnout is not an open world game for me.\n\nI agree, I feel like we're the minority opinion here but Burnout 3 was my favorite. I think Burnout works better on tracks, especially the crash levels which were all set up perfectly for maximum destruction (and fun).\n\nFor me the trouble with Revenge was the rear-traffic checking. I think it messed with the pacing of the game, and Criterion took it as an excuse to put too much traffic on the roads. Takedowns from landing on top of other cars was such a great idea though.\n\nGruebacca\n\n813\n\nForum Posts\n\n2\n\nWiki Points\n\n0\n\nFollowers\n\nReviews: 4\n\nUser Lists: 0\n\nBecause we already have one, and because it's been almost 7 years since it came out. How can you release a sequel to a 7-year-old game and modernize it without removing the magic? They tried with Most Wanted, but it didn't exactly work.\n\nAnd as many have already stated above, the business realities of today's world mean that we will never see a sequel to Burnout Paradise. What we should do instead is hope that games like The Crew kindle a new kind of magic. We can't be hoping for the sequel to Burnout Paradise 20 years from now, right? Best to put faith into something new.\n\nstackboy\n\n752\n\nForum Posts\n\n166\n\nWiki Points\n\n0\n\nFollowers\n\nReviews: 5\n\nUser Lists: 3\n\nThat new project that Criterion announced at E3 looked kind of Paradise-ey, but the current Criterion dev team isn't really the same team that made Burnout Paradise.

Of course, opinions and all - but man, Paradise isn't even the best Burnout game.\n\nregularassmilk\n\n1785\n\nForum Posts\n\n1821\n\nWiki Points\n\n0\n\nFollowers\n\nReviews: 1\n\nUser Lists: 0\n\nBecause when you tell people who aren't SUPER into car games that it's great, they shrug it off because it's a car game.\n\nPeople who are SUPER into car games generally want less-arcadey experiences, and more importantly want licensed cars.\n\nBurnout Paradise is one of the greatest games I've ever played. Endless fun. I thought Need for Speed: Most Wanted was quite a bit of fun. Maybe as close to Burnout as we'll ever get.\n\nAll things considered, I'm really excited for Criterion's weird first-person all-vehicle game.\n\nawesomeusername\n\n4651\n\nForum Posts\n\n242\n\nWiki Points\n\n0\n\nFollowers\n\nReviews: 0\n\nUser Lists: 3\n\n#26 Edited By awesomeusername\n\nBecause EA hates money.\n\nI want a Paradise 2 so bad. :'(\n\nripelivejam\n\n13572\n\nForum Posts\n\n0\n\nWiki Points\n\n0\n\nFollowers\n\nReviews: 0\n\nUser Lists: 0\n\n#27 Edited By ripelivejam\n\n@sravankb: A-FUCKING-MEN\n\nLack of (a real) crash mode, no actual looped courses designed for racing, mostly boring city grid driving, lack of aftertouch, and general aimlessness meant it didn't sink its hooks in me like Takedown did. It's pretty and an overall decent game, but nowhere near the same.
