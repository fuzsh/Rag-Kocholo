        "text": "In what can be described as some of the best news I’ve heard in a long time, it seems a brand new Burnout game is in development for the PS2 as well as the PSP, and it goes by the name of Burnout Dominator. The reason I’m so elated with this news is because a while ago, we got word from EA that the series has finally made the transition to next gen, which meant no PS2 or Xbox version. But wait, that’s still happening (or is it?) as there are speculations that Criterion is still working on a next gen Burnout in addition to Dominator.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConfused? So are we.\n\nEither way, here’s yet another reason to hold onto your PS2 (can’t forget God of War). Burnout Domination is being developed by Criterion (now a subsidiary of EA) and will be released for the PS2 and PSP in 2007.\n\nWritten by Avinash Bali\n\nNash, as he prefers being called, woke up to the wonders of gaming rather late but don't bring that up around him. It's a touchy subject. A self confessed Battlefield veteran, Nash spent a good part of 2010 on the Steam Battlefield - with Bad Company (see what we did there?). He has a zero tolerance policy towards RTS games but is currently showing an interest by picking up and moving people - who he refers to as units - in the office. Thank God he's not that enthusiastic about Angry Birds or we'd be seeing women flying all over the place. Bali... Bali, put the receptionist down now. see more"
