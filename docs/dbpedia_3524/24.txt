Burnout Dominator are the next crazy car races, produced by the American corporation Electronic Arts and its British facility called Criterion Games. This popular series is designed for PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable owners, and the gameplay has been given even better quality than Burnout Revenge and Burnout Legends. First of all, a completely new mode of competing with road rivals in different corners of the globe has been prepared. Individual routes have been designed in such a way that they allow you to show off different driving styles - for example, on some of them you have to demonstrate mastery in spectacular cornering slides, while on others at least skillfully manoeuvring in road traffic counts.

Blue during the game we usually develop exorbitant speeds, which we reach with various four-wheelers (the cars were not created on the basis of licenses, but they resemble real machines), usually with the use of the built-in afterburner. You can't be scared and ride just like a maniac - especially in one of the play modes (nomen omen option is called Maniac), boiling with adrenaline. In confrontation with enemies, various shortcuts, hidden on all virtual routes, are useful. As usual in the Burnout series we can also count on breathtaking crashes, sheaves of sparks after friction of car sheets with other bodywork etc.
