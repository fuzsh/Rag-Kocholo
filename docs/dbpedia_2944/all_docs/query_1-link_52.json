        "text": "The Oscars: Hollywood’s proudest, most self-aggrandizing pageant, a prom and a graduation rolled into one. “The Oscar”: A 1966 film, with a script by the prolific science-fiction writer Harlan Ellison, depicting the sleazy machinations of a vapid, selfish actor to redeem himself by winning a golden statuette. The film, its cast packed with stars—Frank Sinatra, Bob Hope, Tony Bennett, Milton Berle, Ernest Borgnine, Joseph Cotten—some of them Oscar winners, was an overblown, A-list flop, a “Gigli” for the ages. In the Times, Bosley Crowther called it a “cheap, synthetic film which dumps filth upon the whole operation of Hollywood.” The Academy, which lent the film its logo and its blessing, apparently regretted it, and has not done so since.\n\nFor decades, the practically unwatchable film was largely unseeable, an unrestored embarrassment buried in the Paramount archives. “There’s a samizdat quality,” Erik Nelson, a filmmaker who made a documentary about Ellison, said. “Like ‘Fahrenheit 451,’ fans would be passing around copies and reciting the dialogue.” This Oscar week, an art-house distributor will release a remastered, wide-screen, HD version. “For us, it’s like finding the lost reels of ‘The Magnificent Ambersons’ or Erich von Stroheim’s nine-hour cut of ‘Greed,’ ” Nelson said. “Among comics, this film has a real resonance. There’s a level of complete and utter commitment: the actors are convinced they’re delivering Oscar-worthy material. Every scene is dialled to eleven.” He imagines a “Rocky Horror”-like cult future for “The Oscar.”\n\nSeveral months ago, Nelson gathered with a few others who love to hate “The Oscar” at a house in the Hollywood Hills, to record commentary for the DVD. Establishing his bona fides, he said, “They film April 5, ’65—who’s a nerd?—at the Academy Awards at Santa Monica Civic Auditorium, where ‘My Fair Lady’ is beating out ‘Dr. Strangelove’ for Best Picture and Rex Harrison beats Peter Sellers for Best Actor.”\n\nThe house belonged to Josh Olson, a screenwriter who collaborated with Ellison. “The Oscar” was Ellison’s first film, and he never managed to make another one. Patton Oswalt, the comedian, arrived, wearing brick-red shorts and a matching hoodie. He described attending a rare screening of “The Oscar” at the Egyptian Theatre in the early two-thousands: “When Harlan walked down the aisle to go onstage, he went down with both birds blazing, flipping off the audience the whole way.”\n\nEllison died in 2018. His widow, Susan, sat quietly in a swivel chair, sipping a margarita. “You could not mention ‘The Oscar’ around Harlan at all,” she said. “He took it so personally.” Susan—Ellison’s fifth wife— was married to him for thirty-two years. He once gave her a birthday gift of a color-pencil drawing done of Elke Sommer by Edith Head. (Head, who designed the costumes for “The Oscar,” also appeared in it; Sommer was one of the movie’s stars.) Recently, working with an archivist, Susan discovered her husband’s original three-hundred-and-forty-four-page script. Nelson had already committed most of it to memory.\n\nThe men got miked, and “The Oscar,” projected onto a large screen in Olson’s living room, began to roll. “Ladies and gentlemen, the star of ‘The Oscar,’ the great Stephen Boyd,” Nelson said. Boyd, as the soulless, amoral actor Frankie Fane, ditches his stripper girlfriend, played by Jill St. John, for Sommer, whom he later spurns. Oswalt put in a good word for Boyd, who played the antagonist to Charlton Heston’s Ben-Hur in the William Wyler film. “He gets a lifetime pass for conspiring with Gore Vidal behind Heston’s back to make Ben-Hur’s backstory gay,” Oswalt said.\n\nSt. John appeared in a tiger-striped bikini and long, claw-tipped gloves. “She made out with Henry Kissinger,” Oswalt said, appreciatively. “This is like looking at a new Zapruder print,” Nelson said. “It has details! Note the claws.” An hour and twenty minutes in, Oswalt was feeling the weight of time: “Who’s President? What’s a gallon of milk cost now?” He went on, “Folks, you could have read a story to your child, done a puzzle, had a nice conversation with a friend. You will flash back to this moment on your deathbed and curse yourself. ‘Harlan, Harlan, if you’re up there! So sorry! This movie is so fuckin’ bad!’ ”\n\nNelson produced Werner Herzog’s “Encounters at the End of the World,” which was nominated for an Academy Award in 2009; certain that “Man on Wire” would win, he didn’t attend the ceremony. Olson, too, is an Oscar nominee, for his adaptation of “A History of Violence,” a contender the same year that “Brokeback Mountain” won. “As Harlan was fond of saying, when we were writing together and arguing, ‘You are an Academy Award loser,’ ” he said.\n\nIn the movie’s final scene, Frankie Fane is at the Academy Awards, up for Best Actor. When Merle Oberon, as herself, announces the winner—“Frank . . . Sinatra”—Fane begins clapping psychotically, his face a mask of bewilderment, a GIF in every frame.\n\nNelson said, “We have to swear a blood oath that, the next time we all lose at the Oscars, we’ll stand up and do the Frankie Fane clap.” ♦\n\nAn earlier version of this article mistakenly credited Erik Nelson with an Academy Award."
