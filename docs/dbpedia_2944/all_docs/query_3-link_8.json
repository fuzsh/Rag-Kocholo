        "text": "Action!: MANN MEN - Anthony Takes It All!\n\nNothing is more frustrating than a film with a wonderful premise (here, the events that led to Rome's demise) that fails to execute about everything compellingly, resulting in a film as bland as its photography and devoid of any emotion or anything that makes a film engrossing.\n\nThe film delivers on its promise to tell part of the story of how corruption and a lack of unity led to the downfall of what was once one of the greatest empires in history, and there are a few very good dramatic moments, many of them courtesy of Guinness. The acting is all over the place; some of the actors do a good job,…\n\nThis Gladiator pre-make may be the most historically relevant of the sword and sandal epics. It was conceived as an explicit cautionary tale for post-war American empire but resonates more today with its themes of Rome for Romans, border walls, inclusivity, paths to citizenship, Middle East unrest, and evolve-or-die.\n\nThe studio-bankrupting sets are truly spectacular. They may be closest thing we have to visualizing what Rome must have been like and are a justification for spending three hours watching this. They built a 1:1 scale replica of the Forum, an unprecedented simulacrum, Samuel Bronston’s equivalent in hubris to the self-deified Caesar precipitating the fall of his empire and a movie studio.\n\nAnother reason to watch this is an insane mountain…\n\nThe Fall of the Roman Empire was one of the last of the huge historical epics that dominated the silver screen throughout much of the 1950s and 1960s. It is an absolute mammoth of a film. However, I think it is fair to say that The Fall of the Roman Empire isn't as well known as some of the other historical epics from the era. I didn't really know much about this film but, when I saw that it was on television, decided to give it a watch. While The Fall of the Roman Empire is far from being a perfect film, I still think it is a fairly entertaining watch.\n\nThe film begins in the winter of 180 AD…\n\nGladiator without the gladiators.\n\nSame exact premise. Same exact final duel. This film focuses more on politics and the idea of Rome. New vs. old ideologies. Equality and freedom vs. strength and authoritarianism. Still very relevant today. A lukewarm love story to top it off. The ending was a bit of a cop out, so it can save two characters. Unfortunately, this film drags, especially its first hour. I felt every bit of its 3+ hour runtime.\n\nThe only saving grace of this sword and sandals epic drama is the astounding production design. The very best of the golden age of Hollywood. More impressive than Ben-Hur and Spartacus. A handful of epic battles with thousands of extras and horses. Lavish…\n\n\"This was the beginning of the fall of the Roman Empire. A great civilization is not conquered from without, until it has destroyed itself from within.\"\n\nAnthony Mann's mammoth and almost little-known epic The Fall of the Roman Empire has a reputation of considerable intrigue. Some consider it one of the better epics created by the Samuel Bronson-Anthony Mann duo, while others think of it as an unfocused and bloated relic of old-school Hollywood.\n\nSo on my cinematic journey, I decided to take a look at this film myself. When I saw it online, I did not get to view it in the original widescreen ratio (2.39:1), so that may have diminished whatever grand impact the film may have had.…\n\n[152 minute version; streaming on Google]\n\nI was finished with this movie long before it was finished with me.\n\nThat is surprising. How could a movie with a cast this great and a budget this big be so uninvolving? And with the possibilities of this story–the descent of Rome from stability under Marcus Aurelius (Alec Guinness) into a period of decadence, corruption and internal division under his son Commodus (Christopher Plummer)?\n\nI checked out after barely an hour. This movie is so grand yet so empty. It plays like a history lesson. It doesn’t have characters; it has historical representations.\n\nIt has no emotional stakes. The Fall of the Roman Empire doesn’t raise the blood pressure even once–not even with…\n\n\"This was the beginning of the fall of the Roman Empire. A great civilization is not conquered from without, until it has destroyed itself from within.\"\n\nAnthony Mann's 1964 epic, inspired by Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, points the finger of blame at the jaded, paranoid empire's preoccupation with self preservationism. When you see Christopher Plummer's maniacal Emperor Commodus and his pampered, duplicitous inner circle baulk at the notions of immigration and citizenship into their country, you perhaps realise that we are born to make the same mistakes several times over.\n\nAlongside his producer Samuel Bronston, Mann continued to corner the market in the sword and sandal epic and was even set to cast his El Cid…\n\nIf you take a look at this film you might see some similarities with the more recent 'Gladiator', although Stephen Boyd's leading man has rather more romance in his soul than vengeance, especially with Sophia Loren around.\n\nHere our hero is less interested in fighting than in just going along with the way things are until really pushed by Commodus (Christopher Plummer I found a bit OTT, but he tends to overplay when not reined in by a decent director).\n\nSome critics slam this film for wooden acting but really it acquits itself well in the sword and sandal genre of its time - this came towards the end of that peak but is still watchable, [removed misremembered scene with…"
