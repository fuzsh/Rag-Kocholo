The Miriam Collection. The Weinstein Company, 2008.\n\nDVD 80397WRP1\n\nRating: ****\n\nFilmed in Ultra-Panavision and Technicolor, this is the most visually impressive and intelligently written of all the Ancient Roman Empire epics of the 1960s, though the last scenes are overly melodramatic and unconvincing. Naturally there are historical inaccuracies and they are discussed in the bonus features on the DVD.\n\nThe monumental score by Dimitri Tiomkin with over two hours of music is\n\namong his finest achievements and received a Golden Globe for Best Original Score of 1964. See also the listed of 100 Essential Film Scores.\n\nSome may find his score a bit over the top but I believe it adds significant impact to the static scenes with legions of costumed warriers on horseback as well as the dramatic dialogue scenes. The acting is top notch with such accomplished actors as Alec Guinness (Marcus Aurelius), James Mason (Timonides), and Christopher Plummer (Commodus). And the beautiful Sophia Loren (Lucilla) and handsome Stephen Boyd (Livius) add appeal as the lovers in conflict with the deranged Commodus. This massive epic film was produced by Samuel Bronston and directed by the still underrated Anthony Mann.\n\nThe opening Overture and Main Title music is one of the most unusual of any from an epic film. It begins with a festive antiphonal brass franfare lasting less than a minute that at once sets the mood for this film. Tiomkin makes ample use of one of his distinctive devices, the flutter-tongue technique in the trumpets.\n\nThen the pipe organ comes in for the Main Title as if beginning a Bach prelude or fugue, accompanied by the huge orchestra of about 130. Tiomkin titled this main theme, “The Fall of Love, ” and there were lyrics written for this theme by Tiomkin’s collaborator and Oscar-winner forHIGH NOON, Ned Washington. This song is sung by a subdued Italian choir at the Intermission (end of Disc One).\n\nTo my surprise nobody has yet mentioned the similarity of Tiomkin’s theme with the opening melody of the aria”Una furtiva lagrima” from Donizetti’s opera, L’Elisir d’Amore. Just listen to it and compare it to to Tiomkin’s love theme in THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. I don’t know if he intended to quote it or if it was merely a coincidence. But in any case, Tiomkin’s main theme is absolutely gorgeous and gives me goosebumps every time I hear it…so majestic and yet also very sad.\n\nThough Tiomkin was musically trained in Russia, he rose to the top in Hollywood, known for his unforgettable melodies, including hit songs such as “Do Not Forsake Me” from HIGH NOON and “The Green Leaves of Summer” from THE ALAMO. There is no film composer today, with the exception of John Williams, who can write such consistently memorable film themes.\n\nThis DVD has sharp images and the colors are beautifully rendered. The sound is also top notch, with the music very much up front and not ashamed to show itself off in all its orchestral splendor.\n\nAs far the bonus features on Disc Two, all of them are worth watching but the one concerning Tiomkin’s film score is of the most interest for music fans. Lasting about 20 minutes, it features perceptive comments from several authorities, including film music historian Jon Burlingame, and conductor John Mauceri.\n\nThe composer’s widow, Olivia Tiomkin-Douglas, also adds a few complimentary comments. This is one of the most extensive DVD features yet released devoted to a composer and just shows how significent and important Tiomkin’s music was to this epic film.\n\nChristopher Palmer in his wonderful biography, Dimitri Tiomkin: A Portrait quoted the composer’s comments about this film score:\n\n“I decided I must dismiss all idea of giving this picture quasi-documentary-style music. I excitedly started to block important dramatic and lyrical passages and found myself, to my great surprise, involved not with characters from eighteen centuries ago but with characters whose problems were remarkably like our own and practically co-incidental with all human drama. They were amazingly alive, close to me…and then the melodies started to come.”\n\nThe melodies that came from Tiomkin for this film are remarkable in their rhythmic flow and their emotional power.\n\nBesides the main theme there is the highly memorable “Pax Romana” theme and a spiritied Tarantella used near the end of the film, which quotes the main theme.\n\nThe composer’s widow mentions that this film was a most enjoyable working experience for Dimitri Tiomkin and was one of his favorite film scores.\n\nI believe THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE is one of his great masterpieces of film scoring.\n\nThe Soundtrack Recording\n\nSpecial Merit CD Release\n\nThis 2-CD set is highly recommended for the exceptional performance of orchestra and chorus.\n\nTHE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE\n\nwith the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra and Chorus,\n\nConducted by Nic Raine\n\nProduced by James Fitzpatrick\n\nPrometheus XPCD 170 (CD 1 = 67:51/CD 2 = 70:23)\n\nOrder from Tadlow Music\n\nSee also\n\nInterview with album producer, James Fitzpatrick"
