First volume 'New Edition', vols II-III 'Second Edition', final three volumes are First Editions. Complete in six volumes. Quarto (29 x 23 x 31cm), pp.xx; 704; pp.[12] 640; pp.[12] 640; pp.[4] xvi; 620; pp.[12] 684; pp.[14] 646 [52]. With a copper engraved portrait of the author to volume I, as well as two maps to volume II, and a folding map to volume III. Half title in volume II; general index and errata to volume VI. Eighteenth century half brown calf over marbled sides with red and green morocco labels to spine. Ownership names to volumes 1 and 2, contents clean, bindings rubbed and worn with some expert vintage (mid-20th century) leather repairs. Very good. Published sequentially in six volumes between 1776 and 1788, Gibbon's 'Decline and Fall' is universally acknowledged as an historiographical and literary giant of the English language. It has been read by historians of Rome and Byzantium ever since publication, though Gibbon's pessimistic attitude is currently unfashionable amongst scholars of Late Antiquity. Nevertheless, the breadth of his coverage and the depth of his knowledge remains unrivalled. Item #63063\n\nPrice: £3,250.00 save 50% £1,625.00"
