        "text": "EPISODE 1\n\nQuo Vadis Kick-Starts the Sword-and-Sandal Genre\n\nFew films did as much to shape the modern movie-going publicâs notions of ancient Rome as Quo Vadis. Discover how this film, released in 1951 by MGM Studios, ushered in the golden age of the so-called âsword-and-sandalâ picture, with its irresistible formula of evil, arrogant Romans versus virtuous, devout Christians.\n\n32 min Â· Nov 19, 2020 TV-PG\n\nEPISODE 2\n\nBen-Hur: The Greatest Chariot Race\n\nBen-Hur, from 1959, was an enormous financial risk that nevertheless became a cash machine for MGM Studios. In this episode, unpack the intricate tensions between the Jewish prince Judah Ben-Hur and the Roman aristocrat Messala, then analyze the historical accuracies (and inaccuracies) of the filmâs iconic naval battle and chariot race sequences.\n\n31 min Â· Nov 19, 2020 TV-PG\n\nEPISODE 3\n\nSpartacus: Kubrickâs Controversial Epic\n\nDiscover what makes Spartacus (despite being one of the best-known cinema epics of ancient Rome) something of an oddity. Itâs a gladiator film with only one scene of combat. Its production was rife with conflict. Its narrative misrepresents the real-life Spartacusâs goals. And it played an important role in Joseph McCarthyâs anti-communist movement.\n\n33 min Â· Nov 19, 2020 TV-PG\n\nEPISODE 4\n\nCleopatra: Spectacle Gone Wild\n\nHow did the 1963 film Cleopatra bring about the destruction of the golden age of epic films set in ancient Rome and destroy the old Hollywood studio system? How does this film treat the historical accounts of figures like Julius Caesar, Mark Antony, and Octavian? Why do its grand costumes and sets still deserve admiration?\n\n32 min Â· Nov 19, 2020 TV-PG\n\nEPISODE 5\n\nThe Fall of the Roman Empire and Ancient Epics\n\nWith its $19 million price tag and its $4.75 million in returns, The Fall of the Roman Empire was an unmitigated financial disaster. From its connections to 1960s global politics to its elaborate reconstruction of the Roman Forum to its bleak ending, explore why some critics and scholars regard this as a sophisticated take on ancient Rome.\n\n32 min Â· Nov 19, 2020 TV-PG\n\nEPISODE 6\n\nI, Claudius: The BBC Makes an Anti-Epic\n\nConsider the 1976 BBC production of I, Claudius, which has been credited as one of the most influential and memorable portraits of the ancient world ever to appear on the screen (big or small). Set between 24 BC and AD 54, the miniseries created an intimate look at the reigns of emperors Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula, and Claudius.\n\n31 min Â· Nov 19, 2020 TV-PG"
