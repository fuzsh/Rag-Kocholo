        "text": "“Steve Boyd Flits Among the Lovelies“\n\nAugust 5, 1963\n\nThe Daily Intelligencer\n\nBy Erskine Johnson\n\nRome – Chunky, rugged, dimple-in-the-chin Steve Boyd has just completed movies with Doris Day and Gina Lollobrigida, Now he was playing love scenes with Sophia Loren.\n\nSo leave it to me. I came right out and asked him how they compared on his personal popularity chart.\n\nThere had been drama of a sort at Rome’s airport the day before. The two Italian film sirens were slated to arrive within 15 minutes of one another – Gina from Athens, Sophia from Madrid.\n\nThe photographers were told: “Sophia at Gate 3, Gina at Gate 22.”\n\nOne or the other could be missed between arrival times.\n\nI was in the seat directly behind Gina on the plane from Athens. I didn’t know that the airport photographers faced a dilemma.\n\nNot until later did I check their popularity chart. With a choice, they waited for Sophia.\n\nIn Steve Boyd’s book it was the same story.\n\nWith a sudden, slightly startled smile he answered my candid question:\n\n“There is no comparison. I wouldn’t die exactly for Sophia, but I’d come close to it.”\n\nWe were on the set here of Samuel Bronston’s latest big epic, “The Fall of the Roman Empire.” It was a big, colorful set, build for only two weeks work. Most of the filming had been in Madrid, and more scenes would be filmed there.\n\nThe size of the film and its colossal set put no damper on the small talk always associated with a movie set, at home or abroad.\n\nBoyd talked about “Imperial Venus,” the movie he had made with Gina. It was a farce and this he regretted. He was sticking to straight drama from now on because:\n\n“I just can’t play farce. When I say something, I mean it.”\n\nDirector Anthony Mann was delighted about the chance to be making a historical film about Rome “with positively no clichés.” He started counting them on his fingertips – the clichés the film did not have:\n\n“No lions, no orgy, no shower of rose petals, no debauched emperor, no coliseum mobs.”\n\nAbout the lack or orgy, he laughed:\n\n“How can any movie have an orgy anyway? They always turn out to feature old men sitting around with young girls dropping grapes into their mouths.”\n\nThe film was in its 110th shooting day but Mann was right on schedule.\n\n“We are filming history, not making history in putting this film on the screen,” he laughed, an obvious reference to “Cleopatra.”\n\nOn sets, in Rome or in Hollywood, the small talk is the same as always.\n\nFollows Dodgers from Spain- a Dodger ‘fan-atic’\n\nby Herb Stein\n\nThe Philadelphia Inquirer, July 7, 1963\n\nMADRID. – Stephen Boyd is the only actor we know working abroad who imports his own ball games. For some stars the Number One item requested from America when they’re on foreign locations is Dave Chasen’s chili. For Belfast-born Boyd, whose birthday was July 4 and who hopes to become an American citizen, baseball is more important than food.\n\nHere he is in Las Matas, 16 miles from Madrid, on the mammoth set of the Roman Forum for Samuel Bronston’s “Fall of the Roman Empire” where from 2000 extras and players – gladiators, flagellantes, priests, trumpeters, mounted Praetorians, stilt-walkers, townsmen and townswomen, etc. – are being rehearsed for a Saturnalia celebration.\n\nSuddenly, during a five minute break, a courier races across the set to where Boyd is sitting off-camera to watch director Tony Mann prepare and shoot the spectacle sequence.\n\nSteve is not in this shot. The courier is not in the dress of the scene’s Second Century Roman period. He’s in sport shirt and slacks. He arrives breathlessly, clutching a newspaper as though it were his very life. He hands it to Boyd, exclaiming: “They win! They win!”\n\nWIN ‘MAKES’ HIS DAY\n\nThe paper is the Rome Daily American, first to arrive in Madrid with the basebal results of the preceding day. Boyd grabs it, quickly scans the standings on the sports page, sees the results for himself. His day is made. The Dodgers (at that moment) are a few percentage points atop the heap.\n\n“One of the things I miss most about California,” Steve told us, “are the Dodger games at Chavez Ravine. I’m a big Dodger fan-atic.” He said that twice a week Armed Forces Radio broadcasts games live from the States. “They don’t carry the night games. But we get the day games on Tuesday and Thursday nights. We hear them at night, of course because of the five hour difference between here and the East (eight hours ahead of the coast). You can’t get me out of my apartment those nights. I’m glued to the radio.”\n\nThe days he can’t hear the games, or misses AFRS score recaps, he must depend on the papers. He has a standing order for the first paper with the results to be rushed to him by “courier.”\n\nTAPES OF GAMES\n\nBoyd doesn’t confide his Dodger interest merely to results of the occasional AFRS coverage of the L.A. games. Steve’s friends frequently send him tapes of the Dodger games. “Those are the most eagerly awaited evenings, when the tapes arrive. I cancel any date. I sit backand listen to every word, hand on every pitch, hit, stricker, out, foul, cheer, boo – bell. I even enjoy the commercials. It doesn’t bother me a bit that the game is several days old or a week old – that I know the outcome. It’s as fresh live to me as though it were being played, that instant.”\n\nHe paused a moment, then asked: “Do you think the day’ll come when I’ll be able to get a kine and run the game on a screen at home? Wouldn’t that be sumpin’?”\n\nThat part is how one motion picture star, at least, spends much of his spare time during location shooting abroad. One Sundays and is rare days off, Boyd golfs.\n\nWhile we sat with Boyd, Christopher Plummer (who plays Commodus in “Roman Empire”) was taking instructions from a javelin expert for a duel sequence with Boyd (Livius). Steve had taken lessons earlier.\n\nPlummer said later: “It’s east once you learn it. You can make it as vicious as you like after you learn the basic steps.” The javelin fight expert is much like a choreographer and the staging is much similar to ballet. The javelins? The “steel” is rubber. “But in filming the fight, they won’t use synthetic rubber,” we were told,” We’re much to authentic for that – we’ll use real rubber.”\n\nBoyd and Plummer rehearse the javelin duel in “Fall of the Roman Empire”\n\nStephen Boyd on the set of “Fall of the Roman Empire” enjoying a cigarette break."
