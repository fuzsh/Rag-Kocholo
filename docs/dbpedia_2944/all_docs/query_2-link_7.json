        "text": "The Fall of the Roman Empire, American epic film, released in 1964, that was a box-office failure but remains one of the more intelligent spectacles of the genre.\n\nAs the film opens, Marcus Aurelius (played by Alec Guinness) is the wise and revered emperor of the Roman Empire. When he decides that his heir apparent should be his adopted son Livius (Stephen Boyd), his biological son Commodus (Christopher Plummer) and a conspirator poison him. Knowing that Livius is not nearly as politically ambitious as he is, Commodus convinces him to step aside. It is a move that Livius soon regrets: Commodus rules Rome with an iron hand, completely disregarding the well-being of the people and single-handedly reducing the grandeur of the Roman Empire. He sentences his own sister Lucilla (Sophia Loren) to death and sets up a final confrontation with Livius that determines the fate of Rome.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nOscar-Worthy Movie Trivia"
