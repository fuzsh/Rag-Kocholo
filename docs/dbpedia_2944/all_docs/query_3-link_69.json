        "text": "\"This was the beginning of the fall of the Roman Empire. A great civilization is not conquered from without, until it has destroyed itself from within.\"\n\nAnthony Mann's 1964 epic, inspired by Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, points the finger of blame at the jaded, paranoid empire's preoccupation with self preservationism. When you see Christopher Plummer's maniacal Emperor Commodus and his pampered, duplicitous inner circle baulk at the notions of immigration and citizenship into their country, you perhaps realise that we are born to make the same mistakes several times over.\n\nAlongside his producer Samuel Bronston, Mann continued to corner the market in the sword and sandal epic and was even set to cast his El Cid stars Charlton Heston and Sophia Loren once more, despite those actors hating each other. Loren was happy to return and indeed does so as Emperor Marcus Aurelius' daughter Lucilla, but Heston refused and so the role of the heroic Livius, rightful heir to Rome, went instead to Heston's Ben-Hur co-star, Stephen Boyd. The Belfast born actor's career in Hollywood was a relatively short one (he died at the age of 45 and his star had been on the wane for some time prior to that, many speculating his dissatisfaction with Scientology, a 'religion' he had been one of the first in Hollywood to embrace, was a factor) so it always adds an extra dimension to your viewing to catch an opportunity in which his fleeting star shone so brightly. Opposite him, as his rival for the throne, is Christopher Plummer in a role Richard Harris had passed on (interestingly, Harris went on to play the father of this character in Ridley Scott's Gladiator; a film which covers much the same story). As the bastard Commodus (bastard in both senses of the word!) Plummer delivers a deliciously energetic performance of deranged arrogance that is a world away from his subsequent role in The Sound of Music. There are also supporting roles from a triumvirate of British acting royalty; Alec Guinness as the kindhearted Marcus Aurelius - a role which one suspects George Lucas sat up and took notice of, Anthony Quayle as a noble, taciturn former gladiator and James Mason as an academic Greek and confident of Aurelius. Mason's character is the voice of reason in the proceedings but, truth be told, even I'd want to chuck a spear at him after one too many of his speeches and appeals for peace! Only Omar Sharif seems wasted in his slight role as Armenian King Sohaemus who, in a political manoeuvre to secure peace between their nations, takes Loren's luminous Lucilla away from Livius to be his bride.\n\nWhilst Mann's film has some languorous, pompous passages across it's almost three hour running time, it cannot be denied that this remains stirring stuff that depicts a gripping power struggle within the heart of Rome. Unfortunately, cinema goers at the time, bloated on spectacle, gave it the thumbs down, making this intelligent and impressive $28 million production a costly financial flop that would mark the end of the Hollywood epic."
