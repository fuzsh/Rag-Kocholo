        "text": "The following is a reference / historical listing of the roadshow and 70mm presentations of The Fall of the Roman Empire in the United States and Canada.\n\nThe Samuel Bronston production and Paramount release was directed by Anthony Mann (El Cid, Strategic Air Command) and starred Sophia Loren, Stephen Boyd, Alec Guinness, James Mason, Christopher Plummer, John Ireland, Mel Ferrer, Omar Sharif and Anthony Quayle. The films world premiere was held March 26th, 1964, at the DeMille in New York.\n\nThe presentations cited in the Part 1 section of this work were hard ticket roadshow engagements (i.e. special, long-running, showcase presentations in major cities prior to the film being exhibited as a general release). Much like a stage production, these typically featured an average of only ten scheduled screenings per week, advanced admission pricing, reserved seating, and an overture/intermission/entracte/exit music. A souvenir roadshow program booklet and the films soundtrack album were sold, as well, in some locales.\n\nThe print types utilized during the films roadshow release were, depending on the booking, (1) 70-millimeter (2.76:1 from Ultra Panavision 70) with discrete magnetic six-channel stereophonic sound, (2) 35-millimeter scope reduction with discrete magnetic four-channel stereophonic sound and optical monaural sound, (3) 35-millimeter scope reduction with optical monaural sound.\n\nOut of the hundreds of films released in North America during 1964, The Fall of the Roman Empire was among only six given deluxe roadshow treatment and among only seven released with 70mm prints.\n\nPART 1: THE ROADSHOW ENGAGEMENTS\n\n(reserved seat policy / presumed 70mm presentation)\n\n1964-03-26 New York, NY  DeMille (19)\n\n1964-03-27 Montreal, QC  Alouette (12)\n\n1964-03-27 Toronto, ON  University (11)\n\n1964-04-01 Washington, DC  Warner (12)\n\n1964-04-02 Denver, CO  Denham (6)\n\n1964-04-08 Dallas, TX  Tower (11)\n\n1964-04-08 Philadelphia, PA  Stanley (11)\n\n1964-04-09 Houston, TX  Tower (11)\n\n1964-04-10 Salt Lake City, UT  Centre (11)\n\n1964-04-15 Cincinnati, OH  Grand (11)\n\n1964-04-15 Edmonton, AB  Paramount (5)\n\n1964-04-15 Minneapolis, MN  Academy (11)\n\n1964-04-15 Portland, OR  Music Box (14)\n\n1964-04-15 Vancouver, BC  Stanley (10)\n\n1964-04-16 Cleveland, OH  Ohio (10)\n\n1964-04-17 Atlanta, GA  Roxy (11)\n\n1964-04-17 Chicago, IL  Michael Todd (15)\n\n1964-04-22 Kansas City, MO  Capri (8)\n\n1964-04-24 Indianapolis, IN  Lyric (10)\n\n1964-04-30 Detroit, MI  Madison (9)\n\n1964-05-20 Pittsburgh, PA  Nixon (7)\n\n1964-05-22 Boston, MA  Gary (7)\n\n1964-05-27 Baltimore, MD  New (6)\n\n1964-06-11 San Diego, CA  Capri (10)\n\n1964-06-24 Omaha, NE  Cooper (7)\n\nPART 2: FIRST-RUN ENGAGEMENTS\n\n(un-reserved seat policy / presumed 70mm presentation)\n\n1964-05-26 Hartford (West Hartford), CT  Elm (6)\n\n1964-05-28 Miami (Miami Beach), FL  Sheridan (8)\n\n1964-05-29 Jacksonville, FL  5 Points (5)\n\n1964-06-10 Los Angeles, CA  Paramount (8)\n\n1964-06-17 Rochester, NY  Riviera (5)\n\n1964-06-18 Syracuse (DeWitt), NY  Shoppingtown (5)\n\n1964-07-10 Buffalo, NY  Granada (5)\n\n1964-07-17 Columbus, OH  Cinestage (7)\n\n1964-07-22 San Francisco, CA  Alexandria (5)\n\n1964-07-24 Dayton, OH  McCook (6)\n\n1964-07-29 Youngstown, OH  State (2)\n\n1964-07-31 Milwaukee, WI  Wisconsin 1 (5)\n\n1964-08-05 Asbury Park, NJ  St. James (2)\n\n1964-08-05 Worcester, MA  Webster Square (3)\n\n1964-08-07 Des Moines, IA  Ingersoll (5)\n\n1964-08-21 Reading, PA  Fox (2)\n\n1964-10-01 Chattanooga, TN  Brainerd (3)\n\n1964-10-01 Nashville, TN  Crescent (3)\n\nPART 3: SUBSEQUENT 70MM ENGAGEMENTS\n\n(unreserved seating / general release policy)\n\n1964-06-17 Thornton, CO  North Star Drive-In (2)\n\n1964-08-05 Asbury Park, NJ  St. James (1)\n\n1964-08-19 Fairless Hills, PA  Eric (1)\n\n1964-08-26 Moorestown, NJ  Plaza (3)\n\n1964-09-23 Lawnside, NJ  White Horse Pike Drive-In (1) [w/ Zulu]\n\n1964-10-07 Annandale, VA  Annandale (1)\n\n1964-10-14 Philadelphia, PA  Cheltenham (1)\n\n1964-10-14 Philadelphia, PA  Parkwood (1)\n\nThe information in this article was principally referenced from film industry trade publications and regional newspaper promotion, with thanks to Jerry Alexander, Jim Barg, Bill Kallay, Bill Kretzel and Mark Lensenmayer.\n\nInternational 70mm presentations of this title have not been accounted for in this work.\n\nIf you believe this article contains any errors or omissions, please consider emailing the author or editor.\n\nMore in 70mm reading:\n\nUltra Panavison 70 Large Format Motion Picture Systems\n\nThe Fall Of The Roman Empire\n\n70mm Cinemas in North America\n\nin70mm.com's list of films blown up to 70mm\n\n70mm Engagements by Title\n\n35mm to 70mm Engagements by Year\n\nLarge Format 7OMM Engagements\n\nMonth by month premiere list of wide gauge and 3-strip films\n\nChronological premiere list of major 70mm films\n\n70mm Blow Up List\n\nDolby Stereo"
