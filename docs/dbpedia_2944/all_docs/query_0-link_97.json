        "text": "Stephen Boyd, an Irish‐born actor who was in dozens of Hollywood films but never quite reached star status, died in Los Angeles yesterday, apparently of a heart attack suffered while playing golf. He was 48 years old.\n\nA tall, broad‐shouldered man with a dimpled chin, brown curly hair and hazelgreen eyes, Mr. Boyd portrayed cowboys, police sleuths, military officers and a wide range of heroes and villains opposite such stars as Brigitte Bardot, Doris Day, Sophia Loren and Gina Lollobrigida.\n\nBut he was best known for his performance as Messala, Charlton Heston's chariot‐racing opponent in the 1959 version of “Ben‐Hur.” His other films included “Island in the Sun,” “The Best of Everything,” “Fall of the Roman Empire,” “Fantastic Voyage,” “Lisa,” “Jumbo” and “The Oscar.”\n\nIn the late 1960's Mr. Boyd made a number of foreign films and in 1973 formed an independent, Hollywood‐based production company. In recent years, he appeared in a number of television dramas."
