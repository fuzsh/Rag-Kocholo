        "text": "\"The greatest temple Rome ever built - the Colosseum. Because this is what they believe in... power.\" Yes it is time. Paramount Pictures has finally unveiled the first official trailer for Ridley Scott's Gladiator II, his long-awaited sequel to the Oscar-winning classic Gladiator from 2000. This legacy sequel is actually a direct sequel to the original - following Lucius, the son of Maximus's love Lucilla, after Maximus's death, who ends up fighting in the Colosseum as well. This looks like a properly glorious sequel - even bigger (and hopefully better) with battles galore, involving water and a rhino and so much more. Starring Paul Mescal as Lucius (played by Spencer Treat Clark in the first movie), Denzel Washington as Macrinus, Pedro Pascal as the Emperoro Marcus Acacius, Connie Nielsen as Lucilla, plus Joseph Quinn, Fred Hechinger, Lior Raz, Peter Mensah, and Derek Jacobi. Even after a 24 year wait for this sequel, it does look like it might be as entertaining as the original - though I doubt it'll end up winning any Oscars. Only time will tell if it shall conquer! All this footage kicks ass - especially every scene with Denzel. Fire it up below and enjoy the show.\n\nHere's the first official trailer (+ poster) for Ridley Scott's sequel Gladiator II, direct from YouTube:"
