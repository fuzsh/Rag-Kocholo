You can help Villains Wiki by expanding it.\n\n“ I loved you, Livius. Yet now you must die. But that's the sort of joke the gods love best. „ ~ Commodus as he prepares to fight Livius\n\nCommodus is the main antagonist of the 1964 film The Fall of the Roman Empire.\n\nHe was portrayed by the late Christopher Plummer, who also portrayed the Grand Duke of Owls in Rock-a-Doodle, Charles Muntz in Up, Arthur Case in Inside Man, Ralph Nickleby in Nicholas Nickleby, General Chang in Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, 1 in 9, Barnaby in Babes in Toyland, Mr. Caruthers in The Clown at Midnight, and King Herod in The Star.\n\nFilm[]\n\nCommodus is the charismatic but amoral son of Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius. Marcus knows Commodus is unfit to rule and plans to appoint his favorite general, and Commodus' best friend, Gaius Livius, as his successor. Commodus is enraged by his father's decision, and has him killed before Livius can officially assume the throne. Once he becomes Emperor, Commodus undoes all of his father's policies out of spite, and transforms Rome into a brutal dictatorship.\n\nLivius reluctantly enforces Commodus' unjust rule out of patriotism and loyalty to his old friend, but eventually forms a secret alliance with Commodus' sister Lucilla, his former lover, against Commodus' regime. When Commodus learns of their betrayal, he has them both banished. He eventually allows them to return, even making Lucilla his co-ruler, but demands that Livius massacre his political opponents. Livius refuses, and with Lucilla forms an official front against Commodus' regime. Commodus retaliates by having his cronies in the Senate declare him a god, and sentencing Livius and Lucilla to be \"sacrificed\" to him.\n\nMeanwhile, Commodus discovers that he is not really Marcus' son, but the product of his mother's affair with a gladiator; since he is illegitimate, he is ineligible to rule. Commodus' shame and thwarted ambition sends him over the edge, and he orders Livius to fight him to the death to determine who will rule Rome. Livius fights his old friend in a duel with javelins, and runs him through, killing him.\n\nTrivia[]"
