        "text": "Filmmaker Ridley Scott is finally attempting to get cameras rolling on a long-gestating sequel to his Oscar-winning pic “Gladiator.” That movie tells the story of a victorious general from the Roman Empire who becomes a gladiator against his will, only to take down the tyrant that killed his family. Referred to as “Gladiator 2,” Scott is assembling quite the cast for the project, including Irish actor Paul Mescal (“Aftersun“), recent Oscar nominee Barry Keough, and acclaimed Oscar-winner Denzel Washington.\n\nREAD MORE: ‘Gladiator 2’: Connie Nielson Returns As Lucilla While Joseph Quinn Will Play Emperor Caracalla In Ridley Scott’s Upcoming Sequel\n\nAnd another fantastic actor has been hired for the sequel as Deadline reports that Pedro Pascal (“The Last of Us,” “Game of Thrones“) is the newest addition to the film. This wouldn’t be the first action-packed period project that Pascal has been involved with as he played a Dornish character that sadly died in combat on the hit HBO series “Game of Thrones.” At the moment, it’s unclear who Pascal will be playing. Still, the actor wouldn’t be terribly shocking to see in or outside the gladiator pit, given playing a string of morally gray villains and heroic characters in the past.\n\nMescal’s character Lucius will be the main protagonist of the pic after Russell Crowe’s fierce Maximus didn’t survive the last film. The rest of the impressive cast consists of fellow newbies like the aforementioned Keoghan (“The Banshees of Inisherin“) and Joseph Quinn (“Stranger Things“), alongside the few returning actors from the original film, such as Connie Nielsen and Djimon Hounsou. It’s all a clear sign that Scott and his casting team, yet again, know how to get a mix of popular and rising stars into his films."
