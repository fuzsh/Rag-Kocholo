Controversy later arose between screen writer Gore Vidal and Charlton Heston about the hidden subtext behind these scenes. According to Vidal, he had convinced Stephen Boyd and director William Wyler to add a deeper gay relationship- gone wrong- between the two characters to explain Messala’s hatred towards his friend. It was decided not to tell conservative Heston about their decisions, but Stephen Boyd played the scenes with this subtext in mind.\n\nCollection\n\nProps\n\nCitation\n\n“Stephen Boyd as Messala Dagger in 'Ben Hur',” Film Costume Collection, accessed August 12, 2024, https://filmcostumecollection.omeka.net/items/show/1283.\n\nItem Relations\n\nItem: Images of Stephen Boyd in 'Ben Hur' Still images from film This Item"
