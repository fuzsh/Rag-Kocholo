        "text": "whose name is in the title. The movie Amadeus by Milos Forman is about the famous musician and composer, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, but the movie is not told from his point of view but from his rival, Antonio Salieri played by F. Murray Abraham. The story is set in 1823 as the elderly Antonio Salieri is placed in a lunatic asylum for attempting suicide. He launches into a long confession about his relationship with Mozart which set the main story to 1781. Amadeus is a period drama film. The main idea\n\nMoreover, Mozart’s music in Amadeus is attributed to survey intricate relationship between God and humans. Through Salieri’s powerful jealousy of Mozart’s music and his intense blame on God, the movie proposes the issue of human’s incomplete belief in God and the question about the existence of God. Salieri, in the beginning part of the movie, is presented as the profoundly religious human. He believes that God grants his faithful wish to be a successful composer so he tries to devote to his God\n\nAmadeus begins with an attempted suicide by composer Antonio Salieri, who is overcome with guilt about supposedly killing Mozart. His life is saved by his aids and he is sent to what looks like a mental hospital, where a priest is sent to council him. The whole story is told through the eyes of Salieri on his death bed, confessing to his priest. The whole movie takes place in Vienna, Austria. Besides the first few scenes where Mozart is seen as a child, the story begins in 1782 when Mozart is the\n\nAmadeus Influential Values Peter Shaffer’s Amadeus presents to the reader many human values. The most prominent being envy, deceit and self-sacrifice. During the course of the play these features are displayed through Salieri’s actions, emotions and dialogue. The relationship between Salieri and Mozart is like a painting, commencing with splattered envy after Mozart’s extordinary musical talents disrupt Salieri’s clean, white, sanity. Splatters become blotches when Mozart uses Salieri’s\n\nOn November 30, 2017, I viewed a play called Amadeus, from the comfort of my home. Didn’t think I would like it seeing that this would be my first time ever seeing a play like this one. I was thinking to myself am I going to like it, will I be able to sit through the whole play without being bored. Within the first couple of seconds, I was amazed at how the characters from the start of the play really drew me in with their chanting and the two characters going on and on about the tale of Antonio\n\nMozart’s music in Amadeus exuberantly reproduces his life with the narrative which chronologically unfolds the series of episodes related to the life of Mozart. By arranging Mozart’s music in Amadeus in the order of composition with the important episodes of his life, the movie shows that how Mozart who was once praised as the musical prodigy eventually reaches to the death at the early age. Mozart’s witty and bright music played in the early part of the movie shows his unique composition style in\n\nIn a shockingly similar parallel to the fall of the Roman Empire, the film Amadeus highlights Salieri’s gradual descent into madness, as his jealousy of Mozart’s musical genius culminates in a devious scheme to bring about Mozart’s downfall. The film begins by jumping between two scenes—a small, dark room where Salieri attempts to take his life, and the bright palace walls where people joyfully dance to music. Establishing a dramatic contrast between light and dark, it’s clear that Salieri has progressed\n\nThe film Amadeus directed by Milos Forman in 1984 was a look in to the interesting and short life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Mozart was considered a child prodigy and genius by possessing qualities such as: composing his first concerto at the age 4, first symphony by the age of seven, his first opera by twelve, being able to just hear a piece of music once and being able to play it back perfectly from memory, playing the piano with a blindfold on, or playing the piano upside-down and backward. The\n\nThe music in Amadeus has been beyond the simple role as a background of the movie and greatly influenced the flow of the narrative in the film. The movie Amadeus arouses realism and immersion in the life of Mozart which is glorious but miserable at the same time by appropriately arranging the narrative of the film with Mozart’s great music. In other words, the soundtrack of the film composed by Mozart works as the important dramatic device to describe Mozart’s life, the main theme of the movie –"
