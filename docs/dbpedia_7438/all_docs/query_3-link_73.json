The film’s story is adapted from Shaffer’s stage play “Amadeus,” which was in turn inspired by Alexander Pushkin’s 1830 play Mozart and Salieri.\n\nHere’s how you can watch and stream Amadeus via streaming services such as Netflix.\n\nIs Amadeus available to watch via streaming?\n\nYes, Amadeus is available to watch via streaming on Netflix.\n\nThe story of Amadeus is set in Vienna, Austria, in the latter half of the 18th century. It tells a fictionalized tale of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart from when he left Salzburg. The narrative also follows a fictional rivalry between Mozart and fellow Italian composer Antonio Salieri at the court of Joseph II.\n\nAmadeus’ cast includes F. Murray Abraham as Antonio Salieri, Tom Hulce as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Elizabeth Berridge as Constanze Mozart, Roy Dotrice as Leopold Mozart, Simon Callow as Emanuel Schikaneder, Christine Ebersole as Katerina Cavalieri, Jeffery Jones as Emperor Joseph II, Charles Kay as Count Orsini-Rosenberg, and Kenneth McMillan as Michael Schlumberg.\n\nWatch Amadeus streaming via Netflix\n\nAmadeus is available to watch on Netflix. Netflix is an OTT platform that offers a wide range of content to stream. This content includes originals such as BoJack Horseman and The Witcher and content on the platform due to various distribution deals such as Kill Bill Vol 2 and Ready Player One.\n\nYou can watch via Netflix by following these steps:\n\nVisit netflix.com/signup\n\nChoose a payment plan from the following:\n\n$6.99 per month (standard with Ads)\n\n$15.49 per month (Standard)\n\n$22.99 per month (Premium)\n\nEnter your email address and password to create an account\n\nEnter your chosen payment method\n\nThe cheapest Netflix Standard with Ads Plan provides all but a few of its movies and TV shows. However, it will show ads before or during most of its content. You can watch in Full HD and on two supported devices at a time.\n\nIts Standard Plan provides the same but is completely ad-free while also allowing users to download content on two supported devices with an additional option to add one extra member who doesn’t live in the same household.\n\nThe Premium Plan provides the same as above, though for four supported devices at a time, with content displaying in Ultra HD. Users get to download content on up to six supported devices at a time and have the option to add up to two extra members who don’t live in the same household. Netflix spatial audio is also supported.\n\nAmadeus’ synopsis is as follows:\n\n“Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is a remarkably talented young Viennese composer who unwittingly finds a fierce rival in the disciplined and determined Antonio Salieri. Resenting Mozart for both his hedonistic lifestyle and his undeniable talent, the highly religious Salieri is gradually consumed by his jealousy and becomes obsessed with Mozart’s downfall, leading to a devious scheme that has dire consequences for both men.”\n\nNOTE: The streaming services listed above are subject to change.
