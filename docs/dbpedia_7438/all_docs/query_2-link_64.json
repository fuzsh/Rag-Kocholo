        "text": "Whattt another Marxist analysis on the internet??\n\nOk, so I watched Amadeus for the first time, and I was in awe. Although I know the movie is historically inaccurate, the director and writer intentionally took liberties with the story. The film was a modern dramatic re-telling of Pushkin’s 1830 play, literally called Mozart and Salieri. Despite this, I found myself caught up in various aspects of the movie, such as the stunning set designs, costumes, script, and the exploration of themes like Christian predestination, guilt, faith, grace, and love. The cinematography and acting, particularly the portrayal of Emperor Josef, really captivated me.\n\nI was particularly intrigued by the political commentary in Mozart’s operas. It encompassed everything from the grand Habsburg royal court in Vienna to the condescending Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg’s court and the lower-class German audience of the Freihaus-Theater auf der Wieden. Operas like The Marriage of Figaro highlighted the fragility of pre-revolutionary Europe, while Die Entführung aus dem Serail provided a commentary on uptight upper-class morality and decorum. This all took place during the period from 1756 to 1791 when Mozart was alive, and it set the stage for modern Europe. While I only have a basic understanding of 18th-century European history, I tried to draw some parallels to something I know better: social critique or merely Critical Theory.\n\nI still have a very sciolistic understanding of 18th century European history, but I tried to draw some comparisons to the movie to the realm of something I think I know: social critique. Or merely Critical Theory.\n\nMany aeons ago, I watched CCK Philosophy’s video on a Marxist Analysis of Shrek (I know, it's wild) and decided that Amadeus was a movie that I could use as a helpful analysis.\n\nWolfgang Amadeus Mozart, often presented as vulgar, childish and immature, was also kind-hearted and had a deep affection and love for his family, especially his father. Love was a recurring theme in his operas (once as a German virtue), reflecting his genuine admiration for it. He emerged as a figure representing the unguided proletariat of the pre-1789 and pre-1848 era. Yet, unlike the lumpenproletariat, Mozart was, of course, Mozart. He was a prodigious talent with a godly passion, vision, soul and social awareness despite being somewhat oblivious to his position in society. Despite being born into a respectable middle-class family, with his father as the controlling patriarch, Mozart was constantly reminded of his subordinate status and often treated as a mere underling and plaything for the aristocracy. He held a cynical view of the aristocracy’s strict traditions and moralism and felt more at ease with the lower class. He was compelled to sell his labour at a meagre wage, creating extravagant performances for the excessive consumption of the aristocratic class. Here, we see surplus value, where the cost of the product is significantly higher than the cost of the labour used to create it. Eventually, Mozart, unwilling to play the tune of the upper-class fads, began working in more modest settings for the Viennese lower classes, who genuinely appreciated his raw work but could only offer meagre wages. Eventually, Herr Mozart experienced alienation from his labour, feeling a sense of meaninglessness and anomie (in identification with upper-class values), exhibiting both subjective and objective alienation and, crucially, a general sense of powerlessness. Though it is unclear whether he had schizophrenia, studies have stated that Mozart may have had some personality disorder and major depressive disorder leading to some form of mental alienation. His self-estrangement is evident through his penchant for entertaining himself through gambling, partying and alcohol, which seemed to exacerbate his downward spiral.\n\nMeanwhile, the court composer Antonio Salieri, representing the emerging liberal enlightenment bourgeoisie, outwardly supports Emperor Josef II and the enlightened monarchy despite coming from a modest background. He adheres to the restrictive court etiquette and aristocratic culture and engages in courtly political intrigues. Although appointed as Court Composer to the Habsburg royal court, he will never be a member of the German aristocracy, despite his efforts to associate himself with it. Salieri was a lifelong admirer of Mozart since he toured Europe displaying his exceptional musical talents to kings and emperors. However, when Salieri gets to know Mozart personally, he is severely disappointed. More than a disappointment, he sees him as a mockery of God’s creation. Mozart’s popish immaturity baffles and tests Salieri’s faith and internalised identification with the bourgeoisie (the Enlightenment aristocracy). His faith provides him with superficial comfort and consolation but prevents him from engaging in true class-conscious activities from emancipation.\n\nDisguised as the ghost of his father, he requests Mozart to write his masterpiece, Requiem. He then plans to kill Mozart and claim his work as his own. Along with the petty bourgeoisie identification with the interests of conservative elements of society, he seeks to go above and beyond, illuminating his own personal insecurities. In a sense, we see his plans of murder and fraud as a terroristic response to his loss of economic prestige, similar to the petty-bourgeois association with fascistic elements of society.\n\nHowever, in the third act of the film, we see Salieri show his true melody. He attends all of Mozart’s operas without fail and is frankly ashamed of his wonder of the composer. Yet in the final 30 minutes of the film, after Mozart collapses when composing The Magic Flute, Salieri takes genuine care and interest in him and escorts him back to his apartment. There, we see both Mozart and Salieri naturally working in basic syncopation. Both the liberal bourgeoise, alienated by his adherence to the ridiculousness of upper-class norms, dogmatic Catholic teaching and procedural normalities, and the proletariat, who has nothing to lose. Requiem, or in other words, a mass for a dead person, was to be fully completed by the proletariat through the help of the liberal bourgeoisie. This magnum opus signals how collaboration with the bourgeoisie and proletariat, though not at all in vain with the creation of one of the most iconic works of music, leads to little material success foreshadowing future events in the next century. The French Revolution, an ongoing occurrence at the time of the film, can be seen as the first radical bourgeois revolution, seeing collaboration between the sans-culottes/proletariat and the liberal bourgeoisie. However, a genuine radical revolution dies in the face of reactionary and Bonapartist assault.\n\nThe proletariat dies, exhausted and sickened, hastily thrown, without much appropriate reverence, in a pile of unmarked corpses in an overflowing pauper’s grave adorned with a shovel full of quicklime to hasten its decomposition. Though in reality, he was probably buried in a common grave, not a pauper’s grave, this suggests a literal grave reality of not only the dire economic modalities of Ancien Regime Europe but of the unconsciousness and non-revolutionary proletariat. In this sense, Mozart, at least in the film, was born at the wrong time. A radical born in a very unradical time. The bourgeois reformer, Salieri, fades into obscurity and mediocrity, hopeless with the death of the proletariat and humbled by the acquisition of class consciousness. He is left in a psychiatric hospital in 1823, canonising himself as a patron saint of mediocrity whilst forgiving other mediocrities in his name. He still does not realise the injustices of life after this episode. Everything is about him and what he deserves. In this, he is a supposed humble servant of God who sacrifices for the purpose of perfecting his craft. Amadeus mocks this value system, and he is left in the gutters as a morose shell of a once esteemed composer.\n\nSimilarly, Requiem foreshadows something else: the death of feudal Europe. This was a Europe just before the old world came tumbling down, relegated as a historical footnote. Emperor Josef II, as the enlightened monarch, with the institution of progressive reforms such as the abolition of serfdom and freer speech, can also seen as emblematic of having characteristics of the liberal bourgeoisie. Yet his attempts to reform at the top to prevent discontent and eventual revolution from below were in vain in the long term. The Holy Roman Empire, the medieval institution of which he was god-anointed, was abolished in 1806 after just less than a millennia of continued existence. Continental monarchy accelerated through Napoleonic ideals and reforms, forced to reconcile with the new proletariat and bourgeois interests of society. At the cusp of the Industrial Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars, the obsolete rigid values of the aristocracy were to gradually face the music. New artistic and intellectual movements were spurred by liberalism, romanticism, nationalism, and communism, which all had some form of bone to pick with the pre-1789 feudal monarchy. Even music was innovated through Romanticism, where music moved away from aristocratic patronage to the middle class and bourgeoisie. This was to be bolstered by harmonic innovation, instrumental diversity from the Industrial Revolution, chromaticism and the emergence of national identity. Feudal society was to be upended for better and for worse. Class conflict was not serf and nobility but now proletariat and bourgeoisie. Amadeus\n\nLest we have a dilettante understanding of Critical Theory within the Oscar-winning film Amadeus, of course, I could discuss the Marriage of Figaro and such, but I’m too much of a layman for that."
