        "text": "Since we’re friends here, I feel comfortable admitting that I love Amadeus (1984) for many reasons. The story is compelling enough for me to overlook the fact that it is heavily embellished to the point of being fiction, but theÂ music, of course, is fabulous (raging Mozart fangirl, checking in). Tom Hulce and F. Murray Abraham are wonderfully competitive in their roles as Mozart and Salieri. There’s humor, pathos, romance, all set against the backdrop of 1780s Vienna.\n\nAnd as a little girl, I watchedÂ Amadeus and dreamed of one day getting to wear fabulous 18th-century clothes. It was the first 18th-century movie I remember seeing, and it had a big impact on 10-year-old me, soaking in all of the pastel colors and the cream-puff hairdos. I wanted to live in that macaroon-colored world so badly that I spent hours upon hours locked up in my bedroom drawing 18th-century clothing designs, all because ofÂ Amadeus.\n\nThen I made the mistake of watchingÂ Amadeus as an adult with a degree in clothing history and 20 years of experience in researching, making, and wearing period costume, and while the story and the acting still hold up, the costumes haven’t. In fact I’ve compared these outfits to contemporary 1980s historical films and was left wondering how on earth this film won an Academy Award for Best Costume in 1985.\n\nFirst of all, let’s look at the competition that year for the coveted Best Costume Oscar:\n\nThe Bostonians\n\nBased on a novel by Henry James, this Merchant-Ivory film had a star-studded cast, featuring Vanessa Redgrave,Â Christopher Reeves, and Jessica Tandy. The costume design team was made up of Jenny Beavan (who later went on to designÂ Cranford, The King’s Speech, Jefferson in Paris to name a few) and John Bright (A Room With a View, Howards End).\n\n2010\n\nThe somewhat less surreal sequel toÂ 2001: A Space Odyssey,Â 2010 starred Helen Mirren, John Lithgow, and Roy Scheider. Costumes were designed by Patricia Norris, who had a pretty epic career, even in 1984. Notable costume design credits areÂ 12 Years a Slave, Victor/Victoria, Johnny Dangerously,Â andÂ Scarface.Â I have to go on the record here and say thatÂ 2010Â is actually one of my favorite sci-fi films and is pretty much overlooked in favor of its predecessor. Also, Helen Mirren. Have I mentioned I want to have her babies?\n\nÂ A Passage to India\n\nTwo words: Merchant Ivory. Another cast packed with Big Names, this one starred Judy Davis, Alec Guinness, and Peggy Ashcroft. Costume design was by Judy Moorcroft, whose CV includesÂ The Prince and the PauperÂ (one of the best costumed 16th-century films out there),Â Yentl, andÂ The Killing Fields.Â Unfortunately, it’s one of those types of films where people are more interested in the plot and acting than the costumes, so I can’t find any good still shots that represent the 1920s clothing. Sheesh. I guess that’s a good indication as to why it didn’t win for Best Costume…\n\nPlaces in the Heart\n\nJohn Malkovich, Sally Field, Ed Harris, and Danny Glover are cast in this look at interracial friendshipÂ in the 1930s South. Costume design by Ann Roth, who later went on to work onÂ The English Patient, The Talented Mr. Ripley, The Hours,Â andÂ The Book of Mormon.Â Again, this is the sort of film where it’s the acting that takes center stage, so since it’s rare thatÂ costume design Oscars go to science-fiction films, gritty Depression-era films, or prim 1920s films, that basically leaves The Bostonians as the only real contender with AmadeusÂ in the category at the 1985 Academy Awards.\n\nCostume designerÂ Theodor PiÅ¡tÄkÂ (who went on to costumeÂ ValmontÂ a few years later) was interviewed by Vice a few years ago, reflecting on his workÂ on Amadeus,Â which was an interesting reminder that Amadeus was filmed on location in Prague during the Cold War. Also, PiÅ¡tÄk seems to have the same gripes every costume designer has about historical accuracy being thrown out for a weird mishmash of styles and eras:Â\n\n[Hollywood has]Â tremendous problems with [capturing historical details correctly]. When the main production designer flew in for a meeting, he was mixing up Romanesque with Roman culture. But they wanted to truthfully capture the atmosphere of Mozart’s time so they wanted to hire someone from Prague, which is connected with Mozart. That’s why Forman asked me.\n\nSo, with that in mind, let’s revisit some of the costumes fromÂ Amadeus, shall we?\n\nLet’s see, there’s boobs:\n\nBad wigs:\n\nBad lace:\n\nMore bad wigs:\n\nPrincess seams and bad wigs:\n\nPolyester baroque satin from the Casa Collection at Jo-Ann’s:\n\nTurkish delight:\n\nCrafter’s lace capes:\n\nLest we hear the cry from the masses, “BUT IT WAS THE EIGHTIES! We can’t expect historically accurate costumes in the 1980s!” I want to remind you thatÂ Dangerous LiaisonsÂ was a product of the same era, only four years later.\n\nAnother interesting factoid that I recently discovered was that Meg Tilly was originally cast to play Constanze, but was injured the day before her scenes were set to begin shooting. She was replacedÂ with Elizabeth Berridge at the last possible second, but thereÂ are aÂ fewÂ stills of Tilly out there that show her in Stanze’s blue dress and plastic wig from the first scene:\n\nI wonder if the sudden, last minute change in actresses accounts for some of the fitting weirdnesses we see in Stanze’s costumes? Since there’s no good before and after photos out there, we can onlyÂ speculate that perhaps the Victorian corset and princess seams were an attempt to shoehorn Berridge into costumes made for Tilly.\n\nI think, as far as 18th-century movie costumes go, this fails to hold up when compared toÂ predecessors such as Barry Lyndon (1975), but as Trystan points out, the widespread success ofÂ AmadeusÂ was proof to Hollywood that the historical “frock flick” was lucrative enough to warrant films such asÂ Dangerous Liaisons (1988),Â The Madness of King George (1994), andÂ Marie Antoinette (2006).\n\nIn the end, I think it all pointsÂ to the fact thatÂ AmadeusÂ was the only “costume-y” film up for consideration in 1985. The competition that year was pretty stiff in the acting and directing categories, but in the costume category, a couple of early-20th century films about wallowing in dirt, an film about lesbians in the 1880s, and a sci-fi movie about sci-fi stuff just isn’t going to be a match for the almighty spectacle that is the 18th century.\n\nAnd when you take it all in as a whole, the awfulness of the wigs and costumes do sorta start to fade out while you’re getting swept up in the glitz of a rockstar’s epic rise and fall. Because that’s all thatÂ Amadeus really is when you boil it all down… Hell, this movie inspired Falco to produce this little gem:"
