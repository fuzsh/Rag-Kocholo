        "text": "2021-2022 Course Descriptions\n\nCourse Categories:\n\nCourses Taught in English\n\nCourses Taught in German\n\nGraduate-Level Courses Available to Undergraduates\n\nCourses Primarily for Graduate Students\n\nCOURSES Taught in english\n\nGER 104-6-20 : First Year Seminar -Lies, Sophistry, Propaganda, Bluster, Equivocation, and Bullshit\n\nEver since Socrates defeated the Sophists, the question of truth, lying, and whatever comes in between has been crucial for thinking about communication and thought. But what does it mean, exactly, to lie – or, if not exactly to lie, to seek to overpower the person you are talking to with a stream of empty rhetoric, intentional ambiguity, deflection, bluffing, or other modes of deceptive or manipulative speech? To what ends have such practices been put throughout history, and what are their political, social, and psychological consequences? This seminar will look at the practice and implications of various forms of deceptive or coercive speech in a selection of novels, films, essays, and philosophical texts. Possible readings may include: Arthur Schopenhauer, The Art of Being Right; Friedrich Nietzsche, “On Truth and Lying in an Extra-moral Sense”; Orson Welles, F for Fake; Patricia Highsmith, The Talented Mr. Ripley; and Hannah Arendt, “Lying in Politics.”\n\nGerman 222-0 (SA) – German History 1789-1989\n\nThe country that we now know as Germany has undergone a remarkable number of geographic, political and cultural transformations over the past two centuries. This course offers a general introduction to some aspects of the history of modern Germany from the late 18th century to today, examining the contested development of German national identity; the lengthy struggles for unification; political, military and imperial ambitions in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; the history of Germany in the two World Wars; and the gradual integration of a divided Germany into new European and international frameworks following the Second World War.\n\nPrerequisites: None.\n\nThis course counts for Distribution Area IV.\n\nGerman 224-0 – Contemporary Germany\n\nCourses under this rubric focus on the German political, social, and cultural scene after 1945. Topics vary and may include: Political Extremism in West Germany, a seminar which traces the history of political terrorism in post-war German society and also tries to locate it within a larger framework of militant protests throughout Europe and the world. Particular attention will be given to the actions of the infamous Red Army Faction (RAF), which also left its mark in German popular culture. While the RAF and other left-wing groups of the 1960s and 1970s are the main focus of the class, we will also talk about the disquieting phenomenon of right-wing terrorism, currently a much-discussed topic in Germany because of the ongoing revelations about the National Socialist Underground (NSU). Please consult Caesar for current topic. German 224 may be repeated for credit with different topics.\n\nPrerequisites: None.\n\nThis course counts for Distribution Area IV.\n\nGerman 226-0 – New Voices in German Literature\n\nCourses under this rubric introduce students to contemporary German literature in English translation such as the contemporary historical novel, new and important short story, novels, and/or memoirs. Topics vary and may include: The Black Diaspora and Transnationality, a course that will a) explore the concepts of “diaspora” and “transnationalism” in order to situate the course materials within the broader networks of the global African Diaspora; b) survey theoretical and historical readings about the emergence of black communities in the UK and Germany as well as their transnational conversations with other Afro-diasporic groups; and c) introduce students to the cultural productions of Afro-diasporic groups in Britain and Germany such as films, music, novels, and autobiographies. Please consult Caesar for current topic. German 226 may be repeated for credit with different topics.\n\nPrerequisites: None.\n\nThis course counts for Distribution Area VI.\n\nGerman 228-0 – The German Film\n\nCourses under this rubric offer in-depth study of German films and their cultural background. Topics vary and may include: Cinema and the City, a course which will draw on a wide range of classic and lesser-known films from the Weimar period onward. Students will be introduced to major German cities and analyze both how space and social relationships are imagined in the German metropolis and in terms of the relationship between a German and an “extra-territorial” city. How does urban space influence how one thinks about forms of national, gendered, ethnic, sexual, and class identity? How does the perception of social relations in the urban space and in cinematic form organize the view of political and social networks? Approaches to these questions will include: formal and aesthetic analysis, examinations of the historical background and cultural specifics of both the films and the cities under consideration, and the close reading and interpretation of a brief selection of classical texts on modernity, mass society, production and reception histories, and theories of space. Please consult Caesar for current topic. German 228 may be repeated for credit with different topics.\n\nPrerequisites: None.\n\nThis course counts for Distribution Area VI.\n\nGerman 230-0 – Berlin and the Culture of Democracy\n\nThis class aims to introduce students to the history and culture of Berlin from 1900 to the present. Drawing on a wide range of media, from maps through film to music, the class concentrates on a series of transformative moments in German cultural history seen through the prism of Berlin. Students will engage with the varied historical, socio-political, and artistic changes in German culture throughout the twentieth century, including the vibrant and provocative culture of the 1920s and early 1930s, with a focus on changing forms of gender identity (the “New Woman”) and sexual subcultures (as in the film Cabaret). Further, students will examine the everyday and extraordinary history of German-Jews in Germany around the devastating caesura of the Jewish genocide executed by the National Socialists. After examining the megalomaniacal plans that the Nazis made for Berlin, the class turns to the devastated city of 1945 and the divided city of the Cold War, where the conflict between “East” and “West” emerges in the “concrete” form of the Berlin Wall. Further topics include the events surrounding the collapse of the Wall and the creation of the Berlin Republic, the changing face of national culture in light of the migration of the so-called Turkish “guest workers” of the post-War years, particularly through the art of later generations of Turkish-German authors and filmmakers in Berlin.\n\nPrerequisites: None.\n\nThis course counts for Distribution Area IV and Area VI.\n\nGerman 232-0 – The Theme of Faust through the Ages\n\n\"To sell one's soul,\" \"to strike a bargain with the devil,\" or even \"to beat the devil at his own game,\" these expressions and others like them have retained their currency for centuries and continue to enjoy undiminished popularity. Also for centuries, \"Faust,\" as a figure of the \"mad genius,\" has served as a formulaic abbreviation for the folly, daring, and danger in pursuing human ambition at any price. The Faust who made his pact in the sixteenth century undergoes many mutations and incarnations over the years, and so does the devil as well as the contract that would burden human enterprise with a final debt to inhumanity. The texts selected for this course probe the history of this contract as a specifically modern phenomenon and address the question of what terms would assure it the undiminished supply of signatories that have kept the theme of Faust alive throughout the ages. The final section of the class generally includes a discussion of Faust-themed films. Readings will include Christopher Marlowe, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Charles Baudelaire, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Thomas Mann.\n\nPrerequisites: None.\n\nThis course counts for Distribution Area V and Area VI.\n\nGerman 234-1 – Jews and Germans: An Intercultural History I\n\nThis course examines a series of German-Jewish writers, thinkers, and scientists of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, each of whom, in his or her own way, created transformative projects, programs, and perspectives from which the modern world can be seen. The class will consider the extent to which the specific experience of German Jewry, with its extraordinary cultural as well as scientific advancement and its abysmal political impotence, played an important part in the creation of global modernity. The course is divided into four sections: the first section examines writers of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries who are seeking innovative forms of writing and action in response to a political and social environment in which the traditional rabbinate has lost its authority, while a newly racialized movement declaring itself “anti-Semitic” has formed political parties in both the new German and the old Austrian Empires; the second section concerns the re-assertion of Jewish messianism in the thought of Hermann Cohen, Martin Buber, and Franz Rosenzweig; the third section concentrates on a radical transformation of literary and critical modes of reflection in the writings of Franz Kafka and Walter Benjamin; and the fourth section highlights two revolutionary scientists, Sigmund Freud and Albert Einstein, who changed the way the modern world conceives of mind and matter alike.\n\nPrerequisites: None.\n\nThis course counts for Distribution Area IV, Area V, and Area VI.\n\nGerman 234-2 – Jews and Germans: An Intercultural History II\n\nThis course examines a series of German-Jewish writers, thinkers, and scientists of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, each of whom, in his or her own way, created transformative projects, programs, and perspectives from which the modern world can be seen. The class will consider the extent to which the specific experience of German Jewry, with its extraordinary cultural as well as scientific advancement and its abysmal political impotence, played an important part in the creation of global modernity. The course is divided into four sections: the first section examines writers of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries who are seeking innovative forms of writing and action in response to a political and social environment in which the traditional rabbinate has lost its authority, while a newly racialized movement declaring itself “anti-Semitic” has formed political parties in both the new German and the old Austrian Empires; the second section concerns the re-assertion of Jewish messianism in the thought of Hermann Cohen, Martin Buber, and Franz Rosenzweig; the third section concentrates on a radical transformation of literary and critical modes of reflection in the writings of Franz Kafka and Walter Benjamin; and the fourth section highlights two revolutionary scientists, Sigmund Freud and Albert Einstein, who changed the way the modern world conceives of mind and matter alike.\n\nPrerequisites: None.\n\nThis course counts for Distribution Area IV, Area V, and Area VI.\n\nGerman 236-0 – Kafka and Nietzsche\n\nThis course takes its point of departure from two sayings: “there are no facts, only interpretations” (Nietzsche), and “Only here is suffering suffering” (Kafka). It explores the relationship between suffering and interpretation. For Nietzsche, the interpretation of suffering – real or imagined – is not only the origin of all moral and legal categories but also the source of philosophical speculation. For many of the characters that inhabit Kafka’s fictions, suffering – real or imagined – generates interminable interpretations, and the interminability of interpretation is itself the source of intensified suffering. Beginning with, and continually returning to, Kafka’s very short story, “The New Advocate,” which is about Alexander the Great’s horse, who has lowered his ambitions and thus become a lawyer, the course considers the question: what is greatness? In the first part of the course we pursue this question in the context of certain sections from Nietzsche’s Thus Spoke Zarathustra and from his Toward the Genealogy of Morals. In the second, we turn to a series of Kafka stories, aphorisms, and his great unfinished novel, The Castle.\n\nPrerequisites: None.\n\nThis course counts for Distribution Area V, and Area VI.\n\nGerman 238-0 – Turn-of-the-Century Vienna\n\nThis course highlights ideas and art brought forth during the period of Viennese history from the late 1880s to the 1920s, when Vienna emerged as one of the major intellectual and artistic hubs in Europe. Art Nouveau, the advent of psychoanalysis, and a society that turned its gaze inward, away from the Monarchy, paved the way for the era of Viennese Modernism. Freud, Wittgenstein, Schnitzler, Musil, Schönberg, Klimt, Kokoschka, Schiele are just some of the great names in fin-de-siècle Vienna that identify it as a major mindscape of modernist culture. For a few decades Vienna was the principal rival of Paris as the cultural capital of Europe with a considerable impact on the modern consciousness up to our time.\n\nPrerequisites: None.\n\nThis course counts for Distribution Area VI.\n\nGerman 242 – Imagining Modern Jewish Culture in Yiddish and German\n\nThe aim of this course is to introduce students to the dynamic tension between two distinct yet closely related Jewish cultures, one rooted in the German language, the other in Yiddish. The relation between modern German-Jewish culture and its Yiddish counterpart in Eastern Europe is at once highly-fraught and astonishingly creative: both sides of this divide at the heart of greater European modernity now see themselves in relation to each other, sometimes disparaging, sometimes emulating the other. In literature, art and music the encounter between Western and Eastern European Jewry lies at the heart of 20th Century culture. The course will examine the works of world-famous artists such as Kafka, Chagall, and Mahler as well as classic writers of a literature that is unfamiliar to most: Mendele the Bookseller, Sholem Aleichem, and Y.L. Peretz.\n\nPrerequisites: None.\n\nThis course counts for Distribution Area VI.\n\nGerman 244 – Analyzing Freud\n\nThis class examines the life and work of the groundbreaking Viennese psychologist Sigmund Freud from a comparative and interdisciplinary angle. Long after his death, Freud’s legacy continues to be controversial: some claim that his theories are no longer relevant in the light of new research, whereas others defend his theories and/or expand upon the implications and influence of his ideas, in the realm not only of psychology, medicine, and neuroscience, but also in the fields of sociology, cultural studies, philosophy, literary studies, criminal justice, queer studies, gender’s studies, and many more. What is certain, however, is that Freud’s work—and the image of his life—have marked the modern world. This class will read fundamental texts from Freud’s body of work in dialogue with texts by Freud’s near and distant predecessors and followers, both to situate Freud in his historical and cultural context, and to think through the many different kinds of questions that Freud’s work addresses.\n\nPrerequisites: None.\n\nThis course counts for Distribution Area VI.\n\nGerman 246-0 – Special Topics in German Literature and Culture\n\nCourses taught under this heading may address various topics at the intersection of German literature, culture, and history. Topics may include: From Luther to Bismarck, a seminar which highlights the road to German unity from Martin Luther's Protestant Reformation to Bismarck and the founding of the German Empire with emphasis on the Thirty Years’ War, the intellectual and national awakening of the German people in the 18th century, the impact of the French Revolution on German affairs, the flowering of German culture in the Enlightenment and the Classicism of Goethe's Weimar, the Romantic movement, as represented by Schopenhauer, Hegel, Beethoven, Schubert, and Wagner. Please consult Caesar for current topic. German 246 may be repeated for credit with different topics.\n\nPrerequisites: None.\n\nThis course counts for Distribution Area VI.\n\nGerman 248 – Learning Diversity: Germany and Global Migration\n\nWith the so-called refugee crisis re-defining Europe’s self-perception, Germany is very much in the focus of global attention: The government’s decision to accommodate more than a million refugees in 2015 met praise and criticism alike, both inside and outside of Germany. The influx of hundreds of thousands of people from Syria, Afghanistan, and other countries has given new urgency to questions of what immigration and a diverse population means for Germany and how practices and policies have to change. The class will follow and analyze these discussions from a historical standpoint so that students are better able to evaluate German positions on immigration, citizenship, and diversity today.\n\nPrerequisites: None.\n\nThis course counts for Distribution Area IV.\n\nGerman 266-0 – Introduction to Yiddish Culture: Images of the Shtetl\n\nIn collective memory the shtetl (small Jewish town) has become enshrined as the symbolic space of close-knit, Jewish community in Eastern Europe; it is against the backdrop of this idealized shtetl that the international blockbuster Fiddler on the Roof is enacted. This seminar explores the spectrum of representations of the shtetl in Yiddish literature from the nineteenth century to the post-Holocaust period. The discussion will also focus on artistic and photographic depictions of the shtetl: Chagall and Roman Vishniac in particular. The course will include a screening of Fiddler on the Roof followed by a discussion of this film based upon a comparison with the text upon which it is based, “Tevye the Milkman.”\n\nPrerequisites: None.\n\nThis course counts for Distribution Area VI.\n\nGerman 272-0 – Luther and the West\n\nOctober 31, 2017 marked the 500th anniversary of the Protestant Reformation. This anniversary commemorated the day the German monk Martin Luther is said to have posted his 95 Theses on the church door in Wittenberg, Germany. The results of Luther’s ideas and actions cannot be understated. His teachings led to an ongoing division between Roman Catholic and Protestant forms of Christianity and inaugurated a “modern” turn towards rationalism, secularism, and individualism. This course probes the lasting significance of Luther’s life and thought in the modern West. Two questions will guide the course. First, how did Luther shape the cultural, political, and social questions and issues in the West since the 16th century? And, second, what is Luther’s ongoing relevance in the West today?\n\nPrerequisites: None.\n\nThis course counts for Distribution Area IV and Area V.\n\nGerman 326-0 – German Cultural Studies\n\nCourses taught under this heading explore key concepts, major figures, and cultural and literary themes in German studies and interdisciplinary fields such as political science, media studies, music, and art. Topics may include: Racism in modern Germany, a seminar that explores the ways in which the contested category of race has shaped modern German history. While considerations of race in Germany generally focus on Nazism and the Holocaust, the aim of this course is to situate racial categories like ‘Aryan’ and ‘Jew’ within a longer and contextual narrative. The course will examine German relationships with and fantasies of Africans, Jews, Slavs, Turks, Gypsies, Aryans and the many other categories of peoples who shaped modern Germany. While the seminar itself focuses on German history, the course is intended to raise larger questions about the roles of race and racism in the modern world at large. Please consult Caesar for current topic. German 326 may be repeated for credit with different topics.\n\nPrerequisites: None.\n\nGerman 328-0 – German Cultural Criticism from Kant to Kluge\n\nExploration of major texts in German cultural criticism form the late 18th to early 21st century, including philosophical, philological, scientific, and essayistic texts.\n\nPrerequisite: None. (Distro Area IV and V)\n\nGerman 334-0 – Writers and their Critics\n\nCourses under this rubric will expose students to texts of leading writers in German through a discussion of the criticism these texts have evoked. Students will thereby be given the opportunity to reflect on the relationship between literary texts and their historical and critical interpretation. Topics may include: Kafka and the Question of the Narrator, a seminar on the question of the narrator and the role the narrative plays in Kafka’s fiction. Much of Kafka criticism avoids this question either by equating the narrator with the author and focusing on “Kafka,” or by regarding the narrative as transparent and focusing on the objects represented. Perhaps the most powerful and significant aspect of his writings relates, however, to the ambiguous figure and discourse of the narrator. The narrative never simply relates a series of events existing independently of the perspective from which they are presented. It thereby reveals something about the process of story-telling as well as of the different figures and events involved in it. Please consult Caesar for current topic. German 334 may be repeated for credit with different topics.\n\nPrerequisites: None.\n\nThis course counts for Distribution Area VI.\n\nGerman 344-1-0 – German History: Weimar and Nazi Germany\n\nSurvey of German political, economic, social, intellectual, and diplomatic history covering Weimar and Nazi Germany. Taught with History 344-1; may not receive credit for both courses.\n\nGerman 344-2 – German History: Germany Since 1945\n\nDebates about the development of the postwar German states from 1945 to the present. Social, political, economic, and everyday history within the context of East, West, and unified Germany. Taught with History 344-2; may not receive credit for both courses.\n\nGerman 346-0 – Topics in German Literature and Culture\n\nCourses under this heading examine at an advanced level selected topics in German literature and/or pivotal periods in German culture. Topics may include: On Historical Epistemology, a class on the theory and history of the modern sciences, with an emphasis on the emergence of a new science called “biology” in the nineteenth century. The organizing thread for this class will be the contribution that different streams of twentieth-century philosophy of science made to the process of discovery and justification of knowledge. Please consult Caesar for current topic. German 346 may be repeated for credit with different topics.\n\nPrerequisites: None.\n\nThis course counts for Distribution Area VI.\n\nGerman 366-0 – Yiddish Culture and the Holocaust\n\nThis course begins with an examination of certain works of Modern Yiddish Literature written before the Holocaust that are uncanny in their premonitions of disaster. The course then proceeds to read Yiddish literature written during the Holocaust, especially the Warsaw and Vilna ghetto diaries. It concludes with a discussion of the outpouring of Yiddish literary responses to the Holocaust from 1945 to 2000. The literature examined remains a dark continent for the majority of scholars of both the Holocaust and of modern Jewish culture. Thus, this course serves also as an introduction to a magnificent literature in its own right.\n\nPrerequisites: None.\n\nThis course counts for Distribution Area VI.\n\nBack to top\n\nCOURSES Taught in german\n\nGerman 101-1,2,3 – Beginning German\n\nThe Beginning German sequence offers students a systematic introduction to German language and culture emphasizing the four modalities: speaking, listening comprehension, reading and writing.

There are two versions of the course. In Brothers Grimm students will be exposed to versions of the Kinder- und Hausmärchen collected by the brothers Grimm and adaptations by later authors. These texts will be used to investigate the culture and values of the period and will also examine the historical framework, which led to the collection of these tales and a development of the genre. In Tension in the Modern Age: 20th Century Women of the Arts examines the explosion of art and industry at the turn of the century that for the first time included substantial opportunities for women. Through short historical texts, biographies, letters and journals, students will learn about social issues, art movements and the German politics of the period that included Bismarck, colonies and war.\n\nPrerequisite in German: German 102-2. (This course will not count for the language requirement but may be taken concurrently with 102-3.)\n\nGerman 203-0 – Focus Speaking\n\nThis course is designed to enhance the aural/oral skills by training students in listening comprehension and speaking. Vocabulary and idioms employed in everyday conversational German will be introduced and practiced in communicative activities such as role-playing, listening to and creating podcasts in German and small group discussions.

By studying selected elements of film, including genre, contexts, actors, directors, production and reception, film history, in addition to central thematic and formal elements of film, students will also learn the basics of film analysis. This course is taught entirely in German and emphasizes developing cultural knowledge and German language skills.\n\nPrerequisite in German: One 200-level course in German or permission of the DUS.\n\nThis course counts for Distribution Area VI.\n\nGERMAN 213-0 – Politics, History, and Culture in 21st-Century Germany\n\nThis course is specifically designed for students who would like to prepare for studying abroad and/or would like to deepen their cultural and linguistic knowledge regarding integration and multicultural life in Germany. The topics covered in the course will focus partly on topics covered in the German integration course (Integrationskurs), a program developed in Germany specifically for immigrants. Topics will include a brief history of Germany in the 20th century and how it affects life in the 21st century, the meaning of democracy, Germany as a welfare state, life in unified Germany and Europe, political and educational structures, religious and intercultural integration and social networks. With this course, students will be prepared for the final examination, the “Life Germany” test, an examination written for immigrants in Germany.\n\nPrerequisite in German: One 200-level course in German or permission of the DUS.\n\nThis course counts for Distribution Area III.\n\nGerman 221-1 – Introduction to Literature: 1800-1900\n\nThis course, designed for majors and non-majors, presents an overview of German literary history of the 19th century – from Weimar classicism to radical modernist movements of the 1890s. Students will learn to closely examine representative texts such as poetry, prose, and drama with a special focus on the rapidly changing historical and literary environment that was typical for this period.

Literary and philosophical texts are read side by side in order to interrogate traditional concepts of realism, mimesis, and interpretation.\n\nOne of the many questions raised by the recent Covid-19 pandemic, concerns the notion of. \"community\" and more specifically, its relation to the kinds of separation and \"distancing\" imposed by it. This course seeks to respond to this situation by returning to a discussion started in the 1980s, mainly in France, about the continuing relevance or irrelevance of the notion of \"community,\" and related words, including \"communism,\" \"communion,\" \"communication.\" One of the distinctive aspects of the French discussion was that the notion of literature and more generally writing played an important role. The seminar proposes to return to the discussion between Jean-Luc Nancy and Maurice Blanchot concerning the notion of \"community,\" and its relation to \"literature\" (Nancy even writes of \"literary communism\"). Nancy continued to reflect on the possible relevance of this notion in the following decades, including his experience of the recent pandemic. At the core of the discussion is the question of what can form the basis of the \"common\" that is the root of all \"community\" as well as of the other words mentioned, and to what extent it necessarily implies an irreducible dimension of separation -- of which the experience of reading and writing \"literary texts\" might be an exemplary instance.\n\nGERMAN 403 – German Literature, Critical Thought, and New Media, 1900-45 (1)\n\nBuilt around selected key texts on the aesthetic theories of modernism (e.g., by Nietzsche, Adorno, Bürger, and Kittler), this course explores the relationship of literature and the visual arts and scrutinizes the status of literature within aesthetic production in modernity.
