        "meta_description": "The form of theme and variations occupies a central position in Beethoven’s development as a composer, and is discernible throughout his life either as part of multi-movement works or as independent compositions. The use of slow variations in many of his sets was significant for Beethoven, as these carry structural and artistic implications. This chapter investigates how Beethoven used slow variations and where they appear, and raises questions concerning originality and plausible influences. Though Haydn’s influence on Beethoven’s variations has been a much-debated topic, Mozart influenced Beethoven as much as Haydn, if not more, in variation sets. Beethoven’s approach to the form can in turn be traced in generations of later composers.",
