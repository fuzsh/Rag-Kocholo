        "text": "It's a good week for Warner. The company has released five \"A\" titles on DVD, all of which get the special edition treatment. The belle of the ball? Amadeus: Director's Cut. This 1984 classic by Milos Forman has been in desperate need of re-release since the original, flip-it-half-way-through-the-movie hit the shelves. Any movie that earned eight Academy Awards during the dirty 80s deserves a little something special.\n\nWarner did it right with Amadeus. With a nicely restored transfer, a gorgeous soundtrack, and an impressive documentary on the bonus disc, any fan of the film should add this to their library. And if you haven't seen the film, then this is the one to rent/buy.\n\nThe Movie\n\nAmadeus takes place over one evening throughout which Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) confesses his \"murder\" of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce). The movie is about mediocrity short-circuiting in the face of greatness - Salieri short-circuiting in the face of Mozart. As Salieri comes clean to the priest in the madhouse we are taken through the history of the two men. Salieri was the Court Composer for Emperor Joseph II (Jeffrey Jones), a hell of a post to have. Mozart shows up on the scene impressing the hell out of everyone, Salieri most of all. Salieri, who calls Mozart \"The Creature,\" sabotages Mozart's career whenever he can, all the while pretending to be a champion of the prodigy's work. Ultimately Mozart ends up in a pauper's grave in a dirty sack, after basically being worked to death by Salieri and partying his ass off.\n\nMilos Forman (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest) handles the direction masterfully. I actually think Forman is overrated, but in Mozart he's on very steady ground. (Starting with an extremely sharp script from Peter Shaffer, who wrote the play on which the movie was based, probably didn't hurt.) The movie is simply luxurious: huge, ornate stage settings; bright, colorful circus like street scenes; gorgeous costumes. The new Director's Cut adds twenty minutes of restored footage. Though this version of the film clocks in at around three hours, Forman's pacing keeps the story moving very effectively. Some of the new material is unnecessary, but the movie still stays fresh throughout its entirety.\n\nForman had a tremendous cast to work with. Unfortunately after the film most of them didn't do much important work at all. Jeffrey Jones, hella funny as the Emperor, has had some funny splashes here and there, but for the most part the cast went back to the small roles from whence they came for the film. Hulce and Abraham fit into their roles very naturally and work off one another extremely well. Elizabeth Berridge, who replaced Meg Tilly as Mozart's wife just weeks before shooting started, is perfect as the tough chick from the gutter trying to pull together a marriage with an irresponsible genius. Why she didn't stay on top after Amadeus is beyond me. The supporting cast is full of familiar faces that give the film a very \"completed,\" very finished feel.\n\nA nice sampling of Mozart plays throughout the film. He's no Billy Joel, but it works.\n\n9 out of 10\n\nThe Video\n\nThe new widescreen anamorphic transfer does wonders for the film. The new transfer was assembled from the restored director's cut that toured theaters last year. In other words, it was restored for the big screen and then a new digital transfer was made for the DVD. The result is an extremely sharp, noise-free, colorful presentation with very few flaws. It's loaded with very complex material, i.e. extremely ornate stage works and highly detailed costumes and environments, but the image is always crisp and natural looking. However, it seems that the producers went a little heavy with the edge enhancement at times. There are a few scenes with tall vertical objects and at times they don't even look like they're part of the same movie. It's as if the edges themselves become another dimension. However, the overall image quality is first-rate and these minor occurrences don't detract too much.\n\n8 out of 10\n\nThe Audio\n\nGet ready to turn down your system when you fire up this disc. I'm all for lease-breaking volumes, but this disc is recorded extremely loudly. I ran my receiver roughly 15% lower than I usually would and it was plenty loud. The initial menu gives you the choice of Dolby Digital 5.1 or 2.0. Thankfully the DVD producers went lightly with the surround sound mix. I say thankfully because I could easily imaging an overly dramatic use of the surround channels, which I think would have killed the pristine audio track. During most of the film the rear speakers are fairly quiet. During Mozart's concerts the surround channels perk up and compliment the fronts and center pleasantly without getting too busy.\n\nI actually recommend watching Amadeus in stereo as well. I ended up preferring two-channel because I think that's how the music itself sounds best. It's not an action film loaded with insane effects that deserve to be flying around the room. It's a quietly loud movie that should slap you directly in the face, which is just what the delightful stereo mix does.\n\nAs for overall audio quality, the soundtrack is stunning. Simply stunning.\n\n9 out of 10\n\nThe Extras\n\nWhile the package includes a bonus disc, the real business is the added footage in the main movie disc. The restored twenty minutes are peppered throughout the film and most are extensions of already existing scenes. There are, however, a few entirely new sections. Unfortunately, most of the new footage is unnecessary. It does little to further develop the characters or move the story. For instance, several new scenes involve Mozart taking on the daughter of a rich merchant with a bunch of really annoying dogs. The scene is somewhat comical, but it's far too long and really not crucial. We already know that The Creature can't work under imposed conditions and has a blimp-size ego. Other restored scenes explain certain actions more completely. The scene where Constanze throws herself at Salieri for the sake of her husband is much longer and explicit. The old version cut sooner, but you knew what was happening. Even Forman complains about this addition.\n\nStrangely, the bonus disc has only one featurette on it. It's a nice bonus, but you'd expect more from an entire disc. You do get to see some great production shots and hear some entertaining anecdotes, but it's light fare. F. Murray Abraham comes off like a dick, which is sort of funny to watch.\n\nThe commentary is the best extra of the bundle. Forman and Shaffer do a handy job of adding historical context to both the film and the production. The commentary is a bit stark at times -- Forman even mentions that they're getting paid and should talk more -- but what is there is really first rate stuff. These two are extremely smart, very well informed individuals and add much to the already excellent movie. You even learn how one prostitute was responsible for the demise of two brilliant composers in Vienna.\n\n8 out of 10"
