        "text": "He told me.\n\nAs far as I know, he complained about particular instruments and their\n\nbuilders; not about the instrument in general.\n\nNo, it's not an established fact, but once it will. I am aware of the fact\n\nthat many people see the history of the piano as a straight line of\n\ntechnical improvements, that stopped exactly in our modern days. But piano\n\nbuilding is always a matter of compromising. Each era had the instruments\n\nthat belong to the music of that time. Think of the harpsichord. Think of\n\nthe cornetto. Think of the viola da gamba. Irreplacable by any modern\n\ninstrument.\n\nThe 18th- and 19th century builders were very capable men (and women!), that\n\nknew perfectly what they were doing. In Mozart's and Beethoven's time they\n\nworked closely together with Viennese composers in order to produce\n\ninstruments that served the compositions optimal. Most composers had their\n\nfavorite builder. Each of them strived for his own personal sound, not for\n\nuniformity. Not yet.\n\nBesides, these pioneers modelled their instruments after the orchestra by\n\ngiving them three registers: a high one, a low one and one in between. A\n\nmelody played on the higher keys had a different timbre and character than\n\nplayed on other parts of the piano. A nightmare for a modern piano builder!\n\nIn modern piano building they strive for a unity of sound in all the\n\nregisters; just the opposite of the early days. Mozart exploited these\n\ndifferent tone colors in his sonatas, just like Beethoven did, and, most of\n\nall in my opinion, Schubert.\n\nSo to me it is logical that since Mozart wrote his pianomusic for the early\n\npianoforte, this is the instrument that communicates the music best. Better\n\nthan a synthesizer, an organ or a modern Steinway or Bosendorfer.\n\nBut the biggest prove to me is my ears. They hear that a good pianoforte\n\nfits the music like a glove.\n\nOf course, that doesn't mean that all pianoforte recordings are good ones. I\n\nknow some pretty bad ones. Besides, only in the last 10 or 15 years they\n\nhave managed to build perfect replicas and restore old ones well, so on many\n\nof the old recordings the sound is harsh or the instrument is out of tune.\n\nMm. Yes, Beethoven once said that the (forte)piano was such an\n\ninadequate instrument. But he had a very personal problem. He wanted an\n\ninstrument subtle in articulation and expression, like an old Viennese one;\n\nat the same time it had to sing like a Broadwood. But alas, articulation\n\nand legato don't combine very well. And Beethoven did not have a\n\ncompromising character, did he?\n\nNevertheless, whatever he wanted, he wrote his sonatas for the available\n\ninstruments. We can see this from the autographs - especially those of his\n\nlate sonatas, which show thousands of small articulation signs, that are\n\npractically unplayable on a modern piano, simply because its resonance is\n\ntoo big and because its lack of diversity in sound.\n\nThen there is the element of balance. Beethoven always tried to go beyond\n\nthe possibilities of every instrument, just as he stretched the\n\npossibilities of classical form. In fact, he complained about virtually\n\nevery instrument, including the human voice.\n\nThe element of tension in his pianosonatas can only be realized on a\n\nSteinway if the performer makes a lot of noise; much more than is possible\n\non a pianoforte.\n\nSo you can guess that this is at the expense of subtlety.\n\nAnother thing is that in his early sonatas he wrote chords that suggested to\n\ngo beyond the reach of the instrument (That had only 5 or 6 octaves, I\n\nthink). Very exciting. Not anymore when played on a modern piano, where the\n\nperformer stops somewhere in the middle of the keys.\n\nWhat can I say more? That listening to old pianos needs practice. It takes\n\ntime to learn to know the different sound and recognize the timbres. One of\n\nthe nicest things is the big diversity between pianofortes; they all sound\n\ndifferent. Much more than is the case with modern pianos.\n\nFrank"
