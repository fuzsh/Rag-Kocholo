        "text": "Today is the 265th anniversary of Mozart’s birth, and I’ve been thinking about “Amadeus”. It is by no means an accurate history, nor does it claim to be, any more than Shakespeare’s “Macbeth” purports to give an impeccably researched history of medieval Scotland. In fact, I would argue that the real focus of Amadeus is not Mozart at all.\n\nWhy is it called “Amadeus”? Why not “Wolfgang”, or “Mozart”, or perhaps more accurately “Salieri”, who is the narrator and main character? I believe that the title tells us that it is at heart a meditation on the nature of religious faith."
