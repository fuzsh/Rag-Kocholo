        "text": "Most of the main Prague locations will be mentioned in ‘Prague Pt III’ and ‘Prague Pt IV’. This entry will include the rest and we start with Kampa Park across the river from the Old Town which featured in the opening 11 minutes of The Bourne Identity and is where Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) duffs up a couple of Zurich policemen (as Prague was used as a substitute for the Swiss city) after they wake him up from his sleep on a bench by the Certovka stream near Charles Bridge. He then runs away through the park passing the tree which I am lurking behind in a menacing way below! The screenshot is below my picture.\n\nNearby were a trio of sculptures which were just crying out for this type of photo (above left) to be done!"
