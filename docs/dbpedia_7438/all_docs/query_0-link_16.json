        "text": "Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (27 January 1756 – 5 December 1791) was an Austrian Classical period composer who was born in Salzburg on January 27, 1756.\n\nHe wrote his first work at age 5 and toured across Europe throughout his childhood with his father Leopold and his sister, Nannerl (Maria Anna Mozart). Later in life, he worked for the Archbishop Colloredo of Salzburg. He left the position in 1781 due to poor treatment and moved to Vienna, where he wrote his most memorable pieces including Eine Kleine Nachtmusik, Piano Concerto No. 21, and Symphony No. 40. He died with his Requiem Mass incomplete on December 5, 1791 at age 35.\n\nHis music appears in both Season 1 and Season 2 of Little Einsteins.\n\nMusic Appearances in Episodes[]\n\nHorn Concerto No. 2[]\n\nWhale Tale\n\nDuck, Duck, June\n\nSerenade No. 13 (Eine kleine Nachtmusik)[]\n\nThe Birthday Balloons\n\nThe Mouse and the Moon\n\nSleeping Bassoon (Background music cameo)\n\nThe Secret Mystery Prize (Background music cameo)\n\nPiano Concerto No. 21[]\n\nAnnie's Love Song\n\nMusic Monsters\n\nSymphony No. 40[]\n\nAnnie and the Little Toy Plane\n\nThe Wild Goose Chase\n\nSheet Music[]\n\nHorn Concerto No. 2 in E-Flat Major, K. 417[]\n\nSerenade No. 13 in G Major, K. 525 (Eine Kleine Nachtmusik)[]\n\nPiano Concerto No. 21 in C Major, K. 467[]\n\nSymphony No. 40 in G Major, K. 550[]\n\nGallery[]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nHe is one of the few composers to appear in both seasons of Little Einsteins, the others being Beethoven, Dvořák, Grieg, and Bizet.\n\nHe is the composer with the most musical appearances in episodes, as his music is used in 10 episodes of the series (4 episodes in Season 1, 4 episodes in Season 2, and another 2 in Season 2 as background music cameos).\n\nHe was a child prodigy; having written his first symphony at the age of 8 and joined the orchestra when he was 15 years old.\n\nHe was the youngest child in his family, made up of seven children, five of whom died in infancy.\n\nHe was baptised a day after his birth, at St. Rupert's Cathedral in Salzburg. The baptismal record gives his name in a Latinized form, as Joannes Chrysostomus Wolfgangus Theophilus Mozart. He generally called himself \"Wolfgang Amadè Mozart\" as an adult, but his name had many variants.\n\nAccording to rumours, he is said to have a rivalry with another composer, the Italian composer Antonio Salieri. This rivalry mostly happened while he apparently worked in Vienna in the 1780s.\n\nHowever, the rivalry between Salieri never existed. Instead, Salieri himself was quite successful in reality and had thought Mozart's son, Franz Xaver Wolfgang Mozart.\n\nHe remains a national icon throughout Austria, several locations in Salzburg have been named in honor of him, such as the Mozartplatz, and the main airport of Salzburg.\n\nAn aircraft owned by the now-defunct Lauda Air was also named in honor of Mozart, however, the aircraft was destroyed in an air accident above Thailand.\n\nAllusions[]"
