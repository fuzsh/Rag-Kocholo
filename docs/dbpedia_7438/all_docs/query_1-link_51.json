New 4K Restoration\n\nFITZCARRALDO\n\nAs chronicled with bravado in Les Blank’s making-of documentary BURDEN OF DREAMS (Fri-Mon, Aug 23-26), Werner Herzog’s backbreaking epic fictionalizes the true-life mission of a South American rubber baron (Klaus Kinski, with gusto) to establish an opera house in the Peruvian jungle — which can only be accomplished by hauling a gigantic river boat over a mountain.\n\nGODZILLA\n\nGODZILLA is the roaring granddaddy of all movie monsters.

Screening in 35mm\n\nHANNAH MONTANA: THE MOVIE\n\nA teenage girl with an overbearing father and a dark secret which threatens to sublimate her own identity is investigated in her rural hometown — and a lost piece of jewelry might be the key to unwinding her intertwined persona in this big screen follow-up to a beloved TV series.\n\nKING KONG\n\nA film crew goes to a tropical island for a location shoot, where they capture a colossal ape who takes a shine to their blonde starlet, and bring him back to New York City.\n\nCLOSE YOUR EYES\n\nSome 50 years after SPIRIT OF THE BEEHIVE, director/co-writer Victor Erice turns in another masterpiece — thus ending a long gap between films with a moving meditation on memory, identity and cinema itself.\n\nENO\n\nThe groundbreaking generative documentary about visionary musician and artist Brian Eno is a film that’s different every day it’s shown — an ephemeral approach that resonates with Eno’s own artistic practice, his methods of using technology to compose music, and his endless deep dive into the mercurial essence of creativity. These versions will never be seen again.\n\nWE ARE FUGAZI FROM WASHINGTON D.C.\n\nCreated to commemorate the 20 years that have passed since D.C.-based post-hardcore band Fugazi’s last live appearance, WE ARE FUGAZI FROM WASHINGTON D.C. is a 96-minute movie comprising crowd sourced, fan recorded live shows and rare archive footage.\n\nTHE COOK, THE THIEF, HIS WIFE & HER LOVER\n\nPart of Staff Picks and programmed by Ter, who says: “This movie is indulgent and gorgeous yet twisted and demented.

EVIL\n\nTwo best friends on vacation at their dilapidated cabin are mistaken for murderous hillbillies by a group of obnoxious preppy college kids in this expertly comedic (and equally gory) skewering of the slasher genre.\n\nTHE GODFATHER PART III\n\nMichael Corleone, now in his 60s, seeks to free his family from crime and find a suitable successor to his empire.
