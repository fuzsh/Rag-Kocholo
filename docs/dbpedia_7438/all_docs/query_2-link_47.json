        "text": "#1 in my ranking of Best Picture winners at the Oscars.\n\nAh, one of my absolute favorite movies. I’ve spoken of it before.\n\nAs I wrote in that piece, every time I watch it now, I’m reminded of my father’s insistence that I would lie it less as I got older, and it continues to not be true. Milos Forman’s adaptation of Peter Shaffer’s play is one of the most deliriously entertaining films I’ve ever seen, and I continue to love its entertainments with every passing year and every subsequent viewing.\n\nThe story of Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) and his jealousy towards the preternatural and God-given gifts bestowed upon the vulgar Wolfgang Mozart (Tom Hulce) is one of contrasts, irony, and an absolute love of music in general and Mozart’s in particular. I mentioned one example of the film’s fantastic editing, mostly around an early scene that transports us from the contemporary setting of the madhouse where Salieri spends his final days after his attempted suicide back to the height of his power as court composer to Emperor Joseph II (Jeffrey Jones), but the film is filled with these little editing flourishes. It’s not just jumping backwards and forwards in time, but the use of music to transition from scene to scene like when his landlady, Frau Weber (Barbara Bryne) who also happens to be his mother-in-law, starts screaming about his weaknesses as a husband cuts to the arrival of the Queen of the Night in The Magic Flute. It’s a cut that nicely smooths over the movement from one kind of scene to another while providing a nice comical moment to bridge them.\n\nThe film’s insistence on entertaining as a high order in its narrative goals stems from its irony as well, with Salieri’s indignation growing from his sense of inferiority in the face of Mozart’s genius, which he seems somewhat alone in seeing, combined with Mozart’s effortlessness at achieving it (with some jealousy around a woman mixed in). It’s this jealousy that manifests in entertaining ways as Salieri must balance his hatred of the man and his love of the man’s music. It’s also where the film finds its pathos for Salieri. His earnestness in the love of Mozart’s music is tangible, and he can’t lie about it.\n\nAnd that leads to the dichotomy within Mozart as well. He’s a spoiled brat, as the Prince-Archbishop of Salzberg explains to Mozart’s father, but he also has a deep and genuine love for music (mostly his own). His description of the second act of Figaro, where two voices add until there are five and it’s sustained for twenty minutes, is so impassioned for its merits in the face of the source material’s political issues that it’s just a love for what he can do to music while keeping it grand. That gets countered with his insufferable personality (the laugh) and his inability to see how he would insult people in how he treats them (his comment about how Salieri should give him pointers on making his art more obvious for the masses obviously cuts pretty deeply). I’m pretty sure we’re supposed to find him insufferable just as Salieri did, and the heavy use of Mozart’s music is meant to counter that.\n\nAnd the music is one of the chief joys in the film. Staging the operas grandly on stages that Mozart’s company actually performed on with full orchestral arrangements give the music an immediately and life that the film takes full advantage of preventing the film from ever feeling like a stodgy costume drama. This is full of life, and the performances are a key cornerstone of that. The liveliness of the performances from Hulce to Abraham’s sarcasm and multi-faceted approach (I can see why Academy voters would give the Best Actor award to Abraham over Hulce) and the wounded pride and simmering anger of Elizabeth Berridge as Constanze all work together with the smaller performances, like Jones and his private smiles as the Emperor while asking for the things he himself banned, all combine to imbue the film with life and fun and pathos towards the end.\n\nThis was independent filmmaking at some of its grandest and most amusing. It’s funny, touching, and very smart. It’s an expert adaptation of Schaffer’s play by himself, expanding the action well-beyond Salieri’s cell to keep things moving and colorful.\n\nForman feels like a complete master at the helm of it all, though. His compositions are assured. Performances are great all around. The editing (done by Nena Danevic and Michael Chandler) is obviously designed from the earliest stages. This is Forman as commander of the action, assuredly guiding the production through all of its shooting and post-production to create a fantastic entertainment from top to bottom.\n\nIt’s still one of my favorite films.\n\nRating: 4/4"
