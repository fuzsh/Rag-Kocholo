        "text": "The Film Amadeus\n\nThis paper will take a look into the movie Amadeus, to see if the film accurately\n\ndepicts the history of Amadeus and the enlightenment of the characters. The time period\n\nthat the film takes place in is the 18th century. There is a mixture of social class in this\n\nfilm. There are rulers and commoners shown in this film. The main characters in the film\n\nwhich are Mozart, Salieri, and Emperor Joseph represent actual historical figures. The\n\nfilm was made in 1984.\n\nThe film was somewhat accurate with the characters and the time, but for the\n\nmost part the film never stated what year everything was happening in.

Another example was when Mozart was plan on doing an opera on The\n\nMarriage of Figaro. This was a very risqué opera. Mozart promised that it not going to be\n\na vulgar opera. Joseph again agreed to this opera, even do his subjects didn’t agree. Then\n\nduring rehearsals there was ballet in the opera which was against the law to have in the\n\nopera. This law was made by Joseph. Then after seeing the play without it, he wanted it\n\nin because it didn’t look right. He basically changed his own law, to the displeased of his\n\nsubjects again. Emperor Joseph showed enlightenment many times in this film.\n\nMozart can be viewed as an enlightenment hero. He stood against the opposition\n\nof the church and the convention. For"
