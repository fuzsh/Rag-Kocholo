        "text": "Just watched this classic movie and it got me thinking. One of the greatest misconceptions from the movie Amadeus is that Salieri poisons Mozart at the end. However Salieri never does, while he talks about killing Mozart at the start of the movie, Mozart dies before he has the chance. People still say how the film was wrong to show that Salieri poisoned Mozart. In reality the only thing you could say from the movie is that Salieri worked Mozart to death, by making him finish the Requiem.\n\nYeah, the Requiem has been \"finished\" (reconstructed would be a more apt term, and just barely) by various peolpe at various times with various degrees of success but never by Salieri. In fact, the movie is more of a character study, and an excerscise in creative mythology than an actual historical drama. Nevertheless, it is a great film."
