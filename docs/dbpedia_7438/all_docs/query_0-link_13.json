        "text": "This week‚Äôs theme is‚Ä¶Yet More Syndication! I‚Äôm hard at work on more great content for the weeks ahead. Until then, enjoy just a few more of my favorite episodes in rerun üôÇ\n\nYet More Syndication, Day 1 ‚Äì ‚ÄúSunday Traffic‚Äù from The City by Aaron Copland\n\nHave you ever been to a World‚Äôs Fair? They‚Äôre sometimes called ‚ÄúWorld Expositions‚Äù or ‚ÄúExpos‚Äù and I didn‚Äôt even know they are still around. But they are. The last one was in May of this year (2015), in Milan, and they actually happen pretty regularly:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_world%27s_fairs\n\nAnd I had no idea they were still going on! So if you find yourself in Alanya, Turkey in 2016 or Astana, Kazakhstan in 2017, you should definitely drop by and check out the World Expo. Sort of like a mix between a state fair, the Olympics (which moves from world city to world city) and Disney‚Äôs Tomorrowland with its better-living-through-chemistry kind of theme, there‚Äôs nothing else quite like them. If you are fortunate enough to catch one, I imagine you can expect to be overwhelmed, fascinated and inspired by a colorful mix of exhibitions and forward-thinking ideas.\n\nOne of the most famous World‚Äôs Fairs was that of 1939 in New York City. It was also one of the largest and longest lasting in history. Over the course of its 18-month run, it attracted just short of 45 million visitors from around the world to its array of exhibits and monuments which covered more than 1,000 acres in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, located in New York City‚Äôs borough of Queens.\n\nWhile the intention of the masterminds behind the 1939 World‚Äôs Fair was to revitalize America‚Äôs sagging spirit and economy, both hampered by the Great Depression, the event and its distinctive architecture have transcended their original intention to become iconic of the American sensibilities that gave rise to the Baby Boomer generation, technologically forward-looking yet culturally retrospective. The famous Trylon and Perisphere structures, evoking a naive sci-fi feeling, set the visual tone for the fair‚Äôs theme, The World of Tomorrow.\n\nThe fair was full of evocative architecture, events and exhibits in accordance with that theme, including: ‚ÄúFuturama‚Äù (no, not that one!), the Westinghouse Time Capsule (not to be opened for 5,000 years), an enormous ceramic sculpture of an atom, and the world‚Äôs first science fiction convention. One of the lesser-known exhibits was a short film created by the American Institute of Planners, a professional organization for urban planners, called The City. Created in 1939, this 30 minute black-and-white film is, by many an evaluation, closer to a propaganda piece than a true documentary. But it is a fascinating piece of vintage filmmaking. Cast in 3 acts, it celebrates the farm life of yesteryear, decries the dehumanizing effect of the sprawling, unplanned industrial-age cities that have grown out of control, and finally suggests a wholesome alternative in planned communities that are able to harmonize modern conveniences with the tranquility of the past, very much keeping in line with the 1939 World‚Äôs Fair‚Äôs theme of The World of Tomorrow. Actually, these planned communities celebrated by the AIP‚Äôs film were not entirely in the future. Examples of these ‚ÄúGreenbelt‚Äù communities (so named for the ring of public-held forested land encircling the towns that would keep the landscape green and ensure a perpetual size and shape to the urban landscape) had been established during the 1930s with one each in Wisconsin, Ohio and Maryland.\n\nCarefully planned to balance residential and commercial zones, and always encircled by a belt of green to insulate from the surrounding urban jungle, these small towns were created by New Deal bureaucracies that set income levels for for their residents and and designed them to run as cooperative communities. The concept is highly idealistic, but it seemed to work for these towns. After about a decade the lands, initially owned by the federal government, were gradually sold to the towns‚Äô inhabitants. These communities really could not have been built during any other decade or in any other political climate. In learning about them one senses they are permeated through and through by New Deal philosophy.\n\nThis functional idealism comes through very clearly in The City, with its stiff but florid narration, and especially the filmmakers‚Äô choice of composer, a highly significant American musician who, at this time, was busy establishing a populist manner of composition for American listeners, Aaron Copland. Coming to maturity in the 1920s, Copland at first gravitated to the spiky avant-garde stylings popular in Europe around that time, but eventually tired of it and, after settling more permanently in his native land, began to create a more accessible and distinctly iconic American style of music starting in the 1930s. All of his best-known Americana works are written in this style and were created during the late 1930s and early 1940s. These include Appalachian Spring, Billy the Kid, Rodeo, and the stirring Lincoln Portrait. All of these beloved scores successfully fuse the lyricism of American folk song (either authentic or keenly imitated) with an infectious rhythmic drive, broadcast through remarkably clear and astringent orchestration, even during the busiest passages. There are also noble sections of calm, flat terrain that seem to simultaneously evoke both the sweeping amber waves of grain, and the clean, imposing monuments of Washington D.C. And the small group of film scores that Copland composed during the 1930s and 1940s, Hollywood and otherwise, presented one ideal venue to present this new American aesthetic.\n\nThe City is a fine showcase of all of Copland‚Äôs colors and moods. You can watch the full 30 minute film here and get a sense of everything he could do:\n\nOne of the most infectious sections of the score is called ‚ÄúSunday Traffic‚Äù and it comes right at the end of the second act. While the beginning of the act is demoralizing, drab and depressing (intentionally so), this section seems to add comic relief, illustrating the foibles and frustrations of driving on crowded urban freeways:\n\nCopland‚Äôs musical accompaniment to this scene is a scherzo, placing madcap and tuneful motives above rhythmic vamps. The variety of orchestral textures is really clever and this little episode of the film score sparkles with with wit and finesse. It also contrasts brilliantly with the Americana nobility that follows as we are shown the soaring images of technological advancement which leads to the third act, begun by the narrator describing how science can help us build cities well-suited to our human nature. Copland‚Äôs music for this final act is idyllic but also fast-paced, effectively capturing the onscreen subjects.\n\nCopland was not the only composer to have music featured at the 1939 World‚Äôs Fair. Ralph Vaughn-Williams and Arthur Bliss both received commissions for original concert works in association with the fair. But Copland‚Äôs contribution, while less centrally-featured, is arguably better suited to the flavor of fair than either of the others. Distinctly forward-looking, toward a bright new generation, Copland‚Äôs emerging Americana is congruent with the theme of the fair in ways that the other musics simply could not have been. And, given that this film would have been screened continually, Copland‚Äôs score would have had the added benefit of being played nonstop over the course of the World‚Äôs Fair‚Äôs run of almost two years. This fascinating little film presented itself in so many ways as an ideal vehicle for Copland‚Äôs distinctive musical voice.\n\n‚Äî\n\nWould you like Aaron to provide customized program notes especially for your next performance?

If you hear the term ‚Äúmusical instrument‚Äù, chances are that examples from a certain list will enter your imagination. But those are just the ones that made it big. The fact is, the art of the musical instrument teems with near-infinite possibility and many of them slip through the cracks. Sometimes, however, they manage to ignite the imaginations of composers before, or even after they do. This week we explore some of these instruments.\n\nMusic for Strange and Rare Instruments, Day 1 ‚Äì Journey to the Center of the Earth by Bernard Herrmann\n\nMusic is a mysterious and wonderful thing, isn‚Äôt it? If you don‚Äôt believe me, spend some time contemplating where the definition of music begins and ends. This is the domain of philosophers and aestheticians who of course study and ponder these matters in a disciplined and systematic way, but most of us come up against these questions at least occasionally in some form over the course of our day-to-day thoughts and judgments. I might boil the question down to a spectrum that looks like this:\n\nNOISE ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄìMUSIC ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äì SPEECH\n\nThis is a bit simplistic, but it will move us in the direction of considering music‚Äôs nature. If sound is disorganized and without clear intention, we tend to call it ‚Äúnoise‚Äù. When a critic calls music mere noise, it is because he has not discerned enough organization to cross the threshold between them (whether the failure is on the part of the listener or the musician remains a matter of spirited and sometimes heated philosophical debate). You can read more about a musician who delighted in blurring the definition of this threshold in this post. On the other side of the spectrum we encounter the question of which characteristics distinguish music from speech. Have you ever considered this? Here are a couple items to show you how blurry that distinction can be:\n\nYou may also wish to see this post. So, obviously speech and language are very intimately connected, and a discrete point of difference is probably not really possible to discern. You can further muddy these waters by considering tonal languages, of which Chinese is probably the most famous example. In Chinese, you can change the meanings of words and syllables by speaking them at different pitches. How could you possibly point to a clear separation between speech and music in light of that? Still, philosophers of music try, and everyone acts as such a philosopher at some point. It is probably a valuable exercise simply to stimulate deeper thought about art, its possibilities, applications, and techniques.\n\nWhat is clear is that music (however it is defined), like speech, is a human birthright. I haven‚Äôt done exhaustive research to this end, but I would speculate that in at least 9 out of 10 cultures (if not 10 out of 10) you would discover an original musical tradition of some sort, that is a form of organized sound that is clearly distinct in some way from their manner of speech. In most of these cultures you will also find tools designed to create elements of this music. We call these tools ‚Äúmusical instruments‚Äù. The word instrument is probably used in this context more than all of its others, to the point that the musical ones are those which most people think of first upon hearing that word, even though there exist instruments for a wide variety of technical purposes, from surgery, to flight, to carpentry, to food preparation. An instrument is simply a refined and delicate tool designed for the purpose of executing a task to a high level of precision. Musical instruments are such tools that allow humans‚Äô innate musicality to be expressed through a variety of timbres and approaches. We can blur the distinction between ‚Äúmusical instrument‚Äù and ‚Äúhuman body‚Äù in considering the sonic capabilities of our larynxes, hands, feet, tongues, lips, fingers, and parts.\n\nDue to our acculturation we tend to think of musical instruments as a firmly set palette of colors, shapes, and mechanical operations ‚Äì ask anyone in the West to name some musical instruments and they will almost automatically list some of the instruments associated with our traditions of rock or classical music: violins, pianos, drums, clarinets, trumpets, guitars, etc. But a musical instrument, itself, is an incredibly broad category with essentially infinite potential for variety. Those that have crystallized and remained in common use, such as those in the previous list, have demonstrated an extraordinary combination of ease of operation, ergonomics, effective projection, flexibility of musical expression, pleasing timbre, and technological innovation. Musical instruments are always being created, innovated, improved, refined, and retired. There will always be new musical instruments, and improvements to existing ones, and it is the job of performers and composers to stay abreast of these changes in order to apply them to their work.\n\nThe scholarly study of musical instruments is called organology. It is not the most widely-known discipline outside of the academy, but it is illuminating and often fun to engage with. It reveals to its students the inherent flexibility and infinite variety within the medium. Musical instruments are really just some combination of acoustic stimulus, amplification and (sometimes) pitch control. That‚Äôs an almost absurd reduction, and of course it‚Äôs the nuances and details that make individual instruments interesting enduring, but when you come right down to it, that‚Äôs the essence of a musical instrument. We tend to think of them in those neat, tidy categories given the families of the Western symphony orchestra, but it has not always been so cut-and-dry, and we can probably expect some kind of shift again in the near future.\n\nThere are brass instruments, made of shiny metal, and using a solid, detachable, cup or cone-shaped mouthpiece into which the player buzzes their lips to stimulate the sound. The pitch is controlled by the embouchure which kicks the pitch up through the harmonic series of the tube‚Äôs fundamental frequency, and also through a system of valves which changes the length of the tube and, consequently, its fundamental frequency. And then there are woodwind instruments, played (usually) by a vibrating reed or two, thereby exciting a column of air within a wooden tube, the harmonics of which are filtered via a system of holes and keys.\n\nWe tend to think of those two families of instruments as discrete and separate, but there have been instruments which hybridize the two systems and which seem strange to our sensibilities, shaped, by decades of orchestral standardization. A notable example is called the serpent. Developed in the late 1500s to bolster the volume of monks‚Äô chanting, the curious serpent quite resembles its name, with a curved tube that snakes to and fro.\n\nVisually and aurally, it may strike us as a musical platypus, neither fish nor fowl. One could say that it is half brass, given its brass-like mouthpiece, and half woodwind, given the wood that forms its tube and the system of holes and keys with which the player controls the pitch. Sonically as well it exhibits elements of both families, like a cross between the trombone and bassoon (and maybe a little shofar thrown in, if you know what that is):\n\nThe mid-low range of much of the orchestral music that we know from the eighteenth and nineteenth century was once played on instruments like the serpent, although it is no longer. But some recent composers have enjoyed unearthing and employing sonic resources like the serpent from the recesses of the distant past. A great example is Bernard Hermann‚Äôs colorful and evocative score from ‚ÄúJourney to the Center of the Earth‚Äù of 1959. Hermann mixes the raw, earthy color of the serpent in with the lower palette of this score, yielding some hair-raising orchestral sonorities:\n\nLike speech, music is a human birthright. And mankind has shown a propensity to make music with objects of all kinds. We can‚Äôt help it because it seems to be our very nature. The study of musical instruments reveals a never-ending set of possibilities to this end, limited only by human imagination and ingenuity. While we tend to think of musical instruments in highly segmented categories from our current 21st century vantage point, deeply informed by the dominance of the symphony orchestra and rock band, there are fascinating colors to be found and fascinating music to be made between the largely arbitrary boundaries of these categories. The serpent, now mostly forgotten, is an example of this, ripe with otherworldly colors ideal for invoking the colors of other worlds.\n\n‚Äî\n\nWould you like Aaron of Smart and Soulful Music to provide customized program notes especially for your next performance?

A scherzo is traditionally defined as a ‚Äúmusical joke‚Äù, that is, a light-hearted movement that lacks the weight of a good sonata form essay. And often that‚Äôs how they feel. But, have you ever listened to a ‚Äúscherzo‚Äù that seemed to fit the description of a musical joke, but darkly? Some scherzi paradoxically combine lightness with intensely determined feelings, sometimes even bordering on malice and despair. This week we examine some such examples.\n\nStormy Scherzi, Day 3 ‚Äì Scherzo for X-Wings from The Force Awakens by John Williams\n\nDisclaimer: This post contains spoilers regarding elements of Star Wars: The Force Awakens. If you have not yet seen the film and wish to have a fresh experience when you do, I would advise waiting until you have to read this post.\n\nIf you have been at all curious about my reaction to Star Wars: The Force Awakens, then today is your lucky day! I can‚Äôt imagine why you would, but maybe that comment demonstrates unwarranted self-effacement. I suppose my opinion is as valid as anyone‚Äôs. So here goes. I‚Äôll start with my general experience of the Star Wars franchise‚Ä¶\n\nI was born in the early 1980s, and my dad had a way of showing me trendy movies that I may not have been psychologically mature enough to process. I remember being fed a diet of Star Wars and Top Gun, all prior to the age of 6, definitely too young for Top Gun and probably too early for Star Wars. The earliest memories of my experience with Star Wars are two-fold: one is being terrified of Ponda Baba‚Äôs severed arm in the Cantina scene in A New Hope‚Ä¶\n\n‚Ä¶and the other is entering a movie theater to see a shot of C-3PO and R2D2 framed by the trees of Endor in Return of the Jedi. Between the islands of that memory archipelago are certainly abundant other experiences, but they have since been covered by the ocean of age. Those two isolated images are my earliest memories of Star Wars.\n\nAbout a decade or so later my brother and I began to take an interest in the film franchise, fueled largely by the effusive praise of a teenage babysitter. This was around the time that the films were remastered and re-released on VHS, including extensive interviews between George Lucas and Leonard Maltin which preceded the films, and ended up being fast forwarded through rather often:\n\nAnd that was mostly how we watched them during my teenage years. We enjoyed them, and were definitely fans, although not fanatically so (insert your interpretation of ‚Äúfanatical‚Äù here).\n\nAnd then the prequels came out in the early 2000s. I retain strong memories of two qualities of that whole experience: one was that I was underwhelmed by the films in general, especially for their acting, the cold CGI, and also the materialistic shattering of the mystery of the Force (midi-chlorians and all that), and the other is being struck by how consistent John Williams‚Äô musical score felt with the original trilogy (Dual of the Fates aside; I wasn‚Äôt crazy about that number). I remember having discussions with fellow musicians, and probably reading articles, that expressed sentiments to the effect of ‚ÄúGeorge Lucas seems to have lost something, but John Williams still has it!‚Äù That seemed about right to me. I may revisit the prequel trilogy in the coming months if I get a chance, just to see if there is any room for re-evaluation, but I wager that most people can agree that Williams provided a crucial glue to mesh the two trilogies in spite of the inconsistencies many members of the audience noted in other aspects of the film making.\n\nJohn Williams‚Äô work in all of the scores of the Star Wars canon is often compared to the orchestral music of Wagner‚Äôs Ring tetralogy, a thick, overarching, blanket of connective tissue rich with symbolic musical motives associated with characters and philosophical themes which serve to captivate listeners/viewers and reinforce the semiotic interrelatedness of the story and its actors. For more on Wagner‚Äôs artistry see this post and this one. The comparison is apt ‚Äì Williams has clearly been a keen student of Wagner‚Äôs leitmotiv technique and instinctively knew to apply it to the Star Wars films, even before he was certain that sequels were in the cards. The difference, I suppose, is that Wagner‚Äôs creative vision remained consistent in all aspects of the Ring over the course of the few decades he took to complete it, be it libretto, characterization, dramatic pacing, music, etc. But in the Star Wars films the consistency of Williams‚Äô music exceeds that of many of the other elements, particularly as you look from trilogy to trilogy, and now beyond. Whoever ultimately owns the Star Wars brand ought to be very thankful for Williams‚Äô ongoing involvement and the continuity it has helped to facilitate between films.\n\nI would assert that Williams‚Äô contribution is indeed the strongest element of The Force Awakens, just as it is in the prequel trilogy. I viewed this trailer many times in anticipation of the return to the good ol‚Äô days of the original trilogy that it promised:\n\nEven in this brief trailer it is the music that evokes the most powerful response of any of its elements. After an extended layering of the initial harmonic progression (E: I ‚Äì iv ‚Äì N6 ‚Äì I, or E ‚Äì Am ‚Äì F6 ‚Äì E for all you theory geeks in da house) during which the arguments of the drama are presented, a significant theme first heard in Episode V, The Empire Strikes Back, known as the love theme between Han Solo and Princess Leia, peals forth measuredly and deliberately from violins in their lowest register, just as we see the dogfight between tie fighters and the Millennium Falcon and hear Han Solo, grizzled with age and life‚Äôs adventures, affirm the veracity of the legends of the Jedi and the Dark Side. This was the very moment that sold me on the film and I still remember my internal emotional response as I viewed this trailer for the first time in December of 2015. In fact, I still respond to it in much the same way now. After that, we hear two other leitmotivs: the stoic Force theme, first heard in Episode IV, A New Hope, which plays as we catch our first glimpse of a battle-ready Kylo Ren, wielding his distinctive cross-shaped lightsaber, and finally a hushed statement of the Star Wars main theme just as the trailer ends and the title of the film drifts away before us.\n\nWould the trailer be as effective without Williams‚Äô well-placed musical cues? I‚Äôm sure I don‚Äôt need to answer that question. The compelling themes and motives of the Star Wars universe are probably the best tool at its marketers‚Äô disposal. Even as new characters are added, to varying degrees of success, Williams comes out on top with brilliant themes that manage to sum them up, and this is true of both the prequel trilogy and The Force Awakens.\n\nI was similarly underwhelmed by The Force Awakens as the prequel trilogy, but for different reasons. I felt, as did many critics, that it more or less told the story of A New Hope and pandered to fans of the original trilogy with heavy-handed references, and quickly became frustrated and disinterested. But at least the music provided much-needed continuity with the other films. And Williams even managed to have a little fun with the material. What a clever touch to include a playful and turbulent ‚ÄúScherzo for X-Wings‚Äù for some of the final dog fighting, rife with contrapuntal maneuvering of the Star Wars Fanfare:\n\nThe title is almost like a packaging, earmarking it as an obvious choice as a self-contained concert number for accomplished bands:\n\nhttp://www.halleonard.com/product/viewproduct.action?itemid=4004661&lid=4&promotion=1014&subsiteid=6&\n\nDoes the Scherzo for X-Wings take its place among classic Star Wars set pieces like ‚ÄúHere They Come!‚Äù or ‚ÄúThe Asteroid Field‚Äù? Hard to say, and only time will tell. But it is a fine example of the crucial cohesion provided by John Williams‚Äô solid contributions over the course of a decades-long effort to produce a coherent universe of storytelling which has come to be filled with other elements that have fallen short of the original in that regard. Williams truly speaks to the souls of Star Wars fans; he seems to understand and acknowledge the gravity of the covenant he made with his current and future audience back in 1977 and continues to honor it to this day with his considerable abilities of orchestration and musical characterization.\n\n‚Äî\n\nWould you like Aaron of Smart and Soulful Music to provide customized program notes especially for your next performance?

When we hear the word ‚Äútransportation‚Äù in the twenty-first century, we imagine many modes of moving people and things from place to place, over sea, land and air. This is largely a modern set of images, although people and things have moved from place to place throughout all of history. Because of this, the theme of transportation is present in music to varying degrees through its history.\n\nMusic about Transportation, Day 4 ‚Äì ‚ÄúSunday Traffic‚Äù from The City by Aaron Copland\n\nHave you ever been to a World‚Äôs Fair? They‚Äôre sometimes called ‚ÄúWorld Expositions‚Äù or ‚ÄúExpos‚Äù and I didn‚Äôt even know they are still around. But they are. The last one was in May of this year (2015), in Milan, and they actually happen pretty regularly:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_world%27s_fairs\n\nAnd I had no idea they were still going on! So if you find yourself in Alanya, Turkey in 2016 or Astana, Kazakhstan in 2017, you should definitely drop by and check out the World Expo. Sort of like a mix between a state fair, the Olympics (which moves from world city to world city) and Disney‚Äôs Tomorrowland with its better-living-through-chemistry kind of theme, there‚Äôs nothing else quite like them. If you are fortunate enough to catch one, I imagine you can expect to be overwhelmed, fascinated and inspired by a colorful mix of exhibitions and forward-thinking ideas.\n\nOne of the most famous World‚Äôs Fairs was that of 1939 in New York City. It was also one of the largest and longest lasting in history. Over the course of its 18-month run, it attracted just short of 45 million visitors from around the world to its array of exhibits and monuments which covered more than 1,000 acres in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, located in New York City‚Äôs borough of Queens.\n\nWhile the intention of the masterminds behind the 1939 World‚Äôs Fair was to revitalize America‚Äôs sagging spirit and economy, both hampered by the Great Depression, the event and its distinctive architecture have transcended their original intention to become iconic of the American sensibilities that gave rise to the Baby Boomer generation, technologically forward-looking yet culturally retrospective. The famous Trylon and Perisphere structures, evoking a naive sci-fi feeling, set the visual tone for the fair‚Äôs theme, The World of Tomorrow.\n\nThe fair was full of evocative architecture, events and exhibits in accordance with that theme, including: ‚ÄúFuturama‚Äù (no, not that one!), the Westinghouse Time Capsule (not to be opened for 5,000 years), an enormous ceramic sculpture of an atom, and the world‚Äôs first science fiction convention. One of the lesser-known exhibits was a short film created by the American Institute of Planners, a professional organization for urban planners, called The City. Created in 1939, this 30 minute black-and-white film is, by many an evaluation, closer to a propaganda piece than a true documentary. But it is a fascinating piece of vintage filmmaking. Cast in 3 acts, it celebrates the farm life of yesteryear, decries the dehumanizing effect of the sprawling, unplanned industrial-age cities that have grown out of control, and finally suggests a wholesome alternative in planned communities that are able to harmonize modern conveniences with the tranquility of the past, very much keeping in line with the 1939 World‚Äôs Fair‚Äôs theme of The World of Tomorrow. Actually, these planned communities celebrated by the AIP‚Äôs film were not entirely in the future. Examples of these ‚ÄúGreenbelt‚Äù communities (so named for the ring of public-held forested land encircling the towns that would keep the landscape green and ensure a perpetual size and shape to the urban landscape) had been established during the 1930s with one each in Wisconsin, Ohio and Maryland.\n\nCarefully planned to balance residential and commercial zones, and always encircled by a belt of green to insulate from the surrounding urban jungle, these small towns were created by New Deal bureaucracies that set income levels for for their residents and and designed them to run as cooperative communities. The concept is highly idealistic, but it seemed to work for these towns. After about a decade the lands, initially owned by the federal government, were gradually sold to the towns‚Äô inhabitants. These communities really could not have been built during any other decade or in any other political climate. In learning about them one senses they are permeated through and through by New Deal philosophy.\n\nThis functional idealism comes through very clearly in The City, with its stiff but florid narration, and especially the filmmakers‚Äô choice of composer, a highly significant American musician who, at this time, was busy establishing a populist manner of composition for American listeners, Aaron Copland. Coming to maturity in the 1920s, Copland at first gravitated to the spiky avant-garde stylings popular in Europe around that time, but eventually tired of it and, after settling more permanently in his native land, began to create a more accessible and distinctly iconic American style of music starting in the 1930s. All of his best-known Americana works are written in this style and were created during the late 1930s and early 1940s. These include Appalachian Spring, Billy the Kid, Rodeo, and the stirring Lincoln Portrait. All of these beloved scores successfully fuse the lyricism of American folk song (either authentic or keenly imitated) with an infectious rhythmic drive, broadcast through remarkably clear and astringent orchestration, even during the busiest passages. There are also noble sections of calm, flat terrain that seem to simultaneously evoke both the sweeping amber waves of grain, and the clean, imposing monuments of Washington D.C. And the small group of film scores that Copland composed during the 1930s and 1940s, Hollywood and otherwise, presented one ideal venue to present this new American aesthetic.\n\nThe City is a fine showcase of all of Copland‚Äôs colors and moods. You can watch the full 30 minute film here and get a sense of everything he could do:\n\nOne of the most infectious sections of the score is called ‚ÄúSunday Traffic‚Äù and it comes right at the end of the second act. While the beginning of the act is demoralizing, drab and depressing (intentionally so), this section seems to add comic relief, illustrating the foibles and frustrations of driving on crowded urban freeways:\n\nCopland‚Äôs musical accompaniment to this scene is a scherzo, placing madcap and tuneful motives above rhythmic vamps. The variety of orchestral textures is really clever and this little episode of the film score sparkles with with wit and finesse. It also contrasts brilliantly with the Americana nobility that follows as we are shown the soaring images of technological advancement which leads to the third act, begun by the narrator describing how science can help us build cities well-suited to our human nature. Copland‚Äôs music for this final act is idyllic but also fast-paced, effectively capturing the onscreen subjects.\n\nCopland was not the only composer to have music featured at the 1939 World‚Äôs Fair. Ralph Vaughn-Williams and Arthur Bliss both received commissions for original concert works in association with the fair. But Copland‚Äôs contribution, while less centrally-featured, is arguably better suited to the flavor of fair than either of the others. Distinctly forward-looking, toward a bright new generation, Copland‚Äôs emerging Americana is congruent with the theme of the fair in ways that the other musics simply could not have been. And, given that this film would have been screened continually, Copland‚Äôs score would have had the added benefit of being played nonstop over the course of the World‚Äôs Fair‚Äôs run of almost two years. This fascinating little film presented itself in so many ways as an ideal vehicle for Copland‚Äôs distinctive musical voice.\n\n‚Äî\n\nWould you like this featured track in your own personal collection to listen to anytime you want?

Everyone knows Dorothy‚Äôs now-classic daydream about a land she imagines, anywhere but here. And you probably also know that she gets her wish within about a half hour of singing that, becoming magically teleported by a fierce storm to a vibrant land of Technicolor, and other wonders, called Oz.\n\nBut, do you know this tune?\n\nThis little piano piece, written by the German composer Robert Schumann in the late 1840s, is part of a collection of short, easy pieces that he wrote to help his daughters learn to play the piano. It‚Äôs called Album for the Young, and he published it as his Opus 68. This particular piece is roughly translated as ‚ÄúThe merry peasant returns from work‚Äù, although you see various translations in different places. Can you imagine the exhausted but happy serf of the title tripping briskly down the road, back to his home, whistling a happy tune?\n\nMany violinists, pianists and cellists know this song as ‚ÄúThe Happy Farmer‚Äù as that‚Äôs how it is titled whenever it appears in the repertoire of the Suzuki Method. I learned to play it in middle school while my violin teacher guided me through some of the Suzuki books. I was not Suzuki trained myself, but many violin teachers pull music for their students from the Suzuki books even if they don‚Äôt use the precise method.\n\nWhen I started learning The Happy Farmer I could have sworn I had heard it before. And then I remembered. Watch this scene from The Wizard of Oz:\n\nThere, at the end. Did you hear it? It starts right at 2:30, just as Toto hops out of the basket. Unfortunately this clip doesn‚Äôt go on for much longer, but it‚Äôs enough to hear Schumann‚Äôs tune, written into the score by composer Herbert Stothart, and souped up in grand orchestration to fit the tone of the glittery, fast-moving film. I don‚Äôt know why he thought to use Schumann‚Äôs song, but it fits pretty well, doesn‚Äôt it? A good leitmotif for Toto. I haven‚Äôt watched the whole movie lately, but I bet you will hear it in a couple other places when you see Toto running in the opening black and white scenes.\n\nHerbert Stothart is a great example of an unsung film music hero of Hollywood‚Äôs golden age. There are other composers whose names are a little more famous, but here is Stothart‚Äôs masterful underscore helping The Wizard of Oz to move along convincingly from beginning to end and I bet you‚Äôve never heard his name, even if you love the movie. Watch that scene where Dorothy pleads for Toto‚Äôs life again and listen to how subtle and effective the music is, establishing characters, enhancing the constantly shifting mood, amplifying psychological intentions, and foreshadowing upcoming events in the film. Listen closely to the music, a constant element in this scene, and you will be rewarded with greater insights into the dramatic structure of The Wizard of Oz.\n\nRobert Schumann‚Äôs voice, from almost 100 years earlier, sings clearly and integrates seamlessly with the rest Stothart‚Äôs score, alongside the melodies from all those wonderful songs by Harold Arlen and Yip Harburg. And the Academy recognized the merit of their efforts. All three of those creative minds won Academy Awards for their efforts in 1939. Unfortunately, Robert Schumann was unable to accept his award in person‚Ä¶\n\n___\n\nWould you like Aaron of Smart and Soulful Music to provide customized program notes especially for your next performance?

Every piece of music this week deals with food or dining in an interesting way. Fill your belly, listen to great music, and discover something new in the process‚Ä¶\n\nDay 4 ‚Äì ‚ÄúGia la e Mensa a Preparata‚Äù from Don Giovanni by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\n\nIs eating a comical act, or deadly serious?\n\nHow about some pheasant for our main course? Let me explain‚Ä¶\n\nHave you ever seen the movie Amadeus? It‚Äôs the 1984 film based on Peter Shaffer‚Äôs play of the same name which chronicles the rumored rivalry between the composers Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Antonio Salieri set against the backdrop of Viennese court life in the 1780s. You should definitely watch it if you haven‚Äôt already.\n\nAnd if you ever come across a production of the play, go see it. It‚Äôs a rare treat, and different enough from the movie to provide a distinct experience. You can also find a copy of the script and read it, which is interesting too.\n\nBut the easiest way to consume that story is to see the marvelous film. It has everything! A riveting and engrossing story, great actors who bring the characters to life in multiple dimensions, beautiful costumes and set designs that evoke the atmosphere of eighteenth century Vienna and, of course, a wall-to-wall score packed with examples of Mozart‚Äôs wonderful music, which is sometimes played on screen and at other times used like film music to accompany the action without an obvious onscreen presence. All of the music on the film‚Äôs soundtrack is by Mozart or his contemporaries; there was no composer hired to provide additional music, which I think was a great choice. You get to hear examples from all sorts of different genres of Mozart‚Äôs production including symphonies, sonatas, church music, divertimenti, concertos, solo piano works and more. There‚Äôs also a number of scenes that illustrate his legendary and almost mystical creative process as he improvises, develops ideas at the keyboard, and composes on paper. But I think the real stars of the soundtrack of Amadeus are the scenes from Mozart‚Äôs operas. They seem to form the major set pieces of the film, as if the movie is build around them, and they can stand on their own as decent stagings of great operatic scenes.\n\nAmadeus focuses on the last decade of Mozart‚Äôs life, from about 1780 ‚Äì 1791, which he spent in Vienna, and marked by his true maturity as a composer (such as it is ‚Äì had he lived longer he probably would have developed even more, which is difficult for many of us mere mortals to imagine). Mozart wrote enough masterpieces during that one final decade of his life to make the careers of at least 3 other composers, and maybe more. The operas that dot the last decade of his life, starting with 1782‚Äôs Abduction from the Seraglio (or, depending on who you ask, 1781‚Äôs Idomeneo) and ending with 1791‚Äôs Magic Flute, remain, to this day, some of the finest in existence and are still performed widely today on operatic stages all over the world. This brilliant handful of operas is characterized by elegant music, a keen sense of drama and pacing, penetrating psychological development of the characters, and a masterful intermix of tragic and comic elements. This last part is unusual during a period of opera production in which the two modes of dramatic expression tended to be segmented. In many of Mozart‚Äôs greatest operas we experience both tragedy and comedy combined most convincingly, and in more or less equal measure. Don Giovanni of 1787 is a great example of this. Watch this scene from Amadeus:\n\nElectrifying, isn‚Äôt it? Top notch opera production and film making. This is the penultimate scene of Don Giovanni, and you can hear Mozart‚Äôs rival Antonio Salieri narrating throughout about how he read the ghost of Mozart‚Äôs father into the opera as he watched it. But if you could see the context around that scene within the greater opera you might be more inclined to understand Salieri‚Äôs narration as the storytelling device that it is, not really true and simply in service to making the film feel more dramatic. Because, you see, Don Giovanni is actually a comedy. Does that surprise you? If this is the only scene you ever see then I‚Äôll bet it does, because it doesn‚Äôt feel very comedic. But there‚Äôs another 3 hours of the opera that you‚Äôre missing. Oh, and we were about to have dinner, weren‚Äôt we? Here‚Äôs the scene from Don Giovani that precedes the one you just watched in Amadeus:\n\nThat‚Äôs a much different feeling isn‚Äôt it? Don Giovanni is Mozart‚Äôs telling of the Don Juan story. The libretto of the opera constantly pulls back and forth between the depravity of its title character wreaking havoc in people‚Äôs lives (murder, seduction, home-wrecking) and the reaction of his conflicted and long-suffering servant, Leporello, who can be seen in the previous seen scurrying around to serve Don Giovanni his luxurious dinner. Leporello provides the bulk of the comedy in Mozart‚Äôs Don Giovanni. He is the basso buffo, or ‚Äúcomic bass‚Äù and it is his reactions and generally simple manner throughout the tragic wake of Don Giovanni‚Äôs adventures that serve to lighten the mood. Even Leporello is complex, because in spite of his simplicity, his moral compass is much more finely tuned than Don Giovanni‚Äôs and his reactions constantly reveal that. And, sometimes he‚Äôs just funny. Did you catch the comedy in this last scene? It‚Äôs all centered around Leporello envying Don Giovanni‚Äôs dinner and sneaking a choice cut of pheasant off his master‚Äôs plate, which happens right around the 3:00 mark. Don Giovanni notices that it is gone, but instead of calling him out he makes poor Leporello sweat by asking him to talk and whistle for him even though he knows that his mouth is full. This scene is right before the climactic finale you watched in Amadeus where the Commendatore, murdered by Don Giovanni in the opening scene, crashes the banquet and drags Don Giovanni to hell to pay for his deeds. It‚Äôs an amazing contrast, but Mozart handles the switch with a deft hand and it never feels incongruent.\n\nOne more thing about this scene‚Ä¶ Did you notice Don Giovanni‚Äôs tafelmusik? Yes, he has tafelmusik! (See Day 1 of this week for more about that). The finale of Don Giovanni always features an onstage wind band that plays music during the banquet. When music in movies has an on-screen source it is called ‚Äúsource music‚Äù, and this is Mozart anticipating the technique of cinematic source music by more than a century. And musical selections of the onstage band are notable. The band in Don Giovanni plays instrumental arrangements of arias from other operas that were popular around the time Don Giovanni was written. The band starts playing at about 1:00 in the previous clip and Leporella exclaims ‚ÄúBravi, Cosa Rara!‚Äù Cosa Rara is an opera by a contemporary of Mozart‚Äôs named Vincente Soler and this would have been a little inside joke to Mozart‚Äôs audiences. Now, watch starting at 3:46. This is another piece, actually an aria from Mozart‚Äôs own opera The Marriage of Figaro. Don Giovanni remarks disdainfully ‚ÄúUgh, this song I know only too well!‚Äù and Mozart‚Äôs depricating self quotation frames the comic scene involving Leporello‚Äôs stolen piece of pheasant. This scene indicates to me that Mozart must not have taken himself too seriously and indeed, if his copious correspondence is any indication, he did not.\n\nI hope you enjoyed that delicious main course. Oh, and one final tidbit FOR MATURE AUDIENCES ONLY. One problem for American audiences who enjoy opera is that many of the best ones are in foreign languages like Italian, French and German. A modern solution is to provide subtitles, which films often do. And in recent years modern technology has allowed opera theaters to very helpfully broadcast translations during live productions on stage. In searching for a production of Don Giovanni‚Äôs final scene with subtitles I discovered this‚Ä¶(ahem) unconventional‚Ä¶staging that is appropriate for mature audiences only.

Do you like Western films?\n\nMost people do, at least sometimes. There‚Äôs nothing like watching rugged, no-nonsense heroes navigate the barren, danger-ridden landscapes of the old West, escaping dilemma after dilemma with understated ingenuity and, if necessary, brute force. The very best films of the Western genre even offer great psychological character development over the course of their plots. What country are your favorite Westerns from? Is it Italy? It doesn‚Äôt exactly make sense, but lots of film fans consider some of the best films about the old West to be from among a handful made by Italian filmmakers in the 1960s and 70s. I‚Äôm not sure why the director Sergio Leone tried his hand at creating Western films, but his combination of successful low-budget effects, Italian actors who required overdubbing (American star Clint Eastwood excepted), immersive cinematography and a knack for building the suspense of particularly dramatic scenes by cutting from close-up to close-up of different characters present turned out to be a recipe for worldwide success. You can see from this list of Italian Westerns that Leone‚Äôs were not the first examples of their genre; but they came fairly early in its history and are spaced more or less evenly throughout its history. Just do a search for ‚ÄúLeone‚Äù on that page and you should be able to see the distribution throughout the page. You can also see from that list that Italian filmmakers produced lots of Western films through the 60s and 70s (I didn‚Äôt take the time to count; it must be at least 100), but Leone‚Äôs are the ones that history has deemed memorable, for whatever reason. When people think of Italian Western films, they usually think Sergio Leone.\n\nEventually non-Italians began to refer to his genre of Western film by slightly snarky, maybe even borderline-derogatory, but always pasta-related names. In Japan it was the ‚ÄúMacaroni Western‚Äù (would that make a Japanese Western an ‚ÄúUdon Western‚Äù? How about a ‚ÄúRamen Western‚Äù?) and in America it became the ‚ÄúSpaghetti Western‚Äù. So this is our pasta course for the week.\n\nOne other element that helped to shape the distinctive atmosphere of Leone‚Äôs Italian Western films is their musical scores, which were instrumental, so to speak, in establishing the career of their composer, Leone‚Äôs fellow Italian Ennio Morricone. An Ennio Morricone Western score is not of the flavor that probably first comes to your mind when you think ‚ÄúMusic for a Western film‚Äù. You probably imagine big, bold, tuneful Americana themes played by a large symphony orchestra with some episodes of powerful brass and others of soaring string melody. All of these scores tend to have vigorous, driving rhythms and orchestration that evokes the sweeping panorama of Aaron Copland‚Äôs most American-sounding symphonic works. The examples I could offer of stand-out Western scores in this style are numerous, but if you enjoy that sound I would recommend that you purchase this album to get yourself a healthy dose. It is a thoroughly fun and enjoyable listening experience from Erich Kunzel and the Cincinnati Pops.\n\nIncidentally, when film composers are trying to evoke the feeling of a Western in a film or franchise that is not inherently Western, that is the style to which they turn. Here are two of my favorite examples of this:\n\nMorricone‚Äôs scores for Leone‚Äôs Western films do not feel like that. The tight budgets characteristic of Spaghetti Westerns impacted all departments of their production, and the music was no exception. So Morricone was not able to paint on the great symphonic canvas that American composers did for their iconic Western scores, which forced him to be resourceful and inventive. But the result actually fits the other elements of Leone‚Äôs film making like the proverbial glove‚Ä¶er, spur?\n\nBy the time he started composing scores for Leone‚Äôs Spaghetti Westerns, Ennio Morricone had logged serious hours composing classical music for the concert hall, playing jazz, and also arranging songs performed by the likes of such superstars as Paul Anka. Leone‚Äôs Spaghetti Westerns were just the opportunity that Morricone needed to launch to worldwide success, and he was able to solidify his career as a film composer, which continues to this day. To date he has composed the scores for more than 500 motion pictures.\n\nSince he could not write for a full symphony orchestra, Morricone engineered a style of orchestration for the Spaghetti Westerns that closely reflects the film‚Äôs visual style. The picture is always spare, with no frills or extra decorations, and the characters fill the screen with close ups. The characters are visually striking and memorable, but in odd and unsettling ways. The action is direct and graceless in its machismo. Morricone‚Äôs musical solution to match style this within his limited means was to pare down the orchestra to a varied chamber ensemble of unusual colors and instrumental combinations. The melodies are stark and bare and the sonorities haunting in their pallor. The music is supplemented with odd sound effects like rhythmic whip cracks and whistles.\n\nThe contributions from all of the ingenious and creative artists at work on Spaghetti Westerns yielded a new and unique art form, still distinctive in its effect and still captivating half a century later. By far the most memorable and famous of Morricone‚Äôs cues for Leone‚Äôs Spaghetti Westerns, with the possible exception of the theme from The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is called The Ecstasy of Gold, also from The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. The tryptic of the film‚Äôs title refers to the three main characters, engaged with each other throughout the film in a race of wits and strength to unearth a rumored cache of Confederate gold buried in a Civil War cemetery. Toward the end of the film Clint Eastwood‚Äôs Blondie (The Good) and Eli Wallach‚Äôs Tuco (The Ugly) reach the cemetery and square off for the gold before Lee Van Cleef‚Äôs Angel Eyes (The Bad) joins the party for the final confrontation.\n\nThe Ecstasy of Gold accompanies the scene in which Tuco discovers the cemetery and in a greedy euphoria searches frantically from one side to the other for the grave which is said to hold the treasure. Morricone‚Äôs score matches Tuco‚Äôs state perfectly with dizzying trumpet and haunting vocal lines that accelerate and raise the temperature steadily over the course of the search. At the climax the chimes enter and make the whole experience rapturous right up to the point that Tuco finally spots the long sought-after grave.\n\nEnnio Morricone has an amazing imagination. If you don‚Äôt quite know what I mean by that, watch that scene again but turn off the sound and see what it feels like. Much different, isn‚Äôt it? Would you have heard the music Morricone did just from viewing those images?\n\n‚Äî\n\nWould you like that track in your own personal collection to listen to anytime you want?
