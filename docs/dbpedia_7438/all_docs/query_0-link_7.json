        "text": "The theme of this week’s Smart and Soulful Blog is…Music for Foodies! Every piece of music this week deals with food or dining in an interesting way. Fill your belly, listen to great music, and discover something new in the process…\n\nDay 4 – “Gia la e Mensa a Preparata” from Don Giovanni by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\n\nIs eating a comical act, or deadly serious?\n\nHow about some pheasant for our main course? Let me explain…\n\nHave you ever seen the movie Amadeus? It’s the 1984 film based on Peter Shaffer’s play of the same name which chronicles the rumored rivalry between the composers Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Antonio Salieri set against the backdrop of Viennese court life in the 1780s. You should definitely watch it if you haven’t already.\n\nAnd if you ever come across a production of the play, go see it. It’s a rare treat, and different enough from the movie to provide a distinct experience. You can also find a copy of the script and read it, which is interesting too.\n\nBut the easiest way to consume that story is to see the marvelous film. It has everything! A riveting and engrossing story, great actors who bring the characters to life in multiple dimensions, beautiful costumes and set designs that evoke the atmosphere of eighteenth century Vienna and, of course, a wall-to-wall score packed with examples of Mozart’s wonderful music, which is sometimes played on screen and at other times used like film music to accompany the action without an obvious onscreen presence. All of the music on the film’s soundtrack is by Mozart or his contemporaries; there was no composer hired to provide additional music, which I think was a great choice. You get to hear examples from all sorts of different genres of Mozart’s production including symphonies, sonatas, church music, divertimenti, concertos, solo piano works and more. There’s also a number of scenes that illustrate his legendary and almost mystical creative process as he improvises, develops ideas at the keyboard, and composes on paper. But I think the real stars of the soundtrack of Amadeus are the scenes from Mozart’s operas. They seem to form the major set pieces of the film, as if the movie is build around them, and they can stand on their own as decent stagings of great operatic scenes.\n\nAmadeus focuses on the last decade of Mozart’s life, from about 1780 – 1791, which he spent in Vienna, and marked by his true maturity as a composer (such as it is – had he lived longer he probably would have developed even more, which is difficult for many of us mere mortals to imagine). Mozart wrote enough masterpieces during that one final decade of his life to make the careers of at least 3 other composers, and maybe more. The operas that dot the last decade of his life, starting with 1782’s Abduction from the Seraglio (or, depending on who you ask, 1781’s Idomeneo) and ending with 1791’s Magic Flute, remain, to this day, some of the finest in existence and are still performed widely today on operatic stages all over the world. This brilliant handful of operas is characterized by elegant music, a keen sense of drama and pacing, penetrating psychological development of the characters, and a masterful intermix of tragic and comic elements. This last part is unusual during a period of opera production in which the two modes of dramatic expression tended to be segmented. In many of Mozart’s greatest operas we experience both tragedy and comedy combined most convincingly, and in more or less equal measure. Don Giovanni of 1787 is a great example of this. Watch this scene from Amadeus:\n\nElectrifying, isn’t it? Top notch opera production and film making. This is the penultimate scene of Don Giovanni, and you can hear Mozart’s rival Antonio Salieri narrating throughout about how he read the ghost of Mozart’s father into the opera as he watched it. But if you could see the context around that scene within the greater opera you might be more inclined to understand Salieri’s narration as the storytelling device that it is, not really true and simply in service to making the film feel more dramatic. Because, you see, Don Giovanni is actually a comedy. Does that surprise you? If this is the only scene you ever see then I’ll bet it does, because it doesn’t feel very comedic. But there’s another 3 hours of the opera that you’re missing. Oh, and we were about to have dinner, weren’t we? Here’s the scene from Don Giovani that precedes the one you just watched in Amadeus:\n\nThat’s a much different feeling isn’t it? Don Giovanni is Mozart’s telling of the Don Juan story. The libretto of the opera constantly pulls back and forth between the depravity of its title character wreaking havoc in people’s lives (murder, seduction, home-wrecking) and the reaction of his conflicted and long-suffering servant, Leporello, who can be seen in the previous seen scurrying around to serve Don Giovanni his luxurious dinner. Leporello provides the bulk of the comedy in Mozart’s Don Giovanni. He is the basso buffo, or “comic bass” and it is his reactions and generally simple manner throughout the tragic wake of Don Giovanni’s adventures that serve to lighten the mood. Even Leporello is complex, because in spite of his simplicity, his moral compass is much more finely tuned than Don Giovanni’s and his reactions constantly reveal that. And, sometimes he’s just funny. Did you catch the comedy in this last scene? It’s all centered around Leporello envying Don Giovanni’s dinner and sneaking a choice cut of pheasant off his master’s plate, which happens right around the 3:00 mark. Don Giovanni notices that it is gone, but instead of calling him out he makes poor Leporello sweat by asking him to talk and whistle for him even though he knows that his mouth is full. This scene is right before the climactic finale you watched in Amadeus where the Commendatore, murdered by Don Giovanni in the opening scene, crashes the banquet and drags Don Giovanni to hell to pay for his deeds. It’s an amazing contrast, but Mozart handles the switch with a deft hand and it never feels incongruent.\n\nOne more thing about this scene… Did you notice Don Giovanni’s tafelmusik? Yes, he has tafelmusik! (See Day 1 of this week for more about that). The finale of Don Giovanni always features an onstage wind band that plays music during the banquet. When music in movies has an on-screen source it is called “source music”, and this is Mozart anticipating the technique of cinematic source music by more than a century. And musical selections of the onstage band are notable. The band in Don Giovanni plays instrumental arrangements of arias from other operas that were popular around the time Don Giovanni was written. The band starts playing at about 1:00 in the previous clip and Leporella exclaims “Bravi, Cosa Rara!” Cosa Rara is an opera by a contemporary of Mozart’s named Vincente Soler and this would have been a little inside joke to Mozart’s audiences. Now, watch starting at 3:46. This is another piece, actually an aria from Mozart’s own opera The Marriage of Figaro. Don Giovanni remarks disdainfully “Ugh, this song I know only too well!” and Mozart’s depricating self quotation frames the comic scene involving Leporello’s stolen piece of pheasant. This scene indicates to me that Mozart must not have taken himself too seriously and indeed, if his copious correspondence is any indication, he did not.\n\nI hope you enjoyed that delicious main course. Oh, and one final tidbit FOR MATURE AUDIENCES ONLY. One problem for American audiences who enjoy opera is that many of the best ones are in foreign languages like Italian, French and German. A modern solution is to provide subtitles, which films often do. And in recent years modern technology has allowed opera theaters to very helpfully broadcast translations during live productions on stage. In searching for a production of Don Giovanni’s final scene with subtitles I discovered this…(ahem) unconventional…staging that is appropriate for mature audiences only. Consider yourself warned…\n\n—\n\nWould you like that track in your own personal collection to listen to anytime you want?
