Morgan-Ellis developed the concept, managed the project, wrote the text (unless otherwise attributed), produced the listening guides (unless otherwise attributed), edited contributions from collaborators, selected/captioned the images, and created the accompanying PowerPoint slides.\n\nRebecca R. Johnston wrote the Chapter 1 sections entitled “The Power of Music”\n\nand “Music and Human Development, Learning, and Wellness” and produced the test bank questions in collaboration with Marie Graham.\n\nLouis Hajosy wrote the Chapter 8 section entitled “The Beatles, Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band” and the passage concerning Hendrix’s performance of\n\n“The Star-Spangled Banner” that appears in the Chapter 7 section entitled “1969: An Aquarian Exposition.” He also contributed to the Chapter 9 discussion of “The Star-Spangled Banner,” produced the “Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds” listening guide, and created Appendix B, in addition to providing valuable feedback on the text.\n\nDavid R. Peoples contributed to the Chapter 13 sections entitled “1965: The Duke Ellington controversy” and “1997: Wynton Marsalis, Blood on the Fields.”\n\nHe also typeset all of the listening guides and examples and produced all of the graphics, in addition to providing valuable feedback on the text.\n\nArielle P. Crumley wrote the Chapter 5 sections entitled “Beyoncé, Lemonade”\n\nand “Ancient Greece: The Iliad” and provided feedback on the remainder of the text.\n\nAlexandra Dunbar wrote the Chapter 4 section entitled “Lin-Manuel Miranda, Hamilton” and produced the accompanying listening guides. She also provided feedback on the remainder of the text.\n\nPage | vii\n\nRESONANCES\n\nCONTRIBUTIONS AND ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nPhilip Snyder created the notation-based videos in Chapter 2, contributed some images, and provided valuable feedback on the entire text.\n\nLisa Prodan created the teaching videos in Chapter 2.\n\nBart Walters contributed to Appendix A, provided valuable feedback on the text, and corrected the initial proof. He also created the YouTube channel that accompanies this book, uploaded videos as necessary, and built playlists in collaboration with Serena Scibelli.\n\nIn addition, Jura Pintar formatted listening examples for the typesetting process and Noël Hahn selected some of the images used in Chapter 1. These contributors were not compensated and we appreciate their support.\n\nThis text was piloted with the 2019 Honors Music Appreciation class at the University of North Georgia, the members of which provided edits and feedback.\n\nParticipants included Bailey Bullard, Abigail Cartwright, Zoe Conoly, Camille Cowherd, Morgan Dow, Olivia Forrest, Sarah Graddy, Isabelle Pobanz, Julia Pownall, and Jessica Wood.\n\nThe development and publication of this textbook was funded by a Large-Scale Textbook Transformation Grant from Affordable Learning Georgia (Jeff Gallant, Program Director). Our work was also supported by a Presidential Innovation Incentive Award and a Presidential Semester Incentive Award from the University of North Georgia (Bonita Jacobs, President) and by the UNG Music Department (Benjamin Schoening, Department Head). We are very grateful to these institutions and individuals for making this project possible.\n\nPage | viii\n\nHow to Use This Book\n\nOUR VISION\n\nWelcome to Resonances: Engaging Music in Its Cultural Context! Although this book is intended primarily for use in the college music appreciation classroom, it was designed with consideration for independent learners, advanced high school students, and experienced musicians. That is to say, it includes enough detail that expert guidance is not required and is written using broadly-accessible language.\n\nAt the same time, it addresses advanced topics and positions music as a serious object of study.\n\nUnlike most music appreciation textbooks, this volume is organized thematically according to the many ways that music is and has been used in human societies. It brings together examples from classical, folk, and popular traditions from around the world. The text offers a thorough grounding in the cultural and historical context of each work and a close examination of its characteristics. While the book can certainly be read from beginning to end, one can also move freely between chapters and examples without missing crucial information.\n\nThis textbook is in no sense comprehensive. There are lots of important and influential works that are not discussed in its pages, many vital musical concepts that are not addressed, and countless ideas that are left unexplored. However, this is a feature, not a bug. The authors of this book reject the idea that a comprehensive overview of “important” music is either desirable or possible. Instead, our approach values diversity and depth. Each chapter includes wildly dissimilar examples from various times and places, each of which is uncovered as both a sonic object and a cultural artifact. The result, we hope, will be renewed interest in the music one hears every day, broadened taste for music that was once unfamiliar, and expanded awareness of the music that is still waiting to be discovered.\n\nIn short, this book does not offer a definitive curriculum. What it offers is a new approach to thinking about and engaging music—an approach that we have already piloted with a variety of student audiences and know to be successful. Whether you are reading this book on your own or using it as part of a course, we hope you will find that it is full of new ideas and sounds that change the way you listen to and think about music.\n\nPage | ix\n\nRESONANCES\n\nHOW TO USE THIS BOOK\n\nNOTES TO THE INSTRUCTOR\n\nThis text is meant to be highly adaptable to your desired curricular and learning objectives, and you are welcome to use it in any way you see fit. It is accompanied by a complete set of teaching materials, including PowerPoint slides, test banks, and videos. These can be accessed through the UNG Press website and the UNG\n\nMusic Department YouTube channel.\n\nWhat follows are some guidelines and suggestions for using this text: 1. By our estimation, this textbook contains enough material for four semester-length music appreciation courses. This allows the instructor to select the desired chapters and/or examples and also to change the curriculum from semester to semester. We strongly advise that you do not attempt to teach this entire text in a single semester.\n\nYou will find that the outcome is much more satisfactory if you lead students to engage deeply with a limited number of examples.\n\n2. This textbook is designed to be modular. Any subset of chapters can be assigned in any order, and individual examples can be skipped.\n\nAlthough we advise that you teach one chapter at a time, choosing which examples to use and which to omit, it is also possible to reorganize this volume at the level of the musical example. For instance, one might choose to teach only works from the Western classical tradition, and to do so in chronological order. While this is not ideal, the fact that each example is self-contained means that it can be done. (You might also find that individual entries are of use in other music courses.)\n\n3. In addition to being a textbook, this volume proposes a new approach to organizing the music appreciation curriculum. The examples reflect the expertise of the authors, but they are by no means exhaustive. It goes without saying that many important and interesting musical works are not included. As such, you are invited not only to chart your own path through the examples but to add your own. Please feel free to integrate additional material under the appropriate chapter headings!\n\n4. Although the musical examples linked in this book are primarily audio-only, we recommend videos of live performances for pedagogical use, and have included our recommendations in the chapter playlists on the UNG Music Department YouTube channel. Live performances are also linked in the PowerPoint slides. We chose to link to audio recordings supplied to YouTube by record labels with the hope that they will remain accessible for the life of this text, which in turn means that the listening guides will remain relevant and useful. We have found, however, that students respond much more positively when they are able to watch a performance.\n\nPage | x\n\nRESONANCES\n\nHOW TO USE THIS BOOK\n\n5. You will find that some of the musical examples are accompanied by listening guides, but that many are not. There are several reasons for this. To begin with, the authors felt that only certain examples would benefit greatly from listening guides. Although guides can be helpful, we don’t want them to limit students’ engagement with the examples.\n\nFinally, we thought that the creation of listening guides for the remaining examples would make a good assignment for your students to complete.\n\n6. This textbook is only a tool in support of a great music appreciation course, the most important elements of which are listening, discussion, and reflection. The focal point of any course, whether in person or online, should be direct engagement with the musical objects under consideration. This means focused and repeated listening/watching, accompanied by guided observation. It is up to you to change the way your students perceive and understand musical objects. Happy teaching!\n\nHELP MAKE THIS BOOK BETTER!\n\nThe authors intend to issue at least one revised edition of this book, which was developed on an abbreviated timeline and does not contain everything we could have wished. We want our revisions to reflect the needs and interests of those who use the text. Is it missing examples that you would like to teach? Is there an additional unit or chapter that could be integrated? Can information be added to a discussion? Could the text package incorporate additional teaching tools? Did you find an error?

Johnston and Esther M. Morgan-Ellis\n\nWHAT IS MUSIC?\n\nIt is surprisingly difficult to define the term “music.” More specifically, it can be challenging to determine what is not music, and to explain why.\n\nFor example, is bird song music? It is beautiful and enjoyable to listen to, and bird song often features clear, catchy melodies. Some birds learn songs from one another, thereby developing diverse repertoires. Is it a problem that birds sing primarily to communicate and attract mates? Humans certainly make music for those purposes. Does the reason for singing determine whether a song counts as music or not? Can music even be made by non-humans, or is it a uniquely human phenomenon?\n\nLet’s consider another example. Are the noises of the city music? How about when they are carefully recorded and curated for release by a record company?\n\nIn 1964, Michael Siegel issued an album entitled Sounds of the Junk Yard1 on\n\nImage 1.1: Is bird song music?\n\nSource: PxHere\n\nAttribution: Unknown\n\nLicense: CC0\n\nPage | 2\n\nRESONANCES\n\nMUSIC IN HUMAN LIFE\n\nFolkways Records. Does this enshrinement turn the sounds into music? Does your opinion change when you consider that the rock band Sonic Youth was directly inspired by Sounds of the Junk Yard and sought to replicate its sounds in their playing? How about when noises are painstakingly arranged into a collage by a composer? The 1952 work Williams Mix 2 by John Cage is made up entirely of prerecorded sounds. How about when they are imitated by a musical instrument?\n\nHenry Cowell set out to capture the sounds of the New York subway with his 1916\n\npiano composition Dynamic Motion3. Or when they are integrated into a concert work, such as the real car horns used in Gershwin’s 1928 orchestral composition An American in Paris?\n\nSiegel’s 1964 album Sounds of the Junk Yard has inspired 1.\n\nmusicians. This example is titled “Loading Pick-Up Truck.”\n\nCage’s 1952 Williams Mix is made up entirely of real-world 2.\n\nsounds that he recorded, organized, and assembled. Is this music?\n\nCowell’s 1916 Dynamic Motion imitates the sounds of the 3.\n\nNew York subway.\n\nThe broadest definition of music to date was provocatively set forth on August 29, 1952, by the American composer John Cage. He made his statement not in words but with a performance of a composition that is known as 4’33” . The premiere of 4’33” was given by pianist David Tudor, who came out onto the stage and proceeded to sit in silence at the keyboard for the time indicated in the title, interrupting his performance only to open and close the keyboard at predetermined time markers. The musical contents of the performance, therefore, were not sounds that emanated from the piano but rather the incidental sounds that audience members happened to perceive during the allotted time: rustling programs, whispers, laughter, a passing train. The composer certainly did not know what these sounds would be and exercised no control over them—and indeed, the sounds heard during performances today would in some cases have been unimaginable to the composer, who died in 1992. The object of this composition was to make the case that any sounds could be music as long as they were listened to as music. In other words, music is in the ear of the beholder. It is defined not by its source or by the intent of its creator. It is defined by the act of listening.\n\nThere is continued debate over how to define “music.” The Google Dictionary definition—that is to say, the definition that one is most likely to come across—reads Page | 3\n\nRESONANCES\n\nMUSIC IN HUMAN LIFE\n\n“vocal or instrumental sounds (or both) combined in such a way as to produce beauty of form, harmony, and expression of emotion.” This describes most music, to be sure. But does music have to be beautiful? If so, who is the arbiter of what is beautiful? Does music have to express emotion? And what about music that is created not by voices or instruments but by computers (e.g. electronic dance music)? The above definition excludes a lot.\n\nFor a more clinical take, we can turn to Merriam-Webster, which describes music as “the science or art of ordering tones or sounds in succession, in combination, and in temporal relationships to produce a composition having unity and continuity.”\n\nThis definition is more difficult to criticise, but it still seems lacking. What about the power of music to make us cry, or dance, or become overwhelmed with nostalgia?\n\nWhat about the significance of music to personal and cultural identity? A dictionary definition certainly doesn’t have to address these dimensions, but they are integral to a deeper understanding of what music really is.\n\nTHE POWER OF MUSIC\n\nAlthough we might argue over what is and what is not music, there is no question that music is important. Its significance ranges from the historical to the cultural to the biological. Music has played a role in every documented human society of the past and present. The oldest instrument found to date is an ivory flute created about 43,000 years ago—clear evidence that music is not a recent development.\n\nBut why did humans start making music? The answers to that question might be discovered by examining the extraordinary effects that making and listening to music has on our brains.\n\nImage 1.2: This bone flute from the Geissenklösterle cave Germany is the oldest known musical instrument.\n\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\n\nAttribution: José-Manuel Benito\n\nLicense: CC BY-SA 2.5\n\nMusic, Human Experience, and the Brain\n\nAll of our activities are governed by the amazing organ situated inside of our skulls and between our ears: the human brain. And it is clear to religionists and evolutionists alike that there is something distinctly different between humans and other animals. But what is that difference? What makes us capable of complex reason and emotion? What gives us the ability to have an awareness of our own Page | 4\n\nRESONANCES\n\nMUSIC IN HUMAN LIFE\n\nthought processes? It can’t simply be the size of our brains, as the brains of blue whales are much larger than those of humans, yet we don’t credit them with equivalent intelligence. Conversely, gorilla brains are only a little smaller than human brains, and they are not capable of the extreme creative and processing power of humanity. So what is it that makes our brains different?\n\nImage 1.3: This brain, which belonged to a sperm whale, is many times the size of a human brain.\n\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\n\nAttribution: Yohei Yamashita\n\nLicense: CC BY-SA 2.0\n\nWhat makes us human?\n\nConsider just a few of the qualities that are claimed to be unique to humans.\n\nWe recognize ourselves in the working order of things, and are capable of standing back as a spectator and seeing our part in the greater picture. In other words, we have self-consciousness, and are capable of making choices based upon that information. Scientists use the mirror test (whether or not an animal species recognizes reflections of themselves as self, rather than another animal) to measure self-consciousness. But there are many species of primates that recognize their reflections as self, so that characteristic isn’t unique to humans. We have an appreciation of beauty and of aesthetic things, and are compelled as a species to create art. But there are some elephants who paint surprisingly beautiful imitations of the world around them, and some birds who decorate their nests—does this mean that they possess our same capacity for appreciation of aesthetics?\n\nPage | 5\n\nRESONANCES\n\nMUSIC IN HUMAN LIFE\n\nWhat about humor? All people possess a sense of humor (though some have less than others) and can appreciate and express humor. Not only does humor require intelligence and understanding of situational variables, but it also requires the ability to see the odd, absurd and ironic. But there are chimpanzees that “laugh”\n\nwhen they are tickled, and if you watch young chimps playing long enough, you will eventually see one pull a prank on another and run away “laughing.”\n\nImage 1.4: This elephant is painting\n\nImage 1.4: This satin bowerbird has\n\na picture. Does that mean it can\n\ndecorated its courtship stage with a wide\n\nappreciate art?\n\nvariety of blue objects.

While many creatures exhibit behaviors we could characterize as mourning when they lose a beloved human or fellow animal, humans have elaborate funeral rituals upon death. The ancient Egyptians actually buried people with physical objects so that they would have things with them in the next life. But elephants4 have been observed burying their dead (and the dead of other species) in addition to placing food, fruit, and flowers with their bodies. That sounds a lot like a funeral.\n\nThis video captures elephants seeming to mourn a dead\n\n4.\n\ncompanion.\n\nWhat about awareness of time? Humans experience sequence of events, form memories, and then predict future outcomes, and we have ways of measuring the passing of time in equal intervals (think second hand on a watch). Dogs and other animals certainly don’t have clocks or devices, but they reliably know when it is dinner time. Is this because of biological processes, or do they, too, have some sense of time?\n\nPage | 6\n\nRESONANCES\n\nMUSIC IN HUMAN LIFE\n\nWhat about love? It is arguably one of the most important motivational forces in a human’s life, but are we alone in this? Animals display behaviors that clearly indicate affection, but do they love each other the way we do? Cats will rub their companions and purr, whales can deliberately save seals from attack, and dogs display extraordinary altruism towards their owners and other creatures. In humans, these behaviors signal the thing we call love. Do animals experience it the way we do?\n\nWhat about language? Humanity is the only species that uses language, although we are clearly not the only species that communicates. So what is different about us? Animals communicate in many ways with one another, and some gorillas have been taught sign-language. Koko the gorilla reportedly understood over 2,000\n\nspoken words and was able to use more than 1,000 signs to convey thoughts and emotions. She was even able to communicate compound ideas by using signs in ways they had not been taught to her. This certainly was a form of communication and language use, although Koko could never learn to speak. In addition, while some animals can understand words, sounds, and tone of voice, they do not comprehend syntax or communicate in complex sentences. Throughout history, human beings have devised hundreds of languages and endless dialects, despite the fact that we are born with no way to verbally communicate, at all. So what is it about our brains that makes them capable of complex language, when the composition of our brains is so similar to chimpanzees and gorillas?\n\nImage 1.6: Bonobos Kanzi and Panbanisha are pictured here communicating with a pictorial “keyboard.”\n\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\n\nAttribution: User “Wcalvin”\n\nLicense: CC BY-SA 4.0\n\nPage | 7\n\nRESONANCES\n\nMUSIC IN HUMAN LIFE\n\nLanguage and the Human Brain\n\nIt comes down to the structure of our brains and to what those structures do.\n\nGenerally, the human brain can be divided into three regions: the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain. This characteristic is absent in most animals. Although the size of the brain itself does not determine complex intelligence, the size of the brain in relationship to the size of the body matters. Humans win the rodeo with the largest brain of all animals in comparison\n\nto the size of their bodies. In addition,\n\nthe human brain has more neurons in its\n\noutermost layer (the cerebral cortex)\n\nthan do other animals, and the insulation\n\naround nerve fibers in the human brain\n\nis thicker than that of other animals,\n\nenabling more rapid signal transfer\n\nbetween neurons. We literally think\n\nbetter and faster. But it is the structures\n\nresponsible for language production and\n\ncomprehension (Broca’s and Wernicke’s\n\nareas) that are unique to human beings. Image 1.7: These are the regions of the And, interestingly, both of these areas brain.\n\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\n\nare heavily involved in the processing of Attribution: User “BruceBlaus”\n\nmusic, which brings us to the crux of the License: CC BY-SA 4.0\n\nmatter: human beings are the only\n\nanimals who employ “music” and\n\n“language”. That is what separates us\n\nfrom every other species on the planet.\n\nAnd it seems as though we do these\n\nthings because we have been endowed\n\nwith neuroanatomical structures that\n\nare unique to us. So what do these two\n\ncritical brain regions do? And how is\n\nmusic cognition different from language\n\ncognition?\n\nEarly investigators learned about\n\nparticular regions of the brain that\n\ncontrol speech by observing patients’\n\nlimitations and then conducting\n\npostmortem exams. A French neurologist Image 1.8: This engraving from ca. 1881\n\nnamed Paul Broca observed a patient depicts Paul Broca, a French neurologist responsible for making foundational\n\nwho understood language but who was discoveries about language and the unable to produce more than a few brain.\n\nisolated words. When that patient died, Source: Wikimedia Commons Attribution: Unknown\n\nBroca conducted a postmortem exam License: Public Domain\n\nPage | 8\n\nRESONANCES\n\nMUSIC IN HUMAN LIFE\n\nPersons with damage to Broca’s area understand heard language and know what they wish to say but are unable to speak. They can’t speak because Broca’s area controls the physical production of speech. Essentially, our brains take in auditory stimuli, then Broca’s area (in conjunction with Wernieke’s area, which we will discuss in a moment) converts the stimuli to neuronal\n\nrepresentations that are then translated into\n\nthe physical motions involved in producing\n\nspeech sounds. To put this more simply, that\n\narea of the brain helps us understand what we\n\nhear, formulate articulate thoughts and then\n\nconvert them into speech.\n\nAbout ten years later, a neurologist\n\nnamed Carl Wernicke identified a similar,\n\nImage 1.9: Broca’s area and\n\nWernieke’s area handle the input\n\nbut different, problem in patients who\n\nof sound, conversion of sound to\n\nwere unable to comprehend language or to\n\nunderstanding, and utterance of\n\nconstruct meaningful sentences, even though\n\nspoken language.\n\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\n\nthey did not experience difficulty in producing\n\nAttribution: Peter Hagoort\n\narticulate words. In postmortem examination,\n\nLicense: CC BY 3.0\n\nhe found lesions at the junction of the parietal,\n\ntemporal, and occipital lobes. He deduced that\n\nthis area, now termed Wernicke’s area, had\n\nsomething to do with the understanding of\n\nlanguage. Conjunctly, Broca’s and Wernicke’s\n\nareas handle the input of sound, conversion\n\nof sound to understanding, and utterance of\n\nspoken language. And these two areas are\n\ndistinct to humans. The genuinely fascinating\n\nthing is that for many years, these areas were\n\nthought to be exclusively involved in the\n\nprocessing of language. But recent researchers\n\nhave discovered through fMRI (functional\n\nmagnetic resonance imaging) technology\n\nthat the two language processing centers are\n\nactivated during listening to and processing\n\nmusic, even when it contains no text. In other\n\nImage 1.10: The German\n\nwords, your two language centers fire when\n\nphysician Carl Wernicke,\n\nyou are listening to instrumental music and\n\nphotographed here in the early\n\n20th century, expanded on\n\nare not processing language.

Lehmann, Muenchen\n\nLicense: Public Domain\n\nthis phenomenon?\n\nPage | 9\n\nRESONANCES\n\nMUSIC IN HUMAN LIFE\n\nConnections Between Speech and Music\n\nWhat two things do you think of most easily when someone asks, “What is music?” Probably variation in pitch (frequency) and rhythm (time), even though those are not the only elements of music. Is there a pitch and a rhythm to speech?\n\nRead that question aloud to yourself, and note the fact that not all words are the same pitch. This is because we emphasize more important words and increase pitch when asking a question. Read it again and note the fact that not all of the words are the same speed or length, due to the fact that we vary the rhythm of speech sounds. And not only that: there is a syntax (the orderly arrangement of sounds in a system) to both language and music. They behave similarly in that the arrangement of sounds is predictable and conforms to patterns. And there we have it. Our brains are uniquely constructed for the successful intake, conversion, and execution of language and music. And the reason other animals can’t and don’t make music or speech (some animals make musical sounds, but the construction of these sounds doesn’t conform to syntactical rules, so these sounds aren’t actually music in the way we understand it) is because their brains lack the two areas involved in the processing of orderly sound systems. How crazy is that?\n\nBut what does this really mean about the nature of music and speech? It suggests that those are the two primary things that make us human and that distinguish us from all other creatures on the planet. That’s a significant point. But music isn’t only processed in Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas, although speech primarily is.\n\nBefore we examine that, however, we need to discuss how the brain is generally structured. The brain is divided into three main parts: the cerebrum, the cerebellum, and the brain stem. The cerebrum is the part that gives the brain its wrinkled appearance. It is divided into a left and right hemisphere separated by the corpus callosum, a bundle of fibers that transmit messages from one side of the brain to the other. The cerebrum performs higher functions like receiving and analyzing sensory input such as touch, sight, and sound, and also processes reasoning, emotion, memory, and fine\n\nmotor control. Both Broca’s and\n\nWernicke’s areas are situated in the cere-\n\nbrum. The cerebellum is located under\n\nthe cerebrum. It primarily coordinates\n\nmuscle movements, and processes the\n\nbody’s position in space for purposes of\n\nbalance. The brainstem is the most evo-\n\nlutionarily primal area of the brain—one\n\nthat we share with other primates. The\n\nbrainstem performs primarily autono-\n\nImage 1.11: The brain is divided into\n\nmous functions—those that don’t involve the cerebrum, the cerebellum, and the voluntary thought, like heart rate, brain stem.\n\nbreathing, body temperature, digestion, Source: Wikipedia Attribution: Cancer Research UK\n\nswallowing, coughing, and vomiting. You License: CC BY-SA 4.0\n\nPage | 10\n\nRESONANCES\n\nMUSIC IN HUMAN LIFE\n\ncan see that as you move upward from the brainstem, the functions of the brain become more complex.\n\nNow that we’ve handled some of the less-interesting technical information about the way the brain is structured, let’s go back to the cerebrum, where most complex brain function occurs. If we can arrive at an understanding of the way the cerebrum is divided and what kinds of information are processed in each area, it will help us to understand the differences in the way the brain processes language and music—perhaps the two most significant markers of what it is to be human.\n\nAs previously mentioned, the cerebrum is divided into a left and right hemisphere that communicate with one another across the corpus callosum. Not all functions of the two hemispheres are shared. In general, the left hemisphere controls the physical motion on the right side of the body and the right hemisphere controls the physical motion on the left side of the body. Also, in general terms, the left hemisphere processes speech, comprehension, arithmetic, and writing. The right hemisphere controls creativity, spatial ability, and artistic and musical skills. This explanation is a bit misleading, however.\n\nIf you look down at a brain from the top, you can see it is divided into two distinct hemispheres. But if you look at the brain from the side, you can see that each hemisphere has distinct fissures that divide the brain into chunks, called lobes. Each hemisphere has four lobes. Moving from front to back, they are the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes. Each can be divided even further into areas that serve specific functions (like Broca’s and Werneike’s areas). But it is important to understand that no lobe or area of the brain functions in isolation.\n\nThere are complex networks between the lobes of the brain and between the hemispheres that interact to process information. In that sense, our brains are the most complex computers on the planet! We’ll quickly take a look at what is generally processed in each lobe before circling back to talk about the differences between language and music processing in the brain.\n\nFrontal lobe processing determines personality, behavior, emotions, judgment, planning, problem solving, speech (Broca’s area), fine body movement, intelligence, Image 1.12: This diagram illustrates the\n\nlobes of the human brain.\n\nImage 1.13: This diagram illustrates the\n\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\n\nfunctional areas of the human brain.\n\nAttribution: User “Sebastian023”\n\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\n\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0\n\nAttribution: User “BruceBlaus”\n\nLicense: CC BY 3.0\n\nPage | 11\n\nRESONANCES\n\nMUSIC IN HUMAN LIFE\n\nconcentration, and one of the other defining characteristics of human beings: self-awareness. You can see that the frontal lobe (put your hand up to your forehead—\n\nthat’s where the frontal lobe is) handles most of the things that make you, well…\n\nyou. This is why traumatic injury to the frontal lobe from head-impact is often absolutely devastating to the individual. You can lose what it is to be you if that area is damaged. The parietal lobe processes senses of touch, pain, and temperature, and interprets signals from vision, hearing, motor input, memory, and spatial perception. It also plays a role in the interpretation of language and words. Moving further back, the temporal lobe handles the understanding of language (Wernicke’s area), memory, hearing, sequencing, and organization. And finally, the occipital lobe interprets visual stimuli, including color, light, and movement. Whew! That was a lot of information about our highly complex human brain.\n\nSo let’s go back to examine language processing a little more deeply. First, our ears take in sound waves and translate them into electrical impulses that travel through nerves to different parts of the brain. The first place they go is the auditory cortex in the temporal lobe, where the sound is translated into neuronal representations (basically, your brain’s “image” of the sounds). The neuronal representations are then transmitted to the areas of the brain involved in interpreting them and deciding what to do with them. In the case of speech that is only heard, the auditory cortex and Werneike’s area are primarily involved. In the case of language that is read and interpreted, the visual cortex and Werneike’s area are primarily involved. In the case of speech that is produced, Werneike’s area transmits neuronal representations to Broca’s area, which converts them into spoken language with involvement in the motor cortex. But if language and music are so similar, what is different in the way that the brain processes language and music?\n\nWell, to begin with, language processing is fairly isolated. As we’ve discussed, depending on the type of language activity a person is engaging with, there are a few areas primarily involved in processing the information. In the case of music cognition, however, the brain lights up like a Christmas tree. There is activity all over the place: in both hemispheres, in all four lobes, in the cerebellum, and even in the brain stem. With the advent of fMRI, we can see which areas of the brain light up as a person is engaging with music. As in the case of language, it depends upon the way in which you are engaging with music. But the one thing that is consistent is that no matter how you are engaging—whether you are listening passively, or listening actively (listening and thinking about what you are listening to), whether you are hearing music with or without words, whether you are playing music, reading music, writing and composing music, or improvising music—a unique neural network lights up all across the brain. Normally unrelated areas of the brain work in synchronicity to process music, even when they do not coordinate to process any other type of information. That is pretty crazy! Even the brain stem—the part of the brain that handles automatic and subconscious processes—assists in music cognition.\n\nPage | 12\n\nRESONANCES\n\nMUSIC IN HUMAN LIFE\n\nSo here we come to the crux of it. The human brain is an incredibly complicated computer. It handles incomprehensible amounts of information every second, and is more complex than the brains of other animals. There are two primary things that separate us from all other animals on the planet: language and music. Our brains are structured differently than are those of other animals, and it is these specialized structures that allow us to engage in language and music. But while language processing is complex, music cognition is even more complex, involving more brain regions and involving activity in both hemispheres, all lobes, the cerebrum, and the brainstem.\n\nBeyond this, music also activates the limbic system within which emotions and feelings are processed. It is capable of eliciting sympathetic emotional response from listeners even in the absence of words, and our memory systems are intrinsically woven into the brain’s processing of music. This is why music can be used to “bring back” patients with Alzheimer’s5, and why you can remember a song even if you haven’t heard it for 40 years. Suddenly, you’ll find yourself singing along and wondering how in the world you still have that information in there—but it’s in there because the retrieval pathways were laid down in more than one way.\n\nYou won’t remember a poem or a story, or any other information, the way you remember music. For this reason, it is a profound educational tool: information can be entrained quickly and permanently when connected to music. Think about how many things were taught to you as a child through song, beginning with learning your letters! The A-B-C song is the most commonly taught song in the U.S. (and many other places have their own version) because it is such an effective way of teaching children to remember otherwise unfamiliar and disconnected information (the sound of each letter and the order in which they occur in the alphabet). If it is such a profound educational tool because of the effects on memory and retention, how else can music be used?\n\nThis video details the experience of Henry, a man with\n\n5.\n\nAlzheimer’s Disease, who remembers who he is through the\n\nuse of music.\n\nMUSIC AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT, LEARNING,\n\nAND WELLNESS\n\nDue to the information that we have gained from the field of neuroscience, the use of music therapy has exploded in the past decades. Music therapy is the clinical and evidence-based use of music interventions to accomplish individualized goals within a therapeutic relationship by a licensed music therapist. And because music is processed all over the brain, music therapy can be utilized to rehabilitate patients suffering from a broad host of disorders, ranging from traumatic brain injury to cerebral palsy, from learning disabilities to Parkinson’s Disease. It can be Page | 13\n\nRESONANCES\n\nMUSIC IN HUMAN LIFE\n\nused to regain voluntary movement or return speech skills when they have been lost because of a blood clot or stroke. And the remarkable thing is how genuinely effective these interventions are.\n\nThe Field of Music Therapy\n\nIt is important to talk about what music therapy is, and what it is not. Although all people can participate in music, and music teachers spend time creating music and working with students, board certified music therapists are the only individuals who participate in an allied health profession that is research-based, and that, in the words of the American Music Therapy Association, “actively applies supportive science to the creative, emotional, and energizing experiences of music for health treatment and educational goals.” Music therapy is applied in either an educational or clinical context, and music therapists must hold a music degree(s) and a degree in music therapy. The degree involves clinical internship and certification by the board of the American Music Therapy Association (AMTA). Licensing involves many hours of training in order to understand which musical activities to apply in a given context, and it may be used to improve individuals’ functioning, health, or wellbeing.\n\nSo why does music therapy work? Because it is a stimulus that activates every major region of the brain simultaneously. Because music processing occurs globally in the brain, it develops more comprehensive and stronger neurologic processes.\n\nAccording to Sharon Graham, founder and director of the Tampa Bay Institute for Image 1.14: Here, a music therapist works with a patient who is recovering from traumatic brain injury.\n\nSource: Military Health System\n\nAttribution: Caitlin Russell\n\nLicense: Public Domain\n\nPage | 14\n\nRESONANCES\n\nMUSIC IN HUMAN LIFE\n\nMusic Therapy, “Music is used as a stimulus when one encounters trauma, disease or disorder, and is the most powerful non-pharmacological tool we have to address any deficits that arise.”\n\nWhat is music therapy used for? The possibilities are almost limitless! It may be used for physical rehabilitation and facilitating movement, because when we hear rhythmic information, the motor cortex in our brains is activated: It is for this reason that you are compelled to move on the beat when you hear a peppy song. Have you ever noticed how people unconsciously coordinate themselves in time when music is played? Pay attention when music is playing outdoors—\n\nnearly everyone will begin to walk at the same tempo as the music. The funny thing is that they don’t even realize they are doing it! The activation of the motor cortex can be utilized by music therapists to increase motor function and voluntary movement in people with Parkinson’s and Multiple Sclerosis and in physically injured veterans.\n\nMusic therapy may be used to facilitate improvement of mood and reduction of depression. This works for multiple reasons, not the least of which is that music is enjoyable. However, it also works because we have an immediate physiological response to the music we enjoy. Engaging with liked music causes the release of serotonin and dopamine- neurotransmitters\n\nin the brain, which leads to feelings of\n\nhappiness and well-being. It also releases\n\nnorepinephrine, which can result in a sense\n\nof alertness and euphoria. The act of singing,\n\nin particular, releases endorphins—the\n\n“feel good” chemicals in the brain. Choral\n\nsinging (singing in a group with others) has\n\nbeen shown to cause the release of oxytocin,\n\nwhich enhances feelings of trust and bonding\n\nand results in reduction of depression and\n\nloneliness. One study recently indicated that\n\nchoral singers have lower levels of cortisol,\n\nindicating lower stress, while multiple studies\n\nhave indicated that singing relieves anxiety\n\nand contributes to quality of life. And the best\n\npart is, you don’t have to be a good singer to\n\nreap the rewards: A 2005 study indicated\n\nthat group singing “can produce satisfying\n\nand therapeutic sensations even when the\n\nsound produced by the vocal instrument is of\n\nImage 1.15: This music therapist is\n\nmediocre quality.”\n\nvisiting Renown Children’s Hospital\n\nStudies have indicated that music can be\n\nin Reno, Nevada.\n\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\n\nused to reduce insomnia and to reduce the\n\nAttribution: Dara Crockett\n\nperception of pain, and it can be used as part\n\nLicense: CC BY-SA 4.0\n\nPage | 15\n\nRESONANCES\n\nMUSIC IN HUMAN LIFE\n\nof a rehabilitation protocol after injury or surgery. One study from the General Hospital of Salzburg found patients recovering from back surgery had higher rates of healing and less pain when exposed to music. Music therapy can be used with older adults to lessen the effects of dementia and Alzheimer’s Disease and it can be used to restore speech when aphasia (loss of ability to speak) occurs as a result of injury or stroke. Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords used music therapy to regain speech after surviving a gunshot wound to her brain. Interestingly, music can also be used to reduce the symptoms of asthma, can be used in premature infants to improve sleep patterns and to increase weight gain, and can be used to help people with Down’s Syndrome or Autism when speech is limited. In fact, it seems that there is little that music therapy cannot be utilized to improve. So what should we take away from all of this? That music is awesome, of course, and that everyone should engage with music actively throughout the course of their lives.\n\nWhy do (and should) humans make music?\n\nIf music can help rewire a brain that has been damaged or is limited in some way, it can also be used to create new brain growth and increase processing efficiency in all students. This is why there is a strong correlation (relationship) between studying music and higher grades in other subject areas. In 2015, the Image 1.16: Studying music can lead to higher achievement in other areas.\n\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\n\nAttribution: F. Rodricks\n\nLicense: CC BY-SA 4.0\n\nPage | 16\n\nRESONANCES\n\nMUSIC IN HUMAN LIFE\n\nEvery Student Succeeds Act replaced No Child Left Behind, and for the first time codified music as part of a core, well-rounded academic experience with which all children should be provided. The current academic environment focuses on and prizes primarily STEM subjects, but we have learned that it is actually the A in STEAM (Arts) that provides training ground for the things employers say they prize more than subject-matter knowledge: creativity, initiative, and the ability to generate new solutions to problems not previously encountered. No child should go through school without access to these subjects.\n\nHumans have engaged in music for as long as we have written history. Even before humans had the ability to write down the music they were creating and performing, they produced written descriptions documenting the fact that they valued music. The Biblical authors wrote about people engaging in music by playing instruments, dancing, and singing. Clearly, music was a part of those ancient cultures. We don’t know what that music sounded like, because they didn’t have a system to write it down, but we know they were doing it.\n\nWe also know that humans have been “musicking” since long before written history, as evidenced by prehistoric bone flutes found in various parts of the world.\n\nThe existence of these instruments suggests that music may actually have preceded formalized spoken language as we understand it, and certainly preceded writing.\n\nTo put this in perspective, humans were creating and playing instruments when wooly mammoths and saber tooth tigers roamed the earth. And to make that fact even more intriguing, when researchers blew through those flutes, they heard the pentatonic scale still in use in elementary school music today. Why would those early humans have created music, when the primary objectives were to eat, not die from the elements, and not be eaten? We can’t answer this question definitively, but one theory is that they were imitating the sounds they heard in nature. Another is that humans utilized music to coordinate themselves in time together (think: one, two, three - pull! ). Yet another is that music simply feels good and touches something spiritual in humans. We will likely never know. All we can say for certain is that music is one of the things that separates us from every other animal on the planet, including our closest relatives, and that it was part of human experience before modern humans existed.\n\nOne final consideration is that it appears as though music and language acquisition skills are innately learned by humans. No one sits down with children and attempts to formally teach them to produce language or music. They simply learn those things by listening to and imitating the sounds being used in their environment. All humans in all cultures the world over uniformly amass both language and music skills simply by being immersed in an environment in which those systems are being used. And this tells us that our brains are hardwired for success with those two systems. Even if we didn’t have fMRI scans to show us that, we can deduce it from the informal experiences of babies. Studies have even shown that newborn infants who have had no experience in the world whatsoever recognize and respond to essential musical elements. These elements, which will be described and discussed in the next section, Page | 17\n\nRESONANCES\n\nMUSIC IN HUMAN LIFE\n\ninclude tonic and dominant (I and V in the scale—the two most important chords) and meter (the way beats are grouped and divided). How is it that babies’ brains are able to do this with no training? It’s hardwired!\n\nMusic and Innate Aptitude\n\nWe have all seen that some people seem naturally to have more musical ability than others. Some children seem born singing beautifully, while others struggle to develop musical skills. We tend to look at children who sing early and well, and think, “ Oh, she’s so talented.” But that perception can be a little misleading, and here’s why.\n\nResearchers have indicated that there are two primary things that contribute to musical ability. One of them is aptitude, which is defined as the ease and speed with which your brain processes certain kinds of information. Aptitude is innate.\n\nYou’re born with it. It is woven into the development of the grey matter in your brain as you are developing in your mother’s womb. Strangely, research indicates that aptitude is developmental until somewhere around age eight or nine. In other words, the ease and speed with which your brain is able to process certain types of information is formative until you reach age nine, at which time it stabilizes. From that point forward, you will be reliant on whatever aptitude you developed during your earliest years. This doesn’t mean you can’t learn to do new things or develop new skills. We can all learn to do things within whatever aptitude we possess. It just means that the ease and speed with which we work doesn’t fundamentally change beyond that point.\n\nImage 1.17: Everyone has an aptitude for music, even though some people have a greater aptitude than others.\n\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\n\nAttribution: User “Sungmin Yun”\n\nLicense: CC BY-SA 2.0\n\nPage | 18\n\nRESONANCES\n\nMUSIC IN HUMAN LIFE\n\nInterestingly, the same is true of aptitude for language, which makes sense, because the two systems are so intrinsically similar. Research has indicated that the same developmental window (birth to age nine) exists for language aptitude.\n\nFor both of these, early exposure, and early development, are critical for the rest of the life of a human being. How do we know language aptitude stabilizes at that age?\n\nObviously, it would be horribly unethical to lock children up for the first nine years of their lives and expose them to little or no language to see what would happen.\n\nWe can’t do that. We do, however, have multiple stories of severe neglect that shine some light on what happens when children don’t develop language aptitude while they are young.\n\nIn one particularly famous case, a young girl was born to an abusive father who kept her chained to a potty chair or in a crib, and rarely let anyone speak to her or interact with her. Because there was no interactivity with the sound system, this child did not learn to speak. When she was rescued, around age 12, she was immediately taken into custody, and teams of researchers attempted to teach her to speak. She learned the use of some nouns and verbs and was able to communicate simple things, but she never learned the complex grammar that all children innately learn simply by hearing language spoken around them and having people interact with them using language. In fact, researchers estimate that all she could achieve was the basic communicative ability of Koko the gorilla (who had limited ability to form compound or complex thoughts, and did so with sign language). Why was this? Because a child’s aptitude for certain kinds of processing is developmental, and is developed, during the first years of life. Once that developmental window closes, the child is working with established aptitude.\n\nIn another famous case, a child was kept contained in a room with a television on all day. The child was hearing language spoken regularly, but by abstract people on the television. In other words, no one was interacting with the child while using language. Interactivity is critical—just hearing language isn’t enough. That child did not learn to speak just by listening. In the same way, music aptitude is not developed simply by listening. Children must hear others around them singing and see them moving rhythmically, and others must interact with them as they do these things.\n\nIn addition to aptitude, the thing that most determines a person’s skill is achievement. This is what an individual does with the aptitude they have. Do they learn to sing and play an instrument? Do they learn to read and write? Do they regularly engage in creating music? If the answer is yes, then chances are, their achievement (or skill) will be relatively high. Does high innate aptitude automatically mean a person will have high achievement? No. There exists only a correlation between the two variables—not a causative relationship. A child may be born with lower aptitude but work her entire life and emerge as a person with relatively high skill after years of training. By the same token, a child may be born with relatively high aptitude but never engage with it or use it. That child is likely to have much lower achievement than the one who worked at it. Interestingly, the same seems to be true of language.\n\nPage | 19\n\nRESONANCES\n\nMUSIC IN HUMAN LIFE\n\nAnd in both cases, there is no such thing as a person with no aptitude. I’ve frequently heard people say: “Oh, I can’t sing.” My usual response is: “Yes, you can. Everyone can.” Usually when people make statements like that, what they actually mean is: “I don’t sing well.” But our society has robbed so many people of their birthright by fooling us into thinking that music is something only the most talented and skilled should do while everyone else watches, and, as a result, these people believe their aptitude is so low that they just shouldn’t do it. Knowing what we do about music and the brain, and about the benefits of engaging in music over the course of a lifetime, this is a pretty tragic thing! If I told you that simply singing, reading music, playing an instrument, or writing music over the course of a lifetime could decrease the likelihood of developing Alzheimer’s when you are older, would you change your mind about whether or not you should pursue it? (I hope so!) All humans have aptitude for music and for language. This aptitude is generally distributed along a bell curve. There are people with higher aptitude and people with lower aptitude. But none of us have no aptitude, because it is a matter of our brain structure.\n\nIn fact, they had to search the world over to find only ten or so people to participate in a study in amusia (a condition in which the brain simply doesn’t organize musical sounds into meaningful patterns). In people with amusia, the brain takes in sound, but it is disorganized and the individual can’t perceive the structure. In other words, they don’t hear music, they hear noise. While a normal individual might hear a beautiful symphony, an individual with amusia might perceive the sounds of New York City on a busy day. Obviously, both people hear the same thing, but one person’s brain organizes the sound meaningfully into melody, harmony, phrases, meter, and other elements, while the other’s brain doesn’t organize it at all. What a terrible thing! Can you imagine not being able to listen to and enjoy music? Not being able to play a song back in your mind? Not being able to tap on a beat because your brain doesn’t perceive the organization of meter and rhythm? Imagine how colorless life would be! Fundamentally, what I am telling you is this: Of course you can sing and learn to play an instrument, and learn to read or write music. Do you know how I know? Because you can listen to and enjoy music. Your brain is organizing the sound, which means you have the fundamental capacity to engage with it.\n\nMusic and Human Flourishing\n\nSo what does all of this together tell us? Music is important to the human species and always has been. Though you may remember a poem or a story, the way you remember words differs from the way you remember music. This difference is why music, like literature, belongs in the curriculum. Because information can be entrained quickly and permanently when connected to it, music is a profound educational tool. It is something that engages all areas of the brain at once, and no other activity does that.\n\nPage | 20\n\nRESONANCES\n\nMUSIC IN HUMAN LIFE\n\nImage 1.18: It’s never too late to get involved in music!\n\nSource: Flickr\n\nAttribution: Garry Knight\n\nLicense: CC BY 2.0\n\nMusic can be used to train and grow the brain and build connections between areas, or to rehabilitate and heal individuals. It assists in the formation of long-term memories and in the retrieval of stored information, increases processing efficiency in other modes of cognition, and assists the brain in coordinating normally unrelated brain regions. It is for these reasons that music is one of life’s most miraculous phenomena. It has probably been with us for the totality of our existence as a species. And despite the fact that there are a limited number of pitches and rhythmic patterns, people throughout history, in every corner of the globe and every culture ever recorded, have engaged in the creation and performance of music that is unique to them. It truly is part of our human birthright and deserves to again take its place as a critical curricular offering in all of our schools.\n\nAnd you know what else? Even if you didn’t learn to read music, sing, or play an instrument while you were in school, it’s not too late! Researchers tell us that you can begin at literally any point in life and still see benefits. It truly isn’t about how well you do it—it is that you regularly do it over time. So go join an ensemble or find some private lessons!\n\nRESOURCES FOR FURTHER LEARNING\n\nPrint\n\nKnight, Andrew J., A. Blythe LaGasse, and Alicia Ann Clair.

Morgan-Ellis\n\nTHE DIMENSIONS OF SOUND\n\nAll sound—not just music—has certain characteristics. The distinction between music and non-musical sounds, in most cases, is one of organization: sounds that we describe as noise tend to be irregular and unpredictable, while sounds that we describe as music are more likely to exhibit patterns. This is not always the case.\n\nA jackhammer, for instance, makes a regular and patterned noise, while certain composers create patternless music.\n\nWhether we are listening to noise or music, we will perceive the same elements: rhythm, pitch, volume, articulation, and timbre. These elements will combine in time to produce a sonic object of a given texture that either exhibits or lacks form. In the following sections, we will define each of these dimensions and explore the roles that each plays in the creation and perception of music.\n\nRhythm\n\nRhythm is the temporal aspect of sound. It is the pattern of “on” and “off”\n\nstates exhibited by any sound as time passes. Rhythm is by no means unique to music. When you speak, the consonants of your words produce rhythm. When a car drives by, the oscillating sounds of the tires and engines create rhythm.\n\nMusic often (although not always) features rhythmic patterns. The most basic of these is the pulse1, which—like the pulse produced by your own heart—is a sequence of regularly-spaced sounds. The frequency of the pulses determines\n\ntempo2, which can range from very slow to very fast. It makes sense that music should tend to be organized around a pulse, since our very existence is organized around pulses. Our hearts beat to a pulse, we often breathe to a pulse, we walk to a pulse, and we organize time into pulses (seconds). It is usually not difficult to detect the pulse in a musical work: simply tap your foot or clap your hands, and there it is.\n\nPage | 23\n\nRESONANCES\n\nTHE ELEMENTS OF MUSIC\n\n1.\n\nThis video demonstrates pulse.\n\n2.\n\nThis video demonstrates tempo.\n\nPulses, however, are usually not all of equal weight. Some have a greater musical significance than others. When pulses are organized into groups containing strong and weak beats, meter is established. Each metrical group is called a measure or bar. In notated music, these groups are physically separated by bar lines, which help performers to easily perceive how the pulses are grouped and to identify which is the strongest. While measures can contain any number of pulses, the most common grouping are two, three, and four. These groupings are termed duple, triple, and quadruple meter. Each measure in all three of these meters will begin with a strong pulse, termed the downbeat. In duple meter, the pattern of pulses is [strong-weak]. In triple, it is [strong-weak-weak]. And in quadruple, it is\n\n[strong-weak-medium-weak].\n\nPitch\n\nPitch3 refers to the “highness” or “lowness” of sound. Sound, of course, is not physically located in high or low spaces, but most listeners can easily perceive the difference between a high-pitched sound and a low-pitched sound. Our use of the terms high and low to describe pitch reflects the characteristics of sound waves.\n\nThis video introduces the concept of pitch in the context of 3.\n\na familiar melody.\n\nAll sounds are produced by vibrating bodies, which in turn produce sound waves that can be perceived by mechanisms in your ear and decoded by your brain. Pitch4\n\nis determined by the frequency of those sound waves. A high pitch is produced by a high-frequency sound wave, and a low pitch is produced by a low-frequency sound wave. The frequency of sound waves is in turn determined by the characteristics of the vibrating body that sparks them into action. All other parameters being equal, a long string, once plucked and set into motion, will produce a lower pitch than a\n\nshort string5. Likewise, a thick string will produce a lower pitch than a thin string of the same length. The same principles apply when you blow across the ends of Page | 24\n\nRESONANCES\n\nTHE ELEMENTS OF MUSIC\n\ntubes, strike bells, or beat drums: the larger, longer, and heavier the vibrating body, the lower the sound it will produce.\n\nThis online oscilloscope allows you to visualize sounds.\n\nPitch is reflected in the distance between waves, which will 4.\n\ndecrease as pitch level increases. Volume is reflected by the size of the waves, which will grow in amplitude as dynamic level increases.\n\nThis video demonstrates the relationship between pitch\n\n5.\n\nfrequency and wave form.\n\nMusic is usually characterized by the careful organization of pitches. To begin with, most musical systems recognize what is termed octave equivalence6. This is the consensus that you can halve or double the frequency of the pitch without changing its essential identity. To see this principle in action, attend any birthday party at which both women and men are present. When the guests sing “Happy Birthday,” they will not sing exactly the same pitches. Instead, the women will tend to sing in a high octave, and the men will tend to sing in a low octave. In technical terms, this means that the women will probably sing pitches that have frequencies equal to twice that of those sung by the men. However, all participants will agree that they are all singing the same pitches, or in unison. An octave is an example of an interval, which is the distance between two pitches.\n\nIn the Western system, we acknowledge this phenomenon by using the same letter names to designate pitches in different octaves. For example, pitches at the frequencies of 110 hz, 220 hz, 440 hz, 880 hz, and 1,760 hz are all called “A.”\n\nHowever, specific frequencies are still important. Music that contains mostly high pitches has a different effect on listeners than music containing mostly low pitches, even if the rhythms and sequence of pitches are the same. Additionally, melodic range7 (the distance between low and high pitches) and changes in register (the use of high or low pitches) can be important musical elements.\n\nThis video demonstrates octave equivalence in the context\n\n6.\n\nof “Happy Birthday.”\n\n7.\n\nThis video introduces the concept of melodic range.\n\nPage | 25\n\nRESONANCES\n\nTHE ELEMENTS OF MUSIC\n\nThe Western system—that is to say, the system of musical organization that was first developed in medieval Europe and continues to dominate global listening today—goes quite a bit further in its efforts to organize pitch. Let us return to the octave. Between the A at 220 Hz and the A at 440 Hz, there are a near-infinite assortment of possible frequencies at which an intermediary pitch might sound.\n\nHowever, we do not use all of those pitches when we create music. Instead, we identify a limited number of specific pitches to be used. The Western system is best represented by the piano keyboard, which is both familiar and useful.\n\nImage 2.1: Each white key on a piano is assigned a letter name. Those letter names repeat at each octave, reflecting our agreement that every A (for example), whether high or low, is in some sense the “same” note. The black keys are named after the adjoining white keys: simply add “flat” to the name of the white key to the right or\n\n“sharp” to the name of the white key to the left.\n\nSource: Public Domain Pictures\n\nAttribution: Karen Arnold\n\nLicense: CC0\n\nAs you can see, the space between the A at 220 Hz and the A at 440 Hz is divided across twelve piano keys. This is called the chromatic8 pitch set, and it includes all of the pitches used in Western music. However, composers only rarely use the entire chromatic pitch set. When you do hear music that uses every available note, you will probably find that it makes you uncomfortable. This is because we are used to hearing music built using a set of only seven pitches that is called a scale.\n\nMost music is based on one of two scales: the major scale9 and the minor scale10.\n\nIf the pitches in a piece of music are drawn from a major scale, it is described as being in the major mode. Likewise, if the pitches are drawn from a minor scale, it is in the minor mode. A scale can start on any pitch, which then determines the key of music that is based on that scale. For example, music created using pitches drawn from the A major scale is in the key of A major.\n\n8.\n\nThis video demonstrates the chromatic pitch set.\n\n9.\n\nThis video demonstrates a major scale.\n\nPage | 26\n\nRESONANCES\n\nTHE ELEMENTS OF MUSIC\n\n10.\n\nThis video demonstrates a minor scale.\n\nIn most pieces of music, pitches are assigned to two different roles: melody11\n\nand harmony12 & 13. Melodies are constructed out of a sequence of pitches. This is the part of a musical work that you might sing along with or that might get stuck in your head. Melodies have various characteristics, including shape14 and motion15, which can be conjunct (in which the melody primarily moves up and down the scale) and disjunct (in which the melody contains larger intervals and leaps). Harmonies are constructed out of groups of pitches that are usually sounded simultaneously and constitute chords16, while a sequence of harmonies is termed a chord progression. In a musical work, the harmony is usually unobtrusive and might be repetitive. A melody and a harmony sound good together when they are based on the same scale and contain some of the same pitches. However, every melody can be harmonized in many different ways, using various chords. Likewise, a single harmony can be used to accompany many different melodies.\n\nThis video demonstrates the melody to Beethoven’s “Ode to\n\n11.\n\nJoy.”\n\nThis video demonstrates melody and a possible harmony to\n\n12.\n\nBeethoven’s “Ode to Joy.”\n\nHere, you can hear Beethoven’s melody and harmony in the\n\n13.\n\ncontext of his original composition.\n\n14.\n\nThis video introduces the concept of melodic shape.\n\n15.\n\nThis video introduces the concept of melodic motion.\n\nPage | 27\n\nRESONANCES\n\nTHE ELEMENTS OF MUSIC\n\nThis video demonstrates chords, which are used to\n\n16.\n\nharmonize melodies.\n\nAlthough this text will not offer a technical explanation of harmony (which can become very complicated indeed), it is often central to the listening experience.\n\nA certain chord progression can surprise you, or excite you, or break your heart.\n\nIt is not necessary to understand harmonies from a theoretical perspective to feel their impact. You also don’t need a theoretical background to understand the role harmony plays in establishing and then satisfying or frustrating expectations. As long as a piece of music is in a key, one chord—the chord built on the note that the key is named after—will serve as a home base, while other chords in the key will facilitate journeys away from or back towards that home base. We get used to hearing certain chord progressions and come to expect them, so we often have a sense of where the music is going to go. If we hear an unexpected chord or—most shocking of all—a chord that is not in the key of the piece of music, we tend to respond emotionally.\n\nVolume\n\nLike pitch, volume—the loudness or softness of a sound—is a parameter of every soundwave. Volume is determined by the amplitude of the wave, such that waves with a large amplitude produce high-volume sound and waves with a small amplitude produce low-volume sounds. While volume is simple to understand and assess (we can all tell whether music is “loud” or “soft”), its significance in the creation of musical meaning cannot be overlooked. On the one hand, certain genres of music depend on volume for their identity. You cannot appreciate the impact of heavy metal by listening to it with the dial turned down, just as you cannot sing a baby to sleep at the top of your voice. Changes in volume can also communicate meaning in music. A gradual increase in volume can indicate growing excitement, while a sudden change in volume can indicate a dramatic mood shift.\n\nA few terms will help us to talk about volume, which is also referred to as dynamic level. An increase in volume is referred to as a crescendo, while a decrease is termed a decrescendo or diminuendo. Musicians in orchestras, bands, and choirs describe volume using Italian terms including fortissimo (very loud), forte (loud), mezzo forte (medium loud), mezzo piano (medium soft), piano (soft), and pianissimo (very soft). While this book will not employ these terms, you might encounter them elsewhere.\n\nArticulation\n\nArticulation has to do with how pitches are begun, sustained, and released, and it is driven primarily by changes in dynamic level. In music production Page | 28\n\nRESONANCES\n\nTHE ELEMENTS OF MUSIC\n\nlanguage, this dimension of sound is referred to as the envelope17. The envelope is independent of pitch, but it determines the character of that pitch. For example, a pitch might begin with a gentle increase in volume, or a sudden decrease, or no dynamic change. Once it has begun to sound, a pitch might be sustained for a long time, or it might be abruptly cut off. And when it is ended, it might be released with a decrease in volume, and increase in volume, or no dynamic change.\n\nThis video explains the four elements of the envelope: attack, 17.\n\ndecay, sustain, and release.\n\nAlthough the preceding description was highly technical, the effects of articulation are easy to perceive. At one end of the spectrum, a series of pitches might be heavily punctuated, with forceful onsets and no sustain. The traditional Italian term for this articulation is staccato—a term that means short and accented, and which is difficult to replace with an English equivalent. At the other end, a series of pitches might be smoothly connected, with gentle onsets and a great deal of sustain. The term for this articulation is legato. Between these extremes are an enormous variety of approaches to beginning, sustaining, and releasing notes, many of which are unique to the instruments that produce them.\n\nTimbre\n\nThe final characteristic that is universal to all sounds is timbre (TAM-ber), which describes the quality of a sound. Whether one has no musical training or is an accomplished performer, we are all skilled at identifying minor variations in timbre. This ability lets you know that your mother is calling you from the other room, not your sister. It helps you to tell the difference between a guitar and a piano. Not only does every voice and every instrument exhibit a unique timbre, but performers can alter the timbre they produce by changing their technique. Timbre is also integral to genre and style: A symphony orchestra produces one range of timbres, while a rock band produces another.\n\nVariations in timbre are made possible by the existence of the overtone series, which is a sequence of higher-pitched frequencies that are activated every time a pitch is produced. When you strike a key on the piano, for example, you are not only sounding the pitch associated with that key, you are also activating dozens of pitches at set intervals above that pitch, each of which might sound at a relatively high or low volume. The combination of these overtones produces timbre. Two instruments playing the same pitch sound different, therefore, because they are activating different pitches in the overtone series at different volumes. The complexity of this process allows for near-infinite variety in timbres.\n\nPage | 29\n\nRESONANCES\n\nTHE ELEMENTS OF MUSIC\n\nImage 2.2: These are the pitches of the overtone series as they might be notated on a staff. Even if you cannot read notation, you can see that the pitches get closer together as they get higher. When one plays a low C on any instrument, most of these pitches are sounded to some degree. The pitches in blue will be out of tune.\n\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\n\nAttribution: User “Hyacinth”\n\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0\n\nIf you engage with every example in this volume, you will experience an extraordinary range of contrasting timbres. Audiences for various genres develop unique preferences and expectations for timbre, and timbre is often one of the most distinctive characteristics of a musical tradition. Variations in timbre are often not hard to identify: A piano trio, for example, had a different sound quality than a thrash metal band. These differences, however, can be very difficult to put in to words. While timbre is easy to perceive and measure, it is hard to describe.\n\nFor the most part, we will consider timbre in the context of individual examples.\n\nWe will investigate different ways of producing sound with the human voice (which is capable of extraordinary diversity), the various instruments that are responsible for the characteristic sounds of non-Western classical traditions, and the electric instruments and sound processing techniques that have contributed to popular music of the last seventy years. There is one sound source in particular, however, that pervades this volume: the symphony orchestra. For an overview of the instruments that make up the orchestra, please see Appendix A.\n\nTexture\n\nWe are now really to move from sound to music, which usually exhibits some additional characteristics. One of these is texture18, which concerns the contents of and interactions between various layers or voices in a musical work. We use four basic terms to describe texture, although these terms can tell us little about what a piece of music actually sounds like. Monophonic19 music has a single melody\n\nline, performed by a soloist or in unison, with no accompaniment. If you add an accompaniment that has different pitches (probably chords) but that is secondary to the melody, you have homophonic music. In polyphonic music, every voice is independent but equally important, and there is no distinction between melody and harmony. And in heterophonic music, multiple instruments or voices each perform a unique version of the same melody, such that unison is not achieved.\n\nWe will encounter these terms in the context of specific examples throughout this volume.\n\nPage | 30\n\nRESONANCES\n\nTHE ELEMENTS OF MUSIC\n\n18.\n\nThis video introduces the concept of texture.\n\n19.\n\nThis video explores variation in texture.\n\nIn addition, texture can be described using qualitative terms. It can be thick or dense, meaning perhaps that there are many independent and highly-active parts, or it can be thin or sparse, meaning perhaps that there are few instruments, each of which can be clearly identified and tracked. Consider, for example, two songs from Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band, discussed in Chapter 8. The concluding thirty seconds of “Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite” are irrefutably dense: There is so much going on that it is difficult to identify individual sources of sound, and the listener’s focus is constantly attracted by new and varied voices. The first verse of\n\n“A Day in the Life,” on the other hand, has a thin texture, made up only of guitar, bass, and shaker. It is possible to focus on individual instrumental parts and to hear the unique articulation of each.\n\nForm\n\nFinally, we need a way to talk about how music unfolds over time. This element is known as form. Most musical compositions exhibit formal characteristics, although some pieces are very amorphous or difficult to describe in terms of form.\n\nAt the very least, creators of music usually plan the formal dimensions of their work. John Cage’s 4’33” doesn’t have form, per se, since its sonic contents are always different, but at least the composer decided how long the piece was going to last.\n\nIn most cases, the creators of music rely on three organizational principles that produce form. These are repetition, variation, and contrast. Repetition occurs when we hear the same thing twice, whether it is a long and complicated melody, a short melodic fragment, a rhythm, or a harmonic pattern. Variation occurs when musical material returns, but with alterations. Contrast, naturally, refers to musical material that has not been heard before.\n\nRepetition is key to our ability to understand and enjoy music. When we hear something new, internal repetition allows the music to quickly become familiar and helps us to predict what is going to happen next. For this reason, all popular music features repetition of various kinds. When an unfamiliar song comes on the radio, you can expect to hear the chorus (the catchy part with words and melody that both repeat) several times. Most popular songs also have repetitive chord progressions and some sort of repeating accompaniment, known formally as an Page | 31\n\nRESONANCES\n\nTHE ELEMENTS OF MUSIC\n\nostinato20. Ostinatos are important in many types of music and will play a role throughout this book.\n\nThe bass line at the beginning of White Stripe’s “Seven\n\n20.\n\nNation Army” provides a good example of an ostinato. This\n\nseven-note melodic figure is heard throughout the song.\n\nVariation and contrast are what make music interesting. We enjoy and rely upon repetition, but we can only take so much. However, music that contains constant variation or lacks repetition altogether requires more of the listener. Most people cannot relax and enjoy music that is constantly changing and that offers something new and different with each passing moment. At the same time, such music can communicate a great deal and be particularly rewarding for an engaged listener.\n\nThe degree to which music relies on repetition or contrast is often linked to its purpose. Dance music, for example, tends to be repetitive. When people are dancing, they don’t want much contrast. They want the music to maintain a constant tempo, rhythmic character, and mood. Minor variations might make dancing more interesting, but major changes can make dancing impossible. In addition, when you’re dancing you don’t pay careful attention to the nuances of the music. Music belonging to a sung theater tradition, however, is much more likely to exhibit contrast. In the first place, it is probably being used to express emotions or to portray a nuanced character. Variation and contrast allow for more complex and meaningful communication. In the second, audience members are paying full attention to the music, and, therefore, have a higher tolerance for contrast and change.\n\nMUSIC IN THE WORLD\n\nWith the exception of its opening passages, which considered the problem of defining what music even is, this unit has so far emphasized the empirical qualities of music. We have acknowledged the documented effects of music on the human brain, and we have acquired a variety of terms and concepts that can be used to understand and describe music as a physical phenomenon. Now it is time to address some of the messier aspects of talking and writing about music.\n\nCategories\n\nWhat kinds of music do you like to listen to? Country? Hip-hop? Classical?\n\nEDM? Top 40? Whether we are talking to a friend, using a streaming service, or browsing records in a store, we like to think about music in terms of categories.\n\nThese categories can be very useful. They can help us pick a radio station we might enjoy, or decide whether or not to buy tickets to hear an unfamiliar band. At the same time, these categories are both artificial and extremely limiting.\n\nPage | 32\n\nRESONANCES\n\nTHE ELEMENTS OF MUSIC\n\nLet us begin by considering the classic tripartite division of music into the categories of “classical,” “popular,” and “folk.” This approach has been around for a long time, and it has persevered because, in many ways, it works. If I tell you that I like “classical” music, you immediately understand that I probably mean orchestral music, or opera, and that I probably listen to music that is fairly old. But there are problems with this categorization. To begin with, much of what is\n\n“classical” today was “popular” in the past. When Mozart wrote his symphonies, for example, his object was to satisfy popular demand and sell concert tickets, and his audiences behaved the same way that fans at a rock concert do today. And what if I actually prefer experimental orchestral music composed last year? It is common practice to refer to such repertoire as “classical,” but it’s about as far from Mozart as you can get.\n\nImage 2.3: “Classical” music is usually associated with certain performance conventions, including formal dress, music reading, and standard ensembles such as the orchestra and choir pictured here, but none of these are essential.\n\nSource: Pexels\n\nAttribution: Pixabay\n\nLicense: Pexels License\n\nHow about “popular” music? This category is generally understood to contain commercial music that appeals to large numbers of people. But what about individual artists or songs that fail to achieve any popularity whatsoever? What about experimental rock bands that take the same attitude towards their work as serious “classical” composers? Mozart, a “classical” composer, might have more in common with a “popular” artist like Jimi Hendrix than Hendrix has in common with Pink Floyd. Mozart and Hendrix were both gifted instrumentalists who Page | 33\n\nRESONANCES\n\nTHE ELEMENTS OF MUSIC\n\ndazzled their audiences with virtuosic performances and wrote music to showcase their skills, while the band Pink Floyd is known more for their nuanced production, complex song structures, and unusual instrumentation. Again, however, this category is not without its value. While there is an enormous diversity of “popular”\n\nmusics, they tend to be characterized by certain forms, instrumentations, styles, and performance venues. There might be much to separate Jimi Hendrix and Pink Floyd, but their music shares important elements of instrumentation and style, and it might be heard in the same types of settings.\n\n“Folk” is also a slippery category. “Folk” music is typically described as music of unknown authorship that is passed down from generation to generation in a particular region. It tends to be fairly simple and in a distinctive style, and it is performed on instruments that are\n\nintegral to the local musical culture.\n\nHowever, problems quickly arise as we\n\ntry to label individual pieces or practices.\n\nIn the United States, for example, the\n\nworks of Stephen Foster have long been\n\nconsidered folk music. Songs like “My\n\nOld Kentucky Home” and “Camptown\n\nRaces” have certainly entered folk culture,\n\nand many who sing or play them know\n\nnothing of their composer or origin.\n\nBut can a commercial song, created and\n\npublished by a professional composer,\n\ntruly be considered “folk” music? Different\n\nproblems arise as we address the musical\n\npractices of non-Western societies,\n\nmany of which do not employ musical Image 2.4: Woody Guthrie, notation and reject notions of individual pictured here in 1943, is an icon authorship. But do the absence of a of American folk music. However, he mostly performed songs that he\n\nnamed composer, official sheet music, and himself wrote and had a successful copyright notice mean that a work in the commercial career—characteristics North Indian classical tradition is “folk” that put him more in line with\n\n“popular” musicians.\n\nmusic? The complexity, sophistication, Source: Wikimedia Commons and technical demands of music in this Attribution: Al Aumuller category would suggest not.\n\nLicense: Public Domain\n\nA further challenge arises when we try\n\nto identify the “folk” music of a region or nation. Let us take the United States. If I tell you that I listen to American folk music, you will probably imagine someone like Joan Baez playing guitar and singing songs from the Anglo folk tradition.\n\nIndeed, music such as hers has come to be known as Folk music (with a capital F).\n\nIf I ask Spotify to play Folk music for me, I’ll hear Joan Baez and others like her.\n\nHowever, her music represents only one cultural strain within the United States.\n\nPage | 34\n\nRESONANCES\n\nTHE ELEMENTS OF MUSIC\n\nWhat about the polka music of midwestern communities? What about the corrido ballads of Spanish-speaking communities near the southern border? What about the dance music heard at Native American pow-pow gatherings? Are any of these traditions less “folk” or less “American” than the others?\n\nFor all the reasons explored above, this narrative is going to steer clear of\n\n“classical,” “popular,” and “folk” as categories and terms. They have been addressed here only because their use is so widespread. Instead, we will focus on what music across these categories shares in common: the purposes for which individual works were originally created and continue to be consumed. This book is organized around categories, but these categories have little to do with the style of the works contained therein. Instead, they have to do with the roles music plays in society.\n\nThese categories lead us to first understand what music is for. Only then will we seek to address how the music works, who created it, and how it is rooted in its historical and cultural context.\n\nThese categories also have their shortcomings. Many musical examples included in a given category could just as easily be included in another. We will admit that at the outset. All the same, these categories seem more useful than\n\n“classical,” “popular,” and “folk,” and they tell us much more about what really matters: music as an integral aspect of the human experience.\n\nGenres and Subgenres\n\nThis book will engage with another mode of categorization: genre. Genre is a way of making connections between closely-related works and musical artists that share stylistic, formal, and cultural\n\nelements. You are sure to recognize a\n\nlarge number of genres—rock, pop, R&B,\n\ncountry, hip-hop—from your own musical\n\nconsumption. Each of these genre names\n\ntells us something about what the music is\n\nlike and who listens to it. Each also hosts\n\na variety of subgenres that communicate\n\nmore specialized information about the\n\nImage 2.5: Genre is primarily a\n\nmusic contained therein. For example,\n\nmarketing tool. Customers in this\n\nthe genre EDM (electronic dance music)\n\nstore can easily find the music they\n\nare likely to be interested in because\n\ncontains all computer-produced music\n\nthe recordings are organized by\n\nintended primarily for dancing, whereas\n\ngenre.\n\nthe subgenre dubstep contains only bass-\n\nSource: NeedPix\n\nAttribution: User “StockSnap”\n\nheavy EDM that uses specific timbres, is\n\nLicense: CC0\n\nin duple meter, and falls within a narrow\n\ntempo range. The label “dubstep” also\n\ngives us a clearer picture of who consumes the music and what a concert might be like. Finally, subgenres tend to come and go, each leading to the next, while genres remain relevant for longer periods of time.\n\nPage | 35\n\nRESONANCES\n\nTHE ELEMENTS OF MUSIC\n\nIt is important to acknowledge that genre in the 21st century is primarily a marketing tool. The main purpose of genre is to help record companies efficiently label their merchandise, identify consumers, and advertise music to the people who are most likely to buy it. Genre also helps the music industry to track sales; consider the Billboard music charts, which have been in use since 1958. Of course, genre is meaningful to consumers as well, and subgenres are often named not by faceless corporations but by the fans themselves. Genre can also help listeners to find music that they will enjoy, and it can serve to create communities of listeners and concertgoers.\n\nAt the same time, genre can be\n\ndivisive. Historically, genre has been used\n\nto separate black and white performing\n\nartists whose music was stylistically\n\nidentical. This happened in the 1920s,\n\nwhen the marketing categories of “race\n\nrecords” and “hillbilly records” were\n\ninvented to segregate the music of black\n\nand white Southern musicians, and\n\nagain in the 1950s, when the distinction\n\nbetween performers of R&B and rock ‘n’\n\nroll was often one of race. It is important,\n\ntherefore, to be critical of genre, and to\n\nrepeatedly assess exactly what genre is\n\ntelling us.\n\nIndeed, genre can convey a wide\n\nvariety of types of information, but not\n\nall genres convey the same types of\n\ninformation. Let’s look at two examples: Image 2.6: This is the cover for a Victor “race records” catalog\n\n“string quartet” and “French reggae.” published in the 1920s. Various “race”\n\nThe former provides us with precise genres are listed at the bottom.\n\ninformation about instrumentation (two Source: Wikimedia Commons Attribution: Unknown\n\nviolins, viola, and cello) and suggests a License: Public Domain multi-part concert work intended for the\n\nstimulation of players and listeners. We might also make assumptions about the consumer of such a genre, who is probably (although not always) well-educated and reasonably well-off, and we might expect to hear performances in a formal concert hall, surrounded by well-dressed and attentive listeners. However, genre in this case tells us nothing at all about style, geographical origin, historical context, or social significance. A work in this genre might have been composed in 1780, or 1880, or 1980, or yesterday. Although the string quartet originated in German-speaking Europe, this genre has been accessible to composers, performers, and listeners across the globe for at least the past one hundred years. A string quartet might be pleasant and lyrical, or dissonant and jarring. It might be fairly simple or Page | 36\n\nRESONANCES\n\nTHE ELEMENTS OF MUSIC\n\nmind-bogglingly complex. It might last eight minutes, or eighty minutes. And genre provides us no idea about what sort of meaning—political, social, or otherwise—\n\nmight be contained in such a work.\n\nThe case is quite different with “French reggae.” On the one hand, this genre tells us less about instrumentation. We can expect to hear certain instruments—\n\nelectric guitar, electric bass, drums, and perhaps electric organ, trumpet, and saxophone—but taking away or adding instruments does not fundamentally destabilize the genre. On the other, it tells us much more about everything else.\n\nFirst and foremost, the “reggae” designation tells us all we need to know about style, which is a core identifying feature of the genre. It also limits the scope of time and place. Reggae has only been around since the late 1960s, and it was developed in Jamaica by Rastafarians—a nation and culture that are central to the genre’s identity no matter where individual songs might come from. The subgenre identification of “French reggae” tells us even more about geographic location and language. Finally, reggae carries certain political, social, and racial connotations. It is usually performed by musicians of African descent, and it often espouses ideals of pan-African unity and social justice. These values in turn help us to understand how and why people consume the music, and how French reggae might become an integral part of someone’s identity.\n\nFixed Composition vs. Improvisation\n\nThe two genres just discussed exhibit an additional pair of features that require deeper discussion: string quartets tend to be fixed compositions, such that the pitches and rhythms in every performance are identical, while reggae invites improvisation and variation from performance to performance, such that two renditions of the same song might sound quite different. In a tradition that relies on fixed composition, it is assumed that the creator of a work will m"
