        "text": "“No, it wasn’t the airplanes. It was Beauty killed the Beast.”\n\nIn 1931, a young David O. Selznick at RKO Pictures hired Merian C. Cooper to make feature films that would resemble the documentaries that Cooper had made with his producer-director partner Ernest Schoedsack, like Chang and Rango, which featured monkeys in jungles sometimes threatening humans. A racist mockumentary film called Ingagi, which implied that black women and gorillas had procreated, was a 1930 hit that proved that apes plus vulnerable women equaled profits. Cooper and Schoedsack began a film they called The Most Dangerous Game, building an enormous jungle set and casting actors that would play humans being hunted by monkeys. Cooper also looked at footage from another RKO film then in production, called Creation, about a group of travelers shipwrecked on an island of dinosaurs. Cooper, along with Selznick and RKO, decided that neither project really worked but…and just stay with me for a minute here…what if you combined them?\n\nCombining them meant creating a gorilla big enough to fight with dinosaurs, which led to another idea: wouldn’t such a monster be any American zoo’s most prized attraction? One issue with stories like The Most Dangerous Game and Creation is that they took place in remote jungles; why not find a way to threaten Americans where they lived? And in that case, why not underline the contrast between savagery and civilization by bringing the story right up to the minute, with a climactic scene at the brand-new symbol of American progress and ingenuity, the Empire State Building, and an expedition and extraction storyline motivated by none other than avaricious, sensationalist Hollywood filmmakers? The Depression-starved Ann Darrow character could almost be read as a proxy for the audiences that surprisingly showed up for Dracula and Frankenstein; Ann is so desperate and fearful, she’s willing to pay to scream. Someone somewhere may have worried that a story with so many contemporary references might have eventually seemed too dated, too locked in 1933; but the eventual result, King Kong, turned out to be a timeless inspiration for countless other films.\n\nKing Kong also drew inspiration, and staff, from a 1925 silent film called The Lost World, based on Arthur Conan Doyle’s 1912 novel of the same name. It featured Doyle himself in a short prologue in which he calls the film’s hero, Professor Challenger, his favorite of his own creations, even above Sherlock Holmes. In the movie, from which Steven Spielberg later appropriated the name and plot, Professor Challenger and his team battle dinosaurs, which were rendered by a brand-new process later called stop-motion animation. Basically, the effects team shot a clay figurine onto a frame image of actors, and then stopped, moved the figurine a tiny bit, and then shot the figurine onto the next frame of footage. If you’re lucky and good, you could maybe do one such shot every five minutes, which means, if the film has been shot at 24 frames per second, it would take you two hours to get one second’s worth of dinosaur on film. King Kong’s effects department wound up getting more than 15 minutes of stop-motion animation into their film, led by The Lost World’s Willis O’Brien. The film also relied heavily on rear-screen projection, in which actors walk in front of pre-shot footage, as well as using stop-motion alongside matte paintings and miniatures, and in so doing King Kong set the standard for the modern special-effects-driven blockbuster.\n\nWhile Frankenstein features almost no music, King Kong pioneered cinematic music, being the first film to feature more than an hour of original, never-before-heard music. Max Steiner composed different themes for different characters, inspiring everyone from Prokofiev, who wrote Peter and the Wolf shortly after seeing King Kong, to John Williams and beyond. Even if studios like MGM and Paramount would never make a film like King Kong, they were happy to hire Steiner, who became the foremost film composer of his generation.\n\nThe script for King Kong was almost sui generis, a sort of 20th-century Beauty and the Beast allegory about the destructive powers of both love and civilization. King Kong was rewritten by Schoedsack’s wife, Ruth Rose, who cut much of the plodding exposition and made the three lead humans, Denham, Driscoll, and Darrow, into humorous, self-aware versions of Cooper, Schoedsack, and herself, respectively. The story was arguably its own kind of Frankenstein’s monster, combining the best and shortened parts of the discarded movies into a plot that many have read as commentary on colonialism and slavery importation. The location of Skull Island is vaguely part of Western Oceania, but the tribal rituals and the tribesmen that we first see on Skull Island seem entirely African. If King Kong represents, consciously or unconsciously, a captured brown slave, what are we to make of his obsession with the white blonde often-screaming Ann Darrow? Feel free to go down the rabbit hole of internet theories; perhaps that’s appropriate to the rabbit-fur on the stop-motion models for Kong. (No actor ever wore a gorilla suit in the original film.) Martin Scorsese would later say that the animal fur combined with O’Brien’s movements “gave him a soul.” It may have been beauty killed the beast, but it was the filmmakers who arguably created the first American Hollywood epic myth. Dracula and Frankenstein are European stories; King Kong is closer to a classic American immigrant; together, the three of them set the standard for all future creature features, and much horror and science fiction.\n\nInfluenced by: nature expedition documentaries, The Lost World (1925), Ingagi (1930), Rango (1931), Universal horror pictures\n\nInfluenced: the Willis O’Brien/Ray Harryhausen school of effects; large-scale horror/fantasy/sci-fi films\n\n“Yes, sir, she is a little bit savage, I think.”\n\nFilms like the Broncho Billy and Tom Mix serials, featuring a lot of white hat-wearing cowboys riding easily to the rescue, had considerably cheapened the western genre by the time Haycox’s story “The Stage to Lordsburg” appeared in 1937. Ford and Nichols saw in Haycox’s story a chance to pivot to something Depression-era audiences might appreciate, fiercely independent outcasts thrown together on a journey across unforgiving lands, to find or make a new America. Let Walt Disney have his Snow White and seven dwarfs; Ford and Nichols’ treacherous stagecoach ride would shove together a prostitute and seven rogues: a drunk doctor, a whisky salesman, a bitter Confederate “gentleman,” a shifty marshal, an angry guard, a pious blueblood, and a fugitive. John Ford hadn’t made a western since the silent era, and he didn’t want this one to look or feel anything he or anyone had done; he would use long shadows, moody lighting, and unprecedented location shooting in Monument Valley – in other words, an A-picture, not a low-budget B-picture. But no studio wanted to give Ford the money for an A-picture – after all, Ford hadn’t made a western since the silent era, and no one had made a particularly great one since.\n\nLucky for Ford that Chaplin and Griffith had founded United Artists two decades before, because United Artists could distribute a film from an independent producer willing to put up the money. That eventual producer, Walter Wanger, almost walked away over Ford’s insistence on a relatively unknown actor in the lead, but Wanger eventually agreed to finance the film, retitled Stagecoach, at about half the budget Ford wanted. That unknown actor, John Wayne, is actually terrific in Stagecoach as the Ringo Kid, a prison escapee who falls in love with the wrong woman while plotting revenge on the men who have killed his brothers. Here John Ford made a star of John Wayne, and the 24 films they eventually made together may represent the most successful and influential star-director partnership in American cinema.\n\nAt one stagecoach stop, the snobby blueblood woman and the Confederate veteran walk away in a huff from the lowly Ringo Kid and Dallas. Stagecoach is careful not to actually call Dallas a prostitute, but in the first scene a sneering Ladies Club leaves little doubt as to the reason they want Dallas out of their respectable town. Ringo joins the stage late, fails to learn Dallas’ reputation, and midway through the ride proposes marriage to her. No doubt Joseph Breen watched Stagecoach with bated breath to see what would become of their romance; the Production Code was clear that low virtue could never be rewarded. As Dallas, Claire Trevor acts for most of the film like she knows the Code all too well, certain that Ringo will leave her when they arrive at their destination and he learns who she really is. In the final scene (spoiler alert), Ringo accepts her as she is with a hug – the Code prevented a loving kiss to a prostitute – followed by the Marshal and the doctor surprising them by sending them both across the border as the credits roll. Technically, this sort of happily-ever-after might have been seen as rewarding vice, but perhaps Ford and Nichols were relying on Breen’s racial biases to see Mexico as the opposite of paradise. They got their seal.\n\nThe film became notorious for reifying other racial biases. At one stagecoach stop, the whiskey salesman sees an Apache woman and blurts to the Mexican man pouring him a drink that his apparent consort is a savage, and he replies, “Si, she is a little bit savage, I think.” He notes that her Apache status affords him protection against nearby Apache warriors just before she sings a heart-rending song. If the film had left off there, historians might have given Ford credit for relatively enlightened representation…but a later scene suggests that the “savage” scene merely set up a much cruder caricature. All along, the stage riders fear an Apache attack, and when it comes in a gangbusters setpiece, the aggressive Native Americans are rendered as faceless, honorless villains. Perhaps Ford didn’t mean to otherize Indians, or perhaps Ford was letting his Birth of a Nation flag fly. Indeed, the effects of the films were comparable. Stagecoach countered Hollywood’s many positive representations of indigenous people in the 20s and 30s, and repositioned Indians as savage bad guys at the same moment that the film brought the cinematic western into A-picture status over the following decades.\n\nInfluenced by: the Western genre from pulp fiction to 1930s relic\n\nInfluenced: most Westerns and many other notable films (Orson Welles said that to direct Citizen Kane, he watched Stagecoach 30 times)\n\n“With the thoughts I’d be thinkin’, I could be another Lincoln, if I only had a brain.”\n\nStudents are often surprised to learn that the 1939 version of The Wizard of Oz is the fourth filmed version of L. Frank Baum’s novel from 1900, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. What changed? In a word, commitment. Knowing full well that a rival was then making the extravagant Gone with the Wind, Louis B. Mayer and MGM strongly committed to Baum’s story, to the sets, to the actors, and to making new songs. After Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs succeeded beyond anyone’s expectations, Mayer searched for a similar property that he might adapt into a colorful live-action musical. Mayer found a wicked witch challenging a lost ingenue, her beloved animal friends, and dwarfs, ahem, munchkins. If Disney could make a small fortune with seven little people, Mayer would bring out more than a hundred of them.\n\nPerhaps Mayer’s smartest move was to delegate the minutiae of production, as he had during the Thalberg years. The final decisions on The Wizard of Oz were apparently made by Mervyn LeRoy and Victor Fleming, although this is controversial amongst scholars; at least 11 writers worked on the script, and as Salman Rushdie put it, the various later claims to authorship bring the film close to what Rushdie called “ that will-o’-the-wisp of modern critical theory: the authorless text.” I cannot recommend Rushdie’s book-length essay on The Wizard of Oz highly enough; it should be the first book you give to skeptics who claim that any film analysis is worthless. Coming from a tradition of many gods, Rushdie marvels at the film’s “joyful and almost total secularism,” at a land where witches and a wizard are feared but not worshiped or sanctified. He credits the film’s “absence of higher values” for its successful, ahem, lionization of the loves, cares, and needs of humans and human-like characters. Rushdie’s biggest issue with the film is that if you travel from a parched, mean, black-and-white farmland to a full-color fairyland where almost everyone treats you like a princess, “there’s no place like home” seems almost atonal. I would counter that like a lot of films and fairy tales, The Wizard of Oz has specific appeals to diametrically opposed audiences, in this case to travelers and homebodies.\n\nThe Wizard of Oz is as close to an American fairy tale as anyone has come. Almost every other well-known fairy tale is set in Europe; many things about The Wizard of Oz derive from an idiosyncratically American imagination, not least its white girl reimagining and fast-befriending her neighbors as non-white persons. Henry Littlefield claimed that Baum’s readers of 1900 understood the story as a satire of the capital-P Populists, then at their apex as the most successful third party in U.S. History, with Dorothy-slash-Kansas signifying the epicenter of Populism, the Scarecrow as farmers, the Tin Man as manufacturers, the Cowardly Lion as their feckless sometimes-leader William Jennings Bryan, the Munchkins as, well, the little people of common American discourse, the yellow brick road as the suspicious gold standard leading to a Potemkin-village Emerald City led by a wizard, signifying industrial capitalism, who turns out to be humbug. He’s so humbug that he hangs a cheap Cross of Gold on the figure who famously said mankind would not be hung on a Cross of Gold, William Jennings…Lion.\n\nFilm viewers don’t really absorb much of this, but Bruno Bettleheim’s work on fairy tales shows that children sense subtexts about historic and primal conflicts; in this case, it’s at least obvious that a powerful man has been humbled as women have asserted their power. But the fairy tale of the film The Wizard of Oz is deeper than that and can’t quite be presented in a book or reproduced now, in the same way that a new Bugs Bunny cartoon can never fool you into thinking it’s a classic from the 1940s. The timing, gestures, and even breathing of the actors in The Wizard of Oz is ineffably bound to Hollywood in the 1930s. The Wizard of Oz, by the way, didn’t do badly in 1939, but its status as an American classic, by some measures the most-seen film of all time, only came after it began airing on television in the 1950s. For reasons I’ll address later, by the 50s even Disney films looked a lot shabbier than they did in the late 1930s. The Wizard of Oz caught lightning in a bottle partly because it never feels cheap in any sense, including emotionally. In some ways only comparable to King Kong, The Wizard of Oz comes to us as a singular fairy tale of Classical Hollywood itself; we imagine ourselves making and helping lifelong friends on repurposed MGM sets while singing original songs that instantly become classics.\n\nOne cannot overestimate the effect of songs, written by Edgar “Yip” Harburg and Harold Arlen, like “Ding Dong! The Witch is Dead,” “We’re Off to See the Wizard,” “If I Only Had a Brain,” and “Lions and Tigers and Bears, Oh My.” This music infuses the movie with unusual bonhomie, playfulness and whimsy. Recall that in the 1930s, no feature films were made only for children; they were instead made for everyone. The Wizard of Oz evinces an exquisite balance between the juvenile and the mature, probably best represented by Judy Garland’s exquisite performance of Dorothy, navigating a yellow brick road between innocence and gravitas. Rushdie writes, and he’s not wrong, that when Garland sings “Somewhere Over the Rainbow,” she gives the movie its soul. The song is perfect for a post-Code feminist: Dorothy achingly wants more, but ultimately seems happy with less. We remember Dorothy for her power partly because she is so respected; other than the wizard before we learn of his humbug, no one, not even the Wicked Witch, condescends to her in any way.\n\nInfluenced by: 1890s politics (in the original novel), Snow White (convinced MGM to spend $3m)\n\nInfluenced: for generations of kids, often the first “gateway drug” to great cinema\n\n“As God is my witness, I’ll never go hungry again.”\n\nNo other film can boast as famous a process, from the thousand-plus actresses who auditioned to play Scarlett O’Hara to the thousands of pounds of red clay shipped from Georgia to Los Angeles to the dozens of dormant sets burned to signify General Sherman’s razing of Atlanta to the four A-list directors who were hired by, fought bitterly with, and fired by, producer David O. Selznick. Victor Fleming is the film’s credited director, and some have written that when you add that to his director credit on The Wizard of Oz, Fleming’s one-year accomplishment rises above that of other directors with a two-masterpiece year like Francis Ford Coppola in 1974 and Steven Spielberg in 1993. Yet if Gone with the Wind has an author, it’s Selznick, who made all the final decisions on GWTW in his determination to disprove Irving Thalberg’s famous almost-last words to Louis B. Mayer to explain why MGM would be passing on adapting Mitchell’s 1936 hit novel, “no Civil War picture ever made a nickel.”\n\nToday’s students tend to notice that America’s two most important pre-World War II blockbusters, The Birth of a Nation and Gone with the Wind, are not only big hit Civil War pictures but also promote Lost Cause mythology, whereby the racist, secessionist Southern rebels of the 1860s are reconfigured as just and heroic. (Even Jefferson Smith’s big speech pays homage to Lost Causes, and it’s not clear if he meant to include Confederates.)\n\nGone with the Wind is about Scarlett O’Hara, magnificently performed by Vivien Leigh, the headstrong daughter of a Georgia plantation owner played by Thomas Mitchell in an Irish brogue strong enough to reassure the audience that the O’Haras are not Old Money. Scarlett seems to wish they were, based on her wardrobe and her desire to wrest the blueblood patrician Ashley from her friend Melanie, but finds herself courted by the more industrious, more mercenary Rhett Butler, played wryly by Clark Gable, just as the Civil War breaks out. In some ways Rhett is this story’s smart outsider compared to the blinkered Southerners, but the film follows Scarlett as she travels from their plantation, called Tara, to help the wounded in Atlanta as the war turns calamitous for the South. Tara and Atlanta go, with the wind, from Southern elegance to scorched earth. Despite General Sherman burning a swath of Georgia to the ground, Tara’s black slaves remain dutifully loyal to the O’Haras, perhaps partly because some of them make terrible mistakes, as when Prissy, played by Butterfly McQueen, fails to deliver on her promises of midwifery. Malcolm X would later comment that McQueen’s shrill, vexatious performance set black people back twenty years.\n\nAs regressive as Gone with the Wind was, Selznick could have made it worse. Destitute from the war, Scarlett starts her own business, and in the novel, in Margaret Mitchell’s words, “The negroes insisted on being paid every day and they frequently got drunk on their wages and did not turn up for work the next morning.” Scarlett is furious. “And she would never fool with free triggers again,” only Mitchell wrote a word that rhymes with “triggers.” Around this point onscreen, Scarlett rides her buggy through a shanty-town, gets attacked, and is saved by her former slave Big Sam. After a vengeful posse breaks up the shanty, Rhett artfully lies to the Yankee authorities, but the movie is telling a bigger lie: in the book, our sympathetic posse is part of the Ku Klux Klan. The point is that Gone with the Wind could have been worse for black people, but it was awful enough, especially considering Scarlett O’Hara spent decades as something of a role model for white women. This is deeply problematic even when you attempt to factor out race: after Rhett and Scarlett marry, he commits marital rape, from which Scarlett wakes up the next day as though it was just what she needed all along.\n\nAll that very much said, some, like Thomas Cripps, have argued that the film somewhat normalized aspects of white-black allyship, leading to the non-production of scripts that were actually more racist. The film remains compulsively watchable, and it provided some permanent aspects of popular culture, as when Scarlett vows that she’ll do what she has to as long as “I’ll never be hungry again,” or when Scarlett asks what she will do if Rhett is really leaving her for good and he answers, “Frankly, my dear, I don’t give a damn.” (Strictly speaking, “damn” was forbidden by the Code, but apparently Breen gave less of a damn at the end of an almost-four-hour film.) Gone with the Wind was nominated for a then-record 12 Academy Awards and won 8, including the first Oscar won by an African-American, for Hattie McDaniel’s bravura performance as Mammy. The most significant legacy of Gone with the Wind’s sweeping set-pieces and melodramatic flourishes, at least in Hollywood, were that they served as the ur-model for the epic blockbuster in the 1950s, when Hollywood felt keen competition from television and responded by mounting many melodrama-driven spectacles.\n\nInfluenced by: updated Lost Cause mythology, Margaret Mitchell’s Atlanta upbringing (the novel), David O.

Honest, you’re a grand old flag!”\n\nThe idea of a George M. Cohan biopic had been kicking around for a few years but World War II gave the story of Cohan a framing device – the actor playing Cohan would play wartime president Franklin Roosevelt, would go backstage to meet the real FDR, would flash back on his life, and then, at the end of the film, would join a parade of Americans mobilizing for war singing “Over There” ending with the refrain, “and we won’t come back till it’s over, over there.” This was a song written by Cohan for the First World War and made popular then, and its 1942 revival was almost suspiciously well-timed. It turns out that Curtiz was bitter about being wounded fighting for Hungary in the First World War, not that you’d sense his ambivalence while watching Yankee Doodle Dandy. That particular feeling would wait for his next movie.\n\nYankee Doodle Dandy was more evidence of how much of Classical Hollywood, to quote another one of Cohan’s songs, “gave its regards to Broadway.” Perhaps ironically, the first real musical on the chronologically ordered AFI 100 technically wasn’t a Broadway show; Yankee Doodle Dandy was instead an original script about “The Man Who Owned Broadway” that sampled from Tin Pan Alley shows and revues. After Yankee Doodle Dandy, Hollywood would do well with other stitched-together revue films like Ziegfeld Follies. But it also helped make the more integrated production of Meet Me in St. Louis into a loving tribute to pre-World War I Missouri. The press around Gone with the Wind had demonstrated that there were apparently hundreds of living Americans who saw Sherman’s burning of Atlanta with their own eyes, and so Hollywood was keen to mine any extant nostalgia for America’s next chapter, the Gilded Age of gazebo-bound ice cream socials and such, as seen in both of Orson Welles first two films, and in Curtiz’s affectionate re-creations of fin-de-siecle New York in Yankee Doodle Dandy. For this film, Curtiz was lucky to get James Wong Howe as his director of photography, whose intuition with tracking in and out of framing shots matched Curtiz’s own.\n\nProduction on Yankee Doodle Dandy in early 1942 was a little rushed, not because anyone thought the new war would end anytime soon, but because George M. Cohan was still alive, and Warner Bros. wanted to premiere it before he died. There was one tiny issue: Cohan didn’t like Warners’ first choice for the role, James Cagney, and Cagney didn’t like Cohan. Cohan was not only a writer but also a skilled song-and-dance-man, and wanted to be played by the most graceful dancer of the age, or maybe any age, Fred Astaire, who did resemble Cohan more than Cagney. Warners offered the role to Astaire, who turned it down because he didn’t want to dance in Cohan’s signature stiff-legged, puppet-like manner. Cagney had resented Cohan for siding against striking actors in a 1919 Equity dispute. Two decades later, in 1940, a Communist ringleader tried to reduce his sentence by naming stars as Communists; the New York Times put the accusation against Cagney on its front page, apparently causing one producer of Yankee Doodle Dandy, William Cagney, to tell his brother, “we’re going to have to make the goddamndest patriotic picture that’s ever been made. I think it’s the Cohan story.”\n\nJimmy Cagney might have done it anyway. Ever since he exploded onto the scene a decade earlier as Tom Powers in The Public Enemy, studios had promoted him as a gangster type, and he wanted more people to know he was also a skilled song-and-dance man. Just as Fonda and Stewart were in a sense coming for Gary Cooper’s persona, Bogart and John Garfield were now coming for Cagney’s, and so he needed a Sergeant York-size hit. Cagney also related to Cohan as an Irish-American in more ways than one, including Cohan’s half-singing, half-chatting vocal style. Cagney’s go-for-broke energy is one of three things that separates Yankee Doodle Dandy from, say, The Pride of the Yankees; the other two being the music and Curtiz’s directorial style. Jack and Harry Warner hired Curtiz in 1926 because he focused on actors when a scene demanded it, which is at least half the running time of most pictures, but also because he knew how to deploy Expressionistic touches. By 1942 these traits joined with his fluid camera and restless editing to make films that still seem modern today, causing Curtiz to tell one writer on his next picture, “Don’t worry what’s logical, I make it go so fast no one notices.” Yankee Doodle Dandy isn’t above certain biopic clichés, for example the standard longtime helpmeet partner who is a composite of Cohan’s two wives, Cohan’s divorce from the first utterly elided. But Yankee Doodle Dandy was mostly a heart-pounding, heart-stopping heart-warmer that became a smash hit. Cohan approved of Cagney, and the Academy even awarded him Best Actor, an honorarium Cohan didn’t quite live to see. Once scheduled to debut on July 4th, 1942, the film premiered on May 29th to make sure the ailing Cohan could attend and promote it. As it happened, Cohan finally shuffled off this mortal coil on November 5th. One thinks of the final shot of Yankee Doodle Dandy, as Cagney-as-Cohan joins a spontaneous parade of people singing “Over There, over there,” and one asks: as Cohan died, did he think about how many American soldiers he got to go over there?\n\nInfluenced by: Cohan’s life, friends, opinions (Cohan was still alive)\n\nInfluenced: what America thought of the pre-1914 period\n\n“I’m no good at being noble, but it doesn’t take much to see that the problems of three little people don’t amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world.”\n\nCasablanca began as an unproduced play called Everybody Goes to Rick’s, written by a married American couple who had vacationed in Austria and France in the late 1930s and visited at least one large café full of refugees and exiles. Their story was about an avowedly apolitical owner of a Moroccan café named Rick who comes into possession of two letters of transit desperately needed by an anti-fascist gadfly and his wife – who happens to be Rick’s former lover. Warner Brothers’ story editor Irene Diamond convinced production head Hal B. Wallis to buy the script for $20,000 in January 1942, which he retitled Casablanca partly because it was one of the only Moroccan cities he’d heard of, partly because Algiers worked as a 1938 movie’s title, and he would pitch this as a wartime Algiers, with something like that film’s exotic mystery and smoke and shadows. For this he got the same DP he put on Maltese Falcon for the same reason, Arthur Edeson. For one final time, Humphrey Bogart happily took a part that George Raft turned down. Wallis wanted a more luminous Ilsa than anyone under contract at Warners, and after David O. Selznick heard the new film would be like Algiers, he agreed to loan Wallis Ingrid Bergman, but only for two months. On August 1st Bergman would start shooting For Whom the Bell Tolls with Gary Cooper based on the Hemingway novel about the Spanish Civil War, Warners not being the only studio in ’42 keenly interested in pre-Pearl Harbor-period dramas between the committed and the uncommitted. But there was a tiny problem with the screenplay that Robert McKee would later teach to thousands, maybe millions, as the greatest script ever put on celluloid: when Curtiz and Edeson’s cameras began rolling at the end of May 1942, it was only half-written.\n\nNot that Wallis hadn’t tried. The original play’s second half was considered far too melodramatic and corny, and the script went through at least a half-dozen contract writers. Two of the three whose names wound up on the onscreen credits, twin brothers Julius and Philip Epstein, wrote a draft, left for D.C. to help Frank Capra with war propaganda, then came back to alter what Wallis and Curtiz then had. The third onscreen name, Howard Koch, had a history that runs through this podcast, adapting the version of War of the Worlds that Orson Welles had scared America with, moving to Hollywood and getting picked up at L.A.’s Union Station by John Huston, and then writing the funnier parts of Yankee Doodle Dandy. Dialogue like “I came to Casablanca for the waters,” “There are no waters in Casablanca,” “I was misinformed” has Koch’s signature wry style. (Koch would later be blacklisted for Communist leanings.) But shooting a film with half a script is every producer’s nightmare, and Bergman kept asking every lead creative, “who gets me at the end, Paul or Bogie?” Perhaps some of the film’s continuing life comes from the fact that for most of the shoot, no one on set had any idea how the story would end.\n\nCurtiz and Wallis deserve credit less for a Welles-like independence from the studio system and more for a perfect manipulation of it. We feel the verve and spirit of Rick’s Café through the music, and much of that is from Max Steiner, who from King Kong through Gone with the Wind had established himself as Hollywood’ pre-eminent scorer. Casablanca is one of those rare films where audiences become equally invested in the leads and the ensemble. In terms of the leads, Paul Henreid considered the project beneath him, and only took the part of Laszlo on condition that his name be billed above the title with Bogart and Bergman’s, The Philadelphia Story having established the precedent that the third-billed actor on the poster could even win a Lead Actor Oscar, but Henreid’s diffidence suits the role. Bergman as Ilsa, like Hepburn as Tracy Lord, is the best actor in any scene, and makes “Here’s looking at you, kid” sound like the reason cinema exists; she is irreplaceably luminous, or as Roger Ebert put it, she paints Bogart with her eyes. Bogart as Rick makes believable the transition from “I stick my neck out for nobody” to idealism, and in so doing changes the Hollywood ideal from a man who gives up everything for love to one who gives up love for, well, everything we need when people like Nazis threaten humanity.\n\nBut the cast is unimaginable without Warner Bros’ brand built around the deviant and guttural; Conrad Veidt, the smooth Nazi colonel, was once the zombie in Caligari, Peter Lorre, the creepy Ugarte, was once the serial killer in M, and Claude Rains, the shrewd Renault, was once the Invisible Man, and they all had to do Casablanca because of long-term studio contracts that we now recognize as something like indentured servitude. After Rick and the African-American Sam, the next nine credited characters are these nationalities: Norwegian, Czechoslovakian, French Moroccan, German, British (with an Italian name, Ferrari), whatever Ugarte is, Bulgarian, Russian, and French. Audience members want Rick’s to be preserved because of its United Nations-like qualities, even though the film certainly should have cast more actual Arabic Moroccans. Hungarian Jew Curtiz didn’t challenge the studios and instead upheld their usual elision of race, but in this film he also provided enough white diversity for us to think of Rick the way we think of the Statue of Liberty: as a dignified convener of a concatenation of different, freedom-loving exiles and refugees.\n\nAfter committing to paper roughly five different possible endings involving Rick, Ilsa, Laszlo, Renault, and Strasser, Curtiz and Wallis finally settled on something like the ending you know, albeit with Rick covering the couple’s escape by shooting the Nazi colonel in the back. According to one historian, Bogart stopped this detail at the last minute, fog machine rolling as Bogie said to Curtiz, “shooting him in the back would make me the old mad-dog again. Why can’t he go for his gun, at least?” From there, five of cinema’s most emotional, most ingenious minutes concluded the film.\n\nCasablanca is art, just as The Wizard of Oz is art, and so we must call its lead creatives artists. We know Curtiz did more than just show up; he made it go so fast that we all noticed, and in so doing earned a place in the conversation next to Ford and Huston. Warner Bros’ paid for the rights to “As Time Goes By” in perpetuity and used a five-second tag from it for its opening logo, meaning that roughly one out of seven films released in the decades since have been introduced as “from the studio that brought you Casablanca.” We keep being told “play it Sam,” we keep being told “you must remember this,” but we never needed to be convinced.\n\nInfluenced by: Classical Hollywood norms; Algiers (1938); films about war in Europe intruding on Americans’ peace\n\nInfluenced: romance films, war films, the possibilities of studio films\n\n“It’s straight down the line for both of us, remember?”\n\nBilly Wilder went to the past to bring on the future, meaning that he adapted a serial from 1936, and filmmaking techniques from 1941, to make a motion picture that established film noir for the future. This first drama directed by Wilder, Double Indemnity, goes out of its way to set its story in 1938, as though it couldn’t or wouldn’t have happened in the wartime Los Angeles of 1944.\n\nThis was an ironic reversal of the drama behind the scenes, whereby the Hays Office approved of the story in 1944 after disapproving it in 1936. Part of the Hays Office’s change of heart came from the steady change in norms through films like The Grapes of Wrath, but another part was Billy Wilder’s new adaptation, which altered the story’s double-suicide conclusion and made the leads more culpable for their crimes. At the time of the Hays Office’s welcome approval, Wilder had no way of knowing that the worst offscreen drama was yet to come, nor how much it would improve the onscreen drama. Wilder wanted to write the shooting script with the book’s author, James M. Cain, but Cain was tied up with another studio; producer Joseph Sistrom loved the book The Big Sleep and suggested Raymond Chandler, who had never before worked on a screenplay. Fans of noir marvel that three of its greatest names, Cain, Wilder, and Chandler, were the lead creatives on one film, but in practice, over four months of writing together, Wilder and Chandler almost killed each other. Wilder wanted to preserve most of Cain’s florid, fluid dialogue, and only after hearing actors read it aloud did Wilder agree with Chandler’s more bullet-point back-and-forth-ing. At one point in the process, Chandler wrote one of his longest works of art…a letter of resignation to Paramount explaining all the reasons he could no longer work with Wilder.\n\nWilder and Chandler not only reconciled but poured their frustrations with each other into the work, beefing up the role of Barton Keyes from Cain’s hapless nice guy to more of a wary adversary, more worthy of being played by Edward G. Robinson. Robinson was wary of moving from lead actor to third-billed actor here, but there was the precedent of The Philadelphia Story, a film that Walter Neff, played by Fred MacMurray, mentions by name…oddly, considering the source play hadn’t even been written by the time Double Indemnity is clearly set, July 1938. MacMurray wasn’t Paramount’s first or even fifth choice for the lead; this was the last big film that we know George Raft also turned down. MacMurray, known as a Tom Hanks-level nice guy, later gave Wilder credit for seeing something that he didn’t even see in himself. Barbara Stanwyck also had a goody-goody image and wasn’t sure she could even pretend to be as corrupt as her character…leading to the modern irony that Phyllis is how casual filmgoers know and love…to hate her.\n\nDouble Indemnity is about an insurance salesman who pays a call on a delinquent client only to meet his wife, Phyllis Dietrichson, who responds to his flirtations by asking about accident insurance. Their affair and his new policy begin, and before the film’s halfway point, Walter and Phyllis murder her husband in a manner rare enough to trigger a double-payout of his life insurance policy, or what’s called double indemnity. As a film title, the meaning expands itself to Walter and Phyllis’s double culpability and double iniquity, not just their lust but also their greed. By the film’s third act, Walter and Phyllis are proven doubly hubristic…not unlike their creators.\n\nWilder and Chandler’s script serves as a textbook example of how altering a film for censors can actually improve it. James M. Cain later said that he wished he’d thought of the device of Walter Neff telling most of the story into his insurance company’s recording device. Because Neff names himself as the murderer in the film’s first ten minutes, the focus shifts from a Sherlock Holmes-ish whodunnit to more of a whydunnit. In 1944, the Hays Code strictly forbade glorification of murder, and by suggesting that the next 90 minutes will not be glorifying our narrator’s behavior, we are somehow both distanced from it and plunged deeper into it. Cain’s story ends with Keyes watching Neff walk to the gas chamber, and Joseph Breen’s Hays Office’s 1944 letter forbade that specific imagery, but Wilder decided to film the scene…only to remove it anyway, less because of Breen and more because the now-final scene, which I won’t spoil here, contains a better culmination of the Keyes-Neff relationship. It was truer to what Wilder and Chandler had written together, and perhaps to what they had lived together.\n\nTechnically, films were set in Los Angeles before Double Indemnity, but this was the first film that really presented L.A. in all its dimensions, from cold insurance investigators to hot smells on empty streets at night. Wilder’s film is short on sentiment and long on stoicism, even longer on shadows cast by vast volumes of Venetian blinds. Add in its pioneering of hardboiled voiceover narration and obvious blending of aspects of Citizen Kane and The Maltese Falcon, and Double Indemnity stands for many as the best-loved, most paradigmatic film noir. No American director of the 1940s used the term “film noir,” which was a French description of a certain strain of American films like Laura, Gilda, Scarlet Street, Out of the Past, The Postman Always Rings Twice…but if these films weren’t trying to be something called film noir, they were attempting to emulate Double Indemnity.\n\nInfluenced by: Raymond Chandler and James M.

She doesn’t put it this way, but Desmond negotiates a vehicle trade: she’ll keep his if he’ll write her comeback one. One thing leads to another, and they begin an affair even as Joe begins moonlighting, professionally and personally, with Betty, a beautiful 22-year-old wannabe screenwriter.\n\nIn 1947, Wilder saw David Lean’s adaptation of Charles Dickens’ Great Expectations, about a past-her-prime woman named Miss Haversham who manipulates a poor boy into return visits. Wilder began thinking about the many run-down Xanadus not far from where he lived, on L.A.’s famous Sunset Boulevard, their occupants’ tragedies compounded by the fact that they had been retired from the movie business at far too young an age. His narrator and co-lead, Joe Gillis, would reference Haversham onscreen, as part of the character’s regular complaints that everything has been said and done before, a sneaky technique to get audiences used to an original story.\n\nCasting this sneaky narrator was tricky. Gillis had to exude enough booksmarts to be a writer and enough streetsmarts to be the cleverest guy in the room – not unlike Bogart, for whom half the town’s scripts were then written. Even if Bogart wasn’t already playing another screenwriter tied to a murder in a film called In a Lonely Place, Wilder didn’t want a 50-year-old; Gillis had to look 30 for Wilder’s story to work. Wilder was impressed with the handsome young Montgomery Clift, whom he signed to play Joe Gillis, but Clift backed out. Wilder searched for someone like Clift, as did the writers of the other half of the town’s scripts – or at least the makers of three of the four other films discussed on today’s podcast. Hearts heavy, Wilder finally decided on C-lister William Holden, who instantly and deservedly became an A-list star. Only 32, Holden seemed older; they had to age down Holden and age up their lead actress, who was 50 but seemed younger.\n\nCasting Norma Desmond was even trickier, considering Wilder and Brackett wanted one former A-list actress to somehow be a salute to all silent-film actresses. Other than extravagance, Swanson wasn’t much like Desmond: she was in a few talking pictures and wasn’t hurt when roles dried up, instead moving to New York to work in radio and eventually TV. In normal life, Swanson didn’t speak in Norma’s high-dudgeon manner with her head back and her wide eyes staring over the bridge of her nose, but the success of this campy approach is a testament to her genuine acting talent. For the scene in which Gillis and Desmond watch one of her movies, Wilder managed to find one of the rare silent clips in which Swanson is actually looking up…in a movie called Queen Kelly directed by Erich Von Stroheim, who in Sunset Boulevard plays Max von Mayerling, a fictional director that was, like Von Stroheim, considered one of the three major silent-film dramatists along with D.W. Griffith and Cecil DeMille. Sunset Boulevard is full of these sorts of self-reflexive clevernesses, including DeMille turning up to do something of a long, more self-aggrandizing turn as himself.\n\nDeMille’s presence is worthwhile if only to set up one of the best lines to end any picture, “Mr. DeMille, I’m ready for my close-up.” Consider your own emotions during that line and Norma’s other infamous line, in response to Joe Gillis saying “You used to be big,” she answers, “I’m still big. It’s the pictures that got small.” We are skillfully directed to extremely mixed emotions toward Norma: love, disgust, appreciation, pity, friendship, contempt. Near the end, the story seems to have been going one way, with Joe appearing to fall in love with Betty…but then the story swerves like a car with a flat tire. Norma calls Betty to rat out Joe as her lover, but Joe calls Norma’s bluff and calls Betty to the mansion, whereupon Joe sincerely tells Betty how much he loves his situation with Norma. After Betty leaves the house, Joe leaves Norma anyway, whereupon she kills him, but the larger point is that Joe’s surprise confession to Betty substitutes for the audience’s…we have enjoyed this journey into dependence and dementia and maybe even death.\n\nInfluenced by: silent-film Hollywood; writerly ambition and frustration\n\nInfluenced: female mentor-male mentee relationships\n\n“Fasten your seatbelts. It’s going to be a bumpy night.”\n\nJoseph Mankiewicz could find ideas and claim them as his own, possibly including Wilder’s, definitely including Mary Orr’s, who in 1946 wrote and published “The Wisdom of Eve,” based loosely on a real actress’s superfan who became that actress’s assistant and tried to steal her life. When Mankiewicz appropriated Mary Orr’s story into a film called All About Eve without giving Orr screen credit, you might say art imitated life imitating art imitating life.\n\nMany modern viewers don’t know that Bette Davis was one of the 1930s’ three or four biggest stars, and get introduced to Davis only through All About Eve, assuming that the role was written for her. In fact, Mankiewicz was thinking about Susan Hayward, whom Zanuck rejected for being too young. Wilder and Brackett wanted a silent star, but Mankiewicz and Zanuck wanted someone from the period just after, and considered Marlene Dietrich, Gertrude Lawrence, Tallulah Bankhead, Joan Crawford, and Ingrid Bergman, before finally casting…Claudette Colbert, who was injured in pre-production and had to drop out. Bette Davis took on the role partly because her 18-year relationship as the female face of Warner Bros. had just come to a bitter and acrimonious end, and Davis was eager to prove she could headline another studio’s material. All this is a long way of saying that Davis, one of cinema’s finest actresses, was never playing herself as Margo Channing, with the caveat that upon casting her Mankiewicz made the role a little saltier.\n\nAll About Eve is about a 40-year-old Broadway star, Margo Channing, who meets a superfan named Eve who ingratiates herself into every part of Margo’s life, up to and including a failed effort to seduce Margo’s presumptive fiancé, Bill, as well as a successful effort to secure Margo’s presumptive next role. The film is narrated by two of its central characters, neither of whom are Margo or Eve: one is Addison DeWitt, a theater critic, and the other is Karen Richards, Margo’s best friend and the wife of the playwright of Margo’s current play, Aged in Wood and likely future play, Footsteps on the Ceiling, both titles wryly commenting on Margo’s fear of being aged out of the business. Both narrations come from Addison and Karen sitting at the same table, and among the best aspects of All About Eve are the surfeit of scenes of adults talking around tables. The large cast, including Thelma Ritter and Marilyn Monroe, makes a virtue of complexity, for example with director Bill and playwright Lloyd’s eventual fights over Eve, probably inspired as much by the squabbles of Mankiewicz and Zanuck (who gets name-checked) as by the recent fights between Broadway director Elia Kazan and writers Tennessee Williams and Arthur Miller.\n\nThe film of Streetcar wasn’t finished until 1951, but the play’s late-40s success is part of the context of All About Eve, part of why Margo name-drops Stanislavski, and part of why Margo in Aged in Wood is playing an aging Southern belle. Sixteen minutes into All About Eve, Eve says to Margo, “It got so I couldn’t tell the real from the unreal, except that the unreal seemed more real to me.” Here Eve states a key theme: characters deliberately choose fantasy over harsh reality, and/or believe that they can will themselves into unlikely positions in life. Compared to Norma Desmond and Blanche DuBois, though, Margo Channing’s relationship to fantasy is more professional: she knows the parameters around ageism, she knows what parts she can and can’t play, and she demonstrates she understands Eve’s role-playing within role-playing when Davis-as-Channing says, with a wry wink and wrinkle, “Fasten your seat belts, it’s going to be a bumpy night.”\n\nPerhaps every love affair involves a level of delusion, but Margo seems to dictate the terms of hers, habitually mentioning that she’s 40 and Bill is 32, an age gap that happens to mirror the one between Bill and 24-year-old Eve. Margo manages to finish the film in the amorous relationship with which she began the film, earning a far happier ending than Norma or Blanche. And yet, several scholars, like Robert Corber and Sam Staggs, have questioned Margo’s, and the film’s, rote defense of heterosexuality, for example in Margo’s mid-film speech about how a woman isn’t a woman without a man beside her. Using that and many other textual examples, scholars have shown the frailty of Lloyd and Karen and Bill and Margo as they retreat to straight relationships to defend themselves against the predatory careerism of the homosexual Addison and Eve, the latter two winding up together as an alliance against other sorts of judgments.\n\nI certainly wouldn’t take anything away from any queer person who has found comfort in the text, but the case isn’t ironclad; certainly, people watch the film without naming Addison or Eve as queer. Maybe the queerest thing about All About Eve is the way Eve and Margo transcend most categories. The characters keep saying how there could never be anyone else like Eve, and yet the film’s ending, with Eve getting, uh, Eve’d, suggests that her type is perhaps not so unusual. And somehow, Bette Davis’s performance as Margo Channing seems ahead of anything you might say about her, ahead of the script itself. This is surely a key reason that Academy voters recognized the film with a record 14 nominations – it remains the only film in history to get four of its actresses nominated – and six wins, including George Sanders for Best Supporting Actor as Addison, Edith Head for costumes, Joseph Mankiewicz for both writing and directing, and the Best Picture Oscar over Sunset Boulevard. Norma Desmond was ready for her close-up, ready for Mr. DeMille to shove those noir-ish interiors aside, but voters gravitated to Margo Channing, who was fully lit, often happy, and in glorious stride.\n\nInfluenced by: Broadway vicissitudes; Davis’ filmography\n\nInfluenced: stories, in and out of Hollywood, about replacement\n\n“I don’t want realism. I want magic! Yes, yes, magic. I try to give that to people. I do misrepresent things. I don’t tell truths. I tell what ought to be truth.”\n\nTennessee Williams, a queer writer from Mississippi who had worked in a factory with an unapologetically abusive man, moved to New Orleans, dated students, and watched as his sister Rose was diagnosed with schizophrenia, lobotomized, and permanently institutionalized. From these elements and his considerable genius came perhaps the best play ever written by an American, A Streetcar Named Desire. Even the best of plays need patrons and collaborators, and Williams was fortunate, shortly after the war, to meet Irene Mayer Selznick, who had just divorced her husband David O. Selznick and was trying to support promising new Broadway talent. After Williams’ wartime success with The Glass Menagerie, Selznick connected Williams with Elia Kazan.\n\nSelznick wanted and almost got two Hollywood stars as Blanche and Stanley; Tennessee Williams wanted Blanche played by the unknown Jessica Tandy, who he’d seen in a minor play, and some kind of bitter working-class 40-year-old as Stanley. Kazan went with Tandy as Blanche but in the case of Stanley insisted on an unknown young wunderkind; Williams wasn’t happy that audiences would now credit Stanley’s temper to youthful ignorance. But those thoughts disappeared the first time Williams saw, in rehearsal, this unknown 23-year-old named Marlon Brando as Stanley Kowalski; like Kazan and Selznick, Williams knew he was watching lightning in a bottle.\n\nKazan made Panic in the Streets, a movie about New Orleans cops trying to prevent an epidemic of pneumonic plague, which Kazan filmed in a noir style precisely to “try out” that style for A Streetcar Named Desire. Ultimately he decided it didn’t quite work, and as Kazan prepared the more evenly lit, stage-like, dilapidated film sets, he remained flexible about who played the outsider Blanche, this time the other way: he let Warner Brothers cast a star, Vivien Leigh, as long as he could have the rest of his opening night cast, including the unimaginably gifted Brando, who was doing a lot of what Monty Clift had been doing in A Place in the Sun, but added to that an animalistic, working-class masculinity that wound up changing American acting.\n\nA Streetcar Named Desire is about a middle-aged English teacher, Blanche DuBois, who arrives in New Orleans to stay with her sister Stella after Blanche has apparently driven her husband to suicide. (In the play, the suicide is because he’s gay; the Code disapproved of homosexuality but happily approved of misogyny.) Blanche’s bourgeois airs clash with Stella’s squalid apartment and husband’s brutish, working-class pride; Stanley tries to send Blanche back to their family estate, but Belle Reve has been lost to creditors. Belle Reve is French for beautiful dream, and Blanche has either lost it or is lost in it, but neither matters to Stanley’s friend Mitch, who begins courting Blanche. At one point, frustrated and drunk, Stanley hits Stella, causing her to flee to a neighbor, upon which Stanley moans from the courtyard – you may have heard about this – “Stella!!!” Mute the next minute if you aren’t familiar. Fed up with Blanche treating him like an animal and begging her sister to leave him, Stanley learns, and then reveals to Mitch, Blanche’s history of mental instability and being fired for sleeping with a student. While Stella gives birth at a hospital, Stanley and Blanche, alone at the apartment, excoriate each other, and the film’s scene ends with a shattered mirror, unlike in the play in which Stanley takes her unconscious body to bed, more overtly implying rape.\n\nBlanche awakens on the opposite end of the spectrum, suffering a mental breakdown and getting hauled off to an insane asylum as she says, in a line to rival Norma Desmond’s final words, “Whoever you are – I have always depended on the kindness of strangers.” Kazan actually alters Streetcar’s stage ending in which Stella meekly cries over her sister’s fate; in the slightly more feminist film, Stella reacts by taking her new baby away from Stanley and vowing never to return to him, a revision which enables a concluding “Stella!”All respect to Jessica Tandy, but Vivien Leigh is revelatory, showing Blanche DuBois’s deep, fragile humanity behind her delusions of moonlight and magnolias. We want to somehow preserve her whimsy and spirit, which is really saying something considering the quality of the performance of her antagonist. Blanche’s film-long battle with Stanley comes to us now partly as a clash of acting styles, one technique personified by Leigh and her husband Laurence Olivier versus a technique we now call Method Acting or Stanislavskiesque performance as personified by Brando. Some movies need all their actors on the same page, but Streetcar makes sense when Blanche behaves as though she’s in a different world.\n\nInfluenced by: neo-realism, Strasberg-inflected changes to American theater\n\nInfluenced: among other things, a sea change in considerations of “good acting”\n\n“Nature, Mr. Allnut, is what we are put in this world to rise above.”\n\nIn 1951, Sam Spiegel was the only Hollywood producer crazy enough to agree with John Huston that C.S. Forester’s 1935 novel needed to be made in Africa, considering that for 15 years it had almost been made in America. Warner Brothers scoffed at Spiegel and Huston, who had to set up their own production company and distribute through United Artists. Still, what a maturing for an industry: a writer thinks of an idea in England, and the idea comes to full-color life with two of America’s biggest movie stars halfway around the world. The African Queen expanded the canvas of all cinematic possibilities.\n\nOf all of Hollywood’s top filmmakers, Huston was amongst the most farsighted. The Maltese Falcon anticipated noir, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre anticipated fewer assembly line productions and more one-off projects in distant locations, and The African Queen continued and doubled down on that insight with an A-listers-in-conflict action-adventure that sure as heck wouldn’t look like anything on television. The last podcast sometimes made it sound like filmmakers were thinking of Bogart and Bacall, writing a man paired with a woman he was old enough to have fathered. After Bogart and Huston returned from Mexico in 1947, Huston did cast Bacall alongside Bogart for the couple’s fourth and final onscreen pairing, in the excellent Key Largo, but the casting of The African Queen would countervail the 1950s trend of onscreen ageism and instead cast the unmatchable Katharine Hepburn as Bogart’s sparring partner and eventual age-appropriate lover. But Bacall wouldn’t be as left out as she was with Sierra Madre; instead she came along, helped the production offscreen, and became Hepburn’s lifelong friend. Huston’s wife, on the other hand, remained in Ireland, where she gave birth to Angelica Huston on July 8th; John learned about it through a telegram to the Congo.\n\nThe African Queen is about a British Methodist missionary, Rose Sayer, living in German-controlled East Africa in September 1914 as war breaks out in Europe. German troops kill Rose’s husband, burn down their village, and almost kill Rose, but she manages to escape with her village’s mail carrier, working-class Canadian Charlie Allnut, on his small steam launchboat which is called the African Queen. Charlie tells Rose that Germans have positioned a large gunboat at the mouth of the river which prevents British ships from coming to rescue any British in their section of Africa; Rose suggests they turn their little craft into a surprise torpedo and destroy the German gunboat. Charlie tells Rose how crazy she is, but eventually agrees to the plan, and after many literal and figurative twists and turns, they become lovers, and their plan against the Germans fails…only to succeed at the last minute.\n\nThe African Queen has been referenced and recycled by too many filmmakers to name here, not least Walt Disney who designed Disneyland’s Jungle Cruise ride as an homage. Nonetheless, more than a century after the film’s depicted events, it may seem antiquated. If you only knew the title The African Queen, you may have hoped that the title referred to something other than a ship owned by a white guy, or by inference, the white woman on the ship with him, or perhaps a chess piece that Charlie and Rose are willing to sacrifice to knock out the king which is the German gunboat. In his book Modernity and the African Cinema (2004, Africa World Press), the Nigerian scholar Femi Okiremuete Shaka proposes eleven conventions of the colonialist film and offers a specific critique of The African Queen as a colonial adventure film. The case comes down to “safari shots” that render Africa as wild spectacle or as a symbolic Garden of Eden, complete with apple-like hazards, that must be overcome by heroic white people who are more cultured than the primitive locals. This is especially apparent in the early part of the film, when we see plenty of safari shots as well as Africans lounging or running away from danger. That said, one could make a case that most of the story of The African Queen could have happened anywhere – say, a river in Eastern Canada. Africa here is rendered into a background where white people, British and German, fight over their own problems – which is its own problem.\n\nInfluenced by: John Huston’s post-Sierra Madre mastery of his form\n\nInfluenced: adventure films, especially star-led ones like Romancing the Stone\n\n“Well then everybody was a dope.”\n\nFreed wondered if his own songs of the 1920s, written with Nacio Herb Brown, couldn’t be made into their own musical. Freed hired screenwriters Betty Comden and Adolph Green to do the stringing together, and Comden and Green decided that the story should be set in show business during roughly the same period that the songs came out, the early sound era. As screenwriters they were painfully aware of the twin threats of anti-Communism and television, and they may have placed the story in the 20s for a pro-union spirit and some TV-savvy behind-the-scenes gags. Historian Peter Lev sees the film as a statement about Hollywood’s troubles in two periods, and that these too will pass, in the 50s as they did in the 20s, and in the meantime we can be, not to put too fine a point on it, Singin’ in the Rain.\n\nComden and Green presented a draft to Gene Kelly as he finished An American in Paris. Kelly loved what he read and lured his co-director on On the Town, Stanley Donen, to sign on as co-director here; Kelly was happy to delegate the dialogue scenes to Donen while directing the dance sequences himself and preserving those scenes’ non-cuts so that people could see his abilities. Of Comden, Green, Donen, and Kelly, only Kelly had been involved with An American in Paris, and he knew what worked from that and what didn’t. Freed had assigned that film’s cinematographer, John Alton, but Kelly replaced him with he and Donen’s DP from On the Town, Harold Rosson. Compared to An American in Paris, Kelly made sure that Singin’ in the Rain would be about a hundred times funnier, first by casting Jean Hagen in the ostensible Milo Roberts role that would now comically symbolize every actor that couldn’t transition to sound, and second by casting Donald O’Connor in the Adam Cook composer friend role now reimagined as the pluperfect slapstick sidekick. O’Connor on board, Comden and Green came up with two original songs that played to O’Connor’s strengths: “Moses Supposes” with music by Roger Edens, and “Make Em Laugh” with music by an uncredited Cole Porter.\n\nAs the romantic lead, Kathy, Freed almost cast Cyd Charisse, a far more accomplished dancer than Debbie Reynolds, but Kelly and Donen together decided Kathy required a certain cornpone charisma, and as a gymnast Reynolds could be taught to dance. During shooting, however, Kelly went ballistic at Reynolds’ lack of ability; visiting the set, Kelly’s friend Fred Astaire found Reynolds crying under a piano and helped teach her some moves. Kelly regretted not casting Cyd Charisse, and being under contract at MGM she was made to appear in a Louise Brooks wig in the extended “Broadway Melody” dance-slash-dream sequence of Act III, an obvious consecution of An American in Paris that Freed insisted upon. What Freed did not insist upon was any kind of representation of the actual diversity of Hollywood in the late 1920s, including the many Asians, Latinos, and Black people who were working there then; instead, the film whitewashes the past. It’s not the worst such offender, but its blithe reworking of 1920s songs inspired by African-American music is only a slight improvement over The Jazz Singer.\n\nSingin’ in the Rain is about The Jazz Singer’s effect on a few Hollywood talents, starting with Don Lockwood and Lina Lamont. Their studio, the fictional Monumental Pictures, promotes Don and Lina as lovers, but Don is more interested in Kathy, a woman whose car he falls into while escaping adoring fans. With the advent of sound, Lockwood and Lamont’s latest, The Duelling Cavalier, gets remade with sound scenes, only to find a test audience laughing at the poor sound, especially Lamont’s squawkish voice. As Lina takes voice lessons, Don and his friend, composer Cosmo Brown (his name a salute to Nacio Herb Brown), refashion The Duelling Cavalier as a musical with Kathy dubbing Lina’s role. Lina learns of their treachery and tries to force the studio head, R.F. (his name a salute to Arthur Freed), to put Kathy under permanent contract as Lina’s voice. The whole thing unravels at The Duelling Cavalier’s world premiere, where the world learns that Kathy dubbed Lina’s voice and Kathy learns that Don loves her.\n\nNone of this really captures the feeling of watching Singin’ in the Rain, which is something akin to drinking joy and happiness straight from a bottle. Peter Wollen, in his excellent book about the picture, calls the title number “the single most memorable dance number on film,” and as a mainstay of montages about cinema, Kelly’s raindance has sashayed its way into everyone’s visual DNA. Screenwriting logic dictated that the notion of “Singin’ in the Rain” would make sense about halfway through the film, when our lead(s) has accomplished a major goal but now has even thornier issues to resolve. An early draft of Comden and Green’s had the three leads performing it upon making the decision to change The Duelling Cavalier into a musical; Kelly decided that the film needed him to solo somewhere, and that the song would broaden its appeal and meaning if performed by Don solo after his first kiss with Kathy. Kelly also added the words “and dancin’” to Brown and Freed’s song from 1929. The scene took almost three days to film, and on at least one of those days Kelly had a fever of 103 degrees, a situation worsened by the thousands of prop raindrops dropping on his suit. One wonders how many thousands of times this anecdote has been dropped on latter-day reluctant actors and dancers.\n\nInfluenced by: gimlet-eyed nostalgia for the 1920s; Broadway conventions\n\nInfluenced: movie musicals and mirth in all mediums\n\n“They’re making me run. I’ve never run from anybody before.”\n\nStanley Kramer, who later marketed himself as Hollywood’s greatest liberal crusader, claimed that he fired screenwriter Carl Foreman from High Noon because Foreman had threatened to falsely name him to HUAC as a Communist. Foreman was indeed blacklisted by studios due to the “uncooperative witness” label and pressure from people like John Wayne, who later said that he would “never regret having helped run Foreman out of the country”; Foreman left America in 1952 to work in England.\n\nSomehow, High Noon director Fred Zinnemann avoided being pigeonholed by HUAC, partly because he’d lost both his parents in the Holocaust, but more because he didn’t publicly confront McCarthyites, telling the press that High Noon was more about independence and conflict of conscience. The role of Will Kane was obviously written for a star like…Clift or Brando by 1951, but they both turned it down. John Wayne refused the role because High Noon was an obvious allegory against blacklisting. Gary Cooper shared Wayne’s conservatism, and even appeared as a friendly witness before HUAC, but felt the role was too good to pass up, and Cooper’s persona, his quiet integrity, fit Kane like a glove. In summer 1951 Hollywood only had one star named Kelly with a first initial of G, but that was about to change because Stanley Kramer had seen a woman named Grace Kelly in an off-Broadway play and cast her as Amy, Will Kane’s new wife. Their age gap was even wider than Bogart and Bacall’s, 50 to 21. That said, Kramer also cast 27-year-old Katy Jurado as Helen Ramirez, who stands as a mixed message: she’s the former lover of Kane, of Kane’s nemesis, and of Kane’s deputy, who runs, uh, the town brothel, yet projects indomitability while she hectors the deputy and Amy over their choices.\n\nIn High Noon, the sheriff of a small Old-West town, Will Kane, gets married to a pacifist Quaker, Amy Fowler, and leaves by coach for another town where he’ll manage a store and raise a family. However, Will learns that Frank Miller has broken out of the prison Kane put him in and reassembled his outlaw gang, which will arrive on the 12 o clock train before the new sheriff arrives. Will returns to town determined to defend himself and the town; Amy insists that Will back down, and she says she’ll get on that noon train with or without Will. Most of the film consists of Will trying and failing to convince townspersons to help him, who refuse because: their taxes have already paid for Will’s help; a gunfight might hurt the town’s reputation; Will should never have put Miller away; they’re cowardly. In the end, Kane faces Miller and his three men alone, but Amy finally decides not to board the noon train and instead saves Will and the town. In the final shot, Will throws his sheriff’s badge into the dirt.\n\nMovies with the visual ambition of The African Queen and Singin’ in the Rain were rare, and so westerns had become Hollywood’s leading contrast with the small-scale aesthetic of television, showcasing their wide-open colorful vistas, large horse trains, and complicated action sequences. That is, most westerns. High Noon looked at first like the kind of western that you did see on television, in black-and-white with mostly actors talking. But High Noon wound up showing how facile most TV westerns really were, particularly by essaying the “real time” conceit that most early TV dramas adopted out of necessity. In the hands of Zinnemann, the 75 filmic minutes that count down to high noon become something more excruciatingly suspenseful than anything on radio or TV. The sharp black-and-white celluloid contrasts well with the grainy flatness of your average Lone Ranger episode. Timothy Corrigan and Patricia White explain how Dimitri Tiomkin’s theme song of the film, “Do Not Forsake Me Oh My Darling,” quote “carries characters across space and helps bridge transitions between scene changes.” The song also inspired other Westerns to shoehorn in country songs when the song became an unexpected chart hit in 1952.\n\nThe film High Noon did likewise, and became a nominee for seven Academy Awards and winner of four, including a career capstone Oscar for Cooper, who, because he was filming in Europe, asked his friend John Wayne to accept the award. That night Wayne was magnanimous, lying that he would go find his agent to learn why he didn’t get High Noon, but years later Wayne called the film “the most un-American thing I’ve ever seen in my whole life” and made Rio Bravo as a response. As it happened, Soviets didn’t like the film either, dismissing its “glorification of the individual.” Later still, Ronald Reagan called it his favorite film, and Bill Clinton screened it at the White House a record 17 times, saying, “Any time you’re alone and you feel you’re not getting the support you need, Cooper’s Will Kane becomes the perfect metaphor.”\n\nInfluenced by: the Red Scare and HUAC persecution, Stanley Kramer-level idealism\n\nInfluenced: future invocations of put-upon American heroism\n\n“Tough monkey. Guys like you end up in the stockade sooner or later. Some day you’ll walk in; I’ll be waiting. I’ll show you a couple of things.”\n\nThe epigraph in James Jones’ 1951 novel clarified that the title came from a Rudyard Kipling verse where he called British soldiers “damned from here to eternity.” Indeed, the novel was hardly popular because of beach kisses; instead it was considered hard-hitting, in a way literally, because of its story of Private Prewitt being physically tortured by his Captain. Prewitt, called “Prew” and eventually played by Clift, refuses to join the Captain’s boxing team because the last time he boxed, he made a friend blind. The 850-page novel was forthright about venereal disease, a brothel, a good-hearted prostitute, and a lot of covert and overt homosexuality, including a related suicide and an implication that Prew may have transferred because of a gay lover. The film adaptation, following the still-powerful Hays Code, changed gonorrhea to a miscarriage for the sake of its effect on the plot, turned the prostitute played by Donna Reed into a social club hostess, and simply deleted most of the queer stuff, although arguably, onscreen Maggio is suspiciously loyal to Prew, and one of them dies in the other’s arms.\n\nFrom Here to Eternity, the blockbuster film, is about soldiers and their lovers stationed at Schofield Barracks in Oahu in the months just before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. As the nefarious Captain Holmes hazes Prew for refusing to box for him, Sergeant Warren begins an affair with Holmes’ unhappy wife, Karen, who convinces Warren to try to become an officer so that they can be publicly together. Maggio gets into a bar fight with Fatso Judson, and when Maggio is later sent to the stockade, Fatso tortures Maggio as Holmes had Prewitt, with Holmes’ complicity. Spoiler: Japan attacks Pearl Harbor. Okay, real spoiler: maybe a week before the attack, after Maggio dies of injuries, Prew cries while delivering Maggio’s bugle tribute, Warren gives up on becoming an officer, and Holmes’ pattern of abuse reveals conduct unbecoming an officer. In the hard-hitting novel, Holmes actually gets promoted and transferred stateside before December 7th. The U.S. Army, providing its bases and support, insisted on many changes from pages to screen, but the one that most frustrated Zinnemann was the forced resignation of Holmes under threat of court-martial, or as the director later called it, “the worst moment in the film, resembling a recruiting short…it makes me sick every time I see it.” Despite this capitulation, the Navy and Army were unhappy with the finished film and refused to permit their names in the opening credits, something Zinnemann may have been secretly happy about. Audiences didn’t seem bothered; the film became one of the ten highest-grossing films of the 1950s.\n\nFans of the film The Godfather sometimes believe that Frank Sinatra was cast as Maggio because of the mafia, but no, Sinatra lobbied for and earned what was for him a step down to a supporting role; when his character Maggio was beaten to a pulp, it almost felt like penance for Sinatra’s recent public arrogance and bad choices since his films with Gene Kelly, a penance that factored into why he won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Sinatra was also with the right name on the ballot: From Here to Eternity was nominated for 13 Academy Awards for 1953 and won a well-deserved 8, including Best Director and Best Picture. As From Here to Eternity passed from there to the eternity of cinema history, it seems to have avoided the reappraisals of, say, Stagecoach, which we now see as a film that, toward its end, other-izes angry persons of color who attack our white heroes. Scholars might have similarly condemned From Here to Eternity’s treatment of its so-called Japs, but haven’t, partly because the film barely shows their faces, partly because Pearl Harbor’s sneak attackers are so vilified everywhere. That doesn’t excuse the film’s whitewashing of the native descendants of Hawaii more generally, and if that seems beyond white America at the time, keep in mind that the musical “South Pacific,” based on a veteran’s novel about the war in the Pacific that included romance between white soldiers and Pacific Islanders, was in 1953 enjoying its fifth smash year on Broadway.\n\nInfluenced by: films like The Best Years of Our Lives particular in the focus on female POVs\n\nInfluenced: endlessly referenced; considered an all-time classic\n\n“You don’t understand!

Corridan, based Johnny Friendly on East River boss Michael Clemente, and put the action in Hoboken, preserving enough differences for a barely-plausible deniability. Kazan and Schulberg brought their script to Darryl Zanuck at Fox, who said, “Who’s gonna care about a bunch of sweaty longshoremen?” Zanuck’s comment shows how far he, and Hollywood, had come in the 14 years since Zanuck produced The Grapes of Wrath. Of course, an actor like Humphrey Bogart might vaguely suggest that he’d come from poverty before becoming a detective or other hero, but an entire film about the struggles of working-class palookas set or even made on the docks of Hoboken? Every major studio turned it down, leaving it to Sam Spiegel, who needed to prove that his producing The African Queen wasn’t a fluke.\n\nSam Spiegel managed to set up a deal with a reluctant Columbia after Kazan managed to convince Marlon Brando to play the lead. Kazan had theoretically “discovered” Brando, but that didn’t mean as much now that Brando was a big star. Before winning the Oscar, Frank Sinatra thought he had the inside track to play Terry Malloy, especially considering he was actually from Hoboken where the film was set and eventually shot. However, Kazan was so sure that he needed a “Brando-like actor” that he set up a screen test of a Terry/Edie scene with two unknowns from his Actor’s Studio, Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward. After Spiegel and Brando’s agent Jay Kanter saw the electrifying test, they agreed to make a deal on Brando’s rate. To play Edie, Kazan took a chance on yet another unknown from his Actor’s Studio, Eva Marie Saint. Other Method Actors filled out the rest of the cast, especially the beefier-looking ones, and Kazan deserves just a soupcon of credit for giving a black actor a few lines as one of the main longshoremen. Less comprehensible is why Kazan created more noir-ish vignettes of Terry and Edie running down wet, headlight-illuminated alleys than he did of dock laborers actually laboring.\n\nOn the Waterfront is about Terry Malloy, a once-promising boxer who used to take dives to earn his brother Charlie short-term profits. Now Terry is known as a bum who hangs around docks hoping to do day labor, and usually gets it through Charlie, now the right-hand-man of dock boss Johnny Friendly. The film opens with Terry signaling a worker named Joey to the edge of a rooftop where, Terry thinks, Friendly’s men are going to “lean on” Joey; in fact, they defenestrate Joey because he is about to testify to Friendly’s extortion and racketeering. Joey’s sister Edie wants to know who killed her brother; Terry courts her without telling her what he knows. Another dockworker, Kayo, with the staunch support of Father Barry, prepares to testify, and Friendly kills him as well. After Terry confesses to Edie, she tries to get Terry and Father Barry to bring down Friendly, but Terry refuses to risk his brother Charlie’s life. Yet Terry is frustrated with Charlie’s corruption, and finally confronts him, saying “I coulda had class. I coulda been a contender. I coulda been somebody. Instead of a bum, which is what I am, I mean let’s face it.” Charlie gives Terry a gun to defend himself, and when Friendly learns of this, he leaves Charlie’s corpse on a meat-hook for Terry to find. Terry almost kills Friendly in retaliation, but Father Barry convinces Terry to retaliate with court testimony, and he does. In the finale, Friendly’s goon hires every hopeful dockworker except Terry, but they refuse to work unless Terry does too. Finally Friendly is humiliated and the dockworkers go on without him.\n\nCritics have long maintained that On the Waterfront is an extended paean to informing. On the one hand, there’s the un-subtle symbolism of the hobby that makes Terry a sympathetic figure, namely raising pigeons in rooftop cages. Did an earlier version of the script have Terry raising canaries and rats, as well? On the other hand, when liberal crusader Brando was asked why he took the role, he emphasized the story’s factual elements and the indisputable bravery of real-life working-class whistleblowers. Brando had good reason not to disavow the project; it deservedly earned him his Best Actor Oscar as his haunting “I coulda been a contender” speech became part of even the most abbreviated looks at film history. The well-made, well-received, well-earning film was nominated for 12 Academy Awards and won eight, including Best Screenplay for Schulberg, Best Director for Kazan, Best Cinematography for the outstanding Boris Kaufman, Best Picture, which went to Sam Spiegel, and Best Supporting Actress for Saint in her debut role.\n\nInfluenced by: Kazan’s work and Adler-inflected work on screen and stage\n\nInfluenced: performances; maybe every serious American film drama about labor\n\n“You’re tearing me apart!”\n\nA weird thing happened at East of Eden’s New York premiere: critics went wild over James Dean, causing Jack Warner to realize Rebel Without a Cause could be more than a B-picture. Rebel had already begun shooting in black and white; Warner instructed director Nicholas Ray to scrap the black and white footage, reshoot it in color, and even use Warners’ state-of-the-art CinemaScope process. Ray was already looking for a way to distinguish his lead character’s leather jacket from the one Brando wore in The Wild One; now Ray could simply make the jacket red, a choice that would help his film ascend into iconic status.\n\nIn many ways, Rebel Without a Cause aimed to simply distill the energy of The Wild One into a story of an adolescent named Jim Stark against his parents and the world, and in so doing, Jack Warner caught a wave bigger than he could imagine, with Jim Stark only the first and best appropriation of Johnny Strabler, both figures later echoed by everyone from Elvis to Hell’s Angels to the Fonz to Danny from Grease to a million real-life so-called “greasers.” Some critics, like the New York Times’ Bosley Crowther, would upbraid Dean for a slavish imitation of Brando, apparently missing that teens like Jim Stark were learning to perform new identities through seeing The Wild One.\n\nThe popularity of Method Acting as expressed by Clift, Brando, and in this iteration, Dean, was less about Lee Strasberg’s sense memory exercises and more about those furtive anxious glances, that 1950s sense that something was wrong with John Wayne-style masculinity. One might have thought Rebel Without a Cause’s writers Irving Schulman and Nicholas Ray got their title from The Wild One’s dialogue, but in fact the phrase came from psychiatrist Robert M. Lindner‘s 1944 book, Rebel Without a Cause: The Hypnoanalysis of a Criminal Psychopath, even as the film made no other reference to the book. By the time of the script-writing ten years later, Schulman and Ray had some specific causes in mind, though they knew it sounded better to claim otherwise: as an over-summary, Jim was frustrated with his parents and felt alienated and isolated from 1950s repression of masculinity and any morality beyond capitalism.\n\nRebel without a Cause film broke ground in trying to be honest about what was called the moral decay of American youth, about what was not yet called the generation gap, and about what Oscar Wilde’s trial, among others, called “the love that dare not speak its name,” a love that had been candidly portrayed in books like From Here to Eternity but never empathetically portrayed in a Hollywood film. Writer Schulman later said that he was sorry he hadn’t been more explicit about the sexuality of Plato, Jim’s starry-eyed sidekick. You can’t really blame Schulman: the Hays Code was explicit about forbidding any positive representation of homosexuality, and even as Rebel was filming, MGM was adapting a hit play about a homosexual man, Tea and Sympathy, into a movie that would somehow cut all the homosexuality out? Basically its lead would have to be ostracized for being a sissy who doesn’t like girls (wink, wink), and something similar is true of Plato. The clues are there for those willing to see them, from Plato’s locker poster of Alan Ladd to the dreamy way Sal Mineo, as Plato, talks and talks and talks about Jim.\n\nRebel Without a Cause begins with three teenagers under arrest in a police department’s juvenile division. Jim, Judy, and Plato, meet, exchange grievances about their life and parents, and cautiously become friends. When Jim’s parents fail to cease their bickering even as they are picking him up, Jim cries, “You’re tearing me apart!” In high school, Judy runs with the “cooler” juvenile delinquents, led by the obnoxious Buzz; on a field trip at Griffith Observatory, Buzz goads Jim into a knife fight that Jim wins. Buzz challenges Jim to a “chickie run” whereby two cars speed toward a cliff and the loser is the one who jumps out first. After Jim elliptically asks his father Frank about defending one’s honor, and Frank recommends backing down, Jim and Buzz do the chickie run, Buzz’s door-lock jams, and Buzz plunges to his death. Like Terry, Jim feels displaced guilt and confesses his involvement, in Jim’s case to his parents, who threaten to move the family again. Jim flees and makes his own family with Judy and Plato in an abandoned mansion which may or may not be meant as the house from Sunset Boulevard (it was filmed there). Jim and Judy share a first kiss as Buzz’s gang turns up and finds a half-asleep Plato, who shoots and wounds one of them, causing them to flee even as Plato accuses Jim of leaving him behind. Plato flees to the Observatory, Jim and Judy convince Plato to exchange his gun’s bullets for Jim’s jacket, but the police see Plato holding his gun and shoot and kill him anyway, echoing the fate of pretty much every openly gay character in Hollywood before 1970. Jim introduces Judy to his father in a tentative reconciliation.\n\nWe will never know how the film would have been received if Dean had lived, but, echoing the Buzz character, the 24-year-old Dean died in a shocking car accident on September 30, 1955, and four weeks later, the film premiered. If Rebel Without a Cause made a few points ham-handedly, these were overwhelmed by its sudden stature as a memento mori, a cry of a new generation that was apparently dying to be heard. We might now see it as white privilege, but in a way, that was its virtue compared to the same year’s The Blackboard Jungle, about disaffected New York City slum-bound teenagers: Rebel was saying that even or especially America’s suburban middle-class teens also weren’t happy with this system, a message that would be amplified by youth movements during the 1960s. Rebel is a sort of a small film, but in some ways it’s bigger than this list, bigger than Hollywood.\n\nInfluenced by: stories of rebellious teens; Dean was almost too influenced by Brando\n\nInfluenced: before John Hughes this was THE teen film, prompting youth in 50s and 60s to question authority\n\n“What do you want me to do? Draw you a picture? Spell it out? Don’t ever ask me! Long as you live, don’t ever ask me more.”\n\nA genre probably needs a certain level of popularity and saturation to pivot to a fruitful exploration of its darkest elements. When Alan LeMay was writing the novel The Searchers in 1953 and 1954, he knew he didn’t need to write like dimestore western authors of a half-century earlier; he knew shows like Gunsmoke were among the biggest hits on radio and TV; he knew films like Red River, The Gunfighter, Winchester 73, High Noon and Shane had been major commercial hits. Director John Ford knew all this as well as knowing his own films that had established his reputation as master of the genre; despite that, Ford had resisted making a western since 1950’s Rio Grande. The Searchers offered Ford something new to say, and for the ninth time he cast John Wayne as his lead.\n\nMaybe there was something to that line in Sunset Boulevard when William Holden says that Darryl Zanuck and Fox were all wet. Wilder, Kazan and Steinbeck kept their distance, and so did John Ford after 1946, refusing Zanuck’s offer of a guaranteed 600,000 dollars a year in order to remain independent. After a decade full of interesting projects to be discussed in later podcasts, The Searchers was Ford’s first film for Warner Brothers, which enabled Ford to work with master scorer Max Steiner for the first time. Ford might have shot The Searchers in the same CinemaScope that Rebel used, but he and his cinematographer Winton C. Hoch chose to use an even newer process called VistaVision, which doubled the amount of photos used for each image and even ran horizontally through the camera, unlike the standard frame-by-frame verticality of most celluloid. This helped Monument Valley appear its most Monument Valley-ish; as for critics who groused that the novel was set in Texas, Ford could respond that he was educating Americans about the fuller extent of 1860s’ Comancheria.\n\nThe Searchers begins in 1868 when Confederate veteran Ethan Edwards returns, after eight years, to his brother’s ranch in West Texas, where Ethan gives his eight-year-old niece Debbie a military medal as a gift. Cattle get stolen from the neighboring Jorgensen ranch and Ethan and local men pursue the thieves. Ethan realizes the theft was a Comanche distraction and when they return to the ranches, Ethan’s brother, sister-in-law, and nephew have all been killed and his two nieces kidnapped. After a long and battle-filled pursuit, Ethan finds the older girl dead and probably violated in a canyon; when asked for details, Ethan grunts, “long as you live, never ask me more.” The Searchers are now down to Ethan’s uneasy partnership with Martin Pawley, whom Ethan calls “blanket-head” and worse because Marty is one-eighth indigenous, and whom Laurie Jorgenson romances during winters when Ethan and Martin lose the trail. By the way, the film is often funnier than this summary suggests. By the time Ethan and Martin finally catch up to Scar and his Comanches, about five years have passed, and Debbie is now 13, played by Natalie Wood, and dressed in Native clothes. Ethan takes deadly aim at Debbie and Marty protects her with his body. Ethan changes his mind and he and Martin take Debbie back to her father’s ranch. As the family reunites and goes inside, in one of the most famous shots of film history, Ethan is left outside as the door closes, suggesting a racist can save a family yet not be allowed to return to it. Andrew Sarris wrote that we think of John Wayne as the “displaced loner uncomfortable with the very civilization he is helping to establish and preserve,” and the ending of The Searchers seems to finally put Wayne on the correct side of the civilization-savagery threshold his characters had done so much to enforce.\n\nThe Searchers is loosely based on the real-life story of Cynthia Ann Parker, who was abducted by Comanche from her Texas home and whose uncle, James M. Parker, spent much of his life and fortune in an obsessive search for his niece. Frank Nugent’s excellent script names the Comanche tribe as the Nawyecka, the same one that kidnapped Parker. As Ford films Nugent’s version, the obvious hints of attraction between Ethan and his brother’s wife suggest that maybe, possibly, Debbie is Ethan’s daughter, abandoned to his brother at birth, a possibility that adds depth to Ethan’s ruthless search and his determination not to let Debbie live amongst Indians – one way or another. The novel ends differently, with Debbie refusing to live with any of them; she is only found by Martin days after she fled the Comanche. One could argue that the Ethan character, on page and screen, is no more or less savage than that of the story’s lead Comanche, Scar, who says “Two sons killed by white men. For each son, I take many … scalps.” But then, Ford makes sure that the real hero of the film is Martin, the mixed-race adoptee who steadily maintains a near-impossible quest while also limiting Ethan’s worst behavior. The actor playing this multi-racial hero, Jeffrey Hunter, was white (if tan); the context there is not only the 1950s but also Jack Warner’s ideas about how much audiences could handle.\n\nRace, rape, and miscegenation are major themes of the film and the Ethan character is a kind of Captain Ahab Goering, as maniacally obsessive as he is racist, far more than audiences were heretofore asked to root for. All of that may account for why many of the film’s contemporaries were relatively unimpressed. While Rebel Without a Cause spelled out its critique of contemporary masculinity in broad strokes, The Searchers, if you squint, seems to laud Ethan’s toxicity. Scholars like Edward Buscombe, and many others, now recognize John Wayne’s Ethan as one of the first real anti-heroes, forefather to characters like Harry Callahan and Travis Bickle, people society may need but certainly do not want. Roger Ebert later wrote, as a compliment, “I think Ford was trying, imperfectly, even nervously, to depict racism that justified genocide.” Somehow, John Ford, while shooting in Monument Valley, squinted and saw further than the horizon, to a time when Westerns and their cowboy heroes would be close to obsolete, and audiences would more fully appreciate a thorough deconstruction of the cowboy’s darkest impulses. The Searchers is now usually cited as not only the best western but one of the ten greatest films ever made.\n\nInfluenced by: then-popular simplified TV westerns, as contrast\n\nInfluenced: anti-hero narratives\n\n“You all think that the glory happened here in the East, don’t you, with Valley Forge and Bunker Hill? Do you know about San Jacinto? Have you heard about the Alamo?”\n\nEdna Ferber was what we would now call an ally. Jewish Ferber never married, bore no children, may have never been romantically involved, and instead focused on her Pulitzer-Prize-winning work, which generally featured strong female protagonists working toward eliminating racism. She wrote the anti-racist stories that were turned into the excellent films Cimarron, Show Boat, andGiant, although the source book of the latter was so, uh, giant as to be considered almost unfilmable. George Stevens took this as a friendly challenge and prepared to use much of Warners’ two-million-dollar budget on location shots in Virginia and Texas. Stevens put the façade of a Victorian mansion in the middle of the Texas plains, simulating the home of the real person on whom Ferber had based her lead character. Stevens didn’t love the widescreen processes he’d pioneered with Shane; he felt images were crisper and more vivid in Kodak’s regular mid-50s color stock, and he chose that for Giant.\n\nAt 201 minutes, the only film longer than Giant on the chronological AFI 100 so far is also set in the South and based on a woman’s popular novel, and in some ways Giant plays as a response. Like Gone with the Wind, Giant begins in a sort of opulent splendor, on a grassy outdoor promontory of a wealthy mansion, though in Giant’s case, we are in Maryland where Bick Benedict seeks a horse. Bick, played by Hudson, finds wealthy socialite Leslie Lynnton, played by Taylor, they have a whirlwind romance, and he brings her back to his Texas family ranch, called Reata. If early in Gone with the Wind Scarlett had married her heart’s desire Ashley and moved him into Tara, perhaps helping Scarlett foster a wiser attitude toward non-white persons, you’d have a story a lot like Giant. Here Leslie helps Angel, a child of one of Bick’s Mexican farmers, and begs Bick to do more for them, which he refuses to do. Instead of Rhett you’ve got Jett, namely Jett Rink played by Dean, who strikes it rich off an inheritance from Bick’s sister, and, like Rhett, tries and fails to seduce the lead brunette. An unwelcome war disrupts all of their lives.\n\nSimilarities to Gone with the Wind end there, because Rhett and Scarlett were concerned only for themselves and daughter Bonnie, who died in a horse accident, while Bick and Leslie deal with their grown kids’ headstrong desires even as Leslie mourns the loss of young-man Angel, who died in war. Jordy, along with his sister Judy, wants a career in medicine and refuses to be tied down to running Reata, eventually compelling Bick to agree to let Jett drill for oil on his family ranch. Jordy begins dating Angel’s sister Juana, and Bick and Leslie’s daughter Luz begins dating Jett even though he is obviously much older. Tensions come to a head at Jett’s Christmas party when Jett refuses to serve Juana, causing Bick to challenge Jett to a fight until he sees that Jett has become too drunk to fight. In a shot that Dean supposedly told Stevens to shoot from further away, to emphasize Jett’s alienation, Jett drunkenly laments his decades-long love for Leslie, while Luz watches and walks away heartbroken. On their way home the next day, a bigoted white diner owner refuses service to Mexicans, and Bick does fight and eventually beat this racist. Back at Reata, Bick laments that his family legacy is falling apart, but Leslie says she’s never been prouder of him as they look at their mixed-race grandchildren.\n\nBy the time Dean played Jett, the self-immolating, anything-can-happen quality of Method Acting seemed to some a facile conceit. George Stevens had barely conflicted with Clift on A Place in the Sun other than to bar Clift’s acting coach from the set. On Giant, by contrast, Dean was so committed to playing Jett in a certain way that Stevens fought with Dean over everything from old-age makeup to scheduling to days spent waiting in 100-degree Texas heat. In more ways than one, Rock Hudson is barely acting when playing Bick’s disgust at Jett; Hudson felt Dean was trying way too hard, and Hudson far preferred the unvarnished naturalism of someone like James Stewart, William Holden, or John Wayne. Liz Taylor, by contrast, was acting Leslie’s disgust at Jett; as with Monty Clift six years earlier, she had become esteemed friends with Dean off camera. Because Stevens’ battles with Dean kept him from a few beloved auto races, on Dean’s last day of shooting, Warners gave Dean a brand-new Porsche Spyder 500. Five days later, Dean drove the car to his death. On the day the Giant set got the news, Stevens asked Taylor to film some anodyne reaction shots, and she never forgave the director.\n\nInfluenced by: Stevens’ humanism; new “epic” imperatives\n\nInfluenced: its timing, at the outset of civil rights movement, worked out well for Hollywood\n\n“But there are times… when suddenly you realize you’re nearer the end than the beginning. And you wonder, you ask yourself, what the sum total of your life represents. What difference your being there at any time made to anything – or if it made any difference at all, really.”\n\nIf American producer Sam Spiegel had truly cared to show the turpitude of white dudes, he might have made an autobiography: it was widely known that he at least hit on underage girls. Back then, his behavior was excused; nothing I’m about to say excuses any of that sort of behavior. After winning the Best Picture Oscar for On the Waterfront, Spiegel wanted something both Oscar-worthy and roadshow-worthy, a prestigious drama with the travelogue elements of his film The African Queen. Spiegel found Pierre Boulle’s award-winning French novel Le pont de la riviere Kwai, or as its British publisher called it, “The Bridge Over the River Kwai,” about the Imperial Japanese Army forcing British prisoners of war to build a railway bridge in remote Southeast Asia. Spiegel hired two blacklisted writers, then living in London, to write the screenplay, and considered just about every A-list director – for example, John Ford, Fred Zinnemann, William Wyler – before dec"
