        "text": "Don Giovanni, The Abduction from the Seraglio, The Marriage of Figaro, Piano Concertos K 482 and K 466, Requiem and The Magic Flute…Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is on the screen and on the stage for the upcoming performances of the The Milan Symphony Orchestra and its Symphonic Choir performing live the music from the iconic movie AMADEUS ,winner of 8 Academy Awards® including best film, actor, director and adapted screenplay,\n\nAmadeus tells the story of the Vienna court composer, Antonio Salieri, and the envy that consumes him when he discovers that divine musical gifts , which he had longed for all his life, were awarded to an obscene, vulgar and naughty young composer, Mozart. Salieri’s envy fuels his plot to destroy the man, while all the while he cannot tear himself away from the genius of his music.\n\nThe Big Orchestra and Choir will be directed by Ernest Van Tiel who conducted many orchestras such as the Rotterdam Philharmonic, the London Symphony Orchestra, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, the national orchestras of Lyon, Barcelona and the Milan Symphony Orchestra\n\nWith the Brussels Philharmonic he recorded the original soundtrack of the film “The Artist”, winner of five Oscars. As a specialist in live orchestra film concerts, he has conducted most of the major films such as Star Wars, Vertigo, Harry Potter and more…\n\nA huge round of applause for the orchestra, an exceptional ensemble of 100 musicians and 40 choristers who follow the images in imperfect synchrony, setting the most important moments to music and capable of following the original voices of the tenors and sopranos remaining in the soundtrack. . I have to say that this series of “pop” concerts held by the Auditorium are undoubtedly one of the most interesting things that have ever been produced on an Italian stage.\n\nDon’t miss next performances Saturday March 16 th at 4pm and Sunday March 17th at 4pm https://sinfonicadimilano.org/\n\nTo buy tickets"
