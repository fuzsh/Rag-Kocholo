        "text": "This page uses Creative Commons Licensed content from Wikipedia (view authors).\n\nThis is a selective list of the works of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, listed by genre. The Köchel catalogue contains a complete, chronologically ordered, list.\n\nWolfgang Amadeus Mozart was prolific and wrote in many genres. Perhaps his best-admired work is in opera, the piano concerto and sonata, the symphony, and in the string quartet and string quintet. Mozart also wrote much work for solo piano, other forms of chamber music, masses and other religious music, and numerous dances, divertimentos, and other forms of light entertainment.\n\nHow Mozart's compositions are listed[]\n\nThe indication \"K.\" or \"KV\" refers to \"Template:Lang\" (Köchel catalogue), i.e. the (more or less) chronological (i.e. by composition date) catalogue of Mozart's works by Ludwig von Köchel. This catalog has been amended several times, leading to ambiguity over some KV numbers (see e.g. Symphony No. 25).\n\nThe compositions of Mozart listed below are grouped thematically, i.e. by type of composition. Not all thematic groups of Mozart's works have a separate numbering that is generally accepted: Köchel only numbers symphonies (1 to 41), piano concertos (1 to 27, leaving out some early transcriptions by Mozart) and a few other groups. On the other hand, for most chamber music and vocal music there is no such numbering (or at least no generally accepted one).\n\nOnly relatively few of Mozart's compositions have opus numbers, as not so many of his compositions were published during his lifetime, so numbering by opus number proves quite impractical for Mozart compositions.\n\nSymphonies[]\n\nMain article: List of symphonies by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\n\nMozart's symphonic production covers a 24 year interval, from 1764 to 1788. According to most recent investigations, Mozart wrote not just the 41 symphonies reported in traditional editions, but up to 68 complete works of this type. However, by convention, the original numbering has been retained, and so his last symphony is still known as \"No. 41\". Some of the symphonies (K. 297, 385, 550) were revised by the author after their first versions.\n\nChildhood symphonies (1764–1771)[]\n\nThese are the numbered symphonies from Mozart's early childhood.\n\nSymphony No. 1 in E-flat major, K. 16\n\nSymphony No. 2 in B-flat major, K. 17 (spurious, attributed to Leopold Mozart)\n\nSymphony No. 3 in E-flat major, K. 18 (spurious, by Carl Friedrich Abel)\n\nSymphony No. 4 in D major, K. 19\n\nSymphony No. 5 in B-flat major, K. 22\n\nSymphony No. 6 in F major, K. 43\n\nSymphony No. 7 in D major, K. 45\n\nSymphony No. 8 in D major, K. 48\n\nSymphony No. 9 in C major, K. 73/75a\n\nSymphony No. 10 in G major, K. 74\n\nSymphony No. 11 in D major, K. 84/73q\n\nSymphony No. 12 in G major, K. 110/75b\n\nSymphony No. 13 in F major, K. 112\n\nThere are also several \"unnumbered\" symphonies from this time period. Many of them were given numbers past 41 (but not in chronological order) in an older collection of Mozart's works (Mozart-Werke, 1877–1910, referred to as \"GA\"), but newer collections refer to them only by their entries in the Köchel catalogue. Many of these can not be completely established as being written by Mozart (see here).\n\nSymphony in F major, K. 75 (GA 42)\n\nSymphony in F major, K. 76/42a (GA 43: doubtful)\n\nSymphony in D major, K. 81/73l (GA 44: doubtful)\n\nSymphony in D major, K. 95/73n (GA 45)\n\nSymphony in C major, K. 96/111b (GA 46)\n\nSymphony in D major, K. 97/73m (GA 47)\n\nSymphony in F major, K. 98/Anh.C 11.04 (doubtful)\n\nSymphony in B-flat major, K. Anh. 214/45b (GA 55: doubtful)\n\nSymphony in B-flat major, K. Anh. 216/74g/Anh.C 11.03 (GA 54: doubtful)\n\nSymphony in G major, \"Old Lambach\", K. Anh. 221/45a (\"No. 7a\")\n\nSymphony in F major, K. Anh. 223/19a\n\nSymphony in A minor, \"Odense\", K. Anh. 220/16a (doubtful)\n\nSalzburg-era symphonies (1771–1777)[]\n\nThese symphonies are sometimes subcategorized as \"Early\" (1771–1773) and \"Late\" (1773–1777), and sometimes subcategorized as \"Germanic\" (with minuet) or \"Italian\" (without minuet). None of these were printed during Mozart's lifetime.\n\nAlthough not counted as \"symphonies\" the three Divertimenti K. 136–138, in 3-movement Italian overture style, are sometimes indicated as \"Salzburg Symphonies\" too.\n\nSymphony No. 14 in A major, K. 114 (1771)\n\nSymphony No. 15 in G major, K. 124 (1772)\n\nSymphony No. 16 in C major, K. 128 (1772)\n\nSymphony No. 17 in G major, K. 129 (1772)\n\nSymphony No. 18 in F major, K. 130 (1772)\n\nSymphony No. 19 in E-flat major, K. 132 (1772)\n\nSymphony No. 20 in D major, K. 133 (1772)\n\nSymphony No. 21 in A major, K. 134 (1772)\n\nSymphony No. 22 in C major, K. 162 (1773)\n\nSymphony No. 23 in D major, K. 181/162b (1773)\n\nSymphony No. 24 in B-flat major, K. 182/173dA (1773)\n\nSymphony No. 25 in G minor, K. 183/173dB (1773)\n\nSymphony No. 26 in E-flat major, K. 184/161a (1773)\n\nSymphony No. 27 in G major, K. 199/161b (1773)\n\nSymphony No. 28 in C major, K. 200/189k (1774)\n\nSymphony No. 29 in A major, K. 201/186a (1774)\n\nSymphony No. 30 in D major, K. 202/186b (1774)\n\nThere are also several \"unnumbered\" symphonies from this time period that make use of music from Mozart's operas from the same time period. They are also given numbers past 41.\n\nSymphony in D major, K. 111+(120/111a) (\"No. 48\")\n\nSymphony in D major, K. (126+(161/163))/141a (\"No. 50\")\n\nSymphony in D major, K. 196+(121/207a) (\"No. 51\")\n\nSymphony in C major, K. 208+(102/213c) (\"No. 52\")\n\nSymphony in D major, K. 135+61h\n\nThere are also three symphonies from this time period that are based on three of Mozart's serenades:\n\nSymphony in D major, K. 204 (based on the Serenade No. 5)\n\nSymphony in D major, K. 250 (based on the \"Haffner\" serenade)\n\nSymphony in D major, K. 320 (based on the \"Posthorn\" serenade)\n\nLate symphonies (1778–1791)[]\n\nSymphony No. 31 in D major, \"Paris\", K. 297/300a (1778)\n\nSymphony No. 32 in G major, \"Overture in the Italian style\", K. 318 (1779)\n\nSymphony No. 33 in B-flat major, K. 319 (1779)\n\nSymphony No. 34 in C major, K. 338 (1780)\n\nSymphony No. 35 in D major, \"Haffner\", K. 385 (1782)\n\nSymphony No. 36 in C major, \"Linz\", K. 425 (1783)\n\nSymphony No. 37 in G major, K. 444 (1783)\n\nFor years this was categorized as a Mozart symphony, but later scholarship determined that it was actually composed by Michael Haydn (Symphony No. 25), and Mozart wrote only the slow introduction for it.\n\nSymphony No. 38 in D major, \"Prague\", K. 504 (1786)\n\nThe three final symphonies (Nos. 39–41) were completed in about three months in 1788. It is quite likely that he hoped to publish these three works together as a single opus, although actually they remained unpublished until after his death. One or two of them might have been played in public in Leipzig in 1789.\n\nSymphony No. 39 in E-flat major, K. 543 (1788)\n\nSymphony No. 40 in G minor, K. 550 (1788)\n\nSymphony No. 41 in C major, \"Jupiter\", K. 551 (1788)\n\nConcertos[]\n\nPiano concertos[]\n\nMain article: Mozart piano concertos\n\nWolfgang Mozart's concertos for piano and orchestra are numbered from 1 to 27. The first four numbered concertos are early works. The movements of these concertos are arrangements of keyboard sonatas by various contemporary composers (Raupach, Honauer, Schobert, Eckart, C. P. E. Bach). There are also three unnumbered concertos, K. 107, which are adapted from piano sonatas by J. C. Bach. Concertos 7 and 10 are compositions for three and two pianos respectively. The remaining twenty-one are original compositions for solo piano and orchestra. Among them, fifteen were written in the years from 1782 to 1786, while in the last five years Mozart wrote just two more piano concertos.\n\nPiano Concerto No. 1 in F major, K. 37\n\nPiano Concerto No. 2 in B-flat major, K. 39\n\nPiano Concerto No. 3 in D major, K. 40\n\nPiano Concerto No. 4 in G major, K. 41\n\nThree Piano Concertos in D major, G major and E-flat major, K. 107\n\nPiano Concerto No. 5 in D major, K. 175\n\nPiano Concerto No. 6 in B-flat major, K. 238\n\nPiano Concerto No. 7 in F major for Three Pianos, K. 242\n\nPiano Concerto No. 8 in C major, \"Lützow\", K. 246\n\nPiano Concerto No. 9 in E-flat major, \"Jeunehomme\", K. 271\n\nPiano Concerto No. 10 in E-flat major for Two Pianos, K. 365\n\nPiano Concerto No. 11 in F major, K. 413/387a\n\nPiano Concerto No. 12 in A major, K. 414/385p\n\nPiano Concerto No. 13 in C major, K. 415/387b\n\nPiano Concerto No. 14 in E-flat major, K. 449\n\nPiano Concerto No. 15 in B-flat major, K. 450\n\nPiano Concerto No. 16 in D major, K. 451\n\nPiano Concerto No. 17 in G major, K. 453\n\nPiano Concerto No. 18 in B-flat major, K. 456\n\nPiano Concerto No. 19 in F major, K. 459\n\nPiano Concerto No. 20 in D minor, K. 466\n\nPiano Concerto No. 21 in C major, K. 467\n\nPiano Concerto No. 22 in E-flat major, K. 482\n\nPiano Concerto No. 23 in A major, K. 488\n\nPiano Concerto No. 24 in C minor, K. 491\n\nPiano Concerto No. 25 in C major, K. 503\n\nPiano Concerto No. 26 in D major, \"Coronation\", K. 537\n\nPiano Concerto No. 27 in B-flat major, K. 595\n\nRondo for piano and orchestra in D major, K. 382\n\nRondo for piano and orchestra in A major, K. 386\n\nViolin concertos[]\n\nMozart's five violin concertos were written in Salzburg around 1775. They are notable for the beauty of their melodies and the skillful use of the expressive and technical characteristics of the instrument, though Mozart probably never went through all the violin possibilities that others (e.g. Beethoven and Brahms) did after him. (Alfred Einstein notes that the violin concerto–like sections in the serenades are more virtuosic than in the works titled Violin Concertos.)\n\nViolin Concerto No. 1 in B-flat major, K. 207 (1775)\n\nViolin Concerto No. 2 in D major, K. 211 (1775)\n\nViolin Concerto No. 3 in G major, K. 216 (1775)\n\nViolin Concerto No. 4 in D major, K. 218 (1775)\n\nViolin Concerto No. 5 in A major, K. 219 (1775)\n\nMozart also penned an adagio and two stand-alone rondos for violin and orchestra.\n\nAdagio for violin and orchestra in E major, K. 261 (1776)\n\nRondo for violin and orchestra in B-flat major, K. 269 (between 1775 and 1777)\n\nRondo for violin and orchestra in C major, K. 373 (1781)\n\nIn addition, there are two works that are spuriously attributed to Mozart.\n\nViolin Concerto in E-flat major, K. 268 (\"No. 6\") (1780) (attributed to Johann Friedrich Eck)[1]\n\nViolin Concerto in D major, \"Kolb\", K. 271a (\"No. 7\") (1777)\n\nHorn concertos[]\n\nMain article: Horn Concertos (Mozart)\n\nArguably the most widely played concertos for horn, the four Horn Concertos are a major part of most professional horn players' repertoire. They were written for Mozart's lifelong friend Joseph Leutgeb. The concertos (especially the fourth) were written as virtuoso vehicles that allow the soloist to show a variety of abilities on the valveless horns of Mozart's day.\n\nThe Horn Concertos are characterized by an elegant and humorous dialogue between the soloist and the orchestra. Many of the autographs contain jokes aimed at the dedicatee.\n\nHorn Concerto No. 1 in D major, K. 412 (1791)\n\nHorn Concerto No. 2 in E-flat major, K. 417 (1783)\n\nHorn Concerto No. 3 in E-flat major, K. 447 (c. 1784–87)\n\nHorn Concerto No. 4 in E-flat major, K. 495 (1786)\n\nWoodwind concertos[]\n\nTemplate:Listen\n\nBassoon Concerto in B-flat major, K. 191 (1774)\n\nConcerto for Flute, Harp, and Orchestra in C major, K. 299 (1778)\n\nOboe Concerto in C major, K. 314 (has come down to us as the second flute concerto, but was almost certainly an oboe concerto) (1777–78)\n\nConcerto for Clarinet and Orchestra in A major, K. 622 (1791)\n\nFlute Concerto No. 1 in G major, K. 313 (1778)\n\nFlute Concerto No. 2 in D major, K. 314 (1778) (An arrangement of the above Oboe Concerto).\n\nAndante for flute and orchestra in C major, K. 315/285e (1778)\n\nConcertante symphonies[]\n\nTemplate:Listen\n\nSinfonia Concertante for Violin, Viola and Orchestra in E-flat major, K. 364 (1779)\n\nSinfonia Concertante for Oboe, Clarinet, Horn, Bassoon and Orchestra in E-flat major, K. 297b (Anh. 9 and later Anh. C 14.01) (Probably spurious arrangement of lost Sinfonia Concertante for Flute, Oboe, Horn, Bassoon, and Orchestra from 1778)\n\nThese were not Mozart's only attempts at the genre; a few other fragmentary works were also composed around the same time, though not completed.\n\nSinfonia Concertante for Violin, Viola, Cello and Orchestra in A major, K. 320e (Anh. 104) (c. 1779, fragment)\n\nSinfonia Concertante for Piano, Violin and Orchestra in D major, K. Anh. 56 (1778, fragment)\n\nOther[]\n\nConcerto for Trumpet, K. 47c (lost)\n\nCello Concerto, K.206a (1775, lost)\n\nPiano music[]\n\nMozart's earliest composition attempts begin with piano sonatas and other piano pieces, as this is the instrument on which his musical education took place. Almost everything that he wrote for piano was intended to be played by himself (or by his sister, also a proficient piano player). Examples of his earliest works are those found in Nannerl's Music Book. Between 1782 and 1786 he wrote 20 works for piano solo (including sonatas, variations, fantasias, suites, fugues, rondo) and works for piano four hands and two pianos.\n\nSolo piano works[]\n\nMain article: List of solo piano compositions by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\n\nDual piano/performer works[]\n\nPiano four-hands[]\n\nSonata for Keyboard Four-hands in C major, K. 19d (London, May 1765)\n\nSonata for Keyboard Four-hands in D major, K. 381 / 123a\n\nSonata for Keyboard Four-hands in B-flat major, K. 358 / 186c\n\nSonata for Keyboard Four-hands in F major, K. 497\n\nSonata for Keyboard Four-hands in C major, K. 521\n\nSonata for Keyboard Four-hands in G major, K. 357 (incompleted)\n\nFugue in G minor, K. 401\n\nAndante and Variations in G major, K. 501\n\nAdagio and Allegro (Fantasia) in F minor, K. 594\n\nFantasia in F minor, K. 608 (organ, composer's transcription)\n\nTwo pianos[]\n\nSonata for Two Pianos in D major, K. 448 / 375a\n\nFugue in C minor for Two Keyboards, K. 426 (transcribed in 1788 for strings as K. 546)\n\nChamber music[]\n\nViolin music[]\n\nHe also wrote for piano and violin. Note the order of the two instruments, for the most part, these are keyboard-centric sonatas where the violin plays a more accompanying role. In later years, the role of the violin grew to not just a support to the other solo instrument, but to build a dialogue with it.\n\nChildhood violin sonatas (1763–66)[]\n\nViolin Sonatas, KV 6–9\n\nViolin Sonata No. 1 in C for Keyboard and Violin, K. 6\n\nViolin Sonata No. 2 in D for Keyboard and Violin, K. 7\n\nViolin Sonata No. 3 in B-flat for Keyboard and Violin, K. 8\n\nViolin Sonata No. 4 in G for Keyboard and Violin, K. 9\n\nViolin Sonatas, KV 10–15\n\nViolin Sonata No. 5 in B-flat for Keyboard and Violin (or Flute), K. 10\n\nViolin Sonata No. 6 in G for Keyboard and Violin (or Flute), K. 11\n\nViolin Sonata No. 7 in A for Keyboard and Violin (or Flute), K. 12\n\nViolin Sonata No. 8 in F for Keyboard and Violin (or Flute), K. 13\n\nViolin Sonata No. 9 in C for Keyboard and Violin (or Flute), K. 14\n\nViolin Sonata No. 10 in B-flat for Keyboard and Violin (or Flute), K. 15\n\nViolin Sonatas, KV 26–31\n\nViolin Sonata No. 11 in E-flat for Keyboard and Violin, K. 26\n\nViolin Sonata No. 12 in G for Keyboard and Violin, K. 27\n\nViolin Sonata No. 13 in C for Keyboard and Violin, K. 28\n\nViolin Sonata No. 14 in D for Keyboard and Violin, K. 29\n\nViolin Sonata No. 15 in F for Keyboard and Violin, K. 30\n\nViolin Sonata No. 16 in B-flat for Keyboard and Violin, K. 31\n\nMature violin sonatas (1778–88)[]\n\nViolin Sonata No. 17 in C major, K. 296\n\nViolin Sonata No. 18 in G major, K. 301\n\nViolin Sonata No. 19 in E-flat major, K. 302\n\nViolin Sonata No. 20 in C major, K. 303\n\nViolin Sonata No. 21 in E minor, K. 304\n\nViolin Sonata No. 22 in A major, K. 305\n\nViolin Sonata No. 23 in D major, K. 306\n\nViolin Sonata No. 24 in F major, K. 376\n\nViolin Sonata No. 25 in F major, K. 377\n\nViolin Sonata No. 26 in B-flat major, K. 378\n\nViolin Sonata No. 27 in G major, K. 379\n\nViolin Sonata No. 28 in E-flat major, K. 380\n\nViolin Sonata No. 29 in A major, K. 402 (fragment, completed by M.

Haydn had just published his set of six quartets, Op. 33, which are thought to have been a stimulus to Mozart in returning to the genre. These quartets are often regarded as among the pinnacles of the genre.\n\nString Quartet No. 14 in G major, \"Spring\", K. 387 (1782)\n\nString Quartet No. 15 in D minor, K. 421/417b (1783)\n\nString Quartet No. 16 in E-flat major, K. 428/421b (1783)\n\nString Quartet No. 17 in B-flat major, \"Hunt\", K. 458 (1784)\n\nString Quartet No. 18 in A major, K. 464 (1785)\n\nString Quartet No. 19 in C major, \"Dissonance\", K. 465 (1785)\n\nString Quartet No. 20 in D major, \"Hoffmeister\", K. 499 (1786)\n\nThis work was published by (dedicated to?)

Allemandes (56 between 1787 and 1791) were written mainly for public balls in Vienna. In the Contredanse production, also written mainly in Vienna, some examples of program music are found, like Il Temporale, K. 534, La Bataille, K. 535, Canary, K. 600/5, etc. Template:Div col\n\n6 Menuets, K. 61h\n\n7 Menuets, K. 65a/61b\n\n4 Contredanses, K. 101/250a\n\n20 Menuets, K. 103\n\n6 Menuets, K. 104/61e\n\n6 Menuets, K. 105/61f\n\nMenuet in E-flat, K. 122\n\nContredanse in B-flat, K. 123\n\n6 Menuets, K. 164\n\n16 Menuets, K. 176\n\n4 Contredanses, K. 267/271c\n\nGavotte in B-flat, K. 300\n\n3 Menuets, K. 363\n\n5 Menuets, K. 461\n\n6 Contredanses, K. 462/448b\n\n2 Quadrilles, K. 463/448c\n\n6 German Dances, K. 509\n\nContredanse in D, \"Das Donnerwetter\", K. 534\n\nContredanse in C, \"La Bataille\", K. 535\n\n6 German Dances, K. 536\n\n6 German Dances, K. 567\n\n12 Menuets, K. 568\n\n6 German Dances, K. 571\n\n12 Menuets, K. 585\n\n12 German Dances, K. 586\n\nContredanse in C, \"Der Sieg vom Helden Koburg\", K. 587\n\n6 Menuets, K. 599\n\n6 German Dances, K. 600\n\n4 Menuets, K. 601\n\n4 German Dances, K. 602\n\n2 Contredanses, K. 603\n\n2 Menuets, K. 604\n\n3 German Dances, K. 605\n\n6 German Dances, K. 606\n\n5 Contredanses, K. 609\n\nContredanse in G, K. 610\n\nTemplate:Div col end\n\nSacred music[]\n\nMozart's sacred music is mainly vocal, though also instrumental examples exist, like the Sonate da Chiesa for 2 violins, double bass and organ, composed between 1767 and 1780. Mozart's sacred music presents a rich stylistic mosaic: Gregorian choral elements meet rigorous counterpoint, and even operatic elements can sometimes emerge. Stylistic unity and consistency is present over all his sacred music work. We include in this genre, for their liturgical character, also the compositions written for the Masonic Lodge, like the cantata Laut Verkunde unsre Freude K623 and the Maurerische Trauermusik (Masonic Funeral Music), K. 477.\n\nMasses[]\n\nMain article: List of masses by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\n\nMass No. 1 (\"Missa brevis\") in G major, K. 49\n\nMass No. 2 (\"Missa brevis\") in D minor, K. 65\n\nMass No. 3 in C major, \"Dominicusmesse\", K. 66\n\nMass No. 4 (\"Missa solemnis\") in C minor, K. 139\n\nMass No. 5 (\"Missa brevis\") in G major, K. 140\n\nMass No. 6 (\"Missa brevis\") in F major, K. 192\n\nMass No. 7 in C major, \"Missa in honorem Sanctissimae Trinitatis\", K. 167\n\nMass No. 8 (\"Missa brevis\") in D major, K. 194\n\nMass No. 9 (\"Missa brevis\") in C major, \"Spatzenmesse\", K. 220\n\nMass No. 10 (\"Missa brevis\") in C major, \"Credo Mass\", K. 257\n\nMass No. 11 in C major, \"Spaurmesse\" or \"Piccolomissa\", K. 258\n\nMass No. 12 (\"Missa brevis\") in C major, \"Organ Solo\", K. 259\n\nMass No. 13 (\"Missa longa\") in C major, K. 262\n\nMass No. 14 (\"Missa brevis\") in B-flat major, K. 275\n\nMass No. 15 in C major, \"Coronation\", K. 317\n\nMass No. 16 (\"Missa solemnis\") in C major, \"Missa aulica\", K. 337\n\nMass No. 17 in C minor, \"Great\", K. 427\n\nRequiem Mass in D minor, K. 626 (completed by Franz Xaver Süssmayr after Mozart's death)\n\nOther sacred music[]\n\nMozart's other sacred music includes:\n\nGod is Our Refuge, K. 20\n\nKyrie in F major, K. 33\n\nScande Coeli Limina in C, K. 34\n\nKyrie in D minor for soprano, alto, tenor and bass, K. 90\n\nThree settings of the Marian antiphon Regina coeli:\n\nRegina Coeli for soprano, chorus and orchestra, K. 108\n\nRegina Coeli for soprano, chorus and orchestra, K. 127\n\nRegina Coeli for soloists, chorus and orchestra, K. 276\n\nTe Deum, K. 141\n\nExsultate, jubilate, K. 165\n\nTwo Vesper services:\n\nVesperae de Dominica in C, K. 321\n\nVesperae solennes de confessore, K. 339 (1780)\n\nKyrie in D minor, K. 341\n\nAve verum corpus, K. 618\n\nas well as four litanies, numerous offertories, psalms, motets, and other mass fragments.\n\nChurch sonatas[]\n\nMain article: Church Sonatas (Mozart)\n\nTemplate:Div col\n\nChurch Sonata No. 1 in E-flat K. 41h (1772)\n\nChurch Sonata No. 2 in B K. 68 (1772)\n\nChurch Sonata No. 3 in D K. 69 (1772)\n\nChurch Sonata No. 4 in D, K. 144 (1772)\n\nChurch Sonata No. 5 in F, K. 145 (1772)\n\nChurch Sonata No. 6 in B, K. 212 (1775)\n\nChurch Sonata No. 7 in F, K. 241a (1776)\n\nChurch Sonata No. 8 in A, K. 241b (1776)\n\nChurch Sonata No. 9 in G, K. 241 (1776)\n\nChurch Sonata No. 10 in F, K. 244 (1776)\n\nChurch Sonata No. 11 in D, K. 245 (1776)\n\nChurch Sonata No. 12 in C, K. 263 (1776)\n\nChurch Sonata No. 13 in G, K. 274 (1777)\n\nChurch Sonata No. 14 in C, K. 278 (1777)\n\nChurch Sonata No. 15 in C, K. 328 (1779)\n\nChurch Sonata No. 16 in C, K. 329 (1779)\n\nChurch Sonata No. 17 in C, K. 336 (1780)\n\nTemplate:Div col end\n\nOrgan music[]\n\nFugue in E-flat major, K. 153 (375f)\n\nFugue in G minor, K. 154 (385k)\n\nOuverture in C major, K. 399 (385i)\n\nFugue in G minor, K. 401 (375e)\n\nEine kleine Gigue, K. 574\n\nAdagio and Allegro in F minor for a Mechanical Organ, K. 594 (1790)\n\nFantasia in F minor for a Mechanical Organ, K. 608 (1791)\n\nAndante in F for a Small Mechanical Organ, K. 616 (1791)\n\nOperas[]\n\nMain article: List of operas by Mozart\n\nDie Schuldigkeit des ersten Gebots, K. 35 (1767)\n\nApollo et Hyacinthus, K. 38 (1767)\n\nBastien und Bastienne, K. 50=46b (1768)\n\nLa finta semplice, K. 51 (1768)\n\nMitridate, re di Ponto, K. 87 (1770)\n\nAscanio in Alba, K. 111 (1771)\n\nBetulia liberata, an oratorio, K. 118=74c (1771)\n\nIl sogno di Scipione, K. 126 (1772)\n\nLucio Silla, K. 135 (1772)\n\nThamos, König in Ägypten (1773, 1775)\n\nLa finta giardiniera, K. 196 (1774–75)\n\nIl re pastore, K. 208 (1775)\n\nZaide, K. 344 (1779)\n\nIdomeneo, K. 366 (1781)\n\nDie Entführung aus dem Serail, K. 384 (1782)\n\nL'oca del Cairo, K. 422 (1783)\n\nLo sposo deluso, K. 430\n\nDer Schauspieldirektor, K. 486 (1786)\n\nLe nozze di Figaro, K. 492 (1786)\n\nDon Giovanni, K. 527 (1787)\n\nCosì fan tutte, K. 588 (1789)\n\nDie Zauberflöte, K. 620 (1791)\n\nLa clemenza di Tito, K. 621 (1791)\n\nConcert arias, songs and canons[]\n\nMain article: List of concert arias, songs and canons by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\n\nRecordings[]\n\nIn 1991, in honor of the bicentenary of Mozart's death, Philips Classics gathered recordings considered to be the best performances from the extensive catalog of their parent company Universal Music and issued a set in a number of multi-disc volumes, collectively called the Complete Mozart Edition, on a total of 180 CDs. These were also made available as a unitary boxed set of the entire collection. The Philips set is no longer in print, but in either format much of it may still be available, primarily from various online sources.[3]\n\nAnother entirely different set of recordings, also available either as multi-disc volumes or in a single unitary boxed set, has more recently been issued on 170 CDs by Brilliant Classics.[4]\n\nReviews of specific recordings are widely available, both at various online websites and in books and other print publications. Many such publications, and in some cases also a selection of CD recordings, will be available from local public libraries.\n\nSee also[]\n\nMozart symphonies of spurious or doubtful authenticity (There is speculation that some of Mozart's childhood compositions were written in part or in whole by his father.
