        "text": "The Eighteenth Century on Film\n\nIn the same way that I am gathering links to works by Eliza Haywood (here), William Hatchett (here) and eighteenth-century erotica (here), I thought I'd gather details of films set in the long eighteenth century, and links to IMDB, Wikipedia or any discussions of the same on blogs by eighteenth-centurists.\n\nI have been meaning to do this for a while, but was finally set in motion by a link that a colleague sent me concerning a discussion of eighteenth-century fashion (here). The link is to a site has a heavy emphasis on eighteenth-century fashion, but does contains some film reviews which I wanted to link to somehow.\n\nLike my other link-posts, I expect this post to grow slowly, but unlike the others I do not aim at a comprehensive list. My aim is to bring together information on films that I—and my students—might like to watch out of interest in the period, or out of interest in the works of fiction written in the period. The selection criteria is not entirely clear yet, but my preference is for recent films over older ones on the same subject, unless the older version is particularly good, and for films that are easy to get on DVD.\n\nLooking online, the most prominent lists I could find were last updated in 1996 and 1999. Wikipedia has a category for Films set in the 18th century, but the list of films in this category is short. There is also this—very slow loading—list of \"18th Century Costume Flicks\" on The Costumer's Manifesto which I found useful, and the Period Movie Review, which has recently gone on hiatus . If anyone knows of any other lists, please let me know.\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe Abduction Club (2002). ¶ Set, Ireland, 1780s.
