Tenney moved to Castine with her mother, stepfather and two sisters in 1975, where she met her future husband and later graduated from the University of Southern Maine. Tenney was employed by the Maine Maritime Academy and became executive assistant to two presidents, Gov. Kenneth Curtis and Leonard Tyler. She loved the beach and vacationed on Sanibel Island, Florida, Playa-del-Carmen, Mexico, Saint Martin in the Caribbean and her beach at Little House on Wadsworth Cove in Castine. She became much attached to her extended family of Tenneys and Youngs and was proud to have been part of the family golf tournament. She had a great sense of humor and loved life and food, beach picnics, her precious cat Mosey, her herb garden, flower garden, her little private pool, Christmas stockings, and her family."
