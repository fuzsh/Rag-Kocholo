        "text": "The purpose of the Washington School Report Card is to share information about our K–12 schools. It is important for you—parents, educators, families, community members, and students—to have information to engage with your schools at the local level. You will see how students at your local school or district performed on our state test, the number of students enrolled, the race and ethnicity of the students and educators in the school community, and much more. I hope this information is empowering. - Superintendent Chris Reykdal"
