        "text": "Access Land Record Search\n\nWhat Land Record Search is\n\nLand Record Search allows you to search for and buy property records such as a title (previously called certificates of title or computer registers), survey plan or other instrument. You can pay by credit or debit card and we will email you the property record.\n\nYou can search for records by address, title identifier, or survey number. You can also use the interactive map to locate a specific parcel of land.\n\nLearn how to use Land Record Search\n\nHours of availability\n\nDelivery and cost\n\nLand records ordered through Land Record Search cost $6 per record. Records are normally emailed within a few minutes of ordering, but this can sometimes take up to 24 hours.\n\nFull list of fees\n\nSurvey and title fees\n\nOur fees for survey and title products and services were updated on 1 February 2022.\n\nRecords you can search for and order\n\nRecord of title (title)\n\nA record of title used to be known as a certificate of title or computer register.\n\nTitle without diagram – shows the current registered owner, legal description, and registered rights and restrictions.\n\nTitle with diagram – shows the same information as a title without diagram, plus a plan or diagram of the land.\n\nHistoric title – shows all interests registered since the title was created, and may include an image of the original paper title.\n\nGuaranteed search – shows the same information as a title with diagram, plus any pending documents recently lodged with Toitū Te Whenua but not yet registered on the title. This is mostly used by practitioners during property dealings.\n\nSurvey plan\n\nYou will receive both title sheet and survey sheets, if they exist.\n\nTitle plan – shows the plan deposited when the title was created. This may be a simple plan showing boundaries, area and dimensions, a detailed survey plan, or a combination of the two.\n\nSurvey plan (CSD plan) – shows detailed survey observations. It may include a simple plan of the property’s boundaries, area and dimension.\n\nInstrument (document)\n\nAn instrument is a document recorded on a record of title that describes a property right or restriction. This includes mortgages, easements and caveats.\n\nCurrent and historic instruments are listed on the title summary page. If the checkbox beside an instrument is greyed out, it cannot be ordered for immediate delivery but you can manually order it.\n\nThe instrument reference is also recorded on the record of title it is registered against. When ordering manually, each reference needs to be named, and each must be ordered separately.\n\nWhat isn’t held by Toitū Te Whenua\n\nMost older records (other than land title documents)\n\nOlder records are now held by Archives New Zealand.\n\nArchives New Zealand Collections search\n\nMāori land records\n\nMāori land records are held by the Māori Land Court.\n\nMāori Land Court\n\nProperty value\n\nTitle and survey records do not contain information about the value of the property, but this information is available from other sources.\n\nFind out about other land record providers\n\nOther property information\n\nToitū Te Whenua does not provide information about property sales and does not prepare due diligence reports. Contact a lawyer or property agent for these.\n\nToitū Te Whenua cannot provide copies of building consents, resource consents or Land Information Memorandum (LIM) reports.\n\nContact your local council\n\nCheck our list of land record locations\n\nWhat Land Record Search doesn’t do\n\nLand Record Search does not provide a valuation of a property, or information on previous or anticipated sales prices.\n\nIt doesn’t infringe on anyone’s privacy concerns. Under the Land Transfer Act 2017, the land titles register is a public record and Land Record Search provides access to the register.\n\nLand Record Search does not let users search for an individual’s name or do bulk searches. When a land record is purchased, it will include the names of owners and other interest holders that are recorded on the title."
