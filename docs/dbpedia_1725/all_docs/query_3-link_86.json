With unparalleled journalistic skill, Toobin has provided analysis on some of the most provocative and important events of our time.\n\nThe author of several critically acclaimed best sellers, Toobin delved into the historical, political and personal inner workings of the Supreme Court and its justices in his book The Nine: Inside the Secret World of the Supreme Court. The Nine spent more than four months on the New York Times Best Seller list and was named one of the best books of the year by Time, Newsweek, Entertainment Weekly and the Economist. His newest book, The Oath, a sequel to The Nine, is an insider’s account of the momentous ideological war between the John Roberts’ Supreme Court and the Obama administration.\n\nToobin is also author of renowned bestseller Too Close to Call: The 36-Day Battle to Decide the 2000 Election, the definitive story of the Bush-Gore presidential recount and the basis for an HBO movie.

Also a staff writer for The New Yorker since 1993, he has written articles on such subjects as the Bernie Madoff scandal, the case of Roman Polanski, and profiles of Justices Clarence Thomas, Stephen Breyer, John Paul Stevens and Chief Justice John Roberts. His article “An Incendiary Defense” for the magazine broke the news that the O.J. Simpson defense team planned to accuse Mark Fuhrman of planting evidence and to play “the race card.”\n\nPrior to joining The New Yorker, Toobin served as an Assistant United States Attorney in Brooklyn, New York. He also served as an associate counsel in the Office of Independent Counsel Lawrence E. Walsh, an experience that provided the basis for his first book, Opening Arguments: A Young Lawyer’s First Case: United States v. Oliver North. His other books also take a behind the scenes look at the legal system: A Vast Conspiracy explored the investigation and impeachment of Bill Clinton; and The Run of His Life closely examined the workings of the criminal justice system in the O.J. Simpson trial.\n\nToobin received his bachelor’s degree from Harvard College and graduated magna cum laude from Harvard Law School, where he was an editor of the Harvard Law Review.\n\n2012 Chancellor’s Speaker Series: Michael Beschloss\n\nIn the wake of Charlotte’s recent triumph as the host city to a presidential nominating convention, historian and author Michael Beschloss outlined the qualities that make a great president in a speech at UNC Charlotte.\n\nHis appearance was part of the second annual Chancellor’s Speaker Series and the 49er Democracy Experience. Beschloss, who has written eight books about U.S. presidents, is the official NBC News Presidential Historian. He also is a regular contributor to the PBS NewsHour and he co-authored, with Caroline Kennedy, The New York Times best seller Jacqueline Kennedy: Historic Conversations on Life with John F. Kennedy.\n\nHis evening lecture focused on what he considered to be some of the qualities found in great presidents. One was presidential courage. Beschloss said George Washington and Abraham Lincoln were “willing to do the right thing, even if it’s unpopular, it may not get them re-elected, or worse.”\n\nAnother necessary trait was excellent oratorical skills. Presidents must be able “to tell Americans about what might be unpopular and get them to accept it.” Beschloss said Lincoln was successful with this in pushing for the Emancipation Proclamation during the Civil War.\n\nAnother skill that is needed is the talent to cross the aisle and work with the other side. “I don’t just mean a Democratic president who’s able to work with Republicans.” A president must have the “imagination to understand why” someone with drastically different views believes in them, he said.\n\nFinally, Beschloss said great presidents have a strong sense of history while making tough decisions, often without the benefit of having all of the necessary information.\n\n“These guys look different decades later than they did at the time,” he said, adding that most historians agree that at least 30 to 40 years must pass to provide the proper context to judge an administration’s policies. “You have to know how the story ends.”\n\n2011 Chancellor’s Speaker Series: Senator Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles\n\nThe event was billed as “Telling it Like it is: an Evening with Sen. Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles.”\n\nKicking off the new Chancellor’s Speaker Series on Nov. 16, 2011, an overflow audience of several hundred of Charlotte’s civic, political, business, and philanthropic leaders were treated to a compelling and entertaining discourse on some of the most pressing fiscal challenges facing the nation.\n\nBowles and Simpson, co-chairmen of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, shared some of their thoughts on pragmatic solutions to America’s debt crisis at the event at UNC Charlotte Center City, the new 11-story, $50 million building in downtown Charlotte.\n\nTo the campus community, UNC Charlotte Center City is considered to be much more than a building. It symbolizes how the University has become an indispensable thread in the social, cultural and economic fabric of the Charlotte region.\n\nIn early 2012, Center City will welcome its first gallery exhibit, commissioned by the College of Arts + Architecture. In the spring, a magnificent exhibit, Violins of Hope, will make its North American debut in the Center City gallery.\n\nThe appearance by Bowles and Simpson came a week before the so-called Congressional super committee’s Nov. 23 deadline. The 12-member supercommittee, made up of six Democrats and six Republicans, must agree on a plan to cut the deficit by at least $1.2 trillion over 10 years or trigger billions in automatic cuts to defense and other federal programs.\n\nBowles and Simpson have pushed the supercommittee to go beyond their mandate and cut at least $4 trillion. Bowles, a Democrat and former UNC System President and White House chief of staff, and Simpson, a former Republican senator from Wyoming, engaged the evening audience with candid anecdotes and comments.\n\n“What Al and I are trying to do,” Bowles said, “is get people to address the real causes (of the debt), to be honest about it, understand that everybody has to put aside their partisan sacred cow and do something big and bold.”\n\nSimpson warned that Washington leaders might be adversely influenced by the fiscal turmoil in Europe.\n\n“The pressures on (lawmakers) are enormous,” he said, “not just internally but because of Greece and Italy and the stuff going on around the world. And we’re on a trajectory … that matches all those countries.”\n\nThe two leaders also spent time on the main campus earlier in the day, meeting with UNC Charlotte students, faculty and staff at the Student Union.\n\n“I love the fray,” Simpson said when he was asked by moderator Chris William to say what motivates him. “I’ve been the toast of the town one day and toast the next day. I just like to mix it up.”\n\nBowles tried to lay down the hard choices facing the nation.\n\n“If we agree to make the tough choices we must make, I think the future is very bright for this country,” he said. “If we don’t, we are well on the way to becoming a second-rate power.\n\n“This is not a Republican deal or a Democratic deal,” he said. “It’s a country deal.”"
