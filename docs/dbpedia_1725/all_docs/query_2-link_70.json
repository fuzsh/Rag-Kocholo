        "text": "Coast and Geodetic Survey Maps: Browse by Chart Number\n\nCoast survey maps can be identified by name and number. Charts with the same number cover the same geographic area; however, some earlier maps on this site pre-date the standardization of a numbering system.\n\nTo learn more about the numbering of coast survey charts, see the book Shore and Sea Boundaries (U.S. Department of Commerce, 1962 and 1964). This book discusses the differences between reconnaissance charts, sketches, and preliminary charts (vol. 2, pt. 2, chapter 1, p. 83), and contains a chart of numbering systems (vol. 2, pt. 2, chapter 1, p. 90). Shore and Sea Boundaries is available online through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration at\n\nhttp://www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/hsd/shalowitz.html.\n\nClick on a year in the chart below to see the accompanying map."
