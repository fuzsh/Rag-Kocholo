        "text": "Message from the board\n\nWe’re thrilled to celebrate 20 years of the Higher Education Web Professionals Association and our work toward advancing higher education. We’ve grown a great deal over the years and saw much of this growth in the 2017–2018 year.\n\nIn 2018 we hired our first employee, Sara Clark, a veteran HighEdWeb volunteer who now serves as our operations director. Through Sara’s work, the organization is able to progress more quickly toward our goals. Last year’s annual conference, held in Sacramento, broke records with sponsorship involvement and engagement with vendors. We also launched a new membership model, which includes institutional memberships.\n\nAs our membership continues to grow, so do our efforts to offer more benefits to our members.\n\nWe’re focused on providing educational opportunities to HighEdWeb members through membership portal offerings. Not all members can make it to the annual conference, and we don’t want that to limit professional development. We’re a tech-focused organization after all, and we look forward to using our skills to support our members with more digital learning. Last year for example, we launched a member Slack space to help you connect with other digital and web professionals around the globe.\n\nHighEdWeb continues to have a mutually beneficial partnership with WPCampus and looks forward to developing more partnerships in the future. Our Link Journal continues to grow and share helpful content with higher ed professionals. Recently, Link published previews of the revised tracks for the annual conference.\n\nTransparency of how the organization operates has been a major focus of our work. It’s important to us that our members understand what happens within the organization, and how the Board of Directors and committees work. Part of this effort has been a focus on volunteer recruitment and formalizing paths for members get involved with HighEdWeb. Increased diversification at all levels of our organization has also been a significant focus for us.\n\nHighEdWeb is comprised of members who care deeply about higher education and educating our future generations.\n\nAs an organization, we strongly believe in that focus and work hard to make resources available to our members so you can thrive in your work environments.\n\nAs we look ahead to the next 20 years of HighEdWeb, we are confident we will continue to empower higher education professionals and positively contribute to our industry. Members like you are what makes our organization so great.\n\nThank you.\n\nTom Wojciechowski\n\nPresident, HighEdWeb Board of Directors\n\nNew directors\n\nThe Board of Directors includes 12 members that represent several different higher education institutions. Three new directors were elected in 2018.\n\nLisa Catto\n\nLisa Catto has managed Western Oregon University’s social media and media relations since 2005. She developed the university’s social presence back when MySpace was still the new kid on the block and has grown it into a robust program supported by a student social media team. She provides campus training on social media best practices, leads the university’s social media strategy, and serves on various committees, including the Emergency Planning Team. She has a BS in public relations from the University of Oregon, a BS in anthropology from Western Oregon University, and is completing a Master’s in archaeology from Portland State University.\n\nLisa has presented at multiple national and regional HighEdWeb conferences. She serves on the Association’s Annual Conference Program Subcommittee as the Poster Track Chair and on the Membership Committee.\n\nAaron Knight\n\nAaron Knight has been with the SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry (SUNY-ESF) since 2008 and is currently a senior programmer/analyst for information systems for the college. Aaron is responsible for internal web portals, course registration, grading and institutional reporting — basically, if it’s not a server and you wouldn’t notice him until it’s suddenly not working and is required for the college to function, he’s probably responsible for it. Aaron holds degrees in computer science and history (BS) and computer engineering (MS) from Syracuse University.\n\nAaron is a frequent presenter at the HighEdWeb Annual Conference, and previously served as a standing member of the HighEdWeb Membership Committee.\n\nJeff Stevens\n\nJeff Stevens has been at the University of Florida since 2001, working on websites for Student Financial Affairs, the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, and UF Health, the university’s academic health center. In his current role, Jeff and his team are responsible for the content strategy for ufhealth.org, representing six teaching colleges and over 150 primary and secondary care facilities; as well as consulting and teaching over 1500 content editors using their centralized systems. Jeff has a BS in history and mass communications from Florida State University and an MA from the University of Florida.\n\nJeff is a frequent presenter at the HighEdWeb Annual Conference, and was the Committee Chair for the Florida Regional Conference in 2013. Jeff also serves on the Annual Conference Program Subcommittee as a graphic designer and as a track chair, and as a staff member of Link, the Journal of Higher Education Web Professionals."
