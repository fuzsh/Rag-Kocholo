        "text": "A Brief Overview of USGS Topographic Maps\n\nUSGS topographic maps fall into three primary product categories:\n\n1. The Historical Topographic Map Collection (HTMC) is the set of scanned images of USGS topographic quadrangle maps originally published as paper documents in the period 1884-2006. Visit Historical Topographic Maps - Preserving the Past for more information.\n\n2. US Topo is the current USGS topographic map series for the Nation. These are modeled on the legacy 7.5-minute maps, but are mass-produced from GIS databases of The National Map and published as digital documents. Please visit US Topo: Maps for America for full details.\n\nUS TOPO PROGRAM UPDATE:\n\nUS Topo map production is transitioning away from a static 3-year refresh cycle. Nevertheless, maps will continue to be updated and published annually. Areas experiencing significant change since the last published map will be reproduced.\n\nClick here see the most up-to-date US Topo production schedule.\n\nThank you for your patience as we make this adjustment to better meet the needs of our users. More information will be shared as we finalize our new production cycles. Want the best available National Map data on a custom, on-demand, USGS topographic map?\n\nClick here to learn about topoBuilder and OnDemand Topos.\n\n3. OnDemand Topos are USGS-style topographic maps created using the topoBuilder application. These maps are generated upon request using the best available data from The National Map and offer customizations such as choice of format, area of interest, and National Map content. Learn more at the topoBuilder landing page.\n\nAdditional Resources"
