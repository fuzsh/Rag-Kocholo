        "text": "About the Book\n\nTeaching methods comprise the principles and methods that are used by teachers to facilitate learning by students. Strategies are determined both by the subject matter to be taught and the characteristics of the student. While todayâ€™s schools encourage creativity, this was not always the case.\n\nAlso in this Book\n\nStudy Guides are books can be used by students to enhance or speed their comprehension of literature, research topics, history, mathematics or many other subjects. Topics that may be contained in a Study Guide include study and testing strategies; reading, writing, classroom, and project management skills. For example, in literature some study guides will summarize chapters of novels or the important elements of the subject. In the area of math and science study guides generally present problems and offer alternative techniques for the solution.\n\nAlso in this Book\n\nLike College Guides, Graduate School Guides are books or on-line services that provide information about graduate programs at various universities to prospective students. In addition to providing basic information about the institutions and fee structures, such guides may provide student feedback on their experiences of life and study at their institution.\n\nAbout us\n\nLeopold Classic Library has the goal of making available to readers the classic books that have been out of print for decades.
