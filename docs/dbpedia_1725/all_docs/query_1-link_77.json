        "text": "How far is it? - Distance Calculator\n\nThis tool enables you to calculate the straight line distance between two locations or two cities, \"as the crow flies\". As you can share your location, it will let you know easily how far you are in a straight line from any point of interest. Here are the steps to use it:\n\nEnter the address or the city of the first location.\n\nEnter the address or the city of the second location.\n\nClick on the \"Calculate the distance\" button.\n\nHow far is it? The result of the geodesic distance calculation is immediately displayed, along with a map showing the two points linked by a straight line.\n\nGeodesic distance calculator\n\nOur formula integrates the curve of the earth to calculate as best as possible the distance as the crow flies. It is extremely accurate, especially for shorter distances.\n\nClick on the button to use your geolocation instead of manually entering an address."
