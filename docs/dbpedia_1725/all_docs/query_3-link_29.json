We developed and evaluated an educational curriculum for pediatricians to improve their knowledge about COVID-19 vaccines and confidence in communicating with patients and families about COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nMethods\n\nFive institutions collaborated to develop an online educational curriculum. Utilizing the collaboration's multidisciplinary expertise, we developed a 3-module curriculum focused on the SARS-CoV-2 virus and vaccine basics, logistics and administration of COVID-19 vaccine, and COVID-19 vaccine communication principles. Surveys administered to clinician participants before and after completion of the curriculum assessed knowledge and confidence; a follow-up survey 1 month after the post-survey assessed persistence of initial findings.\n\nResults\n\nA total of 152 pediatric providers participated; 72 completed both pre- and post-surveys. The median knowledge score improved from the pre-survey to the post-survey (79%–93%, P < .001). There was an increase in providers’ confidence after completing the curriculum, which persisted in the follow-up survey. In the post-survey, 98% of participants had had the opportunity to discuss the COVID-19 vaccine with patients, and most clinicians reported that the modules decreased apprehension some or significantly.\n\nConclusions\n\nThis project demonstrates rapid and feasible deployment of a curriculum providing up-to-date information to front-line clinicians responsible for having complex conversations about COVID-19 vaccine decision-making. Clinicians who completed this curriculum had sustained increased confidence and decreased levels of apprehension when discussing the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nKeywords: COVID-19 vaccine, online educational curriculum, parental communication, vaccine promotion\n\nBefore the authorization of COVID-19 vaccines for children ≥12 years, we formed a collaborative to develop and evaluate an educational curriculum for clinicians to promote vaccine acceptance. The curriculum increased clinician knowledge and led to sustained confidence in discussing COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nAlt-text: Unlabelled box\n\nAs the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has evolved, children have accounted for a large proportion of COVID-19 infections. Early on, children represented 2% to 10% of infections1; however, as mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 virus caused it to be more contagious, there was limited vaccination among children.2 As the Delta variant became the predominant strain circulating in the United States, increased transmission in households from child to adult was noted.3 , 4 As Delta became the predominant variant over the summer and early fall months of 2021, the percentage of cases in children rose to represent a quarter of new infections.5 A COVID-19 vaccine became available for adolescents ≥12 years old in May 2021 and for children ≥5 years old in November 2021, placing pediatricians at the forefront of vaccine promotion.6 , 7\n\nDiscussions with parents about COVID-19 vaccines for children, however, is largely uncharted territory given a number of unique factors. First, the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were the first publicly available vaccines to use messenger RNA technology.8 Second, COVID-19 vaccines were the first vaccines made available to the broader public through the US Food and Drug Administration's emergency use authorization mechanism. Third, the infectious disease transmission dynamics of the virus rapidly changed with each new variant throughout the course of the pandemic. Fourth, COVID-19 vaccine distribution and administration required specific packaging, storage, and handling requirements, as well as monitoring following vaccination.9 For example, many practices did not have access to ultracold storage and thus felt ill equipped initially to provide the COVID-19 vaccine in their clinics. Others struggled with operationalization of a prolonged 15- to 30-minute observation period post-vaccination, while maintaining physical distance. All of these factors had the potential to limit clinicians’ knowledge of COVID-19 vaccines, limit their ability to provide vaccines in their practice, and negatively impact their confidence in discussing these vaccines with families.9\n\nFor these reasons, accessible, accurate, and up-to-date information for clinicians was needed so they could feel equipped to answer parent questions on COVID-19 vaccines. There was also a critical need to create a timely COVID-19 vaccine-specific curriculum for pediatric clinicians. Clinicians are a trusted source of information—the most trusted source of COVID-19 vaccine information for parents10—and by providing a confident vaccine recommendation combined with an understanding of specific parental concerns and empathetic storytelling, clinicians play a pivotal role in empowering parental vaccine decision-making.11 For instance, a strong recommendation from a pediatrician has been shown to be the single most influential factor for vaccine acceptance.12 , 13 While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released COVID-19 vaccine curricula in December 2020, the content was general and the modules were strictly text-based.14 The objective of this study was to rapidly develop and test an interactive, online COVID-19 vaccine curriculum for pediatric providers.\n\nMethods\n\nConceptual Framework\n\nIn developing a systematic approach for this project, the core concepts we considered were disseminating COVID-19 vaccine research and helping clinicians communicate the importance of vaccination to their patients and parents. Wilson et al summarized various frameworks to address dissemination of new research.15 However, most reviewed frameworks targeted researchers or nonphysician audiences or focused on culture and quality.15 We ultimately chose to anchor our approach on Winkler's framework for disseminating new concepts to practicing physicians,16 Lasswell's foundational concept of “who says what in which channel to whom with what effect,”17 and McGuire's concept of input and output variables in his communication and persuasion matrix.18 Applying this framework, a collaborative of pediatric academic institutions delivered COVID-19 vaccine education through interactive online modules to general pediatric clinicians with intent to improve knowledge and confidence.\n\nCurriculum Design\n\nKern's curriculum design process was applied in a step-wise fashion in developing and implementing this learning initiative.19 Given the continuing effects of the pandemic, some steps were completed rapidly or in parallel with other steps.\n\nStep 1. General Needs Assessment\n\nA collaborative was formed in January 2021 among 5 institutions: Children's Hospital of Alabama, Children's Mercy, Children's National, Lurie Children's, and Seattle Children's. Experts in general pediatrics, pediatric infectious diseases, medical education, simulation, and disaster preparedness gathered to identify key areas of focus in the rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic. Discussions with families about COVID-19 vaccines needed to begin early in anticipation that vaccination of children would be indicated as vaccine supply increased, high-risk groups were vaccinated, and pediatric data were obtained. A review of literature related to vaccine education identified what was known and gaps to fill through this educational initiative.20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26\n\nStep 2. Targeted Needs Assessment\n\nWith the rapidly evolving knowledge in the scientific community around COVID-19 vaccines, the group decided to target education to pediatric clinicians. Engaging the target audience—general pediatricians in academic and community practice—in the planning group and curriculum development identified specific areas of need.\n\nStep 3. Developing Goals and Objectives\n\nThe goal of the curriculum was to educate pediatric clinicians about COVID-19 vaccine technology; describe how a clinic could handle logistics, storage, and administration of COVID-19 vaccines; and allow clinicians to practice communication strategies that could promote vaccine acceptance. To achieve this goal, we created three modules. Module 1 covered the SARS-CoV-2 virus and vaccine basics, Module 2 focused on how to implement a COVID-19 vaccine clinic, and Module 3 focused on COVID-19 vaccine communication strategies to use in the vaccine encounter. The modular objectives are listed in .\n\nTable 1\n\nModule TitlePrimary ObjectiveKey ConceptsModule 1:\n\nBasics of COVID-19 vaccinesDescribe the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its variants.\n\nExplain the COVID-19 vaccines and CDC recommendations.Nomenclature, definitions, and facts\n\nRise of SARS-COV-2 virus variants\n\nVaccine effectiveness\n\nEmergency use authorizationModule 2:\n\nCOVID-19 vaccine logisticsDemonstrate best practices in COVID-19 vaccine distribution, storage, administration, record keeping, and reimbursementVaccine logistics\n\nAvailable COVID-19 vaccines in the United States\n\nEnrolling as a vaccine provider\n\nVaccine storage and handling\n\nSimulation guide for a COVID-19 vaccine clinicModule 3:\n\nAddressing vaccine acceptanceDemonstrate best practices in addressing COVID-19 vaccine hesitancyKey principles in promoting vaccine acceptance\n\nOpportunity to practice conversations with two simulated patient cases\n\nRecommended response with highlighted key principles and motivational interviewing techniques\n\nConversation on COVID-19 vaccine equity\n\nStep 4. Educational Strategies\n\nAs the collaborative formed, many ideas related to the curriculum emerged and the members refined the content to ensure relevance to the goals and the audience. With rapidly emerging literature and information about COVID-19 and its vaccines, the authors had to select and prioritize the most relevant curriculum content to deliver to the target audience of pediatric clinicians.\n\nModule 1 covered nomenclature, definitions, and facts surrounding the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the COVID-19 vaccines. This introductory module began by distinguishing the nomenclature of SARS-CoV-2 and the disease COVID-19 followed by a discussion of transmissibility through understanding of the basic reproduction number (R0) and comparison to other diseases such as measles, polio, and influenza. It also included a timeline27 of the COVID-19 pandemic from first case detection to the creation of the first vaccines.28 The next part focused on the development of the COVID-19 vaccines, including the role of targeting spike proteins,29 the viral genome, and the 4 types of COVID-19 vaccines. The final part of Module 1 discussed the rise of SARS-CoV-2 virus variants,30 vaccine effectiveness,31 and emergency use authorization.32\n\nModule 2 covered vaccine logistics and best practices for vaccine distribution, storage, administration, record keeping, and reimbursement. Learners reviewed the COVID-19 vaccines available in the United States and were led through the process of enrolling as a vaccine provider, highlighting training from the CDC14 and eligibility requirements.33 Information on vaccine storage and handling from the CDC34 was compiled into a table, and guidance was reviewed on administration, precautions and contraindications,35 and post-vaccination monitoring. Tools for billing and coding were provided through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, American Medical Association, and American Academy of Pediatrics.36 The module concluded with a guide to simulate a COVID-19 vaccine clinic to maximize efficiency and safety. This guide instructed clinicians in 1) completing the pre-work of logistics, personnel, and contingencies; 2) setting up the simulation with timing, flow, and debriefing; 3) running the simulation, including orientation and execution; and 4) debriefing, with a focus on space, structure, and gathering ideas to successfully execute a COVID-19 vaccine clinic.\n\nModule 3 covered key general principles in promoting vaccine acceptance based on a review of the literature. These principles included leading with listening, tailoring responses to a patient/parent's specific concern, acknowledging uncertainty, using accessible language, not repeating myths, and recommending with confidence.20 , 37, 38, 39 The module provided a summary of motivational interviewing techniques20 and the opportunity to practice conversations through 2 simulated patient cases involving an African American boy with severe asthma and a pregnant mother with an immunocompromised child. The team carefully selected cases to address known racial disparities related to COVID-19, allergic reaction concerns associated with the vaccines, and hesitancy in vaccination during pregnancy and in those who are immune compromised. A brief video presented a parent posing questions. Learners recorded their response via text, audio, or video and viewed a video of a recommended response that highlighted key principles and motivational interviewing techniques. Finally, learners listened to a conversation in podcast format on COVID-19 vaccine equity with Nathan Chomilo, a general pediatrician, medical director for the State of Minnesota's Medicaid and MinnesotaCare programs, and Minnesota's director for vaccine equity.\n\nTo reach the target audience of pediatric clinicians during the COVID-19 pandemic when in-person, synchronous instruction was limited, we selected an educational strategy that involved computer-based instruction and interaction. We delivered three interactive modules with quizzes, videos, and links spaced throughout the curricular content using the Articulate 360 e-learning suite (articulate.com/360) and a Moodle-based learning management system (moodle.org). Learners set up a login and password to access the learning management system and completed the content at their own pace. The content was developed and refined between February and April 2021. The curriculum and modules are available at https://www.childrensmedicaleducation.org/nppcc/login/index.php.\n\nStep 5. Implementation\n\nAs data were collected to demonstrate the benefit of the modules, each individual site worked with its respective institutional review board (IRB). At all 5 sites, the IRBs deemed this study to be exempt, as the research was to review the anonymized results of educational tests. Each potential learner received an IRB-approved information sheet describing the research study.\n\nMembers of the collaborative piloted the modules in April 2021 and provided valuable feedback to refine the content and delivery. Internal grants from each of the 5 collaborative members provided funding for this initiative. The five institutions connected with primary care pediatrics leadership in their local hospitals, affiliated practices, and local pediatric associations to distribute this educational opportunity. Between May and September 2021, providers were recruited by sending an invitation to participate via email to pediatric associations and affiliated practice listservs as well as giving presentations to those practices and associations about the study.\n\nUpon completion of the curriculum, 3 Continuing Medical Education credits and 3 American Board of Pediatrics Maintenance of Certification Part 2 points were awarded to each physician. If a COVID-19 vaccine clinic simulation was performed, physicians were able to earn up to 2 additional American Board of Pediatrics Maintenance of Certification Part 2 points. For advanced practice nurses, 3 hours of Continuing Nurse Education credits were provided. As the pandemic evolved, new guidelines and knowledge regarding COVID-19 illness and vaccines were incorporated into Modules 1 and 2 and delivered to new participants. Every other week, the team met and executed modifications to promote enrollment, including changing the order of Modules 2 and 3, making the continuing education credit information available upon signing up, and emphasizing the option to submit a text response rather than require an audio or video recording in Module 3 to promote completion of all the modules.\n\nStep 6. Evaluation and Feedback\n\nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of this initiative, we administered online surveys to participants before completion of the modules (pre-survey), immediately after completion (post-survey), and 1 month after completion of the post-survey (follow-up survey) (Supplemental Material). The pre- and post-surveys assessed participants’ knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19 vaccines with a 14-question knowledge evaluation tool blueprinted to the objectives and content. The pre- and post-surveys also assessed confidence with 11 questions about self-efficacy adapted from a previous study that utilized a 5-point Likert response (1, “not at all confident”; 2, “slightly confident”; 3, “somewhat confident”; 4, “mostly confident”; and 5, “very confident”).40 The pre-survey also included demographic questions regarding clinicians’ highest level of education (physician, advanced practice provider), years in practice, practice setting (urban, suburban, rural, multiple settings), and proportion of patients in their practice panel who receive Medicaid and who are Black, Indigenous, or a person of color. We obtained this information to ensure we reached a broad, diverse population of pediatric clinicians. The post-survey requested feedback on the modules. The follow-up survey was created to assess persistence in confidence using selected confidence questions from the post-survey. It also included items prompting participants to describe opportunities in vaccine conversations and clinic planning. In an effort to minimize the time required to complete the follow-up survey, we opted not to conduct a repeat knowledge assessment.\n\nApplying Messick's framework for validity, to assess content and the response process, all surveys were piloted through members of the study team and other partners in the collaborative, including educational experts and primary care providers, to ensure clear understanding of the questions and responses.41 Time and the small number of responses limited the ability to obtain further validity evidence on the survey instruments, such as internal structure, relation to other variables, and consequences.\n\nData Analysis\n\nOur primary outcomes were knowledge score and perceived confidence. The proportion of correct responses on the 14 knowledge questions was calculated on the pre- and post-survey for each participant. The median response on the Likert scale for each of the 11 confidence questions was tabulated for both pre- and post-surveys. Comparisons between pre-survey and post-survey were restricted to participants who completed both surveys. Nonparametric summary distributions for both knowledge score and confidence were compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Effect sizes were calculated using matched-pairs rank biserial correlation, where a large effect size is noted at values >0.37.42 , 43 Four confidence questions that were assessed on the pre- and post-survey were also included on the follow-up survey administered 1 month after completion of the curriculum and post-survey. These responses were compared to the post-survey using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test to demonstrate sustainability. Surveys categorized by the learning management system as failed, incomplete, or not attempted were excluded.\n\nTo assess for the presence of selection biases between those who completed both surveys and those who completed only the pre-survey, we compared the pre-survey responses between those who did versus those who did not complete the post-survey using Pearson's chi-square test for select categorical demographic characteristics and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous factors (ie, years of practice, knowledge score, and confidence). All analyses were completed using R software (version 4.0.3; R Core Team, Vienna, Austria).\n\nResults\n\nA total of 152 pediatric providers from 11 US states participated in the interactive educational modules from May to September 2021. Participants had been in practice for a median of 14 years, and most were physicians ( ). Just over half of participants reported working in an urban setting. About one-third reported that >50% of their patients had Medicaid, and about one-quarter reported that >50% of their patients identified as Black, indigenous, or people of color.\n\nTable 2\n\nCategoryVariableN (%)StateAlabama11 (7%)California1 (1%)District of Columbia28 (18%)Illinois11 (7%)Indiana1 (1%)Kansas32 (21%)Maryland9 (6%)Missouri27 (18%)Texas1 (1%)Virginia5 (3%)Washington26 (17%)Practice settingUrban88 (58%)Suburban54 (36%)Rural4 (3%)Multiple settings3 (2%)Unknown3 (2%)Highest degree of educationPhysician130 (86%)Advanced practice provider22 (14%)Percent Medicaid0–25%43 (28%)26–50%28 (18%)51–75%15 (10%)76% or higher39 (26%)Don't know/unanswered27 (18%)Percent Black, indigenous, and people of color0–25%28 (18%)26–50%19 (13%)51–75%21 (14%)76% or higher25 (16%)Don't know/unanswered59 (39%)Years in practiceMedian [interquartile range]14 [7, 21]\n\nAmong the 72 participants who completed both pre-survey and post-survey, the median knowledge score was 79% on the pre-survey and 93% on the post-survey (P < .001) with an effect size of 0.95 [IQR: 0.86, 1.00] as measured by the matched-pairs rank biserial correlation ( ). For each of the 11 confidence questions, there was a statistically significant increase in confidence in the post-survey with large effect sizes ( ). For three of the four confidence questions in the 1-month follow-up survey, the statistically significant increase in confidence persisted as well, except for discussing the risks of the vaccine ( ). There were no significant differences in participant characteristics and knowledge among those who did and did not complete both the pre- and post-surveys. For confidence in discussing the COVID-19 vaccines, most of the comparisons were also not significant (Supplemental Tables 1 and 2).\n\nTable 3\n\nHow Confident Are You in Your Ability to…(N = 72)Median [Interquartile Range]P value*Effect Size† [IQR]Pre-surveyPost-surveyCommunicate with parents about COVID-19 vaccines4 [3.75, 4]5 [4, 5]<.0010.93\n\n[0.81, 1.00]Establish an ongoing dialogue about COVID-19 vaccines4 [4, 5]5 [4, 5]<.0010.87\n\n[0.66, 1.00]Provide COVID-19 vaccine information resources4 [3, 4]5 [4, 5]<.0010.94\n\n[0.83, 1.00]Answer parent questions about COVID-19 vaccines4 [3, 4.25]5 [4, 5]<.0010.92\n\n[0.79, 1.00]Address parent concerns about COVID-19 vaccines4 [3, 4]5 [4, 5]<0.0010.97\n\n[0.89, 1.00]Address specific concerns in Black, indigenous, and people of color populations4 [3, 4]4 [4, 5]<.0010.94\n\n[0.84, 1.00]Talk about the benefits of COVID-19 vaccines for children4 [3, 5]5 [4, 5]<.0010.92\n\n[0.78, 1.00]Talk about the risks of COVID-19 vaccines for children4 [3, 4.25]5 [4, 5]<.0010.94\n\n[0.84, 1.00]Administer COVID-19 vaccine to your patients4 [3, 4.25]5 [4, 5]<.0010.68\n\n[0.45, 0.86]Conduct a COVID-19 vaccine clinic4 [2.75, 4]4 [4, 5]<.0010.70\n\n[0.48, 0.88]Prepare your practice team for vaccine delivery3 [3, 4]4 [4, 5]<.0010.86\n\n[0.71, 0.97]\n\nTable 4\n\nHow Confident Are You in Your Ability to… (N = 44)Median [Interquartile Range]P value*Pre-surveyPost-surveyFollow-up SurveyCommunicate with parents about COVID-19 vaccines4 [3, 4]5 [4, 5]5 [4, 5].248Talk about the benefits of COVID-19 vaccines for children4 [3, 5]5 [4, 5]5 [4, 5].972Talk about the risks of COVID-19 vaccines for children4 [3, 4]5 [4, 5]4 [4, 5].012Administer COVID-19 vaccine to your patients4 [3, 4.5]4 [4, 5]4 [4, 5].605\n\nIn feedback on the modules, 69 of 72 participants (96%) found the modules mostly or very helpful in providing education on COVID-19 vaccines and communicating with parents. In addition, 62 of 72 participants (86%) reported the modules as mostly or very helpful in developing a plan to administer the COVID-19 vaccine in their clinic ( ). When asked to provide feedback about the modules, participants reported positive comments overall, indicating that the information flowed well, was easy to digest, was accessible, was interactive, and was an appropriate amount. Participants also appreciated being able to practice their communication skills. A few participants found that the additional links lengthened the education and desired more specific detail on the different types of COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nIn reflecting on the educational curriculum in the follow-up survey, we received responses from 44 participants. Nearly all (98%) had had the opportunity to discuss COVID-19 vaccines with patients and their parents. For most participants, the modules decreased apprehension some or significantly ( ).\n\nTable 5\n\nDid Modules Affect Your Level of Apprehension\n\nto Discuss COVID-19 Vaccine?N (%)Increased apprehension significantly1 (2%)Increased apprehension some2 (5%)No change in my apprehension4 (9%)Decreased apprehension some25 (57%)Decreased apprehension significantly12 (27%)\n\nDiscussion\n\nPediatricians are well versed in discussing vaccines with families, as immunizations are a key tenet of pediatric preventive care. The global COVID-19 pandemic, vaccines using a novel messenger RNA platform, and the first large-scale deployment of vaccines through the emergency use authorization mechanism have all created barriers for pediatricians in having effective COVID-19 vaccine discussions with families. In addition, vaccine hesitancy is a global concern, and a survey of parents in early 2021 showed a majority are currently unlikely to or unsure about having their children vaccinated against COVID-19.13 , 44 , 45 Given the anticipated challenges, 5 pediatric institutions successfully collaborated to deploy a timely, accessible online curriculum to improve pediatric providers’ abilities to address COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Providers who completed the curriculum demonstrated significant knowledge improvement as well as increased confidence scores. In addition, the large effect sizes demonstrated the impact this curriculum delivered in knowledge and confidence.\n\nSince clinicians, especially pediatricians, remain a trusted source of information during the pandemic, they needed to be informed in a timely manner so that the adoption of the COVID-19 vaccine for a pediatric population could be accelerated. Historically, pediatricians have been familiar with vaccine counseling and conversations with vaccine-hesitant patients with routine vaccinations.44 However, the educational content in this study leveraged existing research on how to promote vaccine uptake generally, such as onsite vaccination, and demonstrated how some of these behavioral approaches can be applied to COVID-19 vaccine communication and administration.45 Providers are inundated with rapidly evolving COVID-19 vaccine information. This curriculum provided succinctly summarized, up-to-date, and interactive vaccine information in addition to leveraging simulation to practice motivational interviewing techniques23 and was well received, with most participants reporting the modules to be helpful. While most of the results were positive, notably, in the follow-up survey participants became less confident about talking about risks of COVID-19 vaccines. This could be due to the fact that many of the participants completed the modules in summer 2021 with the emergence of myocarditis occurring after vaccine administration and lack of clarity around its significance.\n\nThis work has several general limitations. First, our overall sample size was small despite multicenter and multipronged targeting efforts and the addition of enduring education credit. Each of the five institutions used similar language and recruiting methods; however, we did not track the overall number of possible participants solicited so can't report a formal response rate. Second, there were significant time and access barriers for the targeted population, as it was a 3-hour commitment and a new platform for most participants. In addition, due to the pandemic, many pediatric providers were overwhelmed catching up on missed routine visits, further limiting their time. These factors may have led to the significant drop-off resulting in a lower-than-expected completion rate. However, while participation dropped off, large effect sizes indicate that the sample size was sufficient to detect a meaningful difference between groups. Third, this work, including the educational content for best practices in discussing vaccines, was based on what was known at the time and built on other vaccine acceptance literature, though not specifically related to COVID-19 vaccines. We presumed there may be some crossover in concepts and some new challenges. Finally, this work reports preliminary findings of knowledge and satisfaction; nevertheless, it is hoped that widespread availability could have a broader impact that could be measured if we were able to perform longer term follow-up. Although our participants reported a significant change from mostly confident to very confident in their abilities in some areas, it is unclear how this confidence will translate to the clinical setting; future plans include connecting with participants to determine this impact.\n\nThe study design and structure also contributed limitations to this study. First, due to limited time and conscious efforts to minimize contact with participants in a research study, and the structure of the learning management system, we were not able to inform learners of updates to content. This will be a future area for improvement, as we hope it will allow for targeted updates based on timing of participation. Second, our design affected the ability to obtain longer term follow-up data from the learners. Finally, our lack of a control group limits our ability to attribute the findings solely to the modules.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe work described in this paper reflects an agile deployment of an innovative curricular initiative focused on getting up-to-date information to front-line providers responsible for having complex conversations about COVID-19 vaccine decision-making and ensuring these vaccines are available in a thoughtful manner. The project demonstrated that an online platform could be developed, modified, and accessed by providers and that those who completed the experience had sustained, increased improvement in confidence. In the current era and for future pandemics, the platform that was developed and deployed could be adapted for continued impact.\n\nFootnotes\n\nThe authors have no conflicts of interest relevant to this article to disclose.\n\nSupplementary data related to this article can be found online at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acap.2022.09.010.\n\nAppendix. supplementary data\n\nClick here to view.(410K, pdf)Image, application 1\n\nReferences\n\n1.
