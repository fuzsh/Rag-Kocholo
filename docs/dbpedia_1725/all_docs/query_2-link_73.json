Each are distinguished from later printings by the presence of the word \"Extract\" in the chart's title. <br></br> In 1835 the Coast Survey had not fully hit its stride and did not possess printing equipment. This chart was not published in-house but was sent out for printing. It was not until 1844 / 1845 that the Coast Survey printed a chart on their own, that of New York Harbor, in six sheets measuring 63\" x 64\". Lithographed by P. Haas.</br> (Burroughs, Charles A.

Contains sailing directions, and two long elevation views of the entrance to Little Egg Harbor as seen from sea. Key features include: the New Inlet, Round Shoal, Tucker's Island (with <b>Reuben Tucker's boarding house</b> shown as a triangulation point), Brigantine Channel, Brigantine Beach, Great Thoroughfare, Hunt's Shoals, Anchoring Island, and Hatfield's store. <br></br> With numerous depth soundings , anchorages, shoals, and notes on the composition of the sea floor. Electrotype copy no. 2 by Mathiot. Under magnification fine detail is visible assuring the buyer of it's origin as an copperplate (electrotype) engraving. Price when issued was 15 cents. <br></br> Little Egg Harbor township is a township in Ocean County, New Jersey. Originally part of Burlington County, Little Egg Harbor took its name from the portion of a bay called Egg Harbor by Dutch sailors for the eggs found in nearby gull nests. The first known account of the town was made by Captain Cornelius Jacobsen May in 1614. <br></br> This is a scarce, separately issued, rolled nautical chart of Little Egg Harbor, NJ on heavy paper, not the more common folded version on thin, issued with other charts in an annual report to Congress . <br></br> This chart was printed in 1846 from an electrotype copy of the original hand-engraved copper plate, a process the U.S. Coast Survey newly adopted in mid century. As a soft medium, copper plates could only withstand print runs of perhaps 200 copies before the plates wore down. To enable larger print runs, a mold of the original plate was created in wax or another soft medium. Then, using an electro-chemical process ( electrotyping ), the mold was coated with a metal layer, typically copper. Printers were then able to produce output from the new electrotype copper copy, while preserving the original. 1235DetailsU.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey1847\n\nAntique chart of New Haven, Connecticut and New Haven Harbor U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey 1847 LOC:53\n\n$550.00U-S--Coast-and-Geodetic-SurveyAntique-chart-of-New-Haven--Connecticut-and-New-Haven-HarborRare, rolled, separately issued antique nautical chart of <b>New Haven, Connecticut</b> and harbor on the northern shore of Long Island Sound.

Triangulation by James Ferguson and Edmund Blunt in 1833. <br></br> This chart was printed ca. 1847 from an electrotype copy of the original hand-engraved copper plate, a process the U.S. Coast Survey adopted around that time. As a soft medium, copper plates could only withstand print runs of perhaps 200 copies before the plates wore down. To enable larger print runs, a mold of the original plate was created in wax or another soft medium.

Includes Pensacola Bay, Escambia Bay, Garcon Point, Blackwater River, Perdido Beach, Mast Bay, Forster's Island, and Fort Pickens. <strong>Price includes hand coloring.</strong> <br><br> Chart shows the triangulation network employed in an early survey conducted by the U.S. Coast [and Geodetic] Survey in 1849. Changes in topography inland are indicated by hachuring. <br></br> In surveying, triangulation is the process of determining the location of a point by measuring only angles to it from known points at either end of a fixed baseline. The point can then be fixed as the third point of a triangle with one known side and two known angles. Surveying error is minimized if first a mesh of triangles is created at the largest appropriate scale. Then points inside the triangles can all then be accurately located with reference to the triangulation network. 1138DetailsU.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey1850\n\nAntique Rolled Chart of Hyannis Harbor, Massachusetts U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey 1850 LOC:200\n\n$0.00U-S--Coast-and-Geodetic-SurveyAntique-Rolled-Chart-of-Hyannis-Harbor--MassachusettsSOLD <br></br> Fine and quite scarce antique chart of the Harbor of <b>Hyannis, Massachusetts</b> published in 1850 by the U.S. Coast Survey on heavy paper. Contains a list of dangers, a tide table, sailing directions, and two long elevation views of the East and West entrances to Hyannis Harbor as seen from sea. Key features include: Bishop and Clerks Rocks, Point Gammon, Gazette Rock, Gallatin Rocks, Senator Shoal, and Harbor Bluff. With numerous depth soundings and fine topographical detail on the coastal margins. Electrotype copy no. 2 by Mathiot. <br></br> Hyannis is the largest of seven villages comprising the town of Barnstable on <b>Cape Cod</b>. The town is best known as the presidential retreat for the Kennedy clan who spent any available downtime at the family compound in Hyannis Port. <br></br> This is a scarce, separately issued, rolled nautical chart of Hyannis, MA. on heavy paper, not the more common folded version on thin, trimmed paper that was issued with other charts in an annual report to Congress from the Coast Survey. <br></br> Under magnification fine detail is visible assuring the buyer of it's origin as an copperplate (electrotype) engraving. This chart was printed by the U.S. Coast Survey in 1850 from an electrotype copy of the original hand-engraved copper plate, a process the U.S. Coast Survey newly adopted in mid-century and that resulted in incredibly fine detail without the work of re-engraving after every few hundred copies. <br></br> As a soft medium, copper plates could only withstand print runs of perhaps 200 copies before the plates wore down. To enable larger print runs, a mold of the original plate was created in wax or another soft medium. Then, using an electro-chemical process ( electrotyping ), the mold was coated with a metal layer, typically copper. Printers were then able to produce output from the new electrotype copper copy, while preserving the original. 3619DetailsU.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey1851\n\nEarly U.S. Coast Survey Chart of Mare Island Vallejo California U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey 1851 LOC:3\n\n$85.00U-S--Coast-and-Geodetic-SurveyEarly-U-S--Coast-Survey-Chart-of-Mare-Island-Vallejo-CaliforniaAntique U.S. Coast Survey chart of the Mare Island Strait.

Includes extensive sailing directions with landmarks, courses, bearings and instructions for entering Key West via several channels. This antique chart, based on a thorough trigonometrical survey, was released by the U.S. Coast Survey in 1851. Contains literally hundreds of depth soundings. <br></br> A trigonometrical survey of a portion of the earth's surface is conducted by measuring a single base distance, and connecting it with various points in the tract surveyed by a series of triangles, the angles of which are carefully measured. Relative positions and distances of all parts are computed from these data. <br></br> Includes a tide table and very interesting cross-sectional views of elevation of coral heads, (water depth) recorded across several lines on the chart at Sand Key and the reefs at the East Channel. Other noted points include Fleming's Key, Francfort Bank, East Crawfish Key, West Crawfish Key, Mangrove Keys, and Raccoon Key. <br></br> With extensive sailing directions for several approaches to Key West, Florida including: the East Channel, the Main Ship Channel (\"At Night.

This antique chart, based on a trigonometrical survey, was released by the U.S. Coast Survey in 1852. Includes a tide table and very interesting cross-sectional views of elevation of coral heads, (water depth) recorded across several lines on the chart at Sand Key and the reefs at the East Channel. Other noted points include Fleming's Key, Francfort Bank, East Crawfish Key, West Crawfish Key, Mangrove Keys, and Raccoon Key. <br></br> A trigonometrical survey of a portion of the earth's surface is conducted by measuring a single base distance, and connecting it with various points in the tract surveyed by a series of triangles, the angles of which are carefully measured. Relative positions and distances of all parts are computed from these data. <br></br> With extensive sailing directions for several key approaches to Key West including: the East Channel, the Main Ship Channel (\"At Night. Bring the North Stat to range after Key West Light House and stand for it when Sand Key (or Sound Key Light Boast bears S.W. by W.

Coverage on this fine old engraving includes \"Smith's Island\", now Bald Head Island; \"Smithville\", now <b>Southport, NC</b>; Federal Point; Champagne Creek; Zeek's Island, Battery Island and Striking Island. Numerous small waterways are charted including Dozier's Creek, Elizabeth Creek, Dutchman Creek, and Price's Creek. <br></br> Depicts <b>Fort Caswell</b> on Oak Island protecting the entrance to the Cape Fear River. That pentagonal shaped structure, completed in 1836, was designed to house 61 cannon. Fort Caswell was named for Governor Richard Caswell, a North Carolina hero of the American Revolution. A lawyer and surveyor by training, Caswell represented North Carolina in the Continental Congress of 1774 and 1775. As a Patriot officer in the American Revolutionary War, Caswell led North Carolina militiamen in the Battle of Moore's Creek Bridge. <br></br> The chart would have facilitated navigation from the Atlantic Ocean past Cape Fear though the Main Ship Channel to the Cape Fear River and Wilmington through its use of numerous depth soundings, buoy locations, sandbars, isobaths, and bearing lines. <br></br> This is a scarce, separately issued, rolled nautical chart of Cape Fear, NC on heavy paper, not the more common folded version on thin, trimmed paper that was issued by the Coast Survey with other charts in an annual report to Congress. With the circular logo of the Coast Survey Office. Price when issued was 15 cents. <br></br> Very fine detail on the chart and lack of attribution to electrotype reproduction suggest that this chart is based on the Coast Survey's original hand-engraved copper plate . 853DetailsU.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey1853\n\nAntique engraved nautical chart of the entrance to San Diego, California U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey 1853 LOC:0\n\n$0.00U-S--Coast-and-Geodetic-SurveyAntique-engraved-nautical-chart-of-the-entrance-to-San-Diego--CaliforniaSOLD<br></br> Engraved antique nautical chart of the entrance to San Diego Bay, in California on a large sheet of heavy paper with no folds .

Shows Bird Island at bottom left and Lake Champagne to the right, today after erosion, no longer inland- called Bay Champagne. The pass shown on the chart no longer exists, it is closed and maritime traffic utilizes Belle Pass which lies to the west of the Pass Fourchon. The old Pass Fourchon channel is used to access Port Fourchon. <br></br> Port Fourchon is located about 60 miles SSW of New Orleans, Louisiana.

Coverage includes Staten Island, the Hudson River, Newark Bay, and the Rockaway Peninsula. Produced under the direction of A.D. Bache, a great-grandson of Benjamin Franklin (Guthorn, 1984). The chart is based on triangulation of J. Ferguson and E. Blunt. <br></br> This chart is even more scarce and unusual because of its provenance and because it is a folding chart. The chart was dissected into 8 sections and mounted to linen at the time it was issued. Folded the chart measures 8\" x 14\". Separately issued by the U.S. Coast Survey in 1866 for use at sea, this chart is NOT the commonly found Coast Survey sketch/chart on thin paper. <br><br/> This chart has an interesting provenance as it carries the manuscript signature of Charles DW Brownell, Bristol, Rhode Island on the inside front cover. Charles deWolf Brownell (1822 - 1909) was born in Providence Rhode Island, educated in the law, and later settled on a career as an artist for health reasons. Brownell travelled widely to Cuba, the Carribean and Europe. He is best known for his landscapes but produced several paintings of maritime subjects including \"The Burning of the Gaspee\".

Electrotype Copy No. 5. (1) U.S.C.G.S. Chart No. 490. <br><br> (1) Electrotyping is a reprographic printmaking method that was especially important in the 19th century, as it allowed for high-quality, high-volume reproduction of texts and images. Electrotype printing involves creating a metal plate via electroplating for printing. The process starts by forming a mold of the original work with a soft material like wax. This mold is dusted with graphite powder for conductivity, then submerged in a copper sulfate solution. An electric current is applied, causing copper ions to deposit onto the mold. The process continues until a sufficient copper layer forms. The new copper shell or 'electrotype' is separated from the mold and its back is filled with a type metal like lead for strength. <br><br> After cooling, the electrotype is finished and trimmed for use. It is inked and pressed against paper to produce prints of the original plate. This process was significant in the 19th century for high-quality, high-volume reproduction. 4804DetailsU.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey1894\n\nAntique MS engineering drawing of screw-pile day-mark beacon U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey 1894 LOC:55\n\n$450.00U-S--Coast-and-Geodetic-SurveyAntique-MS-engineering-drawing-of-screw-pile-day-mark-beaconFine late 19th-century manuscript engineering drawings of a screw-pile day-beacon designed for the Tobago Middle Ground shoal in the Rappahannock River, Virginia. Probably a product of the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey. Dated within to 1894. Baltimore, Maryland. <br></br> Manuscript pencil notations: \"Not used\" and \"Historical\". <br></br> In a 1896 letter to Congress transmitting estimates of appropriations from the Secretary of the Treasury is a line item for $3,000 for \"Establishing a day beacon on or near the Tobago Middle Ground, Rappahannock River, Virginia.\" A note below the item states: \"The middle ground has but four feet of water on it. A prominent mark would be a valuable aid in the navigation of that part of the river.\" Apparently this request derived from the Lighthouse Board who proposed to build a screw-pile beacon at Tobago as early as 1893. <br></br> Our drawing, from 1894, is annotated with the words \"not used\". That may very well be because a less expensive solution was adopted.

J.E. Hilgard, (Washington, DC: United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, 1883) <br></br> This antique chart of the north Florida coast was printed in 1900 from an electrotype copy of the original hand-engraved copper plate, a process the U.S. Coast Survey first adopted around 1850. As a soft medium, copper plates could only withstand print runs of perhaps 200 copies before the plates wore down. To enable larger print runs, a mold of the original plate was created in wax or another soft medium. Then, using an electro-chemical process ( electrotyping ), the mold was coated with a metal layer, typically copper. Printers were then able to produce output from the new electrotype copper copy, while preserving the original. Electrotype copy no. 1. 689DetailsU.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey1901\n\nCasco Bay, Maine U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey 1901 LOC:0\n\n$0.00U-S--Coast-and-Geodetic-SurveyCasco-Bay---MaineSOLD. <br></br> Original old, rolled antique sea chart of the inside passages for Casco, Bay Maine that has seen usage afloat based on the light pencil course plot lines. This large old navigation chart on heavy paper, first published in 1870 by the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, carries the patina of age while retaining almost all its original beauty. Numerous lights and aids to navigation are captured along with a host of nautical hazards: Temple's Ledge, Ram Island Ledge, Halibut Rocks, Dick's Shoal, Sisters Ground, and many more. Lots of opportunity to run aground… or worse. <br></br> Coverage includes the geographical features of Cape Elizabeth, Peak's Island, Cushing Island, Luckse's Sound, Presumscott River, Fort Gorges, Fort Preble, Fort Scammel, Portland Head Light, Whaleboat Island, Great Chebeag Island, Quohog Bay, Crotch Island, Cape Small, Maquoit Bay, Bald Head, Sebascodegan Island, Harpswell Neck, New Meadows River.

This old chart covers the numerous bays, coves, and idyllic islands that dot the coast to the south and to the east of Bath, Maine. <br></br> Two interesting features add value to the chart. The first is a location defined as \"Ancient Augusta 1717 - 1721\" but near the mouth of Cape Small Harbor well south of present-day Augusta, Maine. The second interesting feature, identified as \"Ancient Fort George\", lies directly to the west of Fort Popham, in the area of Sabino Head. That reference to Fort George is apparently Fort St. George, part of a very early English colonial settlement of Popham recently 'rediscovered' in 1994. The colony (also called the Sagadahoc Colony) was founded in 1607, 13 years before the Plymouth Colony and it has been called \"the cornerstone in the foundation of English America\". ( Reference: www.smithsonianmag.com/history/maines-lost-colony-106323660/?no-ist=&page=1 ) <br></br> Geographical features include: Merry Meeting Bay, Georgetown Island, Linekins Bay, Montseag Bay, Southport Island, Seguin Island, Hockomock Bay, Mount Pisgah, and Robin Hood Cove. Noted population centers include: Bath, Woolwich, Winnegance, Drummore Mills, Phillipsburg Center, Parker's Head Village, Wicasset, and Boothbay Harbor, Maine.

Published by the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey. Contains 93 pages of text plus an index. <br><br/> In its early history some portions of the 'inside route' were owned and dredged by private entities who charged a toll to vessels for passage, sometimes by stringing a chain across narrow passages to restrict traffic flow. After 1919 Congress mandated that the entire passage should be turned over to the Federal government and the tolls were eliminated. <br><br/> The sailing directions for Bayou St. John describe a moment in time that New Orleans residents can only imagine today: <dir class=\"indenttextblock\">The channel at the entrance is protected by training walls on each side. Spanish Fort is a pleasure resort at the mouth of Bayou St. John and is connected with New Orleans by an electric car line... Small craft of all kinds use the bayou as far as Esplanade Street, about 2 3/4 miles above the entrance, but pleasure boats rarely go above that point.\" </dir> Size of each chart when folded is approximately 8\" x 5\". The pilot's lithographed working navigational charts capture the full extent of the southern U.S. Inside Route in detail.

Price when issued was 20 cents. <BR> </BR> A bit of research shows that in its early history some portions of the inside route were owned and dredged by private entities who charged a toll to vessels for passage, sometimes by stringing a chain across narrow passages to restrict traffic flow. In fact, chart 7 contains manuscript pencil annotations, obviously made during a voyage, of \"Toll\" and \"Toll chain\" that reflects that little-known fact. Interestingly, the toll chains are not noted as part of the official chart. After 1919 Congress mandated that the entire passage should be turned over to the Federal government and the tolls were eliminated.<BR> </BR> Size of each chart when folded is approximately 8\" x 5\".
