        "text": "Bio\n\n“I believe that strong academic advising is the key to a cohesive and meaningful Berea College experience. Advisors help students understand how their general education courses and electives re-enforce and strengthen their interests and academic major. Advisors are also the conduit between academic programs and various other departments and programs on campus that encompass the Berea College experience. As the Coordinator of Advising, I hope to provide resources and tools for our academic advisors to aid in their development in this crucial role. I also hope to strengthen the thread that unites academic advising with other departments on campus such as: the Labor Program; the Center for Internships and Career Development; and the Center for International Education just to name a few.” —Mary Robert Garrett\n\nMary Robert Garrett earned her B.A. in Chemistry, with a minor in French, from Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota in 2002. She earned her Ph.D. in organic chemistry from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill under Jeff Johnson in 2007 developing new chemical reactions. Immediately after graduation, Mary Robert began teaching in a tenure-track assistant professor position at Centenary College in Shreveport, Louisiana. When a position in organic chemistry opened up at Berea College in 2009, she seized the opportunity to move back to Kentucky and enthusiastically support the College’s mission. Mary Robert has taught both introductory and advanced chemistry courses, as well as team-taught interdisciplinary courses in the summer Berea Bridge-In Program, such as, “The Science of Identity,” and “The Chemistry of Art.” Mary Robert strives to make chemistry classes inviting and approachable for non-chemists, so she has incorporated activities in her lectures, such as the chemistry of brass etching, or green (environmentally-friendly) chemistry techniques and practices. Mary Robert earned promotion and tenure from Berea College in 2014 and held a research associate sabbatical position at the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom, during the 2016-2017 academic year, supported by an Appalachian College Association faculty fellowship. Mary Robert has worked with a number of students in faculty-mentored research projects, most recently focusing on the improvement of solar panel materials in an effort to achieve renewable energy.\n\nCoordinator of Advising Responsibilities\n\nAs the Coordinator of Advising, Dr. Mary Robert Garrett provides support, oversight, and assessment of advising at Berea. Primary responsibilities include:\n\ntraining faculty advisors,\n\ndeveloping and maintaining academic advising resources,\n\ncultivating an integrated academic advising model,\n\nensuring that academic advising is aligned with best practices and initiatives in all areas of the College, particularly those in the Office of Internships and Career Development and the Labor Program,\n\ndeveloping a program and resources to educate staff and labor supervisors about key curricular touchstones and academic policies essential for student success.\n\nThe Coordinator reports to and works closely with Dr. Scott Steele, Provost."
