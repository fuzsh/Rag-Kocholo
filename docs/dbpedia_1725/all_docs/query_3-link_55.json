        "text": "As land along the coast and rivers has been purchased over the past century, access to the water has become increasingly difficult. Local shellfish harvesters, kayakers, and swimmers alike identify a place to get to the water as one of their biggest challenges. For this reason the Land Trust works to create and protect waterfront access for the public whenever possible.\n\n250th Park is a ¼-acre easement on Maine Street in Brunswick across from Fort Andross. Part of the easement is in a natural state and part is maintained as a public park with gravel paths, lawn, and park benches.\n\nThe Cathance River Nature Preserve is a 230 acre easement property that runs adjacent to the Cathance River in Topsham and provides over 5 miles of trails.\n\nHead of Tide Park is located at the highest tidal reach of the Cathance River, and became Topsham’s first waterfront park through a partnership between the Land Trust and the Town of Topsham.\n\nThe Little River Preserve is a 4.7 acre fee property located on Rt. 196 at the boundary between Topsham and Lisbon.\n\nThe Rogers Property is a 32-acre easement property with 1,300 feet of undeveloped shoreline on the Cathance River. The property contains a small network of trails, including the Cathance River Trail.\n\nThe Smart Property is a 3.2 acre property on the banks of the Androscoggin River, a few blocks from the heart of downtown Topsham. It has been the home of the Town Landing Trail since 2016, and was conveyed to BTLT for permanent protection in 2018.\n\nTarbox Preserve is a 121-acre property with upland forests, fields, active vernal pools, wetlands, and over 4,000 feet of river frontage between the Cathance and Muddy Rivers."
