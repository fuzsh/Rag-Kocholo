Emergency transmissions, such as during floods, may be more frequent. Get notifications for changes in water conditions based on thresholds you choose. USGS science supports national priorities and local communities from coast-to-coast.\n\nWe monitor, assess, map, and conduct targeted scientific research so that policy makers and the public have the understanding they need to address complex environmental, natural resource, and public safety issues."
