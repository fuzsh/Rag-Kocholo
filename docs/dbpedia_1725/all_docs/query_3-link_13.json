        "text": "Four years ago, I ran into a guy in a doctor’s office waiting room who told me that for most of his life, there were two things of which he was most proud:\n\nHe had been a Marine, and he had been a journalist.\n\n“Now I just tell people I was a Marine,” he said, shaking his head.\n\nSeveral recent events made me think back to that former Marine, and his dim view of what has happened to the once great profession of journalism.\n\nBack when I was a cub reporter in the early 1970s, a good share of the people on those lists of richest Americans were publishers. Not so today. “Newsweek” sold for $1 a couple years ago, and a Mexican billionaire had to rescue the New York Times. I can’t imagine what it would be like to be starting out in the business today, when the Internet has hollowed out most of our once-powerful industry.\n\nWatergate reporter Bob Woodward came to our town a couple weeks ago to give a speech, and I was amused to see that he was described to readers up high in one news story as the man portrayed by Robert Redford in the movie about Watergate. Man, what these kids don’t know, nowadays.\n\nThe news coverage of Woodward’s speech focused on his role in uncovering Watergate, and his opinion of the gridlock that exists in Washington today. None of the coverage I could find, however, dealt with his opinion of the state of the news media today.\n\nIn the summer of 1973, the Senate Watergate hearings went on for weeks, and folks were glued to their televisions. There was no bigger story than Watergate in the newspapers, on radio and television, and in the weekly news magazines. Every startling revelation made big headlines, and they just kept on coming, until August of 1974, when Nixon resigned.\n\nJournalism in America was a force to be reckoned with, and every cub reporter wanted to be the next Bob Woodward or Carl Bernstein. I was thrilled when I landed a job on a newspaper, and didn’t care one bit that it paid barely over minimum wage. My most prized possession was my job.\n\nBut, look at what that profession has become.\n\nIn just the last month, we have seen one of the architects of Obamacare admit, on camera, that it was necessary to mislead the economically ignorant American people in order to pass the massive health care overhaul. For a couple weeks, new videos of Jonathan Gruber talking about hoodwinking the American public kept coming out.\n\nAnd yet the television networks (with the exception of Fox) and big newspapers uniformly ignored that blockbuster revelation. Compare that to MSNBC’s coverage of lane closures on the George Washington Bridge, and a Republican governor, that went on for months. And imagine how those major media outlets would have handled a Bush (either one) adviser admitting to misleading the public. (Remember David Stockman, and his trip to the “woodshed” in the Reagan administration?)\n\nWere it not for the much maligned Fox News, do you think those Gruber videos would have reached the American people? How can you escape the conclusion that most in the mainstream media are liberals protecting a Democrat in the White House?\n\nJust last week, Sen. Chuck Schumer — one of the most powerful Democrats — said his party erred in pursuing health care as its main priority, instead of addressing the economy. That was news on Fox, but received scant coverage on other mainstream media outlets, where protecting a Democrat president is paramount.\n\nBenghazi, the IRS scandal, Fast and Furious, lost emails that have since been found, rampant stonewalling — there is so much grist for the mill for modern-day Woodwards and Bernsteins, but so little interest if it isn’t a Republican in the crosshairs.\n\nI know people in the business who insist that media bias does not exist, but it is usually because they — like the vast majority in the business — are liberals. They just can’t see it.\n\nAnd I understand perfectly why that ex-Marine no longer lists “journalist” among those things of which he is most proud.\n\nContact Dave Simpson at davesimpson145@hotmail.com."
