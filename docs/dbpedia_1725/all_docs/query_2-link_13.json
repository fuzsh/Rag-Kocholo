Implementation delayed by lack of suitable instruments and by War of 1812 until 1816, when survey of New York Harbor began under direction of Ferdinand Rudolph Hassler as Superintendent of the Survey of the Coast. Survey work suspended, April 29, 1818, pursuant to act of April 14, 1818 (3 Stat. 425), which repealed such portions of the act of 1807 as permitted civilians to conduct surveys. Functions (\"work and instruments\") transferred to Department of the Navy, which engaged in disconnected surveys at points along the coast. The U.S. Army also conducted surveys as part of its military mapping and fortification activities. The Survey of the Coast was revived, under Treasury aegis, by an act of July 10, 1832 (4 Stat. 571). By direction of President Andrew Jackson, transferred to Navy Department, March 11, 1834; and returned to Treasury Department, March 27, 1836.
