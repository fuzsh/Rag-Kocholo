Since its foundation in its present form in 1970, it has been part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), of the United States Department of Commerce.\n\nUS Coast and Geodetic Survey (1878-1970)\n\nimage by Miles Li, 28 February 2004\n\nOld Glory blue with white disc bearing a red equilateral triangle.\n\nMiles Li, 28 February 2004\n\nI have an old postage stamp celebrating the US Coast and Geodetic Survey's 150th anniversary, 1807-1957. It shows a dark flag with a white circle in the center which contains a triangle. It's all black and white (actually blue and white), so I can't tell the exact colors, but the triangle is lighter than the field.\n\nNathan Lamm, 26 November 2002\n\nThe stamp may not be precisely accurate. Old USN flag books show the points of the triangle touching the circumference of the circle.\n\nJoe McMillan, 26 November 2002\n\nIt was the same as the flag of the modern National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, minus the central circle with the seagull. In other words, dark blue field, white circle, red triangle. The red triangle was emblematic of the triangulation methods used in surveying.\n\nJoe McMillan, 26 November 2002\n\nDirector\n\nimage by Miles Li, 28 February 2004\n\nIn National Geographic 1917, Old Glory blue with a white isosceles triangle, not quite equilateral, its long end pointing towards the fly.\n\nMiles Li, 28 February 2004\n\nimage by Joe McMillan, 29 August 1999\n\nIn National Geographic 1934, this flag is Old Glory blue with a white equilateral triangle, and two white stars, one at each side.\n\nMiles Li, 28 February 2004\n\nPennant\n\nimage by Joe McMillan, 29 August 1999"
