        "text": "Principal Investigators A - B\n\nMd. Mahiuddin Ahmed, PhD\n\nDr. Ahmed is a Research Assistant Professor in the Department of Neurology, theUniversity of Colorado Alzheimer’s and Cognition Center (CUACC), and the Linda Crnic Institute for Down Syndrome on the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. Dr. Ahmed’s long-term research goal is to develop drug treatments for people with Down syndrome and/or Alzheimer’s Disease. Dr. Ahmed’s recent research findings show that treatment with Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF) improves both learning and memory and brain pathologies in the Dp16 mouse model of Down syndrome and improves learning and memory in aged wild-type mice. His current research is focused on determining the effects of GM-CSF treatment on learning and memory, amyloidopathy, tauopathy, and neuroinflammation in the aged TgF344-AD rat model of Alzheimer’s disease, and on investigating whether GM-CSF treatment reduces SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated mortality in a transgenic mouse model of COVID-19.\n\nEnrique Alvarez, MD, PhD\n\nDr. Alvarez’s research interests include optimizing treatment decisions for patients with multiple sclerosis and related diseases and especially in clinical studies involving immunotherapy for the treatment of this disease. Additionally, Dr. Alvarez is interested in biomarkers to improve treatment decisions and diagnosis of neuroimmunological diseases.\n\nAmy W. Amara, MD, PhD\n\nDr. Amara’s research interests include investigation of the impact of exercise and other non-pharmacological interventions on sleep, cognition, and motor outcomes in people with Parkinson’s disease (PD). She is also interested in the influence of deep brain stimulation and other therapies on sleep in PD. Dr. Amara’s lab also studies the effects of sleep on longitudinal cognitive changes in PD and how neuroinflammation may influence these changes. In addition, she has served as site investigator for multi-site studies evaluating biomarkers and investigational therapies in patients with Parkinson’s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies.\n\nAlan Anderson, MD (Professor Emeritus)\n\nDr. Anderson’s research is focused on stroke prevention and the cognitive and emotional effects of stroke. He assesses neurobehavior in patients with focal cerebrovascular lesions and vascular dementia.\n\nDavid B. Arciniegas, MD\n\nMy academic and clinical work as a subspecialist in Behavioral Neurology & Neuropsychiatry over the last three decades has focused principally on the structural and functional neuroanatomy, clinical assessment, and treatment of the cognitive, emotional, and behavioral sequelae of traumatic brain injury (TBI), other acquired brain injuries, neurodegenerative disorders, and mood and psychotic disorders. My research employs multimodal clinical assessments, including neuropsychological, magnetic resonance imaging, electrophysiological, and neurogenetic testing, and the integration of such assessments into single- and multi-center clinical trials focused on the diagnosis, pharmacotherapy, and psychosocial treatment of cognitive and non-cognitive neuropsychiatric consequences of these conditions.\n\nSana Aslam, DO\n\nDr. Aslam's research interests include understanding the use of deep brain stimulation in movement disorders to improve clinical outcomes. She is also interested in the role exercise plays in Parkinson's patients with deep brain stimulation in improving motor and non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease.\n\nAlexandra Atwood, MD\n\nAlexandra Atwood's research interests include barriers to receiving care in patients with non-epileptic seizures, as well as neuropsychological outcomes in post surgical epilepsy patients.\n\nDelia Bakeman, DO\n\nDr. Bakeman’s research interests include novel therapeutics for severe traumatic brain injury, bridging the gap from hospital to community for neurorehabilitation services and access, and the impact of early neuropsychiatric intervention on recovery and prognosis.\n\nAlexander Baumgartner, MD\n\nDr. Baumgartner’s research interest is in non-motor Parkinson disease symptoms, with a particular focus on how these symptoms might be affected by advanced therapies, including deep brain stimulation (DBS). He has recently completed a pilot project using the Medtronic Percept IPG’s local field potential sensing capabilities to record sleep in the home environment. He is now using other wearable devices to monitor sleep quality before and after DBS implantation to better understand how DBS alters sleep structure and quality. Finally, he is working to understand how certain event-related potentials might be used as biomarkers of freezing of gait and cognitive impairment in Parkinson disease.\n\nEce Bayram, MD, PhD\n\nMy work is focused on sex, gender, ethnicity and race differences in neurodegenerative Parkinsonian diseases, funded by the NIH and Lewy Body Dementia Association, and also outreach and education to raise awareness, support the community, and improve representation. I volunteer for several local and international programs for outreach and education and serve in leadership roles in International Parkinson and Movement Disorders Society, Alzheimer's Association ISTAART, and Lewy Body Dementia Association.\n\nJeffrey L. Bennett, MD, PhD\n\nOptic Neuritis. Optic neuritis (ON) is the most common clinically-isolated demyelinating syndrome, and is the presenting feature in approximately 25% of individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS). Dr. Bennett is attempting to identify the primary target of the humoral immune response in ON and MS. His laboratory utilizes a RT-PCR protocol to amplify the expressed variable-region sequences of single B-lymphocytes and plasma cells isolated from ON CSF by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. The B-lymphocyte and plasma cell heavy- and light-chain pairings found in vivo are reconstituted in vitro to produce a panel of recombinant monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) whose specificity is determined by immunocytochemistry, immunoblotting, and screening of white matter and random peptide expression libraries. Since many patients with ON do not develop MS, these studies will allow identification of clinical and molecular risk factors that may point to the ultimate cause of human demyelinating disease and allow physicians to identify at-risk individuals, to diagnose MS at the earliest stage of disease and to treat patients with therapies designed to modify or even cure disease.\n\nOccult Chorioretinal (OC) Disorder. Acute zonal occult outer retinopathy, multiple evanescent white dot syndrome, acute macular neuroretinopathy, acute idiopathic blind spot enlargement syndrome, multifocal choroiditis, punctate inner choroidopathy and diffuse subretinal fibrosis syndrome are a group of chorioretinal inflammatory disorders of unknown etiology that mimic optic neuropathy. These disorders possess common clinical features, and affected individuals may evolve from one condition to another. Dr. Bennett’s laboratory has identified clones in a human uveal retinal cDNA expression library and a random peptide library whose products react with serum or immunoglobulins from OC patients. Using molecular biological techniques, the lab screens candidate antigens with sera from OC and control patients to characterize disease-relevant clones. Identification of OC-specific markers will help classify occult chorioretinal disorders as a specific nosologic entity.\n\nJulie J. Berk, MS, PA-C\n\nMs. Berk's research interests are related to projects aimed at improving the quality of life for those suffering with chronic neurologic disease, and their families.\n\nBrianne M.

I am also investigating the use of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) as a tool to modulate brain networks dynamic and assess excitation/inhibition (im)balance in cortical regions. Finally, I am integrating these state-of-the-art techniques with experimental paradigms relying on the neurophysiological analysis of sensorimotor control to provide an inclusive view of the neural control of movement.\n\nAndrew Bubak, PhD\n\nVaricella zoster virus (VZV) is an exclusively human neurotropic virus that causes chickenpox (varicella) on primary infection after which virus establishes latency in neurons in the cranial nerve, dorsal root and autonomic ganglia along the entire neuraxis. With a decline in VZV-specific cell-mediated immunity such as seen in the elderly and immunocompromised individuals, VZV reactivates from one or more ganglia and typically produces zoster, which can be complicated by persistent dermatomal distribution pain (postherpetic neuralgia; PHN). I am interested in the neurochemical mechanisms mediating PHN at the junction of the peripheral and central nervous systems, with the hope of discovering novel targets for pain therapy. An additional interest includes developing RNAi based therapies for the prevention and treatment of viral infections.\n\nHaley A.

Treatments for these diseases are sub-optimal or non-existent. Dr. Clarke’s laboratory uses clinically important viral pathogens (West Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis virus and herpes simplex virus) to investigate cellular genes and signaling pathways that are up-regulated or activated in the CNS following virus infection and to evaluate these host factors as therapeutic targets for virus-induced CNS disease. Dr. Clarke’s research has identified apoptosis as a key mechanism of virus-induced pathology within the CNS and interferon signaling as a critical component of anti-viral defenses. Dr. Clarke’s research has also demonstrated the generation of a robust neuroinflammatory response in the CNS following virus infection, including the activation of resident immune cells (astrocytes and microglia) and the up-regulation of pro-inflammatory gene expression. The role of this response in viral pathology is currently being investigated.\n\nJohn R. Corboy, MD\n\nDr. Corboy's research involves immunotherapies for multiple sclerosis (MS) patients.

We hypothesized and showed that AD patients develop trisomy 21 and other aneuploid cells, including neurons, during the course of their life and thus that AD is a mosaic form of DS. We recently found the mechanism by which aneuploidy develops in AD: the Abeta peptide inhibits certain microtubule based kinesin motor proteins and thus prevents the transport of key cellular components, including vesicles, chromosomes, and microtubules themselves to their proper locations in the cell. As a result, dividing cells mis-segregate their chromosomes, generating aneuploid, including trisomy 21 cells in AD patients, cells in culture, and transgenic AD mice. Neurons also fail to localize neurotrophin and neurotransmitter receptors to the cell surface, resulting in the poor neuroplasticity. We have also found aneuploid neurons and other cells in patients and mouse models of Niemann Pick C and Fronto-Temporal Dementia, and that the aneuploid cells are prone to apoptosis, suggesting that chromosome mis-segregation may underlie many different forms of neurodegeneration. We are currently investigating the mechanism of chromosome mis-segregation and searching for means to prevent or reverse it. We also hypothesized that rheumatoid arthritis patients, who seldom develop AD release an endogenous protective molecule and showed that GMCSF and GCSF, over produced in RA, reverse AD pathology and cognitive deficits in a mouse model of AD. We are currently carrying out a clinical trial to test the safety and efficacy of human GMCSF (Leukine) in AD patients and have proposed a similar trial in DS. Finally, we showed some time ago that apoE4, the strongest risk factor for late onset AD, other than age itself, exerts its effect by catalyzing the conversion of monomeric Abeta into the multimeric form that is toxic to neurons and accumulates as amyloid deposits. We are currently searching for molecules that block the catalytic activity of apoE.\n\nRobert W.

Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) is an emerging pathogen which causes a biennial respiratory disease and is associated with a rapid-onset muscle-weakness and limb paralysis in children (termed “acute flaccid myelitis”). The number of confirmed EVD-68 cases has increased markedly since its discovery, with 9 documented cases between 1962-2005; 699 documented cases between 2005-2010; and thousands of cases since 2014. It is not known whether the increased virulence of EV-D68 is due to a change in the virus or a change in population immunity. Density gradient centrifugation of three modern EV-D68 strains (US/MO/14-18947; US/CA/14-4231; US/IL/14-18952) plus an ancestral strain (Fermon) identified three distinct densities of infectious virus. Electron microscopy shows two different densities of naked particles and a third, previously unrecognized, membrane-associated form of the virus. Over 30% of the total infectivity of modern strains is associated with naked viral particles found at a density between 1.170g/cm3 and 1.210g/cm3, while less than 1% of the infectivity of Fermon is found in this density range, suggesting that particles with this density may account for differences in virulence between the modern and ancestral strains. Modern strains also show a second peak of infectivity at a density of 1.240g/cm3, while the ancestral Fermon strain shows only a single peak of infectivity at 1.272g/cm3. The membrane-associated form of the virus (density 1.070g/cm3 – 1.165g/cm3) appears to be present, in variable amounts, in all strains. It is infectious, sensitive to non-ionic detergent, and is positive for both CD63 and CD81, suggesting that the virus is associating with exosomes.\n\nPrincipal Investigators S - Z\n\nBrian Sauer, MD, PhD\n\nBrian Sauer's research interests include the neurobiology of acute autoimmune and neuroinfectious diseases; the pathophysiology and treatment of new onset refractory status epilepticus (NORSE); computer-aided clinical decision making in the diagnosis and treatment of complex neurological disorders; and the design and development of health care networks for the efficient and equitable delivery of acute, inpatient neurological care.\n\nTeri L.

She is also the local principal investigator for a national trial involving patients with transient ischemic attack.\n\nJohn R Sladek, Jr. Ph.D\n\nDr. Sladek’s laboratory, since his early publications on the chemical neuroanatomy of mammalian brain, has focused on the unique distribution of the histologically identifiable monoamine neurotransmitters, especially dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin as well as peptidergic neurons of the hypothalamus including vasopressin, oxytocin, LHRH and others. His laboratory developed dual localization techniques that permitted detailed studies in higher order primates. His interests in the role these neurotransmitters played in normal brain function led to novel investigations during development and aging that suggested functional interactions between specific systems. In 1980, his pivotal publication in Science demonstrated that fetal neurons could be transplanted to the brain of a genetic mutant rat that that was incapable of producing vasopressin and that grafted fetal neurons could survive, integrate with the host brain and restore a lost neural function. This lead to new and continuing studies on the potential for fetal dopamine neurons to restore motor activity in a primate model of Parkinson’s disease. His proof of principle findings led to the first clinical trials in parkinson patients and in recent years have been extended to incorporate human neural stem cells in the experimental protocols. Professor Sladek continues his exploration of the ability of the primate brain to respond to various neural repair strategies including the potential for induction of neurogenesis in response to injury. His work has been supported continuously by NIH, NSF and several foundations since 1974.
