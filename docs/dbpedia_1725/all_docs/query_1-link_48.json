        "text": "Whenever I tell people I’m done with my National Service, what follows is “WHAT NEXT”??. Sincerely, I don’t know the answer to that. Am I furthering my education or seeking employment??? As a fresh Geomatic engineering graduate, it’s one of the toughest questions I can’t honestly answer even to myself. So I always wonder, if I am to continue with studies what’s my specialization going to be?? Is it GIS, Remote Sensing, Geodesy, Hydrographic Surveying, Carthography, just to mention a few, or I’ll totally divert to another engineering discipline??? And is going to be in the country or overseas and the source for funds to do so???? And with employment, as a fresh graduate with only a year and 6 weeks experience from my National Service and internship program respectively, which organization will be willing to offer me employment as most of the advertisements I have seen have a minimum of 3 years experience. Or am I to gather funds and start a survey engineering firm on my own?? But even so, where will the start up capital be acquired??? As an enthusiastic young engineer with all the wild ideas and thoughts I’m only left to dream about my ways to improve the survey units and practices of the country as a whole. Such as establishing a good Hydrographic unit for tidal readings and sea floor mappings whose data comes in handy during coastal developments. Also, good Astronomical survey unit for constant observation of astronomical features. Not forgetting a good geodetic unit to constantly monitor the survey stations and controls of the country for the necessary readjustments to always improve the accuracy of survey observations been done in the country and to even extend it to the neighbouring African countries with an internationally recognized coordinate system. There are a lot of ideas but one keen aspect is an active cartographic, GIS and remote sensing unit for constant update of the national maps and satellite images of the country and its necessities. As most of the areas still have very old satellite imageries which makes dependency on satellite images for projects at such areas difficult. Dreams will always be dreams but they eventually do come true when greatly persued and eagerly worked towards.\n\nUnlock Your Career in Geoscience with Avakaza Geoscience Research Technologies (AGSRT)(A Placement Story of AGSRT) At AGSRT, we're not just about imparting knowledge; we're about transforming careers.

(For upcoming Geoscientists) 1. First grow interest in your geosciences domain. 2. To all upcoming geoscientists, do literature survey and find out some interesting research topics, make a write up of 2 to 3 pages on your research ideas ( Introduction, research objectives, modification on existing methodology or your innovative approach to fulfill the research objectives, what type of data is required and how to get access of those data, workflow and conclusions). 3. Make a CV of maximum two pages 4. Then search for internships throughout the world in both industry and academia and apply for internship along with your cv and research write up. 5. Before apply, study well and practice some coding inline with your research objectives. 6. Grow interest in research atleast in the pre-final Year of your course if not earlier. 7. Please try to apply atleast 2 internships everyday. 8. And make a strong determination, believe in yourself. You can do it and you must make it successful. Just start the first step, then you can achieve it automatically. Hopefully, you will get an opportunity to work in your domain. #oilandgasindustry #geophysics #geology #reservoir #earthsciences #iits #ism"
