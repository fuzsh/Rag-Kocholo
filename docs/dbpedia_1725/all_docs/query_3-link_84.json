        "text": "The identification of genes that increase susceptibility to schizophrenia, and their underlying mechanisms, are among the most challenging issues in neuropsychiatric research. The importance of identifying intermediate phenotypes or ‘endophenotypes’ (e.g., social, psychophysiological or neuropsychological abnormalities) reflects the need for more specific or simple definitions of liability than broad clinical diagnoses allow (Gottesman & Gould, 2003). Endophenotypes may reflect variation among a smaller number of genes than do clinical symptoms (Braff, Freedman, Schork, & Gottesman, 2007; Gottesman & Gould, 2003) and are heritable (Greenwood et al., 2007), thus enhancing their utility in genetic studies.\n\nVerbal Declarative Memory (VDM) is one of the most consistent and severe neuropsychological deficits in schizophrenia (Aleman, Hijman, de Haan, & Kahn, 1999; Cirillo & Seidman, 2003; Heinrichs, 2005; Heinrichs & Zakzanis, 1998), and at least three lines of evidence support its candidacy as an endophenotype. The first is its prominence among cognitive deficits observed in schizophrenia and related disorders like schizotypal personality disorder (SPD) (Aleman et al., 1999; Cirillo & Seidman, 2003; Heinrichs, 2005; Voglmaier et al., 2005). A qualitative review of over 110 studies showed that VDM deficits in schizophrenia are robust, with large effect sizes (ESs; ≈ 1.0 – 1.5) on list learning, story recall and other learning and memory tasks (Cirillo & Seidman, 2003). A recent quantitative review further documented that these deficits are comparably present in first episode and established schizophrenia (MesholamGately, Giuliano, Faraone, Goff, & Seidman, 2009).\n\nThe second line of evidence supporting VDM as an endophenotype involves deficits in non-psychotic first-degree relatives of persons with schizophrenia. Like patients, relatives show reliable but milder encoding deficits (Faraone et al., 1995; Faraone et al., 1999) but not a significantly abnormal rate of forgetting (Cannon et al., 1994; Cirillo & Seidman, 2003; Faraone et al., 1995; Gur et al., 2007; Kremen & Hoff, 2004; Seidman et al., 2006; Skelley, Goldberg, Egan, Weinberger, & Gold, 2008). The qualitative similarity of VDM deficits between patients and relatives supports the view that VDM impairments reflect genetically-mediated characteristics of the disorder rather than secondary phenomena associated with effects of medication, psychosis or other cognitive dysfunctions (Weiss & Heckers, 2001).\n\nThe third reason that VDM is considered an endophenotype involves evidence for its heritability including: 1) its familiality; 2) deficits in individuals with SPD whose co-twins had schizophrenia (Johnson et al., 2003); 3) positive correlations between VDM deficits and degree of ‘genetic loading’ (defined as having two first-degree non-psychotic relatives with schizophrenia rather than one) (Faraone et al., 2000); and 4) molecular genetic studies showing relationships between VDM and specific genotypes (e.g. Cannon et al., 2005; Greenwood et al., 2007; Husted, Lim, Chow, Greenwood, & Bassett, in press; Paunio et al., 2004).\n\nThis study used a large, well-characterized sample to assess VDM performance using the CVLT-II (Delis, Kramer, Kaplan, & Ober, 2000). The CVLT-II has shown robust performance deficits in schizophrenia and related disorders (Remillard, Pourcher, & Cohen, 2008; Roofeh et al., 2006; Thornton et al., 2007; Tuulio-Henriksson, Partonen, Suvisaari, Haukka, & Lonnqvist, 2004; Van Erp et al., 2008). We hypothesized that performance on the CVLT-II would be consistent with the previous literature in several ways. Patients with schizophrenia would show broad deficits in measures of learning and memory compared to community comparison subjects (CCS) and to their non-psychotic relatives. Because subjects with schizophrenia typically show greater deficits in the acquisition or encoding of new information than they do in the retention or recognition of stored information (Cirillo & Seidman, 2003), we hypothesized that they would also show the largest deficits in CVLT-II measures that were sensitive to encoding. These include the number of words recalled correctly after hearing a list of words read repeatedly (‘List A Trial 1–5 Free Recall Correct’), and the number of words recalled correctly after a brief delay (‘Short-Delay Free Recall’). We hypothesized that patients with schizophrenia would show similar deficits in recall after a longer delay (‘Long-Delay Free Recall’) because initial learning was poor, but they but would perform relatively better on measures of recognition (‘Recognition Hits’ and ‘Recognition Discriminability’) because the negative effects of impaired acquisition would be smaller. Moreover, recognition memory tasks provide cues for remembering that may mitigate impaired retrieval in disorders such as schizophrenia in which organizational factors are prominent in the memory disorder (Cirillo & Seidman, 2003).\n\nAlso consistent with the literature, we hypothesized that relatives would show similar deficits qualitatively, but of milder severity. Like the probands, we assumed that the largest deficits would again involve measures of acquisition. Deficits in recognition, however, which are relatively mild in patients with schizophrenia, would be milder still in relatives, and might not demonstrate statistical significance. We also assessed the effectiveness of multisite sampling and data collection.\n\nMETHODS\n\nThe COGS is a 7-site NIMH-funded project designed to assess endophenotypes and perform genetic analyses on individuals with schizophrenia, their first-degree relatives, and community comparison subjects (Calkins et al., 2007). Participating sites include Harvard University, the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, the University of California San Diego, the University of California Los Angeles, the University of Colorado, the University of Pennsylvania, and the University of Washington. The institutional review boards of each site approved the study, and all subjects signed informed consent.\n\nThe primary goal of the COGS is to investigate the genetic basis of putative endophenotypes for schizophrenia including pre-pulse inhibition (PPI), P50, anti-saccades, verbal declarative memory, verbal working memory and vigilance (Greenwood et al., 2007; Horan et al., 2008; Olincy et al., 2010; Radant et al., 2010; Radant et al., 2007; Swerdlow et al., 2007). The COGS methods will be summarized briefly as they have been previously described (Calkins et al., 2007). Each site followed an identical protocol to recruit, diagnose, assess endophenotypes and collect blood for DNA. Consortium-wide quality assurance procedures were exercised throughout the study. Eligible families had one of two pedigree structures. The first required availability of both of the proband’s parents, at least one of who was not psychotic, and at least one non-psychotic sibling. The second included availability of one parent and at least two non-psychotic siblings.\n\nSubjects\n\nMedically healthy adults were recruited through flyers, print, and electronic media. Schizophrenia subjects were also referred by mental health providers and through talks at such organizations as the National Alliance on Mental Illness. Subjects who received endophenotype assessment were 18–65 years old and fluent in English. Exclusion criteria for probands and CCS included a: history of electroconvulsive therapy in the past 6 months; positive drug or alcohol screen; diagnosis of substance abuse disorder in the past 30 days or active substance dependence in the past 6 months; estimated premorbid IQ < 70; inability to provide informed consent. Potential probands and CCS were also excluded if they had a history of head injury with loss of consciousness exceeding 15 minutes; a seizure disorder; and any ocular, neurological, or systemic medical problem likely to cause neurocognitive or psychophysiological performance deficits. Similar inclusion criteria were applied to relatives, but relatives were not excluded for a history of head injury or seizure, prior testing on an endophenotype within the previous month or testing on any of the cognitive endophenotypes within the previous three months. CCS were excluded if they had a history of any DSM-IV Cluster A Personality Disorder, psychosis; or first-or second-degree family history of psychosis.\n\nAll subjects were administered a modified version of the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies (Nurnberger et al., 1994), the Family Interview for Genetic Studies (NIMH Genetics Initiative, 1992), other clinical measures (see Calkins et al., 2007), and a medical record review. Premorbid IQ was estimated using the Wide Range Achievement Test, Third Edition (WRAT-3) Reading subtest (Jastak & Wilkinson, 1993). All probands met DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia and were stable clinically (i.e., they did not have a psychiatric hospitalization in the previous month).\n\nCVLT-II data were collected between November 2003 and April 2008. 1984 subjects consented to enter the study and 1495 completed the CVLT-II (75%). Most subjects who did not complete the test were parents of probands, reflecting the age limit of 65 for endophenotype testing. Test completion rates were 97.3% of the CCS (N=509), 84.0% of the probands (N=305), 89.8% of the sibling relatives (N=449), and 39.1% of the parent relatives (N=232).\n\nMost probands were being treated with antipsychotic medication at the time of testing, primarily second-generation antipsychotics (SGA) only (79.0%), or a combination of first generation antipsychotics (FGA) and SGA (8.2%), or FGA only (7.2%). Medication data for 6 participants were unavailable. Relatives were divided into sibling and parent groups due to their significant age differences. The majority of sibling and parent relatives were not receiving any antipsychotic medication (94.7% and 93.5%, respectively). Among the siblings, 3.8% received SGA, 0.4% received FGA, and data were unavailable for 5 subjects. Similarly, 2.6% of parents received SGA, none received FGA, and data for 9 subjects were unavailable. None of the CCS received antipsychotic medication.\n\nOne relative receiving FGA had a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder, as did one relative receiving SGA. Seven other relatives received SGA, with diagnoses that included major depressive disorder (N=4), bipolar disorder (N=2) and mood disorder NOS (N=1). We considered excluding data from these few relatives receiving FGA or SGA medications, but retained them for three reasons. First, we wanted the relative samples that were analyzed for CVLT-II performance to be as representative as possible of the whole sample of relatives (excluding relatives with schizophrenia). Second, earlier analyses (performed prior to the collection of the whole sample) used medication as a covariate and showed it did not affect group differences. Third, effects of antipsychotic medications themselves on cognition are generally small (Goldberg et al., 2007; Keefe et al., 2006; Keefe et al., 2007).\n\nStudy Design and Quality Assurance Procedures\n\nThe COGS protocol consisted of approximately 4 hours of clinical assessment and 6 hours of neuropsychological and neurophysiological testing, which were presented in one of two standardized test orders (Calkins et al., 2007). Endophenotype testers did not participate in diagnostic assessments.\n\nCVLT-II Assessment\n\nThe CVLT-II is a widely used clinical instrument (Delis et al., 2000). Briefly, it involves oral administration and recall of a 16-item word list over five learning trials, short- and long-delay recall trials, and a recognition trial. The CVLT-II Comprehensive Scoring System’s (Delis et al., 2000) Expanded Report version was used to tabulate raw scores, and to derive scores and standard scores according to age and gender. This paper focuses on the raw scores of five variables that have been investigated extensively in schizophrenia and in analyses of learning and memory: Trials 1–5 Free Recall Correct, Short-Delay Free Recall and Long-Delay Free Recall, Recognition Hits and Total Recognition Discriminability (i.e. the ability to discriminate target from distractor words in the recognition trial). The CVLT-II measure presumed to be most sensitive to encoding deficits, Trials 1–5 Free Recall Total Correct, was also selected as the primary measure for genetic analyses (Greenwood et al., 2007). To underscore its presumed sensitivity further, and to compare the utility of raw scores with standard scores, the standard score for Trials 1–5 Free Recall Total Correct was also included in our analyses, yielding a total of 6 measures.\n\nStatistical Analyses\n\nGroup demographic characteristics were compared using one-way ANOVAs for continuous variables and Chi-square tests for categorical variables. Group CVLT-II differences among probands, sibling and parent relatives, and CCS were analyzed using individual, mixed effects regression analyses (SAS Proc MIXED). In each model, CVLT-II raw or standardized scores were dependent variables. Family membership was treated as a random effect to control for non-independent observations between probands and relatives from the same family. Group, performance site, and group x performance site interaction were fixed factors in the model. Age, site, gender and WRAT-3 Reading standard scores were included as planned covariates. Effects of mood and substance-related disorders were also assessed. Thirty-four subjects did not receive the WRAT-3. Subsequent analyses were run without these subjects (N=1461) and with group-derived mean score substitution. Post hoc tests, including least square differences (LSD) or Tamhane’s T2 Method (a conservative test), were used to assess group differences when overall effects were significant. Effect sizes (ES) were calculated using Cohen’s d (Cohen, 1988) using group raw score means and the pooled standard deviation. However, for group comparisons that include parent relatives, Cohen’s d was calculated based on estimated least squares means and pooled standard deviation (calculated based on the standard error) to control for significant age differences between parent relatives and the other comparison groups.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nConsistent with previous studies involving verbal declarative memory (VDM) (Heinrichs, 2005; Heinrichs & Zakzanis, 1998), patients with schizophrenia performed more poorly than controls and relatives, with large effect size (ES) deficits in Trials 1–5 Free Recall Total Correct, Short-Delay Free Recall, Long-Delay Free Recall and Discriminability (1.00 – 1.20). The standard score version of Trials 1–5 Free Recall Total Correct was also large (d = 0.93) and showed the same pattern of group differences. Due to the similarities between the raw score and standard score versions of this measures, the discussion will focus on one of them, the raw score measure, which is reported more commonly in the literature (Mesholam-Gately et al., 2009; Trandafir, Meary, Schurhoff, Leboyer, & Szoke, 2006). The ES for Recognition Hits was smaller, but was still in the medium effect size range (d = 0.55), consistent with its sensitivity being lower than the recall measures (Heinrichs & Zakzanis, 1998). Notably, the largest ES involved the CVLT-II Trials 1–5 Free Recall Total Correct raw score, the primary dependent variable to be used in COGS’ genetic analyses of VDM, which reflects the prominent deficit of the learning/encoding stage of memory processing (Cirillo & Seidman, 2003).\n\nThe current results showed milder than expected deficits in VDM performance in relatives of probands. They did provide some support for such deficits, but not in the hypothesized manner. Compared to CCS, neither the sibling nor the parent relative groups recalled significantly fewer words during the five learning trials or during the free recall trials. Thus, there was little indication of problems in learning or encoding in this sample. More consistent with expectation, CCS did not differ from either relative groups in the Recognition Hits trials. Contrary to prediction, Recognition Discriminability was the only measure that differed significantly among CCS and relative groups, which in part reflected sibling relative’s difficulty in rejecting distractor items on the recognition trial.\n\nDespite significant differences in Discriminability, the ESs were modest (d =.33 in the siblings, d = .54 in the parents). These results, together with nonsignificant findings across the other measures of learning, recall and recognition, demonstrate the relatively mild nature of the deficits in relatives on the CVLT-II, which is also consistent with the significant but relatively low heritability of the CVLT-II (Greenwood et al., 2007).\n\nOne of the main issues raised by the current findings involves understanding the weak CVLT-II deficits in relatives, as VDM is one of the most replicated endophenotypic cognitive measures that show schizophrenia-related deficits (Aleman et al., 1999; Heinrichs, 2005). One important question is whether the magnitude of CVLT deficits is consistent with those reported in the literature. Mesholam-Gately et al.’s recent meta-analysis of neurocognition in first episode patients) showed a large ES (d=1.34) for Trials 1–5 Free Recall Total Correct (Mesholam-Gately et al., 2009), which is consistent with the large ES (d=1.20) obtained in the current study for the same measure. A meta-analysis by Trandafir et al that examined CVLT Trials 1–5 Free Recall Total Correct in adult relatives showed a small ES (d=0.30) compared to control subjects (Trandafir et al., 2006). The ES obtained in the current study was also small (d=0.14), and was within the 95% confidence interval (CI) reported by Trandafir et al (d=0.10 – 0.48). Based on these comparisons, the magnitude of CVLT deficits are thus consistent with those obtained in the literature for both probands and for relatives.\n\nIn light of these findings, it is reasonable to consider whether the mild deficits in the relatives involves the CVLT-II itself. The small ES obtained in the current study and in the Trandafir et al meta-analysis were lower than ESs obtained with other tests of VDM, such as story recall (e.g., Wechsler Memory Scale Logical Memory) or other tests of list-learning (e.g., Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test/RAVLT) (Sitskoorn, Aleman, Ebisch, Appels, & Kahn, 2004; Snitz, MacDonald III, & Carter, 2006; Trandafir et al., 2006).\n\nTrandafir et al showed an ES of 0.47 for immediate recall of short stories, with a 95 % CI of 0.33–0.60 in the same meta-analysis. Although we cannot determine the relative sensitivity of types of list-learning measures, it is notable that Snitz et al reported a larger ES (d = 0.56) for deficits in auditory verbal learning in relatives (n=148) versus controls (n=155) (Snitz et al., 2006) than did Trandafir et al., using the CVLT. Two of the three studies used in the Snitz meta-analysis employed the RAVLT; while only the third study used the CVLT. This finding raises the possibility that features of the CVLT in particular (e.g., the relative ease with which words can be clustered based on their semantic features, which is not a feature of the RAVLT) make it less sensitive to deficits in VDM in relatives than other measures. The apparent heterogeneity of ESs in relatives when different tests of learning and memory are used emphasize the likelihood that VDMs do not have uniform utility as endophenotypes for schizophrenia, and that their most relevant dimensions of dysfunction in schizophrenia may not be characterized fully yet. An implication of this conclusion is that specific tests may describe the endophenotype more accurately at this point than broader terms such as VDM, which may mask its heterogeneity.\n\nSome of the other endophenotypes studied by the COGS consortium also showed a pattern similar to the CVLT-II. Like the other primary endophenotypes (Calkins et al., 2007), performance on Trials 1–5 Free Recall Total Correct differentiated CCS from probands clearly, and like the other endophenotypes, CVLT-II performance showed significant (if modest) heritability (Greenwood et al., 2007). The presence or magnitude of differences between CCS and relatives was more mixed, with some endophenotypes such as P50 showing significantly poorer performance in relatives (Olincy et al., 2010), some such as the CVLT-II and antisaccade performance showing milder effects in relatives (Radant et al., 2010), and some such as working memory (Horan et al., 2008) and N100 amplitude (Turetsky et al., 2008) showing intermediate findings, depending on specific task parameters or levels of psychiatric comorbidity.\n\nTwo other factors that might contribute to low levels of deficits in some endophenotypes should also be considered. The first involves the COGS ascertainment methodology (Horan et al., 2008; Radant et al., 2010), including a strategy that maximized differences between affected and unaffected relatives by requiring participating families to include at least one unaffected sibling and one unaffected parent. Because many schizophrenia families are not intact (e.g. the individuals in them may be too impaired for the families to remain intact), it is possible that probands and relatives participating in the comprehensive COGS protocol may have come from families that are more intact functionally than is often the case. This ascertainment strategy raises the question of whether the sample is less impaired clinically and/or cognitively than typical samples of schizophrenia and their relatives. The current findings do not fully exclude this possibility, but they do not support it as an explanation for the CVLT findings, as both proband and relative levels of performance on the primary endophenotype measure were consistent with levels of deficits reported in the literature, as discussed above. Moreover, significant differences between relatives and controls in other COGS endophenotypes such as P50 (Olincy et al., 2010), and a meta-analysis showing that methodological factors such as degree of symmetrical inclusion/exclusion criteria modulate the magnitude of differences between relatives and controls on antisaccade performance (Levy et al., 2004), weaken the feasibility of this hypothesis further.\n\nSecond, site differences are another factor potentially affecting sensitivity, particularly when those effects involve measures with small or moderate ES. This study showed demographic differences across sites in age, education and WRAT-3 Reading levels. Moreover, significant site differences remained in Trials 1–5 Free Recall Total Correct when these factors were entered as covariates, as they did in the Discriminability measure. Similarly, when site was also entered as a covariate, group differences were not altered for any of the CVLT-II measures examined. This point, along with consistent levels of ES for Trials 1–5 Free Recall total Correct in relatives in other studies conducted at fewer, or at single, sites (Trandafir et al., 2006), make site differences an unlikely contributing factor to the current findings on group differences.\n\nNevertheless, these site differences, in the context of the stringent methodological and QA procedures used in COGS (Calkins et al., 2007), underscore the potential vulnerability of large, multi-site studies to demographic and/or methodological differences. Notably, a majority of site differences in the current study reflected differences in CCS at different sites, rather than differences in probands or their relatives. This is an important point to consider in the design of single and multi-site studies that may focus more carefully on the ascertainment of rare families compared to the unexpectedly difficult aspect of defining and obtaining well-matched and representative controls. This issue is particularly important in detecting effects when the sample size and/or the ES are modest. Ultimately, greater standardization over the ascertainment of control subjects, together with better specification of endophenotype measures, may be necessary to facilitate the identification of genes and genetic mechanisms that create vulnerability to schizophrenia and other mental disorders."
