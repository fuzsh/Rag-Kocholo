Students will investigate insects in the Clemson University Experimental Forest. Explorations for particular groups may be according to their taxonomic relationships (e.g., ants, spiders, flies, etc.), habitats (e.g., soil, foliage, water, etc.), behavior (e.g., nocturnal or diurnal activity, attraction to different baits, phototropism, etc.), or other characteristics. Students in this Creative Inquiry will ask one or more questions about some aspect of the fauna of insects and their relatives, provide testable hypotheses to answer that/those question(s), and design one or more field and laboratory experiments to test the hypotheses. Students may explore their questions independently or in teams over one to four semesters for 1 or 2 credits each semester. Results and conclusions about them will be reported by the students in professional venues.\n\nTeam Leader(s)\n\nJohn Morse Plant and Environmental Sciences\n\nMichael Caterino Plant and Environmental Sciences\n\nCollege of Agriculture, Forestry & Life SciencesA36\n\nLifestyle Medicine\n\nThis Creative Inquiry will explore the effects of lifestyle medicine in conjunction with traditional medicine practices on the patient population at the Joseph F.

People engage in a variety of aversive interpersonal behaviors. Some of these behaviors are more mundane, such as guilt-induction. Others, such as those that constitute the focus of this team, are more insidious in nature, and have potentially fatal consequences. One of the interesting things about these behaviors is that, as seemingly disparate as they appear, there is actually quite a bit of overlap between them. For example, our research suggests an overlap between bullying and hazing. Additionally, one of the key predictors of perpetrating a school shooting is a long-term history of rejection, manifested most often through a history of bullying. One focus of our team with all of these behaviors is not only understanding antecedents and consequences but also prevention and intervention strategies.\n\nTeam Leader(s)\n\nRobin Kowalski Psychology\n\nCollege of Behavioral, Social & Health SciencesC78\n\nTesting Variables of Foods, Films, Antimicrobials and Surfaces Affecting Transfer and/or Survival of Bacteria\n\nThis team studies the transfer and survival of bacteria on various surfaces related to food. This team has tested numerous food-related surfaces and activities such as the 5-second rule, double-dipping and beer pong in the past. In the future we will investigate new topics related to food and bacteria such as transfer of bacteria by wiping table tops with cleaning cloths, sanitation of bottles and cans and transfer of bacteria while sharing snacks.\n\nTeam Leader(s)\n\nPaul Dawson Food, Nutrition, and Packaging Sciences\n\nCollege of Agriculture, Forestry & Life SciencesA79\n\nUsing Statistical Methods to Investigate Food Advertising Claims and Trends\n\nThis CI team evaluates various Food Advertising Claims including those claiming to taste \"better\", last longer and meet a certain specification.

Orthopaedic implants are medical devices made of biomaterials used to treat musculoskeletal disorders inside the human body with an intended lifespan spanning years. Although implant devices have produced great benefits, it must be recognized that implants sometimes must be removed or replaced. Bioengineers contribute to their continual state of development to increase their performance and extend their useful lifespan. This cross-disciplinary project applies fundamental concepts in bioengineering, materials science, and biological sciences to investigate orthopaedic implants after they have functioned in patients. Long-term data on the behavior of implant devices and host response are essential inputs to the development process, yet there are few systematic programs for the retrieval and analysis of implants in the USA. Independent and international data banks do exist however. The contributions to implant design provided by retrieval and analysis will benefit patients through improvements in implant performance. We can consider implants to be defined as having a minimum lifespan of 3 months, as penetrating living tissue, as having a physiologic interaction and as being retrievable. A number of barriers exist to the establishment of an implant retrieval program. Major impediments are the costs associated with such a program and fear of litigation affecting manufacturers, hospitals, physicians, and investigators. The long term goal of this Creative Inquiry project is to establish and develop a viable Clemson University Implant Retrieval Program and pursue hypothesis-driven research related to orthopaedic implants. The aim of this program is to provide a working repository for retrieved orthopaedic implants, and to develop the tools and techniques for the systematic evaluation of implant designs, materials, surfaces and function.\n\nTeam Leader(s)\n\nMelinda Harman Bioengineering\n\nCollege of Engineering, Computing & Applied SciencesF118\n\nMicrofluidics and Lab-on-a-Chip for Point of Care Technology\n\nIn this Creative Inquiry project, we explore the use of electric, magnetic or flow field for the transport and control of biological and synthetic particles in engineered microchannels with lab-on-a-chip applications to chemistry and biomedicine for point of care technology.\n\nTeam Leader(s)\n\nXiangchun Xuan Mechanical Engineering\n\nCollege of Engineering, Computing & Applied SciencesF150\n\nMicrobial Ecology and Bioinformatics\n\nWe know that microbes are the most abundant organisms on the planet and are found pretty much everywhere. However, we know very little about which microbes are present in different environments and what microbes are actually doing. The emphasis in our lab is to use genomics and transcriptomics of microbial communities combined with measuring environmental parameters in order to understand the global and local importance of microbes. We focus on ecologically important concepts, such as functional redundancy.\n\nTeam Leader(s)\n\nBarbara Campbell Biological Sciences\n\nDinuka Lakmali Jayasuriya Patabandige Biological Sciences\n\nCollege of ScienceG163\n\nInterpreting Geologic Landforms\n\nInterpreting the landforms around us lies at the heart of geologic exploration.

Britt Jr Psychology\n\nCollege of Behavioral, Social & Health SciencesC211\n\nExploration of Weight Gain and Obesity in Adult Populations\n\nThis CI will introduce students to the need for programs addressing overweight and obesity in adult populations and how to create and implement effective interventions. A review of existing programs for diverse populations will be included and the hypothesis(es) generated to plan an intervention for a local population reviewed. Students will be trained in anthropometrics and assessment measures such as blood pressure that often changes with weight gain. Students will plan/revise/implement an educational intervention and learn/practice physical assessments. The intervention component of the CI along with data collection and data analysis will occur. The project will culminate in a write up and presentation of the study results.\n\nTeam Leader(s)\n\nVivian J Haley-Zitlin Food, Nutrition, and Packaging Sciences\n\nCollege of Agriculture, Forestry & Life SciencesA212\n\nA Nutrition Education & Life-Style Intervention for Type 2 Diabetes\n\nThis CI will introduce students to the incidence and prevalence of diabetes in SC, the US and worldwide as well as the resources available to individuals with diabetes locally. Existing programs addressing type 2 diabetes – prevention and treatment – will be researched and critiqued. An intervention specific for the population that we will work with will be created and implemented following a thorough literature review and hypothesis(es) generated which will facilitate development of an effective intervention for a local population. Students will be trained in anthropometrics and assessment measures such as finger sticks & glucometer use, physical assessments that are diabetes related such as skin changes, foot and eye changes. They will also learn how to assess HgA1C, breath and urine changes with uncontrolled diabetes in order to more effectively relate to and treat their clients. Blood pressure will also be monitored as cardiovascular changes occur with uncontrolled diabetes. Students will plan and develop an educational intervention and/or plan a media campaign and learn/practice assessments Fall semester along with conducting a pilot assessment. The intervention component of this CI will occur Spring semester 2020 along with data collection, analysis, and write up plus presentation of the study results.\n\nTeam Leader(s)\n\nVivian J Haley-Zitlin Food, Nutrition, and Packaging Sciences\n\nCollege of Agriculture, Forestry & Life SciencesA235\n\nNutrient Sensing in Protozoan Parasites\n\nThe Morris lab is focused on resolving the mechanisms that protozoan parasites use to sense and metabolize the important sugar glucose during infection of their human host. Through these studies, parasite-specific components of the sugar sensing and uptake pathway have been identified and, in an on-going collaborative effort, small molecule inhibitors of the pathways with anti-parasitic activity have been developed. While the team has historically focused on the African trypanosome, more recent work on the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum and the brain eating amoeba Naegleria fowleri suggests that exploiting the sugar metabolism pathways of these single-celled invaders may also prove useful in the development of new therapeutics.\n\nTeam Leader(s)\n\nJames Morris Genetics and Biochemistry\n\nCollege of ScienceG244\n\nHealthcare Logistics: Data Analysis, Decision Making, and Modeling in Hospital Settings\n\nStudents involved in this Creative Inquiry project will be exposed to healthcare logistics during patient visits to the emergency department or on the day of surgery (from preop to recovery). The Departments of Emergency Medicine and Perioperative Services at Prisma Health have worked on process improvement initiatives where Clemson students have been able to contribute. One main driver in this research is the measurement of capacity planning, staff wellbeing and decision making in healthcare delivery. To support this research, students might have the opportunity to work with physicians, nurses, and other staff from data collection and observation at the hospital to model development and presenting results. Students will assist in data analytics and some healthcare modeling depending on the student's background. Our goal is to present project results at on-campus events, events sponsored by Prisma Health, or national conferences. Understanding how modeling tools are used to improve healthcare logistics will also be an underlying theme to this research.\n\nTeam Leader(s)\n\nFarzad Zeinali Industrial Engineering\n\nKevin Taaffe Industrial Engineering\n\nO263\n\nProjects for Sustainable Development in Recovering and Developing Communities\n\nThe Sustainable Designs CI project is led by faculty in the Biosystems Engineering program. The project brings together students from a variety of majors in engineering and science to explore sustainable options for fueling our world and restoring our natural resources and ecosystems- options that are particularly suited for developing communities and those that are recovering from natural disasters. In past semesters, solar water heaters and solar water distillation systems have been explored. More recently, the team has focused on two projects: 1) the biological production of hydrogen gas (H2) for use as a biofuel from waste agricultural products (section 1); and 2) the restoration of oyster reefs for reducing sediment loss in wetlands and improving ecosystem function (section 2). 1) The biological production of hydrogen gas using waste agricultural products is one way to produce biofuels in a sustainable manner. In this CI, students learned the lab-scale techniques (media preparation, inoculation and incubation) for the anaerobic bacterium Thermotoga neapolitana that is capable of converting sucrose, fructose and glucose contained in cull fruits to H2 gas, acetic acid, and CO2. The team will investigate options for optimizing the rate of H2 production.3) Globally, 85% of the world's oyster reefs have been destroyed or harvested. The CI team will investigate means to restore oyster reefs in the ACE basin in South Carolina, through the use of structures to provide suitable surface area for spat attachment. The team will collaborate with SC-DNR personnel to design and install structures near Fenwick Island, SC in the ACE Basin. Also, the team has begun to focus on the restoration of a local threatened mussel species (Elliptio complanata). Lab-scale cultivation systems for Elliptio have been developed by current students.\n\nTeam Leader(s)\n\nCaye Drapcho Environmental Engineering and Earth Sciences\n\nCollege of Engineering, Computing & Applied SciencesF300\n\nPackExpo Exhibit Design, Build, Research\n\nOne of the largest trade exhibitions in the country is PackExpo.

The name of the column is Tigra scientifica and is used to report on the hottest topics in scientific and academic research.\n\nTeam Leader(s)\n\nLesly Temesvari Biological Sciences\n\nCollege of ScienceG378\n\nDesigning Medical Technology for the Developing World\n\nDeveloping countries face healthcare challenges every day, whether it is lack of supplies or a shortage of healthcare professionals. Medical devices and equipment that are considered standard in hospitals in the United States can be hard to find and very expensive in developing countries, such as Tanzania. Tanzania has recently made significant advances with the quality of their healthcare; however, there are still many hurdles that need to be overcome. The goal of this Creative Inquiry team is to design and develop medical instrumentation and monitors that are robust, user-friendly, and low-cost for developing countries. The students on this team will be expected to work on electronics and instrument design. These types of projects not only have the ability to improve the lives of young infants and families, but they can also impact the medical field in developing nations worldwide. In addition to doing design, students are expected to learn about Tanzania as a whole. Students will learn about Tanzanian culture, government and healthcare structure as well as some basic conversational Swahili.\n\nTeam Leader(s)\n\nDelphine Dean Bioengineering\n\nJohn D DesJardins Bioengineering\n\nJeremiah Carpenter Bioengineering\n\nDiego Nigoa Bioengineering\n\nMelinda Harman Bioengineering\n\nCollege of Engineering, Computing & Applied SciencesF379\n\nDigital History and Digital Humanities Introcution in Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences\n\nIn this current global digital age, this humanities project fosters students to research and independently design their own digital history projects. As an introduction to cyberinfrastructure, students learn the basics of digital history and humanities and participate in ongoing database and web projects. More advanced students can do statistical analysis as well as use the Social Media Lab to analyze media in a historical context.\n\nTeam Leader(s)\n\nVernon Burton History and Geography\n\nJoshua Catalano History and Geography\n\nCollege of Architecture, Arts & HumanitiesB397\n\nComputational Design Group\n\nThe Clemson School of Architecture Computational Design Group engages in a critical exploration of emergent technologies and material science in architectural design.

Top ranked teams in the regional competition will advance to the national competition.\n\nTeam Leader(s)\n\nWeichiang Pang Civil Engineering\n\nCollege of Engineering, Computing & Applied SciencesF479\n\nComparative Vertebrate Musculoskeletal Biomechanics\n\nResearch in my lab examines the patterns and processes of functional evolution in vertebrates. To understand the factors that have contributed to evolutionary transitions in function, we test the functional consequences of variation in biological design, primarily through experimental studies of vertebrate musculoskeletal biomechanics. We have extended these studies to include selection experiments on functional performance, allowing us to evaluate the impact of functional tradeoffs on structural diversification. Our three primary study systems have been examinations of (1) the load bearing capacity of vertebrate limb bones (and fish fins) during terrestrial and aquatic locomotion; (2) the functional performance of waterfall climbing gobiid fishes in a variety of behaviors, including climbing, predator escape, and feeding; and (3) the effects of differences in body structure on the swimming performance of turtles and tadpoles. These systems have allowed a diverse range of comparative studies that have provided insight into broader issues in the diversity and evolution of vertebrate functional design. Studies of these systems are complemented by investigations of other systems as new questions and opportunities emerge.\n\nTeam Leader(s)\n\nRichard Blob Biological Sciences\n\nDavid Munteanu Biological Sciences\n\nCollege of ScienceG510\n\nAquaponics: Maximizing use of a Biological System for Unique Production of an Aquatic and Plant Based Crop\n\nThis project stimulates undergraduate students' understanding of aquatic (fish, shrimp) production in recirculating systems and works to expand the unit for establishment of a dual or polyculture unit. The project will investigate methods for aquaponics and refine specific deficiencies of the system which include passive heating techniques to reduce costs, system design (airlift technology) considerations for efficiency and power dependency, automation for system productivity and bacterial control for food safety considerations.\n\nTeam Leader(s)\n\nLance Beecher Cooperative Extension Services\n\nO516\n\nMathematical Modeling with Advanced Engineering Apps: Damage Accumulation in Viscoelastic Materials\n\nStudents enrolled in the CI will be utilizing what they learned in differential equations, calculus and numerical methods courses to model and explore the advanced engineering problems including the phenomena of damage accumulation in viscoelastic materials,polymers and polymer based composites.\n\nTeam Leader(s)\n\nIrina Viktorova School of Mathematical and Statistical Sciences\n\nSofya Alekseeva School of Mathematical and Statistical Sciences\n\nChenyang Zheng Economics\n\nCollege of ScienceG522\n\nExperiencing Woody Plant Genomics and Biotechnology\n\nThe project aims to utilize genomics tools and advanced biotechnological approaches to improve plant health and enhance nutritional/medicinal values and production.

My laboratory is focused on resolving the mechanisms that regulate the biogenesis of essential organelles called glycosomes in these organisms. These organelles are parasite specific and essential making them excellent drug targets.\n\nTeam Leader(s)\n\nMeredith Morris Genetics and Biochemistry\n\nCollege of ScienceG556\n\nBiology of Lipids and Lipid Droplets in Trypanosomes\n\nWe are investigating how the lethal blood parasite Trypanosoma brucei acquires and stores lipids from its host. Lipids can be used as a source of energy, key building blocks for cell membranes, anchors of cell surface proteins, and signaling molecules. In its hosts, T. brucei must use a combination of fatty acid uptake and synthesis to survive. We are interested in the following research questions: How does the parasite sense environmental sources? How does it take up fatty acids from its hosts? How does it \"decide\" where those fatty acids go int he cell? What role do these processes play in pathogenesis and immune evasion? We use a variety of genetic, molecular, biochemical, and cell biological approaches to address these questions in our lab.\n\nTeam Leader(s)\n\nKimberly Paul Genetics and Biochemistry\n\nCollege of ScienceG561\n\nRelationship Between Toxoplasma Infection and Immune Responses in Cancer Development\n\nToxoplasmosis is a highly prevalent infectious disease among the human population with approximately one third of the people on the earth carry such infections. The causing agent Toxoplasma gondii widely spreads in the environment. The primary infections generally do not cause severe symptoms in healthy people owing to competent immunity; however, they can transit into latent infection and form cysts within the host’s brain by penetrating the blood-brain barrier or muscle tissue. When the host experiences compromised immunity, such as cancer development, the cyst can be reactivated to cause severe or even lethal situations. Moreover, a recent study has revealed that the infection of Toxoplasma can trigger a similar signaling pathway shared with cancer development. So far, many epidemiological studies have shown that the human population with cancer have a higher Toxoplasma infection percentage than the healthy control group. These findings suggest a positive correlation between Toxoplasma infection with cancer occurrence, and the cancer patients are more vulnerable to primary toxoplasmosis than healthy individuals. It is obvious that the immune system plays a critical role in the parasite infection and tumor development; however, the information about the immune regulation in Toxoplasma infection on tumor development is very limited. In this project, students will have the opportunity to investigate the relationship between Toxoplasma infection and the immune system on cancer development using in vitro assays.\n\nTeam Leader(s)\n\nYanzhang Wei Biological Sciences\n\nCollege of ScienceG563\n\nInvestment Research Challenge\n\nThe CFA Research Challenge, organized by the CFA Institute and its member Societies, involves the valuation of a publicly traded company. Just like a Wall Street analyst would do for a research report, the team of students must come up with a one-year target price for the stock along with a Buy/Hold/Sell recommendation. The students must research the company, its industry, competitors, customers, and market trends to make assumptions that are used in a financial model projecting future performance. In this project, students develop teamwork, analytical, written and oral communication skills to write their report and present to a panel of investment professionals.\n\nTeam Leader(s)\n\nJack G.

The overarching focus is to identify conserved functions within particular groups of microbes that can be targeted with small organic molecules. The goal is to identify potential new therapeutics that could be used to modify the gastrointestinal microbiome in a targeted fashion. The current research is focused on investigating the possible involvement of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (and related species) in the development and/or exacerbation of diabetes, obesity, and colon cancer.\n\nTeam Leader(s)\n\nKristi Whitehead Biological Sciences\n\nDaniel Whitehead Chemistry\n\nCollege of ScienceG629\n\nSerious games to enable STEM research and education\n\nThis CI group will contribute to the development, testing, and evaluation of serious games as a tool to enhance STEM education, understand factors influencing decision making, and assess efficacy of discipline-specific game-based learning. By integrating cyber-infrastructure, earth systems science, and social science with game play, modern serious games can become a particularly powerful tool for communicating interdisciplinary concepts, such as environmental sustainability. This CI group will research the breadth of game mechanics utilized in existing serious (e.g., River City) and non-serious (e.g., Farmville) games, test and evaluate what features of these games are attractive to players, and contribute to the development of new serious games that can be used at Clemson and beyond for STEM education and research.\n\nTeam Leader(s)\n\nLindsay Shuller-Nickles Environmental Engineering and Earth Sciences\n\nDavid Connick Physics and Astronomy\n\nF Catherine Mobley Sociology, Anthropology and Criminal Justice\n\nMichael Dale Environmental Engineering and Earth Sciences\n\nD.

However, ES cell research has been hampered due to the ethical concerns of the use of human embryos. Recently, scientists have developed a novel way to convert somatic cells into ES-like cells through forced expression of four transcription factors key to the ES cell pluripotency maintenance. These cells are called induced pluripotent stem cells (IPS). The initial method used for IPS induction is based on retrovirus due to its high transfection efficiency. However, the potential dangers of retrovirus induced insertional mutagenesis and transformation pose great concerns for the applications of theses IPS cells in human. Therefore a great deal of research efforts have been put in the search of alternative delivery systems to create safer IPS cells, such as protein, mRNA, plasmid, and non-integrating viral system. My laboratory has been working with a non-viral episomal vector based on the sequence of mammalian scaffold/matrix attachment region (S/mar), which are sequences in the DNA of eukaryotic chromosomes where the nuclear matrix attaches. S/mar sequences function as architectural DNA components that organize the genome of eukaryotes into functional units within the cell nucleus. Plasmids incorporated with the S/mar sequence can be maintained as replicative episomal units within mammalian nuclei. We plan to clone the four transcription factors into this vector for IPS induction. This episomal vector system will not only reduce or eliminate the potentials of insertional mutagenesis, but also solve the problems of gradual loss from transfected cells encountered by regular plasmids due to the episomal replicative capacity of this plasmid.\n\nTeam Leader(s)\n\nXianzhong Yu Biological Sciences\n\nCollege of ScienceG2506\n\nMicroplastics in the environment\n\nRecent research has shown the prevalence of microplastics in our environment, although data surrounding their occurrence in Upstate South Carolina is lacking. Over the course of two semesters, we will review the scientific literature surrounding microplastics while developing field and lab protocols. At the end of the first semester, we will be practicing our protocols and developing hypotheses for field collection. In the spring '25 semester we will collect and process environmental samples with the goal of creating research presentations based on our findings.

Many concrete and masonry buildings collapsed during the 2010 Haiti Earthquake resulting in serious devastation and many casualties. One of the major cause of widespread building collapses was the lack of reinforcement (steel bars) in the buildings. Steel rebars are very expensive in Haiti. This project seeks to use bamboo as a replacement for steel to reinforce concrete and masonry structures.\n\nTeam Leader(s)\n\nWeichiang Pang Civil Engineering\n\nCollege of Engineering, Computing & Applied SciencesF672\n\nFinding Your Voice Camp\n\nThis Creative Inquiry group will be responsible for planning, marketing, and evaluating an all-girls weekend camp at the Clemson University Outdoor Lab. The purpose of the camp is to introduce middle school girls to nontraditional physical activities as well as to offer educational sessions on topics such as self-esteem, body image, and college life. Research focused on the camp will address the following research questions:Does participation in a girls only camp impact middle school girls' body image? Does participation in outdoor recreation activities impact middle school girls' sense of physical self-efficacy? What are additional outcomes of participation in a girls only camp for middle school girls beyond potential impacts on body image and self-efficacy?\n\nTeam Leader(s)\n\nDenise Anderson Dean-Beh, Social, & Health Sci\n\nCollege of Behavioral, Social & Health SciencesC703\n\nAssessment of College Student Health\n\nThis research team is focused on assessing and evaluating college student health.

Marine ornamental crustaceans, i.e., wild caught species sought by aquarium hobbyists due to their aesthetic value (e.g., bright coloration) and/or ability to control/eliminate aquarium pests, are particularly impacted by over-fishing and habitat destruction and do require immediate attention. The ornamental fishery, a well-established multi-million dollar industry, often operates unnoticed due to their niche market, the frequency of product export, and the diminutive size of the target organisms. Little attention has been paid to them and they have been managed based on little to no life history information. The marine aquarium trade relies predominantly on wild caught species with > 90% taken from coral reefs and associated habitats. The industry has increased dramatically in recent years with a distinct focus on crustaceans (and other invertebrates) that provide “ecosystem services” for aquaria (control of aquarium pests). As these organisms are harvested for the services they can provide in an aquarium, those services are potentially lost from the ecosystem. Immediately after corals, crustaceans represent the most heavily traded ornamental marine invertebrate worldwide. Basic life history information critical to manage any fishery with the goal of sustainability is largely absent. Furthermore, the mislabeling of the species traded in the industry is rampant. The development of a genetic (COI and/or 16S) barcode for this economically and ecologically important group of shrimps is warranted for achieving the goal of fishery sustainability. This Creative Inquiry project aims at generating basic life history information about the most intensively traded species in the western Atlantic (e.g., shrimps from the genera Thor, Lysmata and Periclimenes, and crabs from the species complex Mithrax-Mithraculus). Furthermore, this project will setup the basis for the development of a genetic barcode for the most heavily harvested ornamental crustaceans.\n\nTeam Leader(s)\n\nAlyssa Baker Biological Sciences\n\nJuan Antonio Baeza Migueles Biological Sciences\n\nCollege of ScienceG742\n\nImaginative Ligands and Unique Metal Complexes: A Marriage of Organic and Inorganic Chemistry\n\nOrganic chemists often are puzzled by metals, and inorganic chemists are often puzzled by organic chemistry, but there are great opportunities in uniting the ability of organic chemists to generate complex 3D molecules with the unique reactivities and properties of metals. This project combines these two areas to design, synthesize, and examine the metal-coordination properties of ligands for commonly studied metal ions such as iron and copper, as well as more exotic metal ions such as lanthanides uranium, and plutonium (note: undergraduate students will not be working with uranium and plutonium!). This project uses synthetically versatile new approaches in organic synthesis to generate ligands with applications in biological, catalytic, and nuclear applications. Once made, a variety of techniques are used to examine the metal coordination abilities of these ligands, including electrochemistry, stability constant determinations, and DNA damage and cellular assays.\n\nTeam Leader(s)\n\nJulia Brumaghim Chemistry\n\nCollege of ScienceG749\n\nDeep Eutectic Solvents based on Halogen Bonding for Energy Applications and as Tunable Reaction Media\n\nDeep Eutectic Solvents (DESs) are relatively new alternative reaction media consisting of mixtures of two or more components (Chem. Rev. 2014, 114, 11060−11082) They are related to Ionic Liquids, and while both have advantages over conventional solvents in having much lower vapor pressure tunable solvation properties DESs are generally less expensive to produce and have much lower toxicity than either Ionic Liquids or conventional solvents. Weak intermolecular attractions between the components of the DES mixture are important for their unique properties and in all currently available DESs these attractions are based on either ionic interactions, hydrogen bonding, or both. Our research is focused on an interaction similar to hydrogen bonding, called halogen bonding (Crystal Growth & Design 2001, 1, 165-175), and we have recently reported the first example of a halogen-bonding-based DES (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2021, 60, 22983 – 22989). This CI project will involve a survey of halogen bonded materials for DES properties and when found, testing and characterization of their structure (liquid and crystalline) and thermal properties. Current technology in Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSCs) often relies on halogen bondined materials and our project will also explore whether our new DESs will lead to enhanced performance of DSSCs.\n\nTeam Leader(s)\n\nWilliam T Pennington Jr Chemistry\n\nColin McMillen Chemistry\n\nCollege of ScienceG756\n\nBiochemical Analysis of Homologous Recombination and DNA Repair\n\nOur laboratory studies the mechanism behind the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). If not repaired, a DSB can result in genome instability and potentially, cancer. DSBs are caused by exposure to chemicals, radiation, oxidative reactive species generated during normal metabolism and damaged replication forks. The repair of DSBs often involves the homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair pathway. The heart of HR is the RAD51 and DMC1 recombinase. These enzymes catalyze the search for homology between the damaged DNA and the sister chromatid. The activity of the recombinases is modulated by a number of accessory proteins. We utilize a combination of molecular biological and biochemical techniques to determine the role these accessory proteins have in the modulation of RAD51 and DMC1 recombinase activity. The results of our studies will provide insight into the mechanistic underpinnings of HR and genome maintenance.\n\nTeam Leader(s)\n\nMichael Sehorn Genetics and Biochemistry\n\nAmara Onoh Genetics and Biochemistry\n\nOlivia Cobb Ezzell Genetics and Biochemistry\n\nCollege of ScienceG762\n\nExploring New Materials for Advanced Lithium Ion Battery Applications\n\nNew materials will be explored for longer life and greater capacity of the next generation batteries. Metal-organic framework (MOF) solids are known for its propensity in host-guest chemistry relevant to gas absorption, ion-exchange, catalysis and cathode applications, to just name a few. Participants of this Creative Inquiry project will learn fundamental electrochemical (e-chem) skills and, with my supervision, are encouraged to formulate their own work in the exploration of MOF solids. We will employ the water-soluble polyoxometalates along with organic amines to build new MOFs through e-chem synthesis at room temperature. The resulting solids will be subject to ion-exchange reactions and surface area analysis. We anticipate that new solids featuring open-framework structures suitable for electrode applications will result.\n\nTeam Leader(s)\n\nShiou-jyh Hwu Chemistry\n\nKirkland Sheriff Chemistry\n\nCollege of ScienceG763\n\nExploring New Magnetic Solids for Quantum Computing and Information Storage\n\nExploring new magnetic materials revealing quantum tunneling phenomenon for the next generation quantum computing. A new class of inorganic solids will be synthesized by high-temperature (<500 oC) solid state methods. A typical example can be seen in one of our recent publications (Chem. Mater. 2014, 26, 1502-1504) where the synthesis of magnetic nanostructures in condensed matter is shown feasible for the formation of desired quantum tunneling phenomenon. The resulting new solids will be subject to single crystal X-ray diffraction studies, UV-vis spectroscopic analysis, and magnetic susceptibility measurements. We anticipate temperature-independent magnetic relaxation, a signature phenomenon for quantum tunneling, will be observed in these new magnetic insulators.\n\nTeam Leader(s)\n\nShiou-jyh Hwu Chemistry\n\nKirkland Sheriff Chemistry\n\nCollege of ScienceG765\n\nEngineering the Intervertebral Disc\n\nHerniation and degeneration of the intervertebral discs (IVDs) in our spine can cause significant pain, disability and economic burden on a global scale. Current surgical strategies to repair and restore function to the IVDs have limitations. Regenerative medicine-based approaches for IVD repair and regeneration using stem cells and scaffolds hold significant promise; however, an ideal scaffold that mimics the complex micro-architecture, biochemistry and mechanical properties of the entire IVD has yet to be developed. Previously, our CI has created a composite scaffold derived from cow tail IVDs that have had all the cow cells removed. The scaffolds have demonstrated similar physio-chemical properties compared to human IVDs and they support stem cell viability in vitro. Thus, the continued focus of the CI is to develop approaches to efficiently repopulate the scaffold with stem cells and to assess tissue regeneration on the IVD scaffold.\n\nTeam Leader(s)\n\nJiro Nagatomi Bioengineering\n\nCollin Vogel Bioengineering\n\nJeremy Mercuri Bioengineering\n\nCollege of Engineering, Computing & Applied SciencesF772\n\nBrain Tips\n\nStudents in this project learn more about the human brain and behavior.

There is also a growing interest in different fields ( e.g. medicine, biology, space research, electronics) to understand and utilize the effects of different forms of radiation. The effectiveness of radiation technology depends on the understanding of the interaction with the materials in question ranging from surfaces of solids to biological soft tissues. The present research project lies on the borderline of physics and biology. The elementary physical processes of the interaction are well known, but their expressions in biological samples depend on the complex response of the system and its environment. Students in this project will explore different techniques to generate, detect, and characterize electromagnetic radiation, their uses in specialized medical devices, and their applications in research.\n\nTeam Leader(s)\n\nDelphine Dean Bioengineering\n\nEndre Takacs Physics and Astronomy\n\nCollege of Engineering, Computing & Applied SciencesF791\n\nLab-on-a-Chip and Microfluidics to Identify the Cause of Disease in Clinical Diagnostics\n\nWe investigate the use of electric fields to identify and separate different strains of Candida cells. This is very important in the context of healthcare diagnostics since Candida is the causative pathogen of candidiasis, a medical condition affecting 46,000 patients yearly in the US with a mortality rate up to 44%. Identifying the strain causing this condition is crucial since front line antibiotics are not necessarily effective on all strains. For example, front line antibiotics commonly used for Candida albicans, the most likely cause of candidiasis, are not effective to eradicate C. glabrata, an emerging pathogen. The technology we are developing is a microfluidic chipset that utilizes a phenomenon known as Dielectrophoresis to selectively trap and detect different strains of Candida.

The focus of this CI is to derive these materials from renewable resources and elucidate ways to control their structure at multiple length scales, from the nano to the centimeter scale, to tailor their mechanical and electrical performance. The aim is at deriving multifunctional architectures such as structural batteries, sensors and batteries. To this end, we emphasize the use of origami techniques to create complex architectures in pure or doped paper, which we then carbonize at very high temperatures without the presence of oxygen. In this way we can derive complex, porous, lightweight architectures of carbonaceous materials. This is a powerful concept since we can create 3D architectures of engineering value from flat paper films.

Initially, this CI will focus on mentoring technologies that are being generated by other CI groups, as well as from other Capstone Design programs, but other “independent” teams and technical areas will be sought after the CI structure is established. Teams can include undergraduates and graduates, and preference is given to groups that have already formed around a topic or technology of interest. Mentors and guest speakers from industry, patent law, marketing and start-up businesses will work with student teams to take technology beyond the university development level. The format will be very student driven, with small student teams presenting each week on some aspect of their technology development and business plans. These presentations will be the focal point for discussions, mentoring and advice.\n\nTeam Leader(s)\n\nJohn D DesJardins Bioengineering\n\nCollege of Engineering, Computing & Applied SciencesF824\n\nPlant Biotechnology for use in Crop Genetic Improvement\n\nAbiotic stress, such as salinity, drought, heat, cold and nutritional stress, is the major factor significantly impacting crop production. Understanding molecular mechanisms underlying plant response to various stresses will facilitate development of molecular strategies in genetically engineering crop species with enhanced performance under adverse environmental conditions. In this proposed study, we use molecular genetics and genomics approaches to dissect molecular mechanisms determining plant salt stress response, and will develop molecular strategies using agricultural biotechnology approach to modify candidate genes in transgenic plants producing new cultivars with enhanced salt tolerance. This will lead to genetic improvement of important crop species with enhanced performance under adverse environmental conditions contributing to increasing agricultural productivity.\n\nTeam Leader(s)\n\nHong Luo Genetics and Biochemistry\n\nXiaotong Chen Genetics and Biochemistry\n\nCollege of ScienceG827\n\nSustainable Landscape Demonstration Garden\n\nDesign, installation, and maintenance are essential to creating a sustainable landscape that is a display or model for education.

They are in the air we breathe, the water we drink, the soil we walk on, the food we eat; they are even in and on us. Although this fact is generally acknowledged, we don’t always have a great appreciation for the roles these microbes play in our health. Antimicrobial resistance for pathogens is clearly becoming a bigger and bigger problem, but there is also the potential for some classically non-pathogenic organisms to cause issues. This Creative Inquiry project will focus on investigating a variety of bacteria with various impacts on humans. We will use hypotheses generated by the student investigators’ natural curiosity or recent news stories as the driving force behind our experiments. This CI has investigated topics such as microbial contamination of lab coats during General Microbiology teaching labs and the potential for magazines in physician's waiting rooms to serve as sources of infection.

The ability to connect fundamental knowledge of materials chemistry to real-world applications and to realize available STEM career opportunities is vital for undergraduate and middle school students. However, K-12 and undergraduate students, especially underserved minorities, or the public may have limited access to scientific literature and relevant resources. In addition, even though some literature resources are open access, science communication in forms of journal articles and talks cannot be easily understood by broader audiences. To address this, this CI project will focus on designing and creating inquiry-based storyboard and animation as a simple and flexible pathway to convey complex scientific concepts in an accessible and compelling manner. The goals of this CI project are to facilitate science literacy, to assist educators in teaching concepts in materials chemistry, functionalities, the meaning and practice of science for K-12 classroom, and to excite K-12 and undergraduate students about transdisciplinary STEM fields. Through this multi-semester CI project, our team will generate e-learning materials, produce lesson plans and resources for teachers, and implement these activities in local and regional schools and summer camps in partnership with the College of Science Outreach Center.\n\nTeam Leader(s)\n\nThao Tran Chemistry\n\nCollege of ScienceG2221\n\nPhysics-informed Deep Learning in Computer Vision\n\nThis Creative Inquiry project will provide an overview of the state of the art in deep learning and computer vision.

Genetics and genomics-based methods using eDNA are increasingly used to assess biodiversity in both terrestrial and aquatic environments. This CI project is centered on the idea that environmental nucleic acids and DNA barcoding approaches have great potential for noninvasive monitoring of biological taxa of conservation, health, or agricultural importance. In this CI project, we explore hypotheses related to local biodiversity using environmental DNA data. Methods used include primer selection and optimization for DNA barcoding, eDNA or eRNA collection, preservation and extraction, quality control and amplification, DNA sequence data collection and analysis, and phylogenetic analysis of species’ relationships. Our overall goal is to understand and improve how taxa- or species-level presence can be inferred and monitored using real-world environmental genetic or genomic data. It is anticipated that findings from this project will contribute to our understanding of how eDNA persists in the environment and its relevance and applications to new sequencing technologies and conservation genetic surveys. We will communicate our findings broadly to increase civic scientific literacy and appreciation for the use of environmental DNA in conservation.\n\nTeam Leader(s)\n\nKimberly Kanapeckas Metris Genetics and Biochemistry\n\nCollege of ScienceG2211\n\nOrganic Chemistry Outreach Program - Bonds that holds everything together\n\nThrough this educational outreach program, we aim to promote STEM education for local K-12 students. We plan to focus on relaying the importance of organic chemistry in our lives. Specific topics of interest include, but not limited to, strong/weak chemical bonds, building molecules, and catalysis. In collaboration with graduate students in the Kim Group, Clemson undergraduate students will focus on developing fun, engaging hands-on activities for the K-12 students.\n\nTeam Leader(s)\n\nByoungmoo Kim Chemistry\n\nGiovani Gutierrez Chemistry\n\nCollege of ScienceG2209\n\nCharacterization of commensal Clostridia in the gastrointestinal tract\n\nThe indigenous microbes that associate with all multicellular hosts, or microbiota, provide necessary functions that benefit host health. This is particularly true for the gastrointestinal tract, which hosts a particularly diverse bacterial community. While newer sequencing methods have uncovered much of the taxonomic depth of the microbiota in the gut, many commensal microbes remain undercharacterized. This is particularly true for the anaerobic, gram-positive Clostridia, a class of bacteria commonly associated with beneficial functions provided by the human gut microbiota. This project aims to characterize individual Clostridial strains previously isolated from fecal material. Students will characterize phenotypic (morphology, growth conditions, spore formation) and genomic (phylogenomic, metabolic, potential virulence) attributes of different Clostridial species. This information can be used to formulate independent research questions focused on microbial interactions or function. Techniques used include anaerobic cultivation, in vitro bacterial growth assays, molecular assays such as PCR, cell culture assays to detect toxin activity, and bioinformatic analyses such as genome assembly and phylogenomic comparison. Students are expected to participate in weekly group meetings to discuss study results and relevant literature related to the project. We expect to present results at a local, regional, or national meeting at the conclusion of the student’s CI project. These results are expected to expand knowledge of commensal Clostridia in the gut, increasing our ability to develop methods to manipulate the microbiota for host benefit.\n\nTeam Leader(s)\n\nAnna Seekatz Biological Sciences\n\nCollege of ScienceG2206\n\nCultural Competency Inquiry\n\nThis Creative Inquiry project, Cultural Competency Inquiry (CCI) program, explores and identifies ways to help students develop cultural competence to study and work effectively as future healthcare professionals. This project will be instrumental in developing and increasing a new Clemson Comprehensive of Clemson University students. The CCI will provide resources and opportunities, such as the Intercultural Development Inventory, online cultural competency modules, cultural activities, and reflection as a group and individually, and help students to grow into well-rounded candidates for the health professions. This CI project aims to study literature around competency and skills needed for healthcare professionals, and evaluate these resources, tools, and contents that will maximize CCI participants' learning and cultural competency.\n\nTeam Leader(s)\n\nHarolynn Williams College of Science-Deans Offic\n\nCollege of ScienceG2203\n\nEvery Campus a Refuge at Clemson\n\nThis CI is an experiential learning project to bolster refugee integration in our area and create new collaboration between community members, students, and faculty. Building on the work of an earlier CI project on \"Stories of Refuge, Detention, and Hospitality,\" this new project will concentrate on the practical and conceptual meanings of refuge and residence in our highly local context of the city and campus of Clemson. The CI will learn about the structure of refugee resettlement in US cities, explore how peer colleges and universities are responding to the challenges of resettlement, and develop new community engagement projects that could improve the quality of refugee resettlement and help build more inclusive communities.\n\nTeam Leader(s)\n\nAngela Naimou English\n\nSathwika Adimulam School of Computing\n\nCollege of Architecture, Arts & HumanitiesB2199\n\nNext Generation Sequencing and Bioinformatics Analysis of Sequencing Data\n\nThe fast pace of the advance of the sequencing technology have enabled rapid sequencing of a variety of samples for many application needs. Examples of such sequencing needs are the sequencing of the transcriptome to identify gene regulation, the sequencing to identify organisms that possibly causing infection, the sequencing to track the variant of concerns. As such, we generated large database that requires trained bioinformatician to analyze the data. This project is designed to train the students with a background in coding to demystify the sequencing data base and extract the useful biological relevant information. The students will gain experience using Palmetto server, linux, R, and python under Conda environment.\n\nTeam Leader(s)\n\nGaura Sinha Bioengineering\n\nDelphine Dean Bioengineering\n\nCongyue Peng Bioengineering\n\nCollege of Engineering, Computing & Applied SciencesF2197\n\nImproving Inclusion in Organizations\n\nOver the past two years, the demand for diversity training in organizations has skyrocketed. However, many of these efforts fall short at improving workplace inclusion climate. This CI team will use experimental and field-based research to explore new approaches to diversity training to better understand what makes diversity training work. Students will have the opportunity to gain experience designing and implementing research studies, developing surveys using Qualtrics, and analyzing qualitative and quantitative data.\n\nTeam Leader(s)\n\nAllison Traylor Psychology\n\nLizzie Bell Psychology\n\nGabrielle Rufrano Psychology\n\nCollege of Behavioral, Social & Health SciencesC2195\n\nDesign and Evaluation of a Novel Cable-Driven Ankle Exoskeleton\n\nIn this project, we will focus on developing and evaluating a novel cable-driven ankle exoskeleton. The exoskeleton is actuated via soft Bowden cables to provide ankle extension torque for assisting human locomotion. The entire exoskeleton system will be self-contained, where actuators, power units, control units, as well as necessary sensors will be integrated on a backpack to allow various type of locomotor tasks.\n\nTeam Leader(s)\n\nGe Lv Mechanical Engineering\n\nMiao Yu Mechanical Engineering\n\nZhenyuan Yu Mechanical Engineering\n\nCollege of Engineering, Computing & Applied SciencesF2193\n\nWetland community ecology: what happens when fish arrive?\n\nWetlands provide valuable services to humans by filtering water and offering flood control. They are also critical to maintaining biodiversity - especially for amphibians, fish, and many invertebrates. While wetlands closest to streams often are easily colonized by fish, those further from streams provide habitat for amphibians and invertebrates. Changes in climate are likely to alter patterns of rainfall and flooding. This could lead to wetlands that are either more easily colonized by fish (in cases of increased rainfall) or less likely to be colonized by fish (in cases of decreased rainfall). Our CI will establish experimental wetlands within the Clemson Experimental Forest. We will stock these wetlands with different species of fish to understand how fish presence and fish species influence the other members of the aquatic community.\n\nTeam Leader(s)\n\nJoshua Holbrook Forestry and Environmental Conservation\n\nRussell Kyle Barrett Forestry and Environmental Conservation\n\nCollege of Agriculture, Forestry & Life SciencesA2192\n\nBackyard box turtles: wildlife habitat use in developed areas\n\nWhen land use patterns change, the number and kinds of wildlife in the area change as well. Some species retreat to undeveloped areas, while other species are able to persist under certain conditions. Box turtles are often seen in yards and parks within otherwise developed areas. We intend to characterize the habitat and movement patterns of box turtles in developed areas and compare that to the same measures in the Clemson Experimental Forest.\n\nTeam Leader(s)\n\nRussell Kyle Barrett Forestry and Environmental Conservation\n\nEmma Rogers Forestry & Environmental Conservation\n\nCollege of Agriculture, Forestry & Life SciencesA2189\n\nSales Innovation Program Sales Competition Team\n\nThis CI incorporates advanced selling skills via sales competitions and advanced role play practices.

However, this combination has resulted in an explosion of plastic waste that can be found in almost every ecosystem on earth. Traditional recycling methods have only been successful at converting around 10% of plastic waste into usable material. This creative inquiry course will explore chemical recycling and organic recycling (i.e. composting) that aims to convert plastic waste to usable chemicals and materials in a circular lifecycle. Chemical and organic recycling has the potential to turn trash into treasure by valorizing waste, therefore creating incentive for its capture and reuse. However, the conversion of plastic waste to usable chemicals comes with the challenges of high energy expenditures, additional chemical usage and difficult feedstocks composed of mixed and contaminated plastics. This course will examine established techniques and those on the cutting edge in terms of lifecycle, technoeconomic analysis and feasibility.\n\nTeam Leader(s)\n\nJames Sternberg Food, Nutrition, and Packaging Sciences\n\nCollege of Agriculture, Forestry & Life SciencesA2186\n\nLeveraging Diverse Energy Sources for CO2 Mitigation Reactions towards an Equitable Carbon-Neutral Future\n\nThe catalytic conversion of CO2 into energy-rich commodities is an effective approach of combating global warming caused by greenhouse gas emissions while enabling the sustainable energy future. While the overall feasibility the technological routes can be estimated by thermodynamics, the uncertainties of operational efficiency and cost heavily rely on the choices of catalytic technologies. To ensure our transition to a clean-energy future can be truly equitable without leaving anyone behind, the catalysts for targeted reactions must be affordable and adaptable to energy infrastructure of diverse communities. Two of the major hurdles against this vision are 1) the high cost of catalytic materials due to the undue use of expensive catalytic metals, and 2) the limited options of reaction energy input from established industry process to provide tailored reaction engineering solutions. Therefore the goal of the proposed project is to prove the concept of designing CO2 conversion technologies with minimal catalytic materials and optimal energy input for those catalytic materials. The two main objectives are:1) Designing catalytic metal atoms with both 100 % material efficiency and high intrinsic activity as alternative to nanoparticles.2) Identifying optimal reaction energy input sources as thermo, magnetic, or electro to maximize the reaction activity and selectivity of the catalysts developed in Objective#1.We welcome students with diverse educational background to join the team to work on nanocatalytic materials development, reactor design, and technological economical analyses. Recruited students will have opportunities to present research work at various conferences and publish research articles on top journals.\n\nTeam Leader(s)\n\nMing Yang Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering\n\nCollege of Engineering, Computing & Applied SciencesF2181\n\nPredicting Protein Levels from mRNA Levels\n\nThe central dogma of molecular biology gives rise to the expectation that as mRNA levels rise and fall, protein levels will follow suit. However, it is now appreciated that this is an exception rather than the norm. For which human genes does such quantitative central dogma thinking hold? How well can we predict protein levels given measurement of mRNA levels? Are there classes of gene function that are enriched for adherence or non-adherence to the central dogma? This project uses analysis of large publicly available datasets to answer these fundamental biological questions. It is ongoing in the lab and is at the stage where it is likely to lead to publication.\n\nTeam Leader(s)\n\nMarc Birtwistle Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering\n\nCollege of Engineering, Computing & Applied SciencesF2180\n\nIdentification of Novel Feedback Loops Driving the Mammalian Cell Cycle\n\nThe molecular machinery that controls progression of the eukaryotic cell cycle has long been thought to be well understood for decades. Series of cyclin dependent kinases are turned on one after the other, after being initiated by external \"growth factors\". However, recent data from our lab has indicated potentially new feedback loops that superimpose onto this core known structure. This project will try to validate and characterize the nature of these feedback loops and understand their role in cell cycle regulation as well as how universal they are.\n\nTeam Leader(s)\n\nMarc Birtwistle Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering\n\nCollege of Engineering, Computing & Applied SciencesF2179\n\nPurifying Monoclonal Antibody Therapeutics with Phase Separation\n\nBiologic drugs, particularly monoclonal antibodies, are rapidly increasing in their use and new FDA approvals. A recent example was the Regeneron treatment for COVID available well before the vaccines. A costly step in their production uses Protein A chromatography to purify the monoclonal antibodies after cells produce them. This projects seeks to develop an alternative to Protein A chromatography that could revolutionize this industry.\n\nTeam Leader(s)\n\nMarc Birtwistle Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering\n\nCollege of Engineering, Computing & Applied SciencesF2168\n\nColorimetric Nanosensors\n\nModern scientific instrumentation and sensors are often bulky, expensive, and/or cumbersome to operate. Colorimetric sensors on the other hand offer a promising solution to these problems, as they can be analyzed with high spatiotemporal resolution by digital cameras or the naked eye. However, the performance of colorimetric sensors is typically inferior to the bulky/expensive alternatives as it can be difficult to convert small input stimulus variations into a large color response. This research effort seeks to address and overcome these problems and to open the door to new types of high-performance colorimetric sensors and biosensors, which are competitive with and/or offer greater functionality than the bulky/expensive alternatives.\n\nTeam Leader(s)\n\nJudson Ryckman Electrical and Computer Engineering\n\nCollege of Engineering, Computing & Applied SciencesF2167\n\nBest Is the Standard: Football Display Design\n\nJoin the newest creative team to help Clemson Football design interactive photo shoot displays for their recruiting weekend.

In particular, the group is interested in understanding how personality findings can be applied within legal settings. For instance, research suggests that personality impacts the performance of children as eyewitnesses during forensic interviews, as well as the perceptions of jurors when determining witness credibility.\n\nTeam Leader(s)\n\nBen Cotterill Psychology\n\nCollege of Behavioral, Social & Health SciencesC2162\n\nMulti-catalysis: Accelerated synthesis of valuable chiral molecules\n\nAccess of valuable chiral molecules such as various therapeutic drugs, materials, and synthetic building blocks has been achieved through multiple-step chemical transformations. However, there is a need to improve the synthetic efficiency of these multiple-step processes since they often require isolation after each step and overall time to produce the final target is lengthy. To address these challenges, this project aims to develop a new multi-catalytic method that will enable the rapid synthesis of chiral molecules from simple building blocks. Through this work, one will learn how to make organic molecules and design catalysts.\n\nTeam Leader(s)\n\nByoungmoo Kim Chemistry\n\nCollege of ScienceG2152\n\nArtificial Intelligence and Marketing: Customer Experience, Ethics, and Social Impact\n\nAs Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies mature, a variety of AI-powered products and services have been commonly used in routine from smart cars to robot vacuums and from digital assistants to health monitoring applications. While AI-enabled products and services provide tremendous benefits, they also bring various challenges for consumers, businesses, and society. This project investigates customer experience and interactions with AI, and social issues related to AI (e.g., privacy and algorithmic bias), with a focus on Generation Z (born 1997-2012) and Generation Alpha (born after 2010) consumers.\n\nTeam Leader(s)\n\nXianyong Wang Department of Marketing\n\nCollege of BusinessD2141\n\nMapping the Gay Guides\n\nIn this creative inquiry project students will work on Mapping the Gay Guides, a digital history project that seeks to digitize LGBTQ guidebooks from the 1960s through the 1990s. While on his frequent business trips around the United States in the late 1950s and early 1960s, Bob Damron wanted to find bars and other locales to meet other men like him. A gay man, Damron sought friends, companions, and safety at friendly businesses in the various cities he visited. He began jotting down the names of the spots he frequented, sometimes loaning out his notebooks to fellow gay friends to take with them on their own journeys. His prolific lists became the basis of gay travel guide he began publishing in 1964. In this CI Project, students focus on digitizing and mapping locations included within these historical documents.\n\nTeam Leader(s)\n\nAmanda Regan History and Geography\n\nCollege of Architecture, Arts & HumanitiesB2125\n\nWomen's Basketball Recruitment and Design\n\nWe have partnered with the Clemson Women's Basketball Recruiting Office to help design a mailer to send to potential Clemson Women's Basketball recruits.
