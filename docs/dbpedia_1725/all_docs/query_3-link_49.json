        "text": "Dame Jillian Sackler Director of the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery and Freer Gallery of Art\n\nChase F. Robinson has been director of the National Museum of Asian Art since December 2018. During his tenure, the museum has launched initiatives that have significantly increased the number of visitors on-site and online, expanded the collections by over 5,400 works, built out its network of community-based and international partnerships, established itself at the forefront of provenance research, and nearly doubled the size of its board of trustees. The museum celebrated its centennial in May 2023, inaugurating its first celebration of Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander Heritage Month attended by more than 40,000 people.\n\nRobinson is leading the National Museum of Asian Art’s transformation into a global resource for understanding the arts, cultures, and societies of Asia. Now in its second century, the museum is forging international partnerships that broaden and deepen its impact. Examples include a historic partnership with the Republic of Yemen Government to safeguard cultural heritage and memoranda of understanding with the Ministry of Culture and Fine Arts for the Kingdom of Cambodia, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Research and Technology of the Republic of Indonesia, and the South Korean Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism that address pressing issues, such as the protection of cultural heritage.\n\nRobinson is actively expanding the ways in which museums contribute to cultural diplomacy and foster cross-cultural understanding. Recent speaking engagements include the Doha Workshop on Countering the Trafficking of Cultural Property at the Qatar National Library (September 2023), the Hong Kong International Cultural Summit hosted by the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority (March 2024), and the International Symposium of Asian Art and Archaeology at Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, China (May 2024).\n\nA highly regarded scholar of Islamic history and culture, Robinson previously served as provost (2008–2013) and president (2013–2018) of the Graduate Center, the research campus of the City University of New York. From 1993 to 2008, Robinson was professor of early Islamic history in the Faculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies (previously the Faculty of Oriental Studies) at the University of Oxford. He chaired its faculty board from 2003 to 2005.\n\nRobinson has authored or edited nine books and more than forty articles that span the geographical and chronological breadth of the Islamic Middle East. They include A Medieval Islamic City Reconsidered: An Interdisciplinary Approach to Samarra (2001), Texts, Documents and Artefacts: Islamic Studies in Honour of D.S. Richards (2003), and the first volume of The New Cambridge History of Islam (2010). His book Islamic Civilization in Thirty Lives: The First 1,000 Years (2016) was translated into several languages. The Works of lbn Wadih al-Ya’qubi: An English Translation (2017) is a three-volume set of translations of some of the earliest works of history and geography in Arabic.\n\nRobinson earned his bachelor’s degree from Brown University, having also studied at the American University in Cairo, the University of Cairo, and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He received his doctorate from Harvard University’s Department of Near Eastern Languages & Civilizations. He is the general editor of Cambridge Studies in Islamic Civilization and a member of the editorial board of Past & Present. His editorials and commentaries have appeared in several magazines and newspapers, including The New York Times.\n\nNews and Remarks:\n\nStatement from the Director (March 19, 2021)\n\nA different Lunar New Year celebration in D.C. (February 10, 2021)\n\nDirector’s Introduction to the Museum for the Relay Project\n\n(premiered September 2020)\n\nThis video presentation is part of the Treasure Hunt Relay: Global Museum Director’s Choice, a digital initiative of the National Museum of China dedicated to helping audiences learn remotely about the cultural treasures of national museums from around the world, in both Chinese and English. Within twenty-four hours of its launch, our program was enjoyed by over one million viewers.\n\nAfter Pearl Harbor, our museum hid Asian art. In coronavirus crisis, we’re showing it off. (May 2, 2020)\n\nListen to Chase F. Robinson’s remarks at the “Age Old Cities” press preview\n\nListen to Chase F. Robinson’s remarks at the “Whistler in Watercolor” press preview\n\nElizabeth Moynihan Curator for South and Southeast Asian Art\n\nDr. Debra Diamond is Elizabeth Moynihan Curator for South and Southeast Asian Art at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Asian Art. She is currently re-cataloguing paintings in the collection, working on an international loan exhibition for 2022, A Splendid Land: Paintings from Royal Udaipur, and designing a digital component for an exhibition of Persian and Mughal painting, Writing My Truth: The Mughal Emperor Babur. Her most recent exhibition, Encountering the Buddha: Art and Practice Across Asia (2017), was accompanied by the publication of Paths to Perfection, the museums’ first handbook of its Buddhist collections, and an app exploring Tibetan sacred spaces. Her reinstallation of the permanent South Asian galleries in the Freer, Body Image: Arts from the Indian Subcontinent, also opened the same year.\n\nA specialist in Indian court painting and the visual culture of yoga, Dr. Diamond received First Place Awards of Excellence from the Association of Art Museum Curators for her exhibition, Yoga: The Art of Transformation (2013) and for the associated catalogue. In 2008, she was the curator for the acclaimed international exhibition Garden and Cosmos: The Royal Paintings of Jodhpur; the exhibition catalog won the 2010 Alfred H. Barr, Jr. award for best museum scholarship and Smithsonian Secretary’s research prize. She also coordinated the yearlong Celebration of India at NMAA, which encompassed two exhibitions and a wide array of public programs devoted to making south Asian art and culture come alive for diverse audiences.\n\nDr. Diamond has curated numerous exhibitions at NMAA, including Worlds within Worlds: Imperial Paintings from India and Iran (2012); In the Realm of the Buddha (2010); Facing East: Portraits from Asia (2006); Perspectives: Simryn Gill (2006); Autofocus: Raghubir Singh’s Way into India (2003); and the re-installation of Arts of the Indian Subcontinent and the Himalayas at the Freer.
