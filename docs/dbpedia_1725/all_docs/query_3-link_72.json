This questionnaire will be useful in following whether the impact of epilepsy increases, decreases or stays the same over time. The results also may point out areas that would benefit from discussion or attention in visits with your doctor.\n\nStanford is currently not accepting patients for this trial.\n\nView full details\n\nAbstract\n\nEpilepsy is a severe chronic neurological disease affecting 60 million people worldwide. Primary treatment is with anti-seizure medicines (ASMs), but many patients continue to experience seizures. We used retrospective insurance claims data on 280,587 patients with uncontrolled epilepsy (UE), defined as status epilepticus, need for a rescue medicine, or admission or emergency visit for an epilepsy code. We conducted a computational risk ratio analysis between pairs of ASMs using a causal inference method, in order to match 1034 clinical factors and simulate randomization. Data was extracted from the MarketScan insurance claims Research Database records from 2011 to 2015. The cohort consisted of individuals over 18 years old with a diagnosis of epilepsy who took one of eight ASMs and had more than a year of history prior to the filling of the drug prescription. Seven ASM exposures were analyzed: topiramate, phenytoin, levetiracetam, gabapentin, lamotrigine, valproate, and carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine (treated as the same exposure). We calculated the risk ratio of UE between pairs of ASM after controlling for bias with inverse propensity weighting applied to 1034 factors, such as demographics, confounding illnesses, non-epileptic conditions treated by ASMs, etc. All ASMs exhibited a significant reduction in the prevalence of UE, but three drugs showed pair-wise differences compared to other ASMs. Topiramate consistently was associated with a lower risk of UE, with a mean risk ratio range of 0.68-0.93 (average 0.82, CI: 0.56-1.08). Phenytoin and levetiracetam were consistently associated with a higher risk of UE with mean risk ratio ranges of 1.11 to 1.47 (average 1.13, CI 0.98-1.65) and 1.15 to 1.43 (average 1.2, CI 0.72-1.69), respectively. Large-scale retrospective insurance claims data - combined with causal inference analysis - provides an opportunity to compare the effect of treatments in real-world data in populations 1,000-fold larger than those in typical randomized trials. Our causal analysis identified the clinically unexpected finding of topiramate as being associated with a lower risk of UE; and phenytoin and levetiracetam as associated with a higher risk of UE (compared to other studied drugs, not to baseline). However, we note that our data set for this study only used insurance claims events, which does not comprise actual seizure frequencies, nor a clear picture of side effects. Our results do not advocate for any change in practice but demonstrate that conclusions from large databases may differ from and supplement those of randomized trials and clinical practice and therefore may guide further investigation.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.eplepsyres.2024.107313\n\nView details for PubMedID 38417192\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Deep brain stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT-DBS) is an effective treatment for refractory epilepsy; however, seizure outcome varies among individuals. Identifying a reliable noninvasive biomarker to predict good responders would be helpful.OBJECTIVES: To test whether the functional connectivity between the ANT-DBS sites and the seizure foci correlates with effective seizure control in refractory epilepsy.METHODS: We performed a proof-of-concept pilot study of patients with focal refractory epilepsy receiving ANT-DBS. Using normative human connectome data derived from 1000 healthy participants, we investigated whether intrinsic functional connectivity between the seizure foci and the DBS site was associated with seizure outcome. We repeated this analysis controlling for the extent of seizure foci, distance between the seizure foci and DBS site, and using functional connectivity of the ANT instead of the DBS site to test the contribution of variance in DBS sites.RESULTS: Eighteen patients with two or more seizure foci were included. Greater functional connectivity between the seizure foci and the DBS site correlated with more favorable outcome. The degree of functional connectivity accounted for significant variance in clinical outcomes (DBS site: |r| = 0.773, p < 0.001 vs ANT-atlas: |r| = 0.715, p = 0.001), which remained significant when controlling for the extent of the seizure foci (|r| = 0.773, p < 0.001) and the distance between the seizure foci and DBS site (|r| = 0.777, p < 0.001). Significant correlations were independent of variance in the DBS sites (|r| = 0.148, p = 0.57).CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that functional connectomic profile is a potential reliable non-invasive biomarker to predict ANT-DBS outcomes. Accordingly, the identification of ANT responders could decrease the surgical risk for patients who may not benefit and optimize the cost-effective allocation of health care resources.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.brs.2023.08.020\n\nView details for PubMedID 37633491\n\nAbstract\n\nNeuromodulation of the anterior nuclei of the thalamus (ANT) has shown to be efficacious in a subset of patients with refractory focal epilepsy. One important uncertainty is to what extent thalamic subregions other than the ANT could be recruited more prominently in the propagation of focal onset seizures. We designed the current study to simultaneously monitor the engagement of the ANT, mediodorsal (MD) and pulvinar (PUL) nuclei during seizures in patients who could be candidates for thalamic neuromodulation. We studied 11 patients with clinical manifestations of presumed temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) undergoing invasive stereo-encephalography (sEEG) monitoring to confirm the source of their seizures. We extended cortical electrodes to reach the ANT, MD and PUL nuclei of the thalamus. More than one thalamic subdivision was simultaneously interrogated in nine patients. We recorded seizures with implanted electrodes across various regions of the brain and documented seizure onset zones (SOZ) in each recorded seizure. We visually identified the first thalamic subregion to be involved in seizure propagation. Additionally, in eight patients, we applied repeated single pulse electrical stimulation in each SOZ and recorded the time and prominence of evoked responses across the implanted thalamic regions. Our approach for multisite thalamic sampling was safe and caused no adverse events. Intracranial EEG recordings confirmed SOZ in medial temporal lobe, insula, orbitofrontal and temporal neocortical sites, highlighting the importance of invasive monitoring for accurate localization of SOZs. In all patients, seizures with the same propagation network and originating from the same SOZ involved the same thalamic subregion, with a stereotyped thalamic EEG signature. Qualitative visual reviews of ictal EEGs were largely consistent with the quantitative analysis of the corticothalamic evoked potentials, and both documented that thalamic nuclei other than ANT could have the earliest participation in seizure propagation. Specifically, pulvinar nuclei were involved earlier and more prominently than ANT in more than half of the patients. However, which specific thalamic subregion first demonstrated ictal activity could not be reliably predicted based on clinical semiology or lobar localization of SOZs. Our findings document the feasibility and safety of bilateral multisite sampling from the human thalamus. This may allow more personalized thalamic targets to be identified for neuromodulation. Future studies are needed to determine if a personalized thalamic neuromodulation leads to greater improvements in clinical outcome.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1093/brain/awad121\n\nView details for PubMedID 37137813\n\nAbstract\n\nFocused ultrasound (FUS) has the potential to modulate regional brain excitability and possibly aid seizure control; however, effects on behavior of FUS used as a seizure therapy are unknown. This study explores behavioral effects and hippocampal restoration induced by pulsed FUS in a kainic acid (KA) animal model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Twenty-nine male Sprague-Dawley rats were observed for 20weeks with anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and behavioral performance evaluations, comprising measures of anxiety, limb usage, sociability, and memory. FUS targeted to the right hippocampus was given 9 and 14weeks after KA was delivered to the right amygdala. Ultrasound pulsations were delivered with the acoustic settings of 0.25 of mechanical index, 0.5 W/cm2 of intensity spatial peak temporal average (ISPTA), 100Hz of pulse repetition frequency, and 30% of duty cycle, during three consecutive pulse trains of 10min separated by 5-min rests. Controls included normal animals with sham injections and KA-exposed animals without FUS exposure. Longitudinal MRI observations showed that FUS substantially protected hippocampal and striatal structures from KA-induced atrophy. KA alone increased anxiety, impaired contralateral limb usage, and reduced sociability and learning. Two courses of FUS sonications partially ameliorated these impairments by enhancing exploring and learning, balancing limb usage, and increasing social interaction. The histology results indicated that two sonications enhanced neuroprotection effect and decreased the inflammation markers induced by KA. This study supports existence of both neuroprotective and beneficial behavioral effects from low-intensity pulsed ultrasound in the KA animal model of epilepsy.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1007/s13311-023-01363-7\n\nView details for PubMedID 36917440\n\nAbstract\n\nNeuromodulation (neurostimulation) is a relatively new and rapidly growing treatment for refractory epilepsy. Three varieties are approved in the US: vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), deep brain stimulation (DBS) and responsive neurostimulation (RNS). This article reviews thalamic DBS for epilepsy. Among many thalamic sub-nuclei, DBS for epilepsy has been targeted to the anterior nucleus (ANT), centromedian nucleus (CM), dorsomedial nucleus (DM) and pulvinar (PULV). Only ANT is FDA-approved, based upon a controlled clinical trial. Bilateral stimulation of ANT reduced seizures by 40.5% at three months in the controlled phase (p = .038) and 75% by 5 years in the uncontrolled phase. Side effects related to paresthesias, acute hemorrhage, infection, occasional increased seizures, and usually transient effects on mood and memory. Efficacy was best documented for focal onset seizures in temporal or frontal lobe. CM stimulation may be useful for generalized or multifocal seizures and PULV for posterior limbic seizures. Mechanisms of DBS for epilepsy are largely unknown, but animal work points to changes in receptors, channels, neurotransmitters, synapses, network connectivity and neurogenesis. Personalization of therapies, in terms of connectivity of the seizure onset zone to the thalamic sub- nucleus and individual characteristics of the seizures, might lead to improved efficacy. Many questions remain about DBS, including the best candidates for different types of neuromodulation, the best targets, the best stimulation parameters, how to minimize side effects and how to deliver current noninvasively. Despite the questions, neuromodulation provides useful new opportunities to treat people with refractory seizures not responding to medicines and not amenable to resective surgery.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.nbd.2023.106045\n\nView details for PubMedID 36809846\n\nAbstract\n\nOBJECTIVE: Focused ultrasound ablation (FUSA) is an emerging treatment for neurological and psychiatric diseases. We describe the initial experience from a pilot, open-label, single-center, clinical trial of unilateral anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT) FUSA in patients with treatment-refractory epilepsy.METHODS: Two adult subjects with treatment-refractory, focal-onset epilepsy were recruited. The subjects received ANT FUSA using the Exablate Neuro (Insightec, Inc.) system. We determined the safety and feasibility (primary outcomes), and changes in seizure frequency (secondary outcome) at 3, 6 and 12-months. Safety was assessed by the absence of side effects, i.e., new-onset neurological deficits or performance deterioration on neuropsychological testing. Feasibility was defined as the ability to create a lesion within the anterior nucleus. The monthly seizure frequency was compared between baseline and post thalamotomy.RESULTS: The patients tolerated the procedure well without neurological deficits or serious adverse events. One patient experienced a decline in verbal fluency, attention/working memory, and immediate verbal memory. Seizure frequency reduced significantly in both patients: one patient was seizure free at 12-months, and in the second patient, the frequency reduced from 90-100 seizures per month to 3-6 seizures per month.SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first known clinical trial to assess the safety, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of ANT FUSA in adult patients with treatment-refractory focal-onset epilepsy.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1111/epi.17535\n\nView details for PubMedID 36745000\n\nAbstract\n\nOBJECTIVE: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been advocated for various neurological conditions, including epilepsy. A 1-4 mA cathodal current applied to the scalp over a seizure focus can reduce spikes and seizures. This series of four patients with focal status epilepticus is among the first case series to demonstrate benefit of tDCS in the critical care setting.METHODS: Patients in the intensive care unit were referred for tDCS treatment when focal status or clinically-relevant lateralized periodic discharges did not resolve with conventional anti-seizure medications and anesthetics. Battery-powered direct cathodal current at 2 mA was delivered by an ActivaDose (Caputron) tDCS device via a saline soaked sponge on the scalp over the seizure focus. Anode was on the contralateral forehead or shoulder. Treatment was for 30 minutes, repeated twice in a day, then again 1-4 times more over the next few days.RESULTS: Three females and one male, ages 34-68 were treated. Etiologies of status were PRES in association with immunosuppressants for a liver transplant, perinatal hypoxic-ischemic injury, a prior cardioembolic parietal stroke and CNS lupus. tDCS led to significant reduction of interictal spikes (0.78/s to 0.38/s, p<0.0001) in 3 cases and electrographic seizures (3.83/hr to 0/hr, p<0.001) in two cases. Medication reductions were enabled in all cases subsequent to tDCS. The only side effect of tDCS was transient erythema under the sponge in one case. Two patients died of causes unrelated to tDCS, one was discharged to a nursing home and one became fully responsive as seizures were controlled with tDCS.SIGNIFICANCE: Spikes and electrographic seizure frequency significantly improved within a day of tDCS. Results are potentially confounded by multiple ongoing changes in medications and treatments. These results might encourage further investigation of tDCS in the critical care setting, but verification by controlled studies will be required.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1111/epi.17514\n\nView details for PubMedID 36661376\n\nAbstract\n\nOBJECTIVE: In this paper, we present a robust version of the well-known exact low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (eLORETA) technique, named ReLORETA, to localize brain sources in the presence of different forward model uncertainties.METHODS: We first assume that the true lead field matrix is a transformation of the existing lead field matrix distorted by uncertainties and propose an iterative approach to estimate this transformation accurately. Major sources of the forward model uncertainties, including differences in geometry, conductivity, and source space resolution between the real and simulated head models, and misaligned electrode positions, are then simulated to test the proposed method.RESULTS: ReLORETA and eLORETA are applied to simulated focal sources in different regions of the brain and the presence of various noise levels as well as real data from a patient with focal epilepsy. The results show that ReLORETA is considerably more robust and accurate than eLORETA in all cases.CONCLUSION: Having successfully dealt with the forward model uncertainties, ReLORETA proved to be a promising method for real-world clinical applications.SIGNIFICANCE: eLORETA is one of the localization techniques that could be used to study brain activity for medical applications such as determining the epileptogenic zone in patients with medically refractory epilepsy. However, the major limitation of eLORETA is sensitivity to the uncertainties in the forward model. Since this problem can substantially undermine its performance in real-world applications where the exact lead field matrix is unknown, developing a more robust method capable of dealing with these uncertainties is of significant interest.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1109/TBME.2022.3202751\n\nView details for PubMedID 36136923\n\nAbstract\n\nThe relationship between antiseizure drugs and movement disorders is complex and not adequately reviewed so far. Antiseizure drugs as a treatment for tremor and other entities such as myoclonus and restless leg syndrome is the most common scenario, although the scientific evidence supporting their use is variable. However, antiseizure drugs also represent a potential cause of iatrogenic movement disorders, with parkinsonism and tremor the most common disorders. Many other antiseizure drug-induced movement disorders are possible and not always correctly identified. This review was conducted by searching for all the possible combinations between 15 movement disorders (excluding ataxia) and 24 antiseizure drugs. The main objective was to describe the movement disorders treated and worsened or induced by antiseizure drugs. We also summarized the proposed mechanisms and risk factors involved in the complex interaction between antiseizure drugs and movement disorders. Antiseizure drugs mainly used to treat movement disorders are clonazepam, gabapentin, lacosamide, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, perampanel, phenobarbital, pregabalin, primidone, topiramate, and zonisamide. Antiseizure drugs that worsen or induce movement disorders are cenobamate, ethosuximide, felbamate, lamotrigine, phenytoin, tiagabine, and vigabatrin. Antiseizure drugs with a variable effect on movement disorders are carbamazepine and valproate while no effect on movement disorders has been reported for brivaracetam, eslicarbazepine, lacosamide, and stiripentol. Although little information is available on the adverse effects or benefits on movement disorders of newer antiseizure drugs (such as brivaracetam, cenobamate, eslicarbazepine, lacosamide, and rufinamide), the evidence collected in this review should guide the choice of antiseizure drugs in patients with concomitant epilepsy and movement disorders. Finally, these notions can lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology and treatments of movement disorders.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1007/s40263-022-00937-x\n\nView details for PubMedID 35861924\n\nAbstract\n\nNeuromodulation is a key therapeutic tool for clinicians managing patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. Multiple devices are available with long-term follow-up and real-world experience. The aim of this review is to give a practical summary of available neuromodulation techniques to guide selection of modalities, focusing on patient selection for devices, common approaches and techniques for initiation of programming, and outpatient management issues. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), deep brain stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus (DBS-ANT), and responsive neurostimulation (RNS) are all supported by randomized controlled trials that show safety and a significant impact on seizure reduction, as well as a suggestion of reduction in the risk of sudden unexplained death from epilepsy (SUDEP). Significant seizure reductions are observed after 3 months for DBS, RNS, and VNS in randomized controlled trials, and efficacy appears to improve with time out to 7-10years of follow-up for all modalities, albeit in uncontrolled follow-up or retrospective studies. A significant number of patients experience seizure-free intervals of 6 months or more with all three modalities. Number and location of epileptogenic foci are important factors affecting efficacy, and together with co-morbidities such as severe mood or sleep disorders, may influence choice of modality. Programming has evolved - DBS is typically initiated at lower current/voltage than used in the pivotal trial while charge density is lower with RNS, but generalizable optimal parameters are yet to be defined. Non-invasive brain stimulation is an emerging stimulation modality, although currently not widely used. Clinical practice has evolved from those established in pivotal trials. Guidance is available for clinicians wishing to expand their approach, and choice of neuromodulation technique may be tailored to individual patients based on their epilepsy characteristics, risk tolerance, and preferences.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1111/epi.17329\n\nView details for PubMedID 35700144\n\nAbstract\n\nOBJECTIVE: Electrical source localization (ESI) can help to identify the seizure onset zone or propagation zone, but it is unclear how dipole localization techniques influence surgical planning.METHODS: Patients who received a high density (HD)-EEG from 7/2014-7/2019 at Stanford were included if they met the following inclusion criteria: (1) adequate epileptiform discharges were recorded for source localization analysis, (2) underwent surgical treatment, which was at least 6 months before the survey. Interictal ESI was performed with the LORETA method on age matched MRIs. Six neurophysiologists from the Stanford Epilepsy Program independently reviewed each case through an HIPPA-protected online survey. The same cases were presented again with additional data from the HD-EEG study. Ratings of how much the HD-EEG findings added value and in what way were recorded.RESULTS: Fifty out of 202 patients met the inclusion criteria, providing a total of 276h of HDEEG recordings. All patients had video EEG recordings and at least one brain MRI, 88 % had neuropsychological testing, 78 % had either a PET or SPECT scan. Additional HD-EEG information was rated as helpful in 83.8 %, not useful in 14.4 % and misleading in 1.8 % of cases. In 20.4 % of cases the HD-EEG information altered decision-making in a major way, such as choosing a different surgical procedure, avoidance of invasive recording or suggesting placement of invasive electrodes in a lobe not previously planned. In 21.5 % of cases, HD-EEG changed the plan in a minor way, e.g., extra invasive electrodes near the previously planned sites in the same sub-lobar region. In 42.3 % cases, HD-EEG did not change their plan but provided confirmation. In cases with normal MRI, additional HD-EEG information was more likely to change physicians' decision making during presurgical process when compared to the cases with MRI-visible lesions (53.3 % vs. 34.3 %, p=0.002). Among patients achieving Engel class I/II outcome, the concordance rate of HD-EEG and resection zone was 64.7 % versus 35.3 % with class III/IV (p=0.028).CONCLUSION: HD-EEG assists presurgical planning for refractory epilepsy patients, with a higher yield in patients with non-lesional MRIs. Concordance of HD-EEG dipole analysis localization and resection site is a favorable outcome indicator.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.clineuro.2022.107336\n\nView details for PubMedID 35716454\n\nAbstract\n\nFocused ultrasound (FUS) has potential utility for modulating regional brain excitability and possibly aiding seizure control; however, the duration of any beneficial effect is unknown. This study explores the efficacy and time course of a short series of pulsed FUS in suppressing EEG epileptiform spikes/bursts in a kainic acid (KA) animal model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Forty-four male Sprague-Dawley rats were recorded for 14 weeks with EEG while software calculated EEG numbers of epileptiform spikes and bursts (â¥ 3 spikes/s). Four regimens of FUS given in a single session at week 7 were evaluated, with mechanical index (MI) ranging from 0.25 to 0.75, intensity spatial peak temporal average (ISPTA) from 0.1 to 2.8 W per cm2, duty cycle from 1 to 30%, and three consecutive pulse trains for 5 or 10 min each. Controls included sham injections in four and KA without FUS in eleven animals. Histological analysis investigated tissue effects. All animals receiving KA evidenced EEG spikes, averaging 10,378 Â± 1651 spikes per 8 h and 1255 Â± 199 bursts per 8 h by weeks 6-7. The KA-only group showed a 30% of increase in spikes and bursts by week 14. Compared to the KA-only group, spike counts were reduced by about 25%, burst counts by about 33%, and burst durations by about 50% with FUS. Behavioral seizures were not analyzed, but electrographic seizures longer than 10 s declined up to 70% after some FUS regimens. Repeated-measure ANOVA showed a significant effect of higher intensity and longer sonication duration FUS treatment using 0.75-MI, ISPTA 2.8 W/cm2, 30% duty cycle for 10-min sonications (group effect, F (4, 15) = 6.321, p < 0.01; interaction effect, F (44, 165) = 1.726, p < 0.01), with the hippocampal protective effect lasting to week 14, accompanied by decreased inflammation and gliosis effect. In contrast, spike and burst suppression were achieved using an FUS regimen with 0.25-MI ISPTA 0.5 W/cm2, 30% duty cycle for 10-min sonications. This regimen reduced inflammation and gliosis at weeks 8-14 and protected hippocampal tissue. This study demonstrates that low-intensity pulsed ultrasound can modulate epileptiform activity for up to 7 weeks and, if replicated in the clinical setting, might be a practical treatment for epilepsy.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1007/s13311-022-01250-7\n\nView details for PubMedID 35581489\n\nAbstract\n\nINTRODUCTION: The Personal Impact of Epilepsy Scale (PIES) assesses patient functional status in subscales of (1) seizure impact, (2) medication effects, (3) mood & social status, and (4) overall quality of life. This study was designed to determine the Minimal Clinically Important Change (MCID) in PIES subscale and total scores that demonstrate improvement.METHODS: To ascertain the correspondence of PIES score change and clinical status change (improved, same, worse) in each PIES subscale and total score, we used two distinct retrospective anchor-based assessments of clinical status (patient self-assessment and trained rater assessment) across two clinic visits. Mean PIES scores were compared between clinical status groups, controlling for days between visits and initial clinical status. Personal Impact of Epilepsy Scale score change was quantified for each group to determine MCID. A small prospective proof-of-concept study was conducted in a separate subject group.RESULTS: Patient self-report anchor analysis demonstrated lower (better) PIES scores in the \"improved\" group vs the \"worse\" group on the mood & social subscale (p < .001) and total score (p = .002), with a similar trend on the seizure subscale (p = 0.056). Clinical rater anchor analysis demonstrated lower PIES scores in the \"improved\" vs \"worse\" group in the mood & social subscale (p = .029) and a trend in total score (p = .082). For the \"improved\" group, the reduction in PIES scores between visits averaged across both anchor analyses was 8.14% for subscales and 8.67% for total score.DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Reduction of 8% on a PIES subscale or total score indicates meaningful improvement in patient clinical status, and is designated the MCID for this instrument. Personal Impact of Epilepsy Scale can be useful in day-to-day clinical care and as an outcome metric in clinical research.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.yebeh.2022.108691\n\nView details for PubMedID 35453042\n\nAbstract\n\nStimulation of the ventromedial hypothalamic region in animals has been reported to cause attack behavior labeled as sham-rage without offering information about the internal affective state of the animal being stimulated.To examine the causal effect of electrical stimulation near the ventromedial region of the human hypothalamus on the human subjective experience and map the electrophysiological connectivity of the hypothalamus with other brain regions.We examined a patient (Subject S20_150) with intracranial electrodes implanted across 170 brain regions, including the hypothalamus. We combined direct electrical stimulation with tractography, cortico-cortical evoked potentials (CCEP), and functional connectivity using resting state intracranial electroencephalography (EEG).Recordings in the hypothalamus did not reveal any epileptic abnormalities. Electrical stimulations near the ventromedial hypothalamus induced profound shame, sadness, and fear but not rage or anger. When repeated single-pulse stimulations were delivered to the hypothalamus, significant responses were evoked in the amygdala, hippocampus, ventromedial-prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortices, anterior cingulate, as well as ventral-anterior and dorsal-posterior insula. The time to first peak of these evoked responses varied and earliest propagations correlated best with the measures of resting-state EEG connectivity and tractography.This patient's case offers details about the affective state induced by the stimulation of the human hypothalamus and provides causal evidence relevant to current theories of emotion and the importance of subcortical structures in processing emotions. The complexity of affective state induced by the stimulation of the hypothalamus and the profile of hypothalamic electrophysiological connectivity suggest that the hypothalamus ought to be seen as a causally important functional unit, within a broader human telencephalon, for our human subjective experience.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.brs.2022.04.008\n\nView details for PubMedID 35413481\n\nAbstract\n\nThe impact of repetitive magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on cortex varies with stimulation parameters, so it would be useful to develop a biomarker to rapidly judge effects on cortical activity, including regions other than motor cortex. This study evaluated rTMS-evoked EEG potentials (TEP) after 1 Hz of motor cortex stimulation. New features are controls for baseline amplitude and comparison to control groups of sham stimulation. We delivered 200 test pulses at 0.20 Hz before and after 1500 treatment pulses at 1 Hz. Sequences comprised AAA = active stimulation with the same coil for test-treat-test phases (n = 22); PPP = realistic placebo coil stimulation for all three phases (n = 10); and APA = active coil stimulation for tests and placebo coil stimulation for treatment (n = 15). Signal processing displayed the evoked EEG waveforms, and peaks were measured by software. ANCOVA was used to measure differences in TEP peak amplitudes in post-rTMS trials while controlling for pre-rTMS TEP peak amplitude. Post hoc analysis showed reduced P60 amplitude in the active (AAA) rTMS group versus the placebo (APA) group. The N100 peak showed a treatment effect compared to the placebo groups, but no pairwise post hoc differences. N40 showed a trend toward increase. Changes were seen in widespread EEG leads, mostly ipsilaterally. TMS-evoked EEG potentials showed reduction of the P60 peak and increase of the N100 peak, both possibly reflecting increased slow inhibition after 1 Hz of rTMS. TMS-EEG may be a useful biomarker to assay brain excitability at a seizure focus and elsewhere, but individual responses are highly variable, and the difficulty of distinguishing merged peaks complicates interpretation.\n\nView details for DOI 10.3390/s22051762\n\nView details for PubMedID 35270910\n\nAbstract\n\nLight flashes, patterns, or color changes can provoke seizures in up to 1 in 4000 persons. Prevalence may be higher because of selection bias. The Epilepsy Foundation reviewed light-induced seizures in 2005. Since then, images on social media, virtual reality, three-dimensional (3D) movies, and the Internet have proliferated. Hundreds of studies have explored the mechanisms and presentations of photosensitive seizures, justifying an updated review. This literature summary derives from a nonsystematic literature review via PubMed using the terms \"photosensitive\" and \"epilepsy.\" The photoparoxysmal response (PPR) is an electroencephalography (EEG) phenomenon, and photosensitive seizures (PS) are seizures provoked by visual stimulation. Photosensitivity is more common in the young and in specific forms of generalized epilepsy. PS can coexist with spontaneous seizures. PS are hereditable and linked to recently identified genes. Brain imaging usually is normal, but special studies imaging white matter tracts demonstrate abnormal connectivity. Occipital cortex and connected regions are hyperexcitable in subjects with light-provoked seizures. Mechanisms remain unclear. Video games, social media clips, occasional movies, and natural stimuli can provoke PS. Virtual reality and 3D images so far appear benign unless they contain specific provocative content, for example, flashes. Images with flashes brighter than 20 candelas/m2 at 3-60 (particularly 15-20) Hz occupying at least 10 to 25% of the visual field are a risk, as are red color flashes or oscillating stripes. Equipment to assay for these characteristics is probably underutilized. Prevention of seizures includes avoiding provocative stimuli, covering one eye, wearing dark glasses, sitting at least two meters from screens, reducing contrast, and taking certain antiseizure drugs. Measurement of PPR suppression in a photosensitivity model can screen putative antiseizure drugs. Some countries regulate media to reduce risk. Visually-induced seizures remain significant public health hazards so they warrant ongoing scientific and regulatory efforts and public education.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1111/epi.17175\n\nView details for PubMedID 35132632\n\nAbstract\n\nDeep brain stimulation of the anterior nuclei of thalamus (ANT-DBS) is effective for reduction of seizures, but little evidence is available to guide practitioners in the practical use of this therapy. In an attempt to fill this gap, a questionnaire with 37 questions was circulated to 578clinicians who were either engaged in clinical trials of or known users of DBS for epilepsy, with responses from 141, of whom 58.2% were epileptologists and 28.4% neurosurgeons. Multiple regions of the world were represented. The survey found that the best candidates for DBS were considered those with temporal or frontal seizures, refractory to at least two medicines. Motivations for renewing therapy upon battery depletion were reduced convulsive, impaired awareness, and severe seizures and improved quality of life. Targeting of leads mainly was by magnetic resonance imaging, sometimes with intraoperative imaging or microelectrode recording. The majority used transventricular approaches. Stimulation parameters mostly imitated the SANTE study parameters, except for initial stimulation amplitudes in the 2-3-V or -mA range, versus 5V in the SANTE study. Stimulation intensity was most often increased or reduced, respectively, for lack of efficacy or side effects, but changes in active contacts, cycle time, and pulse duration were also employed. Mood or memory problems or paresthesias were the side effects most responsible for adjustments. Off-label sites stimulated included centromedian thalamus, hippocampus, neocortex, and a few others. Several physicians used DBS in conjunction with vagus nerve stimulation or responsive neurostimulation, although our study did not track efficacy for combined use. Experienced users varied more from published parameters than did inexperienced users. In conclusion, surveys of experts can provide Class IV evidence for the most prevalent practical use of ANT-DBS. We present a flowchart for one protocol combining common practices. Controlled comparisons will be needed to choose the best approach.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1111/epi.17094\n\nView details for PubMedID 34697794\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT) is an effective therapy for patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. Best practices for surgical targeting of the ANT can be refined as new information becomes available regarding effective stimulation sites.OBJECTIVE: To conduct a retrospective analysis of the relationship between outcomes (seizure reduction during year 1) and DBS lead locations in subjects from the SANTE pivotal trial (Stimulation of ANT for Epilepsy) based upon recent clinical findings.METHODS: Postoperative images from SANTE subjects (n=101) were evaluated with respect to lead trajectory relative to defined anatomic landmarks. A qualitative scoring system was used to rate each lead placement for proximity to an identified target region above the junction of the mammillothalamic tract with the ANT. Each subject was assigned a bilateral lead placement score, and these scores were then compared to clinical outcomes.RESULTS: Approximately 70% of subjects had \"good\" bilateral lead placements based upon location with respect to the defined target. These subjects had a much higher probability of being a clinical responder (>50% seizure reduction) than those with scores reflecting suboptimal lead placements (43.5% vs 21.9%, P<.05).CONCLUSION: Consistent with experience from more established DBS indications, our findings and other recent reports suggest that there may be specific sites within the ANT that are associated with superior clinical outcomes. It will be important to continue to evaluate these relationships and the evolution of other clinical practices (eg, programming) to further optimize this therapy.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1093/neuros/nyab186\n\nView details for PubMedID 34161589\n\nAbstract\n\nOBJECTIVE: We evaluated the efficacy and safety of deep brain anterior thalamus stimulation after 7 and 10years, and report the incidence of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) and overall mortality in adults in the Stimulation of the Anterior Nucleus of the Thalamus for Epilepsy (SANTE) study.METHODS: After the 3-month blinded and 9-month unblinded phases, subjects continued to be assessed during long-term follow-up (LTFU) and later a continued therapy access phase (CAP), to further characterize adverse events and the incidence of SUDEP. Stimulus parameter and medication changes were allowed.RESULTS: One hundred ten implanted subjects accumulated a total of 938 device-years of experience (69 subjects during the LTFU phase and 61 subjects in the CAP phase). Prior to study closure, 57 active subjects continued therapy at 14 study centers, with follow-up of at least 10 (maximum 14) years. At 7years, median seizure frequency percent reduction from baseline was 75% (p<.001), with no outcome differences related to prior vagus nerve stimulation or resective surgery. The most severe seizure type, focal to bilateral tonic-clonic, was reduced by 71%. Adding new antiseizure medications did not impact the pattern of seizure reduction over time. There were no unanticipated serious adverse events in the study. The definite-plus-probable SUDEP rate, based on SANTE study experience (two deaths in 938years) and previous pilot studies (0 deaths in 76years), indicated a rate of 2.0 deaths for 1000 person-years. Overall mortality was 6.9 deaths per 1000 person-years.SIGNIFICANCE: The long-term efficacy and safety profiles of the deep brain stimulation (DBS) system for epilepsy are favorable and demonstrate stable outcomes. Improvement in frequency of the most severe seizure type may reduce SUDEP risk. The SUDEP rate with DBS (2.0) is comparable to other neuromodulation treatments (i.e., vagus nerve stimulation, responsive neurostimulation) for drug-resistant focal epilepsy.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1111/epi.16895\n\nView details for PubMedID 33830503\n\nAbstract\n\nStatus epilepticus (SE) is associated with significant mortality, cost, and risk of future seizures. In one of the first studies of SE after neurosurgery, the authors assess the incidence, risk factors, and outcome of postneurosurgical SE (PNSE).Neurosurgical admissions from the MarketScan Claims and Encounters database (2007 through 2015) were assessed in a longitudinal cross-sectional sample of privately insured patients who underwent qualifying cranial procedures in the US and were older than 18 years of age. The incidence of early (in-hospital) and late (postdischarge readmission) SE and associated mortality was assessed. Procedural, pathological, demographic, and anatomical covariates parameterized multivariable logistic regression and Cox models. Multivariable logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models were used to study the incidence of early and late PNSE. A risk-stratification simulation was performed, combining individual predictors into singular risk estimates.A total of 197,218 admissions (218,217 procedures) were identified. Early PNSE occurred during 637 (0.32%) of 197,218 admissions for cranial neurosurgical procedures. A total of 1045 (0.56%) cases of late PNSE were identified after 187,771 procedure admissions with nonhospice postdischarge follow-up. After correction for comorbidities, craniotomy for trauma, hematoma, or elevated intracranial pressure was associated with increased risk of early PNSE (adjusted OR [aOR] 1.538, 95% CI 1.183-1.999). Craniotomy for meningioma resection was associated with an increased risk of early PNSE compared with resection of metastases and parenchymal primary brain tumors (aOR 2.701, 95% CI 1.388-5.255). Craniotomies for infection or abscess (aHR 1.447, 95% CI 1.016-2.061) and CSF diversion (aHR 1.307, 95% CI 1.076-1.587) were associated with highest risk of late PNSE. Use of continuous electroencephalography in patients with early (p < 0.005) and late (p < 0.001) PNSE rose significantly over the study time period. The simulation regression model predicted that patients at high risk for early PNSE experienced a 1.10% event rate compared with those at low risk (0.07%). Similarly, patients predicted to be at highest risk for late PNSE were significantly more likely to eventually develop late PNSE than those at lowest risk (HR 54.16, 95% CI 24.99-104.80).Occurrence of early and late PNSE was associated with discrete neurosurgical pathologies and increased mortality. These data provide a framework for prospective validation of clinical and perioperative risk factors and indicate patients for heightened diagnostic suspicion of PNSE.\n\nView details for DOI 10.3171/2020.10.JNS202895\n\nView details for PubMedID 33990087\n\nAbstract\n\nSIGNIFICANCE: Online seizure diaries offer a wealth of information regarding real world experience of patients living with epilepsy. Free text notes (FTN) written by patients reflect concerns and priorities of patients and provide supplemental information to structured diary data.OBJECTIVE: This project evaluated feasibility using an automated lexical analysis to identify FTN relevant to seizure clusters (SCs).METHODS: Data were extracted from EpiDiary, a free electronic epilepsy diary with 42,799 unique users, generating 1,096,168 entries and 247,232 FTN. Both structured data as well as FTN were analyzed for presence of SC. A pilot study was conducted to validate an automated lexical analysis algorithm to identify SC in FTN in a sample of 98 diaries. The lexical analysis was then applied to the entire dataset. Outcomes included cluster prevalence and frequency, as well as the types of triggers commonly reported.RESULTS: At least one FTN was found among 13,987 (32.68%) individual diaries. An automated lexical analysis algorithm identified 5797 of FTN as SC. There were 2423 unique patients with SC that were not identified by structured data alone and were identified using lexical analysis of FTN only. Seizure clusters were identified in n = 10,331 (24.1%) of diary users through both structured data and FTN. The median number of SCs days per year was 13.7, (interquartile rank (IQR): 3.2-54.7). The median number of seizures in a cluster day was 3 (IQR 2-4). The most common missed medication linked to patients with SC was levetiracetam (n = 576, 29%) followed by lamotrigine (n = 495, 24%), topiramate (n = 208, 10.5%), carbamazepine (n = 190, 9.6%), and lacosamide (n = 170, 8.6%). These percentages generally reflected prevalence of medication use in this population. The use of rescue medications was documented in 3306 of structured entries and 4305 in FTN.CONCLUSION: This exploratory study demonstrates a novel approach applying lexical analysis to previously untapped FTN in a large electronic seizure diary database. Free text notes captured information about SC not available from the structured diary data. Diary FTN contain information of high importance to people with epilepsy, written in their own words.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.yebeh.2020.107498\n\nView details for PubMedID 33096508\n\nAbstract\n\nA phase I feasibility study to determine the accuracy of identifying seizures based on audio recordings.We systematically generated 166 audio clips of 30 s duration from 83 patients admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit between 1/2015 and 12/2016, with one clip during a seizure period and one clip during a non-seizure control period for each patient. Five epileptologists performed a blinded review of the audio clips and rated whether a seizure occurred or not, and indicated the confidence level (low or high) of their rating. The accuracy of individual and consensus ratings were calculated.The overall performance of the consensus rating between the five epileptologists showed a positive predictive value (PPV) of 0.91 and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 0.66. The performance improved when confidence was high (PPV of 0.96, NPV of 0.70). The agreement between the epileptologists was moderate with a kappa of 0.584. Hyperkinetic (PPV 0.92, NPV 0.86) and tonic-clonic (PPV and NPV 1.00) seizures were most accurately identified. Seizures with automatisms only and non-motor seizures could not be accurately identified. Specific seizure-related sounds associated with accurate identification included disordered breathing (PPV and NPV 1.00), rhythmic sounds (PPV 0.93, NPV 0.80), and ictal vocalizations (PPV 1.00, NPV 0.97).This phase I feasibility study shows that epileptologists are able to accurately identify certain seizure types from audio recordings when the seizures produce sounds. This provides guidance for the development of audio-based seizure detection devices and demonstrate which seizure types could potentially be detected.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.seizure.2020.03.008\n\nView details for PubMedID 32276233\n\nAbstract\n\nA clinical feasibility study was undertaken at a single center of long-term intra-cerebroventricular drug delivery of the anti-seizure medication valproic acid, into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in order to treat drug resistant focal seizures, using an implantable infusion system. The primary objective was to establish the dose range of VPA administered in this manner. Secondarily, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and a preliminary estimate of effectiveness were evaluated.In this single arm study, five adult subjects, with 29-234 focal onset seizures per month from a seizure focus involving the mesial temporal lobe were implanted with the system (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT02899611). Oral valproic acid (VPA) had previously been ineffective in all subjects. Post-surgery, pharmacokinetic studies of CSF infused VPA were performed. Valproic acid doses were increased stepwise in a standardised protocol.The procedure and implantation were well-tolerated by all subjects. Four subjects responded with > 50% seizure reduction at the highest tested dose of 160 mg/day. Two subjects experienced extended periods of complete seizure freedom. All five subjects reported significant quality of life improvement. No clinical dose limiting side effects were encountered and there was no evidence of local periventricular toxicity in three subjects who were evaluated with imaging (T2 MRI). Side effects included nausea and appetite loss but were not dose-limiting. Mean CSF valproic acid levels were 45 Î¼g per ml (range 20-120 Î¼g per ml), with corresponding serum levels of 4-14 Î¼g per ml. Subjects have received therapy for up to 2.5 years in total . The efficacy analysis presented focuses on the period of time with the current pump with a mean 12.5 months, range 11.5-15 months. Pump failure requiring reimplantation was a significant initial issue in all subjects but resolved with use of pumps suitably compatible with long-term exposure to valproic acid.The study demonstrated that chronic intraventricular administration of valproic acid is safe and effective in subjects with medically refractory epilepsy over many months. The procedure for implanting the infusion system is safe and well-tolerated. High CSF levels are achieved with corresponding low serum levels and this therapy is shown to be effective despite unsuccessful earlier use of oral valproate preparations. Drug side effects were minimal.The study was funded by Cerebral Therapeutics Inc., Suite 137 12635 East Montview Blvd Aurora CO 80045.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.eclinm.2020.100326\n\nView details for PubMedID 32395709\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC7205744\n\nAbstract\n\nThe goal of this study was to investigate the spatial extent and functional organization of the epileptogenic network through cortico-cortical evoked potentials (CCEPs) in patients being evaluated with intracranial stereoelectroencephalography.We retrospectively included 25 patients. We divided the recorded sites into three regions: epileptogenic zone (EZ); propagation zone (PZ); and noninvolved zone (NIZ). The root mean square of the amplitudes was calculated to reconstruct effective connectivity network. We also analyzed the N1/N2 amplitudes to explore the responsiveness influenced by epileptogenicity. Prognostic analysis was performed by comparing intra-region and inter-region connectivity between seizure-free and non-seizure-free groups.Our results confirmed that stimulation of the EZ caused the strongest responses on other sites within and outside the EZ. Moreover, we found a hierarchical connectivity pattern showing the highest connectivity strength within EZ, and decreasing connectivity gradient from EZ, PZ to NIZ. Prognostic analysis indicated a stronger intra-EZ connection in the seizure-free group.The EZ showed highest excitability and dominantly influenced other regions. Quantitative CCEPs can be useful in mapping epileptic networks and predicting surgical outcome.The generated computational connectivity model may enhance our understanding of epileptogenic networks and provide useful information for surgical planning and prognosis prediction.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.clinph.2020.08.012\n\nView details for PubMedID 32957038\n\nAbstract\n\nChildren with benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes have rare seizures emerging from the motor cortex, which they outgrow in adolescence, and additionally may have language deficits of unclear etiology. We piloted the use of transcranial magnetic stimulation paired with EMG and EEG (TMS-EMG, TMS-EEG) to test the hypotheses that net cortical excitability decreases with age and that use-dependent plasticity predicts learning.We assessed language and motor learning in 14 right-handed children with benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes. We quantified two TMS metrics of left motor cortex excitability: the resting motor threshold (measure of neuronal membrane excitability) and amplitude of the N100-evoked potential (an EEG measure of GABAergic tone). To test plasticity, we applied 1 Hz repetitive TMS to the motor cortex to induce long-term depression-like changes in EMG- and EEG-evoked potentials.Children with benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes tolerate TMS; no seizures were provoked. Resting motor threshold decreases with age but is elevated above maximal stimulator output for half the group. N100 amplitude decreases with age after controlling for resting motor threshold. Motor cortex plasticity correlates significantly with language learning and at a trend level with motor learning.Transcranial magnetic stimulation is safe and feasible for children with benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes, and TMS-EEG provides more reliable outcome measures than TMS-EMG in this group because many children have unmeasurably high resting motor thresholds. Net cortical excitability decreases with age, and motor cortex plasticity predicts not only motor learning but also language learning, suggesting a mechanism by which motor cortex seizures may interact with language development.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1097/WNP.0000000000000662\n\nView details for PubMedID 32142025\n\nAbstract\n\nPURPOSE: Concerns about the impact of open surgery for drug-resistant mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis (MTLE-HS) have driven interest in minimally invasive techniques. Stereo-electro-encephalography guided radiofrequency thermocoagulation (SEEG guided RF-TC) offers an alternative choice but with currently limited efficacy. We developed a procedure for optimally extended thermocoagulative lesions and investigated the efficacy and safety for MTLE-HS in a preliminary observational study.METHODS: From June 2016 to August 2017, twenty-two patients were selected for the present study. They met the criteria of unilateral MTLE-HS after noninvasive evaluation and then underwent implantation of a combination of SEEG electrodes to form a high-density focal stereo-array, including one electrode along the long axis of amygdalohippocampal complex and three orthogonal electrodes to widely sample mesial temporal structures. A unilateral epileptogenic zone of mesial temporal structures was confirmed in these 21 patients. SEEG-guided bipolar coagulations were performed between two contiguous contacts of the same electrode, or between two adjacent contacts of different electrodes.RESULTS: Surgical procedures were well tolerated, with no related complications. At the follow-up of 12 months, 20 patients (95.2%) experienced a >90% decrease in seizure frequency and 16 patients (76.2%) were free of disabling seizures (Engel class I). Among them, eight (38.1%) were classified as Engel class Ia and the other eight (38.1%) as Engel class Ib. Four others (19%) had rare disabling seizures (Engel class II). Only one (4.8%) experienced an Engel class III outcome.CONCLUSION: Optimized SEEG-guided RF-TC is a promising complementary option for the treatment of MTLE-HS.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.seizure.2019.08.011\n\nView details for PubMedID 31521052\n\nAbstract\n\nTo assay EEG signal quality recorded with tripolar concentric ring electrodes (TCREs) compared to regular EEG electrodes.EEG segments were recorded simultaneously by TCREs and regular electrodes, low-pass filtered at 35 Hz (REG35) and 70 Hz (REG70). Clips were rated blindly by nine electroencephalographers for presence or absence of key EEG features, relative to the \"gold-standard\" of the clinical report.TCRE showed less EMG artifact (F = 15.4, p < 0.0001). Overall quality rankings were not significantly different. Focal slowing was better detected by TCRE and spikes were better detected by regular electrodes. Seizures (n = 85) were detected by TCRE in 64 cases (75.3%), by REG70 in 75 (88.2%) and REG35 in 69 (81.2%) electrodes. TCRE detected 9 (10.6%) seizures not detected by one of the other 2 methods. In contrast, 14 seizures (16.5%) were not detected by TCRE, but were by REG35 electrodes. Each electrode detected interictal spikes when the other did not.TCRE produced similar overall quality and confidence ratings versus regular electrodes, but less muscle artifact. TCRE recordings detected seizures in 7% of instances where regular electrodes did not.The combination of the two types increased detection of epileptiform events compared to either alone.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.clinph.2019.10.022\n\nView details for PubMedID 31809982\n\nAbstract\n\nINTRODUCTION: Neuromodulation devices can be safe and effective for the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. A body of scientific work supports peripheral, subcortical and cortical targets, each with different fundamental methods of action. Areas covered: High-quality evidence is available for vagal nerve stimulation (VNS), deep brain stimulation (DBS), and responsive neurostimulation (RNS). Mechanistic research in animals and human studies are reviewed, along with key data from VNS, DBS, and RNS clinical trials. Specifically, the authors review some of the science behind the most frequently used medical devices for neuromodulation, the evidence that lead to their adoption, a delineation of the populations that often benefit from these devices, and perspectives on clinical practice to optimize benefit in treatment of seizures. Expert Commentary: Neuromodulation is increasingly used to complement medical management of refractory epilepsy. Device preference will be made on the basis of patient preference, physician familiarity and other individualized factors. Right now, the field is very new and decision-making will improve with experience.\n\nView details for PubMedID 30526131\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) is a minimally invasive alternative with less cognitive risks compared with traditional surgery for focal drug-resistant epilepsy.OBJECTIVE: We describe seizure outcomes and complications after LITT in our cohort with intractable mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE).MATERIAL AND METHODS: We prospectively tracked Stanford's MTLE cases treated with LITT from October 2014 to October 2017. Primary endpoints were seizure outcomes by (1) Engel classification and (2) reduction in baseline seizure frequency. Secondary outcomes were postablation complications.RESULTS: A total of 30 patients underwent selective amygdalohippocampotomy via LITT. Mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) was present in 23/30 (77%) patients. Median follow-up was 18 Â± 12 months (range: 6-44 months). Almost all 28/29 (97%) patients had >50% reduction, and 22/29 (76%) patients had >90% reduction in seizure frequency. Engel Class I outcome was achieved in 18/29 (62%) patients; with complete seizure freedom in 9/29 (31%) patients (Engel Class IA). Three (10%) patients have had only focal aware seizures (Engel Class 1B). Seizures only occurred with medication withdrawal in 6/29 (21%) patients (Engel Class ID). Class II was achieved by 6/29 (21%) and Class III by 5/29 (17%) patients. Complications included perioperative seizures in 10/29 (34%) and nonseizure complaints in 6/29 (21%) patients. Three (10%) patients had neurological deficits including one permanent superior quadrantanopsia, one transient trochlear, and one transient oculomotor nerve palsy.CONCLUSIONS: Overall, Engel Class I outcome was achieved in 62% of patients with MTLE, and 97% of patients achieved >50% seizure frequency reduction. Complications were largely temporary, though there was one persistent visual field deficit. Laser ablation is well-tolerated and offers marked seizure reduction for the majority of patients.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.yebeh.2018.09.040\n\nView details for PubMedID 30384097\n\nAbstract\n\nGenomic findings are emerging rapidly in 2 large, closely related epilepsy research consortia: the Epilepsy Phenome/Genome Project and Epi4K. Disclosure of individual results to participants in genomic research is increasingly viewed as an ethical obligation, but strategies for return of results were not included in the design of these consortia, raising complexities in establishing criteria for which results to offer, determining participant preferences, managing the large number of sites involved, and covering associated costs. Here, we describe the challenges faced, alternative approaches considered, and progress to date. Experience from these 2 consortia illustrates the importance, for genomic research in epilepsy and other disorders, of including a specific plan for return of results in the study design, with financial support for obtaining clinical confirmation and providing ongoing support for participants. Participant preferences for return of results should be established at the time of enrollment, and methods for allowing future contacts with participants should be included. In addition, methods should be developed for summarizing meaningful, comprehensible information about findings in the aggregate that participants can access in an ongoing way.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1111/epi.14530\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000443303400006\n\nView details for PubMedID 30098010\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC6119474\n\nAbstract\n\nSeveral companies are developing an EEG recording system that uses dry, wireless electrodes, and one has recently been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for medical use. Today, the quality of EEG signals recorded by these dry systems may not always match those of conventionally applied electrodes, but the gap is closing fast. As dry, wireless EEG systems find their way into hospitals and clinics over the next few years, the job of the EEG technologist will change. Dry systems can be placed on like a cap and, after a few minutes of adjustment, begin broadcasting EEG. No longer will it be as necessary to spend time meticulously measuring, cleaning, affixing, and adjusting electrodes on the scalp. This upcoming time of rapid change can be an opportunity to redefine the role of the EEG technologist.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1080/21646821.2018.1490105\n\nView details for PubMedID 30257173\n\nAbstract\n\nThe definition of who has epilepsy, classification of seizure types, and types of epilepsy have all recently been revised. The classical definition of epilepsy as a person having two or more unprovoked seizures more than 24hours apart has been expanded also to include those with one seizure and a high likelihood (more than 60%) of having another. In the new definition, epilepsy is considered to be resolved when a person is seizure-free for 10years, the terminal 5 being off seizure medicines, or when an age-dependent syndrome has been outgrown. The new seizure type classification revises the 1981 system but maintains the primary distinction of focal- versus generalized-onset seizures. Seizures also can be of unknown onset. Focal seizures may demonstrate retention or impairment of awareness, resulting in focal-aware or focal-impaired awareness seizures. Several new focal and generalized seizure types are introduced. Classification of the epilepsies is now by grouping of seizure types, etiologies, comorbidities, and epilepsy syndromes. The goal of the new terminology is greater clarity of communication and more accurate grouping of seizure types for research. Neurodiagnostic technologists can be of great help in observing clinical and electrographic features that will define the type of seizure.\n\nView details for PubMedID 29562876\n\nAbstract\n\nThis companion paper to the introduction of the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) 2017 classification of seizure types provides guidance on how to employ the classification. Illustration of the classification is enacted by tables, a glossary of relevant terms, mapping of old to new terms, suggested abbreviations, and examples. Basic and extended versions of the classification are available, depending on the desired degree of detail. Key signs and symptoms of seizures (semiology) are used as a basis for categories of seizures that are focal or generalized from onset or with unknown onset. Any focal seizure can further be optionally characterized by whether awareness is retained or impaired. Impaired awareness during any segment of the seizure renders it a focal impaired awareness seizure. Focal seizures are further optionally characterized by motor onset signs and symptoms: atonic, automatisms, clonic, epileptic spasms, or hyperkinetic, myoclonic, or tonic activity. Nonmotor-onset seizures can manifest as autonomic, behavior arrest, cognitive, emotional, or sensory dysfunction. The earliest prominent manifestation defines the seizure type, which might then progress to other signs and symptoms. Focal seizures can become bilateral tonic-clonic. Generalized seizures engage bilateral networks from onset. Generalized motor seizure characteristics comprise atonic, clonic, epileptic spasms, myoclonic, myoclonic-atonic, myoclonic-tonic-clonic, tonic, or tonic-clonic. Nonmotor (absence) seizures are typical or atypical, or seizures that present prominent myoclonic activity or eyelid myoclonia. Seizures of unknown onset may have features that can still be classified as motor, nonmotor, tonic-clonic, epileptic spasms, or behavior arrest. This \"users' manual\" for the ILAE 2017 seizure classification will assist the adoption of the new system.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1111/epi.13671\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000398861000009\n\nView details for PubMedID 28276064\n\nAbstract\n\nThe International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) presents a revised operational classification of seizure types. The purpose of such a revision is to recognize that some seizure types can have either a focal or generalized onset, to allow classification when the onset is unobserved, to include some missing seizure types, and to adopt more transparent names. Because current knowledge is insufficient to form a scientifically based classification, the 2017 Classification is operational (practical) and based on the 1981 Classification, extended in 2010. Changes include the following: (1) \"partial\" becomes \"focal\"; (2) awareness is used as a classifier of focal seizures; (3) the terms dyscognitive, simple partial, complex partial, psychic, and secondarily generalized are eliminated; (4) new focal seizure types include automatisms, behavior arrest, hyperkinetic, autonomic, cognitive, and emotional; (5) atonic, clonic, epileptic spasms, myoclonic, and tonic seizures can be of either focal or generalized onset; (6) focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizure replaces secondarily generalized seizure; (7) new generalized seizure types are absence with eyelid myoclonia, myoclonic absence, myoclonic-atonic, myoclonic-tonic-clonic; and (8) seizures of unknown onset may have features that can still be classified. The new classification does not represent a fundamental change, but allows greater flexibility and transparency in naming seizure types.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1111/epi.13670\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000398861000008\n\nView details for PubMedID 28276060\n\nAbstract\n\nBilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT) reduces seizures and is relatively safe but may be accompanied by complaints of memory problems and depression. This study examined incidence of memory and depression adverse events (AE) in the SANTE study blinded phase and their relationship to objective neurobehavioral measures, baseline characteristics, quality of life and long-term neurobehavioral outcome.The neurobehavioral AE and neuropsychological data from a previously reported prospective randomized trial (SANTE) were analyzed. Reliable change indices (RCI) were calculated for memory and mood measures. Analyses examined relationships among AEs, RCIs, demographic and seizure variables, and long-term neurobehavioral outcome.No significant cognitive declines or worsening of depression scores were observed through the blinded phase or in open-label at 7-years. Higher scores were observed at 7 years on measures of executive functions and attention. Depression and memory-related AEs were not associated with reliable change on objective measures or 7-year neurobehavioral outcome. The AEs were without significant impact on life quality. Memory and depression AEs were not related to demographic or seizure characteristics, change in seizure frequency, frequency of AE or depression report.Bilateral ANT DBS was associated with subjective depression and memory AEs during the blinded phase in a minority of patients that were not accompanied by objective, long-term neurobehavioral worsening. Monitoring and neuropsychological assessment of depression and memory are recommended from a theoretical standpoint and because more memory and depression AEs occurred in the active stimulation than control group.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.seizure.2016.12.014\n\nView details for PubMedID 28061418\n\nAbstract\n\nClinical management of epilepsy and current epilepsy therapy trials rely on paper or electronic diaries often with inaccurate self-reported seizure frequency as the primary outcome. This is the first study addressing the feasibility of detecting and recording generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) through a biosensor linked to an online seizure database.A prospective trial was conducted with video-EEG (vEEG) in an epilepsy monitoring unit. Patients wore a wristwatch accelerometer that detected shaking and transmitted events via BluetoothÂ® to a bedside electronic tablet and then via Wi-Fi to an online portal. The watch recorded the date, time, audio, duration, frequency and amplitude of events. Events logged by the watch and recorded in a bedside paper diary were measured against vEEG, the \"gold standard.\"Thirty patients were enrolled and 62 seizures were recorded on vEEG: 31 convulsive and 31 non-convulsive. Twelve patients had a total of 31 convulsive seizures, and of those, 10 patients had 13 GTCS. The watch captured 12/13 (92.3%) GTCS. Watch audio recordings were consistent with seizures in 11/12 (91.6%). Data were successfully transferred to the bedside tablet in 11/12 (91.6%), and to the online database in 10/12 (83.3%) GTCS. The watch recorded 81 false positives, of which 42/81 (51%) were cancelled by the patients. Patients and caregivers verbally reported 15/62 seizures (24.2% sensitivity) but no seizures were recorded on paper logs.Automatic detection and recording of GTCS to an online database is feasible and may be more informative than seizure logging in a paper diary.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.seizure.2016.04.009\n\nView details for PubMedID 27205871\n\nAbstract\n\nThe Automatic Stimulation Mode (AutoStim) feature of the Model 106 Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS) Therapy System stimulates the left vagus nerve on detecting tachycardia. This study evaluates performance, safety of the AutoStim feature during a 3-5-day Epilepsy Monitoring Unit (EMU) stay and long- term clinical outcomes of the device stimulating in all modes.The E-37 protocol (NCT01846741) was a prospective, unblinded, U.S. multisite study of the AspireSR(Â®) in subjects with drug-resistant partial onset seizures and history of ictal tachycardia. VNS Normal and Magnet Modes stimulation were present at all times except during the EMU stay. Outpatient visits at 3, 6, and 12 months tracked seizure frequency, severity, quality of life, and adverse events.Twenty implanted subjects (ages 21-69) experienced 89 seizures in the EMU. 28/38 (73.7%) of complex partial and secondarily generalized seizures exhibited â¥20% increase in heart rate change. 31/89 (34.8%) of seizures were treated by Automatic Stimulation on detection; 19/31 (61.3%) seizures ended during the stimulation with a median time from stimulation onset to seizure end of 35 sec. Mean duty cycle at six-months increased from 11% to 16%. At 12 months, quality of life and seizure severity scores improved, and responder rate was 50%. Common adverse events were dysphonia (n = 7), convulsion (n = 6), and oropharyngeal pain (n = 3).The Model 106 performed as intended in the study population, was well tolerated and associated with clinical improvement from baseline. The study design did not allow determination of which factors were responsible for improvements.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1111/ner.12376\n\nView details for PubMedID 26663671\n\nAbstract\n\nPartial or complete corpus callosotomies have been applied, traditionally via open surgical or radiosurgical approaches, for the treatment of epilepsy in patients with multifocal tonic, atonic, or myoclonic seizures. Minimally invasive methods, such as MRI-guided laser interstitial thermal ablation (MTLA), are being employed to functionally remove or ablate seizure foci in the treatment of epilepsy. This therapy can achieve effectiveness similar to that of traditional resection, but with reduced morbidity compared with open surgery. Here, we present a patient with a history of prior partial corpus callosotomy who continued to suffer from medically refractory epilepsy with bisynchronous onset. We report on the utilization of laser ablation of the splenium in this patient to achieve full corpus callosotomy. Adequate ablation of the splenial remnant was confirmed by postoperative MRI imaging, and at four-month follow-up, the patient's seizure frequency had dropped more than 50%. This is the first reported instance of laser ablation of the splenium to achieve full corpus callosotomy following a previous unsuccessful anterior callosotomy in a patient with intractable generalized epilepsy.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.ebcr.2015.12.003\n\nView details for PubMedID 26955518\n\nAbstract\n\nElectrical stimulation of the septal nuclei via deep brain stimulating electrodes is proposed as a potentially beneficial therapy for medication-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy. In a multicenter study, stimulation of anterior thalamus was shown to reduce numbers of seizures, but decrease was only in the range of 40%. This might be improved with septal stimulation, which has strong and direct reciprocal connections with the hippocampal formation, the structure most involved in temporal lobe epilepsy. Medial septal neurons drive a 3-12Hz theta rhythm in hippocampus of rodents. Theta rhythm is less obvious in human hippocampus, but it is present and it varies with cognitive tasks. The hippocampal theta rhythm is disrupted by seizures. In animal models, restoration of theta by sensory stimulation, septal electrical stimulation or cholinergic drugs infused into septum ameliorates seizures. Seizure activity in hippocampus is faithfully reflected in septal nuclei, and septum sometimes leads the seizure activity. A subset of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy have structural enlargement of their septal nuclei. At high levels of intensity, septal stimulation is subjectively pleasurable and strongly reinforcing. Rats will repeatedly press a bar to stimulate their septum. Initial experience with human septal stimulation in the 1950s was not favorable, with ineffective therapy for schizophrenia and a high rate of surgical complications. Subsequent experience in 50-100 pain patients employing modern neurosurgical techniques was more favorable and demonstrated septal stimulation to be safe and tolerable. The current state of knowledge is sufficient to consider design of a clinical trial of medial septal stimulation in selected patients with medication-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.mehy.2015.02.016\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000355357600004\n\nView details for PubMedID 25771138\n\nAbstract\n\nLittle is known about patterns of seizures that occur multiple times a day, sometimes called clusters or serial seizures.The online diary, My Epilepsy Diary (MED), provided self-reported data from community-based patients to describe the characteristics of clusters.We used MED data to define a population of 5098 community outpatients, including 1177 who specified time of multiple seizures in a 24-hour period. Outcomes included cluster prevalence and frequency, distribution of interseizure time intervals, as well as the types of triggers commonly reported.One-fourth of days with any seizures included clusters for these patients. Most days with clusters included 2 seizures, with >5 events occurring in only 10% of days. One-third of seizures occurred within 3h of the initial event and two-thirds within 6h. When more than 2 seizures occurred, the time to the next seizure decreased from an average of over 2h (to the 3rd event) to a quarter-hour (from the 4th to the 5th event).My Epilepsy Diary data have provided the first overview of cluster seizures in a large community-based population. Treatments with less than 3-hour duration of action would be bioavailable at the time of only one-third of subsequent seizures. Although limited by the self-reported and observational nature of the diary data, some general patterns emerge and can help to focus questions for future studies.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.yebeh.2015.04.022\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000356366900011\n\nView details for PubMedID 26046724\n\nAbstract\n\nIn 2014, the definition of epilepsy was revised by the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE).A conceptual definition of epilepsy was proposed by the ILAE in 2005, as a disorder of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures and by its psychosocial consequences. Practical application of the epilepsy definition usually is taken to mean at least two unprovoked seizures more than 24 h apart, but a 2014 practical definition refines the description. With this definition, epilepsy is a disease of the brain with either: (1) at least two unprovoked (or reflex) seizures occurring more than 24 h apart; (2) one unprovoked (or reflex) seizure and a probability of further seizures similar to the general recurrence risk (at least 60%) after two unprovoked seizures, occurring over the next 10 years; (3) diagnosis of an epilepsy syndrome. Epilepsy is considered to be resolved for individuals past the applicable age of an age-dependent epilepsy syndrome or those who have remained seizure-free for the past 10 years, with no seizure medicines for the past 5 years.A consensus process has refined the definition of epilepsy.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1097/WCO.0000000000000174\n\nView details for PubMedID 25734953\n\nAbstract\n\nTo report long-term efficacy and safety results of the SANTE trial investigating deep brain stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT) for treatment of localization-related epilepsy.This long-term follow-up is a continuation of a previously reported trial of 5- vs 0-V ANT stimulation. Long-term follow-up began 13 months after device implantation with stimulation parameters adjusted at the investigators' discretion. Seizure frequency was determined using daily seizure diaries.The median percent seizure reduction from baseline at 1 year was 41%, and 69% at 5 years. The responder rate (â¥50% reduction in seizure frequency) at 1 year was 43%, and 68% at 5 years. In the 5 years of follow-up, 16% of subjects were seizure-free for at least 6 months. There were no reported unanticipated adverse device effects or symptomatic intracranial hemorrhages. The Liverpool Seizure Severity Scale and 31-item Quality of Life in Epilepsy measure showed statistically significant improvement over baseline by 1 year and at 5 years (p < 0.001).Long-term follow-up of ANT deep brain stimulation showed sustained efficacy and safety in a treatment-resistant population.This long-term follow-up provides Class IV evidence that for patients with drug-resistant partial epilepsy, anterior thalamic stimulation is associated with a 69% reduction in seizure frequency and a 34% serious device-related adverse event rate at 5 years.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1212/WNL.0000000000001334\n\nView details for PubMedID 25663221\n\nAbstract\n\nElectroencephalography is useful for evaluating transient neurological events in the setting of moyamoya disease.EEG findings of adults with moyamoya seen at a large moyamoya referral center are summarized.

Among the study population of 103 patients having EEGs, 24% of adults with moyamoya had a history of clinical seizures. Ischemic or hemorrhagic strokes were associated with a twofold relative risk of seizures. Overall, 90% of EEGs were abnormal, most commonly focally (78%), or diffusely slow (68%). Epileptiform EEG discharges were seen in 24%. Whereas hemispheres with an ischemic stroke had a 19% risk of epileptiform discharges and an 8% risk of seizures on EEG, hemispheres with hemorrhagic stroke had a 35% risk of epileptiform discharges and 19% risk of seizures on EEG. Focal amplitude attenuation was seen in 19%, breach rhythm in 15%, rhythmic delta in 14%, and electrographic seizures in 12%.Seizures and epileptiform EEG changes are common in patients with moyamoya disease.Transient events in patients with moyamoya can result from seizures as well as ischemia.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.clinph.2014.06.033\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000349616700010\n\nView details for PubMedID 25065300\n\nAbstract\n\nSome patients receiving VNS Therapy report benefit from manually activating the generator with a handheld magnet at the time of a seizure. A review of 20 studies comprising 859 subjects identified patients who reported on-demand magnet mode stimulation to be beneficial. Benefit was reported in a weighted average of 45% of patients (range 0-89%) using the magnet, with seizure cessation claimed in a weighted average of 28% (range 15-67%). In addition to seizure termination, patients sometimes reported decreased intensity or duration of seizures or the post-ictal period. One study reported an isolated instance of worsening with magnet stimulation (Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med, 157, 2003 and 560). All of the reviewed studies assessed adjunctive magnet use. No studies were designed to provide Level I evidence of efficacy of magnet-induced stimulation. Retrospective analysis of one pivotal randomized trial of VNS therapy showed significantly more seizures terminated or improved in the active stimulation group vs the control group. Prospective, controlled studies would be required to isolate the effect and benefit of magnet mode stimulation and to document that the magnet-induced stimulation is the proximate cause of seizure reduction. Manual application of the magnet to initiate stimulation is not always practical because many patients are immobilized or unaware of their seizures, asleep or not in reach of the magnet. Algorithms based on changes in heart rate at or near the onset of the seizure provide a methodology for automated responsive stimulation. Because literature indicates additional benefits from on-demand magnet mode stimulation, a potential role exists for automatic activation of stimulation.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1111/ane.12288\n\nView details for PubMedID 25145652\n\nAbstract\n\nThe impact of epilepsy is manifest by effects related to seizures and side effects of therapy and comorbidities such as depression. This report describes the development of a brief patient-reported outcome (PRO) instrument, the Personal Impact of Epilepsy Scale (PIES), to measure the influence of epilepsy overall and in each of these domains.Instrument development followed standard procedures and an FDA Guidance. People with epilepsy were surveyed with open-ended questions to derive major themes of their concerns, resulting in 4 key areas: seizures, side effects, comorbidities, and overall quality of life (QOL). A preliminary set of 152 questions was based on these themes and completed by 50 patients, age 42.7 (range: 21-71) years, concurrent with comparator instruments, including the NH Seizure Severity Scale (NHSSS), the Liverpool Adverse Events Profile (LAEP), the Quality of Life in Epilepsy (QOLIE-31) scale, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Epilepsy Foundation Depression: A Checklist. A multiple regression model indicated which PIES measures were associated with scores from the comparator instruments. Questions in each of the domains were selected for correlations and nonduplication. Test-retest consistency at a 3-day interval was completed by 38 subjects and a final set of questions constructed.The final question set comprised 25 items: 9 about characteristics of seizures, 7 about medication side effects, 8 about comorbidities, and 1 about overall quality of life. All items had 5 response choices (0-4), with higher scores reflecting more negative status. A total of 46 subjects completed the 25 questions. Cronbach's alpha was 0.87, indicating good internal consistency. Each of the three domains correlated well with the overall QOL item. The questions pertaining to seizures correlated with the NHSSS, the side effect questions with the LAEP, and the comorbidity questions with the QOLIE-31.The PIES provides a simple, brief PRO measure as a profile of overall impact of seizures, medication side effects, comorbidities, and overall QOL for people with epilepsy. Further study will explore sensitivity to change quantification of the minimal clinically significant change.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.yebeh.2014.09.060\n\nView details for PubMedID 25450530\n\nAbstract\n\nEpileptic seizures can lead to changes in autonomic function affecting the sympathetic, parasympathetic, and enteric nervous systems. Changes in cardiac signals are potential biomarkers that may provide an extra-cerebral indicator of ictal onset in some patients. Heart rate can be measured easily when compared to other biomarkers that are commonly associated with seizures (e.g., long-term EEG), and therefore it has become an interesting parameter to explore for detecting seizures. Understanding the prevalence and magnitude of heart rate changes associated with seizures, as well as the timing of such changes relative to seizure onset, is fundamental to the development and use of cardiac based algorithms for seizure detection. We reviewed 34 articles that reported the prevalence of ictal tachycardia in patients with epilepsy. Scientific literature supports the occurrence of significant increases in heart rate associated with ictal events in a large proportion of patients with epilepsy (82%) using concurrent electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG). The average percentage of seizures associated with significant heart rate changes was similar for generalized (64%) and partial onset seizures (71%). Intra-individual variability was noted in several articles, with the majority of studies reporting significant increase in heart rate during seizures originating from the temporal lobe. Accurate detection of seizures is likely to require an adjustable threshold given the variability in the magnitude of heart rate changes associated with seizures within and across patients.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.seizure.2014.02.012\n\nView details for PubMedID 24698385\n\nAbstract\n\nNeurostimulation enables adjustable and reversible modulation of disease symptoms, including those of epilepsy. Two types of brain neuromodulation, comprising anterior thalamic deep brain stimulation and responsive neurostimulation at seizure foci, are supported by Class I evidence of effectiveness, and many other sites in the brain have been targeted in small trials of neurostimulation therapy for seizures. Animal studies have mainly assisted in the identification of potential neurostimulation sites and parameters, but much of the clinical work is only loosely based on fundamental principles derived from the laboratory, and the mechanisms by which brain neurostimulation reduces seizures remain poorly understood. The benefits of stimulation tend to increase over time, with maximal effect seen typically 1-2 years after implantation. Typical reductions of seizure frequency are approximately 40% acutely, and 50-69% after several years. Seizure intensity might also be reduced. Complications from brain neurostimulation are mainly associated with the implantation procedure and hardware, including stimulation-related paraesthesias, stimulation-site infections, electrode mistargeting and, in some patients, triggered seizures or even status epilepticus. Further preclinical and clinical experience with brain stimulation surgery should lead to improved outcomes by increasing our understanding of the optimal surgical candidates, sites and parameters.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/nrneurol.2014.59\n\nView details for PubMedID 24709892\n\nAbstract\n\nEpilepsy was defined conceptually in 2005 as a disorder of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures. This definition is usually practically applied as having two unprovoked seizures >24 h apart. The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) accepted recommendations of a task force altering the practical definition for special circumstances that do not meet the two unprovoked seizures criteria. The task force proposed that epilepsy be considered to be a disease of the brain defined by any of the following conditions: (1) At least two unprovoked (or reflex) seizures occurring >24 h apart; (2) one unprovoked (or reflex) seizure and a probability of further seizures similar to the general recurrence risk (at least 60%) after two unprovoked seizures, occurring over the next 10 years; (3) diagnosis of an epilepsy syndrome. Epilepsy is considered to be resolved for individuals who either had an age-dependent epilepsy syndrome but are now past the applicable age or who have remained seizure-free for the last 10 years and off antiseizure medicines for at least the last 5 years. \"Resolved\" is not necessarily identical to the conventional view of \"remission or \"cure.\" Different practical definitions may be formed and used for various specific purposes. This revised definition of epilepsy brings the term in concordance with common use.

The conventional electroencephalogram is plagued with artifacts from movements, muscles, and other sources. Tripolar concentric ring electrodes automatically attenuate muscle artifacts and provide improved signal quality. We performed basic experiments in healthy humans to show that tripolar concentric ring electrodes can indeed record the physiological alpha waves while eyes are closed. We then conducted concurrent recordings with conventional disc electrodes and tripolar concentric ring electrodes from patients with epilepsy. We found that we could detect high frequency oscillations, a marker for early seizure development and epileptogenic zone, on the scalp surface that appeared to become more narrow-band just prior to seizures. High frequency oscillations preceding seizures were present in an average of 35.5% of tripolar concentric ring electrode data channels for all the patients with epilepsy whose seizures were recorded and absent in the corresponding conventional disc electrode data. An average of 78.2% of channels that contained high frequency oscillations were within the seizure onset or irritative zones determined independently by three epileptologists based on conventional disc electrode data and videos.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1109/JTEHM.2014.2332994\n\nView details for PubMedID 27170874\n\nAbstract\n\nThe International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) defined a seizure as \"a transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms due to abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain.\" This definition has been used since the era of Hughlings Jackson, and does not take into account subsequent advances made in epilepsy and neuroscience research. The clinical diagnosis of a seizure is empirical, based upon constellations of certain signs and symptoms, while simultaneously ruling out a list of potential imitators of seizures. Seizures should be delimited in time, but the borders of ictal (during a seizure), interictal (between seizures) and postictal (after a seizure) often are indistinct. EEG recording is potentially very helpful for confirmation, classification and localization. About a half-dozen common EEG patterns are encountered during seizures. Clinicians rely on researchers to answer such questions as why seizures start, spread and stop, whether seizures involve increased synchrony, the extent to which extra-cortical structures are involved, and how to identify the seizure network and at what points interventions are likely to be helpful. Basic scientists have different challenges in use of the word 'seizure,' such as distinguishing seizures from normal behavior, which would seem easy but can be very difficult because some rodents have EEG activity during normal behavior that resembles spike-wave discharge or bursts of rhythmic spiking. It is also important to define when a seizure begins and stops so that seizures can be quantified accurately for pre-clinical studies. When asking what causes seizures, the transition to a seizure and differentiating the pre-ictal, ictal and post-ictal state is also important because what occurs before a seizure could be causal and may warrant further investigation for that reason. These and other issues are discussed by three epilepsy researchers with clinical and basic science expertise.\n\nView details for PubMedID 25012363\n\nAbstract\n\nDeep brain stimulation for seizures has been applied to cerebellum, caudate, locus coeruleus, subthalamic nucleus, mammillary bodies, centromedian thalamus, anterior nucleus of thalamus, hippocampus and amygdala, hippocampal commissure, corpus callosum, neocortex, and occasionally to other sites. Animal and clinical studies have primarily investigated seizure prevention and, to a lessersmaller extent, seizure interruption. No studies have yet shown stimulation able to cure epilepsy. A wide variety of stimulation parameters have been employed in multiple different combinations of frequencies, amplitudes, and durations. Literature review identifies at least 52 clinical studies of brain stimulation for epilepsy in 817 patients. Two studies were large, randomized, and controlled, one in the anterior nucleus of thalamus and another at the cortical or hippocampal seizure focus; both of these studies showed efficacy and tolerability of stimulation. Many questions remain. We do not know the mechanisms, the best stimulation parameters, the best patient population, or how to predict benefit in advance. We do not know why benefit of neurostimulation for epilepsy seems to increase over time or whether there are long-term deleterious effects. All of these questions may be answerable with a combination of laboratory research and clinical experience.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/B978-0-444-53497-2.00017-6\n\nView details for PubMedID 24112896\n\nAbstract\n\nAn NINDS-sponsored conference in April of 2011 reviewed issues in epilepsy clinical trials. One goal was to clarify new electronic methods for recording seizure information and other data in clinical trials.This selective literature review and compilation of expert opinion considers advantages and limitations of traditional paper-based seizure diaries in comparison to electronic diaries.Seizure diaries are a type of patient-reported outcome. All seizure diaries depend first on accurate recognition and recording of seizures, which is a problem since about half of seizures recorded during video-EEG monitoring are not known to the patient. Reliability of recording is another key issue. Diaries may not be at hand after a seizure, lost or not brought to clinic visits. On-line electronic diaries have several potential advantages over paper diaries. Smartphones are increasingly accessible as data entry gateways. Data are not easily lost and are accessible from clinic. Entries can be time-stamped and provide immediate feedback, validation or reminders. Data can also can be graphed and pasted into an EMR. Disadvantages include need for digital sophistication, higher cost, increased setup time, and requiring attention to potential privacy issues. The Epilepsy Diary by epilepsy.com and Irody, Inc. has over 13,000 registrants and SeizureTracker over 10,000, and both are used for clinical and research purposes. Some studies have documented patient preference and increased compliance for electronic versus paper diaries. Seizure diaries can be challenging in the pediatric population. Children often have multiple seizure types and limited reporting of subjective symptoms. Multiple caregivers during the day require more training to produce reliable and consistent data. Diary-based observational studies have the advantages of low cost, allowing locus-of-control by the patient and testing in a \"real-world\" environment. Diary-based studies can also be useful as descriptive \"snapshots\" of a population. However, the type of information available is very different from that obtained by prospective controlled studies. The act of self-recording observations may itself influence the observation, for example, by causing the subject to attend more vigilantly to seizures after changing medication. Pivotal anti-seizure drug or device trials still mostly rely on paper-based seizure diaries. Industry is aware of the potential advantages of electronic diaries, particularly, the promise of real-time transmission of data, time-stamping of entries, reminders to subjects, and potentially automatic interfaces to other devices. However, until diaries are validated as research tools and the regulatory environment becomes clearer, adoption of new types of diaries as markers for a primary study outcome will be cautious.Recommendations from the conference included: further studies of validity of epilepsy diaries and how they can be used to improve adherence; use and further development of core data sets, such as the one recently developed by NINDS; encouraging links of diaries to electronic sensors; development of diary privacy and legal policies; examination of special pediatric diary issues; development of principles for observational research from diaries; and work with the FDA to make electronic diaries more useful in industry-sponsored clinical trials.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.yebeh.2012.04.128\n\nView details for PubMedID 22652423\n\nAbstract\n\nDespite reported success, surgery for pharmacoresistant seizures is often seen as a last resort. Patients are typically referred for surgery after 20 years of seizures, often too late to avoid significant disability and premature death.We sought to determine whether surgery soon after failure of 2 antiepileptic drug (AED) trials is superior to continued medical management in controlling seizures and improving quality of life (QOL).The Early Randomized Surgical Epilepsy Trial (ERSET) is a multicenter, controlled, parallel-group clinical trial performed at 16 US epilepsy surgery centers. The 38 participants (18 men and 20 women; aged â¥12 years) had mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) and disabling seizues for no more than 2 consecutive years following adequate trials of 2 brand-name AEDs. Eligibility for anteromesial temporal resection (AMTR) was based on a standardized presurgical evaluation protocol.
