        "text": "Editorial Review\n\nProduct Description\n\nWilliam Woodward was an extraordinarily influential force in Southern Impressionism, the New Orleans Arts And Crafts Movement, the Newcomb Art School, and the French Quarter Preservation Movement. His paintings also encompass scenes of his travels across America and the Mississippi Gulf Coast, where he retired after a career of teaching at Tulane University and Newcomb College.THIS IS A BEAUTIFULLY HARD BOUND 208 PAGE EXQUISITE COFFEE TABLE BOOK THAT CONTAINS 166 FULL COLOR PLATES of Woodward's art and presents, for the first time, a compendium showing the diversity of his work, and the different methods, style and genres he used.Woodward's paintings capture the romantic essence of New Orleans around the turn of the 20th century and a Mississippi Gulf Coast before the ravages of hurricanes.The articles in the book are written by George Schmidt (a prominent New Orleans artist), Judith Bonner (the Senior Curator, The Historic New Orleans Collection), Richard Gruber (the Director of The Ogden Museum of Southern Art), Jessie Poesch (retired Professor of Art, Tulane University) and Ray Bellande (a prominent Biloxi historian), all experts in their respective areas. ... Read more\n\nCustomer Reviews (1)\n\nArt in the South\n\nThis is a truly lavish art book!For all who love American Impressionism and New Orleans, this book is a visual delight.In addition to the handsome reproductions, five leading art historians present engaging essays on the life and times of William Woodward, artist, architect, and art educator. The topics cover his early training in the American Arts and Crafts movement on the East Coast, his tenure as professor of architecture and fine art at Tulane University and Newcomb College Art School, his role as preservationist of the old French Quarter, and ends with his retirement in the lively art community of Biloxi, Mississippi. His paintings of the Vieux Carre (French Quarter) are perhaps the most famous of his subjects and provide a glimpse into New Orleans at the turn of nineteenth century. Woodward used the novel medium of oil crayon, instead of traditional oil, for these paintings, which allowed for quick, spontaneous, \"on the spot\" drawings of the old buildings.This impressionist technique did much to change the style of art in the South, leading the way to a late blooming of the popular Movement which had already taken Europe and the East Coast by storm.Woodward documents a vanishing culture and style of architecture in New Orleans which today remains unique among American cities.Woodward's beautiful paintings remind us that their message of preservation is more timely now than ever following the series of man-made disasters on the Gulf coast! ...

From Watergate to Nixon, from the Supreme Court to the controversial death of comic John Belushi, Bob Woodward is on the leading edge of the events in our nation that make news, make history and make bestsellers! HC: Simon & Schuster. (Nonfiction) ... Read more\n\nCustomer Reviews (13)\n\nIt is like we were in the meetings......\n\nThis is another of Bob Woodward's insider stories on the White House, the Presidency of the United States and the surrounding players, in this case the CIA and it's Director William Casey.\n\nWoodward chose one of the most turbulent times in US political history to write about and he wrote extremely well, it is almost as if the reader is in the room while these events took place. The ability of Woodward to draw out the biggest secrets and stories from some of the most powerful people in the world is something to be seen to be believed.\n\nExcellent book.\n\nIvy Balls...The Depths of Real-Life Espionage\n\n...Okay, so it's Operation \"Ivy Bells\"...I just wanted to relay an abbreviated connotation into the title, in a nutshell.\n\nSpecifically covering past espionage operations, this book relates excellent past internal working and policy decision making between various intelligence agencies, political players and other intelligence sources, not just the CIA. It covers specific, proven events...in great detail.\n\nYou can get an in-depth idea of how \"shadow systems\" work around, and with, existing civilian and government markets, as well as DC politics that are often involved in big business and major political entities world-wide.\n\nI find it a very informative book, especially with its \"hindsight\" into deeper inner workings of not just what policy IS, but HOW policy is CARRIED OUT in the real world, and the not so visible world.\n\nAn eye opener...well written, as to simultaneously inform and entertain.\n\nA whole lot of S**T going down!\n\nThis book delves into the various covert operations sponsored by the CIA during the Reagan administration.The primary focus is on combating communist parties in Central America and dealing with Middle East dictators and terrorism.The story is told chronologically and allocates about the same number of chapters to each year stated in the book's title.Woodward writes the book like a TV crime drama; with some conversations taking up whole paragraphs and some weeks covered in a sentence.The book contains many references, but all are in the back, with no correlation between specific facts and their sources.Woodward takes a fairly objective view of events, and there are many instances where central characters like CIA DCI Casey, Reagan, and various cabinet members can comment on their words and actions.The book gives a lot of facts such as dates, names of operations, names of characters, and other details that make this a good reference, along with a good piece of investigative journalism.All in all, a good book.\n\nExpectations Met\n\nWoodward does a good job ofgiving you a fly's eye view of the old CIA\n\nThe Clique That Couldn't Spy Straight\n\nWhen Woodward wrote this book in 1987, it was his first truly up-to-the-minute muckraking exercise since \"All the President's Men\" and \"The Final Days\" with Carl Bernstein back during the Watergate years. \"Veil\" covers the activities of the U.S. intelligence apparatus in the 1980s, leading up to the Iran-Contra scandal that was just breaking as Woodward finished up the book. At the time, Woodward was probably trying to unleash an in-depth investigation on a breaking story for the benefit of concerned and skeptical Americans, like he did most recently with his three books on Bush and the Iraq war. This may have been a crucial investigation at the time, but now it largely reflects esoteric historical details.\n\nThe book mostly follows William Casey, Reagan's intelligence chief from 1981 to 1987, in the form of a 500-page investigative report of Casey's decision-making processes, the unqualified cronyism of the intelligence establishment, and all the political causes and effects. The historical details are fairly interesting for intelligence buffs but are now a rather unexciting read, especially since Woodward's strictly chronological investigative style creates very little suspense. You get the feeling that the historical coverage is always leading up to something that never quite comes as the book slogs along, except maybe the Iran-Contra hearings, but those started just as Woodward's chronology comes to a close (he concluded with Casey's untimely death).\n\nBut on the good side, if one takes a longer historical view there are some interesting lessons to be learned here. Woodward finds that the American intelligence apparatus (especially the CIA) has always been devoted not to the security of the American homeland, but to pushing ideology into other nations and building short-term alliances for quick political gain, no matter which political party is in charge back home. During the Casey/Reagan years, the agency was stacked with political cronies whose black-and-white ideological obsessions resulted in a parade of questionable actions leading to the shameful (and possibly treasonous) Iran-Contra scandal. At a higher level, through this example Woodward really brought some crucial focus to what American intelligence really stands for. But in terms of the specific events of this book, Woodward would have created a more lasting historical study if he had waited until after the Iran-Contra hearings had run their course.

A professor of English before turning to photography, Adams is also a skilled writer and acute thinker on aesthetic questions. Apertureís previous bestselling collections of his essays, Beauty in Photography and Why People Photograph, assembled his thoughts on a range of subjects, including writing, teaching, photographyís place in the arts and a host of fellow photographers. Along Some Rivers collects Adams's correspondence and conversations--some of which have never been published before--with writers and curators including William McEwan, Constance Sullivan and Thomas Weski. In so doing, it provides another point of entry, offering a portrait of the artist in debate and elucidating his thoughts on a number of his now legendary projects, including Cottonwoods and What We Bought. Adams also expounds on why, in his view, Marcel Duchamp has not been a helpful guide for art, and he discusses which filmmakers and painters have influenced him, which cameras he prefers and how he approaches printing his pictures. Along Some Rivers also includes a selection of 28 unpublished landscapes. ... Read more\n\nCustomer Reviews (3)\n\nSnippets of silence\n\nLet me begin this review with a disclaimer, I am passionate about Robert Adams' photography and his writings and have been for over 15 years.\n\nThis book is in my opinion a useful primer for those interested in the ideas surrounding Mr Adams' work. A handy reference to other art and artists who Mr Adams feels are accomplished and successful in their approach to art. He also alludes to the meaning and function of art, a refreshing attitude in this post modern world of \"anything goes\".\n\nHowever if you are looking for some intellectual meat or long indepth discourses on the meaning of art this book is not for you.\n\nCurrently this book is nestled in my bag and travels everywhere with me, shortly it will be as dog eared as his other tomes, Beauty in Photography: Essays in Defence of Traditional Values and Why People Photograph\n\nA delightful book of conversations\n\nRobert Adams is one of the most thoughtful people practicing photography today, and this book, though slim, is filled with conversations about the medium.Since purchasing the book about three months ago, I have read the book from cover to cover at least five times, and I suppose I will likely read it many times more.His words are full of love for photography and those who practice it, and for the landscape, and those who live there.\n\nAnd the photographs--how does he find such simple scenes so full of memories of places I've never been?Full of light and leaves and water, quiet, powerful places...\n\nThe stars are for the photos only\n\nRobert Adams' essays in \"Beauty in Photography\" and \"Why People Photograph\" were interesting and insightful.The interview text in this small book of photographs shows him to be an academic, lacking an understanding of human motivation and necessary practicalities.Would that the world was so simple.It's not and the foundation for Adams' wonderful photography is shown to be seriously flawed.\n\nHe describes himself in this book as being a socialist of sorts but then admits to having anger directed toward the \"lower classes\" because this \"lower class\" accepts \"mass produced junk\" without criticism.He also comes off as a sort of wimp.He may not return to photograph in California because of the \"danger\" he sensed in the areas he photographed.Apparently he feels that the presence of junk and the distant sounds of dirt bikes and \"assault rifles\" frightened him.I wasn't aware an \"assault rifle\" made its own unique sound.I wasn't aware that junk and dirt bikes were threatening.He also sensed \"hostility\" in many of the neighborhoods he saw because there was razor wire and aggressive breeds of dogs present.He later admits he has never been attacked while photographing but he has had to endure other people's anger.This poor guy must have either a superb sense of impending danger or he lives a sheltered, terrified life.\n\nHe answers many of the questions with quotes from famous people, whose words he has committed to memory.They are mostly profound statements.Unfortunately, when Adams speaks for himself, he comes across as lacking.He probably should get out among the \"lower classes\" more often and experience their hopes, aspirations and motivations instead of locking himself into a fantasy world of denial.\n\nThe photographs, however, are poetic and the only reason to buy this slim volume. ...
