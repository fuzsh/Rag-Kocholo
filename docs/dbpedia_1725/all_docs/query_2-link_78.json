        "meta_description": "The plate reduction method and other aspects of the world geodetic net are described. About one hundred stars are used as reference stars on the PAGEOS satellite plates obtained on 300mm f.1. and later 450mm f.1. Wild BC-4 cameras. The measurements are made manually now on diapositives since these can, according to experience, be measured with higher accuracy and are adjusted following a rigorous projective geometric model. The satellite images are analytically represented by a polynomial curve, of which seven fictitious points are regarded as the result from this plate. Some other aspects of the program are also discussed.",
