US National Geodetic Survey

The National Geodetic Survey (NGS), formerly the United States Survey of the Coast (1807-1836), United States Coast Survey (1836-1878), and United States Coast and Geodetic Survey (USC&GS) (1878-1970), is a United States federal agency that defines and manages a national coordinate system, providing the foundation for transportation and communication; mapping and charting; and a large number of applications of science and engineering. Since its foundation in its present form in 1970, it has been part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), of the United States Department of Commerce.

I have an old postage stamp celebrating the US Coast and Geodetic Survey's 150th anniversary, 1807-1957. It shows a dark flag with a white circle in the center which contains a triangle. It's all black and white (actually blue and white), so I can't tell the exact colors, but the triangle is lighter than the field.

The stamp may not be precisely accurate. Old USN flag books show the points of the triangle touching the circumference of the circle.

It was the same as the flag of the modern National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, minus the central circle with the seagull. In other words, dark blue field, white circle, red triangle. The red triangle was emblematic of the triangulation methods used in surveying.
