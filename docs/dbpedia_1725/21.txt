THE report of the Coast and Geodetic Survey for 1904 is a record of manifold labours and results which have for their theatre of action an area practically coterminous with that of the United States and all its island possessions. The main body of the report contains a detailed account of the wide range of duties devolving upon this bureau, and in the appendices we have a presentation of discussions and results which must prove of great economic value and interest to surveyors, engineers, navigators, and physicists.
