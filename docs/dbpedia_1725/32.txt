The United States Coast and Geodetic Survey is the predecessor to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Originating in 1807 as the United States Survey of the Coast, their job was to manage a national coordinate system, map and chart the coasts, and provide the foundation for transportation and communication. During times of war, their survey work was suspended with many of their officers transferred to the other military services to fulfill similar duties such as surveyors, navigators, hydrographers, engineers, beachmasters, intelligence officers, and instructors. The survey personnel saw service during the Civil War, World War I, and World War II.

In July 1945, President Harry Truman signed Executive Order 9590 authorizing the Secretary of Commerce to provide and issue six awards for personnel serving with the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey to recognize their service during World War II.
