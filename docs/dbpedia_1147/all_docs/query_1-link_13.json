        "text": "Taking its place among the traditional Japanese developer/publishers who sowed their wild gaming seeds back in the NES days, Tecmo (along with Sega's Shinobi and Konami's Contra: Shattered Soldier) has re-emerged with its old Greco-Roman hero, Rygar, in the new PlayStation 2 game, Rygar: The Legendary Journey.\n\nRygar: The Legendary Journey is set on an island in the Mediterranean Sea called Argus, and spins the mythological story of a noble warrior who is determined to save a princess -- yes, the classic, perhaps over-used, but nonetheless traditional videogame story. Here, Rygar must save Princess Harmonia while restoring a state of peace to the Island of Argus.\n\nRygar is a warrior celebrated for my many victories in battle. For his bravery during The Great Sea Battle -- which ultimately brought the Island of Argus to victory -- Princess Harmonia decided to honor Rygar in a magnificent ceremony. But during the celebration, giant, brutal monsters known as \"Titans\" appeared from nowhere, pillaging, ransacking, and destroying Rygar's homeland. That, and they abducted Princess Harmonia.\n\nThe attack of the Titans created massive destruction to the land's surface, but it also created giant cracks and rifts in the surface, forming a hidden and mysterious underworld into which Rygar fell. Swallowed into the deep underworld, Rygar realizes that his objectives have multiplied. He's pissed off that his celebration was ruined, his beloved princess was abducted, and now he must find his way out! In a stroke of luck, a goddess approaches Rygar, informing him what he must do. In order to destroy the Titans, save the Princess, and get back to the earth's surface, he must use his unique weapon, known as \"diskarmor,\" to fight his way out.\n\nThe diskarmor is Rygar's main weapon, used for both attack and defense, but it's also a divine, spiritual artifact. The discarmor is lilke a yoyo, and extends deadly spikes that slice through enemies on land or in the air, and it can be swung to slam on the floor to shock enemies as well. It also can be used as a catapult Rygar from one location to the next as well as to destroy various interactive environments. Rygar has more than 30 moves in all.\n\nRygar: The Legendary Journey is due later this fall on PS2, and is a single-player game. We'll have more on Rygar soon."
