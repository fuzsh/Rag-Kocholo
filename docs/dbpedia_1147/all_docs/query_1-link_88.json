        "text": "Study 15: Rygar/Argus no Senshi (NES/Famicom, Arcade)\n\nArgus no Senshi was one of Tecmo’s earliest games, seeing release in 1986. The company had just recently changed its name from Tehkan. The origins of Tehkan were pretty far from gaming, as they supplied cleaning equipment to Japanese businesses in 1967. Two years later, the company switched gears and got into amusement equipment, which was a bigger success. Their first video game was 1981’s Pleiads.\n\nArgus no Senshi was a fairly straightforward action arcade title, starring hero Senshi (aka “warrior” in Japanese, according to Video Game Den). His claim to fame was slinging around a rather cool weapon, the Diskarmor, which is a boomerang-esque shield. With this mighty weapon, Senshi must defeat the evil Raiga and save the kingdom of Arigoru from his tyranny. I have the flyers for the arcade original at the end of the post, mainly because the Japanese one is quite violent. In localization the hero became Rygar, the villain Ligar, and little else changed from what I can tell.\n\nIn 1987 Argus no Senshi was ported to the Famicom. The game saw a significant alteration in style and design during this process. The arcade style of gameplay was tossed aside for a more Metroid-like structure (the comparison isn’t as derivative as you may think, since Metroid came out around the same time). Senshi still wields the Diskarmor, but he can pad its abilities with further tools that boost his defense and mobility options. It’s a fairly solid game, although it’s been way too long since I played it.\n\nWhen Tecmo brought it to the U.S., very little seemingly changed! Let’s start with the most drastic change, which, naturally, is the box art:\n\nThe Famicom box is rather adorable, despite Raiga’s malice. Senshi is chibi-ifed, and the enemies are fairly cute, too. It also utilizes the most memorable part of Rygar to me, the striking sunset backdrop. Rather nice work.\n\nAmerica — as usual — can’t handle the anime (particularly chibi anime!) in the 1980s, so Tecmo commissioned this box for Americans to experience Rygar. Borrowing heavily from comics and popular cartoons at the time (He-Man in particular), this is a far cry from the more childish design cues of the Japanese box.\n\nSome screen comparisons, with Japan on the top and America on the bottom:\n\nVery little changed here. The logo for Argus no Sensei looks nicer. I like the Diskarmor behind it quite a bit. A two year gap between releases is the other thing I notice.\n\nBeyond some color differences and changes to the text, Sensei/Rygar and the Guru here look unaltered.\n\nSurprisingly, the biggest change to Rygar was that some of its music was redone for the American release! Compare the two:\n\nArgus no Sensei was only minimally transformed on its overseas travels to become Rygar, with the box art and the music were the key alterations. So while Sensei’s original chibi look was lost for a more He-Man style of fighter, at least the visual look of Argus no Senshi’s gameplay was left alone in the conversion.\n\nSources:\n\nHG101 Article on Rygar: http://hardcoregaming101.net/rygar/rygar.htm\n\nBox Vs.

The Japanese arcade flyer art has some graphic violence, so if you’re not big on the decapitation of monsters, don’t march on!\n\nThis…is quite a shift from the Famicom box. This Sensei is more in line with the “badass” American Rygar! Pretty similar designs, there. Also, there’s nothing quite like gratuitous beast beheading in ye olde arcade days. XD Raiga is freaking scary here, too. On the whole, this is pretty good stuff from the arcade scene of the ’80’s.\n\nThe American flyer has a fairly standard comic book style to it, and it works pretty well! Rygar looks a bit dorky (and his Diskarmor looks like a sawblade :p ), but it’s colorful, the enemies are neat, and the background isn’t bad. Again, I’ve seen plenty of promotional material more atrocious than this. At least it was done by a competent artist!"
