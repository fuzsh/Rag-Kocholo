        "text": "One of those games I played a lot back when the NES was the cool system. Featuring a warrior and based on an arcade game of the same name, this one would be revamped into its on deity on the NES. Good thing too, the arcade game is insanely difficult and nowhere near as fun as this version is that has flaws, but overall is still a fun game. It is on the short side, but good thing as there is no password or save system so if you give this one a go, you're going to have to win it in one sitting or leave you NES on all night like I did one time playing it. Of course, my most recent play through was on an emulator so I was able to use a save state.\n\nThe story, the land of Argool is under siege from evil! Evil in the form of a statue with wavy snake arms residing in a floating castle. As Rygar, you must traverse the land in order to collect the necessary tools to make your way to the castle to fight Ligar! Or, statue with wavy snake arms. You will be assisted by muscular bald dudes who give you righteous clues and by dudes with bigger foreheads who will give you the items you need to succeed!\n\nThe game play can almost be described as Metroidvania as you must get certain items to keep progressing through the games; however, this game does not have the depth of a Zelda or Metroid game as it is on the short side. It does have more depth though than many other games and it is nice they changed it up from the arcade version. You use the disc armor as your weapon, a shield with spikes that spins and kills! You have to battle bosses which are absent in the arcade game to collect items like grappling hooks to continue on your quest and the more monsters you kill, the more life you are rewarded. You also get to go through side scrolling levels and overhead ones so you have a bit of variety and the music is rather good too.\n\nSo, this game is fun and I enjoyed it even today though I was surprised by how quickly I got through it. I guess things just seem lengthier when one is a kid. Also, over the years I have played many role playing games so leveling up felt like it took no time, but when I was a kid it felt like forever!"
