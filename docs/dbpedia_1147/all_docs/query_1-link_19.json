Set in an ancient European world the environs and adversaries are inspired by Greek and Roman mythology creating an unusual setting for an action extravaganza. Plus the scenery can often be altered with a whack from Rygar's retractable chain and ball to open up new potential routes. Reminiscent of the seminal Jason and the Argonauts in parts, Rygar delivers superb action gameplay topped up with a couple of light cerebral challenges.\n\nSecond hand. A slight disk scratch. Manual cover impressions.\n\nPublisher: Tecmo\n\nGame Type: Action\n\nConsole: PS2\n\nJapanese release - may only work with Japanese hardware. Â£12.99 - BACKORDER"
