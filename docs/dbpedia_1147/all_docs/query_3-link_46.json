        "text": "Tecmo’s arcade hit Rygar to be released as part of Hamster’s Arcade Archives series\n\nTokyo-based publisher Hamster Corporation today announced that Tecmo’s 1986 arcade classic Rygar will be making its way to the Nintendo Switch eShop tomorrow, September 13, as part of the company’s Arcade Archives lineup.\n\nOriginally released in Japan as “Warrior of Argus,” Rygar is a side-scrolling platformer that puts players in control of the “Legendary Hero” as he battles the forces of evil with his shield/whip hybrid Diskarmor. If you’re as old as I am, you probably remember the NES port pretty well. And if you’re not quite as ancient as the rest of us, you may recall 2002’s PlayStation 2 sequel Rygar: The Legendary Adventure.\n\nIt’s worth noting that the arcade original isn’t quite as polished as its NES cousin. Still, it’s a fun little throwback to the arcade’s golden era, and probably worth the $7.99 asking price.\n\nThink you’ll be adding this throwback to your Switch library tomorrow? Which other relics from the 80s would you like to see Hamster bring to Nintendo’s console? Sound off in the comments and let us know."
