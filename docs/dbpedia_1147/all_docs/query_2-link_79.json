It is based on the original Rygar released for arcade machines and various computers and consoles. The new features are a transition to 3D graphics and portions of the environment are destructible. The game is inspired by Greek and Roman mythology and has many enemies and worlds named after them.\n\nRygar: The Legendary Adventure takes place on an island in the Mediterranean Sea called Argus. Rygar is about to receive a wreath from Princess Harmonia in a ceremony for a victorious naval battle, when Titans suddenly attack led by Echidna. After she and Icarus capture Harmonia, Echidna has the Minotaur dispose of Rygar with a pit torn open in the ground. Surviving the encounter, Rygar finds the Diskarmor, a legendary shield of the gods and is given task to stop the Titans in order to rescue Harmonia and bring peace to Argus.\n\nThe game was ported to the Wii in 2008, as Rygar: The Battle of Argus, released in Japan as Argus no Senshi: Muscle Impact (アルゴスの戦士 マッスルインパクト).\n\nSee its official American website here (archived) and its Japanese one here.\n\nTropes used in Rygar: The Legendary Adventure include:"
