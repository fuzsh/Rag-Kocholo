        "text": "@Balosi I suspect for the most part it really involves security standards for payment methods and the like. Obviously if they're keeping the network up and the ability to download old games and play them ,the actual cost of the network exists either way, so the only difference is the payment system going down. As card payment compliance rules change the software, and the security standards for the networks and transactions change, and that means updating both the servers, AND issuing updates for the client hardware (PS3/X360/Wii firmware) to update the security for the transactions.\n\nBy shutting down the store, and thus payments, they don't have to update the security standards on both the old console, and the servers for payment system updates, or changing to a new payment provider when their contracts change.\n\nIn Wii's case, online shut down completely because it was provided by a third party, Gamespy, which went down itself.\n\nWiiU and 3DS IDK, I assume sales were mostly all physical and digital store use was exceptionally low, and also that Nintendo being Nintendo wanted to force everyone to buy re-releases at full price on new hardware and force their software into the \"vault\" for a full price re-release in 20 years from now rather than \"devalue\" their games by selling old games cheaper. But in actuality they probably also had a 3rd party running that and the contract ended. Nintendo seems to do scarcely little in house, everything is a patchwork of 3rd party providers.\n\nIn X360's case it's less of a big deal because the majority of games aren't actually getting delisted, they're still listed for sale on backward compatibility on the current store for current hardware. Not all, but most of the in demand games that weren't already delisted for licensing years ago, so you can still buy a lot of them, just on the newer store for newer hardware. The shutdown isn't nearly as impactful as PS3 and Nintendo consoles where a lot of the games just vanish forever.\n\nThe thing I question the most isn't the servers, licenses for games (besides those delisted already, even though I bought WRC 4 on VIta when its' clearly outdated, probably are MotoGP games as well or any others with music or even if none of that licensing just the trademark or other factors anymore) as well that's valid by the companies, but the customers. That & store is slow yes.\n\nIf most care about major games, have or haven't bought up the PS1/2/PSP or even PSP Minis, or Indies, why would people care? They don't want ALL games so why complain? I get those that do still actively use these platforms, myself included but I mean ask any Wii U owner if they played the many PSP Minis ported to it? You'll get probably no body to maybe rare ones like myself that did buy them. Sure people talk up Affordable Space Adventures, but who does Rush rather than Toki Tori? Or Edge the expanded mobile version on Wii U then the PSP Minis release. Exactly.\n\nI'm buying up many 6-7th gen shooters physical, I haven't checked PS3 as my wifi chip sucks for the controllers and the console. I have another PS3 but no interest in accessing the PS3 store, but do the Vita store on occasion. PS3/360/Wii were the last of experimental titles by some companies & direction, less IPs then we see today. Even for shooters alone, 1-3 entries then ended, some back compat on Xbox, some not. I'm buying them for curiosity/mechanic interest, same with platformers, racing, puzzle, hack n slashes, etc.\n\nValkyrie Store Plugin was a sign, that's been blocked but maybe still accessible to Sony it's just they don't want players to which is a bit dodgey if for PS+ or others/how inferior looking can be or to make us move on to the next platform. Like Nintendo did prices or delisting of Wii U games when Switch versions came out for Skyward Sword/Pikmin 3. Dodgey.\n\nI get money and people aging or responsibilities, other titles as a priority or whatever the case a customer can't do anything about, it happens with life getting in the way or other titles or other factors and not able to afford them all.\n\nBut I mean what percentage of people cared like collectors did for Captain U or Umbra on Wii U? In the 360's case I didn't hear about some games till this year. So I totally get games we never heard of/then came across later, before/after store closure.\n\nNo one really has heard of those end of eshop period release games or cares & that furthers my point. XD It's why I bought Captain U. Umbra I couldn't as was USA eshop only but still a horror game that was in the news for balance board support but had to cut it, sigh, like Wii Vitality sensor being cancelled possiblities.\n\n360 same thing, most bought up the digital versions of big games, DLC/themes & more sure I totally get, but games wise unless it's the VC/XBLA games most people don't care.\n\nGetting them while we can is one thing, caring at all about them is another & narrow view of interest in titles unless a collector/nostalgic/hearing about something & getting it then oops store is down it's unfortunate but did have time, \"to a degree\" to get them over other titles, with/without discounts as annoying as that is & glad Capcom did for 3DS/Microsoft for 360, will Sony who knows?"
