        "text": "This is the time for bringing games back from retirement. Sega came out with new a new \"Shinobi.\" Konami has a new \"Contra.\" And Tecmo has brought back two great blasts from the past: \"Ninja Gaiden\" and \"Rygar.\"\n\nScheduled for release some time in 2003, \"Ninja Gaiden\" is a highly anticipated game. The new \"Rygar\" game, for Sony's PlayStation2 game console, has not received as warm a reception, but the name still carries some weight.\n\n\"Rygar\" first appeared as an arcade game in 1986. It was a side-scrolling game in which an old-style European hero ran through a countryside filled with pillars and temples, killing monsters with diskarmor -- a shield on a string that he flung forward and back like a whip or a yo-yo."
