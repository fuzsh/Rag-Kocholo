        "text": "4. A little gratuitous violence\n\nThe game isn’t a bloodbath, but it sure was cool to see enemies decapitated by our weapons. Won’t see too many heads separated from bodies in Carnival Games or Imagine Babies. On top of that, some of the enemies are just plain creepy, like the haunted suits of knight’s armor that rise lifelessly every time you knock them down, wailing hauntingly all the time. Little touches like those make the combo-heavy combat even better.\n\n5. Cooking-game fans can throw food\n\nIf you actually enjoy culinary escapades on the Wii, Rygar has something for that too. As you progress farther in the game, you can unlock special Diskarmors, including ones shaped like a pizza and a hamburger. Those might just be cute re-skins of the weapons, but we bet they’re more fun than the Hell’s Kitchen game.\n\n6. The game deserves another chance\n\nPerhaps you’re asking yourself, \"Whydo I care?This is just another PS2 port to the Wii.” And you’re correct, a version of this game subtitled The Legendary Adventure, was released on the PS2 in 2002. But in the six years since then, new enemies have been added - some of which can even block - and there’s been a graphics overhaul to the game in general, and to Rygar himself in particular. We're even betting you definitely missed the PS2 version the first time, considering it released within weeks of Grand Theft Auto: Vice City and Ratchet & Clank.\n\n7. Have you seen what's coming out this winter for the Wii?\n\nIf you’ve been reading closely, then you know the Wii has a crappy holiday ahead of itself, at least where the quality of its third-party titles is concerned. Sure, Game Party 2 will appeal to your mom, and there will be much-diminished ports of multiplatform releases like Call of Duty and Guitar Hero. But seriously, if this game turns out to be as good as it seems, Rygar: Battle of Argus won’t have much competition for your Wii dollars this year.\n\nOct 2, 2008"
