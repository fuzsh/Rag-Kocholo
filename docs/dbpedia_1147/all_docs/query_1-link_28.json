For the Nintendo Wii game, see Rygar: The Battle of Argus.\n\nRygar[lower-alpha 2] is a 1986 side-scrolling platform game created by Tecmo. Originally released for Japanese arcades in June 1986, the game was subsequently ported to the NES (1987), Commodore 64 (1987), ZX Spectrum (1987), Amstrad CPC (1987), Master System (1988), Atari Lynx (1990), and X68000 (1994).

A remake, Rygar: The Legendary Adventure, was released for PlayStation 2 in 2002. The Legendary Adventure was remastered for the Wii in 2008 as Rygar: The Battle of Argus.\n\nThe original arcade game has very little story, with the player assuming the role of a \"Legendary Warrior\" who must fight through a series of increasingly hostile landscapes so as to defeat Ligar, an evil \"dominator\". Later ports, particularly the NES and Lynx versions, expanded on the storyline, with the NES version depicting Rygar as a warrior returned from the dead to fulfil an ancient prophecy. In all versions of the game, the main mechanic is the use of a weapon called the \"Diskarmor\", a razor-sharp shield with a long chain attached to it that operates like a yo-yo."
