This page is a compilation of lore and story content for this character.

Backstory[]

Character Introduction[]

No one knows Emil's past. When they looked at him, most people just saw a poor tramp living in the street. A high fever robbed him of most of his memories, and when he regained consciousness, he found himself in an insane asylum. Emil endured much suffering there, but he remained obedient. Through injections, restraints, and electric shock therapy... he was always the most silent among all the asylum's patients.

In the asylum, the amnesiac Emil appeared more taciturn and calm than others. He then met Ada, who entered the asylum to practice medicine. She soon decided to take him away, gradually helping him recover some of his normal emotional reactions and actions. But he would still often recall his days in the asylum—those vague memories of being imprisoned, bound, and unable to move. Dust flew through the stifling air, and countless faces cheered wildly all around him. Since then, whenever he was strapped to a chair or hospital bed, he became anxious and instinctively panicked.

Emil could not remember his identity, but he knew that Ada was different from others, different for him. Ada treated him as a personal possession, to be taken with her as she pleased. Though somewhat twisted, their feelings are sincere. Ada doesn't care about Emil's forgotten past, and Emil also accepts Ada's 'treatment.' After all, for Emil, Ada's treatment feels more like love and care than the pain he received in those fragmented memories.[4]

Chinese Character Introduction[]

After successfully escaping from the asylum, Emil became Ada's "accessory". Compared to those fragmented painful memories, he was willing to accept Ada's treatment. Unconditional obedience, protection, dependence... these are his unique ways of getting along with his lover.[5]

Original Chinese Character Introduction[]

No one knew about Emil's past, and people's first impression of him was just a poor tramp living in the streets. A high fever took away most of his memories, and when he woke up again, he had become one of the patients in the asylum. Emil suffered a lot in the asylum, but he always accepted being manipulated obediently. Injections, restraints, electrotherapy... He has always been the most silent of the patients (1. The torture in the asylum is not very painful compared with the previous injuries. 2. Although he has amnesia, subconsciously he will die if he is not obedient).

In the asylum, the amnesiac Emil was more silent and calm than others. After getting acquainted with Ada who was admitted to the hospital to practice medicine, he was taken out of the asylum by Ada, and under Ada's care, he gradually recovered some of the emotional reactions and actions of normal people (no longer being forcibly fed sleeping pills, injected with tranquilizers, no longer in the extremely tense environment of the dogfighting arena, and under the protection of Ada to a certain extent, his physical health was restored, and he also regained some of his memories). But what followed was that he would often have flashbacks his days in the asylum and some vague memories of being imprisoned, tied up, and unable to move. Dust was flying all over the sky, and countless people around him cheered wildly. Since then, he has had reflexive panic attacks (PTSD) whenever he is tied to a chair or a hospital bed.

Never able to remember who he was, Emil was taken by Ada as her possession. The relationship between the two is distorted and sincere. Ada doesn't care about Emil's forgotten past, and Emil also accepts Ada's "treatment". After all, compared with the ones in his memory, this kind of treatment with mild pain is indeed a "proof of love".

Before Emil lost his memory, he had been the plaything of the nobles in the underground dogfighting ring. When they got tired of watching the dogs fight and hurt each other, they would often throw a man into the vicious dogs for fun.

Emil tried his best to escape from the dogfighting ring, but was taken away by the asylum who defrauded charity funds. Afterwards, he met Ada in the institution, and is gradually remembering bits and pieces of his memories..[6]

Weibo Character Introduction[]

At the age of 25, Ada Mesmer, a psychologist by profession, became obsessed with hypnotherapy — the ability to hypnotize patients with the help of autosuggestion and special influences to rid them of pain, fear and other negative emotions. However, the subjects could not stand it and did not react to her hypnosis in any way. Having failed time after time, she gave up hypnotherapy and decided to devote herself to other studies.

A few years later, while working temporarily in the White Sand Street Asylum, Ada met Emil, a patient suffering from amnesia. He was silent, mysterious, but most importantly, he reacted perfectly to her hypnosis. Gradually, Ada became attached to Emil, becoming more and more convinced that he was the perfect experiment for her. When the term of the employment contract with the psychiatric hospital came to an end, Ada realized that she had feelings for Emil, and she decided to help him escape.

Suffering from constant fever and headaches, Emil lost most of his memory. After Ada helped Emil escape from the hospital, he managed to recover a little — some normal emotional reactions for a person returned to normal, and with them vague memories returned: "I remember how I was forcibly held, tied up, locked in a cage. The sky was like dust, there were ferocious dogs everywhere and countless people uttering crazy cheers in greeting..."

Ada's research continues, and now a perverted, but sincere love connects her with Emil. Ada took Emil with her and used him to continue experiments with hypnosis. She firmly believes that Emil, suffering from amnesia, needs treatment, and only she can save him. Although sometimes life with Ada causes Emil pain, it also makes him feel happy. Perfect obedience, dependence and the desire to protect Ada are for him a true 'proof of love' for her.[7]

Compiled Overview[]

Backstory[]

His backstory is directly connected to the Psychologist's backstory.

Emil was born the 'runt' of four children to a dysfunctional family. His mother struggled with her mental health, resulting in her breaking the dishes and having to be tied to a bed in the middle of her episodes. The family was too poor to take care of their children, so they gave Emil up to a man who owned an underground dog-fighting ring. Emil's new guardian often berated Emil for not bringing home enough money from begging to keep them afloat, simultaneously neglecting his needs. A young Ada Mesmer took pity on Emil while he was panhandling and bought him some bread.[15] Ada returned home to ask her father to help Emil; much to her chagrin, he refused.

One day, Emil snuck into the dog-fighting pit while a match was underway. The dogs turned on Emil, leaving him severely injured and traumatized in front of a blood-thirsty audience.

From that point onward, Emil was raised like a fighting dog and used as human bait. He was fitted with a collar, confined to a kennel and shackled to the inside with nothing but mush in a dog bowl to eat. Emil's mental health rapidly declined while isolated from human contact, his behavior resembling that of dogs more than humans. He became emotionally unstable and attacked a guard after he tried to seize food from Emil.

Eventually, Emil escaped. Running a high fever, he stumbled onto White Sand Street and was later involuntarily admitted to the infamous White Sand Street Asylum. Dramatic memory loss occurred after recuperating from his fever; a piece of torn fabric from a collar with his name on it was the only clue Emil and the staff had left of his past.[16]

Emil was placed in one of the 'cages'— solitary confinement chambers reserved for patients with dangerous conditions. He grew sullen and taciturn as he subconsciously feared that speaking out would be met with punishment. Emil was also force-fed a dangerous amount of sedatives in either pill or liquid form, causing serious damage to his nervous system. This made it physically impossible for Emil to resist treatment. As Emil could no longer respond to pain and most interactions with doctors, pain stimuli such as (in extreme cases) electroshock therapy would be used to verify that he was conscious during treatments.

Ada, now an assistant professor of psychology, intended to undergo an eleven-day medical training program at the asylum.[17] She didn't remember Emil, but she was fascinated by his reaction to electroshock therapy and requested to administer the treatments herself. Ada gained Emil's trust instantly; he noticed that she smelled nice and was far gentler with him than any of the other doctors were. Slowly, Emil began to recognize her as the kind young girl that fed him when he was a teenager.[18] Knowing that the sedatives were hurting him, Ada decided to lower his dosage; this allowed him to be conscious but also significantly increased the amount of pain he had to endure. The following day, he cried out and convulsed while receiving electroshock therapy, threatening Ada in his panicked state. Ada was the only doctor on duty at the time, so she blew her whistle for help.

She discovered that the whistle served as a tranquillizer for Emil, and she likened his reaction to that of dogs to their master's whistle. Ada had been researching hypnotherapy before she came to the asylum and Emil's extreme pain tolerance made him a viable test subject. Thrilled to have found a person so deeply susceptible to hypnosis, Ada hoped she could use him to advance her research in hypnosis and to cure him.

Ada felt guilty for decreasing his dosage of pain medication, as it made the asylum's treatments much more painful. Despite this, she continued to reduce his dosage and told him that she had been the one to take away the medication. She explained her reasoning, that she wanted him to be more awake, even if it caused more pain. Ada wrote him a note asking him whether he'd prefer "Ada or medicine?" In order to avoid further sedation at the asylum, Emil chose "Ada." She picked two flowers that afternoon, one of which she intended to give to Emil only to find him mumbling about her in his sleep when she returned. Suddenly, Ada realized who Emil was, that he remembered her and that they had met before. Ada placed the flower next to Emil's bed along with a sweet and soft loaf of bread and a note for him to wake up to.[18] Two days later, Emil handed her a ring made from his bed's wire to thank her for the gift.

Emil wrote positively of their interactions in his diary, limited in vocabulary due to his lack of education but determined to express what was in his heart.[19] Approaching the end of her contract, Ada visited Emil’s ‘cage’ and told him that she had three days left until she would have to leave. She decided to help Emil escape to a better place and resigned from her position as an assistant professor, promising that they would always be together. The drive to their new home took several hours. They bought cakes, medicine, books and food, picking flowers from the forest behind their house to put inside of a bottle for the table. Ada encouraged Emil to socialize with children from a nearby village in an attempt to improve his spoken language development.

Ada continued to provide hypnotherapy for Emil. The sessions worked wonderfully; Emil had grown capable of describing many of his flashbacks to Ada, who believed that she could free him from the shackles of his past. Unfortunately, Emil's condition suddenly deteriorated and much of their progress was lost. It was a tragic setback that Ada had not prepared for. After running out of options, Ada made a deal with an old acquaintance to find a cure for Emil at the manor and informed him that they would be departing at once for 'paradise'.[20]

Alternate Theories and Conclusions[]

Patient may be named Emil because of Adam and Eve (Ada for Adam). The initials and number of letters have been swapped.

Their serial numbers are also 0-0-1 and 0-0-2, referencing Adam and Eve being the first humans.
