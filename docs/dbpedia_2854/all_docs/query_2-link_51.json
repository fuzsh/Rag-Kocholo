        "text": "Good health is essential to academic success. Unexpected medical bills can threaten your ability to complete your education should you be uninsured or have inadequate coverage. In an effort to ensure students’ physical and financial health, eligible students are required to purchase or waive the University-sponsored Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP) each academic year. *Not applicable to Lancaster students at this time.\n\nThe SHIP is an ACA-compliant plan insured by UnitedHealthcare Student Resources (UHCSR) and includes access to United's national PPO network. Additional plan information can be found on theStudent Health Insurance Plan (SHIP) website.\n\nStudents who do not submit an approved waiver by the deadline will be automatically enrolled and charged for the Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP). Students intending to purchase the plan should submit the enrollment form to access their insurance benefits.\n\nThe following degree-seeking students from Hawk Hill and University City must maintain active health insurance while attending Saint Joseph’s University. *Not applicable to Lancaster students at this time.\n\nHealth Insurance Requirement Criteria\n\nOne of the goals of the Student Health Center (SHC) is to provide students with high-quality healthcare in a manner that clearly recognizes individual needs and rights. To effectively accomplish this goal, it is necessary for students and health care providers to work together. To that end, the following rights and responsibilities must be recognized and safe guarded.\n\nAs a student you have the following RIGHTS:\n\nTo receive care and treatment with courtesy, respect, privacy and consideration.\n\nTo receive information in terms that you can understand and to have any questions answered concerning your diagnosis, prognosis, treatment and any associated risks.\n\nTo refuse to be examined or treated by health practitioners and to be informed of the consequences of such decisions.\n\nTo be referred to an alternative health care source when appropriate or upon request.\n\nTo participate actively in decisions regarding your health care and treatment.\n\nTo know the identity of your health care provider.\n\nTo review any medical records created and maintained by the SHC regarding your care and treatment, and to request amendments to these records in consultation with your health care provider.\n\nTo have your medical records kept private.\n\nTo file a grievance with the Administrative Director of the SHC if you feel any of these rights have been violated.\n\nAs a student you have the following RESPONSIBILITIES:\n\nTo show courtesy and consideration for the SHC staff.\n\nTo provide complete information about immunizations, past illnesses, hospitalizations, medications and allergies to enable proper evaluation and treatment by clinicians.\n\nTo ask questions or request clarification if needed to ensure that there is an adequate understanding of your health problem or treatment.\n\nTo follow instructions concerning medications, follow-up visits, and other essential steps in our treatment plan, and to notify your provider if the plan cannot be followed, condition worsens or an unexpected reaction occurs.\n\nTo keep scheduled appointments or cancel within a reasonable time ahead so that another person may be given that time slot.\n\nTo be respectful of other patients’ privacy and confidentiality.\n\nTo accept financial responsibility for any charges incurred with any health care provider/hospital/urgent care visit and treatment outside of the SHC.\n\nYou may direct any concerns about Rights and Responsibilities to the Administrative Director of the Student Health Center.\n\nSaint Joseph’s University Student Health Center does not provide medical excuse notes for students due to illness, injury and/or mental health problems that may lead to missed classes, exams or academic deadlines.\n\nIt is the student’s responsibility to inform the professor prior to the missed class, just as the student would be expected to inform their place of employment prior to the start of their work day. It is also the student’s responsibility to make arrangements for missed class work or collecting missed notes of lectures or other assignments as necessary.\n\nJust as Saint Joseph's strives to grow students of competence and character, the Student Health Center encourages students to make healthy and mature decisions when they are sick. This includes healthy eating, adequate sleeping, following medical advice, and possibly missing classes when ill.\n\nAll decisions about the impact of an absence and arrangements for making up missed work must be determined between the professor and student.\n\nThe goal of the Student Health Center is to provide care to as many sick or injured students as possible rather than spending time verifying short term medical absences. This policy is consistent with recommendations from the American College Health Association and is similar to policies at other peer universities.\n\nAssistance with ongoing illness or injury\n\nAny student with an illness, injury, hospitalization or mental health problem requiring multiple absences should contact the Student Health Center. The Health Center will help facilitate communication with Student Success and / or Student Disability Services.\n\nThe Student Health Center maintains a strict policy of confidentiality to safeguard the privacy of your personal and health information. This is an essential component of quality health care and is required by law.\n\nFERPA permits, but does not require, a school to disclose personally identifiable information from a student’s education records, without consent, to appropriate parties in connection with an emergency, if knowledge of the information is necessary to protect the health or safety of the student or other individuals.\n\nEvery undergraduate student has a confidential health record that is maintained in the Student Health Center during your student years and is kept on file for seven years after the conclusion of the academic year last enrolled by the student. ELS students' health records are retained for seven years after the last date that service was rendered. The Student Health Center does not release personal health information to anyone without your written authorization. Exceptions include life-threatening illness/injury or those reasons required by law such as court subpoena or public health reporting requirements.\n\nDownload the Authorization for Release of Confidential Health Information form. Please upload the completed form to the Document Upload section of the Student Health Portal."
