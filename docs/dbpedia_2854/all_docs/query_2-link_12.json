        "text": "Tana Toraja serves up your typical Indonesia fare: lush greenery, friendly and curious locals, markets a-plenty and rice paddies galore. However, unlike the bulk of the country, they do not identify as Muslims (which is practiced by a whopping 89% of Indonesians) and instead they opt for Animism. Well, technically they are Protestant, which was introduced by the Dutch once upon a time, because Animism is not a recognized religion by the Indonesian government. Religion is a whole other basket in Indo, but the key takeaway here is that they maintain their Animist roots.\n\nIn stark contrast to Western culture, which tends to avoid death as much as possible, Torajans see earthly life as a single step in a great journey. Rather than fear death, they actually look forward to it and see it as cause for celebration. And celebrate they do; elaborate five-day funerals are attended by the entire community and have the atmosphere of an upbeat music festival. Personally, I find their approach to death to contain a level of acceptance and grace that is so often lost in Western society.\n\nTheir view of death may be refreshing, even healthy some would argue, but it is not without its complexities. Their traditions lead to exorbitant funeral costs, even by Western standards, and often put families in deep debt. In fact, most Torajans spend their entire lifetime saving up for their funeral, and I’m not talking through 401k investments or stocks and bonds. Oh no, no. The wealth I’m talking about is buffalo. These beautiful and brazen creatures are their currency of choice (we’ll get into this later, don’t worry).\n\nIt’s important to note that a funeral cannot take place until all costs covered - and I mean ALL. If enough is not saved during life, it becomes the family’s responsibility to cover the rest, which is where it gets real interesting. Since acquiring money takes time, particularly when in the middle of an island in the middle of islands, the dead are cared for in the family home - after a healthy dousing of formaldehyde, of course - until the finances are in order.\n\nSo far, the main takeaways are: brazen buffalo, family mummies and ridiculously expensive funerals. Still with me? Good. If not, hopefully the glossary below will make it easier as we go.\n\nOn the final day of the funeral, a procession parades the deceased to their final resting place, which can be in one of three places: in a stone wall, on a cliffside or in a cave. No matter the method, they are always cleaned and well-prepared for the afterlife. Before being taken to their final resting place, loved ones will fill the coffin with money, cigarettes (many, many cigarettes), clothes, soda, candy and anything else to make the journey to Puya more pleasant.\n\nBut the fun doesn’t stop there.\n\nEach August, the family will re-open the grave in a ceremony known as Me’nene. The deceased are cleaned, changed into new clothes and have their coffin tidied up. This is also a special time when younger Torajans are able to meet their ancestors. Stories are shared, selfies and updated family photos are taken and relatives may even share a cigarette with the dead. Before being returned, their grave is refilled with additional items, such as the dead’s glasses or favorite trinkets."
