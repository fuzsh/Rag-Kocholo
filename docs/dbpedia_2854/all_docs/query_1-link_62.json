        "text": "The Misión San Francisco de Asís was founded October 9, 1776. The settlement was named for St. Francis of Assisi, the founder of the Franciscan Order, but was also commonly known as \"Mission Dolores\" owing to the presence of a nearby creek named Arroyo de los Dolores, or \"Creek of Sorrows.\"\n\nMission Dolores is the oldest intact building in the City of San Francisco and the only intact Mission Chapel in the chain of 21 established under the direction of Father Serra. The Mission has been a steadfast witness to the span of San Francisco's history including the California Gold Rush and the 1906 San Francisco Earthquake. The Mission Cemetery is the only cemetery that remains within the City limits. The Cemetery is the final resting place for numerous Ohlone, Miwok, and other First Californians as well as notable California pioneers.\n\nWe invite you to visit Mission Dolores to learn about its unique historic, religious, and architectural significance as well as enjoy its tranquil garden and cemetery.\n\nThe Cemetery and Gardens of Mission Dolores are located adjacent to the Old Mission. The beautiful gardens have been restored and planted with traditional native trees, shrubs, flowers, and plants from the 1791 period. The rose garden was a gift of the Golden Gate Rose Society and is tended by members of the Society every week. Our garden also contains an Ohlone Indian ethno-botanic garden and examples of Native American plants and artifacts.\n\nMission Dolores is the final resting place of some 5,000 Ohlone, Miwok, and other First Californians who built Mission Dolores and were its earliest members and founders. Other notables include the first Mexican governor, Luis Antonio Arguello, the first commandant of the Presidio, Lieutenant Moraga, and victims of the Committee of Vigilance, Cora, Casey, and Sullivan. Cemetery markers date from 1830 to about 1898.\n\nBy reservation only for groups of ten or more. It is suggested that you make reservations 4-6 weeks in advance. Docents are volunteers and availability is limited. A deposit is required. Please email the Curator Andy Galvan at chochenyo@aol.com.\n\nMission Dolores welcomes hundreds of school groups every year. A 90-minute guided tour is available with at least four weeks notice and subject to availability. Due to the large numbers of students visiting the Old Mission and concerns for the safety of visitors and the priceless cultural treasures of Mission Dolores, schools must have reservations. Suggested donation for students is $ 5.00 per student, $ 10.00 per adult with an advance deposit required. Field trips are usually scheduled at 10:00am, 11:30am, and 1:00pm, subject to availability. Please email the Curator, Andy Galvan at chochenyo@aol.com to set up a reservation.\n\nGuided Tours Form is ONLY for school-organized and large group tours. Small groups just come no need to complete the form.\n\nNo need for reservations for self-guided tours.\n\nFree parking available\n\n(on weekends)"
