        "text": "Workers Memorial Day has been observed annually on April 28 since 1989. It calls attention to the extent of workplace accidents and illnesses, and it promotes awareness of health and safety issues. The date, April 28, was chosen because it is the anniversary of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).\n\nA Workers Memorial Day event was held this year at the NJ Department of Labor and Workforce Development, 1 John Fitch Way, Trenton. The event included speakers from the New Jersey State Industrial Safety Committee, the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.\n\nThe New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development (NJDOL), the New Jersey State Industrial Safety Committee (NJSISC), and the U.S Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) signed an agreement renewing their collaborative relationship to continue to foster safer and healthier workplaces in the Garden State.\n\nRecommitting to an alliance first signed on December 18, 2018, the participating agencies will continue to share information, resources, guidance, and access to training and education to develop and improve workplace safety and health practices and programs, as well as safety recognition programs to recognize New Jersey employers who demonstrate an outstanding commitment to preventing workplace injuries and illness.\n\nClick here to view a copy of the signed agreement.\n\nThe mission of the U. S. Marine Corps Reserve Toys for Tots Program is to collect new, unwrapped toys during October, November, and December each year, and distribute those toys as Christmas gifts to less fortunate children in the community in which the campaign is conducted. The NJSISC participates in the Toys for Tots Drive each year during their December meeting. The collected toys are donated to local children and this event is something we plan to continue each year.\n\nOur membership includes health and safety professionals and employees that promote safety in their workplace. The New Jersey State Industrial Safety Committee consists of members from both the public and private sector. We meet quarterly throughout New Jersey.\n\nTo be considered for membership on the Committee, a person shall have a prominent role in the field of occupational safety and health in New Jersey, or a person who is responsible for occupational safety and health matters within the organization located in New Jersey by which they are employed. Our Rules explain the Committee structure and history. A current member must recommend you.\n\nTo complete a membership application, click here. Upon completion of the application, please email your resume to Membership Committee Member Kristen Affrime at kaffrime@cwa-union.org and ask a current NJSISC Member to complete the recommendation form. Contact kaffrime@cwa-union.org with any questions.\n\nAs temperatures rise in New Jersey and New York over the next few days, the U.S. Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration reminds employers and workers not to ignore the dangers of working in hot weather – indoors and out – and remember “Water. Rest. Shade.” can be the difference between ending the workday safely or suffering serious injuries or worse.\n\nFrom 2011-2019, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports 344 worker-related deaths in U.S. were due to environmental heat exposure. Workplace safety experts believe the actual number of heat-related fatalities may be underreported or misreported as another cause, such as heart attacks. Nearly 3 out of 4 heat illness fatalities happen during the first week of work. New and returning workers need to build tolerance to heat by taking frequent breaks and working shorter shifts in the heat to start.\n\nOSHA’s message is simple: Water. Rest. Shade.\n\nEncourage workers to drink water every 15 minutes.\n\nTake frequent rest breaks in the shade to cool down.\n\nHave an emergency plan ready to respond when a worker shows signs of heat-related illness.\n\nTrain workers on the hazards of heat exposure, and how to prevent illness.\n\nAllow workers to build a tolerance for working in heat.\n\nThe OSHA-NIOSH Heat Safety Tool is a free, downloadable app that calculates a worksite’s heat index and displays the associated risk levels. Users can receive precautionary recommendations specific to heat index risk levels to help protect employees from heat-related illness. The tool is available in English and Spanish.\n\nOSHA’s Occupational Heat Exposure page explains the symptoms of heat illness and first aid measures to provide while waiting for help.\n\nRead a fact sheet on OSHA’s National Emphasis Program to protect workers across the nation from the increasing threat of heat related illness. Learn more about working in outdoor and indoor heat environments.\n\nTo learn more about heat illness prevention and first aid, visit www.osha.gov/heat."
