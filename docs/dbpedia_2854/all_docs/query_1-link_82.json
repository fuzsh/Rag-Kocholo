The most famous Key West epitaph ‚ÄúI told you I was sick!‚Äù was left for us by B.P. Roberts (better known as Pearl) who died in 1979.\n\nKey West offers a FREE Self-Guided Tour brochure available below the historical marker at the main entrance to the cemetery. Below is one that says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just resting my eyes‚Äù are the last words of Gloria Russell located above B.P. Roberts in the same crypt. Both of these are #36 on the self-guided tour map.\n\nTo leave an epitaph about yourself is one thing, but to include a famous person in yours is just weird as in this one from #48 on the tour map is Edwina Lariz who claims that she was a ‚ÄúDevoted Fan Of Singer Julio Iglesias‚Äù‚Ä¶ I guess so to put that on your headstone you‚Äôd have to be! üôÇ Look, these people wouldn‚Äôt have written them if they didn‚Äôt want us to talk about them‚Ä¶ they weren‚Äôt written to be overlooked. If you‚Äôve enjoyed these tombstone tidbits then please pass them along to others who might enjoy reading and learning more about Key West‚Äôs unique final resting place. PS ‚Äì I‚Äôve got plenty more so don‚Äôt you dare creep out on me!"
