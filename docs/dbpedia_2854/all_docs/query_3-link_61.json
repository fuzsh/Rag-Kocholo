        "text": "If you want to know how to turn silver into gold, then look no further than Great Britain’s Alex Yee. In another epic duel with New Zealand’s Hayden Wilde – a rivalry that has become a hallmark of the modern short-course racing – the flying Brit, as has so often happened, had the edge and got the result. But this time, at the Paris Olympic men’s triathlon race, he had to really work for it, closing down 14 seconds in the final run lap to finally take the tape ahead of silver medalist Wilde.\n\nIf the two standout favorites delivered, it was also an outstanding day for the home nation, as Leo Bergere picked up bronze following Beaugrand’s victory earlier in the morning.\n\nBergere was pushed all the way by teammate Pierre Le Corre, who finished fourth, but defending Olympic champion Kristian Blummenfelt’s ambitious return from long-course racing ultimately didn’t pay off as he came in 12th place.\n\nIt also wasn’t the day Team USA’s main contender, Morgan Pearson, had hoped for. The Boulder-based 30-year-old will have to refocus his energies on the mixed team relay after being caught on the wrong side of a bike split early on. Pearson finished in 30th, two places behind fellow American Seth Rider.\n\nParis Olympic Men’s Triathlon: Late Start, Sweltering Conditions\n\nFor the best part of three years, the male elite triathletes of the Paris Olympic Games had been preparing for an 8 a.m. start in cool conditions. After the endless concerns over heat and humidity at the Rio and Tokyo Games, many were welcoming the idea of not having to hear the dreaded words “Wet Bulb Globe” (the measurement of whether it’s safe to compete) until at least the L.A. Games in 2028.\n\nBut only hours before the men’s individual triathlon race in Paris, that all changed. After subpar water quality tests forced the men’s race from 8 a.m. on Tuesday to 10:45 a.m. Wednesday (following the women’s race that same day), athletes learned their race would finish in the sweltering 80-degree F heat and 79% humidity. What was set to be the sternest of tests got even tougher.\n\nParis Olympic Men’s Triathlon: The Swim\n\nAs with the women’s race less than three hours earlier (and aided by being a non-wetsuit contest) the men’s swim was quick to split up. Also as in the women’s race, a number of athletes were issued a 15-second penalty for errors at the start: Shachar Sagiv (ISR), Richard Murray (NED), Antonio Serrat Seoane (ESP), Manoel Messias (BRA), Emil Holm (DEN), and Csongor Lehmann (HUN).\n\n2016 Rio bronze medallist Henri Schoeman (RSA) quickly cut across from the far right of the pontoon to gain the best of the current, but it was Australia’s Matt Hauser who snuck up the inside on the first lap to lead after the Aussie exit at the 950-meter mark.\n\nThe three French contenders – Dorian Coninx, Pierre Le Corre, and Leo Bergere – were surely riding on the wave of teammate Cassandre Beaugrand’s success. With their race kicking off minutes after Beaugrand’s home-soil win in the women’s race, all three were handily placed in the top 10 after the first lap, along with Britain’s medal favorite Alex Yee.\n\nAfter the shorter second lap of 550 meters, Italy’s Alessio Crociani was first to exit the water in 20:10 and led the field up the steps and into transition, joined by Hauser and Schoeman. Eight seconds down were Coninx and Le Corre. Seth Rider was the best-placed of the two U.S. hopes in eighth, with Morgan Pearson, who tasted his first World Series victory in Yokohama in May, in 34th place, 1:20 down from Crociani.\n\nOnly 29 seconds separated first place and 19th out of the swim as the race – and the conditions – heated up.\n\nParis Olympic Men’s Triathlon: The Bike\n\nAny comparisons to the women’s race ended at T1, as the course conditions could hardly have contrasted more than with the start of the wet and slick women’s race. As the race heated up, any remaining moisture on the flat, technical bike course evaporated quickly, along with Pearson’s hopes – who already found himself 90 seconds down on the bike and then found himself in a five-man third chase pack, with too much firepower ahead.\n\nUp front, the French trio of Bergere, Le Corre, and Coninx – so strong that they kept two-time world champion Vincent Luis on the sidelines when the French team was selected – were conscious of the dual threat of Yee and Hayden Wilde (NZL) on the final 10-kilometer run leg.\n\nBut as they made their way through the bike course, they realized they’d have to shake more than just Yee and Wilde before T2. On their rear wheel a 19-strong leading group had formed, with the likes of Rider, Hauser, and Marten Van Riel (BEL) looking to make a big move.\n\nOnly 26 seconds behind on lap two was a formidable chase pack containing Wilde, Tokyo Olympic champion Kristian Blummenfelt (NOR) and Portugal’s Vasco Vilaca. As they pushed the pace, it was clear things were coming down quickly for the Frenchmen at the front.\n\nBy the end of the fourth lap, the catch had been made, and the front group swelled to 30, including most of the pre-race favorites and the entire podium from the Tokyo Games.\n\nHaving won almost everything there is to win in triathlon, Blummenfelt has confirmed he will turn his attention to pro cycling next year, and the center of Paris presented the perfect opportunity to put on a showcase. In the absence of teammate and training partner Gustav Iden, who did not qualify for the Paris Games, Blummenfelt pulled fellow Norwegian Vetle Thorn to the front of the race for company in the bike group, with Thorn in the best shape of his career after a fourth place at WTCS Cagliari in May.\n\nWith a bigger group and little to be gained by a breakaway so close to the second transition, there was little separation in the now 32-strong lead pack. If anyone did try and make a move, Great Britain’s Sam Dickinson, who was tasked with working for teammate Yee, quickly moved to shut it down.\n\nDickinson, Blummenfelt, and Thorn crossed the bike dismount timing mat at the exact same time, with nine more (including Bergere, Wilde, and Rider) crossing in the next second and a total of 32 athletes (including Yee, Coninx, and Vilaca) crossing within a nine-second timeframe. More than three minutes down were Pearson, Holm, and Sachar; a third pack entered T2 more than five minutes behind the leaders.\n\nParis Olympic Men’s Triathlon: The Run\n\nHeading into T2, Dickinson was determined to make the most of his moment in the sunshine, and transitioned quickly to lead out onto the run. But the real action was behind, and once the identical trisuit of Yee flew by, it was game on.\n\nThe 2023 Paris test event had witnessed Yee float imperiously to victory, and this looked like set for a little history repeating. Within the first two kilometers, he had opened a gap on the field. But history did indeed repeat itself when almost instinctively, Wilde appeared at his shoulder. The two often find each other in the run at World Triathlon Championship Series events, racing neck-and-neck in an ongoing battle of mind and body.\n\nBut while the duo have so often run side-by-side until Yee pulled clear at the last possible moment, this time it was Wilde who took the initiative, regularly glancing down at his watch as he strode away.\n\nBy the halfway mark, Wilde was clear, but Yee looked in trouble, and the trio of Bergere, Le Corre, and Canadian Tyler Mislawchuk were closing. But Yee, refusing to yield, entered the final lap set on closing the 14-second gap Wilde had opened up. But would it prove to be too much to claw back in such a short timeframe?\n\nThe answer: Of course not. Yee dug deep and surged ahead of Wilde in the final stretch, finishing in 1:43:33 to win his first gold medal in the men’s individual triathlon, adding to his silver medal in individual triathlon and gold in mixed relay from the Tokyo Games.\n\nWilde followed six seconds behind to take silver, collapsing at the finish line with his friend and rival. Bergere finished ten seconds behind, taking bronze in front of a roaring home crowd.\n\nWhat happened to Morgan Pearson in the Paris Olympic triathlon?\n\nPearson faced an uphill battle all day, citing issues with competitors on the swim and bike.\n\n“We’re chasing the pack and losing the pack, and guys are swimming up by my ***** feet and I’m just looking at the pack swim away,” an emotional Pearson told Triathlete, just moments after finishing. “Those guys [swimming away] all made the front pack, and I’m leading this chase pack and these guys are just pushing me under the water. And we ***** lose 15 seconds and that’s the ******* race.”\n\n“I was right next to Hayden [Wilde] and Seth [Rider], and all of a sudden these guys are pushing me under the water for no reason.”\n\nAfter emerging from the River Seine in 34th place, things didn’t get any easier for Pearson, who struggled to get any rhythm with his bike group. He told Triathlete that he narrowly averted a crash, before being attacked by his own chase pack.\n\n“I almost slid out coming up into transition on lap three, and [my bike group] tried to gap me,” Pearson said. “Like, sick dude, 40th place. What are we trying to do here?”\n\n“Tokyo was completely different. Today I felt good.”\n\nParis Olympic Triathlon Results: Men’s Individual"
