        "text": "Attendance Policy\n\nShorecrest High School is here to support and encourage our students to succeed! Regular attendance plays a big role in creating a positive learning environment as well as helping students to thrive both in and out of the classroom. Parents and guardians can help by encouraging their students to develop habits of coming to school on time, every day.\n\nStudents and their families have the responsibility for maintaining prompt and regular attendance as prescribed in the Compulsory Attendance Law RCW 28A.225.\n\nPlease contact the Attendance Office if you have any questions about our policy or your students attendance!\n\nIf needing to contact the Attendance Office, please do NOT call the main office.\n\nCall the Attendance Office directly at 206-393-4294.\n\nOr email sc.attendance@ssd412.org\n\nHow to excuse absences:\n\nContact the attendance office by email to sc.attendance@ssd412.org, phone call/voicemail, or ParentSquare message sent within 5 school-days since the absence occurred. Any absence outside of the 5 days will not be excused.\n\nIf you are calling in to excuse an absence, please directly call the attendance office, NOT the main office. The number for the attendance line is 206-393-4294.\n\nVoicemails can be left at any time and are checked regularly.\n\nMessage to excuse an absence must include:\n\nThe full name of the student (first AND LAST) as found on file. (No nicknames/alternative names unless already changed in Skyward).\n\nReason for absence. This is necessary for auditing and coding purposes - we will not excuse without a reason. (See list of reasons below).\n\nDate(s) to excuse and period(s) to excuse.\n\nExample: “Hi, my name is Jane. I am John Smith's mother and would like to excuse him for today. He is sick.”\n\nStudents who are 18 years or older can excuse their own absences ONLY if they pick up a form from the attendance office and return it with a parent/guardian signature.\n\nNOTE: TARDIES ARE NOT EXCUSABLE UNLESS student has a medical note (from an appointment). We do not excuse tardies for anything outside of this.\n\nWhen you excuse, please tell us the reason for the absence:\n\nAccording to district policy #3122, the following are valid excuses for absences:\n\nPhysical health or mental health symptoms, illness, health condition or medical appointment (including, but not limited to, medical, counseling, mental health wellness, dental, optometry, pregnancy, and behavioral health treatment (which can include in-patient or out-patient treatment for chemical dependency or mental health) for the student or person for whom the student is legally responsible;\n\nFamily emergency including, but not limited to, a death or illness in the family;\n\nReligious or cultural purposes including observance of a religious or cultural holiday or participation in religious or cultural instruction;\n\nCourt, judicial proceeding, court-ordered activity, or jury service;\n\nPost-secondary, technical school or apprenticeship program visitation, or scholarship interview;\n\nState-recognized search and rescue activities consistent with RCW28A.225.055;\n\nAbsence directly related to the student's homeless or foster care/dependency status;\n\nAbsences related to deployment activities of a parent or legal guardian who is an active duty member consistent with RCW 28A.705.010;\n\nAbsences due to suspensions, expulsions or emergency expulsions imposed pursuant to chapter 392-400 WAC if the student is not receiving educational services and is not enrolled in qualifying \"course of study\" activities as defined in WAC 392-121-107;\n\nAbsences due to student safety concerns, including absences related to threats, assaults, or bullying;\n\nAbsences due to a student's migrant status; and\n\nAn approved activity that is consistent with district policy and is mutually agreed upon by the principal or designee and a parent, guardian, or emancipated youth.\n\nAbsences due to the student’s lack of necessary instruction tools, including internet access or connectivity.\n\nThe school principal (or designee) has the authority to determine if an absence meets the above criteria for an excused absence. A parent/guardian not satisfied with the principal determination may appeal to the superintendent/designee for further consideration.\n\nHow to request an early dismissal:\n\nContact the attendance office by email to sc.attendance@ssd412.org, phone call/voicemail, or ParentSquare message at least 2 hours before your student needs to be dismissed.\n\nThis is to ensure we have enough time to get a pass to your student so they can leave when they need to with minimal disruption to that classroom.\n\nMessage to request an early dismissal must include:\n\nThe full name of the student (first AND LAST) as found on file. (No nicknames/alternative names unless already changed in Skyward).\n\nTime you would like them to be dismissed.\n\nReason for the early dismissal - for auditing and coding purposes.\n\nInform us if your student will be returning that day, and what time they plan on doing so.\n\nThis way, we can excuse periods they will not attend, and be counted present in the ones they will attend. For athletes, this is important for them to be eligible to participate in their sport for the day.\n\nExample: “Hi, my name is Jane. I am John Smith's mother. He is needing an early dismissal at 12pm, and will not return for the rest of the day due to a doctor's appointment.”\n\nIf your student misses more than 50% of class, it is counted as an absence.\n\nCampus is closed during all classes and passing periods, with the exception of lunch. Students will not be permitted to leave campus without contact from a parent/guardian during closed campus time.\n\nI have sent the message - now what?\n\nEarly dismissal: Once you have sent a message to the attendance secretary at sc.attendance@ssd412.org, or called in to (206) 393-4294 with all the information needed, your student should pick up their dismissal pass from the Attendance Office prior to the period that they are leaving.\n\nOnce they have this pass, they are allowed to leave campus at the time written on the pass (students do not need to check in with attendance prior to leaving).\n\nPlease coordinate with your student which parking lot you are picking them up in.\n\nPlease keep in mind that buses will be blocking the front entrance at the end of the day in preparation for departure.\n\nNOTE: Students returning to school from an early dismissal while a period is already in session must check in with the attendance office. They will receive a late pass upon returning (this is excused). If you receive a message on ParentSquare about a tardy upon returning from an early dismissal, please note this is excused and does not negatively impact their attendance.\n\nHow to excuse an extended absence in advance:\n\nStudents should pick up an Advanced Notice of Absence Form from the attendance office. Once the form is completed and signed by the student's teachers and parent/guardian, the student returns the form to the attendance office BEFORE their extended absence.\n\nWhat happens if an absence is UNexcused:\n\nEach time your student has an unexcused absence, we notify you via automated phone calls and emails on the day your student is absent.\n\nWe notify twice a day — a robo call and email go out at 11:15am. A robo email is sent out at 5:15pm.\n\nParents are expected to contact the Attendance Office with any questions, concerns, or excuses within 2 school days.\n\nConsequences for accumulating absences:\n\nIf a student accumulates 2, 5, 7, or 10 days of unexcused absences in an academic school year, a Truancy letter will be sent home. See the Truancy section below for more details.\n\nTruancy:\n\nLetters will be mailed home at intervals of 2, 5, 7, and 10 days of unexcused absences from school. These absences do not have to be consecutive and are counted throughout the school year.\n\nA day is counted if the student misses the majority of the school day.\n\nAccording to Washington State truancy laws (RCW 28A.225) after seven (7) unexcused absences in one month, or fifteen (15) in one year, school districts must file a “truancy petition” alleging a violation of the law by the student, by the parent, or by both.\n\nAccording to the State of Washington, an unexcused absence is student nonattendance for more than 50% of the student’s school day. This nonattendance has not been approved by a parent/guardian through the attendance office within 2 school days.\n\nWe strongly encourage the parent/guardian to contact the attendance office to schedule a conference with an administrator to develop strategies to eliminate student absences when a student has reached two (2) unexcused absences in a one-month period.\n\nTardies:\n\nAs a school, we want students to know and learn the value of being on time, the expectation of being ready to engage, and of honoring the professional relationship between teacher and student. It is critical that students practice and learn the habits and life lessons of punctuality and commitment because they are essential as students move onto college, a career, and life as a part of a larger community. As a school dedicated to educating young people, students deserve a clear, consistent practice.\n\nWhen a student is tardy (less than 10 minutes late to class), they do not need to report to the attendance office. Their teacher will mark them as tardy.\n\nIf a student is more than 10 minutes late to class, they need to check in at the attendance office to get a pass to class.\n\nOnce a student has missed more than 50% of class, they are considered absent. When they check in at the attendance office, their arrival time is noted and they are given a pass to attend the remainder of the class period.\n\nParentSquare Attendance notifications:\n\nAbsence notifications:\n\nIf you suspect there is an error within your student’s attendance, please have your student contact their teacher. The attendance office can only rely on data reports. If you are looking to confirm a student’s attendance, please reach out to their teacher directly. Their teacher will then need to inform attendance if an error made needs to be adjusted.\n\nConfirmation from a staff member who was present in the class during the attendance in question is necessary for any attendance adjustments.\n\nTardy notifications:\n\nAttendance is taken within the first 10 minutes of class. If a student is running more than 10 minutes late, they must check into the tardy kiosk to receive a late pass or they will continue to be marked absent. Checking into the kiosk will override the attendance taken by their teacher, as well as give us a time stamp of their arrival for staff and parent/guardian reference. We do not excuse tardies without a medical note.\n\nParentSquare notification adjustments:\n\nPost notifications can be turned off and are adjustable on the user’s end (immediate, digest, or off) through your profile settings. You will still receive emergency notifications. These are for safety reasons and are not able to be turned off.\n\n20 Consecutive Absences:\n\nWashington State law states that school districts cannot claim a student for funding if they have not attended at least one full day in the last 20 consecutive school days. At 20 consecutive days of absence, we are required to withdraw your student for non-attendance.\n\nAt this time, Shoreline School District only offers in-person learning. If your student is not able to regularly attend classes in-person at Shorecrest High School and is interested in an online/remote learning option, please see the list of OSPI (Office of Superintendent of Instruction) approved online school programs.\n\nFor additional support in enrolling in one of these options, please contact your student’s school counselor.\n\nLast updated: August 2022"
