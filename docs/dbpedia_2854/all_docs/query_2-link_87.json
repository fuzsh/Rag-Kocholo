The base wage for tipped employees remains $8.40 per hour.\n\nYou can find a sample notice for employees, rules and regulations, and frequently asked questions in the Downloads section of this page.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n(last updated May 2024)\n\nThe Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) provide guidance to employers and employees on the requirements of the Cook County Minimum Wage Ordinance (MWO) and procedural rules, as well as answers to questions commonly submitted to the Cook County Human Rights Commission (Commission). These FAQs should not be interpreted as legal advice. Where these FAQs conflict with the MWO or rules, the ordinance and rules shall be applied.\n\nThe MWO sets the lowest amount an employer must legally pay their employees. Each year the minimum wage increases according to a formula set by the Ordinance.\n\nThe Ordinance applies to hourly, salaried, and tipped employees, over the age of 18, working in Cook County, even those who may be working within the County to make deliveries or driving within the County limits.\n\nThere are exceptions to the categories of employees covered by the Ordinance.\n\nEvery year on July 1, the Commission may adjust the minimum wage based on the greatest rate among the Federal minimum wage, Illinois State minimum wage, or on the County’s calculation using the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Pursuant to the Minimum Wage Ordinance (MWO) (Sec. 42-13) and rules (Sec. 2.04), the Cook County minimum wage calculation may not be used when the unemployment rate in Cook County is 8.5% or greater. In the event that the Cook County unemployment rate exceeds 8.5%, the minimum wage is set to the greatest of the Federal, Illinois State or Cook County's minimum wage.\n\nAs of July 1, 2024, the minimum wage for non-tipped workers increased to $14.05 per hour for standard work hours and $21.08 per hour for overtime hours (in compliance with State Law). The minimum wage for tipped workers remains $8.40 per hour for standard work hours and $15.40 per hour for overtime hours (in compliance with State Law).\n\nThe Ordinance does not apply to employees under the age of 18 years. However, the Illinois Minimum Wage Act requires teenage workers to be paid a minimum wage of $12.00 per hour, with annual increases. See Illinois State Minimum Wage Chart below.\n\nYearMinimum WageTippedYouths Under 18\n\n(working less than 650 hours per calendar year)1/1/20$9.25$5.55$8.007/1/20$10.00$6.00$8.001/1/21$11.00$6.60$8.501/1/22$12.00$7.20$9.251/1/23$13.00$7.80$10.501/1/24$14.00$8.40$12.001/1/25$15.00$9.00$13.00\n\nNo, the City of Chicago has its own MWO.\n\nNo, if a municipality has passed their own minimum wage (like the City of Chicago) then the municipality's minimum wage applies to employers located within or doing business in the municipality. If the municipality has not enacted their own minimum wage, the County’s MWO applies. Certain municipalities in Cook County have opted out of the MWO. The list of municipalities that do not follow the MWO changes frequently. Please check with the local city, township, or village to confirm whether your municipality has adopted the MWO.\n\nYes, generally, the Ordinance requires all employers that are located within Cook County and gainfully employ any person(s) who performs at least two hours of work within a two-week period within the geographic boundaries of Cook County to comply with the County minimum wage.\n\nYes, the Ordinance applies to tipped employees. The minimum wage for tipped employees is $8.40.\n\nThe MWO does not apply to independent contractors.\n\nEmployers are not required to pay minimum wage during the first 90 days of employment.\n\n*Note that this exception does not apply to day laborers, temporary, or seasonal workers. These workers must be paid the County’s minimum wage during the entire duration of employment.\n\nYou should first check to see if the municipality where you work has a different minimum wage. If the municipality has not opted out, you can file a Complaint with the Cook County Human Rights Commission. Complaint forms and additional information can be found online.\n\nYou may contact a Human Rights Investigator if you have any questions about the complaint process. Investigators for the Commission can be reached by telephone at 312-603-1100, email at human.rights@cookcountyil.gov, or by appointment.\n\nThe Human Rights Commission does not provide lawyers or legal advice. Our investigators conduct neutral fact-finding investigations, which include gathering information and conducting interviews to determine if a violation of the MWO has occurred.\n\nPlease note that individuals may obtain legal advice and assistance filing complaints with the Commission from nonprofit organizations that handle housing issues in Cook County.\n\nThe Commission may order employers found to have violated the Cook County Minimum Wage Ordinance to provide complainants a remedy, which may include the following:\n\nPay back wages\n\nReinstate a wrongfully terminated complainant\n\nGive a required notice or make a required posting of the minimum wage\n\nDisqualify a respondent from receiving County benefits including licensing and property tax incentives.\n\nPaying employees less than the applicable minimum wage.\n\nConfiscating gratuities of tipped employees.\n\nCharging employees counterfeit fees payable to the employer as a way of reducing their effective hourly rate of pay.\n\nFailing to notify employees of their rights under the Cook County Minimum Wage Ordinance.\n\nFailing to post a notice advising of the current minimum wages under the Cook County Minimum Wage (in a conspicuous place at each facility where any Covered Employee works that is located within the geographic boundaries of Cook County).\n\nFiring an employee who is considering or has filed a Minimum Wage complaint or otherwise cooperating with a Commission investigation.\n\nThe Commission may also levy fines of $500.00 to $1,000.00 for each offense."
