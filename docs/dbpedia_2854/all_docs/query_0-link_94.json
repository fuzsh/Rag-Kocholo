Thanks for your support!\n\nMy Road Trip to Sedona\n\nThose of you who follow me on my socials might know my grandmother passed away earlier this year. She always had a special place in her heart for Sedona, Arizona, and adored the red rocks that make the area so famous. It was her final wish that her ashes be scattered there amongst those gorgeous red rock formations. As the traveler of the family and an ever-dutiful granddaughter with minimal social engagements to keep me tethered to Los Angeles, I volunteered to take her to her final resting place. So I packed up my bags and headed out from Los Angeles on a drive to Sedona for what was an epic Arizona road trip.\n\nAt this point, I feel compelled to say if you’re not a regular reader of my blog and just happened to come here for some excellent advice on what kind of scenic drives Sedona has to offer, rest assured I’m getting there. It’s not all a tear-jerking tale of how I carried an urn across the country from Wisconsin to Los Angeles and on to Sedona via Las Vegas. (Grandma always loved to travel.) But this is the backstory of how I came to take an epic road trip through Arizona, my grandma’s favorite place on Earth. I hope you fall in love with it as well.\n\nThe Sedona area is also known for its energy vortex sites. These Sedona energy vortex locations are spots where the earth’s energy is reportedly increased. Those who believe in them say they lead to increased self-awareness and various kinds of healing. I visited a few and thus far I’m sad to report there were no miraculous healing effects, but your mileage may vary. We’ll cover several below in our list of things to see in Sedona by car.\n\nAs someone with chronic pain and mobility issues, I found the great thing about Sedona is you don’t have to break your back hiking or climbing to see some of the most gorgeous sites. You can see many by just taking a scenic drive. But I’m here for you and got your back if you have your heart set on finding more adventurous things to do in Sedona.\n\nLas Vegas to Sedona Road Trip\n\nI started my road trip to Sedona in Las Vegas, Nevada, driving past the Hoover Dam heading south on US 93, then taking US 40 East to Flagstaff to US 17 South before reaching the incredibly scenic Highway 89a which brings you directly into Sedona. This is an approximately 4 1/2 hour drive spanning 280 miles.\n\nState Route 89A will take you through the Verde Valley and into Coconino National Forest. If you’re looking to see some of that lush evergreen desert plants while winding through the canyons, this is the way to go.\n\nIt can get warm in Sedona, so if you’re traveling from April to October, make sure you appropriately pack for a summer road trip.\n\nPhoenix to Sedona Road Trip\n\nAnother popular route into Sedona is to drive from Phoenix to Sedona. A Phoenix to Sedona Road Trip is just 2 hours and offers plenty of things to see along the way. On this route, you’ll take the I-17 North for 116 miles.\n\nChapel of the Holy Cross\n\nAmongst my favorite Sedona scenic drives is the trip to see the Chapel of the Holy Cross. From Highway 89A, take Highway 179 South toward the Village of Oak Creek. Turn left on Chapel Road and the Chapel of the Holy Cross will be at the end of the street.\n\nWord of warning, parking can be incredibly difficult, and accessible parking spaces are really limited. When I visited we were unable to find a space. Still, you can take some great photos on the drive up the mountain by pulling off to the side of the road if traffic is slow. Please do not take photos while you are driving.\n\nAirport Mesa\n\nIf you’re looking for unparalleled red rock views and the best place to view a sunset in Sedona, look no further than Airport Mesa. Watching the sunset here is fun for the whole family and one of the best things to do in Sedona with kids.\n\nTo get to Airport Mesa, drive west from Uptown Sedona via Highway 89A for 1.1 miles. Turn left onto Airport Mesa Road and follow it for 1/2 a mile. The parking area will be on the left-hand side. Parking is $3 and allows you entrance all day so you can visit in the morning and come back for sunset for a completely different perspective.\n\nThe parking area is gravel, but the road outside is paved and offers space to take in the scenery. There is also a trail for those looking to hike. The trail leads to the Airport Mesa Vortex. As I am still recovering from my multiple spinal fusion surgeries and prone to rolling my ankles, I did not attempt a hike, other than to quickly dip a few feet down the mountain, surreptitiously scatter my grandmother’s ashes and silently say a few words before the parking attendant could notice.\n\nThe hike does involve some vertical hiking, so it is not for everyone. However, for those able to make it you can enjoy one of Sedona’s energy vortexes. Many people even claim to see colored orbs. Be aware that the trail and site as a whole are particularly popular on weekends. If you’re looking for a less crowded experience, or to scatter the ashes of a loved one in private, I suggest going early. For the best-maintained trail, follow the signs from the parking lot labeled “Overlook.”\n\nWarning, While the trail is short, it is steep. Hiking boots are strongly recommended.\n\nBell Rock\n\nOne of the more famous rock formations in Sedona, Bell Rock is also a popular hiking destination. With an elevation of 4,919 feet, you can see Bell Rock from State Route 179 just north of the Village of Oak Creek, Arizona, just west of Courthouse Butte. It’s easy enough to pull off the road to snap a few pictures.\n\nIf you’re looking to hike Bell Rock, the most popular route involves a moderate hike that reaches a small plateau on the northwest face of the butte. A challenging unmarked trail is the only way to reach the summit. Considering I am in the physical shape to do neither, my photos were taken from Red Rock Loop Road. (More on that below.)\n\nTo reach Bell Rock coming from the Village of Oak Creek, drive north on Highway 179. Turn Right on Bell Rock Boulevard to access the main trailhead.\n\nGrand Canyon National Park\n\nIs it even an Arizona road trip if you don’t visit the Grand Canyon? I think not. The south rim of Grand Canyon National Park is a little over 2-hours drive north of Sedona and makes a fantastic day trip.\n\nThe route along scenic Highway 180 is recommended for the wide variety of landscapes, ranging from towering mountains and massive pine forests to wide-open, high desert plains with Pinon Pines. Parts of this road can get busy and are limited to single-lane sections with limited passing opportunities, so be prepared to relax and enjoy the scenery.\n\nIf you’re not looking to drive yourself, you can opt to take a Small Group Tour From Sedona to the Grand Canyon.\n\nAnother option is to take the train from Williams, Arizona to the Grand Canyon. Train carriages dating back to 1901 have been restored to their original glory and offer riders a scenic trip through the forested areas and desert plains of Arizona winding through the countryside and ending up at the South Rim railway station. For tickets and more information head to Grand Canyon Railway Train Tickets.\n\nSeven Sacred Pools Sedona\n\nIf you’re into spirituality and mysticism and you’re a fully able-bodied person, then the Seven Sacred pools are a must-see stop on your Sedona road trip. I’m actually none of these things, but I’m including them on my list as they’re a fairly famous Sedona landmark. Unfortunately, The Seven Sacred Pools are only accessible via Soldiers Pass Trail, a 2 1/2 mile hike that takes about an hour and twenty minutes to complete. Sadly, as I am in no physical condition to hike Soldier Pass, I have to admire the pools in photos and videos.\n\nThe Seven Sacred Pools are a series of natural pools that descend down the red rocks. They were considered sacred by the Apaches and Yavapai and provided drinking water year-round in a barren desert. They’re now popular with many seeking spiritual enlightenment.\n\nCathedral Rock\n\nCathedral Rock is another site that’s fortunately fairly visible from Sedona scenic route 179. To drive to this rock formation is next to impossible as the road is generally closed to everyone but shuttles. The parking lot fills up as early as 6:30 am. But fear not! You can grab one of the trailhead shuttles serving Cathedral Rock and Little Horse from the North State Route 179 park and ride lot located at 1294 State Route 179. Just know that you will need to obtain a Red Rock Pass to visit the site.\n\nAgain, hiking isn’t my thing given my mobility issues, but if you’re interested in hiking Cathedral Rock, know that it’s a 1.2-mile hike round trip. It’s also one of the one of the most popular hikes in Sedona, so expect crowds. The total ascent is 700 feet, giving it a moderate level of difficulty. The total length of time to hike Cathedral Rock is 1 to 2 hours.\n\nOak Creek Canyon\n\nOak Creek Canyon in the Sedona Verde Valley is an 8-minute scenic drive north of Sedona on State Route 89A. Known for its colorful rocks and unique formations, the canyon is famous for its picturesque scenery and is known as the smaller cousin of the Grand Canyon.\n\nThis spectacular 16-mile gorge offers streams and beautiful waterfalls between sheer rock walls. State Route 89 A enters the canyon on its north end and snakes through a series of winding curves for 13 miles before emptying out in the town of Sedona.\n\nThe depth of the canyon ranges from 800 to 2,000 feet. Oak Creek, a tributary of the Verde River flows through the bottom of the canyon.\n\nIf you’re driving to Sedona from the north you will have to pass through Oak Creek Canyon. I would strongly advise doing so during daylight hours as the turns can be quite hairpin and as of this writing, the road was under construction, adding an extra level of difficulty when driving.\n\nDry Creek Road\n\nA relatively short, partly paved loop just off State Route 89A provides access to the area, taking you past trails, canyons, and expansive mountain vistas. Word of warning, because this road is only partially paved, it does have a small stretch that is bumpy and can be uncomfortable for low-slung cars.\n\nA popular start to this drive is breakfast at Coffee Pot Restaurant, located at 2050 W. State Route 89A. This tasty breakfast spot gets its name from the rock formation directly behind the restaurant which looks like an old-fashioned percolator.\n\nLike other scenic drives in Sedona, there are several hiking locations located nearby. The most popular along Dry Creek Road is Devil’s Bridge. This hike is a little less than a mile with a gain of about 400 feet in elevation. The trail is rated as fairly easy."
