We at the Labor Center teach workers about the rights that have been won. One of our goals is to ensure that each worker has access to good tools to learn about their rights at work, how to protect those rights, and what resources are available to help.\n\nThis 5th Edition of the Workers Rights Manual has a new focus–the five basic rights that all workers should enjoy at their workplaces. There are literally hundreds of laws affecting employment and work, enforced (or not enforced) by local, state and federal government agencies. Most of them fall under one of the five categories this manual highlights:\n\nthe right to be paid\n\nthe right to care for yourself and your family\n\nthe right to be free of discrimination\n\nthe right to be safe at work\n\nthe right to organize\n\nIn addition, we have tried to make information on workers’ rights easier to access and easier to use. By using this new framework, and by moving the manual to a mobile- friendly website, we can help ensure that this information travels far and wide\n\nOn behalf of the Labor Center and our community and labor partners, we thank working people worldwide and throughout history who fight and sacrifice for the rights of us all.\n\nAdair Dammann, Director\n\nWashington State Labor Education and Research Center\n\nSouth Seattle College\n\nChapter 1: Your Right to Be Paid\n\nThis Chapter covers the minimum wage, tips, prevailing wage, overtime, rest breaks, benefits, firing and unemployment, and laws covering special groups and situations.\n\n1.1 Minimum Wage\n\nSummary\n\nWashington’s 2024 minimum wage is $16.28 per hour. 14- and 15-year-olds may be paid 85% of the minimum wage - $13.84 an hour. Additional exemptions from the minimum wage exist for in-training employees (85%), student learners/workers (75%) and apprentices however employers must receive permission from the Washington Department of Labor and Industries (L&I) and meet additional criteria.\n\nThe minimum wage is the minimum amount an employer can pay you for each hour that you work, are being trained, are required to stay at the worksite, or commute between worksites on a single job. Washington’s minimum wage law covers almost all workers in both agricultural and non-agricultural jobs, and covers both documented and undocumented workers.\n\nRaising the Bar! These cities and counties offer higher minimum wages under many circumstances:\n\nSeaTac - The living wage rate in effect for hospitality and transportation industry employees within the City of SeaTac, including SeaTac Airport, is $19.71 per hour and will increase again in 2025 based on cost of living.\n\nSeattle - Seattle’s 2024 minimum wage is $19.97 per hour. A lower minimum wage of $17.25 can be paid at employers with 500 or fewer workers that pay at least $2.72 an hour towards a medical benefits plan or if the employee makes at least $2.72 an hour in tips.\n\nTukwila - Large employers (500+ employees worldwide including franchises) must pay at least $20.29 per hour. Mid-size employers (15 - 500 employees worldwide OR gross revenue over $2 million) must pay at least $19.29 an hour. More info here.\n\nRenton - Large employers (500+ employees worldwide including franchises) must pay at least $20.29 per hour. Mid-size employers (15 - 500 employees worldwide OR gross revenue over $2 million) must pay at least $18.29 an hour. More info here.\n\nMinimum Wage for Uber and Lyft Drivers\n\nWashington State's TNC (Transportation Network Company) Drivers' rights law was adopted in 2023. The law requires TNCs like Uber and Lyft to pay a minimum per mile and per minute rate (including a minimum trip rate). The law also provides drivers the right to paid sick time, workers' compensation and retaliation protections. More info here.\n\nper minute per mile minimum per trip Seattle trips $0.66 $1.55 $5.81 Outside of Seattle $0.38 $1.31 $3.37\n\nRaising the Bar! App-Based Worker Minimum Payment\n\nApp-Based workers in Seattle are provided a minimum payment for time worked and miles driven. This applies to Apps that belong to \"Network Companies\". Workers are entitled to a minimum of $0.44 a minute AND $0.74 a mile OR $5 for the combined time and mileage, whichever is more. See more here.\n\nFAQs: Minimum Wage\n\nMy employer says they only have to pay me the federal minimum wage. Is that true?\n\nNo. If there are differences between federal, state, or city minimum wages, your employer must pay you the highest wage that applies. Since Washington's minimum wage is higher than the federal minimum wage, almost all employees have a right to be paid the higher Washington State wage.\n\nIf my employer changes my shift at the last minute, do they have to pay me extra?\n\nDepends on what city you work in. In Seattle, very large retail and food businesses must provide extra pay for schedule changes or to work shifts less than 10 hours apart (see the Secure Scheduling section of the Seattle Labor Standards ordinance). Outside of Seattle, an employer is not required by law to give you advance notice about your shift changing, or pay extra if they make your shift longer or shorter however if you have a union at work, you contract may provide for this.\n\nCan my employer ask me to work off the clock?\n\nIt is illegal for your employer to not pay you the minimum wage, or ask you to work “off-the-clock” (without pay). Employers must pay employees for all “hours worked.” “Hours worked” means all work requested, permitted, or allowed while on duty at the workplace, and includes travel time, training and meeting time, wait time, on-call time, preparatory and concluding time, and may include meal periods.\n\nLearn More: Minimum Wage\n\nFor general information on the state minimum wage, see WA Labor and Industries Minimum Wage page (https://lni.wa.gov/workers-rights/wages/minimum-wage/index).\n\nThe minimum wage does not cover true independent contractors, but employers can’t avoid paying minimum wage by labeling a worker as an “independent contractor” unless they meet all the legal tests. There are also minimum wage exemptions for some types of workers, including some workers with disabilities, those in on-the-job training programs, student workers and students in job training and apprentices. For more details on who’s covered by the minimum wage, see L&I’s policy on Minimum Wage Applicability https://lni.wa.gov/workers-rights/_docs/esa1.pdf?utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery\n\nMinimum Wage Resources:\n\nIf your employer does not pay you the correct minimum wage, you can contact the Washington State Department of Labor and Industries’ (L&I) employment standards office at (360) 902-5316 or toll-free at 1 (866) 219-7321 to report your employer or file a complaint. Interpreter services are available.\n\nIf you work in the City of Seattle and believe that your wages are not correct, visit the Office of Labor Standards (https://www.seattle.gov/laborstandards) office to get more information and to file an anonymous claim. The City of SeaTac also enforces its own minimum wage law.\n\n1.2 Tips & Service Charges\n\nIn Washington State, employers must pay employees all tips, gratuities and service charges added to the customer’s bill, unless the bill says otherwise. Your employer is not allowed to count tips and service charges as part of your minimum wage payment. A valid tip pool cannot include an owner or manager. For more details, see Washington’s Department of Labor and Industries (L&I) “Tips, Gratuities and Service Charges, (https://lni.wa.gov/workers-rights/wages/tips-and-service-charges).\n\nFAQs: Tips and Service Charges\n\nAre mandatory tip pools (required by the employer) allowed?\n\nState law does not prohibit a tip pool amongst employees established by an employer. A tip pool established by an employer may not include individuals who are exempt from the definition of “employee” under Washington Statute RCW 49.46.010(3), such as managerial or supervisory workers, executive, administrative, or professional employees.\n\nWhat are the requirements for service charges?\n\nService charges are a type of automatic charge added to a customer’s bill for services related to food, beverages, entertainment, or porterage. Employers must disclose the percentage of the service charge that is paid to the employee or employees serving the customer. This information must appear in an itemized receipt and in any menu provided to the customer. If any portion of a service charge is not clearly designated as being retained by the employer, it is due to the employee or employees serving the customer.\n\nHow soon after they are received must the employer pay tips, gratuities, and the employee portion of a service charge to their employees?\n\nCash tips and gratuities (or the share of tips and gratuities due to the employee from a pool), or the employee portion of a service charge received in cash, may be retained by the employee. If received by the employer (for instance, tips paid by credit card), the employer must pay tips, gratuities, and the employee portion of a service charge to the employee no later than wages earned in the same period are paid.\n\n1.3 Overtime\n\nSummary\n\nIn most industries, you must be paid 1.5 times your regular rate of pay for all hours that you work over 40 in a seven-day workweek. For example, if you regularly earn $20 per hour and work 45 hours in one week, your pay rate would be $30 per hour for 5 hours of overtime.\n\nFAQs: Overtime\n\nDo all workers qualify for overtime?\n\nMost employees are eligible for overtime pay after 40 hours in a work week including farm and dairy workers. Workers who live at their workplace, certain salaried employees, and true independent contractors are not legally required to be paid overtime. Sometimes, employers use the words “exempt” and “non-exempt” when referring to whether an employee is entitled to overtime. For more information call the Department of Labor and Industries at: (866)219-7321, or see:​ https://lni.wa.gov/workers-rights/wages/overtime/\n\nDo I Still Get Overtime If I Choose To Take An Extra Shift?\n\nYes. Even if you volunteer to take an extra shift or trade a shift, your employer still has to pay you overtime for all hours that you work over 40 in a week. Your employer can’t have a policy that says you don’t get paid overtime unless it is approved or scheduled in advance.\n\nCan My Employer Make Me Work Overtime?\n\nYes. Most employers can make you work overtime even if you don’t want to, and even on a day that you usually have off. See the exception for some healthcare workers further below.\n\nWhat About Agreements To Take Time Off Later Instead Of Overtime Pay?\n\nIf you work for a public agency, you can request time off at a later time instead of being paid overtime wages in the pay period when you worked the overtime hours. This is sometimes called \"comp time\" or \"exchange time.\"\n\nWhen you take the time off, it must be at the rate of at least 1.5 hours for each overtime hour worked.\n\nComp or exchange time must be at your request\n\nIf you do not use your comp time within the year, it must be paid out (cashed out) at the overtime rate.\n\nHealth Care Workers Overtime\n\nHealthcare workers employed by a healthcare facility and involved in direct patient care in the following job classifications are protected from mandatory overtime in some instances and given the right to rest for at least eight hours when working more than 12 consecutive hours:\n\nLicensed Practical Nurses (LPNs), Registered Nurses (RNs), Surgical Technologist, Diagnostic Radiologic Technologist, Cardiovascular Invasive Specialist, Respiratory Care Practitioner, and Certified Nursing Assistants. Employees must also be paid an hourly wage or covered by a union contract (collective bargaining agreement).\n\nThere are four exceptions when an employer can mandate overtime, including Unforeseeable Emergent Circumstance, Patient in Progress, Prescheduled on-call time and Reasonable Efforts.

Farm/Agricultural Workers Overtime\n\nFarm workers won a historic victory in 2021 with passage of a law phasing in overtime pay in Washington over the course of three years. Washington is now the first state in the nation to provide all farm workers the right to overtime after a 40-hour workweek. Dairy workers are also eligible\n\nWorkers in Executive, Administrative and Professional Roles\n\nWashington State is raising the minimum salary for workers exempted from overtime who primarily perform “executive, administrative, and professional” (EAP) duties each year until 2028.\n\nFor 2024 you must earn more than $1,302.40 a week to be denied overtime pay even if your employer claims you are \"exempt\". There are also changes in the thresholds for exempt computer professionals paid by the hour.\n\nFind more information on the Washington State EAP changes here: https://www.lni.wa.gov/workers-rights/wages/overtime/changes-to-overtime-rules\n\nLearn More: Overtime\n\nYour employer is not required by law to pay you overtime to work on a holiday or weekend, but some employment and union contracts do include that.\n\nOvertime laws do not cover true independent contractors, but employers can’t avoid paying overtime by labeling a worker as an “independent contractor” unless they meet all the legal tests.\n\nIf you are called an “exempt” employee, it means that your employer has determined that you are not entitled to overtime.\n\n1.4 Prevailing Wage\n\nPrevailing wage is the hourly wage, expected benefits and overtime rates paid to the majority of workers employed on government construction projects in the largest city in each county in Washington State. Prevailing wage laws say that if the federal government or Washington State is funding your construction job, you must be paid the prevailing wage. You can look up the prevailing wage for your county and trade at: https://lni.wa.gov/licensing-permits/public-works-projects/workers\n\n1.5 Rest Breaks\n\nSummary\n\nIn Washington, most workers are entitled to rest breaks.\n\nRest Break Meal Break: Paid or Unpaid Breast-feeding Break How long? 10 min. 30 min. As long as needed How often? Every 4 hours worked 1 for less than 11 hours total worked. 2 for more than 11 hours worked. As frequently as needed Is it paid? Yes Employer’s choice No Can it be split up? Sometimes\n\nPaid: yes\n\nUnpaid: No\n\nN/A Can you choose not to take it? No Yes Yes\n\nDomestic Workers rest rights in Seattle:\n\nDomestic workers in Seattle, both employees and independent contractors – working in private homes as a nanny, house cleaner, home care worker, gardener, cook, and/or household manager, have the following rights to rest breaks:\n\nA 30-minute uninterrupted meal break if you work for more than five hours in a shift in the same home\n\nA 10-minute uninterrupted rest break for every four hours of work in the same home\n\nIf you can’t take a break, your employer must provide additional pay for the missed break\n\nIf you are a live-in caregiver, you must receive a day of rest after working more than six days in a row\n\nRaising the Bar ! New Meal and rest period rules for healthcare facility workers\n\nA recent Washington law gives many health care facility employees more certain rules on meal and rest periods. The law covers most hourly and union employees involved in direct patient care.\n\nMeal and rest periods must be scheduled and uninterrupted unless there is an unforeseeable emergent circumstance, or a situation that could lead to an adverse effect on a patient.\n\nInterrupted rest breaks must include an additional 10 minutes of uninterrupted time and be given as early as possible.\n\nEmployer must record all missed meal or rest periods and keep these records on file.\n\nFor more details visit L&I webpage on Mandatory Nurse’s Overtime and Rest Breaks: https://lni.wa.gov/workers-rights/wages/overtime/mandatory-nurses-overtime\n\n1.6 Pay Periods, Pay Statements, Paycheck Deductions and Benefits\n\nSummary\n\nYou must be paid at least once a month on a regularly scheduled payday. When you leave your job, your employer must pay you for all unpaid wages no later than the end of the next regular pay period. Each time you are paid, you must receive a written statement from your employer (usually a paycheck stub) that includes information about the pay period, hours of work, rate of pay and any deductions.\n\nWashington requires employers to keep payroll records for at least three years, and employees have the right to request copies of these records. For more info on payroll records and pay stubs, see the L&I Payroll and Personnel Records webpage: https://lni.wa.gov/workers-rights/workplace-policies/payroll-and-personnel-records\n\nDeductions from your pay are only legal if they are required or permitted by federal or state law or if you agree to them in advance. All deductions from your paycheck must be listed and explained on your paycheck stub. These deductions can include things like taxes, Social Security and Medicare, insurance, garnishments and union dues.\n\nYour employer cannot deduct:\n\nPayments for loans, housing, transportation, tools or food without your permission.\n\nPayments, even with your permission, if they reduce your wages to below the minimum wage, or if the company makes a profit from selling you these things.\n\nMoney for unemployment compensation.\n\nMoney to pay for equipment that you accidentally lost or broke.\n\nMoney to cover a cash register shortage – except during your final pay period and only if your employer can prove that you participated in counting the register before and after your shift and you were the only person using it.\n\nTIP: You should keep your own records of the hours you have worked and what you believe you should be paid. This can help you if you ever need to file a wage theft claim.\n\nBenefits\n\nCommon benefits include health insurance, pension, 401K and other retirement plans, vacation leave, paid sick leave, paid maternity leave, childcare, club memberships and bonuses. An employer offers these in addition to wages or salary. Paid sick leave is now required under Washington state and Seattle laws. Otherwise, benefits are usually optional unless your employment contract requires them or a city ordinance requires them.\n\nNew! Seattle Transit Benefit - Seattle businesses with more than 20 employees must offer all employees a pre-tax payroll deduction for transit or van-pool expenses. The ordinance encourages commuters to use transit to reduce traffic and carbon emissions. Because the deduction is pre-tax, the law has the added benefit of lowering the tax bills for both workers and businesses. Employers offering full or partially-paid transit passes are exempt from this requirement. For more info, see Seattle OLS’s Commuter Benefits webpage: https://www.seattle.gov/laborstandards/ordinances/commuter-benefits\n\nFAQs: Pay Deductions\n\nWhat About Uniforms and Personal Protection Equipment and Clothing? What Does My Employer Have To Pay For?\n\nClothing that has an uncommon color, function, style or has a logo – i.e. is unusual in some way (like a cowboy hat, for instance), is usually considered a uniform and your employer has to pay for them. Your employer may not take money from your wages or require a deposit from you for your uniform. Some required clothing is not considered a uniform and you might have to pay for it. For instance, it is not considered a uniform if you are required to wear common colors for tops and bottoms, like a white top and black pants. For more information see this L&I website: www.lni.wa.gov/workers-rights/workplace-policies/uniforms For jobs where you could be injured, your employer is generally required to provide, free of cost to you, safety equipment such as protective gloves, helmets, goggles, and other clothing to protect you from injury or sickness on the job.\n\n1.7 Agricultural Workers - Special Wage and Hour Laws\n\nAgricultural work includes growing, producing and harvesting farm, nursery, or forest products as well as working with livestock, bees, sheep, goats, poultry or wildlife. It could be migrant or seasonal work, or it may be year-round.\n\nMinimum Wage and Agricultural Workers\n\nIf you are an agricultural worker your employer may pay you on a piece rate basis or salary basis, but that rate must equal the minimum hourly wage of $16.28 in Washington State in 2024.\n\nThere are a few limited exceptions when agricultural workers do not have to be paid the minimum wage. For information on these exceptions and other agricultural workers rights see: https://lni.wa.gov/workers-rights/agriculture-policies/wages\n\nA new 2021 law expands overtime pay protections to all agriculture workers and will be phased in starting in 2022. See Overtime section 1.3 above.\n\nBreaks\n\nAgricultural workers have the right to the same breaks as non-agricultural workers:\n\nOne 10-minute paid rest break for every four hours worked.\n\nOne paid or unpaid 30-minute meal break if working more than five hours in a day.\n\nOne additional 30-minute meal break if working 11 or more hours in a day.\n\nAgricultural Work Recruiting Rights (Migrant & Seasonal Workers)\n\nIf you are recruited (hired) to do seasonal agricultural work away from home, you have rights guaranteed by the federal Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act. As soon as you agree to work for your employer, s/he must give you written information in your native language about your workplace, wage, crop, duration of job, housing, transportation, benefits, and whether there is a strike or work stoppage at the farm where you will work.\n\nAgricultural Workers under Age 18\n\nTo protect agricultural workers under age 18, there are special rules about work hours and what tasks you can perform. Please see Chapter 6.4 for more information.\n\nLegal Resources\n\nIf you are a low income agricultural worker and need legal help, contact Columbia Legal Services (https://columbialegal.org/) or call 888-201-1014.\n\n1.8 Firing and Other Terminations\n\nSummary\n\nIf you’ve been fired, was it for a legal reason? Most non-union private sector workers are employed “at-will,” meaning that the employer can fire you for almost any, or no reason at all. However, most public sector (government agency) employees and most union workers cannot be fired unless their employer has followed certain procedures and/or can show they have a good reason to fire you.\n\nWhether you are employed “at-will” or not, you cannot be fired for discriminatory reasons, retaliation for whistleblowing or filing a formal claim defending your workplace rights, or for concerted activity.\n\nThere are some important exceptions to these rules. Organizing and forming a union are not protected rights for all farm workers, domestic workers, independent contractors, supervisors (if they have the power to hire and fire employees), and confidential workers.\n\nDid My Boss Have The Right To Fire Me?\n\nIn general, it is illegal to fire you:\n\nFor organizing with other workers to try to improve working conditions, in person or online.\n\nFor joining or forming a union with your co-workers, or for union membership or support.\n\nFor filing a health, safety or other official complaint or advocating for other workplace rights.\n\nIn Washington State because of your age, ancestry, citizenship status (if you are legally allowed to work in the United States), color, creed, disability, gender identity, genetic information, military status, national origin, political ideology, race, religion, sex, pregnancy, or sexual orientation.\n\nFor refusing to give your employer your username and/or password to social media sites.\n\nIf you think your employer discriminated when firing you, you should file a complaint as soon as possible. Please see Chapter 3: Discrimination for information on filing a complaint. If you are in a union, check with your steward or representative about the discipline and dismissal process. If you work in the public sector, check with an attorney or your employer’s human resources department about dismissal rules.\n\nFAQ's: Firing\n\nWhen should I receive my final paycheck?\n\nYour employer must pay you for all unpaid work hours in your last paycheck on your next regularly scheduled payday. Your employer cannot withhold your paycheck, for example, until you turn in your keys or uniform. If your employer does not pay you for any hours that you have worked, they are breaking the law.\n\nLearn More: Firing and Terminations\n\nIf you quit because your working conditions were beyond what any reasonable person would tolerate, it may be considered a good cause. Before you quit, it’s a good idea to talk to an attorney, your union representative, or the ESD about whether your reason for quitting might qualify as good cause.\n\nIf you were fired through no fault of your own, such as not having the skills to do the job, you may be eligible for unemployment benefits. If we decide you were fired or suspended for misconduct or gross misconduct, you will not qualify for unemployment benefits. See ESD rules here: https://esd.wa.gov/unemployment/laid-off-or-fired\n\nNon-Compete Clauses in Employment Agreements\n\n\"Non-compete” agreements prohibit workers from joining or starting competing businesses, usually within set time periods or regions. These agreements currently cover approximately one out of every five workers, including 14% of workers earning less than $40,000 a year. While they are more common in high-skill jobs, they can be found across all occupations, industries, and income levels, including retail, hair styling and fast food.\n\nA non-compete clause or non-compete agreement is only enforceable in Washington where the employee is earning more than $116,593 per year ($291,482 for independent contractors). The minimum salary thresholds are also tied to inflation with new levels calculated each year. These amounts are as of January 1, 2023.\n\nAny worker with a current non-compete agreement earning less than the above limit is not bound and the agreement is not enforceable. Employers must also disclose the terms of the non-compete in writing prior to or at the same time the employee accepts an offer.\n\nEmployees who make less than $31.48 an hour (twice the state minimum wage for most workers in 2023) have the right to supplement their income by having a 2nd job, starting their own business or working as an independent contractor. There are some exceptions to this for reasons of safety and reasonable scheduling expectations by employers.\n\nPerformers (musicians and entertainers) are protected from non-compete agreements longer than three calendar days. This applies to bookings made by a performance space and those made by a third party.\n\nLearn more about Washington's non-competition agreement law here: https://lni.wa.gov/workers-rights/workplace-policies/non-compete-agreements\n\n1.9 Unemployment\n\nUnemployment Insurance (UI) is a program managed by WA State that gives payments to qualified people who lose their jobs through no fault of their own. These payments should help you pay your bills until you find a new job. To receive UI payments, you must file a weekly claim. For detailed information on Unemployment Insurance, read on and visit the Washington State Employment Security Department’s homepage: https://esd.wa.gov/unemployment\n\nFAQ's Unemployment\n\nDo I qualify for Unemployment Insurance (UI)?\n\nGenerally, you qualify for unemployment benefits if:\n\nYou lose your job through no fault of your own.\n\nYou worked at least 680 hours (about 1/3 of a year, full time) the previous year.\n\nYou have documentation that allows you to work legally in the USA.\n\nYou were laid off or your hours were reduced due to lack of work.\n\nYou are physically and mentally able to work.\n\nYou are available for and actively seeking a new job.\n\nSpecial circumstances may also qualify a person for unemployment insurance benefits. These include: domestic violence or stalking victims who voluntarily quit to protect themselves or their families; some situations where people voluntarily quit because their spouses are transferred; and union workers who are not working because of a lockout during contract negotiations.\n\nWhat if I quit my job?\n\nYou still may be able to receive unemployment insurance if you had a legally recognized \"good cause\" reason to quit under extremely difficult circumstances. There is also a list of “good-cause” reasons in the Handbook for Unemployed workers from the Washington State Employment Security Department (ESD). https://esd.wa.gov/unemployment\n\nWho Does Not Qualify for Unemployment Benefits?\n\nPeople working in these situations are probably not eligible for benefits:\n\nIndependent contractors (See Learn More section for details)\n\nIndependent salespeople who work on commission away from their employer’s office location.\n\nSchool employees in between terms.\n\nUnion members on strike, or union members honoring another union’s strike.\n\nElected government officials.\n\nChurch employees.\n\nAmateur sports officials, like umpires and referees.\n\nWork-study students.\n\nLicensed real-estate agents, brokers and investment company agents.\n\nTravel agents paid on commission.\n\nLearn More: Unemployment\n\nGood Cause\n\nIf you quit because your working conditions were beyond what any reasonable person would tolerate, it may be considered a good cause. Before you quit, it’s a good idea to talk to an attorney, your union representative, or the ESD about whether your reason for quitting might qualify as good cause.\n\nIf you were fired through no fault of your own, such as not having the skills to do the job, you may be eligible for unemployment benefits. If we decide you were fired or suspended for misconduct or gross misconduct, you will not qualify for unemployment benefits. See ESD rules here: https://esd.wa.gov/unemployment/laid-off-or-fired\n\nIndependent Contractors\n\nWhile independent contractors do not quality for unemployment (you may be able to opt-in), employers can’t avoid paying unemployment by labeling a worker as an “independent contractor” unless they meet ESD’s tests of a true independent contractor. See this ESD information page: https://esd.wa.gov/employer-taxes/independent-contractors\n\nApplying For Unemployment Insurance Benefits\n\nYou should apply for UI as soon as you are laid off or your hours are reduced. You can apply by calling the Unemployment Claims Center at (800) 318-6022 (TTY 800-365-8969). Instructions will be available in many different languages. You can also apply for benefits online at the ESD website. If you do not have access to a computer or telephone, you can use the telephones and computers available at WorkSource Offices.\n\nFor every week that you claim benefits, you must apply for at least three jobs or attend one WorkSource workshop and keep a record of it.\n\nHow Much Money Will I Receive?\n\nThe amount you are eligible to receive does not depend on financial need. It depends on your previous earnings. You can ask for a written estimate of your benefits by calling Unemployment (800) 318-6022.\n\nThere is also an online calculator tool that you can use to calculate your possible benefits. Unemployment benefits are considered taxable income. You may choose to have 10 percent of your weekly benefits deducted for income taxes purposes.\n\nDisagreements and Problems\n\nIf you and your employer disagree over whether you qualify for unemployment insurance, the ESD will ask for information from both of you about what happened when your job ended and decides whether you qualify. The eligibility rules are complicated, and you should contact Unemployment at (800) 318-6022 about your situation.\n\nIf you disagree with any ESD decision on your unemployment benefits, you have the right to appeal based on fairness. You can appeal by writing a letter to the ESD telling them you would like to appeal. You can expect that an appeal will take months to be decided. Make sure you continue to file weekly claims during your appeal! If you win your appeal, you will only be paid for the weeks that you filed a claim.\n\nSharedWork Program\n\nWashington’s SharedWork program allows a business to avoid layoffs by reducing an employee’s hours and the employee can qualify for partial wage replacement through the state unemployment system for those reduced hours. This helps employers retain trained workers reduce payroll, and enables employees to keep their jobs and benefits with minimal loss of income until the economy recovers. SharedWork can also help workers who need reduced work hours to care for children temporarily at home. For more info, visit the SharedWork website.\n\nOther Resources\n\nYou can contact an attorney for help or the Unemployment Law Project – (206) 441-9178 or (888) 441-9178 – if you are a low-income Washington State resident and your claim is denied.\n\nDislocated Workers and Retraining\n\nIf you lose your job, there are programs that can help you learn new skills to enter a different field. These programs may include paid or unpaid training for a new job, financial help with relocation to an area where there are more jobs, and assistance in your job search.\n\nWorkSource\n\nDepending on the type of job you had or where you live, resources for people who are searching for a new job will be different. After you apply for unemployment benefits, you can find out more about available programs at WorkSource. WorkSource has offices all around the state and can assist with your job search and help you understand and apply for retraining programs.\n\nFor information on WorkSource services and office locations visit the WorkSource website or call (888) 316-5627.\n\nFarm Worker Job Training\n\nThe Opportunities Industrialization Center (OIC) offers services to help eligible farm workers in Ellensburg, Moses Lake, Mount Vernon, Pasco, Sunnyside, Wenatchee and Yakima develop skills, or train for permanent year-round employment outside agriculture. This program also provides educational services for preschool-aged children. For more information contact the Yakima office or visit the OIC website to find more office locations and contact information.\n\nYakima OIC: (509) 248-6751 Address – 815 Fruitvale Blvd., Yakima, WA 98902\n\nWashington State Labor Council Direct Worker Assistance\n\nThe Washington State Labor Council offers services to dislocated and unemployed workers under the federal Workforce Investment Act (WIA). They offer help during plant closures to make sure that workers have access to job re-training and re-employment programs. They also help with applying for unemployment and other benefits for working families. Visit the WSLC’s Direct Worker Service website or call (360)-357-8736.\n\n1.10 Raising the Bar! Seattle’s Secure Scheduling\n\nSummary\n\nSeattle’s Secure Scheduling Law was written to encourage predictable schedules at work. Some aspects of the law require extra pay for workers who are asked to work more or fewer hours than they were scheduled for, or to work a “clopening” without sufficient rest between shifts.\n\nThe law applies to:\n\nRetail and food service establishments with 500+ employees worldwide\n\nFull-service restaurants with 500+ employees and 40+ full-service restaurant locations\n\nworldwide\n\nIf you work for a qualifying business, your employer MUST:\n\nPost your schedule 14 days in advance\n\nProvide extra pay for changes made to the posted schedule (except for shift swaps you request)\n\nLet you decline closing and opening shifts that are less than 10 hours apart, and if you choose to work it, they must pay you time-and-a-half for any hours worked that are separated by less than 10 hours.\n\nOffer extra hours to current employees before hiring new employees\n\nProvide you with an estimated number of hours you can expect to work over the coming year\n\nGrant scheduling requests made before the work schedule is posted if it is for reasons related to a major life event (employee’s transportation, housing, other job(s), education, caregiving, and self-care for serious health condition), unless it would cause the employer significant cost or disruption (as defined in the ordinance).\n\nTo learn more about your right to Secure Scheduling in Seattle, go to the Office of Labor Standards website: https://www.seattle.gov/laborstandards/ordinances/secure-scheduling\n\n1.11 Raising the Bar! Renton and Tukwila Fair Access to Additional Hours of Work\n\nStarting January 1st in Tukwila and July 1st in Renton, employers with more than 15 employees or over $2 million in gross sales in either city must offer additional hours to qualified part-time employees before hiring new employees including the use of subcontractors or a temp agency. Part-time is defined as anyone working less than 35 hours a week.\n\nThe additional hours do not need to be in the employee’s same job classification; the employee just needs to be qualified to do the work based on their skills and experience. Employers must establish a fair process for determining whether employees are “qualified” including documenting how they made their decisions.\n\nEmployers also don’t have to offer additional hours if the extra hours would put the employee in overtime (over 40 hours in a week) or cause the employee to receive a shift differential or other premium pay under a union contract or employer policy.\n\nFor more information see the city of Renton and Tukwila’s websites.\n\n1.12 What If My Employer Did Not Pay Me What I'm Owed?\n\nSummary\n\nWhen your employer does not pay you the correct amount that is called wage theft. Wage theft is illegal.\n\nWage theft includes:\n\nNot paying you for all the hours you work\n\nNot paying you your last paycheck after you leave a job\n\nNot paying you overtime\n\nNot allowing you to take your paid rest break paying you extra for missed breaks\n\nForcing you to work “off the clock”\n\nNot paying minimum wage\n\nNot paying you the amount you agreed upon\n\nStealing your tips or your portion of a service charge\n\nIllegally deducting business expenses from your paycheck\n\nNext Steps:\n\nIf you think it’s possible that you have not been getting paid what you earned, here are some options:\n\nContact your Union Representative, the WA State Department of Labor and Industries (L&I), or your local Wage & Hour Enforcement Agency;\n\nTalk with a Community Group;\n\nTake Your Employer to Court for Unpaid Wages;\n\nFile a Lien (a legal claim) against any property owned by your employer.\n\nFor more details on next steps, see Learn More section below.\n\nFAQs: Wage Theft\n\nHow do I prove my employer is stealing from me?\n\nIt is important that you keep records about your employer and your work (schedule, tips earned, overtime, etc.). Your records are evidence in a claim for unpaid wages. If your employer doesn’t keep a record of your work, a judge or government investigator will rely on the records you keep as evidence.\n\nLearn More: Wage Theft\n\nSpecial Cases – Am I an employee?\n\nLaws affecting your Right to be Paid depend on your employment status (whether you are labeled as an “employee.” See Chapter 8 Am I an Employee?\n\nWho Can Help?\n\n1. Contact Your Union\n\nIf you are a member of a labor union at work, your first step should be to contact your Union Representative to file a grievance for the legal/contract violation.\n\n2. Go through the Labor and Industries Wage Complaint Process\n\nThe Washington State Wage Payment Act gives Labor and Industries (L&I) the power to help you get paid what you are owed. You can file a “Workplace Rights Complaint” with L&I, and they will investigate. If they decide that your employer owes you money, they can make him/her pay you. The L&I process is free and most complaints are investigated in 60 days or fewer. For more information and to file a complaint, see: www.lni.wa.gov/Workers-rights/workplace-complaints/worker-rights-complaints. You can also call the L&I at (360) 902-5316 or toll-free at (866) 219-7321 to report your employer or file a complaint. Interpreter services are available. Employees are protected from retaliation for exercising their rights under the Minimum Wage Requirements and Labor Standards Act. This includes filing a complaint for wages owed or exercising protected rights.\n\n3. Take Your Employer to Court for Unpaid Wages\n\nYou can go to small claims court yourself, or hire a lawyer to help you collect the money you are owed. A court can award you your unpaid wages, and the court may also order your employer to pay your lawyer’s fees. In court, you also may be able to win double the amount of wages owed if your employer failed to pay you on purpose. Information on going to small claims court can be found from the Attorney General’s Office: https://www.atg.wa.gov/small-claims-court-0\n\n4. If you work in Seattle, Tacoma or SeaTac, file a City Complaint\n\nIf you work in Seattle and believe that your wages are not correct or missing, you can visit the Office of Labor Standards website or office to get more information on your rights and to file an anonymous claim. The Cities of Tacoma and SeaTac also enforce their local minimum wage laws.\n\n5. Talk with a Community Group\n\nSome community groups help workers get unpaid wages through direct action. Examples are Casa Latina 206-956-0779 ext.122, http://casa-latina.org/, Fair Work Center 844-485-1195, http://fairworkcenter.org, or Seattle Solidarity Network 206-350-8650, http://seasol.net/. If you work in Seattle, you can also seek help through community-based organizations that partner with Seattle’s Community Education and Outreach program. https://www.seattle.gov/laborstandards/funding/community-outreach-and-education-fund/coef-current-recipients.\n\n6. File a Lien against Property Owned by Your Employer\n\nAs a last resort, Washington workers also have the option of filing a lien against their employer. A lien is a legal process that puts a “hold” on property (including crops) until your employer pays you. If you want to file a lien, you should contact a lawyer right away. For information on how to find a lawyer see the Resources section at the end of this manual. In 2021, Washington passed a new law allowing employees to file claims against property owned by employers for unpaid wages. View the text of the Washington Wage Recovery Act\n\nChapter 2: Your Right to Care for Yourself and Family\n\nThis Chapter covers Sick and Safe Leave, Family, Pregnancy and other Leaves, Work Injuries and Compensation, and Disability Programs.\n\n2.1 Paid Sick and Safe Leave\n\nSummary\n\nMost Washington employees including rideshare drivers (Lyft, Uber, etc) have the right to receive paid leave for sickness and safety needs. This includes part-time and seasonal workers. Employees earn paid sick leave at a minimum rate of 1 hour for every 40 hours worked, and paid sick leave must be paid at the hourly rate that the employee would have earned for the time during which the employee used paid sick leave.\n\nWorkers can use earned sick leave after 90 days of employment (90 hours for rideshare drivers), and can carry over up to 40 hours of unused sick leave into the following year. Many employees have improved upon these minimums through organizing a union at their workplace so check your union contract if you have one. These rates are a minimum and employers are free to offer more hours and allow for a larger carryover.\n\nWhen Can I Use Paid Sick and Safety Leave?\n\nIf you or a family members are sick, including mental health problems\n\nIf you or a family member need to see a doctor, therapist or other healthcare provider\n\nIf your child's school or childcare is closed and you need to provide childcare\n\nIf you or your family member is experiencing domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking (see Chapter 2.5 for details)\n\nIf your place of work is shut down by government order\n\nDuring a deactivation or other \"blocked\" status that keeps you from driving on a rideshare platform unless this is due to a verified allegation of sexual or physical assault\n\nFamily members include your: Spouse, Registered Domestic Partner, Grandparent, Grandchild, Sibling, Children and Parent. For children and parents this includes biological, adopted, foster, stepparent/child, anyone you are legally responsible for, or someone who was your legal guardian or their spouse or registered domestic partner and anyone who was legally responsible for you when you were a minor.\n\nCoronavirus and Paid Sick Leave\n\nWashington's Paid Sick Leave law allows employees to use their paid sick leave for most situations related to the Coronavirus, including:\n\nIf you think you may have been exposed to Coronavirus, or are experiencing symptoms or feeling ill\n\nIf you are caring for a family member with Coronavirus\n\nIf you or a family member have an appointment to receive the Coronavirus vaccine\n\nWashington's Paid Sick Leave law does not cover cases where the employer voluntarily closes the workplace (but the employer can voluntarily provide paid sick leave in this case). For more information, see L&I's Coronavirus Paid Sick Leave Q&A page.\n\nRaising the bar! Seattle's Paid Sick and Safe Leave\n\nSeattle has a stronger paid sick leave law that allows workers at larger employers (50+ employees) to carry over more leave into the next year, and the largest employers (250+ employees) must provide a leave hour for every 30 hours worked. See details at the City’s website (https://www.seattle.gov/laborstandards/ordinances/paid-sick-and-safe-time).\n\nApp-Based workers in Seattle who work for food delivery network companies with at least 250 app-based workers worldwide are also eligible for Paid Sick and Safe Time. Starting January 13, 2024, this will requirement will expand to all other app-based workers. Under this law drivers are eligible for one day of safe and sick leave for every 30 days worked in Seattle. See details here: https://www.seattle.gov/documents/Departments/LaborStandards/App-Based%20Worker%20Paid%20Sick%20and%20Safe%20Time.pdf\n\nThe City of SeaTac also has a sick leave provision (http://www.seatacwa.gov/our-city/employment-standards-ordinance) in its minimum wage law providing most transportation and hospitality workers access to paid sick time as soon as it is earned, and requires that unused sick leave be paid out to employees at the end of each year.\n\nTacoma has a paid sick leave law based on the state law (https://www.cityoftacoma.org/cms/one.aspx?pageId=75860) which includes salaried workers, rail workers and elected/appointed public officials. The Tacoma law also allows employees to use their sick leave for bereavement.\n\nLearn More: Paid Sick Leave\n\nUnionized construction workers get the same sick leave rights, but enforced through their union contracts.\n\nRetaliation Protection: Both State and local sick and safe leave laws also protect workers who might face retaliation for filing a complaint about using sick or safe leave. NOTE: Some employees may not have a right to paid sick leave because their jobs are exempt from the minimum wage law. Exemptions include doctors, lawyers, and dentists, and many salaried executive, administrative, professional, computer or outside sales workers.\n\nFor more info on exempt employees, please see the State’s Administrative Policy ES.A.1. https://lni.wa.gov/workers-rights/_docs/esa1.pdf\n\n2.2 Paid Family and Medical Leave\n\nSummary\n\nPaid Family and Medical Leave is a new benefit for employees in Washington. It provides paid time off when a serious health condition prevents you from working or when workers need time to care for a family member or a new child. Paid Family and Medical Leave is available to almost everyone working in Washington.\n\nFAQs: Paid Family and Medical Leave\n\nCan I use Paid Leave if I am sick with COVID-19?\n\nAs with any illness, to be eligible for paid medical leave, a healthcare provider must certify that you are unable to work due to a serious health condition. If your healthcare provider certifies your illness meets the definition of “serious health condition” and you are otherwise eligible, you can use Paid Family and Medical Leave for COVID-19 cases.\n\nWho Qualifies?\n\nYou are eligible if:\n\nYou’ve worked 820 hours (about 16 hours a week) in Washington during the qualifying period, which is about the last year.\n\nYou’ve experienced a qualifying event. Qualifying events include a serious health condition that prevents you from working, a new baby or child joining your family, and a family member’s serious illness or medical event. Family members include anyone residing in your home who depends on you (the employee) for care. Here are some examples:\n\nYou give birth to a baby, adopt a child or have a foster child placed with your family.\n\nYou are recovering from a major surgery, serious illness or injury.\n\nYou are receiving treatment for a chronic health condition like diabetes or epilepsy.\n\nYou are receiving inpatient treatment for substance abuse or for mental health.\n\nYou are taking care of a family member with a serious health condition.\n\nA family member is on active duty military service and you take time to join them during R&R.\n\nYou are not a federal employee, employed by an employer who has an approved exemption because paid family and medical leave benefits are provided through a voluntary plan, or covered by a collective bargaining agreement that hasn’t been opened or renegotiated since before October 19, 2017. If you’re self-employed or employed by a federally recognized tribe, you are not automatically eligible. Self-employed people and tribes need to opt in to receive paid leave.\n\nHow much time can I take?\n\nMost eligible employees can take up to 12 weeks of paid leave a year. If you give birth to a baby, you qualify for up to 16 weeks of paid leave. In some circumstances, you may qualify for up to 18 weeks. The leave does not have to be taken all at once.\n\nWhat benefit do I receive?\n\nWhile you’re out, you will receive payments from the state based on a percentage of your typical weekly earnings, up to $1,000 a week. The Employment Security Dept. (ESD) will have an online benefit calculator to estimate how much you will receive. https://paidleave.wa.gov/estimate-your-weekly-pay/\n\nIs my job protected when I use Paid Leave?\n\nIf you work for a company that employs more than 50 people in Washington, you have worked there for at least a year and for a total of 1,250 hours in the year immediately preceding leave, you are eligible for job protection. If you do not have job protection with Paid Family and Medical Leave there may be other local, state or federal laws that offer job protection or restoration for you. For pregnancy leaves, the Washington Law Against Discrimination (WLAD) provides disability leave and job protections if you work for an employer with 8 or more employees. See Section 2.4 Pregnancy and Parental Leave for more information. ​\n\nLearn More: Paid Family Leave\n\nHow Paid Family Leave Differs from Paid Sick days\n\nPaid Family and Medical Leave is for times when something major keeps you away from work for a longer period of time. Paid sick days are for short-term health conditions that keep you from working, typically for less than a week.\n\nWith Paid Family and Medical Leave, unless you welcomed a new child into your family, there is a seven-day waiting period before you can begin receiving your benefit. During this time, you can use paid sick days if you choose to.\n\nFor more information and to apply, visit the ESD Paid Leave website: https://paidleave.wa.gov/individuals-and-families/\n\nPaid Family Leave and FMLA\n\nPaid Family and Medical Leave is a Washington State program. FMLA is a federal program. In short, this does not replace FMLA. An employee’s use of FMLA, or other available leave, does not diminish their available Paid Family and Medical Leave benefit. It is possible for an employee to use multiple leave options consecutively.\n\n2.3 Unpaid Family and Medical Leave\n\nSummary\n\nThe Federal Medical Leave Act (FMLA) gives any workers the right to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave per year when:\n\nto care for yourself when seriously ill or pregnant;\n\nto give birth and/or care for a newborn or newly placed child;\n\nto care for an ill spouse, child or parent.\n\nFAQs: FMLA\n\nWho’s Covered by the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA)?\n\nYou are eligible for unpaid family/medical leave if you and your employer meet the following conditions:\n\nIf you work for a public employer, or a private employer who has 50 or more employees for at least 20 workweeks a year.\n\nHave worked for your employer for at least 12 months.\n\nHave worked at least 1,250 hours (about 25 hours per week) during the 12 months before the start of your leave. Both civilian job hours and hours of military service count towards total hours worked.\n\nWork at a location where your employer has at least 50 workers within a 75-mile radius.\n\nLearn More: Family Leave, Your Benefits, Job Protections\n\nVacation time, sick leave, retirement, and seniority benefits you built up before you took your leave generally remain available, but usually do not continue to build up while on leave. When you return to work, your employer must provide any other right, benefit, or position that you would have if you had not taken the leave.\n\nHealth Insurance: If you had health insurance paid by your employer before you took leave, your employer must provide it under similar terms and conditions. If your leave lasts longer than 12 weeks, you can continue paying the insurer directly for your benefits under COBRA. More information is available at the State Insurance Commissioner’s Office, www.insurance.wa.gov, or at (800) 562-6900.\n\nCan My Employer Refuse to Give Me My Job Back When I Return from FMLA Leave?\n\nYes, but only if ALL three of the following circumstances exist:\n\nYou returning to your job would cause extreme economic hardship for the employer; AND\n\nYou are considered a “key” employee; AND\n\nYour health care coverage was maintained throughout your leave.\n\nA key employee is a salaried employee who is among the highest paid 10% of employees within 75 miles of the work site. If your employer states that they may deny you your job back, they must give you written notice when you request your leave or at the start of your leave. The written notice must include the reasons for denying you your job back and give you a reasonable chance to return to work. If you go ahead with the leave after receiving the notice, you can still request your job back at the end of the leave period, and your employer must decide again whether your reinstatement would cause extreme economic hardship.\n\nFor more information visit: https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fmla.\n\nThe Washington State Family Care Act\n\nThe Washington State Family Care Act allows all employees to use any available sick leave, vacation time, or other paid time off to care for a family member. An employer cannot punish you for taking leave under this law. As long as you are qualified to use paid leave for your own illness, you can also use it for a family member. In certain cases, the law also gives additional time off for pregnancy and parenting over and above what the FMLA allows.\n\nYou can use your paid leave to care for your:\n\nChild (under age 18) when the child is sick or needs medical care.\n\nSpouse, registered domestic partner, parent, parent-in-law, or grandparent who has a serious or emergency health condition.\n\nDisabled adult son or daughter who is not able to take care of him/herself.\n\nFor more information, see: https://lni.wa.gov/workers-rights/leave/family-care-act\n\n2.4 Pregnancy and Parental Leave\n\nFederal and state laws protect new parents’ rights to take time off to care for a newly born or newly adopted or fostered child. Pregnancy, childbirth, and related medical conditions must be treated in the same way as other temporary illnesses or conditions.\n\nIt is illegal for your employer to discriminate against you because you are pregnant! In 2017, Washington State passed even stronger protections for pregnant employees. For more information on pregnancy discrimination, see Chapter 3: Your Right to be Free of Discrimination.\n\nFAQs: Parental Leave and Discrimination\n\nWhere to File a Claim\n\nIf you feel like your leave rights are being violated – you can go to a government agency (see below) for help and file a claim. Or you can contact an employment lawyer and, in some cases, take your employer directly to court.\n\nContact information for these organizations can be found in the Resources chapter of this manual.\n\nUS Department of Labor\n\nThe Family Medical Leave Act\n\nEmployment Security Department\n\nPaid Family and Medical Leave\n\nWA State Department of Labor and Industries\n\nWashington Family Care\n\nWashington State Family Leave Act\n\nDomestic Violence Leave\n\nWashington State Human Rights Commission\n\nPregnancy Discrimination in Employment\n\nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)\n\nPregnancy Discrimination\n\nLearn More: Additional Washington Parental Leave Protections\n\nThe Washington State Law Against Discrimination (WLAD) offers additional protections for pregnant women who work for employers with at least eight employees. Your employer has to give you time off while you are sick or temporarily disabled due to pregnancy-related conditions or childbirth. S/he must treat you the same as other workers on leave for sickness or temporary disabilities. Depending on your employer’s policy, this may or may not be paid. Your employer is required to give you either your old job back or a similar position after your leave is over.\n\nYour healthcare provider, depending on your condition, determines the amount of pregnancy disability leave you can take. The WLAD is enforced by the Washington State Human Rights Commission (WSHRC). WSHRC leave is not for placement of an adopted or fostered child, or to care for a child; it can only be taken for the pregnant person’s health-related reasons.

The state law applies to employers with eight or more employees. The federal law applies to employers with 15 or more employees.\n\nFAQs: Parental Leave\n\nNote: the answers below assume your employer has at least eight employees. Smaller employers and religious nonprofits are not covered by state or federal parental/pregnancy leave protection laws.\n\nDoes My Parental Leave Have To Be Paid?\n\nNo. However, if your employer offers paid time off for other illnesses or short-term disabilities, they must allow you to use that time for pregnancy or pregnancy-related conditions.\n\nIs My Job Protected? Can I Be Laid Off or Fired While Pregnant or on Maternity Leave?\n\nNot because of your pregnancy or related medical leave. However, your employer could fire you for other reasons.\n\nAt What Time in The Pregnancy Do I Have to Stop Working?\n\nYou and your medical provider decide when you must stop working. There is no standard time when a pregnant employee needs to stop working.\n\nDoes My Employer Need to Provide Health Insurance Coverage for Pregnancy, Childbirth and Related Medical Conditions?\n\nIf your employer offers health insurance for other temporary medical conditions, then s/he needs to provide insurance that covers pregnancy. If your employer doesn’t provide health insurance generally, s/he is not required to do so for pregnancy.\n\nCan I Expect to Have My Job Duties Altered to Accommodate My Medical Condition Because I Am Pregnant?\n\nYour employer should allow for minor job changes to reasonably accommodate any medical condition, including pregnancy. For more information on reasonable accommodation for disability see Chapter 3: Discrimination.\n\nCan My Employer Decrease My Work Hours Because I Am Pregnant?\n\nAn employer must treat a woman who is pregnant the same as any other employee. Your employer must have a business reason for changing your work schedule.\n\nThe Q & A above are adapted from information provided on the Washington State Human Rights Commission’s website: (www.hum.wa.gov/). Washington L&I also has more information on state and federal laws covering pregnancy and family leave: https://lni.wa.gov/workers-rights/leave/pregnancy-parental-leave\n\n2.5 Domestic Violence Leave\n\nWashington State law allows all employees to take (paid or unpaid) leave to deal with issues of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking for themselves or family members. You can take time off for:\n\nLaw-enforcement assistance\n\nMedical treatment or counseling at a domestic violence shelter or crisis program\n\nRelocation and safety issues\n\nYou must give notice to your employer as soon as possible if you need this leave. When you are requesting leave for domestic violence, your employer may ask you to prove that either you or a family member is a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking. Your employer must keep this information confidential.\n\nFor more information visit: https://lni.wa.gov/workers-rights/leave/domestic-violence-leave\n\nLearn more about paid leave in the Chapter 2.1 “Paid Sick and Safe Leave.”\n\n2.6 Workers Comp: Work Injuries and Occupational Disease\n\nSummary\n\nWorkers’ Compensation\n\nIf you are injured at work or develop an occupational (work-related) disease, you can apply for workers’ compensation. If you need medical treatment for your injury or illness you may be entitled to help in paying for treatment. You may also be entitled to receive partial lost wages if illness or injury stopped you from being able to work. All employees have the right to receive workers’ compensation, including undocumented workers and Transportation Network Company (TNC) drivers like Uber and Lyft.\n\nCoronavirus and Workers' Compensation\n\nEmployees may also have a Workers' Compensation claim for Coronavirus cases if the virus resulted from a work exposure. For frontline workers with Coronavirus, exposure at work allows you to quality for Workers' Comp. Frontline includes health care (including any work in a health care facility), farm and agriculture work, food processing, distribution and sale, first responders, transit, child care, retail, hospitality, corrections, education and library work. Other claims that meet certain criteria for exposure will be considered on a case-by-case basis.\n\nSee L&I's Coronavirus WC Q&A here\n\nWorkers’ Compensation State Fund vs. Self-Insurance Coverage\n\nState Fund\n\nMost Washington employers purchase worker’s compensation insurance from a pool called the State Fund. The State Fund is run by the Department of Labor and Industries (L&I). Here is L&I’s workers' compensation claims website: (https://lni.wa.gov/claimsI).\n\nSelf-Insurance Coverage\n\nSome larger employers \"self-insure\" for injuries at work. If your employer is self-insured, see self-insured FAQs below.\n\nFor workers covered by the State-Fund insurance programs:\n\nIf You Get Injured on the Job or Diagnosed with an Occupational Disease:\n\n1. Get First Aid and/or See a Doctor\n\nWhen you are injured on the job or realize you have an occupational disease you have some rights. You can:\n\nGo to the doctor, healthcare provider, or emergency room of your choice,\n\nRequest an interpreter if you prefer to speak a language other than English, and\n\nRefuse to have an employer representative go with you.\n\n2. Report the Injury….\n\n…To Your Doctor\n\nBe sure to tell medical staff, including the doctor, that you were injured or made sick on the job. They will help you file your initial workers’ compensation paperwork, or file a claim. Explain to the doctor what caused your injury.\n\nIf you can’t work, or can’t do all of the things you used to be able to do at work because of your injury, your doctor will also complete an Activity Prescription Form. This will tell your employer and L&I how your work must be changed or how long you need to rest.\n\n…To Your Employer\n\nLet your employer know right away that you are injured so they know about your injuries when the L&I paperwork arrives and can help you plan your return to work. If you don’t let your employer know about your injury and you need to file a claim later, it may be denied.\n\n…To the Department of Labor and Industries (L&I)\n\nThe Report of Industrial Injury or Occupational Disease is an accident report form available at hospitals, clinics or doctors’ offices. You complete the worker portion of this form. Your doctor fills out the medical portion of this form and sends it to L&I.\n\nOnce L&I receives your claim, they will assign a claim manager. If you are more comfortable speaking a language other than English, you have the right to an interpreter at all doctors’ appointments and in all meetings with your L&I case manager.\n\n…To Your Union, If You Have One\n\nIf you are in a union workplace, let your union representative know that you are injured. Union reps may be able to help with this process and need to be kept informed of all job-related injuries to help correct the workplace problem. Your union contract may provide you with additional protection in case of an on-the-job injury.\n\nFAQs:\n\nWhat do I do if my employer is self-insured?\n\nAbout a third of Washington workers work for self-insured employers. If you work for a self-insured employer, your rights and benefits do not change, but you must file a claim through your employer. Your employer should have a notice on the safety bulletin board about how to file an accident report for a workplace injury or disease. You may also talk to your supervisor, union representative, or HR manager about how to do it.\n\nL&I’s self-insurance section will help you if you disagree with your employer. For more information you can contact L&I’s Self-Insurance Section in Olympia at (360) 902-6901. There is also an Ombudsman (a representative) appointed to help self-insured injured workers with their claims, call 888-317-0493.\n\nA guide to workers’ compensation for employees of self-insured companies can be downloaded from the L&I website here: https://lni.wa.gov/insurance/self-insurance/about-self-insurance/\n\nWhat do I do if my employer tells me not to report the injury to the Department of Labor and Industries (L&I), or tells me to lie and say it didn’t happen on the job?\n\nThis is illegal “claim suppression.” You should contact L&I right away at 1-888-811-5974, or submit a Claim Suppression Complaint Form: https://lni.wa.gov/fraud/claim-suppression\n\nLearn more here about: Status of Claim; Receiving Medical Care; Monetary Compensation and Getting Back to Work.\n\nLearn More: Injuries\n\nStatus of Claim\n\nOnce you file your claim, L&I will review your case, decide to accept or reject your claim, and also decide whether to leave your case open or close it. When your claim is open, you can apply for time- loss (money to replace lost wages), receive medical treatment, apply for payment for permanent disability, and receive help from a vocational counselor to get back to work quicker.\n\nIf L&I decides that your injury is not work-related, or if your doctor and L&I decide that your injury won’t improve with more medical care, L&I will close your claim. This means you cannot seek more benefits, either financial or medical. You can appeal a decision to close your claim. In some cases, you may also reopen your claim if your injury or illness returns at a later date. If you would like to reopen your claim, speak with your doctor.\n\nTIP: Washington is a “no-fault state,” meaning that a workplace injury can be covered no matter whose “fault” it was.\n\nIf You Do Not Agree With L&I’s Decision to Close Your Claim\n\nIf there are disagreements about any decision L&I makes about your claim, you, your doctor, or your employer have the right to protest the decision to L&I or appeal the decision directly to the Board of Industrial Insurance Appeals (BIIA). Many claims are denied by L&I the first time, but get approved when appealed – so it is worth filing a protest or appeal to the decision. For more information on how to protest a decision, visit the L&I website appeals website.\n\nReceiving Medical Care\n\nFree\n\nWhile your claim is open, you should not have to pay for any medical treatment or service out of your pocket. Once your claim is accepted, L&I assigns you a claim number and mails you a claim card. This works like an insurance card; you show it to any medical provider, and you should not be charged. If a medical provider charges you for services, contact your case manager right away.\n\nChoice of Provider\n\nYou have the right to visit a medical provider near you, even if you do not live in Washington State. For your initial visit, you may choose any doctor or emergency room. After your first medical visit, you must receive all treatment from a doctor in L&I’s Medical Provider Network. You can search for network providers near you here: https://lni.wa.gov/claims/for-workers/find-a-doctor/\n\nTIP: If you were injured on the job in Washington State, Washington laws will apply to your claim no matter where you live.\n\nYou have the right to change doctors at any time during your ongoing treatment, but you must request a “transfer of care”. You can do this online or on paper. Throughout the treatment, you have the right to refuse to allow an L&I claim manager or any employer representative to come into your medical exams with you.\n\nCompensation if You Can’t Work, and Getting Back to Work\n\nIf You Cannot Work at All\n\nIf your doctor says that you are unable to work due to your injury, L&I may pay for part of your lost wages (time-loss). After the first three days, L&I pays time-loss for days of work you miss, if your doctor says you should not work. More information can be found at the L&I Wage Replacement website\n\nIf You Can Do Some Work\n\nReturn to your job/employer where you were injured as soon as it’s safe for you to do so. Many workers can return to work gradually, while still receiving medical benefits. L&I also has programs to help you get back to work and encourage employers to hire you. You should talk with your L&I case manager about options and visit the L&I Return to Work website to learn more:\n\nPermanent Disabilities\n\nIf your injury or work-related disease caused permanent damage to your body, you may receive a disability award in addition to your regular workers’ compensation award. There are two kinds of disability awards for permanent damage: “partial” and “total.” The amount you can receive is set by law. You must request a disability status while your claim is open.\n\nPartial Permanent Disabilities\n\nThis means that you have permanently lost some ability you had before the injury, but you are still able to do some work.\n\nTotal Permanent Disabilities\n\nIf your injury is so serious that you can never work again, you may be eligible for a life-long pension (income) to make up for the fact that you can no longer earn a living.\n\nStructured Settlement\n\nSome workers who are age 55 or older may qualify for a structured settlement plan. A structured settlement means that you, L&I and your employer agree to a fixed amount of money you will receive and a payment plan. Once you agree, they will not owe you any more money even if that amount is less than the traditional time-loss benefit plan. You still have the right to future medical benefits, even if you agree to accept a settlement for your lost wages. You should discuss structured settlements with an attorney or financial consultant. For more information about structured settlement call the L&I settlement specialists at 360-902-6101 or visit the L&I Settlement website.\n\nMonitoring the Case\n\nIf you need information about your claim call L&I at:\n\nPhone – 800-547-8367, TDD/TTY – (360) 902-5797\n\nYou can also call 800-831-5227 for a fast, computerized update on claim status. You can also review your claim at the Claim and Account Center https://secure.lni.wa.gov/home/\n\nRetaliation and Discrimination\n\nYour employer may not discriminate or retaliate against you for filing a claim or seeking benefits you are entitled to. This includes:\n\nFiring or laying you off.\n\nGiving you a worse job.\n\nChanging your assignment to an undesirable shift.\n\nRefusing to adjust your job duties to the light-duty restrictions ordered by your doctor.\n\nDenying you a promotion.\n\nReducing your wages/benefits, or make you suffer other negative treatment because you filed a claim.\n\nTIP: You only have 90 days to report discrimination so don’t delay!\n\nIf you think that you are being discriminated against or mistreated for filing a claim, or if you have questions, call L&I’s investigation program at 360-902-9155 or download and file a Discrimination Complaint form from the L&I Discrimination website (http://lni.wa.gov/fraud).\n\nHelp Through the Injured Worker Process\n\nYou have the right to be represented by an attorney as you go through the process of applying for Workers’ Compensation, but you are not required to have one. You can also visit Project HELP (http://www.projecthelpwa.com) or call 800-255-9752. Project Help is a cooperative effort of L&I and the Washington State Labor Council, and can help you with your claim. The L&I Injured Worker website also provides full information on the injured worker process. (http://lni.wa.gov/claims/for-workers/file-a-claim/)\n\n2.7 Long-Term Care Illness and Disability Options\n\nSummary\n\nIf you become disabled for any reason and cannot work for at least 12 months, you may qualify for monthly cash payments and medical disability benefits from the federal Social Security Administration. These programs are called Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). You must be a US-citizen or documented non-citizen to qualify for SSDI or SSI.\n\nIf you are injured on the job or diagnosed with an occupational disease, you can apply for Workers’ Compensation as well - this is a state program run by Labor and Industries (L&I) (see section on Workers' Comp above)\n\nSocial Security Disability Insurance, Supplemental Security Income and Workers’ Compensation are all separate. In some cases, you can collect benefits from more than one of these programs at the same time.\n\nWhat is Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI)?\n\nSSDI, in most cases, is for people with disabilities who have a work history. You must have worked long enough and paid Social Security taxes. The amount of SSDI you get depends on your past earnings. You do not have to be low income to receive SSDI.\n\nWhat Is Supplemental Security Income (SSI)?\n\nSSI is generally for people with disabilities of any age who have low incomes and assets less than $2,000. Low-income people 65 years and older with or without disabilities may also be able to receive SSI benefits. You can get SSI if you have never worked.\n\nA Summary of Your SSI/SSDI Rights\n\nThere is no charge to apply for Social Security Disability Insurance or Supplemental Security Income.\n\nYou should apply as soon as possible after becoming disabled.

The notice must explain how to appeal.\n\nYou have the right to appeal. If you are denied benefits, you have 60 days from the denial notice date to appeal.\n\nYou have the right to a representative or lawyer to help you in your appeal.\n\nFAQs:\n\nDo I Qualify for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI)?\n\nYou must be “disabled” and not able to work for at least 12 months. \"Disability\" under Social Security is based on how much you can work. Social Security will generally not consider you disabled and you will not qualify for benefits if you are working this calendar year AND your earnings average more than $1,220 a month (this figure is for 2019; this amount usually increases slightly every year).\n\nYou are considered disabled if:\n\nThe SSA recognizes your medical condition. See this list of qualifying medical conditions: www.ssa.gov/compassionateallowances/index.htm.\n\nIf your condition is not listed you may qualify if:\n\nYou cannot do the work you did before AND\n\nYou cannot adjust to other work because of your medical condition(s) AND\n\nYour disability has lasted or is expected to last for at least one year or to result in death.\n\nYou must meet some minimum work requirements:\n\nYou must have worked recently.\n\nYou must have worked, and paid taxes, for long enough in your life. See the Disability Benefits online handbook for more information on these rules: http://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10029.pdf\n\nHow Do I Qualify for Supplemental Security Income (SSI)?\n\nSupplemental Security Income may be able to help you if you are blind, disabled or 65 years and older, and have little or no income. Disabled or blind children can also receive SSI. SSI provides money to meet basic needs for food, clothing, and shelter. It is not based on your previous work history.\n\nYou must be over age 65, or blind, or disabled.\n\nYou must be a US citizen, permanent resident, or US national who is, generally living in the US.\n\nYou must also show that you have little-to-no income or other resources to qualify.\n\nThe Social Security Administration (SSA) may also consider your living situation if you live in housing like a shelter, halfway house, or other community housing.\n\nWhat If My Claim Is Denied?\n\nIf your claim is denied, appeal! You have 60 days from the date of the denial notice to appeal. Social Security often denies your first disability claim. Nationally, about 75% of all applicants are denied when they first apply. But many of these people ultimately get their benefits.\n\nYou may want to hire a lawyer who specializes in Social Security disability cases.\n\nLearn More: Disability and Long-Term Care Programs\n\nSocial Security Disability (SSDI)\n\nHow Much Money Will I, Or My Family, Receive?\n\nThe amount of money (benefit amount) you will receive depends on your work history and the amount of money you have paid to the Social Security Administration. Certain members of your family, such as your spouse, minor child, or disabled adult child, may qualify for benefits of their own based on your work, if you qualify for SSDI benefits.\n\nWill I Receive Medical Care?\n\nWith SSDI, you will get Medicare coverage automatically after you have received disability benefits for two years. For more information on Medicare, contact the SSA or visit the SSA’s Medicare website: (http://www.socialsecurity.gov/pgm/medicare.htm).\n\nCan I Go Back To Work?\n\nThere are special rules that help you keep your monthly benefits and Medicare while you test your ability to work.

You can also apply in person at your local Social Security Office. Documented non-citizens should see the SSI For Non-Citizens info sheet (https://www.ssa.gov/ssi/spotlights/spot-non-citizens.htm).\n\nSupplemental Security Income\n\nHow Much Money Will I Receive?\n\nThe amount that you receive depends on your living situation, other income, if you are applying as an individual or a couple and how many children you have. In 2021, the federal SSI benefit for an individual living alone is $794 per month, and for a couple it is $1,191 per month.

Ethnic slurs, racial \"jokes,\" insulting comments and/or other verbal or physical actions based on race and/or color may be illegal if they are severe and ongoing and/or are part of a pattern of discriminatory actions.\n\nAlso, your employer cannot hire, fire, or promote based on \"stereotypes\" (an overly simple idea held by one person or group about another). S/he cannot make assumptions about your personality or what you can do based on your race. In addition, employers cannot decide not to hire you because you are married to or associate with someone of a certain race. Your employer also cannot discriminate against you because you go to schools or places of worship associated with a particular race.\n\nNational Origin/Ancestry\n\nAn employer cannot discriminate or harass you because you or your family are from another country; you have a name or accent associated with another country; you participate in customs associated with another country; or you are married to or spend time with people from another country.\n\nA rule that you speak only English at work might be against the law, unless the employer shows that the rule is necessary for business reasons. Your employer must let you speak other languages during non-work time, such as lunch and breaks.\n\nCitizenship or Immigration Status\n\nDiscrimination based on citizenship or immigration status is an unfair practice and violates the Washington Law Against Discrimination (WLAD). A person or entity may make a distinction or treat someone differently based on citizenship or immigration status only if a state or federal law, regulation, or a government contract requires it.\n\nIf you are an immigrant with documentation to work legally in the U.S., an employer generally may not discriminate against you for not being a citizen.\n\nRight to prevent Document Abuse: Document abuse is when an employer requires you to present specific documents to prove that you can work, instead of allowing you to choose which documents to show them. As long as the documents you show meet the legal requirements, it’s your choice which ones to use. It is also illegal for your employer to make you show more documents than the I-9 process requires. For example, if you show your Permanent Resident Card, your employer can’t make you also show a birth certificate. For a list of the documents that satisfy I-9 requirements, see the last page on this link: http://www.uscis.gov/i-9.\n\nRight against Nationality or Citizenship Discrimination: An employer is discriminating if they demand certain workers prove that they are legally allowed to work while others are not asked for the same proof. For example, if your employer requires workers of Chinese descent to provide documents but does not require this from workers of German descent, this is discrimination, probably because of race and national origin. However this does not protect undocumented workers.\n\nReligion\n\nAn employer cannot discriminate or harass you for religious reasons. You cannot be required to participate in religious activities to keep your job, nor can you be banned from participating in religious activities.\n\nYour employer cannot hire, fire, promote, or demote you based on religious stereotypes about you or people you associate with.\n\nYour employer must make \"reasonable accommodations” for your religion. They may be required to make changes that will let you do your job and still practice your faith, unless it would make it difficult for your employer to do business.\n\nSex, Gender and Pregnancy\n\nIt is illegal for an employer to discriminate or harass you because of your sex or gender. There are a few different categories of gender discrimination in the workplace.\n\nDiscrimination in Hiring, Promotions, and Wages\n\nIt is illegal to discriminate on the basis of sex on wages or benefits where men and women do jobs of similar skill, effort, and responsibility for the same employer with similar working conditions.\n\nGender discrimination also includes discrimination based on stereotypes about your responsibilities as a mother or father.\n\nSexual Harassment\n\nThere are two types of illegal sexual harassment: hostile work environment and quid pro quo harassment.\n\nA hostile work environment is when it is difficult or unsafe for you to do your job because of your gender. This includes directing unwelcome sexual words or actions at you. It is illegal harassment if these actions are severe and ongoing and/or are part of a pattern of other discriminatory actions.\n\nQuid pro quo sexual harassment is when a supervisor or other employee above you asks you for sexual favors in return for better treatment at work. This may be harassment, even if you agree to it.\n\nPregnancy and Pregnancy-Related Conditions\n\nPregnancy, childbirth, and related medical conditions must be treated in the same way as other temporary illnesses or conditions. Employers can’t make choices about hiring, firing, promotion, or demotion based on stereotypes of pregnant women, or an effort to protect pregnant women from the hazards of the job. The only exception is if an employer can demonstrate business necessity. For information on pregnancy leave, please see Chapter 2.3: Pregnancy and Parental Leave.\n\nSexual Orientation and Gender Identity\n\nIn Washington, it is illegal for your employer to discriminate or harass you because of perceived or actual sexual orientation, gender identity, or transgender status. Employers can’t make choices about hiring, firing, promotion, or demotion based on sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nAge Discrimination (40+)\n\nIf you are over 39 years old, an employer cannot discriminate against you or harass you because of your age.\n\nIt is illegal to:\n\nUse age to make choices about hiring, firing, promoting, and demoting\n\nGive age preferences/limits in job notices and ads. Age limits are only allowed in limited situations\n\nDiscriminate based on age in apprenticeship programs\n\nGive older employees fewer or worse benefits than younger employees.\n\nDisability Discrimination\n\nAn employer cannot discriminate or harass you because of a disability or medical condition or a belief that you have a disability or medical condition. Use of a trained guide dog or service animal is also protected under Washington State law.\n\nIf you have a disability, the employer has to make reasonable accommodations for you to work so long as you can do the essential parts of your job with these accommodations. This means working out a system that lets you do the job just as other employees do, or coming up with different tasks that you are able to perform. For information on taking leave for disability see Chapter 2: Your Right to Care for Yourself and Family.\n\nYour prospective employer cannot ask you to take a physical or medical test before offering you a job. Once you have been offered a job, your employer can ask you to take a physical or medical test, if all other workers doing similar tasks have to take the same test (you can’t being singled out because of a disability, or if your employer thinks you have a disability) and the test is really necessary for the job. Your employer cannot discriminate against you based on genetic information that suggests you are more likely to get a disease.\n\nNew! Court Decision Rules Obesity an Impairment\n\nIn 2019, the Washington Supreme Court ruled in Taylor v. Burlington Northern Railroad Holdings, Inc. that obesity qualifies as an impairment under Washington Law Against Discrimination (WLAD) and does not have to be caused by a separate disorder or condition in order to be a protected class under WLAD. Therefore, if an employer refuses to hire someone because the employer perceives the applicant to have obesity, and the applicant is able to properly perform the job in question, the employer violates this section of the WLAD.\n\nLifestyle Discrimination\n\nThere is current debate whether employers can make decisions about hiring, promotions, insurance rates, etc. based on employee lifestyle. For instance, employers have discriminated against people who smoke cigarettes, eat certain foods, or drink alcohol in their free time. It is not clear if this is legal or not.\n\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act or the Washington State Human Rights Commission might protect you from this type of discrimination. Laws against disability discrimination may protect some people who have medical issues such as obesity or high cholesterol from employers who discriminate against them.\n\nUnion and Concerted Activity\n\nUnder the National Labor Relations Act, it is illegal for your employer to discriminate against you because you are in a union, because you support a union, or because you are joining with your coworkers to improve your working conditions, even if you are not in a union. Please see Chapter 5 for more information.\n\nCriminal Background\n\nWashington’s Fair Chance Act protects job applicants with a criminal record so they may fairly compete for job opportunities for which they are otherwise qualified. It covers job advertising, applications and hiring processes. It covers most employers, with exceptions for unsupervised access to vulnerable persons; law enforcement or criminal justice agencies; financial institutions, or employers who are permitted or required by law to ask about an applicant’s criminal record for employment purposes; or employers seeking non-employee volunteers.See the Attorney General’s information page on the Washington Fair Chance Act (https://www.atg.wa.gov/fair-chance-act).\n\nSeattle has a Fair Chance Employment Ordinance similar to the state law, making it illegal for most employers in Seattle to advertise jobs that keep out applicants with a criminal history, ask criminal history questions or perform criminal background checks during the initial part of the hiring process. If you have already been hired and your employer performs a background check s/he cannot take actions against you (fire, demote, etc.) because of a criminal background unless s/he allows you to explain or correct the criminal history information, and s/he can prove that there is a good business reason for their action. The law does not apply to jobs with unsupervised access to children under 16, individuals with developmental disabilities or vulnerable adults. For more information, visit the Seattle Office of Labor Standards (http://www.seattle.gov/laborstandards/ordinances/fair-chance-employment.\n\n3.2 What if I have Experienced Discrimination?\n\nSummary\n\nIf you think your rights have been violated, keep track of what happened and when—you will need that information later!\n\nStep 1: Report it to your employer. Unless your employer is the one who is harassing you, you must report harassment to your employer and give them a chance to fix the problem before filing a complaint. Many workplaces have an employee assigned to handle these issues, sometimes called an “EEO Officer” or Human Resources staff. If you are a union member, you can report the harassment to your union representative or steward.\n\nStep 2: Report it to a government agency. Any worker who believes that his or her employment rights have been violated may file a discrimination charge.\n\nIf you think you have been illegally discriminated against, contact a government agency as soon as possible. Pay attention to timelines. Under most discrimination laws, you have only 6 months to one year after the act of discrimination to file a claim.\n\nFAQs\n\nIf I Report Discrimination, Can My Employer Fire Me?\n\nIt is against the law for an employer to retaliate against you for filing a discrimination charge, participating in an investigation, or opposing discriminatory practices!\n\nRetaliation means punishing employees because they reported (or helped report) a violation to the employer or the government, or cooperated with an investigation. If your employer fires, demotes, fails to promote, or takes other negative action that affects your job, it may be illegal retaliation. It is also illegal for your employer to encourage or allow coworkers to retaliate against you.\n\nWhere Do I File A Claim?\n\nYou can file a discrimination claim with the local, state or federal agencies described below. Before filing a complaint, you may want to check with each agency to see how quickly they process claims and what help they provide. Not all agencies provide the same solutions, or cover the same laws. Knowing what an agency can offer may help you determine which one is best for your needs."
