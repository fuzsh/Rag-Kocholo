        "text": "Fall is in full swing here in the Pacific Northwest. The leaves are falling, the temperature is dropping, and Halloween is near. It’s time to gear up for cooler, damper weather. We, like many of you, appreciate comfortable, technical apparel that is also stylish. Whether cozying up by a campfire or visiting your local pumpkin patch, now’s a great time to select some new items to see you through the season. We’ve teamed up with DICK’S Sporting Goods to show you this year’s new coats, footwear, and other fall/winter apparel to keep you bundled up and ready for anything.\n\nNorthwest Trek Wildlife Park is a 725-acre park of wildlife and wilderness conservation. Opportunities to get outside and enjoy nature are made possible with a Wild Drive (in your vehicle) and a Wild Walk. These opportunities are by appointment, and timed tickets can conveniently be purchase online. One of the greatest parts of these little adventures is that they are family-friendly.\n\nThe opportunity to enjoy wildflowers, views of 5 significant mountains, a natural rock arch, and two different trails drew us to this hike. Those are some of the things you’ll see while hiking Silver Star Mountain. This easy-moderate hike should be on everyone’s must-do list! The drive up may be challenging, but the hike itself is rewarding.\n\nWith 360-degree views at the top and a good overlook around the midway point, the TP Jim Trail on Baldy Mountain can be a little challenging but well worth it. It's only 2-miles to the top, but the nearly 2,000' elevation gain slowed us down quite a bit. However, all that effort does come with rewards from this vantage point: the Yakima River and campground at the bottom, Mt. Rainier, Mt. Adams, and Mt. Hood visible in the distance, as well as the sparse, hilly eastern Washington landscape to be seen all around.\n\nThe Apple Capital Recreational Loop Trail, also more commonly referred to as the “Loop Trail,” is a 10-mile paved trail running along both shores of the Columbia River in Wenatchee, WA. Popular with cyclists, joggers, dog-walkers, and more, this trail provides excellent views of the river, the city, and the nearby mountains. With a mostly level grade, it is easy enough for everyone to enjoy. Nearby numerous parks, local businesses, the market, and rest areas make this an enjoyable experience.\n\nAfter camping the previous night at Wenatchee Confluence State Park, we were well rested and ready to go. The day was forecasted to be clear, sunny, and warm—so we opted to get this hike done in the cool of the morning. As we drove to Saddle Rock trailhead, a short 15 minutes from the park, the sun was out, and we knew we’d have some great views from the top.\n\nOur goal was to camp somewhere close to home and to bring our bikes along to hit the trails. We love exploring all of the Pacific Northwest, but the majority of our journeys take us on very long drives which become a bit draining at times. So we opted for the nearby Dash Point State Park. We’ve visited in the past, but this would be our first time staying there and using the bike trails.\n\nKnown as one of the top equestrian parks west of the Mississippi, Bridle Trails State Park offers 28-miles worth of trails for horseback riding, hiking, jogging, and the walking of leashed dogs. This 489-acre day-use park started out as 640-acres, which was reserved for the purpose of supporting public schools by the sale of parcels of land and logging under the 1853 Organic Act of Washington Territory. Around 1930, horseback riding residents successfully petitioned the Commissioner of Public Lands to use the land for a park, which then lead to the establishment of Bridle Trails State Park in 1932.\n\nQuickly becoming a favorite part of the state to us, we took our third trip to the Westport, Washington area for two nights. Renting a cabin at Twin Harbors State Park as our temporary home base, we explored the town of Westport and two other nearby Washington State Parks over the weekend. Beaches to lighthouses to a colony of sea lions, we saw a lot!\n\nThere’s an absolute thrill that comes with viewing animals in nature. Childlike wonder and curiosity takes over whenever we are graced with the opportunity to see animals of the wild up close. Oak Creek Wildlife Area gives visitors the chance to appreciate elk and bighorn sheep safely, but at close range. There are areas along a fence for viewing as the animals mill around or rest on the ground. Feeding times, where hay bales are dropped throughout the field, gives visitors a chance to see interactions amongst the individuals of the herd while eating. Finally, you can pile in the back of a large raised truck that will drive you right into the midst of a few hundred animals to experience the sites, sounds and smells that are inherent to a herd of elk.\n\nSometimes you just need a few days away from the pull of home and work. A chance to rest, relax and explore was what we wanted and what we found. On the Kitsap Peninsula you’ll find Belfair State Park, Scenic Beach State Park and Gold Creek Trail. We spent a coupe of nights in a cabin at Belfair State Park, hiked Gold Creek Trail and explored Scenic Beach State Park. Waterfront, forest, mountain views and starry nights were healing elixirs."
