        "text": "What is Cardiac Catheterization?\n\nThe Cardiac Diagnostic and Interventional Unit (CDIU) unit consists of highly specialized doctors, nurses and other health professionals who diagnose and treat a variety of heart conditions.\n\nUsing a specialized catheter, which is a long thin tube, and other small flexible tools, doctors can seal holes or open holes of the heart, widen narrowed passages, repair valves and obtain a sample or biopsy of the heart. Doctors can also gather information about the structure of your child’s heart and its valves; the pressure in the chambers of the heart and its blood vessels; the amount of oxygen in the chambers of the heart and its blood vessels; the amount of blood your child’s heart pumps to the body and the rhythm of the heart. The health-care team will use this as important information to create a clinical plan for your child.\n\nAdditionally, the unit has an interventional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) suite, which helps doctors view what they are doing in real time without using radiation.\n\nLearn more about heart catheterization.\n\nCDIU Staff Cardiologists\n\nAudrey Marshall (Section Head)\n\nLee Benson\n\nRajiv Chaturvedi\n\nThe Cardiac Imaging team of specialists at the Hospital for Sick Children work in the CDIU to provide expert non-invasive diagnostic evaluation in the modalities of cardiac chest x-ray, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and computed tomography (CT). State-of-the-art imaging techniques are specifically tailored for each patient to provide detailed individualized information about cardiovascular anatomy, function, and hemodynamics. This information contributes to treatment decision making, surgical planning, and best patient outcomes.\n\nOur service is comprised of three core foundations:\n\nExcellence in patient-centered clinical care\n\nOur team is highly subspecialized and experienced. We work in close seamless collaboration with our surgical and medical colleagues in the Labatt Family Heart Centre. Each cardiac MRI or CT is directly supervised in-person by a subspecialist cardiac imaging physician expert. We are committed to always providing the highest quality patient-centered care.\n\nGlobal education and training\n\nThe Cardiac Imaging team at the Hospital for Sick Children has a strong legacy of global education and outreach. We offer a one- to two-year dedicated subspecialty fellowship in cardiovascular MRI. In addition, a two-year research fellowship in cardiovascular imaging is also available.\n\nTransformative cardiac imaging research\n\nThe Cardiac Imaging physicians partner with imaging scientists in the SickKids Research Institute to constantly advance our imaging techniques and knowledge of disease to best care for patients.\n\nNotable areas of academic focus include:\n\n3D-printing of congenital heart disease\n\nNon-invasive imaging biomarkers in single ventricle disease\n\nMyocardial tissue characterization\n\nCardiovascular blood flow\n\nFetal MRI (see below)\n\nThe Cardiac Imaging team’s top priority is to always provide exemplary individualized patient- and family centered care to achieve the best outcomes.\n\nFetal MRI\n\nMedical imaging plays a vital role in the diagnosis and management of fetal cardiac abnormalities during pregnancy. While ultrasound is the current standard for fetal imaging, there is growing interest in the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate the fetal heart in cases where ultrasound cannot provide a complete diagnosis.\n\nFetal MRI is challenging due to the size of fetal heart structures, relatively high fetal heart rates, and multiple sources of motion that occur during the scan. The Fetal MRI group focuses on novel approaches that address the technical challenges of imaging the fetus and explore new ways to assess and manage diseases that affect the fetal heart and placenta.\n\nCardiac Imaging Staff\n\nDr. Israel Valverde (Section Head)\n\nDr. Christopher Z Lam\n\nDr. Cathy MacDonald\n\nDr. Christopher Macgowan (Fetal MRI)\n\nDr. John Sled (Fetal MRI)\n\nDr. Mike Seed (Cardiac Imaging and Fetal MRI)\n\nDr. Shi-Joon Yoo\n\nThe Cardiomyopathy & Heart Function (CHF) program was founded in 2005 and since then has been an integral section to the Division of Cardiology. The CHF program provides expertise in delivering both inpatient and outpatient care for children with heart muscle diseases like cardiomyopathies and for children with poor heart function due to a “weakheart muscle”.\n\nFor further information regarding pediatric heart failure and other pediatric cardiac conditions please see the Heart Learning Hub.\n\nThe CHF program runs a regular interdisciplinary clinic each week as well as additional specialty clinics for Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy, Friedreich’s Ataxia, and a regular cardiomyopathy screening clinic for children with affected family members. We also provide cardiac care for children with neuromuscular diseases, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and for children who have undergone chemotherapy for childhood cancers. In addition, the program runs a robust home inotrope program and is responsible for the care of children requiring ventricular assist devices (Treatment of heart failure in children).\n\nOur comprehensive ventricular assist device (VAD) program is dedicated to managing advanced heart failure through a range of devices that provide mechanical circulatory support. The VAD Program employs a collaborative and multidisciplinary approach to provide tailored care for our patients leading to improved outcomes and quality of life.\n\nThe CHF team is comprised of pediatric cardiologists and nurse practitioners, dietitians, social workers, child life, occupational and physical therapists, pharmacists, and genetic counselors.\n\nFrom a research standpoint, the CHF program is in the forefront of innovation with ongoing participation in a number of research activities that include novel drug trials, multi-centre registry participation, advanced genomics and stem cell research, Cardiac Precision Medicine, digital technology, and quality improvement efforts.\n\nStaff Cardiologists\n\nAamir Jeewa (Section Head)\n\nAlyssa Power\n\nAnne Dipchand\n\nSeema Mital\n\nAdvanced Practice Nurses\n\nKristen George\n\nLinda Fazari\n\nGenetic Counselors\n\nLaura Zahavich\n\nCara Inglese\n\nClinical Coordinator\n\nStacey Jeong\n\nVAD Coordinator\n\nAndrea Maurich\n\nThe Echocardiography Laboratory in The Labatt Family Heart Centre provides diagnostic cardiac ultrasound for children with suspected or known heart disease. We evaluate patients ranging from the fetus to childhood to adolescence. Using state-of-the-art equipment, ultrasounds are performed by highly skilled paediatric sonographers and interpreted by a world-class team of diagnostic physicians.\n\nWhat to expect when you visit the Echo Lab\n\nFollow Shaun's journey through the Echo Lab to discover what you can expect if you are coming to SickKids for one of these tests: an echocardiogram (or 'echo'), a vascular ultrasound or a bicycle stress echo!\n\nClinical Echocardiography\n\nThe clinical echocardiography service specializes in the recognition and assessment of structural heart defects and the evaluation of cardiac function. Studies are performed according to well-defined imaging protocols with the highest quality control. We introduced the innovative concept of functional paediatric echocardiography which uses the most advanced equipment for the analysis of cardiac function and includes three-dimensional echocardiography, tissue Doppler and myocardial strain imaging. We also provide stress echocardiography, using either dobutamine or supine bicycle, which allows ultrasound imaging of children during exercise.\n\nFetal Cardiology\n\nOur Fetal Cardiac Program (explained later on this page) performs fetal echocardiography to diagnose heart problems in developing babies during pregnancy. After the echocardiogram is performed, multidisciplinary counseling is provided by members of the team who work closely with other prenatal care providers. This program also provides fetal treatment and intervention for certain abnormalities or diseases.\n\nResearch\n\nWe have an integrated Cardiovascular Ultrasound Research Program which develops and explores the clinical utility of newer echocardiographic techniques for the diagnosis and management of paediatric cardiovascular disease. Established in 2005, we offer a unique environment for cardiovascular imaging research where researchers, engineers, and research sonographers collaborate to study vascular and cardiac function in children.\n\nEducation\n\nOur laboratory is dedicated to educating and training both physicians and sonographers. Using a structured hands-on training program, we aim to teach our imaging protocols as well as our approach to image optimization. We also offer the opportunity for observers from all over the world to see our laboratory in action. We host the Echocardiography Course on Congenital Heart Disease, which features an international faculty of experts and aims to improve the knowledge of those who perform and/or interpret paediatric echocardiograms.\n\nOur Team\n\nThe Echocardiography Laboratory is a large team of physicians, sonographers, nurses, fellows and administrative staff. The team is led by Dr. Luc Mertens (Echocardiography) and Dr. Lindsay Freud (Fetal Cardiology). The team managers are Lauren Skanes (clinical) and Christine Kerr (research).\n\nStaff Cardiologists\n\nDr. Anne Dipchand\n\nDr. Andreea Dragulescu\n\nDr. Mark Friedberg\n\nDr. Lindsay Freud\n\nDr. Vitor Guerra\n\nDr. Edgar Jaeggi\n\nDr. Luc Mertens (Section Head)\n\nDr. Conall Morgan\n\nDr. Mike Seed\n\nDr. Varsha Thakur\n\nDr. Rachel Wald\n\nDr. Shi-Joon Yoo\n\nDr. Barbara Cifra (Exercise Medicine Program)\n\nLearn more about echocardiograms (heart ultrasounds).\n\nBeing active and playing with family and friends is an important part of childhood, and it contributes to children and adolescents’ physical and mental well-being. Understanding the best types and levels of exercise and best choices for sport or recreational activity can be challenging for children living with a heart or chronic medical condition.\n\nThe Exercise Medicine Program, created within the Labatt Family Heart Centre at The Hospital for Sick Children, is the first program in Canada to promote physical activity by providing individualized exercise programs for our patients based on a comprehensive medical and functional evaluation.\n\nThe Exercise Medicine Program at SickKids is the first program in Canada integrates Rehabilitation and Preventive Medicine into the care of children and teenagers living with congenital heart disease and chronic disease. Meet the Exercise Medicine Program team and learn about Alex's and his family's experience in the program.\n\nThe Exercise Medicine Program at SickKids is the first program in Canada that integrate Rehabilitation and Preventative Medicine into the care of children and teenagers living with congenital heart disease and chronic disease. Meet the Exercise Medicine team and learn about Alex's and his family's experience in the program.\n\nWhat are the goals of the Exercise Medicine Program?\n\nOur goal is to help children and adolescents improve their health by reaching a level of physical activity/exercise they didn’t realize they could achieve. We want to empower them to participate in exercise and become more active and confident about their physical abilities.\n\nDuring the program we help our patients to find the right motivation, confidence, physical competence, and knowledge they need to include physical activity, sport or exercise into their daily routine for life. We want to help our patients to discover strengths and abilities they may not have known they possessed and to find joy in moving their bodies.\n\nWho can benefit from the Exercise Medicine Program?\n\nWe accept referrals for any child age 8 and older with a heart or chronic medical condition that might benefit from exercise and lifestyle counseling. We provide family-based lifestyle counseling, and we deliver individualized lifestyle programs that include recommendations for physical activity, sedentary behavior, nutritional habits and sleep hygiene.\n\nWhat to expect in the Exercise Medicine Program?\n\nEach patient undergoes a comprehensive medical evaluation including:\n\nBiometric Assessment - We record height, weight, body mass index (BMI) and body composition analysis result at the beginning and end of the program.\n\nCardiac Fitness Evaluation - We use either a bike test or walk test to evaluate patients' cardiac fitness. The results of the test are used to personalize our exercise plans.\n\nQuality of Movement and Muscle Strength Evaluation\n\nOur movement and strength assessment involves the performance of 5 basic exercises\n\nBy observing patients performing these simple movements the program's kinesiologist is able to evaluate the quality of their movement and their level of strength\n\nThe results of this evaluation are used to personalize our exercise plans\n\nQuestionnaires - Patients and their parents will be asked to complete quality of life and activity questionnaires\n\nOur Team\n\nContact Us\n\nFor more information, contact us atexercise.medicine@sickkids.ca\n\nUseful Resources\n\nBenefits & Guidelines: Children & Youth (5 to 17) | ParticipACTION\n\nHow to keep your child active | AboutKidsHealth\n\nThe Fetal Cardiac Program of the Labatt Family Heart Centre at The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) is made up of a multidisciplinary team that provides detailed evaluation, counseling and treatment for heart problems in the developing baby during pregnancy. We work closely with family doctors, midwives, community and high-risk obstetricians throughout Ontario, as well as geneticists and other pediatric subspecialists. We partner with Mount Sinai Hospital to provide a range of fetal therapy through the Ontario Fetal Centre. The Fetal Cardiac Program is a teaching program in affiliation with the University of Toronto.\n\nHeart problems in the developing baby may result from abnormal development of the heart (congenital heart disease), heart rhythm disturbances, complications from twin pregnancies, genetic conditions and health problems in the mother that affect the baby, including illness, medications and other exposures.\n\nThe goals of the Fetal Cardiac Program are to ensure that families receive the highest quality of care for potential heart problems during pregnancy; to advance our understanding of the evolution of heart disease in the developing baby; and to provide ongoing educational support to families and providers alike. We proudly serve as a local, national and international referral center for fetal cardiac care, research, and teaching.\n\nLearn about the Fetal Cardiac Program, including how to make a referral, clinic details, what to expect during a visit and more on our Clinic Directory.\n\nResearch\n\nResearch is one of the foundations of the Fetal Cardiac Program. Many of the advances in imaging and care for babies with heart problems during pregnancy have come from research and particularly from the internationally renowned research team at SickKids.\n\nDuring your visit, you may be approached regarding participation in a research project. Participation in any research is voluntary and will not affect the care you and your baby receive at SickKids.\n\nExamples of current projects include:\n\nFAST and SLOW trial/registry to understand fast and slow fetal rhythm problems\n\nFEAT Study to understand fetal Ebstein anomaly and other tricuspid valve disorders\n\nMaternal Hyperoxygenation and MATCH studies to assess the effects of acute and chronic oxygen delivery on heart and brain development\n\nTeaching\n\nThe Fetal Cardiac Program provides on-going education to sonographers, fellows, cardiologists, obstetricians, radiologists, geneticists, nurses, midwives and other allied health practitioners involved in the prenatal diagnosis and management of pregnancies affected with or at risk of fetal cardiac conditions.\n\nCourses and Symposiums\n\nWe offer both a one-day basic course and a 3-days advanced symposium. Both courses are submitted for review to the Canadian Paediatric Society for CME/MOC credits and Sonography Canada for CPD/CME/ARDMS credits.\n\nThe 1-day course provides information on normal cardiac anatomy, the recommended views to screen for major heart defects and those lesions that may be detected on a routine ultrasound examination. It is presented in an interactive format that encourages audience participation, including case presentations that allow individuals to test their knowledge level.\n\nThe 3-days advanced symposium provides more in-depth review and discussion of advances in fetal cardiology and care of the fetal cardiac patient and family. Lecturers and participants include local, national and international experts in Fetal Cardiology, High-Risk Maternal Fetal Medicine, Prenatal Diagnosis/Medical Genetics, and other allied health practitioners with interest and expertise in caring for this population.\n\nVisit www.torontofetalcardiaccourse.com for more info.\n\nFetal Cardiac Outreach Program\n\nThe Fetal Outreach Program also provides on-site training and education for diagnostic ultrasound laboratories evaluating women during pregnancy. This training is provided by a specialized member of our team.\n\nThe Core Paediatric Cardiology program at SickKids is designed as a three-year comprehensive training program in academic paediatric cardiology. Trainee wellness and a safe inclusive learning environment are at the core of our program. Our program is recognized by both the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada and the American Board of Pediatrics. We have transitioned fully to Competency by Design since 2020. Rotations are typically one month in duration. Protected research time occurs throughout the duration of training. Elective opportunities exist in a wide range of subspecialities and the option of electives outside the program exist.\n\nProgram structure\n\nFirst year\n\nThe first year of the program is focused primarily on clinical cardiology. Rotations include:\n\nInpatient cardiology\n\nCardiology consultations\n\nEchocardiography\n\nElectrophysiology\n\nMRI/CT\n\nOutpatient clinic\n\nResearch (1 month)\n\nCardiac Catheterization\n\nSecond year\n\nThe second year of training incorporates rotations in the cardiac ICU as well as additional training in the core disciplines of cardiology. Significant time is spent in research during the second year. Rotations include:\n\nCardiac ICU\n\nCardiac catheterization\n\nEchocardiography (including transesophageal and fetal)\n\nElectrophysiology\n\nHeart function and transplant\n\nLongitudinal outpatient clinic\n\nResearch (3 months)\n\nThird year\n\nThe third year of training solidifies training in the core disciplines as well as giving autonomy to the trainee in ‘senior trainee’ roles. Again, significant time is dedicated to elective and research time. Rotations include:\n\nInpatient cardiology (as a senior trainee)\n\nCardiac ICU\n\nEchocardiography (including TEE, fetal, review)\n\nElectrophysiology\n\nCardiac catheterization\n\nLongitudinal outpatient clinic\n\nAdult Congenital Cardiology (located in Toronto General Hospital)\n\nResearch/Elective (4 months)\n\nOn call\n\nIn-hospital on call is a requirement of the training program. We have a 24+2 hour on call rule (PARO guideline) meaning that you will have the day off following your on call. Third year trainees participate in echo back up on call to provide support for new first year trainees (home call). An on call stipend is provided.\n\nEvaluation\n\nWe have a robust system of assessment within the program with Competency Based medical education at the heart of our program.\n\nOur program has fully transitioned to Competency by Design (CBD) since 2020. Training is divided into four stages: Transition to discipline, Foundations of discipline, Core of discipline and, finally, Transition to practice. Trainees are evaluated based on Entrustable Professional Activities (EPAs) and In-Training Assessment Reports (ITARs). The competency committee meets regularly and reviews each trainees progress and determines their suitability to progress to the next stage of training. A faculty advisor provides feedback to the trainee following these meetings.\n\nTrainees from each year of core training are required to write the In-Training Examination of the American Board of Pediatrics at the beginning of each academic year. This gives candidates the opportunity to compare their knowledge with other individuals at the same level of training.\n\nElectronic In-Training Assessment Reports (ITARs) are automatically sent to the rotation supervisor at the end of each rotation. After the supervising cardiologist completes the electronic evaluation form, it is forwarded to the trainee who will review and sign it on-line. Faculty meet to discuss the evaluations with the trainees upon completion of the rotation.\n\nParticipation in Annual OSCE. Provides an opportunity to prepare for the Royal College certifying examination as well as receive feedback as to how they compare to their peers.\n\n1. I have applied, now what's next?\n\nOnce all applications have been reviewed, all candidates will be notified by the Education Coordinator of the status of their application.\n\n2. Do you fund international applicants?\n\nWe happily accept international applicants for both the Paediatric Cardiology Core Training Program and the Subspecialty Fellowship Program. Funding is available for a limited number of positions in each academic year.\n\nApplicants can also be externally funded by an outside institution, government, scholarship and/or grant. Please note, there is a strict requirement with the minimum salary required. A funding confirmation letter must be provided by the institution or scholarship immediately following acceptance into the program.\n\n3. What is it like working and living in Toronto?\n\nToronto is the largest city in Canada, and the fourth largest city in North America; with a population of 2.7 million people. Toronto is known for diversity and multiculturalism. The Greater Toronto Area, (GTA) is home to more than 180 languages and dialects and more then half our population was born outside Canada, making your time in Toronto a fascinating multicultural experience to remember!\n\nToronto has a lot to offer. Toronto is consistently ranked one of the safest and most livable cities in the world, making our city the perfect home away from home, for you and your family.\n\nToronto is home to a beautiful waterfront area steps away from the downtown core, perfect for biking, walking, and cycling. Come and visit one of our stunning parks, beaches, or take in other attractions such the iconic CN tower, Royal Ontario Museum or Casa Loma. It is also known for popular sporting events, shops, and restaurants in tourist areas like Yonge Street and the Distillery Historic District.\n\nWe invite you to come and experience life in Toronto!\n\nFetal Echocardiography Fellowship\n\nThe Fetal Cardiac Program in the Labatt Family Heart Centre offers a one-year comprehensive fetal fellowship for select candidates interested in a career in fetal cardiology. We are one of the largest fetal cardiac programs in the world with seven staff cardiologists and a team of dedicated nurses, sonographers, and administrative assistants. We perform more than 2,500 high-risk fetal echocardiograms per year and serve as a regional, national, and international referral centre.\n\nIn addition to daily fetal clinics at SickKids, we have two daily clinics per week to perform first trimester fetal echocardiograms at Mount Sinai Hospital alongside our maternal-fetal medicine colleagues. Through the Ontario Fetal Centre, which is a collaboration between SickKids and Mount Sinai, we are the only program in Canada to offer percutaneous fetal cardiac intervention. Additionally, we are one of few centres in the world to perform fetal cardiac MRI, both for clinical and research purposes. Our world-class Genetics team also provides unique opportunities for collaboration and teaching, as well as research avenues through the Cardiac Genome Clinic.\n\nFellows are exposed to all members of our multi-disciplinary team. There is an abundance of educational opportunities, including weekly case-based teaching; weekly provincial fetal cardiology rounds, which includes journal clubs, pathology rounds, and M&M conferences; and monthly multi-disciplinary perinatal rounds. Beyond the clinical and educational offerings, fellows typically complete at least one research project during the year with our productive fetal cardiology staff.\n\nThe fetal fellowship is generously supported by the Policaro Family.\n\nStaff\n\nDr. Lindsay Freud (Section Head, Fetal Cardiac Program)\n\nDr. Vitor Guerra\n\nDr. Mike Seed (Division Head, Cardiology)\n\nDr. Shi-Joon Yoo\n\nElectrophysiology Fellowship\n\nThe Paediatric Cardiac Electrophysiology program trains fellows to achieve excellence in all areas of paediatric arrhythmia management. Trainees develop expertise in the diagnosis and management of arrhythmias disorders in children with and without congenital heart disease. This will include invasive and noninvasive testing, as well as medical management, device implantation and management, and catheter ablation.\n\nPCEP fellows participate in both inpatient and outpatient settings learning to diagnose and manage the full breadth of electrophysiologic conditions. Fellows gain increasing responsibility while learning the management and natural history of a wide variety of cardiac arrhythmias.\n\nFellows are involved in all EP procedures, and given increasing responsibility in the EP laboratory. Procedures include diagnostic EP studies and catheter ablation for supraventricular and ventricular tachycardias. They are involved in pacemaker, ICD, and cardiac resynchronization therapy device implantations both in the cath lab and in the operating room in conjunction with cardiac surgery for epicardial procedures. Fellows also participate in non-invasive procedures such as cardioversions and device tests. Fellows consult on patients with arrhythmias and implanted devices in the intensive care units and other inpatient units.\n\nIn the outpatient arena, EP fellows spend a minimum of a half-day each week in one of the arrhythmia outpatient clinics, as well as covering the pacemaker clinic. The fellows rotate among each of the EP faculty clinics, thus affording trainees the opportunity to observe and manage patients longitudinally, and to gain experience with different management styles. They read ECG, exercise tests and Holter monitors under the guidance of the EP staff.\n\nThe fellowship is designed to provide trainees with a broad educational experience. In addition to the extensive direct clinical exposure, a variety of educational opportunities are provided during the fellowship. A weekly EP service meeting, attended by all EP faculty and fellows, is used for teaching, discussion of recent cases and complications, as well as upcoming cases in both the cath lab and the operating room. Outpatient consults and challenging cases are also brought to this forum for review and management planning. Fellows attend two monthly meetings on inherited arrhythmia, one reviewing internal cases and one reviewing shared families with our adult partners at Toronto General Hospital. Fellow also present teaching to core cardiology fellows and paediatric residents on a monthly basis.\n\nFaculty for the PCEP Program\n\nDr. Elizabeth Stephenson (Section Head, Electrophysiology)\n\nDr. Anica Bulic\n\nDr. Robert Hamilton\n\nHeart Function and Heart Transplantation\n\nWe offer 1 year of advanced training in cardiomyopathy, heart function, and heart transplantation with a robust ventricular assist device (VAD) program.\n\nThe Cardiomyopathy & Heart Function (CHF) program has been an integral section to the Division of Cardiology since 2005. The CHF program provides expertise in delivering both inpatient and outpatient care for children with all types of cardiomyopathies and those with congenital heart disease and end-stage heart failure. We are participants in the multicenter ACTION learning network and actively involved in heart failure device and drug trials.\n\nThe Heart Transplant Program at Sickkids was initiated in 1989 and has done over 380 heart transplants across the paediatric age spectrum. We have been pioneers in the role of ABO incompatible heart transplantation in children. We represent the largest pediatric heart transplant program in Canada and are active members of the multicenter collaboration Pediatric Heart Transplant Society (PHTS). Fellows in the program have the opportunity to learn about the diagnostic fundamentals and clinical management of pediatric heart transplant patients, infectious/oncological complications in immunocompromised patients, and challenges around allosensitization.\n\nThe Heart Transplant & CHF programs run regular interdisciplinary clinics each week as well as additional specialty clinics for Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy, Friedreich’s Ataxia, and a regular cardiomyopathy screening clinic for children with affected family members. We also provide cardiac care for children with neuromuscular diseases, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and for children who have undergone chemotherapy for childhood cancers. In addition, the program runs a robust home inotrope program and is responsible for the care of children requiring ventricular assist devices. We currently support children with both pulsatile and continuous flow VADs.\n\nThe Heart Transplant & CHF teams are comprised of pediatric cardiologists, cardiovascular surgeons, nurse practitioners, dietitians, social workers, child life, occupational and physical therapists, pharmacists, genetic counselors, amongst others.\n\nFrom a research standpoint, the Heart Transplant & CHF program are at the forefront of innovation with ongoing participation in a number of research activities that include novel drug trials, multi-centre registry participation, advanced genomics and stem cell research, Cardiac Precision Medicine, digital technology, and quality improvement efforts. Fellows in the program have multiple opportunities to participate in research activities during their training.\n\nStaff\n\nDr. Aamir Jeewa (Section Head, Heart Function)\n\nDr. Anne Dipchand (Section Head, Heart Transplantation)\n\nDr. Alyssa Power\n\nDr. Seema Mital\n\nElectives are available within the Division of Cardiology in general paediatric cardiology (aimed at medical students and paediatric residents with an interest in pursuing a career in cardiology) and in subspecialities (aimed at learners currently enrolled in paediatric cardiology training programs in Canada).
