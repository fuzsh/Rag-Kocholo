        "text": "Overview\n\nThis information is for a general audience. Healthcare professionals should see Underlying Medical Conditions Associated with Higher Risk for Severe COVID-19 for more detailed information.\n\nStay Up to Date With COVID-19 Vaccines‎\n\nStaying up to date with COVID-19 vaccines and following preventive measures are especially important if you are older or have one or more health conditions, including those listed below.\n\nCOVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective\n\nIf you have one or more of the conditions listed below, you are more likely to get very sick from COVID-19 and be hospitalized, need intensive care, require a ventilator to breathe, and/or die.\n\nRisk factors for getting very sick with COVID-19\n\nOlder adults are at highest risk of getting very sick from COVID-19. More than 81% of COVID-19 deaths occur in people over age 65. The number of deaths among people over age 65 is 97 times higher than among people ages 18-29 years.\n\nYour risk of severe illness from COVID-19 increases as the number of your underlying medical conditions increase.\n\nSome people are at increased risk of getting very sick or dying from COVID-19 because of where they live or work, or because they can’t get health care. This includes many people from racial and ethnic minority groups and people with disabilities.\n\nSpecific information on children and teens\n\nPeople of all ages, including children and teens, can get very sick from COVID-19, especially those with underlying medical conditions. This includes children and teens with:\n\nMedical complexity\n\nGenetic, neurologic, or metabolic conditions\n\nCongenital heart disease\n\nLike adults, children and teens with obesity, diabetes, asthma or chronic lung disease, sickle cell disease, or who are immunocompromised can also be at increased risk for getting very sick from COVID-19. Check out COVID-19 Vaccines for Children and Teens for more information on vaccinating your child.\n\nLearn how CDC develops COVID-19 vaccination recommendations.\n\nContact Your Healthcare Provider‎\n\nIf you have questions about a condition not included on this list or questions on how to manage your condition and protect yourself from COVID-19 and severe illness.\n\nFor treatment options. You must start treatment within 5-7 days from the time your symptoms start. Treatment can reduce your risk of hospitalization by more than 50% and reduce your risk of death.\n\nYou can also visit a Test to Treat location.\n\nConditions that can increase risk\n\nThe conditions on this list are in alphabetical order. They are not in order of risk.\n\nCDC reviewed each medical condition on this list to ensure they met criteria for inclusion. If there is new evidence, other conditions might be added to the list.\n\nThis list does not include all medical conditions that place a person at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19. Rare medical conditions, including many conditions that mostly affect children, may not be included.\n\nA person with a condition that is not listed may still be at greater risk of getting very sick from COVID-19 than other people. It is important to talk with your healthcare provider about your risk.\n\nHaving the following diseases, conditions, or behaviors can make you more likely to get very sick from COVID-19.\n\nCancer\n\nTreatments for many types of cancer can weaken your body's ability to fight off disease.\n\nGet more information:\n\nCancer\n\nCOVID-19: What People with Cancer Should Know – National Cancer Institute\n\nCerebrovascular disease\n\nIncluding stroke which affects blood flow to the brain.\n\nGet more information:\n\nStroke\n\nChronic kidney disease (at any stage)\n\nGet more information:\n\nChronic Kidney Disease\n\nNational Kidney Foundation: Kidney Disease and COVID-19\n\nChronic liver disease\n\nThis includes alcohol-related liver disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, autoimmune hepatitis, and cirrhosis (or scarring of the liver).\n\nGet more information:\n\nLiver Disease\n\nAmerican Liver Foundation: Your Liver and COVID-19\n\nChronic lung disease\n\nChronic lung disease can include:\n\nAsthma (moderate to severe)\n\nBronchiectasis (thickening of the lungs' airways)\n\nBronchopulmonary dysplasia (chronic lung disease affecting newborns)\n\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including emphysema and chronic bronchitis\n\nDamaged or scarred lung tissue (interstitial lung disease including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis)\n\nPulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lungs)\n\nPulmonary hypertension (high blood pressure in the lungs)\n\nGet more information:\n\nCOPD\n\nAsthma\n\nPeople with Moderate to Severe Asthma\n\nAmerican Lung Association: Controlling Chronic Lung Diseases Amid COVID-19\n\nCystic fibrosis\n\nWith or without lung or other solid organ transplant (like kidney, liver, intestines, heart, and pancreas).\n\nGet more information:\n\nCystic fibrosis\n\nCystic Fibrosis Foundation: CF and Coronavirus (COVID-19)\n\nDementia or other neurological conditions\n\nGet more information:\n\nDementia\n\nAlzheimer's Association: COVID-19, Alzheimer's and Dementia\n\nDiabetes (type 1 or type 2)\n\nGet more information:\n\nDiabetes\n\nAmerican Diabetes Association: How COVID-19 Impacts People with Diabetes\n\nDisabilities\n\nPeople with some types of disabilities may be more likely to get very sick from COVID-19 because of underlying medical conditions, living in congregate settings, or systemic health and social inequities, including:\n\nPeople with any type of disability that makes it more difficult to do certain activities or interact with the world around them, including people who need help with self-care or daily activities\n\nPeople with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)\n\nPeople with cerebral palsy\n\nPeople with birth defects\n\nPeople with intellectual and developmental disabilities\n\nPeople with learning disabilities\n\nPeople with spinal cord injuries\n\nPeople with Down syndrome\n\nGet more information:\n\nPeople with Disabilities\n\nHeart conditions\n\nThis includes heart failure, coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathies, and possibly high blood pressure (hypertension).\n\nGet more information:\n\nHeart Disease\n\nAmerican Heart Association: COVID-19\n\nNHLBI Information and Resources on COVID-19\n\nHemoglobin blood disorders\n\nGet more information:\n\nSickle Cell Disease\n\nThalassemia\n\nHIV infection (Human Immunodeficiency Virus)\n\nGet more information:\n\nHIV Infection\n\nInterim Guidance for COVID-19 and Persons with HIV\n\nImmunocompromised condition or weakened immune system\n\nPeople who are immunocompromised or are taking medicines that weaken their immune system may not be protected even if they are up to date on their vaccines.
