        "text": "What is yellow fever?\n\nYellow fever is a serious disease caused by the yellow fever virus.\n\nMost people infected with yellow fever virus do not get sick or have only mild symptoms. People who do get sick will start having symptoms (e.g., fever, chills, headache, backache, and muscle aches) 3–6 days after they are infected. About 12% of people who have symptoms go on to develop serious illness: jaundice, bleeding, shock, organ failure, and sometimes death.\n\nHow does yellow fever spread?\n\nYellow fever virus is spread by mosquitoes.\n\nWho is at risk?\n\nYellow fever virus, and the mosquitoes that spread the virus, are found in certain parts of South America and Africa. Travelers going to these places are at risk for infection with the virus. Check to see if yellow fever vaccine is recommended or required for your destination.\n\nWhat can travelers do to protect themselves?\n\nGet the yellow fever vaccine and take steps to prevent mosquito bites.\n\nYellow Fever Vaccine: Requirements and Recommendations\n\nSome countries may require arriving travelers to show proof of yellow fever vaccination. Countries do this as a public health measure to keep travelers from importing the virus. Proof of vaccination requirements may apply to some or all arriving travelers. CDC has no control over other countries’ vaccine requirements or how they are enforced.\n\nSeparate from the individual country requirements, CDC makes yellow fever vaccine recommendations for travelers going to countries where there is a risk of yellow fever. CDC recommendations are designed to help keep individuals from getting infected with yellow fever virus during travel.\n\nCheck your destination(s) for yellow fever vaccination requirements and recommendations.\n\nYellow Fever Vaccine: Getting Vaccinated\n\nVisit a yellow fever vaccination clinic. Ask the health care provider at the clinic to confirm if vaccination against yellow fever is required and/or recommended for your destination(s).\n\nPlan to get the vaccine at least 10 days before your travel since proof of vaccination is not valid until 10 days after getting the vaccine, the time needed to develop immunity to yellow fever virus.\n\nA single dose of yellow fever vaccine protects most people for life, but a booster dose after 10 years may be recommended for some travelers. Talk to your health care provider for more information.\n\nIn rare cases, yellow fever vaccine can have serious and sometimes fatal side effects. People older than 60 years and people with weakened immune systems might be at higher risk of developing these side effects. Also, there are concerns for the babies of pregnant and nursing women who receive yellow fever vaccine. Before you get vaccinated against yellow fever, discuss your full medical history with your health care provider who can help inform you about the possible risks involved.\n\nYellow Fever Vaccine: Proof of Vaccination\n\nThe International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis (ICVP, sometimes called the “yellow card”) is your proof that you have been vaccinated against yellow fever. You will receive the ICVP when you get vaccinated. Along with your passport, present the original signed and stamped ICVP (not a photocopy or screenshot) to immigration officials in all countries requiring proof of vaccination.\n\nPrevent mosquito bites:\n\nAfter Travel\n\nMore Information"
