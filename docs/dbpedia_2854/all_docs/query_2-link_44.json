The composition of these units is as set forth in Appendix I of this Agreement – Bargaining Units Represented by the Service Employees International Union, Local 925, hereinafter referred to as the Union.\n\n1.2.

The employee may also choose to report the incident utilizing the bias reporting tool (Reporting Bias Incidents (washington.edu) or UW Medicine Bias Reporting Tool | Care Transformation (washington.edu)). The goal of local resolution is to address and resolve problems as quickly as possible and to stop any inappropriate behavior for which any University employee is responsible. A formal complaint may be filed with the Civil Rights Investigation Office. Employees may also file discrimination, harassment or retaliation complaints with appropriate federal or state agencies or through the grievance process in accordance with Article 6 of this Agreement. In cases where an employee files both a grievance and an internal complaint regarding the alleged discrimination, harassment or retaliation the grievance will be suspended until the internal complaint process has been completed.\n\nIn accordance with Executive Order 31, retaliation against any individual who reports concerns regarding discrimination or harassment, or who cooperates with or participates in any investigation of allegations of discrimination, harassment, or retaliation is prohibited.\n\n2.4.The parties also agree that they will not engage in any act or practice or pursue any policy which is discriminatory against any employee based on political affiliation, political belief or because of the participation or lack of participation in union activities.\n\n2.5.

The University and the Union are committed to providing reasonable accommodation to employees with disabilities.\n\n3.2. An employee who believes that they suffer a disability and requires a reasonable accommodation to perform the essential functions of their position may request such an accommodation through the Disability Services Office (https://hr.uw.edu/policies/disability-accommodation/) or otherwise informing the employee’s supervisor and/or department of the need for accommodation.\n\n3.3. Employees requesting accommodation must cooperate with the University in discussing the need for and possible form of any accommodation. The Employer may require supporting medical documentation and may require the employee to obtain a second medical opinion at Employer expense. Medical information disclosed to the Employer will be kept confidential.\n\n3.4. The Employer will determine whether an employee is eligible for a reasonable accommodation and the final form of any accommodation to be provided.\n\n3.5. An employee who is unable to perform the essential function of their position due to disability may be separated from service after the Employer has made good faith efforts to reasonably accommodate the employee’s disability in accordance with applicable state and federal law. Disability separation is not a corrective action.\n\n3.6. Disability Leave. Disability leave may be a combination of the employee’s accrued sick time off, vacation time off, personal holiday, compensatory time, and/or unpaid time off, the combination of which may be determined by the employee. If disability leave is taken as an unpaid absence, the employee may apply eight (8) hours of accrued paid time off per month during at least the first four (4) months of disability leave to provide for continuation of employer paid health benefits.

The Employer and the Union will comply with all relevant federal and state laws, regulations, and executive orders and with the provisions of Washington Administrative Policy Statement 46.7 Reasonable Accommodation of Pregnant Employees. The University and the Union are committed to providing reasonable accommodation to pregnant employees.\n\nThe following pregnancy-related accommodations shall not require health care provider certification and are not subject to an employer’s claim of undue hardship:\n\nProviding more frequent, longer, or flexible restroom breaks;\n\nModifying a no food or drink policy;\n\nProviding seating or allowing the employee to sit more frequently if their job requires them to stand; and\n\nRestricting lifting to 17 lbs. or less.\n\nAn employee’s pregnancy or pregnancy-related health condition may also be accommodated as follows:\n\nJob restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant position, or acquiring or modifying equipment, devices, or an employee’s work station;\n\nProviding for a temporary transfer to a less strenuous or less hazardous position;\n\nProviding assistance with manual labor and limits on lifting;\n\nScheduling flexibility for prenatal visits; and\n\nAny further pregnancy accommodation an employee may request.\n\nWith respect to these accommodations, the University may request an employee provide written certification from their treating health care provider regarding the need for reasonable accommodation and may deny an employee’s request for reasons of significant difficulty or expense.\n\nReturn to top\n\nArticle 4 – Workplace Behavior\n\nThe Employer and the Union agree that all employees should work in an environment that fosters mutual respect and professionalism. The parties agree that inappropriate behavior in the workplace does not promote the University’s business, employee well being, or productivity. All employees are responsible for contributing to such an environment and are expected to treat others with courtesy and respect.\n\nInappropriate workplace behavior by employees, supervisors and/or managers will not be tolerated. At no time will bullying be accepted as appropriate workplace behavior. Bullying is defined as language or conduct that is unwelcome and sufficiently severe, persistent, or pervasive such that it could reasonably be expected to create an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment, or has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an employee’s work performance, when viewed through both an objective and subjective standard. If an employee and/or the employee’s union representative believes the employee has been subjected to inappropriate workplace behavior, the employee and/or the employee’s representative is encouraged to report this behavior to the employee’s supervisor, a manager in the employee’s chain of command and/or the Human Resources Office. For incidents involving alleged bias, the employee may also choose to report the incident utilizing the bias reporting tool (Reporting Bias Incidents (washington.edu) or UW Medicine Bias Reporting Tool I Care Transformation\n\n(washington.edu)). The Employer will investigate the reported behavior and take appropriate action as necessary, which may include training for the individual(s) or the department involved in the incident. The employee and/or union representative will be notified upon conclusion of the investigation.\n\nRetaliation against employees who make a workplace behavior complaint will not be tolerated and will be viewed as a separate violation.\n\nGrievances may be filed up to Step 3 Mediation.\n\nReturn to top\n\nArticle 5 – Affirmative Action\n\n5.1. Policies.

The Employer shall implement, monitor, and report on an affirmative action program requiring the Employer to make special efforts to recruit, employ, retain, train, promote, encourage career development, and transfer qualified members of underrepresented or groups formerly excluded, even if that exclusion cannot be traced to particular discriminatory actions on the part of the Employer. The Employer shall also develop or update, implement, monitor, and report on affirmative action goals for hiring and/or promoting members of protected groups into job classes/categories where it has been determined that underrepresentation exists. The\n\nEmployer shall make no decisions regarding employment based on membership in any protected class.\n\n5.2.

Whenever possible, disputes should be resolved informally prior to filing a formal written grievance. To that end, all supervisors and employees are encouraged to engage in free and open discussions about disputes.\n\n6.1. Definition. A grievance, within the meaning of this Agreement, shall be defined as any dispute between the University and the Union, an employee, or a group of employees as to alleged misapplication or misinterpretation of the terms of this Agreement or the Employer’s written personnel rules, policies or practices.\n\n6.2. Employee Grievance Rights. Any employee who believes they have been aggrieved may personally seek relief from that condition by filing a grievance, irrespective of any supervisor’s opinion of the grievance’s validity. In the presentation of grievances, the employees shall be safe from restraint, interference, discrimination, or reprisal.\n\n6.3. Employee Representation. The Union as exclusive representative of bargaining unit employees is the responsible representative of said employees in grievance matters.\n\n6.4. Time Limitations. An extension of the time limitations as stipulated in the respective steps below, may be obtained by mutual consent of the parties. Failure of the union to comply with the time limitations without a request of time extension shall constitute withdrawal of the grievance. Failure of the Employer to comply with the time limitations without a request for time extension shall move the grievance to the next step of the grievance procedure. For the purpose of calculating time requirements, the first day shall be the day following the day on which the employee was aware, or reasonably should have been aware, of the issue giving rise to the grievance. Saturdays, Sundays, and University holidays shall be included in the calculation of days except that the final day may not be on a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday but will end at the close of the first working day following the Saturday, Sunday, or holiday.\n\n6.5. Contents. The written grievance shall include the following information:\n\nThe date upon which the grievance occurred.\n\nThe specific Article(s) and Section(s) of the Agreement violated.\n\nThe past practice, rule, policy violated.\n\nSpecific remedy requested.\n\nThe grievant(s) name.\n\nName and signature of Union representative (Staff or Steward).\n\nThe nature of the grievance.\n\nFailure to include the above information shall not be a reason for invalidating the grievance.\n\n6.6. Pay Status – Meetings. Meetings and discussions on the grievance held with the Employer in connection with this grievance procedure shall normally be held during the University’s regular business hours, or as mutually agreeable, and no deduction in pay status shall be made for the grievant or steward for reasonable time spent in such meetings or discussions during the employee’s scheduled duty hours. The work schedule of the grievant will be seriously considered in the scheduling of the grievance meetings. Time off for employees and stewards shall be granted by supervision following a request, but in consideration of job responsibilities. If the requested time off cannot be granted, the parties shall arrange for time off at the earliest possible time thereafter.\n\n6.7. Grievance Withdrawal. A grievance may be withdrawn by the Union in writing at any time, and if withdrawn shall not be resubmitted.\n\n6.8. Resolution. If the Employer provides the requested remedy or a mutually agreed-upon alternative, the grievance will be considered resolved and may not be moved to the next step.\n\n6.9. Consolidation. Grievances arising out of the same set of facts may be consolidated by written agreement.\n\n6.10. Filing and Processing.\n\nFiling. A grievance must be filed within thirty (30) days of the occurrence giving rise to the grievance, or the date the grievant knew or could reasonably have known of the occurrence. When possible the thirty (30) day periods above should be used to attempt to informally resolve the dispute. The union steward or staff representative will indicate when a discussion with the Employer is an attempt to informally resolve a dispute.\n\nAlternative Resolution Methods. Alternative Resolution Methods Any time during the grievance process, by mutual consent, the parties may use alternative methods to resolve the dispute. If the parties agree to use alternative methods, the time frames in this Article are suspended. If the selected alternative method does not result in a resolution, the Union may return to the grievance process and the time frames resume. Any expenses and fees of alternative methods will be shared equally by the parties.\n\nProcessing. The Union and the Employer agree that in-person meetings are preferred at all steps of the grievance process and will make efforts to schedule in-person meetings, if possible.\n\n6.11. Steps of the grievance Procedure. All grievances shall be processed in accordance with the following procedure. Upon mutual agreement, Step One, Two or Three may be skipped. Grievances over final counseling or dismissal will begin at Step Two.\n\nStep One: Supervisor, Manager or Designee. If the issue is not resolved informally, the Union may file a written grievance to the supervisor or designee, and the Labor Relations office (laborrel@uw.edu). The Employer will designate a supervisor, manager or designee who will meet in person or confer by telephone with a union steward and/or staff representative and the grievant. The date of the meeting will be mutually agreed upon within fifteen (15) calendar days of receipt of the grievance and when possible the meeting will take place within the aforementioned fifteen (15) calendar days. The format (face to face or by telephone) for the meeting will be by mutual agreement. The employer will respond in writing to the Union within fifteen (15) calendar days after the meeting. The Human Resources Consultant may also attend, if desired by the University. If the grievance is directed against the employee’s immediate supervisor, the grievance may be presented to the next higher level of supervision. In the event the employee’s immediate supervisor does not have authority to resolve the grievance, the grievance will be presented at the level having authority to act as determined by the Employer.\n\nStep Two: If a satisfactory settlement is not reached in Step One, said grievance may be moved to the Step Two by filing the written grievance, including a copy of the Step One decision to department head, designee, or to the next appropriate level of management and the Office of Labor Relations within fifteen (15) calendar days after the decision from Step One. The date of the meeting will be mutually agreed upon within fifteen (15) calendar days after notice of the filing at Step Two and when possible the meeting will take place within the aforementioned fifteen (15) calendar days. The grievant may be represented by a steward and a Union staff representative. The University will be represented by the appropriate management official(s) or designee(s), a representative from the Office of Labor Relations, and a Human Resources Consultant, if desired by the University. The University will respond in writing within thirty (30) calendar days after the meeting.\n\nStep Three: Grievance Mediation. Grievance Mediation. If the grievance is not resolved at the Step Two, the Union may file a request for mediation with the Public Employment Relations Commission (PERC) in accordance with WAC 391-55-020, with a copy to the Labor Relations Office within thirty (30) days of receipt of the Step Two decision. In addition to all other filing requirements, the request must include a copy of the grievance and all previous responses. The Employer will inform the Union, in writing, and PERC within thirty (30) days of receipt of Mediation request if they are not in agreement. If those services are unavailable on a timely basis, the parties may request a list of grievance mediators from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) or other agreed upon mediation provider. The cost of the mediation shall be borne equally by both parties.\n\nStep Four: Arbitration. If a satisfactory settlement is not reached at the prior step, or the step was skipped, either of the signatory parties to this Agreement may submit the grievance to binding arbitration. Such submittal must be made within thirty (30) calendar days following the written notice that the employer does not agree to Step Three (3) Mediation or the conclusion of the prior step.\n\nPanel of Arbitrators:\n\nWithin sixty (60) calendar days of the execution of the Agreement, the parties, SEIU 925, WFSE 1488, and the Employer, agree to meet to establish a permanent panel of six (6) arbitrators. If the parties do not meet or if there is no agreement on the panel, the current panel will remain.\n\nThese arbitrators shall be assigned cases by the parties on a rotating basis. If the arbitrator is not available to hear the case within sixty (60) calendar days of being contacted to request available arbitration dates either party may elect to go to the next arbitrator in the rotation. If no arbitrator can hear the case within sixty (60) calendar days of being contacted, the case will be assigned to the arbitrator who can hear the case on the earliest date.\n\nThe appointment to the panel will be for the life of the Agreement. If an arbitrator decides to remove their name from the panel the parties will meet to decide whether to substitute an additional name(s).\n\nNo later than seven (7) working days prior to the scheduled arbitration meeting, the parties will submit questions of arbitration eligibility to the arbitrator for preliminary determination, share the name of each witness intending to testify at the hearing, and attempt to agree upon the issue statement. A copy of written materials submitted to the arbitrator will be provided to the opposing party.\n\nIf either party raises an issue of procedural arbitrability, i.e. that any step of the grievance process or movement to arbitration was not pursued within the time limits proscribed in this article, the arbitrator shall make a determination on the arbitrability issue prior to proceeding to a hearing on the merits of the grievance. If the arbitrator determines the grievance is not arbitrable, then no hearing on the merits of the grievance will be held.\n\nAuthority of the Arbitrator\n\nThe parties agree that the arbitrator shall have no power to render a decision that adds to, subtracts from, alters or modifies in any way the terms and conditions of the Agreement. The parties further agree that the decision of the arbitrator will be final and binding upon all parties.\n\nThe Union or the Employer will have the right to request the arbitrator to require the presence of witnesses and/or documents. The arbitrator’s decision shall be made in writing and the arbitrator shall be encouraged to render the decision within thirty (30) calendar days of the close of the arbitration.\n\nIn cases where a grievance is moved to arbitration and the Employer did not agree to Step Three: Grievance Mediation, either party may request a pre-arbitration settlement conference. These conferences shall not delay the arbitration process, and may be held with or without the presence of the arbitrator, at the option of the moving party. In the event that an arbitrator is present, the cost of the arbitrator’s participation shall be borne equally by the parties.\n\n6.12. Arbitration Costs.\n\nThe fees and costs of the arbitrator, and the cost (if any) of the hearing room, will be shared equally by the parties.\n\nIf the arbitration hearing is postponed or canceled because of one party, that party will bear the cost of the postponement or cancellation. The costs of any mutually agreed upon postponements or cancellations will be shared equally by the parties.\n\nIf either party desires a record of the arbitration, a court reporter may be used. If that party purchases a transcript, a copy will be provided to the arbitrator free of charge. If the other party desires a copy of the transcript, it will pay for half of the costs of the fee for the court reporter, the original transcript and a copy.\n\nEach party is responsible for all fees and costs of its staff representatives, attorneys, experts, witnesses –and all other costs related to the development and presentation of their case. Every effort will be made to avoid the presentation of repetitive witnesses.\n\n6.13. Files. Grievance documents shall be maintained separately from employee personnel files. Employee personnel files will accurately reflect the final outcome of a grievance.\n\nReturn to top\n\nArticle 7 – Employee Rights\n\n7.1. Representation. Upon request, an employee will have the right to representation at an investigatory meeting, requested by management in which the employee reasonably believes could lead to corrective action. Upon request, an employee will have the right to an interpreter at an investigatory meeting. The employer will provide reasonable time to allow an employee to secure a representative. The exercise of this right will not unreasonably delay or postpone a meeting. Except as otherwise specified in this Agreement, representation will not apply to discussions with an employee in the normal course of duty, such as giving instructions, assigning work, informal discussions, delivery of paperwork, staff or work unit meetings or other routine communications with an employee.\n\n7.2. Paid Release Time. Employees will be provided a reasonable amount of time during their normal working hours to meet with the union steward and/or staff representative to process a grievance. In addition, employees will be released during their normal working hours to attend meetings or hearings scheduled by management for the following:\n\nInformal grievance resolution meetings, grievance meetings, alternative dispute resolution meetings, mediation sessions and arbitration hearings, in accordance with Article 6, Grievance Procedure, and held during the employee’s work time;\n\nManagement scheduled investigatory interviews and/or pre-disciplinary meetings, in accordance with Article 36, Corrective Action, and;\n\nNegotiations in accordance with Article 40, Mandatory Subjects.\n\nJoint Labor Management meetings in accordance with Article 43.\n\n7.3. When an employee is subpoenaed as a witness on behalf of the Union in an arbitration case, with the employer, the employee may appear without loss of pay if the employee appears during scheduled work time, providing the testimony given is related to their own job function or involves matters they have witnessed, and is relevant to the arbitration case. Every effort will be made to avoid the presentation of repetitive witnesses.\n\n7.4. Notification. An employee will obtain prior approval from their supervisor before attending any meeting or hearing. All requests must include the approximate amount of time the employee expects the activity to take. Employees will suffer no loss in pay for attending management scheduled meetings and hearings that are scheduled during the employee’s work time. Attendance at meetings or hearings during the employee’s non-work hours will not be considered as time worked. An employee cannot use a state vehicle to travel to and from a worksite in order to attend a meeting or hearing unless authorized by the Employer.\n\n7.5. Indemnification. The University will indemnify employees for activities arising out of their employment in accordance with University policy.\n\n7.6. Off the Job Activities. The private and personal “off the job” lifestyle and activities of any employee shall not be legitimate grounds for corrective action initiated by Management except where such life style or activities, constitute a conflict of interest as set forth in RCW 42.18 or are detrimental to the employee’s work performance.\n\n7.7. Off Duty Employment. Employees may engage in off duty employment that is consistent with University policy and state law to include Administrative Policy Statement on Outside Consulting Activities and Part-Time Employment by Professional or Classified Staff Employees (APS 47.3).\n\nReturn to top\n\nArticle 8 – Employee Facilities\n\n8.1. Employee Facilities. Adequate lunchroom, washroom and toilet facilities shall be provided and available for the use of the employees. Suitable dressing rooms and/or lockers shall be provided to employees in those occupations where a change of clothing is required by the Employer.\n\nEmployees are encouraged to report to supervision any condition in employee facilities which appear to be below minimum standards.\n\nThe adequacy of employee facilities, including sanitary supply dispensers, wellness rooms, lactation stations, all gender bathrooms, or any change in employee facilities, shall be a proper subject for discussion by the Joint Union-Management Committee.\n\nRegarding the use of Gender Segregated Facilities:\n\nFacility use. The Employer shall allow individuals the use of gender-segregated facilities, such as restrooms, locker rooms, and dressing rooms that are consistent with that individual’s gender expression or gender identity.\n\nIn such facilities where undressing in the presence of others occurs, The Employer shall allow access to and use of a facility consistent with that individual’s gender expression or gender identity.\n\nThe Employer shall not request or require an individual to use a gender-segregated facility that is inconsistent with that individual’s gender expression or gender identity, or request or require an individual to use a separate or gender-neutral facility.\n\nIf another person expresses concern or discomfort about a person who uses a facility that is consistent with the person’s gender expression or gender identity, the person expressing discomfort should be directed to a separate or gender-neutral facility, if available.\n\nAny action taken against a person who is using a restroom or other gender-segregated facility, such as removing a person, should be taken due to that person’s actions or behavior while in the facility, and must be unrelated to gender expression or gender identity. The same standards of conduct and behavior must be consistently applied to all facility users, regardless of gender expression or gender identity.\n\nProvision of options encouraged. Whenever feasible, the Employer will provide options for privacy, such as single-use gender-neutral bathrooms or private changing areas that are available to any individual desiring privacy.\n\nReturn to top\n\nArticle 9 – Hours of Work\n\n9.1.

Operational necessity or employee convenience may require positions that are normally designated regular work schedule to work an alternate forty (40) hour work schedule (other than five (5) uniform and consecutive eight (8) hour days in a seven (7) day period), or as provided by the Washington State Minimum Wage Requirements and Labor Standards in conjunction with the federal law which provides for an eighty (80) hour work week in a fourteen (14) day period for hospital personnel.\n\nNonscheduled Work Period. The nonscheduled work period designation applies to those positions for which the hours cannot be scheduled but which are assigned an FTE, work a forty (40) hour week and do not meet any of the other work period designations.\n\nPart-time Schedule. This is any deviation from any full-time schedule which includes less than forty (40) hours per week in seven (7) consecutive days; or for designated hospital personnel less than eighty (80) hours in a fourteen (14) day period.\n\nSplit Shifts.\n\nEmployees will not be assigned to split shifts unless there is prior agreement.\n\n9.6. Change in Work Schedule/Shift Assignment Notification. The Employer agrees to provide a minimum of fourteen (14) calendar days’ notice to an employee in the event of an Employer-directed permanent change in the employee’s shift assignment or work schedule. For temporary changes in work assignment occurring within the employee’s assigned work week, the Employer will provide two (2) calendar days’ notice with the day of notification constituting the first day of notice. For emergency reasons, lack of work, an existing safety hazard to the employee or others, or mutual agreement between the Employer and employee under Article 10.2(e), the Employer may temporarily change an employee’s schedule with fewer than two (2) calendar days’ notice. Temporary is defined as no longer than one (1) week.\n\nSpecific to the University-wide Nonsupervisory, Supervisory, and Health Care Professional/Laboratory Technical bargaining units: Temporary shift changes not mutually agreed to shall not be employed to avoid the accrual of overtime.\n\nThe assignment of employees in various shifts within each work group or department shall be determined by the employing official, provided that when qualifications are substantially equal in the judgment of the employing department, seniority shall be a factor in determining shift assignment. This criteria does not apply to positions deemed by the employer to require a rotational shift.\n\n9.7. Excepted Work Period Positions. Employees assigned to excepted work period positions normally do not qualify for overtime pay. However, when an employing official determines that the employee has been directed to work an excessive amount of hours for an extended period of time, overtime in the form of compensatory time or cash not to exceed a “time and one half (1-1/2)” basis may be approved by the Assistant Vice President of Human Resources Operations.\n\nWhen the University creates or modifies a classification such that it is excepted from overtime in accordance with the law, the Union shall be notified in advance of implementation. This language does not preclude the Union or any individual employee from challenging the University’s overtime determination in appropriate forums.\n\nReturn to top\n\nArticle 10 – Overtime\n\n10.1. Overtime.\n\nAny one of the following constitutes overtime:\n\nWork in excess of the daily work shift for full-time employees assigned to scheduled work period positions;\n\nWork in excess of forty (40) hours in one (1) work week performed by overtime-eligible part time employees assigned to scheduled or nonscheduled work period positions; or\n\nFor hospital personnel assigned to a fourteen (14) day schedule, work in excess of eight (8) hours in a twenty four (24) hour period or eighty (80) hours in a fourteen (14) day period.\n\nOvertime worked by the eligible employees assigned to scheduled or nonscheduled work positions shall be compensated at a rate of one and one-half (1-1/2) times the employee’s straight time hourly rate including shift differential for all overtime worked as provided in subsection (a) of this section.\n\nOvertime-eligible employees assigned to scheduled or nonscheduled work period positions shall receive monetary payment as compensation for overtime worked; however, at the employee’s request, compensatory time off at one and one-half (1-1/2) times the overtime hours worked may be granted in lieu of monetary payment.\n\nCompensation paid to an employee for accrued compensatory time shall be paid at the hourly rate earned by the employee at the time the employee receives such payment. Upon termination of employment, an employee will be paid for any unused compensatory time in accordance with the Fair Labor Standards Act.\n\nUse of accrued compensatory time shall be approved by the employing official with consideration being given to the work requirements of the department and the wishes of the employee. Compensatory time off may be scheduled by the employing official during the final sixty (60) days of a biennium (for the University-wide Nonsupervisory, University-wide Supervisory, Contact Center, Contact Center Supervisory, and Healthcare Professional/Laboratory Technical bargaining units), or fiscal year (for the Research Technologist and Research Technologist Supervisor bargaining units).\n\nCompensatory time must be used or paid for by June 30th of each fiscal year. The employee’s unused compensatory time balance will be cashed out every June 30th or when the employee leaves University employment for any reason. The employee’s compensatory time balance may also be cashed out when the employee:\n\nTransfers within their department to a position with different funding sources, or\n\nTransfers to a position in another department.\n\nFor purposes of computing overtime compensation, holidays or leave with pay during the employee’s regular work schedule shall be considered as time worked.\n\n10.2. Overtime Policies.\n\nWhenever overtime work is required, the employing official shall determine the employees needed to work overtime on the basis of their relevant experience. Overtime shall be distributed as equitably as possible among qualified employees.\n\nIt is intended that overtime wages for which salary payment is to be made shall be paid to the employee no later than on the paydate following the pay period in which the overtime was earned. In no event shall such overtime payments be made later than thirty (30) calendar days from the end of the pay period in which the overtime was earned providing the payroll office has received confirmation authorizing such payment within the time limits set by the Integrated Service Center Payroll Office.\n\nThe federal Fair Labor Standards Act and the Washington State Minimum Wage Act govern which positions are as a matter of law exempt or non-exempt. Appendix III details job classifications that are FLSA exempt, however certain positions in these classifications may be determined to be FLSA non-exempt if the employee’s combination of FTE and salary falls below the federal or state salary threshold. This does not preclude the Union or any individual employee from challenging the University’s overtime determination in appropriate forums.\n\nTemporary Modified Weekly Schedule. By mutual agreement, individual employees and their supervisors may agree to a temporary modified weekly schedule. This schedule allows employees to alter their regular daily working hours within a work week without generating the payment of overtime (unless the employee works beyond forty (40) hours in the employee’s regular work week). Such scheduling will not be considered a regularly recurring alternative schedule. Specific to the University-wide Nonsupervisory, Supervisory, Contact Center, Contact Center Supervisory, and Health Care Professional/Laboratory Technical bargaining units: Temporary modified weekly scheduling adjustments must be completed within the employee’s regular work week.\n\n10.3. Article 10 Overtime does not apply to the Dietitian job classifications. Dietitians are FLSA exempt. If approved to work an extra shift, the extra shift shall be paid at straight time. Article 9.7 still applies if applicable.\n\nReturn to top\n\nArticle 11 – Employee Training and Development\n\n11.1. Policy. The Employer reaffirms its commitment to an on-going system of staff development and training. The Employer shall maintain an employee training and development plan. The objective of this plan shall be to provide opportunity for the development of the potential occupational and professional ability of each employee in order to (1) meet institutional needs, (2) to make the most effective and economic use of employee resources in accomplishing institutional goals, and (3) to enhance employee’s career advancement opportunities.\n\n11.2. The University shall annually provide a list of job classifications reflecting the number of regular monthly positions and the number of those filled in the past calendar year. This information shall be on file in UW Human Resources.\n\n11.3. Training and Development Committees. The Union shall be invited to designate an employee representative to participate in any University committee convened to address topics relevant to the bargaining unit’s training and development. Such topics may include career advancement, career paths, potential training needs and courses, and program crediting in the employment process. Employee representatives shall be granted release time to attend committee meetings which are conducted during regular business hours.\n\n11.4. Information. The Employer shall, upon written request, provide the Union with copies of the institution’s or department’s training and development plan and the annual report of the achievement of training objectives.\n\n11.5. Training and Development Programs. Supervisors will encourage employees to participate in the various training and development programs as provided for by Executive Order 52 in order to maximize their job performance and to increase their promotional opportunities.\n\nWhen the Employing Official requires an employee to acquire new skills the supervisor will identify appropriate sources of training and provide training in accordance with 11.8.\n\n11.6. Release Time. Release time for training for employees accepted for training and development programs covered under Executive Order 52 shall be up to a maximum of 24 hours per quarter plus the travel time to and from class. Part-time employees are eligible to participate in staff training and development classes with release time prorated according to their work schedules (e.g., an employee working a 50% schedule is eligible for a maximum of 12 hours release time per quarter). Employees who are not scheduled to work during the time a course is offered may participate in the course; however, no compensatory time off or compensation will be allowed. Management-directed training is not included in this limitation on release time.\n\n11.7. BIPOC Staff Development Program. In concert with the University’s diversity and inclusion goals and initiatives, the University may offer a BIPOC Staff Development Program free to all BIPOC staff enrolled in the program, which includes self-paced online programming, competency-based workshops, and specialized content supporting an inclusive workplace culture.\n\n11.8. Completion of Training Programs. Completion of training programs will be considered in evaluating the employee’s application for transfer or promotion when certification of completion has been indicated by the employee. The Employer will review courses offered through Professional & Organizational Development, UW Information Technology, and the UW Women’s Center in order to identify courses which satisfy requirements for regular monthly staff positions. The Employer will determine the amount of credit appropriate to the training course(s). Employees are encouraged to record completed training programs when applying for CEGP but completion of training alone does not guarantee CEGP approval.\n\nCrediting of completed training programs towards minimum qualifications shall be determined by the Employer. Successful completion of the Administrative Excellence Certificate or the Human Resources Administration Certificate are equivalent to six (6) months of relevant work experience and successful completion of the Supervisory Skills Certificate Series is equivalent to six (6) months of supervisory experience, provided the employee provides notice of completion.\n\n11.9. Employees shall be appropriately trained and/or certified prior to being assigned to perform work requiring such training or certification, e.g., work with asbestos, lead, blood borne pathogens, and all other appropriate training required for safety and efficiency in the unit.\n\n11.10. Tuition Payment and Travel Cost Reimbursement. If a supervisor requires an employee to receive training all fees and related costs will be paid by the employing department. If attendance in such courses requires use of the employee’s personal vehicle, the employee will be reimbursed at the University’s travel rates applying at the time. If other transportation must be taken, the employee will be reimbursed for all transportation costs. Required attendance in courses which are outside of regular working hours and which are work related or meet an identified institutional need is considered “paid time training” and constitutes time worked.\n\n11.11. Training – Layoff. Employees on layoff status shall be eligible to participate on a space available basis in regularly scheduled Professional & Organizational Development programs.\n\n11.12. Education and Professional Development. The University encourages all departments/grants with individuals employed in this bargaining unit to provide as much support for Continuing Education as budgets will permit. The University recognizes the crucial contribution made by all bargaining unit members, and that Continuing Education assists staff in increasing the level of skill and knowledge they bring to their chosen fields.\n\n11.13. Educational/Professional Leave – Surgical Technologists. For Surgical Technologists who have completed their probationary period, up to three (3) days, pro-rated for part-time, of paid release time shall be granted annually for each employee for educational/professional leave.\n\n11.14. Education Support Funds – Surgical Technologists. For Surgical Technologists $250.00 per FTE, pro-rated for part-time, per fiscal year shall be made available to fund continuing education.\n\n11.15. Medical Interpreters. For Medical Interpreters, the Employer will provide $250.00 per employee, prorated by FTE, per fiscal year for education and training.\n\n11.16. Physical Therapists and Physical Therapist Assistants. Physical Therapists and Physical Therapy Assistants will receive paid time off for educational purposes, as follows:\n\nAll Physical Therapists and Physical Therapy Assistants will be able to use three (3) days of paid education time off per fiscal year, prorated for FTE.\n\nPhysical Therapists and Physical Therapy Assistants hired in the Ambulatory Care Division prior to July 19, 2016 (Stadium Clinic, Roosevelt Clinic, East Side Clinic) will have up to $1500 available to reimburse costs for approved educational or training programs, prorated for FTE. PTs and PTAs hired in Ambulatory Care Division after July 19, 2016 will receive $500 per fiscal year. PTs and PTAs working outside of the Ambulatory Care Division shall also receive $500 per fiscal year, regardless of hiring date.\n\nPhysical Therapists and Physical Therapy Assistants who attend approved educational opportunities on a day they are not scheduled to work will receive the equivalent of a day of pay or a day of accrued time off. This practice will result in pay at straight time and will not trigger overtime pay for the affected pay period. This compensatory day will count toward the three days of annual education time off.\n\n11.17 Occupational Therapists. Occupational Therapists will receive paid time off for educational purposes, as follows:\n\nAll Occupational Therapists hired in the Exercise Training Center and Eastside Specialty Center prior to the effective date of this agreement (9/17/2020) will have five (5) days of paid educational leave per fiscal year, pro-rated for FTE. Occupational Therapists hired after the effective date of this agreement will have three (3) days of paid educational leave per fiscal year, pro-rated for FTE.\n\nFrom the effective date of this agreement (9/17/2020) Patient Care Services (Hospital) Occupational Therapists will have up to $550 per fiscal year available to reimburse costs for approved educational or training programs, prorated for FTE. Hand Therapists hired in the Exercise Training Center and Eastside Specialty Center prior to the effective date of this agreement (9/17/2020) will have up to $1500 available to reimburse costs for approved educational or training programs, prorated for FTE. Hand Therapists hired in Ambulatory Care Division after the effective date of this agreement will receive $550 per fiscal year.\n\nOccupational Therapists who attend approved educational opportunities on a day they are not scheduled to work will receive the equivalent of a day of pay or a day of accrued time off. This practice will result in pay at straight time and will not trigger overtime pay for the affected pay period. This compensatory day will count toward the three days of annual education time off.\n\n11.18 Dietitians will receive paid time off for education purposes, as follows:\n\nAll Dietitians will be ale to use forty (40) hours of paid education time off per fiscal year, prorated for FTE.\n\nFrom the effective date of this agreement (2/1/2022) Dietitians will have up to $500 per fiscal year available to reimburse costs for approved educational or training programs, prorated for FTE.\n\nDietitians who attend approved educational opportunities on a day they are not scheduled to work will receive the equivalent of a day of pay or a day of accrued time off. This practice will result in pay at straight time and will not trigger overtime pay for the affected pay period. This compensatory day will count toward the forty (40) hours of annual education time off.\n\nUpon request, and excluding some travel and accommodations expenses, departments will pay for continuing education expenses in lieu of requiring the employee to seek reimbursement. Requests for such payment must be made to the Clinical Nutrition Manager at least 6 weeks in advance. Servicing or processing fees for trainings offered by the Employer will not be counted towards an employee’s total education support funds.\n\nReturn to top\n\nArticle 12 – Advance Certification/Registration Pay\n\nApplicable only to HealthCare Professional/Laboratory Technical and Supervisory bargaining units\n\nCertain hospital technical employees certified in a specialty area by a national organization and working in that area of certification shall be paid an hourly premium of one dollar and twenty five cents ($1.25) provided the particular certification has been approved by management, and further provided that the employee continues to meet all educational and other requirements to keep the certification current and in good standing. A certified employee is eligible for only one certification premium regardless of other certifications the employee may have. Certified employees will notify their respective supervisor/manager in writing at the time certification is received, providing a copy of the original certification document. Certification pay will be effective the first full pay period after the date documentation is received by the supervisor/manager.\n\nAFFECTED TITLES:\n\nJob CodeJob Profile Name 22557Anesthesiology

Tuition Exemption Program\n\n13.1. In addition to those noncredit programs offered by Professional & Organizational Development, eligible employees may participate in the University’s tuition exemption program as authorized by applicable state law and University policy set forth in the Administrative Policy Statement 22.1. Subject to operational needs and management discretion, supervisors will make a good faith effort to allow the use of flex time for employees who wish to take a class during their scheduled shift.\n\n13.2. Release Time and Fees. When an employee is required to take a tuition exempt class by the Employer, associated expenses and release time will be provided per Article 11.8.\n\n13.3. Registration. Employees will be allowed to register for class on the same timeline as Access students.\n\nReturn to top\n\nArticle 14 – Hiring, Appointment, Promotions, and Transfers\n\n14.1. Probation. An employee appointed to a regular position will attain permanent status in a job classification upon their successful completion of a probationary, trial service or transition review period.\n\nEvery part-time and full-time employee, following their initial appointment to a permanent position, will serve a probationary period of six (6) consecutive months. The Employer may extend the probationary period for an individual employee as long as the extension does not cause the total period to exceed twelve (12) months. Employees will be provided with a written explanation for the extension. If the extension is based on performance issues, the employee will receive a performance improvement plan. Extension of probationary periods shall not be a normal practice.\n\nPermanent employees at the University of Washington shall not be required to complete another probationary period.\n\nThe Employer will extend an employee’s probationary period, on a day-for-a-day basis, for any day(s) that the employee takes paid time off, unpaid time off, or shared leave, except for absences taken for military service or for purposes of faith, or conscience under Article 24(c). For the purpose of calculating the completion date, an employee’s probationary period shall not end on the employee’s regularly scheduled weekend off or a scheduled holiday off. In those instances the completion date will be the next scheduled work day.\n\nBy mutual agreement, the probationary period for additional classifications in their entirety may be established for a period in excess of six (6) months but not to exceed twelve (12) months.\n\nEmployees in probationary status will earn seniority from their initial date of hire but may not exercise seniority rights until completion of the probationary period. Probationary employees are not eligible for layoff or rehire rights.\n\nAn employee who is appointed to a different position in a different classification prior to completing their initial probationary period will serve a new probationary period. The length of the new probationary period will be in accordance with Subsection 14.1 (A), unless adjusted by the Appointing Authority for time already served in probationary status. In no case, however, will the total probationary period be less than six (6) consecutive months.\n\nProbationary Period Rejection. An appointing authority may reject an employee who has not completed a probationary period. Upon request by the employee and within 10 business days of notice, a meeting to explain such action shall be held with a representative of the Employer. At the employee’s request a representative of the Union shall attend such meetings. Such rejection is not subject to the grievance procedure, except in cases involving discrimination, under Article 2.\n\n14.2.

Such leave without pay will not:\n\nConstitute a break in service and will not be deducted from the employee’s length of service in granting periodic increments.\n\nBe considered when computing the employee’s vacation leave accrual rate.\n\nWhen additional work is required of a cyclic position during a period of which the position was scheduled for leave without pay, the nonpermanent work will first be offered to the incumbent. The incumbent will be allowed at least three (3) working days in which to accept or decline the offer.\n\nWhen additional pre-scheduled work is available during the leave without pay period that is declined or cannot be completed by the incumbents, the work will be offered to Cyclic Appointment employees prior to internal employees, students, or external candidates. The work will be offered in the following order, based on seniority:\n\nCyclic Appointments in the same job classification.\n\nCyclic Appointment in different job classifications with the essential skills to perform the work.\n\nEmployees who elect to accept work in a different job classification will be compensated at the rate of pay of the position they have accepted. However, if an employee accepts work in a lower classification and their current rate of compensation falls within the pay range for that classification, they will maintain their current rate of pay within the lower classification.\n\nBoth the Employer and the Union are encouraged to utilize the Joint Union Management Committee process in accordance with Article 43 to resolve problems/concerns related to the cyclic leave without pay assignments.\n\nTemporary Appointment to a Higher Position.
