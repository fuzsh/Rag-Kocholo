A dozen hearses were drawn up on St. Paul St. by the entrance to the hospital’s chapel, the horses occasionally stamping their hooves in the cold. Inside, a funeral service was being conducted, the likes of which Montreal had never seen before.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY\n\nThere with you then.

Furthermore, the nuns had not died a few days before but over the span of two centuries.\n\nThe hospital, which had stood there since Jeanne Mance opened its doors in 1645, was on the move. New buildings halfway up the mountain were almost complete. The living nuns were moving there, and taking with them from the Hôtel Dieu the remains of their dead sisters. Another 14, buried in Bonsecours Church and the Grey Nuns’ chapel a few streets away, would stay where they were.\n\nJust 23 coffins were needed to hold the exhumed remains. The service completed, the coffins were carried outside and placed in the hearses. Then the cortège moved slowly away, up St. Sulpice St. past the old buildings, through Place d’Armes and out along St. Urbain St. It was “followed by a very large concourse of people on foot and in sleighs,” The Gazette said.\n\nIn 1861, the city barely reached as far north as Sherbrooke St. More or less open countryside lay beyond. There, on the site that the Hôtel Dieu occupies to this day, patients and nuns alike would be spared the cramped quarters, the noise and foul air of the city and the St. Lawrence River’s occasional flooding that had long plagued the old hospital.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nJeanne Mance, the Hôtel Dieu’s founder, was not herself a nun but a devout laywoman who had taken a vow of celibacy. Just 35, she was among several equally pious women who arrived with Paul de Maisonneuve in May 1642 to establish Ville Marie.\n\nHer task was to tend to the health of the settlers and of the Indians whom they hoped to convert. She was given a rough shed as a stopgap, but two years later construction began on a more substantial building. Ville Marie’s needs were great, and the task of nursing as well as of administering the hospital’s affairs proved increasingly daunting.\n\nIn 1658, she sailed to France and returned the following year with three nursing sisters, Religieuses Hospitalières de Saint-Joseph. This was the order of nuns into whose hands the Hôtel Dieu would be conveyed.\n\nThe coffins being taken up the slope of Mount Royal that January day in 1861 bore carefully printed tables. They listed names for what was collected inside so that “one can know in which of the coffins are enclosed the remains of friends or relations.” Yet the contents were a jumble. The grinding of time ensured that little remained but mixed-up bone fragments and dust.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThose nuns who died from 1659 to 1827 were buried in the chapel, and so little was left of them that just eight coffins sufficed. However, almost twice as many coffins were needed for those remains taken from a burial vault that had opened in 1827, and no wonder. Not only were the corpses from the most recent 33 years more substantial, but in addition death had come more frequently. Cholera in 1832 and typhus in 1847 had been especially devastating, not just for laypeople but for the nuns tending them as well.\n\nThe new building would accommodate not only the Hôtel Dieu proper but also a smaller, affiliated institution, the Hôpital Saint Patrice. There would be room for 210 medical patients, as well as about 400 paupers, orphans and old people. They occupied one wing, the nuns the other. The dust and bones of the nuns who had gone before were interred beneath the great central dome.\n\nJeanne Mance died in 1673. She was buried in the Hôtel Dieu’s chapel, though her heart was preserved in a separate reliquary. It is said these remains did not survive a fire that destroyed the hospital in 1695. Still, perhaps it’s not impossible to imagine that at least a few motes of her dust now rest with her sisters up the mountain.\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network"
