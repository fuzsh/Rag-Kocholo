        "text": "For an overview of hunting in Washington and how to get started, visit our Hunt Washington blog post.\n\nBuy your 2024 hunting license\n\nWith summer in full swing, Washingtonians will need to buy 2024-2025 recreational hunting and fishing licenses. People can buy licenses from WDFW’s licensing website, WDFW regional offices, or hundreds of license vendors around the state.\n\nImage\n\nPhoto by WDFW\n\nCurrent hunting regulations are also available online at wdfw.wa.gov/hunting/regulations.\n\n2024-25 hunting regulations\n\nThe 2024-25 Game Bird and Small Game Hunting Regulations and 2024 Big Game Hunting Regulations pamphlets are available online and at hundreds of license dealers around the state. The updated rules can help hunters make decisions about how to spend their time in the field.\n\nCurrent hunting regulations are also available online at wdfw.wa.gov/hunting/regulations.\n\nBlack bear hunting season opens\n\nThe fall black bear hunting dates are Aug.1 – Nov. 15. More information including area restrictions is available in the 2024 Big Game Hunting Regulations.\n\nHunters are urged to not shoot a female with cubs. Bait or hounds are not allowed for bear hunting under Washington state law. Successful hunters must submit a tooth sample from their harvested bear, with instructions available at the link below.\n\nHunters that choose to hunt in GMUs located in grizzly bear recovery areas must successfully complete the annual WDFW online bear identification test. The online test is available through the WDFW Wild System or our Bear identification program webpage.\n\nSummer scouting can lead to fall success\n\nWith fall big game, waterfowl, and small game seasons fast approaching, now is the time to get ahead. Discovering new areas, identifying crucial habitat, and strategically placing trail cameras can significantly boost your chances of success later this year. Summer scouting also offers an excellent opportunity to physically prepare for the challenges of hunting.\n\nBeyond scouting, it's wise to inspect and prepare your gear to ensure it's both safe and functional. Begin your preparations today by visiting the WDFW Hunt Planner webpage or check out our myWDFW webpage.\n\nBe aware of avian influenza (bird flu)\n\nAs bird migrations resume, there is a chance we could also see a resurgence in highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI or commonly known as bird flu) to the state. The H5N1 virus of avian influenza is making the rounds again, especially in areas of Western Washington. This is confirmed by WDFW testing of sick or dead wild birds and U.S. Department of Agriculture surveillance of hunter-harvested birds.\n\nHunters are encouraged to take precautions to protect themselves and their dogs from the virus. WDFW has specific precautions on our avian influenza webpage under “Human HPAI Safety.” If you encounter a sick or dead wild bird, please report it via our online reporting tool.\n\nNew, prospective hunters must complete hunter education\n\nImage\n\nPhoto by WDFW\n\nBefore hunting seasons start, be sure to complete your hunter education course.\n\nStudents may choose between a traditional classroom or hybrid course. The traditional course is a multi-session instructor-led training with an average of 15 hours of instruction. The hybrid course consists of a self-paced online class followed by a field skills evaluation by certified instructors.\n\nProspective hunters can learn more about hunter education requirements and register for either a traditional or hybrid course by visiting WDFW’s hunter education webpage.\n\nPer Washington state law, all hunters born after Jan. 1, 1972, must complete a hunter education course in order to buy a hunting license. A hunter education deferral is available for hunters 10 and older who want to try hunting with an eligible licensed hunter before completing a hunter education course themselves.\n\nHoof disease in elk\n\nAs many hunters know, Treponeme-Associated Hoof Disease (TAHD) has spread among elk in Western Washington in recent years, including in the North Cascades Elk Herd (PDF). While elk are susceptible to many conditions that cause limping or hoof deformities, the prevalence and severity of this new affliction – now known as treponeme-associated hoof disease (TAHD) – suggests something different.\n\nImage\n\nPhoto by WDFW\n\nIn 2021, WDFW implemented an incentive-based pilot program to encourage Western Washington (400, 500, 600 series GMUs) hunters to harvest limping elk, potentially reducing prevalence of the disease over time. General season or permit hunters can choose to participate in the program by submitting elk hooves at one of the many collection sites in western Washington.\n\nSee the WDFW website for the locations of collection sites. Hunters that submit hooves with signs of TAHD (for example, abnormal hooves) will be automatically entered into a drawing for a special incentive permit for the following license year. Multiple bull permits in western Washington with season dates of Sept. 1 – Dec. 31 will be awarded. Additionally, all participants will receive a custom, waterproof license holder.\n\nWhat hunters can do to help:\n\nHarvest a limping elk from any 400, 500, 600 series GMUs\n\nTurn in your elk hooves along with complete registration forms at one of several collection sites in western Washington\n\nReport elk: Hunters can help WDFW track TAHD by reporting observations of both affected and unaffected elk on the department’s online reporting form.\n\nClean shoes and tires: Anyone who hikes or drives off-road in a known affected area can help minimize the risk of spreading the disease to new areas by removing all mud from their shoes and tires before leaving the area.\n\nHead to myWDFW.com for info on hunting, angling, and more\n\nWDFW has rolled out a promotional website for all things hunting, angling, foraging, recreating, and more. At myWDFW.com, you’ll find informative how-to articles on the season’s major fishing and hunting opportunities, as well as a portal to online license sales and a regular update on WDFW’s latest Life Outdoors articles.\n\nEach quarter, new fishing and hunting highlights are posted to help you get ready and take part in Washington’s current and upcoming opportunities. Dedicated to current agency promotions, outdoor recreation information, and educational content, myWDFW.com preps you to meet with success in the field and on the water.\n\nSearching for places to watch wildlife or recreate on State Wildlife Areas or WDFW Water Access Areas? Visit our Places to Go webpage, Wildlife Area map or Water Access Area webpage for ideas.\n\nOr visit our wildlife viewing webpage for more information and tips on wildlife watching!\n\nBoaters: give southern resident orcas space\n\nEarlier this summer, WDFW declared 16 members of the Southern Resident killer whale population \"vulnerable\" due to pregnancy or poor body condition, and it's more important than ever to give these whales plenty of space when recreating in Puget Sound.\n\nAt a minimum, give Southern Resident killer whales at least 300 yards on either side and 400 yards in front of and behind them. Avoid approaching Southern Resident killer whales within 1,000 yards. Beginning Jan. 1 2025, boaters will be required to stay at least 1,000 yards from these endangered orcas.\n\nBlue Stilly Access Area closed through Sept. 20\n\nThe Blue Stilly Water Access Area will be closed to vehicle entry through Sept. 20, 2024. The site will reopen to vehicles Sept. 21 through Jan. 31, or otherwise when fishing is open on the adjacent section of the Stillaguamish River.\n\nBlue Stilly was acquired by WDFW to support fishing access, and the Department intends to continue to allow vehicle access during fishing seasons, along with other responsible walk-in access, while deterring irresponsible and potentially dangerous behavior.\n\nThere are several county and city parks nearby, including Haller Park and Twin Rivers, that provide alternative options for people to responsibly enjoy access to the river.\n\nWatchable Wildlife\n\nSummer can mean wildfire smoke, and while we understand some of its effects on humans, there’s still a lot to learn about impacts on wildlife. You can help researchers by participating in Project Phoenix, a regional community science project to learn more about how wildfire smoke affects birds.\n\nThe goal is to engage communities across the West Coast in monitoring birds in their neighborhoods for just 10 minutes per week during peak fire season (July through November). Data collected from volunteers helps researchers learn more about how smoke and other air pollutants affect bird behavior and species distributions. Research could make a tremendous difference in helping to identify the places and resources birds need to thrive in ever-smokier summers.\n\nThe best part is that anyone can get involved, regardless of previous birding experience! Beginner birders are welcome and encouraged to join — anyone with an interest in birds will be able to contribute valuable observations to this effort.\n\nWhen viewing all wildlife, be sure to follow responsible and ethical viewing and photography practices to have a safe and enjoyable experience. More information on wildlife viewing, including how to get started, can be found on our webpage.\n\nTake a hike — and practice safety!\n\nImage\n\nPhoto by Naomi Gross\n\nCoastal Washington is full of hiking trails where you can see a variety of landscapes, wildlife, and plants. Proper planning can help keep you safe during your next hiking trip!\n\nTell someone where you’re going and when you expect to be home. Travel with a buddy when possible.\n\nStay aware of your surroundings and be sure you can easily see and hear what’s behind and in front of you.\n\nCarry survival gear, including a first-aid kit and extra clothing, food, and water. A sleeping bag or other form of shelter is also a good idea in case you need to spend the night outside.\n\nBring a reliable map, compass, and GPS with extra batteries. Remember that electronic locators and communication devices, like cellphones, may not work in the backcountry.\n\nWild neighbors: what to do if you encounter young wildlife\n\nImage\n\nPhoto by WDFW\n\nIf you find fawns, baby birds, or other young animals, please leave them be, even if they appear to be orphaned or abandoned. Most animals have a parent foraging or hunting nearby. Read our blog to learn about when not to rescue wildlife and what to do if you encounter certain species.\n\nFor wildlife that do require care, WDFW relies on permitted rehabilitators. Rehabilitators are trained and highly skilled in providing the unique attention needed for injured or orphaned wildlife, and care deeply for the animals entrusted to them.\n\nVisit our website to learn more about Washington’s wildlife rehabilitators and find one near you. Remember to thank the rehabilitators in your region for the important work they do on behalf of our state’s wildlife!\n\nPractice black bear awareness this summer\n\nImage\n\nPhoto by Public submission\n\nBlack bears are common throughout Washington, including suburban areas. Both when preparing for hibernation and awakening from it, they look for high-calorie foods that are easy to get. These may include garbage, bird feeders (both seed and liquid), fruit trees, and pet food.\n\nAs human populations encroach on bear habitat, people and bears have greater chances of encountering each other. Food sources provided by humans, whether intentionally or not, can attract bears. Removing these attractants is the best way to encourage bears to move along and focus on natural food sources\n\nAsk your local waste management company if bear-resistant containers are available or if individually purchased bear-resistant containers are compatible with the company’s equipment. Secure your garbage cans, such as in a shed or garage, and put them out the morning of pickup — not the night before. To help reduce odors, freeze meat and fish waste before disposing of it and spray garbage cans with disinfectants.\n\nMore information on living with bears is available on our website.\n\nBig Ditch Access Area closed to vehicles through Sept. 15\n\nBig Ditch Water Access Area is closed to vehicle entry through September 15 to reduce illegal dumping, vandalism, and target shooting. Walk-in access from the gate is allowed. This site near Stanwood on the southside of Skagit Bay is popular in the fall and winter for waterfowl hunting and birdwatching.\n\nFor information on other water access areas nearby, please visit our Skagit Wildlife Area webpage.\n\nSkagit Wildlife Area Headquarters Unit to remain closed to public\n\nImage\n\nPhoto by WDFW\n\nFollowing heavy rains and flooding, we have determined that the Skagit Wildlife Area Headquarters Unit near Conway will remain closed to public access until further notice due to safety concerns. Walk-in access is prohibited.\n\nWDFW hopes to reopen the Skagit Headquarters Unit to the public later in 2024 once critical public safety and habitat protection work is complete. Learn more in our statement.\n\nSince 2016, multiple high-water events have overtopped dikes in the area, resulting in temporary inundation of public and private property. This construction project will raise and widen the dikes in accordance with Army Corps of Engineers standards. More information is available on this webpage.\n\nLooking for more info on wildlife conservation and species management around Washington? Check out our Bi-Weekly Wildlife Program reports.\n\nPublic comment period open on rule to protect endangered foxes\n\nWDFW has filed a rule making proposal for a wildlife trapping restriction meant to protect endangered Cascade red foxes. The public is invited to submit comments about the proposed rule though Aug. 9.\n\nIf the proposed rule is adopted, fox trapping would be closed within the exterior boundaries of the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie, Okanogan, Wenatchee, and Gifford Pinchot national forests this year and in future trapping seasons.\n\nLearn more in our news release, including how to submit public comments. A copy of the rule making proposal is available on WDFW’s website.\n\nHabitat at Home\n\nYou’ve decided to create Habitat at Home for wildlife, hooray! You’ve mapped out your space, chosen your plants — but now your homeowners’ association (HOA), landlord, or neighbor has voiced concerns. Whether you rent or own, we have tips on how to encourage acceptance of your wildlife habitat.\n\nWild Washington Youth Education\n\nJust because summer has arrived doesn’t mean learning has to stop. Our focus this month is on pollinators! Summer break is a great time to engage your learners in outdoor, scientific inquiry. Follow the flowers and learn how to find and identify one of Washington’s 600 native bee species!\n\nUsing tools like the iNaturalist Washington Native Bee Society Project, you and your family can hone your bee identification skills. This community science program can be done anywhere there are flowering plants. Try looking in your yard, local park, or borrow a Discover Pass from your local library and visit a WDFW wildlife area. To find more pollinator education resources, check out our family education resources and resources from the Woodland Park Zoo.\n\nLook out for invasive European green crabs\n\nSummer fun is just around the corner. While you enjoy your favorite outdoor activities around Washington's waters, be on the lookout for European green crabs.\n\nUse our simple \"5 Point\" approach to identify this aquatic invasive species:\n\n5 points outside of the eyes\n\n4 inches or smaller\n\n3 rostral bumps between the eyes\n\n2 semi-flattened rear swimming legs\n\n1 enormous threat to our native shellfish and aquatic habitat\n\nJoin us in the fight against this invasive species. If you spot a European green crab using these 5 points, report it at wdfw.wa.gov/greencrab.\n\nJoin the WDFW team\n\nIf you’d enjoy preserving, protecting, and perpetuating the state’s fish, wildlife, and ecosystems while providing sustainable fish and wildlife recreational and commercial opportunities, then check out some of our current job openings or sign up for job alerts. From fish hatchery specialists to environmental engineers and budget analysts to wildlife biologists, a career with WDFW makes a difference.\n\nVolunteer opportunity spotlight\n\nWDFW welcomes volunteers of all abilities who want to contribute to the conservation of fish, wildlife, and habitat. Diverse volunteer opportunities are available, including projects on state wildlife areas and water access areas, habitat restoration projects, hunter education instruction, and assisting at outreach events.\n\nFor more information about the volunteer program and upcoming volunteer opportunities, visit the WDFW volunteer webpage."
