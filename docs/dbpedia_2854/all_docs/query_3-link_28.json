        "text": "EDA Hitchin\n\nHitchin is situated only 30 minutes from Kings Cross London.\n\nHitchin is a market town in the North Hertfordshire District in Hertfordshire, England, with an estimated population of 33,350. In March 2013 a poll in The Times voted Hitchin the 9th best town in the UK in which to live.\n\nThe town is renowned for St Mary’s Church, the largest parish church in Hertfordshire and one whose tower dates back to 1190. Boosted by the wool trade along the nearby Icknield Way the prosperity of the town flourished in the 17th century and it became a staging post for those travelling to and from London. The advent of the railways in 1850 further strengthened the town as a commercial centre.\n\nIn terms of architecture Hitchin offers a range of delightful examples. The Market place is cobbled and surrounded by old traditional buildings dating back to the 15th century. Tudor and Georgian buildings surround the town creating the beautiful look that Hitchin is so famous for.\n\nHitchin hosts an annual Arts & Music Festival in July which in previous years included Rhythms of the World. Hitchin Festival includes picnics, concerts, theatre, ghost walks, art exhibitions, comedy club, talks, summer fetes and fireworks.\n\nHitchin offers a vibrant shopping area with many independent retailers, some deliciously quirky boutiques and many shops that you simply won’t find anywhere else. Restaurants and cafes throughout the town provide welcome meeting places and rest stops for the weary shopper. The market is an attraction to the town every Tuesday, Friday and Saturday. As well as general stalls, there is a specialist antiques and bric-a-brac theme on Friday, a local produce and crafts market on the last Saturday of each month in a riverside setting and on Sunday mornings bargain hunters flock to the car boot sale. For those who are into sport there are plenty of different clubs to join, including football, rugby, hockey, running, cycling, and swimming, with a choice of leisure and fitness centres.\n\nThe town offers a vibrant nightlife that is regarded as one of the best in the county. Pubs, bars and restaurants attract people of all ages to the town and Hitchin certainly knows how to have a good time. With a large variety of restaurants from chic urban to Mediterranean cuisine, Italian to Chinese and Indian, you can almost eat your way around the world. The traditional pubs and lively bars attract a large number of people every weekend and there is always something for those who want a relaxed evening or those hoping to party into the early hours.\n\nEDA\n\n60 Wilbury Way, Hitchin,\n\nHertfordshire, SG4 0TP\n\n01462 677 808\n\nCalls will be recorded for training and quality purposes info@emildale.co.uk\n\nFollowing the recent government initiatives to tackle COVID-19 (coronavirus), we are changing our audition process over to a virtual experience.\n\nEmil Dale Academy has one of the most robust triple-threat audition processes for musical theatre training.
