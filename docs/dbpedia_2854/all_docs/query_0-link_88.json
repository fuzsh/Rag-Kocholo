        "text": "Disclaimer: Some of the links in this post, like hotel links, are affiliate links, meaning at no additional cost to you, we make a little bit of money if you click through and book. That being said, we would never recommend something to you that we donât stand behind 100%.\n\nHow Many Days Do You Need for a Utah National Parks Road Trip?\n\nWe think that you need a full 10 days to do the complete Mighty Five circuit. Less time means a lot of driving and not a lot of time dedicated to each park. With 7 days, youâd essentially only have one day for each. Which we donât think is enough time.\n\nSome parks have more to see than others and are worth spending two to three days in to have the best experience.\n\nWeâve written this guide for someone with 10 days, which I think is the perfect amount of time to see all five national parks in Utah, and have an extra day to spend on the other things that make Utah special.\n\nWhat if You Only Have 5-7 Days in Utah?\n\nIf you have a week or less in Utah, weâd strongly urge you to focus on EITHER Zion National Park and Bryce Canyon, OR Arches, Canyonlands, and Capitol Reef.\n\nWhen you include driving time, which totals around 10 hours or so over the course of the itinerary, 5-7 days BARELY gives you a day in each park if you were to do all five.\n\nFocusing your time on only a few of them will give you a little more time in each park, rather than spending less than one day in each. The key benefit of this approach is that youâll be able to spend more time in the early morning and late afternoon, which is when the crowds are thinnest at these parks.\n\nWhere to Start and End Your Utah Road Trip Itinerary\n\nThere are two options for getting to Utah â driving in from nearby, or flying in, renting a car, and driving.\n\nThe two best starting points for this road trip are Las Vegas and Salt Lake City. Denver is a distant third. Itâs still doable, but involves more driving.\n\nIf you donât live nearby, like in Salt Lake City or Denver, youâll need to fly to one of the gateways to Utah, rent a car, and drive to your first destination.\n\nThe two easiest airports to fly into would be Salt Lake City and Las Vegas.\n\nFrom Salt Lake City, itâs going to take around four hours to drive to the start and end points on this road trip itinerary (Zion and Moab).\n\nFrom Las Vegas, itâs going to be just two and a half hours to Zion, but six and a half hours to Moab.\n\nThe best way to do this road trip if you want to avoid long days of driving is to fly into Salt Lake City and out of Las Vegas, which is how weâve organized the itinerary below.\n\nYou could absolutely do it the other way around, but doing it this direction front loads the longer drive from Salt Lake City to Moab, versus having to do that drive at the end of your trip when your enthusiasm is waning and you only have your return flight to look forward to.\n\nYou can also fly in and out of the same airport, itâll just involve a few hours of extra driving on one end of the trip.\n\nImportant Note: You need to check with the rental car company to make sure that itâs okay to pick up in one spot and drop off in another. You might have to pay a one way fee, but we think itâs worth it to avoid wasting a day of your vacation driving. See below in the rental car section to see what the tradeoff is between picking up / returning to the same place, and doing a one way rental.\n\nYou could fly into Denver and out of Vegas if you wanted to add on a few days exploring Colorado. Itâs going to be five and a half hours of driving between Denver and Moab, but thereâs plenty of things to do and see along the way.\n\nGood to Know: Book the earliest flight you can into Salt Lake City, and the latest flight out of Las Vegas to give yourself as much time as possible to explore.\n\nTips for Your Road Trip Through Utah\n\nBefore we get to the full itinerary, a few general tips about planning a road trip through Utah.\n\nNational Park Entrance Fees\n\nIt costs $30 per vehicle to enter each national park (good for 7 days), and you can either pay online in advance (be aware that you must print it out and bring it with you), or at one of the parkâs visitor centers.\n\nIf you are planning on visiting three or more national parks in the next 12 months, weâd highly recommend an America the Beautiful Pass, which covers entry to all national parks, national forest trailheads, national monuments, and more for 12 months.\n\nIt costs $80, which means it pays off with three national park visits (or some combination of national parks, forests, and monuments).\n\nOn this trip, youâre going to be visiting several national parks, which means itâs probably worth buying an America the Beautiful Pass before your trip.\n\nCrowds in the Utah National Parks\n\nIf youâre visiting the Utah national parks in the summer (or a weekend in the spring or fall), youâre going to experience crowds.\n\nThere are a couple of things weâd say about crowds and how to avoid them as much as possible.\n\nFirst, get an early start, and plan on staying out late. Peak time is from about 10:00 am to 4:00 pm, which makes the hours from 7:00 am to 10:00 am and 4:00 pm to 7:00 pm some of the best times to be out and about in the park. Plus, the rising/setting sun means the light will be better for pictures!\n\nIf You Want to Camp, Book Your Site Well in Advance\n\nCamping inside the national parks is super competitive. For reservable sites, people book months and months in advance, and when there are first-come-first-served sites, they are snatched up immediately in peak season.\n\nThe good news? There are tons of camping options outside of the parks that are affordable and accessible, and youâll find some recommendations in the where to stay section for each park.\n\nThis is a Good Route to Test Out Van Life\n\nIf youâre not into sleeping in a tent, consider an RV or Campervan rental. Itâs a good way to save money on accommodations by staying at campgrounds or RV Parks instead of hotels. For what itâs worth, we did this entire trip living in a Honda Odyssey.\n\nThink of it as a middle ground between camping and staying in hotels and vacation rentals.\n\nEscape Campervans is a good choice, and they have options for the exact route (Salt Lake City to Vegas) that the itinerary below has you on.\n\nBook Your Accommodations Well in Advance\n\nIf youâre planning on staying in hotels and lodges, book several months in advance between May and October. Thatâs peak season, and things fill up FAST.\n\nEven outside of those months, youâll still find that some places are full a few months in advance. Youâll find some hotel recommendations in each section to help you find the best place to base yourself to make the most of your time in each park.\n\nThe Perfect 10 Day Utah National Parks Road Trip Itinerary\n\nNow, on to the itinerary itself!\n\nBelow, youâll find a detailed day-by-day itinerary for a 10 day Utah national parks road trip based on our personal experience over the course of multiple trips. Weâll give you our favorite stops, the best hikes, places to stay, and more.\n\nGrab a cup of coffee and strap in â this is a long one, but it has literally everything we could think of to help you plan an amazing adventure.\n\nHereâs an overview of that road trip, plus a map to help you visualize the route.\n\nHere is the 10 day Utah national parks road trip itinerary that youâll find â in detail â below:\n\nDay 1: Arrive in Salt Lake City, Drive to Moab\n\nDay 2: Arches National Park\n\nDay 3: Canyonlands National Park (Island in the Sky)\n\nDay 4: Around Moab + Drive to Capitol Reef\n\nDay 5: Capitol Reef National Park + Drive to Bryce\n\nDay 6: Bryce Canyon National Park\n\nDay 7: Bryce Canyon National Park + Drive to Zion National Park\n\nDay 8: Zion National Park\n\nDay 9: Zion National Park\n\nDay 10: Zion National Park + Fly Home from Vegas\n\nIf you have a full two weeks in Utah, youâll be able to get a little bit off the beaten path, exploring places like Kolob Canyons in Zion National Park and the Needles District in Canyonlands National Park that most visitors never even realize exist.\n\nBelow the full itinerary, youâll find our suggestions for extending the 10 day trip.\n\nWith 7 days, rather than trying to fit in the entire Mighty Five Circuit, weâd opt for spending 7 days exploring EITHER Zion, Bryce, and Capitol Reef OR Arches, Canyonlands, and Capitol Reef.\n\nDays 1 & 2: Arches National Park\n\nOn your first day, youâll spend most of the day in transit between Salt Lake City and Moab, which is the jumping off point for this itinerary.\n\nWe spent five full days in Moab, and loved just about every minute of it â minus the hour-long wait to get into Arches National Park to check into our campsite. A good reminder to make sure to enter the parks early (before 9:00 am at the latest!) to avoid long lines and crowds.\n\nWe didnât realize it before arriving, but there are an astounding number of things to do in Moab.\n\nBetween exploring the two national parks that are a stoneâs throw away â Arches and Canyonlands â to hikes outside the parks, and more adventurous activities like whitewater rafting and 4WD-ing, thereâs plenty to keep you busy even if you had a full week JUST in Moab.\n\nWhat to Do in Arches National Park\n\nHere are our favorite things to do in Arches National Park.\n\nSunset at Delicate Arch\n\nOn your first day, youâll be driving from the airport and youâre probably going to be arriving mid-afternoon depending on what time your flight was (try and get the earliest flight possible!).\n\nCheck into your accommodations for the next few days and head up to Arches National Park for that sweet, sweet golden hour light and sunset at Delicate Arch.\n\nItâs a 3 mile hike (round trip) that was a little harder than we thought it would be, but that didnât stop literally a hundred people â ages 5 to 65 â from doing it.\n\nIt will probably be crowded if youâre there anytime between April and the end of October, but itâs worth it. Youâll climb up a section of rock, so youâll want to wear your hiking shoes with plenty of grip.Â\n\nThereâs one short section of the trail right before you get to the arch thatâs narrow with a steep drop off, so keep an eye on your kids.\n\nIf you do that hike at sunset, make sure to bring a headlamp for the way down. It gets dark FAST, and the last thing you want is to be hiking down the slab of rock in the dark.\n\nThe Windows and Double Arch\n\nStart your day off your second day with an early morning at the Windows and Double Arch, which are quite possibly our favorite set of arches in the park. And theyâre so close together that you can easily see all of them (thereâs four arches here in total) in about an hour or so.\n\nThe Windows are two huge rock formations that are on the southeast side of the parking lot. Thereâs a nice trail that connects the North and South windows, along with nearby Turret Arch.\n\nMake sure to walk through the North Arch and look back through the window to get a nicely framed picture of Turret Arch.Â\n\nDouble Arch is on the opposite side of the parking lot, and itâs the tallest arch in the park. There are two separate (huge) arches that youâll be looking up at.\n\nYou can climb around inside the arch and marvel at the two arches sharing the same base structure. Itâs about a quarter of a mile from the parking lot on a flat, sandy trail.Â\n\nHike the Devils Garden Trail\n\nThe Devils Garden Trail is a must-do hike in Arches National Park. The best part about this hike? You can customize it based on your experience and fitness level.\n\nIf you do the entire loop, including the fun primitive trail on the way back, itâs going to be just under seven miles, with 1,000 feet of elevation gain. Along the way, youâll see seven different arches, and youâll do some light scrambling and trail finding on the primitive trail, which we thought was a lot of fun.\n\nYouâll want solid hiking shoes or hiking boots (Alysha loves her Columbia Newton Ridge boots, an excellent first hiking boot) with good traction for the scrambling sections, which have you making some steep climbs on rock that necessitate good footing. Itâs nothing too crazy though if youâre an experienced hiker.\n\nIf youâre not up for 7 miles in the desert, do the 2 mile hike to Landscape Arch or the 4 mile (ish) hike to Landscape, Navajo, and Partition Arches, which takes you a bit further than most of the hikers go.\n\nWhatever you choose, itâs going to be hot. Drink plenty of water, eat plenty of snacks, and wear sun protection. Sun exposure is no joke, particularly in the summer.\n\nBroken Arch and Skyline Arch\n\nStop for a quick picnic lunch near the Devils Garden trail (thereâs a picnic area just south of the campground and trailhead), then do the short hikes out to Broken Arch and Skyline Arch.\n\nYou can park in Devils Garden Campground (here) to start the hike out to Broken Arch.\n\nItâs a cool hike, which is why itâs on this list duh, and youâll pass through a couple of cool canyons on the way back from Broken Arch. Itâs about 1.8 miles round trip, and is basically flat. This is a good sunset hike too if youâre staying at Devils Garden Campground since you can leave from camp without driving anywhere.\n\nSkyline Arch is also worth seeing. You get there via a pull off just south of the campground, and itâs a short, easy hike out there.\n\nWhere to Stay in Moab near Arches National Park (and Canyonlands)\n\nYouâre going to stay in Moab for the first three nights of this itinerary. You should try to stay in one place for all three nights UNLESS youâre camping, in which case weâd try to find a site in Arches for the first night.\n\nPssst! Make sure to read our guide to the best places to stay in Moab to find the perfect home base for exploring this incredible area.\n\nHotels in Moab\n\nWe were planning on staying in a hotel in Moab for a night to shower and take a break from the weeks of sleeping in our van, but later decided to stay at a campground for an extra night instead.\n\nThere were exactly three places on our list of hotels that we wanted to stay in.\n\nThe first is Moab Springs Ranch, which has a range of rooms from bungalows to more lodge-style rooms, and has a great coffee shop onsite (Horsethief Coffee). Unfortunately, they were sold out for our dates (book early, people!), but we would have chosen to stay there given the opportunity.\n\nThe second, which is a place we booked then later canceled, is the Expedition Lodge. Itâs in a great location along the main drag in Moab, and it looks nice. Itâs motel style, which was what we were looking for during the summer of 2020, and it has some nice retro touches like the mint green mini fridges in the rooms. They also have some unique room configurations, like two queen bunk beds, which are nice for a traveling family (nobody likes sleeping on the cot on a hotel room floor). Oh, and thereâs a pool, which is always a bonus.\n\nThe last option was Moab Under Canvas, which is less a hotel, more glamping, but still fits here. This is your chance to stay under the stars while still maintaining some semblance of the comforts of a hotel. It looks incredible.\n\nCamping In and Around Moab\n\nIf youâre looking to camp, youâve actually got a fair number of options both inside Arches and Canyonlands, and just outside the national parks.\n\nInside Arches, thereâs only one campground â Devils Garden. Itâs reservable in advance (learn more here), and itâs a really nice campground. We stayed there for three nights, and itâs a great base for exploring Arches for a couple of reasons. First, itâs at the trailhead for Devils Garden, so you can get an early start to beat the crowds and heat (staying outside the park means a 45 minute drive to the trailhead). Second, being inside the park means youâll avoid the crazy lines at the entrance to the park. We waited an hour to get in one day because we had to leave the park to get ice for our cooler.\n\nInside Canyonlands, you have only one option in the Island in the Sky District (which is the part of the park you want) â Willow Flat Campground. Itâs first-come-first-served, and only has 12 sites. Unless you show up early AND get lucky, youâre probably out of luck. You could also camp at Dead Horse Point State Park, which is close to the entrance of Canyonlands, and is worth a visit in its own right, particularly for a spectacular sunset over the canyons.\n\nOutside the park, there are a surprising number of campgrounds on BLM land that are all first-come-first-served. There are two major areas where youâll find them.\n\nThe first group are along Highway 128 northeast of Moab on the Colorado River, and they are competitive and youâll need to show up relatively early for the first few campgrounds. Theyâre in an incredible location along the river and deep inside a gorgeous red rock canyon. Goose Island, Grandstaff, and Big Bend are the nicest based on our drive through the canyon.\n\nThe other area is along Highway 279 northwest of Moab â check out Gold Bar Campground, which is near the trailhead for Corona Arch.\n\nDay 3: Canyonlands National Park\n\nOn your third day in Moab, head out to Canyonlands National Park, which is a very different experience than Arches.\n\nWhile Arches is about feeling small standing under the towering rock formations littered around the park, Canyonlands is about feeling miniscule while looking out over the deep fissures in the earth created over thousands (millions?) of years of tectonic plate action.\n\nThere are three sections of Canyonlands: Island in the Sky (closest to Moab, most accessible), the Needles District, and the Maze (technically I think thereâs a fourth called the Rivers, but Iâm not quite sure about that one).\n\nWith just one day, you should focus on Island in the Sky, which is the most accessible part of the park coming from Moab. However, if you have more time, a trip down to the Needles District is worth your time.\n\nWhat Not to Miss in Canyonlands National Park\n\nHere are some that we enjoyed in the Island in the Sky part of Canyonlands National Park.\n\nEarly Morning at Mesa Arch\n\nStart your morning at Mesa Arch just after sunrise. Itâs a really short hike out to a low arch, through which you get a nice glimpse of the vastness of Canyonlands.\n\nWhy just after sunrise, you ask? Because at sunrise, there will be hundreds â yes, hundreds â of photographers vying for the best position to take that picture-perfect shot of the natural bridge with the sunstar on the bottom. I bet youâve seen it before â it looks like this:\n\nI took that around sunrise at Mesa Arch, where weâd arrived an hour before sunrise and still didnât get a spot. Instead of jostling for position, we took a seat on a rock overlooking the arch and watched the sun rise, then I ventured down when the crowds started to thin.\n\nHereâs the behind the scenes view of the sea of photographers that you donât see in the pictures on Instagram.\n\nThe point is that going after sunrise is a much more pleasant experience.\n\nHiking in Canyonlands\n\nAfter experiencing Mesa Arch, head out on a hike in Canyonlandsâ Island in the Sky District.\n\nHere are three options for various levels of hiking experience and fitness. If youâre up for it, you could totally do a couple of the shorter ones together as part of a little circuit along Canyonlandsâ main thoroughfare.\n\nAztec Butte (1.7 miles / 250 ft. elevation gain): This is a cool hike that has two distinct parts that form a âYâ shape. First, take the right fork to climb to a nice viewpoint over Canyonlands. Then on the way back, take the left fork and check out the ancestral Puebloan structures, which are pretty cool. DONâT TOUCH THE STRUCTURES â leave them be.\n\nWhite Rim Overlook (2 miles / 200 ft. elevation gain): A short and sweet hike to an incredible overlook that really illustrates the scale of Canyonlands. Itâs a short, well-marked hike out to a little âpeninsulaâ (for lack of a better word â thereâs no water, but itâs a peninsula shaped part of the canyon rim). Follow the rock piles, known as cairns.\n\nThe Gooseberry Trail (5 miles / 1,500 ft. elevation gain): This hike is no joke. You basically climb straight down the wall of the canyon to get to the lower plateau, which takes you to a nice overlook of the canyon forged by the mighty Colorado River. Just remember, the first part of the hike is a descentâ¦which means what goes down must come back up. Try to get an early start so that youâre not out there in the heat of the day.\n\nGrand View Point Overlook\n\nNext, head out to Grand View Point, which is another short stroll along the rim of the canyon that we DEFINITELY think you should do, no matter what. Itâs mostly flat, with a little bit of up and down, but the end viewpoint is going to be well worth the small effort to get there.\n\nThe Scenic Drive\n\nGrand View Point is at the end of the road, which means you can make the drive back towards the visitor center a scenic drive by stopping at all the viewpoints along the way.\n\nThe first stop, if you didnât already tackle it, is the White Rim Overlook. We loved this short hike, and itâs worth mentioning again.\n\nMake sure to also stop at the Buck Canyon Overlook and, our favorite viewpoint on the drive, the Shafer Canyon Overlook, which has amazing views of the canyon, and of the steep switchbacks of Shafer Canyon Road, which descend from the rim down to the plateau via tight switchbacks that I would be too terrified to drive myself.\n\nItâs also worth venturing out on the road that leads to Upheaval Dome, aptly named Upheaval Dome Road.\n\nThe turnoff is a little ways south of Shafer Canyon Overlook. Willow Flat Campground, the main campground in this part of Canyonlands, is out there, but stay on Upheaval Dome Road to get to Upheaval Dome, Whale Rock, and Aztec Butte â three great short hikes just off the road.\n\nDay 4: Exploring Around Moab\n\nSpend the morning and afternoon around Moab, exploring what we think are two of the best hikes in the area â neither of which are inside a national park â and then make your way over to Capitol Reef National Park.\n\nThings Not to Miss Around Moab\n\nHere are some things we really enjoyed near Moab (that arenât within national park boundaries).\n\nCorona Arch\n\nWe did the hike out to Corona Arch at sunrise, and sat on a rock watching the light creep down, illuminating the arch about an hour after sunrise. Because of the rock walls here, we actually think the best time to be here is just after sunrise.\n\nItâs only 2.5 miles long (round trip), but there are some sections of scrambling along slickrock, and a ladder that you have to climb. As long as youâre prepared with sturdy footwear, you should be fine, but you should know what youâre getting into before you leave the parking lot.\n\nThe arch itself is enormous, and is one of the more impressive arches we saw in Moab, including the ones in Arches (Delicate Arch and Double Arch might be the only two ahead of it).\n\nThe trailhead is along highway 279, just a twenty minute drive northwest of Moab.\n\nJeep Arch\n\nJust down the road from Corona Arch is another amazing hike that most people probably skip since itâs not inside one of the nearby national parks â and thatâs Jeep Arch.\n\nYouâll park in the small dirt parking lot along the road. We were there mid-morning after our hike to Corona Arch, and we were only the second car in the parking area.\n\nThis hike is a bit longer at 3.6 miles (1,000 ft. of elevation gain), and it is COMPLETELY exposed. No shade to speak of, except right at the base of the arch.\n\nYouâll start by hiking up through the water pipe, which we didnât realize on our way out and ended up hiking up to the railroad tracks, crossing the tracks, and then scrambling down the other side. Only to look through the other end of the pipe and say âah, thatâs the way youâre supposed to go.â\n\nFrom there, youâll follow a trail that is somewhat well marked by cairns across the rocky landscape, surrounded by the towering red rock walls of the canyon. Itâs a loop, and after doing it both directions, we really donât think it makes a huge difference which direction you go.\n\nWe will say that the arch will sneak up on you. We were very worried that we were going the wrong way because the map showed the arch just ahead of us, and we couldnât quite see it yet.\n\nItâs carved into the towering canyon wall, and if you squint, it looks a little bit like a jeep, hence the name (Mattâs not convinced).\n\nSunset at Dead Horse Point State Park\n\nAfter a day of exploring Moab, head out to nearby Dead Horse Point State Park for sunset. Dead Horse Point is on the way back to Moab, which makes it a perfect last stop of the day before retiring to your hotel or campground for the night.\n\nYouâll need to pay the entrance fee, since it is a Utah State Park and is not covered by your America the Beautiful Pass. Itâs $20 a vehicle as of 2021 â double check the up-to-date fees here.\n\nIf youâre up for it and have some extra time before sunset, itâs worth doing one of the short hikes along the west rim. Our pick would be to park at the main parking lot and hike out to the Rim Overlook, and back along the rim to the parking lot, with a short detour to the Shafer Canyon and Meander overlooks along the way.\n\nItâs about 2.5 miles there and back, and itâs flat.\n\nAfter that, pick your spot, plop down, and watch the sunset over the canyon.\n\nDay 5: Capitol Reef National Park\n\nBe honest â before you started researching for this trip, had you ever heard of Capitol Reef National Park?\n\nWe hadnât either.\n\nBut I understand why. Sandwiched between Arches and Canyonlands to the east, and Bryce and Zion to the west, it is the runt of the litter. Not that it isnât a great stop and well worth your time, itâs just that the rest of the national parks in Utah are spectacular.\n\nThe most unique part of Capitol Reef in my book is the amount of green youâll see. Coming from Moab, itâs pretty surprising to drive around a corner with red rocks towering above you and seeâ¦ an orchard? Several orchards, actually.\n\nAnd you can freely walk through them and eat the fruit in the late summer too! You have to pay if you want to take it to eat later though.Â\n\nWhat Not to Miss in Capitol Reef National Park\n\nHere are some things not to miss in Capitol Reef National Park.\n\nCapitol Reef Scenic Drive\n\nStop at the visitor center to grab a map and a hiking guide, then itâs time to tackle the 10 mile scenic drive out to Capitol Gorge.\n\nTake your time on the drive â itâs a gorgeous road through the red rock formations that are Capitol Reefâs specialty.\n\nEventually, youâll arrive at the end of the paved road, where thereâs a small parking lot and picnic area. If you continue on the dirt road, youâll end up at the trailhead for Capitol Gorge, which is the beginning of a short one mile stroll through the towering canyon along the original path into the Fruita Valley.\n\nBe careful with weather in the summer â afternoon thunderstorms and rain showers can cause flash floods, and you definitely donât want to be stuck in the gorge during a flash flood.\n\nHead back the way you came, making a right onto the dirt road that will take you to the Grand Wash Trailhead.\n\nCassidy Arch\n\nHead to the Grand Wash trailhead, which includes a short drive on a well-maintained dirt road, to hike to Cassidy Arch.\n\nIn high season, you might have to wait a few minutes to get a parking space, since the lot is small and the dirt road makes it hard if not impossible to park on the side of the road. The wait will be worth it â youâll climb the wall of the valley to an arch that you can actually walk on!\n\nItâs a steep climb up some stairs for the first bit of the trail, but it mellows out as you wind between the cairns (those are the little rock piles that mark a lot of the trails) up to the arch.\n\nItâs a pretty stunning hike, as youâll get views of the surrounding valley and beyond as you make the ascent. All in all, itâs a three mile hike with 660 feet of elevation gain.Â\n\nYou should know that it will be hot in the afternoon, so bring tons of water, snacks, sunscreen, and a hat for sun protection.\n\nHike Hickman Bridge + Rim Overlook Trail\n\nWe really enjoyed the hike to Hickman Bridge, which is another natural bridge (which is similar to an arch, but slightly different). Itâs a short one mile hike up, and itâs another spot where the trail actually takes you up and through the arch, which is pretty cool.\n\nFrom the Hickman Bridge, itâs another 2 miles to the Rim Overlook, which is an incredible hike that takes you to a high point on the canyon walls and looks over the entire valley. It was one of our favorite spots not only in Capitol Reef, but on our entire Utah road trip. Well worth the effort.\n\nAll-in, if you go all the way up to the Rim Overlook, itâs going to be between 5 and 6 miles, with a moderate elevation gain of about 1,000 feet.\n\nFruita and the Barn\n\nPost-hike, head to Fruita and hit the Gifford House for a fresh baked fruit pie as a reward for finishing the morning hike. They donât have gluten free options, so we ended up skipping the actual pies, but the historic Gifford House is worth a stop regardless.\n\nItâs a good representation of the original Mormon Settlement in Fruita Valley, though it has definitely been updated and renovated since it was built in 1908. Grab a mini pie and take it out to the picnic area outside.\n\nDonât miss walking up the road towards the campsite to get a picture of the Fruita Barn with the red rocks in the background â I love the contrast between the dry red rock canyon, and the lush field (with horses, if youâre lucky) where the barn stands. Super unique.\n\nSunset Point forâ¦ Sunset\n\nA little over an hour before sunset, head out to Sunset Point / the Goosenecks for the second most breathtaking panorama in the park (donât worry, youâll tackle the best viewpoint tomorrow morning).\n\nThe Goosenecks are an okay view of the river winding through the valley below, and theyâre basically at the parking lot.\n\nBut the star of the show is Sunset Point, which has a view across the Fruita Valley with all sorts of interesting terrain as far as the eye can see.\n\nItâs spectacular about a half hour before sunset, when the golden light brings out all the different colors in the surrounding landscape, particularly the red in the canyon walls. Here are a few pictures for you from our trip, if youâre not convinced.\n\nWhere to Stay at Capitol Reef National Park\n\nThere are really not many options near Capitol Reef â you can either camp inside the park, or stay in the nearby town of Torrey, Utah.\n\nCamping in Capitol Reef\n\nThe best option, by far, is Fruita Campground, which is the only place to stay inside the park that you can reserve in advance. Itâs a super nice campground, set in between red rocks and orchards.\n\nWe were discussing whether it was the nicest campground weâd stayed in on our four month road trip, and itâs definitely in the top five. Check availability here.\n\nYou could also stay at Cathedral Valley Campground, which is near the Temple of the Sun and Temple of the Moon, but itâs a journey to get there and itâs super remote with no amenities.\n\nThat being said, itâs free, so thereâs that. Make sure you have a 4WD, high clearance vehicle or youâre going to have a bad time.\n\nHotels near Capitol Reef\n\nYouâll have to head to nearby Torrey to find a place to stay that isnât camping. Itâs only about a 15 minute drive to the park entrance, so itâs a perfect stopover before heading onwards to your next stop, Bryce Canyon National Park.\n\nAs far as hotels and resorts go, the leaders of the pack are Capitol Reef Resort â which is also the closest place to stay near the park (and their two bedroom cottages have a kitchen) â and Red Sands Hotel.\n\nVacation Rentals near Capitol Reef\n\nIf you want a vacation rental with more space and access to a kitchen, there are a couple of good options around Torrey.\n\nFor couples, we like this cozy house.\n\nFor families and groups who need a bit more space, look at this modern two bedroom flat.\n\nDays 6 & 7: Bryce Canyon National Park\n\nWe spent two and a half days in Bryce Canyon, and I didnât quite realize just how compact this national park is. Unlike places like Yellowstone and Yosemite, where you can literally drive for hours and still not leave the park, thereâs essentially one 19 mile road that makes up the entirety of Bryce Canyon National Park.\n\nBryce Canyon really isnât that big, so we think that a day and a half is enough to see the highlights.\n\nFor that reason, if youâre time constrained and only have ten days, Iâd only spend one day in Bryce Canyon National Park, plus a portion of the next morning before driving to Zion.\n\nIf youâve got more than 10 days, this is the first place Iâd add time (an extra day would be perfect).\n\nOne thing you should know for Bryce that I didnât know before my trip: the best light for photos is in the morning.\n\nIn the afternoon, the sun is on the opposite side of the canyon from most of the interesting stuff, which leads to long shadows that really mess with your pictures because of the extremes of light and dark in the photo.\n\nIn the morning, the sun lights up the hoodoos and other formations, making them that much more spectacular.\n\nThe Best Things to Do in Bryce Canyon National Park\n\nHere are five things not to miss in Bryce Canyon National Park.\n\nSunrise at â¦ Sunrise Point\n\nStart your time in Bryce Canyon with sunrise at Sunrise Point. This is a popular spot, so get there early.\n\nYouâll have views of the hoodoos to your right, which is the direction you want to be facing, and the horizon on the left, which is where the sun will come up.\n\nAgain, it bears repeating, make sure to watch the rising sun light up the hoodoos â most people will be looking at the horizon to watch the sunrise, which would be a mistake!\n\nAs the sun comes up, it brings out all the different hues of the hoodoos, making for some spectacular photos.\n\nSunset Point and Thorâs Hammer\n\nNext, walk along the rim to Sunset Point, which is another good viewpoint to see the hoodoos from a slightly different angle.\n\nHike down a little ways to get a good view of Thorâs Hammer, a unique rock formation that looks like the Marvel heroâs signature hammer.\n\nHike the âFigure 8â Loop\n\nAfter youâve taken ALL the photos, you should embark on our favorite hike in Bryce Canyon â the Queenâs Garden / Navajo / Peek-a-boo Loop, which weâll call the âFigure 8â loop because it sounds cooler and is less of a mouthful.\n\nItâs a six mile hike with 1,500 feet of elevation gain. Youâll start at Sunset Point and end along the rim near Sunrise Point.\n\nMake sure youâre fueled up with coffee and breakfast before heading out. To really take in the beauty and scale of Bryce Canyon, you HAVE to get below the rim. This hike takes you through canyons, between hoodoos, and to viewpoints with sweeping views of the magnificence of this park.\n\nYouâll start by descending Wall Street â a set of (very photogenic) steep switchbacks that take you down, down, down into the canyon. Try to get started early, because this spot gets very, very congested.\n\nYouâll wander through the canyon for a bit before you reach a junction â veer right to tackle the peek-a-boo loop, ending back at the exact point you veered right. From there, youâll climb back up to the rim of the canyon via the Queens Garden trail, which is not an easy hike, especially if itâs hot, but itâs totally doable for most people.\n\nAfter the hike, take a break from being in the sun and eat some lunch to refuel, either a picnic lunch, or at the Bryce Canyon Lodge are your best options.\n\nThe Bryce Canyon Scenic Drive\n\nOne thing you definitely shouldnât miss in Bryce Canyon is the scenic drive along the 19-mile road that runs from one end of the park to the other. Itâs a good afternoon activity, and it will only take you about an hour or so.\n\nMake sure to check out Natural Bridge and Bryce Point, our two favorite stops, and stop at any viewpoints along the way that catch your eye.\n\nYouâll want to start this drive at least two hours before sunset, before the sun drops behind the canyon wall and takes all the color out of the hoodoos for the night.\n\nWhere to Stay Near Bryce Canyon National Park\n\nThereâs exactly one place to stay in the park (plus two campgrounds â scroll down to read about those) â the Bryce Canyon Lodge. The location is great, but itâs going to be expensive and itâs a little dated. That being said, itâs a solid choice if you want to stay in the park and arenât on board for camping.\n\nStaying Outside the Park\n\nIf youâre looking for more options, youâll need to look outside the park to the towns of Bryce and Tropic.\n\nThe best place to stay to be close to the park is in the town of Bryce. Itâs as close as it gets to the entrance of the park, and youâve got a few options. Unfortunately, the selection isnât great.\n\nThe Best Western Plus Canyon Grand is, by far, the best place to stay. I know what youâre thinking â âreally Matt? Best Western? That doesnât seem like you.â I hear you, believe me. I had the same reaction. But this is a NICE Best Western.\n\nTropic, Utah is another place you could stay, and itâs about 15-20 minutes outside the park entrance, which means itâs about 30 minutes from Sunrise Point, which is where youâll start the next morning. Generally, Tropic is going to be the cheaper option between the two, but also the less convenient option.\n\nCamping in and Around Bryce Canyon\n\nThere are two campgrounds inside the park.\n\nSunset Campground is the bigger of the two campgrounds inside the park. Youâll need to book well in advance, or be prepared to check the availability daily for a cancellation, which is how we ended up getting a spot for a night.\n\nThe location is great, right across from Sunset Point, which will mean you can walk over and skip dealing with the parking nightmare that is that parking lot in the morning. Oh yeah, and the bathrooms are heated, which Iâve never encountered before at a campground.\n\nNorth Campground is basically right on the rim of the amphitheater, which also means that you will be able to leave the car at camp and walk to the two best hikes in the Bryce Canyon National Park (more on that in a second). There are 99 sites, and for 2023 (May through October) youâll need to reserve in advance.\n\nThe best option for camping (and RV sites) outside the park is Rubyâs RV Park and Campground, which is where we stayed for the rest of our time in Bryce Canyon because we couldnât get a reservation in the park.\n\nDays 8 â 10: Zion National Park\n\nZion is the park Iâve spent the most time in on road trips growing up, and finally we made it back in the spring to marvel at both the canyon itself, and the ingenuity that went into constructing the Mt. Carmel â Zion tunnel, and the trail up to Angels Landing.\n\nBoth were built during the Great Depression by the Civilian Conservation Corps, and are amazing feats of engineering, especially when you consider they were made almost a century ago.\n\nZion is one of the best national parks in the country, let alone Utah, so youâre ending your trip on a high note.\n\nThereâs tons to do and see, and two days in Zion is not nearly enough time to see all there is to see, but you can get a great taste of the park that will leave you hungry to return and spend more time exploring the canyons, rivers, and hanging gardens that make Zion a special place.\n\nThe best thing to do in Zion National Park, by far, is hiking. And there are two iconic hikes in the park that you should tackle â one on each day.\n\nThey are the Narrows and Angels Landing â youâll do Angels Landing on Day 1, then the equally-iconic Narrows of the Virgin River on Day 2. In between, there are some great shorter hikes to tackle.\n\nA note here for RVs and trailers: if your vehicle is higher than 11â 4â or wider than 7â 10â, youâll have to pay a $15 âescort feeâ to pass through the Zion-Mt Carmel tunnel (which youâll have to do to get into the park from the east) which basically means that a ranger will stop traffic in the tunnel and make it one-way so that you can pass through to avoid accidents. More information can be found here.\n\nThe Best Things to Do in Zion National Park\n\nHere are some of our favorite things to do in Zion National Park.\n\nHike Angels Landing\n\nGet an early start on your first day in Zion to make your way out to Angels Landing (shuttle stop is the Grotto). It is, along with the Narrows, one of the best and most unique hikes in Utah if not the entire western United States.\n\nItâs only 5.4 miles long, but itâs a steady climb of over 1,500 feet, which is going to feel like A LOT at this elevation and temperature. Seriously, the trail starts flat for about a quarter of a mile, but then it starts climbing steadily for the rest of the hike up to Angels Landing.\n\nYou need to pack plenty of water (more than two liters per person), sunscreen, and a hat. If youâre afraid of heights, the tail end of this hike is going to test your willpower. Youâll need to do some scrambling and climbing with the help of chains, but the sweeping views at the top will make it all worth it.\n\nHowever, you should know that we stopped before the serious part of the chains started. There are essentially two sections of chains â one that traverses the side of a ridge, and another that makes the ascent to the summit. We did the first section, and turned around before the second section.\n\nIt had rained the day before, which created a fine sand that coated every rock surface on the hike. We werenât super comfortable with our footing as we were traversing the first set of chains, and the unbearable crowds didnât help with the anxiety. Know that it is perfectly okay to stop and turn around if youâre not feeling comfortable. We did, and we regret absolutely nothing.\n\nI mean it when I say to start early. It gets hot in Zion, and the last thing you want is to be stuck at one of the sections with chains waiting for a slow group to go up or down while you, quite literally, roast in the desert sun.\n\nItâs going to take you most of the morning and part of the afternoon to do this hike. Afterwards, head to the Zion Lodge to eat lunch â either a pre-packed picnic, or a meal at the lodgeâs cafe â and relax before tackling some other short hikes in the afternoon.\n\nNote: in 2023, you need an advance reservation to hike to Angels Landing. Itâs meant to control crowds, which we experienced and literally said to each other on the way down âthey should really permit this hike.â\n\nSunset at the Watchman\n\nThis was one of our favorite hikes in Zion, though we did it at sunrise, when the light wasnât at its best thanks to the towering rock wall behind you that blocks the sun from lighting up the Watchman.\n\nThatâs why we have it here, at sunset instead.\n\nIt leaves from the visitor center, and climbs pretty gently to a mesa that is directly across the valley from the Watchman, one of the most famous rock formations in the park. Itâs a good spot to pack a picnic and a couple of beers after a long day of exploring.\n\nHike The Narrows\n\nToday, hop on the shuttle early and head up the canyon to the Temple of Sinawava stop to do the ten mile hike (roundtrip) to the Narrows.\n\nThis hike is through a canyon and river, which means it is CRUCIAL that you check with the rangers about conditions and flash flood warnings before you start the hike. In the spring, heavy water flow from snow runoff might mean that this trail is closed.\n\nSeriously, flash floods in canyons are no joke. Stop by the visitors center to make sure youâre good to go.\n\nDonât let that scare you â the hike through the Narrows is the #1 Zion experience that I think you should have on your trip.\n\nThe hike follows the Riverside Walk for the first bit, then continues on when that trail ends. Youâll pass through narrow canyons, deal with knee-high water, and do some bouldering en route to Big Springs, where the hike ends and youâll turn around to head back the way you came.\n\nItâs going to take you five to six hours, maybe more. To make it as smooth as possible, bring plenty of water, tons of snacks, proper footwear (not flip flops â either hiking sandals like Chacos, or real hiking shoes), a dry bag, and a pair of trekking poles for stability.\n\nAfter that, recharge for a second and catch your breath. Maybe take a nap. It has been a whirlwind of a couple of days!\n\nEast Zion Scenic Drive\n\nThe eastern side of Zion National Park is one of the more unique landscapes in the country. Checkerboard Mesa, in particular, is pretty impressive. Itâs a huge, textured cone-like formation that has checkerboard textures all over its surface.\n\nThe drive through the eastern side of the park, from the East Entrance to the tunnel, is spectacular. You should do it in the late afternoon if you can, so that youâre well-positioned to do the Canyon Overlook Trail at sunset.\n\nThe Canyon Overlook Trail\n\nParking for this one is a bit of a pain due to all the people vying for a very limited number of spots. Youâll need to park along the road and walk to the trailhead.\n\nThe hike itself is short, but a little steep, and takes you up to a spectacular view out over the canyon. Below, youâll see the road switchbacking its way up to the tunnel, and the iconic, impressive rock formations of Zion Canyon across the valley below.\n\nLast light on the canyon from the setting sun is amazing, and itâs worth hanging out up here for a bit until after sunset.\n\nWhere to Stay near Zion National Park\n\nUnlike a place like Capitol Reef, where itâs hard to find a place to stay thatâs close to the park, Zion has some great options nearby in Springdale, Utah.\n\nWhether youâre looking for a campground or you want a comfortable hotel, there are plenty of great places to stay near Zion.\n\nInside the park, your options are splurging on a lodge room or private cabin at the iconic Zion Lodge, or snagging a campground at either Watchman Campground (we stayed here and itâs great) or South Campground.\n\nBoth are walkable to the visitor center, which is where youâll need to catch the shuttle if youâre here between March and November.Â\n\nIn Springdale, which is immediately outside the entrance to the park, youâve got a wide range of options, from budget to bougie. Here are some picks based on what youâre looking for.\n\nOn a budget: I have stayed at the Holiday Inn Express, and itâs nicer than most Holiday Inns, and thereâs a shuttle that will take you to the park entrance right outside the front door. The Best Western is another option, and itâs slightly closer to the park entrance.\n\nMid-Range: I love the cottages at the Red Rock Inn Cottages, and thatâs where we would have stayed if we werenât camping. Flaniganâs Inn is an eco-friendly hotel with nice rooms, a beautiful property, and a great onsite restaurant. The Desert Pearl Inn is a good choice if you need a kitchen (and the rooms all have nice patios overlooking the pool).\n\nBest of the Best: The Cable Mountain Lodge is the best place to stay near Zion thanks to its location RIGHT OUTSIDE the park entrance. Itâs a nice boutique hotel, so itâs not the cheapest, but itâs worth every penny for the location alone. In the same complex, thereâs a small grocery store, a coffee shop, a brewery, and an outfitter that rents bikes and gear for the Narrows if you need it.\n\nYou could also stay in a vacation rental in Springdale, which there are plenty of. Thatâll give you more space to spread out and relax, which is particularly helpful if youâre traveling with a group. Nobody wants to cram four people in a small hotel room with two queen beds.\n\nFor a once-in-a-lifetime glamping experience, stay at Zion Under Canvas. Itâs a little further out â 45 minutes from the South Entrance â but itâll make up for the distant location with the superb facilities.\n\nThey have a range of options â from simple âsafari tentsâ that are basically a bed with a shared bathroom (theyâre single-occupancy and nice, though) to âStargazerâ (private bathroom and deck!) and Suites. Some even come with a separate kids tent â perfect for families.\n\nPsst! We have a whole guide dedicated to helping you find the perfect place to stay at Zion National Park â you can read it here.\n\nWhat to Do with More Time in Utah\n\nHere are three things to add to your Utah itinerary if you are lucky enough to have some extra time.\n\nGrand Staircase Escalante National Monument\n\nTime required: 1 full day\n\nBefore heading to Bryce, itâs well worth a stop in Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument, home of some of the best slot canyons in Utah that donât require a permit lottery to access.\n\nThe best way to do it is to tackle one or two of the hikes (if youâre ambitious) on the way to Bryce Canyon, staying overnight either in nearby Boulder, Utah, or completing the hikes and heading into Bryce at the end of the day.\n\nThere are at least three hikes that are worth your time in this area, and which ones you choose basically depends on your ability to navigate a long dirt road with some questionable spots for passenger vehicles and your willingness to navigate tight spots in slot canyons.\n\nThe road to get to the trailhead for Peek-a-Boo and Spooky Canyons is a 26-mile long dirt road called âHole-in-the-Rock Roadâ. Itâs passable in a passenger vehicle, but youâll need to take it slow and itâs going to take you about an hour. Iâd recommend a 4WD, high clearance vehicle to get to the second two hikes on the list.\n\nWe skipped them all because Homer, our Honda Odyssey, was sick of unpaved roads after some misadventures in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nHere are those three hikes, with a short description of each.\n\nLower Calf Creek Falls (6 miles roundtrip): This is right along Scenic Byway 12, which means you donât have to survive a dirt road to get to the trailhead. Itâs a lovely hike through a surprisingly green canyon to a 126 foot waterfall, Lower Calf Creek Falls, which is in a grotto-like setting. Bring a swimsuit on a warm summer day to take a dip in the pool underneath the falls.\n\nZebra Slot Canyon: This trail is not always accessible, since the entry point fills with water after storms. But if it hasnât rained in a while, itâs a worthy five mile trip. I havenât personally done it, but Iâve seen plenty of pictures on Instagram of the wave-like textures in the Zebra slot.\n\nPeek-a-Boo and Spooky Slot Canyons: This hike includes a 15 foot climb on rock walls, and a 20 foot descent with assistance from a rope, along with some very tight spots (12-18 inches wide) through a slot canyon. We didnât make it here because the 26 mile long dirt road scared us and our minivan off, but Iâve heard from family members and friends who have done it that itâs amazing. The reward is two of the best slot canyons in Utah, which means itâs a busy trail. Be careful in slot canyons if thereâs an incoming rainstorm â flash flooding is no joke.\n\nIf youâre looking for an awesome overnight backpacking trip, look no further than the 11.5 mile journey to Coyote Gulch. It has quite a bit of elevation gain, which makes it a little much for a day hike. But the destination is pretty epic. Permit information here.\n\nIf youâre not up for the 26 mile drive on a dirt road, do the hike to Lower Calf Creek Falls on the drive from Capitol Reef, then head to Bryce Canyon National Park that night.\n\nAdd a Detour into Arizona\n\nTime required: 3-4 days\n\nIf youâve got two weeks and youâre looking for a great addition to your Utah road trip adventure, a mini Arizona road trip would be a great option.\n\nZion is just two hours away from Page, Arizona, which is home to two amazing natural wonders â Horseshoe Bend (youâve probably seen it on Instagram) and Antelope Canyon.\n\nHorseshoe Bend is a giant picture-perfect bend in the Colorado River that makes for an amazing sunset location, while Antelope Canyon is one of the most picturesque slot canyons in the Southwest, but is only accessible by guided tour (check out this company, which is Navajo-owned).\n\nOn the way to Page, make a stop at Paria Canyon to hike to Buckskin Gulch. The Wave is also here, in Vermillion Cliffs National Monument, but youâll need to apply in advance to get a permit to hike it. More information here.\n\nAfter Page, continue on to the South Rim of the Grand Canyon, and spend two days at the Grand Canyon in constant awe over the natural beauty and scale on display. Make sure to drive Desert View Road at sunset, hike the South Kaibab Trail, and catch sunset at Hopi Point along Hermit Road while youâre there.\n\nFrom the Grand Canyon, itâs a four hour drive west to Las Vegas. Youâll pass by Hoover Dam along the way, which is worth a stop for the sheer scale of the dam.\n\nCedar Breaks National Monument\n\nTime required: 1 full day\n\nSitting just north of Zion (an hour and a half drive) is Cedar Breaks National Monument. Itâs even higher than Bryce Canyon at 10,000 feet above sea level, which means the ecosystem is very different from most of the places youâve seen so far in Utah. Itâs most similar to Bryce Canyon, with its orange-tinted rocks and ponderosa pine forests.\n\nItâs also shaped kind of like Bryce, forming an amphitheater, but unlike Bryce you canât hike below the rim because itâs steep and dangerous. As a result, there arenât a whole lot of long hikes here, so a half day is probably enough time.\n\nSimilar to Bryce, morning is the best time to be here for the light since the sun sets behind the canyon and mid-afternoon itâs shrouded in darkness. While youâre there, make sure to hike both the South Rim Trail and the Alpine Pond Trail. Both are short and relatively easy.\n\nHow to Plan a Shorter Utah National Parks Itinerary\n\nIf you have less time in Utah, like we mentioned above, rather than trying to fit in the entire Mighty Five Circuit, weâd opt for spending 7 days exploring EITHER Zion and Bryce OR Arches, Canyonlands, and Capitol Reef.\n\nThe first itinerary might look something like this (youâll want to fly in and out of Las Vegas for this one).\n\nDay 1: Arrive in Las Vegas, drive to Zion\n\nDay 2: Zion National Park\n\nDay 3: Zion National Park\n\nDay 4: Bryce Canyon National Park\n\nDay 5: Bryce Canyon National Park\n\nDay 6: Day trip to Grand Staircase-Escalante (Calf Creek Falls)\n\nDay 7: Drive Back to Las Vegas\n\nIf youâre more interested in spending your time in and around Moab (which is where youâll find Arches and Canyonlands), hereâs what it might look like.\n\nDay 1: Arrive in Salt Lake City / Moab\n\nDay 2: Arches National Park\n\nDay 3: Arches National Park\n\nDay 4: Canyonlands National Park\n\nDay 5: Around Moab\n\nDay 6: Capitol Reef National Park\n\nDay 7: Drive Back to Salt Lake City / Moab\n\nThe Best Time to Visit the Utah National Parks\n\nIn general, we think fall and spring are the most pleasant times to be in Utah (we were there in October and April, and it was lovely).\n\nVisiting in the Fall and Spring (March â May / September â October)\n\nFall and spring in southern Utah, which is where the national parks are, are fairly similar. Weâve been in both October and April over the past year, and both were very pleasant times to be there. However, the weather is certainly more unpredictable than the summer â it was 80 degrees and sunny one day, and then snowed the next day on our trip in April.\n\nOn our road trip to the Mighty Five in the fall (October), we found temperatures in the 70âs and 80âs during the day, and between 50 and 60 degrees at night. This varies by park â Bryce Canyon is at 8,000 feet above sea level, and is much cooler than Arches and Canyonlands, for example.\n\nThe parks are still busy, so youâll need to reserve things early â itâs actually still considered high season.\n\nVisiting in the Summer (June â August)\n\nSummer is crowded and blazing hot. In the United States, a lot of families plan summer vacations because thatâs when the kids are out of school. The result? Parks are packed, camping reservations are few and far between, and good luck getting a parking spot at the most popular trailheads in the park.\n\nUsually, the weather is the most predictable in the summer, where itâs often warmer and drier than other times of year. Thereâs also going to be afternoon thunderstorms, which are a phenomenon that weâve run into multiple times in the southwest and in Colorado.\n\nSummer isnât the best time to visit Utahâs Mighty Five national parks. Youâll find unbearable temperatures in the heat of the day, often reaching over 100 degrees, which basically means you canât do much during the middle of the day. Youâll need to plan on being out early in the morning and late in the afternoon and drink plenty of water.\n\nThat being said, Iâve been on two separate versions of a Utah road trip in the summer growing up, and Iâm still here. Itâs doable, but not preferable.\n\nVisiting in the Winter (November â February)\n\nIn the winter, the parks are basically empty, but itâs going to be freezing cold. You might even get a little bit of snow, which is a particularly beautiful way to see the Mighty Five in Utah. Pack a warm jacket (we basically wore this jacket every night on our road trip) and some long underwear and youâll be fine.\n\nItâll be in the 30âs and 40âs during the day, and drop below freezing at night. You might even get treated to a nice dusting of snow covering the parks, which is stunning. If youâre planning on visiting in the winter, Iâd avoid camping (although weâve camped in Yellowstone when it was below 20 degrees before) and plan on staying in hotels and vacation rentals along the way.\n\nThe best part? You wonât have to brave the crowds â youâll have the major sights virtually all to yourself. The worst part? Some roads and hikes might be closed due to snow and ice, so you might miss out on an experience or two."
