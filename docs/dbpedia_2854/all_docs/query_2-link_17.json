        "text": "Indoor and Radiological Health (IRH) Branch\n\nCOVID-19 Updates:\n\nAs COVID-19 spreads globally and nationally, we all need to get vaccinated, practice social distancing (i.e., maintaining at least 6 feet distance or 2 arm’s length from others), as well as other important infection prevention measures (e.g., wash hands, mask wearing, etc.) to prevent widespread community transmission. Social distancing can reduce the spread of disease, prevent our healthcare system from being overburdened, and protect the most vulnerable members in our community from infection. If you get sick, please stay home—get rest and drink plenty of fluids.
