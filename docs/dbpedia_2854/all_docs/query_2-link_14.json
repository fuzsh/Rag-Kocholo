        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe distinguishing feature of the 1845 British northwest passage expedition led by Sir John Franklin was not its presumed failure to have met its principal objective, as other 19th century British polar expeditions had also failed to successfully complete a transit of a northwest passage. The feature that differentiated the 1845 Franklin expedition from all others was its attainment of catastrophic status resulting from the loss not only of both ships, but also of all 129 members of the expedition. The emotional impact of the shocking scale of the loss of life was further intensified by grisly reports of cannibalism. Three men died during the first year of the expedition and were buried on Beechey Island, near which the ships overwintered in 1845–1846. By April 1848, at which time HMS Erebus and HMS Terror were icebound in northern Victoria Strait, an additional 21 men had died, including John Franklin. On 22 April 1848, the 105 surviving officers and crew, under the command of Captain F. R. M. Crozier, deserted the ships and moved tons of equipment and supplies, including several boats, by sledges across 28 km of sea ice and encamped on the northwest coast of King William Island, a few kilometres south of Victory Point. Four days later, they embarked on a 400 km journey to the Back River, from which to reach the interior of northern Canada to obtain aid at a Hudson Bay Company Post. The few details known about this escape plan were in a single sentence in a brief written document found 11 years later at the staging camp near Victory Point (Cyriax, Reference Cyriax1939). No written records of subsequent events, including deaths that occurred during the escape attempt, have ever been found.\n\nAll 105 men who set out for the Back River perished, and reconstructions of events that led to that result have largely been based on discoveries of their bodies, bones and graves by 19th and early 20th century Inuit and Euro-American search expeditions, and archaeological investigations that commenced in the 1980s. The geographical locations of these discoveries afforded a means through which to trace the route taken to the Back River, and the skeletal remains and artefacts, and the contexts in which both were found, provided the foundation for later bioarchaeological studies directed at understanding the circumstances underlying the extraordinary number of deaths. Causes of morbidity and mortality of expedition personnel continue to be subjects of archaeological and historical research, and various infirmities, alone or in combination, have been proposed as factors in the deaths, including lead poisoning (Battersby, Reference Battersby2008; Beattie, Reference Beattie and Sutherland1985; Carney, Reference Carney2016; Keenleyside et al., Reference Keenleyside, Song, Chettle and Webber1996; Kowal et al., Reference Kowal, Krahn and Beattie1989, Reference Kowal, Beattie, Baadsgaard and Krahn1991; Martin et al., Reference Martin, Naftel, Macfie, Jones and Nelson2013; Millar et al., Reference Millar, Bowman and Battersby2015; Swanston et al., Reference Swanston, Varney, Kozachuk, Choudhury, Bewer, Coulthard and Cooper2018), botulism (Horowitz, Reference Horowitz2003), scurvy (Cyriax, Reference Cyriax1939; Mays et al., Reference Mays, Maat and DeBoer2015), tuberculosis (Forst & Brown, Reference Forst and Brown2017; Taichman et al., Reference Taichman, Gross and MacEachern2017), and zinc deficiency (Christensen et al., Reference Christensen, McBeth, Sylvain, Spence and Chan2016; Millar & Bowman, Reference Millar and Bowman2017). With few exceptions, these studies have been conducted on incomplete skeletons of individuals whose identification as expedition personnel has been verified (Beattie & Geiger, Reference Beattie and Geiger1987; Keenleyside et al., Reference Keenleyside, Bertulli and Fricke1997; Mays et al., Reference Mays, Ogden, Montgomery, Vincent, Battersby and Taylor2011; Stenton et al., Reference Stenton, Keenleyside and Park2015, Reference Stenton, Keenleyside, Fratpietro and Park2017).\n\nAnalysis of other variables fundamental to understanding events that contributed to the expedition’s failure, such as the geographical locations, quantities, condition and recovery contexts of the human remains, is also based on the underlying premise that the individuals were members of the Franklin expedition. Identification of skeletal remains as Caucasian or of Inuit ancestry is typically based on morphological characteristics of the cranium (e.g. the shape of the eye orbits, width of the face, shape of the palate, width of nasal aperture) (Ubelaker, Reference Ubelaker1989; White & Folkens, Reference White and Folkens2005) and the potential deficiency of assuming that human skeletal remains attributed to the Franklin expedition had been correctly identified as Caucasian was demonstrated in 1981, when morphological analysis of skeletal remains that had been accepted for more than a century as those of a member of the Franklin expedition were shown to be Inuit (Beattie & Savelle, Reference Beattie and Savelle1983; Schwatka, Reference Schwatka1879). Although no special significance was attached to the error, it was an instructive example of the explanatory risks associated with acceptance of unsubstantiated interpretations at face value (Stenton & Park, Reference Stenton and Park2017). It also raises the interesting and unexamined question concerning the criteria on which other identifications of Franklin expedition personnel have been made. The aim of the current work is to provide an overview of the human remains reported or found over the past 167 years on King William Island and on Adelaide Peninsula that have been attributed to the Franklin expedition. The criteria used to assign the remains as expedition personnel are examined, and problematic attributions are identified and discussed.\n\nDiscussion\n\nFifty-four percent of the locations where human skeletal remains were found on King William Island and Adelaide Peninsula and attributed to the Franklin expedition have either been confirmed through physical analysis (e.g. Ami, Reference Ami1928; Beattie, Reference Beattie1983b; Keenleyside et al., Reference Keenleyside, Bertulli and Fricke1997; Stenton et al., Reference Stenton, Keenleyside, Fratpietro and Park2017) or can reasonably be accepted as confirmed based on supporting archaeological evidence. The mass casualty site reported by Inuit at Terror Bay is an exception; however, based on detailed descriptions of the site obtained in the 19th century, there can be no doubt that the bodies being described were members of the Franklin expedition. The summaries also indicate that 46% of the identifications are unconfirmed, questionable or incorrect. This does not rule out the possibility that some of the skeletal remains falling within the unconfirmed and questionable categories could, in fact, be members of the Franklin expedition; however, the basis on which many were ascribed to the Franklin expedition is either unexplained or ambiguous, and their acceptance as Franklin expedition personnel is open to debate.\n\nThe three reports categorised as Unconfirmed lack information needed to support their attribution to the Franklin expedition. Future archaeological investigations on northwest King William Island, at Starvation Cove, and on the wreck of HMS Erebus may ultimately confirm these reports. Surprisingly, nearly one-third of the identifications are categorised as Questionable. Skeletal remains found at Franklin Point, Cape Crozier, Terror Bay and Peffer River have not been relocated, and at Washington Bay and Tulloch Point the bones were removed and reburied elsewhere more than 75 years ago. At Franklin Point and at Cape Crozier, Schwatka’s identifications were based on his appraisal of the shape of the skulls (i.e. “too high and noble looking in the coronal region”; “unmistakable high Caucasian contour”), but he explicitly acknowledged in the case of Franklin Point that there was no evidence to support that conclusion. Nothing found at Cape Crozier would differentiate it from the discovery at Franklin Point, yet Schwatka did not express any reservations about the Franklin expedition identification for the Cape Crozier find. The report of the skeletal remains found at Terror Bay by Burwash contains no information to suggest that the remains were members of the Franklin expedition, and the reasons for the attribution of the two burial cairns shown in the photographs taken at Terror Bay are unknown. Similarly, descriptions of the skeletal remains found by Learmonth at Washington Bay and near Tulloch Point contain no details that would connect them to the Franklin expedition. The bones found at the mouth of the Peffer River were ascribed to the Franklin expedition on the mistaken assumption that it was the same site near Ross Point that was visited by Hall in 1869. In many of these cases, the attribution of the human remains to the Franklin expedition appears to have been strongly influenced by the knowledge that retreating parties had passed through the area, and on the supposition that any remains that were not obviously Inuit, however that might be determined, must have been members of the Franklin expedition.\n\nOn Adelaide Peninsula, the recovery of a sailor’s button and the George IV Half Crown at Tikeraniyou is suggestive, but not conclusive, concerning the identification of the bones as members of the Franklin expedition. Inuit encountered by search parties had many items they had collected from Franklin sites (e.g. Rae, Reference Rae1855) and it is conceivable that the two artefacts found at Tikeraniyou were objects in the possession of Inuit. The use of tooth wear as a possible indicator that the remains found south of Starvation Cove were Caucasian was an important observation; however, the processes that produce distinctive patterns of tooth wear associated with gender-specific tasks amongst Inuit populations are complex (Clement & Hillson, Reference Clement and Hillson2012). Thus, while the observed absence of wear on the mandibular teeth could support the interpretation that the deceased were Caucasian, it would not rule out the possibly that they were male Inuit.\n\nOne of the most publicised and iconic images of Franklin expedition fatalities is a 1931 photograph of William Gibson standing beside seven human skulls and post-cranial bones gathered from the surface of a small island in Douglas Bay. The site was interpreted to be a camp where at least seven members of the Franklin expedition had died (Gibson, Reference Gibson1932, p. 406) and this assumption appears never to have been questioned. However, in addition to the mysterious disappearance of the bones sometime between 1931 and 1981 (Beattie & Savelle, Reference Beattie and Savelle1983), the site’s location, features, and artefacts raise a number of questions about its possible relationship to the Franklin expedition.\n\nThe site’s location in the east-central part of Douglas Bay might, as suggested, have been the result of a group of men encountering conditions of reduced visibility (e.g. drifting snow), travelling far off course, and arriving at the island where they later died (Gibson, Reference Gibson1932, p. 406). It is conceivable that retreating parties became disoriented due to weather conditions or other factors such as deteriorating physical and mental health, and at least one 19th-century British search party had that very experience on King William Island (Stenton, Reference Stenton2014, p. 516). Assuming that travel by sea-ice was still possible at the time, if such an event led a group of men into Douglas Bay, they would have been far off course, heading north–northeast rather than east–southeast towards the Back River.\n\nInformation is limited about the two tent rings observed at the site in 1931, which were thought to represent Inuit occupation, but nothing about their size or shape implied that they were European. Inuit reported seeing tents at several Franklin sites, but with the exception of Terror Bay, where the tents were described as large and rectangular (Hall, Reference Hall1869), little is known about tent structures seen by Inuit at other Franklin sites. Two tent rings were observed at NdLd-6 in 1981 (Savelle, Reference Savelle1981), although none were mentioned in the report of a brief 1995 site visit (Ranford, Reference Ranford1995, p. 3). Eight features were identified at the site in 2014, including two tent rings whose locations appear to match the 1931 and 1981 descriptions (Stenton, Reference Stenton2015). If features other than the two tent rings had been observed in 1931 or in 1981, and if any had attributes suggesting they were of non-Inuit origin, that would have been noted by investigators. This suggests the possibility that the six additional features recorded in 2014 post-date 1981, which may accurately reflect the chronology of occupation, although no artefacts to confirm this have been found at the site. In any case, no structural evidence indicative of the site representing a Franklin camp has been found at NdLd-6.\n\nViewed in the context of its identification as a Franklin expedition site, the nature of the artefact assemblage found at NdLd-6 in 1931 is unusual. Speculation that the assemblage may reflect the dismantling by Inuit of a ship’s boat or possibly a sledge on the island (Gibson, Reference Gibson1932, p. 406) is called into question by comparison of the artefact inventory from NdLd-6 with assemblages from other sites where Franklin expedition boats and sledges are known to have been dismantled by Inuit. At Erebus Bay, sites NgLj-2 and NgLj-3 have collectively yielded nearly 1200 artefacts of copper, iron, lead, canvas, leather, textile, glass, hundreds of nails and hundreds of pieces of discarded wood from boats and sledges (Bertulli, Reference Bertulli1995a; Table 2 in Stenton & Park, Reference Stenton and Park2017). The evidence from the Erebus Bay sites suggests that if a boat or sledge had been dismantled by Inuit at NdLd-6, it would be reasonable to expect a much greater quantity and variety of materials to have been present at the site in 1931 and in subsequent years. If, as the archaeological evidence from NdLd-6 suggests, no expedition boat or sledge was dismantled at the site, it would still be reasonable to expect to find more than a few small pieces of wood at a location where seven members of the expedition had died. At other confirmed Franklin sites where deaths occurred, in many cases in fewer numbers than at NdLd-6, and which have been the subjects of multiple archaeological investigations, items such as buttons, canvas, footwear, clothing, textile fragments and a range of other materials continue to be found.\n\nThe disappearance of the skeletal remains found at NdLd-6 in 1931 eliminated the opportunity for osteological analyses that could confirm their ancestry and, thus, their possible affiliation with the Franklin expedition. Two human bones, a partial innominate, and a deeply weathered human mandible were found on the surface of the site in 2014 (Stenton, Reference Stenton2015). It is possible that these bones were present at the site in 1931 and were overlooked, but their origin and ancestry is currently unknown. To summarise, although the identification of the human skeletal remains found in 1931 at NdLd-6 as Franklin expedition personnel has been widely accepted and publicised, it is suggested that the archaeological evidence found at the site does not support that conclusion.\n\nAs previously discussed, the only confirmed example of an incorrect attribution of skeletal remains to the Franklin expedition was the misidentification in 1879 of a partial skeleton found by Inuit in a grave at Tulloch Point. This error was the result of uncritical acceptance of Inuit testimony, a disregard for the absence of corroborating evidence, and misinterpretations of the historical record. In 2016, 35 years after they had been removed from the site, the bones were returned and reburied (Stenton, Reference Stenton2017). At McClintock Bay, the proposition that the remains found in 1973 were incorrectly identified as expedition personnel could be further explored through analysis of the artefacts and skeletal remains, but their current location is unknown. The collections were reportedly sent to the Canadian Museum of History, but the museum records list the collections’ location as ‘Unknown’.\n\nQuantification\n\nA basic question arising from the discoveries of the remains of Franklin expedition personnel, and one for which the reliability of identifications is crucially important, is the number of the original 105 men who set out for the Back River that can be accounted for. Knowing where deaths occurred and in what numbers is important to understanding events that transpired during the final stages of the expedition. One method of estimation is to subtract the number of individuals discovered by search expeditions from the 105 who departed for the Back River. This approach is made difficult by the proposition that not all of the identifications are correct, by a lack of information for key locations such as Terror Bay and Starvation Cove, by inconsistencies in the historical records, and the variability of the discovery contexts. Several estimates have, however, been attempted (Cyriax, Reference Cyriax1939; Klutschak, Reference Klutschak and Barr1987; Nourse, Reference Nourse1879; Schwatka, Reference Schwatka and Stackpole1965).\n\nUsing information provided by Inuit, who emphasised that it was impossible for them to accurately quantify the number of dead at locations where large numbers of bodies were seen, Hall estimated that 79 men could reasonably be accounted for (Nourse, Reference Nourse1879, p. 403). Hall was attempting to determine the number of men who had died after the meeting between Inuit and the group of white men near Washington Bay, but his calculation includes estimates from the two Erebus Bay boat sites, the body that Inuit described seeing on the ship found in Wilmot and Crampton Bay, and four sets of footprints seen near that ship. In his comments on Hall’s estimate of the number of the last survivors who died near Starvation Cove, Woodman (Reference Woodman1991, p. 176) illustrated how easily the figures can be overestimated.\n\nSchwatka assessed that his party had buried between 17 and 40 individuals (Schwatka, Reference Schwatka1881, p. 257) and Klutschak suggested a comparable figure of between 15 and 30 (Klutschak, Reference Klutschak and Barr1987, p. 135). For both estimates, the lower end of the range is probably the more accurate. If all of the human remains found and buried by the Schwatka expedition were considered to be members of the Franklin expedition, the total number would be 15. This is reduced to 11 by the removal of the questionable identifications at Franklin Point and at Cape Crozier, the incorrect identification at Tulloch Point, and archaeological evidence for the burial by Schwatka of the remains of three individuals, rather than four, at NgLj-3 at Erebus Bay (Stenton et al., Reference Stenton, Keenleyside and Park2015). Citing Schwatka’s estimates, Cyriax judged the number of individuals whose remains had been discovered to be at least 36 (Cyriax, Reference Cyriax1939, p. 197).\n\nTable 2 summarises the number of individuals found or reported, grouped by the proposed identification categories. The table reflects the assumptions discussed in the site summaries, and should be interpreted with caution, particularly for locations such as Terror Bay, where a large number of corpses were reported, but for which no accurate information currently exists. In some cases, the number of individuals reported and the number found by various search parties do not match due to site formation processes affecting the integrity of the sites over a period of more than a century. For some locations, multiple estimates, reflecting different dates and interpretations, are shown. For example, at NgLj-3, McClintock reported two individuals in 1859; a decade later Hall reported as many as five based on Inuit testimony; in 1879 Schwatka identified four individuals, and archaeological investigations have confirmed a minimum of three. At the Starvation Cove boat site, Hall projected that the remains of as many as 25 men had been found, whereas Schwatka suggested as few as four and probably at most 10 (Schwatka, Reference Schwatka1879, p. 133, Reference Schwatka1881, p. 255; Gilder, Reference Gilder1881, p. 106).\n\nIf the remains of the five individuals found at Cape Felix, the Crozier Camp (Irving), Gladman Point (Peglar/Armitage), Setteeumenun (Le Vesconte/Goodsir), and Thunder Cove are combined with the estimated minimum of 24 individuals accounted for through archaeological analyses (Erebus Bay, Kungearkbeearu, Keeuna), the result is a minimum of 29 men. If the remaining identifications categorised in the present study as Confirmed are correct, and using Hall’s estimate of 30 for the Terror Bay site, and Schwatka’s figure of 10 for the Starvation Cove boat site, the estimated number of individuals accounted for would increase to 85 of the original complement of 105 officers and men. Future research will hopefully result in the refinement of these estimates."
