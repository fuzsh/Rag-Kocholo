        "text": "Established in 1847, the cemetery is located across the street from the original St. Francis Borgia Church which was built on Pioneer Road. It is both a visible sign and an ongoing witness to those who rest here and to their families, friends, and our future parish members.\n\nAs we look to the future, the parish cemetery continues to expand. Future plans include columbarium expansion, land preparation, and additional landscaping.\n\nThe cemetery is the final resting place for the communion of saints providing a sacred legacy and remembrance on into the future.\n\nOur Catholic Cemetery supports our Catholic Christian faith and the belief that we will also participate in the fullness of the Resurrection.\n\nFinal disposition is the act of placing the body or the cremated remains in the cemetery. In addition to the traditional burial of the body (interment) into the grave site, there are two choices for cremated remains. Urns may be buried in ground graves, or they may be placed in above ground columbarium niches. (Please see the current fees and policies below.)\n\nCatholics can choose to be cremated. The cremated remains of a body should be treated with the same respect given to the human body from which they come. This includes the use of a worthy vessel to contain the cremated remains, the care and attention to appropriate placement and transport, and the final disposition.\n\nAll remains should be a part of remembrance, permanence, and prayer. If you have any questions concerning the process or maintenance of cremated remains, please contact the Cemetery Coordinator or St. Francis Borgia Church Pastor.\n\nAnnual and perennial or artificial flower placements are encouraged at raised grave markers extending out a maximum of 12 inches in front of the marker.\n\nVases, wreaths, crosses, eternal lights and other personal decorations should be removed prior to winter. American flags should be placed in the 12 inch area directly in front of the grave marker or touching the grave marker.\n\nThe Infant Section contains the graves 46 babies who were buried in the 1960s at the request of the pastor. It is believed that they came from poor families in Milwaukee and the surrounding area.\n\nNow, this is an option for the final resting place for parish infants as well. The Knights of Columbus (with donations from parishioners) erected a monument in memory of these infants buried here.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nQ: Do I need to be a parishioner to be buried in the cemetery?\n\nA: No, the cemetery is available for all.\n\nQ: Do I need to be Catholic to be buried in the cemetery?\n\nA: No, the cemetery is open to people of all faiths.\n\nQ: How much does it cost to bury a loved one at the cemetery?\n\nA: The current cemetery fees and policies can be found below.\n\nQ: Can I purchase a plot or niche in advance?\n\nA: Yes, please contact the cemetery coordinator to make arrangements.\n\nQ: I would like to schedulea funeral at St. Francis Borgia. How can I do this?\n\nA: More information about funeral planning can be found here.\n\nCurrent Fees and Policies\n\nPrices effective January 1, 2023\n\nColumbarium Niche Costs\n\nPer Niche Space Price: $2,000\n\nNote: Crematory urns must conform to the size restrictions of the niche. Urns must be 12x12x12 inches or smaller. The niches are designed to accommodate two sets of cremains.\n\nNote: If qualified, veterans will receive free military service emblems. A nominal attachment fee will apply.\n\nBurial In-Ground Space Costs\n\nCemetery Burial Space: $900\n\nBurial Fee: $900\n\nInurnment Opening and Closing Fee: $550\n\nUrn Vault: $200\n\nInfants buried in the Infant Section: $0\n\nMonument Marker Permit Fee: $50\n\nIn addition to traditional body interment, Saint Francis Borgia Cemetery offers two choices for cremated remains. Urns may be buried in the ground (an urn vault is required) or may be placed in the above ground niches in our columbariums."
