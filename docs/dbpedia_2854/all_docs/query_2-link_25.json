Chronic wasting disease is present in these WMUs, and extended seasons are being offered to help meet deer harvest goals there.\n\nMentored hunters of all ages will be eligible to hunt in the early October pheasant season segment, known best as the junior hunt.\n\nFor wild turkey, fall season length will be increased in 11 Wildlife Management Units (WMUs), and WMU 5A, which was previously closed to fall hunting, will be opened for a 3-day season. Season length will be reduced in WMUs 3D and 4C.\n\nFor furbearers, WMU 2D will be opened to bobcat hunting and trapping. Also, the fisher trapping season will be increased by a week in all WMUs open to fisher harvest. This will allow concurrent fisher and bobcat trapping seasons.\n\nIf pheasant hunting within the Central Susquehanna Wild Pheasant Recovery Area (WPRA) is opened again, it will be open to all hunters. Potential season dates and bag limits will be determined later this year, following data collection within the WPRA.\n\nFind the final 2024-25 seasons and bag limits here.\n\nANTLERLESS DEER LICENSES FOR 2024-25\n\nWHAT ARE THE CHANGES TO THE ANTLERLESS LICENSE PROCESS FOR THE 2024-25 SEASON?\n\nThe Pennsylvania Game Commission has announced changes to the resident antlerless license sales schedule to reduce wait times for hunters purchasing licenses throughout the first round.\n\nMonday, June 24, 2024: Resident antlerless license sales open for WMUs 1B, 2G, and 3A only on a first come, first served basis until sold out.\n\nThursday, June 27, 2024: Resident antlerless license sales open for all remaining WMUs. Resident antlerless licenses are guaranteed for these WMUs in the first round only until July 7.\n\nAntlerless licenses in WMUs 1B, 2G, and 3A have historically sold out in the first round. To avoid overselling, antlerless licenses in these three WMUs are not guaranteed and are available on a first come, first served basis.\n\nAntlerless licenses for all other WMUs will be guaranteed for residents in the first round through Sunday, July 7. Beginning July 8, nonresident antlerless license sales begin, and remaining antlerless licenses will be available on a first come, first served basis until sold out.\n\nMonday, July 22, 2024: Round 2 begins for unsold antlerless licenses.\n\nMonday, August 12, 2024: Round 3 begins for unsold antlerless licenses. DMAP permits go on sale.\n\nMonday, August 26, 2024: Round 4 begins for unsold antlerless licenses.\n\nOne antlerless license can be purchased per round in the first three rounds. Find more details about antlerless licenses here.\n\nHunters will be able to buy 2024-25 antlerless licenses online at huntfish.pa.gov or at any in-store hunting license issuing agent.\n\nPENNSYLVANIA AMERICAN MARTEN REINTRODUCTION PROPOSAL\n\nHAS THE PENNSYLVANIA GAME COMMISSION MADE A DECISION ON THE AMERICAN MARTEN REINTRODUCTION?\n\nGame Commission staff developed an American marten reintroduction and management plan that outlines a 10-year strategy to translocate the species back to the state, then conduct long-term monitoring to evaluate the reintroduction. It included strategies on communications, partner engagement, costs, and timelines.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Board of Game Commissioners opened the plan to public comment in September. Although the majority of the 1,000 responses were supportive of reintroduction, surveys of hunters found 37% supported it, 32% opposed it, and 31% were neutral.\n\nDue to hunter response and concerns about Pennsylvania's current climate and forests, the board, in a split vote, indefinitely postponed final acceptance of the plan at its April meeting.\n\nWhat is the mission of the Pennsylvania Game Commission?\n\nSince 1895, the Pennsylvania Game Commission has worked to manage and protect wildlife and their habitats while promoting hunting and trapping for current and future generations. The agency is focused on putting wildlife first, improving wildlife habitat, following sound business practices, serving the Pennsylvania public and improving support for hunting and trapping. Click here to learn more about our agency and its history.\n\nWhat is the Pennsylvania Board of Game Commissioners?\n\nThe Pennsylvania Board of Game Commissioners is comprised of eight board members, each selected by the governor, and confirmed by majority vote of the state Senate. Title 34, the law that governs the Board, requires that each member be a citizen of the Commonwealth, and well informed about wildlife conservation and restoration. Commissioners are appointed from various geographical districts of the state to ensure uniform representation for all residents. Click here to learn more about the board.\n\nHow can opinions be submitted to the Pennsylvania Game Commission?\n\nThose interested in submitting their thoughts and opinions on an issue related to hunting and wildlife in the state are encouraged to submit a comment to the PGC Contact Form for their messages to be shared with the Board of Game Commissioners and appropriate staff. Those wishing to follow the agency online can do so on the following social media platforms: Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. *Please note: Comments posted on social media sites are always not shared with the commissioners or staff due to the high volume received.\n\nHow is the Pennsylvania Game Commission organized?\n\nThe Pennsylvania Game Commission is headquartered at 2001 Elmerton Avenue in Harrisburg, in Dauphin County. At headquarters, there is an executive staff and seven bureaus: Wildlife Habitat Management, Wildlife Management, Wildlife Protection, Administrative Services, Marketing and Strategic Communications, Information and Education and Automated Technology Services. The agency is represented statewide and has field staff managed out of six region offices: Northwest, Southwest, Northcentral, Southcentral, Northeast and Southeast. Click here for more information about the agency.\n\nIs the Pennsylvania Game Commission funded by tax dollars?\n\nNo. The Pennsylvania Game Commission is an independent state agency and receives no General Fund money from the state's annual budget. The agency is primarily funded by hunting and furtaker license sales, as well as State Game Lands timber, mineral, oil/gas revenues, a federal excise tax on sporting arms and ammunition, and assets that have been procured with license dollars.\n\nMore than half of the Game Commission’s annual revenue comes from license sales, a relatively fixed income source. License fees cannot be increased without approval of the General Assembly. View our annual reports, which include the Game Fund Revenues, Expenditures and “Reserve Funds.” *Please note: Since the Game Commission does not receive funding from the state budget, the agency must maintain a healthy reserve fund balance to continue to operate and fund long-term infrastructure projects.\n\nHow do I submit a Right-to-Know request?\n\nRight-to-know requests must be submitted in writing to the Open Records Officer. A form (PDF) to be used for such requests can be obtained at the Harrisburg Office of the Pennsylvania Game Commission and at Open Records Offices throughout the Commonwealth. Click here for more about regulations related to the Right-to-Know law. Open Records Officer: Pennsylvania Game Commission, 2001 Elmerton Avenue; Harrisburg PA 17110-9797, 717-787-4250, pgcrtk@pa.gov. Office of Open Records: Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Office of Open Records, Commonwealth Keystone Building, 400 North Street, 4th Floor, Harrisburg, PA 17120-0225.\n\nHow do I purchase a license or report a harvest in HuntFishPA?\n\nIn February 2021, the Pennsylvania Game Commission and Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission launched HuntFishPA, a new user-friendly licensing platform for hunters, anglers and boaters. Click here for step-by-step instructions about how to purchase a Pennsylvania hunting license. Click here for more information about HuntFishPA. *Please note: Licenses may take up to ten business days to arrive. Most general and add-on licenses are available on HuntFishPA. Be sure to verify your mailing address when purchasing online licenses. A Hunting &Trapping Digest will be included with your license/permit purchase at no additional cost. The digest is also available for printing and viewing online.\n\nWhere can I find a local hunting license vendor?\n\nThose wishing to purchase a hunting license can do so in-person at one of these License Issuing Agents. Most general and add-on licenses are available in-store.\n\nWhere can I find information about hunting and trapping seasons and bag limits?\n\nThe Pennsylvania Game Commission’s website, mobile app and Hunting and Trapping Digest are all great resources when looking for information related to current hunting and trapping seasons and beg limits. Specific information is by Contact Form or contacting the Game Commission office that serves your county.\n\nWhy can’t I purchase antlerless deer tags online?\n\nState law currently mandates that the Pennsylvania Game Commission utilizes county treasurers’ offices in the antlerless license distribution process. If you’d like that process to be changed, contact your state representative and state senator, and let them know your thoughts on the issue.\n\nHow do I submit comments and ideas about current and proposed seasons and bag limits set by the Board of Game Commissioners?\n\nComments for the Pennsylvania Board of Game Commissioners regarding current and/or proposed seasons and bag limits may be submitted to PGC Contact Form. *Please note: While we try our best, we are not always able to respond to every inquiry.\n\nIs there a way for Pennsylvania hunters to donate extra venison?\n\nYes. Hunters Sharing the Harvest is Pennsylvania’s venison donation program that coordinates the distribution of donated venison to a statewide network of meat processors and food banks. When an average sized deer is donated, approximately 200 meals can be shared with hungry Pennsylvanians. For more information, call 866-474-2141 or visit www.sharedeer.org.\n\nIs it lawful to use an inline during the late flintlock season?\n\nNo. To date, the Pennsylvania Board of Game Commissioners has not taken up any proposals to include inline muzzleloaders in the late season flintlock season. The late season flintlock season is a popular and unique opportunity, as only Pennsylvania offers this special hunt, which is enjoyed by an estimated 75,000 flintlock hunters. The agency is always faced with the challenge of providing as many hunting opportunities as possible, while ensuring the wildlife resource is managed sustainably.\n\nFrom a deer management perspective, it would be possible to allow the use of inline muzzleloaders during the late season flintlock season if the hunters were required to use their antlerless tag for that specific Wildlife Management Unit (WMU). However, allowing the inline muzzleloader hunters to use their unused buck tag to harvest a doe would have negative implications from a deer management perspective for two reasons. First, inline muzzleloaders are far more efficient, compared to a flintlock rifle. Current harvest success of inline muzzleloaders is approximately 17 percent, compared to a harvest success rate of 10 percent by flintlock hunters. Second, antlerless allocations are set at the WMU to harvest a targeted number of antlerless deer. Allowing inline muzzleloader hunters to use their unused buck tag would add additional harvest outside of the antlerless allocation framework. Currently, due to the lesser effectiveness of the flintlock rifle and the relatively few deer harvested by flintlock hunters, allowing them to use their unused buck tag has not been an issue in meeting the agency’s deer management goals.\n\nHow do I report my deer or turkey harvest(s)?\n\nBy reporting harvests, hunters are helping the Game Commission monitor populations and help set future seasons and bag limits. There are three ways hunters can report their deer or turkey harvests: Online at HuntFishPA, by phone at the NEW toll-free number 1-800-838-4431 or by mail (using the postcard in the Hunting & Trapping Digest). Both deer and turkey harvests must be reported within ten days (five days for turkeys or deer taken by mentored hunters, or persons required to make a homemade tag). Reporting is mandatory, regardless of harvest, for DMAP (Deep Management Assistance Permits) and second spring turkey licenses. Click here for full harvest reporting details.\n\nHow do I report a banded waterfowl harvest?\n\nMigratory game bird hunters are encouraged to report banded ducks, geese, doves and woodcock they harvest online at www.reportband.gov. Hunters will be requested to provide information on where, when and what species of migratory birds were taken, in addition to the band number. This information is crucial to the successful management of migratory birds. Reporting leg-bands helps the Game Commission and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service learn more about migratory bird movements, and survival and harvest rates, which are critical to population management and setting of hunting regulations. In 2020, more than 6,000 migratory game birds, including more than 5,000 waterfowl, were banded in Pennsylvania.\n\nHow do I report my bear harvest?\n\nA successful bear hunter must take the bear, along with his or her hunting license and bear license, to a Pennsylvania Game Commission check station within 24 hours of the harvest. Bears should be field dressed before being brought to a check station. Bear check stations are open on each day of the regular firearms bear season, and on select days of the extended seasons. Hunters harvesting bears anywhere during the statewide archery bear season, or during any early season should contact the appropriate region office for instructions to have the animals checked. Hunters with bears to be checked after check stations close should contact the appropriate region office. Click here for full harvest reporting details.\n\nHow do I report my elk harvest?\n\nElk harvests should be reported to the Pennsylvania Game Commission’s Elk Check Station, located at the Elk Country Visitor’s Center, located at 134 Homestead Drive, PA 15821, within 24 hours of the harvest. The elk’s weight and several biological samples will be collected by Game Commission wildlife biologists. Note: The check station for the archery and late seasons is located at a separate location. Archery and late seasons elk hunters will be notified of this location by letter or contact the Northcentral Region Office at 570-398-4744. Click here for full harvest reporting details.\n\nHow do I report my snow goose harvest?\n\nIf you purchase a snow goose conservation permit, you must submit a snow goose harvest online at HuntFishPA, even if you were not successful. Exact dates for reporting vary annually, but are generally January through May. Click here for full harvest reporting details.\n\nHow do I report my bobcat or fisher harvest(s)?\n\nA permitted person taking a bobcat or fisher must report the harvest within 48 hours online at HuntFishPA or by phone at 1-800-838-4431. Click here for full harvest reporting details.\n\nHow do I report suspected sick, injured or nuisance wildlife?\n\nThe most direct way to report an instance of a suspected sick, injured or nuisance wild animal is to call the Pennsylvania Game Commission Region Office that serves the county in which the animal is located. It is best to call the region office directly because the region dispatcher might have additional questions for the caller about an exact location, the time the animal was witnessed or other something else. Time is of the essence when it comes to reporting the location of a wild animal, so it's best to call, as opposed to report via email or social media. *Please note: Our state game wardens are responsible for many things, from protecting wildlife, to enforcing hunting regulations, conducting search and rescues, assisting with biological research, educating the public about wildlife and more. They cover large areas of the state; in fact, many counties have only one game warden assigned. Unfortunately, at times, our wardens are not able to respond to every incident and they must use their best judgement on which calls to respond to first. That does not mean that the agency does not care and that we will not follow up with the information provided. We appreciate incidents being reported.\n\nHow do I report suspected wildlife crimes?\n\nWildlife crimes affect everyone. The Pennsylvania Game Commission’s Operation Game Thief program serves to protect wild birds and wild mammals and encourages those who have information related to wildlife crimes to report details as soon as possible. If you encounter a dead or injured animal that you suspect is a victim of a wildlife crime, please report the instance to the Operation Game Thief’s toll-free hotline – 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year – at 1-888-PGC-8001 or fill out an online form at http://bit.ly/PGCOGT. Calls to the Operation Game Thief hotline are always answered by a secure recording device. Although it is beneficial to provide contact information in case game wardens have follow-up questions, callers may remain confidential. Thank you in advance for helping to protect Pennsylvania wildlife!\n\nHow do I report a road-killed deer?\n\nRoad-killed deer should be reported directly to the Pennsylvania Game Commission region office that serves the county where the animal is located. A variety of entities handle road-killed deer removal throughout the state and the region office can clarify the proper authorities to notify based on the location of the animal. Consumption permits for deer and turkey only: Residents can pick up deer and turkey only for consumption purposes and must obtain a permit within 24 hours. Consumption permits are issued from region offices. Call the region office that serves the county where the animal is located, directly.\n\nWho should I call with a wildlife-related question in my local area?\n\nCall the Pennsylvania Game Commission region office that serves the county in question for the best local, on-the-ground, information and faster response times.\n\nHow do I register for a Hunter-Trapper Education Course?\n\nBy law, all first-time hunters and trappers, regardless of age, must successfully complete Hunter-Trapper Education training before they can buy a Pennsylvania hunting or trapping license. A training certificate, which is recognized throughout North America, is awarded when you pass a test at the end of the course. Students must be at least 11 years old to enroll in a class. Pennsylvania Hunter-Trapper Education courses take place across the state throughout the year. Those wishing to complete the course, who are 11 years and older, have the option to complete it online. Click here to learn more.\n\nIs the Pennsylvania Hunter-Trapper Education Course available online?\n\nYes. Anyone, ages 11 and up, can currently register for Pennsylvania’s online Hunter-Trapper Education course. Some in-person classes are being offered. Click here to find a class in your area. Additional information can be found on the Hunter-Trapper Education page. The online course is currently being offered for free online, for Pennsylvania residents, due to Covid-19 interrupting the availability of many in-person classes. (Prior to Covid-19 restrictions, the online course was only offered for those 16 years and older and included a fee to complete).\n\nHow can I replace my Hunter-Trapper Education card?\n\nHunter-Trapper Education course records dating back to 1987 are maintained on a computer database. Bowhunter Education course records dating back to 2000 and Cable Restraint/Furtaker Education records dating back to 2005 are also maintained. Quick and easy replacement is available online at www.ilostmycard.com. You can also call the Game Commission's replacement card fulfillment center at 1-800-830-2268 for assistance in obtaining a replacement certificate. If you took a hunter or trapper education course before the above dates, you must complete a Hunter Education Program Replacement Certificate Affidavit (PDF) form, which can be downloaded from this site. The affidavit must be completed, signed and notarized before it is returned to the address found on the form. Replacement certificates are usually mailed in 10-14 days upon receipt of an application. Effective July 1, 2013; a $16 fee is charged for issuing a hunter education replacement certificate. Click here for more information.\n\nHow can I become a Hunter-Trapper Education instructor?\n\nThe Pennsylvania Game Commission is seeking knowledgeable and experienced individuals to pass on the tradition and teach both basic and advanced hunter education training programs. As a volunteer hunter education instructor, you’ll be teaching students with an easy-to-use, standardized curriculum for which all teaching aids and materials are provided. Courses average six hours for a classroom format and eight hours for a skills station format. Click here for more information.\n\nWho can I call with additional Hunter-Trapper Education and/or mentored hunter questions?\n\nThose with additional questions related to Pennsylvania’s Hunter-Trapper Education program, as well as mentored hunting opportunities, can contact the Pennsylvania Game Commission’s Hunter-Trapper Education Division by calling 717-787-7015, from Monday-Friday, 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.\n\nWhat is the minimum and maximum ages for a mentored hunting permit?\n\nThe Mentored Hunting Program has expanded in recent years to offer opportunities to unlicensed hunters of ALL ages. Mentored hunters are not required to take a Hunter-Trapper Education class before obtaining a permit to hunt through the program. Mentored hunters, ages 12 and older, may participate in the program for a maximum of three license years. After that period, they must obtain a license to hunt. Youngsters who participate in the mentored program for at least three years before turning 12 are required to get a license at 12, rather than continuing as a mentored hunter. License buyers must first successfully complete a Hunter-Trapper Education Course.\n\nHow old must I be to mentor a mentored hunter?\n\nA hunter mentor must be 21 years of age and possess a valid, current hunting license or otherwise qualify for a license and fee exemptions.\n\nDoes my mentored hunter need to purchase his or her own doe tag?\n\nFor mentored hunters ages 7 and older, the permit includes antlered deer, fall turkey and spring turkey harvest tags. No big game harvest tags will be issued to mentored hunters who are under 7 years old at the time of application. Mentored hunters ages 7 and older can apply for their own antlerless deer licenses, (one antlerless license per mentored permit holder), and DMAP permits.\n\nWhat species can a mentored hunter hunt?\n\nA mentored hunter can only hunt deer, turkey, squirrel, rabbit, hare, ruffed grouse, bobwhite quail, pheasant, crow, dove, porcupine, woodchuck and coyote in any of their respective seasons, and must follow daily and season bag limits for each species, (one antlered deer, one fall turkey and one bearded turkey in the spring, per license year).\n\nCan an adult mentor take more than one JUNIOR hunter hunting at a time?\n\nAdult mentors, (21 years of age or older), may take out more than one junior hunter at a time – as long as each junior hunter under the age of 16 is within sight and verbal control of the mentor. Verbal instructions given through the use of electronic or other sound amplification devices does not meet these requirements. *Please note: Junior hunters, ages 12 and 13, must be accompanied by an adult member of their family, (at least 18 years of age), or by an adult serving in the place of a parent. Junior hunters, ages 14-15, must be accompanied by an adult 18 or older. Junior hunters, 16 or older, may hunt alone.\n\nWhat should I do if I encounter young wildlife?\n\nMany species of wildlife are born in the spring and it’s almost certain Pennsylvanians will encounter young wildlife at one point or another. While some young animals might appear to be abandoned, usually they are not. Their mothers are likely watching over them from somewhere nearby. When encountering young wildlife, be it deer, birds, rabbits or other animals, the Game Commission urges Pennsylvanians to resist the urge to interfere with young wildlife or remove any wild animal from its natural setting, for the protection of humans and wildlife. It is illegal to take or possess wildlife from the wild. Click here for more information.\n\nHow do I report suspected sick, injured or nuisance wildlife?\n\nThe most direct way to report an instance of a suspected sick, injured or nuisance wild animal is to call 1-833-PGC-HUNT or 1-833-PGC-WILD to connect to our centralized dispatch center. Time is of the essence when it comes to reporting the location of a wild animal, so it's best to call, as opposed to report via email or social media. *Please note: Our state game wardens are responsible for many things, from protecting wildlife, to enforcing hunting regulations, conducting search and rescues, assisting with biological research, educating the public about wildlife and more. They cover large areas of the state; in fact, many counties only have one game warden assigned. Unfortunately, at times, our wardens are not able to respond to every incident and they must use their best judgement on which calls to respond to first. That does not mean that the agency does not care and that we will not follow up with the information provided.

Although it is beneficial to provide contact information in case game wardens have follow-up questions, callers may remain confidential. Thank you in advance for helping to protect Pennsylvania wildlife!\n\nAre mountain lions living in Pennsylvania today?\n\nIt is not impossible for a mountain lion to be living in the Commonwealth. But it is unlikely. Pennsylvania has more roads and hunters than just about every other state in America. It would be difficult for a mountain lion to avoid detection. Sightings or tracks surely would be noticed. In 2011, a mountain lion migrated from South Dakota to Connecticut, a journey of some 1,500 miles. It was discovered when it was killed by a vehicle while crossing a highway. DNA tests confirmed the big cat originated in South Dakota and that it also previously had been tracked in 2009 and 2010 through Wisconsin and Minnesota, where the animal's DNA had previously been collected through blood, hair and droppings. The Pennsylvania Game Commission periodically receives reports and photos of mountain lions. Our investigations have determined the overwhelming number of sightings of mountain lions in our state are actually bobcats. Photos submitted as mountain lions are typically feral housecats. Mountain lions have appeared in Pennsylvania in the past 75 years, but when they're captured, it's quickly determined they were formerly exotic pets or show animals. Pennsylvania's last known wild eastern mountain lion was killed in Berks County in 1874. Except for Florida, the eastern mountain lion is believed to have extricated from the east coast by 1900. But as the South Dakota mountain lion proved, in its at least unusual migration to Connecticut, anything is possible.\n\nHow can I help to prevent negative human-bear interactions on my property?\n\nBlack bears eat a diet consisting of plants and meats. During times of the year where natural food sources are low, bears sometimes help themselves to food that is easily accessible, including bird feeders, trash cans and pet food left outside within a bear’s reach. Once a bear finds easy access to food, they are likely to frequently come back for more. Here are a few ways to limit human-bear interactions: Bring pet food containers and bird feeders inside overnight, or completely if bears continually return; keep trash cans inside, if possible, until the morning of collection day; and regularly clean and remove grease from outside grills. A few additional ways to help prevent bears getting into garbage: Keep garbage cans clean by washing them out a few times a year with bleach or ammonia; keep bears from easily getting inside cans by attaching ratchet straps (not bungee cords) across the lid in an “X” pattern; and do not strap cans to a tree or post, as doing so actually gives a bear leverage to more easily access a can if someone is using an actual bear-proof container or using the ratchet straps. If a bear on your property becomes a nuisance by being destructive or dangerous, you can report it to the Game Commission region office that serves the county in which it’s located. Visit www.bearwise.org for more ways to prevent human-bear conflicts.\n\nIs it illegal to feed bears?\n\nYes. It is illegal to intentionally lay or place food, fruit, hay, grain, chemical, salt or other minerals that may cause bears to congregate or habituate an area. In addition, if nuisance bears are being attracted to an area by other wildlife feeding, game wardens can issue written notice to temporarily halt the activity.\n\nHow can I buy a bear hunting license?\n\nHunters can purchase their bear hunting license online, but please allow 10 business days to arrive by mail; it cannot be printed. Bear licenses can also be purchased at an issuing agent where they can walk out the door with the license that same day.\n\nWhere can I find bear harvest data?\n\nBear harvest data is available on a map on the Game Commission’s website. The counties typically with the highest harvest are in the northcentral part of the state, namely Clinton, Lycoming and Tioga counties. However, bear are present all across the state.\n\nHow many elk are there in Pennsylvania?\n\nPennsylvania is home to the largest wild elk herd in the northeastern United States. As many as 1,300 elk freely roam across 3,000 square miles in the northcentral region of the state.\n\nWhere is Pennsylvania’s elk herd located?\n\nPennsylvania’s elk herd is located in the state’s northcentral region. As many as 1,300 elk freely roam across 3,000 square miles, mostly within Elk, Cameron, Clinton, Clearfield and Centre counties. Learn more about Pennsylvania elk. Learn more about elk history in Pennsylvania.\n\nHow can I apply for a Pennsylvania elk hunting license?\n\nThe application period for elk hunting licenses opens when general hunting licenses go on sale on Monday, June 16, 2021, and closes July 31. Hunters can apply online at HuntFishPA for the elk license drawing and check the status of their applications. More information is available here.\n\nHow many elk hunting seasons and zones exist in Pennsylvania?\n\nFor the 2021-22 license year, there are three elk hunting seasons: Archery, Sept. 11-25; Firearms, Nov. 1-6; and Late Season Jan. 1-8, 2022. A new late season bull hunt was added this license year and 20 additional bull licenses are available. Those applying for elk licenses can select which zones they would like to hunt. Big bulls, as well as a huntable population of elk, can be found in each of the 14 zones. Click here for a brief synopsis of the zones. Elk hunters are encouraged to spend some time in Pennsylvania’s elk country to become familiar with the area in advance of the elk hunting seasons. More information is available here.\n\nWhen is the best time to view elk in Pennsylvania?\n\nThe best time of day to view elk is in the mornings and evenings. The most popular time of year to view elk is during the rut, which typically begins in September and carries through October. Click here for ways to be ELK SMART. Check out the Elk Viewing Guide and Elk Scenic Drive Map from the Pennsylvania Great Outdoors Visitors Bureau. Keep in mind, just as the elk herd calls northcentral Pennsylvania home, so do plenty of human residents and camp owners. Please remember to be respectful of private property while visiting\n\nWhen is the peak of the elk rut?\n\nThe elk rut is triggered by photoperiod (day length) and generally begins around the middle of September and carries through early- to mid-October. If a cow is not bred in her first estrus cycle, she will recycle approximately every 21 days, providing additional opportunities for conception.\n\nIs it illegal to feed elk?\n\nYes. Not only is it illegal to feed elk in Pennsylvania, but it teaches them to associate people, cars and/or homes with food. This could cause them to approach people looking for more. Feeding also promotes the spread of infectious diseases by having them unnaturally congregate into small areas. Click here for ways to be ELK SMART.\n\nWhy not work to establish a wild population in Pennsylvania?\n\nThe Pennsylvania Game Commission has been trying to establish a wild population of pheasants for years through its Wild Pheasant Recovery Areas (WPRAs). The goal of a WPRA is to establish a sustainable wild pheasant population that can be hunted. WPRAs are established through partnerships between the Game Commission and Pheasants Forever Chapters or other conservation groups. WPRAs are selected based on potential pheasant habitat available. Wild trapped pheasants are released with the goal of establishing populations of at least ten hens per square mile in the spring. Wild pheasants are released in WPRAs for three years, depending on availability of birds and trapping success in western states. The population is monitored for three additional years after the last release to determine population status and success. The wild pheasants are monitored by Game Commission wildlife biologists to determine survival and population numbers using radio telemetry, crowing counts, brood surveys and flushing surveys. Volunteers help with brood surveys and flushing surveys. There are currently four WPRAs in the state.\n\nWhy stock pheasant that can’t survive?\n\nThe primary goal of the Pennsylvania Game Commission's Pheasant Propagation Program is to provide a quality game bird for regulated hunting opportunities. Initially, the purpose of pheasant stocking was to help establish self-sustaining populations. However, numerous studies have shown that although a few birds may survive long enough to reproduce, viable wild populations are not produced. We raise pheasants because people like to hunt them. In a 1996 survey of Pennsylvania hunters, conducted by the Pennsylvania State University, 61 percent of respondents indicated they would like to see an increase in pheasant stocking, and 72 percent were opposed to closing pheasant propagation facilities to generate more operating capital for agency programs. Certainly, wild pheasants are preferred; however, our stocked pheasants provide countless hours of hunting recreation that otherwise would not be available. These birds are a tangible product for hunting license buyers. They add diversity to the hunting experience at a time when wild pheasant populations are low and provide valuable youth hunter recruitment opportunities.\n\nWhy not close pheasant hunting the day birds are stocked?\n\nAn important goal of the propagation program is to maximize recreational opportunities and harvest rates on stocked pheasants (return on hunter investment). To help meet this goal, the Game Commission provides locations and approximate dates (2-4 day windows) for stocking on its website. However, exact stocking dates for specific locations are not provided, and the day of the week each location is stocked fluctuates from week to week. Rather than restrict opportunity and reduce harvest rates by reducing the amount of information provided, the Game Commission prefers to give each individual hunter the freedom to include their personal preferences on density of other hunters when deciding when and where to hunt stocked pheasants. Closing stocked properties on the day of stocking would reduce overall opportunity and simply shift the initial surge of hunting pressure to first light the following morning. Moreover, this approach would be exceedingly difficult to implement logistically because open and closed dates for individual counties and properties would differ across the state and change from week to week throughout the season.\n\nWhere can I find 2020-21 deer harvest data?\n\nThis spring, the Game Commission released its annual deer harvest report, which estimated hunters harvested 435,180 deer in Pennsylvania during the 2020-21 hunting seasons. Of the deer harvested in the 2020-21 hunting seasons approximately 174,780 were antlered and 260,400 were antlerless deer. Bowhunters accounted for over a third of Pennsylvania’s 2020-21 overall deer harvest taking 160,480 deer (80,130 antlered and 80,350 antlerless deer) with either bows or crossbows. The estimated muzzleloader harvest was 28,260, of which 1,140 were antlered deer. The report is available at www.pgc.pa.gov or by clicking here.\n\nWhat are the benefits of having a concurrent antlered and antlerless deer hunting season?\n\nThe slate of deer seasons approved by the Pennsylvania Board of Game Commissioners for the 2021-22 license year allows for statewide concurrent hunting for antlered and antlerless deer through the duration of the firearms deer seasons in all Wildlife Management Units (WMUs). The main benefits of this change include a simplification of regulations and increased hunting opportunity. Last year, the board allowed concurrent seasons in select WMUs, mainly in areas where Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) had been detected in free-ranging deer. By expanding concurrent seasons statewide, hunters are provided with more opportunities to harvest antlerless deer. It also reduces confusion about which WMUs are open to antlerless hunting. This change, to allow antlerless hunting throughout the season, is not intended to increase the antlerless harvest. Deer populations are managed through the allocation of antlerless licenses. On average, one antlerless deer is harvested for every four antlerless deer licenses allocated. More information is available here.\n\nHow many antlerless deer licenses can hunters apply for in the 2021-22 license year?\n\nThe Pennsylvania Board of Game Commissioners adopted a measure in April 2021 that removed the three-license limit for antlerless deer hunters. Hunters statewide now have the opportunity to apply for and receive additional antlerless deer licenses, as long as 1. Those licenses remain available and 2. That a hunter holds no more than six unfilled licenses at a time. Once a hunter obtains six licenses, the hunter can’t purchase additional licenses without first harvesting deer and reporting them. At no time is a hunter able to possess more than six unfilled antlerless licenses. There is no limit on the total number of licenses a hunter can obtain in a license year. Hunters will continue to mail antlerless-license applications to county treasurers, as required by law. Applications will follow the same schedule as seasons past, where residents, and later nonresidents, are permitted to apply for a license in the opening round, and in each of the two successive rounds for any WMU where licenses remain. The proposal to remove the three-license limit for antlerless deer hunters statewide is intended to ensure that licenses allocated within a WMU are issued to the fullest extent possible. The new process is simpler, since the same distribution rules now apply to all WMUs, and it maintains fair and equitable distribution. The rule change could make more antlerless licenses available deeper into hunting season, perhaps giving hunters who purchase their licenses later a chance to get one. And it likely will result in the collateral benefit of increasing harvest reporting. More information is available here.\n\nWhy must I tag my harvested deer in the ear and not on the antlers?\n\nThis is a game regulation that has been around for many years and predates most people currently working for the Game Commission. We believe this regulation was put into place for two reasons. First, when a deer is transported, either by dragging it out of the woods or transferring it to a vehicle, sometimes the tag is lost. A game warden can prove that an attempt to tag the animal was made based on the evidence of a hole in the ear. However, evidence of attempt to tag would be harder to prove if the tag was placed around the antler. Second, antlers are often the first thing removed from a deer when processing begins. If the tag was on the antlers, there would be no way to identify the head or carcass. By requiring the tag in an ear, the antlers can be removed, but the deer head, at a minimum, and carcass remain identifiable. This is critical for collecting antlered harvest data. Deer aging crews visit processors to examine deer heads to collect age, sex, harvest location and hunter information. Many hunters remove the antlers prior to processing. If the tag were there, this critical data would be lost as the heads would be unidentifiable. Additionally, in Pennsylvania’s Disease Management Areas, hunters who wish to have their deer tested for Chronic Wasting Disease must place the head of their deer with the harvest tag attached to the head to place it in the head collection bin. A hunter can retain the antlers and still have the head tested for CWD if the harvest tag is properly attached to the ear.\n\nIs there a way for Pennsylvania hunters to donate extra venison?\n\nYes. Hunters Sharing the Harvest is Pennsylvania’s venison donation program that coordinates the distribution of donated venison to a statewide network of meat processors and food banks. When an average sized deer is donated, approximately 200 meals can be shared with hungry Pennsylvanians. For more information, call 866-474-2141 or visit www.sharedeer.org.\n\nIs it lawful to find and retain deer and/or elk antlers on state game lands?\n\nYes. It is lawful for individuals to find and retain deer and elk antlers on public land, so long as they were shed through natural causes. It is unlawful for individuals to possess a shed antler to sell, barter or trade OR to offer to sell, barter or trade any shed antler. Please remember and take note, it is unlawful to take the antlers that are found still attached to a skull. *Please note: You must have permission from private landowners before entering their property.

They are wart-like, hairless tumors caused by a virus. The virus is species-specific and poses no known threat to people or other animals. Transmission is thought to occur through biting insects and possibly by direct contact with other infected deer or various contaminated materials in the environment that might scratch the skin allowing the virus to invade. Fibromas are restricted to the skin of deer and do not spread to internal organs. While they don’t look pretty, deer warts rarely affect the deer’s survival and have little impact on wild deer populations. Occasionally, they may become ulcerated resulting in secondary bacterial infections, which would make the deer unfit for consumption. Click here to learn more about deer warts.\n\nWhy can’t Pennsylvania’s Spring Gobbler season open earlier?\n\nThis is the most asked turkey hunting question the Game Commission receives. The agency’s goal is to maintain proper wild turkey management strategies while providing maximum hunting opportunities. The Game Commission has various wildlife management plans, for many game and nongame species, to ensure long-term sustainability of the resource. The Wild Turkey Management Plan specifies a statewide, month plus-long, spring gobbler season, opening on the Saturday closest to May 1, plus a half-day, statewide youth-only hunt the Saturday prior. Opening day is biologically timed for when most hens, on an average year, have started to incubate their eggs. This ensures that all hens have had opportunities to breed with gobblers, and lay their full clutch of eggs, uninterrupted by hunters. In addition, hens are less prone to abandon their nests if disturbed after incubation is underway. Spring hen disturbance and mortality can never be fully eliminated, but by giving them time to begin incubating their nest, we’re greatly decreasing the risk. It’s the success of these nests that dictate the future of the turkey population. When it comes to turkey hunting, Pennsylvania is unique, and for good reason. We are one of the leading states when it comes to turkey hunters! We have nearly 200,000 spring turkey hunters and high adult gobbler harvest rates; considerably more than many other states. With that, Pennsylvania’s seasons and management strategies must account for high harvest potential and possible disturbance of hens given the number of hunters. Pennsylvania’s management plan and seasons are not, and should not, be the same as other states, again, to ensure long-term sustainability of the wild turkey population.\n\nWhy are rifles being banned for fall turkey hunting in the 2021 season?\n\nThe Pennsylvania Board of Game Commissioners voted in April 2021 to prohibit the use of centerfire rimfire rifles and handguns during the fall turkey season in response to concerns about spring harvest density being below goal in 15 of the state’s 23 Wildlife Management Units. Previous Game Commission research has shown that reducing the fall season by one week allows more hens to survive to spring and reproduce. The board approved staff’s recommendation to shorten the fall seasons in 15 WMUs as its standard method of targeting hen harvest reductions in specific units. The board also prohibited the use of rifles in the fall season to potentially further reduce the harvest by 20 percent, statewide. This reduction likely will be more in the central part of the state where rifle harvest is highest. Reducing the fall season in some WMUs and prohibiting rifles should allow turkey populations to reach harvest density goals without further decreasing season lengths in the future. To learn more about this action, and for an update on the status of turkey management in the Commonwealth, please review the wild turkey biologist's January 2021 report to the board.\n\nWith a decline in turkey population, why not eliminate the second Spring Gobbler tag?\n\nWith declining turkey populations in many Wildlife Management Units, it might seem logical to eliminate the second spring gobbler tag to reduce harvest. However, the spring season does not impact the overall annual turkey population, due to the timing of when the season opens after peak breeding, and when more than half of the hens have begun incubating eggs. The most important aspect of the spring turkey season is this timing. The Game Commission has a carefully timed season that intentionally finds middle ground between peak gobbling and a safe nesting period. On average, more mature birds are taken than “jakes” (first-year males), even with the second tag, and those older gobblers have a lower natural survival of living until next spring. Taking hunting out of the equation, the nature of mature birds in spring (gobbling and displaying) makes them more susceptible to natural predation. Harvesting 3-year-old gobblers during the spring is compensatory mortality, since most would die from predation if they are not harvested. However, jakes have high probability of natural survival to the next year. Hunters overwhelmingly pass on jakes, further enhancing their survival to fill the place of older toms removed after breeding each year with minimal impact to the population. While a greater number of turkeys are harvested each spring than fall, the fall harvest is what really matters. The fall harvest is additive mortality, since most of those birds would otherwise survive into the spring, and on average about 60 percent are hens. Harvest management to improve turkey numbers is with more conservative fall seasons\n\nWhy aren’t fall turkey seasons the same throughout the state?\n\nFall seasons differ according to the wild turkey population density in each Wildlife Management Unit, varying from closed to 3 weeks + a 3-day Thanksgiving holiday season. Each hunting license comes with one fall turkey tag (and one spring tag), so we regulate fall harvest by season length. Even though the majority of the harvest occurs during the first week of the season, our harvest data show that fifteen to eighteen percent of the harvest can occur the last Monday-Friday of the season, so the longer the fall season length the higher the harvest. During the fall season any turkey can be harvested because jakes, young males, are difficult to distinguish from females this time of year. Still, our research shows females (both juvenile and adult) comprise a larger portion of the fall harvest than males. Our management and research have shown that we shouldn't overharvest females, so we set the fall season length conservatively.\n\nWhat factors are causing turkey populations to decline?\n\nDuring the 1990s turkeys exhibited rapid population expansion facilitated by a combination of: restoration (trap & transfer), suppressed predator populations (much more trapping than today and rabies was more evident), more controlled hunting seasons, and habitat availability. Since turkey restoration efforts 5 environmental factors have changed and the interactions of these five factors can negatively affect turkey populations. These factors include: habitat, weather, predation, disease and hunting mortality. Habitat changes that can result in lower turkey populations include, a lower variety of habitat types, lower habitat quality (particularly due to exotic species replacing native species), lower number of mast-producing trees (particularly oaks and cherry), lower percentage of younger age-class forests, and less nesting brood cover for turkeys. Weather, especially during spring nesting season can affect turkey populations. Wet springs are associated with greater potential for predation of nests and hens may be more prone to abandon nests in wet weather. The reason biologists believe predation rates increase in wet weather has to do with scenting conditions. Wet hens may leave a more significant scent trail allowing predators to be more successful at finding nests. Predation typically only limits local turkey populations. However, the loss of nesting brood cover for turkeys and their young may cause turkeys to be more vulnerable to predation during nesting season. We do not currently know the effects of disease turkey populations. However, diseases may interact with other population influences, such as habitat & weather, and result in population declines. Hunting mortality or number of turkeys harvested, especially in the fall, can affect turkey population due to the harvest of hens. Gobblers harvested during the spring season do not impact the overall turkey population because the males we harvest are taken after peak breeding and when over half of the hens have begun incubating eggs. Therefore, the best way to improve turkey numbers, is by reducing the fall harvest. The interaction of these factors, such as a high fall harvest rate coupled with poor poult production due to adverse spring weather with poor habitat quality, predation and minor disease, impact populations. Several consecutive years of this add up to severely limit the population.\n\nDo lots of hens mean fewer gobblers?\n\nNo. Large numbers of hens in the woods can mean lots of hung-up gobblers in the spring, but an abundance of female turkeys only helps gobbler populations. With lots of hens breeding in the spring, turkey populations can rise quickly. Turkeys aren't like deer, which can overpopulate a given area and strip it of available food. Because turkeys eat a variety of foods, large populations won't damage their habitat. The wild turkey feeds primarily on acorns, waste grain, insects and grasses, which are unlikely to be depleted at the same time. A turkey's ability to forage from a variety of sources enables large populations to thrive in small areas, according to Weyerhauser’s Southern Wildlife Program Manager Dr. Darren Miller. A high hen-to-gobbler ratio is also not a problem for turkey populations. Male turkeys will mate with multiple hens in a given breeding season, or even in a single day. This allows many hens to be bred, even when a much lower number of gobblers than hens exists, ensuring an adequate hatch to sustain the population. Because the success of a seasons' offspring can be directly affected by poor weather in the spring, an abundance of hens can make it easier for a population to recover from poor hatch years. Populations with an abundance of hens have rebounded from poor hatch years in as few as two years, producing more gobblers than areas without an abundance of hens. The gobbler population in a given area is directly related to the reproductive success of hens in the population. The more hens there are to be bred, the more gobblers a hunter can expect to see in future seasons, Senior Vice President for Conservation Programs Dr. James Earl Kennamer said.\n\nHow are waterfowl seasons set?\n\nAnnual migratory game bird seasons are selected by states from frameworks established by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). Game Commission selections are made after reviewing the previous year’s hunter harvests, population survey data and public input.\n\nWhy can’t waterfowl be hunted on Sundays?\n\nIf Sundays were added to the legal waterfowl seasons, Pennsylvania waterfowl hunters would actually lose hunting opportunities.\n\nThere are geese everywhere, why does the Atlantic Population (AP) Zone have a one bird daily limit for the 2021-22 season?\n\nThere is one significant change to Pennsylvania waterfowl seasons for the upcoming season which drops the bag limit during the regular season in the Atlantic Population (AP) goose zone to one Canada goose a day. This change is necessary to reduce harvest rates to a level that will allow for growth of this migratory Canada goose population. The population declined significantly and experienced a near total reproductive failure in 2018. The lowered bag limit should allow AP Canada goose populations to rebound.\n\nHow do I report a banded waterfowl harvest?\n\nMigratory game bird hunters are encouraged to report banded ducks, geese, doves and woodcock they harvest online at www.reportband.gov. Hunters will be requested to provide information on where, when and what species of migratory birds were taken, in addition to the band number. This information is crucial to the successful management of migratory birds. Reporting leg-bands helps the Game Commission and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service learn more about migratory bird movements, and survival and harvest rates, which are critical to population management and setting of hunting regulations. In 2020, more than 6,000 migratory game birds, including more than 5,000 waterfowl, were banded in Pennsylvania.\n\nWhere are managed dove fields located on state games lands?\n\nHabitat crews on state game lands manage hundreds of acres of managed dove fields each year. A map of these managed dove fields is available online. These fields are an exciting and new opportunity to take advantage of the most abundant and wide-ranging game bird in North America. Although mourning doves are considered a migratory game bird species, many of the doves we have in Pennsylvania reside here throughout the winter and provide an excellent opportunity late into the season. More information about dove hunting in Pennsylvania, as well as managed dove fields on game lands is available here.\n\nWhy is there no post-Christmas grouse hunting season?\n\nThe post-Christmas grouse season, (hereafter “late season”), is well-loved by many grouse hunters. It is a time to be in the woods with few other people. Ticks are inactive and temperatures are just right for running the dogs. And a quiet, snowy covert makes a grouse flush all-the-more dramatic. Unfortunately, due to recent declines in hunter flush rates and brood observations, the 2019-20 grouse season recommendation calls for a continued statewide closure of the late season for at least one year. Future season-setting will be guided by a consistent and transparent process based on grouse abundance, summer sightings and disease risk. This “responsive harvest framework” recommends a reduced late season when grouse populations are low, then increasing late season length as populations improve. Several states have shortened or closed their grouse season after grouse populations crashed. This framework represents an effort to proactively revise Pennsylvania’s season-setting process to respond to declines, while we still have a functional statewide population. Learn more about ruffed grouse management here.\n\nCan trapping greatly reduce wildlife populations, even causing them to become threatened or extinct? Isn’t that what happened to beaver and river otter in Pennsylvania?\n\nDuring early exploration and settlement in Pennsylvania and other states, many furbearing species were trapped to the point of extirpation. At this time, there were no regulations in place to prevent that, nor was there anyone responsible for managing the wildlife. Fortunately, with the advent of the Game Commission, over time trapping became much more regulated with strict seasons placed on each species. The agency worked hard to restore many of these species back to the Commonwealth, and that continues today with success stories for beaver, river otter, bobcat and fisher. Currently, trapping is only allowed for species with abundant populations and for species who’s populations were reintroduced and are still growing – like bobcat, fisher, and river otter – only one animal per license year may be harvested and only in areas where populations are high enough to support harvest. Through rigorous scientific process, biologists manage and track population trends and harvest very closely each year to inform management decisions while game wardens work tirelessly to enforce the laws and regulations on trapping. With proper management, trapping allows for sustainable use of this valuable wildlife resource.\n\nI’ve seen pictures of traps with large teeth on them in the past or pictures of large birds of prey with traps on their legs. Isn’t trapping inhumane and indiscriminate?\n\nTraps are a tool that can be used for a variety of reasons. Unfortunately, just like any tool, they can be used inappropriately and result with negative impact. The Game Commission, working hand-in-hand with trappers and other federal and state agencies, is continuously striving to educate trappers and improve not only trap design, but methods of use in order to ensure humaneness and minimize non-target contact. Probably the most revolutionary advancement towards this goal has been the Best Management Practices (BMP) completion. Through stringent trap testing, BMP’s provide a guide to trappers for ensuring animal welfare and trap efficiency for each individual species. Pennsylvania has embraced these BMPs and put additional regulations in place to ensure trapping follows these principles. An example of this is the ban on jaw-toothed traps, as well as a size limit on certain traps. When traps are used properly and following the BMPs, they are very selective in what they catch, and along with state regulations, avoid non-targets like birds of prey. Animal welfare is important not only to the public, but to wildlife managers and trappers alike, and will continue to be a critical component of trapping in Pennsylvania.\n\nWhy should I care about trapping? Isn’t trapping just a few folks each year trying to make money from pelts? I’m not a trapper, so whether trapping is allowed or not, why does it matter to me?\n\nThis is a question that resounds with many Pennsylvanian’s whether they are outdoor enthusiasts or not. Although Pennsylvania still has more trapper’s than probably any other state at around 44,000 individuals, this is still a small percentage of the Commonwealths estimated 12.8 million residents. There are many benefits to regulated trapping, but here are just a few examples: Trapping is used to protect endangered and threatened species during critical times of the year such as sea turtle nests or ground nesting birds like the piping plover. Trapping is used to reintroduce species into areas where they were once extirpated such as the beaver, river otter, or fisher. Trapping protects public health and safety. For example, rabies prevention and roadway flooding from beavers. Trapping provides relief from property damage for example from livestock predation or agricultural crops. In Pennsylvania, one of the most important things that trapping provides is data and information used to help assess and make decisions on management of this suite of species. Trappers assist biologists by providing important biological samples that inform managers on the health of the population. The information also allows for monitoring population trends and identifying any potential issues that may arise. In order to successfully manage furbearers in the Commonwealth, and ensure healthy populations into the future, trapping matters to all of us.\n\nHow many state game lands are in Pennsylvania and how many acres do they span?\n\nPennsylvania has 308 state games lands, which span more than 1.5 million acres. Penn's Woods is our state's nickname due to our forests, which blanket more than 60 percent of our state, and more than 92 percent of our state game lands.\n\nWho manages Pennsylvania’s state game lands system?\n\nThe Game Commission manages this land primarily to provide the best habitat for wildlife, but also to provide opportunities for lawful hunting and trapping. Secondary recreational uses are also permitted in accordance with the Game Commission's regulations.\n\nWhere can I learn more about Pennsylvania’s state game lands?\n\nClick here for information, including regulations, maps, public shooting ranges, seasonal road schedules, access for hunters with disabilities, designated routes for horses and bicycles and more. For information about local game lands, please reach out to the Game Commission region office that serves the county in which the lands are located.\n\nIs it lawful to use E-bikes on state game lands in Pennsylvania?\n\nNo. Electronic bikes are not allowed to be used on state game lands at this time.\n\nCan I use trail cameras on state game lands?\n\nYes. It is legal to use trail cameras on state game lands. But please note that it is unlawful to put food out around the camera to attract wildlife to the area. It is also unlawful to attach the camera to a tree in such a way that it causes damage.\n\nCan I use a metal detector on state game lands?\n\nThere is no prohibition, per se, on metal detecting on state game lands. However, it is unlawful to remove any historical or archeological artifact. Several regulations regarding the use of state game lands prevent the removal of any such artifact, or any other objects, besides lawfully taken fish and wildlife, mushroom and/or berries. Removal of other items is strictly prohibited. It is also unlawful to dig on state game lands.\n\nAm I allowed to remove mushrooms and/or berries on state game lands?\n\nYes. Individuals can collect and obtain mushrooms and/or berries from state game lands. It's important to note that individuals cannot take firewood from state game lands. Click here to read more about state game lands regulations.\n\nWhat is a prescribed fire?\n\nA prescribed fire, or prescribed burn, is an organized, coordinated effort that works to apply fire at the right place, at the right time, and at the right intensity to improve the health and resilience of forests, grasslands and shrublands. A prescribed fire is very different from a wildfire because it is planned months, sometimes even years, in advance. The burns are conducted under precise weather conditions (i.e., the prescription) by trained crews. Wildfires on the other hand, are unplanned fires that occur during extreme conditions, which can pose threats to public safety and cause damage to natural resources.\n\nWho conducts burns on State Game Lands?\n\nThe Game Commission is responsible for prescribed fires conducted on State Game Lands and lands enrolled in the Hunter Access Program. The agency employs more than 200 habitat management staff, which includes foresters and land managers, many of whom participate on burn crews as one of their many duties. The Game Commission often partners with organizations like the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, The Nature Conservancy, Letterkenny Army Depot, and Fort Indiantown Gap, among others, which allows more burns to be accomplished across all lands.\n\nWhy are prescribed fires good?\n\nFire improves wildlife habitat and hunting opportunities by increasing soft mast production in shrubs like blueberry, huckleberry and blackberry. They rejuvenate succulent browse plants preferred by deer and elk, which promotes oak habitats, and their vitally important acorns, and maintains grasses and broadleaf plants sought by brooding turkeys and grouse. Prescribed burns also reduce the severity of unplanned wildfires by removing leaves, thick grasses, and forest debris that accumulate without regular fire.\n\nWhen are prescribed fires scheduled?\n\nPrescribed fires can be conducted throughout the year, depending on the ecological objectives. In Pennsylvania, most burns take place in March, April, May and November when grass is dormant and leaves are off, allowing sunlight and wind to dry the forest floor. While weather conditions and dryness are the primary factors for scheduling, the Game Commission also considers potential impacts to plants and animals, particularly those listed as \"threatened\" or \"endangered,\" and adjusts burn timing accordingly to reduce conflicts.\n\nWhat happens on the day of the burn?\n\nThe burn area will be closed to public access through a variety of notification methods, including signage at the game lands and through the Game Commission's online Hunter Notification map. The crew is briefed on the burn plan and forecasted weather conditions. A contained \"test fire\" is typically lit mid- to late-morning in a small area to see if conditions are appropriate for proceeding with the full operation. If the test fire achieves expected results, and weather conditions remain within the prescription, crews will begin burning along the firebreak on the downwind or uphill side of the unit to widen the control line, which helps to ensure that the remainder of the burn will stay contained. Crews will then continue burning into the wind and downslope, sending fire into the previously burned or blackened area. This process continues until the whole unit is burned out. While ignition is taking place, additional crews patrol the firebreak perimeter to ensure the fire stays where it's supposed to. Other crew members are assigned to monitor the weather and smoke conditions throughout the day to ensure the fire stays within its prescription and is achieving the desired ecological effects. Smoke will be visible during the burn and might be seen for many miles. Smoke will generally dissipate once ignition is complete but may linger in the immediate vicinity for several hours after the burn while downed logs smolder and burn out. Crews will remain on site until they are sure the fire is contained to the burn unit and is out cold along the firebreaks.\n\nWhat does the area look like after the burn?\n\nImmediately after the burn, the ground will be black until regrowth occurs, which typically takes place within a few days, in some cases several weeks, depending on the time of year. In the forest, fires typically just consume the leaves, sticks and low growing vegetation. Mature trees are left standing and are typically not impacted by the fire, (unless that is the desired effect). Mid-level vegetation is often left standing, but is often top-killed by the fire, meaning the stem is dead but it will resprout from the roots. These resprouts provide valuable browse for wildlife. The increased light provided from knocking back small saplings and brush coupled with reduction in leaf litter or grass thatch will greatly enhance opportunities for new species to grow, particularly native grasses and forbs.\n\nIs wildlife harmed by prescribed fire?\n\nThe Game Commission primarily burns to benefit wildlife and maintain the long-term health of their habitats. Crews are highly trained and qualified to light fires in a way that allows wildlife to escape, often with crew members walking through units before and during burns to ensure the area is clear of wildlife. (Remember: Prescribed burns are not the same as wildfires.) Yet even with these precautions, there are rare instances when animals and/or their nests may get burned. Yet, all is not lost. We work closely with wildlife biologists to ensure that while some nests may be lost throughout the year due to prescribed fire activities, the burns are restoring acres of healthy habitat that ensure significantly more nests will be successful for many years into the future. Furthermore, Game Commission biologists and emerging science indicates that wildlife are often attracted to burned areas immediately after the fire, occasionally entering burned areas before the smoke has even cleared, (to forage on a sudden flush of insect activity), or shortly afterwards, when a fresh flush of vegetation appears. Finally, it is important to note that the agency's prescribed fires are purposely conducted on a very small percentage of the overall land base, (less than 1 percent annually), providing significant amounts of refuge for animals that may be temporarily displaced.\n\nHow will I know where and when burns are planned?\n\nThe Game Commission maintains a public map that shows where prescribed burns are being planned. This map is updated seasonally and will even show \"Burn Imminent\" status when a burn date has been confirmed. Users must realize that these decisions are highly weather dependent and therefore cannot be made more than a few days in advance. In addition to the map, users will see signage posted around the burn unit identifying the area as a planned burn during the coming weeks or months. The decision to burn can be made as late as the morning of the burn.\n\nWhat is Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD)?\n\nChronic Wasting Disease (CWD) is a neurological disease that affects members of the cervid family (e.g., deer, elk, moose and reindeer/caribou). Like mad cow disease in cattle, scrapie in sheep and goats, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in humans, it's caused not by a virus or bacteria, but by abnormal prions, or proteins. Those altered prions kill brain cells and ultimately lead to tiny holes in the brains of infected animals. Those impacts are not immediately visible as CWD-infected animals might not show symptoms of the disease for 18 to 24 months. But all white-tailed deer and elk that contract CWD die. There are no exceptions.

Click here for more information. CWD has since spread from those initial detection sites over a larger geographic area. Disease Management Areas are found in all or parts of Adams, Armstrong, Bedford, Berks, Blair, Cambria, Centre, Clarion, Clearfield, Cumberland, Fulton, Franklin, Huntingdon, Indiana, Jefferson, Juniata, Lancaster, Lebanon, Mifflin, Perry, Somerset, Snyder, Union and Westmoreland counties.\n\nWhat is the Game Commission doing to manage CWD?\n\nThe Game Commission’s CWD Response Plan was adopted by the Pennsylvania Board of Game Commissioners in July 2020 and was developed in collaboration with Pennsylvania stakeholders, CWD experts from state and federal wildlife agencies and non-government organizations from across the country. It is available to view online at www.pgc.pa.gov/cwd. To limit the effect of CWD in deer and elk populations, regulations restricting the movement of high-risk parts, banning feeding within Disease Management Areas (DMAs) and prohibiting the use of urine-based attractants in DMAs are in place. Since there is no treatment or cure, limiting deer contact and interaction by increasing deer harvests across DMAs is one of the only ways to manage CWD on the landscape. Read more here.\n\nWhere can I see the Game Commission’s CWD surveillance results?\n\nThe Game Commission’s CWD Surveillance Dashboard is available online at https://pgcdatacollection.pa.gov/CWDResultsLookup. The dashboard is updated weekly and features an all-new way to view past and current information related to the disease. This includes data organized by season, species (white-tailed deer or elk), age, collection method, sex and collection site (down to the township level). It also allows hunters who submitted their deer for CWD testing to directly access results online. A tutorial on how to navigate the dashboard is available on the Game Commission’s YouTube channel.\n\nWhat if I’m hunting in an area where CWD is known to exist?\n\nFollow these guidelines to prevent the spread of the disease: 1. Be familiar with the regulations and guidelines for the transportation of harvested game where you are hunting; 2. Bone out the meat from your animal; 3. Minimize the handling of and cutting through brain and spinal tissues; 4. Have your animal processed in the area in which it was harvested so high-risk parts can be disposed of properly; 5. Ask your butcher to process your meat individually, without meat from other animals, or process your own meat; 6. Only bring low-risk parts back to Pennsylvania or out of a DMA or Established Area; 7. Have your animal tested and do not consume parts of any animal testing positive for CWD or displaying outward signs of disease. Click here for more information.\n\nHow is CWD spread?\n\nCWD is transmitted both directly through animal-to-animal contact and indirectly through food and soil contaminated with bodily excretions including feces, urine and saliva. Contaminated carcasses or high-risk carcass parts which includes the head (including brain, tonsils, eyes and any lymph nodes); spinal cord backbone; spleen; skull plate with attached antlers, if visible brain or spinal cord tissue is present; cape, if visible brain or spinal cord tissue is present; upper canine teeth, if root structure or other soft tissue is present; any object or article containing visible brain or spinal cord tissue; unfinished taxidermy mounts; and brain-tanned hides may also spread the disease indirectly through environmental contamination, which lasts for years, if not decades.\n\nHow can I tell if an animal has CWD?\n\nAnimals infected with CWD may not show signs of infection for 12 or more months. Late-stage signs of CWD-infected animals include an extreme loss of body condition; excessive drinking, urination, salivation and drooling; and behavioral and neurologic changes such as repetitive walking patterns, droopy ears, a wide-based stance, and listlessness. Some animals lose their fear of humans and predators. There is no known cure. It is important to note that these symptoms are characteristic of many diseases other than CWD. Confirming an animal is infected with CWD requires laboratory testing of the brain or lymph nodes of the head.\n\nWhat can I do to help?\n\nDo not feed deer. Supplemental feeding causes deer and elk to concentrate, which facilitates the spread of diseases like CWD. Support proper deer management actions like increased deer harvests in DMAs designed to slow the spread of CWD. Express concerns about CWD to your political representatives. Support increased financial assistance for wildlife and agricultural agencies to combat CWD. Encourage officials at all levels of government to support the steps necessary to slow the spread of CWD across Pennsylvania. If you see a deer or elk displaying symptoms of CWD, report it to the appropriate Game Commission region office.\n\nFor the latest information about COVID-19 in Pennsylvania, please visit the Pennsylvania Department of Health’s website at www.health.pa.gov. We encourage everyone to continue to take precautionary measures during this time and to continue to be safe and responsible during these unprecedented times.\n\nWill the Game Commission refund the cost of my hunting and furtaker licenses if I cannot travel due to COVID-19-related restrictions?\n\nNo. Pennsylvania State law specifies that license fees are non-refundable and therefore the Pennsylvania Game Commission does not have the authority to issue a refund.\n\nCan the public still access Pennsylvania State Game Lands?\n\nYes. Pennsylvania’s 1.6 million acres of state game lands are open for public access, at this time. Being outdoors is good health care and self-care; however, recommendations for social distancing to slow the spread of COVID-19 still apply. Refer to the Pennsylvania Department of Health’s precautionary recommendations for outdoor recreation. Be safe and stay healthy!\n\nIn response to COVID-19, is the Game Commission considering additional hunting opportunities or changes to existing hunting regulations?\n\nAbsolutely, not. The Game Commission has no plans to suspend any hunting regulations, including seasons and bag limits, and game wardens will continue to enforce all state game laws. Pennsylvania’s hunting seasons, bag limits and regulations protect wildlife populations for the long-term. We will get through this pandemic together and the Game Commission appreciates the public’s compliance and support."
