The goal of this program is to connect Liberty Resources’ Peer Specialists and Family Support Specialists to individuals and families who have recently experienced an overdose.\n\nThe DPH receives information on anyone who has suffered an overdose, from both the Rochester Police and Sheriff’s departments within 24 hours of that overdose. The DPH then informs the Recovery Support Navigator Team, and we deploy a Peer and/or Family Support Specialist to that individual and/or family upon receiving the referral. The team starts with telephonic outreach and then works together with that individual in a person-centered approach to develop a plan of support. The RSN Team takes a Peer Model/Harm Reduction approach as well, which means that we are not here to tell anyone what to do, but rather to deeply listen to the needs of the individual and/or family.\n\nEligibility Criteria\n\nThe Recovery Support Navigator program is available for people in need of recovery support and for families of those who are in recovery.\n\nContact\n\nRecovery Support Navigator\n\n175 Winton Rd.

If you have not done so already, do not:\n\nTake a bath or shower\n\nBrush your teeth\n\nGo to the bathroom\n\nDouche\n\nChange your clothes\n\nBrush your hair\n\nEat or drink anything\n\nAs uncomfortable as you may be, if you can avoid doing any of these things, you will preserve evidence that can help convict the person who raped you. If you have already washed up, don’t worry–but don’t wash any more. If you have taken off the clothes you were wearing when you were assaulted, put them in a clean shopping bag and take them with you to the hospital.\n\nGo directly to the hospital emergency room. If you have already called the Help Restore Hope Center, an Advocate will meet you there. If not, ask the hospital to call the Center for you. We will be there as soon as possible. At the hospital, a nurse will offer to call the police for you. This is your choice. The police will not be called automatically, either by the hospital or by Center staff. This is to protect your privacy. There are some circumstances in which hospital staff are required to notify the police: if a gun or knife was used or if there is reason to suspect child sexual abuse. How much or little you choose to tell the police in these cases is still your choice; the intent is to protect you or someone else from further harm in these grave situations.\n\nOur Features\n\nOur program is specifically designed to meet the needs of individuals requiring cognitive, physical, emotional, and behavioral rehabilitation. All of our services are focused on the needs and desired outcomes of the individuals and families we serve.\n\nService Coordination\n\nThe Service Coordinator helps the individual to attain services and to apply to the HCBS/TBI waiver. They are responsible for coordinating and monitoring the provision of all services in the individual’s Service Plan. Together, the Service Coordinator and the individual collaborate to develop the individualized Service Plan, which reflects the individual’s goals, interests, and desired outcomes. Also, the Service Coordinator is responsible for continuing the development, implementation, monitoring, and provision of the Service Plan on an ongoing basis. The Service Coordinator serves as an advocate for the individual in ensuring that all services are implemented as outlined in the Service Plan.\n\nCase Management\n\nIn conjunction with residential services, Liberty Resources also offers Case Management. A Case Manager is designated to help recipients of extended services to receive the most-appropriate services to meet their needs. The Case Manager and the individual collaborate to develop an individualized plan of care, which reflects the individual’s goals, interests, and desired outcomes. The Case Manager also ensures that the provisions of services meet the policy requirements and standards that have been set by the insurance carrier. Also, the Case Manager is responsible for continuing the development, implementation, monitoring, and provision of the patient’s individualized plan on an ongoing basis. The Case Manager not only serves as an advocate for the individual in ensuring that all services are implemented as outlined in the plan but also coordinates and collaborates with any internal or external agencies or providers that are needed to effectively facilitate the plan.\n\nIndependent-Living Skills Training\n\nIndependent-Living Skills Training and Development services are designed to improve the ability of the individual to live as independently as possible in the community. ILST services may be provided in the individual’s home or in the community. ILST services may include assessment; training; and supervision of, or assistance to, individuals with issues related to self-care, medication management, task completion, reduction/elimination of maladaptive behaviors, problem-solving skills, money management, pre-vocational skills, and the skills that are needed to maintain a household.\n\nStructured-Day Program\n\nStructured-Day Program services are provided in an outpatient congregate setting or in the community. These services are designed to improve or maintain the individual’s skills and ability to live as independently as possible in the community. Individuals may choose to engage in groups that emphasize basic work skills, problem-solving, communication, computer operation, cooking, and a wide range of other activities that work on promoting or sustaining their ability to be independent within their community.\n\nResidential Services\n\nResidential services are currently provided to those individuals who have sustained a traumatic brain injury and have a variety of insurances, such as Worker’s compensation, no-fault insurance, or private insurance. The residences are located close to community services and to our Structured-Day Program. These services include support with activities of daily living, community integration, homemaker or housekeeping services, and other personal-care tasks. Also, these services provide safety and oversight of those individuals who require such assistance. The residential environment enables the residents to learn at their own pace and to gain skills that facilitate greater personal independence and self-esteem.\n\nLicensed Home Care Provided by Personal Care Aides\n\nOur Registered Nurse provides an assessment in the development of a care plan that is centered on the needs of the client. A Personal Care Aide not only performs basic personal-care tasks but also provides support with the activities of daily living to help individuals recover in the comfort of their own home:\n\nPrepares and serves meals to fit the nutritional needs of the client\n\nMaintains general cleanliness of the home: launders clothing and bed linens; dusts; vacuums; washes dishes; thoroughly cleans the kitchen and bathroom\n\nEnsures that all needed supplies are readily available for client and program use\n\nSupports and helps clients with banking, medical appointments, and shopping\n\nProvides assistance with self-administration of medication\n\nEligibility criteria\n\nServices are provided through the Home and Community-Based Medicaid Traumatic Brain Injury (HCBS/TBI) waiver and are regulated by the New York State Department of Health. The program also provides services for individuals who have other insurances, such as New York State Insurance Fund, New York State Workman’s Compensation, and private pay.\n\nContact\n\nCortland County\n\n149 Main Street\n\nCortland, NY 13045\n\nPhone (607) 218-6055\n\ninfo@liberty-resources.org\n\nMonday–Friday: 8:00 am – 4:00 pm\n\nDirections >\n\nOur Mission\n\nLiberty Resources offers transitional housing for homeless persons at our DePalmer location. The primary goal of this program is to provide an environment and level of services that will enable residents to attain and maintain safe, affordable permanent housing of their choice.\n\nAt least 92% of the clients who are served at DePalmer House are individuals in recovery from chemical addiction. At least two-thirds of the consumers who are served possess a diagnosed—and often untreated—coexisting psychiatric disorder. Many have had previous, recurrent episodes of homelessness.\n\nDePalmer House is centrally located on the west side of Syracuse and is maintained as a confidential site. The two-story house consists of 10 beds with a full kitchen and dining room, two living rooms, three and a half baths, and a full basement complete with storage. Also, there are two staff offices, which serve as confidential counseling areas. The program is staffed 24 hours a day by a program supervisor, assistant supervisor, three direct support professionals (including an awake overnight counselor), and four part-time relief staff.\n\nScope of Services\n\nSupportive services offered within the program have allowed residents to address longstanding addiction issues that impede their ability to meet their housing needs. Other services-assist residents with complying with their medical treatment regimen, allowing more-fragile residents to improve their health to the point of being able to move into independent housing. DePalmer House program staff provide a variety of support services to meet the special needs of the population served.\n\nDePalmer House offers linkages with social services, nutrition programs, local case management programs, chemical dependency treatment and mental health programs, health care, transportation, and other services and resources.\n\nAt the DePalmer House, patients’ goals include self-sufficiency and the attainment of permanent housing. The program staff assess each individual for needed services and assist them in connecting with these services.\n\nEligibility criteria\n\nIndividuals 18 years or older with a documented HIV/AIDS diagnosis and in a homeless or inadequate housing status who fall below the federal poverty level are eligible for this program. Referrals are routinely accepted from a variety of sources including hospitals, case management agencies, correctional facilities, drug and alcohol treatment centers, and area shelters. Self-referrals are also accepted. Applicants are required to attest, in writing, to their willingness to participate actively in their service plan and to abide by program rules.\n\nContact\n\nOnondaga County\n\nSyracuse, NY 13203\n\nPhone (315) 475-1544\n\nOur Mission\n\nLorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry’s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.\n\nWhat is Lorem Ipsum?\n\nIt is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using ‘Content here, content here’, making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for ‘lorem ipsum’ will uncover many web sites still in their infancy.
