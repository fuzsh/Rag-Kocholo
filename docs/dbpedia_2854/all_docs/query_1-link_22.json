        "text": "St. John XXIII Parish has three cemeteries, all serve as the final resting places for both members and non-members of our community. Only two are actively in use. For more information regarding these sites see below.\n\nTo purchase a lot, contact: Steve Ziebell, Cemetery Sexton at 262-707-1465 OR email.\n\nOld St. Mary’s Cemetery\n\nPort Washington Sites\n\nOn January 25, 1854 St. Mary’s organized a cemetery association. Land was purchased on February 15, 1854 for the cemetery at what is now the west end of Dodge Street bordering on Webster Street. This cemetery served the members of St. Stephen’s & St. Mary’s Roman Catholic Congregations. In 1876 the small brick chapel was erected in the cemetery, this serves as a final resting place for Fr. Sailer & Fr. Bermadinger.\n\n“New” St. Mary’s Cemetery\n\nPort Washington Sites\n\nOn January 29, 1901 the parish purchased 13.5 acres of land located in the Beutel Subdivision in the Town of Port Washington to develop the “new” St. Mary’s Cemetery. Burials began taking place shortly after. The land and grounds were not improved until 1929. The new chapel was built in 1966. The Outdoor mausoleum was added in 1983 and the columbarium was built in 2002. A new Columbarium/Osuarium was built in 2022."
