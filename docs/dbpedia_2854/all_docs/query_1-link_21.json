        "text": "The St. Ann columbarium is a sacred resting place on holy ground for cremated human remains with the same dignity as a cemetery. Dedicated by Archbishop Wilton D. Gregory in 2017, it is a place for our loved ones to rest until our Lord comes again; a place at home in our beloved community and church. Our columbarium offers a very peaceful place for you to come and pray.\n\nAt this time, there are no columbarium niches available for purchase. For more information, please contact Linda Walsh.\n\nThe parish columbarium offers these benefits:"
