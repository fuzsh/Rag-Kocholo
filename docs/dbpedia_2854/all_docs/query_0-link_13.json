A gold panning permit is required! The permit, which can be obtained free of charge, allows for panning gold on a hobby basis. The displacement of any material through the use of a pick, shovel, or sluice is not allowed due to concern for water quality. Archaeological evidence found, such as projectile points, pottery, or bones must be reported to the Forest Office to determine if a major archaeological site is in the vicinity. To obtain a permit, visit or call the Forest Office at 812-988-7945.\n\nThe Lodge at Yellowwood\n\nThe Lodge at Yellowwood is a newly renovated log cabin with all the comforts of home.

The yellowwood tree (Cladrastis kentukea) has bright yellow heartwood that is hard and dense. The tree flowers abundantly but only every three to five years in the spring with loose clusters of pea-like, fragrant white flowers. Seeds are in bean pods similar to its cousin the black locust. The leaves are compound and the bark is similar to the American beech.\n\nPicnicking\n\nThere are picnic areas and one picnic shelter available for day use.
