With many miles of trails that are being improved by King County Parks, Ames Lake Forest is a good option for anyone looking to get away from crowds at Tolt-MacDonald. Keep in mind that this is a watershed though, and be certain to keep Leave No Trace principles in mind in this sensitive area.

After sections of this area were logged and replanted, the Evergreen Mount Bike club took it upon themselves to create the trails at Ames Lake Forest. In addition to mountain bikers, these are now used by hikers, trail runners and horse riders. There are many loop trails in the forest and no trail junction signs, so a map is handy for new hikers using them. The forest is home to a wide variety of wildlife, including deer, squirrels, and plenty of birds.

Be aware that not all of the trails are shown on the maps, as some new ones have been added since the maps were printed.
