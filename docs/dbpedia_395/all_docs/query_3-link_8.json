Smith Jackie Taylor Shirley Jean Rickert Jerry Tucker Mildred Kornman Rex Downing Johnny Downs Lassie Lou Ahern Jackie Davis\n\nSince my earliest childhood I was confronted with the TV Serial \"Our Gang\" (or \"The Little Rascals\") and gave me uncountable hours of fun. It was only a question of time that I have recollected to these rascals in my adult years. Now I'm trying to collect the signatures of the children actors of the 20s to the 40s.\n\nMost of the actors/actresses have already died or have got into oblivion so it's impossible to find out their addresses.\n\nBelow you can see some signed pichtures I could manage to receive (sometimes by mail, sometimes by other collectors). They all have found a special place in my collection. I'm always interested to enlarge my collection with other signatures of the little rascals. Let me know please if you can help me. Thanks.\n\nHistorical survey of Our Gang / The Little Rascal\n\nThe first episodes were shot in 1922 and found an end in 1944. Totally there are 221 single episodes. A complete catalog of all episodes you will find at \"All movies of Our Gang / The Little Rascals at a glance\".\n\nThe little Rascals were called into live through the legendary producer Hal Roach (Roach also spotted the comedians Laurel & Hardy). The trigger for the combination of a child troupe was the exceptional big success of rascal Ernie \"Sunshine Sammy\" Morrison in comedies of Harold Lloyd and Snub Pollard.\n\nThe composition of the troupe was checkered and represented typical children in the neighborhood. The original cast were Mary Kornman (the beautiful girl), Allen \"Farina\" Hoskins\" (the naive negro), Mickey Daniels (the freckled whipper-snapper), Joe Cobb (the pleasant fat person), Jackie Condon (the rich fellow), Ernie Morrison (the rascal) and last but not least Pete the pet with a painted circle around his right eye.\n\nThe success of the rascals was based on the imitation of the world of the adult but at the same time they played a trick or shew a behavior which the adults wouldn't dare to do themselves. It is also astonishing that the children acted extremely natural in contrast to the child stars in the 30's with their pseudo adultness.\n\nThe stories were made from simple pattern but affectionate. At this time didn't exist real scripts but rather there was a short outline of the main theme, gags and other ideas were developed only during the shot. The success of the serial wasn't due to a single person but was the result of a exemplary teamwork.\n\nEach episode offered new adventures for the children. There is a trip to New York where happened the coincidence that the children are able to nabbing a bus, to play deadhead or to hover over the city with a piece of fabric as parachute replacement.\n\nIn spite of their unusual behavior, the rascals never had to expect serious consequences because they tricked the adults with wit and phantasie. Perhaps the children took a sound thrashing after a successful adventure, but after that they show to the audience with a roguish expression that the preceded adventure was worth for this and that nothing could take away their go by experiences.\n\nWhen Hal Roach sold the serial to M-G-M in 1938, it rang in the decline of the serial. M-G-M wasn't able to maintaining the magic which the serial radiated before and was shut down in 1944.\n\nSince then the serial experienced a resurrection time and again through broadcastings on TV. With this they erected a lasting monument to the little rascals.\n\nTommy \"Butch\" Bond (1926-2005)\n\nAsk anyone who even casually remembers the Rascals who Alfalfa’s nemesis was and they’ll tell you \"IT’S BUTCH!\" Clearly, it’s not just the heroes and good-guys that leave an impression.\n\nOur Gang lasted for 22 years, during which time tough-guys came and went. The series never really embraced the idea of a recurring bully that audiences could grow to despise. That is, until Tommy Bond played Butch for four years. Kids in the audiences would happily grow to fear and hiss at Butch.\n\nIn 1931, Tommy Bond was five years old and living in Dallas, Texas when he was \"discovered\" by a Hal Roach Studios talent scout. He was offered an interview with Hal Roach, IF he could get out to Hollywood. This was not a simple task during the height of the depression, not to mention that the roads were often dirt. Luckily, Tommy’s grandmother was able to drive him out to his interview. He was signed on with the Gang to play \"Tommy\". He appeared in a number of shorts, as one of the \"second-echelon\" kids.\n\nFor unknown reasons, Tommy was dropped from the cast after his first year. He managed to pick up free-lance parts for another year-and-a-half, before Hal Roach called him back asking him if he would like to play the part of the tough-guy, Butch. He gleefully portrayed Butch for the next four years, until he outgrew the Gang, a fate which fell upon all Rascals eventually.\n\nAfter Our Gang, Tommy went to Van Nuys High School where he joined the ROTC. After graduating, he enlisted in the Navy Air Corps. Following his stay in the service, Tommy continued his acting career appearing in many different movies. Probably his most famous roll during this period was that of Jimmy Olsen, Clark Kent’s sidekick in two full Superman serials in 1946 and 1948.\n\nIn 1951, following college, Tommy quit acting and became an assistant director at channel 11 in Los Angeles. Twenty-one years of \"smog, earthquakes, and wall-to-wall people\" was enough for Tom, and in 1972 he moved to the San Joaqin Valley where he took on work at channel 30 and remained until he retired in 1990. He has also chronicled his days with the Gang in book which is aptly entitled \"You're Darn Right It's Butch!\"\n\nTommy has been married for 43 years and has one son. Polly is a former Miss California, and sang in a country & western duet known as the \"Darling Sisters\". His son, Butch, is a producer/director and an independent film maker. He is currently wrapping up a comedy which has been two years in the making.\n\nToday, there is little time for rest in retirement for Tommy Bond. He is extremely proud of two projects with which he is actively involved. He is the spokesman for Cabin Fever’s 21 volume video set of fully restored Little Rascals films. He travels around the country promoting them and appearing on various tv programs. And what a great product to endorse...if you haven’t seen them, I urge you to seek them out. For the first time, all of the Little Rascals talkies and a few of the silents have been painstakingly restored and lost scenes put back where they belong. According to Tom, there is a possibility of even more of the silents being released. Let’s hope!\n\nTom is also involved with another huge project which sounds very exciting. He is on the Board of Directors of the upcoming Comedy Hall of Fame. This is a non-profit organization dedicated to the preservation of various comedy media. So far the organization has raised $23 million and is only $2 million away from ground-breaking. The Hall of Fame will be an 80,000 square foot facility in Palmetto, Florida, south of St. Petersburg. It will contain memorabilia and sections devoted to old movies, radio, stand-up, vaudeville, clowns, etc. There will be a gift shop, a restaurant, a wax museum, and a research library. Memorabilia is being donated by W.C. Fields’ grandkids, Eleanor Keaton, among others. Attendance is expected at 7,000 to 10,000 visitors a day. After spending nearly all his life in California, Tommy Bond will be moving down to Florida to take part in this project. This sounds like a lot of fun.\n\nSummary of his filmworks:\n\nTommy Terror's Scary Stories (1999) Atom Man Vs. Superman (1950) Big Town Scandal (1948) Man from Frisco (1944) Static in the Attic (1939) Men in Fright (1938) Gobs of Trouble (1935) Kid Millions (1934) Forgotten Babies (1933) Spanky (1932)\n\nDorothy DeBorba (1925-2010)\n\nAdorable Dorothy DeBorba was with the Gang for three years, beginning her career at age five. Quickly, Dorothy became an audience favorite with her trademark curls and elaborate hair bows. Her mother made those bows and would spend two hours every night brushing and putting Dorothy's hair up in curlers. Of course, her natural energy and mischievousness added to her appeal!\n\nDorothy left show business shortly after her Our Gang career. Today, she lives in Livermore, California and recalls her Rascals days vividly and with fondness.\n\nWhen I spoke to her recently at a Sons of the Desert meeting, she reminisced that \"...the boys (in the series) were given all the best lines.\" Ironic indeed, for anyone who has seen \"Love Business\", where Dorothy delivered some of the funniest lines in the entire series! A real charmer.\n\nSummary of her filmworks:\n\nThe Kid from Borneo (1933) Mush and Milk (1933) Birthday Blues (1932) Hook and Ladder (1932) Spanky (1932) Little Daddy (1931) Bargain Days (1931) The Slippery Pearls (1931) Teacher's Pet (1930) A Royal Romance (1930)\n\nJoe Cobb (1917-2002)\n\nJoe Cobb was born in 1917 in Shawnee, Oklahoma. He appeared in 86 Our Gang episodes during seven years and he had three guest-appearances in the serial in the 30's.\n\nJoe Cobb personified the jolly naive fat person in a perfect way and lend weight to the Our Gang. His film career was a product of pure chance. He and his father were on vacation in Los Angeles. They visited among other things the film studios and finally passed by the Hal Roach studio. At the same afternoon he was taken to the set by the filmcrew and played his first part in \"A Gough Winter\" (22) together with Snub Pollard and James Finlayson. Joe Cobb was so nervous that he was flabbergasted, even speechless. Fortunately the movie wasn't able to speak at this time. The director Charles Parrott - the later Charley Chase - brought him together with Our Gang. All this happened in September 1922.\n\nAfter Joe Cobb left Our Gang he was renewed engaged by the studio in 1936 as Master of Ceremonies for Our Gang. He then sought out minor roles in things like \"Where Did You Get That Girl?\" (41) and \"Tuxedo Junction\" (41), before he was going into defense work as an assembler in 1942.\n\nWith a height of 5 feet he belongs to the smaller actors but his importance in the film history of Our Gang is one of the most important.\n\nSummary of his filmworks:\n\nWhere Did You Get That Girl? (1941) Reunion in Rhythm (1937) Fish Hooky (1933) Boxing Gloves (1929) Noisy Noises (1929) Crazy House (1928) Edison, Marconi & Co.

She already appeared in some movies at the age of six month and she had among others an appearance in the movie \"Seeing the World\" at the age of four. She appeared in 35 Our Gang episodes during three years.\n\nHer name was also a synonym for her person. The blonde blue-eyed beauty was seen on the road by the wife of the Assistant General Manager of the Hal Roach studio. During the 20's she was a darling of the Our Gang fans. In the 30's she went on Vaudeville tour with Our Gang and when she left the gang she also toured Vaudeville in a single act of song, dance and patter.\n\nHer first height after Our Gang she could celebrate as Curly Locks in \"Babes in Toyland\" (34) at Laurel & Hardy's side. In the same year she played the title role in \"Jane Eyre\".\n\nIn 1940 she began to study singing and got a scholarship by the New York Municipal Opera Association. At the same time she became offered a part together with Mickey Rooney in one of his Andy Hardy movies by M-G-M, but spurning both, Hollywood and the opera she turned towards the Broadway where she had her debut in \"Count Me In\" (42). In the following years she appeared in a number of shows on Broadway but the best know was her role as Carrie Pipperidge in the original Broadway production of \"Carousel\" in which she played 850 consecutive performances which is a record for a singer.\n\nDuring the war she had several appearances for soldiers which led to loyal fans and work for radio and TV in the 40's and 50's.\n\nAbout her experiences as a child star she told: \"It is bad enough for an adult reach to the height of your career, and after that to return to the normal performers - as a child it was disastrous. As a child I thought I am a little god. I lived in a fictitious world and the people around me said oooh and aaah, and I believed them. This could have destroyed me, unfortunately it destroyed many others. Sometimes I think, the fact, that I was spared was just plain magic.\n\nIn 1954 she got married with Reuben Bowen who was the former Kajer the Magician. Since 1974 she has lived in Dublin and pursues a career as writer of mystery stories and reading her own stories \"Aunt Poppy\" for the RTE radio and TV, beside it has written plays for radio and has worked as a journalist. She has published over 50 short stories in \"Ellery Queen\", \"Hitchcock\" and different magazines in Ireland.\n\nSummary of her filmworks:\n\nBabes in Toyland (1934) Jane Eyre (1934) Boxing Gloves (1929) Small Talk (1929) School Begins (1928) Crazy House (1928) Spook Spoofing (1928) Chicken Feed (1927) Olympic Games (1927) Ten Years Only (1927) Bring Home the Turkey (1927)\n\nGordon 'Porky' Lee (1933-2005)\n\nPorky was born Eugene Lee in Ft. Worth Texas in 1933. (Later in life he adopted the name \"Gordon\" for himself.) In 1935 he and his family traveled to Hollywood wherein he became a Rascal for the next four years.\n\nUpon leaving Our Gang, the Lees returned to Texas and Gordon eventually became a teacher. Today he lives happily in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\n\n1935 was catering in probably the most popularly remembered group of Little Rascals.\n\nVeteran Spanky was becoming a \"big kid\" and Alfalfa was just being introduced to fans of the Gang, soon to be teamed up with Spanky. Darla had just signed on as the Gang's leading lady, filling a long-standing vacancy. At age two, Eugene \"Porky\" Lee was brought into the troupe. Initially to portray Spanky's kid brother in Little Sinner. Soon, in a true bit of inspiration, Porky was teamed with Buckwheat, creating the best-loved pair of pals in Rascal history. With Butch soon added as the Gang's arch-nemesis, the ensemble was complete.\n\nDirector Gordon Douglas had a superb talent for letting Porky \"do his thing\", and captured some wonderful moments on film. Rarely did Porky appear as though he was acting; often looking around the set and going about his business while others were delivering lines. In fact, it was Porky who unwittingly provided some of the sincerest laughs of this period.\n\nSummary of his filmworks:\n\nTiny Troubles (1939) Football Romeo (1938) Aladdin's Lantern (1938) Mail and Female (1937) Fishy Tales (1937) Glove Taps (1937) General Spanky (1936) Second Childhood (1936) Little Sinner (1935)\n\nEugene \"Pineapple\" Jackson (1916-2001)\n\nEugene \"Pineapple\" Jackson was one of the silent members of the little rascals.\n\nWhen he was six years old he was discovered by Hal Roach and made several \"Our Gang\" comedies. Charismatic and talented, he found work with other studios as well, including Universal's Century Comedies and Mack Sennett Comedies.\n\nHe also appeared in feature films during the silent era, including \"Penrod and Sam\" (1923), with child-star Ben Alexander; \"Thief of Baghdad\" (1924), with Douglas Fairbanks; \"Little Annie Rooney\" (1925), with Mary Pickford; and \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" (1927), with James B. Lowe and Gertrude Howard.\n\nThe talkies didn't stop \"Pineapple\" Jackson. He was a survivor of the transition to sound, and his show-business career lasted for decades. He rubbed elbows\n\nand tapped his toes with the greatest performers of our century, including Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson, Al Jolson, Judy Garland and Gene Kelly. While his\n\nsuccesses could fill scrapbook after scrapbook, he considers his greatest accomplishment to be the inroads he made for Black performers in mainstream\n\nAmerica.\n\nSummary of his filmworks:\n\nBayou Romance (1982) Take My Life (1941) Sporting Blood (1940) Reform School (1939) Guns and Guitars (1936) Tumbling Tumbleweeds (1935) Sporting Blood (1931) Cimarron (1931) Dixiana (1930) Uncle Tom's Cabin (1927) Little Annie Rooney (1925) Thief of Bagdad (1924) Penrod and Sam (1923)\n\nLeonard Kibrick (1924-1993)\n\nSidney Kibrick (1928)\n\nThe actor Sidney Kibrick made his film debut in 1933 with \"The Kid's Last Fight\" alongside the legendary Shirley Temple.

Although she didn't make any full length motion pictures during 1928, Mary Ann more than made up for it the following year when she appeared in six major pictures such as \"Bouncing Babies\" and \"Lazy Days\".

His mother is credited with giving him his memorable nickname of \"Spanky\" which originated from her repeated warnings of what he would get should he venture into trouble.\n\nAt the end of January 1994, \"Spanky\" received a star on Hollywood's Walk of Fame, becoming the only Our Gang member to be awarded this honor.\n\nSummary of his filmworks:\n\nThe Aurora Encounter (1986) Moon Runners (1974) I Escaped from the Gestapo (1943) Benjamin Franklin, Jr. (1943) Wedding Worries (1941) Bubbling Trouble (1940) Alfalfa's Aunt (1939) Men in Fright (1938) Mail and Female (1937) Arbor Day (1936) Mama's Little Pirates (1934) The Kid from Borneo (1933) Birthday Blues (1932) Spanky (1932)\n\nDarwood \"Waldo\" Kaye (1929-2002)\n\nDarwood Kaye was born on Sept. 8, 1929 in Fort Collins, CO.
