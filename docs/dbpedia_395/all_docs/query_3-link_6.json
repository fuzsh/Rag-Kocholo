In the film, Alfalfa (Carl Switzer) decides to quit a pop music revue put on by Spanky (George McFarland) and become an opera singer, famously singing a pastiche song entitled \"The Barber of Seville\" several times throughout the film. The bulk of the film is made up of a dream sequence, in which Alfalfa imagines himself twenty years later failing as an opera singer, while Spanky owns a Broadway nightclub with a lavish floor show.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nThe gang is putting on another big show in Spanky's cellar, complete with an orchestra led by Buckwheat (Billie Thomas), and performances by Darla (Darla Hood) and many of the other neighborhood kids. However, \"King of Crooners\" Alfalfa (Carl Switzer), the star of the show, crashes the swing music based show with his off-key rendition of \"The Barber of Seville\", having secretly decided he is going to sing opera from now on. Spanky closes the curtain on Alfalfa and sends out another act to replace him, causing Alfalfa to walk out and take his voice \"where it'll be appreciated!\"\n\nWith Porky (Eugene Lee) accompanying him, Alfalfa turns up at the Cosmopolitan Opera House, wanting to appear in their next opera. Barnaby (Henry Brandon), the Cosmopolitan's impresario, jokingly offers the young boy a contract â€” provided he come back in twenty years. Elated, Alfalfa returns to Spanky's cellar with Porky, gloating about his presumed good fortune. Spanky tears into him, telling him that \"someday I'll be a big producer on Broadway, and you'll be singing your opera in the streets with a tin cup in your hand!\"\n\nAlfalfa brushes off Spanky's warnings and falls asleep backstage, dreaming that the twenty years have elapsed and the public is awaiting his debut at Barnaby's opera house. However, Alfalfa is quickly booed by the audience and pelted with rotten vegetables. An angry Barnaby, now a wizened old man, throws Alfalfa out into the New York streets and forces him to sing for pennies in the snow. Hungry and broke, Alfalfa and Porky happen upon Club Spanky, an ornate nightclub on Broadway, owned by a now-rich Spanky and headlined by the also rich Darla and \"Cab Buckwheat\".\n\nInviting them in to see the show, Spanky offers to let Alfalfa and Porky work for him again. Porky immediately accepts, but Alfalfa stubbornly refuses. However, after seeing the floor show starring Darla, Buckwheat, Porky, and a few other performers, Alfalfa is won over and changes his mind. Just as he begins to sing, however, Barnaby appears to drag him back out by the arm to sing in the snow. Alfalfa struggles to release himself from Barnaby's grip while the children chant \"We want Alfalfa! We want Alfalfa!\"\n\nAlfalfa then awakens to find himself back in Spanky's cellar with the audience continuing to chant in the background. Spanky begs him to join in the last act, and Alfalfa, needing no further convincing and fed up with opera, tears up his contract and rushes onstage to sing Bing Crosby's \"Learn to Croon\" for the show's finale.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Gang\n\n[edit]\n\nCarl Switzer as Alfalfa\n\nDarla Hood as Darla\n\nEugene Lee as Porky\n\nGeorge McFarland as Spanky\n\nBillie Thomas as Buckwheat\n\nAdditional cast\n\n[edit]\n\nAnnabelle Logan as Girl singing \"The Bonnie Banks o' Loch Lomond\"\n\nGeorgia Jean LaRue as Girl singing\n\nPhilip MacMahon as Boy singing\n\nAda Lynn as Blues singer (scenes deleted)\n\nGloria Brown as Hula girl/Chorus girl/Bowery girl\n\nJana Ekelund as Check room girl\n\nBetsy Gay as Eccentric girl\n\nGloria Hurst as Hula girl/Dancer in nightclub\n\nSylvia Johnson as Porky's girlfriend\n\nDickie Jones as Dickie\n\nHenry Lee as Spike\n\nGloria Mackey as Eccentric girl\n\nPatsy May as Check room girl\n\nTommy McFarland as Tommy\n\nTrina Morris as Eccentric girl\n\nClifford Severn, Jr. as Richard\n\nHarold Switzer as Harold\n\nLaura June Williams as Hula girl\n\nThe Ben Carter Kids as Orchestra members\n\nThe Bud Murray Kids as Dancers\n\nAdults\n\n[edit]\n\nHenry Brandon as \"Barnaby\", opera impresario\n\nGino Corrado as Opera singer\n\nWilma Cox as Miss Jones, Barnaby's secretary\n\nDoodles Weaver as Piano player\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nOften pointed out as one of the best entries in the series,[4] Follies of 1938 was produced as a special one-shot return to the series' original two-reel (twenty-minute) format, after a season and a half of shorter one-reel films. In addition, Follies of 1938, particularly its extended dream sequence, features lavish production design and filmmaking typical of feature length MGM musicals.[5] MGM in fact helped finance the short beyond its usual contributions to the Roach shorts; as a result its opening titles read \"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer presents Our Gang Follies of 1938, A Hal Roach Production,\" as opposed to the usual \"Hal Roach Presents Our Gang in...\"[5] At a cost of $58,000,[2] Follies of 1938 was the most expensive Our Gang short ever produced.[2]\n\nThe short's cast includes over one hundred children, as nearly all of the parts in the film (even the \"adults\" in Alfalfa's dream sequence) are played by kids. The lone exceptions are Henry Brandon's \"Barnaby\" character (not named onscreen, but named as such in the script),[5] and the other three adults seen at the Cosmopolitan Opera House. Brandon's villainous Barnaby character was re-purposed from another Hal Roach production, Laurel and Hardy's 1934 feature Babes in Toyland.[5] One of the featured singers in Spanky's cellar show is Annabelle Logan, a girl who sings a swing rendition of the traditional Scottish song \"The Bonnie Banks o' Loch Lomond\". Logan would grow up to become Annie Ross, a successful jazz singer and actress.[6]\n\nRights\n\n[edit]\n\nOur Gang Follies of 1938 is one of four sound Our Gang shorts that fell into the public domain after the copyright lapsed in the 1960s (the other three being School's Out, Bear Shooters, and Waldo's Last Stand). As such, these films frequently appear on inexpensive video and/or DVD compilations.\n\nSongs\n\n[edit]\n\nSongwriters[1] are listed in italics.\n\n\"Stagecoach Conversation\" (Marvin Hatley) - Buckwheat and His Orchestra (instrumental)\n\n\"Follies Introduction/King Alfalfa\" (Hatley) - Spanky, Darla, and \"Follies\" chorus girls\n\n\"The Barber of Seville\" (Gioacchino Rossini) - Alfalfa\n\n\"Pick a Star\" (R.
