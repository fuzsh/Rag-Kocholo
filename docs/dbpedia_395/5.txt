This Hal Roach comedy short, The Love Bug, is the thirty-seventh in the "Our Gang/Little Rascals" series. In this one, Farina, Joe, and Mickey are in love. All seems perfectly fine with them...until they hear the girls saying stuff they weren't meant to hear. So they all resolve to fix what they think is wrong with them according to what they heard their girlfriends say. Gene is the page at the beauty parlor and he lets them in while his boss is away. The boss had just fired his entire staff so he must have been looking for some new employees! I'll stop there and just say this was quite a hilarious short when taking place in the salon especially when Jackie fools with some controls! That's all I'll mention so on that note, I highly recommend The Love Bug.
