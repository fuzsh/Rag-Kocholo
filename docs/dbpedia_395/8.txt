full name: Harry Eugene Roach

This filmography attempts to include all of the films that Hal Roach worked on, including those not made by his studio. It also attempts to include all of the films made by Hal E. Roach Studios, whether or not Roach himself was involved. The filmography is nearly complete up through the mid 1940s, thanks mostly to Rob Stone, who let me utilize his impressive list, and Richard Lewis Ward, who wrote A History Of The Hal Roach Studios, which includes an extensive filmography. I've also received quite a lot of help from Joe Moore, who has filled in some gaps and provided clarification for some of the information. The list below is the most complete that I've seen so far. It should be noted, however, that the TV era (from the late '40s into the early '60s) is far from complete. For some shows, I've been able to find a list of all the episodes, but not for others. Also, it isn't always clear whether a show was actually made by Roach's company, or simply renting studio space. For the purposes of this filmography, rental situations are not included, other than being briefly mentioned when known.

1913

Roach started as an extra with Universal in early 1913. He frequently appeared in westerns starring J. Warren Kerrigan. It was during this period that he met Harold Lloyd.

Realizing that his acting abilities were limited, Roach began to take various non-acting assignments, and eventually served as assistant director on the Jeanie McPherson series of shorts.

Presumably, Roach didn't limit his options to Universal, and turned up at a number of other studios.

unspecified title (technical advisor/extra role)

1913 - Universal

Roach advised on how the game of roulette was played, so as to make it realistic in the film. He remembered this as his first film.

1914

Roach continued to work as an extra for Universal and other studios, as well as occasional work behind the cameras.

On July 23rd, Roach formed the Rolin Film Company with partner Dan Linthicum (combining their names to form the company name), and a third partner, I. H. Nance. Roach was elected president of the company. They hired Harold Lloyd to play the lead in the one-reel Willie Work series, with Jane Novak as his leading lady and Roy Stewart as the heavy. They also filmed two-reel dramas, with Stewart in the lead and Lloyd and Novak in support.

On August 17th, Nance was replaced by Dwight Whiting.

After several films had been made in the late summer and early fall, Lloyd defected to Keystone over a pay dispute. Roach briefly tried another comedian, but production ceased when funds ran dry, with the company still lacking a distributor.

Roach then began directing comedies for Essanay, featuring such players as Bud Jamison and Snub Pollard.

1915

Roach was directing comedies for Essanay when business partner Dwight Whiting succeeded in getting Pathé Exchange interested in distributing the Rolin product. Pathé distributed only one Willie Work short, "Just Nuts," and wanted Rolin to reunite the three principles, but only Harold Lloyd was available. Pathé was able to pick and choose which films they distributed, with Rolin turning over the rest to Motion Picture Specialties Corporation, which found other distribution for a handful of the remaining films.

During the summer, the company leased facilities owned by Norbig Film Manufacturing Company at 1745-51 Alessandro Street in Edendale.

Lloyd developed the Lonesome Luke character during the course of the year, and was joined in July by Bebe Daniels and Snub Pollard.

Dee Lampton joined the Roach stock company late in the year.

In October, Pathé committed to a long-term contract to distribute the Lonesome Luke series. It should be noted that Pathé released four films in 1915, "Lonesome Luke" (June 7), "Once Every Ten Minutes" (July 12), "Soaking The Clothes" (Aug. 9) and "Pressing His Suit" (Aug. 23) that were not made by Rolin Film Company, even though they've been long attributed to the Lonesome Luke series. IMDb corrects this error, but credits Roach as an 'unconfirmed' director.

1916

In March of this year, Rolin moved production to Pacific Laboratories on Santa Monica Boulevard.

In April, Rolin attempted to hire Arnold Novello, better known as Toto, to star in his own series, but he was unavailable.

In June, Rolin launched rotund side player Dee Lampton into his own series, and gave him the ironic nickname Skinny.

In August, the Lonesome Luke series graduated to 2-reel status.

In November, filming on the Skinny series ended, and Lampton returned to the Rolin stock company.

Late in the year, Rolin rented a vacant lot on Olive Street for their location work.

By the end of the year, Rolin had moved their main operation to the Bradbury mansion at 406 Court Street.

IMDb lists three Jimmy Aubrey comedies plus a film called "Jailed" as Rolin and Phunphilm films. All indications are that Aubrey was in New York throughout 1916 and never did a series for Roach.

In February of this year, Roach went to New York to film the pilot for a new Toto series starring Arnold Novello.

In June, the Lonesome Luke series was discontinued in favor of a new Harold Lloyd series in which he wore the lensless glasses with which most people associate him. While the Luke comedies had been two-reelers, this new series tentatively reverted to the one-reel format.

In October, a dispute between Roach and Lloyd resulted in a short being filmed that featured sidekick Snub Pollard.

1918

Early in the year, the Los Angeles Fire Department ordered film production to cease on the vacant lot on Olive Street.

In March, there was another contract dispute between Roach and Lloyd, resulting in Alf Goulding filling in for Lloyd in his latest short.

On April 4th, Dwight Whiting sold his stock in the company to Roach, leaving the latter without a business partner.

In May, the Toto series was discontinued and Stan Laurel was signed on to star in his own series.

In July, the Stan Laurel series was discontinued after doing poorly.

1919

In April of this year, the Harold Lloyd series expanded to a new two-reel format.

In June, Lloyd leading lady Bebe Daniels left the series and was replaced by Mildred Davis.

On August 24th, the Harold Lloyd series came to an abrupt halt when Lloyd suffered a severe injury to his right hand, losing the thumb and forefinger, while posing for photographs with what he thought was an inactive prop bomb.

On August 26th, a new series of one-reelers called Rolin Comedies was inaugurated, if only to keep the staff employed. These comedies initially starred Snub Pollard, but over the years, they included most of the one-reelers made by the company, regardless of the star. Pollard's sidekick in these initial comedies was child actor Ernie "Sunshine Sammy" Morrison, who had arrived at the studio shortly before the accident.

On September 1st, Ernie Morrison was signed to a long-term contract. Correspondence between Roach and Pathé executive Fred Quimby during this period reveals that Roach wanted to start a series of 'coon' pictures, no doubt starring Morrison. The head of Pathé in the US, Paul Brunet, vetoed this idea on the premise that 'kid' series were generally not successful. Roach had to content himself with featuring Morrison in the Pollard series, which was advertised as though the two were a comedy team.

On September 2nd, tragedy struck again when Dee Lampton, who had previously starred in his own series, died of a ruptured appendix.

In November, construction began on Hal E. Roach Studios in Culver City. The land was provided for free by Harry Culver, who was trying to attract movie studios to his city. One contemporary publication places the beginning of the Roach studio on November 8th, which may or may not have been the first day of construction.

Harold Lloyd returned to work at the end of the year.

1920

The Harold Lloyd unit resumed production in early January of this year.

Later in January, another series of one-reelers was launched, this one starring Beatrice La Plante. This series was incorporated into the Rolin Comedies.

In February, production units began to use the new Culver City studio, which hadn't reached its completion date.

In April, the Beatrice La Plante series ended.

On April 20th, the Roach studio in Culver City was officially completed.

In June, a series of one-reelers called Vanity Fair Maids went into production. It quickly became Vanity Fair Girls, and starred Eddie Boland. This series was considered separate from the Rolin Comedies.

The July 3rd issue of Motion Picture News announced that a "three cornered deal" was struck between Roach, Pathé and Associated Exhibitors, Inc., whereby Harold Lloyd would make more than a million and a half dollars during the first year. This deal took effect after Lloyd's final release of 1920.

Lloyd's meteoric rise in popularity during this year led to a reissuing of the Lonesome Luke comedies.

On August 16th, Rolin Film Company was officially renamed Hal E. Roach Studios. With this name-change, the one-reelers produced by the company were renamed the Hal Roach Comedies.

IMDb includes "Nomads Of The North" among the films Roach produced during this year, but they simultaneously attribute it to another company, so it's doubtful that Roach was involved.

1921

In January of this year, the Vanity Fair Girls were retired, and their series became a solo vehicle called the Eddie Boland Comedies.

In February, Charles Parrott (later known as Charley Chase) joined Roach to direct the Snub Pollard series.

On February 28th, Ernie Morrison's contract was renewed.

In March, Gaylord Lloyd (the brother of Harold), was featured in a handful of the Hal Roach Comedies. These were intially meant to be a revival of the Lonesome Luke comedies, and Lloyd's physical appearance in the films bears this out to some extent.

Early in the year, the Harold Lloyd series began to be funded by Associated Exhibitors.

On April 17th, Roach contracted with the Ruth Roland company to make a serial in conjunction with his company.

In August, the Hal Roach Comedies started to feature Paul Parrott (actually Charles' brother, James), who replaced the departing Eddie Boland. There was also a George Rowe pilot produced for this series the same month.

On September 20th, Roach signed a contract with Pathé for the release of a Sunshine Sammy two-reeler that failed to achieve series status.

Late in the year, the Ruth Roland serial "White Eagle" was produced by her own company in conjunction with Roach.

With the release of the Harold Lloyd mini-feature "A Sailor-Made Man," his unit switched exclusively to feature production.

In December, Charles Parrott (aka Chase) was appointed director-general of the studio. This gave him supervisory status over all of the non-Lloyd films.

Special note: In his book, Richard Ward lists a one-reeler entitled "One-Quarter Inch," which was part of the Lloyd reissue series and released on September 11th. This was either a retitled film, a previously unreleased film, or a mistake in the source material.

1922

In January of this year, the first film starring Hal Roach's Rascals was shot and titled "Our Gang," a name that soon became an alternate title for the series.

The January 14th issue of Motion Picture News reported that Roach was in New York visiting the offices of Pathé, along with Mrs. Roach, Harold Lloyd, Mildred Davis, and Mildred's mother. During this visit, Roach and Pathé signed a new 3-year deal covering all of the Roach product (according to the Feb. 18th issue). They were due to return by February 1st (according to the Jan. 28th issue).

On January 19th, Roach and Pathé signed into a distribution deal for Hal Roach's Rascals.

On January 31st, Harold Lloyd signed a new contract with Pathé.

In March, the Snub Pollard series graduated to 2-reel status, but this turned out to be a bad idea and they soon reverted back to the one-reel format.

A second Ruth Roland serial, entitled "The Timber Queen," was produced this year.

The April 2nd issue of Motion Picture News announced that Roach had given up producing serials and would concentrate solely on comedies going forward.

Towards the end of the year, Jobyna Ralston replaced Mildred Davis as Harold Lloyd's leading lady.

It appears that Charles Parrott (aka Chase) resigned as director-general in December to concentrate on acting.

The Will Rogers films "The Ropin' Fool" and "Fruits Of Faith" are listed in IMDb as Roach films, but were almost certainly produced elsewhere.
