        "text": "Woody Allen has won the Oscar for best original screenplay at the Academy Award ceremony currently taking place at the Kodak Theatre in Hollywood. His film Midnight in Paris is the most commercially successful of his entire career, but he still faced a struggle to defeat the favourite, The Artist writer Michel Hazanavicius.\n\nAllen also came out on top ahead of a strong field including Bridesmaids' Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo, JC Chandor (Margin Call) and Asghar Farhadi, writer of Iranian divorce drama A Separation. This is the 15th time Allen has nominated for best original screenplay, winning just twice, for Hannah and Her Sisters in 1987 and Annie Hall in 1977.\n\nMidnight in Paris sees Owen Wilson play an American novelist on holiday in the French capital who finds himself magically transported to his favourite era: the jazz age Paris of expats such as F Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway."
