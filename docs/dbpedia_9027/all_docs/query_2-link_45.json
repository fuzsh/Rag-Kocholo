        "text": "I’ve had the chance to check your music out and I fell in love with it almost right away. Unfortunately, not all FemMetal readers have had the chance to enjoy your masterpieces. So what would you tell them to expect if they go check out your music right now?I’m very happy to hear you liked our music! I think Numento’s music is a unique combination of various subgenres of metal so it’s a bit hard to compare it to any other band but the essence of our music is certainly in contrast between beautiful, ethereal and brutal, sinister. We don’t want to stick to one genre at all, because that would limit the means of expression too much. We put the story and atmosphere first. So from one song, you can expect almost anything from jazz to black metal, but maybe the core of our music lies somewhere in progressive death metal. I use a variety of vocal techniques from operatic to death growls to reflect the contrasts in our music.I mostly get inspiration for lyrics from movies and series I watch, mostly fictional. I also find old fairy tales very fascinating, and they can be very creepy as well. For many Numento songs, I have written my own version of such fairy tales, of Snow Queen or Sleeping Beauty, for example. The theme of Numento’s second album is also psychological: I have thought a lot about how a human being is capable of doing evil, how does one become a serial killer, for example. The album is a collection of many viewpoints to this question, both fictional and emotional, but I’d say most of the lyrics are based on fiction or on real, historical characters.I regret to admit this but yes, a lot. The older I get, the more I become aware of it so it’s easier to notice it. In my personal life, I work as a scientist in speech technology and the attitudes of some people I have worked with have not been very encouraging but it kind of gives me the motivation to develop my skills to become even more confident and determined. In music, I have heard hilarious comments about my vocal techniques, but since female growlers are slowly becoming more and more common, I can feel it slowly becoming more standard but there is still a lot of work on this in the field. But I cannot say I haven’t faced any haters, unfortunately. I think that if some men feel threatened about my singing and feel entitled to belittle me, they should turn to themselves and think about the reason behind the attitude and, perhaps, fear. So my advice is: f*ck haters, be strong and practice, don’t give up!"
