        "text": "Woody Allen racked up his sixth Writers Guild Award and third Original Screenplay Oscar—more than anyone in history—in an entirely Woody Allen way; with a story that would be many screenwriters’ fantasy. Gil Pender is a disillusioned scripter who, while on a visit to Paris, gets spirited back to the 1920s to hobnob with the likes of Cole Porter, Ernest Hemingway, and Gertrude Stein. Nice work if you can get it. To top it off, Allen told The Hollywood Reporter that he didn’t have to do any research for the film: “Characters like Hemingway, Picasso, Salvador Dalí—they are so vivid and have such pronounced styles, I didn’t have to do any research at all. I could write it off the top of my head.”"
