        "text": "I know I’m a little late to the party, since this movie came out over a year ago, but I finally managed to catch up with it. What a great little movie. Owen Wilson plays a writer who finds his inspiration in Paris as he appears to travel back to the 1920’s every night and meet his favourite authors and artists. Its an incredibly fun premise which Woody Allen and company explore to its fullest.\n\nOwen Wilson plays a likable guy living a constrained life, and he pulls it off quite well. All around him are great performances of people like Corey Stoll as Hemmingway, Allison Pill and Tom Hiddleston as the Fitzgeralds, Michael Sheen as his fiance’s obnoxious friend, and Marion Cotillard as the mysterious Adriana. Watching him interact with these characters is wonderfully enjoyable.\n\nThe message of the movie is pretty heavy-handed, but the charm of the movie is more than enough to make up for that fact. And lets face it, the message is a good one; we must live the fullest life we can in the time period we live in. Even to those in Gil’s golden age believe some earlier time was the true golden age. I quite like this theme and liked how it was explored. This was a fun and very likable movie.\n\n9/10"
