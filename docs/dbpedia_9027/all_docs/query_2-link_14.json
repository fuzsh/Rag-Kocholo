        "text": "The star-studded romantic comedy Midnight in Paris is one of Woody Allen’s most recent films which he did both, wrote and directed. It is a film about a man named Gil (Owen Wilson) who travels to Paris with his fiancée’s parents in order to expand his imagination and he ends up embarking on a journey to the 1920s while walking the streets of Paris at night. Not only is this film engaging and witty, but it also manages to provide both, overt and covert examples of postmodernism in film. By analyzing Woody Allen’s 2011film Midnight in Paris, we can identify the presence of many underlying motifs in both the narrative and the characterization of the film when using some of Frederic Jameson and Jean Baudrillard’s concepts on postmodernism.\n\nOne of the main concepts that postmodernism relies on is bricolage, which is reflected in Midnight in Paris through the usage and mixtures of the different styles and genres. It is not exactly simple to pinpoint or even categorize the type of film Midnight in Paris is, the assemblages of genres include romance, comedy, fantasy, adventure, history, and time travel. There is certainly a blurred line to which genre dominates this film because all these genres are seamlessly blended in together making it difficult to distinguish where each decides to be featured. Allen managed to extenuate the use of long and still shots in order to highlight the city of Paris towards the beginning of the film as his opening shots, a technique that is not used very often in mainstream Hollywood films. He then brings the city to life at midnight; where his cinematography is soften for the shots which were intended to take place in the golden age. The other modern day shots are very vivid and sharp compared to those of t...\n\n... middle of paper ...\n\n...ts how it is meaningless to yearn for the past, something that can no longer exist and be retrieved. By presenting spectators with all these postmodern elements in Midnight in Paris, he not only shows us what is wrong with our society, but also how we can move forward instead of looking backwards.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nBruno, Giuliana. “Ramble City: Postmodernism and Blade Runner.” In Alien Zone, ed.
