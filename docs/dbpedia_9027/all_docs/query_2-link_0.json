        "text": "Story\n\nMidnight in Paris is a visually beautiful movie that tells the story of Gil (Owen Wilson) and Inez (Rachel McAdams), an American couple who travel to Paris with her parents. Gil is a successful Hollywood screenwriter. He’s also keen to find a more meaningful expression for his literary talents and has begun writing his first novel. He’s wildly in love with Paris and jumps at the chance to go with Inez and her parents on an unplanned trip. But Inez is less enthusiastic about Paris. When she bumps into some old friends, she seizes the opportunity to spend time with them.\n\nWhile Inez parties and visits tourist attractions with her American friends, Gil walks the streets alone, soaking in the sounds, sights and feelings, and finding inspiration for his novel. One evening, Gil stumbles into a piece of Paris’s history and meets some of his literary idols from the 1920s. His magical experiences help bring clarity and direction for his life, both personally and professionally. They also force him and Inez to face the truth about their relationship.\n\nThemes\n\nRelationship breakdown; infidelity\n\nViolence\n\nThere is some mild violence in this movie. For example:\n\nErnest Hemingway drinks a lot of alcohol. Then he stands up at a party and asks, ‘Who wants to fight?’\n\nDuring one scene, a character gets drunk. Thinking that her husband no longer loves her, she threatens to drown herself.\n\nSexual references\n\nThis movie has some sexual references. For example:\n\nOne of the characters talks about Adriana being in love with Gil. She also talks about Adriana’s past sexual encounters with other men.\n\nInez admits she has been unfaithful and spent several nights with another man.\n\nAlcohol, drugs and other substances\n\nThis movie shows quite a lot of substance use. For example:\n\nMany characters throughout the movie often drink too much. Characters drink wine at almost all meals and occasions.\n\nThe scenes of 1920s Paris show many of the main characters drinking a lot and acting strangely as a result.\n\nMany characters smoke throughout this movie.\n\nNudity and sexual activity\n\nThis movie has some sexual activity. For example, Gil and Inez kiss on their hotel bed. Also, Gil and Adriana kiss.\n\nProduct placement\n\nThe following products are displayed or used in this movie: Moet champagne and Dior fashion.\n\nCoarse language\n\nThere is some coarse language in this movie.\n\nIdeas to discuss with your children\n\nMidnight in Paris, directed by Woody Allen, is a whimsical romantic comedy likely to be enjoyed by adults. It lacks interest for children, who won’t recognise the historical characters. It also contains some sexual references and frequent drinking and smoking.\n\nThe main messages from this movie are about being true to yourself, and not sacrificing the things that make you happy just to please other people.\n\nThis movie could give you the chance to talk with your children about real-life issues such as trust and honesty. In particular, you could talk about how important these are in relationships. Do Gil and Inez trust each other? How would honesty have helped their relationship?"
