        "text": "It’s become tradition here at GWS to share fun wedding ideas from movies the week before the Oscars which I totally love since movies + weddings are two of my favorite things! I love how it shows that inspiration can really come from anything – including the movies you and your sweetie love to watch! :) So, in honor of the Academy Awards this Sunday, we have lots of fun wedding inspiration to share each afternoon this week based off the 2012 Oscar nominated films – as well as some fun ideas from films nominated in the past…\n\nphoto credits going clockwise: Midnight in Paris, 1920’s vintage wedding ring, book to hold the rings, Midnight in Paris, Twigs & Honey flapper hairpiece, Art deco designed book cover, Atelier Versace\n\nToday it’s all about one of my favorite movies from last year – Midnight in Paris! I know I’ve shared my love of this film with you lovelies already as it was a big influence in our recent trip to Paris. :) A large part of the movie takes place in Paris in the 1920’s and there aren’t many more fashionable eras of history to pull inspiration from in my mind. With fashionable vintage dresses, art deco inspired details and beautiful handcrafted hairpieces you just can’t go wrong. With nods to the movie, I incorporated a vintage book to hold the rings from Gil’s loves of old books – and he was writing his novel throughout the movie. I imagine music from Cole Porter would be heard throughout the reception which would begin at midnight of course! So many fabulous ideas to pull wedding ideas from, right?!\n\nAre there any movies you’d love to see me create an inspiration board for? It can be a new movie or an older movie. I’d love to hear your requests in the comments and I’ll pick my favorite request and turn it into an inspiration board to share on GWS next month!\n\nFor your reference, here are some of my past movie wedding inspiration boards:"
