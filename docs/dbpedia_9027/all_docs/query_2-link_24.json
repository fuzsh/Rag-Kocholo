        "text": "I like your use of landscape as it relates to both time and color in this post. While watching \"Midnight in Paris\" the first time around, I had not noticed those dramatic changes of color between the time periods, but once you pointed it out, it's hard to ignore. When we think back to movies that are trying to evoke nostalgia of the past, this almost sepia tone film stock is used. Yet, Allen chooses to use this tone in the present day. The blander sepia tone causes the setting (or landscape) to feel distant and it removes the viewer a bit from the action of this time period. This was an interesting choice for the present day because it is where Gil also feels distant. When the film gets into those richer colors that you mention in the scenes that take place in the past, the color quality takes on traits that are more similar to film's conventional use of color in the present. The skin tones seem saturated and natural unlike that orange color you refer to that is in the present day scenes. You do a good job here of connecting these colors to Gil's state of mind at the time, and I agree with you that the different color tones help to establish a clear separation between the present and the past and Gil's feelings towards each. This film does a good job to set up films in the future to use a somewhat subtle color correction to establish differences in emotions. What I mean by this, is there are plenty of films, like \"Amelie\", which use obvious color correction to clearly change the tone of the film, however, \"Midnight in Paris\" does this in a more understated way."
