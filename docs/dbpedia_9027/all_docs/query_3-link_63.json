        "text": "Take a trip into the art world as you sit under the stars in beautiful Balboa Park. Grab a picnic, a blanket, and a few friends and enjoy a selection of films whose themes take inspiration from the Museum’s permanent collection, celebrating the recent completion of a large-scale reinstallation of these galleries. Films begin at sundown (approximately 8:00 p.m.) at the Botanical Lawn (east of the Museum.)\n\nThis charming and whimsical romantic comedy from Woody Allen centers on a struggling writer who mysteriously travels to 1920s Paris every night, ﬁnding romance and inspiration as he mingles with his modernist idols. Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dalí are among the artists that make appearances as the ﬁlm explores the inter-connectivity of the creative community as a whole in Paris during this time.\n\nPanama 66’s Grab-n-Go will be open until 8:00 p.m.\n\n1 hour 34 minutes. PG-13."
