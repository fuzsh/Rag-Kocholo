        "text": "An Overview\n\nWhen Salvador Dalí & Luis Buñuel’s film Un chien Andalou premiered in the City of Light, Paris was an avant-garde hothouse rife with artistic conflict and friendly rivalry. Midnight in Paris: Surrealism at the Crossroads, 1929 examines this particularly rich and vital creative era by examining the works, friendships and clashes of Jean Arp, André Breton, Luis Buñuel, Alexander Calder, Giorgio de Chirico, Salvador Dalí, Max Ernst, Alberto Giacometti, René Magritte, Joan Miró, Francis Picabia, Man Ray, Yves Tanguy and others. Through a host of 20th-century works from the renowned Centre Pompidou in Paris, Midnight in Paris, 1929 brings to life the personal relationships and the intellectual passions that threatened to tear apart the newly formed artistic movement called Surrealism.\n\nSetting the Stage: Surrealism a Century Ago\n\nSurrealism was born from the minds of André Breton, Philippe Soupault, and Louis Aragon in Paris in 1924. The three poets would soon be joined by other writers, artists, and filmmakers who similarly sought to liberate themselves from rational control, and wished to put imagination at the basis of their work. In this creative pursuit, they experimented with psychological theories about automatism, dreams, the unconscious, and psychoanalysis. In the history books, the year 1929 is most often associated with the financial crisis that erupted on Wall Street and rippled through the world’s economies. For surrealism too, 1929 was marked as much by crisis as by innovation.\n\nAudio narration by Eugenie Bondurant.\n\nPhotography\n\nSurrealism had been initially preoccupied by the mind (“the functioning of thought”) in the mid-1920s, but by 1929 it turned towards the real and the relation of the mind to the real world. Photography offered a model by which to capture this “real” through a spontaneous mechanism, providing a mysterious access to the external world, one perhaps not obvious to the rational mind and eye. Photography was used to complement surrealist narrative and other texts, so as to associate thought and images. It was a way of engaging with the mysterious and little-known scenes of urban night life. In this way it performed a role similar to collage. Where fragments of the real become a means to summoning an imaginary image.\n\nDalí\n\nIn the spring of 1929, Salvador Dalí entered the scene of the Parisian avant-garde, accompanied by Luis Buñuel, a fellow Spaniard with whom he had recently created Un chien andalou. Dalí called their film “a dagger in the heart of the spiritual and elegant Paris.” The film was written following the surrealist technique of automatic writing. It caught the attention of the surrealists upon its release in June 1929, who praised the dreamlike character of its images and the poetic and psychoanalytic references. The film opened the door for Dalí to join surrealism and share with the movement his theory of “paranoiac critical method,” which consisted of juxtaposing unusual images to create “associations and delusional interpretations.” The Catalan artist opened his first Parisian exhibition on 20 November 1929 at Galerie Goemans. André Breton wrote the preface to the exhibition catalogue, which affirms the central role Dalí held in surrealism at this time. Dalí’s influence is particularly noticeable in the works of Yves Tanguy. Having joined the surrealist group in 1925, Tanguy’s previous preoccupation with automatism gave way to paintings depicting more dreamlike worlds, vast landscapes inhabited by biomorphic forms.\n\nMasson\n\nAndré Masson had shared studio with Miró in the Rue Blomet at the beginning of the 1920s and was a major contributor to the development of automatic drawing and painting, sometimes verging on the abstract, but, as with Miró, Masson sought to invest painting with a visceral concern with life and death. Thus he brought the figure back into his dynamic compositions, as in his 1930 canvas Animaux Endormis (Sleeping Animals). An admirer of the pre-socratic philosopher Heraclitus, Masson saw life and painting as a rapidly flowing continuum. In his own words, “It was quite obvious that I found myself, with my quest for dynamism and the unstable, in a risky position.” This was also the intoxicated delirium of Dionysus as explained by Nietzsche in The Birth of Tragedy. Masson’s slightly later sculpture Extase (Ecstasy) represents a figure born of such dynamic and irrational processes. And yet its composition allows for a sense of the poetic transparency that Nietzsche associated with Apollo’s rationality.\n\nFilm\n\nBuilding on the foundation of photography, the surrealists were among the first to see the power of the new cinematic medium. While they incorporated some experimental devices in their films, these filmmakers also drew on popular devices from commercial cinema (for example melodrama), and for this reason their works were all the more shocking, their screenings often provoking scandal. While the key practitioners of surrealist film were Man Ray, Luis Buñuel and Dalí, similar concerns were explored by the former Dadaist Hans Richter and the militant feminist Germaine Dulac, with Dulac completing The Seashell and the Clergyman, based on a a text by Antonin Artaud, a year before Buñuel and Dalí’s scandalous, but popular Un chien andalou. Though not a surrealist, Dulac’s film was as shocking as those produced by the members of the group.\n\nMagritte and Variétés\n\nThe year 1929 saw the rapprochement of the French and Belgian surrealist groups. Variétés –revue mensuelle illustrée de l’esprit contemporain (the monthly illustrated magazine with a contemporary spirit), was founded in Brussels in May 1928 by Paul-Gustave Van Hecke. Urged on by his friend, E. L. T. Mesens, a Belgian artist, poet, and the founder of surrealism in Belgium, Van Hecke agreed to open the pages of his review to a special issue on surrealism. Published in June 1929, the special edition was distinguished by a red banner across the cover instead of the usual blue one. The review combines texts and illustrations by both French and Belgian surrealists. While the majority of contributions came from the French group, one Belgian painter received special attention: René Magritte. In 1927, Magritte and his wife, Georgette, had moved to Le Perreux-sur-Marne in the Paris suburbs in the hope of getting closer to André Breton. Magritte’s interest in philosophy, especially Hegel’s dialectic of bringing together two contradictory propositions, led him to move away from automatism, instead seeking poetic associations between objects. In 1929 Magritte wrote an article in La Révoution surréaliste in which he theorized his interest in the relationship between words and images. However, later that same year, Magritte and André Breton fell out over a dinner party dispute, when a small crucifix necklace worn by Georgette had enraged Breton’s anti-clericalist views.\n\nDocuments\n\nThe first issue of the journal Documents was published in the spring of 1929. Led by Georges Bataille, the magazine was a crucible of surrealist dissent. In fact, Documents welcomed those who refused to support the movement’s shift in priorities towards political allegiance to the French Communist Party. Founded with museologist Georges Henri Rivière and writer, art critic Carl Einstein, the magazine ran for almost two years. Breton’s surrealism, with its taste for automatism, the unconscious, and the marvelous, was confronted with a new critical approach, based on photography. It was less attractive, aesthetically more brutal and arguably more rooted in reality, thanks to photographic illustrations by Jacques-André Boiffard, Eli Lotar, and Jean Painlevé. André Masson, who shared Bataille’s inclination for Neitzsche and Sade, was also close to the dissident group. In the Second Manifesto of Surrealism, published in the December 1929 edition of La Révolution surréaliste, Breton directed a venomous tirade at Bataille and his associates. The rebels retaliated by reappropriating the concept of a pamphlet written by the original surrealist group in 1924 that celebrated the death of Anatole France. Those attacked in the Second Manifesto (Antonin Artaud, Georges Limbour, Philippe Soupault, Roger Vitrac), joined forces with some dissidents (Raymond Queneau, Jacques Prévert) to publish Un Cadavre, in which they denounced Breton as a “false brother and false communist, false revolutionary but a true show-off.” In spite of these rifts, surrealism arose victorious in 1929. The movement’s restored vitality became evident when, at the beginning of 1930, Francis Ponge, Tristan Tzara, and Paul Nougé supported the first edition of a new surrealist journal entitled Le Surréalisme au service de la Révolution.\n\nSurrealist Objects and Desire\n\nAmong the many words one could use to describe the year 1929, the term “Sadean” seems most appropriate, since the writings of the Marquis de Sade imbue many surrealist works of the period. The spring saw the publication of a singular small volume of erotic poems by Louis Aragon and Benjamin Péret, simply titled 1929, illustrated with sexually explicit photographs by Man Ray. This clandestine publication was produced to finance the special surrealist edition of Variétés, also published in 1929. Objet désagréable (Disagreeable Object), one of Giacometti’s early “surrealist” works, shows the artist’s interest in Eros and Thanatos. Such works were considered the first examples of surrealist “objects,” an anti-sculptural concept, whereby assemblages of objects sought to provoke the viewer’s desire. The same conflicting concern with life and death inspired André Masson’s bold drawings of erotic scenarios planned for an unrealized publication of Sade’s novel, Justine.\n\nChallenge to Painting\n\nThe German artist, Max Ernst, was a founding member of the Dada group. In 1921, at an exhibition of his collages at the Parisian gallery “Au sans pareil”, Ernst met the poet Paul Éluard. This led to his friendship with those who would go on to form the surrealist group. In the years that followed, Ernst’s work developed around themes such as ghostly apparitions, transfigured cities and forests, animals and birds, shells, and landscapes made of crystals. His technique also expanded to include collage, grattage (scratches) and frottage (rubbings), each of which came to have an enduring place in the surrealist visual vocabulary. In December 1929, Ernst published his first collage novel, La Femme 100 têtes (The Hundred Headless Woman), made up of 147 plates reproducing collages of nineteenth-century engravings. If cubist papiers collés were compositional tools, and if irreverent Dadaist collages were an attack on art itself, the most remarkable endeavour of Ernst’s surrealist collages was to pose a “challenge to painting,” the title of an important March 1930 essay by Louis Aragon devoted to the technique of collage. These experiments are similar to those of the Catalan artist Joan Miró, who settled in Paris in the mid-1920s. Miró imagined a dreamlike and poetic world that was far from the surrealist interest in automatism. Nevertheless, André Breton called Miró “the most beautiful feather in the surrealist cap.” Aragon’s “challenge” was echoed by Miró’s own statement calling for “the assassination of painting.” In this way, Miró developed a form of “anti-painting.”\n\nPlayList\n\nTo capture the spirit of Paris in 1929, we selected musical pieces to set the mood of the cafes and nightclubs of late 1920s Paris.\n\nCole Porter: Let’s Do It.

Through these quotes, some of the aspirations and arguments behind the work come to life.\n\n“The idea of Surrealism aims quite simply at the total recovery of our psychic force by a means which is nothing other than the dizzying descent into ourselves. ” Breton\n\n“My paintings are the opposite of dreams.” Magritte\n\n“A whole world is contained in the drop of water which trembles on the edge of a leaf; but it is there only when an artist and a poet have the gift of seeing it in its immediacy.” Masson\n\n“The element of surprise in the creation of a work of art is the most important factor.” Tanguy\n\n“My wanderings, my unrest, my impatience, my doubts, my beliefs, my hallucinations, my loves, my outbursts of anger, my revolts, my contradictions, my refusals to submit to any discipline. My work is like my conduct.” Ernst\n\n“For we Surrealists, we are not quite artists, nor are we exactly true men of science, we are the caviar, and caviar, believe me, is the very extravagance and intelligence of taste. Dalí\n\n“The only thing that’s clear to me is that I intend to destroy, destroy everything that exists in painting. I have an utter contempt for painting. The only thing that matters to me is the spirit itself.” –Miró\n\n“I had surrendered all my activity and hope to surrealism.” Buñuel\n\n“The great adventure is to see something unknown emerge each day, in the same face that is greater than all the trips around the world.” Giacometti\n\n“How does art come into being? Out of volumes, motion, spaces carved out within the surrounding space, the universe.” Calder\n\nOrganized by the Centre Pompidou, Paris, and The Dalí Museum, Midnight in Paris, 1929, and was curated by Dr. William Jeffett, Chief Curator of Special Exhibitions at The Dalí Museum, and Didier Ottinger, Deputy Director of the Musée national d’art moderne at the Centre Pompidou. The Dalí Museum’s unique installation was adapted from a selection of works organized by Dr. Ottinger and previously exhibited at the Palazzo Blu in Pisa and the Hungarian National Gallery in Budapest."
