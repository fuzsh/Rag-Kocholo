Griffiths\n\nWritten By: Christopher Dodd\n\nDirected By: Michael Greenspan\n\nGenre: Adventure/Drama/Mystery\n\nRunning Time: 1 hour, 31 minutes\n\nRelease Date: October 15, 2010 (Abu Dhabi Film Festival); April, 2011 (U.S.A)\n\nMPAA Rating: R\n\nSummary\n\nA man awakens in the passenger seat of a wrecked car in the middle of nowhere. He has no idea who he is, or how he got there. While piecing together sparse clues and memory flashes, he has to try and sort out fact from fantasy and fear.\n\nOh, and did I mention he’s badly injured, and trying to survive in the elements?\n\nAdrien’s Role: “Man”\n\nThis man is the only living character on screen for about 90% of this film. So, to say a lot depended on Brody’s performance is an understatement.\n\nHe fully holds your attention. Even in a movie like this, where the progress is subtle and slow, he keeps it from being boring. With a lesser actor, it may have been.\n\nIn Closing\n\nAs with The Experiment, Wrecked is hard to watch at times. Adrien’s character goes through so much physical and mental suffering, and there’s nothing else going on to distract the viewer. Your focus is always on this man and his misery. He sells the pain so well with his physicality and expressions, it will bring a tear to your eye.\n\nScore\n\nMovie in General: 6/10\n\nBrody Performance: 8/10\n\nTrailer\n\nCast: Adrien Brody, Forest Whitaker, Cam Gigandet, Clifton Collins Jr., Ethan Cohn, Fisher Stevens, Travis Fimmel, Lavell “David Banner” Crump, Jason Lew, Damien Leake, and Maggie Grace\n\nWritten By: Paul T. Scheuring (screenplay), Mario Giordano (novel)\n\nDirected By: Paul T. Scheuring\n\nGenre: Drama/Thriller\n\nRunning Time: 1 hour, 36 minutes\n\nRelease Date: July 15, 2010 (South Korea), September 21, 2010 (U.S.)\n\nMPAA Rating: R\n\nSummary\n\nA group of men, all in need of money for various reasons, sign up for a psychological experiment that pays $14,000 (if they make it the entire two weeks). Half of them are assigned the role of prisoners, the other half, guards. They are given a few rules, and then essentially abandoned by the people running the experiment.\n\nPower changes people. That’s about all I can tell you about the plot without spoiling too much.\n\nAdrien’s Role: Travis Lee\n\nTravis is laid off from his job at an elder care facility. He has also started a relationship with a woman named Bay (Maggie Grace), who invites him on a trip to India. He spots the experiment in a newspaper, and it seems like the answer to his money woes.\n\nTravis is assigned the role of prisoner during the experiment, and is soon fighting for the rights of the detainees. He endures a lot of backlash, to say the least.\n\nSadly, this is the type of movie where almost anything I say will give away plot points. What I’ll say is, Travis basically goes through Hell.\n\nIn Closing\n\nI’ll level with you: this movie is hard to watch. Seeing the mistreatment, and the gross conditions, is enough to turn your stomach.\n\nHowever, the performances are good (especially those of Brody and Whitaker), and the story is compelling.\n\nIf you can handle it, give it a watch.\n\nScores\n\nMovie in General: 6/10\n\nBrody Performance: 8/10\n\nTrailer\n\nCast: Adrien Brody, Alice Braga, Topher Grace, Mahershala Ali, Walton Goggins, Oleg Taktarov, Louis Ozowa, Laurence Fishburne, Danny Trejo\n\nWritten By: Alex Litvak, and Michael Finch. Based on characters by Jim Thomas, and John Thomas.\n\nDirected By: Nimród Antal\n\nGenre: Sci-Fi/Action\n\nRunning Time: 1 hour, 47 minutes\n\nRelease Date: July 7, 2010\n\nMPAA Rating: R\n\nI Sort of Did This One\n\nIn July of 2020, I covered the 10th anniversary of Predators for MovieBabble. I started by live tweeting while rewatching the film. Then, I wrote a ridiculously detailed deep dive type article you can read here, if you’d like. It was a really fun process. ** FAIR WARNING: Either of those links will lead to spoilers. I literally discussed every detail.\n\nIf you haven’t seen the movie yet, I’d suggest staying right here and continuing the one you’re reading. This one I’m typing right now. Hi there. Good to see you.\n\nWith all the writing I’ve done on this movie already, it’s kind of strange it has taken me so long to do this post. Yet, here we are.\n\nSummary\n\nA bunch of unconscious, not-so-nice characters, are dropped from airplanes into an unfamiliar jungle environment.\n\nHow did they get here? Why are they here? And where are they? They must band together to answer these questions, and more that come up along the way. That’s easier said than done, though, as it seems many of them would rather fight each other.\n\nContinue reading “Predators”\n\nCast: Matt Bush, Sean Marquette, Adrien Brody, Colin Hanks, Michael Chiklis, Adhir Kalyan, Luis Chavez, Max Van Ville, Mykelti Williamson, Andrew Wilson, Yeardley Smith, Erica Vittina Phillips, Curtis Armstrong…\n\nWritten by: Erik Linthorst, John Stalberg Jr., Stephen Susco\n\nDirected by: John Stalberg Jr.\n\nGenre: Comedy\n\nRunning Time: 1 hour, 39 minutes\n\nReleased: January 24, 2010 (Sundance), wide release in June\n\nMPAA Rating: R\n\nSidenote:\n\nToday being April 20, aka “4/20,” it seemed like the perfect day to rewatch, and write about, a stoner comedy. It just so happened to be the next movie up chronologically, as well, so… here we are.\n\nSummary\n\nHenry Burke (Bush) is a prodigy of sorts, with a 4.0+ grade point average, and a full ride MTI scholarship waiting in the wings. He is also quite serious. Travis Breaux (Marquette), on the other hand, a childhood friend of Henry’s, is a hero among his fellow “stoners,” and doesn’t take anything seriously.\n\nSo, Henry smokes his first joint (with Travis in their childhood treehouse), at the worst possible time. The day before campus-wide drug testing is announced. Henry panics, because if he fails the drug test, he will be expelled, his scholarship will fall through, and basically his entire future is blown.\n\nTravis comes up with a plan to make sure everyone fails the drug test. They’ll steal kief (essentially concentrated THC) from a local infamous dealer (Brody), mix it into brownie mix, and dose everyone. If everyone tests positive, no one will be singled out (and the results would likely be questioned). Oh, it also happens to be the day of the annual school bake sale. Convenient, right?\n\nSo, that’s basically the plot. It sounds like it would be a bad movie, I know, but it’s actually pretty decent, mostly due to the great performances.\n\nAdrien’s Role: Edward “Psycho Ed” Highbaugh, Esq.\n\nA quick backstory on Ed tells us he graduated high school at age 15, and became a lawyer “before he could drink.” Then, he went on a trip to Mexico, smoked pot laced with PCP, and damaged some part of his brain. He came back home, revolutionized cannabis growing with his smarts, and became a local legend.\n\nThis is easily one of Adrien Brody’s best performances. Yes, I am completely serious. “Psycho Ed” is a perfect blend of genius, mad man, villain, and hero, and he brings the quality of the movie up several notches. I realize I’m biased, since he’s my favorite actor and all, but Ed really is the best part of this movie.\n\nYes, he’s doing somewhat shady stuff. Yes, he’s considered ‘crazy.’ Yes, he looks like the love child of Hugh Jackman and Snoop Dogg (actually, put that one in the plus column). But darn it, there’s an intelligence and depth to him, too…. His approach to growing, security and the like are all very innovative. This is a brilliant man.\n\nMe, from something I wrote some years back\n\nIn Closing\n\nThere is a lot of good acting going on in High School, which I think is somewhat unique for the “stoner comedy” subgenre. Brody, as I mentioned, is brilliant, but he’s not the only one.\n\nThe leads are both excellent. Colin Hanks is fantastic in a “straight man” role, but he does get his turn at being hilarious, as well. Yeardley Smith has a small, but definitely memorable, role. Mykelti Williamson (of Forrest Gump fame) and Andrew Wilson (brother of Owen and Luke) are both solid as friends (and roommates?) of Psycho Ed’s.\n\nMichael Chiklis is almost unrecognizable as the school principal, and his performance is genius. He and his band do a song during the end credits that’s impressive, as well. Sort of a 1970s-styled rock song called “Get Me High.” Because, of course.\n\nIf you’re someone who wants to see a variety of Brody’s performances, you don’t want to miss High School. It’s a side of him not seen in any other film.\n\nScores\n\nMovie Overall: 6/10\n\nBrody Performance: 9/10\n\nTrailer"
