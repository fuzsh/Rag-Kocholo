        "meta_description": "Behold: a dance whose roots begin in 19th-century South America, recognized as an intoxicating blend of European and African cultures, which developed significantly in working-class neighbourhoods. Its social context is intrinsic to its origins, its rise largely accredited to the mass migration of Europeans to South American, in tandem with the poverty and marginalisation of these newcomers. Characterised by a slow, sensual rhythm and dramatic pauses, this dance can likely be enjoyed with the accompaniment of violin, bandoneon, and guitar. Self-expression and fluid movement dominate this performance art… we are, of course, talking about the art of tango! This dance, of Argentinian origin, is presented to you on the stage of the Théâtre du Rond-Point in a glowing show entitled Tango y tango – an exquisite marriage of theatre and choreography. Marcial Di Fonzo Bo directs, Santiago Amigorena writes, Philippe Cohen Solal composes, and Matias Tripodi choreographs to bring you a “score for two actors, an actress, four dancing duos, a singer, and a bandoneon”. A spectacularly unique dance show awaits you, and you won’t have to fly to Argentina to see it…!",
