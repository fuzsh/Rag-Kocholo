        "text": "Valium\n\nWhen Gil meets Adriana for the second time, he starts to connect more with her. We see them walking around in Paris, all the while Gil discusses his love for the city. However, during their walk we see Zelda Fitzgerald trying to jump into the water. To stop her Gil gives her a pill of Valium, to which both Adriana and Zelda admit they have never heard of Valium. This scene is ironic because the person taking the Valium pill lived during a time when Valium was not invented.\n\nGolden Age\n\nWhen Gil gives Adriana the earrings, they go on a walk to different places. A while later they arrive in the 1890s. Here Adriana says this is the golden age, dismissing Gil’s remark that Adriana’s time is the golden age. This whole scenario shows us how ironically everyone doesn’t consider their presence to be that great and considers a time before theirs to be the golden age. This leads to a separation between Gil and Adriana.\n\nReality\n\nWe see Gil talking and meeting with many writers of old including Scott Fitzgerald, Zelda Fitzgerald, Hemingway. We see Gil suddenly open up about his novel to these writers and express his wish for someone to critique it. When Hemingway agrees to give it to Gertrude Stein, he rushes outside to get his book. This is ironic because is lost and drunk as well. His whole encounter with the writers never happens.\n\nLovely\n\nDuring his second meeting with Ernest Hemingway, he goes to give his novel to Gertrude Stein. There we see Picasso and Gertrude discussing a painting. The painting is of Adriana, a beautiful lady that Gil clears thinks is beauty. After this whole meeting, we see Gil Pender lying in bed next to Inez, and recounting his unbelievable night with those famous artists and writers. He also mentions how incredibly lovely the girl (Adriana) was. This is ironic because Gil is currently lying with his current love, Inez, and talks about another girl with the extremely infatuated expression about her beauty.\n\nDancing (Dialogue Irony)\n\nDuring dinner with her parents, Inez’s mother asks where did Gil run off too, referring to his absence from the dinner. Inez replies that Gil takes walks around Paris because he feels he gets inspired by them. After this, she leaves for dancing with Paul. A few dialogues after, Helen mentions how they are certain he doesn’t go dancing referencing his absence of not going dancing with Inez. Ironically, the very next shot we see Gil dancing."
