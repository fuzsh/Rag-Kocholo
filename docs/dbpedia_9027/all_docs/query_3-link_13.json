        "text": "Through their aesthetic techniques, politics, and ideas, modernist writers responded to the advent of the twentieth century in radical and innovative ways. Topics in Modernism introduces students to a range of writings, both fictional and non-fictional, from the first quarter of the century, as well as some examples from the visual arts. Modernism was a multimedia enterprise, developing across the visual arts, political thought, and the sciences, as well as in literature. Thus Study Unit 1 conveys the diversity of modernism as it appears firstly in painting, and then in the essays and writings of a number of critics, scientists, psychologists and political theorists. These contexts provide the foundation for the remainder of the course, which studies the ways in which three British and Irish writers, E.M. Forster, Virginia Woolf, and James Joyce, provided their unique response to modernism. Study Unit 2 examines Forster’s late modernist novel A Passage to India, exploring the ways in which through his presentation of a racial and multicultural conflict Forster taps into deeper modernist concerns with realism and ethics. Study Unit 3 looks at the different genre of the short story, a form which reached its apotheosis during the modernist period. Whereas Forster examined the foreign land of India, Woolf and Joyce represent their local cities and domestic environments. Yet within these homely spaces they create fictions that articulate the new ways in which the self was perceived within society in the first half of the twentieth century.\n\nWith the intention of portraying the film director (actor, screenwrit-er) Woody Allen as a (non-typical) existentialist and postmodernist in the genre of film comedy, the author of this paper first explicates the basic terms-philosophical existentialism and artistic postmod-ernism. The central part of this paper is dedicated to the analysis of typical scenes from the most important Allen's films (Annie Hall, Love and Death, Irrational Man, etc.) where, on the one hand, his position on the meaninglessness of life, death, the absurd, despair is empha-sizedand in which, on the other, he uses certain postmodern forms to aesthetically shape his thoughts. The research approach is close to the cultural studies discourse in it being multidisciplinary, that is, drawing together sociology, philosophy, psychology, semiology and aesthetics in an intrinsic, and not a mechanic manner. The author's aim is to empirically determine whether and to which extent Woody Allen's film creativity is informed by the existentialist thought of Kier-kegaard, Heidegger or Sartre, on the one hand, and how affected he is in the aesthetic sense by postmodern philosophers Lyotard, Jameson and Baudrillard, on the other. Despite the fact that Woody Allen is not a typical postmodernist, it is challenging and creatively inspi-rational to examine the specific characteristics of his postmodernist expression (intertextuality, self-reflectiveness, nonlinear narrative, eclecticism, intertwining of genre conventions), as well as the post-modernist narrative techniques he employs (parody, irony, pastiche, satire, allusion). Key words: Woody Allen, existence, the absurd, freedom, postmodernism, film, parody.\n\nAt a juncture in which art and culture are saturated with the forces of commodification, this book argues that problems, forms, and positions that defined modernism are crucially relevant to the condition of contemporary art and culture. The volume is attuned to the central concerns of recent scholarship on modernism and contemporary culture: the problems of aesthetic autonomy and the specific role of art in preserving a critical standpoint for cultural production; the relationship between politics and the category of the aesthetic; the problems of temporality and contemporaneity; literary transnationalism; and the questions of medium and medium specificity. Ranging across art forms, mediums, disciplines, and geographical locations, essays address the foundational questions that fuse modernism and the contemporary moment: What is art? What is the relation between art and the economy? How do art and technology interpenetrate and trans- form each other? What is modernism’s logic of time and contemporaneity, and how might it speak to the problem of thinking genuine novelty, or the possibility of an alternative to the current stage of neoliberal capitalism? What is modernism, and what is its history? The book is thus committed to revising our understanding of what modernism was in its earlier instantiations, and in accounting for the current moment, addressing the problems raised by modernism’s afterlives and reverberations in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. The volume includes essays that consider literature, sociology, philosophy, visual art, music, architecture, digital culture, tele- vision, and other artistic media. It synthesizes the most recent thinking on modernism and contemporary culture and presents a compelling case for what happens to literature, art, and culture in the wake of the exhaustion of postmodernism. This book will be of interest to those studying literature, visual art, media studies, architecture, literary theory, modernism, and twentieth-century and contemporary culture more generally."
