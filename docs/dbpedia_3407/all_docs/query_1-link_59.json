        "text": "It really must be hard to find good child actors, huh?\n\nBizarre things that happened in this movie:\n\n- The main character’s name is Omri\n\n- Omri’s friend gives him a single Native American figurine for his birthday because it reminded him of him. If you’re wondering why this toy reminded him of his white friend, join the club. It’s never explained.\n\n- Omri’s brother found a small, dirty cupboard abandoned in an alley somewhere and thought “hey, this’ll be perfect for my kid brother’s birthday present.”\n\n- Omri seemed genuinely delighted to be given the cupboard, so what do I know?\n\n- When he opens the cupboard and finds Little Bear inside, alive, for the first time, all Omri does is smile and stare at him. He shows no sign of surprise or worry or fear at the miracle that’s been presented to him.\n\n- He comes home from school and rushes to open the cupboard again, only to find a plastic figurine again, and he’s SO disappointed, as if he’d lost his best friend in the whole world, even though he’d only known him for a few moments.\n\n- After bringing Little Bear back to life, Omri’s mom asks Omri if he’s feeling better. He answers her with a long pause before saying “I feel pretty damn good.” And his mom just smiles and says she’s glad about it. If I had said “damn” to my mother at that age, I never would’ve heard the end of it.\n\n- The final shot of this movie is a good twenty second close up of Omri smiling. It’s very long and very awkward.\n\n- The cowboy character says several racist and hurtful things to and about Little Bear and all Native peoples, and after a couple short interactions Little Bear calls him his friend.\n\nI did very much appreciate that Little Bear distinguishes himself and his customs, those of the Iroquois, from those of other Native American peoples."
