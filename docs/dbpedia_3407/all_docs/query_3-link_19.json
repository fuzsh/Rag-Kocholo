The lien also has Public Defender and Public Advocate services incurred in 2014 and 2015 totaling $862.10. The lienee began exhibiting unusual and dangerous behavior and was treated at the South Dakota Human Services Center in Yankton for mental illness and dementia. He has been discharged and resides at an assisted living center in Sioux Falls. The lienee has no ability to work. His resources include several checking accounts and an IRA with a combined value of $7,500, which will be exhausted within six months. The request is for a compromise and release of the lien in full with no payment. MOTION by Barth, seconded by Bender, to approve Resolution MC15-53. 5 ayes.\n\nRESOLUTION MC15-53\n\nWHEREAS, a County Aid Lien in the amount of $6,179.16 purports to exist in favor of Minnehaha County and against DPNO 82777 as Lienee, and\n\nWHEREAS, said lienee has filed an application with the County Auditor stating such facts as provided for by Law,\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that after due consideration of the circumstances the Board of County Commissioners finds it advisable and proper to authorize the Chairman of the County Board and the County Auditor to execute the following:\n\nCompromise and release the lien in full with no payment.\n\nDated at Sioux Falls, South Dakota, this 25th day of August, 2015.\n\nAPPROVED BY\n\nTHE COMMISSION:\n\nCindy Heiberger\n\nChairman\n\nATTEST:\n\nCynthia Jepsen\n\nDeputy County Auditor\n\nChairperson Heiberger adjourned the meeting as the Minnehaha County Commission to convene in joint meeting with the Dell Rapids City Council, with intent to reconvene as the Minnehaha County Commission alone for the rest of its regular agenda after adjournment of the joint meeting.\n\nThe Minnehaha County Commission reconvened.\n\nPRESENTATION\n\nKristen Benidt, South Eastern Council of Governments (SECOG) GIS Analyst/Planner, presented the Minnehaha County Rural Site Assessment conducted by SECOG staff and the South Dakota Department of Agriculture. The study determined locations that would accommodate concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFO) development and agriculturally-related commercial/industrial development (AID). No sites were found that fit the study criteria for CAFO sites, and 182 sites qualified as good or better for AID sites. Paul Kostboth, Director of Agricultural Development, South Dakota Department of Agriculture, stated he hopes the County finds the report useful and with the Commission’s approval, they will send confidential letters to landowners identified in the study letting them know if they are interested in learning more to contact the South Dakota Department of Agriculture. Mr. Kostboth also said they would like to work with a person of the Commission’s choosing to continue to build on the groundwork of the study. Scott Anderson, Planning & Zoning Director, stated the current floodplain map was used as criteria for the study, and proposed changes to the map are mostly in the City of Sioux Falls joint jurisdiction area where CAFOS are not allowed. Mr. Anderson also stated that the CAFO criteria for the study was based on setbacks for a 3,000 head dairy operation and the county doesn’t receive many requests for CAFOS of that size. Mr. Kostboth stated that the criteria of the study can be changed and they are willing to work with the county in doing that. MOTION by Barth, seconded by Beninga, to approve the South Dakota Department of Agriculture sending letters to landowners identified in the study. 5 ayes. Chairperson Heiberger stated she will have staff collect information from the Commissioners on who may be interested in working on the study, and an appointment will be made at a future commission meeting.\n\nAPPOINTMENT\n\nMOTION by Bender, seconded by Barth, to appoint Ken McFarland to the Minnehaha County Surplus Property Appraisal Board. 5 ayes.
