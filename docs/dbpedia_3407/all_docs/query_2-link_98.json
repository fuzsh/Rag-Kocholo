        "text": "For a quick start of automated dispensing of fuel at the stations, we recommend using the Prime FMS controller.\n\nPrime FMS controller is needed for two scenarios:\n\nIf your fuel station is not automated, the controller enables you to automatically dispense fuel via the mobile application for customers, the mobile application for assistants, a self-service kiosk, or a cash register.\n\nThe processes at your fuel station are already automated and you have a control system. We can install a Prime FMS controller that will not disrupt the existing scheme of operations, while being able to manage dispensing of fuel when receiving commands e.g., about refueling using a mobile application, via the Internet.\n\nRead about integration schemes in our article\n\nPrime FMS controller enables control over petroleum, LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas), CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) dispensers, and automatic tank gauge systems and probes. The controller knows communication protocols of a wide range of dispensers and ATG systems and probes and provides control over any pumps and probes in a uniform way, either by using private communication protocols or with help of communication protocols of popular pumps and ATG systems.\n\nWith the Prime FMS controller, POS systems, cash registers, payment terminals, and mobile applications can control any dispensers and ATG systems at your station in the same way no matter what brand of hardware you use.\n\nFeatures\n\nCredit card size for easy installation in any hardware\n\nSupports more than 100 brands of dispensers\n\nSupports more than 30 brands of ATG systems and probes\n\nSupports simultaneous operation with 50 dispensers and with 50 tanks\n\nSSL/TLS layers for secured communication\n\nBuilt-in web-server for monitoring, configuration, reporting and control\n\nCommunication interfaces: RS-232, RS-485 and Ethernet\n\nRich set of interface converters\n\nAutomatic operation with storage of pumps sales and tanks measurements to the local database\n\nAutomatic upload of data to the remote server\n\nCost-effective\n\nBenefits\n\nAble to work automatically standalone without POS, or be controlled by POS or work in parallel with existing POS\n\nCan be installed inside dispensers and ATG consoles (for reconciliation and automatic tanks calibration)\n\nProvides easy way to make mobile app connect to dispensers and ATG consoles in parallel with local POS\n\nBuilt-in web-server provides easy control and reporting over pumps and tanks even from your mobile phone\n\nAutomatic calculation of in-tank deliveries\n\nAutomatic calculation of temperatute-compensated volume in tanks and in pump sales\n\nAutomatic upload of pumps sales and tanks measurements to remote server for reporting and analysis\n\nFunctionality\n\nSupports over 85 communication protocols of fuel dispensers and ATG systems. List of supported communication protocols is constantly growing. Single firmware of Prime FMS controller contains all available communication protocols for fuel dispensers and ATG systems.\n\nControl up to 50 fuel dispenser sides (fueling places): Prime FMS controller has 4 independent pump ports, each of them can be configured to its own communication protocol and baud rate, thus Prime FMS controller provides communication with connected dispensers simultaneously using up to 4 various communication protocols.\n\nControl up to 50 ATG probes (gauges): Prime FMS controller has 3 independent probe ports, each of them can be configured to its own communication protocol and baud rate, thus Prime FMS controller provides communication with connected probes simultaneously using up to 3 various communication protocols.\n\nUnified approach to management over any forecourt equipment: using Prime FMS controller control over any supported fuel dispenser or ATG system is done in exactly the same way by the management system (POS system, cash register, OPT terminal, server or mobile application, etc). Prime FMS controller has a single common communication protocol. Thus having once implemented the protocol into the management system (or its API) the management system will be able to provide control over any of the supported fuel dispensers and ATG systems in exactly the same way.\n\nAutomatic mode of operation: Prime FMS controller automatically authorizes dispensers and saves all pumps sales and tanks measurements to SD flash disk with a possibility of reports generation.\n\nAutomatic calculation of product volume in tank based on tank’s calibration chart.\n\nAutomatic calculation of product temperature-compensated volume in tank and in pump sales based on product temperature-expansion coefficient.\n\nAutomatic detection of product deliveries in tank.\n\nAutomatic data upload to remote server: Prime FMS controller can send data pumps sales and tanks measurements to remote server for reporting and analysis.\n\nConversion between pumps protocols: in case if POS system already knows communication protocols of dispensers – then it can use Prime FMS controller for its conversion to any other pump protocols.\n\nConversion between ATG consoles protocols: in case if POS system already knows communication protocols of ATG consoles – then it can use Prime FMS controller for its conversion to any other ATG console or probe protocols.\n\nReal-time control over fuel dispensers and ATG systems. Prime FMS controller provides a hardware solution for stable and reliable operation of forecourt equipment.\n\nPossibility to provide control over same fuel dispensers from several POS systems: several control systems can connect to single Prime FMS controllers using Ethernet interface.\n\nInstallation on existing petrol stations without any integration with POS systems: Prime FMS controller can be installed between existing POS systems and dispensers and ATG systems and provide monitoring, control and reporting.\n\nRich set of interface converters for connection to fuel dispensers: Prime FMS controller can connect to dispensers with almost all types of electrical interfaces.\n\nBuilt-in web-server for configuration, monitoring, control, reporting, self-diagnostics and firmware update.\n\nLogging of operation: in order to remove problematic situations of Prime FMS controller communication with any forecourt equipment logging of communication exchange without interrupting Prime FMS controller operation is available, which allows quick search and elimination of any found problems.\n\nSelf-diagnostics of operation: easy and quick built-in diagnostics of Prime FMS controller operation: CPU, memory, Ethernet, RS-232 and RS-485 interfaces, DIP-switches, SD flash disk.\n\nConstant software updates: Prime FMS controller firmware is constantly being improved, new protocols are being added and latest updates are always available for download to all customers.\n\nEasy firmware updating: all new firmware updates are available for download to all existing customers. Firmware update process takes about 1 minute.\n\nSupport by developers for developers: support for all customers on any standing issues.\n\nCredit-card size: suits to any dimensions for installation inside master systems.\n\nSupport more than 100 brands of fuel dispensers from various manufacturers: 2A, Actronic, Adast (Adamov Systems), Ag Walker, Agira, Angi International, Ariel, Aspro, Assytech, Astron, Azt, Baransay, Batchen, Bennett, Blue Sky, Censtar, CFT Clean Fuel, Compac, Coptron, Coritec, Datian Machines, Dem G.
