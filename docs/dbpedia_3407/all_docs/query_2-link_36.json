Each week, experts from around the world are brought to Rice to present the latest findings and research in the broadly defined bioengineering field. In Spring 2024, the BIOE Colloquia will be held on Thursdays.\n\nUpcoming Seminars\n\nThursday, April 25\n\nGiovanni Traverso, MB, BChir, PHD\n\nAssociate Professor, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Division of Gastroenterology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School\n\n\"Engineering drug delivery and sensing solutions for an extreme environment\"\n\nAbstract: Professor Traverso will aim to review ongoing efforts in his lab towards the development of drug delivery and sensing technologies capable of operating in extreme environments like gastrointestinal tract. Specifically, he will present advances in materials science, device development and translational efforts toward addressing medication non-adherence and the dosing macromolecules.\n\nBiography\n\nDr. Traverso is an Associate Professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Associate Physician in the Division of Gastroenterology, Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH), Harvard Medical School. He received his undergraduate and medical degrees from Trinity College, University of Cambridge, UK, and his PhD from the lab of Prof. Bert Vogelstein at Johns Hopkins University where he developed non-invasive tests for the detection of colon cancer. For his post-doctoral research, he worked in the laboratory of Professor Robert Langer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) where he developed a series of novel technologies for drug delivery as well as physiological sensing via the gastrointestinal tract. His current research program is focused on developing the next generation of drug delivery systems to enable efficient delivery of therapeutics through the gastrointestinal tract as well developing novel ingestible electronic devices for sensing a broad array of physiologic and pathophysiologic parameters.\n\nPast Seminars\n\n​\n\n​\n\nThursday, April 18\n\nDanielle Tullman-Ercek, PHD\n\nProfessor in the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering at Northwestern University, Co-Director of the NU Center for Synthetic Biology, Director of the Master of Science in Biotechnology Program\n\n“Designing with nanoscale building blocks: How protein engineering enables new solutions for medicine, sustainability, and material”\n\nAbstract:Self-assembling proteins make up precisely ordered nanostructures from filaments and capsules to pumps, each of which, is promising for applications ranging from biomanufacturing to medicine to materials. For example, a nanoscale protein-based container could serve as a vaccine or as a delivery vehicle for cellular or gene therapy. However, such structures must be tunable for each application, and despite great leaps in our ability to predict how amino acid sequences will fold into soluble protein, it remains a significant challenge to predict how proteins come together to form the assemblies and machines that are ubiquitous to life. To address this challenge, and inspired by advances in next-generation DNA synthesis and sequencing, we developed a workflow to fully characterize the assembly competency of all possible single mutations in several model systems, including those from a virus-like particle, a bacterial organelle, and a secretion system. The resulting high-resolution datasets challenge several conventional protein design assumptions on the composition of linkers, mutability of pores, and more. We then used the same approach but screened for desired functions to enhance the performance of each system in its target application space. For example, a protein filament of a secretion system was engineered to confer >2-fold higher production of a target product, a virus-like particle was engineered for improved endosomal release upon sensing a drop in pH, and a bacterial microcompartment was engineered to produce biochemicals in a sustainable manner. With this talk, I will provide examples of how our sequencing-based approach is useful as a tool for uncovering the fundamental rules of self-assembly as well as for engineering new function into self-assembling systems, highlighting how such approaches maybe used to generate nanoscale precision design in next-generation materials\n\n​\n\nBiography\n\nDanielle Tullman-Ercek is a Professor in the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering at Northwestern University, Co-Director of the NU Center for Synthetic Biology, and Director of the Master of Science in Biotechnology Program.

This presentation will describe biomaterial properties and designs that impart cues to stem cells and other cell types to affect their behavior and tissue formation in vitro and in vivo. The design of functional, bioinspired materials to be used alone to recruit endogenous cells for tissue repair will also be discussed. Our recent work utilizes protein-based biomaterials as a metabolic approach for bone tissue repair, where studies demonstrate an effect on stem cell migration and differentiation. In combination with a gene knockout model, we are learning about the role of glutamine, which becomes available upon biomaterial degradation, and its effect on bone repair. We have also developed novel glycosaminoglycan (GAG) mimetics, which are sulfated polysaccharides that vary in their degree of sulfation and can be combined to form polymer blends to create scaffolds. Studies demonstrate their sequestration of growth factors and their effect on cartilage repair. ECM proteins, such as collagen and elastin, exhibit electromechanical behavior. Our work using piezoelectric materials, which are materials that provide electrical activity in response to mechanical stimuli, have been explored in in vitro and in vivo models with recent work using degradable, piezoelectric materials having tunable properties. These biomaterials and their potential use in orthopaedic and neural applications will be discussed.\n\nBiography\n\nTreena Livingston Arinzeh, PhD is a Professor of Biomedical Engineering at Columbia University.

However, these tools provide only a snapshot of a patient's condition and the disease. The emerging field of bioelectronics has the potential to revolutionize healthcare by enabling continuous health monitoring. Devices capable of interacting with the human body, reading and processing information can revolutionize our understanding of disease and enable personalized treatment. Current challenges to the comprehensive integration of molecular diagnostics with bioelectronics include limited long-term functionality, stability, and robustness. State-of-the-art molecular diagnostic tools are often resource-intensive and expensive, rendering them inaccessible to many communities worldwide. My research program is dedicated to addressing these technological shortcomings that have hindered the integration of bioanalytical tools into modern medicine. In this seminar, I will discuss our recent multidisciplinary efforts to develop robust diagnostics tool kits including a reagent-free electrochemical assay for biomarker analysis as well as the engineering of an optical method for monitoring food health. I will then introduce the future plans of the Yousefi lab. We aim to advance alternative manufacturing methods for rapid diagnostics and engineer measurement systems that are resilient, durable, and capable of withstanding harsh conditions. By overcoming bio-interface limitations, I aim to not only introduce long-lasting in vivo function to medical devices but create opportunities for high-throughput, high resolution in vitro disease analysis.\n\nBiography\n\nDoctor Hanie Yousefi (She/Her/Hers) is a biotech innovator, mentor, entrepreneur, and an advocate for equitable health.

For aggressive diseases like ovarian cancer, RNAi therapies can serve a robust treatment modality if delivered successfully. Ovarian cancer requires an effective therapeutic strategy to sensitize tumors to chemotherapy due to high relapse rates and drug resistance in advanced stages. As of 2024, the FDA has only approved six siRNA therapies- none of which are approved for cancer treatment. Enhancing siRNA delivery to extrathepatic sites is essential due to the extracellular and intracellular barriers that limit its effectiveness. One promising avenue for overcoming delivery challenges lies in the rational design of amino acid sequences, which can be tailored to engineer peptides with diverse functionalities. These peptides hold the potential to serve as versatile nucleic acid delivery systems, capable of navigating the intricate barriers within the body to reach their intended targets. This talk will highlight the feasibility of peptide sequences to effectively deliver siRNA and silence oncogenes in in vitro and in vivo ovarian cancer models. By harnessing the unique properties of these engineered peptides, potentially new avenues for targeted RNAi therapy can be unlocked, not only for ovarian cancer but also other diseases where RNSi therapy holds therapeutic promise\n\nBiography\n\nK. Lora Alatise earned her B.S. in Biomedical Engineering from the University of Rochester, working with Dr. Danielle Benoit in her Therapeutic Biomaterials lab as a Ronald E. McNair Postbaccalaureate Achievement Scholar. Her research focused on characterizing peptide-conjugated polymeric nanoparticles for small molecule drug delivery. Currently, she is a Ph.D. candidate in Bioengineering at Clemson University, conducting research in Dr. Angela Alexander-Bryant’s Nanobiotechnology Lab, where her dissertation focuses on improving nucleic acid delivery to ovarian tumors. At Clemson, Lora has garnered recognition for her research and service, receiving several awards including the 2023 Eugene M. Langan III Service Award and the Call Me Doctor Fellowship. During her Ph.D., she gained additional expertise by conducting formulation research in Genetic Medicine at Eli Lilly and Company. Upon completing her Ph.D., Lora aims to continue advancing targeted delivery systems for nucleic acid delivery to study and treat diseases that affect distinct and minoritized populations. Lora is passionate about training the next generation of engineers – she actively mentors undergraduate students in research projects and outside of the lab.\n\nThursday, February 29\n\nAndrew Tsourkas, PHD\n\nProfessor and Undergraduate Chair, Department of Bioengineering at The University of Pennsylvania\n\n\"Engineering novel antibody and nanoparticle platforms for imaging and therapeutic applications\n\nAbstract: A major goal of my research program is to develop novel molecular imaging agents and targeted therapeutics. In particular, we are (i) developing new nanoformulations for diverse biomedical applications, including image-guided surgery, photodynamic therapy, and sonodynamic therapy; (ii) investigating new targeted strategies that maximize specificity and sensitivity or improve the accumulation and penetration of nanomaterials within tumors; and (iii) developing new bioconjugation techniques that enable the highly efficient, site-specific labeling of proteins, including antibodies. These bioconjugation tools have allowed us to pursue a variety of unique applications, including the conversion of cancer patients' own antibodies into tumor-targeting, T cell re-directing bispecific antibodies. We have also taken advantage of our site-specific bioconjugation technologies to deliver antibodies and proteins into the cytoplasm of living cells, which has enabled the inhibition and degradation of 'undruggable' protein targets. We hope that these tools will help facilitate the movement towards more personalized medicine, whereby treatments are tailored to individual patients.\n\nBiography\n\nAndrew Tsourkas, Ph.D. is a Professor and Undergraduate Chair of Bioengineering at the University of Pennsylvania. He received his Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering in 1997 from Cornell University and his Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering from the Georgia Tech/Emory University joint Ph.D. program in 2002. He conducted a post-doctoral fellowship in the Department of Radiology at Harvard University, before joining Penn in 2004. Dr. Tsourkas is currently the Co-Director for the Center for Targeted Therapeutics and Translational Nanomedicine. He was a recipient of the Coulter Foundation Early Career Award, the National Science Foundation CAREER Award, and was elected fellow of the American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering.\n\nThursday, February 15\n\nRobert Bowles, Ph.D.\n\nAssociate Professor, Department of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Utah\n\n\"CRISPR for Discovery, Design, and Development of Musculoskeletal Therapeutics\"\n\nAbstract: The development of CRISPR gene regulation systems have opened the door for novel gene and cell therapy strategies. While these systems allow for the targeted and precise regulation of gene expression and can be utilized to engineer cells for a multitude of applications, these systems are also very powerful tools for discovering novel biology and therapeutic targets. Here we will cover its use to neuromodulate pain, engineer cells for tissue engineering in the first part of the talk and explore our discovery of a novel regulator or senescence using theses systems, ZNF865, and its broad potential applications to aging, musculoskeletal disorders, and neurodegenerative disorders.\n\nBiography\n\nI have been studying the intervertebral disc (IVD) and related back pain for over two decades (23 years). I started as an undergrad at the University of Pennsylvania investigating spine biomechanics, which ignited my interest in IVD tissue engineering strategies that target the regeneration and replacement of degenerative IVD tissue at Cornell University. Wanting a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of pain, I pursued postdoctoral training as an NIH NRSA Postdoctoral Fellow at Duke University investigating the development and maintenance of pain in musculoskeletal preclinical animal models of osteoarthritis and peripheral neuropathies. This postdoctoral training had the added bonus of providing training in lentiviral gene delivery systems, drug delivery for inflammation, and, gene editing/regulation. I have been primarily focused on combining these skill sets, and using CRISPR gene regulation, to solve critical problems in the musculoskeletal space. My laboratory has the distinction of being the first to modify a stem cell with CRISPR epigenome editing and the first to characterize ZNF865, a novel regulator of senescence. My laboratory is currently funded by the NIH to investigate CRISPR epigenome editing in multiple cell types\n\nThursday, February 22\n\nJuan Hu, Ph.D.\n\nPostdoctoral Fellow-University of California, Irvine\n\n\"High-Throughput Technologies to Illuminate the Molecular Basis of Membrane Penetration within the Rule of 5 and Beyond\"\n\nFuture Leader in Bioengineering\n\nAbstract: How do molecules cross the cell membrane and what properties allow them to do so? Lipinski’s Rule of 5 generally defines physicochemical properties (molecular weight, lipophilicity) that correlate with good membrane permeability and oral bioavailability. Increasingly, drug discovery projects involve so called “undruggable” protein targets, which generally benefit from chemical space beyond the Lipinski's rule of 5 (bRo5), but these molecules suffer compromised cellular permeability and bioavailability due to unclear structure-permeation relationships. I have developed high-throughput permeation measurement technology – which could elucidate such relationships – as demonstrated through the discovery of unexpected relationships between stereochemistry and membrane permeation. My talk will describe this discovery and its potential implications for drug discovery and the origins of life. I will also discuss our ongoing efforts to explore and define the properties that confer membrane permeability within the Rule of 5 and beyond.\n\nBiography\n\nDr. Hu achieved her doctoral degree in chemistry from Auburn University in 2018 under the guidance of Professor Christopher J. Easley in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry. There, she developed sensitive immunoassays and microfluidic tools for studying dynamics of hormone secretion from cells related to diabetes and obesity. She then joined the Department of Chemistry at Scripps Research for her postdoctoral training under the guidance of Professor Brian M.

While fluorescent and bioluminescent proteins are widely used as reporters, their utility in deep tissues is limited due to the scattering and absorption of light, which impede imaging beyond a depth of ~ 1 mm from the tissue surface. To overcome this challenge, my research harnesses unexpected connections between proteins and the physics of magnetic resonance (MRI) to create new biomolecular reporters for deep tissue imaging. In this talk, I will discuss our recent efforts to address three long-standing challenges in the development of viable MRI reporters: sensitivity, specificity, and sensor design. First, I will highlight our recent work in increasing reporter gene sensitivity to detect small numbers of genetically labeled cells, potentially, as few as hundred cells per imaging voxel. I will then describe the creation of chemically erasable reporters, which enable “hotspot” imaging with a low tissue background. Finally, I will discuss a new modular approach for programming MRI sensors based on protease modulation of reporter activity.\n\nBiography\n\nArnab Mukherjee is an Assistant Professor of Chemical Engineering & Biological Engineering at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

RG's seminar will cover how inflammation is a key feature of CF and in particular how CF immune cell dysfunction is key feature of the inflammatory process. New CF drug therapies that target the basic defect in CF have additional significant effects on CF immune cells that may be beneficial for people with CF and are increasing our understanding of the inflammatory process in CF. We are now using cells from people with CF to define the on-going inflammation process in CF and deploying them in ex-vivo tissue models to drive therapeutic discovery. A full understanding of the inflammatory process in CF will require cross-disciplinary collaborative research that will allow new therapeutic approaches to be discovered and tested before taking treatments back into clinical trial. RG will outline these initiatives today.\n\nBiography\n\nRobert Gray is Professor of Respiratory Medicine at the School of Infection and immunity and an Honorary Consultant Pulmonologist at NHS GGC.

Stanford University\n\n\"The Delicate Interplay Between Light, Interfaces and Design: The Complex Dance that Allows 3D Printing to Scale to Manufacturing\"\n\nAbstract: The production of polymer products relies largely on age-old molding techniques. A major reason for this is that additive methods have not delivered meaningful alternatives to traditional processes-until not. In this talk, I will describe Continuous Liquid Interface Productions (CLIP) technology, which embodies a convergence of advances in software, hardware, and materials to bring the digital revolution to polymer additive manufacturing. CLIP uses software-controlled chemistry to produce commercial quality parts rapidly and at scale by capitalizing on the principle of oxygen-inhibited photopolymerization to generate a conjugal liquid interface of uncured resin between a forming part and a printer's exposure window. Instead pf printing layer-by-layer, this allows layerless parts to 'grow' from a pool of resin, formed by light. Compatible with a wide range of polymers, CLIP opes major opportunities for innovative products across diverse industries. Previously unmakeable products are already manufactured at scale with CLIP, including the large-scale production of running shoes by Adidas (Futurecraft 4D); mass customized football helmets by Riddell; the world's first FDA-approved 3D printed dentures; and numerous parts in automotive, consumer electronics, and medicine. At Stanford, we are pursuing new advances including digital therapeutic devices in pediatric medicine, new multi-materials printing approaches, recyclable materials, and the design of a high-resolution printer to advance technologies in the microelectronics and drug/vaccine delivery areas, including novel micro needle designs as a potent vaccine delivery platform.\n\nBiography\n\nJoseph M. DeSimone is the Sanjiv Sam Gambhir Professor of Translational Medicine and Chemical Engineering at Stanford University.

He holds appointments in the Departments of Radiology and Chemical Engineering with courtesy appointments in the Department of Chemistry, the Department of Materials Science and Engineering, and Stanford’s Graduate School of Business. Previously,\n\nDeSimone was a professor of chemistry at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and of chemical engineering at North Carolina State University. He is also Co-founder, Board Member, and former CEO (2014 - 2019) of the additive manufacturing company, Carbon.\n\nDeSimone has published over 380 scientific articles and is a named inventor on over 240 issued patents. He has mentored 80 students through Ph.D. completion in his career, half of whom are women and members of underrepresented groups in STEM. In 2016 DeSimone was recognized by President Barack Obama with the National Medal of Technology and Innovation, the highest honor in the U.S. for achievement and leadership in advancing technological progress.\n\nDeSimone is responsible for numerous breakthroughs in his career in areas including green chemistry, medical devices, nanomedicine, and 3D printing, also co-founding several companies based on his research. In the 1990s he and students invented a green manufacturing process for the synthesis of fluoropolymer materials that eliminated so-called “forever chemicals” like PFAS, which was only partially commercialized by DuPont. In the mid-2000s, DeSimone and students developed a nanoparticle manufacturing platform rooted in an imprint lithography-based r2r process, PRINT (particle replication in non-wetting templates)—the first technology to enable large-scale fabrication of uniform nanoparticles for medicine with independent control over particle features such as size, shape, and composition. Based on PRINT, DeSimone co-founded Liquidia Technologies (NASDAQ: LQDA), which has multiple clinical products. DeSimone’s lab published a large body of research using PRINT to study how specific particle features influence biological processes and to advance the design of vaccines.\n\nMore recently, DeSimone and team invented a revolutionary 3D printing technology, CLIP (continuous liquid interface production). CLIP eliminates the slow, layer-by-layer construction seen with other polymer 3D printing approaches to enable parts to ‘grow’ continuously and rapidly from a pool of liquid resin. CLIP delivers production-grade parts comparable in performance to injection molded parts. Based on CLIP, DeSimone co- founded, and was the CEO of for six years, Carbon, Inc., now a global digital additive manufacturing company helping to advance product innovation in numerous industries, including medical, dental, footwear, automotive, and aerospace. CLIP is also used by many academic laboratories to advance research in areas including medical devices and implants.\n\nDeSimone has received numerous recognitions for achievements in science, engineering, invention, and business.

However, the drugs we typically use to treat diseases target a single protein and disregard the fact that cells within tissues are highly heterogeneous and have individualized responses that contribute to the tissue-level outcomes. To bridge the gap between protein and multi-cell/tissue-levels of spatial scale, my lab develops agent-based computational models and uses them in combination with experiments and machine learning approaches to predict how individual cell behaviors give rise to tissue-level adaptations. We have used agent-based modeling to simulate the structural adaptations of large and small blood vessels, cardiac and skeletal muscle regeneration following injury, and lung tissue remodeling during fibrosis. Our studies have suggested new mechanistic hypotheses and provided guidance for the design of novel therapies that account for the dynamic and heterogeneous interactions between different cell types within diseased and regenerating tissues.\n\nBiography\n\nShayn Peirce-Cottler, Ph.D. is Harrison Distinguished Teaching Professor and Chair of Biomedical Engineering, with secondary appointments in the Department of Ophthalmology and Department of Plastic Surgery at the University of Virginia (UVA).

Conventional electroporation approaches for bacterial gene delivery have distinct advantages, but they are typically limited to relatively small sample volumes, reducing their utility for applications requiring high throughput such as the generation of mutant libraries. Here, we present a scalable, large-scale bacterial gene delivery approach enabled by a disposable, user-friendly microfluidic electroporation device requiring minimal fabrication. We demonstrate that the proposed device can outperform conventional cuvettes in a range of situations, including across Escherichia coli strains with a range of electroporation efficiencies, and we use its large-volume bacterial electroporation capability to generate a library of transposon mutants in the anaerobic gut commensal Bifidobacterium longum. Results of this work hold exciting promise for accelerating genetic engineering of bacteria with wide ranging applications in industry and healthcare. Further, we will present recent efforts by a company spun out of the Buie Laboratory, Kytopen, which is leveraging the electroporation work to enable scalable non-viral transfection of mammalian cells. Applications of this work include engineered cell therapies such as CAR-T, which are currently plagued by high costs and manufacturing issues. The non-viral transfection approach developed by Kytopen has the potential to simplify and accelerate the development of life saving cellular therapies.\n\nBiography\n\nCullen Buie is an associate professor in MIT’s Department of Mechanical Engineering and director of the Laboratory for Energy and Microsystems Innovation.

Through the development of customized bioreactors with coordinated electromechanical stimulation and automated media changes, there's a marked reduction in contamination risks. Incorporating AI-driven technologies for sterile cell injections and the introduction of an in-situ curable semi-conductive hydrogel further propel the field to new heights. Moreover, the strategic application of cardiac dECM powder significantly advances the maturation of hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes, optimizing their responsiveness to electromechanical stimuli. With the integration of a cutting-edge magnetic bioreactor system and a cost-effective polylaminin protocol, not only is the quality of cardiomyocyte production enhanced, but also its scalability.

The flow of water across the cell surface follows osmotic and hydraulic pressure gradients, and is actively controlled by the cell. This physical fact suggests that the mechanical behavior of cells is intimately connected with cell ionic homeostasis and osmotic control. In this talk, we will describe some of our recent experimental and modeling work on water dynamics in cells. We explore how cells control their cytoplasm water content and therefore the cell size. We will describe how cells can use directional flow of water and ion channels such as the Na+/H+ exchanger to propel themselves and migrate, and in the case of epithelia, pump fluid between tissue compartments. In the later case, epithelial pumping of water can strongly influence tissue shape and morphogenesis. Taken together, we suggest a revision of the kinematic law of biological motion that takes these developments into account.\n\nBiography\n\nSean Sun is a professor of mechanical engineering and biomedical engineering at Johns Hopkins University and a member of the Institute of NanoBioTechnology (INBT) at JHU.

What captivates me about membranes is their ability to precisely and rapidly organize themselves in an environment of staggering complexity. Thousands of distinct protein species reside on cellular membranes, yet functional membrane protein complexes can form within seconds in response to diverse stimuli. Traditionally, structured protein assemblies such as vesicular coats and cytoskeletal filaments have been thought to organize membrane surfaces. In contrast, recent work illustrates that networks composed of proteins with a high degree of intrinsic disorder may provide the necessary flexibility to facilitate efficient assembly of functional protein complexes at membrane surfaces. In particular, our recent work has illustrated that a flexible network of disordered proteins helps to catalyze the assembly of endocytic structures at the plasma membrane. Specifically, we find that an intermediate strength of interaction between these proteins, which leads to liquid-like properties at the macro-scale, maximizes the efficiency of endocytic vesicle assembly. Interestingly, the stability of this catalytic network appears to be controlled by the degree of ubiquitination at endocytic sites, providing a potential mechanism for sensing the presence of transmembrane cargo proteins, many of which are ubiquitinated prior to removal from the plasma membrane. More broadly, the idea of a transition between a stochastic, disordered protein network toward a more ordered structure that is capable of deterministic outcomes provides a template for understanding many processes in membrane biology. At present our group is focused on characterizing these “disorder to order” transitions using a diverse toolset, which includes in vitro biochemistry, quantitative imaging of live engineered cells, and collaborations with theorists who work across a range of length scales. Specific areas of our ongoing work include the role of disordered protein networks in organizing the cytoskeleton, and transmembrane coupling of protein condensates as a novel mechanism of information transfer across biological interfaces.\n\nHernan Garcia, Ph.D.\n\nAssociate Professor of Genetics, Genomics and Development\n\nDepartment of Molecular & Cell Biology and Department of Physics\n\nUniversity of California at Berkeley\n\n“From SHG Microscopy to Space‐Time Optical Fields: Highlights from the PROBE Lab at Brown University”\n\nAbstract: Over the last few decades we have largely identified the repressors and activators that shape gene expression patterns in developing embryos and that, in turn, dictate cellular fates. Yet, despite amassing this great reservoir of knowledge, we are still incapable of predicting how the number, placement and affinity of binding sites for these transcription factors in regulatory DNA dictate gene expression patterns in space and time. Achieving such predictive understanding calls for going beyond molecular parts lists and for obtaining the in vivo biochemical information necessary for fueling theoretical models of transcriptional regulation in developing animals.\n\nIn this talk, I will show how we are using physics as a “microscope” to uncover the molecular mechanisms by which activators and repressors dictate transcription in space and time in developing animals. Specifically, using novel quantitative tools that we have developed for precision measurements, I will show that most developmental genes are transcribed in stochastic bursts, and that many transcription factors regulate gene expression by modulating the frequency, duration, and/or amplitude of these bursts. We will then engage in an iterative dialogue between theoretical models and quantitative experiments aimed at revealing the mechanisms underlying this control of transcriptional bursting. Our results challenge the textbook picture of activator and repressor action based on stable protein-protein interactions and call for a description of transcriptional control that acknowledges that the nucleus is not a bag of well-mixed transcription factors. Most importantly, our work sets a path forward for reaching a predictive understanding of cellular decision making and demonstrates how a quantitative dialogue between theory and experiment can shed light on biological mechanisms beyond the reach of even the best super resolution microscopes.\n\nBiography\n\nHernan G.

The interaction of cells with collagen occurs via specific receptors and regulates both cell and matrix function. We describe here a two-way cross-talk between collagen and the collagen receptor discoidin domain receptor (DDR1). DDR1 is a receptor tyrosine kinases expressed in a variety of mammalian cells. On one hand DDR1 regulates the collagen fibril structure while on the other hand the fibrillar state of collagen impacts receptor function. An altered collagen fibril structure in turn can affect cell-matrix interactions, which have multiple manifestations in health and disease. We elucidate such an effect in vascular biology, wherein the DDR1 knockout mice exhibited enhanced platelet-collagen adhesion and increased thrombogeneity of the vessel wall. Our investigations also reveal that structural alterations in collagen fibril (accompanied by DDR1 activation) exist in vascular diseases such as aortic aneurysms, which can impact platelet adhesion, vascular calcification and mechanics.\n\nBiography1\n\nDr. Gunjan Agarwal is a Professor in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at the Ohio State University.

Much progress has been made in the molecular understanding of how physical stimuli are sensed and transduced by cells into biochemical signals (mechano-signaling and mechano-transduction), which then regulate gene transcription processes and subsequently cell decision making. Beyond the physical properties of cellular microenvironments, that engineers could easily produce and tune, the reciprocal mechanical signaling between cells and their extracellular environments also involves the stretching of proteins and thus an off-on, or on-off switching of exposed molecular binding sites. Protein stretching can actually switch the structure-function relationships of extracellular as well as of intracellular proteins, which defines the underpinning principles of mechanobiology. Translating what has been learned in mechanobiology (mostly on single cells) to real organs, and finally to the clinic, is hampered by at least two challenges: the lack of nanoscale sensors to probe forces or tissue fiber tensions in healthy versus diseased organs. To bring our knowledge to the patient, we developed a nanosensor to visualize the tensional states of ECM fibers in animal models and in human tissues, with many unexpected findings that were not anticipated from 2D cell culture studies. Underpinning mechano-regulated mechanisms and the significance of these findings in cancer will be discussed.\n\nBiography\n\nViola Vogel’s research in Bioengineering focuses on how to exploit emerging knowledge in Mechanobiology for Applications in Tissue Engineering, Regenerative Medicine and to treat inflammatory diseases. With experimental and computational tools, she discovered various structural mechanisms how cells sense mechanical forces and convert them into biochemical signals, ultimately altering molecular transcription processes.

However, tumor recurrence, metastasis, and chemoresistance are significant causes of mortality in many tumor types. Like any other organ in the body, tumors harbor cancer stem cells, capable of regenerating the tumor or allowing it to escape a chemotherapy insult. Cancer stem cells are also responsible for aggressive metastasis and chemoresistance. Typical to organogenesis and regeneration, tumors actively recruit supporting stromal cells, bypass immune targeting, and recur and metastasize by harnessing microenvironmental cues. Within this context, how cancer stem cells evade immune suppression and metastasize is of significant interest. Unpacking this interaction will lead to the development of new targeted and immunotherapies to curb metastatic spread and its associated mortality. Here, we will look through a biomedical engineer’s lens to identify variables within the cancer stem cell/immune axis, construct engineered models to isolate the variable and further our understanding of how cancers metastasize.\n\nBiography\n\nDr. Raghavan is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Texas A&M University.

The high cost of BC stems largely from its high recurrence rate (>50%); hence, BC management involves frequent surveillance. Unfortunately, the current in-office standard-of-care tool for BC surveillance, white light cystoscopy (WLC), is limited by low sensitivity and specificity for carcinoma in situ (CIS), a high-grade carcinoma with high potential to metastasize. Early detection and complete eradication of CIS are critical to improve treatment outcomes and to minimize recurrence. The most promising macroscopic technique to improve sensitivity to CIS detection, blue light cystoscopy (BLC), is costly, time-intensive, has low availability and a high false-positive rate. Given the limitations of WLC, we aim to change the paradigm around how BC surveillance is performed by validating new tools with high sensitivity and specificity for CIS that are appropriate for in-office use. In this seminar, I discuss our innovative solutions to improve visualization and mapping of suspicious lesions as well as to create miniature tools for optical detection based on optical coherence tomography (OCT). OCT and its functional variant, polarization-sensitive OCT, can detect early-stage BC with better sensitivity and specificity than WLC. We discuss the critical technical innovations necessary to make OCT and PS-OCT a practical tool for in-office use, and new results from recent explorations of human bladder samples that speak to the promise of this approach to change the management of patient care.\n\nBiography\n\nAudrey K Bowden is the Dorothy J.

Unlike conventional drug depots, this new generation of drug depots can be administered and removed non-invasively. Thus, they do not require surgery. Furthermore, Dr. Nguyen will discuss the development of auxetic patches for dynamic organ repair. Current patches do not conform to the complex mechanics of dynamic organs, such as the lung or heart. To address these limitations, Dr. Nguyen’s lab has developed a scalable patch platform that is instantly adhesive and able to conform to volumetric changes for dynamic organ and wound repair.\n\nBiography\n\nJuliane Nguyen, Ph.D., is an Associate Professor and Vice Chair in the Division of Pharmacoengineering and Molecular Pharmaceutics, School of Pharmacy, at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering\n\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n\n“Unlocking the Power of Bioactive Lipid Signaling for Immunoengineering and Regenerative Medicine”\n\nAbstract: Innate immune cells play a crucial role in tissue growth, stability, and injury recovery. They guide blood vessel restructuring, activate local stem and progenitor cells, and direct tissue repair, such as in muscle and skin. To leverage this innate ability, immunoregenerative biomaterials are being developed that target specific subpopulations of monocytes/macrophages to promote repair by controlling their recruitment, positioning, differentiation, and function in damaged tissues. Monocyte and macrophage phenotypes range from inflammatory (M1) to pro-regenerative (M2) and their functions are heavily influenced by the injury environment. It's believed that dividing labor among different subpopulations of monocytes and macrophages could optimize regenerative functions over inflammatory ones. However, the delicate balance between necessary inflammatory and regenerative functions of myeloid cells is not yet fully understood. This talk will examine distinct populations of monocytes and macrophages, their role in various injury environments, and smart biomaterial design strategies that harness the innate inflammatory response to improve healing.\n\nBiography\n\nEdward Botchwey received a B.S. degree in Mathematics from the University of Maryland at College Park in 1993 and both M.E. and Ph.D. degrees in Materials Science Engineering and Bioengineering from the University of Pennsylvania in 1998 and 2002, respectively.

In this presentation, I will address two examples: i) the role of microfluidic platforms in genome engineering and temporal cell analysis, and ii) the use of microsystems for in-situ electron microscopy characterization of low dimensional materials. In cellular engineering, a critical step is the intracellular delivery of gene editing machinery and subsequent nondestructive, temporal analysis of cells. Both can be achieved by cell membrane permeabilization, as part of workflows employed in the investigation of molecular mechanisms of disease, pharmacological screening, and development of new therapeutics. Specifically, I will discuss several microfluidic platforms created in my lab, ranging from a fully automated nanofountain probe electroporation (NFP-E) system, which provides single- cell manipulation with superior cell viability and efficiency, and a live cell analysis device (LCAD) for nondestructive and temporal cellular analysis. A critical aspect of the technology is the possibility of perturbing cell state and downstream pathways. I will present single cell RNA sequencing data analysis to show that microfluidic technology leads to significantly reduced cell stress response and much higher control of molecular payload when compared to standard delivery methods. In a second example, I will discuss microsystems to investigate size scale effects on the mechanics of 1D and 2D materials. These materials are being employed in the development of next- generation electronics, optical, and sensor technologies, as well as in energy production and storage techniques, e.g., supercapacitors, solar cells, and battery electrodes. Such applications involve frequent mechanical deformations such as stretching and bending, so the lifespan (integrity and reliability) of the material is a critical feature. In this context, I will present in situ electron microscopy experiments and atomistic models we have used to understand deformation and failure modes in metallic nanowires and transition metal dichalcogenides. Implications on the development of atomistic models with predictive capabilities, in the spirit of the materials genome initiative, will be highlighted.\n\nBiography\n\nHoracio D.

However, effective cytokine therapy is limited by a short half-life in circulation and the severe adverse effects associated with high systemic exposure. To overcome these limitations, we developed a cytokine delivery platform composed of polymer encapsulated epithelial cells that produce natural cytokines. Local administration of these cytokine factories demonstrated predictable dose modulation and provided effective cancer immunotherapy in multiple preclinical models without systemic toxicities. These preclinical models include ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, melanoma, and colorectal cancer. Interestingly, we found that the local concentration (IP space) was greater than 100x higher than the systemic concentration (blood), demonstrating the ability of the platform to deliver cell- generated cytokines in vivo and create a high local concentration of cytokines with limited peripheral exposure. Further, we have demonstrated the ability to readminister these cytokine factories as well as engineer them with a safety switch which provides flexibility with dosing and administration in the clinic. Our data confirmed local increases in the activation (CD25+CD8+) and proliferation (Ki67+CD8+) of cytotoxic T cells within the IP space of cytokine factory treated mice. Significantly, this platform also produced local and systemic T cell biomarker profiles that predict efficacy without toxicity in non-human primates. Overall, our findings demonstrate the safety and efficacy of cytokine factories in preclinical animal models and have been translated into clinical testing for the treatment of ovarian cancer in humans.\n\nSpecial Seminar\n\nTuesday, November 29 | 3:00 pm\n\nMichael R.

Lawrence Wilson Professor and Department Chair of Biomedical Engineering\n\nVanderbilt University\n\n“The shear force is all around us: Mechanotransduction of cancer and immune cells in fluid flow”\n\nAbstract: Many types of cancer metastasize via the bloodstream, where circulating tumor cells (CTCs) originating from the primary tumor can travel through the circulation or lymphatic system and engraft in distant organs. Previously our laboratory found that cancer cells exposed to physiological levels of fluid shear stress (FSS) are dramatically more susceptible to undergoing apoptosis via TRAIL protein, inspiring a new therapeutic drug delivery approach to target metastatic cells in the circulation. The FSS response of CTCs and their neutralization by lipid nanoparticle conjugation to the surface of circulating immune cells has been demonstrated with in vitro cell line experiments, orthotopic mouse models of metastasis, and analysis of primary CTC aggregates isolated from metastatic cancer patients. We later learned that this shear stress is primarily mediated by Piezo1 activation, and is modulated by interacting with aggregated stromal cells such as cancer-associated fibroblasts. Interestingly, we recently found that FSS activation of Piezo1 also dramatically enhances the activation of T cells and dendritic cells, which may have important implications for various immunotherapy applications.\n\nSpecial Seminar\n\nThursday, December 01 | 3:00 pm\n\nCynthia A.

To move, cells must utilize ATP to fuel the the cellular contractility and forces that sustain migration, however very little is known about how the metabolic state of a cell affects its ability to migrate and vice versa. In this talk, I will describe my lab’s efforts to understand the forces driving cell movements in the tumor microenvironment and the energy required for movement. Combining tissue engineering approaches, mouse models, and patient samples, we create and validate in vitro systems to understand how cells navigate the tumor stroma environment with the goal of identifying novel targets of cancer metastasis. Microfabrication and native biomaterials are used to build mimics of the paths created and taken by cells during metastasis. Using these platforms, we have described a role for a balance between cellular energetics, cell and matrix stiffness, and confinement in determining migration behavior. Moreover, we have extended this work into investigating the intersection of the diabetes and the diabetic tissue microenvironment with tumor progression, showing that mechanical changes in the tissue due to diabetes can promote cancer. Overall, our work has demonstrated key mechanical drivers of metastasis within the tissue microenvironment.\n\nTuesday, November 08 | 4:00 pm\n\nKristi Kiick, Ph.D.\n\nProfessor and Chair,\n\nDepartment of Biomedical Engineering\n\nBlue and Gold Distinguished Professor\n\nDepartment of Materials Science and Engineering\n\nUniversity of Delaware\n\n“Engineering bioelastomers for applications in treating human disease”\n\nAbstract: Among many types of biomaterials, micro- and nano-scale structures offer important approaches for mediating biological events, in large part because of their ability to effectively target specific tissues and cells.

With micron scale spatial resolution and subnanometer sensitivity to vibration it is well suited to measuring the spatially resolved vibratory response of both the inner and middle ear. In small animals, it is possible to image directly through the bone of the otic capsule for noninvasive spatially resolved vibrometry of the cochlear partition. In humans as well as small animals, it’s possible to image the tympanic membrane and ossicles through the ear canal to reveal the vibratory response of the middle ear. Nominally, this approach allows for the measure of vibratory response along the light path of the instrument, hence 1-D. In recent work we have developed a system that incorporates 3 separate sample arms in a single interferometer. This allows us to reconstruct the full 3-D vector of motion. We have also begun translating OCTV for use in humans with the development of hand-held devices which can be used in the clinic. The seminar will be split between these two projects, outlining the technical design and discussing recent results for each.\n\nBiography\n\nDr. Applegate is a Professor of Otolaryngology–Head & Neck Surgery and Biomedical Engineering at the University of Southern California.

This is typically required for understanding human biology because of the strong constraints on measurements and perturbations in human in vivo contexts. Direct translation of observations from experimental animals to human subjects is generally unsatisfactory because of significant differences among organisms at all levels of molecular properties from genome to transcriptome to proteome and so forth. Accordingly, addressing inter-species translation requires an integrated experimental/computational approach for mapping comparable but not identical molecule-to-phenotype relationships. This presentation will describe methods we have developed for a variety of cross-species translation examples, demonstrated on applications in inflammatory and neurological pathologies.\n\nBiography\n\nDouglas Lauffenburger is Ford Professor of Bioengineering in the Departments of Biological Engineering, Chemical Engineering, and Biology at MIT.
