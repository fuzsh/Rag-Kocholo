Cotton shipments were on the accustomed small scale of recent months, totaling 75,236 bales valued at $4,716,000 compared with 71,539 bales worth $4,389,000 in May and 133,530 bales valued at $8,189,000' in June, 1940. On the other hand, meat shipments rose to $9,184,000 from $925,000 last year; dairy products to $7,827,000 from $993,000 and lard to $1,793,000 from $719,000. Wheat flour exports increased to $2,483,000 from $1,086,000 in June, 1940, but wheat grain decreased to only $90,000 from $450,000. Corn shipments declined to $218,000 from $2,728,000 in June, 1940. Sugar dropped to $416,000 from $2,682,000. In the import category, wool showed the most marked rise, receipts in June amounting to $20,564,000 as in compared with $4,534,000 in June, 1940. Silk also arrived in greater quantities, receipts of this now almost unobtainable item aggregating $10,233,000 compared with $6,228,000 in June last year, Included among other items arriving here in considerably increased amounts were non-ferrous metals, cocoa, crude rubber, industrial chemicals, bides, skins, and furs. There were also some items which were imported in June in smaller quantity than in June, 1940, including whiskey, wines, cheese, vegetable oils and diamonds. Gold imports in June amounted to $30,719,000 and were the smallest of any month since February, 1938. They compare with $34,835,000 in May and $1,164,224,000 in June, 1940. Exports of gold were only a slightly offsetting factor in any of these periods. Silver imports in June totaled $4,099,000 compared with $3,347,000 in May and $4,673,000 in June, 1940. Exports of silver amounted to $210,000 in June, $615,000 in May and $884,000 in June last year, THE foreignscale inofJune Unitedin the preceding trade the than States was on a smaller merchandise. both the inflow and outflow Exports also were below June, 32% increase as compared with that month.

Imports in the month totaled $279,536,000 compared with $296,930,000 in May and $211,425,000 in June, last year. The reduced shipments abroad occurred in face of reported larger forwardings under the 1940, but imports showed a Lend-Lease Act. have been due to But the increase would seem to larger food shipments rather than munitions of war, for the former category in the totals several items in showed marked gains over both May and June, 1940, while many were munitions articles shipped in smaller quantities.

The market was simply neglected by the vast numbers of investors and the coteries of speculators and traders. Observers on all sides noted that inquiries were frequent and numerous, but seldom resulted in decisions to buy or sell. The tendency quite obviously was to await a definite turn in the market, or perhaps some outstanding event in national or international affairs which might afford a clue to the persistent query as to where the world may end up. In so far as the stock market was concerned, answers to that question patently were lacking and even convictions on the subject were scarce. One result of the slack trading was a sale of a seat on the New York Stock Exchange, Wednesday, at $28,000, a decline of $7,000 from the last previous sale. Stocks as a whole advanced by small fractions in session and lost their gains in the next.

These incidents tended to overshadow the desultory fighting in the Mediterranean, where a few airplane raids and submarine forays made up the bulk of activities.
