        "text": "Page 1 of 1\n\nThis the Lotus 18 as raced in 1959, 1960 and 1960. The 18 was the first midengined Lotus but it was still a chunky car. The 18 was built around a spaceframe that was less complex than that of the Lotus 16, but weighing only a little over 27kg (the fiberglass body added little weight). It was driven in F1 and F2 with a lot of succes. In 1960 Stirling Moss scored Lotus' first Grand Prix victory. Team Lotus was runner up in the Constructors' Championship 1960 to Cooper and in 1961 to Ferrari. It was built in great numbers; no fewer than 125 18s were built in 1960. This was a milestone car for Lotus and a sign of what was to come from Team Lotus.\n\nPage 1 of 1"
