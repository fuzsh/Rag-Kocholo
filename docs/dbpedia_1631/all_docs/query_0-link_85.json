This #8 Lotus 25 is a highly accurate scale model of that fabulous car. This brand new, limited edition model has cockpit, suspension, gearbox and engine detail visible through the covering mesh. This is a ‘kerbside’ model so no bodywork is removable. The model is mounted on a black leatherette base with a plaque detailing the model and comes with a perspex display cover and black outer box. This model is brand new in its original packaging - never opened.",
