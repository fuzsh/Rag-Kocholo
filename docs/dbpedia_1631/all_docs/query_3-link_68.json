To help you winnow down that shortlist, here are some useful tips:\n\nThink about nicknames. Before deciding on a name, run through all the possible shortenings and nicknames people might use and see how happy you are with them. Do you still like the name?\n\nLook at the initials. Think about your baby's surname (and middle name if you've chosen one) and write down the initials of the combinations you're considering.\n\nPronunciations and spellings. Some flower names are relatively common but some on our list are not so well known and/or are not the easiest to spell or pronounce. If your name choice is one of these, will you be OK with you – and later on, your child – having to hear people say or spell it wrong and then correcting them?\n\nConsider the meanings. Most of the names on our list simply mean the flower they're named after but some have additional meanings such as wolf-like, star or sea nymph. If the name you like is simply named after a flower, look that flower up, if you don't know it already and check you like how it looks; if your name has an additional meaning, make sure you're happy with this being associated with your child.\n\n57.

Yarrow\n\nOrigin: English\n\nMeaning: after the flower; rough stream\n\n61. Zinnia\n\nOrigin: Latin\n\nMeaning: after the flower\n\nWhite flower names for girls\n\nWhite flower girl baby names are fresh, elegant – and a little bit special. There's something about the serene simplicity of white flowers that sets them apart from the rest of the blossomy crowd. All of the beautiful white flower names that we've picked out here are named after flowers renowned for their delicate fragrance, their statuesque lines, their healing properties or their intricate, detailed petals.\n\n62.
