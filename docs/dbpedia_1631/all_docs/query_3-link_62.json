        "text": "If someone were to ask you about your star sign or birthstone, you’d probably know yours. But do you know the flower for your birth month? Along with birthstones, there are flowers for every month of the year. These are typically in bloom during their specific month, making birth flowers easy to find.\n\nBirth month flowers date back to ancient Rome, around the same time birthday celebrations began. During these early celebrations, people would decorate the altars of Roman gods with flowers and present their loved ones with flowers as gifts. Flowers took on their unique meanings around the 18th century in England.\n\nJust like birthstones and zodiac signs, birth flowers are unique and highlight all our wonderful differences. Show your loved ones how much you care with our Birth Flower Necklace! These necklaces make the perfect gift – especially for new moms. You can even add a Birthstone Charm to the necklace to personalize it even more!\n\nSHOP BIRTH FLOWER\n\nWhat is my birth flower?\n\nNot sure what your birth flower is? Use this visual chart and table to find out exactly what your birth flower is and what it means. Click on each month to skip ahead and read more about each flower. You can also pin it for later!\n\nMonth Birth Flower Meaning January Snow Drop Admiration, love, hope February Violet Love, faithfulness, youth March Daffodil Rebirth, new beginnings April Daisy Purity, innocence, bliss May Lily of the Valley Sweetness, hope, good luck June Rose Happiness, romance July Lotus Purity, dignity, positivity August Poppy Peace, strength, imagination September Morning Glory Affection, resilience October Cosmos Creativity, passion, peace November Chrysanthemum Joy, honesty, friendship December Holly Berry Hope, wealth, protection\n\nWhat is January’s Birth Flower?\n\nJanuary - Snowdrop\n\nJanuary’s birth flower is the snowdrop, a symbol of hope and new beginnings because they are one of the first flowers of the season to appear. This winter flower blooms from January to March, even if there is still snow on the ground.\n\nThe name snowdrop comes from the Greek words gala, meaning milk, and anthos, meaning flower. It was named as such because of its pure white appearance. They can be gifted to express sympathy and hope.\n\nThese flowers symbolize innocence and purity. In some tales, they are seen as bad luck because they often grow in cemeteries. It is also said that snowdrops were a gift from an angel to Adam and Eve as a sign of hope when they were banished from the Garden of Eden.\n\nPersonality traits attached to the snowdrop include being down-to-earth, genuine, and loyal.\n\nWhat is February’s Birth Flower?\n\nFebruary - Violet\n\nViolets, some of the few flowers to bloom in February, bring out their purple-blue color and heart-shaped leaves just in time for the month of love.\n\nThe heart shape that this plant features led them to be common ingredients in love potions. Violets were also cultivated by the ancient Greeks, who used them to sweeten wine and for medicinal purposes.\n\nIn the Victorian age, gifting a violet was a declaration of loyalty. It was also used as a symbol of modesty when included in paintings. Named for the latin word viola, which refers to the flower’s color, the violet’s beautiful hue matches the amethyst birthstone for February. Both the gem and the flower are symbols of deep love and happiness.\n\nIf your birth flower is Violet, you'll likely have a creative and compassionate spirit, with a vivid imagination to boot.\n\nWhat is March’s Birth Flower?\n\nMarch - Daffodil\n\nMarch’s flower, the cheery daffodil, is the perfect celebration for the coming spring. These bright yellow blooms are a symbol of happiness, good fortune, and new beginnings.\n\nThe Latin name for daffodils is Narcissus, named after the famed Greek figure who became enamored with his own reflection in the water and drowned. The myth states that a daffodil flower then bloomed on that spot.\n\nDaffodils are the national flower of Wales, where legend says that those who see the first daffodil of the season will be blessed with wealth that year. However, it is also believed that gifting a single daffodil will bring misfortune, so be sure to give a whole bouquet! These flowers are a great way to remind a loved one that the sun is always shining wherever they are.\n\nPeople with daffodil as their birth flower tend to bring sunshine into the lives of others. Their personality traits may include being cheerful, energetic, and naturally optimistic.\n\nWhat is April’s Birth Flower?\n\nApril - Daisy\n\nApril’s birth flower is the daisy, which represents purity, innocence, and bliss. This flower can also be a symbol of motherhood. When gifting a bouquet of daisies, choose a color that fits the occasion well!\n\nIn addition to being admired, daisies can be eaten, offering a variety of benefits. They are closely related to artichokes and serve as a great source of Vitamin C. They can also slow bleeding, relieve indigestion, and soothe coughs.\n\nDaisies are said to be one of the oldest flowers on earth, dating back to 3000 BC. Their name comes from the Old English phrase daes eage, which means day’s eye, named as such because they close their petals at night and open with the first light of morning. Daisies bloom at the start of summer and can last throughout the fall. This bright and cheerful flower encourages endless optimism.\n\nIf your birth flower is Daisy, you’re probably a down-to-earth and loyal person with a playful side.\n\nWhat is May’s Birth Flower?\n\nMay - Lily of the Valley\n\nThe lily of the valley is May’s birth flower. Used as a symbol of hope, this plant blooms only for a brief period of time. In Victorian times, it also suggested a “return to happiness.”\n\nMany legends are connected to the lily of the valley. One such tale says that the flower appeared where Eve’s tears landed when she was banished from the Garden of Eden. Another says that the lilies grew wherever the blood of St. Leonard fell when fighting dragons.\n\nTypically, the lily of the valley blooms in May or late spring, giving them a second name of May bells thanks to their bell-shaped flower heads. Your loved ones born in May are often known for their sweet and caring nature, with a touch of humility.\n\nWhat is June’s Birth Flower?\n\nJune - Rose\n\nA timeless classic, the rose is June’s birth flower. These flowers, cherished for their elegant beauty, symbolize love, friendship, and appreciation. Gifting a bouquet of roses shows sincere gratitude, while a single rose’s meaning depends on its color.\n\nRed roses are the perfect way to say “I love you.” Another great choice for a partner is an orange rose, which symbolizes passion and desire. A yellow rose represents friendship and platonic love - the perfect choice for a close friend. Pink roses demonstrate happiness, gratitude, joy, and admiration, while white roses typically mean purity and innocence.\n\nThe variety of meanings that a rose can have make it an exceptional and versatile flower to give to anyone special in your life. Roses symbolize romance, so if you’re born in June, you might have a passionate and graceful approach to life.\n\nWhat is July’s Birth Flower?\n\nJuly - Lotus\n\nThe lotus flower represents those born in July. Symbolizing purity and dignity, these resilient flowers thrive on the surface of the water, whether in a large natural freshwater body or in a small backyard pond. Lotuses demonstrate the hope that something beautiful can grow from suffering, which is why they are also a symbol of positivity.\n\nThese flowers are native to tropical regions of the globe, but can also be found in the UK. In many cultures, they are associated with rebirth and enlightenment. They demonstrate strong will; even in the dirtiest of waters, the lotus plant produces a beautiful flower.\n\nPersonality traits for those with the lotus birth flower include wisdom, high achievement, and resilience.
