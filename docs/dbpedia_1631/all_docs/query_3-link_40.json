This spectacular hydrophyte is an abstract depiction of various religious entities. It is also a subject of untold tales, heavily influenced by different cultures across the planet. Because this knowledge may be limited only to where it is commonly cultivated and traded, we will try to shed light on the legends behind this captivating aquatic flower. Who knows? In the future, this might be a good anecdote to tell when gifting it to a special someone!\n\nWhy Is the Lotus Flower so Special, What Special Powers Does It Have?\n\nLotus flowers are traditionally believed to possess special flowers, especially in oriental religions. However, in science, they are indeed superplants with impressive supernatural and botanical characteristics! Learn about them below!\n\nSpiritual cleansing – Lotus flowers have the habit of surfacing from ponds. This habit has become associated with the soul's nature – despite being tarnished with sins, it's cleansed as it propels itself from the murky waters.\n\nDivine affinity – The supernatural significance of lotus flower is associated with Hinduism and Buddhism. It is considered as a sacred flower and is used to adorn the religion's deity.\n\nThermoregulation – The ability to keep warm in cold climates was thought to be only present in plants. However, it was in Nelumbo nucifera, sacred lotus, where this power was first observed by Australian botanists, making it one of the biggest discoveries in plant physiology.\n\nSeed survival – Most plants – primarily those belonging to the grass family with dry, recalcitrant seeds – have the power to hibernate in the soil for a couple of centuries, but not lotus, a remarkable longevity of its kind! A 1,300-year-old seed unearthed from an ancient Chinese lakebed was successfully revived by a group of American scientists, another feat that enables us to understand the seed physiology.\n\nAnti-aging properties – After successfully sequencing the lotus' genome or the entire DNA script, scientists found that it has rejuvenating properties, able to play-back the aging process. In a separate study, germ extracts obtained from the sprouting seeds of lotus delayed cell aging. This is considered a promising discovery that helps scientists understand healthy aging.\n\nLotus Flower Meaning and Symbolism in Different Cultures\n\nWhat is the meaning of a lotus flower? Behind its splendid floral structure is a definition that many are unaware of, mainly influenced by the set of anthropological beliefs distinct from country to country. To know about its cultural essence, we have summarized it below:\n\nAcross Different Religions\n\nThe meaning of the lotus flower has been shaped by diverse cultural perspectives to which the blossom is part of the autochthonous landscape. Find out how they vary!\n\nBuddhism\n\nIt is not surprising that the Asian lotus, Nelumbo nucifera, is tied to Buddhist doctrine, for it is where the species originated in South and East Asia. In Buddhism, this charming blossom is a consecrated object, embodying spiritual awakening and enlightenment, a joint between the man’s soul and the universe.\n\nHinduism\n\nThe ethereal flower is also a sanctified object in Hinduism. Like Buddhism, the lotus blossom meaning in this religious belief is enlaced with spiritual awakening and enlightenment, a character of Sanskrit. In fact, yoga incorporates the lotus position, padmasana, a vital pose to meditate and progress towards enlightenment. If you happen to visit a Hindu temple, expect to witness holy figures embellished with lotus flowers on its pedestal.\n\nChristianity\n\nThe lotus flower significance in Christianity is often analogized to the teachings of Jesus, the religious leaders revered in this doctrine. As the lotus flower shoots up to display its flower, it represents the resurrection of Jesus. Moreover, coming from mud-splattered waters, analogous to the sins, the freshly emerged flowers – white, unspeckled, and innocent – embody rebirth and purification.\n\nCatholic\n\nThe Catholic doctrine mainly revolves around God, the Holy Spirit, and Jesus. Saints, who were previously mortals and now share a space with God, are also worshiped. Saint Thomas, the apostle, ’s arrival in India is often associated with the lotus flower. Another indirect association with the lotus flower is the parable of life – despite growing in mucky marshes, flowers, representing life, can still bloom, and life around it happens to thrive despite adversities – a reminder that God is always with man, guiding through their obstacles.\n\nHebrew\n\nIn Hebrew, there is no special mention of the striking marsh flower in the holy scriptures. However, they typically carry a spiritual significance like other religions, centralizing in purity, enlightenment, and rebirth. It also aligns with the themes found in Jewish religion and mysticism.\n\nIn Various Countries\n\nLotus meaning is culturally fluid due to set geographical boundaries. Heading to Japan, its interpretation is distinct as opposed to the middle east, particularly ancient Egypt. Know more about this below!\n\nJapan\n\nIf you have been in a Japanese-themed garden, temples, and shrines, there is a good chance that you will stumble upon lotus flowers. Locally known as hasu, lotus depicts purity and enlightenment, a characteristic of Buddhism, one of the major religions in the country. So when planning to visit Japan, visit the lotus garden, too, aside from the cherry blossoms!\n\nIndia\n\nDominated by Hindus in a large part of its population, India's interpretation of the lotus flowers meaning is strongly tied to the principal religion. In fact, this quintessential hydric plant is celebrated as a national flower. It is believed that a lotus flower is ever present in each person's heart, which is seen as spiritual enlightenment, purity, beauty, prosperity, and eternity.\n\nChina\n\nThe lotus culture in China runs the economy, especially tourism. Well, you can't blame the Chinese, as evidence shows that the first lotus seeds sprouted in the country's wetlands! In the eyes of Chinese people, the elite flower exhibits admirable moral character, including honesty, beauty, goodness, and purity.\n\nAncient Egypt\n\nThe primeval Egyptian's depiction of lotus-lily does not differ that much from the other eastern countries. Ancient people of Egypt hail the lotus plant as an epitome of rebirth and rejuvenation, which reflects on their observation of how the flower behaves day and night on the water – sinking and reappearing.\n\nLotus Flower Symbolism and Meaning by Color\n\nPutting colors as the point of perspective to answer, what does lotus flower symbolize, is worth learning! This is also attributed to various cultural focal points listed below:\n\nWhite\n\nWhite lotus is an embodiment of soul and mental purity. As it peeks through the shallow pond waters, it symbolizes Bodhi, or awakening, in Hinduism. On the other hand, Saraswati, a Hindu goddess, is portrayed as a pure white lotus. The significance of the lotus flower also has a femme connotation – a personification of the world’s womb.\n\nPink\n\nPink is the most common color of lotus and is primarily tied up with femininity in many cultures. Like the tip of a pink lotus flower, which is delicate and fragile, Hinduism considers the toned down aspects of the petal to embody feminal energy. To add, the symbolism of lotus flower is tied to Budda’s earthly being.\n\nRed\n\nFierce, fiery, intense – these are the intangible characters that a red lotus flower represents, similar to the burning affection and love for someone. In Buddhism, flaming empathy or compassion is represented by Padma, one of the distinct Buddha families.\n\nYellow\n\nA Lotus flower with yellow petals radiates a beaming positivity and entails one's attitude of being open, hospitable, and kind to someone. The interpretation of different cultures and religions also makes yellow lotus somewhat conflicting. However, they always reflect hope, joy, strength, and courage.\n\nPurple\n\nPurple lotus lilies are quite rare, but they don't lack any spiritual implication. Often referenced to Buddha, the violet lotus flower symbol touches upon the personal equilibrium and profound reflection of oneself.\n\nBlack\n\nThe black lotus flower meaning, spiritually, has to do with the internal growth of the mind and soul. Being such a potent color, it also transmits the feeling of power, transformation, resilience and perseverance.\n\nWhat Is the Legend of the Lotus Flower?\n\nBefore the Egyptians laid the first stone to the pyramids, lotus flowers are keenly connected to their religion. They are the symbol of the sun, reminiscent of the flowers’ habit of ascending during the daytime and setting into the muddy waters at nightfall. Legend has it that a massive lotus inflorescence grew out from a pond and from it, where the sun rose like a symbolic flower.\n\nAside from this interesting anecdote, the lotus flower has been widely represented in Egyptian art.
