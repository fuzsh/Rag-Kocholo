        "text": "Use and Management\n\nLotus plants are extremely aggressive and should be planted into containers in the water garden to keep them from escaping and permanently rooting into the soil beneath the water. Once they become established in the soil, they are difficult to get rid of. Containerizing plants is a good way to enjoy lotus without the danger of them becoming invasive in the pond or lake.\n\nLotus should be planted in a container filled with garden soil or potting mix. A shallow and wide container is better than a tall, narrow container. The garden soil can be mixed with one-fifth well-decomposed cow manure. Incorporate fertilizer at an equivalent rate of about one-quarter cup 10-10-10 per gallon of soil or media to help stimulate growth. Before filling the container, place a small plastic bag filled with sand at the bottom to keep it from floating in the pond. Plant the rhizome at the edge of the container so it can grow horizontally across the top. Place a 1 or 2 inch layer of sand or gravel over the top of the media after the rhizome is planted in the pot to keep media and soil in the container. Lower the container into 6 inches of water until growth begins. Then it can be set so the bottom of the container is no more than 18 inches below the water surface. If the water is too deep, place a brick or concrete block under the container. Do not construct containers from treated lumber since growth could be severely inhibited.\n\nSmall cultivars are better suited for a smaller garden and could include 'Momo Boton' with rose-colored flowers and smaller leaves than the species. The native lotus, Nelumbo lutea has light yellow flowers and is hardy into USDA hardiness zone 4."
