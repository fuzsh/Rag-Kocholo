        "text": "Lotus flowers have a long, rich history spanning thousands of years. The Lotus symbolizes beauty, purity, and knowledge. The lotus is revered by several religions for its symbolism of beauty and growth.\n\nThe lotus is a perennial plant with bowl-shaped flowers that have petals with an 8 to 12 inch diameter. It is an aquatic plant that thrives in nutrient-rich, murky conditions. It comes in shades of pink hues, yellow or white. The white lotus is the most common type of lotus. It is native to Africa, Asia, and Australia, and the pink Lotus is native to Asia. The yellow lotus is the only lotus native to North America.\n\nLotuses plants root themselves in the mud, with their lengthy stems reaching upward to find the top of the water. The lotus prefers to grow in 12-18 inches of water. As the lotus begins to bloom its pedals start to unfold one by one. Lotus plants prefer warm weather and will start to grow once the water temperature has risen above 70 degrees.\n\nLotus flowers last up to 5 days and typically bloom between the months of June through August. The reproductive parts are in the middle of the flower. After growing to a mature length, the lotus plant can reproduce asexually or sexually with both male and female reproductive parts. This plant is also heavily pollinated by many insects throughout the day like bees, wasps, beetles and flies.\n\nLotus Life Cycle\n\nThe life cycle of a lotus begins with its seed form. Lotus seeds are darkly colored and small enough to be swept around by the tides. In fact, it is through the movement of water that lotus seeds are dispersed. Seeds land in the mud at the bottom of ponds or similar bodies of water. A seed can remain ungerminated in this state for many years, until the conditions of the environment are suitable for it to begin sprouting.\n\nA sprouted seed is called a seedling. In this form, the lotus will send leaves up and roots down. More and more leaves are produced until they can begin to reach the surface of the water. Once on the surface of the water, the leaves will unroll and grow on top of the water up to 24 inches in circumference. The leaves then will rise up 6 to 8 feet out of the water. At this point, the iconic lotus flower can begin to form. Next the buds will rise up from the base of the plant. They will also rise 6 to 8 feet. These flowers bloom above the water and exist for only the few days it takes for pollination to occur. Lotus flowers produce heat, scent, and nectar to attract their main pollinators – beetles. These beetles drink nectar from the flowers and brush up against the flower’s stigma, collecting and transferring pollen. Some lotuses can self-pollinate by using the wind or water to transfer pollen from one flower to another.\n\nOnce pollinated, flowers can begin to produce seed pods. These pods begin as small green buds, growing and turning brown as they mature. Eventually, they split open to release hundreds of seeds. Most of these seeds will be eaten by other aquatic organisms, but some will survive to begin the cycle all over again.\n\nThere are two main types of lotuses – tropical and perennial. Tropical lotuses do best in warmer climates and tend to produce larger floating leaves, while perennial, or marsh, plants are native to more temperate climates and tend to produce slightly smaller, emergent leaves. The stem of lotus is called rhizomes, which serve as anchoring and food storage organs. All parts of the plant are edible. In many cultures when the plant loses its leaves, the rhizomes are harvested for food.\n\nHydrophobic leaves\n\nObjects are hydrophobic when they tend to repel water. For instance, waxy coatings keep water from soaking into certain boats. Lotus leaves take this a step further, with something called the “lotus effect” or superhydrophobicity. If you look at a lotus leaf underneath a microscope, you will see that it actually has a rough surface of micro and nano structures. This roughness, combined with the leaf’s wax coating, means that water has very little to hold on to. If water touches a lotus leaf, it balls up to reduce contact with the surface. Submerged leaves have a silvery sheen – this is layer of air that serves as a boundary between the leaf and the surrounding water.\n\nCurrently, the lotus effect is inspiration for scientific innovation. For lotuses, an aquatic plant, having constant contact with water that rolls off is useful. When droplets of water roll off, they bring dirt and mud with them. This means that the lotus is self-cleaning, which makes it easier to perform photosynthesis. The structure of the lotus leaf can be replicated to create spill-proof lab coats for people working with dangerous chemicals. There could be any number of uses for such a quality, from waterproof phones to safer airplane travel.\n\nLotus Varieites\n\nSacred Lotus\n\nNelumbo nucifera, known as The Sacred lotus, the most prolific lotus at Kenilworth Aquatic Gardens. This variety of lotus stands very tall with broad green leaves and bright pink flowers. The Sacred lotus is native to many countries in Asia. It is an important symbol to many cultures and religions in the region. It is also entirely edible and many parts are used in recipes for significant festivals.\n\nThe lotus roots are planted in pond or river bottom soil, while the leaves float on the water's surface or are held well above it. The leaf stalks (petioles) can be up to 6 ft 7 in long, allowing the plant to grow in water to that depth, The peltate leaf blade or lamina can have a horizontal spread of 3 ft 3 in. The leaves may be as large as 31 in in diameter. The flowers are usually found on thick stems rising several centimeters above the leaves. They are showy and grow up to 12 in in diameter.\n\nManchurian Lotus\n\nDr. Ichiro Ohga, a Japanese Botanist, discovered Manchurian lotus seeds in a dried lakebed in Leoning province, China in 1919. Dr. Ohga brought the seeds to the United States. In March 1952, Kenilworth Aquatic Gardens’ Plant Pathologist Horace V Wester got the seeds to sprout in our hot houses. The seeds were up to 1,000 years old. The Manchurian Lotus are the oldest seeds to ever germinate successfully and are grown here today.\n\nThe leaves are a light green. The flower has soft pink petals with a bright yellow center. The Manchurian lotus is one of the first to bloom at Kenilworth Aquatic Gardens. The buds will begin to form in mid-June. The Manchurian lotus can be found in the concrete display pond behind the visitors center.\n\nAmerican lotus\n\nNelumbo Lutea, known as American lotus, is the only variety of lotus that is native to the Americas. Its leaves are smaller and deeper green then other lotuses in the garden. The flowers are a delicate yellow, with the seedpods beginning as yellow inside. The American lotus is native to areas as far north as New York and as far south as Columbia and the Caribbean. Indigenous communities in the Americas use American lotus as a food source and a means of trade. At Kenilworth Aquatic Gardens, these lotuses can also be found in the marsh and at the back of the dead-end near the boardwalk entrance.\n\nCharles Thomas lotus\n\nNelumbo 'Charles Thomas’ is an excellent medium to large cultivar with medium pink blooms that change to a slightly translucent lavender pink.\n\nThey are found at the shallow margins or on the muddy banks of pools. They are widely grown and naturalized in subtropic and tropical areas. The horizontal peltate, waxy bloomed, almost circular leaves are held well above the water. It produces flat or concave-circular, wavy edged, glaucous, pale green leaves, 32″ across. In summer it bears peony-like sometimes double, lavender pink flowers, to 6-8″ across and develop distinctive, flat-topped seed pods. These lotus can be found near the bridge over the ponds.\n\nDouble Rose lotus\n\nA flowering, aquatic plant with beautiful, fragrant flowers and 2 feet wide, round leaves, held 3 to 6 feet above the water surface. The lotus flower is usually pink but can be white or a deep rose color, 4 to 10 inches in diameter, with a single flower per stem. The fruit is woody and ornamental, good for crafts. The seeds and tubers are used in Chinese cooking. These lotuses can be found on the deadend by the boardwalk. They are the second pond from the back, between the American Lotus and the Empress Lotus.\n\nMrs. Perry D. Slocum Lotus\n\nMrs. Perry D. Slocum is a fragrant lotus with large double blossoms that open deep pink, change to pink and yellow the second day and creamy yellow on the third day. Free flowering on large mature plants, producing several flowers at the same time. A beautiful tribute from Dr. Perry D. Slocum, to his wife. These large flowers often tilt and droop under their own weight. This lotus can be found in a small pond along the back of the path.\n\nEmpress Lotus\n\nThe “Empress” or Alba Striata are beautiful Lotus plants. They are a whitish bloom with gentle strokes of pinkish colors on the edges of the petals. These plants can grow up to five feet tall in perfect conditions. The empress lotus flower bursts into a wide white rose-shaped blossom when in full bloom. These can be found in at the deadend by the boardwalk next to the double rose lotus.\n\nPainted Cloud lotus\n\nThe painted cloud lotus is much smaller than the other lotuses in the garden. The seed pods are very different, with the seeds almost extruding out of the flower. The flower begins tight, exposing its beautiful pink and white stripes. The flower stands much taller than the small leaves.\n\nHigh Cotton lotus\n\nHigh Cotton' lotus, or Shiroman, produces enormous large white double flowers with a ruffled look on the outer petals, inner petals curl up around the golden stamens on a yellow-green receptacle making this large lotus unique. This lotus can be found in a small pond after the bridge."
