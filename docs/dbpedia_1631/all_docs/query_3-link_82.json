        "text": "In This Article\n\nOrigin, Meaning, And History Of Lotus\n\nThe name Lotus, derived from the lotus flower, is traced back to the Greek word lotos, referring to both the ‘lotus flower’ and the ‘mythological lotus tree.’ In Greek and Roman mythology, the lotus tree was known to produce a fruit that induced sleepiness and forgetfulness, adding a mystical and legendary aspect to this feminine name.\n\nIn Eastern religions, the lotus flower holds significant spiritual symbolism. In Hinduism and Buddhism, Lotus represents the path to spiritual awakening and enlightenment, symbolizing purity, beauty, and the unfolding of spiritual potential. This association imbues the name with a sense of spiritual depth and transcendence. It is also widely visible in Hindu religious iconography. In Christianity, the lotus flower is associated with the apostle Thomas and his journey to India, and it is also mentioned in the Bible, adding another layer to its religious significance.\n\nReaders might be familiar with this baby title within the music industry. Lotus is the title of the seventh studio album by American singer-songwriter Christina Aguilera, released in 2012. In literature, The Blue Lotus is the fifth volume of The Adventures of Tintin by Belgian cartoonist Hergé, adding a touch of literary and artistic dimension to this name.\n\nLotus has also been used as a personal name, although rarely. Lotus Long was a pioneering Asian-American actress who paved the way for future Asian-American actresses in Hollywood. She is best known for her role as Tokyo Rose in the 1946 film Tokyo Rose. The name is also associated with Flying Lotus, which is the stage name of rapper, DJ, and record producer Steven D. Bingley-Ellison.\n\nEven though Lotus has not been widely used as a first name, it is an astute choice, rich with cultural connotations. It is a symbol of wisdom, enlightenment, and spirituality, yet because of its short and simple sound, is known for its air of modernity. If you are considering an unconventional floral name for your baby girl, Lotus may be the right choice.\n\nHow To Pronounce Lotus?\n\n‘Lotus’ In QR Code\n\nLotus On The Popularity Chart\n\nSocietal influences, family traditions, latest trends, and timeless appeal are a few criteria that shape the choices of parents in naming their newest family members.

However, in popular culture, it is often narrowed down to the sun sign, which depends on the person’s birth date.There are 12 zodiac signs, each having dominant traits, planetary rulers, elemental connection, and more.\n\nZodiac sign or Sun sign\n\nThe Earth’s orbit around the sun is divided into 12 zodiac signs covering 30-degree sectors. According to Western astrology, the zodiac or sun sign depends on the sun’s position in one of these sectors at the time of your birth. Starting from the sun’s position at the March equinox, the chart goes anti-clockwise from Aries, followed by Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces. These signs are ruled by planetary bodies - Mars, Venus, Mercury, Moon, Sun, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Furthermore, they are categorized into triplicities or elemental signs - fire, water, air, and earth - that govern their characteristics. Each of these zodiac signs features certain personality traits that may determine how a person presents themselves.\n\nEach zodiac sign in Western astrology is linked to a specific range of dates in the year.
