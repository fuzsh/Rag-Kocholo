        "text": "One day, not too far in the future, the Dodge Challenger will go away. The slow and dreadful march of time will smite this automotive dinosaur just as it did the Tyrannosaurs that serve as the Challenger’s 65-million-year-old spirit animal.\n\nBut befitting a car that’s gone on for nearly 15 years, the Challenger line as we know it today is large and expansive, making a great deal of hay from just four engines and a single body style. With prices starting at $32,000 and nearly tripling for the most powerful Hellcat engine, only half-ton pickup trucks exist along such a huge price delta. Here’s how the Challenger line shakes out in 2022.\n\nDodge Challenger SXT\n\nSpecs: 303 Horsepower / 268 Pound-Feet\n\nBase Price: $32,025\n\nThe Challenger SXT serves as the foundation for the range and while its 3.6-liter V6 packs a restrained 303 horsepower and 268 pound-feet of torque, the other part of the Challenger equation – style – is here in spades. You’ll find the same LED running lights as the more powerful models and available 20-inch wheels, plus a loud and joyful color palette mean the base Challenger looks the part.\n\nThere’s a whole range of option packages to better kit the SXT out, but it’s solidly equipped to start, with a 7.0-inch touchscreen, houndstooth cloth seats, and leather-wrapped steering wheel. All-wheel drive is available as an option. The Challenger SXT demands at least $32,420, including a $1,595 destination charge.\n\nDodge Challenger GT\n\nSpecs: 303 Horsepower / 268 Pound-Feet\n\nBase Price: $35,395\n\nThe Challenger GT started life as the all-wheel-drive entry in the lineup, but a little drivetrain swaparoo means you can get this model with either rear- or all-wheel drive now, just like the SXT. Think of the current Challenger GT as an SXT with its own character and equipment, including a wider range of optional extras, such as Nappa/Alcantara upholstery and a Harmon Kardon audio system. The GT moves up to standard 20-inch wheels and boasts meatier brakes and a trim-specific suspension. Prices start at $35,395.\n\nDodge Challenger R/T\n\nSpecs: 372 Horsepower / 400 Pound-Feet\n\nBase Price: $40,670\n\nIt’s V8 time. The Challenger R/T line ditches the V6 engine and standard eight-speed automatic (and, sadly, the option of all-wheel drive) in exchange for a 5.7-liter Hemi V8 and a six-speed manual. Output shoots up to 372 hp and 400 lb-ft, while the price climbs to $40,670. The interesting thing isn’t what the base R/T brings to the table, though. It’s the option packages, which are so expansive we consider them separate trims.\n\nDodge Challenger R/T Shaker\n\nSpecs: 372 Horsepower / 400 Pound-Feet\n\nBase Price: $42,870\n\nUnrepentantly old school, the Challenger R/T’s Shaker package cuts a big-ass hole in the hood and sticks a bit of the engine through. It’s awesome. In addition to the Mopar-sourced Shaker intake, this trim adds black accents around the exterior and white faces to the physical gauges. A classic “Challenger” hood script also appears in the grille, just for that added dose of old-school flair. Prices for the Challenger R/T Shaker start at $42,870.\n\nDodge Challenger R/T T/A\n\nSpecs: 372 Horsepower / 400 Pound-Feet\n\nBase Price: $44,270\n\nThe Challenger R/T T/A has a more purposeful style than the bombastic Shaker, swapping in a matte-black hood, roof, rear spoiler, T/A-specific 20-inch wheels, and unique body-side decals. On the functional front, Air Catcher headlights – just like what you get on a Hellcat – feed a Mopar-sourced cold-air intake. The T/A is slightly pricier than the Shaker at $44,270, but it brings even more style to an already stylish package.\n\nDodge Challenger R/T Scat Pack\n\nSpecs: 485 Horsepower / 475 Pound-Feet\n\nBase Price: $47,650\n\nThere’s the R/T and then there’s the R/T Scat Pack. This option swaps out the 5.7-liter V8 for a 6.4-liter, increasing output to 485 ponies and 475 lb-ft. Like the 5.7-liter R/T, rear-wheel drive is the only way to fly, while owners can choose between the standard six-speed stick or the optional eight-speed automatic. You’ll also find an Alpine-branded six-speaker audio system and an 8.4-inch touchscreen standard. The one big disappointment to the R/T Scat Pack is that it qualifies for a federal gas guzzler charge – the $47,650 price tag includes a $1,000 line item for being so darn thirsty.\n\nDodge Challenger R/T Scat Pack Shaker\n\nSpecs: 485 Horsepower / 475 Pound-Feet\n\nBase Price: $50,245\n\nNot much changes with the Shaker when paired with the Scat Pack. There’s a unique Bumblebee fender badge, which harkens back to the Superbee, and the Shaker hood scoop now wears a “392” badge, but that’s about it. Prices start at $50,245.\n\nDodge Challenger R/T Scat Pack 1320\n\nSpecs: 485 Horsepower / 475 Pound-Feet\n\nBase Price: $52,240\n\nThe Challenger R/T Scat Pack 1320 takes lessons learned with the supremely exclusive Challenger SRT Demon and applies them to a naturally aspirated package. Five-spoke, 20-inch wheels shod in drag radials, drag-ready suspension tuning with adaptive dampers, and Air Catcher headlights set the 1320 up for dominance at the drag strip. Extreme owners can even ask Dodge to delete the passenger seat and the rear bench. The 1320 starts at $52,240, which is a fine deal considering the lack of purpose-built drag cars on the market.\n\nDodge Challenger R/T Scat Pack T/A\n\nSpecs: 485 Horsepower / 475 Pound-Feet\n\nBase Price: $52,240\n\nDodge’s only significant change to the T/A for the 6.4-liter Challenger is a new performance seat with houndstooth upholstery and “performance” all-season tires. Beyond that swaperoo, the black hood, roof, and rear spoiler remain. Prices match the 1320 at $52,240.\n\nDodge Challenger R/T Scat Pack Widebody\n\nSpecs: 485 Horsepower / 475 Pound-Feet\n\nBase Price: $53,645\n\nAfter its introduction on the SRT Demon, Dodge’s wide-body treatment has trickled down the line to the 6.4-liter Scat Pack cars. The equation is broadly the same, though: swollen wheel arches hiding 305/35/20 tires at all four corners and a “competition” suspension to take advantage of the larger contact patch. The R/T Scat Pack Widebody also adds adaptive dampers, unique 20-inch wheels, and Brembo six-piston brakes.\n\nDodge Challenger R/T Scat Pack Shaker Widebody\n\nSpecs: 485 Horsepower / 475 Pound-Feet\n\nBase Price: $56,240\n\nAgain, Dodge doesn’t really change what works. You’ll find the same old-school Shaker hood, along with other aesthetic tweaks. For what it’s worth, the R/T Scat Pack Shaker Widebody has the longest name of any of the Challenger trims. Is that fact worth $56,240? Your call.\n\nDodge Challenger R/T Scat Pack T/A Widebody\n\nSpecs: 485 Horsepower / 475 Pound-Feet\n\nBase Price: $57,640\n\nThe Widebody already gets its own sizable wheels, but the T/A pack subs in a different twin five-spoke design. From there, the blacked-out details and Mopar CAI remain, which is fine by us.\n\nDodge Challenger SRT Hellcat\n\nSpecs: 717 Horsepower / 656 Pound-Feet\n\nBase Price: $71,120\n\nNow we’re cooking. Little did we know when Dodge introduced the Challenger SRT Hellcat that it was just the amuse-bouche to the Redeye, Super Stock, and Demon. The original 717-hp model is also arguably the best, with surprisingly manageable power delivery, standard Bilstein three-mode adaptive dampers, Hellcat-specific wheels shod in the same upgraded tires found on the Scat Pack T/A, and a new hood design round out the big changes for the Hellcat. Prices start at $71,120, including a $1,700 gas guzzler tax. Just don't look for a manual.\n\nDodge Challenger SRT Hellcat Widebody\n\nSpecs: 717 Horsepower / 656 Pound-Feet\n\nBase Price: $77,520\n\nWhen you have 717 hp and 656 lb-ft of torque courtesy of a screaming supercharger and a 6.2-liter engine, it’s hard to argue with more surface area for that power to travel through. The Hellcat Widebody is a smart buy for lead-footed drivers.\n\nDodge Challenger SRT Hellcat Redeye\n\nSpecs: 797 Horsepower / 707 Pound-Feet\n\nBase Price: $79,725\n\nWhile there have been more powerful Challengers, the Redeye is far more common than a Demon. The 797 hp and 707 lb-ft is immense, but beyond the extra thrust, the equipment roster goes shot for shot with the standard Hellkitty. Optional extras are the same, too. Pony up $79,725, including a $2,100 gas guzzler charge, for the Redeye.\n\nDodge Challenger SRT Hellcat Redeye Widebody\n\nSpecs: 797 Horsepower / 707 Pound-Feet\n\nBase Price: $86,125\n\nIf wider tires were good for 707 hp, they’re even better for 797. You want Widebody treatment here, because managing the Redeye’s huge output is a challenge at the best of times. Prices come in at $86,125.\n\nDodge Challenger SRT Super Stock\n\nSpecs: 807 Horsepower / 707 Pound-Feet\n\nBase Price: $89,125\n\n“One part Challenger 1320, one part Hellcat Redeye. Mix thoroughly and enjoy served over ice.” That’s pretty much Dodge’s recipe for the Challenger SRT Super Stock, which it introduced in 2020. Revised powertrain programming adds 10 hp, for a total of 807. There are also Nitto drag radials, lightweight brakes, and a dedicated track mode that optimizes the Super Stock for the strip. Properly set up, the most powerful Challenger can cover the quarter mile in just 10.5 seconds. Prices come in at $89,125.\n\nDodge Challenger SRT Jailbreak\n\nSpecs: 797 Horsepower / 707 Pound-Feet\n\nBase Price: $87,120\n\nThe Challenger SRT Jailbreak is proof that this old dog does have some new tricks. Recently introduced, this trim takes the Hellcat Redeye and opens the option book up for customization. The results can be very cool... or they can look like what we created above.\n\nIn addition to an impressive color palette, the Jailbreak adds stripe packages, the T/A’s black graphics, seven different wheel designs, five different caliper colors, unique badging, and a wider range of interior upholsteries. You can even select the tint of the interior trim or choose between a leather or Alcantara steering wheel. Prices for the Jailbreak start at $87,120, but virtually every option carries a premium. Get indulgent, and six-figure prices aren’t far away.\n\nMore from Dodge:"
