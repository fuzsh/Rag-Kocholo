        "text": "It was the car with which Jim Clark won his second and last world title in 1965 Formula 1. At the wheel of the Lotus 33, the Scottish ace scored five victories and won for the first time also on Nürburgring circuit, also winning the Syracuse Grand Prix not valid for the Championship. This single-seater, designed by the brilliant Colin Chapman, debuted in '64 and he was the heir of the Lotus 25 who had introduced the concept of the monocoque. It was designed to fit new larger Dunlop tires. Distinguished by its cigar-shape and small size, the Lotus 33 employed the Coventry-Climax 8-cylinder V engine of 1.5 liters, capable of developing a power of just under 220 hp compared to a total weight of 455 kg. Equipped with a ZF 5-speed manual transmission, the Lotus 33 was also used at the beginning of '66, when, however, it adopted a Climax V8 engine 2.000 cm³, before being definitively replaced by the 43."
