As mentioned\n\nTank of fuel = £80-100\n\nNumber plates = £20\n\nDelivery = £? But doubt they're paying an individual to drive a single car trailer around the country one by one.

You can get a car delivery company to deliver it for approximately £200 max\n\ni'm glad I'm not alone in thinking this, i wonder if the same price will apply to Base car customers\n\nor\n\nIs it just to the impatient Sod's like me that will seemingly put up with being held to ransom on such costs...\n\nSorry hadn’t found the finance part - I can see that now.\n\nNot purchased new before but it seems a bit much to charge for an inspected and clean new car!

Consider yourself lucky if that is the case... It will be $6500 here in the US for just Tax (varies by state) then we have all the other fun stuff.. .usually some sort of \"destination charge\" which I paid $1500 on my Alfa Romeo and the dealer usually tacks on some sort of \"dealer fee\" of ~$500... im sure there are other \"fees\". Hope that makes you feel a bit better. Oh, we pay $181 per year also for license fee on every car.\n\nAre you saying total Tax out the door in the UK is only 1900?
