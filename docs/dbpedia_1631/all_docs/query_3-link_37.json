        "text": "We were delight­ed to learn after last week’s his­toric inau­gu­ra­tion cer­e­mo­ny that the 49th Vice Pres­i­dent of the Unit­ed States, Kamala Har­ris, is named after a beau­ti­ful flower.\n\nKamala means “lotus flower,” a plant hold­ing deep mean­ing in Indi­an cul­ture. In her mem­oir, she describes a lotus plant as grow­ing under­wa­ter, with flow­ers that rise above the sur­face, with roots plant­ed firm­ly in the river’s bottom.\n\nWe love work­ing with lotus blos­soms and vis­it­ing gar­dens where they grow. This pho­to was tak­en at a Nation­al Park in Wash­ing­ton, D.C. called the Kenil­worth Park & Aquat­ic Gar­dens close to Kamala’s new office! We’ve tak­en all our kids there with their grand­moth­er who is our guide since she is the local. The best time to vis­it is in the sum­mer when all the flow­ers are bloom­ing and the drag­on­flies are buzzing around. We even spot­ted tur­tles and frogs and lots of pret­ty birds.\n\nIn Thai­land, Lotus are grown year round. They are not sold as cut flow­ers in the Unit­ed States because the blooms do not last very long."
