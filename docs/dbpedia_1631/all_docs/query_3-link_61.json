        "text": "The properties of the lotus leaves\n\nThe lotus leaf shows an outstanding water repellency particularly on its upper (adaxial) side, which is more robust and less sensitive to mechanical damage than the under (abaxial) side. The reasons for these superior properties can be ascribed to the combination of micro- and nano-structures with optimized geometry and the unique chemical composition of the epicuticular waxes. These properties are illustrated in the following sections and compared with those of other superhydrophobic leaves. (The species are listed in the Experimental section).\n\nMinimization of the water-to-leaf contact area: The epidermis cells of the upper leaf side form papillae of varying height and with a unique shape. The diameter of the papillae is much smaller than that of the epidermis cells and each papilla apex is not spherical but forms an ogive ( ).\n\nThe whole surface is covered with short wax tubules which often accumulate in clusters. In comparison with other papillose plant surfaces, lotus has the highest density of papillae, but the lotus papillae have much smaller diameters which reduces the contact area with water drops; strictly speaking, the area of heterogeneous contact between surface and water. The contact area depends on the hydrophobicity of the surface and on the pressure of the water or on the kinetic energy or velocity of the striking water drops. At low pressures, caused by resting or rolling water droplets, the contact area is determined by the local contact angle of the surface structures. For the surface of a papilla coated with wax tubules, a superhydrophobic behavior with a local contact angle of >140° can be assumed. So, the diameter of the contact areas can be estimated from the SEM images and the cross sections of the selected samples ( ).\n\nThe minimized contact area is the basic cause for the very low adhesion of water and, thus, the small roll-off (tilting) angles. Compared with lotus, the papillae on the leaves of the other plants (E. myrsinites, C. esculenta, A. macrorrhiza) ( , see also ) have much larger diameters and tip radii, and are covered with different wax types, wax platelets or wax film, respectively, which have a lower water repellency than wax tubules.\n\nThe varying height of the papillae further reduces the adhesion between water drops and the surface ( ). Small resting or sliding water drops touch only the highest papillae [12]. At higher pressures, e.g., at the impact of raindrops, the water intrudes deeper between the papillae ( ) and forms a meniscus at the still superhydrophobic wax tubules coating. The deformation of the non-wetting droplet surface due to surface tension causes a repellent force (‘re’, ). When the water retracts, either at the receding side of a moving drop or if the drop is lifted off the surface, the contact areas decrease and the papillae release their contact to the water one by one ( , ), so that only few of the papillae are simultaneously in the adhesive state (‘ad’). Finally, before the drop loses contact with the leaf, only few of the papillae are still in contact and cause a small adhesive force. In contrast, artificial superhydrophobic samples with pillars of equal height lead to stronger adhesion during drop retraction when all the pillars are simultaneously in the adhesive state before the contact breaks ( ). The measurement of the adhesive and repellent forces between a superhydrophobic papilla-model (with ten times larger tip radius than a lotus papilla) and a water drop is shown in .\n\nContact angle measurements are the standard tool for the determination of hydrophobicity. But the measurement of very high contact angles is often inaccurate due to difficulties in the determination of the exact drop shape [16], particularly on uneven leaf surfaces. For many superhydrophobic plant surfaces, the contact angles are very close together [7] such that the inaccuracies are larger than the differences between the samples. This may prevent a meaningful comparison. A more differentiated comparison of water repellency has been achieved by the measurement of the adhesion between surface and water during retraction of a drop [13], similar to the measurement shown in . shows, in addition to other relevant properties, the maximal adhesion forces of water drops on fresh lotus leaves and leaves of other species with intact wax. The adhesion forces are strongly dependent on surface defects which cause pinning of the drops. In contrast, advancing contact angles depend weakly on such irregularities. Thus, the adhesion data correlate better with receding contact angles and hysteresis and indicate the perfection and defects of superhydrophobic surfaces.\n\nTable 1\n\nNelumbo nucifera (Lotus)\n\n(upper side)Colocasia esculenta\n\n(upper side)Euphorbia myrsinites\n\n(upper side)Alocasia macrorrhiza\n\n(lower side)Brassica oleracea\n\n(upper side)papillae density (per mm2) [9]34312662126520020contact angle (static) [7]163°165°162°157°161°drop adhesion force (µN)a8–1828–5530–5890–1277–48wax typetubulesplateletsplateletsfilm on cuticular foldsrodlets and tubuleswax melting point (°C)90–9575–7875–76n.a.b65–67main components [11]C29-diolsC28-1-olC26-1-oln.a.bC29-ketones, C29-alkanes\n\nMechanical protection of the wax crystals by papillae: The highest water repellency occurs when the water drops touch the tips of the epicuticular wax crystals only. Thus, the best properties are found on leaves with an intact coating of wax crystals on the epidermal cells ( ). The waxes are, however, relatively soft materials so that older leaves often show patches of eroded or damaged wax ( ), which cause an increased adhesion of water. Neinhuis and Barthlott (1997) [7] have reported that papillae protect the wax crystals between them. On papillose epidermis cells only the wax on the papillae tips appears damaged while the wax between the papillae remains intact ( , ). Thus, lotus leaves retain their water repellency up to the end of their lifetime. In contrast, the non-papillose surfaces of Brassica oleracea and Yucca filamentosa ( , ) often show larger damaged areas which cause a stronger pinning of water. The efficiency of the protective properties can easily be tested by wiping across the leaf with the finger, which destroys only the wax on the papillae tips ( , ), but the leaves remained superhydrophobic. In the case of the non-papillose surface of a B. oleracea leaf ( ), the waxes are completely destroyed and superhydrophobicity is lost; the contact angle decreased from 160° to ca. 130°. On a Y. filamentosa leaf ( ) with convex epidermis cells, most of the wax crystals were destroyed and the contact angle dropped from 150° to ca. 110°.\n\nThe basis for the ability to protect the leaf surface in lotus is the robustness of its leaf papillae in combination with their high density. Cross sections ( ) show that they are almost massive at least in the apical part, in contrast to the fragile papillose cells found on many flower petals. However, papillae of other superhydrophobic leaves show various architectures: Euphorbia myrsinites has completely massive papillae; those of the lower epidermis of Alocasia macrorrhiza have quite thick outer walls, whereas the epidermal cells of Colocasia esculenta have very thin walls with slight thickening at the protrusions.\n\nProperties of the lotus wax\n\nBoth the upper side and the lower side of the lotus leaf are covered with wax tubules. But, as can be seen on the SEM images ( , ), the waxes of both sides look quite different. The wax tubules of the lower side are longer (1 to 2 μm) and thicker (ca. 150 nm) and are typical ‘nonacosanol tubules’ which commonly occur on many plant species [7]. In contrast, the wax tubules of the upper leaf side are very short (0.3–1 µm) and thin (80–120 nm) but the density is very high. shows on a clearly arranged area, approximately 200 tubules per 10 µm2 on the upper side, but only about 63 tubules per 10 µm2 on the lower side of the same leaf. The spacing between the tubules on the upper side of the lotus leaf is much smaller than that of other wax crystals such as platelets ( , ) and other tubular waxes ( , , ). These distances between the hydrophobic wax crystals determine the pressure (capillary pressure) which is necessary for an intrusion of a water droplet between them.\n\nThe chemical analyses of the waxes give an explanation for the different properties. It is known that the epicuticular wax of lotus contains a high percentage of nonacosanediols [10], but the older analyses were made from the entire wax of the leaves, which was obtained as a chloroform extract and also contained intracuticular lipids. The new analyses of the separately isolated waxes from both sides ( ) show that the wax of the upper side contains ca. 65% of various nonacosanediols and only 22% of nonacosan-10-ol, whereas the wax of the underside contains predominantly nonacosan-10-ol (53%) and only 15% of diols, together with 18% of alkanes. The remaining 13% and 14% could not be identified.\n\nThis high content of nonacosanediols provides extraordinary properties to the upper side wax. The melting point of 90 to 95 °C is very high for normal (aliphatic) waxes and indicates the influence of hydrogen bonding in the crystal lattice which increases the stability. A comparison of different aliphatic wax components with similar chain length shows that the melting points increase with the occurrence of polar OH-groups. Strong hydrogen bonding effects have been measured recently by Coward (2010) [17] in nonacosanol wax using FTIR spectroscopy. The effects on the crystal structure should be even stronger for the nonacosanediols. Although the secondary alcohols (nonacosan-10-ol and nonacosanediols) contain polar OH-groups in their molecules, the resulting wax tubules are known to feature strong and relatively stable water repellency, particularly the diols of the lotus leaf. This seems paradoxical, but X-ray diffraction analyses ( ) are in accordance with a layer structure model in which the OH-groups are buried deep in the layer, while the layer surface consists only of non-polar methyl groups [11,18]. In contrast, primary alcohols such as the widespread octacosan-1-ol, which occurs in many platelet-shaped epicuticular waxes, can present the OH-group on the surface, e.g., if they are in contact with a polar environment (water). Holloway (1969) [19] studied the hydrophobicity and water contact angles of various plant waxes and pure wax components. He found the highest contact angles for aliphatic waxes which present only methyl groups on the surface.\n\nAccording to the layer structure model, the tubules are strongly curved helically growing layers. While straight long-chained alkane molecules form flat layers and regular platelet crystals, secondary alcohols and ketones carry lateral oxygen atoms which inhibit a tight package of the molecules. Thus the resulting layers have a strong curvature and form tubules with a circular cross-section ( ). Today, the progress in molecular dynamics simulations enables the calculation of the behaviour of nano-structured surfaces in contact with water [20] and to prove the theories such as those of Wenzel or Cassie and Baxter. For precise modelling of the behaviour of natural water repellent surfaces, an exact knowledge of the chemical composition and molecular structure are essential.\n\nResistance against environmental stress\n\nThe excellent superhydrophobic properties of the upper side of the lotus leaf are a result of several unique optimizations. The question then arises whether this development has a certain reason or whether it is a ‘freak of nature’. On most plants, the undersides of the leaves show the highest water repellency, or more precisely, those sides which are equipped with stomata. It is obvious that the water repellency serves as a protection to keep the stomata dry [7]. On some species only the cells around the stomata are covered with wax crystals. This is in accordance with the fact that the lotus leaf is epistomatic; it bears the stomata on the upper side, which possesses the higher water repellency. The upper side of a leaf is strongly exposed to environmental impacts such as rainfall and deposition of contaminations. Obviously it is a greater challenge to keep the upper side of a large leaf dry and clean than the underside or the surfaces of vertically growing leaves (grasses etc.). On most plants, the upper sides of the leaves bear no stomata and are more robust than the undersides [21]. Thus the extremely stable and durable water repellency of the lotus leaf, which persists up to the end of its lifetime in autumn, seems to be a successful evolutionary adaptation to the aquatic environment, which led to the placing of the stomata in the upper epidermis and the development of an effective protection through specialized epidermal structures.\n\nFor a stable superhydrophobicity – that means the retention of the Cassie state with only partial contact between surface and water – an intrusion of water between the surface structures must be avoided. When the air layer is displaced by water, the water repellency is lost and the surface becomes wet (Wenzel state). The pressure which is necessary to press water into the space between hydrophobic structures depends on the local contact angle and the size of the spacing. This pressure (capillary pressure) is reciprocal to the size of the spacing and can be deduced from the Young–Laplace equation. Due to the irregular spacing, it can be estimated roughly. Water droplets with a radius <100 nm may be able to intrude between the wax tubules; this curvature corresponds to a Laplace pressure of >1.4 MPa (14 bar). Varanasi et al. (2009) [22] calculated the capillary pressures of hydrophobic test samples with structure dimensions roughly similar to those of the lotus leaf: The capillary pressure for spacing of 5 µm between hydrophobic pillars is 12 kPa (120 mbar); a nanoporous structure with 90 nm pore diameter has a capillary pressure of 1.6 MPa (16 bar). Thus the capillary pressure of the lotus papillae with spacing of ca. 10 µm is sufficient to carry the load of resting or rolling water drops. But impacting raindrops generate higher pressure pulses and can intrude into the space between the papillae. The maximal pressure for a drop impact on a rigid material can be calculated from the ‘water hammer’ equation: pWH = 0.2 ρ·c·v, where ρ is the density of the liquid, c is the speed of sound in the liquid, and v is the velocity of the droplet. Varanasi et al. (2009) [22] calculated the ‘water hammer pressure’ of raindrops with a velocity of 3 m/s as 0.9 MPa (9 bar). However, drop impacts on flexible surfaces generate considerably lower pressures [23]. Due to the small spacing between the wax tubules of the lotus leaf and their strong hydrophobicity, their capillary pressure is obviously higher than the impact pressure of raindrops and sufficient to prevent water intrusion. However, it is unproven and hypothetical whether the larger spacing in other waxes causes an intrusion of raindrops. Mechanical damage to the waxes by the impacting drops is a more likely cause for degradation.\n\nBiological models serve as an inspiration for the development of technical superhydrophobic materials [4]. So the question arises whether the lotus leaf presents an optimal architecture for superhydrophobicity. In biological surfaces, several different strategies can be found. The lotus leaf with the largely reduced contact area seems optimal for low adhesion of contaminants and water, observable as small roll-off angles. A disadvantage is the relatively soft wax material, which is too fragile for most technical applications. A different architecture is found on some species with hairy leaf surfaces. The water fern (some species of the genus Salvinia) and Pistia stratioides leaves retain a relatively thick air layer between hydrophobic hairs when submersed in water [24]. This provides sufficient buoyancy to avoid long-term submerging. Although superhydrophobic leaves retain an air layer when they are submersed, they are not designed for continuously living under water. All permanently submersed plant surfaces are hydrophilic without hydrophobic waxes [25]. Superhydrophobic surfaces which feature permanent air retention under water are found on animals (some birds, spiders and insects). An outstanding air-retention capability is found, for example, for the aquatic insect Notonecta glauca (‘backswimmer’) [26–27]. Here the water repellency is created by a two-level structure consisting of coarse hairs which can hold a relatively thick air layer, and extremely fine hairs which ensure a high capillary pressure. The biopolymers used in these structures have the advantage of a much higher strength than waxes. On the other hand, the plant surfaces have the capability to regenerate damaged or lost waxes."
