        "text": "Giving flowers is a thoughtful way to show someone you care about them. Whether you're looking to buy flowers for an anniversary, birthday or celebration or you simply want to surprise a loved one with a thoughtful arrangement, learning flower meanings can help you pick the right ones.\n\nWhile most of us know red roses embody love, there are an array of beautiful flowers that symbolize romance and various rose colors represent different meanings. Be on the lookout for red blooms (think red camellias and red tulips) while shopping for Valentine's Day flowers to gift to your significant other. For someone who recently graduated or started a new job, gift an arrangement of dahlias and amaryllis to congratulate them. Or, gift scotch brooms and blue stars to symbolize strength and resilience to support someone going through a difficult time.\n\nThe meanings behind flowers becomes especially important when it comes to negative connotations or misunderstandings. Yellow roses may appear to be a bright alternative to red roses for a significant other, but they represent friendships and platonic love â€” not something you'd want to give on an anniversary! Even worse, some beautiful flowers, such as tansies, are deceiving, as they represent a declaration of war."
