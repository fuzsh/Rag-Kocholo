I've edited the results to mainly Lotus cars, but where another type of car was first overall or in class, I included it for reference. Where a Lotus finished first overall or in class, I tried to list the 2nd place car as well, if it was not a Lotus, again for reference. The results posted here were edited from the complete official results listed at http://www.vscda.org If you have digital photos of any of these cars in action that you would be willing to share, I would be happy to include them here with a credit if you'd like.\n\n- Feature Races - Enduro - All Lotus Race - Race Results Group 2C\n\n2C seems to be the class of the Super Seven, in quantity if not reliability! Terribly sorry but for one reason or another, only one out of four Sevens made the grid. The Seven of Greg Henricks retired in practice having lost its crank pulley. Beautifully rebuilt engine, using the original pulley which simply separated from its hub. A simple enough swap, if only a spare pulley was to be had. As it was, the other Sevens not making the grid all seemed to have updated to a different belt and pulley system. I also watched as another Seven was pushed into its trailer Saturday afternoon, not even to see daylight on race day. As it was, George Balbach did his best to defend the Lotus honor against a passle of Prosche 356's, MGA's, an Elva Mk II and a Cortina GT. Of 17 entries, 9th wasn't all bad considering how the other Sevens fared!\n\nOA CP Class Car Driver Hometown Car Desc.

I was in the paddock when they fired it up and WOW! But what a lovely machine. The quick and light Lotus 23C of John Weinberger kept within 2 miles an hour of the thundering Lola to secure a second in group for Lotus and a first in class against the Causey Special. Robert Boller took a second in class in his 23B behind a LeGrand, while besting of a couple Elva Mk VII's, and a U2 Mallock.\n\nOA CP Class Car Driver Hometown Car Desc.

Barb Nevoral was 4th overall in her Super Seven and third in class after Joel's Elan and a Porsche 911. I don't know what happened to my buddy Ross Robbins that he didn't start... I think he later mentioned something about being late to the grid... arrgh! It was Jeff Fisher's brush with the wall in practice Saturday that kept him from going out in his SIV Seven this race... double arrgh!\n\nOA CP Class Car Driver Hometown Car Desc.
