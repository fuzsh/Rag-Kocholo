        "text": "In the world of Avatar, names are drawn from a wide variety of languages and sources. Although many names are transliterated into Chinese characters, the form of writing used in Avatar, most names are not Chinese and are either derived from other languages or completely fictional.\n\nPeople[]\n\nThe format of this list of name translations is: Name - Traditional Hanzi (simplified Hanzi if different) - Mandarin Pronunciation in Hanyu Pinyin/Pronunciation in other languages - English translation. Because many characters' names are never seen written on screen, and it is impossible to guess the correct characters to write a name without knowing its meaning, Chinese characters may not be given for all names.\n\nA note on East Asian names: Personal names in China, Korea, and Vietnam are usually one or two characters chosen to have an auspicious meaning, while given names in Japanese can sometimes be three. Surnames always come before the given name; in China, Korea, and Vietnam, they are almost always one character but may be two in Japan.\n\nReaders should also note that the simplified characters in the translations on this page – the characters in brackets – are not used in the show.
