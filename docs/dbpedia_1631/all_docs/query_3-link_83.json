This lotus is having 6 opulences like prosperity , Dharma , Laxmi , Gyan (knowledge) etc.\n\nभगवान् भगशब्दार्थ लीलाकमलमुद्वहन् |\n\nधर्मं यशच्श्र भगवांच्श्रामरव्यजनेSभजत् ||SB 12.11.18||\n\nbhagavān bhaga-śabdārthaṁ līlā-kamalam udvahan\n\ndharmaṁ yaśaś ca bhagavāṁś cāmara-vyajane ’bhajat\n\nPlayfully carrying a lotus, which represents the various opulences designated by the word bhaga, the Supreme Lord accepts service from a pair of cāmara fans, which are religion and fame.\n\nSee the word \" Leela Kamal\" in the verse. So the Padma in Lord Vishnu's hand can also be called by this name."
