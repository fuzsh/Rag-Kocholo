        "text": "Featured on AutoHunter, the online auction platform driven by ClassicCars.com, is this restored 1960 Lotus 18 Formula Junior, an open-wheel race car that has competed on tracks across North America. Power is provided by a rebuilt Cosworth-Ford 105E 1100cc four-cylinder paired with a rebuilt six-speed manual transaxle. Features include wraparound windshield, wobbly-web wheels, safety harness. Finished in two-tone green and yellow, this Lotus is offered with documentation, dyno sheet, spare parts, the original Renault gearbox, receipts and bill of sale.\n\nThe fiberglass body was refinished in British Racing Green with yellow accent striping during a 2000 restoration carried out by GMT Racing in Connecticut. Exterior features include side mirrors, padded tubular roll bar and race decals.\n\nYellow 15-inch wobbly-web steel wheels are wrapped in Dunlop 4.5L/5.00L tires.\n\nThe open cockpit is fitted with a single red vinyl bucket seat with black RaceQuip restraints. The cockpit features a headrest, vinyl dash panel and wrapped steering wheel.\n\nInstrumentation includes a 9,000-rpm tachometer plus gauges for the oil pressure and oil temperature. The mileage on the chassis is unknown, with the selling dealer reporting this vehicle has only accrued six racing hours since the restoration was completed.\n\nThe Cosworth-Ford OHV 105E 1100cc four-cylinder has been maintained by Apex Vintage Racing of North Carolina, as shown in the various service records in the gallery in the auction page. In May 2020, the engine received a full overhaul including a new Richardson MAE cylinder head, new Carillo pistons, rings and connecting rods, and new cylinder sleeves, bearings, tappets and push rods. A Tilton Rallye clutch assembly was also installed. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a rebuilt Hewland six-speed manual transaxle. Horsepower measures 90 @ 6,800 rpm on a rear-wheel dyno.\n\nThe chassis uses independent front and rear suspensions. The front end features unequal-length wishbones, coil springs and an anti-roll bar, while the rear utilizes a wishbone setup with coil springs and radius rods. Other features include rack-and-pinion steering and Lockheed Alfin brakes with 9.75-inch drums.\n\nAs a dedicated race car, this Lotus is not street-legal and will be sold only on a bill of sale.\n\nThe auction for this 1960 Lotus 18 Formula Junior ends on Tuesday, April 25, 2023, at 3:30 p.m. (PDT)"
