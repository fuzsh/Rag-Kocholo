        "text": "Lotus has always been a phenomenal brand in terms of product, innovation, driving characteristics, and level of appeal, and all that DNA remains in the new product range. In fact, Lotus’ latest all-electric lifestyle cars have been very well received by the global market. The Eletre, the brand's impressive first electric hyper-SUV, is included in that acclaim. I, personally, am happy to say that it is just as engaging and appealing as all the other Lotus sports cars.\n\nAll Lotus sports cars are engineered and manufactured in Hethel, Norfolk, Lotus' home since the 1960s. The fantastic Emira that went on sale last year is now joined by its race-ready sibling, the all-new Emira GT4. Last month in China, the GT4 completed a 'clean sweep' victory with a 1-2 finish in its international race debut at the Macau Grand Prix.\n\nBrand of the Year\n\n2023 was an incredible year for Lotus. We celebrated our 75th Anniversary and won the 'Brand of the Year' award from Carwow. But it's all just scratching the surface, as there is so much more to come in 2024 and beyond.\n\nMike Johnstone , Group VP and Chief Commercial Officer, recently said the past year has felt like executing a two-year program within 12 months. I’ve only been in my new role for a few months now, but I know what he means. The speed at which the company goes forward with new product introductions following one after the other is mind-blowing.\n\nWithin the Lotus Group, I look after the sales operations in Europe for Lotus Advanced Performance. This special projects division is responsible for extraordinary, ultra-exclusive cars such as the Evija and 'lost' Lotus Type 66.\n\nLet me take you through these two models and the exciting times ahead.\n\nType 66\n\nType 66 is a CanAm racer designed by Lotus founder, Colin Chapman in 1969 to support the brand's transatlantic ambitions. Sadly, the project never made it past the technical drawings. At that time, Lotus dominated international motorsports, from winning the Indianapolis 500 to pushing the boundaries of Formula 1. As Colin Chapman's team was fully invested in Formula 1, there wasn't the capacity to enter the CanAm series; hence, Type 66 was never put into reality. It wasn't a decision Chapman took lightly.\n\nMany years later, Colin's son, Clive, found the original Type 66 drawings while going through his father's old blueprints. Clive unearthed something he'd never seen – never even heard of before. Rediscovered and reimagined from the archives, now 53 years later, the Type 66 is brought to life to celebrate Lotus' 75th Anniversary. After all those years this incredible car will be a part of history, and what makes it more special is that it's limited to just ten customer cars.\n\nIt's like finding a lost Beatles' track – there's something about this car that just makes you smile.\n\nThe car is fundamentally true to the original vision and carefully retains period features iconic to CanAm vehicles with wide tyres, large rear wing, and a V8 engine featuring exposed intake trumpets and an analogue cockpit layout. Visually, the Type 66 also features cues from the iconic Type 72, which many consider to be the greatest F1 car of all time.\n\nModern racing technology and components have been introduced to make it both safety-compliant and more user-friendly, such as a motorsport power steering column, sequential racing gearbox, race ABS braking system, anti-stall multi-plate clutch and a fixed rollover bar. It's not historic, and it doesn't pretend to be, but rather, it's a contemporary homage to what Type 66 would have been back in the day.\n\nEvija\n\nThe Evija is a stunningly beautiful, if not the best-looking hypercar around. With over 2,000 horsepower, it's more powerful than any other car on the market. Ever. Aerodynamically, it's one of the most impressive of its kind. The unique venturi tunnels, active rear spoiler/airbrake and DRS system collectively generate 1,680 kg of downforce at V-max (350 km/h). That's about 400 kgs more than the Aston Martin Valkyrie.\n\nThe Evija has true Lotus DNA: impressive driving characteristics and handling, a very innovative concept, and it’s the lightest full-electric hypercar in the market: just over 1,850 kg kerb weight. In comparison, that's over a hundred kilos lighter than a Bugatti Chiron while having the extra performance equivalent of a Porsche 911 on board with you. As a result, the Evija effortlessly sprints from 0-300km/h in more than four seconds faster than the Chiron.\n\nThis is precisely why Evija's technological concept makes it the next-gen hypercar. Another innovative feature I like very much is its centrally-mounted battery pack behind the passenger compartment: like a mid-engine sports car layout it optimises the rotational inertia, giving it an excellent handling and driving experience.\n\nEvija prospect drive opportunity\n\nIn January 2024, we'll head to the Algarve, Portugal for Evija's first-ever test drive event on both public roads and the Portimão GP circuit. We've put together an exciting itinerary for our guests, which will see them drive the Evija around Portimão and spend a day on the circuit with our team, learning the full capabilities of this incredible hypercar. Guests will also be given privileged access to a confidential special project vehicle, which is yet to be formally announced to the media.\n\nExiting internship position\n\nTo support our European ambitions and the activation plan of the Lotus Evija, we have an internship opening for February 2024: Commercial Intern Lotus Advanced Performance. It's a terrific opportunity to learn in a highly international environment and work within a dynamic organisation.\n\nVisit our career page for more information!\n\nWishing you every success for the remainder of 2023! Enjoy the holiday season, and have a safe, healthy and prosperous new year!"
