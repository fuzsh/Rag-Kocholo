SNET would follow suit the next year, with SBC/Americast selling their systems to competitor Wide Open West that same year.[5][6][7][8] Verizon (previously known as GTE), the last company to offer the Americast service, sold their systems to Knology in 2003.[9]\n\nDefunct AT&T Brands / The Bell System\n\nA2B Music | Aio Wireless | AT&T Broadband | AT&T Digital Cable | AT&T Phone Center | Audience Network | Cingular Wireless | TCI | Vanguard Cellular Systems\n\nBell System\n\nBell System\n\nBell Phone Center Store | Western Electric\n\nRegional Bell Operating Companies / 'Baby Bells'\n\nAmeritech1 | Bell Atlantic | BellSouth | Nynex1 | Pacific Telesis1 | SBC Communications | US West\n\nAmeritech\n\nAmericast2 | Ameritech1 | Illinois Bell | Indiana Bell | Michigan Bell | Ohio Bell | Wisconsin Bell\n\nBell Atlantic\n\nBell Atlantic | Bell Of Pennsylvania | Diamond State Telephone | GTE | New Jersey Bell | Nynex1 | Tele-TV2 | The C&P Telephone Company | The C&P Telephone Company Of Maryland | The C&P Telephone Company Of Virginia | The C&P Telephone Company Of West Virginia\n\nBellSouth\n\nAmericast2 | BellSouth | Cingular Wireless2 | South Central Bell | Southern Bell\n\nNynex\n\nIBM Product Center | New England Telephone | New York Telephone | Nynex1 | NYNEX Business Centers | NYNEX CableComms | Tele-TV2\n\nPacific Telesis\n\nPacific Telesis1 | PacTel Cable UK | PacTel Cellular | Pacific Bell | Pacific Bell Digital TV | Nevada Bell | Tele-TV2\n\nSBC Communications\n\nAmericast2 | Ameritech1 | Cingular Wireless2 | Pacific Telesis1 | SBC Communications | SNET | Prodigy (Internet Service)\n\nUS West\n\nContinental Cablevision | MediaOne | Mountain Bell | Northwestern Bell | Pacific Northwest Bell | US West\n\n1Baby Bell company which was acquired by another Baby Bell company\n\n2Joint Venture"
