        "text": "Network and Infrastructure Enhancements Support DSL Technology\n\nCleveland, Ohio, April 06, 2000\n\nCLEVELAND (April 4, 2000) - Ameritech announced today that it will increase infrastructure spending in its Ohio telecommunications network by almost 16 percent this year, largely due to its largely due to Project Pronto, a $6 billion initiative by its parent company, SBC Communications Inc., to make Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) service available to 80 percent of its customers by 2002.\n\nBefore the end of this year, Ameritech expects to invest more than $550 million in network enhancements in Ohio alone to bring customers the latest broadband technologies and high-quality, dependable voice service. The projected spending represents an approximate 16 percent increase over a 1999 investment of more than $476 million for the same types of improvements. Network spending has increased an average of 9.6 percent per year since 1995.\n\nAmeritech network infrastructure investment includes enhancements like upgrades to the local loop infrastructure and Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) switches. It does not represent information technology and wireless investments.\n\n\"This increased network investment is a benefit of Ameritech's merger with SBC Communications,\" said Jacqueline F. Woods, president of Ameritech Ohio. \"We are investing in technology that will have a direct, positive impact on our customers. Not only will our investment benefit customers who want high-speed Internet access, it also will provide better, more reliable communications for nearly all of our customers throughout Ohio.\"\n\nPart of this investment includes upgrades to and installation of additional fiber-optic technology to support DSL and other high-speed data services. These enhancements increase the capacity of Ameritech's network, allowing it to handle future data growth. Fiber-optic technology not only helps to ensure greater network reliability, but also enables users to benefit from high-speed access to such telecommunications applications as data transfer, Internet browsing, telemedicine, video conferencing and distance learning.\n\nDSL service enables customers to access the Internet or corporate networks at speeds up to 200 times faster than standard analog modems. DSL allows customers to instantly connect to the Internet without the hassle of busy signals or waiting for the modem to dial-up. Each DSL customer will receive a dedicated connection to their central office with guaranteed minimum connection speeds.\n\nProject Pronto will help transform SBC into the largest single provider of advanced broadband services in America and will make DSL access available to an estimated 77 million Americans, or about 80 percent of SBC's customers. In Ohio, DSL service from Ameritech.net will be available in 71 cities by the end of 2000. Ultimately, the company plans to make broadband services available to all of its customers.*\n\nThe network improvements also will allow competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs) to better access the Ameritech network to allow for increased competition between local phone service providers. Ameritech is modifying its operating systems to provide electronic interfaces, and adding additional local service centers to accommodate CLECs' needs. More local competition and more choices will allow consumers to choose from a number of different telephone service providers.\n\n\"Competition in communications is good for all residential and business customers,\" said Woods. \"It saves customers money and promotes improved technology and better quality service. We want to encourage a competitive environment.\"\n\nIn addition to the Project Pronto- and CLECs-related enhancements, Ameritech also is upgrading and enhancing its Advanced Intelligent Network (AIN) platforms, conducting infrastructure modernization and upgrading its interoffice connections.\n\n* Ameritech's DSL service is provided by Ameritech Corp.'s wholly owned data subsidiary, Ameritech Advanced Data Services."
