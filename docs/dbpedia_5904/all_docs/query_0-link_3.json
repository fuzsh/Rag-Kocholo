        "text": "Nuclear Rabbit is a California band, started in Novato. The band's music has been called metal, more specifically \"avant-garde\" metal, but incorporates a variety of other styles, making the classification even more difficult. Known for its unusual sound and the lyrics, as well as bassist Jean Baudin's 11-string bass. Nuclear Rabbit has a large fan base despite being a perpetually underground and independent band. They are arguably one of the most well known underground bands in California, having more mainstream bands like Papa Roach, Alien Ant Farm, and Deftones opening for them.\n\nNuclear Rabbit was started in 1989 by bassist Jean Baudin, who was influenced by a variety of music styles, including Fishbone, Primus and Bad Brains, and envisioned having a band not bound to any genre. He was soon joined by guitarist Pat Garner and drummer Steve \"Stymie\" Sigaty. Originally Baudin performed the vocals, but Greg Parrish was eventually asked to step in as vocalist. Nuclear Rabbit incorporates a variety of genres in their music, including metal, funk, ska, hardcore, punk, jazz, East Indian, and Egyptian. Baudin uses a variety of bass techniques, including tapping, slapping and popping. Their music is often characterized by sudden tempo changes and wacky musical stylings."
