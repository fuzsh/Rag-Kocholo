        "text": "Rabbit is the 4th animal in the 12-year cycle of the Chinese zodiac signs, coming after the Tiger and before the Dragon. Recent years of the Rabbit include 2023, 2011, 1999, 1987, 1975, 1963, and 1951, with the next Rabbit year in 2035 (Year of the Wood Rabbit). Rabbits are associated with the earthly branch symbol mÇo.\n\nThe Rabbit is open and optimistic, sensitive and imaginative, and enjoys the comfortable side of life. Theyâre not the bravest of the zodiacs and may become neurotic if they choose to dwell on their emotions.\n\nChinese Zodiac Years for Rabbit\n\nThe 12 Chinese zodiac animal signs are based on the Chinese lunar calendar (often used in traditional Chinese culture), which doesnât correspond exactly with the Gregorian calendaring system.\n\nTo find your Chinese astrology zodiac animal, pay particular attention to the beginning date of Chinese New Year or Lunar New Year. This is especially important if you were born in January or February, as your animal may be from the last year (use the chart below to find where your lunar month falls).\n\nChart of Years, Dates, and Elements for Rabbit Zodiac Signs\n\nRabbit Year\n\nLunar Year Start Date\n\nLunar Year End Date\n\nElement\n\n1927\n\nFebruary 2, 1927\n\nJanuary 22, 1928\n\nFire\n\n1939\n\nFebruary 19, 1939\n\nFebruary 8, 1940\n\nEarth\n\n1951\n\nFebruary 6, 1951\n\nJanuary 26, 1952\n\nMetal\n\n1963\n\nJanuary 25, 1963\n\nFebruary 12, 1964\n\nWater\n\n1975\n\nFebruary 11, 1975\n\nJanuary 30, 1976\n\nWood\n\n1987\n\nJanuary 29, 1987\n\nFebruary 16, 1988\n\nFire\n\n1999\n\nFebruary 16, 1999\n\nFebruary 4, 2000\n\nEarth\n\n2011\n\nFebruary 3, 2011\n\nJanuary 22, 2012\n\nMetal\n\n2023\n\nJanuary 22, 2023\n\nFebruary 9, 2024\n\nWater\n\n2035\n\nFebruary 8, 2035\n\nJanuary 27, 2036\n\nWood\n\nPersonality Traits of Rabbit Signs\n\nRabbits are elegant, imaginative, and courteous to othersâeven their enemiesâbecause they hate any kind of conflict. They possess a keen perception of reality, which makes Rabbits the ultimate adapters to the real world.\n\nUnexpectedly, Rabbits are savvy in business and financial transactions and are good at finding win-win solutions in complex situations. They adore an abundant lifestyle and prefer not to be stressed out most of the time.\n\nRabbits are earnest with everything they do; they just ask that others treat them the same way.\n\nRabbits wonât tolerate a boring life. Theyâll continuously create interest in life, hopping from one excitement to the next, so theyâre not the best at delving into any subject for an extended period of time.\n\nThe Rabbit personality can be overly cautious and jumpy. When a Rabbit is feeling down, may have the tendency to escape from reality. A key lesson for Rabbits is how to manage their emotions so that they can thrive.\n\nRabbit Strengths\n\nThe Rabbitâs greatest strengths include their gentle nature, keen intelligence, natural zest, and sincere modesty. Rabbits are cheerful to be around and passionate in a way that makes their partner feel like a million bucks.\n\nTheyâre also analytical and great gatherers of knowledge and information. Although Rabbits are shrewd negotiators, their less competitive and more diplomatic nature ensures that everyone will be happy with the outcome in the Rabbitâs favor.\n\nRabbit Weaknesses\n\nDespite Rabbitsâ peace-loving appearance, they can also be paranoid on occasion, even capable of becoming hysterical. If they feel jealous romantically or snubbed unfairly at work, their internal conflict may rise to a nuclear level.\n\nWhen this happens, Rabbits can become defensive out of an innate need for self-protection. If they feel betrayed, they will turn on that person with a coldness that no one wouldâve believed Rabbit capable of.\n\nRabbit Zodiacs and the Five Elements Theory\n\nThe Chinese Five Elements Theory assigns one of the five elementsâMetal, Water, Wood, Fire, and Earthâto each year, in addition to the zodiacs. So Rabbits born in different years will have different personalities.\n\nLucky (and Unlucky) Things for Rabbits\n\nRabbitâs luck is associated with green and yellow, 0, 6 and 2, and the direction of east. Black, 5 and 9, and living in mountainous regions, especially to the west, wonât bring great luck to Rabbits and should be avoided.\n\nIn Chinese culture, your zodiac birth year, or Ben Ming Nian, is considered unlucky, so be sure to wear red colors in the Year of the Rabbit to ward off any bad luck.\n\nLucky Things\n\nLucky numbers: 0, 6, 2\n\nLucky colors: Green, Yellow\n\nLucky directions: East\n\nLucky flowers: Bamboo, Cyclamen\n\nUnlucky Things\n\nUnlucky numbers: 5, 9\n\nUnlucky colors: Black\n\nUnlucky directions: West\n\nLove and Compatibility for Rabbits\n\nIn matters of the heart, Rabbits start out suspicious of othersâ motives, since their cautious nature means that many of their ideas and understanding of the worldâwhether real or imaginaryâtend toward the negative.\n\nOnce they truly fall in love for the first time, theyâll learn to be honest with their feelings without being defensive. In many ways, true love will be the beginning of Rabbitsâ farewell to loneliness.\n\nâ¤ï¸ Best Match: Rabbit and Goat\n\nRabbit and Goat, the softies of the 12 zodiacs, delight in their partnerâs good nature and gentle temperament, and then curiously, they find strength and courage in the power of love to take on the world.\n\nIsnât the meaning of love to make both partners the most expansive versions of themselves? Thatâs why at home where they feel safe, these two will share a pure, restorative, and nearly innocent love.\n\nâ¤ï¸ Best Match: Rabbit and Pig\n\nThis will likely be the most supportive and warm relationship Rabbit and Pig have ever experienced, and both partners will marvel at their luck in finding the perfect mate for many years to come.\n\nRabbit has always been skittish because they feel uneasy in the world, which Pigâs laid back manner goes a long way to assuage. In return, Rabbit can add a certain charm and sparkle to Pigâs life.\n\nâ¤ï¸ Best Match: Rabbit and Dog\n\nNeither Rabbit or Dog is flashy or self-important. Where some relationships have one diva and one humble servant; in this one, both partners are equal in how humble and how loving they are to each other.\n\nItâs worth noting that this pairing may make both complacent, which is fine if neither aspires to moreâbut if you do, it would be a bad idea to give up your dreams for love.\n\nWorst Matches: Rooster, Dragon\n\nRabbit and Rooster: This isnât an ideal match for love or marriage because Rooster and Rabbit look at the world in such fundamentally different ways that even as colleagues, they are likely to clash, not to mention love.\n\nAs romantic partners, theyâre bound to fight over every detail of their shared life. Rooster finds Rabbit vain, while Rabbit finds Rooster selfish. Neither will notice the otherâs better qualities, making this an exhausting pairing.\n\nRabbit and Dragon: Rabbit canât be themselves with Dragon as their mate because Dragon picks on Rabbit for being careless and complacent, resigning Rabbit to loneliness within the relationship until it becomes too much for this gentle creature.\n\nTheir personalities clash because Dragon is decisive and overwrought, always wanting to press things forward relentlessly, which tires Rabbit out, while Rabbit is quiet and sensitive with a rich emotional life that Dragon will ignore.\n\nCareers Fit for the Chinese Zodiac Rabbit\n\nRabbits are wise in thought and action. They may appear vain at a glance, but people will soon find out how wrong their first impression was when Rabbits impress everyone by getting their hands dirty.\n\nTheyâre cautious with moneyâmaking them excellent finance professionalsâbut Rabbits can certainly also be wildly creative with their quick and agile imagination, making them suitable for work related to literature, art, architecture, and music.\n\nRabbits are not suited for anything that takes a long time, as focus is not their strong suit. Theyâll find anything that obliges them to decide between right and wrong distasteful since they dislike confrontation.\n\nBest careers for Rabbits\n\nFinance\n\nArtist\n\nArchitecture\n\nPublic Relations\n\nTeacher\n\nWorst careers for Rabbits\n\nLawyer\n\nPolitics\n\nSpeculative Investment\n\nManual Labor\n\nResearcher\n\nHealth and Lifestyle Advice for Rabbits\n\nAs a wood zodiac, Rabbit is blessed with natural physical vitality, although in return, theyâll likely struggle more than others in terms of emotional and psychological health, often suffering from neuroticism or anxiety throughout life.\n\nYour natural sensitivity is your strength and weakness, as itâll help if you wish to be an artist or at least help your communication, but donât let it stop you from progressing in life, Rabbit!\n\nRabbit and the 12 Zodiac Animals (Origin Story)\n\nMyth and legend have it that Rabbit became the fourth zodiac in the Chinese culture because it participated in a celestial race with its swift thinking and action. Are you curious about the Rabbitâs zodiac origin story?\n\nAt the beginning of time, the Jade Emperor, who governed the heavens, decided to hold a race across a celestial river to decide which animals would be honored by the people as the 12 zodiacs.\n\nRabbit wasnât expected to have a place among the chosen 12 at all since it was neither strong nor a quick swimmer. But like the Rat that jumped inside the Oxâs ear, the Rabbit cleverly hopped from the other animalsâ backs to pass the Dragon and Snake, cross the finish line, and win fourth place!\n\nFamous People Born in the Year of the Rabbit\n\nRabbits are clever and agreeable, often making them celebrities very popular and well-liked by the public.\n\nRobin Williams: July 21, 1951, Metal Rabbit\n\nIan McKellen: May 25, 1939, Earth Rabbit\n\nAngelina Jolie: June 4, 1975, Wood Rabbit\n\nBlake Lively: August 25, 1987, Fire Rabbit\n\nMichael Jordan: February 17, 1963, Water Rabbit\n\nDavid Beckham: May 2, 1975, Wood Rabbit\n\nQueen Victoria: May 24, 1819, Earth Rabbit\n\nJohnny Depp: June 9, 1963, Water Rabbit\n\nRabbitâs Horoscope for 2024 (Year of the Dragon)\n\nAfter a tough zodiac year, Rabbits will still need to withstand considerable pressure in 2024 since Dragon clashes with Rabbit, meaning itâs Rabbitâs year of âFan Tai Sui,â or offending the God of Tai Sui.\n\nEven though inauspicious signs abound for Rabbits, as long as you stay positive and under the radarâdonât take unnecessary trips or outings, and keep an upbeat mindsetâthis year wonât be impossible to navigate.\n\nRabbitâs 2024 Love and Relationships Forecast\n\nRabbitâs love life will take the heaviest hit by Tai Sui in 2024, which must be awful news for this romantic group, but bad luck, like good, comes around to everyone, so itâll be okay.\n\nSingle Rabbits will either face a complete void of eligible romantic interests or, even worse, keep coming across people with player energy who have the potential to break their hearts. Do be careful, Rabbit!\n\nRabbits who already have a significant other may have a case of the infamous Rabbit neuroticism all year. Do they still love me? Are they seeing someone else? These questions will run through Rabbitâs mind.\n\nCareer Prospects for Rabbit in 2024\n\nIn 2024, Rabbit may find it difficult to give work their all, either because theyâre feeling scattered with worry or else too tired from the Tai Sui influence to focus on the tasks at hand.\n\nTheir supervisor wonât take that well, especially because Rabbit is usually a charming and quick contributor at work. As such, Rabbit is advised to leave other concerns out of their mind and always stay present.\n\nOne more word of advice: donât spill all your secrets in the officeâactually, donât spill any of your secrets, Rabbit! âFriendsâ from work may very well turn around and stab you in the back.\n\nRabbitâs Wealth and Finance in 2024\n\nItâs likely a year of mediocre or less-than-expected income for Rabbits, compounded by higher-than-expected expenses. Thatâs not a winning formula. It also doesnât help that Rabbit will feel unmotivated in 2024.\n\nUsually, Rabbits are known for their elegance and taste for the finer things in life. But try not to invest in anything that can wait, Rabbit, as other expenses in 2024 may be more urgent.\n\nItâs at least fortunate that Tian Yi, an auspicious star, is in Rabbitâs quarter and offsetting the negative effect of Tai Sui. If Rabbit is in dire financial straits, theyâll receive help from many loved ones.\n\nHealth Predictions for Rabbits in 2024\n\nAs already mentioned, itâd serve Rabbit to stay home more this year, although that doesnât mean they should be on the couch instead of getting enough exerciseâa sturdier physique would really help in 2024.\n\nWith Tai Suiâs meddling, Rabbit may be illness-prone this year, but nothing too troublesome is in the stars. What you can do is have regular check-ups and go see the doctor if anything feels off.\n\nTake care of your digestion, Rabbit. Youâre already delicate in this area, and in 2024, be extra careful not to eat anything overly taxing on your system, and youâll end the year in fine shape."
