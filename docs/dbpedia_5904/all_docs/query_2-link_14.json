        "text": "Nuclear Rabbit\n\nFormed in the early 90's in Novato, Ca. Became legends in the underground metal/rock scene in the Bay Area. Band members have come and gone but Jean Baudin, the bassist (who uses a wide variety of custom-made 4-9 string bass guitars), has remained in the band since founding it. Their intense and crazy live show is not to be missed. As of early 2007, they are working on new tunes."
