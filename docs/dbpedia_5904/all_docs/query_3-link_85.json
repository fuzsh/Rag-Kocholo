        "text": "The main types of waste generated by the mining and milling of uranium ore are tailings and waste rock.\n\nTailings are the waste produced by grinding the ore and the chemical concentration of uranium. When dried, tailings have the consistency of fine sand.\n\nWaste rock is simply rock material removed from the mine to gain access to the ore. It has very little to no concentration of uranium.\n\nWaste rock is separated into clean rock or mineralized rock, according to its mineral content.\n\nTailings and mineralized waste rock must be managed over the long term because they could contain significant concentrations of radioactive elements (primarily thorium-230 and radium-226, along with their associated decay products).\n\nTailings and mineralized waste rock are contained in engineered surface and near-surface waste management facilities located near the mines and mills.\n\nTailings management\n\nWaste rock management\n\nClosed and decommissioned mines and mills\n\nOntario\n\nSaskatchewan\n\nNorthwest Territories\n\nExempted Sites\n\nTailings management\n\nTailings are stored in tailings management facilities (TMFs) designed to isolate the tailings from the surrounding environment for a very long time.\n\nTMFs are located within mined-out open pits or in surface impoundments, which use geographical features and man-made barriers such as dams to contain the tailings. They are designed to ensure that groundwater and surface water is diverted from the tailings to prevent any contamination.\n\nTailings are generally deposited underwater to:\n\nprevent them from oxidizing\n\nprovide shielding from radiation emanating from the tailings\n\nstop dust from blowing off the surface of the tailings\n\nTailings are deposited in the TMF as a slurry. The solids settle in the TMF, while the liquids are later collected and processed through a water treatment plant to remove contaminants.\n\nThe resulting effluent must meet regulated quality requirements before it is allowed to be discharged into the environment.\n\nIn Canada, tailings are currently deposited in TMFs at Cameco Corporation's Key Lake and Rabbit Lake operations, as well as Orano Canada's McClean Lake operation.\n\nAll of these facilities are in-pit TMFs as depicted in the image to the right.\n\nThere are also two inactive above-ground TMFs located at the Rabbit Lake and Key Lake Operations.\n\nThe ore extracted from the McArthur River and Cigar Lake Mines is milled and the tailings are stored at the Key Lake and McClean Lake operations.\n\nWaste rock management\n\nIn addition to tailings, mining activities produce large quantities of clean and mineralized waste rock, which must be excavated to access the uranium ore body.\n\nDuring mining operations, clean and mineralized waste rock will be placed in separate rock piles, as each require different management practices.\n\nClean waste rock can be used for construction activities, such as aggregate in concrete and the construction of roads.\n\nClean rock that is left over once mining has ceased can be left in piles on the surface, contoured to blend in with the natural environment and revegetated.\n\nMineralized waste rock contains either low-grade ore with little value or significant concentrations of secondary minerals.\n\nIf left exposed on the surface indefinitely, this waste rock could generate acid or release contaminants at rates that could impact the local environment.\n\nDuring operations, mineralized waste rock is deposited on impermeable pads.\n\nSeepage and run-off from the mineralized waste rock piles are collected and processed through a water treatment plant to remove contaminants before they are released to the environment.\n\nWherever possible, mines are specifically designed to minimize the volume of mineralized rock removed from the mine and to return mineralized waste rock to the mine (as backfill).\n\nLong-term management of mineralized waste rock includes depositing the rock in mined-out open pits, topping them with clean waste rock (or till) and covering surface piles with canopies engineered to minimize the infiltration of water and erosion.\n\nClosed and decommissioned mines and mills\n\nThere are 20 TMFs located at closed or decommissioned uranium mines in Canada: 14 in Ontario, four in Saskatchewan and two in the Northwest Territories.\n\nOntario\n\nSaskatchewan\n\nNorthwest Territories\n\nThese inactive sites are being managed for the long term by their former owners or by the federal or respective provincial governments. The Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) regulates the sites by closely monitoring their maintenance and environmental performance.\n\nClosed and decommissioned mines and mills in Canada\n\nFacility Location Licensee Denison Mine Ontario Denison Mines Ltd.

Two companies – Rio Algom Ltd. and Denison Mines Inc. – operated and decommissioned the sites, with decommissioning starting in 1992 and lasting for a decade.\n\nAll of the sites have now been substantially decommissioned, with all mine features capped or blocked, all facility structures demolished and all sites landscaped and revegetated (active decommissioning).\n\nThe effectiveness of site remediation and the influence on the surrounding environment are being monitored.\n\nThe Serpent River Watershed Monitoring Program is an extensive program that monitors the environmental quality across the basin and near the Pronto site, which is located outside of the watershed.\n\nThe program was designed in consultation with federal and provincial regulators, including the CNSC. Assessments of monitoring results have been presented in periodic environment reports.\n\nKey findings in the review of the environmental data collected between 2005 and 2009 show that current releases to the environment are extremely low and that there are virtually no measurable impacts outside the licensed areas.\n\nSeptember 4, 2019: CNSC releases 2018 Independent Environmental Monitoring Program results for Elliot Lake historical sites.\n\nAgnew Lake\n\nThe Agnew Lake mine, located about 25 kilometres northwest of Nairn Centre, Ontario stopped operating in 1983.\n\nThe uranium mine site was decommissioned and monitored by Kerr Addison Mines from 1983 until 1988. The site was then turned over to the province of Ontario in the early 1990s.\n\nWater quality is regularly monitored to confirm the success of the remediation project.\n\nBancroft area\n\nUranium tailings management sites also exist at the Dyno, Bicroft and Madawaska mines in the Bancroft area, Ontario.\n\nOperations at the Dyno mine and Bicroft sites ceased in the early 1960s, while the Madawaska mine has been inactive since 1983.\n\nThe Dyno Mine and Madawaska Mine sites are managed and monitored by EWL Management Ltd.\n\nThe Bicroft site is managed by Barrick Gold Corporation.\n\nWater is sampled regularly to confirm the remediation projects are successful and to verify that requirements are being complied with.\n\nThese sites were remediated in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nSaskatchewan\n\nThere are four closed and decommissioned uranium mine sites in Northern Saskatchewan: Cluff Lake, Beaverlodge, former Lorado mill site and Gunnar.\n\nCluff Lake\n\nOrano Canada Inc. (formerly known as AREVA Resources Canada Inc.) held a uranium mine decommissioning licence for Cluff Lake until May 2023.\n\nUranium mining and milling operations began in 1980 and ended in 2002. A comprehensive study report was completed and accepted by the CNSC in 2004, resulting in the authorization to proceed with decommissioning activities.\n\nThe active decommissioning of the mill, tailings management area (TMA) and mining areas was completed between 2004 and 2006. Some infrastructure was left in place, allowing site monitoring to continue while allowing Orano Canada to maintain a full-time presence.\n\nIn 2013, Orano Canada requested to discontinue full-time site presence. The CNSC accepted the request, and the decommissioning of the remaining infrastructure was completed. The site will continue to be monitored 4 times per year.\n\nIn 2019, the Commission held a 1-part public hearing to consider an application from Orano Canada to renew the uranium mine decommissioning licence for the Cluff Lake Project, located in the Athabasca Basin of northern Saskatchewan. Following the hearing, the Commission announced its decision to renew the licence, allowing Orano to decommission the project site, and to possess, manage and store nuclear substances.\n\nIn 2023, following a public hearing held virtually on MarchÂ 1, 2023, the Commission concluded that the decommissioning objectives and criteria established for the Cluff Lake Project had been met, that the site was passively safe, and that it would remain passively safe for the long term. As a result, the Commission revoked the uranium mine licence held by Orano Canada and exempted the Province of Saskatchewan from licensing under theÂ Nuclear Safety and Control ActÂ so that the site could be transferred to Saskatchewan’s Institutional Control Program. The Commission concluded, after reviewing all submissions and interventions, that doing so would not pose an unreasonable risk to the environment, to the health and safety of persons, or to national security.\n\nBeaverlodge\n\nCameco Corporation (Cameco) currently holds a waste facility operating licence for the site that is valid until MayÂ 31, 2025.\n\nUranium mining and milling operations started in 1952 and ended in 1982. Decommissioning began in 1982, with active decommissioning completed in 1985. Since then, the site has been in a monitoring and maintenance phase.\n\nCameco, which is the operator (on behalf of the Government of Canada), has been monitoring the site and conducting work to enable the site to be transferred to the Government of Saskatchewan’s Institutional Control Program (ICP). Originally, there were 70Â separate properties on the Beaverlodge site. In 2009, 5Â were removed from the CNSC-issued licence and transferred to the ICP. After a public hearing in 2019, the Commission released an additional 20Â properties, 19Â of which were transferred to the ICP. One property did not require institutional control measures as it had no associated risk and was therefore not transferred. In September 2022, the Commission announced the release of an additional 18Â properties, leaving 27Â properties under the CNSC-issued licence.\n\nIn May 2023, the Commission renewed Cameco’s waste facility operating licence for the decommissioned Beaverlodge mine and mill site for 2Â years.\n\nGunnar and Lorado\n\nThe Saskatchewan Research Council holds a decommissioning licence for the Gunnar site and a nuclear substances and radiation devices licence for the former Lorado mill site. The Gunnar site has yet to be fully decommissioned. However, at the former Lorado mill site, remediation work was completed in 2020; the site is currently being monitored to verify long-term performance.\n\nPrivate-sector companies that no longer exist operated these facilities from the 1950s until the early 1960s. The governments of Canada and Saskatchewan are responsible for the cost of the cleanup.\n\nCNSC staff, together with the Saskatchewan Ministry of the Environment, regularly inspect these facilities.Â\n\nLatest CNSC announcements\n\nCNSC amends Cameco Corporation’s Beaverlodge Waste Facility Operating Licence\n\nCNSC removes the Gunnar Remediation Project phase 2 hold point as it pertains to the remediation of the tailings deposits\n\nVideos\n\nGunnar mine site remediation project in Northern Saskatchewan (SRC)\n\nCleaning up mines in Northern Saskatchewan (SRC)\n\nNorthwest Territories\n\nThere are two licensed closed uranium mine and tailings sites in the Northwest Territories: Port Radium mine and Rayrock mine.\n\nPort Radium\n\nThe Port Radium site is located in the Northwest Territories at Echo Bay, on the eastern shores of Great Bear Lake, about 265 kilometres east of the Dene community of Déline at the edge of the Arctic Circle.\n\nMining at the Port Radium site occurred from 1932 to 1940, from 1942 to 1960 and from 1964 to 1982 – in the last instance, to recover silver.\n\nThe site was partially decommissioned in 1984, according to the standards of the day. In 2006, the Government of Canada reached an agreement with the local community and completed the remediation of the site in 2007 under a CNSC licence.\n\nRegular water samplings are taken to confirm the success of the remediation project.\n\nRayrock\n\nUranium mining and milling occurred at the Rayrock site from 1957 until 1959, when it was abandoned.\n\nThe Government of Canada decommissioned and rehabilitated the Rayrock site (including capping the tailings) in 1996.\n\nPerformance monitoring and reporting of the results have been ongoing since 1996.\n\nRegular water samplings are taken to confirm the success of the remediation project.\n\nExempted sites\n\nThere are 78 historic radium/uranium mines without tailings across Canada, dating from the uranium mining \"boom\" years (1930s to 1960s).\n\nThese sites, known as idle mines, were exempted from CNSC regulation because of the low risk they present.\n\nIdle mines are currently being regulated for safety under provincial and territorial mining and land management acts.\n\nThey are located primarily in the areas of Uranium City, Saskatchewan and Bancroft, Ontario. Additional sites are located in the Northwest Territories.\n\nOre from these small mines was hauled away for custom milling; therefore, no uranium tailings can be found onsite.\n\nThese idle mines are, in all physical and radiological characteristics, indistinguishable from conventional mines.\n\nRelated links"
