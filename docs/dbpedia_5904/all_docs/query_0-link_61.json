        "text": "The lyrics to Nuclear Rabbit's Secretly Meaty present a disgruntled customer seeking service at a restaurant. The singer is frustrated with the wait time and is hesitant to order from the menu, unsure if they will regret their decision. They address the server, Linda, with a confrontational attitude, referring to her as a \"pea-brain napkin Maid\" who needs to smile. Despite their reservations, the singer decides to order a slice of cow, or \"forgotten beef,\" and receives a set of silverware with their meal. The song also mentions a character named Dirty Mike who enjoys the food at the restaurant and requests a plate of fries."
