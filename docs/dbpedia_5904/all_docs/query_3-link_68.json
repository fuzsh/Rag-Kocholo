        "text": "1989\n\nAfter years of research in and observation of many breeds of dogs, veterinary orthopedist Alida Wind grows convinced that canine elbow arthrosis results from various dysplasias of the elbow joint. With the aid of clients Barbara and Martin Packard, Wind organizes the first international conference on elbow dysplasia; and the group of orthopedists, radiologists and geneticists establishes the first protocols for the evaluation and diagnosis of the condition.\n\nVeterinary scientists based at the California National Primate Research Center are the first to isolate and describe the simian immunodeficiency virus and explore complex comparative studies to promote therapies for AIDS.\n\nThe nation's first Pet Loss Support Hotline becomes a national resource for people grieving due to the loss of a pet and an opportunity for veterinary students to gain training and firsthand experience in effective and compassionate communication with pet owners.\n\n1988\n\nThe California Animal Health and Food Safety Laboratory System, the state's veterinary diagnostic laboratory, opens on the UC Davis campus with a faculty dedicated to clinical diagnosis of animal disease. The public service program succeeds in partnership with the California Department of Food and Agriculture to safeguard the health of California’s livestock and poultry industries and protect the public health from animal disease.\n\nTimothy O'Brien, Roy Pool, Dennis Meagher and John D Wheat start a formal program to address orthopedic injuries in racehorses. Endowed as the JD Wheat Veterinary Orthopedic Research Laboratory in 1998, the program advances diagnosis and prevention of catastrophic injuries to improve equine health and welfare. O’Brien's innovations in diagnostic imaging with large animals bring the school international attention for the radiologic characterization of bone and joint problems of horses.\n\nTilahun Yilma publishes \"Protection of cattle against rinderpest with infectious vaccinia virus recombinants expressing the HA or F gene.\" The veterinary virologist also develops a diagnostic test that is practical to use in the field. Rinderpest is a serious disease of cattle, especially in Africa.\n\n1987\n\nIra “Gary” Gourley performs the first successful feline kidney transplant, leading the next generation of veterinary surgeons to develop the school's renowned kidney transplant program and build its reputation for small animal surgery. The school's training program prepares veterinary surgeons to establish several successful transplant programs across the country.\n\nDespite a disturbing arson event during construction, the California Animal Health and Food Safety Laboratory opens in partnership with the California Department of Food and Agriculture. Faculty revitalize California's animal diagnostic laboratories by successfully merging research into service to benefit livestock, poultry, horses and public health. Laboratory personnel carry modern molecular biology into daily use. Conducting nearly 2 million distinct analyses each year, personnel achieve rapid, accurate results and discover pathogens undetectable by conventional methods. The innovations in veterinary pathology, immunology, microbiology, analytical chemistry, toxicology and other disciplines influence quality assurance programs throughout the nation and bring the laboratory recognition and new responsibilities as a key resource for national networks. The laboratory's specimens and other data contribute to teaching as well as research; faculty consult on difficult diagnostic problems, thus providing greater value to producers.\n\nComparative virology studies of immunodeficiency in cats leads to the first description of feline immunodeficiency virus and a veterinary model that provides early insights about AIDS in humans. Niels Pedersen, Gordon Theilen and colleagues also explore modes of transmission and improve understanding of feline leukemia, feline infectious peritonitis and other viral syndromes. In 2002, the first federally approved vaccine for FIV is based on the team's research.\n\nVeterinary cardiologists Mark Kittleson and Paul Pion and nutrition experts Quinton Rogers and James Morris uncover the link between feline dilated cardiomyopathy, a grave heart ailment, and a dietary deficiency of the amino acid taurine. Adding taurine to commercial cat foods reverses the problem and saves thousands of pets' lives. The fruitful Rogers-Morris collaboration results in multiple initial descriptions of essential amino acids in the feline diet and how nutrition affects the health of cats.\n\n1986\n\nThe Aquatic Health Program directed by David E. Hinton begins a water quality testing service and research on behalf of statewide environmental agencies. Researchers (and future directors) Inge Werner, Swee Teh and a host of technicians participate in dozens of watershed monitoring projects large and small throughout California, including long-range studies such as the DeltaKeeper Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Project and the Sacramento River Watershed Project as well as targeted testing in the Tuolumne River, San Diego Creek, Cache Creek and other waterways. The laboratory analyzes water from multiple sources such as storm runoff and orchard runoff after pesticide applications to determine how different chemicals affect water quality and animal health.\n\n1985\n\nEdward Rhode, veterinary cardiologist/dean emeritus, and imaging specialist William Hornof develop first-pass cardiac imaging of horses using scintigraphy, with emphasis on normal cardiac systolic and diastolic indices. This advance in veterinary cardiology marks the early use of nuclear medicine and alternate imaging in veterinary radiology. Rhode is the first to establish cardiology as a distinct veterinary discipline.\n\nWomen DVM graduates outnumber men for the first time.\n\nDr. Robert Bondurant, large animal veterinarian, pioneers greater understanding of diseases affecting cattle breeding with long-term laboratory investigations and field research on trichomoniasis, which causes abortions and infertility in cattle. He perfects an assay that provides greater precision and speed of test results while eliminating false positives and reducing the cost to producers. Annual losses to the US beef industry from this disease can amount to hundreds of millions of dollars. Bondurant also collaborates with the College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences to establish the bovine embryo transfer program in support of cattle breede\n\n1984\n\nCalvin Schwabe, in his book Veterinary Medicine and Human Health, defines the term \"One Medicine,\" now widely referred to as \"One Health.\" Schwabe, Margaret Meyer and others in the school advocate the integration of veterinary medicine with human and environmental health. Their leadership in epidemiology includes early development of the Master of Preventive Veterinary Medicine degree program for veterinarians.\n\nThe laboratory of Bradford Smith collaborates with Stanford University to develop a modified live, genetically altered Salmonella dublin vaccine for calves, licensed in the United States and available to veterinarians around the world. The faculty member dedicates himself for the next 25 years to investigations of Salmonella and methods for detection, control and prevention. Smith and colleagues describe how Salmonella enters, moves and persists in a cattle herd using antibody tests developed in a specialized laboratory. Smith serves as director of the Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital from 1994 until his retirement in 2007.\n\nDr. Peter Moore, anatomic pathologist, publishes \"Systemic Histiocytosis of Bernese Mountain Dog.\" Moore pioneers investigations and diagnostics of immune system neoplasia, or abnormal cell growth, in dogs and cats. He becomes instrumental to the development of new treatment recommendations for canine lymphoma, leukemia and histiocytic neoplasia. Histiocytic diseases, which include immuno-regulatory disorders and cancer, are most common in Bernese Mountain Dogs, Rottweilers, Flat Coated Retrievers and Golden Retrievers. As the century turns, Moore directs his expertise to the study of leukocyte antigen biology and spontaneous leukocytic diseases of companion animals.\n\nJohn Madigan, Professor of Equine Medicine, launched the state of California’s first Equine Neonatal Critical Care unit at the VMTH, in collaboration with colleagues at SacMed.\n\n1983\n\nThe Veterinary Medical Teaching and Research Center opens in Tulare, meeting the research and clinical needs of producers in the heart of California's dairy industry, the most productive in the nation. The facility emphasizes applied studies, herd health, productivity and environmental stewardship in production agriculture.\n\n1982\n\nJames Cullor and colleague Brad Fenwick, pursue the groundbreaking work on the J5 core antigen concept in swine and dairy cattle under the mentorship of Bennie Osburn. More than three decades later, the J5 core antigen vaccine they developed has been studied in horses, beef cattle, dairy cattle, sheep, goats, llamas, mice, rabbits and aquaculture. It has been shown to be effective in reducing the incidence and severity of Gram-negative bacterial respiratory disease, mastitis, reproduction issues and gastrointestinal diseases. The J5 vaccine saves dairy producers millions of dollars each year by improving animal health, public health, food safety and food security. It is the most widely copied and marketed food animal vaccine to come out of UC Davis.\n\nEdward A. Rhode assumes the duties of dean; he oversees expansion of teaching and research activities as well as construction of facilities, including the Veterinary Medicine Teaching and Research Center strategically located off-site in Tulare.\n\nRandall F. Pritchett initiates the graduate course in molecular biology of animal viruses, paving the way for future scientists to answer basic, important questions about transcription, regulation of genomic expression and other topics just beginning to be explored in the field.\n\n1981\n\nEquine surgeons John Pascoe and Gregory Ferraro publish the single most important insight into the nature of a nearly ubiquitous disorder in heavily exercising racehorses described in veterinary textbooks since 1600. They demonstrate that the disorder, which Pascoe names exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage, originates in the lungs and not in the nose, as had been believed for centuries.\n\n1980"
