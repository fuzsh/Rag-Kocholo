        "text": "Clonality is determined by whether the antibodies come from different B-cells (polyclonal antibodies) or identical B-cells derived from a parent clone (monoclonal antibodies). These antibodies have distinct advantages and limitations covered in Chapter 2.\n\nTo recap, polyclonal antibodies consist of a heterogeneous mixture of antibodies, with each antibody recognizing different epitopes of a particular antigen (Fig. 5, Chapter 2). By binding to several different epitopes, polyclonal antibodies can produce a strong signal against the target antigen in their relevant application and are not biased against a single epitope. However, they are limited in supply, subject to high batch-to-batch variability, and exhibit cross-reactivity and lack of specificity.\n\nIn contrast to polyclonal antibodies, monoclonal antibodies only recognize a single epitope per antigen (Fig. 5, Chapter 2). Monoclonal antibodies have high specificity for their target, low non-specific cross-reactivity, and minimal batch-to-batch variations.\n\nThe term 'recombinant' refers to antibodies produced in vitro using synthetic genes. Compared to traditional monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, recombinant antibodies offer long-term, secured supply with a minimal batch-to-batch variation. Since the antibody-encoding sequence is known and defined, it can be further engineered and manipulated for its intended use.\n\nWe recommend using recombinant monoclonal antibodies when a suitable clone exists for your particular target and application to ensure experimental reproducibility and long-term antibody supply. For applications where a polyclonal antibody would traditionally be used (eg, when analyzing low-abundance targets or detecting multiple post-translational modifications at once), recombinant multiclonal antibodies can offer an ideal solution. Recombinant multiclonal antibodies are a defined mixture of carefully selected individual recombinant monoclonal antibodies designed to recognize different epitopes on the same antigen. So, they can provide excellent sensitivity combined with superior specificity and reproducibility, only available from a recombinant antibody.\n\nIf you intend to perform indirect detection with secondary antibodies, you should ideally choose a primary antibody raised in a different species to your sample. This allows you to avoid cross-reactivity of the secondary (anti-immunoglobulin) antibody with endogenous immunoglobulins in the sample. For instance, if you study a mouse protein, choose a primary antibody raised in a species other than a mouse – eg, rabbit. Since cross-reactivity emerges from the presence of host antibodies in the sample, it's a pitfall for tissue samples but not cell lines.\n\nSuppose you have to use a primary antibody with the same host species as your tissue sample. In that case, you'll need to carefully consider how to modify your protocol to reduce background staining. Alternatively, to avoid cross-reactivity, you can use chimeric antibodies made up of domains from different species.\n\nYou don't need to worry about the primary antibody's host species with applications like western blot that use a cell lysate without any endogenous immunoglobulin (IgG) or direct detection experiments that use primary conjugated antibodies.\n\n1. Choice and preparation of positive and negative controls\n\nIdentifying and using appropriate positive and negative controls is essential for successful antibody validation.\n\n· A positive control is a relevant cell line or tissue sample strongly expressing the target protein of interest that can be used to confirm the selective binding of your antibody.\n\n· A negative control is a cell line or tissue sample that does not express the target protein and, therefore, can provide the data on the non-selective binding properties of your antibody. When a true negative control is not available, a sample expressing low levels of the target proteins can work as an acceptable alternative.\n\nIt's often challenging to determine cell or tissue types that do or do not express the target protein. You can find information about target protein expression in different tissues or cell lines in peer-reviewed papers and online protein databases, including:\n\nProteomics DB\n\nGeneCards\n\nCancer Cell Line Encylopedia\n\nGene (NIH)\n\nProtein Atlas\n\nUniProt\n\nHowever, there are a few limitations to defining protein expression profiles using online databases:\n\nExpression data may not be complete in some cases\n\nIt can be challenging to find negative cell lines or tissues, particularly for essential housekeeping genes.\n\nRNA levels are often very unreliable in determining the quantity of proteins.\n\nFurthermore, antibodies may or may not recognize the protein in its native or denatured state. It is therefore essential to prepare the test samples accordingly. For example, an antibody that recognizes the protein only in its native form should not be used on samples using denaturing conditions, such as western blot.\n\n2. Protocols\n\nEnsure you use an optimized protocol to give the antibody the best chance of passing the validation process. For instance, incubation times can vary dramatically from a minimum of one hour to overnight at 4°C, so you'll need to determine the optimal incubation period for each antibody. If the incubation period is too short, you may encounter sensitivity issues, while prolonged incubation time may lead to background staining. You will also need to optimize other factors, such as working dilutions, blocking conditions, and the use of native vs denatured conditions.\n\n3. The choice of buffers\n\nThe majority of antibody assays will use two buffer types: PBS or TBS. You will need to determine the optimal buffer for your experiment, considering parameters that can influence buffer performance, such as pH.\n\nModels for designing positive and negative controls\n\nCell lines or tissues that endogenously express or lack the target protein can serve as positive or negative controls, respectively. You can use several various cell lines with different protein expression levels to provide a range of controls. Alternatively, appropriate positive and negative controls can be designed using multiple methods, including knock-out models, siRNA knockdown and cell treatment (Table 4).\n\nTable 4. Models for designing appropriate positive and negative controls.\n\nValidating antibody specificity in various applications\n\nYou can use several different methods to validate antibodies. Below we outline some popular applications, their benefits, and limitations.\n\nNote that the two following methods can't be considered exhaustive tests of antibody specificity; therefore, we do not recommend using them alone:\n\n· Blocking with an immunizing peptide can confirm that an antibody binds its immunogen. However, the immunizing peptide will block both specific and non-specific antibodies, so it can't serve as a comprehensive method to confirm antibody specificity.\n\n· Omitting a primary antibody can evaluate the tissue or secondary detection reagents but not the primary antibody specificity.\n\nUpon receiving the antibody, you will need to centrifuge it at 10,000 x g for 20 seconds to pull down the solution trapped in the vial threads and then aliquot it into low-protein-binding microcentrifuge tubes. Aliquotting minimizes damage due to repeated freeze/thaw cycles that can denature an antibody, causing it to form aggregates that reduce its binding capacity. Aliquotting also helps minimize contamination introduced by pipetting from a single vial multiple times.\n\nAliquots should be frozen and thawed once, with any remainder kept at 4°C. It's usually recommended to store antibodies at -20°C as there's no significant advantage to storing them at -80°C.\n\nThe size of the aliquots will depend on how much you typically use in an experiment. Aliquots should be no smaller than 10 μL. The smaller the aliquot, the more the stock concentration is affected by evaporation and adsorption of the antibody onto the surface of the storage vial.\n\nIn most cases, storage at 4°C upon receiving the antibody is acceptable for one to two weeks. It is essential to follow the recommendations on the datasheet.\n\nMake sure not to use a frost-free freezer: it's unlikely your lab would, but the cycling between freezing and thawing should be avoided. For the same reason, antibody vials should be placed in the freezer area with minimal temperature fluctuations, for instance, towards the back rather than on a door shelf.\n\nSome researchers add the cryoprotectant glycerol to a final concentration of 50% to prevent freeze/thaw damage because glycerol lowers the freezing point to below -20°C. While this may be acceptable for many antibodies, you should check the datasheet to see if the manufacturer tested antibody stability in this storage condition.\n\nStoring solutions with glycerol at -80°C is not advised since this is below the freezing point of glycerol. Also, glycerol or any other cryoprotectant can be contaminated with bacteria, so you must obtain a sterile preparation.\n\nConjugated antibodies often require additional storage and handling precautions since they're more complicated than non-conjugated antibodies. For example, conjugated antibodies – whether conjugated to fluorochromes, enzymes, or biotin – should be stored in dark vials or wrapped in foil because exposure to light will compromise conjugates' activity. Fluorescent conjugates, in particular, are susceptible to photo-bleaching and should be protected from light during all phases of an experiment.\n\nTable 6 below provides the detailed guidelines for proper conjugated antibody storage and handling.\n\nTable 6. Handling, aliquoting, and storage guidelines for conjugated antibodies.\n\n*Freezing and thawing enzyme-conjugated antibodies will reduce enzymatic activity and affect the antibody binding capacity. Therefore, enzyme-conjugated antibodies should not be frozen at all and should instead be kept at 4°C unless an antibody contains a cryoprotectant, and its stability has been validated for long-term storage at -20°C.\n\nThe optimal antibody concentration, which gives the best staining with minimum background, must be determined experimentally for each assay and is usually determined using a series of dilutions in a titration experiment. For example, if a product datasheet suggests using a 1:200 dilution, it is recommended to make dilutions of 1:50, 1:100, 1:200, 1:400 and 1:500.\n\nA titration experiment is done by first selecting a fixed incubation time and then a series of experimental dilutions of the antibody. Each dilution should be tested on the same sample type to keep the same experimental conditions.\n\nMany antibodies will have similar batch-to-batch consistency; therefore, only one titration experiment is required in most cases. However, especially for polyclonal antibodies, when there is a change in the staining results between batches of the same antibody, we recommend performing another titration experiment."
