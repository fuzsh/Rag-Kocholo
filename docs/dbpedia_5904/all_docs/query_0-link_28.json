Using a combination of neural cell lines, skin fibroblasts from AD patients, and ApoE targeted replacement mouse brains, we show in the present report that ApoE4 undergoes nuclear translocation, binds double-stranded DNA with high affinity (low nanomolar), and functions as a transcription factor. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation and high-throughput DNA sequencing, our results indicate that the ApoE4 DNA binding sites include ∼1700 gene promoter regions. The genes associated with these promoters provide new insight into the mechanism by which AD risk is conferred by ApoE4, because they include genes associated with trophic support, programmed cell death, microtubule disassembly, synaptic function, aging, and insulin resistance, all processes that have been implicated in AD pathogenesis.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT This study shows for the first time that apolipoprotein E4 binds DNA with high affinity and that its binding sites include 1700 promoter regions that include genes associated with neurotrophins, programmed cell death, synaptic function, sirtuins and aging, and insulin resistance, all processes that have been implicated in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.",

        "text": "Results\n\nApoE4-mediated reduction in ADAM10 expression and pharmacological reversal of SirT1 expression and activity\n\nRecent studies point to SirT1 as an inducer of transcription of ADAM10. Mechanistically, SirT1 increases sAPPα by increasing α-secretase activity through activation of the α-secretase gene ADAM10 (Qin et al., 2006; Donmez, 2013). Our previous report demonstrated that ApoE4, but not ApoE3, significantly reduced sAPPα secretion, SirT1 mRNA, and protein (Theendakara et al., 2013). To investigate what role ApoE has on ADAM10 expression, we performed quantitative real-time PCR in A172 human glioblastoma cells transfected with ApoE cDNA constructs. Our results indicated a significant downregulation of ADAM10 mRNA by ApoE4 (Fig. 1A) compared with ApoE3 (data not shown). The ApoE4-mediated reduction in ADAM10 may have contributed to the observed reduction in the levels of neuroprotective sAPPα (Theendakara et al., 2013).\n\nTo determine whether the ApoE4-mediated reduction in SirT1 mRNA or SirT1 enzyme activity could be reversed by therapeutic candidates, A172 human glioblastoma cells were transfected with ApoE4 cDNA construct and, 24 h later, treated with various drugs (2 μm) from a CNS-focused library (∼10,000 compounds). ApoE4-mediated reduction in SirT1 enzyme activity (Fig. 1B) and mRNA (Fig. 1C) was reversed (significantly, in some cases) by a subset of the drugs, including 13B5 (riboflavin), 5B6 (clonidine), and 10H7 (alaproclate; Fig. 1B,C).\n\nApoE binds to the SirT1 promoter\n\nThe abovementioned results prompted us to examine whether there was any direct association of the ApoE isoforms with SirT1. A172 cells were transiently transfected with the FLAG–SirT1 construct together with ApoE isoforms. IP of FLAG–SirT1 from the lysates did not reveal any association of SirT1 with ApoE3 or ApoE4 (Fig. 2A). Because we were unable to identify any protein–protein interaction between ApoE and SirT1 and to further explore the ApoE-mediated reduction in SirT1 expression, we evaluated the possibility that ApoE binds to the SirT1 promoter and regulates its activity. The 2.2 kb human SirT1–pEGFP and SirT1–luciferase reporter vectors together with ApoE constructs were used for transfecting cells. Because E2 (17-β-estradiol) binds to its specific receptor, estrogen receptor α, and induces the expression of SirT1, we used E2 (10 nm) as a positive regulator of SirT1 expression. SirT1 expression was very low in untreated A172 cells (Fig. 2B, top left); however, the addition of 10 nm E2 significantly increased the SirT1 promoter-specific EGFP fluorescence (Fig. 2B, top right, C). Although E2-induced SirT1–EGFP fluorescence was reduced in cells transfected with ApoE3 (Fig. 2B, bottom left, C), it was significantly suppressed only by ApoE4 (Fig. 2B, bottom right, C).\n\nSimilarly, the basal SirT1–luciferase activity was significantly reduced by ∼40% in SHSY5Y human neuroblastoma cells cotransfected with an expression construct for ApoE3 and by ∼60% in cells cotransfected with the ApoE4 construct (Fig. 2D), both of which were statistically significant. However, the reduction in SirT1–luciferase activity by ApoE4 was significantly greater compared with ApoE3 (Fig. 2D, ApoE3 vs ApoE4, *p < 0.05). Thus, both isoforms of ApoE affect SirT1 expression at the transcriptional level, with ApoE4 being more effective than ApoE3.\n\nTo investigate the transcriptional effect of ApoE on SirT1 expression, we performed ChIP. SHSY5Y cells transfected with ApoE4 cDNA were lysed, and IP was performed with an antibody that recognizes all three isoforms of ApoE. The genomic DNA present in the immunoprecipitates was analyzed by PCR using SirT1 promoter-specific primers. A ∼250 bp band corresponding to the SirT1 promoter was present only in the cell fraction that received the ApoE antibody (Fig. 2E), suggesting that ApoE4 interacts with the SirT1 promoter and thus may regulate its activity transcriptionally.\n\nBecause the abovementioned results reflect interactions between Sirt1 and ApoE4 that came from transfection and an overexpression system, we repeated these observations in human skin fibroblasts derived from AD patients. Fibroblasts from two patients (patient 04402 ApoE3/E4 and patient 21158 ApoE2/E3) were lysed, and IP was performed as mentioned above. The genomic DNA present in the immunoprecipitates was analyzed by PCR using SirT1 promoter-specific primers. A ∼250 bp band corresponding to the SirT1 promoter was detected only in the samples that received the ApoE antibody (Fig. 2F). Our rationale was to determine whether an ApoE–SirT1 interaction occurs in an in vivo setting as well, and, in both cases (ApoE 2/3 and ApoE 3/4), this interaction was observed, suggesting a physiological interaction of ApoE with the SirT1 promoter.\n\nInteraction of ApoE and SirT1 promoter by surface plasmon resonance\n\nWe also confirmed the interaction of both ApoE isoforms and the SirT1 promoter by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) by measuring the binding of recombinant ApoE isoforms with single-stranded, single-stranded complement, and double-stranded DNA segments of the larger ∼250 bp SirT1 promoter sequence. Of the nine different segments of the promoter tested (Tables 1, 2), both ApoE isoforms bound avidly only to a 30-base double-stranded segment, cagcctccgcccgccacgtgacccgtagtg, of the SirT1 promoter. Both ApoE3 and ApoE4 bound with an estimated KD of 3 nm (Fig. 3A,B). Addition of 34 nm ApoE3 (Fig. 3C) or ApoE4 (Fig. 3D) significantly decreased the binding to the double-stranded SirT1 promoter sequence, consistent with a high-affinity specific interaction between the double-stranded segment of the SirT1 promoter sequence and the anchored ApoE isoforms (Table 2). Neither ApoE3 nor ApoE4 showed significant binding to the single-stranded DNA sequence of the segment or its complement or a double-stranded scrambled sequence with the same base composition as the segment (Fig. 3E; Tables 1, 2). Eight other DNA sequences were tested from the ∼250 bp SirT1 promoter sequence, and all showed similar sensograms to the scrambled peptide (Table 1), indicating no significant binding.\n\nSubcellular localization of ApoE\n\nOur previous report (Theendakara et al., 2013) together with the abovementioned results suggested that ApoE may enter the nucleus and bind to SirT1 DNA. Thus, the results prompted us to examine the subcellular localization of ApoE. Because SirT1 is also known to shuttle to the cytoplasm and affect neuronal differentiation and neurite outgrowth (Herskovits and Guarente, 2014), we also examined the cellular distribution of SirT1. Cell lysates from untransfected and ApoE-transfected cells were fractionated into nuclear and soluble (cytosolic) fractions and analyzed by Western blotting. The quality of the fractionation experiments was controlled by assessing the distribution of PARP, a nuclear protein. Although both ApoE3 and ApoE4 predominantly existed in the cytosolic fraction, a subpopulation of both isoforms was present in the nuclear fraction as well (Fig. 4A,B). SirT1 is predominantly a nuclear protein (Fig. 4), and its expression was significantly reduced in ApoE3- or ApoE4-transfected cells (Fig. 4A,C) as we reported previously (Theendakara et al., 2013). However, the subcellular distribution of SirT1 was found to be ApoE isoform specific: only ApoE4 expression led to the redistribution of a subpopulation of SirT1 into the cytosolic fraction, with some remaining in the nuclear fraction as well. ApoE4 triggered nearly a sixfold increase in the levels of cytosolic SirT1, although this did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 4C). ApoE3 did not trigger any SirT1 redistribution. Thus, the presence of ApoE3 and ApoE4 in the nucleus is compatible with their binding to the SirT1 promoter and regulating SirT1 transcription; in addition, ApoE4 mediates the redistribution of SirT1 to the cytosol.\n\nGenome-wide mapping of ApoE binding\n\nBecause ApoE3 and ApoE4 affect SirT1 expression at the transcriptional level and to explore further the ApoE–SirT1 promoter interaction, we performed ChIP-seq to assess ApoE3 and ApoE4 binding on a genome-wide scale. The start and end sites of the peak corresponding to the SirT1 gene (Fig. 5A) from the ChIP-seq encompasses an ∼950 bp region that includes the following: (1) the primer pair sequences that was used for the ChIP; (2) the DNA fragment, cagcctccgcccgccacgtgacccgtagtg, that bound to ApoE on SPR (Fig. 3A,B); (3) the sequence, ccgccacgtga, within the ApoE binding region that binds other transcription factors, including upstream transcription factor 1 (USF-1) and retinoic acid receptor α (RARα); (4) at least two sequences, aagttgagaa and tgggtggcgggag, within the ∼250 bp promoter sequence and in the vicinity of the ApoE binding region that overlap with regions on the ApoD promoter (Do Carmo et al., 2002; Levros et al., 2013); and (5) the sequence, ccacaaagagg, that may be a putative serum responsive element as well as other notable features described below.\n\nStatistically significant ChIP-enriched regions (peaks) were identified by comparison with a Poisson background model, using a p value threshold of 10−5. The peaks in samples were annotated by the nearest gene using the newest UCSC RefSeq database and were found to be located within −2 to +2 kb around the corresponding transcriptional start site (TSS). The peaks were subgrouped into five classes on the basis of their distances to the UCSC RefSeq gene (http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway) and included promoters, upstream, introns, exons, and intergenic peaks (Fig. 5B). Promoters were defined as 2000 bp upstream and downstream from the TSS. Peaks whose centers were located in these promoter regions were defined as promoter peaks. Of a total of 3080 promoter peaks examined, ∼1700 were found to be associated with ApoE4 but not ApoE3, and National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) gene database and simple PubMed-based literature searches were used to identify genes exclusive to ApoE4 with potential involvement in AD. This approach led to the identification of 76 genes (Table 3) and included among them SirT1, which was independently re-identified in this assay.\n\nSeveral of the 76 identified genes (Table 3) have been implicated in AD and could be grouped broadly into the following classes: (1) axon guidance; (2) neuronal signaling; (3) diabetes, glucose metabolism, and energy homeostasis; (4) inflammation (specifically NFκB), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and cytokine signaling; and (5) neurotrophins and neuronal cell death. The findings reinforce the role of ApoE4 in several key areas that have been shown to contribute to AD pathophysiology. Based on the genomic findings, we then used a combination of techniques to confirm the involvement of three potential candidates in AD.\n\nMADD is a component of the TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) signaling complex, linking TNFR1 activation with downstream MAP kinase activity. MADD expression has been shown to be reduced in the hippocampus in areas of AD pathology compared with normal controls. Similarly, in AD brain homogenates, MADD protein and mRNA expression were significantly reduced in AD compared with controls, with a concomitant increase in TNF receptor-associated death domain, TNFR1, and activated c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (Del Villar and Miller, 2004).\n\nADNP plays an essential role in brain development and autophagy and is expressed predominantly in the cerebellum, hippocampus, and cerebral cortex (Fernandez-Montesinos et al., 2010). In mouse models of AD, ADNP is highly expressed during early or mild stages of AD. ADNP may have an important neuroprotective role in response to neuronal damage during the onset and progression of AD. A peptide derived from ADNP is currently in clinical development for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders (Quintana et al., 2006).\n\nCOMMD6 belongs to the COMMD family of proteins that share a common COMM domain at the C terminus, which facilitates protein–protein interactions. COMMD6 associates with the RelA subunit of NFκB complex and inhibits NFκB-mediated transcriptional activation in the nucleus (de Bie et al., 2006).\n\nTo investigate what role ApoE has on the expression of these genes, we performed quantitative real-time PCR and also assessed protein levels in lysates from A172 cells transfected with ApoE3 or ApoE4 (Fig. 6). For all three genes, ApoE4 effected a statistically significant reduction at the protein level (Fig. 6A,B). These reductions were also reflected at the mRNA level, although for ADNP the mRNA reduction did not reach statistical significance, and, for all three, there was some (albeit lesser for ADNP and COMMD6) reduction in mRNA induced by ApoE3 as well (Fig. 6C). These results suggest that ApoE4 exerts transcriptionally repressive effects at four promoters (MADD, ADNP, COMMD6, and SirT1) and leave open the possibility that posttranscriptional effects may also contribute to the marked reduction in protein level.\n\nThe expression of these proteins was also studied by immunohistochemistry on 7-month-old ApoE3/3 and ApoE4/4 TR mouse brain sections. Immunohistochemical labeling of MADD and ADNP revealed greater expression of these proteins in the septal region of brains from ApoE3 TR mice compared with ApoE4 TR mice (Fig. 6D). COMMD6 appeared to be comparatively higher in ApoE3 mice, although labeling was not as intense for this protein.\n\nSimilarly, immunohistochemical labeling of MADD in the dentate gyrus of 18-month-old ApoE4 TR mice showed clear reduction in expression compared with ApoE3 TR mice. No difference in ADNP expression was observed in ApoE3 and ApoE4 TR mice, although COMMD6 expression did not reach the level of detection (Fig. 6E).\n\nDifferential effects of ApoE on RelA binding, distribution, and associated gene expression\n\nTwo of the genes described above, namely MADD and COMMD6, are known to regulate transcription by binding to the NFκB complex or the RelA subunit of the complex (Del Villar and Miller, 2004; de Bie et al., 2006). Similarly, the 8 aa neuroprotective peptide NAP, derived from ADNP, downregulates key inflammatory cytokines, including TNF, IL16, and IL12 in macrophages, indicating its role in immune regulation and neuroprotection (Quintana et al., 2006; Fernandez-Montesinos et al., 2010). Additionally, recent studies have described a mutual antagonism between RelA and SirT1 in favor of inflammation through downregulation of SirT1 (Hwang et al., 2013; Kauppinen et al., 2013). Furthermore, the analysis of the ∼250 bp SirT1 promoter sequence using the web server LASAGNA-Search version 2.0 revealed an NFκB–RelA binding site, acgtggaaattccca, ∼200 bp upstream of the ApoE binding region (Fig. 5A). This is in addition to the sequence ccgccacgtga within the ApoE binding region that served as a binding site for other transcription factors, including USF-1 and RARα (Du et al., 1998; Chen et al., 2005a; Isotalo et al., 2012; Kawahara et al., 2014).\n\nThe abovementioned analysis coupled with the finding that ApoE4 downregulates SirT1, MADD, ADNP, and COMMD6 levels led us to investigate specifically the role of ApoE on RelA binding, expression, and subcellular localization. Cell lysates from untransfected and ApoE-transfected cells were fractionated into nuclear and soluble (cytosolic) fractions and analyzed by Western blotting. Expression of ApoE4 was associated with a redistribution of the majority of RelA from the cytosol to the nucleus, whereas the expression of ApoE3 had no effect on RelA distribution, with the vast majority remaining cytosolic (Fig. 7A). This marked effect of ApoE4 on the RelA intracellular distribution raised the question of whether these two proteins may interact directly. IP of endogenous RelA from SHSY5Y cell lysates obtained after transient transfection of ApoE isoforms provided evidence of association between ApoE isoforms and RelA (Fig. 7B). Thus, although RelA coimmunoprecipitated with both ApoE3 and ApoE4, only ApoE4 led to the translocation of RelA into the nucleus.\n\nWe also evaluated the interaction of ApoE and the putative RelA-binding region, acgtggaaattccca, on the SirT1 promoter by SPR. Neither ApoE isoform displayed binding to the RelA target DNA sequence (Fig. 7C; Table 1). Because both ApoE3 and ApoE4 coimmunoprecipitated with RelA, we evaluated this interaction further by SPR using protein fragments of RelA. GST–RelA(365-551) fusion protein bound strongly to both ApoE isoforms, with an estimated KD of 30 nm (Fig. 7D,E). No significant binding was observed with ApoE3 or ApoE4 and GST–RelA(1-180) (Fig. 7F) at similar concentrations, suggesting the specificity of the binding of both ApoE isoforms to the C-terminal region of RelA.\n\nThe interaction of ApoE isoforms with RelA raised the question of whether the presence of ApoE affects NFκB-dependent gene transcription. To understand this better, we assessed the levels of several cytokines after transfecting A172 cells with ApoE3 or ApoE4. Additionally, cell lysates were also examined for cytokine expression by Western blotting. We focused on IL6 and IL8 because these two cytokines showed consistent results. Transfection of ApoE4 resulted in a significant elevation in IL6 levels compared with ApoE3 (Fig. 8A). Although there was a threefold increase in IL8 levels in ApoE4-transfected cells compared with ApoE3, this did not reach statistical significance. Furthermore, transfection of ApoE4 resulted in a significant elevation in IL6 and IL8 expression by Western blot analysis compared with ApoE3 (Fig. 8B). By analogy to previous studies that have shown the role of NFκB–RelA complex in modulating IL6 and IL8 levels through the transcriptional modulator TIP60 (Matsusaka et al., 1993; Kim et al., 2012), it is possible that the ApoE4–RelA complex transcriptionally activates the expression of inflammatory cytokines, including IL6 and IL8, similarly to RelA/TIP60.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe apolipoprotein E ε4 allele is the single most important genetic risk factor associated with AD. Recently, we showed that ApoE4 expression is associated with a marked reduction in SirT1 levels, in both cultured neural cells and the brains of patients with AD (Theendakara et al., 2013). Furthermore, in addition to the overall reduction in SirT1 protein expression, our present results showed a subpopulation of SirT1 in the cytosolic fraction only in ApoE4-transfected cells, suggesting that ApoE4 (but not ApoE3) causes the redistribution of SirT1 into the cytosolic fraction. This effect may be attributable, at least in part, to cellular stress, including physiological and pathological stimuli triggered by ApoE4. Because SirT1 has been implicated in neuroprotection, this effect of ApoE4 may be important from both mechanistic and therapeutic development standpoints. SirT1 has been shown to be a transcriptional activator of the α-secretase ADAM10 gene, resulting in increased levels of the neuroprotective sAPPα peptide (Lee et al., 2014). Although SirT1 is believed to be a nuclear protein, its presence in the cytosolic compartment has also been reported (Herskovits and Guarente, 2014). Although the significance of the cytoplasmic localization of SirT1 is not clear, it is possible that cytosolic SirT1 may modulate cytoplasmic proteins or trophic mediators that are involved in nerve growth and differentiation. A recent study has shown that cytosolic SirT1 interacts with the Ras GTPase superfamily and regulates axonal growth (Law et al., 2009). Interestingly, although both ApoE3 and ApoE4 bound to SirT1 promoter with similar binding affinities, only ApoE4 triggered the redistribution of SirT1 to the cytosol. We do not know that the same KD of ApoE3 and ApoE4 for DNA has any relevance for differential nuclear localization because that is an event that happens after the ApoE enters the nucleus. Similarly, it is also not clear whether DNA binding plays a significant role in stabilizing the nuclear population of ApoE and SirT1. Differential SirT1 nuclear localization could also be influenced by other events in the cytoplasm or the nucleus that control the rate of the entry and exit of ApoE from the nucleus.\n\nAlthough both ApoE3 and ApoE4 predominantly existed in the cytosolic fraction, a subpopulation of both isoforms was present in the nuclear fraction as well. The mechanism by which ApoE isoforms escape the secretory pathway and translocate to the cytosol or the nucleus is currently unclear. ApoE4 is known to trigger endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and cell death (Zhong et al., 2009; Cash et al., 2012; Theendakara et al., 2013), and several reports have suggested that ER stress can result in mislocalization of proteins, resulting in their redistribution to the cytosol and nucleus (Rao and Bredesen, 2004; Drori et al., 2010; Miesbauer et al., 2010). Cancer cells are particularly prone to ER stress and mislocalization of proteins, with ER stress contributing to either survival or apoptosis of cancer cells, depending on the setting (Wang and Kaufman, 2014). Interestingly, several reports have described a positive correlation of cytosolic/nuclear ApoE immunoreactivity and clinical aggressiveness in prostate and ovarian cancers (Venanzoni et al., 2003; Chen et al., 2005b). From the cytosol, both ApoE isoforms could be transported into the nucleus by binding to specific nuclear proteins through their weak polybasic domains that could serve as potential nuclear signaling sequences (NLSs; Kim et al., 2008; Levros et al., 2013). Additionally, ApoE4 might also be ferried into the nucleus through its interaction with RelA as explained in a later section.\n\nUsing ChIP assay and SPR, we showed that ApoE not only binds to the SirT1 promoter with high affinity but also represses promoter activity, suggesting a plausible role for ApoE4 in the nucleus as a transcriptional repressor in at least some settings. This conclusion is supported by the finding that three other genes—MADD, ADNP, and COMMD6—whose promoters also interact with ApoE4 based on ChIP-seq data all show reduced transcription in the presence of ApoE4 (and, to a lesser extent, in the presence of ApoE3). However, we have not yet analyzed the interaction of ApoE with all of the gene promoters to fully substantiate the role of ApoE as a transcriptional repressor. Thus, although the direct effects of ApoE4 on transcription of the small number of genes studied to date reveal only repressive effects, we cannot yet exclude the possibility that ApoE may in some cases turn out, with or without additional complex members (e.g., RelA), to function as a transcriptional activator.\n\nIn a report on the astrocyte transcriptome, Simpson et al. (2011) identified 237 genes that were differentially regulated in association with ApoE4. Of these 237 genes, ApoE4 triggered directly or indirectly the downregulation of 164 genes, whereas the remainder was upregulated. These 237 genes were categorized into six functional groups and included genes associated with signaling pathways, the cytoskeleton, DNA damage, metabolism, transcription, and the immune response (Simpson et al., 2011). Some of these groups matched with the functional groups that we categorized from our ChIP-seq studies and within these groups, we noticed few similar genes as well.\n\nAlthough the presence of ApoE in the nucleus has already been demonstrated in several cell types and tissues (Panin et al., 2000; Chen et al., 2005b; Levros et al., 2013), its underlying role in the nucleus remains unclear. A recent study demonstrated the entry of ApoE and ApoD into the nucleus under stress conditions, with ApoE binding constitutively to the ApoD promoter and repressing it in vivo (Levros et al., 2013). ApoE and ApoD promoters share regions, including the serum response elements characterized by two C residues, followed by a run of six residues that can be either A or T and then followed by an additional two G residues (Do Carmo et al., 2002). We noticed within the ∼250 bp SirT1 promoter region the sequence ccacaaagagg that may be a putative serum response element. Furthermore, we also identified three sequences on the SirT1 promoter (aagttgagaa and tgggtggcgggag within the ∼250 bp promoter sequence and in the vicinity of the ApoE binding region and ggcggaccaaaa adjacent to the RelA binding site), all of which overlap with regions on the ApoD promoter. All of these results indicate that the ∼250 bp SirT1 promoter region may be an important binding site for transcription factors, including ApoE.\n\nOur studies also clearly demonstrate the role of ApoE as a DNA binding protein and transcriptional regulator of multiple genes. The estimated binding affinity of ApoE3 and ApoE4 is in the range of known transcription factors and is ∼10 nm (Majka and Speck, 2007; Jantz and Berg, 2010). Both ApoE isoforms do not have high sequence similarity to the classical DNA binding proteins but do contain the helix–loop–helix secondary structure, as well as a high arginine content, found in many DNA-binding proteins. Binding of arginine residues to phosphate is very strong, and DNA-binding proteins use arginine to make critical interactions with the DNA backbone (Rohs et al., 2010). Because of its high arginine content, ApoE was originally named the arginine-rich protein (Danielsson et al., 1978), and these Arg residues might conceivably facilitate ApoE–DNA interaction.\n\nThe SPR experiments that we reported were performed with partially lipidated ApoE that exists as a mixture of monomeric-, tetrameric-, and octomeric-sized complexes in rapid equilibrium (Perugini et al., 2000). ApoE3 tends to form more of the larger oligomers than ApoE4, and this effect can be seen by comparing Figure 3, A and B. The difference in the maximal RUs achieved for the same concentration of ApoE3 and ApoE4 indicates that the average ApoE3 oligomer binds more DNA than the average ApoE4 oligomer binding to the chip. Although it is true that ApoE3 and ApoE4 are known to change structures depending on how much lipid is associated with the protein (Hatters et al., 2006; Peters-Libeu et al., 2006), it is likely that several different conformations of both ApoE3 and ApoE4 were present in our system. Because the kinetics of binding of ApoE3 or ApoE4 to DNA was not significantly different, our data are consistent with the notion that the DNA binding site on ApoE is not influenced by either the sequence variation or the oligomerization state but by a different distribution of oligomers.\n\nIn our study, a fraction of both ApoE3 and ApoE4 underwent nuclear translocation and binding to the SirT1 promoter. Using ChIP-seq analysis, we identified ∼1700 promoter peaks that were found to be unique to ApoE4, of which 76 have been implicated previously in AD. The 76 genes (Table 3) included SirT1, which was independently re-identified in this assay. These genes could be grouped broadly into the following classes: (1) axon guidance; (2) neuronal signaling; (3) diabetes, glucose metabolism, and energy homeostasis; (4) inflammation; and (5) neurotrophins and neuronal cell death. Some of these functional groups were similar to the gene clusters in the astrocyte transcriptome, and also included a few similar genes (Simpson et al., 2011).\n\nThree of the genes that we identified from the ChIP-seq, namely MADD, ADNP, and COMMD6 (Del Villar and Miller, 2004; Quintana et al., 2006; de Bie et al., 2006; Fernandez-Montesinos et al., 2010), were evaluated further, and all were observed to be repressed. There was a significant reduction in mRNA and protein levels of all three genes only in ApoE4-transfected cells compared with ApoE3-transfected cells or untransfected cells. Additionally, immunohistochemical labeling of MADD, ADNP, and COMMD6 revealed greater expression of these proteins in the septal region of brains from 7-month-old ApoE3 TR mice compared with ApoE4 TR mice. Although MADD and COMMD6 regulate transcription by binding to the NFκB complex or RelA, respectively, ADNP functions as both an anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory gene. Thus, the protein products of all three genes affect the inflammatory response, and, in each case, repression by ApoE4 would be expected to trigger inflammation and cell death.\n\nThe involvement of these three genes in inflammation and the fact that there is a mutual antagonism between RelA and SirT1 (Kauppinen et al., 2013) led us to investigate the relationship between ApoE and RelA. Although RelA bound to both ApoE3 and ApoE4, interestingly, only ApoE4 binding led to the translocation of RelA into the nucleus; thus, this may also be one of the mechanisms by which ApoE4 enters the nucleus, especially if the ApoE4–RelA interaction led to the exposure of the RelA NLS. It is not yet clear whether ApoE4 affects the NFκB–inhibitor of nuclear factor-κB interaction or uses some other mechanism to trigger the nuclear translocation of RelA. It is also not yet clear whether ApoE4 modulates the transcriptional effects of NFκB directly. In any case, however, ApoE4 induces a proinflammatory state that is mediated at least in part by NFκB, and this includes a significant elevation of proinflammatory cytokines IL6 and IL8, which are also associated with the pathological changes found in AD (Finch and Morgan, 2007; Finch, 2010).\n\nThe network of genes whose promoters bind ApoE4 suggests a fundamental cellular reprogramming, including downregulation of MADD, ADNP, and COMMD6 and a consequent elevation of IL6 and IL8 by ApoE4 (among many other effects), all of which could participate in triggering the inflammatory and apoptotic pathways associated with AD pathophysiology. Our results regarding ApoE–SirT1 promoter interaction in human fibroblasts isolated from AD patients and the downregulation of a subset of genes specifically in the ApoE4/4 TR young and old mouse brains together with our previous observation of a significant reduction in SirT1 levels in ApoE4-positive postmortem human AD brains (Theendakara et al., 2013), all suggest a physiological role of ApoE as a transcription factor and most likely as a transcriptional repressor.\n\nThus, our work provides new insight into the mechanism by which ApoE4 may achieve its diverse and robust effects on lifespan, cardiovascular disease, inflammation, and neurodegeneration. Our work also offers a medium-throughput model for screening drug candidates that will not only influence the onset or progression of AD by targeting the interaction between ApoE4–SirT1 and ApoE4–RelA but also modulate lifespan by rescuing SirT1 levels potentially affecting the normal aging process and mediating other metabolic events."
