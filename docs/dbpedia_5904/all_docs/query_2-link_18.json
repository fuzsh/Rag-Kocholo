It’s…it’s dead man!”. Not by the actual members at least. Tree Of Shame is not a symbol or signal of the end either. Everyone simply got busy doing their own things. Greg and Jason just got busy doing their own thing together is all.\n\nThe members of Nuclear Rabbit are all still friends. We don’t hate each other (yet).\n\nThanks for all your love, loyalty and support!\n\nTHE END”"
