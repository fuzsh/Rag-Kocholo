        "text": "Nuclear Rabbit & Bumpin' Uglies Dec 4 Harrington's -For The Synthesis Magazine, Chico, CA\n\nNuclear Rabbit are an amazingly innovative, wholly engaging and firey quartet....The Rabbit are: Greg Parrish (vocals), Jean Baudin (bass), Steve \"Stymie\" Sigaty (percussion), and Jason Branyan (guitar). Their sound was born of a strange army of musical influences:\n\n\"In a large skillet, lightly saute hardcore and hiphop rhythms over low heat. Add death metal, jazz, and ska styles, stirring occasionally. While the sauce is still simmering, dash the concoction with a pingent of punk, noisecore, surf, and funk until golden brown. Season with an insane cartoon from another planet. Serve. \" --description of Nuclear Rabbit from their website\n\nOne of the things I like most about Nuclear Rabbit is their uncanny ability to intertwine tempos seamlessly. Just when you think you've finally grasped a rhythm that you can hold on to, the auditory rope\n\nslips through your hands, and the changes creep in, undetected. Their tempo transformations are exceptionally graceful. They are especially refreshing because this is hard music.\n\nThe men of Nuclear Rabbit are as much animated showmen as they are talented and serious musicians. It is obvious to even the rookie observer that they have been honing their craft for years. This craft includes their stage presence. \"Stymie\" aka Steve Sigaty plays the skins with more stealth and enthusiasm than yo mamma on her way to Baskin Robbin's. Jean Baudin (bassist) ripped his shorts while jaunting around onstage. Greg Parrish, the vocalist, put in 100%, often prowling around the stage in circles, sucessfully engaging the audience in his monstrous serenade.\n\nIf you are interested in sampling or buying Nuclear Rabbit's music, make a cyber-trip to their website at www.nuclearrabbit.com. Two of the band's CDs, Vicuna and Intestinal Fortitude are now available via this site. Vicuna is mainly a compilation of the Rabbit's older demo tapes, and is quite a bargain at $10, as it has 27 rippin' tracks. Intestinal Fortitude, the Rabbit's brand new CD, is offered at the same price. Check out Nuclear Rabbit, because this band is tighter than your Aunt Bessie's wallet at Christmas time.\n\n.\n\nAfter the Rabbit left the stage, Chico's own Bumpin' Uglies took the spotlight. The Bumpin' Uglies are three: Jeremy Fritschy (stand-up bass, bass), James Dolan (guitar), and Dave Knogle (percussion). Their hodgepodge of musical influences span from the obscure and bizarre Mr. Bungle to the better-known Red Hot Chili Peppers. The Bumpin' Uglies articulate their aural style well at their website's bio page, deeming themselves \"Bumpin' psycho funk, smoothed out by a heavy hip-hop beat.\" Even though the Bumpin' Uglies have only been together for about a year, they have developed quite a following around town. Because the Uglies are still a young group, their sound and style may still be developing, so I believe that the best is still yet to come. Their debut CD, What the Hell? is now available.
