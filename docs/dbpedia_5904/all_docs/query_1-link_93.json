        "text": "2 years ago this week, I said goodbye to Nuclear Power. 2 years is a big deal too . . . no more hope of coming back to Nuclear Power without a redo of License Class as an SRO, an 18 month process. Time flies. So what's it like 2 years later - different. Different than what I thought it would be. For me the difference is good, but there are definitely cons. #1 Con - Less Money. My disposable income is pretty small, that will likely change over time, but it has been a tough adaptation. #2 Con - leading teams and individuals is pretty much zero. I can cope with #1 - I have always been smart with my money - stay within a budget, don't buy on credit, put some away for a rainy day. I was fortunate to have had a great job that paid very well and put some money to the side that has allowed the transition to be less stressful and painful. #2 - more difficult to cope. As a worker of one mainly, I have very few opportunities to lead - though helping clients realize their dreams and projects is still rewarding, It doesn't compare to the comrade that exists in operations that involve teams, especially when everything is firing on all cylinders. The positives - #1 Time. I have control of my time. I haven't missed a sporting event for my kids, I'm home every night, I sleep when I want to sleep, I wake up when I wake up, no more alarms (still pretty early but not 315am). #2 - health. My mental and physical health have improved greatly. Shift work and lack of sleep can wreck you, it's amazing how much better I feel today and how much having control of #1 can help you. The next couple years will bring new challenges, I look forward to reflecting on the pros and cons again and seeing the progress I have made."
