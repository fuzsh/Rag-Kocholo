        "text": "Dog Fashion Disco is an American heavy metal band from Rockville, Maryland, that was originally active from 1995 to 2007 before disbanding. The band officially reunited on October 10, 2013.\n\nCombining many different music styles (1960s psychedelic, jazz, piano recital, heavy metal, circus music and vocals, among others) Dog Fashion Disco is primarily considered an avant-garde metal and alternative metal band. The band's lyrical content is often highly esoteric and satirical, with constant tongue-in-cheek references to the occult, drug use, and mutilation. Their sound has often been compared to the Northern California genre-defying act, Mr. Bungle. The band members themselves have cited their collective influences as being Mike Patton (Mr. Bungle, Faith No More), Clutch, Tool, System of a Down and Frank Zappa."
