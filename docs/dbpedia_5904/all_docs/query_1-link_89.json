        "text": "Hey, Breathing The Core fans, here we bring you another interview of the Metal/Hardcore band Tree Of Shame from USA, so here you can see and give a like to his FACEBOOK PAGE. We have nothing more to say, so enjoy this interview!\n\n1. Where did you get the idea for the band name, you planned it or came out just like that?\n\nFunny story actually. Our singer Greg’s daughter has a toy that sings a song with the lyrics, “there’s room for you and there’s room for me, under the tree for shade.” In our song “Man on an Island,” Greg gave those lyrics a dark twist by changing them to, “there’s room for you, and room for me, under the tree of shame.” So when we were going back and forth as a group on what to call our band our bassist Erik had the idea to just call ourselves Tree Of Shame. It’s based on Greg’s lyrics, but we all really liked all the additional dark historical connotations that came along with the concept of a tree of shame. It has different meanings to different people.\n\n2. Why did you want to play this genre?\n\nGreg: I wouldn't say there is a specific \"genre\". On this album, there are quite a few being represented. Not entirely sure what that would be called. We clearly tend to be drawn toward aggressive and heavy means of expression. The theory early on was to simply create music that we would want to listen to and not have it necessarily categorized in one way or the other. The title for the song \"I Like Good\", not the song itself, has always been somewhat of a guide since early on. \"You like that? Yeah, it's good!\". Done.\n\nTodd & Erik: In light of all the generic, pop, party music these days, we feel like this music is more genuine. Other genres typically stay away from the darker sides of life because it isn't fun and lighthearted, but life isn't a 24/7 party and we feel a lot of people can identify with that. We do at least. Nobody wants to be told to be carefree and lighthearted when life continually takes a shit on you in one way or more ways. There’s also a sense of freedom playing music like this, because you get more fulfillment playing exactly what you want and not worrying whether or not your music will get radio play.\n\n3. Did you know each other before the band was formed?\n\nJason and Greg were in a band called Nuclear Rabbit together for a lot of years, which Todd and Erik happened to be fans of prior to joining. Todd and Jason also briefly played in a band together post-Nuclear Rabbit. Erik got involved through a mutual friend of Greg's in the Northern California music scene.\n\n4. Each band member’s favourite band?\n\nTodd: 1 favorite is impossible: Lamb of God, Sigur Ros, Dredg.\n\nErik: Always a tough question! #1 rotates between Tool, Killswitch Engage, and the Deftones.\n\nJason: The Chariot. Greg: Good ones.\n\n5. Who or what inspires you to write songs?\n\nTodd: The need to play drums and the need to make music that our local radio stations would never play.\n\nErik: Many things are sources of inspiration, but I’d say the #1 thing for me is creating music with others. I enjoy noodling on a bass or guitar on the couch as much as the next guy, but opportunities to create music that’s influenced by more than just myself are what get me fired up the most.\n\nJason: I have tried to stop creating music. It doesn't work. I am an addict.\n\nGreg: Like most, anything that inspires. The good and the bad. Mostly the bad.\n\n6. Where was your last gig?\n\nIt was at The Phoenix Theater in Petaluma, CA just a few weeks ago. That’s our first and only show so far. Hopefully the first of many!\n\n7. Where would you like to act?\n\nJason: With everyone’s lives outside this band it can be difficult just to get all four of us in the same room together, so I'll take a full-band rehearsal, in the studio at this point.\n\nGreg: Anywhere with other cool bands and a crowd enjoying themselves\n\nErik: Playing The Warfield in San Francisco would be amazing. But to Greg’s point, it would only be fun if there’s a crowd enjoying themselves.\n\n8. Whom would you like to feature with?\n\nThe Dangers, System of a Down, Madonna\n\n9. Whom not?\n\nMichael Jackson\n\n10. Any of you has ever suffered from stage fright? Any tip for beginners on how to beat that?\n\nJason has the most extensive and broad experience with live performances so we’re letting him take this one. Jason: If one experiences stage fright, it means that one cares about what they are doing. You can use this energy to deliver an amazing performance. I have experienced crippling anxiety before and during performances. It is true that the only real way to \"get over\" it is to perform more. It gets easier as your experience of performing increases. For those new to performing or those who have done it for a long time and still struggle with it (like me) I offer the following tips:\n\n1. Visualize yourself doing the performance prior to actually performing.\n\n2. When you get on stage, take a second to take a few deep breaths and feel the entire space around you. The space between the back of your head and the nearest wall behind you, the space in front of you and to the sides.\n\n3. If you are in charge of setting the tempo for the music you are about to play, hear the music in your head before beginning. Then when you begin, start a little bit slower than your head is thinking the music should be. This is because when you are filled with adrenaline and stressed out with stage fright you won't be thinking or sensing things in the same way as usual. Chances are your idea about tempos will be faster than they actually are.\n\n4. Allow yourself the freedom to make a mistake and after you do or if you do, forget about it and just create the best music you can in the moment. I used to have an instructorwho was a concert Pianist and she would purposefully make a small error at the beginning of pieces so that she could relax and not try to make a perfect performance and instead would just make some great music.\n\n5. Remember to breathe. Often when I am playing music that is difficult, I will hold my breath while trying to make it happen. A body without oxygen does all kinds of whacky stuff and makes playing music way more difficult than it needs to be.\n\n11. What bands have inspired you the most?\n\nJason: This is a difficult question for me. I admire a ton of different bands/composers/groups/performers whatever. However, I do not generally listen to any particular music and say to myself, \"Yeah, I want to do something like that\". I know that what I create sounds similar to others at times but it is more an accident then a concerted effort on my part. For example, the first time I heard of Captain Beefheart was when reading a review of this project I used to be involved in. The critic was saying things like Blah Blah Blah with guitar parts akin to Captain Beefheart's Zoot Horn Rollo... I decided to check out Captain Beefheart and heard the similarities. Basically, I had come to similar conclusions about playing the guitar as someone else had many years earlier. I don't really know what I am driving at here. Let me say that any artist who is creating their art and giving it every ounce of their being inspires me. I have seen performances which lack any technical skill but are so filled with raw human experience that I am captivated. Ultimately, that is what drives me: Genuine heart-felt expression. Any performer giving it everything they have.\n\nTodd: I'm all over the board, but I grew up with 90's/00's metal bands. Dave Grohl's drumming in Nirvana got me started playing drums. From there, I have no shame in the fact that I fell in love with Korn, Deftones, Slipknot, Coal Chamber, etc. These days, it's more modern metal bands like Gojira and Mastodon with some post rock thrown in there.\n\nErik: Tim C from Rage Against the Machine and Chi Cheng (RIP) of the Deftones played a major role in me wanting to play the bass in the first place. I always wanted to be a drummer until I heard those bands. The grooves of the bass and how they stood out just hooked me. Once I started playing bass I was also heavily influenced by punk bands like The Misfits, AFI and Rancid, as well as various heavier bands like Pantera, Sepultura, Metallica, Killswitch Engage and Tool.\n\nGreg: I'm not inspired by other bands when I create music. Especially not this album we made.\n\n12. What's the weirdest thing a fan has ever asked you for?\n\nJason was once asked by a fan for the sweatshirt off his back while standing in the cold.\n\n13. What do you think of your fans?\n\nFor those who care enough about our music to call themselves fans, we are humbled and appreciative.\n\n14. What do you think of our site?\n\nWe’re fans of every music outlet that supports genres that pop culture hates. We love Breathing The Core’s coverage and the spirit behind it!\n\n15. Something to add?\n\nWake up."
