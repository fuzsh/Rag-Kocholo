        "text": "Supplemental Instruction is an academic assistance program providing regularly scheduled out-of-class, peer-led study sessions for challenging courses. The free sessions, open to all students in targeted courses, are held two or three times each week throughout the semester, and special study sessions are added before exams.\n\nMore in-depth than tutoring, and led by students who have mastered the subjects, SI sessions integrate what you're learning in class with essential learning strategies. As a result, SI participants usually earn higher grades and withdraw from classes less often than other students.\n\nSupplemental Instruction Overview\n\nDownload overview information.\n\nRecruiting for Spring 2024\n\nVMASC recruits, trains, and assigns new si leaders every semester to support a Biology, Math, Computer Science and soon Kinesiology.\n\nTo apply to be an SI leader please apply here on HANDSHAKE.
