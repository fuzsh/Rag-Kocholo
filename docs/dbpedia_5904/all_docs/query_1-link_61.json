Founded in 1994, it initially consisted of the band's namesake guitarist and singer Marc \"Mirv\" Haggard, bassist Craig McFarland, drummer Jeff Gomes, and guitarist Bryan Kehoe, who also contributed vocals and keyboards. Kehoe left the band in 2001 to form The Kehoe Nation and was replaced by Spent Poets singer Adam Gates, aka The Filthy Ape. Recently, the band has been playing shows as a 5-piece with both Kehoe and Gates.\n\nTheir musical style is diverse, and includes elements of hard rock, heavy metal, funk, country, opera, experimental, electronica, and polka.\n\nKehoe era M.I.R.V shows often featured songs punctuated by interludes of lunacy, usually featuring a verbal interchange between Haggard and Kehoe. Often Haggard would announce a contest for the women in the audience, after which the winner would be cajoled into grabbing Kehoe's groin, causing him to sing in a high pitched operatic voice. Kehoe would often sing the Neapolitan standard \"'O Sole Mio\" following the antics. M.I.R.V. shows would regularly feature Haggard playing an electric saw during portions of the concerts.\n\nM.I.R.V.'s first album \"Cosmodrome\" was written and recorded mostly by Haggard and featured a character named Grandpa, later revealed to be Primus' Les Claypool, who also put the record out on his own Prawn Song label. The album features songs interspersed with skits and is generally regarded as a concept album. The next two records were released on Poison Eye, M.I.R.V.'s own label, and feature primarily music. It was these later two albums that saw the band form into a four piece touring outfit, as opposed to a studio project.\n\nThe band has toured worldwide alongside acts like Jerry Cantrell, Fishbone, Primus, and has played with groups like Cheap Trick, Run DMC, Papa Roach and Nuclear Rabbit.\n\nThe Kehoe Nation\n\nTHE KEHOE NATION\n\nLadies and gentlemen… boys and girls… children of all ages… step right up! Witness the musical oddity that is “THE KEHOE NATION”! This “Western Gothic” band from San Francisco is the brainchild of leader Bryan Kehoe. For many years “Kehoe” has been electrifying stages across the US and Europe, sangin’ and pickin’ that there gee-tar in groups such as, Jerry Cantrell Band (Alice in Chains), The Les Claypool Frog Brigade (Primus), Ministry, and Nor Cal legends M.I.R.V.\n\nTheir self released debut “Music for Livers”, recorded, mixed and mastered by the legendary engineer Oz Fritz (Tom Waits, Bill Laswell, Buckethead), is an entertaining potent cocktail of country, oompah, polka and waltzes, performed with good ol’ punk and metal swagger. By mixing the “ol’ timey” timbres of a stand up bass, clarinet, accordion, and antique orchestral percussions, with “Rawk” guitars and drums, they have created a fresh new soundscape. The combination of master musicianship and raucus stage shows has made them a hometown favorite.\n\n“Kehoe is quickly making an name for himself, performing his technical wizardry on a cranked up Telecaster…the boy ain’t normal!” Guitar Player Magazine\n\n“I have seen The Kehoe Nation, a Bay Area favorite, several times and have never been let down.” Zero Magazine\n\n“The Kehoe Nation forge a sound that is bound to get them noticed, if not notorious. Catch them if you can!” powerslave.com\n\nThe sound of this ragtag minstrel group will tickle yer eardrum, tantalize yer tympanum, scintillate yer stereo, vex yer vibrola and definitely set granny off into one of her conniptions.\n\nPolkacide\n\nPolkacide, San Francisco's one and only hardcore polka band.\n\nPolkacide is a band based in the San Francisco Bay Area that plays their own unique style of polka, which can be characterized as \"punk polka\". They have appeared on the Doctor Demento television show and have made several recordings.\n\nPolkacide, founded in 1985 by Ward Abronski, was originally organized to play a one-night stand for the 50th anniversary of the Deaf Club in San Francisco. The Deaf Club (which actually is a club for deaf people) had been hiring rock and punk bands to perform for them because they were so loud that club members could dance to them. It was suggested that some of the more elderly members did not want a punk band for the anniversary show. This inspired Abronski to form a \"really loud polka band\" for the occasion. None of the original members (12 in all) were polka musicians at the time, but they had varied backgrounds in music, including classical, rock, punk and jazz. Clarinetist Neil Kaitner, a.k.a. Neil Basa, came up with the name for the band and also designed the band logo, which features a skull and crossed sausages.\n\nBand members were recruited, costumes made (black leather lederhosen with spikes, etc.,) and a repertoire of classic polkas learned in a three-month period leading up to the Deaf Club's 50th anniversary party. One week before the performance was to take place, it was cancelled due to noise abatement orders from local authorities. Rather than let their efforts go to waste, the band determined to play at least one performance and managed to be included in a punk show at the Mabuhay Gardens in San Francisco, a major punk venue at the time. Polkacide played loud, fast polkas at a thrashing punk tempo while mowhawk-headed punks stage dived and moshed in the pit along with the punk-dirndl clad Polka Sluts who turned out in support of the band.\n\nMembers of other bands that performed that night at the Mabuhay were still talking and laughing about it when they went to play other venues later that week, and word spread to booking agents and club owners about the \"Punk Polka Band\" Polkacide. The band has been playing ever since."
