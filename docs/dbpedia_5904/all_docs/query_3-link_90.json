        "text": "After Tolkien Secondary literature Adaptations The Lord of the Rings The Hobbit Works inspired by Popular culture\n\nJ.R.R. Tolkien's legendarium of Middle-earth has had a profound and wide-ranging impact on popular culture. This is especially true for The Lord of the Rings, ever since its publication in the 1950s, but especially throughout the 1960s and 1970s, where young people embraced it as a countercultural saga, and its influence has been vastly extended in the present day, thanks to the live-action film trilogy by Peter Jackson. Many of the following references are directly inspired by the latter films rather than the book.\n\nReferences[]\n\nAmusement parks[]\n\n\"The Bridge of Khazad-dûm\" and \"Old Friends\" are used as soundtracks for the themed area Hollywood Street Set in Movie Park Germany.\n\nFor the 2011 Silvester fireworks in Phantasialand, \"Concerning Hobbits\" was used as a soundtrack.\n\n\"Girion, Lord of Dale\" from the The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug soundtrack was used in the 2020 show Special Show mit Patrick Lemoine in Phantasialand.\n\nThe restaurant The Flaming Feather in Toverland, in the Netherlands, intentionally resembles a Hobbit-hole.\n\nMovies, television, and radio[]\n\nIn the movie 17 Again, Ned talks to Jane (the Principal) at the restaurant table about how he bought Gandalf In an episode of the sitcom Friends, Ross and Chandler speak about a university friend, called \"Gandalf (-the Party Wizard).\" When Joey asks why they call him Gandalf, they reply, \"Didn't you read The Lord of the Rings in high school?\" to which Joey responds, \"No, I had sex in high school.\"\n\nIn addition to spoofing elements of The Lord of the Rings, South Park has a nurse with a conjoined twin fetus on her head called Nurse Gollum.\n\nThe South Park episode \"The Return of the Fellowship of the Rings to the Two Towers\" is a parody of the movie version of The Lord of the Rings.\n\nThe TV show Babylon 5 (1993–1998) includes occasional homages to The Lord of the Rings, as well as epic themes drawn from similar mythological roots. See Babylon 5 influences for a more detailed exploration.\n\nIn The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy episode Here Thar Be Dwarves, Billy finds his way to the Dwarves stronghold Boringya. There Dwarves leader \"Beardbottom\" tells him about the on-going Dwarves' war with Elves over the monopoly on the cookie industry, and asks him for an aid in the big final assault on an Elves Cookie Factory. A flashback about the origins of the war is a nod to the Council of Elrond, where the races are shown dividing up a monopol on the fast-food industry.\n\nIn an episode of Phineas and Ferb, Agent P and Major Monogram's son Monty go on a mission in a LOVEMUFFIN building. When several goons attack them, including a bodybuilder. Monty references the famous Boromir quote \"They have a cave troll\".\n\nIn another episode of The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy, Beast and Barbarians, The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings are parodied: Mandy acquires a ring from a Gollum-like creature by solving a riddle (\"What's black and blue and red all over?\" \"That would be you if I don't get that ring pronto!\"), with that ring she gains power over an evil army.\n\nThe TV show Gilmore Girls often has references to The Lord of the Rings in various episodes.\n\nIn an episode of The Simpsons, the family goes to a dude ranch. While there they are taken on a picnic by Cookie, the ranch owner. After finishing Cookie calls \"Cleany\" to come clean up. Cleany's movements and mannerisms are modeled precisely after Gollum and he refers to the garbage as his \"precious.\" Cleany was voiced by Andy Serkis.\n\nIn the third Futurama movie; Bender's Game, many locations from Middle-Earth are parodied, such as Minas Tirith, Mount Doom, and Moria. Some of the characters are also based on characters from Lord of the Rings.\n\nIn Disney's sequel to The Emperor's New Groove, Kronk's New Groove, Yzma causes people in a retirement home to become addicted to a \"youth potion\" that is actually green water. When Kronk buys out the retirement home, Rudy (the old man that Emperor Kuzco had thrown out the window in the first movie) comes and begs for a spot. When Kronk takes out the \"potion,\" Rudy jumps up and takes it out of his hand and then bends his back, rubbing the potion. Imitating Gollum, he then said, \"My precious...Kronk just wants it all for himself!\"\n\nIn an episode of Family Guy, Stewie is at the park. When he sees another kid at the jungle gym Stewie pushes the kid on the ground and says \"Cry, cry like Sauron when he lost his contacts.\" The scene then shifts to a cutaway showing the Eye of Sauron frantically searching for his lost contact.\n\nOn another episode of Family Guy, there is a scene that also parodies the movie Poltergeist as well as The Lord of the Rings. Chris is thrown from his bedroom window into the clutches of a living tree. The scene eventually parodies the epic confrontation between Gandalf and the Balrog as seen in The Lord of the Rings when Herbert the Creepy Old Pedophile shows up to save Chris. Herbert recites the film trilogy Gandalf's line, \"You shall not pass!\".\n\nIn the third episode of Family Guy, \"Tiegs for Two\", after Peter Griffin finds out that Brian Griffin is banging Cheryl Tiegs, He says \"Light the Beacons!\" Which is followed up by a parody of the Lighting of the Beacons scene from The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. With Aragorn commenting \"Cheryl Tiegs, Nice.\"\n\nIn the episode \"Whoever Did This\" of The Sopranos, two children play with bows and arrows while quoting lines from The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. As a result, one of the children (the son of capo Ralphie Cifareto) is fatally wounded by an arrow to the chest.\n\nIn the episode \"Two Birds of a Feather\" of Magnum, P.I., a scene showing Magnum and his friends during the Vietnam War, his team uses the codename \"Frodo\" while trying to contact \"Gandalf\" to get air support.\n\nIn the show Odd Job Jack, episode 2.02 (\"Lord of the Three Ring Binder\") spoofs The Lord of the Rings, with Jack as Frodo (and as Déagol, when Jack was in his College years). One character plays Tom Bombadil, and is thrown literally under a bus.\n\nThe episode \"D & DD\" of the animated series Dexter's Laboratory spoofs Dungeons and Dragons in general (even mentioning a warrior called \"Gygax\"), but inserts references to Middle-earth. Dexter is forced to play as \"Hodo the Furry-footed Burrower\", a hobbit/halfling whose name is possibly a combination of \"Hobbit\" and \"Frodo\".\n\nStephen Colbert of The Colbert Report has made several references to both The Lord of the Rings, Middle-earth and Dungeons and Dragons on his show.\n\nIn the movie Clerks II, Randal equates the Lord of The Rings movies as being 3 movies about walking. The first movie is demonstrated by Randal taking an exaggerated step while blank-faced; the second by tripping and looking back and down mid-walk; the third consisting of the same walk, culminating in a gesture to remove the ring from the finger and toss it downward. Before the film was made, director Kevin Smith had done exactly the same thing during an appearance on The Tonight Show.\n\nTalk show host Rush Limbaugh once described himself as a black smoke from Mordor (as if hindering the political party considered left of center).\n\nIn the Stargate Atlantis episode \"Critical Mass\", Dr. Bill Lee uses the lighting of the beacons of Gondor to explain his idea of relaying a message to Atlantis.\n\nIn the Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends episode \"Partying is Such Sweet Soiree\", when Mac goes on a sugar-high rampage, he pets sugar-related objects and says, \"My precious...\" immitating Gollum.\n\nAn episode of MADtv did a parody of Lord of the Rings known as \"Lords of the Bling\" where Bill Cosby played Gandalf and said, \"We have to take the ring to Mordor, by the MotoPhoto!\" Frodo was now Froho.\n\nIn the W.I.T.C.H. episode \"G is for Garbage\", when Irma and Blunk go to Blunk's hideout, Blunk says, \"My precious...\" while loving his trash, and he even sounds like Gollum.\n\nIn the flim Brick the character called The Pin extols the quality of Tolkien's writing to Brendan.\n\nIn the TV series \"Bones\", FBI Agent Seeley Booth countered Temperance Brennan's suspicions of voodoo: \"and then we just toss the ring into the molten river, and blah blah blah\" (\"The Man in the Morgue\").\n\nThe The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring was mocked by Mystery Science Theater 3000 alumni Mike Nelson and Kevin Murphy in an audio commentary for Nelson's RiffTrax service. However, Nelson has publicly stated that unlike most of the films featured on the service, he actually likes the film.\n\nThe film was also mocked by comedians Aries Spears, and Debera Wilson, of MAD TV. The show spoofed it as Lords Of The Bling, a version of the movie produced by BET, and with an all black cast such as Lil Kim, Sisqo, Bill Cosby, Missy Elliot, and a few others. MAD TV also parodied the other two movies.\n\nComedy group Whitest Kids You Know did a skit mocking Lord of the Rings. It consists of Frodo asking Gandalf why he didn't use more magic during their journey or ask the eagles to just fly them to Mount Doom.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings is mentioned in two episodes in The Big Bang Theory. In \"The Middle-Earth Paradigm\", Leonard, Sheldon, Howard, and Raj all have a Frodo Baggins costume in which Leonard wears. In \"The Precious Fragmentation\", Leonard, Sheldon, Howard, and Raj find a box of collectibles and in it, a prop of the One Ring. They all fight over who gets to keep it.\n\nIn the cartoon Regular Show, the 2012 Christmas Special serves as an homage to the Lord of the Rings books and movies. The main group goes on a long quest quest to destroy a powerful, mind corrupting presentbox in a volcano.\n\nThe scene where Muscle Man unsuccessfully tries to destroy the box with a hammer is similar to the scene in The Fellowship of the Ring, where Gimli's attempt to destroy the one ring with his axe fails as well.\n\nLater, when Benson beats the Pinball game and the long, thin bridge over the abyss appears, the scene (especially with the collapsing bridge and the almost-falling Benson) references the moment also in The Fellowship of the Ring where Gandalf fights the Balrog on a similar bridge.\n\nIn the long running Si-fi Doctor Who, in a deleted scene for the episode 'The Eleventh Hour', the Doctor refers to himself as Space Gandalf.\n\nIn the 2014 movie The Interview, Dave Skylark refers to Aaron Rapoport, his producer and friend, and himself respectively as Samwise and Frodo to emphasize the bond between them.\n\nIn the 2015 film The Martian, adapted from the novel by Andy Weir (see below), a meeting to discuss the rescue of an astronaut from Mars is described as \"Project Elrond.\" When Annie Montrose questions the name, Mitch Henderson (played by Sean Bean, who played Boromir in the films) explains it means they are having a secret meeting, prompting the rest of the characters to fully explain it is a Lord of the Rings reference. Teddy Sanders remarks that if the meeting is called Elrond he wants his code-name to be Glorfindel.\n\nIn Despicable Me 2, Edith mentions Gollum when Margo asked Gru what celebrity does he look like to sign him up for online dating.\n\nMusic[]\n\nMiddle Earth was the name of a highly influential underground music club in London, UK, from the mid 1960s.\n\nThe Beatles' song \"She Said, She Said\" includes a passing reference to The Lord of the Rings, and writer John Lennon was known to have been a fan of them. During the song's fade-out, Lennon can be heard singing a series of seemingly nonsensical sounds; these phrases are either a Lennon pre-taped vocal played backwards, or Lennon imitating the sound of a reverse-tape voice. At the start of the fade-out Lennon can clearly be heard chanting the words \"Ash Nazg\", the first two words of the invocation engraved on the Ring of Power.\n\nUS pop group The Hobbits released their debut album Down to Middle Earth in 1967.\n\nAmerican psychedelic group Gandalf formed in 1967.\n\nSteve Peregrin Took (born Stephen Ross Porter) of British rock band Tyrannosaurus Rex took his name from the hobbit Peregrin Took (better known as Pippin) in The Lord of the Rings. Took later recorded under the pseudonym 'Shagrat the Vagrant', before forming a band called Shagrat in 1970.\n\nLeonard Nimoy's music: \"The Ballad of Bilbo Baggins\" (1968) is based on The Hobbit.\n\nTom Rapp set most of the verse of the One Ring (\"Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky...\") to music as \"Ring Thing\" in Pearls Before Swine's second album, Balaklava (1968).\n\nLed Zeppelin's music: \"Ramble On\" (1969) refers to Gollum and Mordor, \"Misty Mountain Hop\" (1971) is named after Tolkien's Misty Mountains, and \"The Battle of Evermore\" (1971) is an actual allegory from the \"Battle of the Pelennor Fields\" from The Return of the King;the line in \"Stairway To Heaven\" 'the feeling I get when I look to the west' signifies the longing for the Elven undying lands which are 'to the west' which many characters in Tolkien's work experience; while \"Over the Hills and Far Away\" (1973) refers to \"The Hobbit\".\n\nBritish musician Twink recorded the songs \"Unexpected Party\" (featuring a reading from ‘The Fellowship of the Ring’) and \"Gandalf’s Garden\" in 1969/1970.\n\nGenesis' song \"Stagnation\" (from Trespass, 1970) was about Gollum.

The translation infuses the films with countless Russian pop culture jokes and allusions to Soviet anecdotes, movies, books and historical personages: for example, Legolas and Gimli speak in Estonian and Georgian accents respectively; Théoden becomes Boris Yeltsin and his affliction the consequence of alcoholism; and Gandalf is а Major in the Honduras police force. \"Goblin\" also put together a brand new parody soundtrack for the movies, featuring dozens of songs ranging from modern pop like Tatu, Leningad and Rammstein to old Soviet Communist anthems, with some songs by revered artists like Vladimir Vysotsky and Viktor Tsoj sprinkled in.
