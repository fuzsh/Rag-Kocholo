        "text": "Uranium is a silvery-white metal and a primary energy source. After raw uranium is mined and milled, it is processed to make fuel for nuclear reactors to generate electricity.\n\nLearn more about uranium and nuclear power\n\nUses and production\n\nUranium is used primarily to produce fuel for nuclear power plants (more than 99% of the total use). Other uses (less than 1%) include producing fuel for research reactors and medical isotopes.\n\nCanada produced 7.4 kilotonnes of uranium in 2022 from mines in Saskatchewan, which was valued at approximately $1.1 billion.\n\nSome of the uranium is refined and converted to produce uranium hexafluoride and uranium dioxide in plants in Ontario.\n\nApproximately 80% of Canada's uranium production was available for export. Based on long-term contracts (whose values can vary based on changes in regional demand), Canadian uranium is destined for North America and Latin America (64%), Asia (19%), and Europe (17%). In 2022, 27% of uranium purchased by American nuclear reactors came from Canada, making Canada the largest foreign supplier of uranium to the United States (U.S.).\n\nDomestic use in Canada's CANDU reactors in Ontario and New Brunswick was approximately 20% of production in 2022.\n\nSupply and demand\n\nThere is a strong nuclear science and technology presence across Canada, including the production of isotopes for medical and industrial applications. All Canadian uranium comes from Saskatchewan, but uranium processing, refining, conversion, fuel fabrication, research, and waste management happens across Canada. Nuclear power stations operate in Ontario and New Brunswick.\n\nGross capacity of nuclear power plants in Canada\n\nThe six nuclear power stations in Canada have a combined capacity of 14,629 megawatts. The Bruce generating station in Ontario is one of the largest nuclear power plants in the world.\n\nNuclear power plants in Canada, location and capacity/caption> Facility Province Total capacity (MW) Units Darlington Ontario 3,736 4 Bruce A Ontario 3,437 4 Bruce B Ontario 3,507 4 Pickering A Ontario 1,084 2 Pickering B Ontario 2,160 4 Point Lepreau New Brunswick 705 1\n\nInternational context\n\nUranium\n\nFind out how Canada's uranium ranks on an international scale:\n\nWorld production\n\nWorld exports\n\nWorld known recoverable resources\n\nNuclear power\n\nFind out how Canada's nuclear power ranks on an international scale:\n\nWorld generation – 2,653 terawatt hours, 2021 Rank Country Percentage of Total 1 United States 29% 2 China 14% 3 France 14% 4 Russia 8% 5 South Korea 6% 6 Canada 3%\n\nPrices\n\nMost Canadian uranium is sold through long-term contracts, as opposed to the spot market. Canadian uranium is generally sold in North America and Latin America (64%), Asia (19%) and Europe (17%).\n\nThe average spot contract price for uranium declined from a peak of $88 per pound U308 equivalent in 2007 to $22 in 2017 and has gradually increased to $41 in 2022. In 2022, the value of spot contracts surpassed the value of purchases from foreign suppliers ($40) for the first time since 2008.\n\nCanadian nuclear research and development\n\nCanada has nuclear research and development capabilities that are supported by academic research centres, the private sector and government laboratories—including Chalk River Laboratories, Canada's largest science and technology complex.\n\nNuclear energy research is focused on supporting existing reactor technologies as well as next-generation nuclear energy systems. Canada is also a leader in nuclear R&D for areas such as nuclear medicine, pharmacology, environmental protection and wastewater treatment.\n\nSmall modular reactors (SMRs) are nuclear reactors that operate at a smaller scale than current nuclear power plants. Although not yet commercially proven in Canada, they may have future applications. SMRs might replace fossil fuel power plants or be used as load-following units equipped with systems for storing excess electricity to complement larger shares of variable renewables.\n\nSMRs may also have applications in the production of heat and electricity at both on- and off-grid industrial sites, and to help off-grid northern and remote communities reduce their reliance on diesel.\n\nCANDU nuclear reactors\n\nCanada has developed a unique nuclear reactor technology called CANDU and is one of roughly half a dozen countries that offer domestic-designed reactors to the open commercial market.\n\nIn addition to Canada, CANDU reactors have been sold to India, Pakistan, Argentina, South Korea, Romania and China.\n\nCANDU technology continues to evolve to enable the use of alternative fuels. Work is under way in Chinese CANDU reactors to demonstrate that they can recycle used fuel from other nuclear power plants, reducing the volume of nuclear waste.\n\nLearn more about Canadian Nuclear Energy Technology."
