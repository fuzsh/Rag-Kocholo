Fan account that I use to post Nuclear Rabbit songs, demos, and live performances that cannot be found on any other streaming services. Nuclear Rabbit is a California band, started in Novato. The band's music has been called metal, more specifically "avant-garde" metal, but incorporates a variety of other styles, making the classification even more difficult. Known for its unusual sound and the lyrics, as well as bassist Jean Baudin's 11-string bass. Nuclear Rabbit has a large fan base despite being a perpetually underground and independent band. They are arguably one of the most well known underground bands in California, having more mainstream bands like Papa Roach, Alien Ant Farm, and Deftones opening for them.
