Abilities

Attack

Does a decent amount of damage to a foe.

Grab

Grabs the enemy. Does more damage the longer the grab is active. The grab can be negated by somebody attacking you, or the victim breaking out of the grab by rapidly pressing the highlighted button(s) enough times.

Radioactive (Passive)

When the Nuclear Rabbit dies, its limbs will pop off and explode, turning into glowing green puddles that deal damage and slow survivors down. If the survivor's health is low enough, they will be turned into a Toxic Rabbit.

Trivia

It is a community creation, designed by VikkyVik (VikkyCryp), the creator of Toxic Rabbit.

The Radioactive from the Nuclear Rabbit takes less health than a normal slime puddle.
