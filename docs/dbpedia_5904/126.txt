Overview

Gootraxian created by: VikkyCryp

Nuclear Rabbit is a rabbit Gootraxian. It is the Blackout variant of the Toxic Rabbit.

It has dark green fur sporting thick, different shades of green stripes around it's whole body and with patches of similarly colored spots in-between and around the stripes, it also has radioactive shards sticking out of it's shoulders and back that always glows.

Its chest has a large incision in the shape of an radioactive sign, which appears to be bleeding. Its left eye is also damaged and appears to be missing completely. Its right eye is the same neon green as their patches. However, it glows in the dark and there is a heavy shadow surrounding it. Its ears are pointing straight up, with the left one drooping to the front.
