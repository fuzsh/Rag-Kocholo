        "text": "Sarajevo is a riveting city. As the capital of Bosnia Herzegovina, Sarajevo has a long history that tells a mesmerizing story. The must-see Sarajevo sights span several centuries – and are concentrated in the heart of the city. We created a Self-Guided Free Walking Tour of Sarajevo to help other travelers see and understand those top sights. Our Sarajevo Tour serves as a perfect introduction for any Bosnia Itinerary.\n\nSarajevo Free Walking Tour\n\nSarajevo sightseeing is best done on foot and we designed a Self-Guided Sarajevo Walking Tour that features the top attractions. Our route through Sarajevo is about 5 miles long and will take approximately 3-5 hours to complete. Our Sarajevo Free Tour is accompanied by sight information, step-by-step directions, and a Sarajevo Map of Sights at the end of the article.\n\nPro Tip: Looking for Guided Sarajevo Walking Tours? We have recommendations for those below!\n\nSarajevo Sights History\n\nBefore setting off on a Sarajevo City Tour, it helps to know a bit about the history. Although it’s past is complex and often difficult, having a basic understanding of these events is essential when sightseeing Sarajevo.\n\nEarly Sarajevo History\n\nCivilizations have resided in the area of Sarajevo since the Neolithic Butmir Culture, eventually followed by the Illyrians. The Kingdom of Bosnia was formed in the 12th century, when the town was called Vrhbosna (top of Bosnia). However, it wasn’t until the Ottomans arrived in the 1400s that the city of Sarajevo was established. During that time, Sarajevo expanded rapidly. Accepting of people from all cultures and religions, the city welcomed Muslims, Catholics, Orthodox Christians and Jews.\n\nOttoman Rule in Sarajevo\n\nThe 16th century was the golden age of Ottoman rule. Sarajevo flourished; there was a water system and bathhouses, a clock tower and library, schools and religious buildings. Sarajevo reigned as the biggest and one of the wealthiest cities in the region, with a population of 80,000 residents.\n\nHowever, the oncoming demise of the Ottoman Empire led to the invasion of Sarajevo. The city was attacked and destroyed by fire in 1697. The next 200 years saw further decline, as Sarajevo was devastated by the Plague, more fires and war.\n\nSarajevo during the Austro-Hungarian Empire\n\nIn 1878, The Austro-Hungarian Empire took control of Sarajevo under the Treaty of Berlin and the subsequent Battle of Sarajevo. Under the Catholic Habsburgs, Sarajevo saw significant changes and expansion. New structures were built using modern Western architecture, while parts of the historic Ottoman city remained. Prominent buildings – like the Sacred Heart Cathedral, the National Museum and City Hall – were constructed.\n\nAlthough Sarajevo appeared to be thriving again, there was an underground movement to overthrow the Austro-Hungarian Empire and create a united Slavic kingdom. In 1914, a conspirator named Gavrilo Princip assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand (the next heir of the Austro-Hungarian throne) in the streets of Sarajevo. The assassination sparked a series of events, which ultimately led to World War I.\n\nYugoslavia\n\nIn the peace treaty that ended World War I, Sarajevo became part of the newly established Kingdom of Yugoslavia. During the Second World War, Nazi Germany occupied Sarajevo and eliminated the Jewish population. At the end of the war, Sarajevo fell within the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which was led by President Josip Broz Tito.\n\nYugoslavia was comprised of six states: Bosnia Herzegovina (of which Sarajevo was the capital), Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Slovenia. Belgrade served as Yugoslavia’s national capital. Regardless of the ethnic and religious differences, President Tito promoted unity.\n\nTo the west of the historic Sarajevo city center, block apartments were rapidly built in an area named Novo Sarajevo. The city grew – in both population and importance. In 1984, Sarajevo hosted the Winter Olympics, a supreme honor for the city and the country of Yugoslavia.\n\nSiege Of Sarajevo\n\nAfter the death of Tito in 1980, the government struggled to keep Yugoslavia together. The impending collapse of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s led to individual states seeking independence from the republic. The inner conflict ultimately triggered a series of brutal wars. When Bosnia & Herzegovina declared independence – and named Sarajevo capital – the city came under attack, first by the Yugoslav People’s Army, then by the Army of Republika Srpska (the Bosnian Serb Army).\n\nThe Serbian-led Siege of Sarajevo lasted for 1,425 days – from April 5, 1992 until February 29, 1996. Situated in the hills that encircle Sarajevo, the Bosnian Serb Army besieged Sarajevo with gunfire and mortar blasts. An average of 329 shells hit the city every day, with an astounding 3,777 falling in one day (July 22, 1993). Supplies were blocked from Sarajevo – including weapons, food, medicine, water and electricity. Civilians and cultural sights were targeted – and the Sarajevo library containing invaluable manuscripts was destroyed.\n\nDuring the Sarajevo siege, the Bosnian War raged on throughout the region. The historic city of Mostar was also under siege and, in the small town of Srebrenica, there was a horrific massacre of 8,000 Bosniaks (now recognized as genocide). Meanwhile, neighboring Croatia was also at war with Serbs, Montenegrins and for a time, Bosniaks.\n\nDayton Accords\n\nThe Siege of Sarajevo resulted in the deaths of more than 12,000 people, yet the Bosnian Serb Army never took control of the city. The Dayton Accords – an agreement between Bosnia, Serbia and Croatia – officially ended the war in 1996. Sarajevo once again began a period of rebuilding, this time with the help of foreign aid…and a lot of determination and even more patience.\n\nSarajevo Today\n\nThe city has taken great strides since the war. The Sarajevo City Center shopping mall is one of the biggest in the region and the modern Avaz Twist Tower stands as one of the tallest skyscraper in the Balkans. Sarajevo hosts the annual Sarajevo Film Festival and the Mount Trebevic Cable Car was inaugurated in 2018.\n\n26 Top Sarajevo Sights\n\nDue to it’s triumphant and turbulent past, Sarajevo is evocative. The Sarajevo Old Town pedestrian-only streets are bustling with tourists buying copper Bosnian coffee sets, while locals can be found drinking the potent coffee in quaint cafes. The lively Sarajevo markets are packed with produce, cheap trendy clothing and hand-knitted wool socks. Meanwhile, Sarajevo monuments document the human atrocities that occurred in the city and region.\n\nSarajevo displays an eclectic mix of architectural styles – from the elegant buildings of the Austro-Hungarian era to concrete block structures of the Socialist era. The state of the buildings is varied – from dilapidated shells to brand new structures. On the road, the Sarajevo public transportation fleet is inclusive of rickety-and-rusted trams to modern carriages donated from other countries.\n\nWhile, at first glance, the city looks and feels normal, the whispers of war are always nearby. It’s impossible to tour Sarajevo and not acknowledge what happened on the streets. Around almost every corner there are shadows of the Siege of Sarajevo.\n\nThe city is scarred by the war – visitors can see it in the bullet ridden buildings and the neglected remnants of the 1984 Olympics. Hundreds of simple white gravestones stand in hillside cemeteries – the etched dates of year born and year deceased much too close together. Unemployment is rampant – and beggars are part of the landscape. Young children sit cross-legged on the main pedestrian street singing for coins. Old women with sad eyes push their empty hands in front of strangers.\n\nDespite the wounds, there is a spirited side of Sarajevo that is also unmissable. Locals gather together in parks and in smoky cafes. Young couples holding hands sneak into hidden corners. Shop owners dish out food for stray cats. And people generously pass spare change and cigarettes into outstretched hands.\n\nOur Free Sarajevo Walking Tour\n\nNow that you have a better understanding of the city, lace up your travel shoes, grab your travel camera and begin your Sarajevo Sightseeing Tour.

Begin your Sarajevo discovery in the oldest part of the city. The Bascarsija in the Old Town is one of the top Sarajevo places to visit. Designed by the Ottomans in 1462, the Bascarsija served as the main marketplace. A central hub for trade, the narrow lanes accommodated shops, eateries and religious buildings…just as it does today. There are many Sarajevo sights in Bascarsija – and for our Sarajevo walking tour, we are starting at the Sebilj fountain in the heart of the marketplace.\n\n#2 Sebilj Fountain Sarajevo\n\nMAP. The Sarajevo landmark Sebilj Fountain sits in the main square within the Old Town bazaar. The wooden Sebilj water fountain was built in 1753 in the traditional Ottoman style. The fountain was renovated in the 19th century.\n\nDirections: From Sebilj, walk south and turn left (east) onto Kazandziluk Street.\n\n#3 Kazandziluk: Coppersmith Street Sarajevo\n\nMAP. Handcrafted Bosnian coffee sets and other tin and copper wares are made and sold on Coppersmiths’ Street, called Kazandziluk. The coppersmiths are often found in their shops using their tools to hammer out new pieces to sell.\n\nDirections: Walk the length of Kazandziluk, following the curve south to Bravadziluk Street, turn right (west) onto the street.\n\n#4 Bravadziluk: Locksmith Street Sarajevo\n\nMAP. Once the street where they made locks and keys, today Bravadziluk is a bustling street full of restaurants selling cevapi – the national dish of Bosnia & Herzegovina. Get our tips for the Best Places To Eat in Sarajevo!\n\nDirections: Walk west to the small square (nearly completing a circle) and turn around to face the Bascarsija Mosque.\n\n#5 Bascarsija Mosque\n\nMAP. Officially named Havadza Durak Mosque, the Bascarsija Mosque has been standing on the site since the early 1500s. The mosque was damaged during the war, but was repaired and declared a National Monument in 2006.\n\nDirections: Walk west across the square (away from the front of the mosque) and turn left (south) onto Abadziluk Street to the green domed market hall.\n\n#6 Brusa Bezistan: Market Hall & Sarajevo History Museum\n\nMAP. The domed market hall, Brusa Bezistand, is in the middle of the Old Town. Built in 1551 for the silk trade, today the old covered bazaar houses the Sarajevo City History Museum (which can be visited for a small fee).\n\nDirections: From the northeast corner of Brusa Bezistan, walk west on Curciluk Veliki to Trgovke Lane. Turn right (north) and walk to Saraci Street. Morica Han is directly in front of you on the north side of the street, the entrance is a little to your left.\n\n#7 Morica Han\n\nMAP. Built in 1551 as an inn for travelers coming to the bazaar, Morica Han is now a lively hub of shops and restaurants and one of the top Sarajevo tourist attractions.\n\nDirections: Exit to the north, by the fountain, and walk to Mula Mustafe Baseskije Street. On the opposite side of the street is the Old Orthodox Church.\n\n#8 Old Serbian Orthodox Church and Sarajevo Museum\n\nMAP. The 16th century Old Orthodox Church is set below street level and has an exquisite interior, including an ornate iconostasis and upstairs gallery. There is also a museum on site (ticket required).\n\nDirections: From the Old Orthodox Church, walk west on Mula Mustafe Basekije a half block and turn left (south) on Dulangina Street. Walk south one block to Saraci Street. Turn right (west) and walk to Gazi Husrev-Beg’s Mosque.\n\n#9 Gazi Husrev-Beg Mosque\n\nMAP. The most important mosque in Sarajevo, the Gazi Husrev-Bey Mosque, is a Sarajevo must-see. Completed in 1532, the Gazi Husrev-Beg Mosque is part of a larger complex that includes a school, library, market and public bathhouse. Inside the courtyard, visitors will find a beautiful fountain, where water is streamed in from the mountains and is used for washing before prayers. The mosque is open for visitors.\n\nDirections: Continue walking west on Saraci Street just past the mosque to the Clock Tower.\n\n#10 Sarajevo Clock Tower\n\nMAP. The tall slender Old Clock Tower, a National Monument, stands next to the Gazi Husrev-beg Mosque – as it has since the 17th century. Although it may appear that the clock is not keeping proper time, the Old Sarajevo Clock Tower keeps Lunar Time, which tracks according to the sun and moon. The clock strikes midnight at sunset…which is when Muslims pray the Maghrib prayer.\n\nDirections: Continue walking west, past the Gazi Husrev-beg’s Bezistan market hall, which is now occupied mostly by souvenir shops. Take a peek inside if you would like, then continue walking to the Meeting of Cultures monument.\n\n#11 Sarajevo Meeting Of Cultures\n\nMAP. A symbolic and understated monument in the middle of the street, the Meeting of Cultures monument recognizes and celebrates Sarajevo’s major influences. The line across the street is essentially where two very different cultures – the Islamic Ottomans and Christian Austro-Hungarian – meet together.\n\nDirections: Continue walking west. Pass the Sarajevo Museum of Crimes Against Humanity (which is an excellent place to learn more about the horrific events and crimes during the war) and walk to the Sacred Heart Cathedral.\n\n#12 Sarajevo Cathedral Of The Sacred Heart\n\nMAP. The Catholic Sarajevo Cathedral, which features Neo-Gothic and Romanesque Revival styles, was built between 1884 and 1889. The two bell towers rise to the height of 140-feet. Fronted by an open plaza, the church was left particularly exposed during the Siege of Sarajevo and was severely damaged. The plaza now features a monument to Pope John Paul II, who was a vocal supporter of Sarajevo during the war, and an iconic resin-filled Sarajevo Rose.\n\n#13 Sarajevo Roses\n\nMAP. During the Sarajevo War, mortar blasts left large indentations on sidewalks. Post War, rather than immediately repairing the damaged areas, the marks were filled in with red resin and named Sarajevo Roses. As time has passed, many of the sidewalks have been replaced and only a few Roses of Sarajevo remain today.\n\nDirections: From the Sarajevo Cathedral plaza, walk north along the west side of the church to Mula Mustafe Baseskije. Turn left (west) and walk to the Markale produce market.\n\n#14 Pijaca Markale Sarajevo Market\n\nMAP. The Pijaca Markale covered produce market operates as usual now, but during the war it endured two bombings that targeted unsuspecting Sarajevo civilians. The first bomb, in February 1994, killed 67 people. The second, in August 1995, killed 43. These civilian casualties are said to have prompted NATO to intervene in bringing an end to the war. A plaque in the back of the market bears the names of the victims.\n\nDirections: From the market, continue walking west to Gajev Trg. Turn left (south) and walk past the indoor food market, City Market, then walk into the open space, Trg Oslobodenje – Alija Izetbegovic. The square has changed names numerous times and was once the site of the main railway station and customs office; today it is named in honor of the city’s WWII liberation and after the first president of independent Bosnia and Herzegovina. On the southeast corner of the square is an Orthodox Church.\n\n#15 Orthodox Cathedral Church of the Nativity of the Theotokos\n\nMAP. Built in the 1860s, the massive Orthodox Church features a classic cross plan and five domes. The soaring central tower, which exceeded the height of many minarets, was a point of contention with some Muslims when it was built. Guests can visit the inside of the church for a small fee.\n\nDirections: Leave the square on the north side, heading west on Ferhadija. Walk two blocks west to the Eternal Flame.\n\n#16 Vjecna Vatra: Sarajevo Eternal Flame\n\nMAP. Marking the Old Town western boundary, the Eternal Flame honors the fallen soldiers and civilian victims from World War II. The flame burns continuously. Pro Tip: Adjacent to the Eternal Flame Memorial is the entrance to the Hecco Deluxe Hotel, which features a rooftop cafe with outdoor seating. Consider stopping in for a coffee break and enjoy the stunning views over the Sarajevo rooftops.\n\nDirections: From the Eternal Flame, walk west on Marsala Tita Street to Veliki Park on the north side of the street.\n\n#17 Veliki Park – Sarajevo Monuments\n\nMAP. This Sarajevo park, Veliki Park, is home to poignant memorials and ancient tombstones. The following are found along the southern edge of the park – from east to west – along Marsala Tita Street.\n\nOttoman Gravestones\n\nThroughout the city there are many Ottoman-style gravestone markers – which feature carved turbans on top. Some of the historic markers, which are found in parks and cemeteries, date to the 17th century.\n\nSrebrenica Monument: Man Calling To Son\n\nThis Srebrenica Monument in Sarajevo pays tribute to the victims of genocide in the Bosnian town of Srebrenica. The sign reads, “One of the most horrific scenes of the Srebrenica genocide against innocent Bosniak population is a scene when the father Ramo call to his son Nermin to surrender to the Serbian soldiers, as allegedly they will not do any harm to them. The exhumation team found Ramo and his son Nermin in a mass grave near Srebrenica in 2008.”\n\nMemorial to the Children of Sarajevo\n\nThe heart wrenching Memorial to the Children of Sarajevo sits beautifully in Veliki Park and honors the more than 1,500 children who were killed during the Siege of Sarajevo. In the basin are the footprints of the younger siblings of the children who died. Today, kids play in the area around the fountain. Another memorial names the children in Sarajevo who were killed during the war.\n\nSarajevo Rose\n\nAnother Rose of Sarajevo is found on the sidewalk, not too far west from the Memorial to the Children of Sarajevo.\n\nDirections: From the park, continue walking west on Marsala Tita Street. At Ali Pasha’s Mosque, veer to the left and continue walking on the southwest diagonal street. Across the park to your right, you can see the Avaz Twist Tower in the distance. At the stoplight, where the street curves to the west, you will see the new modern Sarajevo City Center Mall. Just past the mall, on the south side of the street, is a large Medieval Tombstone – and behind it is the Sarajevo Parliament Building. Keep walking west along the street, which has changed names here to Zmaja od Bosne.\n\n#18 Sniper Alley Sarajevo – Zmaja od Bosne\n\nMAP. The most infamous of all Sarajevo streets, Zmaja od Bosne is the main thoroughfare from the Sarajevo Airport to the historic center – and, during the war, it was nicknamed Sniper Alley. Serbian snipers positioned in the hillsides would target people walking on the street. An estimated 225 people were killed and more than 1,000 injured on Sniper Alley during the Siege.\n\nDirections: Walk west on Zmaja od Bosne to the boxy, yellow Hotel Holiday.\n\n#19 Hotel Holiday (former Sarajevo Holiday Inn Hotel)\n\nMAP. The bold, yellow Holiday Inn was built for the 1984 Olympics as a landmark modern hotel. However, it was during the Siege of Sarajevo that the hotel became known worldwide. Used first as a quasi-headquarters for the Bosnian Serb Army at the very beginning of the war, snipers stood in the windows and shot at protesters who gathered across the street in front of Parliament.\n\nThen, when journalists came to cover the war, they used the hotel as a base to report – and view – the war in Sarajevo. Located on a dangerous section of Sniper Alley, the hotel was constantly barraged by bullets. Today, the building no longer bears the logo of the hotel chain, but is open for business under a similar name: Holiday Hotel.\n\nDirections: From the Holiday Hotel, continue walking west past the National Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina. At the walkway on your left (before you get to the BiH History Museum) turn left and walk south. The walkway passes the notable Tito Café, which is a good place to stop, rest your feet and have a beverage. Be sure to check out the Yugonostalgia that covers the walls, the military tank in the yard and the ICAR Canned Beef Monument (an art installment mocking the canned mystery meat provided by international aid during the war).\n\nWalk south to the Miljacka River, then turn left (east) onto the Woodrow Wilson Promenade. Walk 600 meters along the tree-lined promenade to the next bridge, Suada and Olga Bridge.\n\n#20 Suada and Olga Bridge: Sarajevo Romeo and Juliet Bridge\n\nMAP. Not an exceptional bridge by sight, the Suada and Olga Bridge saw two historic events during the war. Suada Dilberovic and Olga Sucic, who the bridge is named after, are considered to be the first two victims of the Sarajevo War. They were both killed on the bridge by snipers during a peace rally on April 5, 1992. A fading plaque on the bridge commemorates the event.\n\nThe bridge also has the nickname of the Romeo and Juliet Bridge. In 1993, a young couple – one Bosniak, the other Bosnian Serb – tried to escape the war so they could be together. Unsuccessful in their departure, they were shot and killed while running across the bridge. Their embraced corpses remained on the bridge for several days before it was safe to move them.\n\nDirections: Cross Suada and Olga Bridge then turn left (east) and continue walking alongside the river to the Skenderija Bridge. As you walk along the Miljacka, listen for the call to prayer to ring out from the speakers of the many minarets…then ricochet down the shallow riverbed.\n\n#21 Skenderija Bridge\n\nMAP. The picturesque Skenderija footbridge was designed by Gustave Eiffel (the engineer of the world-famous Eiffel Tower in Paris). Today, couples use the bridge for Love Locks.\n\nDirections: Continue walking east along the river, passing the Sarajevo National Theater (with arches and columns on the north bank) and the Ashkenazi Synagogue (south bank) until you arrive at the arched Latin Bridge.\n\n#22 Latin Bridge: Famous Sarajevo Bridge\n\nMAP. Called the Latin Bridge for the many Catholics who used to reside in the area, the Ottoman bridge is one of the oldest in Sarajevo. However, the reason the Latin Bridge is famous is because it was the site of an event that changed the world. In 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated near the north end of the bridge; many consider it to be the act that started World War I.\n\nDirections: Continue walking east along the river to the grandiose striped building, City Hall and Library.\n\n#23 Sarajevo City Hall and Library\n\nMAP. The original City Hall and Sarajevo Library building was built in 1896. That building, however, was destroyed by artillery and fire in 1992. It is estimated that 2 million written documents, some rare and irreplaceable, were lost. It took more than two decades to rebuild the structure. The building was reconstructed in the original style and reopened in 2014.\n\nA plaque at the front reads: ‘On this place Serbian criminals in the night of 25th-26th August 1992 set on fire the National and University’s Library of Bosnia and Herzegovina; over 2 million books, periodicals and documents vanished in the flame. Do not forget. Remember and warn!’\n\nDirections: At the east end of the Sarajevo City Hall is the Seher-Cehaja Bridge.\n\n#24 Seher-Cehaja Bridge\n\nMAP. Of the 13 bridges the Ottomans built in Sarajevo, the Seher-Cehaja Bridge is considered to be the prettiest. The name translates to Mayor’s Bridge.\n\nDirections: Cross Bentbasa Street to the north of Sehercehaja Bridge and turn right (east). Veer to the left onto Nadmlini Street and follow it north to the Kovaci Cemetery.\n\nDetour! – or Sarajevo 2-Day Exploration\n\nAmbitious travelers may want to make a detour south of the river to a few sights before continuing uphill to the final two stops on our free Sarajevo Walking Tour. Sarajevo tourist attractions on the south side of the river include the Sarajevo Trebevic Cable Car (which takes visitors up the hill to the Abandoned Bobsled Track), the Alifakovac Cemetery and District (which provides views across the river valley to the Old town), the Sarajevo Brewery and the Emperor’s Mosque.\n\nAt the bend in the river, visitors will find a wooden bridge and river view cafes. Once you finish adventuring, return to the Sehercehaja Bridge and continue to the Kovaci Cemetery.\n\nPro Tip: Visitors spending two days in Sarajevo can spend the entire second day exploring this part of Sarajevo!\n\n#25 Kovaci Cemetery Sarajevo\n\nMAP. Several large graveyards, like Kovaci Cemetery, are found near the city center. During the war, desperate Sarajevans cut down many trees in order to use the wood for cooking and as a source of heat in the winter. The clearing of forests left fields of open spaces, which were soon turned into graveyards.\n\nThe Kovaci Cemetery – Martyrs’ Memorial Cemetery – was the main graveyard used for victims of the Siege of Sarajevo and the sloping, hillside site features thousands of white gravestones. The country’s first president, Alija Izetbegovic, is also buried here, under the small dome.\n\nDirections: Stroll through the cemetery – and note the similar dates on the gravestones. Exit the site on the trail to the east and follow it uphill to the Yellow Bastion.\n\n#26 Yellow Bastion: Best View Of Sarajevo\n\nMAP. The Yellow Bastion dates to the 18th century. The remains are part of the Sarajevo city wall that was built in 1739. Today the Bastion is a park the provides panoramic views over Sarajevo. Although the city is often draped in a blanket of fog with only the tips of minarets and bell towers to puncture through the layer of haze, the Sarajevo city view from the Yellow Bastion is spectacular.\n\nThat ends our free Sarajevo Walking Tour!

Make sure you wear comfortable walking shoes. I like wearing Skechers for city walks – and Kris prefers wearing shoes by Merrell.\n\nTravel Camera\n\nThe city is very photogenic! Rather than using a phone to capture Sarajevo pictures we recommend upgrading to a real camera. We use a DSLR Canon Rebel with a 18-135mm lens. However, if you are looking for something smaller, we suggest using a Canon Powershot, which can fit in a pocket, still takes great shots and is an excellent budget camera option!\n\nSarajevo Weather Gear\n\nDepending on the time of year you visit Sarajevo, you will likely need sunscreen…or a winter jacket or a raincoat!
