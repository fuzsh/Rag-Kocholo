        "text": "Main Goal of this Conference is to promote environmental and sustainable performance measures for existing heritage buildings without adversely impacting their cultural heritage significance. The reuse of heritage buildings has environmental, social, and economic benefits - the three pillars of sustainable development. Heritage conservation is protecting our history, past, present and future. It is the duty of every one of us. Heritage preservation can be considered as an investment in our community that rewards us today and leaves an invaluable resource for future generations. Cultural heritage professionals recognize the synergistic relationship between conservation and sustainability. However, the role of heritage conservation in achieving sustainability has not been well recognized, nor have heritage needs been well integrated into sustainability initiatives. This failure, in some instances, has led to conflict between heritage conservation efforts and environmental regulation. The UN Istanbul Declaration on Human Settlements and the Habitat Agenda of 1996 explored the ramifications of Rio for how we organize the global built environment. The 2003 ‘Global Plan of Action’ stated 2: ‘Conservation, rehabilitation and culturally sensitive adaptive reuse of urban, rural and architectural heritage are also in accordance with the sustainable use of natural and human made resources. Access to culture and the cultural dimension of development is of the utmost importance and all people should be able to benefit from such access.’ Local residents will be encouraged to participate in heritage conservation and sustainable tourism development through awareness raising and income generating activities. Training and support will be provided on heritage-related small business development and design of marketable products. We have recognized that “globalization” engenders, but also understand the futility of resisting its wide spread effects. But architecture will always be “forming” a Place. Architecture is not only the skin in which we are living, it is always a reflection of a specific philosophy of space, movement, life, presence, and has a strong impact on the human spirit. Traditional architecture –our built heritage is deeply associated with nature; it strongly affects our spiritual condition, provides us with a sort of feeling of peace and relaxes. Misunderstanding of heritage has always led to destruction by fashionable trends or internationalist movements, because they are rejecting or marginalizing its own past. This relation not only to exist but we must add the sense of the relation between memory, territory and the quality of a meaningful life which underlies the associative heritage work in considering the importance of place; we highlight the concepts of community resilience and risk management, key aspects of a response to change, while we deﬁne the word “sustainability”, the responsibility of us living people towards the heritage we received and towards the heritage we will leave to our successors, in order to play a pivotal role. All this leads us to a conclusion that there is a need for a new responsible architectural ethical design that will surpass the ego, the pretentious and abstract architectural concepts, but will result in a “dynamic process” through design and buildings life cycle. The British guidance on the Historic Environment, PPG 15, states that: ‘The presence of the physical survivals of our past adds to the quality of our lives, by enhancing the familiar and cherished local scene and sustaining the sense of local distinctiveness which is so important an aspect of the character and appearance of our towns, villages and countryside.’ In addition, many of the large historic buildings are threatened by demolition due to their lack of modern amenities. Thus not only is the context threatened but also the existing historic structures. Many of the estates also had landscapes by well-known designers which are generally not documented and often in poor condition.\" One important dimension of urban protection process is aimed at keeping (preserving) townscapes that people can relate to, where the signs and meanings are clear and the qualities of ambient are recognizable. Most of the conservationists agree that preserving the entire building with its co-relation between structure, interior and exterior is an appropriate course of action. Every effort needs to adapt to the demands of safety and heritage protection in terms of materials and preservation of the original structure. Any intervention will result in specific changes, causing loss of buildings’ authenticity, which means that one must be very careful when deciding on and implementing an intrusive intervention method. Each case should generate an answer on its own. Different case studies must provide us with knowledge to be used in all future interventions.\n\nAfter the first edition of the IFAU 2017 – International Forum on Architecture and Urbanism organised in Tirana, and the second edition of the IFAU 2018 organised in Pescara, Italy, the Polytechnic University of Tirana – Faculty of Architecture and Urbanism (FAU) is organising the third edition: IFAU 2019 – International Forum on Architecture and Urbanism in Tirana, Albania on November 21 - 23, 2019, with the theme “Modernization and Globalization.” IFAU 2019 – 3rd International Forum on Architecture and Urbanism aims to bring together leading academic scientists, researchers, and research scholars to exchange and share their experiences and research results about all aspects of Architecture, Urbanism, Cultural Heritage within Modernisation and Globalisation trends of the XXI century. It also provides the premier interdisciplinary Forum for researchers, practitioners, and educators to present and discuss the most recent innovations, trends, and concerns, practical challenges encountered, and the solutions adopted for the Modernisation and Globalisation in the Cities in Transition. The third edition expands the horizon by introducing a series of overlapping visions spanning the recently institutionalised Adriatic - Ionian Euroregion, now extended to the Balkan and South-East European regions. The Forum will concentrate on Architecture, Urbanism, Cultural Heritage located in contexts and territories that reveal their tendencies to Modernisation and Globalisation. Modernisation and Globalization Architecture, Urbanism and Heritage provide a multi-faceted analysis that is based on the understandings of architects and urban planners working in both the developed and developing countries traditions. Globalisation is a broad concept concerning the diversity of regions, cultures, and actors and the diversity of analytical approaches that can be employed to study it. During the past decade, notions of globalisation have displaced familiar discourses of modernisation. We consider Modernisation and Globalization as a process that naturally links the past, the present and the future - as a bridge between the past and the future. Current events such as the cultural heritage protection crisis illustrate that the discussion should not be confined to specific geographic regions or narrowly defined analysis methods but in a broader and deeper search spectrum. The research presented in this Forum embraces the need to cover various aspects and dimensions of Modernisation and Globalisation in Architecture, Urbanism and Cultural Heritage, to see both its local and its global manifestations. From our perspective, globalisation studies imply research that is not just limited to the most popular spheres of globalisation but also includes the study of global problems such as sustainable development, cultural heritage, etc. In summary, the distinctive character of Modernisation and Globalisation is that it delivers an extensive international and multicultural thematic issue associated with Architecture, Urbanism and Cultural Heritage, including their impact on particular cultural-geographic regions. The Modernisation and Globalisation of territories and cities in transition is the object of this Forum. Through contributions from colleagues and scholars from different international universities, the intention is to explore different interpretations of contexts, to study processes of Modernisation and Globalisation in territories and cities in transition, to define strategies for urban transformation and to confront issues raised by environmental and architectural sustainability, all framed by an up-to-date and contemporary vision of the entire Adriatic-Ionian and Balkan region. Culture and the strength of ideas are viewed as the essential tools for building bridges between knowledge and rediscovering, in a new relationship between Architecture, Urbanism and Cultural Heritage, the key to interpreting the processes transforming territories and cities. The conference program will include the topic of interest that include, but are not limited to: 1. Global/local modernisations; 2. XXth century modernism and the question of cultural heritage; 3. Phenomena of regeneration, revitalisation, recycling, reuse; 4. Modernisation/globalisation of urban planning/design and landscapes; 5. Modern housing; 6. Modern designing and daily life/universal design; 7. The utilisation of future technologies; 8. Sustainability in the era of modernisation/globalisation.\n\nSpecific political and social conditions which characterized certain societies of Central and Eastern Europe after the Second World War conditioned the identity of architectural heritage built in the period 1945–1990 in these territories. Since architecture tends to reflect life principles of a certain society at a given moment in its history, the ideology of socialism, which defined not just political and economic sphere, but moreover tended to organize everyday lifestyle on certain ideas, became somewhat reflected in the programme of architecture practiced in these societies. This ‘ideological’ character of architecture prejudices valorization of an architectural work when it is approached as heritage. For that reason, modern and eventually postmodern heritage found in countries such as Bosnia and Herzegovina, a territory which from 1945 until 1990 was a part of the socialist Yugoslavia, becomes judged because of its historical character. Consequently, the jeopardy to cultural character of a certain asset becomes the main criteria when Bosnian and Herzegovinian heritage protection authorities approach the protection of heritage in question. This reflects the data that majority of enlisted assets are those of memorial nature. However, besides disabling proper evaluation of achievements in the domain of architecture at a given period, such an approach furthermore prejudices the public perception of architecture in question. Therefore, the aim of the paper is to point out benefits of expanding the range of types and categories of works with the potential of being classified as heritage, while advocating a creative approach on evaluation, interpretation and eventual revitalization of such works in order to recover their social wholesomeness and cultural prominence.\n\nThe interpretation of architectural work has a particular significance when the work itself is endangered and in the need for a protection and revitalization. Different theoretical premises for interpretation of architectural work are formulated in relation to different perceptions on the cultural character and identity of the society in determined historical and political moment. Therefore, a various cultural positions upon valorization of heritage’s significance transform into different approaches on architectural heritage revitalization. This way the cultural contextualization of architectural heritage ultimately influences the selection of adequate technical methods and constructive techniques for its revitalization which consequently can result in alteration of the character of revitalized heritage, or in the other hand, alteration of heritage’s role within the society. The first question approached in the paper investigates a development of theoretical positions on re-interpretation of heritage’s values and features in the process of its revitalization. Here, case studies on revitalization of several iconic buildings of architectural heritage in the second half of the twentieth century in Sarajevo and Barcelona enable to perceive how the practice on heritage revitalization operates upon three concepts: the conservational, the interventionist and the symbolist (negativist) approach. The acceptance of disparate values of heritage is the main substance that differentiates one approach from another. The conservational approach departs from the premise that heritage’s value and thus its architectural authenticity are inflexible categories, frozen in time, caught in space, and therefore non-subjected to cultural and architectural (re)interpretations, while the symbolic approach by completely relying on intangible values of heritage and endeavoring to merely preserve symbolical significance the property together with overall proficiencies of architecture as technique and profession is in stark contrast to the first approach. In the same time, the interventionist approach strives to give same importance to tangible and intangible values of the heritage, and thus it endorses creative interpretation of legacy in revitalization in order to enable appreciation the cultural perception of heritage as a dynamic category. The insight into different case studies of revitalized architectural heritage provides a tool to question the dynamics of change of property’s architectural and cultural character, its re-layering and restructuring. The investigation presented in this paper follows from a comprehensive master study which investigated the process of revitalization of the several iconic buildings in Sarajevo and Barcelona that due to damage or degradation in the course (second half) of the 20th century were revitalized. because it was evaluated that they are of importance in architectural and cultural terms for Bosnian and Catalan societies. The findings of the research however are summarized and for the purposes of this paper described by three sets of examples: The Sarajevo City Hall and the Barcelona Grand Theatre Liceu, the Barcelona Santa Catarina Market and the Parliament and Council of Ministers building in Sarajevo and the White Sherefudin’s Mosque (Visoko). The investigation of given case studies is presented through analysis of the process of revitalization in terms of interpretation of their architectural features, that is design, material, technological and structural singularities in relation to their social significance. The objective of the analysis is to enable to establish paradigms on semiotic understanding of cultural identity in correlation to architectural heritage. This how the investigation on revitalization of heritage in question reveals to be a possible tool for analysis of cultural, political, economic and social positions within the (two) societies which in the investigated period have passed through process of national and cultural self-redefinition and re-interpretation. In this way the insight in the processes of construction, interpretation, valorization and finally revitalization of selected case studies permits observing the changes of perspectives within Catalan and Bosnian-Herzegovinian cultural identities, since the presented examples in the course of the 20th century have been used as iconological representatives of their national characters. The various interpretations of architectural heritage in those two different cultural backgrounds thus has led to establishment of a general concept on cultural perception and subservience of architectural heritage in accordance with needs of ideological (national, cultural, ethnic) agendas. From this arises a second problem approached in the paper: In what way and how a different social viewpoints, movements and trends of internal cultural self-perception within the society are perceivable on revitalized material artifacts? Approaching this question could facilitate establishing common ground for the improvement of processes of heritage revitalization. Finally, the aim of the investigation was to anticipate the dangers of partial analysis of artistic features of architectural work and one-sided understanding of heritage’s cultural properties, and thus confirm the need for the complex and interdisciplinary approach to build heritage. At the moment when contemporary society balances between the urge to pursue further technological progress and the need for recovery of primeval spiritual connection with the world, the profession on protection and revitalization of architectural heritage faces the challenge to preserve the image of the world while allowing it to continue to change. Therefore, this paper advocates the comprehensive interpretation of a constructed imaginary as the only possible way for preservation of creative potential contained in architectural legacy of past generations."
