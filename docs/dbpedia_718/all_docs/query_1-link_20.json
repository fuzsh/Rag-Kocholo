        "text": "ABSTRACT: The authors of this article present an analysis of architectural education at Slovak University of Technology (SUT) in Bratislava, Slovakia. The reason for the summary analysis is to mark the 70th anniversary of architectural education in Slovakia and to acknowledge the 40 years of existence of an independent Faculty of Architecture. The aim of the article is neither to criticise the current state of affairs nor to formulate a programme for the future of architectural education. The article describes things as they are and leaves room for discussion about things as they should be, which must primarily occur via more flexible communication techniques and media. The educational context is documented with examples of current student projects - output in individual subjects/courses. Examples of student work consist in the contemporary output; however, for those who remember explicitly architecture-oriented education, they are a proof that the substance of the education changes only through the inclusion of main topics selected by the institutions. Modifications to the current status in comparison to the optimism of memories correspond with the objective development of the position of architecture.\n\nChanges in the teaching of the basic spatial concept in Slovakia over the past 50 years is the subject of this article. During this time, education was influenced by global architectural trends producing various educational paradigms. These are described by three generations of pedagogues discussing their works. The first generation deals with the process based on typology and functional-programmatic relations according to the form follows function principle. The second generation considers the postmodern experimental approaches, applying the opposite idea that function follows form and the emergence of the digital turn in architecture. The third generation is inspired by the digital turn, accelerated by data accessibility and artificial intelligence. Each of these is diametrically different but intertwined in education to this day. The new forms of teaching have an impact on the classic profile of a graduate as a universal architect and imply new directions for architectural practice.\n\nThe paper considers prospects for the integration of the Russian higher schools of architecture into the international higher education space using the case of the Ural Architectural School as an example. There are certain common features shared by most of the Russian schools of architecture. Firstly, the paper reviews the problems and contradictions that USUAA has come across since 2003 when Russia set out to align its higher education programmes with the international higher education system. Secondly, the paper outlines Russia’s approach to quality assurance in higher architectural education based on national educational standards. These standards define the structure of the course programs in all subject areas. The architectural schools are obliged to develop the contents of their education programs in conformity with the relevant federal educational standard. Thirdly, the author considers the experiences of the Ural Architectural School in light of the above contradictions and features and discusses the structure of the USUAA’s Bachelor Degree course of architecture and the outcomes of its validation by the UIA/UNESCO experts. Currently USUAA is reviewing its architecture teaching practices and teaching model to ensure that the school keeps its key strengths whilst modifying the contents of its course of architecture and rethinking the teaching and learning paradigm in line with the international integration agenda.\n\nWhen modernizing the curricula at the Faculty of Architecture of the University of Belgrade, some fields of study have been somewhat neglected, including the teaching of traditional architecture, which is currently studied only at a basic level. Many students complete their education without adequate knowledge in this field, and this has affected the current situation of architectural practice in Serbia. Two optional courses were initiated to try to fill this gap, with different approaches to the study of traditional architecture. One course focuses on the study of traditional building techniques and materials related to the historical building context. The other course explores the correlation between traditional and sustainable architecture, following the idea that the latter is closely connected to traditional architecture. These teaching experiences, their problems and their outcome will be presented in this paper.\n\nIn the mid-19th century, European countries underwent significant changes in their economies. To a large extent they were facilitated by the development of railways. The ability to transport goods quickly and cheaply by land facilitated industrial development and urban growth. The growing needs of the economy created the need for educated specialists who could successfully meet the increasing demands. Riga was not an exception in these processes. A decision inspired by local entrepreneurs was made to educate specialists locally instead of attracting them from other countries. Established in 1862, the Riga Polytechnic was the first institution of higher technical education in the Baltic region. Already in the first decade of its operation, the Department of Architecture (DA) was opened. This study is aimed at identifying and evaluating the circumstances that impacted the formation of architectural education in Riga and estimating the contribution of DA graduates to the urban landscap..."
