As Dwight learned, fool me twice and it is strike three.\n\nPost by HealyHoya on\n\nThis might be an odd question but...with III's system, do we actually want a seven-footer at center? I know, I know, Hibbs is the man. I agree. I love him and this team. That said, would III's system work more effectively with a perimeter oriented big-man?\n\nPost by hoyasexy on\n\nHealy, I hear you, but the write-ups on this guy make him sound a little different from Hibbs. It sounds like he's pretty comfortable knocking down the 10-12 footer. While I'm not sure that a \"pure\" center would thrive in this offense, one who can hit the mid-range jumper can probably fit in pretty well. And lord knows, it never hurts to have a 7 footer around for defense and rebounding.\n\nPost by Jack on\n\ngphoya said:\n\nSomeone please tell me that Stoneridge Prep is a legitimate academic institution and not just a place where 7-footers get their academic records sanitized for NCAA eligibility puposes. As Dwight learned, fool me twice and it is strike three.\n\nFrom their website:\n\nStoneridge Prep of Simi Valley, one of the nation's elite prep basketball programs, has been recertified by the NCAA following a three-month audit of Stoneridge and approximately 100 other schools.\n\nThe NCAA began the audit this year in an effort to crack down on so-called \"diploma mills\" with loose academic standards and requirements for high-profile prep basketball players.\n\nThe NCAA has found 25schools from which it will no longer accept academic credentials to be used in the NCAA initial-eligibility certification process. Among those still under review are Oak Hill Academy (Va.), Fork Union Military Academy (Va.), Bridgton Academy (Maine) and Patterson School (N.C.).\n\nwww.stoneridgeschool.com/latest-news.php?n=8\n\nSo the bad news is that someone had to ask. The good news is they passed the test.\n\nPost by GPHoya on\n\nJack:\n\nI hope our standards are higher than the NCAA's and the bad news is enough for me to be very wary of any of these prep schools. Of course, every kid deserves to be considered on his merits, but no one can claim to be surprised or excused for failing due diligence given the lesson learned from the Lutheran experience. This had better not be shruted.\n\nPost by hoyasexy on\n\ngphoya said:\n\nJack:\n\nI hope our standards are higher than the NCAA's and the bad news is enough for me to be very wary of any of these prep schools. Of course, every kid deserves to be considered on his merits, but no one can claim to be surprised or excused for failing due diligence given the lesson learned from the Lutheran experience. This had better not be shruted.\n\nIf the \"Lutheran experience\" is a reference to Egerson, all the reports regarding his transfer to Delaware seem to indicate that he is transferring in fine academic standing.\n\nPost by HealyHoya on\n\nFine academic standing when transferring out of Georgetown is one, an inability to handle the academic rigors of a top-25 institution is another. while wishing marc the best (and I don't know why Marc decided to leave the Hilltop), III has to be aware of which recruits can carry the water as student-athletes\n\nPost by GPHoya on\n\nHowever Marc left and my beef is not with him, he never should have been admitted out of the complete sham and embarassment that was Lutheran. A mistake that can not be repeated.\n\nPost by lichoya68 on\n\nDID WE GET THIS GUY NEED A SEVEN FOOTER NEED A SEVEN FOOTER WHEN ROY GRADUATES DID WE GET HIM OR NO BEAT VANDY AND GET ANOTHER SEVEN FOOTER ESPECIALLY NAMED BOUBACAR YES YES EYS BEAT VANDY"
