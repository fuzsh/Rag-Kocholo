This document is the abstract for a PhD dissertation submitted by Wendell Hassan Marsh to Columbia University in 2018. The dissertation is titled \"Compositions of Sainthood: The Biography of Ḥājj ʿUmar Tāl by Shaykh Mūsā Kamara\". It explores Shaykh Mūsā Kamara's Arabic biography of the influential 19th century Muslim leader and saint Ḥājj ʿUmar Tāl of Senegal. The biography is situated within the context of representations of saintly authority in colonial French West Africa. The dissertation argues the biography addresses three paradoxes - the contradiction between spiritual and temporal authority, differing arguments around saintly authority",
