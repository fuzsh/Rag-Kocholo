        "text": "KELETIGUI ET SES TAMBOURINIS\n\nTHE SYLIPHONE YEARS (Stern's STCD3031-32)\n\nAs I noted a few months ago, Australian musicologist Graeme Counsel got a special \"Endangered archives\" grant from the British Library to go to Guinée and preserve their musical patrimony, and this two-disc set represents the latest installment in his massive preservation effort on behalf of the West African culture. First we had Authenticité, a sampler of the Syliphone label from 1965 to 1980. Then he got specific and gave us definitive double-disc sets of Balla et ses Balladins and Bembeya Jazz. I shouldn't say definitive because once you hear these bands you want every note they ever recorded, but as far as tasters go, they were the top-table smorgie pig-out like those TV ads you see for steak, shrimp and the endless salad bar (beware: they use a tiny fork to make the steaks look bigger than they are!). Bembeya are well known and Les Balladins are legendary: Keletigui falls somewhere in between. I have two of his albums, and one of them (SLP30) is heavily sampled on this compilation; a track from the other (Le Retour) was on the Authenticité comp & another is here as the closer. What I had forgotten was that Keletigui was also in La Paillote, one of the first national orchestras and also a true supergroup, with Momo Wandel on sax and other big names. Their song known as \"Yarabi\" was covered by many West African artists. This 2-disc comp launches into 5 tracks from La Paillote and right-away you are in the hands of master musicians -- the singer, Kerfala Camara is extremely laid-back, the guitar of Facelli Kanté has enough echo to make you think it's haunted. The out-of-tune trumpet bounces around the refrain of \"Fruitaguinée,\" an ad for home-made fruit juice.\n\nWhile President Sekou Touré urged musical authenticité, which led to a revitalization of the traditional songs of his homeland, he did not proscribe Cuban music (since the Guinéan government was allied with Fidel) so there's loads of corny \"Peanut Vendors\" (\"Tambourinis cocktail\") & \"Guantanameras\" (or as Robert of Round World used to say, \"One ton of merda!\") in the repertoire. What we have here is a collection of rare 45s, in fine fidelity, that give a picture of the band as it rode the charts at home. I like the squeaky version of \"La loma de Belen,\" with (I guess) Momo Wandel on soprano. And the second disc tilts into \"Guajira con tumbao,\" a B side worthy of rediscovery. The rumbas and chachas are fun but there's also the militant stuff and loads of the familiar Syliphone sound, with swirling guitars, horns and balafon continuo. The Guineans have that uncanny knack of making a four-minute song sound like it's ten minutes long! Most of it is fresh and it's a fabulous assemblage guaranteed to restore Keletigui to his place in the top flight of Guinean artists.\n\nKIMI DIABATE\n\nKARAM (Cumbancha CMB-CD12)\n\nA sweet new disc from Guinea-Bissau is from the Cumbancha label, which promotes musical discoveries from all corners of the planet. The arrangements have horns, guitars and electric bass to fill out the traditional instruments: balafon, kora and West African percussion. Diabaté (who plays guitar, balafon and percussion) is a griot and his songs are steeped in the traditions of his native land. As a youth Kimi toured with the National Ensemble and settled in Lisbon, where he has collaborated with Mory Kante, Waldemar Bastos and others. He sings about poverty, freedom, women's rights and love; in short he is a modern griot. Nevertheless there is the strength of tradition to the album, albeit better recorded than efforts by the previous generation. This is most noticeable in the ballads. I have just read Mungo Park's journal of his travels in this part of the world. It starts slowly and gradually tightens its grip: it was certainly the worst possible journey in the world, and the amazing thing is when the naive Quixotic Mungo made it out in one piece, back to Guinea & the safety of a foreign ship, he got together a bigger expedition to go back! Talk about dogged determination. (This time he took 30 soldiers with him to their death!) This was two centuries ago: he was the first white man to try anything so foolhardy as a 500-mile trek to figure out which way the Niger flowed. He was robbed and imprisoned constantly and only escaped death by posing as a Moor, since the natives were in fear of the Arab horsemen who enslaved them. He mentions large groups of kora players preceding processions (coffles) and singing about their journey to gain admittance to villages on the way. Park would present the dooty or chief with $2 worth of amber beads (or more if they demanded it), and in return would get meat and milk. It's an amazing picture of a primitive life where the neighbouring villages were constantly at war and kidnapped each other to sell into slavery. It was not until modern times, the post-colonial era, that the West African countries settled into stability so their culture could blossom in tranquility, and Guineans who had Portuguese settlements in their midst and the usual addictions to foreign vice and luxury could overcome their dependence on outsiders. The Afro-Latin connection which flows back to much West African music is felt here in the lilting balafon, the horn arrangements and what we imagine are the purer strains of the kora melodies.\n\nBALLA ET SES BALLADINS\n\nTHE SYLIPHONE YEARS (Sterns 3035-6)\n\nThis is one of the most-anticipated releases of the year, and I have to admit I was disappointed when I first put it on. In fact I was dumbfounded because it starts with most of the Jardin de Guinée album that came out on Syllart not so long ago. I began to think this was padding to make the set stretch to a double disc. And for a single dose of Les Balladins, nothing tops the Günter Gretz compilation in his African Dancefloor series (PAM ADC 302). \"Sara 70\" the gem of that set is repeated here. Indeed, four of the best tracks on here are also on REMINISCIN IN TEMPO, but you know everything these guys did is gold, so it's ultimately a real thrill to get hold of this box set, especially when you get to disc two. And here something has to be said in praise of the Syliphone engineer Moussa Konaté. So much African music of the 70s is murky, but the Syliphone studios sound clear as a bell. The compiler, Graeme Counsel sidestepped some heavily anthologized songs: \"Samba,\" \"Diaraby\" and \"Mana Mana,\" so there's more out there on other comps for new fans to discover. \"Yo te contras Maria,\" the B side to \"Diaraby\" is included (the A side is on AUTHENTICITÉ, Counsel's previous Syliphone compilation album from Sterns, so not included here). \"Yo te contras Maria\" shows a return to Cuban music which President Touré originally wanted dropped from the bands' repertoires, but, as ties with Fidel strengthened, many of the Guinean bands got to tour to Cuba.\n\nSekou Diabate with singer Manfila \"Soba\" Kante\n\nBut Counsel could not avoid the previously anthologized \"Kognö koura,\" nor indeed \"Sara 70,\" one of the most gorgeous songs ever recorded, thanks largely to the spectacular guitar runs by Sekou \"Docteur\" Diabate on his Gibson SG. I have a post-it on my PAM disc, left-over from my DJ days, with the note \"Dr Nico influence,\" as if I needed reminding. He even goes into \"Merengue Nico\" at one point. A surprise entry is a song called \"Manta Lokoka\" which is the name of a Brazzaville band who scored some hits in the 60s. It is played in the kiri kiri style of Nico. Great alto sax from Pivi and then Sekou Diabate kicks out the Brazzavillainous jams. It's my new favourite song by them. \"Sakhodougou\" and \"Kaïra\" (originally two side of a single) are old friends, with percussive guitar punctuated by horns, leading to a big swelling horn chorus played at third intervals. \"Kaïra\" means happiness. It was written in 1946 and became an anthem of the independence movements in west Africa in the 1960s. Manfila Soba Kanté's vocals blend with the crisply articulated guitar, the strident clarinet, the choral horns. \"Ancient combatant,\" another single from the group, is equally wondrous: tightly arranged & delivered with an appropriate martial air, and some great use of Echoplex, but it seems to fade before it's over. The romping B side is included also.\n\nMuch of the Balladins' success lies in the instrumentation: both leaders, Balla and Pivi are horn players rather than guitarists or singers. Pivi plays a sexy trombone; Balla is a fiery trumpeter, and in addition they feature soprano, tenor, and alto sax, as well as clarinet and flute. There's even piano on one track (\"Bedianamo\"). They were both serious musicologists, deeply into folkloric research & were drafted into the Syli Orchestre National in January 1959. With the proclamation of an Authenticité movement at independence, Balla was sent to Italy to buy equipment for 60 bands! He and Pivi played at the Jardin de Guinée while a third member of the national orchestra played across town at the Bar de la Paillote. Eventually both bands became named for their leaders: Balla et ses Balladins, and Kélétigui et ses Tambourinis. At one point government interference transfered several band members to back Miriam Makeba and assigned a new singer to the band. Balla told the minister off and was demoted (they were government employees after all) so the band became Pivi et les Balladins. But at a concert at Le Palais du Peuple which was attended by the president, when they were introduced as Pivi et les Balladins, President Sékou Touré asked, \"Since when?\" and demanded Balla be put back in charge. Pivi and Balla remained partners & continued to make music into the 80s. After the death of Touré and a coup in 1984, funding for the arts was cut and the group disbanded. Many West African styles are represented in their music. There may even be country and western in there too, but when the guitar starts to wail I hear the muezzin. This is magical. There are people who would pay ANYTHING to get more of it, so perhaps the Complete Works is called for. A century from now, when we are over racist notions of primitivism, Balla, Pivi and Co will be seen as important to their time as Johann Strauss was to his 19th-century Viennese culture.\n\nLES AMAZONES DE GUINEE\n\nWAMATO (STERN'S STCD1106)\n\n\"Ah-ha! Le retour en force des Amazones de Guinée!\" Thus begins this wonderful outing by the great all-woman band from Guinée's Military Police force, Les Amazones. The story of all-women groups is not particularly distinguished and mired in bands that are only fronted by women for the sake of merchandising. (There's the Bangles, the Donnas, Bananarama, the Dixie Chicks, the Gogos, the Shaggs, the Spice Girls, the Twelve Girls Band of China, the nazi teen twins of Prussian Blue, Puffy Ami Yumi among a host of J-Pop outfits, etc. Wikipedia lists dozens more but it makes sad reading & would make a worse playlist.) While it's novel, it's silly to celebrate Les Amazones as an all-woman band, but let's appreciate the fact that they are a long-established band and can still kick out the jams. This is only their second album: their first Au coeur de Paris (Bolibana, 1983) made it to my African TOP 50 with Balla & ses Balladins, Bembeya Jazz and Djeli Moussa Diawara. Pretty exclusive company. They were formed in 1961 as the Women's Orchestra of the Guinée Militia -- not a very inspiring name -- but as soon as they took the stage (out of their fatigues) they were called \"goddesses\" or \"tigresses\" and wowed audiences all across Africa. So a more glamorous name was called for. About 1985 they were supposed to tour the USA. I heard they were to play at Manyatta, a small Kenyan-owned nightclub in Oakland. I called the owner and confirmed. I hyped the show like crazy on the radio, playing the album all night, giving away tickets to ecstatic fans. But on the night the sad truth dawned, they weren't even in the country; it was all a dream. 25 years later they are better than ever. There's a great spontaneity to the playing. The rhythms chug, the horns accentuate, everyone knows their part so well. They are confident in call and response vocals, call and response guitar and horns. But it's more than military discipline, it's collective intuition from years of playing together. The chef d'orchestre is bass player Commander Salématou Diallo. She recruited some new members as the lead guitarist died four years ago and other members have retired after their years of military service. Lead singer M'mah Sylla and guest vocalist Aminata Kamissoko add a glossy sheen; Commandant Djenabou Bah and Mariama Camara give a whole new meaning to \"military brass\" while Capitaine Mato Camara on timbales, Capitaine Elisabeth Camara on congas and Mamade Cissé on drums keep a beat that is stirring rather than merely martial. Guest percussionist Adama Diarra throws in some blasting djembe and there's a couple of guest guitarists, including Sekou Kante who did the arrangements. Yaya Kouyaté on solo guitar and N'Sira Tounkara on rhythm outstrip their cohorts in the other national ensembles. The set is diverse, there's even a birthday song and they end with a sweet little salsa number.\n\nAUTHENTICITE\n\nTHE SYLIPHONE YEARS (Stern's STCD3025-26)\n\nThe LP era lasted fifty years (1948-98). It gave my generation a time-frame, 42 minutes, in which an artist would make a musical statement. Of course there were singles and then the 90-minute cassette, but we viewed them in the context of that 42 minute stretch. When it worked it was perfection. CDs were longer but inevitably slacker. Everyone agreed they were a poor substitute for LPs, but downloads are the nadir. There's nothing there but a sine wave (sounds like a bad cold), so while the record industry goes into meltdown, a generation grows up unaware of the tangible joy of the LP or the luxury of the gatefold album cover with 12-inch square ephemera included, a booklet bound in, or a crazy essay to read (without glasses) while listening to Coltrane or Frank Zappa. Now fans are falling back to the CD package as fungible for the LP experience, in a post-modern, bonsai-ed way.\n\nStern's has come up trumps with AUTHENTICITE a double-CD with a separate 44-page full-colour booklet that chronicles the great Guinean dance bands from 1965-80. The documentation is thorough, with great photos, album covers wonderfully reproduced (looking brand new in fact, thanks to Photoshop), and a snappy design that cleverly uses postage stamps to remind us of other obsessive compulsive collectors out there. (But, as I am fond of saying, just remember, philately will get you nowhere!) Once again Graeme Counsel, who did the classic Bembeya Jazz reissue in 2004, does the honours. The two discs are divided chronologically. The first is the less-familiar stuff and even includes unreleased material! We start off at a leisurely gait with Keletigui & his Tambourinis doing \"Soundiata,\" a griot epic with a nice mix of horns, an asymmetric thud on the bass every now and then, and great solo guitar snaking through it. Balla & his Balladins follow up as we settle in for the ride. \"Djanfamagni,\" a track from Bembeya Jazz (covering a well-known Manding song) cruises the \"Peanut Vendor\" changes. Continuing in a Latin vein, \"Kankan-yarabi\" by Orchestre de la Paillote has lovely vocals with trumpet and sax (Keletigui again) solos. Appropriately, for a song called \"Information\" by Kebendo Jazz we get some crucial information, for Counsel tells us on page 22 that, in addition to the 75 singles and 82 LP records that constitute the output of Syliphone, the radio station in Conakry has dozens of reel-to-reel masters of all the Guinean national and local bands performing. From the sound quality this is a remarkably intact archive, and there are more gems to be discovered. The first set ends with the magisterial Bembeya again doing \"Boiro,\" with the perfect pairing of Demba Camara's vocals and Sekou Diabaté's guitar.\n\nDespite too many praise songs for political organizations with initials for names, the first disc alone would be worth the price of admission, but there's more. It's safe to say you don't have any of the material on the first disc, but this compilation represents the cream of the whole range of official regional as well as unofficial local bands of Guinea, so there are some old favourites on the second disc, which covers the years 1972-80. After a storming \"Kouma\" by the 22 Novembre Band we get \"Miri Magnin\" by Keletigui (heard on the DISCOTHEQUE 73 CD), with long instrumental breaks featuring Keletigui, first on sax, then or organ. Pivi and the Balladins give us \"Samba\" (as heard on the DISCOTHEQUE 72 CD), one of my all-time fave ravers. Bembeya Jazz's \"Bembeya\" has been anthologized before, but this is an alternate take from a 45. The chorus is a little croaky, but the guitar is sublime. Horoya Band's rhythmically complex \"Wèrè wèrè\" was also on the DISCOTHEQUE 73 CD. There is a cover of it on Camayenne Sofa's LA PERCEE. Sombory Jazz's \"Nana\" is a gem that has not been anthologized before. Palm Jazz's \"Zimaï\" has a more Congolese feel to it and changes things up midway through the second set. Syli Authentique's moody \"Fabara\" appeared on the Syliphone 40th Anniversary album, volume 1, but fortunately there's not a lot of overlap with that other superb two-disc set. \"Fabara,\" with its echoey guitar and big room boom, is haunting. Counsel tells us the band members were about 15 when it was recorded: they were considered traditionalists and were facing off nightly against all six of the national bands in Conakry, along with the Sofas and Kaloum Star (an excellent band, still extant I believe). \"Karamoko\" appears on Camayenne Sofa's ATTAQUE... disc. Again echoey guitar floats over cantering percussion. If you are lucky you have some of these vinyl LPs. There were a few mint copies of the Simandou de Beyla and Tropical Djoli Band albums circulating a few years ago and I grabbed them to add to my modest shelf of 18 Syliphone LPs. The Nimba Jazz track, \"Ziko,\" is another overlooked classic. If you can stand this much good news, there are three other double CDs projected from this material, each devoted to a single band: Bembeya Jazz, Keletigui, Balla. It doesn't get better than that.\n\nAFRICAN PEARLS vol 2: GUINÉE\n\nCULTURAL REVOLUTION (Syllart)\n\nThis looks promising until you read the track list and realize it's Ibrahim Sylla up to his old tricks. It's a reissue of the Syliphone 40th Anniversary CD from circa 2000, and a few miscellaneous tracks from Bembeya Jazz and other bands that were in the Guinée Discothèque series. Now that I have established that, despite the similar name, Sylla is not connected to the Syliphone label I am less eager to give him my money and will save up for more of the original LPs. Sure it's great music but a pretty package doesn't make it sound any better. While there are two or three titles I don't immediately recognize who's to say they are not just songs with slightly revised names? \"Kankan diarabi\" could be one of three or four songs called \"Diarabi\" that are already on CD. \"Abdree\" must surely be \"Andree\" by Syli Authentique that is found on Discothèque 75. The typographical error approach to selling music does not guarantee return customers. There's a Mali volume, one from Congo and probably a Senegal in this series also. I checked the Mali playlist against my holdings and found it is a partial reissue of MUSIQUE DU MALI Sira Mori. This was one of two double-disc sets that came out a decade ago and are worth having in their full length. The other pair was called Banzoumana. Again I wonder about some of the titles. Now we find \"Bakari Dian\" by Super Biton de Segou. On Sira Mory it's \"Bakary Jan\" by Banzoumana Sissoko. It's great music if you don't already have it, but I will only be disappointed if I buy it for the four (of 20) titles I don't immediately find on my shelf to discover they were released under different names. Ultimately the reason I don't play these a lot is the sequencing. They lurch from folkloric to electric tracks back and forth so don't sustain a mood. Some of them are poorly mastered. I keep them because they have important historic tracks and every now and then if I am trying to find, say, an obscure Rail Band track it might be on one of these anthologies, so they were useful for me in my DJ days. Overall the Guinée set is more consistent and I would recommend it, if you don't have any Bembeya Jazz (\"Petit Sekou\" has been anthologized three times already), any of the Discothèque series, or the wonderful two volumes of Syliphone 40th Anniversary that contain over half of these tracks.\n\nBEMBEYA JAZZ NATIONAL\n\nTHE SYLIPHONE YEARS: HITS AND RARE RECORDINGS (Sterns STCD3029-30)\n\nI've already written a lot about this, one of my favourite African bands. Stern's has produced yet another handsome package and revisited their recent Bembeya on Syliphone double disc with remastered sound and an expanded selection. Two and a half hours of Syliphone music from the 60s and 70s is a mini-vacation from the real world: a mental spa. The 44-page booklet has been redesigned (up from 28 pages) and is much better, the pictures are big enough to see and the typography is legible. If you didn't buy the disc the first time, there is now an added track: \"Guantanamera\" which was previously only available as a download from the Stern's site. If you did buy it, give it to someone as a gift and buy this one too!\n\nBembeya Jazz is one of the top-rank African bands. From their founding in 1961 until today they have put out consistently great albums. In the 1960s and 70s they recorded for the Syliphone label in Conakry which has come to be recognized as one of the great treasure troves of popular African music. Graeme Counsel has put together a thoroughly documented and pretty much definitive double-disc of the band's greatest recordings. It must have been hard narrowing the choice down to 27 tracks but, even if you think you have them all, this album is a revelation.\n\nIn 2002, I was at a houseparty for Bembeya Jazz on their North American tour and the hostess introduced me to some of the younger band members as someone who knew more about their music than they did. Needless to say I was highly embarassed but I did get into a great conversation in French with several of the band members and found about their likes, influences and so on. I was humbled before these great musicians because I deeply love their music and had spent 25 years trying to find it. Now this music is getting the respect and attention it deserves. For a long time companies like Sonodisc tossed about the legacy of Africa (in their case the Congo) like it was brussels sprouts, but gradually new companies have come along, like Stern's, Soundways, Crammed Disc, Sharp Wood, PAM and Dakar Sound to name a few who are giving the music its due with intelligent liner notes, smart programming and handsome packaging. Bembeya is head of a long list of bands worthy of this treatment. True, when you have the magical sounds of Sekou Diabate on guitar you only need your imagination, but the presentation is an added thrill with artwork from obscure singles and EPs and band photos. Now you know how great the music is and will have to get this CD anyway. I am always first to say why buy it on CD when you have it on vinyl and in some cases on CD also?! Seven of the tracks appeared on \"Hommage a Demba Camara,\" a fantastic compilation (see my TOP 50 AFRICAN ALBUMS) saluting the band's singer who died in a car accident at the height of their fame in 1973. The cream of that album is skimmed here.\n\nDisc 1 has 14 tracks of which 10 have appeared on CD, four of them duplicated on 2 CD issues. However many of the Guinean Discotheque anthologies had a single Bembeya track strewn like stardust across a chill desert sky, and only a diehard would have made their own compilation to assemble the loose bits from their many singles and albums. The tracks stand out in the context of those albums, reminding us of the importance of the band, but their momentum is wasted. You really need to listen to an uninterrupted two and a half hours of Bembeya which is why you have to buy this compilation! You get an uninterrupted flow of musical magic that builds on each track and is pretty soon flying in the empyrean as Sekou weaves his web. Track 2 \"Sabor de guajira\" (which was the B side of their first single) shows them already masters of the Cuban charanga form as Sekou whips out a spectacular glittering lead. He pulls in behind the vocalist but sustains a bell-like pealing that echoes the clave, while the horns bleat like lost sheep. None of the renowned Senegalese bands ever approached a Cuban cover with as much success. This was due not so much to Bembeya's musical skill as to their understanding of tradition. Bembeya were pioneers in bridging the gap from the kora and balafon music of their parents to the burgeoning pop sensibilities of switched-on electric youth. There was no learning curve with this band: they came out running and already had a fully developed big sound anatomized into punchy horns and giddily spiraling guitar leads. Add the great percussion, vocals and chorus and you have an unbeatable formula. One of the new-to-CD tracks, a shameless plug for \"Air Guinée\" from their first LP, is quite funny with the band yelling out \"Securite! comfort! vitesse!\" before locking into a rocking E-minor A-minor jam. The next track also starts with a spoken part (perhaps they were listening to the funny intros to Congolese singles of the time.) \"Super tentemba\" (at 14 minutes the longest cut on here) was two sides of a single and shows them masters of the shifting terrain of a mental trip, like their neighbours the Rail Band, as they journey across the sonic landscape. It also sounds like a live recording, their spontaneity adding to the excitement as solo spots move around the band.\n\nCD 2 has 12 tracks of which 11 have appeared on CD (three of them twice); only the first cut, \"Beyla,\" is previously not collected on CD. It's from the rare LP \"Guinée An X\" (a reference to the tenth year of independence). The sound is a bit rough, leading me to wonder what shape the Syliphone archives are in. Remarkably many of Bembeya's best tunes were B sides to 45s (though wisely collected on albums and CDs later). The first disc includes 5 B sides, four of them better than their A sides! Graeme Counsel, who compiled this disc and wrote the excellent liner notes explaining each song, points out the traditional dance rhythm underlying one of their masterpieces \"Moussogbe,\" from AUTHENTICITE 73 PARADE AFRICAINE (SLP39 on vinyl; 38221-2 on CD). The staggered rhythm sets the stage for Camara's vocals then Sekou comes skirling in with a distant Islamic plaint that seems to hover ghost-like over the whole tune. This is another one you wish would go beyond its 7 minutes. He keeps the sequence together so we get two more gems from the same album. \"Sou,\" with its muted trumpet and smoky sax, is a morna Counsel informs us (the style recently popularized by Cesaria Evora). Here Sekou pushes the notion of \"dry guitar\" to a new height with a brittle plucking style (I think he must have draped his sleeve over the strings).\n\n\"Dya dya\" is on my \"secret Peanut Vendor\" playlist: after collecting about 40 versions of \"El Manicero\" I started hearing it everywhere. There comes a point in every 1-4-5-4 jam where someone will quote either the cry of the peanut vendor (\"Ma-neee!\") or the actual riff (\"Si tu quieres por el pi-co di'-ver-tir\") that is the song's signature. Since \"Mani\" is just two notes I don't include those in the playlist, though I am tempted, but you'll be surprised how many songs use the turn-around (probably unconsciously) when jamming on those chords (G6, C and D7). The album ends with another favourite, \"Petit Sékou,\" which makes me want to urge this album on you! Though I know these songs well, I have been playing this CD non-stop for a month (ignoring all the newer releases). It really gets under your skin!"
