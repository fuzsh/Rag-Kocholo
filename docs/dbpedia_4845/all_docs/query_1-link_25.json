        "text": "The tallest player in Auburn basketball history has transferred to the University of Wyoming.\n\nSeven-foot-2 Boubacar Sylla, who was limited to three games at Auburn last season because of a foot injury, will try his luck with the Cowboys. He'll have to sit out next season because of the NCAA transfer rule.\n\nSylla's transfer opens up another scholarship for the Tigers, who have three to give before next season. Backup Matt Heramb announced he was leaving Auburn last month to attend Kennesaw State.\n\nSylla came to Auburn after limited playing time at Stoneridge Prep in California. He played three early games last year before being sidelined. He leaves Auburn at 7-foot-1, but Wyoming welcomes him at 7-foot-2.*Boubacar had a very difficult first year at Auburn University,\" said Auburn coach Jeff Lebo. \"Along with his season-ending injury, Boubacar had a hard time adjusting to Auburn.\"\n\nWyoming painted a happier picture.\n\n``He not only brings great size but outstanding skills to our team,'' said a very optimistic Heath Schrover, Wyoming's coach, in a press release. ``Not only will Bouba give us another outstanding big man in our program for three seasons, but I believe he will help us immediately in the development of our other young center, Mikhail Linskens. Having two seven footers go at it in practice every day should make both Bouba and Mikhail better players.''"
