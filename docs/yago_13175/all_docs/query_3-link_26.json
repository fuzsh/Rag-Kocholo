        "text": "Lucy (the movie) ‚Äì Nine years after the movie's release, a review The movie industry is another economic branch fully developed in some countries. It is a star nursery for actors, movie directors and screenwriters. Maybe 1% of the universal production of films is of quality. A good movie is sometimes not enough. Some people want and can do extraordinary motion pictures. There is the art of telling the story and letting the watchers the feeling of something that they can reach or discover. There are sometimes \"aha\" moments. It appears that the movie Lucy's message is not understood (from my point of view). Luc Paul Maurice Besson's \"Lucy\" relies on the \"10% of the brain\" myth, a drug story, pursuits and visual effects in the American style, to offer us philosophy in pill form. It looks like the title comes from AL 333, the first Australopithecus afarensis found. All the criticism I read about revolves around the cast and his Hollywood style. Others see conspiracy theories hidden in names, actions or statements. An open critique becomes the \"10% of the brain\" myth. The drug story and the special effects downplayed the critique of our society and our lifestyle. What I've been missing in the last decades is the constructive criticism. \"Dubito ergo cogito, cogito ergo sum\" [R. Descartes]. You can read the full article on https://lnkd.in/dJ5XwzSa\n\nAfter finishing two of my latest films, ‚ÄúThe Invisible Partner‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Prejudice‚Äù, now I realize the impact of the essays of Carl Jung upon me. Though I have read very little of his voluminous work. There, the concept of Anima and Animus and their projection, I found very interesting and finally those things reflected in my two of the aforesaid films. Jung called the opposites in man and woman the anima and the animus respectively. By the anima he meant the feminine component in a man‚Äôs personality, and by the animus he designated the masculine component in a woman‚Äôs personality. The anima can also be defined as an image or as the resultant of all the experiences of man with woman. This is the reason the anima image is projected on the woman. And for the same reason the animus image is projected on the man. Perhaps the best way to understand the nature of Anima/Animus projection is through the experience of ‚Äúfalling in love.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Invisible Partner‚Äù is a found footage film made out of some shots of legendary filmmaker Alfred Hitchcock‚Äôs film ‚ÄúNotorious‚Äù. Whereas, ‚ÄúThe Invisible Partner‚Äù, another found footage film of mine, is made out of mainly some bollywood film footage. #AvantGarde #ExperimentalFilm #ExperimentalShortFilm #ExperimentalFilmEditor #VideoArtEditor #VideoArt #ShortFilm #IndependentFilm #FilmEditor #SoundDesign #SoundEdit\n\nAfter finishing two of my latest films, ‚ÄúThe Invisible Partner‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Prejudice‚Äù, now I realize the impact of the essays of Carl Jung upon me.

One may ask, What revelations awaited me on reaching this number? What lessons have I learned by far? I don‚Äôt intend to disappoint anyone, but now it‚Äôs time to come clean. I don‚Äôt remember watching half of those movies. Often happens that I see a name and go like, Wow, a new movie! And then I watch it. And I like it. Then I take my special notebook to mark my opinion of it there, and ‚Ä¶ BAM. I see its name already written in it. This happened recently with ‚ÄòSabrina‚Äô (1995). üí° Revelations made: I have the memory of a goldfish. üç´ Lessons learned: Have to eat dark chocolate. Or not. Because the most wonderful thing about forgetting is the following: As with books (which also applies to me), even if you forget the name of the movie, its plot, the names of the main characters, the ending ‚Ä¶ Okay, this last one is unforgivable. Even if you‚Äôre a goldfish in the sea of cinematography, watching a movie you forgot existed is the same as reliving a life you never owned. There‚Äôs a saying that goes: A reader lives a thousand lives.* The same applies to movies, doesn‚Äôt it? P.S. Worse with series. Imagine spending hundreds of hours‚Äî‚ÄòHouse, M.D.‚Äô was worth every second‚Äîto then find yourself re-watching episode by episode with the eyes full of surprise: Have I seen this moment? And this? And THIS? The second time I watched ‚ÄòChilling Adventures of Sabrina‚Äô my brain was constantly producing these questions. P.S.S. For those who read till the end: please share movies that left you pondering after watching them or advice on how to become less of a goldfish. Better both ‚Ä¶ üëÄ * It‚Äôs actually a quote: A reader lives a thousand lives before he dies. The man who never reads lives only one. ‚Äî George R.R. Martin\n\nQ and A Part II 4. What do you hope readers will take away from this book? A. That he was a key figure in Hollywood history. That he made his mark throughout the silent film era and deserves to be remembered. That he had his share of triumphs and tragedies that make for a good story. All of Hollywood history starts with Christie, and it‚Äôs time he had the spotlight for everything he accomplished. 5. He did receive some recognition along the way, right? A. Yes, even critics who didn‚Äôt like his work would note that the audiences were laughing, and that Christie seemed to know what the public liked. The Christie studio, which Al and his brother Charles ran for more than 15 years, was the first permanent one in Hollywood. Both Al and Charles have stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, so at some point they were recognized for the pioneering roles they played in establishing the movie business. Interestingly enough, Al doesn‚Äôt have a star on the Canadian equivalent of the Walk of Fame in Toronto, and there‚Äôs nothing in his hometown of London, Ontario that acknowledges his accomplishments. Maybe this book will help change that. 6. Who is the target audience for this book? A. The main audience is obviously silent film buffs, but I also think it appeals to anyone with an interest in the history of Hollywood and American films. I also think Canadian readers will want to know more about him because he‚Äôs been overlooked in this country too. Christie was there at the beginning of movie making. He helped establish Hollywood as the film capital of the world. Everyone who has come to Hollywood over the decades seeking fame and fortune is doing what Al did more than 100 years ago. He was the first. 7. So why do you call him ‚Äúforgotten‚Äù? A. He‚Äôs not completely forgotten, obviously, but he has been long overlooked. When I first started researching him, I read general books about the history of silent film. In many cases, he wasn‚Äôt even mentioned and when he was, it was a few sentences or so. That‚Äôs changed in recent years and fans have started to see more of his films and appreciate his work. His movies have been shown at recent film fests, and the Silent Film Museum in Niles, California did a great retrospective of his work one weekend in 2021. Many of Christie‚Äôs films didn‚Äôt survive over the decades, and ones shown in the early days of TV were often badly edited. As fellow author Steve Massa told me, ‚Äúit‚Äôs sort of like he‚Äôs hiding in plain sight.‚Äù Massa also thinks that Christie worked with a lot of good actors and actresses over the years. ‚ÄúAnd he was a really good director. He‚Äôs kind of ahead of his time with his situational comedies.‚Äù"
