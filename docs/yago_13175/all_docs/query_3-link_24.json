        "text": "Job: co-chairmen, Working Title Films\n\nAge: 50, 48\n\nIndustry: film-making\n\nNew entry\n\nFour Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill, Bridget Jones's Diary, Shaun of the Dead, Pride & Prejudice and Atonement - Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner have been responsible for some of the biggest British films of the last two decades.\n\nBacked by Hollywood studio Universal, Working Title Films has grossed an estimated £2bn at the worldwide box office and even more in TV and DVD sales.\n\nThe pair have also expanded into theatreland and struck gold at their first attempt with Billy Elliot: the Musical. Now they are looking at a move into television.\n\n\"They consistently produce big box office hits and continue to do so,\" said our panel. \"They have a bigger development production fund than the whole of the UK Film Council.\n\n\"If an independent producer wants to get a film off the ground then Bevan and Fellner can make it happen on a big scale. They are world players but have a big impact in the UK. Can they get a project off the ground just by picking up the phone? Yes.\"\n\nBevan and Sarah Radclyffe founded Working Title in 1984, and Fellner came on board when Polygram - now part of Universal - took over in 1992.\n\nThe pair make five films a year, with current projects including the big screen adaptation of acclaimed BBC1 drama State of Play. When Brad Pitt pulled out, Fellner bagged Russell Crowe instead.\n\nDescribed as acting like siblings or an old married couple, they have a habit of finishing off each other's sentences. Bevan is the livelier of the two, Fellner more softly spoken.\n\n\"We want to use the Working Title brand for television and make use of the talent we have used on our films,\" Bevan told the Times.\n\nThe pair also produced Paul Greengrass's United 93 and the upcoming adaptation of Peter Morgan's acclaimed stage play, Frost/Nixon.\n\nAtonement, which won best film at the Baftas and best drama at the Golden Globes, is one of around 80 films that Working Title has made since its debut, My Beautiful Laundrette, in 1985.\n\nUniversal signed a new deal with the company last year, committing an estimated $1bn to its films over seven years. Bevan and Fellner were placed at 75 in Vanity Fair's top 100 of the world's most influential people last year.\n\n· To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediaguardian.co.uk or phone 020 7239 9857.
