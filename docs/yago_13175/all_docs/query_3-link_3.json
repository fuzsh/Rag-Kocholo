        "text": "British actress, film director and writer\n\nGaby Dellal (born 1961) is a British actress, film director and writer. She was born in London.\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2015, Dellal directed 3 Generations, a movie about a transgender teen boy played by Elle Fanning whose decision to start hormone therapy causes conflict with his mother, played by Naomi Watts and grandmother, played by Susan Sarandon. Dellal came under controversy for an interview she gave before the film's release during which she referred to the character Ray, played by Fanning, using female pronouns and referring to the character as \"a girl who is presenting in a very ineffectual way as a boy.\"[1] Dellal later stated that she used female pronouns because she was referring to the actress Fanning, not the character, when she made the remark.[2] The film was distributed by The Weinstein Company in May 2017.\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nDellal was previously married to producer Eric Fellner, with whom she has three sons.[3]\n\nSelected filmography\n\n[edit]\n\nDirector\n\n[edit]\n\nOn a Clear Day (2005)\n\nAngels Crest (2011)\n\nLeaving (2012)\n\n3 Generations (2015)\n\nWriter\n\n[edit]\n\nTube Tales (1999)\n\n3 Generations (2015)\n\nActress\n\n[edit]\n\nDempsey and Makepeace (1985)\n\nZina (1985)\n\nRobin Hood (1986)\n\n'Allo 'Allo!
