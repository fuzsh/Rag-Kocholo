        "text": "A roar went up in the Savoy on Sunday when Eric Fellner and Tim Bevan stepped up at the Evening Standard British Film Awards to receive the Alexander Walker Award, named in honour of our late critic. These two smooth men of middling age, co-chairmen of the production company Working Title, have done more than anyone over two decades to advance British film.\n\nWhen LA wakes up he and Bevan will turn their attention to another pending project: The Interpreter, a $60 million US thriller starring Nicole Kidman, an emblem of Fellner and Bevan's belief that the British industry can only survive if it learns to work like, and with, Hollywood.\n\n\"An award like this is an enormous honour, but also a bit scary,\" says Fellner, 45. \"If you start believing in your press, or rest on your laurels in this business, you are dead. So I think I'm going to see it as a wake-up call, to keep the pressure on and continue working as aggressively and as well as we possibly can.\"\n\nBevan, 46, echoes his determination. \"We keep our heads down, we work hard and we churn out movies,\" he says. \"It's only when you see them all up there [on a showreel at the ceremony] that you realise there are quite a few of them, and quite a few of them are quite good.\"\n\nThis is no mere boast. Between them Fellner and Bevan have been responsible for 77 movies, some of the most lucrative and acclaimed of the past 20 years, from Billy Elliot to Love Actually to the Coen Brothers' Fargo.\n\nThey made Four Weddings and a Funeral for $5 million and grossed $250 million. They furnished Cate Blanchett and Susan Sarandon with Oscar-winning roles in Elizabeth and Dead Man Walking. They made the gormless Bean and the cult US hit Thirteen. They open four or five films a year, and have 50 in development.\n\nLast year was, admittedly, mixed. \"Thunderbirds and Wimbledon didn't do as well as we hoped,\" says Bevan, \"but if you go out to bat as often as we do you expect that.\"\n\nWorking Title still pulled in around $600 million in 2004, once the takings for Love Actually, Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason, and the mock-horror sleeper hit Shaun of the Dead were factored in. This helped push the company's's total box office through the $3 billion barrier. \"If I could do $600 million every 14 months, I'd be very happy,\" says Fellner.\n\nIt is no accident that the two of them talk dollars, not sterling. Working Title is backed by a unique deal with the US studio Universal, giving access to a distribution network and enabling them to green-light their own films. And although Fellner insists that all their British films are assessed on their likely domestic performance, the Richard Curtis and Bridget Jones movies seem designed to sell abroad, in comparison to, say, Mike Leigh's independently-produced Vera Drake.\n\n\"Mike Leigh and Ken Loach are the people I look up to,\" says Fellner. \"They are quality film-makers making interesting, controversial, ground-breaking movies with very little eye on the marketplace. But that doesn't mean I think their films are\n\nHe has no time for the regular, interchangeable media stories about the death or resurrection of the British film industry. \"It's a cyclical business,\" he says. \"If there's a British film in the marketplace that is successful on a worldwide basis - whether it's A Room with a View, Four Weddings or The Full Monty - money follows and everyone tries to emulate that success.\n\n\"Outward investment into the UK also depends on whether the dollar is weak or strong. But in my view, over a 20-year period, it really hasn't changed at all. There's money available now, it's just different to the money available then. Then it was TV money, now it's tax money. And slowly but surely ambitious film-makers get their films made. If they are good they get to go on to the next stage, which is either Hollywood or bigger budget films here in the UK.\"\n\nBEVAN and Fellner are unapologetic about taking the Yankee dollar. \"The truth of the Englishlanguage movie business,\" says Bevan, \"is that its heart - the pumping heart, if not the emotional heart - is in Hollywood. That's where the distribution, the finance and the talent is. You have to stay on top of that. If you are going to be a serious film player, you can't do it sitting on Oxford Street.\"\n\nTheir story is one of Thatcher-era entrepreneurialism. Fellner was born in Surrey, the son of a businessman, Bevan in New Zealand, the son of a doctor. Both were public schoolboys who passed on university in favour of jobs in the runaway 1980s video industry, initially as runners, then as producers of pop promos.\n\nBevan, bored of chasing funding, went looking in 1992 for a corporate backer and found Michael Kuhn at the Dutch entertainment conglomerate Polygram. \"Sarah didn't want to go down that route, so she left,\" says Bevan. \"I didn't want to work alone, and I had been aware of Eric as someone with parallel experience, a guy I'd like to work with. He'd just sold his company, so Michael and I got him in a pincer movement.\"\n\nPolygram's backing absolved them from the financing problems that killed UK producers such as Goldcrest. They took on a broad slate of movies, some cheap and British, some expensive and American, spreading the risk. \"Initially, Eric brought more charm to the partnership and I brought more charge,\" says Bevan, \"but as in a marriage, that's evened out.\"\n\nBevan was married to actress Joely Richardson (they have a daughter); Fellner has three sons with Gaby Dellal, but both marriages ended around 1998. Fellner overcame heroin addiction in 1990; he has a new son, three weeks old, with supermodel Laura Bailey. Bevan is now with Amy Gadney.\n\nFellner is now excited about their first foray into theatre with Billy Elliot, and about Pride and Prejudice, which he says \"will prove that [Keira Knightley] is not just a movie star but a great actress\".\n\nWhen I broach the issue of how much they make on their films, Bevan says they earn about the same as an in-house producer on the Universal lot. \"We do all right, but I'm not in it for that,\" he adds. \"I make films because I love working with creative people. I love making movies, and every now and again we get to make one that's really good.\"\n\nBut has success made it easier for them to get films made? Fellner shakes his head. \"The only thing that has changed for me in 20 years,\" he says, \"is that I now get my calls returned. It might sound a small thing, but if you want to get Tom Cruise into your movie, without a track record or without those agents knowing you, it's almost impossible. Now I can get through to pretty much anyone I want. Of course,\" he smiles, \"90 per cent of the time they still say no.\""
