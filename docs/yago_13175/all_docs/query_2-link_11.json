STYLED BY SOPHIE GOODWIN \\ ■ «V< * / N V on HERE’S LOOKING AT... SANDY POWELL As one of the worlds most successful costume designers for film (you can’t argue with three Oscars and 44 award nominations), Sandy Powell is used to the odd corset-related scandal. Like the time she had to wrestle Leonardo DiCaprio into a rubber one on the set of The Aviator. ‘It made him remember to stand up straight.’ Or the hoo-ha that ensued over Lily James’s teeny-tiny waist in her ballgown for Cinderella, on which Sandy and her team spent 500 hours. ‘Everyone went nuts about it, but she just has a small waist.’ Sandy, 55, started designing young, making clothes for her dolls when she was growing up in Brixton, where she still lives; her first piece was a pair of hotpants. She studied performance design at Saint Martins but left halfway through when she got a job making costumes for dancer Lindsay Kemp’s company, swiftly followed by Derek Jarman’s film Caravaggio. Since then, she’s created some of Hollywood’s most memorable looks, from Judi Dench’s Elizabeth I costume in Shakespeare in Love to Daniel Day-Lewis’s top hat in Martin Scorsese’s Gangs of New York. Her next project is Carol, an adaptation of a Patricia Highsmith novel about a lesbian love affair in the Fifties, starring Cate Blanchett - one of Sandy’s favourite people to dress; ‘It’s so nice to work with somebody with brains as well as beauty.’ Just don’t try to force Sandy into one of her costumes; she’s not a fan of dressing up. ‘I live in fear of being invited to a fancy-dress party. I’d rather stick to my vintage Gaultier.’ LB TATLER DECEMBER 2015 69 I-'-* A;. RIHANNA IN GIAMBATTISTA VALLI HAUTE COUTURE ERIN O’CONNOR IN RALPH & RUSSO HAUTE COUTURE HAUTE COUTURE PALOMA FAITH IN ARMANI PRIVE Fashion What’s the point of a ballgown unless it’s pouffy? There is no point. Not really. Because an evening dress becomes one only with an element of fantasy. That, and a distinct lack of versatility. It will have to earn its keep in one star-spangled night because it must be so memorable that you can’t wear it again for 20 years. A real ballgown puts you on a pedestal, turns you into an untouchable fairytale creature. You don’t sizzle in it. It should repel the cheap pass and activate the marriage proposal. And for a modern mood, go all out on the frock and utterly minimal on jewellery, hair and make-up. It’s fanciful dress. Not fancy dress. It’s world domination. Not Miss World. It’s the stuff that dreams are made of. How do you know when you’re in a truly ballsy gown? When you have to walk sideways through the door, that’s how. AR MM DON’T YOU WISH YOU’D WORN THAT?

Not shine or shimmer or sparkle. Gleam. Like the precious, polished piece of perfection that you are. Because silk and satin are precious. They hark back to a time before neoprene, lycra and laser-cutting; to a time when we dressed for dinner and didn’t publicly put out. Because you don’t end up in a slippery, silken number by accident. It doesn’t just happen. You make the choice to be slinky, to be noticed and, in this instance, to be now.

But this particular card must be played carefully. Artfully. What do your legs say? Do they require a full trouser? A maxi? A micro? A knee-length? A beautiful flat can work with all of these moods. Perfectly. But not a ballet shoe, people. And not just leather. Why be sloppy when you can be opulent and feline and playful and rich? And you know why you’ll be the sexiest bird in the room? Because you’ll be the most comfortable bird in the room. Let the others totter while you conquer.

If he mimics you, he likes you. ARKADIY ABRAMOVICH 20s MARQUESS OF BLANDFORD 20s WILE BOWFBY 20s Will’s the cute chap knocking out samphire pakoras at Pop Brixton’s Indian restaurant, Kricket. (FYI, he can spell.) He’s busy behind the stove and has two protective big sisters, so your best chance is to pop him on your food order - for pudding. n MARQUESS OF B0WM0NT AND CESSFORD 30s The Duke of Roxburghe’s heir is a dapper dresser and will take you for a spin in one of his fast cars if you ask nicely. But he might love his black Labrador more than you. NICK VON CHRISTIERSON 30s Nick created the BabyBundle app, which monitors all things baby. Sadly, that is the only coochie-coo thing about him, as proved by his ‘Drags and Dungeons’ - themed 30th, where he looked fetching in fishnet tights. He once gallantly sent a girl a whole heap of locusts. WILLIAM R0PER-CURZ0N 30s Students of his painting courses at Arniano pay just for his company and witty banter. He’s highly sought after at weekends in Rome, California and Scotland; LORD DOWNPATRICK 20s Edward always travels with black tie. It’s not that this investment banker is stuffy - it’s just the way he was brought up. His father, the Earl of St Andrews, does the same, as did his grandpa, the Duke of Kent. A word of warning - he prefers clothes not to be too loud and ostentatious, as he doesn’t like to be distracted from looking at your face. IDRIS ELBA 40s Those James Bond rumours just won’t quit, but we’d have him either way. He acts, he DJs, and this year he also broke a UK land-speed record driving a Bentley along a Welsh beach. Phwoarrrrr. OSCAR BURNETT 20s Adrenalin may appear to be the future Duke of Norfolk’s fuel - Henry is an F3 driver, avid skier and mountain climber - but it’s actually Roger Federer’s mental agility that this economics graduate and tennis nut admires most. Go for a five-setter with him. ARTHUR DE BORMAN 30s Hip, bearded east London production designer who has worked with the likes of Guinness, Nike and Preen. His CV may sound edgy, but he’s got a soft spot: he loves Fat Cat, his furry friend. National Portrait Gallery exhibitor who isn’t half niffy on the guitar. The poor chap’s a bit sad over the imminent closure of the Troubadour in Earls Court. Make him smile. HENRY CAVILL 30s SUPERMAN. Terrific eyebrows and a self-made millionaire by the time he was in his late 20s, thanks to a retail chain he overhauled with his two brothers. What’s not to love? - EARL OF ARUNDEL 20s His name derives from the Greek for ‘bear’ and Roman’s son is already a big beast in the City with his own company, ARA Capital. Just as fierce when it comes to Chelsea FC - he’s often seen pumping his fists on the edge of the pitch. Madly handsome Old Harrovian who is damn good with a polo stick, studying at UCL and v. v. loyal (to Sunderland AFC). Hands off! ARCHIE FAULKS 20s This Old Pauline singer-songwriter goes by the stage name Tenterhook and almost drove his uncle Sebastian mad by singing endless Abba songs to him when little. He loves rollerblading and ice cream. MAX FRASER 30s He’s a hedgefunder who has a thing for reggae and, in his own words, ‘I cook, I clean, I can play the fool, and I’m also out a lot.’ You can persuade him to stay in. I> 96 TATLER DECEMBER 2015 PHOTOGRAPHS: DAVE DYER, GETTY IMAGES, DAN BURN-FORTI, DOMINIC O'NEILL, REX FEATURES, CORBIS Discover jandmdavidson.com J&M D avidson Mount Street, London TATLER’S LITTLE BLACK BOOK NICK GRIMSHAW 30s Oh Grimmy, our nation’s morning glory, or Saturday- night treat - and a big fan of a tuna toastie. Scrummy. him — his Shepherd’s Bush pad is a 24-hour party mansion. RORY GUINNESS 30s Tall, dark, handsome... this groovy Jesus lookalike could perhaps seem intimidating. Happily, he’s not - he once had to shout for help from customers in the OKA shop over the road after getting trapped in his steam room. Things to note: he doesn’t like dolphins and drives a Subaru. Still hot, though. BOYS CHARLIE HANBURY 20s The polo-playing four-goaler and Cartier Queen’s Cup winner isn’t averse to stripping off - it’s his party trick. Ply him with a Skinny Bitch so he’ll show you his impressive guns. 1 DAVID JACKSON 20s First, an Oxford physics scholar, then a captain of the Queen’s Royal Hussars and now a boy-about- town. He likes fancy dress and bad jokes, and spends a lot of time chez his sister, Viscountess Glenapp. Take him off her hands. JOHNNIE KERR 20s Wit, charm, manners - he’s got ’em all. Not to mention an impeccable lineage: his uncle is the Marquess of Lothian and one day he’ll inherit Melbourne Hall, an exquisite Derbyshire stately. Loves highbrow chat and late-night red wine. [> CONRAD GAMBLE 30s A quirky poet with an equally quirky eye - his left one resembles a cat’s (due to a leaked retina, apparently). Likes late nights and early mornings. Not necessarily combined. EARL OF GLAMORGAN 20s Bobby has an impressive brain — the Bristol economics graduate and future Duke of Beaufort (he’s second in line) works for Crispin Odey - and was briefly a tennis coach. Also looks good dressed as a penguin. EARL GR0SVEN0R 20s Hugh has a thing for neon, loves dancing, and has three sisters to keep him in check. Oh, and he’s also known as the (incredibly private) Prince of London — as the only son of the Duke of Westminster, he is set to inherit much of the City, and a fair slice of Cheshire too. i. JACK GUINNESS 30s This guy understands feelings. He still cries at Titanic and sometimes, late at night, wonders why there couldn’t have been more rescue boats. He also shares his spaghetti with his chihuahua, Snowy (see back page of this issue). MALACHY GUINNESS 20s A series of accidents have left this dashing tutor hobbling in an elaborate metal brace (temporarily). Not that that stops PRINCE HARRY 30s OK, so he’s a prince, but he’s also just a boy who happens to like blondes, brunettes and Bunga Bunga (the bar, that is). Also into magic tricks. FRANK HESKETH 20s He may have pierced his eyebrow, but fortunately it didn’t puncture his brain - he got a First in philosophy from Manchester University this year. ED H0LCR0FT 20s Hugh Grant-handsome, singled out for stardom by Harvey Weinstein and loved by blondes, this Old Amplefordian actor is one to ogle. Also plays seductive piano.

I TATLER’S LITTLE BLACK BOOK ARTHUR LANDON 30s Hampshire’s hottest filmmaker is also super-buff- he loves boxing. In all other ways he’s a big softie and has been known to leave Nurofen and water by girls’ beds, like a hangover tooth fairy. EDLEY NAYLOR-LEYLAND 20s Good luck pinning down the third of the four Naylor-Leyland brothers — he’s a travel junkie. When in England, catch him at Milton or Nantclwyd Hall, his family homes, or boning up on geo- engineering at UCL. ARTHUR McCALMONT 30s Something of a property pimp and the most wanted holiday companion in town, Arthur is a strong swimmer who likes to warm up with forward lunges before he dives in. And he’s not averse to the other sort of lunge - if you initiate it, he’s bound to reciprocate. It’s only polite. EARL OF MEDINA 20s Not to be confused with his stepbrother Harry Wentworth- Stanley (see next page), though they are both devilishly handsome. This Harry, however, can fly - not literally - but he does have his pilot’s licence. Ask him to play co-pilot? GARRETT MOORE 30s Loulou’s would be nothing without Garrett, Robin Birley’s irrepressible ‘cool consultant’. He loves fancy dress and giving dinners, and is everyone’s favourite immersive-event planner, gadding from Venice to Montenegro, to wherever the party is at. A buzzing whirlwind of FUN. Very good with his hands... when he tinkers on the piano. XAN MORGAN 30s After helping with the Tibetan government in exile, Xan now works in pioneering reusable water. He used to be heavily into trance music and once managed to fit nine matchsticks through his pierced ear. SIMON MORRISON 30s Speedy on a motorbike, happy on a ramble and just as content napping, Simon divides his time between Dorset and Latimer Road, and believes in earning your right to a drink through, say, a treacherous bike ride to the pub. VISCOUNT NEWPORT 30s Shooting, stalking... Ibiza? Alex is that kind of guy. It took him a week to recover from Glasto, because he really knows how to have a good time. He’s also an incredibly generous host, because he never likes the fun to end. FRANCOIS O'NEILL 30s Having closed the Brompton Bar and Grill, Lord Rathcavan’s half-Irish, half-French son has bitten into a new project - the Argentinian Casa Cruz restaurant in Notting Hill. He’s most at home in a tweed waistcoat. JACK PILKINGT0N 20s As a psychology student, Jack learnt a lot about people: how to whip them up - not just dancing at Glastonbury, but getting steamy as he toiled at the Soho House Berlin Store Kitchen. Saucy. JAMIE REUBEN 20s This princeling — his father is one half of the property-mogul Reuben Brothers — works in investment, covering all the bases, from senior director at QPR to board member at 5HS. Win him over with cocktails. ANANT SHARMA 20s He plays something of an unpredictable mash when he gets on the decks, yet this OE manages to be a master of the universe when it comes to running his branding agency, Matter of Form. Defining moment? Modelling for Pizza Express. c/ ^ LORD SETTRINGT0N 20s Sure, one day Charlie will inherit his grandfather’s title, the Duke of Richmond. But for now the Oxford student is happy playing with cars - which is no surprise, seeing as his father, the Earl of March and Kinrara, founded the Goodwood Festival of Speed. He’s weirdly obsessed with (toy) monkeys, his crew is called the Monkey Massive and he goes bananas for a bowl of Coco Pops. O IOO TATLER DECEMBER 2015 BOYS PHOTOGRAPHS: DOMINIC O'NEILL, WIREIMAGE, GETTY IMAGES, ALAN DAVIDSON, STUDIOKIX.COM STREET Wl / 020 7493 8381 34-36 BRUTON WIUIAMANDSON.COM TATLER’S LITTLE BLACK BOOK HARRY WENTWORTH-STANLEY 20s Harry’s a chartered surveyor, but don’t let that put you off this six-foot-four stack of polo-playing goodness. He’s blond and fluent in Spanish. Ole! SAM PAGET STEAVENSON 20s Aka the Rum Runner. Sam was behind the alcoholic creations at the recent Hilton-Rothschild extravaganza. He mixes up cocktails for a career and tests out new concoctions in his spare time. Fun. GIRLS a 20s Adwoa had to study geisha girls recently as a part of her acting degree at Brunei, and says she felt man-like in comparison: hah — what pish! Anyone who has seen this Ghanaian/English model dance, be it at carnival, Ibiza or Portobello’s Boom Burger on a Friday night, knows she’s got ladylike moves. Word of warning: Cara D is your competition. The pair have matching half-heart tattoos. FLORRIE ARNOLD 20s Pretty-as-a-peach pop star Florrie has been playing drums since she was seven. Which means strong biceps - you don’t want to find out what she can do with them... or do you? 20s With a hint of a Twilight vampire about him — in the hot way, not the bloodsucking kinda vibe — this financier can be spotted dancing at Wilderness. But mainly you’ll find him prowling London’s ‘Streeeeeeeeeetz’ - and that is indeed what they call him. HUGO TAYLOR 20s He moved on from Made in Chelsea (phew) and now designs hip shades for his brand Taylor Morris. He may only have heard of Burning Man for the first time this year, but couldn’t be lured so far from SW — instead he chose to live it large at Drifters Festival on Osea Island. #BabySteps. STEVIE THOMAS 20s This carnival-loving six-footer owns the Rum Kitchen in both Notting Hill and Soho. He thanked Glastonbury earlier this year for showing him the way and being a ‘pool of inspiration’. HARRIET AGNEW 30s Really, really likes haggis balls, so much so it’s become her nickname. Though some call her Trace - as in Emin - due to her talking out of the side of her mouth. But neither nickname suits her serious side: she is the City correspondent at the Financial Times. And nor do they hint at this Scot’s amazing bod (er, cough, tits). SOFIA BARCLAY 20s Invite her to the theatre, but this Westminster- educated actress may well steal the show with her bouncy hair and zumba-tweaked body. Thankfully, she’s not as retiring as her grandfather and great-uncle, Telegraph owners the Barclay bros. 20s She helped start the Hands Up Foundation, which raises money for Syrian aid. She also makes a mean marmalade — you really should ask to try some for breakfast. JL CRESSIDA B0NAS 20s The best body in London, stupendous hair and utterly charming to boot. No wonder everyone’s after Cressy. Relationships come second to acting at the moment, though. MILLIE BRADY 20s Actress Millie bakes excellent banana bread — it only took her three years to perfect the recipe. A good person to have around should the apocalypse hit: she learnt how to battle the undead in Pride and Prejudice and Zombies. ALEXA CARLSON 20s Hong Kong-born, Notting Hill-based BOYS & GIRLS Alexa works for Burberry, but she’s also a RADA-trained actress. Her biggest break so far? Appearing in Chalet Girl with Felicity Jones and Ed Westwick. Woo her with a bit of Michael Buble. SUSSY CAZALET 30s Sussy, an interior and set designer, is far from beige (as her crazy hair implies) — which helps when you design for 5HS and the Box. Hails from Norfolk and enjoys lusting over art in museums around the world. 9 TESSA CLARFELT 30s Tessa is into puppetry and dance, which is beneficial seeing as she works for festival- throwers Secret Productions. She’s also learning how to be a trapeze artist - so she’s very bendy. t> TATLER • PROMOTION HEY JEWELS The Christie’s Important Jewels sale takes place on 2 December at King Street in London. Come to marvel at the collection, or consign your own pieces with a free valuation from the auction house A GROUP OF RETRO RUBY AND DIAMOND 'LUDO HEXAGONE' JEWELLERY, BY VAN CLEEF & ARPELS, CIRCA 1937, ESTIMATE £40,000-50,000 For more than 240 years Christie’s has been a destination for the buying and selling of fine art, jewellery and antiques. The Important Jewels sale draws an array of fine jewellery from all over the world - like this dazzling Van Cleef & Arpels bracelet and pair of clip brooches from the late 1930s. On 2 December, you can wonder at these ornate treasures or be part of the excitement with a sale or purchase of your own! Christie’s, 8 King Street, St James’s, London Visit christies.com/jewelry or call 020 7389 2172 for more information. TATLER’S LITTLE BLACK BOOK GENEVIEVE GAUNT 20s Win this Cambridge- educated actress’s heart with a jaunt to Budapest - she longs to go there. She’s passionate about the English language and is a dedicated reader - she once tried to read Liar’s Poker by Michael Lewis in the sauna (hot), but then had to put it in the fridge to cool it down. SKYE TRAYLER GRAHAM 30s She’s a big-deal director of photography agency Trayler & Trayler, but Skye still can’t find eggs in the supermarket — which she likes fried and sunny side up (the two sides of her personality). She’s also mad keen on Burning Man and bicycles. CLAUDIA GUINNESS 20s No point beating around the bush: Claudia has it all. Brains, wit, beauty - and a sophisticated sense of humour. Bravely break into a festival with her, or if that sounds too intrepid for you, try to woo her in French with a stroll along Brighton Pier - she’s currently studying it at Sussex University. ELEANOR HARMSWORTH TEENS In her first year at Oxford, Eleanor is fiercely intelligent, a bold and elegant rider and an undiscovered beauty with porcelain skin and waist-length hair. A INDIA JAMES 20s She’s the youngest girl to ever buy a Howard Hodgkin, but then India and her sister Fawn did inherit most of Soho from their grandfather — which is handy, seeing as she likes to breakfast daily at Soho House and grab a nightcap at the Groucho. Oh, and in the daytime run her Soho Revue Gallery. I> GIRLS CARA DELEVINGNE 20s That girl, the one with the eyebrows and the mantra to ‘embrace your weirdness’. Weirdly, she also really embraces the movie Magic Mike. Surprised? PEARL VAN DEN ENDE 30s ‘Play to your strengths,’ they say, and Pearl organises parties with Pearl, Rock and Raven Events for a living and lives to party: ta-dah! Not so good when it comes to sleep. SOPHIE KENNEDY CLARK 20s This Scottish actress was once met at Cologne airport by a man holding a sign reading ‘Nymphomaniac’. Don’t get too excited - Sophie was acting in the Lars von Trier film. She’s a vegetarian who occasionally busts a fake nose ring, but as for being a deviant in the sack? Find out. 1 * *» NATALIE DE CLERMONT 30s By day Natalie works in political-risk analysis, by night she parties. So it’s G&Ts vs government default. But she is happy to talk puppies too. CORA C0RRE TEENS Vivienne Westwood’s model granddaughter is smoking hot and has epic parties at her house near Regent’s Park, where she hangs with her best mate Raf Law. ROSABEL CREAN 20s Aged eight, Rosabel was on the tasting panel for Prestat, her father’s chocolate company. These days, the Newcastle student can often be seen in India or Wiltshire. 104 TATLER DECEMBER 2015 COCO FENNELL 20s Dolly Parton is her muse, Dollywood is her Mecca — this absolute doll works 9 to 5 designing sexy, fun dresses. LILY FORTESCUE 20s If Lily had a favourite letter, it would be P - this workout fanatic is all pout, pert and party (with takeaway pizza on her speed-dial). She also designs pants, under the name Cheek Frills. And loves her pet pooch. VANESSA GARWOOD 30s After studying under Charles Cecil in Florence, the stunningly talented portrait painter set up a studio in Gunter Grove. She loves parties and has a very sexy smile. LAURA FRASER 30s This yogi recently contemplated whether she could be a nun. Luckily, the conclusion was no - instead, she’s retreated to Hampshire to write while she plots her next move. Party on.

STYLED BY AILSA MILLER AboutiJown THE DANCER Looking at Francesca Hayward - a jewellery-box ballerina brought to life - it’s hard to imagine her doing anything unladylike. Until she tells you about the time her nipple popped out onstage. ‘I knew it was out, but I couldn’t do anything,’ she says. ‘I just had to carry on.’ Let’s hope there are no similar mishaps when she plays Clara in The Nutcracker later this year - the role that first made her want to become a dancer. One of her earliest memories is of her grandparents putting her down in front of a video of the ballet. ‘And that was it - 1 was twirling all day, every day. They had to remind me to stop and eat.’ Born in Nairobi to an English father and Kenyan mother, the 23-year-old moved to Sussex to be raised by her grandparents when she was two. Her grandmother ferried her between ballet classes and encouraged her to sign up for the Royal Ballet Lower School in Richmond Park when she was 1 1 . From there, she progressed through the ranks until her recent promotion to first soloist at the Royal Ballet. But as much as she’s looking forward to the fairytale froth of The Nutcracker , Francesca loves meatier roles - like Manon. ‘There’s sex, death, prostitutes — it is BRILLIANT.’ The only downside to all that dancing? Mangled feet. ‘Pedicures can be a bit awkward - 1 don’t have toenails on my two littlest toes, so they just have to paint blobs on and pretend.’ LB Francesca Hayward performs in The Nutcracker at the Royal Opera House from December to January (roh.org.uk).

Europe was still emerging from a post-war hangover when, in 1951, the reclusive Mexican mining heir threw a huge costume ball in Venice, at the Palazzo Labia, which he had bought three years earlier and spent a fortune restoring. Getting to Venice back then wasn’t easy - it took days by train and boat. But he pluckily invited all the most glamorous people of the age, from the Aga Khan to Salvador Dali, knowing they would turn up. They did. The invitations were sent six months in advance, to give people time to have their costumes made - Pierre Cardin and Nina Ricci practically launched their careers that night. Guests arrived by gondola on the Grand Canal and Beistegui, nicknamed the ‘Count of Monte Cristo’, received them at the top of the stairs, his tiny frame barely recognisable, propped up on two-foot platform heels beneath a sausage-curl wig that tumbled down his crimson gown. Lady Diana Cooper came as Cleopatra; the couturier Jacques Lath was the Sun King; and Arturo Lopez-Wilshaw, another noted party-giver, came as the Emperor of China, emerging with his wife from a Chinese junk. Cecil Beaton photographed the whole affair, which was talked about for years afterwards. It was the most important night of Beistegui’s life. He suffered a series of strokes 10 years later, sold the palazzo, which became an office block, and died in 1970. A ball is the ultimate party - the grandest, most decadent, most extravagant knees-up there is. A thick cream invitation to a ball conjures up thoughts of fairytales and waltzing through the night, of sumptuous costumes, gold-leaf ballrooms, bacchanalian levels of alcohol and silver platters of food when you need a little breather. You might attend a ball and meet your prince, or a prince at the very least. It will be a night to remember, as opposed to just another night getting pissed at a wedding in a freezing marquee in Devon. And, hooray, balls are back. These days everything can (or should) be a ball.

For the wedding itself, an entire village of Lebanese musicians was flown in the following day, and a human-sized cake was served before the guests moved to the ‘nightclub tent’. Poppy Delevingne’s Jo Malone Blossom Ball, held in April, took over a townhouse in Marylebone, and guests drifted about in couture while eating baked potatoes topped with caviar. And in September, 1 ,000 people descended on Park Lane for the Boodles Boxing Ball, where Pippa Middleton drank champagne and joined in the ringside roaring as 12 plucky fighters boxed one another. The timeframe is one of the defining features of a ball. It begins late, usually about 1 0pm, and goes on until the small hours. Dinner might be served beforehand, but only for the household; most people dine at neighbouring houses if it’s in the country, or at restaurants if in town. They can be given in hotels, if you don’t have a ballroom of your own, though time was when all the grandest houses in London did. Unless it’s fancy dress, the dress code is simple - white tie for men, gowns for women. ‘Novelty outfits should be avoided at all costs. They’re funny for five minutes, then you look like a prat for the rest of the evening,’ says Nicky Haslam, who has been balling for decades. At the ball thrown by the Queen for the Prince of Wales and Diana’s wedding in 1981, Nicky recalls that sausages and baked beans were served and - after dancing several whirls with a Spanish princess - he left with Prince Andrew’s hat (several hats had been tossed in the air in jubilation). Haslam also points out that, although balls are the perfect excuse to show off your jewels, tiaras should only be worn if specified in the dress code: ‘You can’t just put one on because you think it will look nice.’ One of the richest women of the Twenties, Mrs Ronnie Greville, was also a ruthless power entertainer and, according to Brian Masters’ book Great Hostesses, ‘she would wear the most ostentatious though beautiful diamonds from head to toe, which was not very far as she was so noticeably short, and look like a Christmas tree’. When, on one occasion, she saw a rival power hostess had more rows of pearls on display, she dug deep into her bosom and yanked out another three rows. In 1924, she gave a ball at which the crowd was so dense that the king and queen of Italy had to sit in their car outside while the footmen cleared a way through the guests to the ballroom. One of the earliest and wildest balls took place in Paris in 1393, given by the wife of King Charles VI, to cheer him up after a bout of NOOR FARES AND ALEXANDRE AL KHAWAM AT THEIR PRE-WEDDING BALL, 2015 insanity. He and five dancers dressed as wild woodsmen in costumes of flax and pitch, but things got out of hand when they came too close to a torch and caught fire. Four dancers died - one jumped into a vat of wine to cool down - and the event became known as the Bal des Ardents, the ball of the burning men. In the Renaissance, masked balls became popular in Italy, especially in Venice; noblemen One of the wildest balls took place in Paris to cheer up Charles VI after a bout of insanity loved the opportunity to misbehave under cover of disguise. These were occasions when the normal rules could be inverted, and grandees could let their hair down. The Yew Tree Ball at Versailles was a pivotal moment in the reign of Louis XV - it was here that he met Jeanne-Antoinette Poisson, the future Madame de Pompadour. There had been a vacancy for the king’s mistress since the death of Madame de Chateauroux, and all the ladies of the court were in a state of feverish excitement by the night of 25 February 1745. The party did not begin until 1 1 .30pm, when hundreds of carriages proceeded up to the illuminated palace. Some 15,000 guests assembled in the Hall of Mirrors, waiting for the doors of the king’s apartment to open, which would signal the ball’s official commencement. Finally, they opened, but only the queen came out, flanked by the dauphin and his new wife. Then, eight topiaried yew trees appeared - the king and his courtiers in disguise. One made a beeline for Jeanne; the king had spotted her out hunting. From that moment on, they would never spend a night apart. A few decades later, here in England, the ritual ' \\ began of presenting TATLER DECEMBER 2015 debutantes at court. It was Queen Charlotte, wife of George III, who started it, as a birthday present to herself. The idea was to display 17-year-old aristocratic virgins to eligible bachelors (‘debs’ delights’) under the watchful eye of parents and chaperones. The season would open with Queen Charlotte’s Ball in May, and continue into the autumn: a relentless series of balls by the end of which you hoped to have been married off. At Queen Charlotte’s, a giant white cake was the centrepiece, and the girls curtseyed in its direction as they filed past. The late 19th and early 20th centuries were undoubtedly the heyday of the ball. In 1897, the Duchess of Devonshire gave a fancy-dress ball to mark Queen Victoria’s diamond jubilee; 700 guests dressed as historic figures - including Will Somers, Queen Elizabeth I’s court jester, and Lord Nelson - and the hostess herself ventured even further back in history, looking magnificent as Queen Zenobia of Palmyra. Cecil Beaton seems to have been at many of the greatest balls. At Sidney Herbert’s 21st birthday at Wilton, the seat of the Earls of Pembroke, he turned up wearing full maquillage, which didn’t go down well with the Wiltshire hearties. A rowdy bunch gathered him up and deposited him in the Nadder, much to his humiliation. ‘As anyone who has ever had a glass of water tipped over them will know, it’s the shock of it that’s most upsetting,’ says Hugo Vickers, Beaton’s biographer. ‘Still, Cecil wasn’t deterred, and went straight back to the Double Cube room, where he danced the night away, squelching in his sodden shoes.’ The very grandest families in England had large houses in Mayfair - the biggest were along Park Lane - with ballrooms. Lady Londonderry was one of the greatest hostesses of the time, generating hysteria throughout society every time she gave a ball. ‘The crowd at Londonderry House was the densest I had ever seen at a London party,’ wrote Sir Almeric FitzRoy after one given in 1903 to mark the king’s birthday. ‘One girl fainted in the street and had to be lain out on the pavement, and one or two others collapsed inside the building.’ Londonderry House was eventually sold off and demolished to make way for a Hilton hotel. Nicky Haslam was at the last ball there in 1965. ‘It was fabulous,’ he says. ‘The grand staircase was lined with footmen, Mick Jagger and Min Hogg were dancing in the ballroom. The next morning, wrecking balls reduced the house to dust. This lent the night an air of piquancy of fin de siecle, although that quality is often supplied in retrospect.’ Really, when it comes to balls, it’s a case of the bigger the better - the jewels, the gowns and, of course, the 1 4: ?

And a gigantic ballroom. It was bought by Norwegian shipping king John Fredriksen from fellow shipping magnate Theodore Angelopoulos in 2001, and we like to think his beautiful, blonde twin daughters Kathrine and Cecilie have had their fair share of knees-ups in there. Powis Castle, Powys The ballroom at this 13th-century castle has a spooky secret - it’s the most haunted room in the whole castle. Since it was originally built in 1 776 by the 2nd Earl of Powis for his 21st-birthday celebrations, there have been numerous reports of ghostly piano music floating from the empty room, as well as sightings of the piano stool moving on its own. THE NEW BALL RULES By Annabel Rivkin Don't go to a ball on a Tuesday. Never wear opals to a ball. If you're Ubering it, at least get an exec. Sex in the loo at a ball is to be applauded (unless you are a teenager. Sorry). The bigger the dress, the greater the kudos. Do not drink beer- most un-bally. Welbeck Abbey, Nottinghamshire This underground ballroom lurks beneath Sherwood Forest. It’s vast - 174 feet long - and at one point had 17 chandeliers swinging from its ceiling. It was especially odd of the 5th Duke of Portland to build it in the 1800s, though, because he was a shy, reclusive man who never threw parties. Belvoir Castle, Leicestershire As the home of the spirited Manners sisters, Violet, Eliza and Alice, this ballroom has seen some wild parties over the years. Like the time one shooting weekend when the three girls turned it into an impromptu nightclub, complete with disco ball and lights, and bopped through the night still wearing their tweed. If one boob pops out, great wealth will befall you. If two boobs pop out, beware the Ides of March. No eating at a ball before midnight. You shall go to the ball. Never refuse an invitation (except on a Tuesday. See above). SCOTS DO IT BETTER... By Sophia Money-Coutts T was a fat teenager who hated parties because I always went to them looking like a pork pie in a dress. No boy would dance with me, let alone snog me, so there was an awful lot of hovering on the edge of dancefloors and visiting the loos. Except when, aged 16, I went to the Oban Ball, and I realised that Scottish parties were different, vastly superior and entirely joyful things, for several key reasons 1 Everyone is given a dance card. This lists the order of reels for the night, and it must be filled in with a dinky little pencil that comes with it, so no one is ever left out, sitting forlornly on the sidelines like Mary Bennet. 2 Nobody minds even if you are shaped like a pork pie and thus not so graceful at reeling or aren’t sure of the moves, because Scottish dancing is largely about the taking part. (Even better if you are a girl, because the boys have to lead.) 3 Your dance partner might have deadly breath/ BO/wandering hands, but that’s all right because you’ll get to eye up plenty of other people as you move down a set. 4 It is almost impossible to have any embarrassing vomit moments at a Scottish ball, because you are too busy dancing to drink that much AND you’re sweating all the alcohol off anyway. 5 The snogging pressure’s off, because pulling isn’t the point. Reeling is the point. 6 A proper breakfast is always doled out after lam. Kedgeree, black pudding, eggs, sausages. The lot. Heaven for pork pies. 7 All those ‘true Scotsman’ jokes can get tiresome, but there is something rather wonderful about a man in a kilt.

For this game you need: 1 . One haggis (vegetarian options are available). 2. A good throwing arm. Once upon a time, haggis-hurling was not a sport - it was a necessity. Auld Scottish ladyfolk would make a haggis for their husband’s lunch, but, spatchcocked by the thought of having to cross myriad swamps and brooks, they saved themselves the bother by simply giving a hearty whistle to their other half and chucking the haggis « at him instead. The husband, for his part, was expected to catch the incoming haggis in the front apron of his kilt. I have absolutely no research available as to whether said gentlemen were wearing any undergarments at the time of catching, but let’s just say that this was clearly a win-win arrangement for everyone involved. Haggis-huriing is still a sport at various Highland games, so limber up dear Tatler reader - this one can catapult you to glory. The current record is 217 feet, so no slackers, please. Stand on a platform, lob your haggis with a sense of gay abandon, and that’s it. Now get on with it. PHOTOGRAPH: REX FEATURES. COMPILED BY AILSA MILLER ©thomaslyte THE PRINCE GEORGE DIARIES It’s Christmas at Sandringham and tempers are fraying . . Fortunately, one of the most insightful and observant scribes of our age is on hand to record this key moment in British history. By Clare Bennett 24TH DECEMBER 2014 T oday is a day called Christmas Eve. We spent most of it at Sandringham and because - don’t spread it around - we are a bit German and our German ancestors always opened their presents on Christmas Eve, we do too. After the presents, Great-Aunt Annie asked the dreaded question if anyone wanted to play Racing Demon. It totally changed the mood in the room. GaGa said her back was hurting too much and Goonie said he hadn’t finished his conversation with the mistletoe. Great-Uncle Andy and Great-Uncle Eddie said they wanted to watch Elf, Great-Aunt Soph hid under the table and Cousin Bea and Cousin Euge both just ran out of the room. As Great-Aunt Annie made a beeline for GG and G-Pop, Daddy turned to us. ‘We only have seconds left,’ he said breathily. ‘She’ll be over at any moment - what do we do?’ ‘Quick, George,’ Mummy said. ‘Go and knock over that vase.’ ‘But it was a present from Franklin Roosevelt to Great-Grandpa Bertie,’ Daddy said anxiously. ‘This is an emergency!’ Mummy whispered. ‘I’m thinking of all of us!’ Great-Aunt Annie, who didn’t seem to be getting anywhere with GG and G-Pop, both of whom had suddenly pretended to fall asleep, finally turned her determined gaze upon us. I rushed at the vase, giving it a hearty wallop. It didn’t break. Mummy and Daddy looked at each other with panic-riddled saucer eyes, so Daddy subtly stepped onto its neck and we heard it crack under his foot. Great-Aunt Annie eyed us all suspiciously. ‘Well, you kids - who’s got the cojones to take me on at a round of RD?’ she said sinisterly. ‘George just broke this vase,’ Daddy gulped. ‘Better get someone to, you know, maybe see if it can be fixed.’ He backed away towards the curtains. ‘Kate?’ Mummy frowned. ‘Feeling so sick,’ she whispered. ‘Sorry.’ There was only one man left. Uncle Harry sat paralysed in his chair, a terrible tortured smile on his face. ‘YOU,’ Great-Aunt Annie boomed. ‘Hay, Aunt A,’ Uncle Harry squeaked. The faintest hint of a smile at the deliberately planted horse-related word appeared on Mummy’s face. ‘How about a quick friendly game?’ Uncle Harry looked at us frantically. ‘Ahhh... ahhhh... ahhhh,’ was all he could say. ‘What’s it to be? Yay or nay?’ Uncle Harry shot a glance to Mummy. ‘Neigh?’ he said. He’s wearing a bandage now from where she slammed her fist down instead of the card and Uncle Harry’s hand got in the way. ‘It was an accident,’ Great-Aunt Annie said. ‘But the main thing is, I won.’ 25TH DECEMBER Today is a day called Christmas Day! It’s about a baby called Jesus, who came into this world to be king too. He didn’t get a crocodile when he was born, though. He only got a lamb and some stuff in pots. Poor Jesus. We went to the big house for lunch, but a complicated thing happened when we arrived. It’s all because GG updated the Order of Precedence to accommodate Daddy marrying Mummy. These changes were meant to help, but they haven’t really. There we were in the hall when Daddy said he had to ring Godfather Jamie, so he stepped into the doorway of another room. Just then Cousin Bea and Cousin Euge came downstairs. If Daddy isn’t with her, Mummy has to curtsy to them because they are princesses by blood. If he is, they’re supposed to curtsy to her. Those are the rules. ‘Happy Christmas!’ they shouted. ‘Hashtag jingle-bell vibes!’ They all looked at Daddy, who loitered in the doorway. ‘Is he in the room or not?’ Mummy said. ‘He’s got one foot on either side of the doorway. What do we do? ‘Like, I have no idea,’ said Cousin Euge. ‘Is it us or you?’ Cousin Bea said cheerfully. ‘I’d rather be on the safe side,’ Mummy said politely, starting to curtsy. Just as Daddy temporarily stepped back into the hall. ‘Wait, he’s in the room now!’ Cousin Euge and Cousin Bea shrieked. Mummy quickly stood up again and Cousin Euge and Cousin Bea curtsied instead. It was like they were on a seesaw. Then Great-Uncle Eddie and Great-Aunt Soph came sloping down the stairs too. ‘Hullo,’ they said. ‘Happy Christmas.’ Everyone looked at Daddy. ‘We can’t tell if Wills is, like, in the room or not in the room,’ Cousin Euge said. ‘Awky mo-mo,’ Cousin Bea said. w H o ’ s w H o : Goonie is Charles. GaGa is Camilla (who also calls Charles ‘Fred’) . GG is the Queen. G-Pop is the Duke of Edinburgh. Wombat is William. PHOTOGRAPHS: REX FEATURES, OLDDESIGNSHOPCOM ‘That doesn’t affect me,’ Great- Aunt Soph said tightly, curtsying to absolutely everyone. ‘Oh Lord,’ Uncle Harry whispered to me. ‘This is a better start to the day than I could ever have imagined.’ Then GaGa and Goonie came down the stairs. ‘Ahoy!’ GaGa said. ‘Happy Christmas, lovers!’ Everyone curtsied to them. At least that was straightforward. Then Great-Aunt Annie came down the stairs. ‘Happy Christmas,’ she boomed. ‘Who wants a quickfire game of Snakes and Ladders before lunch?’ Everyone looked at Daddy. Whose feet were now back on either side of the doorway. ‘Isn’t this a scream?’ GaGa said cheerfully. ‘Shall I send Fred away and really shake things up?’ She and Goonie laughed hysterically. ‘Actually, I do need to ask William something,’ Goonie said, heading off towards Daddy. Great-Aunt Annie looked at GaGa. ‘So, this is awkward,’ she said flatly. ‘Down I go!’ GaGa said, bending her knees to curtsy. Uncle Harry was by this time so hysterical that he had to go and stand by one of the Titians until he had calmed down. ‘Thanks for that, Wombat,’ he said later on, getting a £10 note out of his pocket and giving it to Daddy as we were going up the stairs. ‘It worked like a dream. I haven’t laughed that much in ages.’ ‘What the hell?’ Mummy said. ‘You planned that?’ Daddy looked guilty. ‘We just wanted to test if everyone knew the rules,’ Uncle Harry said. Mummy gave him a shove. ‘You are so dead,’ she said. ‘I’ll get you for this. From now on, you need to sleep with one eye open.’ Daddy laughed, so Mummy shoved him too. ‘As for you,’ she said menacingly, you’re sleeping on the sofa for the rest of your life.’ ‘I love you,’ he called after her as she marched past him, deliberately treading on his foot. □ From The Prince George Diaries by Clare Bennett, published by Michael Joseph at £8.99.

But then this highbrow did once teach philosophy at University College London and write a biography of 18th-century chinstroker Edmund Burke. Tall men are often infected by diffidence. Norman was until recently one of life’s murmurers, the voice on the level of a Shakespearean third spear carrier saying ‘rhubarb’. You seldom heard him shout insults at opponents. Then he had a screaming match in the lobby with fellow OE David Cameron. Norman, who is MP for Hereford and South Herefordshire (which he won from the Lib Dems in 201 0), went to public school after a patchy early education at a London state primary, a trendy ‘progressive’ school and a crammer. All those brains were in danger of being wasted. His late mother, a gifted painter who, being a left-winger, didn’t approve of private education, took a laidback approach to discipline. Jesse’s dad, Torquil, was more pragmatic. A toy entrepreneur who devised the Big Yellow Teapot and Polly Pocket, Sir Torquil felt that, having made some loot, he was entitled to blow it on his children’s schooling. Beanpole Jesse was despatched to the Eton hothouse. Around this time, Prime Minister Ted Heath asked the fatal question ‘Who governs Britain?’ - and the country was soon being knackered by Labour and the trade unions. The lad saw that the left might not be as great as his adorable mum thought. He went up to Oxford (with an exhibition to Merton) to read classics. One contemporary was a certain William Hague. Norman worked in the City, did some academic research and set up a charitable project in Eastern Europe as the Berlin Wall teetered. He delivered new Western medical textbooks to doctors in Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia. Seeing the effects of communism up close only confirmed him in his ripening Toryism. He was over 40 by the time he became an MP - late by modern standards. He may have had to do some greasing to younger politicos but, once he was in the Commons, he learned that being a yes-man is no life. He is married to Kate Bingham, a life-sciences egghead whose late dad, Tom, was Master of the Rolls. The Binghams were a hearty lot, devoted to bracing weekends in Wales. Maybe they encouraged the son-in-law to sharpen his flinty side. Norman started as a Cameroon but fell out with the PM over House of Lords reforms. His chances of a ministerial career receded, so he took the select-committees route. On the Treasury Committee, he gave City grandee Lord Grabiner a savaging. It was like seeing a hungry archbishop attack a raw lamb chop. Now Norman is chair of the Culture, Media and Sport Committee. Juicy! And, within weeks of landing the job, he upset runner Paula Radcliffe by arguably linking her name to anti-drugs investigations. Jesse blamed the media, saying journos had behaved like a ‘herd of ungulates’. Cue much rifling through dictionaries. There are punchier vulgarians but he’s no slouch at the man-of-the-people stuff. He was recently found, white-hatted, at the ovens in a Ross-on-Wye bakery, learning how his constituents work and earn. His pin-ups may include Kant, Haydn and Louis Armstrong (Jesse himself is a trumpeter), but he has spoken up for his local football team, Hereford FC. A little more aggro, and who knows what he might achieve? As he parps away on his new tenor sax, channelling Joao Gilberto’s ‘Insensatez’, Jesse Norman may not entirely have given up thoughts of one day bumping his head on the ceiling of Downing Street’s Cabinet Room. Quentin Letts writes for the Daily Mail Illustrated by GERALD SCARFE TATLER DECEMBER 2015 125 About Town Books Zigzagging through the Zeitgeist with zip. By Sebastian Shakespeare NUMBER 11 BY JONATHAN CO (Viking, £16.99) Jonathan Coe has established himself as one of the most entertaining chroniclers of our times. The Rotters Club, What a Carve Up! and The Closed Circle were respectively set in the Seventies, Eighties and Nineties, and he skewered those decades perfectly. His latest novel brings us up to date, careening through the Noughties to now. The narrative takes the form of five stories that revolve around two women, Rachel and Alison, childhood friends whose lives go in different directions after an encounter with the Mad Bird Woman when they’re 10. Rachel graduates from Oxford and becomes a private tutor to the rich and privileged; Alison struggles with both her own sexuality and her indebted ex-minor-pop- star mother’s catastrophic appearance on I’m A Celebrity. . . Coe wonderfully captures their age of innocence and how it’s brought to an end by the Iraq War and reality TV. The subsequent episodes become progressively more madcap, linked by an absorption with conspiracy theories that’s both playful and serious. We follow a man’s obsessive search for a magical film he watched on television as a young boy; an extravagantly mocked police detective investigates the suspicious death of comedians; a Romanian dog-walker has a murky role to play. While the plot does meander, it also allows Coe to indulge his abundant talent for social observation and black comedy. He has an enviable lightness of touch and is brilliant at portraying the lunacy of our time, when bankers need iceberg houses and their neighbours need food banks. He is often satirical, always compassionate. LANDMARK: A HISTORY OF BRITAIN IN 50 BUILDINGS BY ANNA KEAY AND CAROLINE STANFORD (Frances Lincoln, £25) A landmark book for the Landmark Trust. This handsome tome marks the 50th birthday of a charity that has preserved nearly 200 buildings. Hurrah! From medieval cottages to picturesque pavilions and glorious castles, this lavishly illustrated book examines the stories of their inhabitants and the trust’s supremely meticulous restoration work. THE SPEAKER’S WIFE BY QUENTIN LETTS (Constable, £16.99) No, not a biography of Sally Bercow! This brilliant and utterly engrossing debut novel is both a lively political satire and a state- of-the-nation polemic. When a London church shelters a young man being chased by the police for making an explosive anti- Islamic protest, the pillars of the Establishment teeter. The author’s Wodehousian relish of the English language is infectious. THE CLASP BY SLOANE CROSLEY (Hutchinson, £ 12.99 ) Part comedy of manners, part adventure story, this is an inspired first novel from a New York writer hailed by David Sedaris as perfectly, relentlessly funny’. A group of friends reunite at a friend’s wedding and are told about a valuable necklace that disappeared during the Nazi occupation of France. They then embark on a hare-brained journey from Miami to Paris. It’s a blast from start to finish. THE YELLOW DIAMOND BY ANDREW MARTIN (Faber, £14.99) Here’s a sparkling crime novel set in modern-day Mayfair amid vulgar Russian oligarchs and flashy Arabs. When the head of a police unit investigating the super- rich is shot in mysterious circumstances, DI Blake Reynolds investigates. He duly uncovers a jewellery theft, a beautiful woman and more than he bargained for. Hugely enjoyable, beautifully written and cleverly au courant. □ 126 TATLER DECEMBER 2015 PHOTOGRAPHS: PSC Restaurants Holy cow — this is one juicy steak joint. By Jeremy Wayne S o you think you know about steak, huh? Well, think again, bud, because at Smith &Wollensky, the American steakhouse that recently opened just off the Strand, beef just got bigger, thicker and juicier. Originally launched in 1 977 on New Yorks Third Avenue, Smith & Wollensky now has restaurants in eight US cities, but London is its first overseas site. And what a site it is. Located in the art-deco Adelphi Building, the two-floor restaurant has been designed by Martin Brudnizki (where hasn’t, you may ask?). And this has to be Brud’s finest hour: a knock-your-socks-off ground-floor room with a copper- coloured tray ceiling, Beardsley-esque panels and a mile-long bar where a well-drille"
