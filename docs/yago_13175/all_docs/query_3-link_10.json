        "text": "Eric Fellner Film/TV Producer - Born October 10, 1959 in England, UK\n\nMini Bio (1) Eric Fellner was born on October 10, 1959 in England. He is a producer, known for Les Mis√©rables (2012), Atonement (2007) and United 93 (2006).\n\nSpouse (1) Gaby Dellal (? - ?) (divorced) (3 children)\n\nRelationships (1) Laura Bailey 2 children 1. Luc (15 Jan 2005) 2. Lola Fellner (May 2008)\n\nTrivia (10)\n\nedit\n\nWent to Cranleigh School in Surrey, UK from 1972-77\n\nUncle of actress Rosie Fellner\n\nHas a son, Luc (b. 15 Jan 2005), with girlfriend Laura Bailey and three children with ex-wife Gaby Dellal.\n\nAttended Guildhall School of Music and Drama.\n\nCo-chairman of \"Working Title Films\" with friend Tim Bevan.\n\nLaunched \"Working Title 2\" with Tim Bevan in 2000.\n\nHe was awarded the C.B.E. (Commander of the Order of the British Empire) in the 2005 Queen's Birthday Honours List for his services to the film industry.\n\nEx-brother-in-law of Jasmine Dellal.\n\nWith Tim Bevan, ranked #9 in the 2008 Telegraph's list \"the 100 most powerful people in British culture\".\n\nFather, with Laura Bailey, of a daughter, Lola Fellner', born in May, 2008.\n\nPersonal Quotes (2)\n\nedit\n\nWe are trying to up the ante a little bit in terms of the scale and diversity of films we make ... You have to have films that are going to do $200-$400m in box office revenue, and finding them from here [Britain] is difficult.\n\nI guess technically not owning the company means we lost control, but the way the film business works is that it's people-driven rather than structure-driven. Tim and I are by profession film producers, and the business of Working Title is producing films. By dint of that we get to run it how we want. The production company itself will never be a profitable company. The value is not in ownership of the company but in part ownership, as we ultimately have, of the rights of any film made."
