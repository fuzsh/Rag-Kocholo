        "text": "When Tim Bevan accepted his latest prize, at the Moët British Independent Film Awards, his thoughts were elsewhere. He dedicated the best documentary award, for Senna, to his film-making partner, Eric Fellner.\n\n“This is an Eric film, not a Tim film,” Bevan announced to guests at the ceremony, at Old Billingsgate in the City of London. “As many of you know, Eric has not been well and is just recovering from surgery.”\n\nBevan and Fellner, who own Working Title, are Britain’s most successful producers, with films including Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill and Bridget Jones’s Diary among their biggest hits.\n\nFellner, 52, has two children, Luc, seven, and Lola Tiger, three, by his girlfriend, the former Marks & Spencer model Laura Bailey, 39. He also has three older children by his ex-wife, Gaby Dellal.\n\nThe producer, who lives with his family in Notting Hill, has announced to friends and associates that he will be off work “for a few months”."
