        "text": "A Working Title, Instinct Productions and StudioCanal cross-cultural romantic comedy.\n\nHow do you find lasting love in today’s world? For documentary-maker and dating app addict Zoe (Lily James), swiping right has only delivered an endless stream of Mr Wrongs, to her eccentric mother Cath’s (Emma Thompson) dismay. For Zoe’s childhood friend and neighbour Kaz (Shazad Latif), the answer is to follow his parents’ example and opt for an arranged (or “assisted”) marriage to a bright and beautiful bride from Pakistan. As Zoe films his hopeful journey from London to Lahore to marry a stranger, chosen by his parents, she begins to wonder if she might have something to learn from a profoundly different approach to finding love.\n\nDirected by Shekhar Kapur and written by Jemima Khan, What’s Love Got to Do With It? is set between London and Pakistan and stars Lily James, Shazad Latif, Shabana Azmi, Sajal Aly and Emma Thompson. The cast also includes Asim Chaudhry, Jeff Mirza, Mim Shaikh, Iman Boujelouah, Mariam Haque and Sindhu Vee.\n\nIvor Novello Lifetime Achievement Award-winning and Mercury Prize nominated composer, Nitin Sawhney CBE created music for the film, with British-Pakistani record producer, DJ, songwriter, and musician Naughty Boy bringing his production and writing skills to the soundtrack, alongside three-time BRIT Award and Mercury Prize nominee, Joy Crookes. Superstars Kanika Kapoor and Rahat Fateh Ali Khan also feature on the soundtrack, with Rahat appearing in the film itself.\n\nThe film is produced by Jemima Khan and Nicky Kentish Barnes alongside Working Title Films’ Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner, and had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on 10 September 2022. It won Best Comedy at the 2022 Rome Film Festival and was nominated for 9 National Film Awards 2023, of which it won 4: Best Screenplay, Best British Film, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor.\n\n“What’s Love Got to Do with It?” opened in UK cinemas on 24 February 2023 and is now available to stream on Netflix in the UK."
