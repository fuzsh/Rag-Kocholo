Fourth Wing (The Empyrean series)\n\nBy Rebecca Yarros\n\nTwenty-year-old Violet Sorrengail was supposed to enter the Scribe Quadrant, living a quiet life among books and history. Now, the commanding general―also known as her tough-as-talons mother―has ordered Violet to join the hundreds of candidates striving to become the elite of Navarre: dragon riders. But when you’re smaller than everyone else and your body is brittle, death is only a heartbeat away...because dragons don’t bond to “fragile” humans.

The Girl Who Was Taken\n\nby Charlie Donlea\n\nThe night they go missing, high school seniors Nicole Cutty and Megan McDonald are at a beach party in their small town of Emerson Bay, North Carolina. Police launch a massive search, but hope is almost lost—until Megan escapes from a bunker deep in the woods…. A year later, the bestselling account of her ordeal has made Megan a celebrity. It’s a triumphant story, except for one inconvenient detail: Nicole is still missing.\n\n7. The Things We Cannot Say\n\nby Kelly Rimmer\n\nSlipping between Poland in World War II and the frenetic pace of modern life, Kelly Rimmer creates an emotional and finely wrought narrative. The Things We Cannot Say is an unshakable reminder of the devastation when truth is silenced…and how it can take a lifetime to find our voice before we learn to trust it.\n\n8. Good Bad Girl\n\nby Alice Feeney\n\nTwenty years after a baby is stolen from a stroller, a woman is murdered in a care home. The two crimes are somehow linked, and a good bad girl may be the key to discovering the truth. A mystery must be solved with three suspects, two murders, and one victim. Find out what happened to the baby who disappeared, the mother who lost her, and the connections that bind them.\n\n9. The Good Daughter\n\nby Karin Slaughter\n\nTwenty-eight years ago, Charlotte and Samantha Quinn's happy small-town family life was torn apart by a terrifying attack on their family home. It left their mother dead. It left their father devastated. And it left the family fractured beyond repair, consumed by secrets from that terrible night. Packed with twists and turns, brimming with emotion and heart, The Good Daughter is fiction at its most thrilling.\n\n10. The Hunting Party\n\nby Lucy Foley\n\nDuring the languid days of the Christmas break, a group of thirtysomething friends from Oxford meet to welcome in the New Year together, a tradition they began as students ten years ago. For this vacation, they’ve chosen an idyllic and isolated estate in the Scottish Highlands—the perfect place to get away and unwind by themselves. Two days later, on New Year’s Day, one of them is dead…and another of them did it. A gripping whodunit by the author of The Guest List and The Midnight Feast.\n\n11. The Summer Place\n\nby Jennifer Weiner\n\nThe road to a wedding day usually comes with a few bumps, but Ruby's quickly planned ceremony at her mother's beach house runs into obstacles no one foresees. When the wedding day arrives, lovers are revealed as their true selves, misunderstandings take on a life of their own, and secrets come to light. There are confrontations and revelations that will touch each member of the extended family, ensuring that nothing will ever be the same in “this first-rate page-turner” (Publishers Weekly) that will whisk you to the charming beaches of Cape Cod.\n\n12. Commonwealth\n\nby Ann Patchett\n\nA secret kiss at an afternoon party reverberates through the lives of two families that are both torn apart and melded together. Told with equal measures of humor and heartbreak, Commonwealth is a meditation on inspiration, interpretation, and the ownership of stories. It is a brilliant and tender tale of the far-reaching ties of love and responsibility that bind us together.\n\n13. Get a Life, Chloe Brown (The Brown Sisters series – all available on Kindle Unlimited)\n\nby Talia Hibbert\n\nChloe Brown is a chronically ill computer geek with a goal, a plan, and a list. After almost—but not quite—dying, she’s come up with seven directives to help her “Get a Life,” and she’s already completed the first: finally moving out of her glamorous family’s mansion. To complete the next items on her list, Chloe needs a teacher, and she knows just the man for the job: a handyman with tattoos, a motorcycle, and more sex appeal than ten-thousand Hollywood heartthrobs.\n\n14. The Innocent (Will Robie series – all available on Kindle Unlimited)\n\nby David Baldacci\n\nIt begins with a hit gone wrong. Robie is dispatched to eliminate a target unusually close to home in Washington, D.C. But something about this mission doesn't seem right to Robie, and he does the unthinkable.
