        "text": "In the present scenario where, English Literature stands as a pivotal area of research and development, offbeat genres have taken a step ahead as areas of interest among scholars. Detective fiction which came into the literary scene in the second half of the Victorian Age, found its first prominent clues in the novels of Wilkie Collins. Though the chronology of detective fiction is short, it bloomed in the early years of the twentieth century through the works of great writers such as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle; who gave the world the most fascinating fictional detective figure i.e. Sherlock Holmes. The expanse of the genre, then, became inclusive of scientific understanding and techniques. As interdisciplinarity swept in detective fiction, kaleidoscopic views and analysis were generated regarding the works of detection. The genre became more prominent with writers like Agatha Christie and later J.K Rowling, Joe Pickett, etc. Detective fiction continues to flourish as a genre in the twentieth first century and is also welcomed in the form of adaptations on the digital screen and television. The paper aims to highlight the origin of Detective fiction and the journey of its development to one of the most eminent genres in the present time. The paper briefly throws light on oeuvre of Wilkie Collins and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle who were the pioneers in the progress of the genre. The paper seeks to establish the significance and relevance of detective fiction and the various factors that led to its rise in the field of English Literature.According to Charles J. Rzepka: A Mystery detective story usually contains a detective of some kind, an unsolved mystery (not always technically crime), and an investigation by which the mystery is eventually solved, there is another component, however, that may be present in varying degrees, or may not be present at all. This is the so-called ‗puzzle element': the presentation of the mystery as an ongoing problem for the reader to solve, and its power to engage the reader's own reasoning abilities. The first elements of detective fiction-detective, mystery, investigation-make a conjoint appearance quite early in the history of the genre. However, the fourth, the ‗puzzle element', is conspicuous by its absence during most of this period. (Rzepka,p. 10) In his book Detective Fiction : Cultural history of Literature, Charles J. Rzepka defines four major components which contribute in building up a detective story-the first being the self-proclaimed detective who carries out the investigation throughout the plot; the second constituent i.e. an ‗unsolved mystery' or a baffling problem which governs the storyline and the behaviors of the characters. This problem should not necessarily be a crime. Lastly, an investigation should take place with the motive to solve the mystery or the problem. Rzepka adds that in later works of detective fiction a fourth element also emerged to prominence in detective story i.e. the ‗Puzzle element'. This ‗Puzzle element' introduced in modern detective fiction, added to the thrill and intensity in the work by involving and engaging the reader's reason and logic to figure out the solution to the ongoing problem. Giving the reader access to information important for solving mystery is considered significant by many critics in today's time for the stories of detection. These elements are quite consistent in the detective story. The detectives in question can be officials, privates, professionals, or amateurs. The problem may not always be a mystery but rather a difficulty that needs to be overcome-for example arrest and escape of someone, theft of something and retrieval, etc.These detective suspense tales had a history that dated back to several centuries before. Despite the fact that the most significant works of detective fiction were written in the nineteenth and twentieth century, the origin of the detective novels can be traced several years back in the history of literary writing. Both the detective-story proper and the pure tale of horror are very ancient in origin. All native folklore has its ghost tales, while the first four detective stories…hail respectively from the Jewish Apocrypha,\n\nThis volume argues that we must examine the boundaries in fiction and non-fiction crime writing with an awareness of and turn toward the unseen structures and spatial uncertainties that so often lead to collective anxieties. The chapters within utilize theories of cultural memory and/or deep mapping in order to explore the interplay of the literary, historical, social, and cultural in various modes of crime writing through the examination of unseen structures and uncertain spaces and provide new insights into the works of iconic authors, such as Agatha Christie, and iconic fictional figures, such as Sherlock Holmes, as well as into underexplored subjects, such as Ukrainian detective fiction of the Soviet period and crime writing by a Bengali police detective at the turn of the twentieth century. This volume features authors and subjects that are global in scope with original, innovative work on crime writing from the 1890s to as recent as 2017. The breadth of coverage—of both time and place—is an indicator of a text in which seasoned readers, advanced students, and academics will find specialized explorations of individual works and authors, while the critical and theoretical approaches and the topical coherence of the collection offer to a wide audience a scholarly overview of crime writing, as a still-growing area of popular interest and a still-evolving field of intellectual exploration."
