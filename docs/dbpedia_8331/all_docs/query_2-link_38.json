        "text": "HAMLET\n\nSpeak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you, trippingly on the tongue. But if you mouth it, as many of our players do, I had as lief the town crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air too much with your hand thus, but use all gently, for in the very torrent, tempest, and (as I may say) whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness. Oh, it offends me to the soul tohear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb-shows and noise. I would have such a fellow whipped for o’erdoing Termagant. It out-Herods Herod. Pray you, avoid it.\n\nHAMLET\n\nPlease repeat the speech just as I said it to you—smoothly and easily. If you exaggerate it in the way so many current actors do, I’d rather have the town crier say the lines. Don’t make huge gestures with yours hands, like this. Gesture just a bit—because to truly communicate a whirlwind of passion, you must present it in a way that’s smooth and real. Oh, I absolutely hate it when I hear some overexcited actor in a wig shout his “passionate” lines—splitting the audience’s eardrums in an effort to impress the unsophisticated watchers standing just in front of the stage, who for the most part can only appreciate loud noises and pantomime shows. I would whip a guy for overdoing the part of a tyrant. That’s worse than those old plays in which King Herod ranted. Please, don’t do that.\n\nHAMLET\n\nBe not too tame neither, but let your own discretion beyour tutor. Suit the action to the word, the word to the action, with this special observance that you o’erstep not the modesty of nature. For anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing, whose end, bothat the first and now, was and is to hold, as ’twere, the mirror up to nature, to show virtue her own feature,scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure. Now this overdone or come tardy off, though it make the unskillful laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve, the censure of the which one must in your allowance o’erweigh a whole theatre of others . Oh, there be players that I have seen play and heard others praise (and that highly), not to speak it profanely, that, neither having th’ accent of Christiansnor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of nature’s journeymen had made men and not made them well,they imitated humanity so abominably.\n\nHAMLET\n\nDon’t be too tame, either. Instead, let your judgment guide you. Fit the action to the word and the word to the action. And never overact in a way that seems unnatural. Exaggerated overacting is the opposite of what acting should be. The purpose of acting—both when it began and until now—is to hold a mirror up to nature, virtue, vice, and to the spirit of the times. If you overact or have bad timing, it may make the unknowledgeable laugh, but will make those who know theater grieve. And you should care more about a single knowledgeable theater-lover than an entire theater of the uninformed. I’ve seen actors perform who are highly praised by others, but who—not to be rude—can’t perform a credible Christian, pagan, or even a man. They strut around and bellow like beasts that had been made by some apprentice to God—they imitate men, but extremely badly.\n\nHAMLET\n\nNay, do not think I flatter. For what advancement may I hope from thee That no revenue hast but thy good spirits, To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flattered? No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp, And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear? Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice And could of men distinguish, her election Hath sealed thee for herself, for thou hast been— As one in suffering all that suffers nothing— A man that Fortune’s buffets and rewards Hast ta’en with equal thanks. And blessed are those Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled, That they are not a pipe for Fortune’s finger To sound what stop she please. Give me that man That is not passion’s slave, and I will wear him In my heart’s core, ay, in my heart of heart, As I do thee. —Something too much of this.— There is a play tonight before the king. One scene of it comes near the circumstance Which I have told thee of my father’s death. I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot, Even with the very comment of thy soul Observe mine uncle. If his occulted guilt Do not itself unkennel in one speech, It is a damnèd ghost that we have seen, And my imaginations are as foul As Vulcan’s stithy. Give him heedful note. For I mine eyes will rivet to his face, And after we will both our judgments join In censure of his seeming.\n\nHAMLET\n\nNo, don’t think I’m flattering you. What could I hope to get from you, who has nothing other than your good graces to support you? Why would anyone flatter a poor person? No, only flatter the rich, or bow to those who might respond to your fawning with money or favors. Do you understand me? Since I have the power and ability to distinguish between men, my soul has chosen you for a friend because you are—as one who endures everything, and therefore allows nothing to make you suffer—a man who accepts all the twists and turns of fate, positive or negative, with the same calm thankfulness. Blessed are those who have a perfect balance of passion and reason, because they cannot be simply played by Fate any which way she chooses. Show me a man who is not a slave to his emotions, and I will keep him close to my heart—yes, in my heart of hearts, as I do you. But I’ve said too much. A play will be performed tonight in front of the king. One of the scenes in it comes close to showing the circumstances I told you about regarding my father’s death. During that scene, please watch my uncle with all of your care and attention. If his hidden guilt is not revealed during the scene, then that ghost was a demon—and my ideas about my uncle were dirty and wrong. Watch him carefully, as will I. Afterwards, we’ll meet and come to a joint conclusion about whether or not he is guilty.\n\nTrumpets play. The pantomime begins. A king and queen enter and embrace each other lovingly. She kneels before him and makes a show of her devotion to him. He lifts her up and rests his head on her neck, then lies down on a bank of flowers. She sees he is asleep, and leaves. Soon another man enters, takes the crown off the sleeping king’s head and kisses it, then pours poison in the king’s ear, and exits. The queen returns and finds the king dead. She weeps passionately. The killer returns, along with three others, and pretends to grieve with the queen. The dead body is carried away. The killer woos the queen with gifts. For a while she is cold and unwilling, but eventually accepts his advances.\n\nTrumpets play. The pantomime begins. A king and queen enter and embrace each other lovingly.

You are so sick of late, So far from cheer and from your former state, That I distrust you. Yet though I distrust, Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must. For women fear too much, even as they love, And women’s fear and love hold quantity, In neither aught, or in extremity. Now what my love is, proof hath made you know, And as my love is sized, my fear is so: Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear. Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.\n\nPLAYER QUEEN\n\nMay we continue to love each other for another thirty years. But I am sad. You’ve been so sick recently—so different from your former cheerful self—that I worry about you. But though I worry, don’t let it upset you, my lord. Women in love are always afraid. For women, love and fear go hand in hand—whether or not there is reason to worry. I’ve proven the quality of my love. And as my love is deep, so too is my fear. When someone’s love is great, little worries become big. Little fears grown big are a sign of great love.\n\nPLAYER KING\n\nI do believe you think what now you speak, But what we do determine oft we break. Purpose is but the slave to memory, Of violent birth, but poor validity, Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree, But fall, unshaken, when they mellow be. Most necessary ’tis that we forget To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt. What to ourselves in passion we propose, The passion ending, doth the purpose lose. The violence of either grief or joy Their own enactures with themselves destroy. Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament. Grief joys, joy grieves on slender accident. This world is not for aye, nor ’tis not strange That even our loves should with our fortunes change. For ’tis a question left us yet to prove, Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love. The great man down, you mark his favorite flies. The poor advanced makes friends of enemies. And hitherto doth love on fortune tend, For who not needs shall never lack a friend, And who in want a hollow friend doth try, Directly seasons him his enemy. But, orderly to end where I begun, Our wills and fates do so contrary run That our devices still are overthrown. Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own. So think thou wilt no second husband wed, But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.\n\nPLAYER KING\n\nI believe that’s what you think now. But what we swear we’ll do we often don’t. Intentions are driven by memory. They are strong at first, but fade over time—like an unripe apple that sticks to the tree, but falls on its own to the ground when ripe. It’s necessary for us to forget to meet the obligation we impose on ourselves. We forget to do what we promise to do in moments of passion once that passion fades. Grief or joy might spur us to action, but that call to action fades along with the grief or joy. Grief becomes joy, and joy turns to grief, based on little twists of fate. The world won’t last forever, so it’s not odd that even love can change as our fate changes. It remains an open question whether love propels your fate, or your fate propels love. When the great man falls, he is deserted. When a poor man rises, enemies become friends. Love is similarly dependent on fortune. A person with money will never lack friends, while a friend who asks another for money will make that friend an enemy. Back to the point on which I began: our desires and our fates will never match. So our plans never end up as we hope. What we want to happen, and what happens, will never be the same. So you think you’ll never marry again, but those thoughts will die when I do.\n\nHAMLET\n\n[Reciting like an actor] Let the deer that’s been shot go weep alone, while the uninjured deer plays. For some must watch while others must sleep—that’s the way of the world.\n\n[To HORATIO] Don’t you think that with my acting skill—if I wore some plumes of feathers and had decorative flowers on my shoes—I could get a job in a troupe of actors, if things went wrong in the rest of my life?\n\nHAMLET\n\nWhy, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me!You would play upon me. You would seem to know my stops. You would pluck out the heart of my mystery. You would sound me from my lowest note to the top of my compass. And there is much music, excellent voice, in this little organ, yet cannot you make it speak? ‘Sblood, do you think I am easier to be played on than apipe? Call me what instrument you will, though you can fret me, yet you cannot play upon me.\n\nHAMLET\n\nWell, look at that, how you treat me like such a fool. You keep trying to play me—as if you knew exactly where to put your fingers—to tease out my mystery—playing the full scale of all my notes. There is so much music in this little instrument, and yet you can’t make it speak? By God, do you think I’m easier to play than a recorder? Call me whatever instrument you want—even though you try to push my buttons, you can’t play me.\n\nHAMLET\n\n‘Tis now the very witching time of night, When churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out Contagion to this world. Now could I drink hot blood And do such bitter business as the bitter day Would quake to look on. Soft, now to my mother.— O heart, lose not thy nature, let not ever The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom. Let me be cruel, not unnatural. I will speak daggers to her but use none. My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites. How in my words somever she be shent, To give them seals never, my soul, consent!\n\nHAMLET\n\nIt’s now the time of night when witches roam, when graveyards open and the stench of hell breathes sickness into the world. Now I could drink hot blood and do things so terrible it would make people tremble the next day. But wait, I must now go to see my mother. Oh, my heart, do not lose your humanity, don’t let yourself become like Nero. Let me be cruel, but not inhuman. I’ll speak to her as sharply as a dagger, but not use a dagger. Though my words will condemn her to hell, my soul must never make that condemnation into reality by letting me kill her."
