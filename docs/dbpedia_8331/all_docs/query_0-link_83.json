        "meta_description": "The debut mystery novel in the Inspector Sejer Series from Norway's award-winning author of Hell Fire and The Whisperer.   Eva Magnus and her daughter are out walking by the river when they make a grisly discovery: a man's body floating on the water's surface. Eva goes to call the police, but when she reaches the phone, she dials another number altogether for her own reasons. But when the police find the body anyway, Inspector Sejer and his team quickly determine that the man, Egil, died from a violent attack. But Egil himself had been missing for months, and the trail to his killer is all but vanished. It's just as puzzling as another unsolved case on Sejer's desk: the murder of a prostitute, found dead just before Egil went missing. And as Sejer tries to piece together these two impossible cases, it soon appears that the two murders are connected. And if the Inspector can't figure out the culprit behind the crimes, someone else is going to pay with their life.  \"No one can thoroughly chill the blood the way Karin Fossum can.\" &#8212;Los Angeles Times",
