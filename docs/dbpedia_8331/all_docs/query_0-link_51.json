        "text": "Henning Mankell (3 February 1948 – 5 October 2015) was a Swedish crime writer, children's author and dramatist, best known for a series of mystery novels starring his most noted creation, Inspector Kurt Wallander.\n\nLife and career\n\nMankell was born in Stockholm, Sweden in 1948. His parents divorced when he was one year old, and for a majority of his childhood lived with his father, Ivar, and an older sister. The three lived first in Sveg (Härjedalen), where his father was a district judge, and later, Borås (Västergötland). Mankell's grandfather, also named Henning Mankell (1868–1930), was a composer. At the age of 20 he had already started a career as author and assistant director at the Riksteater in Stockholm. In the following years he collaborated with several theatres in Sweden.\n\nAfter living in Zambia and other African countries, Mankell was invited to become the artistic director of Teatro Avenida in Maputo, the capital of Mozambique. He subsequently spent extended periods in Maputo working with the theatre and writing, and built up his own publishing house (Leopard Förlag) in order to support young talents from Africa and Sweden.\n\nHe was married to Eva Bergman, daughter of Ingmar Bergman. On 12 June 2008, he was awarded an honorary Doctorate from the University of St Andrews in Scotland.\n\nMankell developed two original stories for the German police series Tatort. Actor Axel Milberg, who portrays Inspector Klaus Borowski, had asked Mankell to contribute to the show as the two were promoting The Chinaman audiobook, a project that Milberg had worked on. The episodes were scheduled to broadcast in Germany in 2010.\n\nMankell was set to work on a screenplay for Sveriges Television about his father-in-law, the famous movie and theatre director Ingmar Bergman, during 2010, on a series produced in four one-hour episodes. Production was planned for 2011. Mankell pitched the project to Sveriges Television.\n\nIn January 2014 Mankell announced that he had been diagnosed with cancer. In May he reported that treatments had worked well and he was getting better. On 5 October 2015, however, he succumbed to the disease.\n\nPolitical views\n\nIn his youth Mankell was a left-wing political activist and participated in the Protests of 1968 in Sweden, protesting against, among other things, the Vietnam War, the Portuguese Colonial War, and the Apartheid regime in South Africa. Furthermore, he got involved with the society Folket i Bild/Kulturfront which focused on cultural policy studies.\n\nIn the 1970s, Mankell moved from Sweden to Norway and lived with a Norwegian woman who was a member of the Maoist Workers' Communist Party. He took an active part in their actions but did not join the party.\n\nIn 2002 Mankell gave financial support by buying stocks for 50,000 NOK in the Norwegian left-wing newspaper Klassekampen.\n\nIn 2009, Mankell was a guest at a Palestinian literary conference. Thereafter, he claimed to have seen \"repetition of the despicable Apartheid system that once treated Africans and coloured as second-class citizens in their own country\". He also found a resemblance between the Israeli West Bank barrier and the Berlin Wall: \"The wall that is currently dividing the country will prevent future attacks, in short term. In the end, it will face the same destiny as the wall that once divided Berlin did.\"\n\nConsidering the environment the Palestinian people live in, he continued: \"Is it strange that some of them in pure desperation, when they cannot see any other way out, decide to become suicide bombers? Not really? Maybe it is strange that there are not more of them.\" Mankell has also stated that he does not support Hezbollah.\n\nIn Mankell's opinion the state of Israel should not to have a future in its current form, as a two-state solution \"will not be the end of the historical occupation\". He claimed not to have encountered antisemitism during his journey, just \"hatred against the occupants that is completely normal and understandable\", and he pointed out that \"to keep these two things separate is crucial\".\n\nGaza flotilla\n\nHenning Mankell was on board the MS Sofia, one of the boats which took part in the flotilla which tried to break the Israeli embargo of the Gaza strip. Following the Israel Defense Forces' boarding of the flotilla on the morning of May 31, 2010, Mankell was deported to Sweden. He subsequently called for global sanctions against Israel. In 2010 he was reported to be considering halting Hebrew translations of his books. However in June 2011, Mankell stated in an article in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz that he was in fact not considering preventing his books from being translated into Hebrew, and that anonymous persons had stolen his identity to make this false claim.\n\nMankell was supposed to be one of twenty Swedish participants in \"Freedom Flotilla II\" which never took place. It was originally scheduled to sail to Gaza in June 2011.\n\nCharity\n\nIn 2007, Henning Mankell donated 15 million Swedish Crowns (about 1,5 million euros) to SOS Children's Villages for a village in Chimoio in western Mozambique. Mankell has donated vast amounts of money to charitable organizations like SOS Children's Villages and Hand in Hand, (a collection of independent organizations).\n\nBibliography\n\nCrime fictionKurt Wallander\n\nKurt Wallander is a fictional police inspector living and working in Ystad, Sweden. In the novels, he solves shocking murders with his colleagues. The novels have an underlying question: \"What went wrong with Swedish society?\" The series has won many awards, including the German Crime Prize and the British 2001 CWA Gold Dagger for Sidetracked. The ninth book, The Pyramid, is a prequel: a collection of five novellas (Wallander's First Case, The Man with the Mask, The Man on the Beach, The Death of the Photographer, The Pyramid) about Wallander's past, with the last one ending just before the start of Faceless Killers. Ten years after The Pyramid, Mankell published another Wallander novel, The Troubled Man, which he said would definitely be the last in the series.\n\nMördare utan ansikte (1991; English translation by Steven T.
