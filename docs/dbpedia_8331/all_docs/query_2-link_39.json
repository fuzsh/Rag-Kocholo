        "text": "[The Teaching of the Savior]\n\nThe Revelation of the Mysteries Hidden in Silence\n\n[Those Things that He Taught to John, His Disciple]\n\nPrologue\n\nOne day John, the brother of James [these are the sons of Zebedee], was going up to the Temple. A Pharisee by the name of Arimanios came up to him and challenged him, asking: \"Where is the teacher you used to follow?\"\n\nJohn replied, \"He has gone back to the place from which he came.\"\n\nThe Pharisee said, \"That Nazarene misled you (plural), told you lies, closed your hearts and turned you away from your ancestral traditions.\n\nWhen I heard these things, I, John, turned away from the temple and went off to a deserted mountainous place. I was very unhappy, saying to myself:\n\n\"How was the Savior designated?\n\nWhy did his Father send him into the world?\n\nWho is his Father?\n\nWhat kind of realm will we go to?\n\nFor, although he told us, This realm is modeled on the imperishable realm,\n\nHe didn't teach us about the latter.\n\nAll of a sudden, while I was contemplating these things,\n\nBehold!\n\nThe heavens opened and the whole of creation shone with a light from above,\n\nAnd the world quaked!\n\nI was afraid, yet\n\nBehold!\n\nA little child appeared before me in the light.\n\nI continued looking at him as he became an old man\n\nAnd then he changed again, becoming like a young man.\n\nI didn't understand what I was seeing,\n\nBut the one likeness had several forms in the light,\n\nAnd these likenesses appeared each through the other\n\nAnd the vision had three forms.\n\nHe said to me,\n\nJohn, why doubt?\n\nWhy be afraid?\n\nDont you know this image?\n\nBe not afraid.\n\nI am with you (plural) always.\n\nI am the Father\n\nThe Mother\n\nThe Son\n\nI am the incorruptible\n\nPurity.\n\nI have come to teach you\n\nAbout what is\n\nAnd what was\n\nAnd what will be\n\nIn order for you to understand\n\nThe invisible world\n\nAnd the world that is visible\n\nAnd the immovable race of perfect humanity.\n\nRaise your head;\n\nUnderstand my lessons;\n\nShare them with any others who have received the spirit,\n\nWho are from the immovable race of perfect humanity.\n\nThe Inexpressible One\n\nThe One rules all. Nothing has authority over it.\n\nIt is the God.\n\nIt is Father of everything,\n\nHoly One\n\nThe invisible one over everything.\n\nIt is uncontaminated\n\nPure light no eye can bear to look within.\n\nThe One is the Invisible Spirit.\n\nIt is not right to think of it as a God or as like God.\n\nIt is more than just God.\n\nNothing is above it.\n\nNothing rules it.\n\nSince everything exists within it\n\nIt does not exist within anything.\n\nSince it is not dependent on anything\n\nIt is eternal.\n\nIt is absolutely complete and so needs nothing.\n\nIt is utterly perfect\n\nLight.\n\nThe One is without boundaries\n\nNothing exists outside of it to border it\n\nThe One cannot be investigated\n\nNothing exists apart from it to investigate it\n\nThe One cannot be measured\n\nNothing exists external to it to measure it\n\nThe One cannot be seen\n\nFor no one can envision it\n\nThe One is eternal\n\nFor it exists forever\n\nThe One is inconceivable\n\nFor no one can comprehend it\n\nThe One is indescribable\n\nFor no one can put any words to it.\n\nThe One is infinite light\n\nPurity\n\nHoliness\n\nStainless,\n\nThe One is incomprehensible\n\nPerfectly free from corruption.\n\nNot perfect\n\nNot blessed\n\nNot divine\n\nBut superior to such concepts.\n\nNeither physical nor unphysical\n\nNeither immense nor infinitesimal\n\nIt is impossible to specify in quantity or quality\n\nFor it is beyond knowledge.\n\nThe One is not a being among other beings\n\nIt is vastly superior\n\nBut it is not superior.\n\nIt is outside of realms of being and time\n\nFor whatever is within realms of being was created\n\nAnd whatever is within time had time allotted to it\n\nThe One receives nothing from anything.\n\nIt simply apprehends itself in its own perfect light\n\nThe One is majestic.\n\nThe One is measureless majesty\n\nChief of all Realms\n\nProducing all realms\n\nLight\n\nProducing light\n\nLife\n\nProducing life\n\nBlessedness\n\nProducing blessedness\n\nKnowledge\n\nProducing knowledge\n\nGood\n\nProducing goodness\n\nMercy\n\nProducing mercy\n\nGenerous\n\nProducing generosity\n\n[It does not possess these things.]\n\nIt gives forth light beyond measure, beyond comprehension.\n\n[What can I say?]\n\nHis realm is eternal, peaceful, silent, resting, before everything.\n\nHe is the head of every realm sustaining each of them through goodness.\n\nThe Origin of Reality\n\n[We would know nothing of the ineffable\n\nAnd nothing of the immeasurable\n\nWithout the help of the one who comes forth\n\nfrom the One who is the Father.\n\nHe alone has informed us.]\n\nThe Father is surrounded by light.\n\nHe apprehends himself in that light\n\n[which is the pure spring of the water of life\n\nthat sustains all realms].\n\nHe is conscious of his image everywhere around him,\n\nPerceiving his image in this spring of Spirit\n\nPouring forth from himself.\n\nHe is enamored of the image he sees in the light-water,\n\nThe spring of pure light-water enveloping him.\n\nHis self-aware thought (ennoia) came into being.\n\nAppearing to him in the effulgence of his light.\n\nShe stood before him.\n\nThis, then, is the first of the powers, prior to everything.\n\nArising out of the mind of the Father\n\nThe Providence (pronoia) of everything.\n\nHer light reflects His light.\n\nShe is from His image in His light\n\nPerfect in power\n\nImage of the invisible perfect Virgin Spirit.\n\nShe is the initial power\n\nglory of Barbelo\n\nglorious among the realms\n\nglory of revelation\n\nShe gave glory to the Virgin Spirit\n\nShe praised Him\n\nFor she arose from Him.\n\n[This, the first Thought, is the Spirits image]\n\nShe is the universal womb\n\nShe is before everything\n\nShe is:\n\nMother-Father\n\nFirst Man\n\nHoly Spirit\n\nThrice Male\n\nThrice Powerful\n\nThrice Named\n\nAndrogynous eternal realm\n\nFirst to arise among the invisible realms.\n\nShe, Barbelo, asked the virgin Spirit for foreknowledge (prognosis).\n\nThe Spirit agreed.\n\nForeknowledge came forth and stood by Providence\n\n[This one came through the Invisible Virgin Spirits Thought.]\n\nForeknowledge gave glory to the Spirit\n\nAnd to Barbelo, the Spirits perfect power,\n\nFor She was the reason that it had come into being.\n\nPrimary Structures of the Divine Mind\n\nShe, Barbelo, asked the virgin Spirit for Incorruptibility\n\nThe Spirit agreed.\n\nIncorruptibility came forth and stood by Thought and Foreknowledge.\n\nIncorruptibility gave glory to the Invisible Virgin Spirit\n\nAnd to Barbelo,\n\nFor She was the reason that it had come into being.\n\nShe asked for everlasting Life.\n\nThe Spirit agreed\n\nEverlasting life came forth and they all stood together.\n\nThey gave glory to the invisible Spirit\n\nAnd to Barbelo,\n\nFor She was the reason that it had come into being.\n\nShe asked for Truth.\n\nThe Spirit agreed\n\nTruth came forth and they all stood together.\n\nThey gave glory to the invisible Spirit\n\nAnd to Barbelo,\n\nFor She was the reason that it had come into being.\n\nThis is the fivefold realm of the Father:\n\nThe First Man who is\n\nThe Image of the Invisible Spirit who is\n\nProvidence who is\n\nBarbelo who is\n\nThought.\n\nAnd\n\nForeknowledge - Incorruptibility - Life Everlasting - Truth\n\n[These are an androgynous fivefold realm - therefore it is a realm of ten - of the Father.]\n\nSecondary Structures of the Divine Mind\n\nThe Father looked into Barbelo\n\n[into the pure light surrounding the Invisible Spirit]\n\nBarbelo conceived and bore a spark of light\n\nWho had blessedness similar to, but not equal to, her blessedness,\n\nWho was the only child of that motherfather\n\nThe only offspring,\n\nThe only begotten child of the pure light, the Father.\n\nThe Invisible Virgin Spirit celebrated the light that had been produced\n\nComing forth from the first power who is\n\nThe Providence\n\nBarbelo\n\nThe Spirit anointed him with Goodness, making him perfect\n\n[he lacked no goodness whatsoever,\n\nfor he was anointed with the Invisible Spirits Goodness]\n\nHe stood in the Spirits presence and it was poured upon him.\n\nHaving received this anointing from the Spirit he immediately glorified Him\n\nAnd he glorified the perfect Providence.\n\nBecause of Her he had come into being.\n\nHe asked for Mind (nous) to be a companion to him.\n\nThe Spirit consented\n\nWhen the Invisible Spirit consented\n\nMind came into being.\n\nIt stood by the Anointed\n\nand glorified the Spirit and Barbelo\n\n[These beings came into existence through silence and thought.]\n\nHe wished to act through the Word of the Invisible Spirit.\n\nWhose Will became an action and appeared with Mind\n\nGlorifying the Light.\n\nAnd then Word followed Will into being.\n\n[The Christ, the divine autogenes,\n\ncreated everything through the Word.]\n\nEverlasting Life and Will,\n\nMind, and Foreknowledge\n\nStood together.\n\nThey glorified the Invisible Spirit and Barbelo.\n\nBecause of Her they had come into being.\n\nTertiary Structures of the Divine Mind\n\nThe Holy Spirit\n\nBrought his and Barbelos divine autogenes Son to completion\n\nIn order that he could stand before the great Invisible Virgin Spirit\n\nAs the divine autogenes Christ\n\nAnd honor Him with a mighty voice.\n\n[The Son came through Providence].\n\nThe Invisible Spirit\n\nPlaced the divine autogenes over everything.\n\nAll authorities were subordinated to him.\n\nThe truth within him let him learn everything\n\n[He is called by the highest name of all.\n\nThat name will be told only to those who are worthy to hear it\n\nFrom the light, [which is the Christ,]\n\nFrom the incorruptibility,\n\nThrough a gift of the spirit\n\nThe Four Lights arising from the divine autogenes stood before him.\n\n[The four fundamental powers are Understanding, Grace, Perception, and Consideration.]\n\nGrace exists within the realm of the Light called Harmozel, the first angel.\n\nAlong with Harmozel are\n\nGrace\n\nTruth\n\nForm\n\nThe second Light is called Oriel and it stands over the second realm.\n\nWith Oriel are:\n\nConceptualization (Epinoia)\n\nPerception\n\nMemory\n\nThe third Light is called Daveithai and it stands over the third realm.\n\nWith Daveithai are:\n\nUnderstanding\n\nLove\n\nIdea\n\nThe fourth Light is called Eleleth and it stands over the fourth realm.\n\nWith Eleleth are:\n\nPerfection\n\nPeace\n\nWisdom (Sophia).\n\nThese are the four lights standing before the divine autogenes.\n\nTwelve realms stand before the Son of the Powerful\n\nThe autogenes\n\nThe Christ\n\nThrough the intention\n\nAnd the grace\n\nOf the Invisible Spirit\n\nTwelve realms belong to the Son of the autogenes.\n\n[All of this came into being through the intention of the Holy Spirit\n\nThrough the autogenes.]\n\nFrom the perfect minds foreknowledge\n\nThrough the intention of the Invisible Spirit\n\nAnd the autogeness will.\n\nThe perfect human appeared,\n\nIts first true manifestation\n\nThe Virgin Spirit named the human Adamas\n\nAnd placed him over the first realm with the mighty autogenes Christ\n\nWith the first Light Harmozel and its powers.\n\nThe Invisible One gave Adamas invincible power of mind.\n\nAdamas spoke, glorifying and praising the Invisible Spirit:\n\nEverything has come into being from you\n\nEverything will return to you.\n\nI will praise you and glorify you\n\nAnd the Autogenes\n\nAnd the triple realm:\n\nFather  Mother  Son,\n\nthe perfect power.\n\nOver the second realm was appointed Adamass son Seth\n\nWith the second Light Oriel.\n\nIn the third realm were placed the children of Seth\n\nWith the third Light Daveithai.\n\n[The souls of the saints are placed there.]\n\nIn the fourth realm were placed the souls of those ignorant of the fullness\n\nThose who did not repent at once\n\nBut who, after some time, eventually repented,\n\nThey are with the fourth Light Eleleth.\n\nAll of these created beings glorify the Invisible Spirit\n\nA Crisis that Became the World\n\nIt happened that the realm (aeon) Wisdom (Sophia)\n\nOf conceptual thought (Epinoia),\n\nBegan to think for herself,\n\nShe used the thinking (enthymesis)\n\nAnd the foreknowledge (prognosis)\n\nOf the Invisible Spirit.\n\nShe intended to reveal an image from herself\n\nTo do so without the consent of the Spirit,\n\nWho did not approve,\n\nWithout the thoughtful assistance of her masculine counterpart,\n\nWho did not approve.\n\nWithout the Invisible Spirits consent\n\nWithout the knowledge of her partner\n\nShe brought it into being.\n\nBecause she had unconquerable Power\n\nHer thought was not unproductive.\n\nSomething imperfect came out of her\n\nDifferent in appearance from her.\n\nBecause she had created it without her masculine counterpart\n\nShe gave rise to a misshapen being unlike herself.\n\nSophia saw what her desire produced.\n\nIt changed into the form of a dragon with a lions head\n\nAnd eyes flashing lightning bolts.\n\nShe cast him far from her,\n\nOutside of the realm of the immortal beings\n\nSo that they could not see him.\n\n[She had created him in ignorance.]\n\nSophia surrounded him with a brilliant cloud,\n\nPut a throne in the center part of the cloud\n\nSo that no one would see it.\n\n[Except for the Holy Spirit called the Mother of the Living]\n\nShe named him Yaldabaoth.\n\nYaldabaoth is the chief ruler.\n\nHe took great Power (dynamis) from his mother,\n\nLeft her, and moved away from his birthplace.\n\nHe assumed command,\n\nCreated realms for himself\n\nWith a brilliant flame that continues to exist even now.\n\nThe Fashioning of This World\n\nYadabaoth united with the thoughtlessness (aponoia) within him.\n\nHe begot ruling authorities (exousia)\n\nModeling them on the incorruptible realms above.\n\nThe first is Athoth\n\nThe second is Harmas [called the eye of flame]\n\nThe third is Kalilaumbri\n\nThe fourth is Yabel\n\nThe fifth is Adonaiu [called Sabaoth]\n\nThe sixth is Cain [called the sun]\n\nThe seventh is Abel\n\nThe eighth is Abrisene\n\nThe ninth is Yobel\n\nThe tenth is Armupiel\n\nThe eleventh is Melcheir-adonein\n\nThe twelfth is Belias\n\nWho rules over the very depth of Hades.\n\nHe made the first seven rulers to reign in the seven spheres of heaven.\n\nHe made the next five rulers to reign in the five depths of the abyss.\n\nHe shared a portion of his fire with them,\n\nBut shared none of the power of Light he had received from his mother.\n\n[He is ignorant darkness.\n\nWhen the Light mingled into the darkness\n\nthe darkness shone.\n\nWhen darkness mixed with the Light,\n\nthe Light diminished,\n\nNo longer Light nor darkness but dim.]\n\nThis dim ruler has three names:\n\nYaldabaoth is the first.\n\nSaklas is the second.\n\nSamael is the third.\n\nHe is blasphemous through his thoughtlessness.\n\nHe said I am God, and there is no God but me!\n\nSince he didnt know where his own Power originated.\n\nHis rulers created seven Authorities for themselves.\n\nEach of these Authorities created six demons apiece,\n\nThere came to be 365 demons altogether.\n\nHere are the seven Authorities names and physical forms:\n\nFirst, Athoth with a sheeps face\n\nSecond, Eloaios with a donkeys face\n\nThird, Astaphaios with a hyenas face\n\nFourth, Yao with the face of a seven headed snake\n\nFifth, Sabaoth who has the face of a dragon\n\nSixth, Adonin whose face is that of a monkey\n\nSeventh, Sabbataios with a face of flame and fire.\n\nThese are the seven of the week.\n\nThese Authorities rule the world.\n\nYaldabaoth has many faces.\n\nMore than all that have been listed\n\nSo he can convey any face he wants to the seraphim around him.\n\nYaldabaoth shared his fire with his seraphim\n\nBut gave them none of his pure Light\n\nAlthough he ruled them by virtue of the power and glory\n\nOf the Light had received from his Mother.\n\n[Therefore he called himself God and defied his place of origin.]\n\nHe united his thoughts sevenfold Powers with the Authorities who accompanied him.\n\nHe spoke and it happened.\n\nHe named those sevenfold Powers starting with the highest one:\n\nGoodness paired with the first: Athoth\n\nProvidence paired with the second: Eloaios\n\nDivinity paired with the third: Astaphaios\n\nLordship paired with the fourth: Yao\n\nKingdom paired with the fifth: Sabaoth\n\nZeal paired with the sixth: Adonin\n\nUnderstanding paired with the seventh: Sabbataios\n\nEach has its own realm modeled on one of the higher realms.\n\nAnd each new name refers to a glory in the heavens\n\nSo that Yaldabaoths demons might be destroyed.\n\nThe demons own names, given by Yaldabaoth, are mighty names\n\nBut the Powers names reflecting the glory above\n\nWill bring about the demons destruction and remove their Power.\n\nThat is why each has two names.\n\nYaldabaoth modeled his creation\n\nOn the pattern of the original realms above him\n\nSo that it might be just like the indestructible realms.\n\n[Not that he had ever seen the indestructible ones.\n\nRather, the power in him, deriving from his mother,\n\nmade him aware of the pattern of the cosmos above.]\n\nWhen he gazed upon his creation surrounding him\n\nHe said to his host of demons\n\nThe ones who had come forth out of him:\n\nI am a jealous God and there is no God but me!\n\n[But by doing this he admitted to his demons that there is indeed another God.\n\nFor, if there were no other God, whom would he possibly be jealous of?]\n\nHis mother began to move back and forth\n\nBecause she had become aware that she now lacked Light\n\nFor her brightness had dimmed.\n\n[Since her consort had not approved of her actions, she grew darker]\n\n[I said Master, what does it mean she moved back and forth?\n\nHe laughed, saying, Its not as Moses said upon the waters. Not at all.]\n\nWhen she saw the evil that had taken place and\n\nThe theft of light that her son had committed\n\nShe repented.\n\nIn the darkness of ignorance\n\nShe began to forget.\n\nShe began to be ashamed.\n\nBut she could not yet return above\n\nYet she began to move.\n\nAnd so she moved back and forth.\n\n[The arrogant one removed Power from his mother\n\nFor he was ignorant\n\nHe thought no one existed except for his mother.\n\nHe saw the host of demons he had created\n\nAnd he elevated himself above them.\n\nBut when the mother realized that that miscarriage\n\nWas so imperfect\n\nShe came to realize that her consort had not approved.\n\nShe repented and wept furiously.]\n\nAll of the divine realms (pleroma) heard her repentant prayer\n\nThey sought blessing for her from the Invisible Virgin Spirit.\n\nThe Spirit consented.\n\nHe poured the Holy Spirit over her\n\nBrought forth from the whole full realm.\n\n[Her consort did not come down to her on his own,\n\nbut he came through the whole full realm\n\nto restore her to her original condition.]\n\nShe was elevated above her son,\n\nBut she was not restored to her own original realm.\n\nShe would remain in the ninth sphere until she was fully restored.\n\nHumanity Begins\n\nThen came a voice from the highest realms saying:\n\nThe Man exists! And the Son of Man!\n\nYaldabaoth, chief ruler, heard it\n\nHe thought it came from his mother\n\nHe did not know the true source of the voice:\n\nThe Holy Mother-Father\n\nPerfect Providence\n\nImage of the Invisible\n\nFather of Everything\n\nIn whom everything has come to be.\n\nThe First Man\n\n[This is the one who appeared to them.\n\nHe appeared in the form of a human being.]\n\nAll of the realm of the chief ruler quaked!\n\nThe foundations of the abyss moved!\n\nHe illuminated the waters above the world of matter,\n\nHis image shown in those waters.\n\nAll the demons and the first ruler together gazed up\n\nToward the underside of the newly shining waters.\n\nThrough that light they saw the Image in the waters.\n\nYaldabaoth said to his subordinate demons:\n\nLets create a man according to the image of God\n\nAnd our own likeness\n\nSo that his image will illuminate us.\n\nEach one through anothers Power created aspects of the man;\n\nEach added a characteristic corresponding to the psychic factors\n\nThey had seen in the Image above them.\n\nThey made a creature of substance\n\nIn the likeness of that perfect First Man\n\nAnd they said, Let us call him Adam, so that his name will give us the power of light.\n\nConstruction of the Human Body\n\nThe seven Powers began to work:\n\n. Goodness made a psyche of bone\n\nProvidence made a psyche of sinew\n\nDivinity made a psyche of flesh\n\nLordship made a psyche of marrow\n\nKingdom made a psyche of blood\n\nZeal made a psyche of skin\n\nUnderstanding made a psyche of hair\n\nThe host of demons took these substances from the Powers to create the limbs and the body itself. They put the parts together and coordinated them.\n\nThe first ones began by making the head: Abron created his head; Meniggesstroeth created the brain; Asterechme the right eye; Thaspomocha, the left eye; Ieronumos, the right ear; Bissoum, the left ear; Akioreim, the nose; Banenrphroum, the lips; Amen, the front teeth; Ibikan, the molars; Basiliademe, the tonsils; Achcha, the uvula; Adaban, the neck; Chaaman, the neckbones; Dearcho, the throat; Tebar, the shoulder; Mniarcon, the elbow; Abitrion, the right arm; Evanthen, the left arm; Krys, the right hand; Beluai, the left hand; Treneu, the fingers of the right hand; Balbel, the fingers of the left hand; Kriman, fingernails; Astrops, the right breast; Barroph, the left breast; Baoum, the right shoulder joint; Ararim, the left shoulder joint; Areche, the belly; Phthave, the navel; Senaphim, the abdomen; Arachethopi, the right ribs; Zabedo, the left ribs; Barias, the right hip; Phnouth the left hip; Abenlenarchei, the marrow; Chnoumeninorin, the skeleton; Gesole, the stomach; Agromauna, the heart; Bano, the lungs; Sostrapal, the liver; Anesimalar, the spleen; Thopithro, the intestines; Biblo, the kidneys; Roeror, the sinews; Taphreo, the spine; Ipouspoboba, the veins; Bineborin, the arteries; Atoimenpsephei, respiration; Entholleia, the flesh; Bedouk, the right buttock; Arabeei, the penis; Eilo, the testicles; Sorma, the genitals; Gormakaiochlabar, the right thigh; Nebrith, the left thigh; Pserem, the kidneys of the right leg; Asaklas, the left kidney; Ormaoth, the right leg; Emenun, the left leg; Knyx, the right shin; Tupelon, the left shin; Achiel, the right knee; Phnene, the left knee; Phiouthrom, the right foot; Boabel, its toes; Trachoun, the left foot; Phikna, its toes; Miamai, the toenails.\n\nAnd those who were appointed over all of these are:\n\nZathoth,\n\nArmas,\n\nKalila,\n\nIabel,\n\nSabaoth,\n\nCain,\n\nAbel.\n\nThe energizing powers in the limbs were divided among:\n\nthe head made by Diolimodraza; the neck by Yammeax; the right shoulder Yakouib; the left shoulder Verton; the right hand Oudidi; the left Arbao; the fingers of the right hand Lampno; the fingers of the left hand Leekaphar; the right breast Barbar; the left breast Imae; the chest Pisandriaptes; the right shoulder joint Koade; the left shoulder joint Odeor; the right ribs Asphixix; the left ribs Synogchouta; the abdomen Arouph; the womb Sabalo; the right thigh Charcharb; the left thigh Chthaon; the genitals Bathinoth; the right leg Choux; the left leg Charcha; the right shin Aroer; the left shin Toechtha; the right knee Aol; the left knee Charaner; the right foot Bastan; its toes Archentechtha; the left foot Marephnounth; its toes Abrana.\n\nSeven govern the whole body:\n\nMichael,\n\nOuriel,\n\nAsmenedas,\n\nSaphasatoel,\n\nAarmouriam,\n\nRichram,\n\nAmiorps.\n\nThe one who governs perceptions: Archendekta\n\nThe one who governs reception: Deitharbathas\n\nThe one who governs imagination: Oummaa\n\nThe one who governs integration: Aachiaram\n\nThe one who governs impulse: Riaramnacho.\n\nThere is a fourfold source of the bodily demons:\n\nHot, Cold, Dry, Wet.\n\n[Matter is the mother of them all.]\n\nRuler of hot: Phloxopha\n\nRuler of cold: Oroorrothos\n\nRuler of dry: Erimacho\n\nRuler of wet: Athuro.\n\nTheir mother stands among them: Onorthochrasaei\n\nShe is unlimited\n\nShe mixes with all of them.\n\nShe is matter\n\nAnd they are nourished by her.\n\nThe four chief demons are:\n\nEphememphi, associated with pleasure,\n\nYoko, associated with desire,\n\nNenentophni, associated with distress,\n\nBlaomen, associated with fear.\n\nTheir mother is Esthesis-Zouch-Epi-Ptoe.\n\nOut from these four demons come passions:\n\nFrom distress arises\n\nEnvy, jealousy, grief, vexation,\n\nDiscord, cruelty, worry, mourning.\n\nFrom pleasure comes much evil\n\nAnd unmerited pride,\n\nAnd so forth.\n\nFrom desire comes\n\nAnger, fury, bitterness, outrage, dissatisfaction\n\nAnd so forth.\n\nFrom fear emerges\n\nHorror, flattery, suffering, and shame.\n\n[Their thought and truth is Anayo, the ruler of the material soul.\n\nIt belongs with the seven senses, Esthesis-Zouch-Epi-Ptoe.]\n\nThis is the total number of the demons: 365\n\nThey worked together to complete, part by part, the psychical and the material body.\n\nThere are even more of them in charge of other passions\n\nThat I didnt tell you about.\n\nIf you want to know about them\n\nYou will find the information in the Book of Zoroaster.\n\nAll of Yaldabaoths servants and his demons\n\nWorked to finish the psychic body.\n\nFor a very long time it lay inanimate\n\nIt did not move.\n\nYaldabaoths mother wanted to take back the Power\n\nShe had turned over to the Chief Ruler.\n\nShe earnestly asked the most merciful,\n\nThe Mother-Father of everything,\n\nFor help.\n\nYaldabaoth Deceived\n\nBy His sacred command He sent down the five Lights\n\nIn the forms of the principal advisors to Yaldabaoth.\n\n[This led to the removal of Yaldabaoths mothers divine Power from him.]\n\nThey told Yaldabaoth:\n\nBlow some of your Spirit in the mans face,\n\nThen his body will rise up.\n\nYaldabaoth blew some of his Spirit into the man.\n\nThat Spirit was the divine Power of his mother.\n\n[He didnt understand what was happening, for he lived in ignorance.]\n\nHis mothers divine Power left Yaldabaoth\n\nIt entered the psychic human body\n\nModeled on the primordial image.\n\nThe human body moved!\n\nIt grew powerful!\n\nIt shone!\n\nYaldabaoths demonic forces envied the man.\n\nThrough their united efforts he had come into being\n\nThey had given their Power to him.\n\nHis understanding was far greater than that of those who had created him.\n\nAnd greater than that of the Chief Ruler himself.\n\nWhen they realized that he shone with light\n\nAnd could think better than they could\n\nAnd was naked of evil,\n\nThey took him and cast him down\n\nInto the lowest depths of the material world.\n\nThe Beginning of Salvation\n\nThe blessed one.\n\nThe Mother-Father\n\nThe good merciful one\n\nLooked compassionately upon the Mothers Power\n\nRelinquished by the Chief Ruler.\n\nSince Yaldabaoths demons might again overpower the perceptible psychic body\n\nHe sent down from his good Spirit a helper for Adam,\n\nOut of his great compassion\n\nA light-filled Epinoia emerged.\n\nAnd he called her Life (Zoe).\n\nShe aids the entire creation\n\nWorking with him\n\nRestoring him to the fullness.\n\nShe taught Adam about the way his people had descended\n\nShe taught Adam about the way he could ascend,\n\nWhich is the way he had descended.\n\nThe light-filled Epinoia was hidden in Adam.\n\nSo that the rulers wouldnt know about her\n\nFor Epinoia would repair the disaster their mother had caused.\n\n[Adam was revealed because within him dwelt the shadow of light.\n\nHis mental abilities were far greater than those of his creators.\n\nThey had gazed upward and seen his exalted mental capability.]\n\nThe host of rulers and demons plotted together\n\nThey mixed fire and earth and water\n\nTogether with four blazing winds\n\nThey melded them together in great turbulence.\n\nAdam was brought into the shadow of death.\n\nThey intended to make him anew\n\nThis time from\n\nEarth,\n\nWater,\n\nFire,\n\nWind,\n\nWhich are\n\nMatter,\n\nDarkness,\n\nDesire,\n\nThe Artificial Spirit.\n\nThis all became a tomb,\n\nA new kind of body.\n\nThose thieves bound the man in it,\n\nEnchained him in forgetfulness,\n\nMade him subject to dying.\n\n[His was the first descent\n\nAnd the first separation.\n\nYet the light-filled Epinoia within him will elevate his thinking.]\n\nAdam in Yaldabaoth's Paradise\n\nThe rulers took the man and put him into paradise\n\nThey told him to eat freely.\n\n[Their food is bitter; their beauty is corrupt.\n\nTheir food is deceit; their trees are ungodliness.\n\nTheir fruit is poison.\n\nTheir promise is death.]\n\nThey placed the Tree of Their Life into the middle of paradise.\n\n[I will teach you (plural) the secret of their life:\n\nThe plan that they made together about an artificial spirit.]\n\nIts root is bitter\n\nIts branches are dead.\n\nIts shadow is hatred\n\nIts leaves are deception\n\nThe nectar of wickedness is in its blossoms.\n\nIts fruit is death\n\nIts seed is desire\n\nIt flowers in the darkness.\n\nThose who eat from it are denizens of Hades\n\nDarkness is their resting place.\n\nAs for the tree called The Knowledge Of Good And Evil\n\nIt is the Epinoia of the light.\n\nThey commanded him not to eat from it,\n\nStanding in front to conceal it,\n\nFor fear that he might look upwards to the fullness\n\nAnd know the nakedness of his indecency.\n\n[However, I caused them to eat.\n\nI asked the Savior,\n\nLord, isnt it the serpent that caused Adam to eat?\n\nHe smiled and replied,\n\nThe serpent caused them to eat\n\nin order to produce the wickedness of the desire to reproduce\n\nthat would make Adam helpful to him.]\n\nThe chief ruler, Yaldabaoth, knew that\n\nBecause the light-filled Epinoia within Adam\n\nMade his mental abilities greater than his own,\n\nAdam had been disobedient.\n\nIn order to recover the Power that he had put into Adam\n\nYaldabaoth made Adam completely forgetful.\n\n[I asked the Savior, What is it to be completely forgetful?\n\nHe replied, It is not what Moses wrote in his first book:\n\nHe caused Adam to fall into deep sleep\n\nRather, Adams perceptions were veiled\n\nAnd he became unconscious.\n\nAs he (Yaldabaoth) said through his prophet:\n\n'I will make their minds dull so that they do not see or understand.']\n\nWoman Comes into Being\n\nThe light-filled Epinoia hid deep within Adam.\n\nThe Chief Ruler tried to remove her from his ribcage,\n\nBut Epinoia cannot be captured.\n\nAlthough the darkness pursued her it did not catch her.\n\nThe Chief ruler did remove a portion of his Power from Adam\n\nTo create a person with a womans form\n\nModeled on the light-filled Epinoia that had been manifested to him.\n\nHe placed the Power removed from the man into the woman.\n\n[It did not happen the way Moses said it did:\n\nhe took a rib and made the woman.]\n\nAdam saw the woman standing next to him.\n\nThe light-filled Epinoia immediately appeared to him\n\nShe raised up the veil that dulled his mind.\n\nHe sobered up from the dark drunkenness\n\nAnd he recognized his own counterpart.\n\nHe said: This is bone from my bones\n\nFlesh from my flesh.\n\nBecause of this a man will leave his mother and father\n\nAnd be joined to a woman and those two will become one flesh.\n\nFor they will send his helper to him.\n\n[Sophia, our sister, came down\n\nDescending innocently\n\nSo as to regain what she had lost.\n\nTherefore she was called Life.\n\nThe Mother of the Living\n\nThe one from the Providence of the Authority of Heaven\n\nBy her assistance people can achieve perfect knowledge.]\n\nI appeared as an eagle perched on the Tree of Knowledge!\n\n[Which is the Epinoia from the pure Providence of Light.]\n\nIn order to teach them\n\nAnd raise them up from sleeps depths.\n\n[For the two of them were fallen and aware of their nakedness.\n\nEpinoia appeared as a being full of light\n\nShe enlightened their minds.]\n\nWhen Yaldabaoth discovered that they had moved away from him\n\nHe cursed his earth.\n\nHe located the woman as she was preparing herself for her man.\n\nHe gave the woman over so that the man might be her master,\n\nBecause he did not know the secret of the divine strategy.\n\nThe man and woman were too terrified to renounce Yaldabaoth,\n\nWho showed his ignorance to his angels\n\nAnd he cast both of them out of paradise\n\nDressing them in heavy darkness.\n\nThe Chief Archon saw the young woman who was standing by Adam.\n\nHe realized that the light-filled Epinoia of life was within her.\n\nYaldabaoth became completely ignorant.\n\n[When the Providence of all saw what was going to happen\n\nShe sent assistants to remove Divine Life from Eve.]\n\nYaldabaoth raped Eve.\n\nShe bore two sons.\n\n[Elohim was the name of the first.\n\nYahweh was the name of the second.\n\nElohim has a bears face.\n\nYahweh has a cats face.\n\nOne is righteous;\n\nOne is not.\n\nYahweh is righteous;\n\nElohim is not.\n\nYahweh would command fire and wind\n\nElohim would command water and earth.]\n\nYaldabaoth deceptively named the two: Cain and Abel.\n\n[From then until now sexual intercourse has persisted\n\nThanks to the Chief Ruler\n\nWho put desire for reproduction into the woman who accompanies Adam.\n\nThrough intercourse the Ruler caused new human bodies to be produced\n\nAnd he blew his artificial spirit into each of them.]\n\nYaldabaoth installed the two with authority over natural elements\n\nSo they can to rule over the tomb.\n\nThe Children of Seth Populate the World\n\nAdam had intercourse with the image of his foreknowledge (prognosis)\n\nHe begot a son like the Son of Man\n\nAnd he called that son Seth\n\nModeling him on the heavenly race in the higher realms.\n\nIn the same way the mother sent down her spirit\n\nThe image of herself\n\nA model of the full higher realm,\n\nIn order to prepare a place for the descent of the realms.\n\nThe Chief Ruler, though, forced the humans to drink\n\nFrom waters of forgetfulness\n\nSo that they might not know their true place of origin.\n\nThe children (of Seth) remained in this condition for a while\n\nIn order that when the Spirit descends from the holy realms\n\nThe Spirit can raise up the children and heal them from all defects\n\nAnd thus restore complete holiness to the fullness of God.\n\nSix Questions about the Soul\n\nI asked the Savior, Lord, will every soul be saved and enter the pure light?\n\nHe replied, You are asking an important question, one it will be impossible to answer for anyone who is not a member of the unmoved race. They are the people upon whom the Spirit of Life will descend and the power will enable them to be saved and to become perfect and worthy of greatness. They expunge evil from themselves and they will care nothing for wickedness, wanting only that which is not corrupt. They will achieve freedom from rage, envy, jealousy, desire, or craving.\n\nThe physical body will negatively effect them. They wear it as they look forward to the time when they will meet up with those who will remove it. Those people deserve indestructible eternal life. They endure everything, bearing up under everything that happens so that they can deserve the good and inherit life eternal.\n\nThen I asked him, Lord, what about the souls who didnt do these things even though the Spirit of Lifes power descended on them?\n\nHe answered, If the Spirit descends to people they will be transformed and saved. The power descends on everyone and, without it, no one can even stand up. After they are born, if the Spirit of Life increases in them, power comes to them and their souls are strengthened. Nothing then can leave them astray into wickedness. But if the artificial spirit comes into people, it leads them astray.\n\nThen I said, Lord, when souls come out of the flesh where do they go?\n\nHe replied, smiling, If the soul is strong it has more of power than it has of the artificial spirit and so it flees from wickedness. With the assistance of the Incorruptible One that soul is saved and it attains eternal rest.\n\nI then asked him, Lord, what of the souls of the people who do not know whose people they are? Where do they go?\n\nHe responded, In those people the artificial spirit has grown strong and they have gone astray. Their souls are burdened, drawn to wickedness, and cast into forgetfulness.\n\nWhen they come forth from the body, such a soul is given over to the powers created by the rulers, bound in chains, and cast into prison again. Around and around it goes until it manages to become free from forgetfulness through knowledge. And so, eventually, it becomes perfect and is saved.\n\nThen I asked, Lord, how does the soul shrink down so as to be able to enter its mother or a man?\n\nHe was happy that I asked this and said, You are truly blessed because you have understood. The soul should be guided by another within whom is the Spirit of Life. It will be saved by that means and accordingly will not have to enter a body again.\n\nAnd I said, Lord, what happens to the souls of people who achieved true knowledge, but who turned away from it?\n\nHe said to me, Demons of poverty will take them to a place where there is no possibility of repentance. There they will stay until the time when those who blasphemed against the spirit will be tortured and subjected to punishment forever.\n\nI asked, Lord, where did the artificial spirit come from?\n\nAnd he told me:\n\nThree Plots against Humanity\n\nThe Mother-Father is merciful\n\nA Holy Spirit sympathizing with us.\n\nThrough the Epinoia of the Providence of the light\n\nIt raises up the children of the perfect race\n\nRaising up their thought, their light eternal.\n\nWhen the Chief Archon learned that they were elevated above him\n\nAnd that their mental ability surpassed his\n\nHe wanted to put a stop to their thought\n\nBut he did not know the extent of their mental superiority\n\nAnd he could not stop them.\n\nHe made a plan with his demons\n\nWho are his powers\n\nEach of them fornicated with Wisdom (Sophia)\n\nAnd produced fate\n\nThe last variety of imprisonment.\n\nFate changes unpredictably\n\nIt is of different sorts just as the demons are of different sorts.\n\nFate is hard.\n\nFate is stronger than\n\nThe gods, the authorities, the demons, the generations of people\n\nWho are caught up in it.\n\nOut of fate emerged\n\nSinfulness, violence, blasphemy, forgetfulness, ignorance,\n\nWeighty commandments\n\nHeavy sins\n\nTerrible fear.\n\nIn this way all of creation became blind,\n\nIgnorant of God above everything.\n\nBecause of imprisonment in forgetfulness\n\nThey are unaware of their sins,\n\nThey are bound into periods of time and seasons\n\nBy fate who is lord of it all.\n\nYaldabaoth eventually came to regret everything he had created.\n\nHe decided to bring a great flood\n\nUpon creation, upon mankind.\n\nBut the great light of Providence warned Noah.\n\nHe preached to all of the children,\n\nThe sons of men,\n\nBut if they were strangers to him they didnt listen.\n\n[It was not the way Moses said: they hid in an ark.\n\nRather, they hid in a special place,\n\nNot just Noah\n\nbut also many other people from the immovable race.\n\nThey went into hiding within a cloud of light.]\n\nNoah knew his own authority\n\nAnd that of the light Being who illuminated them\n\nAlthough the Chief Ruler poured darkness over all the world.\n\nThe Chief Ruler and his powers plotted a strategy,\n\nTo send his demons to human daughters\n\nAnd make themselves children by them to enjoy.\n\nBut they failed.\n\nAfter their failure they made another plan.\n\nThey created an artificial spirit\n\nModeled on the Spirit who descended\n\nSo, to impregnate souls by means of this spirit,\n\nThe demons changed appearance\n\nto look like the womens husbands\n\nThey filled the women with that spirit of darkness and wickedness.\n\nThey brought into being\n\nGold and silver,\n\nMoney and coins,\n\nIron and other metals and all things of this sort.\n\nAnd the people who were attracted were led astray into troubles\n\nAnd were greatly misled.\n\nAnd grew old\n\nExperiencing no pleasure,\n\nAnd died\n\nFinding no truth,\n\nNever knowing the true God.\n\nThis is the way that they enslaved all of creation\n\nFrom the foundation of the world until now.\n\n[They took some women and produced children out of darkness\n\nAnd they closed their hearts\n\nAnd they hardened themselves\n\nin the hardness of their artificial spirit\n\nUntil the present day.]\n\nThe Providence Hymn\n\nI am the Providence of everything.\n\nI became like my own human children.\n\nI existed from the first.\n\nI walked down every possible road.\n\nI am the wealth of the light.\n\nI am the remembering of the fullness.\n\nI walked into the place of greatest darkness and on down.\n\nI entered the central part of the prison.\n\nThe foundations of chaos quaked.\n\nI hid because of their evil.\n\nThey did not recognize me.\n\nI came down a second time\n\ncontinuing on.\n\nI emerged from among those of light\n\nI am the remembering of Providence\n\nI entered the middle of darkness,\n\nThe inner part of the underworld\n\nTo pursue my mission.\n\nThe foundations of chaos quaked.\n\nThreatening to collapse upon all who were there\n\nAnd utterly destroy them\n\nI soared upward again\n\nTo my roots in light\n\nSo as not to destroy them all yet.\n\nI descended a third time.\n\nI am light\n\nI am dwelling in light\n\nI am the remembering of Providence\n\nI entered the midst of darkness\n\nI came to the deepest part of the underworld.\n\nI let my face light up\n\nThinking of the end of their time\n\nI entered their prison\n\nThe body is that prison\n\nI cried out:\n\nAnyone who hears,\n\nRise up from your deep sleep!\n\nAnd the sleeping one awoke and wept\n\nWiping bitter tears saying\n\nWho calls me?\n\nWhere has my hope come from\n\nAs I lie in the depths of this prison?\n\nI am the Providence of pure light, I replied,\n\nI am the thought of the Virgin Spirit\n\nRaising you up to an honored place.\n\nRise up!\n\nRemember what you have heard.\n\nTrace back your roots\n\nTo me.\n\nThe merciful one.\n\nGuard against the poverty demons.\n\nGuard against the chaos demons.\n\nGuard against all who would bind you.\n\nAwaken!\n\nStay awake!\n\nRise out of the depths of the underworld!\n\nI raised him up\n\nI sealed him with the light/water of the five seals.\n\nDeath had no power over him ever again.\n\nI ascend again to the perfect realm.\n\nI completed everything and you have heard it.\n\nConclusion\n\nI have told you everything now so that you can write it all down\n\nAnd share it with your fellow spirits secretly\n\nFor this is the mystery of the unmoved race.\n\nThe Savior gave all of this to him to write and to keep carefully. He said to him, Anyone who exchanges it for a present, or for food, or for drink, or for clothing, or for anything else of that sort will be cursed.\n\nThese things came to John in a mystery.\n\nInstantly the Savior vanished.\n\nJohn came to his fellow disciples and told them what the Savior had said to him.\n\nJesus the Christ.\n\nAmen.\n\nThe Apocryphon of John"
