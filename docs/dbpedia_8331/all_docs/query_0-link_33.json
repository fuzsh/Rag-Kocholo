        "text": "The good turn\n\nby Dervla McTiernan\n\n\"Police corruption, an investigation that ends in tragedy and the mystery of a little girl's silence - three unconnected things that will prove to be linked by one small town. While Detective Cormac Reilly faces enemies at work and trouble in his personal life, Garda Peter Fisher is relocated out of Galway with the threat of prosecution hanging over his head. But even that is not as terrible as having to work for his overbearing father, the local copper for the pretty seaside town of Roundstone. For some, like Anna and her young daughter Tilly, Roundstone is a refuge from trauma. But even this village on the edge of the sea isn't far enough to escape from the shadows of evil men\"\n\nWe trade our night for someone else's day\n\nby Ivana Simić Bodroézić\n\n\"The city of Vukovar, situated on Croatia's easternmost periphery, across the Danube River from Serbia, was the sight of some of the worst violence in the wars that rocked ex-Yugoslavia in the early '90s. It is referred to only as \"the city\" throughout this taut political thriller from one of Europe's most celebrated young writers. In this city without a name, fences in schoolyards separate the children of Serbs from those of Croats, and city leaders still fight to free themselves from violent crimes they committed--or permitted--during the war a generation ago. Now, it is left to a new generation--the children, now grown up, to extricate themselves from this tragic place, innocents who are nonetheless connected in different ways to the crimes of the past. Nora is a journalist assigned to do a puff piece on the perpetrator of a crime of passion--a Croatian high school teacher who fell in love with one of her students, a Serb, and is now in prison for having murdered her husband. But Nora herself is the daughter of a man who was murdered years earlier under mysterious circumstances. And she wants, if not to avenge her father, at least to bring to justice whoever committed the crime. There's a hothouse intensity to this extraordinary noir page-turner because of how closely the author sets the novel within the historical record. This city is unnamed, the story is fictional, so it can show us what actually happened there\"\n\nOlav audunssøn : Vows\n\nby Sigrid Undset\n\nAs a child, Olav Audunssøn is given by his dying father to an old friend, Steinfinn Toressøn, who rashly promises to raise the boy as his foster son and eventually marry him to his own daughter, Ingunn. The two children, very different in temperament, become both brother and sister and betrothed. In the turbulent thirteenth-century Norway of Sigrid Undset’s epic masterpiece, bloodlines and loyalties often supersede law, and the crown and the church vie for power and wealth. Against this background and the complicated relationship between Olav and Ingunn, a series of fateful decisions leads to murder, betrayal, exile, and disgrace. In Vows, the first book in the powerful Olav Audunssøn tetralogy, Undset presents a richly imagined world split between pagan codes of retribution and the constraints of Christian piety—all of which threaten to destroy the lives of two young people torn between desires of the heart and the dictates of family and fortune.\n\nThe man who died\n\nby Antti Tuomainen\n\nA successful entrepreneur in the mushroom industry, Jaakko Kaunismaa is a man in his prime.

But soon his regiment collapses in the face of the onslaught of the Red Army, hell-bent on revenge in its race to Berlin. Many decades later, now an old man reckoning with his past, Meissner pens a letter to his grandson explaining his actions, his guilt as a Nazi participator, and the difficulty of life after war. Found among his effects after his death, the letter is at once a thrilling story of adventure and a questing rumination on the moral ambiguity of war. In his years spent fighting the Russians and attempting afterward to survive the Gulag, Meissner recounts a life lived in perseverance and atonement. Wracked with shame--both for himself and for Germany--the grandfather explains his dark rationale, exults in the courage of others, and blurs the boundaries of right and wrong. We Germans complicates our most steadfast beliefs and seeks to account for the complicity of an entire country in the perpetration of heinous acts. In this breathless and page-turning story, Alexander Starritt also presents us with a deft exploration of the moral contradictions inherent in saving one's own life at the cost of the lives of others and asks whether we can ever truly atone\"\n\nby Niki Brantmark\n\nIn a fast-paced world, wouldn’t it be wonderful if you could slow down and enjoy a life with less pressure, less stress, and more time for the things you love?\n\nSweden is ranked in the top three of the world’s happiest places to live, and lagom, which means “not too much and not too little—just right,” is the Swedish philosophy for enjoying balance in every aspect of life—from work and leisure to family and food, and everything in between. Experienced bakers know by touch when the dough they are kneading is lagom—not too moist and not too dry. At the office, professionals who work hard—but not to the detriment of other parts of their lives—are following the lagom ideal. Lagom is moderation, balance, and equality.\n\nBy using the Swedish lifestyle as an example, Niki Brantmark offers insightful suggestions and bite-sized actions to help you make subtle changes to your life, so you too can make time for the things that matter most and find greater happiness.\n\nThe truth and other lies : a novel\n\nby Sascha Arango\n\nAuthor Henry Hayden is left to deal with substantial consequences after his wife—the actual writer of the novels that made him famous —meets an untimely death.\n\nSascha Arango, one of Germany’s most prominent screenplay writers, is a two-time winner of the Grimme Prize, a prestigious award for German television, for his work on the long-running detective series Tatort. The Truth and Other Lies is his first novel.\n\n\"Smart, sardonic, and compulsively readable, this is the story of a man whose cunning allows him to evade the consequences of his every action, even when he’s standing on the edge of the abyss.\"\n\n– A New York Times NOTABLE BOOK\n\n\"A cross between James M. Cain and Patricia Highsmith, with a wide streak of sardonic humor, this is one wicked tale. You keep waiting for the author to slip, plot-wise, but, as with his protagonist, you wait in vain. German screenwriter Arango's first novel is superior pulp, with schemers all around and plenty to say about fame, identity, and mortality.\" – Kirkus Review\n\n“Arango, a German television writer, has constructed a clever plot that always surprises, told with dark humor and dry wit and bustling with aperçus that show no signs of jet lag from Imogen Taylor’s clean translation. (‘Every lie must contain a certain amount of truth if it’s to be convincing,’ Henry reflects, ‘like the olive in the martini.’) It’s a story constructed out of and upon lies.”\n\n– New York Times Sunday Book Review\n\nCold light\n\nby Jenn Ashworth\n\nIn this disturbing psychological thriller, two 14-year-old girls, best friends, find their lives forever changed during one terrible summer when lies, secrets, jealousy and a dangerous predatory adult result in tragedy, shaking their small English town to the core.\n\nAn unforgettable tale of friendship and memory—and the shattering truth behind a forgotten dead body newly unearthed—Cold Light is a welcome addition to the crime fiction and thriller ranks.\n\nAshworth’s first novel, A Kind of Intimacy, won a 2010 Betty Trask Award. After the publication of Cold Light in 2011, she was featured on the BBC’s Culture Show as one of the UK’s 12 best new novelists.\n\nWatch the trailer!\n\n“[Ashworth] Evokes a damaged mind with the empathy and confidence of Ruth Rendell.”\n\n– The Times (London)\n\n“Ashworth has the rare gift of being able to make her reader feel perverse and voyeuristic, implicated somehow in the tragedy laid out on the pages.”\n\n– Sunday Times (London)\n\n“Ashworth’s real subject is how we are unwittingly hurt by those in whom we have placed trust. Cold Light is filled with bruises, bleeding and psychological bludgeoning. A novel also about the power and pitfalls of narrative, it is told by the hand of a true storyteller.”\n\n– The Independent\n\n“Remember teenage bitching and insecurity? This book will take you back there, except with more lies and gruesome murder. Scarily believable.”\n\n– Fabulous\n\nThe square of revenge\n\nby Pieter Aspe\n\nA bizarre jewelry store burglary (involving jewels being dissolved in super-strong acid) and a note with a square on it left behind in a safe, sends Inspector Van In on a strange investigation involving Latin phrases, kidnapping and stolen, priceless art.\n\nThe Square of Revenge, by Pieter Aspe, is the first in a series of novels to feature Inspector Pieter Van In of Bruges. Aspe lives in Bruges, Belgium, and is one of that country's most popular contemporary writers. Inspector Van In has been compared to Simenon's Maigret and appears again in The Midas Murders and From Bruges with Love, also available in English.\n\n“Aspe is and always will be one of our best authors. An exciting murder mystery, a pinch of humor, and a generous serving of sex are among the highlights of the series.”\n\n– Crimezone.nl (Belgium)\n\n\"Set in the splendid medieval city of Bruges, it stars Inspector Pieter Van In, a brusque cop with every bad habit you can think of....Van In’s intuitive and often impulsive detection style can be disorienting, but his powers of observation are sharp and his insider’s view of this ancient and grandly aloof city are priceless. ”\n\n– Marilyn Stasio, The New York Times Book Review\n\n\"Belgian crime-fiction veteran Aspe's English-language debut thriller, originally published in Europe in 1995, introduces readers to chain-smoking, perpetually out-of-sorts DI Pieter Van In.\n\nWith a quirky character that is equal parts Simenon and Tati, this lighthearted novel has a decidedly European sensibility, but why it has taken so long for the series to reach U.S. shores is a mystery....Aspe satisfies the demands of a good mystery with his clever plotting and brisk pacing. The book is stocked with lively characters on both sides of the law, including a bad guy forced to impersonate a priest.\n\n– Kirkus Reviews\n\n“The Flemish Georges Simenon.”\n\n– Le Figaro (France)\n\n“A very likeable and very politically incorrect group of detectives. Humor is permanent, the plot is well constructed, and the whole story extremely exotic.”\n\n– L'Express (France)\n\nA man called Ove : a novel\n\nby Fredrik Backman\n\nA curmudgeonly old man, Ove hides a terrible personal loss beneath a cranky and short-tempered exterior.

This is the first novel by Swedish author Fredrik Backman who also wrote My Grandmother Asked Me to Tell You She’s Sorry and Britt-Marie Was Here.\n\nBut how do you pronounce \"Ove?\" That's the $64,000 question, unless you're Swedish.\n\n\"The debut novel from journalist Backman is a fuzzy crowd-pleaser that serves up laughs to accompany a thoughtful reflection on loss and love. Though Ove’s antics occasionally feel repetitive, the author writes with winning charm.\"\n\n– Publisher's Weekly (star/PW Pic)\n\n\"I loved A Man Called Ove so much that I started to ration how much I read to prolong my time with this cantankerous, low-key, misunderstood man. If you enjoyed Rachel Joyce’s marvellous bestseller, The Unlikely Pilgrimage Of Harold Fry, you will love this book. Each short chapter of A Man Called Ove could stand alone as a beautifully crafted short story. Bring the chapters together and you have the most uplifting, life-affirming and often comic tale of how kindness, love and happiness can be found in the most unlikely places. \"\n\n– Jane Clinton, Express (London)\n\n\"In the contest of Most Winning Combination, it would be hard to beat grumpy Ove and his hidden, generous heart.\"\n\n– Kirkus Reviews\n\nA Man Called Ove has been made into a movie in Sweden.
