Henning Mankell's novel The Return of the Dancing Master plays largely in Sveg. An important role in this novel is the combined rail and road bridge in front of Sveg.\n\nMARCH 2015 UPDATE:\n\nIn a February 2015 BBC Radio 4 interview (in English) author Henning Mankell read his \"Letter from Europe\" reflecting on the pace of life at his home in Antibes France, his walks along the sea, immigration, events in France, and more. At the 10 minute mark he talked about his ancestors immigration from Germany and Denmark to Sweden--and extended family crossing the ocean to the US.\n\nHenning Mankell was a prolific Swedish novelist, playwright, storyteller, and humanitarian who was devoted to fighting world poverty. He is the son Ivar Henningson, grandson of pianist Henning (Ivar Henning), great grandson of Emil Theodore Mankell, great great grandson of Johan Herman Mankell born in Niederasphe Germany. To learn more biographical information about Henning, check out his official website, henningmankell.com.

As part of his dedicated fight against AIDS in Africa, Henning was involved in the Memory Project, in which parents dying of AIDS write their memories for their children to read following the parents deaths. As Henning stated to a reporter of The Observer, Books are messengers. Like the diary of Anne Frank, they speak for the dead. The Memory Books will be the most dramatic books of our time, the heritage of being human. AIDS is the most catastrophic disease in the history of mankind. It is killing off complete societies.\n\nPUBLISHED BOOKS\n\nHenning wrote several plays, childrens books and novels, including several books about fictional police officer Kurt Wallander who solves murders in the Ystad area of Sweden.
