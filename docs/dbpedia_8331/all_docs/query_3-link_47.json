        "text": "VJ Books Presents Author Henning Mankell!\n\nHenning Mankell was born in Stockholm 1948. When he was two years old the family moved to Sveg where the father worked as a court judge. The family lived in the court house in Sveg and young Henning much enjoyed listening to the grown-ups discussions on crime and punishment. At age 16 Henning Mankell dropped out of school in order to work as a merchant seaman for two years before settling in Paris. After a year and a half in the French capital, Henning returned to Sweden and got a job as a stagehand in a Stockholm theater.\n\nIn 1973, Mankell released his debut novel, Bergspr_ngaren (The Rock Blast). In the same year, he went to Africa for the first time. Ever since he has divided his time between Africa and Sweden and since 1986 he is the artistic leader of Teatro Avenida in Maputo, Mozambique.\n\nIn 1991, the first novel in the Wallander series, Faceless Killers, was published. Since, Henning Mankell has written nine more novels in the series, including the novel Before the Frost, about Kurt Wallander's daughter Linda. Next to the Wallander novels, Mankell has also written more than twenty novels and a dozen children's and youth books. In addition, he is also one of Sweden's most frequently performed dramatists.\n\nIn 2013 Henning Mankell participated in World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. He is currently working on a new novel. Henning Mankell's latest novel, A Treacherous Paradise, was published in Sweden in August 2011 and will be translated into English in 2013.\n\nHenning Mankell Book List\n\nHis website: henningmankell.com\n\nSimilar authors: Arnaldur Indridason, Ian Rankin, Jo Nesbo, Yrsa Sigurdardottir\n\nFollow him on Facebook\n\nFollow him on Twitter\n\nA Treacherous Paradise\n\nSigned First UK Edition\n\nA Troubled Man\n\nSigned First Edition\n\nThe Man from Beijing\n\nSigned First Edition\n\nDaniel\n\nSigned First Edition\n\nKennedy's Brain\n\nSigned First Edition\n\nDepths\n\nSigned First Edition\n\nHenning Mankell Bibliography\n\nKurt Wallander Series\n\nFaceless Killers - 1991\n\nThe Dogs of Riga - 1992\n\nThe White Lioness - 1993\n\nThe Man Who Smiled - 2005\n\nSidetracked - 1995\n\nThe Fifth Woman - 1996\n\nOne Step Behind - 1997\n\nFirewall - 1998\n\nThe Pyramid - 2008\n\nThe Troubled Man - 2011\n\nAn Event in Autumn - UK, 2014\n\nSofia Series\n\nSecrets in the Fire - 2000\n\nPlaying with Fire - 2000\n\nThe Fury in the Fire - 2009\n\nLinda Wallander Series\n\nBefore the Frost - 2004\n\nJoel Gustafson Series\n\nA Bridge to the Stars - 2005\n\nShadows in Twilight - 2007\n\nWhen the Snow Fell - 2007\n\nThe Journey to the End of the World - 2008\n\nOther Novels\n\nThe Return of the Dancing Master - 2003*\n\nCrusader's Cross - 2005\n\nChronicler of the Winds - 2006\n\nDepths - 2006\n\nThe Eye of the Leopard - 2007\n\nKennedy's Brain - 2007\n\nThe Cat Who Liked Rain - 2008\n\nItalian Shoes - 2009\n\nShadow of the Leopard - 2009\n\nThe Man from Beijing - 2010*\n\nDaniel - 2010\n\nThe Shadow Girls - 2012\n\nA Treacherous Paradise - 2013\n\nCollections\n\nBecause I'm a Girl - 2009 - with Tim Butcher, Joanne Harris, Kathy Lette, Deborah Moggach, Marie Phillips, Irvine Welsh and Xiaolu Guo\n\nNon-Fiction\n\nI Die, But the Memory Lives On - 2004\n\nHenning Mankell Awards\n\n1991 - Swedish Crime Writers' Academy, Best Swedish Crime Novel Award for Faceless Killers\n\n1991 - The Nils Holgersson Prize for A Bridge to the Stars1992 - The Glass Key Award for Best Nordic Crime Novel: Faceless Killers\n\n1993 - Deutsher Jugendliteraturpreis for A Bridge to the Stars1995 - Swedish Crime Writers' Academy, Best Swedish Crime Novel Award for Sidetracked1996 - Swedish Astrid Lingren Prize\n\n2001 - Crime Writers' Association Gold Dagger for Best Crime Novel of the Year: Sidetracked2001 - Corine Literature Prize for One Step Behind2005 - Gumshoe Award for Best European Crime Novel: The Return of the Dancing Master2008 - Corine Literature Prize for the German Audiobook The Man from Beijing\n\nGo to top of page"
