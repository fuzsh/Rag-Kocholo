VJ Books Presents Author Henning Mankell!

Henning Mankell was born in Stockholm 1948. When he was two years old the family moved to Sveg where the father worked as a court judge. The family lived in the court house in Sveg and young Henning much enjoyed listening to the grown-ups discussions on crime and punishment. At age 16 Henning Mankell dropped out of school in order to work as a merchant seaman for two years before settling in Paris. After a year and a half in the French capital, Henning returned to Sweden and got a job as a stagehand in a Stockholm theater.

In 1973, Mankell released his debut novel, Bergspr_ngaren (The Rock Blast). In the same year, he went to Africa for the first time. Ever since he has divided his time between Africa and Sweden and since 1986 he is the artistic leader of Teatro Avenida in Maputo, Mozambique.

In 1991, the first novel in the Wallander series, Faceless Killers, was published. Since, Henning Mankell has written nine more novels in the series, including the novel Before the Frost, about Kurt Wallander's daughter Linda. Next to the Wallander novels, Mankell has also written more than twenty novels and a dozen children's and youth books. In addition, he is also one of Sweden's most frequently performed dramatists.

In 2013 Henning Mankell participated in World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. He is currently working on a new novel. Henning Mankell's latest novel, A Treacherous Paradise, was published in Sweden in August 2011 and will be translated into English in 2013.
