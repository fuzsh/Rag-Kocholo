"Secrets in the Fire" is a children's novel by Swedish author Henning Mankell. It was published in 1995 and was translated into English by Anne Connie Stuksrud. Land mine victim Sofia Alface served as the inspiration for the novel.

Plot summary

Sofia's hometown, in which she lived with her Mama Lydia and brothers and sister, was terrorised by The Bandits. The village was completely destroyed, all the villagers were killed and so were the village dogs. It is the wise old woman of the village who teaches young Sofia about the secrets in the fire. Within the flames hide all things past and all things yet to be. But not even old Muazena can see the horrors the fire holds for Sofia and her family -- not the murderous bandits who drive them from their home, and not the land mine that takes Sofia's legs.

Sofia encounters many challenges, like losing her sister Maria to the land mine, her mother Lydia's nasty new husband and going back and foward from her home town and family to the intimidating hospital.In her long journey toward recovery, Sofia must still deal with growing up. Along the way, she discovers friends, and foes, in places she'd never expected. Through it all, Sofia draws on a strength she never knew she had, a fire of her own that's been a secret all along.
