Learn about America's history through the eyes of John Adams and his family. Opportunity abounds for history and nature buffs alike at this Massachusetts park.

Adams National Historical Park is located in the City of Quincy, Norfolk County, Massachusetts, approximately ten miles south of Boston. The Park comprises 11 historic structures and a cultural landscape totaling almost 14 acres.

The story encompasses five generations of the Adams family (from 1720 to 1927) including two Presidents and First Ladies, three U.S. Ministers, historians, writers and family members who supported and contributed to the success of these public figures.

The site's main historic features include: John Adams Birthplace, where 2nd U.S. President John Adams was born on October 30, 1735, and less than 75 yards away the John Quincy Adams Birthplace where his son John Quincy Adams, 6th U.S. President was born on July 11, 1767; the "Old House," home to four generations of the Adams family; and the Stone Library containing more than 14,000 historic volumes and including the book collection of John Quincy Adams. No tour is complete without a visit to the United First Parish Church, where both Presidents and the First Ladies are entombed in the Adams family crypt. There is an off-site visitor center located within one mile of the historic structures.
