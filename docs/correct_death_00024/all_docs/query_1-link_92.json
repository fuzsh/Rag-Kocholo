        "text": "Sandra Christine Kessler (Troeger), affectionately known as Sandy to her friends and loved ones, passed away peacefully at the age of 79, surrounded by her family. Born on October 10, 1944, in Oakland, California, (or as we called her, an OG from the Oaktown).\n\nSandy spent her early years in South Bend, Indiana, where she graduated from John Adams High School. Continuing onto attend Indiana University, where she not only expanded her academic horizons but also met the love of her life, Ken Kessler. They met on a blind date and were enamored by each other’s smile, something that did not wane through the years. They married and embarked on a remarkable journey together that spanned nearly 58 years, filled with love, laughter, and mutual support. Together they lived in 7 states, several of them twice, including Indiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, California, Georgia, Ohio and Florida and shared their joy of travel with their children.\n\nFamily was the centerpiece of Sandy's world. A loving mother to her children: daughters Kelly Kessler, Kristin Ekanem Aldrich (married to Roy), and son Kevin Kessler. Her grandchildren, Briana Ekanem, Hailey Kessler, and Miya Kessler were the apples of her eye, and she cherished every moment spent with them. Sandy's unwavering support and presence at her children's and grandchildren's various sporting events.\n\nThroughout her life, Sandy was active in her community, whether undertaking the thankless job of class mom, donating her time to church youth group activities or managing the community pool. She worked at Hudsons and displayed her entrepreneurial spirit when she owned and operated a T-shirt business, and later assisted in her husband's recruiting business. Although her singing voice was less than melodious, she often belted out favorite songs, including ones she made up herself.\n\nSandy was preceeded in death by her infant son, Kendall Jon Kessler, Jr., her parents Andrew and Ellen Troeger, and brother John Troeger. Sandy's departure leaves a void in the hearts of those who knew her, but her legacy endures through the love she shared and the wisdom she imparted. Her intelligence and gentle guidance touched many lives, sparked many debates and her memory will continue to inspire those who were fortunate enough to have known her.\n\nSandra Christine Kessler's life was a testament to the power of love and the strength of family. She will be deeply missed, but the memories of her wry sense of humor, her laughter, and her unwavering spirit will remain with us forever.\n\nPrivate services will take place at Palmer Funeral Home – Welsheimer North Chapel with burial to follow at Highland Cemetery. Online condolences may be left for the family at www.palmerfuneralhomes.com.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, consider a donation in Sandy’s memory to the Alzheimer’s Association of Florida Gulf Coast at https://www.alz.org/flgulfcoast."
