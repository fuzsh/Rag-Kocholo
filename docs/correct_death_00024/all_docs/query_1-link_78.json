        "text": "Ever wondered about the man who shaped America's early government and met a dramatic end in a famous duel? Meet Alexander Hamilton, a key figure in U.S. history. Born in the Caribbean, he played a crucial role in the Constitutional Convention of 1787 and co-authored the influential Federalist papers.\n\nAs the first Secretary of the Treasury, Hamilton prepared the groundwork for the nation's financial system. His firm support for a strong central government set him apart, but his life ended tragically in a duel with Aaron Burr.\n\nAlexander Hamilton's Early life\n\nAlexander Hamilton had a difficult and laborious childhood. His father James Hamilton was the son of a Scottish laird. His mother, Rachel Fawcett Lavine, had a French father who was a doctor and a mother from England; she was a merchant’s wife when she started living with James. They met in 1752, and although Rachel’s husband initiated a process of divorce in 1752, he did not finalize it until 1758.\n\nRachel had to support Alexander and the brother of the husband James Hamilton who left the family in 1765. Rachel opened her business, a small shop, and young Alexander began to work at the age of 11. He worked as a clerk with two merchants from New York based on the island of St. Croix. Alexander was raised by his mother’s relatives after she died in the year 1768. By the year 1772, his efforts paid off, and got a promotion from being a bookkeeper to a manager.\n\nBelieving in Alexander’s capabilities, his friends enrolled him in a preparatory school in New Jersey. He was formally educated at the King’s College now known as Columbia University in New York in the autumn of 1773. Nevertheless, his education was cut short due to the rising voices against British colonization.\n\nHe supported the Boston Tea Party in public and between 1774 and 1775, he wrote key pamphlets endorsing the actions of the Continental Congress against the British policies. These were written by Hamilton and were published anonymously; these writings provided the foundation for his future contributions to the making of American history.\n\nAlexander Hamilton's Career\n\nAlexander Hamilton's career is proof of his intelligence and consistency. In 1781, he wrote to Congress and Robert Morris, the superintendent of finance, pointing out the government's financial and political weaknesses.\n\nAfter the war, he moved to Albany in November 1781, studied law, and was admitted to practice in July 1782. Shortly after, he was elected to the Continental Congress by the New York legislature.\n\nIn Congress from November 1782 to July 1783, Hamilton was a strong advocate for a powerful central government. He believed the Articles of Confederation were the cause of the country's problems. In 1783, he started practicing law in New York City.\n\nHe defended loyalists, those who had stayed faithful to Britain during the Revolution, in lawsuits under the Trespass Act. His efforts contributed to abolishing laws that disbarred loyalist lawyers and disfranchised loyalist voters.\n\nHamilton was elected to the lower house of the New York legislature in 1787. He also became a delegate to the Annapolis Convention in September 1786, where he pushed for a broader meeting to address national issues. This led to the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia in May 1787.\n\nAt this convention, Hamilton raised his voice for replacing the Articles of Confederation with a strong centralized government. He served on two key committees and presented his plan for a national government with unlimited power over the states. Although his plan wasn't adopted, it influenced the creation of the new Constitution.\n\nDespite opposition from other New York delegates, Hamilton signed the Constitution as an individual, knowing it was crucial for the nation's future. His career continued to be marked by his firm support for a strong federal government and his major contributions to shaping the United States.\n\nAlso read | Who Wrote the Constitution of the US?\n\nAwards and Achievements\n\nAlexander Hamilton played an important role in the American Revolution and the founding of the United States. Here are some key achievements of his career:\n\nMilitary Hero\n\nAt the start of the Revolutionary War, Hamilton joined the New York Provincial Artillery Company and quickly made a name for himself with his bravery and tactical skills.\n\nIn 1777, George Washington promoted Hamilton to lieutenant colonel of the Continental Army and made him his aide-de-camp.\n\nEager to return to battle, Hamilton left Washington’s staff in 1781 and commanded a battalion in the assault on Yorktown, which led to the surrender of British General Lord Charles Cornwallis and the end of the war.\n\nWork on the U.S. Constitution and the Federalist Papers\n\nHamilton believed the Articles of Confederation were to blame for the disunity among America's former colonies and advocated for a strong central government.\n\nIn 1787, the New York state legislature elected him as a delegate to the Constitutional Convention.\n\nAlthough he did not play a major role in drafting the Constitution, Hamilton was instrumental in its approval by writing 51 of the 85 essays \"The Federalist Papers.\"\n\nIn these essays, he outlined his ideas for a strong national economy, including the importance of a unified economic policy, tax revenue, and free trade among states.\n\nFirst Secretary of the Treasury\n\nAfter the U.S. Constitution was approved, George Washington appointed Hamilton the first Secretary of the Treasury.\n\nHamilton created the country’s first central bank, introduced tariffs on imported goods, and issued interest-bearing bonds to pay off government debt.\n\nHis financial policies were crucial in stabilizing the new nation’s economy, leading to the birth of Wall Street and U.S. stock markets.\n\nAlthough he stepped down in 1795, Hamilton continued to advise President Washington and influenced policies during John Adams's presidency.\n\nHamilton's career was marked by his dedication to a strong federal government and a robust economic system, laying the groundwork for the financial foundation of the United States.\n\nAlexander Hamilton’s Death\n\nAlexander Hamilton died tragically in a duel with Aaron Burr.\n\nBurr, wanting to revive his political career, challenged Hamilton to a duel.\n\nHamilton, unable to escape the duel due to political pressure, confronted Burr on July 11, 1804, in Weehawken, New Jersey.\n\nBoth fired shots .56 caliber dueling pistols. Burr remained unharmed; Hamilton was severely wounded and died the next day.\n\nThe duel had serious consequences for both men. Hamilton lost both his life and his honor. Burr was charged with two charges of murder and was never elected to government again. His political career ended, and he was eventually charged with treason.\n\nQuick Facts about Alexander Hamilton\n\nA decade and a half before their match, Aaron Burr talked Hamilton out of taking against James Monroe.\n\nHamilton and Burr collaborated as lawyers in the first-ever murder trial in American history.\n\nHamilton started a publication, which grew to become The New York Post.\n\nInformation Source: Britannica\n\nLibrary of Congress. \"Alexander Hamilton”\n\nQuotes by Alexander Hamilton\n\nThere can be no profit in the making or selling of things to be destroyed in war. Men may think that they have such profit, but in the end, the profit will turn out to be a loss.\n\nIn the general course of human nature, a power over a man’s subsistence amounts to a power over his will.\n\nWhy has government been instituted at all? Because the passions of men will not conform to the dictates of reason and justice, without constraint.\n\nHow can you trust people who are poor and own no property? ... Inequality of property will exist as long as liberty exists.\n\nThose who stand for nothing fall for anything."
