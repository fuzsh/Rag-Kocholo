        "text": "JOHN J. ADAMS; 71, Beloved son of the late Eva and John R. Adams; brother of Renee Dilley (Bill); former husband of Kathleen Adams; devoted and loving friend of many. John was born in Cleveland and attended St. Ignatius and Parma Senior High Schools. He began drumming at the age of nine and played the bass drum in the band. When he carried his drum into Cleveland Stadium in 1973, he could not have predicted the life changing commitment that would follow. When the Indians moved from Municipal Stadium, to what is now Progressive Field he took his place at the top of the left field bleachers. He loved polka music and gave off his time and energy to raise money for many non-profit agencies. In his hometown of Brecksville, he volunteered as a member of the community response team. John also taught aquatics classes for students with disabilities at Cleveland State University. His dedication to service was his driving force. Life is a journey, and we are each given special talents to assist us along the way. John will forever be the iconic drummer at the top of the bleachers. Many thanks to all who cared for John at the Cleveland Clinic and the nursing and rehab facilities he resided in. They went above and beyond their care for John. Special thanks to John’s neighbors who helped him in countless ways. We will miss our dear friend and will never stop hearing his drum beat in Cleveland. In lieu of flowers memorial contributions are suggested in John’s name to the John J. Adams Scholarship Fund c/o CONFIANCE, LLC, Advisor to Fund PO Box 770739 Cleveland, OH 44107 www.johnjadamsscholarship.org. Friends may call at the FERFOLIA FUNERAL HOME 356 W. AURORA RD.
