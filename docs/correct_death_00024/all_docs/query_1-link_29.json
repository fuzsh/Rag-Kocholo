        "text": "Patriot, Revolutionary & Statesman\n\nBorn in New York in 1745, John Jay was one of the framers of the Constitution, author of five of The Federalist Papers, and the first Chief Justice of the United States.\n\nA patriot devoted to public service, his achievements in virtually every branch and level of government are indeed noteworthy, both during the American Revolutionary War and following it.\n\nDuring the American Revolution, John Jay played a crucial role at home as a president of the wartime Continental Congress and abroad as a representative of the new republic.\n\nIn addition to Jay’s roles as statesman and diplomat, one of the more unheralded aspects of his public service was his involvement in counterintelligence during the Revolutionary War. Indeed, he is credited as having been the founder of counterintelligence in America. He also is credited with having saved the life of George Washington.\n\nInfluence at Home & Abroad\n\nHis foreign assignments included one in Spain where, in 1780, he lobbied for diplomatic recognition for the new United States, monetary support, and a trade treaty; and then Paris in 1783 where he joined John Adams and Benjamin Franklin in negotiating the Treaty of Paris to end the Revolutionary War. The following year, he served as Secretary of Foreign Affairs (the precursor to the position of Secretary of State) under the Articles of Confederation.\n\nAmerican Commissioners of the Preliminary Peace Agreement with Great Britain, Benjamin West, 1783. The United States delegation at the Treaty of Paris included John Jay, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Henry Laurens, and William Temple Franklin. The British commissioners refused to pose, and the picture was never finished.\n\nIn 1794, while Chief Justice, Jay traveled to Great Britain in order to settle contentious issues between the two countries that remained following the war. His efforts resulted in the “Jay Treaty,” which accomplished the important goal of averting a war with Britain. In later years, Jay co-authored the New York Constitution and was responsible for enacting legislation that phased out slavery in the state of New York.\n\nThe Birth of American Counterintelligence\n\nJay’s foray into counterintelligence began in 1776 when, at the age of thirty, he headed a New York State executive body called the Committee for Detecting and Defeating Conspiracies. The Committee's role, according to the resolution establishing it, was “inquiring into, detecting and defeating all conspiracies which may be formed ... against the liberties of America.”\n\nToday, the Committee for Detecting and Defeating Conspiracies is recognized as our nation’s first dedicated counterintelligence agency.\n\nSeptember 1776 New York state representatives resolution establishing the Committee for Detecting and Defeating Conspiracies, signed by John Jay.\n\nIn essence, its charter was not only to collect intelligence on the enemy but also to conduct counterintelligence activities. The Committee was comprised of carefully selected members of New York’s Provincial Congress who were sworn to secrecy and who had a company of militia under their command to execute the committee’s charter, which included making arrests, incarcerations, and deportations. Over the course of its existence, the Committee investigated more than 500 cases involving betrayal and sedition."
