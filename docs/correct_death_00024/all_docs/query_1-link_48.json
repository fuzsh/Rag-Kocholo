        "text": "John Adams: American Revolution\n\nIn 1765, John Adams was embroiled in the patriot movement for Independence from Britain. The British parliament passed the Stamp Act, which Adams virulently opposed that year. He wrote four articles voicing his opposition to the Stamp Act in the “Boston Gazette.” Adams argued that the Stamp Act violated the colonist's rights because they didn't have adequate representation in parliament. Without representation, parliament couldn't tax the colonists.\n\nBoston Massacre\n\nWhen a mob attacked, a British soldier guarded the King's money at a custom house. The soldier called for reinforcements, but the mob had grown by the time they arrived. The soldiers were attacked with cubs, ice, and snowballs before someone yelled fire. The soldiers fired their guns into the crowd, killing five and wounding six.\n\nThe soldiers believed they wouldn't receive a fair trial and were destined to be executed. Adams agreed to represent them; he even got jurists from outside of Boston to ensure a fair trial. Four of the six soldiers were found non-guilty. The other two were given a mark on their thumbs to show that this was a first-time offense and then allowed to leave.\n\nDid You Know . . .\n\nAdams' choice to defend the British soldiers was a very unpopular one. Many Americans believed that the men should've just been executed. Adams was a patriot and disagreed with the British taxation of the colonies, but he couldn't allow the men to have an unfair trial. Adams made the difficult choice to defend the British soldiers and uphold the values of the judicial system.\n\nThe Continental Congresses\n\nIn 1774 and 1775, Adams was one of the five delegates elected to represent the Massachusetts colony at the first and second Continental Congresses. He assisted his long-time friend, Thomas Jefferson, with drafting the Declaration of Independence. Adams also nominated George Washington as the Commander-In-Chief of the Continental Army.\n\nJohn Adams: Ambassador\n\nJohn Adams was a diplomat during the Revolutionary War. He assisted with American policies, but more importantly, he negotiated with foreign countries for their recognition of America as an independent nation. Adams also contributed to the Model Treaty of 1776, which laid the groundwork for America's foreign policy. America would conduct free trade with all countries but had no permanent allies.\n\nIn 1778, Adams arrived in France to negotiate a peace treaty, but Benjamin Franklin had already finished negotiations. Franklin's records were a mess, so Adams kept sorting them in France for one year. Adams returned to America and resumed his role as a politician.\n\nIn 1782, Adams was sent to the Netherlands to secure recognition of America. With the Treaty of Amity and Commerce, the Netherlands recognized America as independent and loaned the new country five million Dutch guilders.\n\nThe following year, John Adams was one of the negotiators for peace with Great Britain. The parties met in France, and the Treaty of Paris was named. Afterward, he became the United States Minister in Britain, where he remained with his family for several years.\n\nDutch Guilder\n\nNetherlands' currency from the 15th century until the early 2000s\n\nJohn Adams: Political Party\n\nGeorge Washington won the presidency, and Adams came in second, which made him the Vice President. As the first Vice President, Adams tried to use the power of the office to the best of his ability. Still, in the fledgling U.S. government, he found the position had little to no influence on any legal or political issues.\n\nMy country has in its wisdom contrived for me the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived.”\n\n- John Adams in a Letter to Abigail Adams in 1793.1\n\nWhen Washington retired, Adams ran for the presidency. Adams was a Federalist, and his opposing party, the Democratic-Republicans, was established by Jefferson. Their friendship had fallen apart, and the two men were on different political teams. Look at the chart below to see the differences between the two parties. Adams won the presidency, and Jefferson was his Vice President.\n\nDemocratic-Republicans Federalists Small, Decentralized Government Large, Strong GovernmentState Finances Should Be Separate From FederalUnion Should Assume State's Debt, National BankSupported FranceSupported Britain\n\nJohn Adams: Presidency\n\nAdams won the presidency, and Jefferson was his Vice President. Adams didn't accomplish the Federalist goals because of Democratic-Republican opposition. The French Revolution began during Washington's presidency but was the most severe threat during Adam's term. In 1798, Adams sent three ships to France to strike a peace agreement. French privateers attacked American merchants, and Adams didn't want to jeopardize trade with France. Each ship was turned away because the French wanted a bribe.\n\nAdams released a statement referring to the French diplomats as X, Y, and Z. Americans felt disrespected and wanted to go to war. Still, Adams didn't think America was ready for war. He passed the Aliens and Sedition Acts because he felt new Americans would support the Democratic-Republican party. He also built up the American navy. By 1800, the new navy was clearing the way for merchants.\n\nThis was called the \"XYZ Affair.\" While America never declared war on France, it did engage in the form of warfare. This event is referred to as a \"quasi-war.\"\n\nThe Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798:\n\nWith the United States in a quasi-war with France, Adams and the Federalist party felt that the open criticism of the Adams Administration regarding the war with France was “disloyal” to the United States as it struggled against a solid foreign power. In addition, there was a feeling that “aliens,” or people living in the United States who were not U.S. citizens, would align themselves with the French during the conflict.\n\nThe result was the passage of four laws, known as the Alien and Sedition Acts. These laws changed the residency time to become a citizen from 5 to 14 years and allowed the deportation of non-citizens. The Sedition Act criminalized “print, utter, or publish, any false, scandalous, or malicious writing” about the U.S. government.\n\nThe Sedition Act targeted the Democratic-Republicans, the opposition party to Adams Federalists. This targeted law only galvanized the already opposed political ideologies of the two parties, and the laws backfired on the Federalists, who lost the presidential election of 1800. 2\n\nAdams’ actions to negotiate for peace with France divided his party between his supporters and Alexander Hamilton's. This division influenced the political landscape leading up to the Election of 1800. With the Federalist party split, the Republicans nominated Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson won the election."
