        "text": "The Fourth of July is a special day in the history of the United States, mostly a day of celebration. But, in a strange twist of fate, two of the men who help found the nation died on July 4th, 1826, exactly 50 years from the adoption of the Declaration of Independence. John Adams and Thomas Jefferson died just five hours apart. But those two men aren't the only U.S. presidents who died on July 4th. Today's trivia question asks \"Who was the third president who died on July fourth?\" Was it James Madison, William Howard Taft, or Martin Van Buren?\n\nAnswer:\n\nMartin Van Buren died in July, but it was July 24th in 1862. William Howard Taft died on the same day of the year as another president, but it was Millard Fillmore, and the date was March eighth. Exactly five years after Thomas Jefferson and John Adams died, James Monroe, another founding father, died.\n\nJust five years after that, a fourth founding father, James Madison, died. But that was six days before July fourth. Thomas Jefferson was 83 and had been bedridden for a month when he also caught a fever on July 3, 1826 and died the following day. Nearly 560 miles away, John Adams lay dying. Five hours after Jefferson's death, Adams' famous last words were reportedly, \"Thomas Jefferson still survives\". President John Quincy Adams, struck by the death of his father and Thomas Jefferson on the same historic day, called the timing “visible and palpable remarks of divine favor.” James Monroe was suffering from tuberculosis when he died at the age of 73 on July 4, 1831."
