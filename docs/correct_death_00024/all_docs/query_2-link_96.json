In addition, the school’s administration can provide additional school and community resources.\n\nSchool officials didn't release additional details.\n\n\"There is nothing to suggest that there was anything suspicious or criminal in nature, but we will continue to work with the school district and the coroner's office throughout the process,\" said Ashley O'Chap, public information officer for South Bend Police Department."
