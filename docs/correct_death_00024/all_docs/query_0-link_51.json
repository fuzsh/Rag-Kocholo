        "text": "By PAUL C. NAGEL\n\nPublisher\n\nRead the Review\n\nYouth\n\nMy head is much too fickle, my thoughts are running after birds eggs, play, and trifles, till I get vexed with myself.\n\nOn October 25, 1764, in the parsonage at Weymouth, a coastal village in Massachusetts south of Boston, the local pastor solemnized the marriage of his daughter. Standing in the parlor, Abigail Smith, second child of the Reverend William Smith and Elizabeth Quincy Smith, took as husband John Adams, resident of nearby Braintree and a rising lawyer in the colony of Massachusetts Bay.\n\nThe couple's first child, born on July 14, 1765, was named Abigail, though the family always called her Nabby. Second in line was John Quincy Adams, born July 11, 1767. Until his college years, he was known as Johnny, and thereafter usually as John, despite occasional confusion with his father. To avoid this, as a youngster Johnny began signing himself as \"JQA,\" a practice that he continued through life and that his family often adopted.\n\nAfter Johnny's birth, other siblings soon followed. Another sister, Susanna, died in February 1770 after barely a year of life. Then Charles arrived on May 29, 1770, and Thomas Boylston Adams was born on September 15, 1772.\n\nThese Adams children had an ancestry remarkable even by New England standards. Although Johnny's grandfather Adams, known as Deacon John, had died before the boy was born, Grandmother Susanna Boylston Adams, a doughty woman who outlived a second husband, survived to be much admired by her grandson. As for his mother's parents, William and Elizabeth Smith, Johnny Adams recalled being so drawn to them that they became surrogate parents, and their parsonage in Weymouth his second home. William Smith was pastor in the village for forty-five years.\n\nJohnny found Weymouth particularly appealing because his mother's younger sister, Elizabeth Smith, lived there before her marriage to the Reverend John Shaw in 1777 took her to the parsonage in Haverhill, Massachusetts. No one was ever dearer to Johnny than Elizabeth Smith Shaw, with her loving nature and her reverence for literature. Aunt Elizabeth must have been much like her mother, Johnny's grandmother Smith, who was renowned for her charm and who died in 1775 while nursing victims of a cholera epidemic.\n\nAnother favorite spot for Johnny was the home of his Aunt and Uncle Cranch. Mary Smith, Abigail Adams' older sister, had married Richard Cranch, a gentle fellow who made a meager living repairing watches and farming but preferred devoting time to sharing the contents of books with the youngsters of the family. All his life, Johnny would remain close to his Cranch kinfolk. Cousin Billy Cranch, two years younger than Johnny, became a distinguished jurist in the District of Columbia.\n\nAmong the ancestors of these Adamses and Smiths were many of the notable names in New England history, a record that brought the family much satisfaction. Later in life, JQA often was asked about his genealogy and usually responded eagerly by repeating how the clan's founder, Henry Adams, had reached Massachusetts Bay in 1632 accompanied by a wife, eight sons ranging in age from six to twenty-five years, and a daughter who apparently never married. John liked to describe how these Adams immigrants spread the family name throughout New England and beyond.\n\nWhere Henry Adams came from in England has remained uncertain. His descendants eventually compromised by agreeing that he had emigrated from the town of Braintree in Essex County, embarking at Ipswich with the party led by the Reverend Thomas Hooker, who soon went on to help found Connecticut. Henry Adams settled his brood in the new Braintree, a long walk from Boston along the south shore.\n\nThe dubious claim that the Adams line arose in thirteenth-century Wales through Lord ap Adam and his wife, Elizabeth de Gournal, made little impression on John Quincy Adams. Instead, he preferred to point out that until his father's day, the descendants of Henry Adams had followed ordinary careers, doing the same thing in life generation after generation. From Henry Adams' arrival until 1735, when his great-great-grandson John Adams was born, family members had toiled as farmers and brewers, taking their turn as selectmen in town management. When Johnny's father entered Harvard College, only one Adams cousin had been there before him.\n\nLater in life, when JQA-being of a poetic bent-reflected upon his Adams ancestors, their stories reminded him of Thomas Gray's moving \"Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard,\" which admonishes that \"full many a flower is born to blush unseen.\" His Adams forebears, JQA said, were distinguished only for \"industry, sobriety, and integrity.\" They had been men of \"meek and quiet spirits\" who lived \"lives of humble labour,\" qualities that assuredly had skipped John Quincy Adams.\n\nAdams often wondered why he was unlike his \"meek and quiet\" forebears. He found the answer by reaching back to three marriages he believed had infused his line with the vigorous new blood needed to make him a different sort of Adams. The first such transfusion came when his great-grandfather Joseph Adams wed Hannah Bass. To JQA's satisfaction, her grandparents had been John Alden and Priscilla Mullins of Plymouth Colony, whose romance (\"Pray, speak for thyself, John!\") became one of New England's endearing legends. JQA liked to repeat the tale that Alden had been the first Mayflower passenger to leap upon Plymouth Rock.\n\nAfter the union of John and Priscilla Alden's granddaughter with an Adams, the next strengthening marital tie, according to JQA, was knit when his grandfather Deacon John Adams, a shoemaker and farmer, brought Susanna Boylston into the family. Susanna arrived from a line of distinguished medical men, her grandfather being Thomas Boylston, an eminent English surgeon who had immigrated to Massachusetts. Her uncle was the famed physician Zabdial Boylston, who introduced inoculation against smallpox into North America.\n\nSusanna Boylston Adams gave her son John, Johnny Adams' father, the seal of the Boylston family, which he adopted with pride, affixing it when he signed the two treaties of peace with Great Britain, November 30, 1782, and September 3, 1783. John passed the seal to JQA, who solemnly bequeathed it to his descendants.\n\nInvigorating though the Alden and Boylston ties seemed to be, JQA considered the marriage of his father to Abigail Smith the ultimate prize. He believed that she brought with her the blood of even more vigorous and able New Englanders. Abigail's father, the Reverend William Smith, was a Harvard graduate whose family had succeeded in business and shipping ever since the early days of the colony. The founder of the line in America, Thomas Smith, had judiciously married Susan Boylston, an earlier member of that family, thereby eventually making John Adams and Abigail Smith remotely related. These energetic Smiths spread down the Atlantic coast, so that JQA had a distant kinsman who served as an early governor of South Carolina.\n\nBut it was the Quincy family, from whom Abigail's mother sprang, that proved the connection in which JQA eventually took the greatest satisfaction. This renowned clan entered the Adams genealogy when Parson William Smith married Elizabeth Quincy in 1740. This union resulted in one of John Quincy Adams' proudest moments: when he inherited Mount Wollaston, the ancient Quincy estate on the seashore in Braintree.\n\nThe property was notorious even before Boston was founded, having been claimed around 1622 by Thomas Morton, adventurer and author, who called the place Merry Mount. It may have deserved its name, judging from rumors of the antics that went on there. Some of these reports were adapted by Nathaniel Hawthorne in one of his finest stories of Puritan life, \"The Maypole of Merry Mount,\" published in 1837 in his Twice-Told Tales.\n\nEventually the magistrates of Boston intervened, hoping to bring sobriety to Merry Mount by granting about 400 acres of it in 1635 to Edmund Quincy, who had immigrated to Massachusetts Bay with the Reverend John Cotton in 1633. Quincy renamed the farm Mount Wollaston. One of his most famous descendants, Colonel John Quincy, was Abigail Smith Adams' grandfather, and it was after him that she named her first son.\n\nThe colonel had married judiciously, choosing as spouse Elizabeth Norton, whose antecedents were as notable as his own. He served the Braintree community and the colony nobly. An authentic New Englander, he was remembered in the family, according to John Adams, as being \"remarkable for never praising any body. He did not often speak evil, but he seldom spoke well.\" In 1792, that part of Braintree known as the North Precinct, which included Mount Wollaston, became a separate town, named Quincy in honor of Colonel John Quincy.\n\nExcept for scars on the hillsides left by granite quarries, the town changed little during JQA's lifetime. As John Quincy Adams' grandson, the second Charles Francis Adams, remembered it in his Autobiography, Quincy was \"quiet, steady-going, rural,\" with a \"monotonous main thoroughfare and commonplace connecting streets, both thoroughfare and by-ways lined with wooden houses, wholly innocent of any attempts at architecture, and all painted white with window blinds of green.\" In the center were the meetinghouse and the town hall, as well as a tavern, fronted by huge elm trees, where stagecoaches stopped while winding their way on the coast road north to Boston or south to Plymouth.\n\nFollowing the road toward Plymouth for almost a mile, one came to the farmhouse where Johnny Adams was born. Those who visit it today as part of the Adams National Historic Site see a typical New England dwelling whose modest dimensions literally kept the family close. Johnny and his brothers had to sleep together; meanwhile, their mother Abigail wished she had even a tiny closet with a window where she could find privacy. All available space had to serve as John Adams' law office. The house sat amid a working farm of over a hundred acres. In an adjacent home, where John Adams himself had been born, his mother still resided.\n\nIn November 1772, when Johnny was five, John Adams began moving his family back and forth between Braintree and Boston (usually in the area called Court Street), trying to keep pace with his prospering legal practice. Until the early stirrings of the now-imminent Revolution and the formation of the Continental Congress, Johnny's father was frequently absent, traveling the judicial circuit in search of business. Thereafter, he was mostly away in Philadelphia as a leader in the Continental Congress while Abigail and the children removed back to Braintree.\n\nBy then, it was apparent that Johnny was a vigorous boy. Already there were signs of the temperament that would make life difficult for him as well as for others. His mother worried about how impatient he could be, how determined to have his way, and how sensitive he was to criticism. He clamored to tackle tasks that boys older than he might hesitate to accept. In part, this was because Johnny considered himself the man of the house during his father's long absences. Among the responsibilities he claimed before he was ten was riding horseback the several miles between Braintree and Boston in order to carry and fetch the mail. News of this accomplishment brought cherished commendation from his father for undertaking \"an office so useful to his Mamma and Pappa.\"\n\nJohn Adams had not been in Philadelphia a year when the opening of the American Revolution brought events that indelibly marked his son's memory. By 1775, Abigail and her children and their neighbors were living in fear that British soldiers might raid the area. A desperately worried John urged Abigail to flee with their brood to the woods at the first sign of danger. Instead, on June 17, 1775, the anticipated violence between colonists and English troops took place on the other side of Boston, at Charlestown, from whence sounds of cannon fire reached south to Braintree.\n\nHearing the commotion, Johnny and his mother climbed the rise called Penn's Hill, across the road from their farm, and from that high spot they watched the Battle of Bunker Hill-an experience the boy never forgot. The recollection was particularly poignant because one of those who fell in the battle was Dr. Joseph Warren, the Adams family's physician. Not long before, when Johnny had broken a forefinger so badly that amputation was feared, Dr. Warren had saved the finger. Later, JQA often considered how brief his diary and letters might have been if his writing hand had been maimed.\n\nThe struggle for American independence encouraged Johnny's parents in their inclination to impose the pursuit of moral and intellectual excellence upon their children. From the contrasts in the ways his father and mother respectively exerted that pressure, Johnny began to view them differently, a difference he maintained throughout a long lifetime. But then, Abigail and John Adams were scarcely alike in temperament and outlook.\n\nSince John Adams did his exhorting mostly while he was a participant in the Revolution, it was comparatively easy and sometimes even thrilling for Johnny to obey a male parent who was said to be a hero. This was the case even when John Adams showed how a Revolutionary leader could sometimes be unreasonable and short-tempered when playing the role of father.\n\nFrom youth onward, JQA usually got on well with his father, surprising as this may seem to anyone who has heard only of the public John Adams, the side history depicts. He is reputed to have been thin-skinned, bad-tempered, and impatient, a person even a son might avoid. (These qualities attributed to John, by the way, were remarkably like those later commonly associated with the mature JQA.) The private John Adams, however, tended to be quite otherwise. By his fireside or out working his fields, Johnny's father, while strict with his children, usually was affable and relaxed.\n\nThis allowed JQA to have it both ways in his regard for John Adams. He admired his parent's public career and revered his lofty principles, all of which made it comparatively easy to accept the father's stern decrees. Yet he could also embrace the warm-hearted, private John Adams as a kinsman and as a parent whom it was easy to love and to obey.\n\nCertainly, JQA always revered his remarkable mother, but his affection for Abigail Adams remained cool compared with that for his father. Years of togetherness in Europe would give John and John Quincy Adams the sort of male rapport that comes when father and son must get on without a wife or mother. This was one of the disadvantages Abigail faced in seeking to make Johnny a respectful and affectionate son.\n\nA person of high intelligence and sharp wit, Abigail made no effort to hide her condescending attitude toward males. At least in part, that attitude arose out of her mortification and dismay at the alarming fate of her only brother. William Smith, Jr. abandoned a wife and children to poverty while he lived among the fleshpots of Philadelphia, where he ended his life as an alcoholic. This tragedy took place as Abigail was rearing her own youngsters.\n\nConvinced that her brother might have been saved had he received a severe upbringing, Abigail vowed that no child of hers would come to maturity only casually disciplined. With John Adams so often away from home, Abigail's deep-seated anxiety about being a successful parent took command as she saw that her reputation and that of her children would rise or fall by her rigor in disciplining both herself and them. In short, Abigail sensed a double responsibility to pull and push Johnny and his siblings along the path of righteousness.\n\nHer sternness helps explain why Johnny spent so much time in the parsonage at Weymouth, where he was more comfortable with his grandparents Smith and Aunt Elizabeth. While Abigail was undoubtedly affectionate with her children, her lifelong severity toward them had a predictable result. This was surely the case with Johnny, who, from youth onward, would put personal independence uppermost among his goals while his mother continued to try aggressively to constrain him.\n\nNot that she lacked help from her husband in guiding Johnny and his sister and brothers toward virtue. She had their father's frequent letters to call upon. Along with his siblings, Johnny would gather at Abigail's side as she read aloud these paternal messages, which overflowed with admonition and concern. They were made to sound like sacred scripture, handed down by a father who, the children were reminded repeatedly, was risking his life for a soaring ideal: liberty. After all, as Abigail told them, were the British to catch their father as a participant in the Continental Congress, he would likely suffer as a traitor, a fate described vividly for the children.\n\nThus began Johnny's near-reverence for his father, whose views on righteous living can still be read on a granite stone honoring Henry Adams in the town burial ground. Upon it John Adams had inscribed his \"veneration of the piety, humility, simplicity, prudence, patience, temperance, frugality, industry, and perseverance\" that Henry Adams and other ancestors had demonstrated. It was an example John hoped he and his posterity would emulate.\n\nThe monument's pronouncement echoed the messages John sent home from Philadelphia. These letters from an admired parent did much to shape Johnny's evolving outlook. In one of them, John implored Abigail: \"Above all cares of this life let our ardent anxiety be to improve the minds and manners of our children. Let us teach them not only to do virtuously, but to excel.\"\n\nDespite his confidence in Abigail, John's anxiety about his eldest son soon led him to address messages directly to Johnny. These bore an overtone of warning-there were always reminders that the father waited to hear \"a good account\" of the son. This would be possible, John said, if Johnny fixed his \"attention upon great and glorious objects\" and tried to \"weed out every meanness\" in order to become \"great and manly.\" The father asked his son to join him in being the sworn enemy of \"injustice, ingratitude, cowardice, and falsehood.\"\n\nJohnny was urged to make scholarship \"the most ingenious and elegant entertainment of your life.\" Toward that end, John assigned a Latin sentence, challenging his son to be able \"when I come home to give me the construction of the line, and the parsing of every word of it.\" And when Johnny was not studying Latin, he was to read history. There was no better way to discover righteous behavior than to scrutinize the past, where so much evil abounded: \"Treachery, Perfidy, Cruelty, Hypocrisy, Avarice, etc. etc.\" If he learned this lesson, John predicted, Johnny was certain \"to become a wise and great man.\"\n\nLest Johnny not catch on that he was being schooled for an eminent career, his father became explicit. In a letter of August 11, 1777, John urged his ten-year-old son to prepare for a role in the wars, congresses, and negotiations certain to recur as the nation developed. He must be studious as a youth in order to take a turn at public service-\"the part which may be allotted you to act on the stage of life.\" The finest preparation, John announced, was to read Thucydides' History of the Peloponnesian War, and to do so in the original Greek, \"the most perfect of all human languages,\" which Johnny was told he must master.\n\nThe effect of John and Abigail's style of parenting shines through Johnny's childhood letters. As an obedient lad, he wrote stilted epistles designed to please his seniors, messages that probably told more about Abigail and John Adams than about their son. Indeed, little in his early letters to his absent father was even in his own words, for Abigail usually dictated his boyish screeds.\n\nThe first of Johnny's surviving letters, dating from 1773, was sent to Betsy Cranch, a young cousin, saluting her as \"Dear Cousing\"; this was Abigail's style, for she often put a g after an n, for example rendering Ben Franklin's name as \"Frankling.\" In a crude hand and with poor spelling, Johnny confessed to Betsy that too much of his time was spent in play, leaving \"a great deal of room for me to grow better.\" In writing to his father in October 1774 in Philadelphia, Johnny conceded that it was a challenge and said he feared he would \"make poor work of it.\" Nevertheless, he took pains to assure his father that he was seeking to \"grow a better boy\" so that his parent should never \"be ashamed of me.\"\n\nBy June 1777, young Adams' style might have improved, but the abject tone had increased, perhaps because an anxious Abigail was coaching him as he wrote. He spoke of being ashamed of himself. Why? Because \"My thoughts are running after birds eggs, play, and trifles.\" Lest his father be discouraged, Johnny explained that he hoped to grow better, thanks to \"the perusal of history.\" John Adams could not help but be cheered when his son soon announced: \"I am more satisfied with myself when I have applied part of my time to some useful employment than when I have idled it away about trifles and play.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Abigail took care to assure her husband that Johnny was composing his own letters-mostly. She did review them, she acknowledged, but insisted she offered merely correction. Soon, however, there emerged what was probably a more accurate version of how mother and son had collaborated. In a letter to Abigail dated August 11, 1778, sent while he was with his father in Europe, Johnny apologized for writing to her so briefly and infrequently, explaining that he was now relying upon his own resources-\"my Pappa being always a doing publick affaires or a writing to you cannot do it for me.\" Johnny then reminded his mother of how once he would \"teaze\" her to write his letters. Now, he asserted, \"I am obliged to think myself.\"\n\nThen, at age eleven, came a sudden necessity of doing for himself which prodded Johnny's talent. While he evidently was a youngster of superior abilities, these in themselves would hardly explain his eventual repute as a prodigy. He later acknowledged that his remarkable record before 1817 was due mainly to the good luck of having been caught up in John Adams' career when the father's role in world affairs was abruptly enlarged in 1778.\n\nUntil late in 1777, the folks in Braintree had assumed that John Adams was firmly fixed in Philadelphia, where the Continental Congress had recently named him to preside over the Board of War and Ordnance. This duty permitted him to be with his family only a bit of each year, and he often spent those times traveling around New England reviving his legal practice. This seemingly unending separation appeared to be the ultimate sacrifice the Revolution could ask of the closely knit Adamses-until an even greater one was suddenly required of them.\n\nIn December 1777, awaiting another brief visit by the father, the family received news that Congress had appointed him a commissioner, to join Benjamin Franklin and Arthur Lee in Paris to promote the American cause among the European powers. Word of this new assignment reached Braintree before John did, allowing Abigail to dream that she and perhaps her older children would accompany her spouse to France. But when John came home, he stressed mostly the danger, particularly to a female, of capture by the enemy on the high seas.\n\nCrestfallen, Abigail gave up her plan, leaving the field to Johnny, who begged to accompany his father. The advantages of such an experience being obvious, Abigail and other family members backed the boy's cause. Despite her misgivings, Abigail decided it was important that her son be with his father; Johnny, she believed, had reached the age when he stood, as she put it, \"most in need of the joint force of his [John's] example and precepts.\" Then there was the prediction of Johnny's tutor, cousin John Thaxter, that by going to Europe, young Adams would be \"laying the foundations of a great man.\" These arguments were persuasive-the eldest son would go abroad with his father.\n\nThey embarked on February 13, 1778, sailing in the twenty-four-gun Continental frigate Boston. Their departure was without fanfare, lest the British navy be alerted that a fine catch would be crossing the Atlantic. Father and son were quietly rowed out to the Boston from near Uncle Norton Quincy's house at Mount Wollaston. The seas were high, but throughout, as a much-gratified John Adams noted, his son \"behaves like a man.\"\n\nThe journey started calmly enough. Johnny was immediately captivated by a chance to learn the French language from a fellow passenger, Dr. Nicholas Noel, an obliging and well-educated surgeon in the French army. With this experience began JQA's fluency in French and also his enduring devotion to languages. His studiousness at sea persisted even after the ship sailed into peril brought by awesome storms and the vigilant British navy.\n\nThough the Boston was like a mouse pursued by several cats, she somehow managed to elude capture, only to find that weather was the more relentless foe. A storm smashed the frigate for three days in late February with a severity that left the most seasoned sailor impressed and both Adamses seasick. The father's journal contains a narrative of what they endured. \"To describe the ocean, the waves, the winds, the ship, her motions, rollings, wringings, and agonies-the sailors, their countenances, language, and behavior is impossible.\" Lightning struck three men on deck, killing one, while the wind carried away the Boston's main topmast. John Adams called the scene a \"universal wreck of everything in all parts of the ship, chests, casks, bottles, etc. No place or person was dry.\"\n\nThere was a cheering aspect to the upheaval, however. The proud parent could report that Johnny's deportment throughout the storm \"gave me a satisfaction that I cannot express-fully sensible of our danger, he was constantly endeavoring to bear up under it with a manly courage and patience.\" The ship's captain, too, must have been favorably impressed with the boy, for he took time during calmer weather to teach young Adams about the compass, navigation, and how to work the sails. The respite was brief, for the Boston soon was helpless again before wind and swell. \"How many dangers, distresses, and hairbreadth scapes have we seen?\" John marveled.\n\nA bit more than six weeks after leaving Massachusetts, the Boston reached the coast of France, and on April 1, 1778, Johnny and his father landed at Bordeaux. Arm in arm, the two walked about, gawking unabashedly at the sights. After shipboard fare, they could not speak too highly of the fine food served to them by a citizenry evidently pleased to be host to this emissary and his son.\n\nWhat made the greatest impression upon Johnny was his introduction in Bordeaux to the theater and the concert hall. In fact, on their first night in the city, the pair went to the opera, where the dancing and music afforded them, as John recorded, \"a very cheerful, sprightly amusement, having never seen anything of the kind before.\"\n\nOn April 4, they began the journey to Paris, reaching the city on the 8th, after pushing hard to cover a hundred miles a day. Once again, Johnny drew his parent's admiration: John recorded that \"my little son has sustained this long journey . . . with the utmost firmness, as he did our fatiguing and dangerous voyage.\" Upon arriving in Paris, the visitors, accustomed to the comparative quiet of Boston, were astonished to see streets packed with carriages, most of them bearing liveried servants. They also discovered that it was difficult to find suitable living quarters for rent in a crowded city.\n\nThis brought John to accept Benjamin Franklin's invitation to reside in his commodious quarters in Passy, a suburb at the city's edge, near the Bois de Boulogne. The father and son, however, would remain here for less than a year. John quickly realized that the American commission was so internally divided and corrupt as to be impotent and ludicrous in the French government's eyes. Neither was the Continental Congress favorably impressed. In September 1778 it disbanded the commission and recalled Johnny's father, a summons by then much desired by the disgusted senior Adams.\n\nWord of the recall did not arrive, however, before the son had had time in Paris for important intellectual and emotional development. To his great joy, at least according to an account by his father, Johnny was placed in a weekday boarding school soon after they had settled in Passy. The lad told his parent he found it inspiring to be off to classes where \"rewards were given to the best scholars.\" The school was run by a M. Le Coeur. Franklin's grandson Benjamin \"Benny\" Bache was enrolled there, as were several other American boys. In addition to an emphasis upon Latin and French, the school provided training in fencing, dancing, drawing, and music, subjects some New Englanders might have considered frivolous at best.\n\nIn one of his first letters from Paris, Johnny described the school's schedule by informing his \"Honoured Mother\" that classes began at 6 a.m., then proceeded for two hours, followed by a sixty-minute break for \"play\" and breakfast. Studies then resumed until noon, when another interval allowed time for dinner and more recreation. Then it was back to class from 2 to 4:30, more play for a half hour, and final classes from 5 to 7:30, when the students supped. Afterward there were games until it was time to retire, at 9 p.m.\n\nAlthough this scholarly rigor relented only on Sunday, Johnny claimed: \"I like it very well.\" So did his father, who was clearly astonished at the progress his son made in his studies, and particularly in mastering the French language. The senior Adams confessed to being \"mortified\" that the lad \"learned more French in a day than I could learn in a week with all my books.\" By August, he informed Abigail that her diligent son was \"in high reputation here.\"\n\nJohnny Adams had more than books on his mind, however. To folks at home, his letters seemed most at ease when they described the boundless cultural riches of Europe. Although he enjoyed the musical concerts, his favorite entertainment was the theater. His father also attended the theater, particularly performances of tragedies by Corneille, Racine, or Voltaire-and prodded his son to concentrate upon these.\n\nJohnny conceded that such productions had their share of music and dancing, but he had another preference. For the best of \"the language, the wit, the passions, the sentiments, the oratory, the poetry, the manners and morals,\" he contended that one must go to the French Comedy. This was the report the increasingly independent-minded Johnny sent off to his sister Nabby.\n\nThe two Adamses had arrived in Europe just as the theater was reclaiming prominence. Spurred by a revival of Shakespeare, whose work had a liberating influence, every major poet had begun writing plays. Neoclassicism gave way to Romanticism, and plays grew naturalistic and individualistic. Theaters had become larger; Drury Lane in London would soon seat thirty-six hundred. The names of prominent actors-Charles Kemble, Mrs. Sarah Siddons, Edmund Kean-would often appear in JQA's diary and letters. Caught up in the appeal of drama, he would be an enthusiastic patron of theater for the rest of his life-even in the United States, where productions during his time would be mostly poor European imports.\n\nRecognizing how smitten his son was by Europe's cultural charms, John had to caution him against any excessive display of enthusiasm in his letters home about the rewards of life in Paris. The young man occasionally took pains to advise the folks around Braintree that he \"would rather be amongst the rugged rocks of my own native town than in the gay city of Paris.\" Meanwhile, John himself assured his spouse that Johnny's \"behaviour does honour to his Mamma.\"\n\nAbigail, however, had not waited for the pair's first epistles before sending warnings about the worldly temptations that she pictured as luring young men such as her son into sinful ways. Consequently, the Boston had not been long at sea when Abigail sent Johnny a stern message: he must \"never disgrace his mother,\" and he must \"behave worthy of his father.\" In this way, she assured her son, he might acquire useful knowledge and virtue \"such as to render you an ornament to society, an honour to your country, and a blessing to your parents.\"\n\nShe went on to speak ominously of the \"inadvertency and heedlessness of youth,\" which led to her deepest concern. In an outburst that offers one of the most revealing glimpses of Abigail's chilling nature as a parent, she described the evil tugging at her young son and, doubtless recalling her brother's dissolute life, saw her own reputation as tied to Johnny's innocence. Abigail announced to her son: \"For dear as you are to me, I had much rather you should have found your grave in the ocean you have crossed, or any untimely death crop you in your infant years, rather than see you an immoral profligate or a graceless child.\" The son was ordered to view vice of any sort as hideous. \"You must keep a strict guard upon yourself, or the odious monster will soon lose its terror by becoming familiar to you.\"\n\nThanks no doubt to his father's guidance, Johnny tried in many ways by letter to reassure his mother. He was well aware of the \"vice and folly\" on all sides in Europe, he wrote, and \"I hope I shall never be tempted by them.\" Likewise, John Adams did his share to calm Abigail's fears. \"My little son gives me great pleasure,\" he reported, speaking of Johnny's \"assiduity to his books and his discreet behaviour.\" With generosity and tact, John added that this was because \"The lessons of his Mamma are a constant law to him.\"\n\nThere was a rising self-assurance in Johnny as he passed his eleventh birthday in July 1778. It was particularly evident when the boy took his father's side after the latter found himself a target in Abigail's letters. Having decided that the company of sophisticated Parisian women had made her husband indifferent toward her, she wrote letters sharply reproaching him. These accusations deeply troubled her son as he watched his father's patience give way to the point that he told his wife: \"Let me alone, and have my own way.\" If Johnny himself wished for greater freedom, he could not rebel so openly. Instead, he began defending his father by insisting to Abigail that her complaints were unfounded.\n\nIn a remarkable epistle of February 20, 1779, he rebuked his mother for disregarding letters from her husband. \"You complain as bad or worse than if he had not wrote at all,\" the indignant son said. \"It really hurts him to receive such letters.\" The draft copy of this message contained a threat JQA chose not to include in the version he mailed, so Abigail never knew her son had at first intended to say that \"if all your letters are like this, my Pappa will cease writing at all.\"\n\nFortunately, the marital furor could be put aside temporarily when John Adams' work as a commissioner was terminated by Congress. He and Johnny set out from Paris on March 8, 1779, hoping for a speedy journey to Massachusetts. Instead, for three months they lingered in such French ports as Nantes, Brest, and Saint-Nazaire as they vainly sought a ship to carry them to America. During this delay, they viewed what edifying sights the coastal towns offered, including a fascinating zoo. Father and son studied together the writings of Marcus Tullius Cicero, who became the historical figure JQA would most admire.\n\nThese weeks before sailing allowed John Adams more time to evaluate his son and to send another enthusiastic report to Abigail. He stressed how the boy \"is respected wherever he goes for his vigour and vivacity both of mind and body, for his constant good humour, and for his rapid progress in French, as well as for his general knowledge, which for his age is uncommon.\" The father called Johnny \"the comfort of my life\" and advised Abigail that he \"is much caressed wherever he goes\"-which was not the exaggeration it might seem, as the voyage home demonstrated.\n\nAfter finally departing, on June 17, 1779, in the French king's frigate, La Sensible, Johnny advanced his reputation by teaching English to two distinguished fellow passengers. These were the Chevalier Anne César de La Luzerne, France's new ambassador to the United States, and his secretary, François de Barbé-Marbois, who went on to an influential career in France and the United States. After three days, John Adams noted in his diary: \"The Chevalier de la Luzerne and M. Marbois are in raptures with my son.\"\n\nThe two men and their young teacher seemed always at work. The ambassador read aloud from Sir William Blackstone's inaugural lecture as professor of English law at Oxford University, with \"my son correcting the pronunciation of every word and syllable and letter,\" as John Adams recorded. \"The Ambassador said he was astonished at my son's knowledge, that he was a master of his own language like a professor.\" According to Marbois, Johnny \"shows us no mercy, and makes us no compliments.\" Nevertheless, the two French pupils said, \"We must have Mr. John.\"\n\nOn August 2, 1779, the Adamses arrived at Braintree for what proved a stay of barely three months. In October, to John Adams' mingled astonishment, chagrin, and delight, word arrived from Philadelphia that the Continental Congress had unanimously decided to return him to Paris, where, as America's minister plenipotentiary, he was to seek treaties of peace and commerce with Great Britain.\n\nJohn had narrowly escaped the censure Congress had laid upon his fellow commissioners. Suddenly finding himself a celebrated figure, the senior Adams prepared to return to Europe in November on the same French frigate that had recently brought him and his son home. This time, however, he intended that Johnny stay behind.\n\nWhile the son did not wish to sail with his parent, neither did he intend to remain at home. Deeming schooling received in France inappropriate for a career in the rising Republic, the twelve-year-old had returned home resolved to prepare for entry to Harvard. Since John Adams espoused the importance of a Harvard education (and also was mindful of the sizable financial cost of taking a son to Europe), he endorsed Johnny's wish to study in America-until Abigail Adams intervened.\n\nEven though she had feared that Paris would corrupt the lad and was thrilled by his safe return, Abigail believed that being accompanied by a son might have a wholesome effect on a husband she tended at times to mistrust. So she informed Johnny that he had more to gain than to lose from returning to Europe. Once Abigail had persuaded John of this, the son dutifully changed his mind-and promptly announced how he would mark this step: \"Pappa enjoins it upon me to keep a journal, or a diary, of the events that happen to me, and of objects that I see, and of characters that I converse with from day to day.\"\n\nThe danger in this undertaking, he confessed, was that someday he would have to read \"my childish nonsense.\" He could only hope that this future review would remind him \"of the several steps by which I shall have advanced, in taste, judgment, and knowledge.\" In fact, before he would return to America, his diary would depend heavily upon borrowed material, with many entries copied from travel books or from The Spectator and the current newspapers. This youthful practice reflected less Johnny's interest in the subject than an effort to improve his penmanship, a project insisted upon by his father.\n\nThe Adams party set sail aboard the Sensible on November 13, 1779. Accompanying them was nine-year-old Charles Adams, Johnny's next-younger brother, who embarked in a state of inconsolable sobbing. Charles would find living in Europe more than his \"sensitive\" nature could endure, so that after eighteen months he was shipped back to Braintree. Also traveling with the Adamses were cousin John Thaxter, Johnny's tutor at one time, and Francis Dana, a lawyer and former delegate to the Continental Congress. Thaxter came along as John Adams' private secretary and Dana as secretary to the peace commission.\n\nOn December 8, Johnny and his companions made landfall in Europe, but not where they expected to be. The Sensible had encountered heavy seas during much of the voyage, developing a leak that required all on board to take turns manning the pumps. So dangerous did the situation become that the captain put in for repairs at the first available port, which was El Ferrol, at the very northwestern tip of Spain. From there, the Adams group had no choice but to travel overland to Paris on what proved to include \"the worst three weeks that I ever passed in my life,\" as Johnny put it.\n\nThe journey began after a fortnight of gathering supplies and guides in El Ferrol and in the nearby town of La Coruña, a respite that allowed the opportunity for dining and attending the theater, and for John Adams to receive the respect of local officials. At one dinner, his son reported, more than fifty dishes were served, along with \"twenty different sorts of wine.\" After the meal, the young diarist admitted that he and brother Charles got lost while trying to find their lodging.\n\nIt was the last happy time for many days. The Adams party set out for France on December 26. Struggling eastward over the rugged mountains along Spain's north coast, the caravan fought debilitating illness and foul weather while trying for more than a month to cover twelve miles daily. The terrain was treacherous, the food wretched, and the shelter-in the travelers' opinion-unfit even for animals.\n\nThroughout the ordeal, Johnny managed a mostly cheerful style as he recorded the trip in his new journal. The journey began with some of the travelers astride mules and the rest, he wrote, in three battered carriages \"made in the year one.\" The group appeared to be \"so many Don Quixote's and Sancho Pancha's,\" and he pictured the inns as offering \"chambers in which anybody would think half a dozen hogs had lived there six months.\"\n\nMost of the rooms, he said, were as muddy inside as out, a plight which the group did not escape until January 15, 1780, when civilization reappeared at the port town of Bilbao. Here Johnny and his companions lingered, meeting captains of two ships from Boston who were trading with the prosperous firm of Joseph Gardoqui and Sons. The Gardoqui family entertained the Americans in princely fashion, sending them off in much improved spirits to Bayonne and then Bordeaux, where they arrived on January 29, and where they once again relished the food and theater. Here Johnny put aside his diary, not to resume it for six months.\n\nThe Adams party reached the familiar scenes of Paris on February 9, where they settled in the Hôtel de Valois. Along with his brother Charles, Johnny immediately entered a pension academy in the suburb of Passy operated by the Pechigny family, a school to which many Americans in Paris sent their children. Gaining an education was of course intended as the primary benefit for Johnny from this second visit to Europe. Besides the essential subjects of Latin and Greek, he studied geography, mathematics, drawing, and writing. John Adams preferred that his son save dancing and fencing for a later time.\n\nBoth the pupil and his father seemed pleased with what the school offered. Johnny, in fact, found himself a bit overwhelmed by the range of subjects and sought his father's advice about which ones merited most attention. Should he put emphasis on Cicero, on fractions, on learning Greek-on geography, or writing, or drawing? \"A young boy cannot apply himself to all those things and keep a remembrance of them all,\" he pointed out.\n\nIn reply, John Adams recommended concentrating on Greek and Latin. While he reminded his son that the most important of all topics was mathematics, the parent advised leaving this subject for their return to America. For now, let Johnny's full attention go to Virgil, Ovid, Horace, and Tully-and to improvement in penmanship, about which John was almost obsessive. \"I will not overlook one such heedless piece of work,\" he growled after seeing a sloppily written letter by the son. Regretting his own poor script, the father said he was determined to spare Johnny a similar handicap.\n\nAlthough the pupil complied obediently, he could not resist occasionally switching his attention to what would soon become one of his intellectual passions-the art of translation-as he took time to put the fables of La Fontaine into English. Then there was that other compelling diversion, attending the theater, which Johnny did whenever he could slip away from his books. One of these outings led to what he later at least half seriously called his first romance. \"The first woman I ever loved was an actress,\" he admitted years afterward to Louisa Catherine Adams, his wife. \"She belonged to a company of children who performed at the Bois de Boulogne near Passy.\"\n\nWhile JQA assured Louisa that he had not met the young woman, whose age he guessed at fourteen, he admitted: \"She remains upon my memory as the most lovely and delightful actress that I ever saw.\" Would that he could have told her \"how much I adored her.\" He said he had left Passy carrying dreams of her that lasted long after he returned to America.\n\nThese visions persisted even though, as JQA took care to tell his wife, he had learned before leaving Europe of the legendary loose morals of actresses. He therefore gave thanks to \"my stars and my stupidity\" that he had not approached his beloved. The narrow escape did have a great benefit, he claimed. It gave him the \"discretion\" needed to pass safely through a lifetime of enjoying the theater.\n\nNothing about Johnny's morals seemed to worry his father in 1780. Instead, it was the expense of his son's education that troubled John. \"My affections I fear got the better of my judgment\" in his decision to bring Johnny again to Europe, he wrote. But for Abigail, back in Massachusetts, her son's virtue remained the prime concern. Once again, she extended her maternal reach across the Atlantic by letters that charged Johnny to be vigilant against temptation and sin, to recognize the importance of never wasting time, and to be resolute about attaining self-control by overcoming self-love. \"If you could once feel how grateful to the heart of a parent the good conduct of a child is, you would never be the occasion of exciting any other sensation in the bosom of your ever affectionate mother.\"\n\nAbigail was soon pushing Johnny to \"let your ambition be engaged to become eminent.\" Besieged by these redundant admonitions, Johnny chose to reply only rarely. Instead, he became so caught up in his studies that his spare time went mostly to reports to his father on his scholarly progress, particularly after the Adamses moved to Holland in 1780. Convinced that the French foreign ministry was preventing him from seeking peace with Great Britain, John had decided to try his hand at persuading the Dutch government to recognize and support American independence. As a bonus, he was certain that opportunities for Johnny's education would be superior in Holland.\n\nConsequently, on July 27, 1780, John, his two sons, and their cousin John Thaxter set out for the Low Countries. That day Johnny chose to revive his diary, continuing it while he saw Brussels, Rotterdam, Leyden, The Hague, and Amsterdam. The journal was mostly a narrative of sights seen, persons met, and long quotations from travel guides. Distracted only by lessons in the Dutch language, Johnny kept the diary until September 30, when he and his brother became students in the famous Latin school in Amsterdam-where Johnny soon found himself miserable.\n\nThe academy's imperious rector saw no merit in the bright and hardworking American boy who could not speak Dutch, and humiliated him by placing him with elementary students. Johnny endured it as long as he could before reporting his version of the situation to his father-as, also, did the rector, who was shocked by young Adams' rebellious attitude. Immediately, John Adams withdrew his sons from the school, fuming at the \"littleness of soul\" exhibited by the academy.\n\nSoon afterward, fortunately, Johnny began one of his happiest intellectual experiences. Thanks to the suggestion of an Adams family acquaintance, Benjamin Waterhouse, who had come from Massachusetts to pursue a medical degree at the University of Leyden, Johnny and Charles were sent to study under Waterhouse's supervision, as well as that of John Thaxter.\n\nPromptly, thirteen-year-old Johnny became an independent student within Leyden University, taking lessons privately and attending lectures in what was then one of the world's finest centers of learning. Thaxter also resumed his own studies while he, Waterhouse, and the Adams boys lived in the same house. The setting suited Johnny perfectly as he studied zealously, undertook regular walks, attended church services twice on Sunday, and sought the company of interesting adults. His zeal was soon rewarded. Early in January 1781, he was formally admitted as a scholar in the university.\n\nIf anyone took more satisfaction from this development than young Adams, it was his father, who now forgot his alarm at the cost of bringing his son to Europe and urged him to capture every intellectual benefit afforded by residence in Leyden. \"You have now a prize in your hands, indeed,\" he told Johnny, so that if he did not improve rapidly, \"you will be without excuse.\" But John also knew how to encourage, assuring his son that if he maintained his thirst for knowledge and his capacity for work, \"you will do no dishonour to yourself nor to the University of Leyden.\"\n\nAbigail Adams' response to her son's opportunity was different. When she heard that Johnny and his father had transferred to Holland, Abigail laid on the boy a new challenge. He should seek to benefit from the \"universal neatness and cleanliness\" for which the Low Countries were famed. Let this influence \"cure you of all your slovenly tricks.\"\n\nThe son ignored the letter, concentrating instead on describing for his father the joys of life at the University of Leyden, all of which delighted the senior Adams, who longed to be studying alongside his son. Imprisoned by the tedium of diplomacy in Amsterdam, the father advised Johnny to attend lectures in medicine, chemistry, and philosophy, and to send him full reports. In addition, the young student was directed to note every feature of the university that might be advantageously adopted at Harvard. It was an assignment that Johnny welcomed, and he did not disappoint his father.\n\nWaterhouse and Thaxter kept John Adams informed about the remarkable diligence of his son. Indeed, during the spring of 1781, a cheerful Johnny was making such progress in Greek and Latin that his father feared he might be neglecting his own language. Consequently, John urged him to read the English poets, advising him that poetry was essential to happiness: \"You will never be alone with a poet in your pocket.\" To this Johnny replied: \"I have not read much of it, yet I always admired it very much.\"\n\nNot that the student invariably complied with his parent's directions. To the dismay of his father, Johnny resisted following his order to read the philippics of the great Athenian orator Demosthenes. The senior Adams could not understand this aversion. \"I absolutely insist upon it, that you begin upon Demosthenes.\"\n\nThis sort of rigorous supervision on his father's part may account, at least in part, for the son's hesitation about staying with his parent during the university's spring holiday in 1781. After reluctantly agreeing to visit, Johnny said he would remain in Amsterdam for only a fortnight, shrewdly explaining: \"If I should stay any longer, it might do harm to my studies, of which I have just got into a steady course.\"\n\nBarely had Johnny made this announcement when his devotion to scholarship faced more harm than might accompany any vacation with his father. That July he was uprooted from his student life in Leyden to accompany Francis Dana on a diplomatic mission to St. Petersburg, the capital of Russia. Valuable though the experience would prove in some ways, JQA always believed that the two-year interruption stunted his scholarly development. Years later, looking back over his youth in Europe, he complained that his education had been sadly informal, ill-organized, and disrupted. The result, he acknowledged, was that while he amassed a little information about many topics, he was never granted time enough to master one.\n\nIn 1781, Johnny could not appreciate that his future career would owe more to his ramblings across Europe than to any concentrated mound of knowledge he might have accumulated had he remained ensconced at the university."
