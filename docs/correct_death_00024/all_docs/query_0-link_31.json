        "text": "Welcome to United First Parish Church\n\nThe Church of the Presidents\n\nQuincy, Massachusetts, is proud to be distinguished as the birthplace lifetime home, and final resting place of the second and sixth Presidents of the United States, who each played crucial roles in securing our nation's independence and making our democracy strong. The tombs of John Adams and John Quincy Adams, alongside those of First Ladies Abigail Adams, and Louisa Catherine Adams, rest within the crypt at United First Parish Church, which was their place of family worship.\n\nThe Church of the Presidents is more than a home for its congregation. It is a centerpiece of the City. It is a symbol of our freedom. While the Church of the Presidents has a cooperative arrangement with the Adams National Historic Park to open the crypt and the church building to visitors, because we are an active congregation we receive no money whatsoever from the Federal Government.\n\nIn 2018, the Church and presidential crypts were visited by 10.950 visitors, including folks from all 50 states, Washington D.C., Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands and 42 countries around the world!\n\nWe first opened to visit by the public in 1976, the Bicentennial Year. Until that time visits to the crypts were by appointment only. The presidential crypts were originally sealed, and in 1903 the granite door was replaced by the current gate.\n\nEach year, the birthdays of each president are marked by a ceremonial wreath laying presented on behalf of the current sitting president. These ceremonies started 52 years ago during the presidency of Lyndon Johnson, with ten United States presidents having been represented at the ceremonies. The U.S. Navy serves as the official representative of the President and provides both an honor guard and musicians from the Navy band for the ceremonies each year.\n\nClick here to see John Quincy Adams wreath laying ceremony which took place on July 12, 2021.\n\nHISTORIC TOURS OF THE CHURCH AND CRYPT FROM APRIL 19 TO NOVEMBER 11 FOR THE 2024 TOUR SEASON.\n\nTour Times: Mondays - Saturdays: 11:00 am - 4:00 pm. Sundays: 12:00 pm - 4:00 pm.\n\nThere is no admission fee, but donations are welcome as the program is funded through the gifts of visitors. The suggested donation is $5.00 for adults and $4.00 for seniors and students. Children under 12 are free. No reservation is necessary, unless it is a larger group.\n\nWe are wheelchair accessible! We have a ramp and automatic door opening system that allows folks to safely enter our building. We have an elevator available for visitors to allow our differently-abled visitors to reach all levels of the building, including our crypts. We also have an ADA-accessible restroom available to all visitors. We have a wheelchair available for use on-site if you find yourself in need.\n\nFor those who aren't able to join us onsite, we invite you to view our virtual tour of the church and the crypt until you are able to join us in person once again.\n\nOperating the Visitor Program is a public service, and as such we ask our visitors to give a donation in support of the program rather than charging a formal admission fee. The generosity of our visitors has helped us to see Adams crypt is open to visitors and tourists from across the country and around the world for the last 41 years.\n\nTherefore, the Church of the Presidents is asking for your help with the maintenance and care of this historic treasure. The Adams and their generation pledged their lives and sacred honor so that we might enjoy independence and liberty today. Your tax-deductible contribution is important. We are a 501[c][3] tax-exempt organization and, in fact your gift may be eligible as a matching gift from your employer."
