        "text": "Join the National Park Service for a special guided tour that chronicles the lattermost days, deaths, and legacies of two Founding Fathers, whose words and actions continue to echo from their departure to our present day. Learn about the facts of a day that sometimes proves that truth is stranger than fiction and understand how a young nation handled the passing of its founding era. The guided tour will take visitors through the Old House at Peace field, where John Adams was living at the time of his death, and the Stone Library. This tour is 45 minutes in length and does NOT include the Adams Farm at Pennâ€™s Hill (the John Adams and John Quincy Adams Birthplaces). Self-guided tours of the Adams Farm at Penn's Hill are also available and do not require reservations."
