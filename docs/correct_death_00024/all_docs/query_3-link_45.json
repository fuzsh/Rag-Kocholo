        "text": "Independence Day: America’s birthday, the most terrifying 24 hours of the year for dogs, and the day that American presidents are most likely to kick the bucket.\n\nThat’s right. The Fourth of July has the strange distinction of being the day that three presidents died. Two of them—John Adams and Thomas Jefferson—passed just five hours apart in 1826. The third, James Monroe, died exactly five years later. The fact that the men were all founding fathers, and served as the second, third and fifth U.S. presidents makes the coincidence even more odd. (The fourth president, James Madison, died on June 28, 1836. Imagine if he’d held on for six days!)\n\nWhile Harry S. Truman and Gerald Ford both died on December 26 (in 1972 and 2006, respectively), and Millard Fillmore and William Howard Taft both died on March 8 (the former in 1874; the latter in 1930), the close cluster of July 4 deaths is definitely stranger. Especially given the historic importance of the day.\n\nThe first to go, Thomas Jefferson, was 83 at the time of his death and had been bedridden for a month with a variety of physical ailments. He caught a fever on July 3 and succumbed the next day, at 12:50pm at home in Monticello, Virginia. Meanwhile, 569 miles away in Quincy, Massachusetts, 90-year-old John Adams was also on his death bed. He died soon after his friend, entirely unaware of Jefferson’s passing. Adams’ oblivious last words were reportedly: “Thomas Jefferson still survives.” It was the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence.\n\nPresident John Quincy Adams, struck by his father and Thomas Jefferson dying not just on the same day, but on such a historic occasion, called the timing “visible and palpable remarks of divine favor.” Senator Daniel Webster agreed, remarking in a eulogy a month after Adams’ and Jefferson’s deaths that they were “proofs that our country and its benefactors are objects of His [God’s] care.”\n\nThough the timing of the three deaths remains surprising even today, creepy coincidences are something of a tradition when it comes to American presidents. One such example is that of Theodore Roosevelt’s wife and mother dying on the same day in 1884—on Valentine’s Day, no less.\n\nThe most infamous set of eerie parallels, however, can be drawn between the lives of Abraham Lincoln and John F. Kennedy. They include the following:\n\nBoth were elected to Congress in ’46 (granted, in different centuries).\n\nBoth became President in ’60.\n\nBoth lost sons while living in the White House. (Lincoln’s 11-year-old son William died of typhoid; Kennedy lost 2-day-old Patrick to infant respiratory distress syndrome.)\n\nBoth are remembered primarily for their work to advance civil rights.\n\nBoth were shot in the head on a Friday, while their wives were present.\n\nBoth were succeeded by Presidents named Johnson (Andrew and Lyndon B. respectively) who were born in ’08.\n\nBoth of their assassins were known by three names—John Wilkes Booth and Lee Harvey Oswald—comprised of 15 letters total.\n\nBoth murders involved theaters. (Booth shot Lincoln at Ford’s Theatre, Washington, D.C.; Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested at the Texas Theatre in Dallas directly following Kennedy’s murder.)\n\nHappy Independence Day, everyone! (And happy birthday to both Malia Obama and Calvin Coolidge—the only president to ever be born on the Fourth of July.)"
