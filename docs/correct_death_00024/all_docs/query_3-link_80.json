        "text": "Adams became a leader in the fight against British laws in the colonies. Still, as a lawyer, Adams defended British soldiers who had killed five colonists in the Boston Massacre of 1770. Adams believed that everyone’s legal rights should be protected.\n\nIn 1774 Massachusetts’s colonists elected Adams to the Continental Congress. There he asked George Washington to serve as commander of the Continental Army, the military force of the colonies during the American Revolution. He also chose Thomas Jefferson to write the Declaration of Independence.\n\nIn 1779 Adams served at the Massachusetts Constitutional Convention. He wrote the document that became the state’s constitution of 1780. Adams then joined Benjamin Franklin in Paris, France. There he helped to produce the Treaty of Paris, which ended the American Revolution.\n\nIn 1789 Adams finished second to Washington in the presidential election. Under the system of the time, Adams became vice president. Voters reelected the two men in 1792.\n\nPolitical parties began to form during Washington’s presidency. Adams and Alexander Hamilton led the Federalists, who supported a strong central government. They opposed the Democratic-Republicans, led by Jefferson, who wanted the states to have more power.\n\nAdams won a narrow victory over Jefferson in the election of 1796. Adams was not a popular president. He followed his own principles instead of others’ opinions. Adams even disagreed with other Federalists, notably Hamilton.\n\nDuring Adams’s presidency a dispute between the United States and France almost led to war. The French had expected the United States to support them in their war with Britain. The United States refused, and the French began seizing U.S. ships. Hamilton and others called for war with France. Adams, however, thought the United States was not ready for another war. Going against his party, he made peace with France.\n\nAdams faced more criticism for the passage of the Alien and Sedition Acts in 1798. Those harsh laws made it more difficult for new immigrants to stay in the country. They also punished critics of the government."
