They both died on the 50th Anniversary of America's Birthday on July 4, 1776. When Adams and Jefferson worked on The Declaration of Independence, they were risking their lives, reputations and fortunes since declaring independence from Great Britain was considered an act of treason punishable by death.\n\nThe Constitutional Walking Tour visits more than 20 of the most historic sites in the Independence National Historical Park area including the Declaration House where Thomas Jefferson wrote The Declaration of Independence, Signers' Walk which is the Founding Fathers Hall of Fame, Independence Hall which is where America was born, the President's House where Adams lived while serving as the President, the Liberty Bell and more, on a 75 minute walking journey through America's Birthplace.\n\nEven though we celebrate America's Birthday on July 4th, The Constitutional offers tours year round. Come see why we say that Every Day is Independence Day in America's Birthplace!"
