        "text": "John Adams, the second president of the United States, died on July 4, 1826, at the age of 90 in his home in Quincy, Massachusetts. His death coincided with the 50th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. He was laid to rest at United First Parish Church in Massachusetts. Interestingly, Adams’ death occurred on the same day as the death of his political rival, Thomas Jefferson, who was also a former president of the United States.\n\nAdams had been in declining health for some time before his death. He suffered from a variety of ailments, including heart problems, edema, and a hernia. Despite his poor health, Adams continued to correspond with friends and family members until the very end of his life.\n\nIn his last words, Adams reportedly said, “Thomas Jefferson survives,” not knowing that Jefferson had actually passed away a few hours earlier. These famous last words have been the subject of much speculation and interpretation over the years.\n\nAdams’ death was widely mourned, both in the United States and abroad. He was remembered as a statesman, a patriot, and a key figure in the founding of the United States. His legacy continues to be celebrated today, and he is often referred to as one of the most important figures in American history."
