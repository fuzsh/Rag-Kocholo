        "text": "QUINCY â€“ Some presidents were born here. Others dropped by for a visit.\n\nThe nation's second and sixth presidents, John Adams and John Quincy Adams, were born in houses on Franklin Street, back when the city was part of Braintree.\n\nThe nation's 41st president, George H.W. Bush, was born in a house at 173 Adams St. in Milton and lived there for a few months before his family moved to Connecticut. He returned in 1997 to dedicate a marker that still stands outside the house.\n\nAt least five other presidents have visited the city while in office, most of them paying tribute to their predecessors.\n\nThe first presidential visitor was James Monroe, the fifth president, in 1817. He came to pay a call on John Adams at his Peacefield home on Adams Street. A reception was held, with many Quincy residents in attendance.\n\nJohn Quincy Adams was Monroe's secretary of state.\n\nPresident Calvin Coolidge spent the summer of 1925 vacationing in the North Shore town of Swampscott. On July 15, 1925, the president and first lady Grace Coolidge cruised aboard the 275-foot presidential yacht Mayflower to Quincy, docking at the Fore River shipyard.\n\nCoolidge, who was the 30th U.S. president and a former Massachusetts governor, and his wife toured the Adams birthplaces,\n\n\"The president visited every room in both houses, shook hands with everybody,\" the Ledger reported.\n\nGrace Coolidge said it was the first time she and her husband had visited the birthplaces \"even though when we lived in Boston we we passed by here very often.\"\n\nThey then went to First Parish Church in Quincy Square to visit the crypt where the Adamses are buried with their wives before returning to the yacht for the trip back to Swampscott. Length of visit: 1 hour and 15 minutes.\n\nDuring their vacation, the Coolidges also took a cruise to Plymouth and stopped in Cohasset to visit Clarence Barron, the president of Dow Jones & Co.\n\nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt visited the city twice, stopping at the Adams birthplaces both times.\n\nHis first visit, on June 17, 1933, took place on his 105th day as president as the nation was in the depths of the Great Depression. His speech gave a boost to two of the city's major industries at the time: granite and shipbuilding.\n\nRoosevelt, who had been assistant Navy secretary during World War I, told a crowd estimated at 10,000 people that he had been to the city before, visiting the shipyard to watch ships being built.\n\n\"I look forward to seeing more ships being built in the next few months,\" he said.\n\nRoosevelt was given a granite vase by the Quincy Granite Manufacturers Association, whose members were hoping to persuade the president to use more granite in public works programs.\n\nRoosevelt returned to the city on a campaign swing in 1936, again making a speech at the Adams houses and stopping in front of city hall, where Claire Burgin, the 5-year-old daughter of Mayor Thomas Burgin, gave first lady Eleanor Roosevelt a bouquet of flowers.\n\nThousands lined the motorcade route hoping to get a glimpse of the president as he went past.\n\nThe reception wasn't totally friendly.\n\n\"Numerous Landon-Knox banners floated over the Braintree street (Washington Street) over which Roosevelt passed,\" the Ledger reported.\n\nLandon-Knox was the Republican presidential ticket of Kansas Gov. Alf Landon and Frank Knox, a newspaper publisher.\n\nAnd while Landon was defeated nationally in a landslide, he carried Quincy, Braintree and nearby towns.\n\nPresident Harry S. Truman stopped in Quincy during a whirlwind day of campaigning on Oct. 28, 1948. Truman spoke to an early-morning crowd from the steps of First Parish Church before taking a quick tour of the presidential crypt below.\n\n\"I have known about Quincy all my life,\" Truman told the crowd of about 10,000 people in the square. \"I've known it as the home of two great men,\" referring to the Adamses.\n\nAfter Truman finished speaking, a member of the presidential party introduced himself to the city's mayor.\n\n\"Charlie Ross, meet Charlie Ross,\" said the presidential press secretary to the mayor who shared the same name.\n\nWhen Truman left to visit Brockton, people lined the motorcade route through Quincy, Braintree, Weymouth and Abington. He also made campaign stops in Taunton, Fall River and Warren, Rhode Island, before boarding a train in Providence to take him to a major campaign event in New York that night.\n\nPresident William Howard Taft visited Quincy in 1912 when he was campaigning for reelection.\n\nPerhaps the most spectacular presidential visit to the area took place Aug. 1,1921, when President Warren G. Harding attended the closing of Plymouth's 300th birthday celebration.\n\nHarding arrived on the presidential yacht Mayflower, and rode in a long parade to Plymouth Rock, where he gave a speech. He later attended a performance of \"The Pilgrim Spirit,\" an outdoor historical drama that featured a cast of 1,000.\n\nAn estimated 100,000 people crammed into the town for the event."
