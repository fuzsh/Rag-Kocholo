        "text": "A look back at local, national and world events through Deseret News archives.\n\nOn July 4, 1776, the Declaration of Independence was adopted by delegates to the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia. Among those to sign the document were future presidents George Washington, John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, as well as Benjamin Franklin and Alexander Hamilton.\n\nOn July 4, 1826, 50 years to the day after the Declaration of Independence was adopted, Adams and Jefferson both died.\n\nWhile today is celebrated as Independence Day in America, key figures Adams and Jefferson died on the same day.\n\n“In life, no two men were more closely associated with the Declaration of Independence, and the birth of our nation that it precipitated, than Thomas Jefferson and John Adams,” read a Deseret News editorial in 2014. “In death, they are forever linked by the date on which both men passed away: July 4, 1826, the jubilee year of the miracle of 1776.”\n\n“July 4, 1826 — Remembering Thomas Jefferson and John Adams”\n\nAnother president, James Monroe, also died on July 4, in 1831, at age 73.\n\nThe fifth president of the United States did not sign the Declaration of Independence, but Monroe did serve in the Revolutionary War, and, in fact, was injured in the Battle of Trenton. He is still considered one of the Founding Father presidents.\n\nHere are some stories from Deseret News archives on these historic figures:\n\n“The Founders’ secret to finding happiness”\n\n“This week in history: Adams and Jefferson breathe their last”\n\n“‘Faithful’ Fathers? Beliefs of nation’s founders varied”\n\n“Thomas Jefferson”\n\nHere’s a fun story on how U.S. presidents have spent their July Fourths:\n\n“Presidents on July 4: Some chill, some get in your face”\n\nOn a related note: Hannibal Hamlin, who was the 15th vice president of the nation under President Abraham Lincoln, also died on July 4, in 1891.\n\nAnd, on July 4, 1872, Calvin Coolidge was born in Plymouth, Vermont. He became the nation’s 30th president."
