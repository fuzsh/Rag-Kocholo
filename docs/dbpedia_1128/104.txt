The Football Joke Book

We all like a giggle. Clive certainly does, so he had a whale of a time writing Wayland's new Football Joke Book. It's 96 pages of footie gags, stories, limericks and fun cartoons by Alan Rowe and some amazing but true football facts. So, if your computer has the bad-goalkeeper virus and can't save anything, why not cheer yourself up with some footy fun? Click on Football Joke Book to have a peek inside its pages.

Teenage Kicks

Do you feel your childhood years dragging by? Are you bored or fed up? Can't wait to be an adult? Whoooah! Enjoy the few years you have left with this great set of challenges to amuse, amaze, revulse and terrify.

From bogs and snogs to pants and rants, no part of everyday life is left untouched by the 100 plus challenges (we called it 101 but I've squeezed in more than 130 different things to do). Each is graded according to cost, effort and fear and feelgood factors and there are TK ranking points for each challenge which go to your final score. At a measly £5.99, this book could represent the most wonderful value for money any parent could ever wish for. Bookbag Download three sample TK Challenges including a Trolley Grand Prix for Free!

Lovereading Book of the Month An absolute must for every early teenager. Fun, interesting and useful the author has compiled a great list of things to be sure to do before those early care free days  the childish wonder of innocence  are over and before your entire attention span becomes taken up with worrying about the opposite sex.

Teenage Kicks is a barmy, brilliant and hilarious odyssey of a book where the point is to build up a TK score by completing 101 things to do before youre 16. And given the list takes in everything from a shopping trolley grand prix, to the best custard pie, and from seeing the sunset on Macchu Picchu to learning to juggle, there really is something for teenagers (and adults who still think they are) everywhere.

And it isnt all about fun, either. Giffords social conscience is also firmly in place, with energy-saving, tree-planting, recycling and helping the aged all making appearances. And, for awkward teenagers across the nation, first kisses and getting over that teenage crush are also accounted for.

Teenage Kicks is the perfect companion to any bored teenager, and is just as fun, interesting and entertaining for the rest of society as well. Youth wasted on the young? Not anymore!  Gavin Gerlach, International Writing Magazine.

The Spinechiller Collection - Eaglemoss

Clive writes: "I've always enjoyed reshaping and retelling adult stories in a form younger readers can enjoy. Working directly with the magazine's Editor-in-Chief, Jenny Curran, I condensed and rewrote such classics' as Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, Poe's The Pit and the Pendulum and the Bram Stoker classic, Dracula which were serialised over a number of issues."

The Water Puppets - Hodder Wayland

Clive Gifford, The Water Puppets: A Story from the War in Vietnam. Hodder Wayland, 2002

Clive writes: "Frequently only told from the side of the foreign troops stationed there, I really wanted to look at the conflict and how it impacted on ordinary Vietnamese people. By giving the family no direct role in the conflict, but including them in a subplot featuring proponents of the many sides, I sought to get across the sheer complexity of the war and the many varying arguments and views held within the country during the war. Building an arresting adventure plot was imperative as was weaving in factual events around fictional characters. I hope the eventual book is both entertaining and illuminating."

"A taut, gripping and surprising story, confidently written."
