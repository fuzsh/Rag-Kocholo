        "text": "So one day my mate Craig Smith phones up and says something like, \"Why didn't we ever get that band together when we had the chance?\" And I say something like, \"Don't know. A shame, really.\" And he says, \"Yeah. Well, why don't we do it now?\" And because I can't think of a logical response to his question (there are dozens of logical responses to his question - I just can't think of one immediately), I say, \"OK, let's do it.\" And by the time I put down the phone I am the singer-songwriter of a two-man band, one being a perfectly respectable web manager who wears glasses to read, the other being a 44-year-old poet and father. Two hours later, having sobered up, I call him back and hint at some of the obstacles that would appear to stand between our new band and rock'n'roll mega-stardom. Like the fact that we live 223 miles apart. But Craig has an answer to every possible problem, and because I am already smitten by his fantasy, I am inclined to believe every word he says.\n\nHe makes some valid points. Twenty years ago, he recalls, we sat in a ground-floor bedsit in East Didsbury in front of a three-bar fire with duvets over our shoulders (separate duvets, that is) and a plate of toast between us, trying to write songs on a battered old guitar and record them on a battered old cassette player. We were two students from mild-mannered villages in West Yorkshire; I was a trainee probation officer and he was a trainee librarian - not exactly ideal material for the first chapter of a rock autobiography. Back then, to make any progress would have meant putting together a decent demo tape, getting signed to a label and releasing a record. But we had no money, no instruments worth owning, no contacts and no particular talent. Given that all the bands we admired the most had overcome all those difficulties and more, it's possible to speculate that we had no desire, either. From where we stood, it was like staring at the north face of Everest with nothing more than a stepladder and a ball of string.\n\nTo a certain extent, the same was true of poetry. In Huddersfield in the mid-80s, there was one very modest bookshop with an even more modest poetry section. I'd read or bought all their poetry books in a single summer, and ordering more was time-consuming and pricey. The public library had its own eccentric and eclectic collection, but never the collections I wanted to read, and quite frankly it was quicker to publish a volume of poems than fill out an inter-library loan form and wait for the books to arrive. Beyond that, it was either a case of blagging entry into the polytechnic library or making an expensive trip to Leeds or Manchester. These days, it's hard to imagine life without complete and instant access to everything. Some of my younger students at Manchester Met have grown up with the idea that, if it doesn't appear in the first 10 entries of Google, it doesn't exist. The internet is where they get their information and how they share their ideas. The Craig Smith theory says it's also where they get their music. And, accordingly, it's where they're going to get ours.\n\nThe most important decision for any band to make is its name. It defines the whole direction of the project. Maybe to the outsider it doesn't matter at all, otherwise how would acts with crap names such as Bat For Lashes or Steely Dan or Clap Your Hands Say Yeah or even U2 have found success? But to the band itself the name is everything. And you would be forgiven for thinking that, with the whole of the dictionary to choose from, finding the right name would be a straightforward task. But almost every word or combination of words carries unwanted luggage. It's too indie-pop (the Wheelybins) or it's too derivative (Dragnet). Or too 80s (the Cagoules), too easily mispronounced (the Xoanons), too easily misunderstood (What's New on the High Street?), too self-conscious (the Autodidacts), too self-deprecating (the Has-Beens), too disingenuously self-deprecating (the Late Lamented), too 70s (Trespass), too heavy (Troopcarrier), too capricious (Fond), too northern (Pork Pie), too camp (the Shamefaced Sparrows), too much like a brand of rolling tobacco (Hobson's Choice), too playground (the Wagon Wheels), too hostage-to-fortune (Royal And Ancient - which one are you, then?), etc.\n\nWe're absolutely determined not to choose anything literary or anything that makes promises we can't live up to, hence Jude the Obscure and Pepperspray are vetoed at an early stage. Every time we do find what we think is a decent name, it turns out that it already belongs to a neo-punk band from Ohio who, even if they haven't released any records as yet, have a swanky website, have patented the brand and registered their trademark, and own the domain name. Part of me thinks that we should say sod it and go our own way; if the universe wants us, it can come and find us. But the Craig Smith theory says otherwise, and it speaks the truth. Arctic Monkeys may not be the best band name ever, but the incongruous coupling of those two words ensures that any half-decent search engine will pinpoint the required target within a fraction of a second. Call yourself Fishfingers, on the other hand, and by the time would-be listeners have waded through details of Tesco's latest frozen food offers or the innumerable web pages dedicated to the seafaring and decidedly dubious grey-bearded loon Captain Birdseye, they will have abandoned the search. After two weeks of giddy emailing and misspelled text-messaging, we narrow it down to a mere 280, from which we agree on a final shortlist.\n\nIn the end , we become the Scaremongers. When I say to people, \"We've decided on a band name\" and they say, \"Oh yeah, what is it?\" and I say, \"The Scaremongers\" they say, \"Yeah, that works\" or they nod appreciatively. Which is a good sign. It satisfies my desire for a definite article, contains a nodding reference to our beloved Orange Juice, and is appropriate to the project in the sense that at this stage we are little more than an alarmist rumour. Having said that, we have already gathered quite an entourage, including a bass player, a lead guitarist, a harmonica player-cum-video director, a Bez (my mate Slug, the world's coolest dancer), a critic (my mate Slug, who has cast an eye across the proposed lyrics for one song and declared that \"bed\" and \"shed\" are rubbish rhymes), a distributor (my mate Tony at his online music store, Vinyl Tap), a photographer (Slug again, in a pub in Streatham one night with his camera) and an in-house artist, along with a label name: Corporation Pop. Genius, except that no one outside West Yorkshire seems to know that Corporation Pop is a euphemism for water. We have not played a single note in anger, yet we are already in danger of becoming \"a collective\". My dad, somehow, has also got wind of the proposed band.\n\n\"Got a name, yet? How about Midlife Crisis?\"\n\nFor a moment, I'm almost tempted.\n\nHere's how the whole thing will work. Craig will write the music. From his studio (ie, back bedroom) he will also sequence the percussion, record guide tracks for guitars, download and mix in the Continental organ, orchestrate the composition, set up a website, oversee the design of an image, upload photographs and text, conscript session musicians, liaise with the studio, drive up to Huddersfield to practise, devise a business strategy, provide instruments and take care of all the other unforeseen issues that undoubtedly lie ahead of us. For my part, I will sing the songs. As a division of labour it might appear unfair, but as an acknowledgment of our particular talents, it is completely appropriate. I will also, being a writer, write the lyrics, though when the songs arrive, it's no surprise that some of his dummy or \"sacrificial\" lyrics are good enough to keep. I think of Craig as a schoolfriend, though we actually met at the now legendary (as far as we're concerned) poetry-writing workshops at Huddersfield Poly, so he's no mug with the alphabet, and his last book of poems, A Quick Word With A Rock And Roll Late Starter, suddenly seems decidedly prophetic. Most things in Huddersfield have been demolished and redeveloped since we first met - most things, that is, apart from the Merrie England coffee houses where we sat and wrote poems together. Not exactly City Lights bookshop, but the only place in town where we could scribble and talk and stay warm without being moved on or having to spend money. Occasionally, one of the Merrie Maids, in their scarlet aprons and sensible shoes, would lift up our books or papers and wipe the table with a damp cloth, but other than that we were left alone. I don't pretend to understand how Craig builds up the songs on his laptop. Actually, that's a lie: I do pretend to understand. When he tells me what he's going to do and how he's going to do it, I reply, \"Yes, that's probably a good idea\" or I say, \"I think that's exactly what needs to happen.\" After a few weeks we have a couple of tunes on a CD, and it's my turn to start on the lyrics. The first drafts are way too convoluted, more like bad poems than anything else. If writing poems is like building up a papier-mache or matchstick model, layer by careful layer, piece by precarious piece, then the process of lyric writing, for me anyway, is more like whittling a piece of wood, stripping and slicing away until something clear and smooth comes into view. We're thinking, in old-fashioned terms, of a double A-side. One song, Nodding Dog, will tell the story of a reluctant bridegroom. The other, You Can Do Nothing Wrong (In My Eyes) is almost a love song - two people list each other's faults before confessing their unconditional, eternal and involuntary devotion to each other. It's revved-up pop, driven on by an irresistible dance rhythm and floating harmonies. It's also a duet, with one part for a man and another for a female voice.\n\nCraig: \"Do you know anyone who can sing?\"\n\nMe: \"Not really. Oh, wait a minute.\"\n\nMy wife, Sue, is in the garden repotting a begonia when I make the suggestion, and she hesitates for at least one millisecond before saying yes. She was once in a folk-rock band with the rather fantastic name of Sue and the Speedy Bears, and is still in possession of a Speedy Bears business card, complete with a spaced-out polar bear wearing a cool pair of oversized sunglasses. A few evenings later, with our daughter in bed and a few drinks inside us, we decide to give it a go. On top of the false Victorian fireplace the iPod pumps out the laptop-assembled, instrumental version of You Can Do Nothing Wrong (In My Eyes). And face to face, with one hand each on a trembling lyric sheet, we sing.\n\nDid you ever sing in front of your loved one? It's a little bit like undressing together for the first time. Perfectly appropriate, of course, and completely acceptable, not to mention absolutely necessary. But a little bit embarrassing, nevertheless, and executed with a certain degree of awkwardness. We've been together now for umpteen years but, apart from the odd nursery rhyme sung on request, I don't believe we have ever exposed to each other the nakedness of our voices. To extend the nudity metaphor, though, the self-consciousness lasts for only the first couple of run-throughs, after which it all becomes quite exciting. A little bit fruity, even. Is this why John couldn't resist making Yoko an honorary Beatle, or the reason Paul offered Linda a tambourine? Is the hormonal frisson generated by vocal harmonics the explanation to the musical conundrum that was Peters & Lee? After an hour or so, I don't even care what the neighbours might think if they hear, or if they see. We are Mr and Mrs Armitage, singing to each other in the middle of the living room in the early evening, and we haven't even drawn the curtains.\n\nAre the Scaremongers the only band ever to take a packed lunch into the studio? Craig stays over the night before, and in the morning we're up early, buttering bread and choosing items from the fruit bowl. It's not just because we're thinking of our stomachs; hiring a recording studio isn't cheap, even in Huddersfield, and with the meter running all the time, we don't want to be standing in a sandwich shop for half an hour waiting for a bacon butty. Before we go, and for reasons I can't quite explain, I do two things that are completely out of character: I apply moisturising cream and I wear a hat. Then we set off, not exactly an entourage of coolness and credibility (me in a family saloon with a booster seat in the back, Craig in a rented Nissan Micra), but a cameo of excitement and anticipation.\n\nThe studio is a single-storey, brick-built, windowless building on the edge of a trading estate, just inside the ring road. It also borders Huddersfield's red-light area, which means that surrounding pavements are littered with the discarded wrappings of sex and the discharged instruments of heroin abuse. Inside, the dark and airless building is divided into three sections. The central part is the largest, the \"cubicle\", housing all the computers, all the screens, all the desks and all the consoles with all their sliders, knobs and buttons. Through the glass, at the far end, is the recording studio itself, including a separate voice booth, inside which stands an enormous microphone. To the unconfident singer, this mean-looking device appears capable of magnifying every vocal imperfection and amplifying it a hundredfold. Nearest to the entrance, the reception area contains a small bathroom, a small kitchenette and a comfy settee.\n\nOn the wall are framed photographs of other bands who have recorded here, including a colour picture of Embrace. Embrace are Huddersfield's only true rock'n'roll success story (or Bradford's, or Halifax's, depending on where you position the small West Yorkshire town of Bailiff Bridge, and whether you want to claim Embrace as your own or deny any association with them). Even Noel Gallagher couldn't derail their journey towards the upper reaches of the album charts. At a time when every syllable that came out of the Oasis camp was front-page news, he was asked to comment on the up-and-coming, bubbling-under, tipped-for-the-top, next-big-thing Embrace. Fixing lead singer Danny McNamara in his sights, Gallagher is reported to have replied, \"That cunt wants singing lessons.\" Despite which, they made it. Sort of. I once sat next to Embrace on a late train from London back to Leeds. Standard class. It would have been nice to chat to them and to have paid them a few genuine compliments, but the phrase, \"Excuse me, are you Embrace?\" seemed grammatically imprecise, and in the hour that followed I couldn't decide on the correct syntactical formulation to open the conversation.\n\nJason, the studio engineer, doesn't know if we are two middle-aged men with more imagination than sense, trying to live out the rock'n'roll daydream of our youth (we are) or two guys trying to make a good record (we are), and without ever addressing the issue directly we reach a kind of negotiated settlement in which our ambitions and our limitations might be comfortably accommodated. Craig impresses Jason with his knowledge of early synthesisers and computerised recording systems (yawn), while I excel at coffee-making with a space-age kettle. Craig's bass-playing brother, Glen, lends a bit of glamour to the project by turning up in a big Jag, accompanied by lead guitar-playing Geoff \"Birdman\" Bird, whose grungy, chin-length hair is a welcome contrast to our regulation crops and our flecks of grey.\n\nBeing in a recording studio is boring. Especially if you're the singer. Hours pass and barely a note is struck. Whole days slide by with nothing to listen to except strings being tuned and amps being tweaked and guitar licks being repeated over and over again. Then, suddenly, and without any particular warning or special preparation, you're ushered into the glass closet, the door is closed behind you, a green light flashes and you're on. Speedy Sue (of Sue and the Speedy Bears fame) pops up to sing her bit; she's done it before, so she's in and out in no time. Like someone nipping in and out of the changing room in Monsoon during her lunch break to try on a dress. I, on the other hand, am not so quick. Maybe it's the headphones I'm having to wear; under normal circumstances I can hear what I'm singing because the sound of my voice travels directly into my ear. But this is like being partially deaf, trying to work out not only how loud I'm singing but also what key I'm singing in by the vibration of the bones in my cheeks and jaw. Or maybe I'm just useless. My first take is terrible. My second take is worse. My third take is timid. My fourth take is met with silence from the cubicle. Through the glass I can see them all talking, but I can't tell what they're saying. \"OK, ready to try again?\" Craig asks after a few minutes. Eventually I get the thumbs-up and am allowed to leave the aquarium and return to the mixing desk. When I hear the playback, I immediately blush. They say that when you hear a recording of your own singing it's uncomfortable, because it sounds like somebody else. But this is uncomfortable for a different reason: it sounds like me.\n\nAt the end of two days of cutting and pasting, compressing and extending, turning things up or down and fading things in and out, we take a CD of the two songs into the reception area and flop out on the comfy settee and play it back on the cheap hi-fi. The implication is that this is what it will sound like to Our Fans. Then we troop back into the cubicle, and after a few more minutes of flickering lights and whirring motors, the trays of a dozen CD-burners spontaneously open, ejecting 12 shiny discs. These are ours. To keep. To do with what we will. We pay up - in cash. It's a great record. Obviously. OK, it isn't great, but it is good. Well, I'm kind of biased, but the same people who thought the Scaremongers was a good name think that You Can Do Nothing Wrong (In My Eyes) c/w Nodding Dog is a good record. And if it was rubbish, they'd say so. Wouldn't they? They're not sycophants. They're not the Sycophants to the Scaremongers, are they? What people think matters to us - like everybody on the planet, we'd rather be loved than despised and, given the choice, would prefer not to be thought of as a pair of idiots. But in the end, it's about different and better things. One: friendship. Two: getting off our backsides and doing something instead of just blabbing about it. Three: being in a band and making a record - we can die happily now. And four: driving home one night with the iPod on shuffle mode and wired through the car stereo, when the first few bars of Nodding Dog erupt in the speakers. Saying to myself, I know who this is. This is the Scaremongers. This is us.\n\nWe've printed a few hundred CDs. We're going to give them away, maybe flog a few. We're going to record about a dozen songs, and put them all on one disc, and call it an album. Apart from that, we're not sure. In true Spinal Tap style, Craig orders a T-shirt with the Scaremongers logo on it, but gets the dimensions wrong. It is, to all intent and purposes, a white T-shirt with a postage stamp on the chest. The same happens with the business card, which comes back from the printers exactly half the size of a regular business card with the words \"The Scaremongers\" amputated from the waist down.\n\n\"It's kind of enigmatic,\" says Slug. It's Craig's birthday and we're sitting in his kitchen drinking a bottle of sparkling wine from coffee-stained mugs. \"By the way, that rhyme: dead and shed. It's rubbish.\"\n\nIf we do ever get round to recording a full album, I want to call it And Charlie Got Something He Liked Too. Craig doesn't. Are we splitting up already? In the same conversation, the subject of playing live rears its ugly head. I say that we need to think about it very carefully, that we would need months of rehearsal, that it isn't something we should rush into, and that there could be nothing worse than standing on stage in front of a live audience sounding like a prat, looking like a plank and feeling like a prick. But the prevailing opinion emanating from the other corners of the table is this: that it doesn't matter if you've made one single or a dozen platinum-selling albums, because until you've played live, you haven't even come close. In other words, you're not really a band until after your first gig.\n\nA month or so later, I'm on the internet searching for Woods' Music Shop. If you live in Huddersfield and you want an instrument, you go to Woods'. That's how it works. Everyone knows that. Pianos. Drums. Piccolos. Sheet music upstairs. Plectrums, flageolets and kazoos in the glass cabinet. The bloke with the limp. But the worldwide web hasn't heard of Woods'. Neither has the phone book, or Yellow Pages, or 118118. In the end, I phone the only person I can think of who knows everything there is to know about Huddersfield.\n\nMe: \"Where's Woods'?\"\n\nMum: \"Where's what?\"\n\nMe: \"Where's Woods'?\"\n\nMum: \"What's Woods'?\"\n\nMe: \"Woods' shop.\"\n\nMum: \"Woods' what?\"\n\nMe: \"Woods' shop.\"\n\nMum: \"Woods' music shop?\"\n\nMe: \"Yes.\"\n\nMum: \"What about it?\"\n\nMe: \"Where is it?\"\n\nMum: \"It closed down. Or it got taken over.\"\n\nMe: \"Woods'? When?\"\n\nMum: \"Years ago. Why?\"\n\nMe: \"I need to buy an electric guitar.\"\n\nThere's a long, contemplative pause, then she says, \"No. It's gone. You're too late.\"\n\n· To hear the Scaremongers' first single, go to blogs.theguardian.com/music, or thescaremongers.com.
