        "text": "The second part of the August new release series carries on right where last week’s part one left off. There’s still plenty of great rock, punk, power pop, postpunk, and many other genres of fantastic brand new tunes. There’s some fun stuff from our friends at Rum Bar Records. There’s the return of Hot Snakes/Rocket From the Crypt/Drive Like Jehu leader Swami John Reis. There’s tracks from a fantastic compilaton of Danish punk from the late 70’s. And there’s also the weirdness of Cleopatra Records’ new punk rock Rolling Stones tribute.\n\nAlong with these releases are the usual mix of both veteran and brand new artists! Also, please head to YouTube and subscribe to our channel – Public Domain Classics 888. We have close to 500 classic films from over 110 years of releases!\n\nFor more info, including setlists, head to http://scotthudson.blogspot.com\n\nDownload MP3 here\n\nWe may be heading to the end of summer but it’s not the end of great music. Once again, the new release episode for this month has been expanded into a two part extravaganza. Tonight’s first part features a number of “friends of the show”, including monthly singles by White Rose Motor Oil and Rob Moss & Skin-Tight Skin. There Realpunkradio’s Greg Lonesome with his Intrusive Thoughts project, a teaser from Tamar Berk’s upcoming record, a couple of new tracks from Big Stir Records, and plenty of others that so graciously keep me on their mailing list!\n\nOf course, that’s not all. We have the return of X with reportedly their final album. There’s the first new Kaisers album in 246 months! Jack White is also represented with his surprise new release that I’m not afraid to say is his best music since the demise of The White Stripes. Plus so much more!\n\nAlong with these releases are the usual mix of punk, garage, power pop, and much more! Also, please head to YouTube and subscribe to our channel – Public Domain Classics 888. We have close to 500 classic films from over 110 years of releases!\n\nFor more info, including setlists, head to http://scotthudson.blogspot.com\n\nDownload MP3 here\n\nIt’s that time again. The “Covers” folder on my laptop is full, so it’s time to turn those into a Ledge episode. But it’s not just new releases this time around. Oh sure, we’ve got new remakes by The Half-Cubes (Phil Seymour), Wyldlife (Tom Petty), The Loons (Pretty Things), and so much more. There are also sets devoted to new tribute records devoted to Jagger/Richards and Guided By Voices, along with a pair of tracks from a new covers album by The Raveonettes. Most importantly, I have another new verson of ‘Teenage Kicks”! This time it’s by the triumphant return of Lone Justice!\n\nI was also inspired by some old finds. A nice find in the used bin at the record store resulted in the Troggs cover by Buzzcocks. Watching a documentary on Tubi regarding the fabulous 90s power pop band Material Issue (Out of Time: The Material Issue Story) found me searching out a couple of fantastic rare remakes. Doing a deep dive on the super lengthy discography of South Dakota’s own Friends of Cesar Romero led to a discover of a Cheap Trick tribute spinoff called Chief Trick. All of these, and more, are represented on tonight’s show!\n\nAlong with these releases are the usual mix of punk, garage, power pop, and much more! Also, please head to YouTube and subscribe to our channel – Public Domain Classics 888. We have close to 450 classic films from over 110 years of releases!\n\nFor more info, including setlists, head to http://scotthudson.blogspot.com\n\nDownload MP3 here\n\nThe second episode of this month’s new release series focuses heavily on single releases. I’m talking the traditional sort of single, with an a-side and b-side. Not the modern streaming-era lone song that doesn’t even necessarily promote an upcoming album.\n\nNope, this week we have quite a few two (or more) track singles, and the majority of them are available on traditional 7″ vinyl. There’s a split single feauring two tracks from The Drolls and Gentlemen Rogues. There’s an all-covers “supergroup” that sees members of the U.K. Subs and The Dead Boys covering a trio of 60’s classics. There’s fabulous punky garage-rock from The Legendary Swagger. You also get to hear the first new tunes in four years from Wyldlife. And you also get a trio of releases from a fantastic label called I-94 Recordings. Their series of releases features a brand new A-side, along wiht a cover of a Detroit artist on the flip. This is a perfect format for fans of The Sleeveens, Pat Todd & The Rankoutsiders, and Norcos Y Horchata.\n\nAlong with these releases are the usual mix of punk, garage, power pop, and much more! Also, please head to YouTube and subscribe to our channel – Public Domain Classics 888. We have close to 450 classic films from over 110 years of releases!\n\nFor more info, including setlists, head to http://scotthudson.blogspot.com\n\nDownload MP3 here\n\nEarlier this week, fans of Minneapolis rock and roll were stunned by the news that former Zuzu’s Petals leader Laurie Lindeen had passed away on July 1 due to a brain aneurysm. Besdies that wonderful 90s band, Lindeen later published her memoirs, Petal Pusher: A Rock and Roll Cinderella Story, in 2008. Of course, we had to memoralize her passing with a few tracks from her band.\n\nSince it’s also the first Friday of the month, it’s also new release night, so the second half focuses primarily on “friends of the show”. There’s the monthly new tracks by White Rose Motor Oil, Rob Moss and Skin-Tight Skin, and Moss’ other project, ROBOTOM, Ltd. There’s a trio of brand new tunes from our friends at Rum Bar Records, and towards the end of the show there are two cuts from records that are bound to do very well on my end of the year charts!\n\nAlso, please head to YouTube and subscribe to our channel – Public Domain Classics 888. We have close to 300 classic films from over 110 years of releases!\n\nFor more info, including setlists, head to http://scotthudson.blogspot.com\n\nDownload MP3 here\n\nBesides the monthly new release episodes, another regular feature of this show is the “quarterly recap”, where I play tracks from the best albums released over the last three months. This month features a wide variety of rock, punk, power pop, Americana, and a few other sub-genres. Everybody should be able to find a new favorite record in this expanded episode.\n\nBefore we get to the highlights of the quarter, though, I’ve got a tribute to arguably the greatest rock and roller my state has ever produced. Myron Lee, the leader of Myron Lee & The Caddies, passed away just days before his 83rd birthday. Along with airing a handful of his late 50s/early 60s hits, I come clean about the simple fact that for the longest time I was completely unaware of his true rockin’ sound. In fact, it was due to an appearance on another Real Punk Radio broadcast that I finally understood that rockabilly and punk fanatics have been collecting his singles for decades! RIP Myron!\n\nAlso, please head to YouTube and subscribe to our channel – Public Domain Classics 888.

Utilizing primarily new(er) releases, accompanied by a handful of old faves or covers, you have over two hours of songs about not only the season but the sun, baseball, surfing, and other similar seasonal higlights.\n\nAlso, please head to YouTube and subscribe to our channel – Public Domain Classics 888. We have close to 300 classic films from over 110 years of releases!\n\nFor more info, including setlists, head to http://scotthudson.blogspot.com\n\nDownload MP3 here\n\nThe second episode of this month’s new release series picks up right where last week’s ended. Bracketed by two wonderful singles by Hayley and the Crushers, the two hour broadcast features almost a dozen tracks from our friends at Rum Bar Records, a handful of tunes from a great new tribute to Dischord Records, returns from veteran artists such as The Loons, Pat Todd & The Rankoutsiders, and Johnny Moped, and a ton of punk, power pop, and straight ahead rock and roll.\n\nAlso, please head to YouTube and subscribe to our channel – Public Domain Classics 888. We have over 250 classic films from over 110 years of releases!\n\nFor more info, including setlists, head to http://scotthudson.blogspot.com\n\nDownload MP3 here\n\nI don’t think anybody is surprised that once again the monthly new release episode is a two parter. That’s the way this excellent year in music has gone, and will hopefully carry on all the way through December.\n\nThis week’s episode kicks off with a “friends of the show” series of tracks. There’s the latest in White Rose Motor Oil’s “pre-owned songs” series, along with the monthly releases of new tracks by Rob Moss and Skin-Tight Skin and Rob’s side project Robotom, LTD.\n\nBut there’s also the exciting news that fellow RealPunkRadio DJ Greg Lonesome, host of the Rock ‘n’ Roll Manifesto, has a new project called Intrusice Thoughts. As legendary blogger Lord Rutledge wrote on his Faster and Louder blog, “the band’s debut single ‘Daytime Drama’ is a ferocious shot of rockin’ old school punk with a very important message. Greg wrote the lyrics as a reflection of how he felt starting therapy…of course ‘Daytime Drama’ is a dark song, but it ends with a glimmer of hope.”\n\nAlong with these great tunes from our pals, there’s a set devoted to the fantastic Jem Records Celebrates Jagger & Richards, along with new music by Buffalo Tom, Memo PST, Ultrabomb, Micah Schnabel, and two full sets of ferocious female-fronted rock and roll!\n\nFor more info and setlists, head to http://scotthudson.blogspot.com\n\nDownload MP3 here\n\nAnyone who has listened to recent episode of The Ledge has heard me wax (somewhat) poetically about Steven H. Gardner’s four-part series of Another Tuneless Racket – Punk and New Wave In The Seventies books. They are quite possibly the greatest documents of late 70’s punk and new wave music. Gardner is a master at combining strong (at times atypical) opinions with deep, deep research.\n\nVolume one of this series is subtitled “Origins”, and deals with artists that had their first records out by 1976. Tonight’s show includes one or two tracks by the 18 artists he profiles, along with snippets of his commentary on the bands and/or the individual tracks. Admittedly, most of these acts are no stranger to this show, but there are a handful of groups who I had to research to put this broadcast together. (Later volumes include a plethora of performers I had no knowledge of prior to reading about them, which for me is the greatest treat with books of this sort.)\n\nFor more info, including setlists, head to http://scotthudson.blogspot.com\n\nDownload MP3 here"
