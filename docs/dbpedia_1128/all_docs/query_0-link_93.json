        "text": "David Seifert\n\nDirector of College Scouting\n\nThe Collegiate National Team Training Camp began on June 25. Unlike year’s past when one team would represent the CNT on the summer circuit, this summer two teams were formed. One named the International Friendship Series team was composed of mainly 2025 draft-eligible prospects. The other, named the Summer League Tour team, was rostered with mostly 2026 draft-eligibles.\n\nAfter the Trials were complete, the two teams squared off in the annual Stars vs. Stripes series. Following this series, the International Friendship Series team competed in the 21st USA vs. Chinese Taipei International Friendship Series and the Summer League Tour team played in a four-game tour against select teams from the Appalachian League and Coastal Plain League.\n\nDay One Prospects, International Friendship Series Team:\n\n1. Tyler Bremner, RHP, UC Santa Barbara- Entered in relief against Chinese Taipei and was virtually unhittable. His velocity has taken a substantial leap from high school as he pitched comfortably in the 95-96 mph range. From a three-quarter release point his arm is super quick, his head quiet and overall it’s a starter package. Bremner showed three plus to better pitches in his fastball, breaking ball and changeup. His 79-82 mph changeup is the best of the three and grades nearly as a 70 (plus-plus) pitch. He can land it for strikes on both sides of the plate vs right handed and left handed batters. It’s a nasty swing/miss pitch with depth and fade. He can also manipulate the action and cut it to his gloveside. Another near 70-grade pitch is his turbo sweeper at 88-89 mph. It’s a hard-actioned biter with teeth. He also flashed a plus hook with more depth and up/down break at 84 mph. Bremner showed the best “stuff” of any pitcher at Trials and his changeup might be the best pitch in college baseball, comparable to Kevin Kopps’ (Arkansas) cutter in 2021. He’s also a low-pulse guy who looks to have an inner edge. Some scouts have already begun to compare Bremner to Aaron Nola. If the 2025 draft were next week, Bremner would likely be one of the first collegians off the board.\n\n2. Jamie Arnold, LHP, Florida State- Started against Chinese Taipei on July 2nd and dominated for four innings, barely sweating. Made it look super easy while operating from a three-quarter to low three-quarter slot. Pounded the strike zone at will with two present Major League pitches, plus pitchability and full confidence. His tempo and ease of operation were excellent. He commanded a 92-95 mph riding fastball that played above its velo and produced repeated swing/miss. His sweeping breaker was a plus pitch at 85-86 and he also flashed a deeper breaker with less velo at 78-79. Arnold’s change-of-pace is more of a work-in-progress and he toyed with a split change grip during the tour. The improvement of this pitch will only bolster his draft position into a top ten overall pick. Think Mike Minor, Reid Detmers, etc. as past college left-handers with this kind of stuff, pitchability and track record … they don’t make it much past the top ten. While he lacks the sheer power of the Hagen Smith’s or Garrett Crochet’s of the world, his ability to efficiently utilize 92-95 and command a consistently average to better breaker makes him very difficult to face. Arnold should be a fast mover with No. 2 starter ceiling in the Major Leagues.\n\n3. Gabe Gaeckle, RHP, Arkansas (2026)- A top half of the first round prospect at this point for the 2026 draft, the 5-foot-11, 200 pound Gaeckle is a short, strong, power right-hander with smooth delivery and control of a upper-90s fastball and hard-biting slider. He’s a big arm with big stuff, but what separates Gaeckle is his ability to repeat his delivery and fill up the strike zone. As a true freshman last season for the Razorback, Gaeckle walked just 19 in 42.2 innings, while compiling a lowly 2.32 ERA as a go-to reliever. Expect him to lead the Arkansas rotation next spring and continue to build his track record as a likely first rounder in two years.\n\n4. Gabe Davis, RHP, Oklahoma State- Long and athletic at 6-foot-8, 225 pounds with a Jered Weaver-like-frame, Davis has front-of-the-rotation potential. He has the rare combination of a tall frame and a quick arm. He also repeats a compact delivery really, really well, especially for a human of his size. He controlled a swing/miss fastball up to 99 mph (96-98 comfort zone) with a steep downhill path to the plate. He kept his heater at the knees and complemented it with a firm 88 mph changeup and a swing/miss 86-88 slider, showing the ability to vary the shape with sweep or depth. Although firm, he showed good feel for his changeup, one that could turn into an above average offering. A tough competitor, Davis also has the intangibles with great makeup. While many in the scouting industry may get a future reliever vibe, Davis, for me, gets some warm fuzzies as a future starter in pro baseball. Regardless, he’s a no doubt Day One prospect at this point in time.\n\n5. Kyson Witherspoon, RHP, Oklahoma- With great presence on the mound and a durable frame at 6-foot-2, 205 pounds, Witherspoon shows an easy delivery with compact arm action. He hides the ball well before unleashing a 96-98 fastball that he locates to all parts of the strike zone. His cutter is really tough to barrel at 91-92 mph and his above average to plus slider has big lateral action at 86-87 mph. His present changeup is too firm and a below average pitch at 90 mph, but all of his pitches are released from the same tunnel/same release point for the most part. Witherspoon was considered by the CNT staff as a high aptitude learner and projects to the middle of a Major League rotation.\n\n6. Nate Snead, RHP, Tennessee- Snead’s later arrival to the team was delayed by the Vols’ natty run and parade, but he made it in plenty of time to power his fastball to 100 (Heat Sheet) for the CNT. It was more 95-96 vs Chinese Taipei with below average life and it’s a pitch that plays down a bit from its pure velocity with a whiff rate of just 21.4% (69th percentile) this past spring. His curve is a work-in-progress and currently his third or fourth pitch, but a short, sharp cutter at 90-91 does get some swing/miss (37.3% whiff rate), although it’s mostly an off the barrel/soft contact pitch at this time. Overall, Snead lacks a true swing/miss present pitch but his heater is undeniable, as is his good makeup and aptitude. Be on the lookout for the next great success story from the Volunteer first round arm barn over the next year.\n\n7. Ben Jacobs, LHP, Arizona State- A personal favorite, Jacobs posted very good numbers as a sophomore starter for the Sun Devils in 2024. His 102 strikeouts in just 66.1 innings (35.2% strikeout rate) is a testament to his nasty stuff and his ability to mix his pitches. A 92-94 mph fastball is his main offering, but an above average split-grip changeup that he commands and an above average curveball are also legitimate weapons. He is not afraid to double-up his change-of-pace and he’s also able to manipulate his 79-81 mph breaker for different shapes and looks. Overall, Jacobs is a high pitch ability left-hander with three average to better offerings and reminds of 2020 second-rounder Logan Allen (FIU/Cleveland) in many ways.\n\n8. Anthony Eyanson, RHP, UC San Diego/LSU- Showing a loose and quick arm from a high three-quarter release point, Eyanson impressed at the trials. He filled up the zone with a 95-97 mph fastball and a hammer-time 12/6 breaker in the upper-70s. It showed as a plus-plus offering with consistent spin and control with repeated spot-ups to his armside. He also showed a harder version of his breaker, a power slurve at 83-84. There also looked to be more in the tank with his No. 1. It’s a pitch that could very well bump into the triple-digits as early as this fall in his new home of Baton Rouge.\n\n9. Matt Scott, RHP, Stanford- There’s work to do and a lot of projection involved for the 6-foot-7, 245-pound Scott to become a Day One draft pick, but there’s also a lot to work with. From a high three-quarter slot Scott shows some herky/jerky to his delivery which makes it tough to repeat on time, every time. His 93-96 mph fastball is also flatter-shaped than desired and there’s more present control than command. A marginal athlete, Scott also showed an upper-80s cutter, mid-80s slider and a 83-84 mph split changeup with late bottom and some fade.\n\nOther top arm talent for the International Friendship Series:\n\nThere must be improvement to his command and his ability to pitch and there’s a lot of projection involved when evaluating, but Patrick Forbes (Louisville) certainly has the athleticism, stuff and makeup to jump into Day One conversations. A two-way player for Louisville, Forbes is currently more thrower than pitcher, much due to the limited innings on his arm. There is a reliever look to his operation and his delivery needs some polish, but he has a special fastball, touching 98 on my look. It’s a unicorn pitch with its flight and vertical, but he battles spurts where he just sprays it around. His second pitch is a gyro slider at 80-81. It’s a below average present pitch much due to the control, but more innings and reps give it a good chance for rapid improvement. Cardinals’ teammate Tucker Biven showed feel for five pitches, led by his best-pitch 93-95 mph sinker. His four-seamer also touched 95 and he landed a quality curve for strikes. The 6-foot right-hander also showed a hard slider at 86 mph and tinkered with a developing changeup in the 86-87 range. He’s another Louisville product who was lauded by the CNT coaching staff for his competitiveness and high-grade makeup. Left-hander Alton Davis II (Alabama/Georgia) is tall and super slender with long legs and a high-waist. He’s also super athletic and blessed with a quick arm. During the trials he repeatedly spotted a mid-90s fastball that touched 97 to his gloveside. He also repeated an average to better quality curveball with 12/6 spin at 77-78 mph and an above average slider in the mid-80s that he tended to drop his arm. His fourth pitch 88 mph changeup is a work-in-progress, but it did show promise. Malachi Witherspoon (Oklahoma) was up to 99 mph this past spring with his fastball, but it sat 95-96 at the trials. To my eyes his 85 mph power slider was a better pitch than his more often-used curve, but both were effective secondary offerings. Georgia right-hander Kolten Smith was up to 95 with his fastball from a high three-quarter slot. His cutter was the best of his breakers at 87-89 and got some swing/miss while missing barrels. He also showed a sweeper, traditional curveball and a changeup and was not afraid to use his whole arsenal. Derrick Smith (NC State) showed one of the top sliders on the staff. With a longer, loose path and a quick arm, he ran his heater up to 97, mostly 94-95. With fair command there was very little swing/miss and he’s in need of making adjustments to its movement profile. However, it’s his hammer breaker that pays the bills and he repeats the pitch in the low-80s for nasty action that he can manipulate more more/less sweep and slide. Oregon State lefty Nelson Keljo is an arm strength with fair deception from a high slot. His fastball touched 95 with some tail to his arm side and occasional ride up when on the inner half. With fair control he was a one and half pitch guy who had some trouble finishing his slider and getting it into the zone. Fellow southpaw Ben Abeldt (TCU) relies on deception and a different look with a super crossbody delivery and a sling arm action. He attacked with a super-lively fastball up to 93 mph that was down in the zone for numerous ground ball outs and some swing-throughs.\n\nDay One Prospects, Summer League Tour Team:\n\nJason DeCaro, RHP, North Carolina- Has it all to become the top college pitching prospect for the 2026 draft. Long and loose at 6-foot-5, 220 pounds and young for his class only recently turning 18 years old this past April, DeCaro was up to 95 with his fastball and controlled two plus secondary pitches in a mid-70s curveball and a low-80s slider. As a true freshman this spring for the Tar Heels, he posted a 6-1 record with a 3.81 ERA and held opponents to a .220 average.\n\nJoey Volchko, RHP, Stanford- The Stanford righthander arguably has a higher ceiling than DeCaro, Volchko sat 96-98 during the Stars & Stripes, and has touched 100 previously. He will also flash a present plus slider and above average changeup. It all comes out of a high three-quarter release point with a loose arm circle. There’s also some deception with lots of knees and elbows coming at the hitter thanks to his lanky 6-foot-4, 210-pound athletic frame and high leg kick. The quantum leap that Paul Skenes made during his sophomore to junior year is very rare, but Volchko is ahead of Skenes at the same age. If he puts it all together, he’s easily a top five overall pick prospect for the 2026 draft and 1-1 isn’t out of the question.\n\nEthan McElvain, LHP, Vanderbilt- Highly ranked as a senior, McElvain had a much different look for the CNT than last fall at Vanderbilt against Wake Forest where he sat 94-95, touched 96 and his plus breaker missed bats. On this look he was out of sync as he rushed to the plate and pulled off his lines. His fastball sat 91-92 with fair life, but he did show a late-breaking curve at 79 and a slider/cutter at 84-86. McElvain is also now much more physical than just nine months ago. Standing 6-foot-3, 245 pounds, he looks to have gained roughly 25 pounds, going from a somewhat lanky teen to his man body in one college season. Regardless of this one-inning and less than stellar appearance, McElvain still has front-of-the-rotation potential with a calm presence and good makeup. The first round in 2026 is written all over him.\n\nLiam Peterson, RHP, Florida- Another highly touted prep as a senior by Prep Baseball, Peterson was rudely welcomed into the SEC to the tune of a 6.18 ERA during his freshman season in Gainesville. However, it’s not for a lack of stuff. An average athlete, the 6-foot-5, 210-pound right-hander can touch the upper-90s with his fastball. However, the pitch plays well below its velocity as it tends to be straight and as a result, hittable. His 83-84 mph breaking ball has plus action and swing/miss when he lands it in the zone and his upper-80s changeup is currently his third pitch. Peterson made one start on the Summer League Tour and struck out seven in four shutout innings while allowing just one hit and no walks. At this point in his development he reminds of former Gator closer Brandon Sproat who was selected in the 2nd round by the Mets in 2023.\n\nKyle Johnson, LHP, Duke- Two-way talent put together an excellent freshman season on both sides of the ball for the Blue Devils. Posted a 4-1 record with a 4.38 ERA and 53 strikeouts in 49.1 innings on the mound and a .253 average with three home runs in the batter’s box. With moderate effort he can run his fastball up to 96 with more angle than true life from his three-quarter release point. His changeup is his best pitch at 85-87 mph and he also shows an effective 79-81 slurve. Johnson struck out four in two innings of scoreless relief while on the Summer League Tour.\n\nAdditional pitchers – CNT Summer League Tour team:"
