If you havenât worked out with us before, click on the workout you want to access and watch it first. We mean thatâ¦ kick back, relax and enjoy the music. Once youâve seen what youâre about to do, youâll feel more confident jumping in and giving it a go.\n\nFor your first workout, start with just 20 minutes of one workout and see how you go. If youâre tired, and feel like youâre short of breath then thatâs enough. Youâll be able to do more next time.\n\nMany of the LES MILLS+ workouts donât require any equipment at all. All you need is space to move safely (we recommend at least 6sqm of clear space). All of our workouts also offer non-equipment alternatives.\n\nBODYPUMP and LES MILLS GRIT Strength are weights-based workouts that use a barbell and/or weights plates, LES MILLS CORE requires a resistance band and weight plates and RPM requires a stationary cycle.\n\nItâs important that you hydrate before and after your workout. You donât need anything fancy, good old H2O will do the trick.\n\nOur technique videos will help you master the moves for each program. We recommend you watch these before you start a workout for the first time. In addition, each workout contains technique guidance from our instructors - you must listen carefully and follow all guidance.\n\nIf at any time you feel you are exercising beyond your current fitness abilities, or you feel discomfort, pain, dizziness, or nausea, you should discontinue exercising immediately.\n\nYou are responsible for exercising within your limits and assume all risk of injury to your person or property.\n\nIf youâre looking for a full-body weights workout, that will get you lean, toned and fit â fast, try BODYPUMPâ¢.\n\nYou will need a barbell with weights and a bench, along with comfortable clothes and supportive shoes. Donât worry if youâre an absolute beginner; we start you off with light weights and teach you to get stronger. You can even start off doing half classes for the first week. Increase the weights and duration as your strength and fitness increase.\n\nYou may be sore the day after you do BODYPUMP for the first few weeks; embrace this feeling! BODYPUMP really challenges all of your major muscle groups. We recommend you do no more than two or three classes a week, with at least a day off.\n\nAs long as you have been cleared by your midwife or doctor, BODYPUMP is fine for you to do if you are pregnant. We recommend some modifications to the workout for pregnancy; you can find them here.\n\nWant to give it a go?\n\nSTART YOUR FREE TRIAL\n\nBuild your flexibility, strength and inner serenity with our two yoga-fusion mind body workouts.\n\nBODYBALANCEâ¢ is ideal for anyone and everyone.

All you need is a stationary bike. Tune in to some great music and get your pedals spinning as your instructor takes you on a journey of hill climbs, sprints and flat riding. You control your own resistance levels and speed so you can build up your fitness level over time.\n\nThe key to RPM is having your bike set up correctly - be sure to do this before you start. Some of the tracks in RPM involve getting off the bike seat. If this doesnât work on your bike you can stay seated.\n\nMost home bikes only require regular footwear, but if you have pedals designed for cycling shoes, youâll need those too. If youâre unsure, unscrew your pedals and take them into your local cycling store - they can help you out.\n\nWe recommend you do RPM two or three times a week to get great fitness results.
