        "text": "Every young man needs a good suit to look his best, whether it’s for a special occasion or just for everyday life. But how do you know how to measure him properly for the perfect fit?\n\nLuckily, with just a few simple steps and measuring tape, you can be sure your son is wearing an outfit that will make him feel confident in any situation. This step-by-step guide walks you through how to measure a boy for a suit so he looks sharp and feels great every time he puts one on. We will also share a bonus method to measure the correct size of boys’ suits without using a measuring tape.\n\nSo grab your tape measure, and let’s get started...\n\nThings You Will Need To Measure A Boy For A Suit\n\nFor accurate measurements, you will need the following:\n\n1. A Measuring Tape\n\nSelect one that is flexible and can easily wrap around your son’s body. It should also be easy to read, so pick one where the numbers are visible and distinguishable.\n\n2. Pen and Paper to Note Down Measurements\n\nNo matter how perfect your memory is, you’ll want to make a note of the measurements for future reference. Here are some major things to measure and not down:\n\nChest\n\nWaist\n\nHips\n\nInseam\n\nSleeve Length\n\nShoulder Width\n\n3. A Piece of The Boy’s Clothing If He Is Not Available\n\nIf you measure for a suit, but the boy is not available, choose a piece of his clothing that he typically wears that fits him well. This will help you choose the perfect suit size for later when ordering a boys’ suit online.\n\nRelated read: How to Pick the Perfect Boys Suit for Any Occasion [Interlink: How to Pick the Perfect Boys Suit for Any Occasion]\n\n7 Steps to Measure A Boy for A Suit\n\nStep 1: Measure the Sleeve Length\n\nBegin by taking your measuring tape to the shoulder blade, where you should be able to feel a small bump. Continue down until you reach several inches past the wrist; if using a shirt sleeve as a reference, stop just before reaching the cuff.\n\nStep 2: Measure Around The Waistline\n\nKnowing your son’s waistline is key to finding the perfect fit. Our suits are equipped with a unique elastic waistband that provides extra space for growth, so all you need to do is take a measuring tape and measure around his midsection. By doing this simple task, you’ll have a better idea of what waist size will work best for him.\n\nStep 3: Take The Chest Size\n\nMeasure your son’s chest circumference with a measuring tape - two ways to do this. Place the tape just beneath his armpits, or choose the overarm method, which entails including arms in the measurement.\n\nNote: Chest measurement is one of the most important details you need when shopping for a boys’ suit, as it will determine how well everything else fits.\n\nStep 4: Measure The Trousers/Pants Length\n\nStart at the waistline when measuring, not the hipbone; measure all the way down to your ankles. This same method can be employed when you take measurements for a pair of trousers as well.\n\nStep 5: Take Measurements from Shoulder Seam to Shoulder Seam\n\nBegin at the top sleeve and measure directly across. Recall in step one when we mentioned locating your shoulder blade where it protrudes. That would be the same point you use to start calculating your shoulder-to-shoulder span.\n\nStep 6: Measure the Inseam Length\n\nThis measurement should be taken from the crotch to just past the ankles. Doing this will help you figure out the right length for your son’s trousers and other pants. For an accurate measurement, hold the tape measure parallel to the leg with a slight gap between each. Additionally, ensure that shoes are removed before taking measurements.\n\nStep 7: Compare The Measurements To The Size Chart\n\nOnce you have your measurements, please utilize the size chart given by the store to determine which size best fits you. If your chest measurement corresponds to one size while your waist indicates a different size, simply choose the jacket that complements both. The pant sizing should be suitable without any extra modifications – however, if needed, an experienced tailor can easily adjust up or down two sizes on either side seam and waistband.\n\nHow to Take Measurements Without A Measuring Tape?\n\nIf you don’t have a measuring tape available, it’s still possible to take the necessary measurements. Here are some other methods you can use:\n\nWaist – Choose a belt that fits your son comfortably, and then measure the length of the belt from the end of one hole to the other.\n\nChest – Measure a shirt that fits your son well and take note of the size shown on the tag.\n\nShoulder – Take a shirt that fits your son well and measures the length from one shoulder seam to the other.\n\nSleeve – Measure the sleeve length from shoulder to end of the cuff.\n\nInseam – Measure a pair of trousers or shorts that fit your son. Lay the waistband flat and measure from the inside waist to the bottom of the hemline.\n\nRecommended Reads\n\nAdvice on Buying Suit for Teenager Boy [Interlink: Advice on Buying Suit for Teenager Boy]\n\n10 Best Boys 5-Piece Suits [Interlink: 10 Best Boys 5-Piece Suits]\n\nFAQs\n\nHow do I know if my son’s measurements are accurate?\n\nWhen taking waist size, chest size, and other measurements from your son, ensure that you measure two or three times to make sure they are accurate.\n\nWhat do I do if I am having trouble finding the right size?\n\nIf you have difficulty determining the right size measurements for your son, you may want to consult a local tailor for help. They will be able to provide more specific advice regarding measurement and size selection. Additionally, many stores have a customer service team who can also assist with size selection.\n\nAre there any tips for taking accurate measurements?\n\nMake sure to stand upright when taking measurements and ensure the tape measure remains parallel to the floor. Additionally, if possible, have someone help you take measurements for an even more accurate result. And finally, don’t forget to include the arms in your measurements.\n\nOrder The Suit and Enjoy!\n\nOnce you have taken your son’s measurements and compared them to the size chart, it’s time to order the suit.\n\nFlexsuits offers a wide variety of garments and styles to choose from, allowing you to customize the perfect outfit for your son.
