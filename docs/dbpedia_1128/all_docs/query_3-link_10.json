What children learn through their early interactions with parents and caregivers becomes the foundation for all future development. Research shows that nurturing relationships and safe, secure environments improve brain development and child well-being.\n\nParents and caregivers who have a social network and concrete support in times of need are better able to provide safe environments and nurturing experiences for their children. All families need a helping hand at some point, so we want to be sure you know that help is available when you need it.\n\nThis book provides information about:\n\nChild development from birth through the teen years\n\nTips for creating the stimulating and nurturing environments children need\n\nTips for managing the challenges of family life\n\nContact information for valuable community resources\n\nRemember, it is also important for you to take good care of yourself physically, mentally and emotionally. When you are feeling good, it is easier to be a positive, loving parent and do all you need to do to care for your child.\n\nWe hope you use the resources in the following pages as a guide for what you can expect as your child develops. We also encourage you to talk to your child’s doctor or other professionals if you have any questions or concerns about your child.\n\n*This guide is also available as an e-book for smart phones, tablets or other mobile\n\nYour Child at Birth\n\nCongratulations! You are now a parent! Feeling anxious, overwhelmed and exhausted is normal. As you begin to adjust to your new life, try to remember that getting as much information and support as you can now will help you make the best decisions for your family in the future.\n\nCrying The average newborn cries two to three hours a day, and sometimes more. Babies this age may cry for no reason and a parent may not be able to stop the baby from crying. Most of the time this is normal.\n\nSleep Newborns may sleep up to 20 hours a day but will not have any sort of sleep pattern for the first two months. It can take up to six weeks for babies to learn to be awake during the day and asleep at night. Let babies form their own schedule by feeding them when they are hungry and putting them to bed when they seem tired.\n\nNutrition Newborns need to be fed every two to four hours. The American Academy of Pediatrics and many other world-wide organizations strongly support breastfeeding. Baby formula is a popular alternative to breastfeeding for infants less than one year of age. To meet your baby’s nutritional needs, baby formula must be prepared exactly as described on the container.\n\nPhysical Development – Many babies lose a little weight (5–7% of birth weight) during the first few days of life. They will usually return to their birth weight within two weeks as they begin to eat more during feedings. After the first two weeks, newborns typically gain around one ounce per day for the first two months, and\n\nHave almost fully developed senses of taste and smell\n\nSee objects best when they are 30 to 40 inches away from their face as their eyes cannot yet fully focus at close range. That’s why it’s so good to hold them close when feeding and interacting with them.\n\nTry to lift their head and look around\n\nSocial and Emotional Development – Newborns typically:\n\nRecognize the voices of mom and dad\n\nRecognize familiar caregivers\n\nLook at parents when they speak\n\nQuiet when a voice is heard\n\nCognitive Development – Babies respond purely through reflexes at birth. Some common reflexes are:\n\nGrasp reflex: baby will tightly grasp objects placed in hand\n\nSucking reflex: baby begins sucking when mouth area is touched\n\nStartle reflex: baby pulls arms and legs inward after hearing a loud noise\n\nStep reflex: baby makes stepping motions when sole of foot touches a hard surface\n\nCoping With Crying\n\nWHEN YOUR BABY WON’T STOP CRYING, it can be very upsetting. Know that it is normal for your baby to cry. The average newborn cries two to three hours a day, and sometimes more. Sometimes it may seem like your baby never stops crying; and all parents find it hard to cope with crying. It may seem like your baby cries more than others, but ALL babies cry a lot.\n\nYou can try the following things to help soothe your baby:\n\nCheck your baby’s basic needs: feed, burp or change your baby’s diaper if needed\n\nMake sure your baby’s clothing is not too tight, too hot, too cold, etc.\n\nOffer your baby a pacifier, but never force it\n\nGently rock your baby in a rocking chair or in your arms\n\nSoftly pat your baby on the back\n\nSing or talk softly to your baby\n\nPlay soft music\n\nTake your baby for a walk in the stroller\n\nGive your baby a warm bath\n\nStrategies to handle your frustration when your baby is crying:\n\nCall a trusted friend, relative or neighbor and ask them to come over to watch the baby and give you a break\n\nSit down, close your eyes and take deep breaths\n\nListen to music\n\nExercise\n\nMake sure baby is safe in crib and go to another room\n\nDealing with a crying baby can be very stressful, but please NEVER SHAKE YOUR BABY! Shaking a baby can cause blindness, brain damage or even death. If you are feeling overwhelmed, it is important to reach out for support.\n\nSoothe, Don’t Shake Your Baby\n\nEveryone who cares for your child should know about Shaken Baby Syndrome. Shaken Baby Syndrome (SBS) is one of the most common injuries causing death by physical abuse to infants in Florida. SBS occurs when a frustrated parent or other caregiver loses control and shakes a young child, causing permanent brain damage or death. Crying is the most common reason someone shakes a baby. The outcomes for survivors typically include cerebral palsy, blindness, deafness, seizures and learning/behavioral difficulties. Young males who care for a baby alone are most at risk to shake a baby. Everyone who watches your baby needs to know they should never shake your baby. The most important thing you can do to prevent Shaken Baby Syndrome is to understand your baby and how to cope with him when he cries or is irritable.\n\nThe Florida Department of Health contributed to the content of this tip sheet. For more information, visit their website at www.floridahealth.gov.\n\nChoosing a Responsible Caregiver\n\nWHEN YOU LEAVE YOUR CHILD WITH YOUR BOYFRIEND/PARTNER OR BABYSITTER, you expect them to care for your child just like you would, BUT that is not always the case! Every year, an overwhelming number of children are abused, neglected and even killed by temporary caregivers. Most of the time, these are boyfriends of mothers of young children but other temporary caregivers, including friends of the parents who may be ill-equipped to care for these young children, are also guilty of committing these horrific crimes.\n\nWhen young children are placed in the hands of caregivers, with little or no child care experience, the results can be life-threatening. In fact, children who live with adults not related to them are nearly 50 times as likely to die of inflicted injuries as children living with two biological parents. It’s crucial for parents to have a responsible adult or licensed child care facility to care for their young children.\n\nPeople who are under the influence of drugs or alcohol can get angry over minor things that all children do, like crying or spilling something. Some things to know and consider when deciding whether to leave your child in the care of a babysitter or caregiver are listed below but the only way to gauge this person’s reaction to your child’s behavior is to spend significant time observing them around your child.\n\nConsider, does your partner/babysitter:\n\nExpect your child to do things that are unrealistic for his/her age?\n\nShow impatience or even anger when your child cries or has a tantrum?\n\nOverreact when your child breaks rules or refuses to follow directions?\n\nCall your child bad names?\n\nThink it’s funny to scare your child?\n\nSay you are a bad parent and not strict enough with your child?\n\nHurt your child? Blame you and say it’s no big deal?\n\nMake all the decisions for you and your child?\n\nTell you that your child is a nuisance?\n\nDrink alcohol or use drugs around your child?\n\nHandle guns and knives around your child?\n\nIf you answered “yes” to even one of these questions, your child may be at risk of injury. Never let a person you do not know very well have access to or babysit your children. Get to know the person before you let them care for your child…your child’s LIFE depends on it!\n\nWHAT YOU CAN DO\n\nBesides knowing the answers to the questions above, take these additional steps to ensure you are choosing a responsible caregiver:\n\nKnow if your partner/boyfriend has a criminal history\n\nCheck the Florida Department of Corrections Offender Information Search at www.dc.state.fl.us/OffenderSearch/InmateInfoMenu.aspx\n\nCheck the Florida Sexual Offenders and Predators Database via direct link at: offender.fdle.state.fl.us\n\nAlso consider:\n\nHow do they treat other women in the family and neighborhood?\n\nHow do they treat other children in their family (nieces, nephews, friend’s children)?\n\nIf they have children, what is their relationship with them? Their mother?\n\nHow have they treated former lovers, spouses and partners?\n\nWhen you leave home:\n\nBe sure to leave your cell number or another emergency contact number\n\nLet your partner/boyfriend know that it’s okay to call for help\n\nCheck in often while you are away\n\nWhen you return home:\n\nAsk your partner/babysitter what your child did while you were away.\n\nIf your child is old enough, ask how they liked being babysat by this person.\n\nObserve your child’s appearance, condition and behavior. Do they seem peaceful and happy?\n\nFor assistance in finding childcare: www.floridaearlylearning.com/ccrr.aspx\n\nYour Child at Six to Nine Months\n\nSTIMULATING YOUR OLDER BABY REQUIRES NEW ACTIVITIES that will help improve their development in all areas. At this age, babies are very social and interact with others by smiling, waving, babbling and entertaining anyone they know. Babies this age are increasing skills like grasping, rolling over, sitting up, and possibly even crawling. Set up a safe environment for your baby to explore; mobility will improve every day and your baby will try to reach any objects that look interesting.\n\nSleep\n\nAt this stage, your baby still needs two or possibly three naps a day. Put your baby down to sleep for the night between 6 and 8 pm, and expect 11 to 13 hours of sleep. However, some babies, especially those who are breastfed, may still wake for a night feeding.\n\nNutrition\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends waiting to introduce solid foods until six months of age. Some basic ways for starting solids are:\n\nMix single-ingredient solids like rice cereal with equal amounts of breast milk or formula.\n\nStart with one feeding of solids a day. Add a second feeding when your baby can eat two to three tablespoons per feeding.\n\nIt is important to begin with vegetables, then fruit and finally protein. When your baby becomes used to spoon feedings, add single-ingredient smooth or pureed foods like carrots, peas, apples or “stage one” baby foods in the jar.\n\nTo make sure your baby is not allergic to a specific food, be sure to wait at least two to three days before starting another new food.\n\nPhysical Development\n\nDevelops eye-hand coordination\n\nSits with, and eventually without, being supported\n\nReaches for a bottle or spoon when being fed\n\nTransfers objects from one hand to the other\n\nBegins to crawl (some infants never crawl; however, by 9 months, many babies will)\n\nStarts to stand (this developmental stage varies for each child; however, some infants are able to pull themselves up and hold onto furniture by 9 months)\n\nSocial and Emotional Development\n\nTalks or babbles while looking in a mirror\n\nBecomes upset if a toy is taken away\n\nResponds to own name and recognizes family members’ names\n\nShows mild to severe anxiety when parents leave (separation anxiety)\n\nCognitive Development\n\nDevelops a better awareness of the world around them\n\nBegins to look for and find partially hidden objects, watches a ball rolled out of sight\n\nTries to get objects that are out of reach\n\nMakes noises to show displeasure or satisfaction\n\nExplores with hands and mouth\n\nADDITIONAL SAFETY TIPS FOR YOUR BABY AT SIX TO NINE MONTHS\n\nA Home Safety Checklist should be completed at each stage of your child’s development.\n\nPrevent injuries by repairing wobbly furniture or putting it in a room your baby does not enter, by using toy chests without lids or with supports that hold a lid open in any position, and by securing televisions, dressers and other heavy objects\n\nPrevent choking by keeping potential hazards like keys, coins, rings, loose buttons and other small items out of baby’s reach\n\nPrevent falls by using child safety gates at the top and bottom of all staircases\n\nPrevent poisoning and other injuries by keeping purses and wallets out of baby’s reach\n\nAlways supervise your child when she is in and around water, both inside and outside the home\n\nPositive Parenting Activities that Promote Nurturing and Attachment\n\nHelp your baby cope with separation anxiety by:\n\nExplaining that you are going to leave, but that you’ll return\n\nAlways saying goodbye when you leave your baby to help teach your baby that you will come back\n\nProviding a comfort object that will help your baby feel close to you while you are away\n\nWhen to be Concerned\n\nWhile each baby develops at his or her own pace, you should be aware of certain milestones your child should be reaching. Failure to reach certain milestones may be a sign of medical or developmental problems requiring special attention. You should let your baby’s doctor know if at six months your child:\n\nSeems very stiff, with tight muscles\n\nSeems very floppy, like a rag doll\n\nRefuses to cuddle\n\nCannot sit with help\n\nConsistently turns one or both eyes in or out\n\nDoesn’t seem to enjoy being around people\n\nDoesn’t laugh or squeal\n\nDoesn’t actively reach for objects\n\nYour Child at 12 to 18 Months\n\nAT 12 TO 18 MONTHS, your child is still growing quickly, but not as noticeably as during the first year. This developmental stage will be filled with firsts. Some babies will learn to say their first words or take their first steps, while just about all toddlers will begin to make their first efforts at independence. As children begin to walk, run and climb, they will gain confidence and a greater sense of independence. Children this age are also curious about the nature of people and things. Your child needs encouragement and freedom to explore, as well as clear boundaries and limits to feel safe.\n\nKeep in mind: Now that your child has teeth, you should brush them daily with a baby toothbrush and water\n\nThe developmental milestones typically reached at this age allow children to start placing things, people and actions in categories. For example, when you say you’re going to the store, your toddler is beginning to create a mental picture of the supermarket, and of you in it.\n\nSleep\n\nAt this age, your child needs about 14 hours of sleep in a 24-hour period. Most children will start giving up their morning nap and instead take one longer afternoon nap per day. As children adjust to less napping, they may be ready for bed a little earlier—anytime between 6 and 8 pm.\n\nNutrition\n\nEATING:\n\nAt 12 months, babies should eat a balanced diet of healthy foods such as: squash (vegetable), bananas (fruit), cheese (dairy), and chicken (protein). All foods should be cut into small pieces so children can feed themselves without the risk of choking. Foods you should still AVOID include:\n\nRaw carrots\n\nPopcorn\n\nNuts\n\nHot dogs\n\nHard candy\n\nWhole grapes\n\nBabies are still exploring most foods and probably won’t eat a lot at a single sitting. Try to provide five or six small meals a day instead of three larger ones and avoid eating meals or snacks while watching TV.\n\nDRINKING:\n\nBy 12 months, your baby is ready to stop drinking formula and begin drinking up to 24 ounces of whole milk a day. Give your baby milk from a cup rather than a bottle. Don’t forget to offer water throughout the day.\n\nPhysical Development\n\nWalks without help\n\nEnjoys holding objects while walking - often one in each hand\n\nHolds a crayon and scribbles (but with little control)\n\nGestures or points to indicate wants\n\nTurns pages in a book\n\nLikes to push, pull and dump things\n\nCognitive Development\n\nUnderstands and follows simple, one-step directions\n\nSays about 8 to 20 words, including “hi” and “bye”\n\nIdentifies objects in a book when asked\n\nPays attention to conversations\n\nSocial and Emotional Development\n\nEnjoys being held and read to\n\nImitates sounds and facial expressions\n\nPlays alone with toys\n\nADDITIONAL SAFETY TIPS FOR YOUR BABY AT 12 TO 18 MONTHS\n\nYour child can move quickly and is able to get into many dangerous situations. Pay attention to your child’s surroundings and always provide adult supervision.\n\nMost toddler falls are from windows and balconies. Help prevent falls by moving furniture away from windows, installing window guards and securing balcony doors with child-resistant latches.\n\nPrevent motor vehicle injuries by placing your baby in an appropriate rear-facing car seat. Infants and toddlers\n\nshould ride in a rear-facing car seat until they reach the highest weight or height allowed by the car seat\n\nmanufacturer. Never leave your child alone in the car, not even for a minute. The temperature inside a car can reach\n\ndeadly levels in minutes, even in mild weather.\n\nPrevent burns by blocking the kitchen with gates and keeping hot liquids out of reach.\n\nPrevent drowning by installing safety latches on toilets, emptying buckets and keeping pet water bowls out of your child’s reach.\n\nPrevent poisoning by installing latches on drawers, cabinets and anyplace where medications or cleaning materials are kept.\n\nCall Poison Control immediately if you think your child has swallowed something poisonous: 1-800-222-1222.\n\nPositive Parenting Activities that Promote Nurturing and Attachment\n\nYour child’s growing sense of independence will push him or her to test the limits of acceptable behavior. This is the right time to set a few limits that your child can understand and that you can consistently enforce. Children’s first rules should help protect their safety.\n\nYou can also try these age-appropriate discipline techniques:\n\nStay one step ahead. Distract or redirect your child from unsafe objects or activities.\n\nSave “no” primarily for safety issues. If children hear “no” too often, they start to tune it out.\n\nUse non-verbal communication. Give a stern or firm look for minor incidents.\n\nAllow time for your child to play alone. Independent play allows him or her to choose and direct the activity, and helps build confidence.\n\nNever use spanking or any other physical punishment. Spanking is never an effective form of discipline.\n\nWhen to be Concerned\n\nAccording to the American Academy of Pediatrics, you should let your doctor know if at 12 months your baby:\n\nDoes not crawl\n\nDrags one side of body while crawling for more than one month\n\nCannot stand while supported\n\nDoesn’t search for objects that are hidden while he watches\n\nSays no single words\n\nDoes not point to objects or pictures\n\nDoes not use gestures such as waving or shaking head\n\nPositive Parenting Tips that Promote Good Behavior in Early Childhood\n\nKEEP A SCHEDULE\n\nYoung children need a regular schedule. They behave better when they know what to expect. Try to have them eat, nap and play at the same times each day. When planning their daily schedule, include active time and quiet time; time playing together and time for children to play by themselves.\n\nOFFER ENCOURAGEMENT\n\nEncouraging words help your child build confidence. The key to encouraging your child is to be a coach more than a cheerleader. A cheerleader says: “What a great job!” or “What a beautiful picture!” A coach uses specific praise. For example, when your child sets the table, you might say, “You did such a good job setting the table! You put the spoons and forks in the right place and remembered the napkins!” When you look at a child’s painting, you might say, “This painting just glows with color. You used blue, green, red, yellow and orange. Tell me how you did this!” Specific praise means a lot more to a child than a brief, “You are great.”\n\nAdditional tips:\n\nTell your child what they can DO instead of telling them DON’T\n\nProvide children with simple explanations for your rules or limits and offer alternatives\n\nParents should work together so that children get a set of consistent limits. Whether parents are living together or apart, having the same rules is important to avoid confusing children.\n\nFAST FIX\n\nChange Your Approach\n\nInstead of: “Don’t leave your toy there.”\n\nTry: “Take your toy back to your room.”\n\nInstead of: “Don’t touch anything.”\n\nTry: “We are just looking at these things.”\n\nInstead of: “Don’t kick her.”\n\nTry: “Kicking hurts, use your words to tell her you are upset.”\n\nUse Simple Explanations and Alternatives\n\n“It is 8:00 and time for bed; you may play with the markers tomorrow.\"\n\n“You may not have popcorn now because it is dinnertime. You may have some Jell-O\n\nfor dessert after you are finished with your dinner.”\n\nPractice Giving Choices*\n\nAsk your children if they would like a banana or applesauce for their snack.\n\nWould they like to play with blocks or books?\n\n*Avoid asking if your child is ready to go to bed, or if they would like to put on their jacket before going outside because it is cold. These activities are not optional.\n\nYour Child at 24 to 36 Months\n\nTWO-YEAR-OLDS ARE LEARNING SO MUCH ABOUT THE WORLD AROUND THEM. They begin to ask lots of questions, and they love to imitate adults. They are learning to share and take turns. Sometimes they want to play with others, and sometimes they want to be alone. Toddlers this age like to make choices and do more things on their own.\n\nSleep\n\nFor many children this age, it’s time to leave the crib and move on to a bed.\n\nMake the transition exciting by talking about the big bed and the items that might go in it, such as new bedding or a favorite stuffed animal\n\nStick to the same bedtime (between 6 and 8 pm) and continue with your normal bedtime routines like reading, singing and bathing\n\nExplain to children that once they have been kissed good night and tucked in, they are not to get out of bed. If your child gets out of bed, quietly and calmly take him or her back to bed until he or she learns to stay there.\n\nNutrition\n\nAt this age, children often become picky eaters and lose interest in food. You may find that some days, your child might not be interested in food at all, and other days, he might only want to eat a certain type of food. Be assured, when your child is hungry, he will want to eat—it is your job to ensure you are providing healthy options by offering a variety of healthy foods.\n\nAvoid the use of food as a reward\n\nAvoid withholding food as a punishment\n\nPhysical Development\n\nRuns, jumps and climbs\n\nWalks on tiptoes\n\nThrows and kicks balls\n\nLearns to zip and unzip\n\nDrinks from a small cup without spilling (in the beginning, a cup with a sippy top)\n\nUndresses self\n\nDresses with help\n\nUses a fork and spoon correctly\n\nHelps to put things away\n\nSocial and Emotional Development\n\nLikes having familiar stories read to them\n\nBegins to enjoy playing alone\n\nInitiates own play activities\n\nDoesn’t like changes in routines\n\nWatches other children at play and joins in\n\nHas a hard time sharing things\n\nShows independence and wants to do things alone\n\nFollows simple rules such as taking turns\n\nCognitive Development\n\nCalls self by own name\n\nSpeaks 900 or more words\n\nPoints and names own body parts when asked\n\nUses phrases and three- to five-word sentences\n\nRepeats simple rhymes and songs\n\nBegins to develop a longer attention span\n\nCarries out simple one, two or three-step requests\n\nADDITIONAL SAFETY TIPS FOR YOUR CHILD AT 24 TO 36 MONTHS\n\nA Home Safety Checklist should be completed at each stage of your child’s development.\n\nPrevent choking by choosing toys that do not have small parts\n\nPrevent burns by keeping hot foods in the middle of the table and testing the temperature of foods before giving them to your child.\n\nPositive Parenting Activities that Promote Nurturing and Attachment\n\nTry to remain patient and keep your cool during temper tantrums.\n\nRather than using physical punishment, create consequences that relate to the behavior. For example, if your child colors on the wall, take away all the crayons and explain that he can try again later to play with crayons.\n\nStay in control and do not give in to unreasonable requests. For example, when it is time to eat or go to bed, take away toys.\n\nWhen children are upset about being disciplined, allow time for both you and them to calm down before trying to talk to them about their behavior. Let them know you understand how they feel, but that certain behavior is not acceptable.\n\nAvoid problem situations. If your child is likely to become unreasonable when he’s hungry, remember to carry snacks with you\n\nWhen to be Concerned\n\nAccording to the American Academy of Pediatrics, you should let your doctor know if at 24 months your child:\n\nCannot push a wheeled toy\n\nDoesn’t follow simple directions\n\nDoesn’t imitate actions or words\n\nFails to develop a heel-toe walking pattern after several months of walking or walks exclusively on toes\n\nDoesn’t speak at least 15 words\n\nDoesn’t use two-word sentences\n\nYour Child at Four Years Old\n\nFOUR-YEAR-OLDS MAY NOT BE GROWING PHYSICALLY AS FAST AS THEY DID AS AN INFANT, but they are making leaps and bounds both socially and emotionally. Your child can be easily frustrated, but is learning to gain self control. You can help by providing encouragement and support while maintaining patience during those frustrating moments.\n\nSleep\n\nFour-year-olds need at least 12 hours of sleep a day. They may or may not be napping; it all depends on the child. It is common for four-year-olds to get out of bed at night with many excuses not to go to sleep. The best thing to do is stick to the bedtime routine and when your little ones need a drink for the sixth time, be calm but firm with them and let them know it is bedtime and that you will see them in the morning.\n\nNutrition\n\nProper nutrition includes:\n\nThree meals a day, plus two nutritious snacks\n\nLimiting high sugar and high fat foods\n\nEating fruits, vegetables, lean meats and low fat dairy products\n\nPhysical Development\n\nWalks backwards\n\nJumps forwards many times\n\nWalks up and down stairs\n\nSomersaults\n\nUses safety scissors\n\nCuts on line continuously\n\nCopies squares and crosses\n\nPrints a few capital letters\n\nDraws a person\n\nSocial and Emotional Development\n\nEnjoys playing with other children\n\nTakes turns and shares (most of the time); may still be rather bossy\n\nSeeks out adult approval\n\nUnderstands and obeys simple rules (most of the time)\n\nLikes to talk and carries on detailed conversations\n\nUnderstands jealousy\n\nFears the dark and monsters\n\nBegins to understand danger\n\nHas difficulty separating make-believe from reality\n\nFeels anger and frustration and may still throw tantrums\n\nEnjoys pretending\n\nHas a vivid imagination and sometimes imaginary playmates\n\nCognitive Development\n\nGroups and matches objects\n\nOrganizes materials\n\nAsks “why” and “how”\n\nTells their own name and age\n\nPays attention for longer periods of time\n\nLearns by watching and listening\n\nShows awareness of past and present\n\nFollows a series of two to four directions\n\nPoints to and names colors\n\nUnderstands order and process\n\nCounts to five\n\nKnows the names of their street and town\n\nADDITIONAL SAFETY TIPS FOR YOUR THREE YEAR OLD\n\nA Home Safety Checklist should be completed at each stage of your child’s development.\n\nAlways supervise while your child is in and around water—both in and outside of the home > Teach pedestrian behavior such as crossing streets and using sidewalks and crosswalks\n\nIf you must have a gun in the house, keep it separate from the bullets in a different locked place\n\nPositive Parenting Activities that Promote Nurturing and Attachment\n\nYour child is quickly leaving behind baby behaviors. There are new skills your children must learn and behaviors they are learning to control. They are beginning to solve problems and learning to follow rules. How are they processing all this new information? They are imitating the adults around them as they begin to understand many different functions in their world.\n\nGive your child a specific chore in the house that needs to be done each day; like feeding the fish, helping set the table, cleaning up toys or checking the mail.\n\nTeach them to always say please and thank you when asking for something.\n\nTeach the importance of not interrupting others when they are speaking unless it is something important.\n\nChildren this age need to learn healthy ways to deal with anger and the importance of self-control. Children may feel very angry and not understand how to let it out. Help them label their emotions and explain that it is ok to feel that way, but that we must still follow all the rules.\n\nWhen to be Concerned\n\nAccording to the American Academy of Pediatrics, you should let your doctor know if at four years old your child:\n\nStill clings or cries whenever his parents leave him\n\nShows no interest in interactive games\n\nIgnores other children\n\nDoesn’t respond to people outside the family\n\nDoesn’t engage in fantasy play\n\nResists dressing, sleeping or using the toilet\n\nLashes out without any self-control when angry or upset\n\nCannot copy a circle\n\nDoesn’t use sentences of more than three words\n\nDoesn’t use “me” and “you” appropriately\n\nCan’t tell the difference between fantasy and reality\n\nCannot understand two-part commands\n\nHealthy Social Development and Bullying Prevention\n\nTEACHING CHILDREN HOW TO INTERACT WITH OTHERS IN HEALTHY WAYS will benefit them not only at school, but also throughout their lives. It will also help them recognize inappropriate behaviors such as bullying. Bullying is a pattern of aggressive behavior that makes another person feel hurt, degraded, threatened or humiliated. Some examples of bullying include name calling, pushing, leaving others out of an activity and vandalizing personal possessions. Cyberbullying occurs when these activities take place through computer communications and the internet.\n\nIt is important to help your child understand what bullying is and what they can do if they are bullied or see others being bullied. All kids involved in bullying whether they are bullied, bully others, or see bullying—can be affected. It is important to support all kids involved to make sure the bullying doesn’t continue and effects can be minimized.\n\nYou can help your children develop social skills and form healthy relationships with their peers by:\n\nProviding a safe and healthy atmosphere at home\n\nKeeping the lines of communication open between family members\n\nEncouraging them to play with other children outside school hours, hosting sleepovers, and joining clubs and groups\n\nTeaching your child what qualities to look for in a friend, such as someone who makes them feel comfortable and likes them for who they are\n\nPracticing conversation skills like asking questions and listening and explaining the kinds of comments that might upset others, lead to teasing and get in the way of making friends—for example, ‘Your hair is always messy’\n\nTalking about how different situations at school and with friends might be handled—for example, ‘Maybe if you shared your new toy it might help.’ or ‘Smiling makes people feel happier. It helps if you smile when you first meet people.’\n\nTalking with your child about what bullying is, why bullying is wrong and what they can do if they witness their peers being bullied\n\nTeaching children not to participate in teasing or hurting other children\n\nTeaching children that reporting bullying is different from tattling on someone bullying hurts someone and can be stopped\n\nEncouraging children to seek help from teachers or other adults if they see someone being bullied (If they are scared to tell by themselves, they should seek help with a friend or even an older sibling)\n\nIs Your Child Being Bullied?\n\nMany times kids won’t ask for help, so it is important to know what to look for. If your child is at immediate risk of harming himself or others, get help right away.\n\nChildren react to bullying in different ways. Some signs that a child is being bullied may include:\n\nShy, insecure, suffers from low self-esteem\n\nTorn articles of clothing or missing belongings\n\nUnexplainable bruises, cuts or scrapes\n\nFear of going to school or participating in organized activities\n\nAnxious or depressed when returning home from school\n\nQuiet or seems withdrawn\n\nComplains of illness such as stomachaches\n\nChanges in eating or sleeping habits\n\nHas trouble sleeping or often has bad dreams\n\nHere are some tips to help your child if he or she is being bullied:\n\nListen to what your child says\n\nSupport your child by talking about how to solve the problem\n\nAvoid blaming your child for provoking the situation; this can make the child feel further victimized and may close the lines of communication\n\nAsk specific questions about what, who, where, and how long the bullying has been happening\n\nEncourage your child to continue being themselves—changing their ways for others is not the right solution to end bullying\n\nTeach your child how to step away from the bullying situations instead of fighting back, which may make matters worse\n\nContact the school, principal or teacher immediately\n\nAvoid these mistakes:\n\nNever tell the child to ignore the bullying.\n\nDo not blame the child for being bullied. Even if he or she provoked the bullying, no one deserves to be bullied.\n\nDo not tell the child to physically fight back against the kid who is bullying. It could get the child hurt, suspended, or expelled.\n\nParents should resist the urge to contact the other parents involved. It may make matters worse. School or other officials can act as mediators between parents.\n\nFollow-up. Show a commitment to making bullying stop. Because bullying is behavior that repeats or has the potential to be repeated, it takes consistent effort to ensure that it stops.\n\nIs Your Child Bullying Others?\n\nSigns a Child is Bullying Others Kids may be bullying others if they:\n\nGet into physical or verbal fights\n\nHave friends who bully others\n\nAre increasingly aggressive\n\nGet sent to the principal’s office or to detention frequently\n\nHave unexplained extra money or new belongings\n\nBlame others for their problems\n\nDon’t accept responsibility for their actions\n\nAre competitive and worry about their reputation or popularity\n\nFinding out your child is a bully may come as a shock. As a parent, you may feel disappointed or angry. Feelings of denial are also common. It is important to remember children act differently in different social settings. Guiding children and teaching them appropriate behavior is a big responsibility.\n\nHere are some useful tips to help STOP your child from bullying others:\n\nTell your child that it is unkind to make others feel unhappy\n\nTell your child that bullying is inappropriate and explain how you expect their behavior to change (making expectations clear helps children recognize desired behavior)\n\nHelp them recognize appropriate social skills and learn the kind of behavior that is appreciated and accepted by praising them for kind acts offered to other children\n\nSpend more time with your child and monitor his or her behavior\n\nSurround your child with positive role models\n\nTeach your child other ways to make and keep friends\n\nSeek help from school counselors\n\nFollow-up. After the bullying issue is resolved, continue finding ways to help the child who bullied to understand how their actions affect other people. For example, praise acts of kindness or talk about what it means to be a good friend.\n\nWhat Can Your Child Do to Help Stop Bullying?\n\nBystanders\n\nEven if a child is not directly involved in bullying, they may be contributing to the behavior. Witnessing the behavior may also affect the child.\n\nHere are some things bystanders can do to stop and prevent bullying:\n\nBe a friend to the person being bullied. Reaching out to the person being bullied by talking to them, sitting with them at lunch or inviting them to play during recess helps them know they are not alone.\n\nTell a trusted teacher, family member or coach. Adults can help stop bullying, but only if they know about it. If your child has already talked to an adult and it appears nothing has changed, you may need to get more adults involved. Teachers, counselors, custodians, nurses and parents can all help to address and prevent bullying.\n\nLend a hand. Bystanders can sometimes help the person being bullied by causing a distraction to draw attention away from the bully, or giving the person being bullied a reason to leave the scene. For example, a bystander could say, “Come on, we need to get to class.” Or “Mr. Smith needs to see you right now.”\n\nSpeak up and walk away. Let those who bully know that it is not funny or entertaining. Don’t provide an audience because that often encourages bullying behavior.\n\nSet a good example. Get involved in anti-bullying campaigns and projects.\n\nCyberbullying\n\nUsing the internet, cell phones, or other electronic means to send or post text or images intended to hurt or embarrass another person is called cyberbullying. Cyberbullying affects almost half of all American teens, but most victims say they have never told a parent or other adult about their negative online experiences.\n\nLike other forms of bullying, teens may engage in cyberbullying because they think that it is harmless or funny, or because the behavior is encouraged by their friends. Teens who might not engage in other forms of bullying may engage in cyberbullying because they believe that their online behavior cannot be tracked or because they are unaware of the serious consequences of their actions.\n\nChildren who are cyberbullied are more likely to use drugs and/or alcohol, skip school, experience in-school bullying, receive poor grades, have lower self-esteem, and experience depression or suicidal thoughts.\n\nSome other early warning signs that a child may be a target of cyberbullying are:\n\nUnexpectedly stop using their devices\n\nSeem anxious when using their device or receiving a notification\n\nAppear angry, depressed or frustrated after going online\n\nLose interest in things that matter most to them\n\nBecome unusually secretive, especially when it comes to online activities\n\nIf your child is being cyberbullied, save all the evidence of the bullying and report the abuse to the website moderator or your internet or cell phone provider. Many websites have a tool to report abuse. This link provides a list of commonly used websites and their individual report links: cyberbullying.org/report/. If bullying continues, alert school officials and the parents of the other children involved so they can help stop it.\n\nYour child could be involved with cyberbullying if they display some of these behaviors:\n\nQuickly switches screens, or hides their device when you are nearby\n\nLaughs indecently at their device, but refuses to show you what is so funny\n\nAppears to be using an account that is not their own\n\nDemonstrates insensitivity towards other teens\n\nAppears overly concerned with maintaining their status in a particular social circle\n\nIt is important to address cyberbullying with your child.\n\nVictim or perpetrator, it is up to us to provide the guidance and support our kids need.

They may argue and fight a great deal with friends. School-aged children need a lot of help learning social skills like how to make friends, trust others, work in a team and resolve conflicts. Children also need to be taught how to use good manners, ask for help and negotiate with others. Often they have to be reminded to carry out homework responsibilities or household chores. Learning self-discipline is an ongoing process that improves each year.\n\nChildren this age have not had much experience in setting and achieving goals or in measuring their own strengths and weaknesses. They need adults to provide experiences that are challenging, yet achievable.\n\nPhysical Development\n\nNeeds vision, dental, and hearing to be checked starting in the first grade\n\nGrows very slowly, so there is a huge range of weight and height differences\n\nNeeds parents to provide a healthy diet as obesity sometimes becomes a problem during middle childhood; fast food should be limited\n\nDevelops coarser skin; freckles and moles may begin to appear\n\nBegins to lose baby teeth\n\nCoordinates many motor skills (jumping, skipping and running)\n\nBegins to focus on “competition” rather than “cooperation”\n\nSocial and Emotional Development\n\nDevelops a greater understanding of themselves and their role in the family, at school and in the community\n\nGains greater control of their emotions and becomes less fearful\n\nLearns to value themselves and develop an overall sense of self-worth\n\nHas opportunities for socializing outside of the family\n\nBegins to worry about making mistakes, being ridiculed or failing in school\n\nInteracts in a give-and-take fashion when playing with peers\n\nPrefers other children who are outgoing and supportive\n\nInteracts more effectively when parents have been affectionate, warm and accepting with them, and less effectively when there is stress in the family\n\nCognitive Development\n\nNeeds clear, concrete and specific directions (there are still limitations in their thinking and parents need keep that in mind)\n\nUses visual cues and objects to help them solve problems\n\nUses reason in logical steps in order to solve problems\n\nHas improved memory\n\nUnderstands cause and effect\n\nUnderstands what is real and what is not real\n\nADDITIONAL SAFETY TIPS FOR YOUR SCHOOL-AGE CHILD\n\nParents need to provide education and supervision to prevent passenger and pedestrian accidents, drowning and serious burns, which are the leading causes of death for school-age children.\n\nAll children whose weight or height is above the forward-facing limit for their car seat should use a belt-positioning booster seat until the vehicle seat belt fits properly. This is typically when they have reached 4 feet 9 inches in height and are between 8 and 12 years old. Children under the age of 13 should always ride in the back seat.\n\nTexting, talking or listening to music through earbuds is distracting and prevents students from seeing and responding to dangerous situations. Make sure your children put away their phones and other electronics when walking, biking or using other forms of transportation so they can pay attention to their surroundings.\n\nMake sure your child’s bicycle, skateboard, scooter or skates are the right size for your child and that your child knows traffic and pedestrian rules and always wears a helmet.\n\nTeach your children how to swim and remind them about water safety around the home and while visiting friends and neighbors.\n\nTeach your children about the dangers of playing with matches and lighters and the safety rules for using barbecues and stoves.\n\nPositive Parenting Activities that Promote Nurturing and Attachment\n\nParents and caregivers can develop or maintain close bonds with their school age children by playing an active role in their children’s lives. Being involved in their activities, education and friendships and providing positive and developmentally appropriate discipline are important to bonding and attachment.\n\nWhen your child wants to talk, turn off the television, put your phone down and give your child your undivided attention.\n\nAttend your child’s sporting events, chaperone a class field trip or volunteer together in the community.\n\nTake advantage of The Most Important 8 Minutes of the Day. This idea comes from Gary Benton, a parent trainer in Washington. The first 4 minutes of the day and the last 4 minutes at night are a time to reconnect. Make those minutes count by making eye contact and providing reassuring touch, such as a pat on the hand or a kiss.\n\nDad and award-winning author of Love Limits, Bill Corbett, suggests that you make bonding a part of the bedtime routine by asking kids three questions while tucking them into bed: 1. What is the best thing that happened to you today? 2. What is the worst thing that happened to you today? 3. What is the silliest thing that happened to you today? “Accept whatever they provide as answers, and don’t say anything that might devalue them,” he says. “If they struggle in the beginning with coming up with answers, just let it go. If they detect you’re doing something different, it might feel uncomfortable to them and they might answer ‘nothing’ [but], this simple exercise will bring the parent and the child closer together.”\n\nWhen to be Concerned\n\nChildren develop at various rates, but if your child’s physical, emotional or cognitive development appears to be outside the normal range, talk to a healthcare provider. Talking to your child, their teachers and their friends’ parents will help you learn about any possible problems your child may be having. Pay attention to your child’s behavior. Children often show you more than they tell you. You may need to seek help for your child if he or she:\n\nHas trouble paying attention and concentrating\n\nOften disrupts classroom activities\n\nDoes poorly in school\n\nFrequently gets into fights with other children at school\n\nReacts to disappointments, criticism or teasing with extreme, intense anger, blame or revenge\n\nHas few friends and is often rejected by other children because of his or her behavior\n\nWithdraws socially\n\nMakes friends with other children known to be unruly or aggressive\n\nIs not sensitive to the feelings of others\n\nIs cruel or violent toward pets or other animals\n\nManaging Your Child’s Use of Multimedia\n\nFrom television and radio to video games, social media and cell phones, our kids are “plugged in” more than ever before. Multimedia tools can be a valuable source of information, entertainment and communication. However, excessive use of media can lead to obesity, interfere with sleep and school, and lead to aggressiveness and other behavior problems. Education and parent involvement can help kids benefit from technology while also protecting them from danger. Here are some ideas you can use to help your child use media responsibly, followed by a few websites you can visit for more ideas and information.\n\nEXPLAIN SAFETY RULES. When children know what you expect of them and have clear, consistent consequences for not following rules, they are more likely to follow rules and avoid dangerous situations.\n\nIf young children are searching for information online, it is a good idea to assist them during the search process and then let them navigate the sites once you are sure they are safe.\n\n• Personal Information-Let your children know that it is dangerous to reveal any personal information about themselves to someone they meet online. This includes their names, where they live, their ages, the school they attend or where their parents work. Tell them to let you know if someone is asking for this information while they are online. Be sure to praise them when they follow through with this rule. Also, tell your children it is never a good idea to share user names, logins or passwords with friends or people they chat with online. This is personal information and should not be shared.\n\n• Pictures-Do not allow your children to send any pictures of themselves to someone online without your permission.\n\n• Meeting in Real Life-Tell your children never to get together with someone they meet online without your permission. If your children make a friend online they wish to meet in person, go with them to a public place to meet the person.\n\n• Cyberbullying-Have your child agree never to post anything that is mean to another person online. If someone sends your child a nasty message, tell them to let you know so that you can report it to the website.\n\nKEEP THE COMPUTER IN A COMMON ROOM. When everyone in the house can see the screen, there is a better chance kids will follow the rules of online safety. Children who have computers with internet access in their bedrooms are more likely to come across inappropriate content online.\n\nSUPERVISE. Just as we want to know where our children are physically, who they are with and what they are doing, we need to know where they are going on the internet and whom they are meeting there. When kids are first learning about the internet, use the internet with them.\n\nRESPECTFULLY MONITOR ONLINE ACTIVITY. Online activities are unrestricted and open for your review. Checking up on children online for their safety is very different from looking through their rooms for their private diaries. What is available about your children online could place them at risk, while personal thoughts they journal and keep to themselves allow for healthy self-expression and reflection.\n\nSocial Media Preteens should not have accounts on major social media sites. If you have young children, you can create accounts for them on sites that are designed specifically for kids their age. If you want to see if your children have online profiles, such as Instagram or Facebook, you can search the internet by inserting your children’s names, or their friends’ names, into a search engine like Google. If your children have online profiles, let them know you need to see them, perhaps tomorrow. Give them a chance to look at their profiles and think about the content. Learn about social media privacy settings and help your children understand how to use these settings to protect their private information and reduce their “digital footprint.” Tell them to never accept “friend requests” from people they do not know.\n\nBrowser History Check your computer’s history. This will tell you what websites were viewed recently. However, many children and adolescents know how to clear a browser history or delete records of certain websites. Fewer children will clear cookie files. If the history is consistently empty, your computer may be set to automatically delete the history each time you exit out of the internet. This is a feature that you can easily disable.\n\nFiltering/Monitoring Software Check with your Internet service provider to see what free filtering and monitoring options are available. Software can track how much time kids spend online, allow them to access the internet during only certain times of day when you know you will be home, and filter content so children aren’t accidentally exposed to inappropriate content while doing a search on the internet.\n\nSoftware programs can be a big help, but there is no substitute for adult supervision.\n\nSmartphones If your child has a smartphone, ask your cell phone service provider how to filter your child’s internet usage, limit usage and block certain content or phone numbers. You should also password protect your child’s phone and have the screen automatically lock after a few minutes of non-use. Teach them to use the caller ID and not to respond to calls or texts from anyone they do not know.\n\nTALK TO YOUR CHILDREN. Music, television, magazines, and the internet are all sending messages to your children. Balance these messages with what YOU want them to know about different issues. If your children tell you about something they found online that is a concern, DO NOT OVERREACT. Talk to your child about what you know and believe about the issue. Remember to praise your child for coming to you with this information!\n\nBy establishing clear expectations with your children, and supervising and monitoring their online activity, you are being a responsible parent. If you feel your children are hiding their online activities from you, or you believe they might be in danger, it is up to you to find out what is going on\n\nSET GROUND RULES. Agree on what is reasonable for each child, from the amount of time they can spend online each week, to which sites they can visit without permission. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends limiting entertainment screen time to no more than two hours a day.\n\nWebsites with additional information about keeping kids safe online:\n\nWeb Safety Guides\n\nwww.getnetwise.org\n\nwww.ikeepsafe.org\n\nSupervision Tools\n\nwww.netlingo.com\n\nPositive Parenting Tips that Promote Good Behavior in Teens\n\nTeens need positive, caring adults to provide consistent support, guidance, praise and encouragement, as well as a safety net. By supporting them as they mature, you allow teens room to develop their own sense of identity. Teens will gradually gain confidence in their ability to make decisions, but they need to know they can still turn to you for advice.\n\nTo help your teen develop and grow independent, parents and caregivers should:\n\nListen to their teens and try to understand their feelings\n\nTalk to teens in a friendly open way\n\nHelp teens set and achieve realistic goals\n\nExpose teens to diversity and demonstrate how to accept differences\n\nHelp identify possible issues while encouraging teens to practice their decision\n\nmaking skills by:\n\nEncouraging teens to consider the consequences of their actions, both good and bad\n\nDiscussing pros and cons of specific decisions\n\nHelp teens bounce back from poor choices\n\nIt is vital to have good communication with teens. Good communication builds strong relationships. It takes effort to communicate so that everyone is understood. Research from Penn State shares the acronym RECIPE for better communication with adolescents:\n\nR - REFLECTIVE LISTENING. Truly listen to what the other person is saying. Repeat back what you think they said, either exactly or in your own words. By repeating or rephrasing what the speaker said, the speaker knows they have been heard.\n\nE - ENCOURAGE AND UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER. Consider what they are trying to express to you by putting yourself in their “shoes.”\n\nC - COMPROMISE AND COOPERATE WITH EACH OTHER. Find ways to work together rather than argue.\n\nI - “I” MESSAGES KEEP PEOPLE FROM FEELING BLAMED. They help you express your own feelings rather than focusing on the behavior of the other person. For example: “I get very worried when you don’t answer your phone when I call” is better for maintaining healthy communication than “You NEVER answer your phone when I call”.\n\nP - PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE! Good communication is difficult to learn. Expect it to take time to get it right and allow other family members to get it right as well.\n\nE - ENGAGEMENT. Pay full attention to the person speaking to you. It is difficult to hear what is really said if you are doing something else. (Can you really watch television and listen to someone?)\n\nIntroduction: The Building Blocks of Child Development\n\nTHE FOUR MAIN AREAS OF CHILD DEVELOPMENT are physical, social, emotional and cognitive. How well a child’s physical, social and emotional needs are met affects how the child’s brain will grow and develop. Understanding how children grow and learn will help you know what to expect and what you can do to help your child develop.\n\nPhysical Development is the growth of the human body including: height, weight, muscles and the five senses (sight, hearing, taste, touch and smell). Coordination of large and small muscle movements is also part of physical development.\n\nSocial Development is the ability to connect with others, understand rules and develop values, and cooperate as a member of a family, peer group and society.\n\nEmotional Development is the ability to understand and express feelings and control emotions.\n\nCognitive Development is the ability to learn and to use logic and reason to solve problems.\n\nDevelopment in each area is tightly connected. For example, learning to talk requires hearing (physical), the ability to understand different sounds (cognitive), the ability to pay attention (social), and the ability to interact with others (emotional). Failing to develop in one area affects the ability to progress in other areas.\n\nEach child will develop at his or her own rate. Developmental milestones show what a child of that age should be doing. If your child was premature, keep in mind that babies born early usually need a bit more time to meet their milestones. Doctors, nurses, daycare workers and home visitors can help you monitor your child’s development, identify concerns and make referrals for help when needed. Treating issues early can help prevent more serious problems later.\n\nWORTH NOTING\n\nCHILDPROOFING alone will not keep your child safe. Childproofing increases the amount of time it takes for your child to get into a dangerous situation, but it does not replace ADULT SUPERVISION.\n\nYour Newborn's Safety\n\nSAFE INFANT SLEEP\n\nBabies are safest when sleeping alone, on their backs in a crib near their parents’ bed for the first year of life. Suffocation and strangulation in an adult bed is the leading cause of injury-related death for infants under one year of age in the state of Florida. The risk of sleeping-related infant death is 40 times higher for babies who sleep in adult beds compared to babies who sleep in their own cribs.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends the following:\n\nPlace babies on their backs (face up) every time they sleep. Sleeping on the stomach or side increases the risk of suffocation. Once an infant can roll from back to stomach and stomach to back, the infant can remain in the sleeping position they choose.\n\nThe crib mattress should fit tightly in its frame and have a snug fitted sheet\n\nNo other objects should be placed in the crib\n\nThe crib should always be placed in a room that is smoke free\n\nOffering a pacifier has also been linked to a decreased risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS)\n\nIf breastfeeding, wait until breastfeeding is well-established before offering a pacifier.\n\nIf you bring your baby into bed for feeding or comforting, please put them back in their own crib or bassinet when you are ready to return to sleep.\n\nKeep the room temperature of your baby’s sleeping area comfortable for a lightly clothed adult. This will help keep your baby from getting too hot or overheated.\n\nOver-bundling should be avoided due to the possibility of overheating. Infants are typically comfortable with one layer more than an adult would wear to be comfortable in the same environment.\n\nNever prop a bottle at naptime or bedtime.\n\nIf your baby has a crib, lower the mattress when your baby learns to sit, and again when he learns to stand.\n\nRespond to your baby’s cries during the night.\n\nImportant Information!\n\nSleeping with your baby is dangerous. Even if your baby is breastfed and you don’t smoke, drink alcohol or use drugs or other medications, sleeping with your baby still increases your baby’s risk of suffocation or strangulation while sleeping. The only way to protect your baby from higher risk is to have your baby sleep alone in a crib.\n\n10 TIPS TO HELP YOUR BABY SLEEP AT NIGHT\n\nMake sure your baby has active playtime, such as “tummy time,” during the day.\n\nRespond to your baby’s needs quickly during the day to reduce your baby’s stress.\n\nAllow for skin-to-skin contact during the day.\n\nKeep a consistent schedule for meals, naps and bedtime.\n\nUse a bedtime routine of three or four relaxing activities to help your baby wind down (giving your baby a bath, gently massaging muscles, and then spending a short period of quiet time together). Research has shown that babies who have a bedtime routine fall asleep 30% faster, wake up 50% less often, and sleep for longer stretches of time.\n\nTalk or sing softly to your baby before bed. Just the sound of your voice is very soothing to your baby.\n\nPut your baby in the crib when he or she begins to look tired, but is still awake. Putting babies to bed while they are tired, but still awake, helps them learn to fall asleep on their own.\n\nIf your baby seems restless at bedtime, put your baby to bed 30 minutes earlier. When babies become overtired, they sometimes become energetic and fight off sleep.\n\nPlay soft music, turn on a fan or put a ticking clock near your baby’s crib. Listening to repetitive sounds lulls babies off to sleep.\n\nContinuing normal household activities while babies sleep helps them learn to sleep without silence.\n\nPlace a warm towel down on your baby’s sheet and remove it just before you place your baby down.\n\nIf you have tried all of these suggestions and your baby is still not sleeping well, talk to your baby’s nurse or doctor. There may be a medical reason for your baby’s restless nights.\n\nPositive Parenting Activities that Promote Nurturing and Attachment\n\nBreastfeeding\n\nResponding promptly to your baby’s cries\n\nRocking, singing and comforting your baby\n\nMaintaining loving relationships with other caregivers\n\nKeeping primary caregivers consistent over time so attachments can form\n\nOTHER SAFETY TIPS FOR NEWBORNS\n\nA Home Safety Checklist should be completed at each stage of your child’s development.\n\nMost infant falls are from furniture. Help prevent falls by:\n\nNever leaving your baby unsupervised on any surface above the floor\n\nAlways using the safety belts on changing tables, bouncy seats and swings\n\nMost burns in children under five are caused by scalding liquids. Help prevent burns by:\n\nSetting your hot water heater to 120 degrees Fahrenheit or below\n\nNever carrying hot liquids while carrying your infant\n\nNever warming baby bottles in the microwave—microwaves heat unevenly and your baby may be burned by hot spots\n\nDrowning can happen quickly and silently. Help prevent drowning by:\n\nAlways staying with your baby during bath time\n\nNever leaving an older child to watch your baby near the water\n\nMany everyday items can cause choking or suffocation in infants. Help prevent choking and suffocation by:\n\nRemoving small objects and plastic bags from your baby’s environment\n\nKeeping balloons, blind cords and strings away from your baby\n\nYou can keep your infant safe and help prevent motor vehicle injuries by:\n\nAlways placing your newborn in a rear-facing infant car seat whenever you travel in a vehicle\n\nNever leaving your infant alone in the car—even in mild weather, the temperature inside a car can reach dangerous levels in minutes\n\nYour Child at One to Two Months\n\nYOUR BABY IS GROWING VERY QUICKLY AND LEARNING A LOT.\n\nYour baby’s brain is developing through a series of back and forth interactions. Babies and young children naturally reach out for interaction by babbling and making facial expressions. By consistently responding to these efforts in a warm and loving way, you are creating a nurturing environment. At this age, it’s important to spend a lot of time cuddling, playing, reading and talking with your baby. Over time, these interactions help infants form strong attachments with their parents. These early attachments create patterns for the way the child connects with people later in life.\n\nSleep\n\nAlthough your baby is sleeping for longer stretches of time (4–6 hours), it is still too early to have a set sleep schedule. There are some activities that may help your baby learn to be more active during the day and encourage nighttime sleep.\n\nNutrition\n\nAt this age, your child only needs breast milk or formula. Your baby is not ready for cereal or any solid food at this age. Babies usually need 4 to 5 ounces of breast milk or formula per feeding, or 20 to 25 ounces per day.\n\nPhysical Development – Your baby will:\n\nWiggle and use body language to tell you how he feels\n\nUse muscles in her arms and legs to grab or kick at toys or people\n\nHold his head up on his own, but still need your careful support when being held\n\nSocial and Emotional Development – Your baby should:\n\nSmile at you when he wants to play\n\nFrown or cry to show sadness\n\nRespond with pleasure when her primary caregiver arrives\n\nCopy your movements and facial expressions\n\nLike to be around other children\n\nCognitive Development – Your baby will:\n\nUse taste, touch, smell, sight and sound to learn about his environment\n\nCry when hungry, needing to be changed or wanting attention\n\nMake cooing sounds to get your attention, and will coo even more when you respond\n\nMake different sounds to tell you if he is hungry, wet, tired or wants a change of position\n\nRecognize mother or primary caregiver\n\nFollow moving objects with her eyes\n\nADDITIONAL SAFETY TIPS FOR YOUR BABY AT TWO MONTHS\n\nA Home Safety Checklist should be completed at each stage of your child’s development.\n\nHelp prevent fires by keeping nightlights at least three feet away from the crib, bedding and draperies; never heat your home by leaving the oven on or use candles for light.\n\nHelp prevent poisoning by removing poisonous plants in and around the home.\n\nHelp prevent burns from hot car seat surfaces by using window shades or covering your baby’s car seat with a light blanket when the car is parked.\n\nPositive Parenting Activities that Promote Nurturing and Attachment\n\nAlways respond to your baby’s cries and try to figure out what your baby is trying to say to you\n\nWhen you hear your baby cooing, coo, sing or talk in return\n\nHold and touch your baby as much as possible\n\nLook into your baby’s eyes and talk to your baby during feedings and diaper changes\n\nPractice being patient. Having patience is very important for your child’s overall development. Babies are just learning what is in the world; it will take time before they know how to behave in it!\n\nWhen to be Concerned\n\nWhile each baby develops at his or her own pace, you should be aware of certain milestones your child should be reaching. Failure to reach certain milestones may be a sign of medical or developmental problems requiring special attention. You should let your baby’s doctor know if your child:\n\nDoesn’t seem to respond to loud sounds\n\nDoesn’t notice hands by two months\n\nDoesn’t smile at the sound of your voice by two months\n\nDoesn’t follow moving objects with eyes by three months\n\nDoesn’t grasp and hold objects by three months\n\nDoesn’t smile at people by three months\n\nCannot support head well by three months\n\nDoesn’t reach for and grasp toys by months\n\nDoesn’t babble by four months\n\nYour Child at Three to Six Months\n\nTHIS IS AN EXCITING PERIOD OF DEVELOPMENT because your baby will begin to show his or her unique personality. Babies this age also begin to establish regular eating and sleeping patterns. Continue cuddling, playing, reading and talking with your baby as much as you can because every interaction will continue to stimulate brain development. Your baby needs an interested audience and a chance to use his or her social skills!\n\nSleep\n\nAt this age, babies sleep about 15 hours per day. Your baby may be taking two or three daytime naps and may be waking twice per night for feedings. Although babies can now roll over on their own, you should still place your baby to sleep on his or her back. It’s fine if babies roll over on their own during sleep. Now is a good time to lower the crib mattress to its lowest level to prevent falls. Remember, it is still not safe to put toys, pillows or blankets in the crib with your baby.\n\nNutrition\n\nDiscuss your baby’s nutritional needs with your medical provider during your baby’s four-month well-child visit. Breast milk and formula are still the main sources of nutrition.\n\nPhysical Development\n\nRolls over from back to stomach and stomach to back\n\nTries to grab objects with hands\n\nOpens and closes hands and brings hands to mouth\n\nWiggles arms and kicks legs\n\nSits with support\n\nDrools a lot\n\nBegins to cut teeth\n\nSocial and Emotional Development\n\nEnjoys social play and will become more active in getting your attention\n\nResponds differently to an unfamiliar voice than to the voice of a familiar person\n\nShows interest in mirror images and begins to smile at mirrors\n\nResponds to other people’s expressions of emotion and often appears joyful\n\nCries when upset, afraid or scared\n\nCognitive Development\n\nUses eyes and hands together\n\nUses verbal and non-verbal cues to signal needs\n\nExplores objects with mouth\n\nBegins to reach for objects such as rattles, caregiver’s face and mobiles\n\nADDITIONAL SAFETY TIPS FOR YOUR BABY AT THREE TO SIX MONTHS\n\nPrevent strangulation by removing or shortening any cords that your child can reach\n\nPrevent electrocution by installing protective covers on all electrical outlets\n\nPrevent poisoning by moving all poisonous liquids, such as cleaning supplies, to upper cabinets and shelves\n\nPrevent falls by keeping babies away from open windows and installing window guards on all upper-level windows\n\nPositive Parenting Activities that Promote Nurturing and Attachment\n\nSinging while interacting with your baby, such as patty-cake and peek-a-boo\n\nRocking your baby while singing lullabies\n\nWhen to be Concerned\n\nWhile each baby develops at his or her own pace, you should be aware of certain milestones your child should be reaching. Failure to reach certain milestones may be a sign of medical or developmental problems requiring special attention. You should let your baby’s doctor know if at four months your child:\n\nDoesn’t bring objects to mouth\n\nBegins babbling, but doesn’t try to imitate any of your sounds\n\nDoesn’t push down with legs when feet are placed on a firm surface\n\nHas trouble moving one or both eyes in all directions\n\nCrosses eyes most of the time (occasional crossing of the eyes is normal in these first months)\n\nDoesn’t pay attention to new faces, or seems very frightened by new faces or surroundings\n\nYour Child at Nine to Twelve Months\n\nBY THE END OF THE FIRST YEAR OF LIFE, your baby’s body weight will have tripled and body length will have doubled. Babies this age are very good at expressing their feelings with their gestures, sounds and facial expressions. They can engage in “conversation,” for example, handing things back and forth or imitating sounds and actions. They also understand “cause and effect”—and that they can make something happen: “If I drop this food from my highchair, it will fall on the floor,” or “If I cry, mom or dad will come get me.” Following a consistent routine helps babies know what to expect and how to behave.\n\nSleep\n\nThe sleep habits of older babies differ. Some may sleep all night and take one or no naps during the day. Others may wake up in the night but take several naps during the day. By nine months, your baby may be sleeping up to 12 hours at night. Some babies skip a morning nap altogether and start taking one long nap later in the day.\n\nDuring this stage of development, it is normal for babies to cry at bedtime because they feel scared when a parent leaves the room. Establishing a bed time routine that includes quiet activities together will help lessen fear and stress. When putting babies to bed, give them some time to fall asleep on their own. If crying continues, check in on your baby, but do not pick your baby up. Instead, rub your baby’s tummy and talk softly to help your baby relax and fall asleep.\n\nNutrition\n\nBy the time babies are around nine months old, they usually have the ability to pick up foods and feed themselves. They can also begin to learn to drink from a sippy cup. By their first birthday (or soon after) they can be weaned from the bottle. They should be eating three meals a day while still receiving breast milk or formula. If you haven’t already, have your baby join the rest of the family at meals.\n\nServe foods that offer new tastes and textures; but be sure they are soft, easily gummed and digestible. Examples include Cheerios® with small pieces of bananas; pieces of cheese and well-cooked pasta; and steamed vegetables such as zucchini, peas and carrots. Cut foods into safe, bite-sized pieces and avoid any foods that need to be chewed. It is very important to supervise your child constantly during feeding times.\n\nSome babies have food allergies. Signs of an allergic reaction include rashes, hay fever-like symptoms or breathing difficulties (sometimes severe). If your baby shows these or any other symptoms, call your doctor or 9-1-1 immediately. Foods to avoid until after your baby’s first birthday include:\n\nEggs\n\nShellfish\n\nCitrus fruits such as oranges, grapefruit, lemon and lime\n\nCorn\n\nPeanuts\n\nChocolate\n\nWheat\n\nHoney\n\nPhysical Development\n\nCrawls forward on belly\n\nSits up without assistance\n\nPulls self up to stand\n\nWalks two or three steps without support\n\nWalks holding onto furniture\n\nTakes objects out of containers\n\nPokes with index finger\n\nCognitive Development\n\nResponds to “no”\n\nBabbles with inflections, changes in tones\n\nMakes sounds like “mama” and “dada”\n\nFinds hidden toys and other objects\n\nBegins to use things correctly (drinks from cups, listens in a phone)\n\nExplores items in different ways (banging, shaking, throwing, etc.)\n\nSocial and Emotional Development\n\nOffers toys or objects to others but wants them back\n\nPushes away toys or foods when not wanted\n\nBecomes attached to a favorite toy or blanket\n\nCries when mom or dad leaves\n\nADDITIONAL SAFETY TIPS FOR YOUR BABY AT NINE TO TWELVE MONTHS\n\nA Home Safety Checklist should be completed at each stage of your child’s development.\n\nPrevent cuts by keeping sharp objects out of reach (for example: cooking knives and other tools, scissors, razors, plastic wrap boxes, glass bottles or drinking glasses, knitting needles)\n\nPrevent injuries by keeping children away from lawn mowers and power saws\n\nPrevent electrocution by putting stereos, computers and other electrical equipment out of reach and making sure that children cannot get to the back of television sets\n\nPrevent poisoning by storing medications where children cannot get them\n\nPositive Parenting Activities that Promote Nurturing and Attachment\n\nPlay games like hide-and-seek and peek-a-boo to help your baby learn to cope with separation and feel secure that you always come back.\n\nRespond to your baby’s cries at night, but avoid picking your baby up to rock him or her back to sleep—falling asleep in your arms makes it more difficult for your baby to learn how to get back to sleep on his or her own.\n\nWhen saying “goodbye,” tell her you will miss her and that you will return.\n\nWhen your baby does something you don’t like or that may be dangerous, distract him or her from the activity by quickly providing something else to do. For example, as your child reaches for a lamp, you quickly pick your child up and say, “Let’s go read this book.”\n\nRedirect unwanted behavior by modeling the right way to use something. For example, if your child is drawing on books, take the books away and say, “Books are not for drawing on.” At the same time, give the child paper saying, “If you want to draw on something, draw on this paper.” If your child is throwing blocks, you can take away the blocks and give him a soft ball to throw.\n\nWhen to be Concerned\n\nWhile each baby develops at his or her own pace, you should be aware of certain milestones your child should be reaching. Failure to reach certain milestones may be a sign of medical or developmental problems requiring special attention. You should let your baby’s doctor know if at nine months your child:\n\nDoesn’t babble\n\nDrags one side of body while crawling (for over a month)\n\nDoesn’t point to objects or pictures\n\nDoesn’t search for objects that are hidden while he or she watches\n\nShows no interest in games like peek-a-boo\n\nShows no affection for primary caregiver\n\nDoesn’t seem to enjoy being around people\n\nTeaching Your Child to Use the Potty\n\nPOTTY TRAINING IS SOMETHING YOU DO WITH YOUR CHILD. You are helping your child learn a very important skill. Teaching your child to use the toilet takes time, understanding and patience. You should not rush your child into using the toilet.\n\nAre YOU ready for potty training? A few things you should think about include:\n\nDo you have enough time to help your child with this difficult job?\n\nAre you already under a lot of stress? For example, do you have a new home, job or relationship? If so, you may need to wait for a better time to begin potty training.\n\nConsistency during potty training is very important. Is your child’s daycare willing to help with potty training?\n\nIs your child showing signs that he or she is ready to learn how to use the toilet?\n\nWhen your child is ready, you’ll see the following signals:\n\nChild has bowel movements at regular times each day.\n\nChild’s diaper stays dry for 2 hours or more.\n\nChild can follow simple instructions such as, “Pick up your truck and put it in the toy box.”\n\nChild shows an interest in using the potty or asks to be changed when diaper is soiled or wet.\n\nThrough words, facial expressions or a change in activity, your child shows you that he or she knows when a bowel movement is coming.\n\nMost children reach this stage sometime between 18 and 36 months, but it’s also normal for it to occur a little later. Early learning is possible, but not always best. It may be stressful for a child who does not have good bowel or bladder control, or the ability to take clothes off quickly to use the toilet. If your child is not ready, you can still teach him or her what a potty chair is and how it works.\n\nWhen you and your child begin potty training, praise him or her for trying. Do not be upset when “accidents” happen. Punishing a child for having an “accident” will only make the child feel bad, and training will take longer. The best way to teach your child about using the toilet is to let him or her watch other family embers of the same sex (watching people of the opposite sex may be confusing). Boys usually learn to urinate in the sitting position but slowly transfer to standing after watching the “older boys” do it that way.\n\nFIRST STEPS\n\nPut a potty chair in your child’s room or in the bathroom. (Both girls and boys may be able to use adult toilets outfitted with training seats.) Then do the following:\n\nFor the first few weeks, let your child sit on the potty with clothes on while you explain what the toilet is and when to use it.\n\nOnce your child is used to sitting on the potty, try it with the diaper off. Make the potty part of the daily routine, slowly increasing from one time to several times each day.\n\nTry changing your child’s diaper while he or she is seated on the potty. Dropping the contents of the dirty diaper into the potty helps your child understand what the potty is for.\n\nLet your child play near the potty without a diaper and remind him or her to use the potty as needed. Children may forget or miss at first, but don’t get angry. Wait until he or she goes correctly and reward and praise your child\n\nLike most children, your own toddler probably will take a little longer to complete nap and nighttime control. The best approach is to have your toddler to use the potty right before going to bed and as soon as he or she wakes up. Using training pants instead of diapers at naptime and bedtime may help. There will be a few accidents, but a plastic sheet between the mattress and the bedding will keep the mattress dry. All children have these accidents. Praise your child whenever he or she makes it through the nap or night without wetting. Tell your child to call for you if he or she wakes up in the middle of the night and needs help to use the toilet.\n\nYour Child at 18 to 24 Months\n\nIMITATION AND INDEPENDENCE ARE BIG THEMES when it comes to the end of your child’s second year. At 18 to 24 months, children are more aware of themselves as individuals. Their sense of independence grows as they start to walk, run and climb more easily. Your young child is developing thinking skills and has an increased curiosity about the nature of people and things. You may notice your child’s problem-solving and memory skills improve. He or she may also be finding it easier to understand and respond to simple requests.\n\nAt this age, children will identify with their toys and will not want to share them. They may begin to show frustration when they cannot do what they want, but can usually be redirected to other interesting alternatives. It can help to offer choices rather than having to always say “no.”\n\nSleep\n\nMost toddlers sleep about 14 hours a day. They often take one nap a day, usually from about 1 to 3 pm, and go to bed between 6 and 8 pm. It is still important to sleep during the day. If children are well rested, they fall asleep easier and sleep longer during the night.\n\nNutrition\n\nBy 18 months, toddlers should eat most table foods cut into small pieces, drink from a sippy cup and be fully weaned from a bottle. Because toddlers may not be interested in sitting still for meals, you can make sure your toddler gets enough food by:\n\nGiving five to six small meals per day\n\nOffering finger foods toddlers can feed themselves\n\nMaking meals fun by serving foods with a variety of colors, textures and tastes\n\nPhysical Development\n\nWalks well and runs, though may not always stop and turn well\n\nTosses or rolls balls\n\nEnjoys moving on small-wheeled riding toys\n\nFeeds self with a spoon\n\nBegins to gain some control of bowels and bladder\n\nSocial and Emotional Development\n\nImitates actions\n\nGets angry and may have temper tantrums\n\nActs shy around strangers\n\nHas trouble sharing\n\nShows signs of independence, like saying “no” and trying to do many things on his or her own\n\nCognitive Development\n\nRefers to self by name and uses the words “me” and “mine”\n\nSays 30 to 50 words\n\nCopies single words spoken by someone else and uses the words “please” and “thank you” if asked\n\nChooses between two objects\n\nEnjoys humming or trying to sing familiar songs\n\nUses two- to three-word sentences\n\nADDITIONAL SAFETY TIPS FOR YOUR BABY AT 18 TO 24 MONTHS\n\nA Home Safety Checklist should be completed at each stage of your child’s development.\n\nPrevent climbing accidents by using “L” brackets to secure large objects and furniture and installing window guards to prevent your child from falling out\n\nReduce the risk of injuries from falls by seeking out playgrounds with soft surfaces like sand, woodchips or rubber\n\nPrevent poisoning by never referring to vitamins or medicine as candy\n\nPrevent burns by keeping matches and lighters out of children’s reach and avoiding use of portable heaters in rooms where children play or sleep.\n\nPositive Parenting Activities that Promote Nurturing and Attachment\n\nPraise good behavior\n\nIgnore small incidents and accidents, such as spilled milk\n\nGive your child the opportunity to correct misbehavior by giving a second chance\n\nNever use spanking or other physical punishment and limit your use of the word “no”\n\nModel good behavior\n\nTalk and read to your child every day to encourage language development\n\nWhen you leave, give your child an object that will soothe him and make him feel close to you\n\nTo encourage good behavior from your child, you should try to be patient as well as clear and consistent with your rules and consequences\n\nWhen to be Concerned\n\nAccording to the American Academy of Pediatrics, you should let your doctor know if at 18 months your child:\n\nCannot walk\n\nFails to develop a mature heel-toe walking pattern after several months of walking, or walks exclusively on toes\n\nDoes not speak at least 15 words\n\nDoes not seem to know the function of common household objects (brush, telephone, fork and spoon)\n\nYour Child at Three Years Old\n\nWITH YOUR CHILD’S THIRD BIRTHDAY, the “terrible twos” are officially over and the “magic years” of three and four begin—a time when your child’s world will be dominated by fantasy and vivid imagination. During the next two years, your child will mature in many areas.\n\nSleep\n\nGoodbye naptime, hello bedtime struggles. Between the ages of three and four, children commonly give up their afternoon naps. Your child should sleep anywhere from 9 to 13 hours each day. As a way of gaining control of their world, children sometimes try to resist bedtime. You can help make bedtime easier by:\n\nSticking with the bedtime routine\n\nAllowing your child to make some choices, like picking out pajamas or books to read\n\nProviding a sense of security with night lights, security blankets or stuffed animals\n\nNutrition\n\nAt this age, your child’s eating habits should be similar to yours. He or she should eat the same foods at the same times as you, and use child-size utensils. Choking is still a hazard because your child has not yet mastered chewing and swallowing. Avoid foods such as hard candies and cherries with pits and make portion sizes small, especially when serving:\n\nGrapes (cut them in half)\n\nHot dogs (slice in half across and lengthwise)\n\nRaw vegetables, such as carrots and celery\n\nPeanut butter (avoid spoonfuls)\n\nPhysical Development\n\nThrows and kicks balls\n\nDraws circles and squares\n\nBegins to copy capital letters\n\nDresses and undresses\n\nSocial and Emotional Development\n\nCooperates with other children\n\nEngages in fantasy play\n\nUnderstands there are ways to solve problems\n\nCognitive Development\n\nIdentifies “same” and “different” objects\n\nTalks in short sentences others can understand\n\nTells and remembers parts of stories\n\nADDITIONAL SAFETY TIPS FOR YOUR THREE YEAR OLD\n\nA Home Safety Checklist should be completed at each stage of your child’s development.\n\nChildren who have reached the weight or height limit on their rear-facing car seat should use a forward-facing car seat with a five-point harness until they each the weight or height limit allowed by the car seat manufacturer.\n\nNow is also a good time to get your child swimming lessons and to teach playground safety, such as not running in front of or behind swinging children.\n\nPositive Parenting Activities that Promote Nurturing and Attachment\n\nSet a good example for your child. If you want children to be nice to each other or have good eating habits, show them how these things are done. Tell your child why you do things a certain way. Children may not understand everything you say, but they will begin to understand that you have reasons for doing things a\n\ncertain way.\n\nProvide children with simple explanations for your rules or limits and offer alternatives.\n\nIt is 8:00 and time for bed; you may play with the markers again tomorrow.\n\nYou may not have popcorn now because it is dinnertime, you may have some Jell-O for dessert after you are finished with your dinner.\n\nWhen to be Concerned\n\nAccording to the American Academy of Pediatrics, you should let your doctor know if at three years old your child:\n\nCannot throw a ball overhand\n\nCannot jump in place\n\nCannot ride a tricycle\n\nCannot grasp a crayon between thumb and fingers\n\nHas difficulty scribbling\n\nCannot stack four blocks\n\nYour Child at Five Years Old\n\nFIVE-YEAR-OLDS WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT HOW THE WORLD WORKS and are usually excited about going to school. They ask more complex questions and offer creative ideas for how to solve problems. They are also more social and prefer active games that involve other children.\n\nSleep\n\nFive-year-olds still need lots of sleep and many will still take a nap. A good bedtime for your five-year-old is 8:00 p.m. during the school year.\n\nNutrition\n\nThe best nutrition advice is to set a good example! Keeping your children healthy includes encouraging them to:\n\nEat a variety of foods\n\nbalance the food you eat with physical activity\n\nChoose a diet with plenty of grain products, vegetables and fruits; moderate amounts of sugar and salt and little fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol\n\nChoose a diet that provides enough calcium and iron to meet their growing body’s requirements\n\nPhysical Development\n\nAssists in making own bed\n\nColors within the lines\n\nTies own shoes\n\nJumps rope\n\nSocial and Emotional Development\n\nIs aware of gender\n\nSeparates fantasy from reality\n\nIs sometimes demanding, sometimes eagerly cooperative\n\nComforts friends and others when they are sad\n\nUnderstands there are rules when playing games\n\nExpresses feelings\n\nWants to please friends\n\nWants to be like friends\n\nAgrees to rules\n\nLikes to sing, dance and act\n\nShows more independence\n\nCognitive Development\n\nUses past, present and future tenses correctly\n\nGroups similar objects together\n\nUnderstands the idea of today, tomorrow and yesterday\n\nIdentifies most letters and numbers\n\nADDITIONAL SAFETY TIPS FOR YOUR FIVE YEAR OLD\n\nA Home Safety Checklist should be completed at each stage of your child’s development.\n\nPractice water safety by teaching your child to swim. Do not let your child play around any water (lake, pool, ocean, etc.) without adult supervision (even if he is a good swimmer). Always wear a life preserver or safety vest when on a boat and childproof the pool by enclosing it in a fence with a self-closing, self-latching door.\n\nTeach your child how to dial 9-1-1\n\nSet a good example for your child by always using a seat belt, helmet, etc.\n\nPositive Parenting Activities that Promote Nurturing and Attachment\n\nExpressing appreciation for kind and thoughtful behavior is another way to set a good example for children. By reinforcing children’s kind behavior, you are helping them to understand that their kindness makes a positive difference. For example, “Emily, I’m really glad that you shared your toy with Ryan. See how much he likes playing with it?” Children need to know that the adults in their lives care about them and about others. Children who experience respect and appreciation from adults are more likely to demonstrate caring toward others.\n\nResearch says that harsh physical punishment can weaken children’s trust in adults. Physical punishment does not help children learn self-control. When adults use physical discipline, children feel angry at adults and ashamed of themselves. When young children experience consistent and positive guidance, they are more likely to act kindly toward others.\n\nWhen to be Concerned\n\nAccording to the American Academy of Pediatrics, you should let your doctor know if at five years old your child:\n\nHas trouble eating, sleeping, dressing or using the toilet\n\nIs extremely fearful or timid\n\nIs extremely aggressive\n\nIs unable to separate from parents without major protest\n\nIs easily distracted and unable to concentrate on any single activity for more than five minutes\n\nShows little interest in playing with other children\n\nRefuses to respond to people in general, or responds only superficially\n\nRarely uses fantasy or imitation in play\n\nSeems unhappy or sad much of the time\n\nDoesn’t engage in a variety of activities\n\nAvoids or seems distant with other children and adults\n\nDoesn’t express a wide range of emotions\n\nCannot build a tower of six to eight blocks\n\nKeeping Your Kids Drug Free\n\nPARENTS CAN MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN THE CHOICES THEIR CHILDREN MAKE. When children know their parents disapprove of using tobacco, alcohol or drugs, they are much less likely to experiment. Do your children know how you feel about these issues?\n\nMost parents find it difficult to talk to their kids about smoking, drinking and using drugs, but substance abuse education should begin at home long before children enter a classroom. Open communication with your children is key to keeping them drug free. It is important to start talking with your children early and to continue emphasizing strong values throughout their teenage years. Here are some tips to help you address substance abuse with your children from an early age.\n\nAGES 5 – 8\n\nChildren of this age need rules to guide their behavior and information to make good choices. They are eager to please and still look to parents for their opinions. Let your children know how you feel about drugs.\n\nAs kids spend more time out in the world, at school and with their friends, they begin to gather messages from lots of new places. They are also more aware of what they hear and read in advertisements, on television and in the movies. Children will need your help as they try to make sense of all that new information.\n\nModel good listening skills by paying attention, allowing your child to speak without being interrupted and repeating back to your children what they said to be sure you understood.\n\nPractice ways to say “no” with your children by describing situations that may make them uncomfortable, such as someone inviting them to ride their bikes in an area you have set as off-limits or someone asking them for help to cheat on a test.\n\nAGES 9 – 11\n\nAs children enter the preteen years, they become very interested in factual information and how things work. They value their friends’ opinions much more and they need to feel accepted by peers. Children need a clear no-use message, factual information and strong motivation to resist peer pressure.\n\nChildren will copy the behavior of their parents. It is hard for children to listen to their parents tell them not to drink or smoke when they see their parents doing it. While children can understand and accept that there are differences between what adults may legally do and what is appropriate and legal for children, do not let your children be involved in your drinking by mixing you a cocktail or bringing you a beer. Never allow your child to have sips of your alcoholic drink.\n\nTeach your kids what to say if they are offered drugs or alcohol by someone. “No thanks, I’m not into that.”\n\nPrepare yourself with the facts so you are able to answer questions about alcohol, tobacco and drugs.\n\nAGES 12 – 14\n\nSince fitting in with peers matters now more than ever, kids are easily influenced by what their friends feel is suitable behavior and are exposed more and more to drugs and drug use. Talking to your child about the direct unpleasant consequences of tobacco and marijuana use, such as bad breath, smelly hair or clothes or yellow teeth, will be more valuable than discussing the longterm consequences. Kids in this age group are more likely to see older kids doing drugs without seeing immediate consequences, so they are less likely to believe a “black-and-white” statement that drugs are bad.\n\nKids this age are establishing their own sense of identity; counteract peer influence with parent influence and let them know:\n\nAlcohol and drugs can cause them to make poor decisions that can prevent them from being accepted into college, being accepted by the military or being hired for certain jobs.\n\nAlcohol and drugs harm judgment and coordination—give real examples, such as consequences from having unprotected sex or being involved in a car accident that causes permanent injury.\n\nSYNTHETIC “DESIGNER” DRUGS\n\nHigh school and college students are now commonly choosing synthetic marijuana or bath salts over marijuana, cocaine and other drugs because they are highly promoted online, are easy to obtain and will not be detected in routine drug tests. Users begin to feel the effects of the drug within 15 minutes and can remain high for up to eight hours. Until recently, these drugs have been legal in many states; however, these drugs are very dangerous. Effects of these designer drugs include severe paranoia and hallucinations that can cause users to harm themselves or others.\n\nK2 AND SPICE\n\nK2 and Spice are street names for synthetic marijuana. This product is sold under a number of trade names such as “Blaze,” “Bliss,” “Black Mamba,” “Bombay Blue,” and “Genie”. Whatever perceptions people have of marijuana, they should not underestimate the risk of this drug or make the mistake that synthetic marijuana is somehow less dangerous than cultivated marijuana. K2/Spice is a mixture of herbs or other plant materials that have been sprayed with artificial chemicals that are supposed to mimic the effects of THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana. One of the signs that parents can look for is a strong clove smell. K2/Spice is typically smoked, so parents may find a coffee grinder around the house—which is often used to reduce the product to a fine powder so that it is easier to smoke—and other drug paraphernalia such as pipes or screens.\n\nBATH SALTS\n\nBath Salts are very different from the product that you put into a bath. The only reason why they have the same name is because the products look similar like a fine powder. Bath salts are a synthetic form of amphetamines and cocaine. The packets are marketed as “bath salts,” “plant food” or even “stain remover” and are available in corner stores, truck stops and online. They come with an often-ignored disclaimer, “not for human consumption.” Bath salts are really a tablet or powder that is snorted, injected or smoked.
