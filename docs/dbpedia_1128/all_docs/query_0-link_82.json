        "text": "England have set up a Euro 2024 semi-final against the Netherlands to evoke memories of one of their finest performances.\n\nAt Euro '96, the Three Lions secured a fantastic 4-1 group-stage victory against the Dutch on their way to the semi-finals of the championships. It was the last time the two faced each other in a major tournament.\n\nWith their last-four tie on Wednesday, BBC Sport looks back at some of England's most memorable performances since then.\n\nYou can scroll to the bottom of this page to rank the games yourself and share your order.\n\nThe moment that made the nation think England could finally win a major tournament again - after their 1966 World Cup triumph - as they came from behind to beat Denmark in extra time.\n\nMikkel Damsgaard scored a stunning free-kick to put the Danes ahead, but Simon Kjaer's own goal levelled the match before the break.\n\nCaptain Harry Kane then slotted home the rebound after his penalty had been saved to complete the turnaround in extra time.\n\nIf one game set Englandâs Euro 2020 alight, this was arguably it. The Three Lions earned their first knockout win against Germany in 55 years to book a quarter-final spot.\n\nThey left it late at Wembley as Raheem Sterling and Kane struck to round off a commanding performance.\n\nYet there were other memorable moments. Thomas Muller missed a glorious chance to equalise for Germany, while Timo Werner and Kai Havertz had shots saved in each half.\n\nIn the end, England ground out a win and instilled a sense of hope that Euro 2020 could finally be the chance to end their trophy drought.\n\nA 19-year-old Theo Walcott shone in Zagreb, scoring his first England goals in superb fashion with a hat-trick in World Cup qualifying.\n\nWayne Rooney also netted to end an 11-month goal drought for his country.\n\nVictory was sweetened by the fact England had missed out on Euro 2008 by losing to Croatia at Wembley 10 months prior.\n\nFabio Capello's side got their revenge in impressive fashion.\n\nMemories of World Cup defeats against Argentina at Mexico â86 and France â98 were painful for England.\n\nBut this group-stage win in Japan went some way to avenging those heartbreaking results.\n\nDavid Beckham stroked home a penalty to seal the victory, while Michael Owen hit the post and Paul Scholes also came close.\n\nThey went on to progress from their group, but were knocked out by eventual winners Brazil in the quarter-finals.\n\nThe last major tournament game against the Netherlands provided one of the best performances in England's footballing history.\n\nBoth teams only needed a point to get out of their group, but Terry Venables's side triumphed in style, scoring four goals in just over an hour.\n\nAlan Shearer scored a 23rd-minute penalty and netted again in the 57th minute, while Teddy Sheringham scored in the 51st and 62nd minutes.\n\nSuch an impressive victory boosted the feel-good fever around England's home tournament.\n\nThey didn't manage to go the distance in the end - losing to Germany in the semis on a penalty shootout - but this impressive group-stage win will always hold a special place in English hearts."
