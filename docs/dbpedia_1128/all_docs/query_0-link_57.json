        "text": "We moved to the area 3 years ago, and everyone here recommended we go to your theatre. We finally did this week and I can't tell you how much we enjoyed the experience. When we got to our seats, 2 people strongly urged us to make reservations for the after show. We finally did, and we were blown away. We encouraged my 25 yo daughter and her boyfriend to go this weekend. My daughter came home and said she thinks it was the best time she's ever had. Now mind you we have enjoyed multiple community theatre's, Broadway NYC, Chicago, Playhouse Square in Cleveland and our experience at your theatre amazed us. Bravo to all. We will be back for sure.\n\nMy daughter-in-law & I saw Mystic Pizza, last night, at the Barn. It was wonderful! The songs, the costumes, & the dancing were so much fun to watch. You could tell that the cast was having a great time as well. Loved it!!\n\nLoved our first experience at the Barn, for Fiddler on the Roof. Wonderful performances! We are so fortunate to have this caliber of talent come to the area. I read the reviews before attending, and was pleasantly surprised that all the seats (vintage theater seats) were padded, there was no \"nosebleed\" section (it's a small venue), and there was plenty of leg room. My only issue was that there was a noticeable musty odor which after a few minutes was not a problem.\n\nRobert Newman did a great job last night. 1st time here. Signage could be a little better to enter the barn. Also I understand keeping things original, but if offered, I would have paid $10 for a cushion for the chair. Have someone design an insert that will work... Guarantee money maker. 3 hours in those chairs was not fun. Hoping to come back for TRHS in September.\n\nReally like the place. My main concern is the size of chairs on the sides. As a 6'4\" person I could not sit down. I feel like this could be fixed by removing one row. The fewer seats and your 50 people are more comfortable.\n\nI've been coming to the Barn Theater with my aunt since I was young. Now, I attend with cousins when I'm in town. It am always impressed with the professionalism of the plays and the down-home personal treatment of this troupe. On the rare occasion that a big name star comes to perform at the Barn, that adds to the excitement of the evening. Thank you one and all for an enjoyable evening.\n\nWhat an experience Iâ€™ve had at the barn theater. It was my very first time being here after hearing about it for years and years. I finally had the chance to go and see The Wizard Of Oz and let me just tell you it was just phenomenal. So much talent and work put into their shows. I also lost my wallet, but they were so kind to call me back and tell me they found it after me worrying about it for the longest time. I canâ€™t wait to be back and not loose my wallet next time of courseðŸ˜‰ thanks for a good show!\n\nEnjoyed the evening, we were there for Baskerville. It was very different from the usual with so few members of the cast playing so many different people. Very good job done by the cast. The Rehearsal Shedd was great as usual.\n\nWe attend 4 to 5 of the shows each season. These young actors are really good and the bar show after the main show really showcases their singing talent. Spectacular! When I heard about the Barn Theater, I attended a show, not expecting it to be great. I was wrong. The actors/entertainers make the experience fabulous. If you enjoy the arts, stop in. You'll be hooked.\n\nI don't think Google maps existed the last time I visited for a show in 2002. So, glad this place is still around and still putting on amazing shows. Such a fun and enjoyable time, can't believe I've stayed away so long. My loss. The Sherlock Holmes show was a blast. About twenty different characters all played by 5 players. And even better than that, it was eighteen characters played by 3 players. The theater is fantastic with amazing air conditioning. A great venue for a fun show any time."
