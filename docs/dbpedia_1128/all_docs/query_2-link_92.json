It is most useful to tackle ill-defined or unknown problems and involves five phases: Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype and Test.\n\nShow Hide video transcript\n\nTranscript loading…\n\nWhy Is Design Thinking so Important?\n\n“Design thinking is a human-centered approach to innovation that draws from the designer's toolkit to integrate the needs of people, the possibilities of technology, and the requirements for business success.”\n\n— Tim Brown, CEO of IDEO\n\nDesign thinking fosters innovation. Companies must innovate to survive and remain competitive in a rapidly changing environment. In design thinking, cross-functional teams work together to understand user needs and create solutions that address those needs. Moreover, the design thinking process helps unearth creative solutions.\n\nDesign teams use design thinking to tackle ill-defined/unknown problems (aka wicked problems). Alan Dix, Professor of Human-Computer Interaction, explains what wicked problems are in this video.\n\nShow Hide video transcript\n\nTranscript loading…\n\nWicked problems demand teams to think outside the box, take action immediately, and constantly iterate—all hallmarks of design thinking.\n\nDon Norman, a pioneer of user experience design, explains why the designer’s way of thinking is so powerful when it comes to such complex problems.\n\nShow Hide video transcript\n\nTranscript loading…\n\nDesign thinking offers practical methods and tools that major companies like Google, Apple and Airbnb use to drive innovation. From architecture and engineering to technology and services, companies across industries have embraced the methodology to drive innovation and address complex problems.\n\nThe End Goal of Design Thinking: Be Desirable, Feasible and Viable\n\nDesirability: Meet People’s Needs\n\nThe design thinking process starts by looking at the needs, dreams and behaviors of people—the end users. The team listens with empathy to understand what people want, not what the organization thinks they want or need. The team then thinks about solutions to satisfy these needs from the end user’s point of view.\n\nFeasibility: Be Technologically Possible\n\nOnce the team identifies one or more solutions, they determine whether the organization can implement them. In theory, any solution is feasible if the organization has infinite resources and time to develop the solution. However, given the team’s current (or future resources), the team evaluates if the solution is worth pursuing. The team may iterate on the solution to make it more feasible or plan to increase its resources (say, hire more people or acquire specialized machinery).\n\nAt the beginning of the design thinking process, teams should not get too caught up in the technical implementation. If teams begin with technical constraints, they might restrict innovation.\n\nViability: Generate Profits\n\nA desirable and technically feasible product isn’t enough. The organization must be able to generate revenues and profits from the solution. The viability lens is essential not only for commercial organizations but also for non-profits.\n\nTraditionally, companies begin with feasibility or viability and then try to find a problem to fit the solution and push it to the market. Design thinking reverses this process and advocates that teams begin with desirability and bring in the other two lenses later.\n\nThe Five Stages of Design Thinking\n\nStanford University’s Hasso Plattner Institute of Design, commonly known as the d.school, is renowned for its pioneering approach to design thinking. Their design process has five phases: Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, and Test. These stages are not always sequential. Teams often run them in parallel, out of order, and repeat them as needed.\n\nShow Hide video transcript\n\nTranscript loading…\n\nStage 1: Empathize—Research Users' Needs\n\nThe team aims to understand the problem, typically through user research. Empathy is crucial to design thinking because it allows designers to set aside your assumptions about the world and gain insight into users and their needs.\n\nStage 2: Define—State Users' Needs and Problems\n\nOnce the team accumulates the information, they analyze the observations and synthesize them to define the core problems. These definitions are called problem statements. The team may create personas to help keep efforts human-centered.\n\nStage 3: Ideate—Challenge Assumptions and Create Ideas\n\nWith the foundation ready, teams gear up to “think outside the box.” They brainstorm alternative ways to view the problem and identify innovative solutions to the problem statement.\n\nStage 4: Prototype—Start to Create Solutions\n\nThis is an experimental phase. The aim is to identify the best possible solution for each problem. The team produces inexpensive, scaled-down versions of the product (or specific features found within the product) to investigate the ideas. This may be as simple aspaper prototypes.\n\nStage 5: Test—Try the Solutions Out\n\nThe team tests these prototypes with real users to evaluate if they solve the problem. The test might throw up new insights, based on which the team might refine the prototype or even go back to the Define stage to revisit the problem.\n\nThese stages are different modes that contribute to the entire design project rather than sequential steps. The goal is to gain a deep understanding of the users and their ideal solution/product.\n\nGet your free template for “Design Thinking: A Non-Linear Process”\n\nSecure form\n\nName Please provide your name.\n\nEmail\n\nWe respect your privacy\n\nPlease provide a valid email address.\n\nGet free UX design learning material every week\n\n318,531 designers enjoy our newsletter—sure you don’t want to receive it?\n\nDesign Thinking Frameworks\n\nThere is no single definition or process for design thinking. The five-stage design thinking methodology described above is just one of several frameworks.\n\nShow Hide video transcript\n\nTranscript loading…\n\nVideo copyright info\n\nHasso-Platner Institute Panorama\n\nLudwig Wilhelm Wall, CC BY-SA 3.0 , via Wikimedia Commons\n\nInnovation doesn’t follow a linear path or have a clear-cut formula. Global design leaders and consultants have interpreted the abstract design process in different ways and have proposed other frameworks of design thinking.\n\nHead, Heart and Hand by the American Institution of Graphic Arts (AIGA)\n\nThe Head, Heart, and Hand approach by AIGA (American Institute of Graphic Arts) is a holistic perspective on design. It integrates the intellectual, emotional, and practical aspects of the creative process.\n\n“Head” symbolizes the intellectual component. The team focuses on strategic thinking, problem-solving and the cognitive aspects of design. It involves research and analytical thinking to ensure that design decisions are purposeful.\n\n“Heart” represents the emotional dimension. It emphasizes empathy, passion, and human-centeredness. This aspect is crucial in understanding the users’ needs, desires, and experiences to ensure that designs resonate on a deeper, more personal level.\n\n“Hand” signifies the practical execution of ideas, the craftsmanship, and the skills necessary to turn concepts into tangible solutions. This includes the mastery of tools, techniques, and materials, as well as the ability to implement and execute design ideas effectively.\n\nInspire, Ideate, Implement by IDEO\n\nIDEO is a leading design consultancy and has developed its own version of the design thinking framework.\n\nIn the “Inspire” phase, the team focuses on understanding users’ needs, behaviors, and motivations. The team empathizes with people through observation and user interviews to gather deep insights.\n\nIn the “Ideate” phase, the team synthesizes the insights gained to brainstorm a wide array of creative solutions. This stage encourages divergent thinking, where teams focus on quantity and variety of ideas over immediate practicality. The goal is to explore as many possibilities as possible without constraints.\n\nIn the “Implement” phase, the team brings these ideas to life through prototypes. The team tests, iterates and refines these ideas based on user feedback. This stage is crucial for translating abstract concepts into tangible, viable products, services, or experiences.\n\nThe methodology emphasizes collaboration and a multidisciplinary approach throughout each phase to ensure solutions are innovative and deeply rooted in real human needs and contexts.\n\nThe Double Diamond by the Design Council\n\nIn the book Designing Social Systems in a Changing World, Béla Heinrich Bánáthy, Professor at San Jose State University and UC Berkeley, created a “divergence-convergence model” diagram. The British Design Council interpreted this diagram to create the Double Diamond design process model.\n\nIn the diverging “Discover” phase, designers gather insights and empathize with users’ needs. The team then converges in the “Define” phase to identify the problem.\n\nThe second, solution-related diamond, begins with “Develop,” where the team brainstorms ideas. The final stage is “Deliver,” where the team tests the concepts and implements the most viable solution.\n\nThis model balances expansive thinking with focused execution to ensure that design solutions are both creative and practical. It underscores the importance of understanding the problem thoroughly and carefully crafting the solution, making it a staple in many design and innovation processes.\n\nIn this expanded and annotated version, the framework emphasizes four design principles:\n\nBe people-centered.\n\nCommunicate (visually and inclusively).\n\nCollaborate and co-create.\n\nIterate, iterate, iterate!\n\nThe updated version also highlights the importance of leadership (to create an environment that allows innovation) and engagement (to connect with different stakeholders and involve them in the design process).\n\nCommon Elements of Design Thinking Frameworks\n\nOn the surface, design thinking frameworks look very different—they use alternative names and have different numbers of steps. However, at a fundamental level, they share several common traits.\n\nStart with empathy. Focus on the people to come up with solutions that work best for individuals, business, and society.\n\nReframe the problem or challenge at hand. Don’t rush into a solution. Explore the problem space and look at the issue through multiple perspectives to gain a more holistic, nuanced understanding.\n\nInitially, employ a divergent style of thinking (analyze). In the problem space, gather as many insights as possible. In the solution space, encourage team members to generate and explore as many solutions as possible in an open, judgment-free ideation space.\n\nLater, employ a convergent style of thinking (synthesize). In the problem space, synthesize all data points to define the problem. In the solution space, whittle down all the ideas—isolate, combine and refine potential solutions to create more mature ideas.\n\nCreate and test prototypes. Solutions that make it through the previous stages get tested further to remove potential issues.\n\nIterate. As the team progresses through the various stages, they revisit different stages and may redefine the challenge based on new insights.\n\nDesign Thinking Mindsets: More than a Process\n\nA mindset is a characteristic mental attitude that determines how one interprets and responds to situations. Design thinking mindsets are how individuals think, feel and express themselves during design thinking activities. It includes people’s expectations and orientations during a design project.\n\nWithout the right mindset, it can be very challenging to change how we work and think.\n\nThe key mindsets that ensure a team can successfully implement design thinking are.\n\nBe empathetic: Empathy is the ability to place yourself, your thinking and feelings in another person’s shoes. Design thinking begins from a deep understanding of the needs and motivations of people—the parents, neighbors, children, colleagues, and strangers who make up a community.\n\nBe collaborative: No one person is responsible for the outcome when you work in a team. Several great minds are always stronger than just one. Design thinking benefits from the views of multiple perspectives and lets others’ creativity bolster your own.\n\nBe optimistic: Be confident about achieving favorable outcomes. Design thinking is the fundamental belief that we can all create change—no matter how big a problem, how little time, or how small a budget. Designing can be a powerful process no matter what constraints exist around you.\n\nEmbrace ambiguity: Get comfortable with ambiguous and complex situations. If you expect perfection, it is difficult to take risks, which limits your ability to create radical change. Design thinking is all about experimenting and learning by doing. It gives you the confidence to believe that new, better things are possible and that you can help make them a reality.\n\nBe curious: Be open to different ideas. Recognize that you are not the user.\n\nReframe: Challenge and reframe assumptions associated with a given situation or problem. Don’t take problems at face value. Humans are primed to look for patterns. The unfortunate side effect of these patterns is that we form (often false and sometimes dangerous) stereotypes and assumptions. Design thinking aims to help you break through any preconceived notions and biases and reframe challenges.\n\nEmbrace diversity: Work with and engage people with different cultural backgrounds, experiences, and ways of thinking and working. Everyone brings a unique perspective to the team. When you include diverse voices in a team, you learn from each other’s experiences, further helping you break through your assumptions.\n\nMake tangible: When you make ideas tangible, it is faster and easier for everyone on the team to be on the same page. For example, sketching an idea or enacting a scenario is far more convenient and easy to interpret than an elaborate presentation or document.\n\nTake action: Run experiments and learn from them.\n\nDesign Thinking vs Agile Methodology\n\nTeams often use design thinking and agile methodologies in project management, product development, and software development. These methodologies have distinct approaches but share some common principles.\n\nSimilarities between Design Thinking and Agile\n\nIterative Process\n\nBoth methodologies emphasize iterative development. In design thinking, teams may jump from one phase to another, not necessarily in a set cyclical or linear order. For example, on testing a prototype, teams may discover something new about their users and realize that they must redefine the problem. Agile teams iterate through development sprints.\n\nUser-Centered\n\nThe agile and design thinking methodologies focus on the end user. All design thinking activities—from empathizing to prototyping and testing—keep the end users front and center. Agile teams continually integrate user feedback into development cycles.\n\nCollaboration and Teamwork\n\nBoth methodologies rely heavily on collaboration among cross-functional teams and encourage diverse perspectives and expertise.\n\nFlexibility and Adaptability\n\nWith its focus on user research, prototyping and testing, design thinking ensures teams remain in touch with users and get continuous feedback. Similarly, agile teams monitor user feedback and refine the product in a reasonably quick time.\n\nIn this video, Laura Klein, author of Build Better Products, describes a typical challenge designers face on agile teams. She encourages designers to get comfortable with the idea of a design not being perfect. Notice the many parallels between Laura’s advice for designers on agile teams and the mindsets of design thinking.\n\nShow Hide video transcript\n\nTranscript loading…\n\nDifferences between Design Thinking and Agile\n\nWhile design thinking and agile teams share principles like iteration, user focus, and collaboration, they are neither interchangeable nor mutually exclusive. A team can apply both methodologies without any conflict.\n\nFrom a user experience design perspective, design thinking applies to the more abstract elements of strategy and scope. At the same time, agile is more relevant to the more concrete elements of UX: structure, skeleton and surface. For quick reference, here’s an overview of the five elements of user experience.\n\nShow Hide video transcript\n\nTranscript loading…\n\nDesign thinking is more about exploring and defining the right problem and solution, whereas agile is about efficiently executing and delivering a product.\n\nHere are the key differences between design thinking and agile.\n\nDesign Thinking\n\nAgile\n\nOrigins\n\nIt primarily originates in design and borrows from multiple disciplines, including psychology, systems thinking, and business strategy.\n\nIt primarily originates from software development and borrows from disciplines such as manufacturing and project management.\n\nPrimary Focus\n\nProblem-solving and innovative solutions.\n\nEfficient product delivery.\n\nPhase of Application\n\nUsually, toward the beginning of a project. Aims to define the problem and test and pick a solution.\n\nUsually, after teams have a clear solution. Aims to deliver that solution and continuously iterate on the live product.\n\nStructure and Documentation\n\nFluid process, less formal and relatively lesser documentation.\n\nStructured and formal process with extensive documentation.\n\nEnd product\n\nAn idea or solution, usually with a prototype, may not be tangible.\n\nTangible, working product (usually software) shipped to end users.\n\nDesign Sprint: A Condensed Version of Design Thinking\n\nA design sprint is a 5-day intensive workshop where cross-functional teams aim to develop innovative solutions.\n\nThe design sprint is a very structured version of design thinking that fits into the timeline of a sprint (a sprint is a short timeframe in which agile teams work to produce deliverables). Developed by Google Ventures, the design sprint seeks to fast-track innovation.\n\nIn this video, user researcher Ditte Hvas Mortensen explains the design sprint in detail.\n\nShow Hide video transcript\n\nTranscript loading…\n\nLearn More about Design Thinking\n\nDesign consultancy IDEO’s designkit is an excellent repository of design thinking tools and case studies.\n\nTo keep up with recent developments in design thinking, read IDEO CEO Tim Brown’s blog.\n\nEnroll in our course Design Thinking: The Ultimate Guide—an excellent guide to get you started on your design thinking projects.\n\nTake a deep dive into Design Thinking (DT) with our course Design Thinking: The Ultimate Guide .\n\nSome of the world’s leading brands, such as Apple, Google, Samsung, and General Electric, have rapidly adopted the design thinking approach, and design thinking is being taught at leading universities around the world, including Stanford d.school, Harvard, and MIT. What is design thinking, and why is it so popular and effective?\n\nDesign Thinking is not exclusive to designers—all great innovators in literature, art, music, science, engineering and business have practiced it. So, why call it Design Thinking? Well, that’s because design work processes help us systematically extract, teach, learn and apply human-centered techniques to solve problems in a creative and innovative way—in our designs, businesses, countries and lives. And that’s what makes it so special.\n\nThe overall goal of this design thinking course is to help you design better products, services, processes, strategies, spaces, architecture, and experiences. Design thinking helps you and your team develop practical and innovative solutions for your problems. It is a human-focused, prototype-driven, innovative design process. Through this course, you will develop a solid understanding of the fundamental phases and methods in design thinking, and you will learn how to implement your newfound knowledge in your professional work life. We will give you lots of examples; we will go into case studies, videos, and other useful material, all of which will help you dive further into design thinking. In fact, this course also includes exclusive video content that we've produced in partnership with design leaders like Alan Dix, William Hudson and Frank Spillers!\n\nThis course contains a series of practical exercises that build on one another to create a complete design thinking project. The exercises are optional, but you’ll get invaluable hands-on experience with the methods you encounter in this course if you complete them, because they will teach you to take your first steps as a design thinking practitioner. What’s equally important is you can use your work as a case study for your portfolio to showcase your abilities to future employers! A portfolio is essential if you want to step into or move ahead in a career in the world of human-centered design.\n\nDesign thinking methods and strategies belong at every level of the design process. However, design thinking is not an exclusive property of designers—all great innovators in literature, art, music, science, engineering, and business have practiced it. What’s special about design thinking is that designers and designers’ work processes can help us systematically extract, teach, learn, and apply these human-centered techniques in solving problems in a creative and innovative way—in our designs, in our businesses, in our countries, and in our lives.\n\nThat means that design thinking is not only for designers but also for creative employees, freelancers, and business leaders. It’s for anyone who seeks to infuse an approach to innovation that is powerful, effective and broadly accessible, one that can be integrated into every level of an organization, product, or service so as to drive new alternatives for businesses and society.\n\nYou earn a verifiable and industry-trusted Course Certificate once you complete the course. You can highlight them on your resume, CV, LinkedIn profile or your website."
