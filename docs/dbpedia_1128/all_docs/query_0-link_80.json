        "text": "LAS VEGAS (KVVU/Gray News) - Four teens who were facing murder charges in the death of their classmate agreed to a plea deal on Thursday.\n\nThe teens, ages 16 to 17, all agreed to voluntary manslaughter charges in the death of 17-year-old Jonathan Lewis. The four teens originally were charged as adults with second-degree murder and conspiracy.\n\nJonathan was found beaten to death in an alleyway near Rancho High School on Nov. 1, 2023. The incident happened after several students agreed to meet in the alley to fight over a vape pen and wireless headphones that had been stolen by Jonathan’s friend, according to authorities.\n\nA student and resident in the area carried Jonathan back to campus where school staff called 911. He was badly beaten and unconscious. He died six days later at the hospital.\n\nCell phone video of the fatal beating was shared on social media.\n\nLawyers said the deal moves the case back to juvenile court and allows any records associated with the case to be sealed.\n\nIf any of the teens back out of the deal, all four will be tried in adult court, according to Chief Deputy Attorney John Giordiani.\n\nJonathan’s mother Melissa Ready said she felt “blindsided” by the district attorney about the plea deal.\n\n“I was unaware there was going to be a court date today. I was also unaware they had made a plea deal. I was told by the district attorney a week or so ago that they were going to plead guilty to murder and get no less than two years in the adult system,” she said. “I was not satisfied with the two years in the adult system, but it would have at least been on their records. There is no justice so far for my son’s murder.”\n\nClark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson’s office said in a statement that it acknowledges Ready’s comments and the “pain” that she is going through, but that she had been informed last week about the terms of negotiations."
