        "text": "COLUMBUS, Ga. (WTVM) - A little more than a week from now, thousands of kids in the Chattahoochee Valley will head back to the classroom, but will there be enough teachers?\n\nRepresentatives from Harris and Muscogee counties both say despite the ongoing nationwide teacher shortage, the school districts are in a good position to start the school year next week.\n\n“21 for Special Ed paras, there’s 38 for General Ed teachers, so if you’re thinking about it on a scale of we have over 5000 employees, those are pretty small numbers,” said Tonya Carter, Chief Human Resources officer for Muscogee County School District.\n\nThose numbers are the vacancies for Muscogee county schools right now, for an essential part of the classroom: teachers.\n\nCarter says the district is facing a shortage of teachers in math, science, and special education. However, the district offers offer six distinct pathways to becoming a teacher, providing greater flexibility and opportunities for aspiring educators.\n\n“Every school person that works for Muscogee county school district ultimately supports the success for our kids, so we want to make sure we are fully staffed so we can give them our best,” said Carter.\n\nThose 6 distinct pathways are the following:\n\n1. TRADITIONAL CERTIFICATION:\n\nEducators who hold a professional teaching certification through a traditional route (Le. 4-year college/university or Masters of Art in Teaching (MAT) program).\n\n2. PROVISIONAL CERTIFICATION:\n\nA Provisional Certificate is a 3-year, non-renewable certificate for educators completing certification through an alternative pathway while teaching. Bachelor’s Degree required.\n\n3. MILITARY SUPPORT INDUCTION PATHWAY:\n\nThe Military Support Induction Certificate allows Veterans interested in becoming an educator, to ease the transition from service member to a teacher. This certificate will allow eligible individuals to teach for up to three years while completing requirements for a professional Georgia certification.\n\n4. STRATEGIC WAIVER:\n\nThe Strategic Waiver Model allows individuals with degrees in a particular field (i.e. Math, Science, Music, Art, History, Business, etc.) to teach that subject area without certification.\n\n5. GA DECAL BRIGHT FROM THE START/PRE-K LEAD TEACHER:\n\nThe Bright from the Start/GA Decal program allows MCSD to hire Pre-K Lead Teachers without certification. Eligible candidates must hold a Bachelor’s degree or higher from an accredited college or university and meet the Georgia Professional Development System for Early Childhood Educators (GaPDS) early childhood requirements.\n\n6. TRADE & INDUSTRY (T&I) SPECIALIZATIONS:\n\nT&l educators require a minimum of a high school diploma or GED equivalent, two years of verified industry work experience and industry certification (i.e. Automotive Technology. Construction, Welding. etc.).\n\nCarter says even though there are staff vacancies, there are creative ways to reduce teachers feeling overworked. One of them being a pool of at least 900 capable substitutes to fill in.\n\n“That there is not an overage of coverage by the teacher because if they were doing that on top of teaching, It can be a bit of a burn out situation. It gives us a pipeline because we do hire some of those substitutes to become our teachers, so that partnership is a pretty strong, robust one that we use ensure that we’re preparing another pipeline to make sure that we’re getting those qualified teachers as quickly as we can,” said Carter.\n\nHarris County School District leaders tell News leader 9 they are proud to report a school year retention rate of 88.3% for the period of last September to this past June, and a 99.4% fill rate for all positions district wide.\n\nHCSD currently has one teacher vacancy, a position recently added to decrease class sizes, and three paraprofessional vacancies.\n\nFULL STATEMENT FROM HARRIS CO:\n\nWe are pleased to announce that Harris County School District is in a very good position to start the new academic year. Our dedicated team has been working diligently to ensure that our staff is well-prepared and excited for the upcoming school year.\n\nWe recently completed a comprehensive three-day new teacher orientation, equipping our new educators with the necessary tools and knowledge to succeed in their roles.
