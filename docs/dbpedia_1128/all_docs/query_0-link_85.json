        "text": "What Is a Heart Rate?\n\nYourÂ heart rate is the number of times yourÂ heartÂ beats in 1 minute. Heart rates vary from person to person. Itâs lower when youâre at rest and higher when youÂ exercise.\n\nKnowing how to find your pulse can help you figure out your bestÂ exercise program. If youâre taking heartÂ medications, recording your pulse daily and reporting the results to your doctor can help them learn if your treatment is working.\n\nBlood pressure vs. heart rate\n\nYour heart rate is different from your blood pressure, which is the force of your blood against the walls of your blood vessels.\n\nA faster pulse doesnât necessarily mean higher blood pressure. When your heart speeds up, like when you exercise, your blood vessels should expand to let more blood pass through.\n\nHeart rate vs. pulse rate\n\nWhile the two go hand in hand, they are different. Your heart rate is a measure of the number of times your heart beats in a minute. With each beat, your heart squeezes. That creates enough pressure to push blood out of your heart to the rest of your body through a network of arteries. And that brief rise in pressure creates your pulse, which allows you to feel and count your heart rate. Pulse is a way to measure your heart rate.\n\nYou can feel your pulse on certain parts of your body where thereâs an artery close to your skin. Two easy spots are:\n\nYour radial artery, located near where your wrist bone meets your thumb muscle\n\nYour carotid artery, located on the side of your neck just below your jawbone (Donât check your pulse here if you have carotid artery disease, in which plaque builds up on the walls of the carotid artery.)\n\nHow to Check Your Heart Rate\n\nThere are a few places on your body where itâs easier to take your pulse:\n\nThe insides of your wrists\n\nThe insides of your elbows\n\nThe sides of your neck\n\nThe tops of your feet\n\nPut the tips of your index and middle fingers on your skin. Press lightly until you feel theÂ bloodÂ pulsing beneath your fingers. You may need to move your fingers around until you feel it. Count the beats you feel for 10 seconds. Multiply this number by six to get your heartbeats per minute.\n\nNormal Heart Rate\n\nA healthy heart rate for adults over 18 is usually between 60 and 100 beats per minute (bpm). Your number may vary.\n\nThe best time to measure your resting heart rate is just after you wake up in the morning before you start moving around or have any caffeine.\n\nChildren tend to have higher resting heart rates than adults.\n\nNormal heart rate by age (when awake):\n\nNewborns (birth to 4 weeks)100-205 beats per minute (bpm)Infants (4 weeks to 1 year)100-180 bpmToddlers (1 to 3 years)98-140 bpmPreschoolers (3 to 5 years)80-120 bpmSchool-aged (5 to 12 years)Â 75-118 bpmTeens (13 to 18 years)60-100 bpm\n\nTachycardia\n\nTachycardia means your heart beats faster than normal, usually more than 100 bpm. Tachycardia is only a concern if your resting heart rate is higher than 100 bpm.\n\nYou may not feel symptoms of tachycardia. But it can mean there's a heart issue you need to be aware of. Certain heart conditions that cause tachycardia can lead to stroke, heart failure, or even sudden death. Your doctor will prescribe the best treatment for the cause of your tachycardia.\n\nBradycardia\n\nBradycardia is a slow heart rate -- fewer than 60 bpm. Your resting heart rate typically drops below 60 bpm when you're sleeping. Some athletes and young adults can have heart rates of 40-60 bpm as well. More seriously, bradycardia results from your heart being unable to pump well enough to send oxygenated blood throughout your body. Bradycardia can make you dizzy, tired, weak, or short of breath, or you may feel no symptoms at all. Severe cases of bradycardia may require a pacemaker.\n\nHeart Rate and Gender\n\nThereâs a myth that you can predict your childâs sex by listening to its heartbeat in the womb. The notion is that male and female fetuses have different heart rates. Female fetuses, the myth holds, have heart rates of 140 bpm or higher, while male fetusesâ have heart rates below 140 bpm.\n\nHowever, studies have been debunking this myth for at least the past 60 years. Fetal heart rates can vary (some are faster than average, while some are slower), but they can't be used to predict your future babyâs sex.\n\nWhatÂ Affects Your Heart Rate?\n\nOther than exercise, things that can affect your heart rate include:\n\nWeather. Your pulse may go up a bit in higher temperatures and humidity.\n\nStanding up. It might spike for about 20 seconds when you stand up after sitting for a while.\n\nEmotions. Stress and anxiety can raise your heart rate. It may also go up when youâre very happy or sad.\n\nBody size. People with obesity can have a slightly faster pulse.\n\nMedications. Beta-blockers slow your heart rate. Too much thyroid medicine can speed it up.\n\nCaffeine and nicotine. Coffee, tea, and soda raise your heart rate. So does tobacco.\n\nPain. Sudden or chronic pain may trigger a stress hormone response that makes your heart beat faster.\n\nHormones. There may be a link between the postmenopausal decline of estrogen and your heart rate.\n\nAging. As you age, your heart rate won't rise as much during exercise or stress.\n\nSeveral health conditions can cause tachycardia, including:\n\nAnemia\n\nInfection\n\nHyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid gland)\n\nInjury to the heart from a heart attack or heart failure\n\nExtremely low blood pressure\n\nCongenital heart disease\n\nMisfiring electrical signals in the heart (ventricular or supraventricular arrhythmias)\n\nHealth conditions that contribute to bradycardia include:\n\nElectrolyte imbalance\n\nObstructive sleep apnea\n\nHypothyroidism (underactive thyroid gland)\n\nSick sinus syndrome and other heart problems due to atrial arrhythmias\n\nCushing reflex (increased intracranial pressure in your skull)\n\nHow to Lower Your Resting Heart Rate\n\nIn general, people who are fitter and less stressed are more likely to have a good resting heart rate. A few lifestyle changes can help you slow it down:\n\nExercise regularly. It raises your pulse for a while, but over time, exercise makes your heart stronger, so it works better.\n\nEat right.Foods that are high in sodium, sugar,Â and carbs can sometimes cause a temporary spike in your heart rate. Studies have found lower heart rates in those assigned male at birth (AMAB) who eat more fish.\n\nTackle stress. Set aside time to disconnect from electronic devices and relax each day. Meditation, tai chi, and breathing exercises can also help.\n\nStop smoking. Itâs one of the best things you can do for your overall health. Among its many harmful effects, smoking boosts your resting heart rate.\n\nLimit caffeine. Drinking too much coffee can increase your heart rate.\n\nLimit energy drinks. Energy drinks contain ingredients that magnify the heart-stimulating effects of caffeine.\n\nDrink enough water. Your blood gets sluggish when you're dehydrated, and your heart must use more force to pump it.\n\nLimit alcohol. It raises your heart rate, as does cannabis.\n\nGet enough sleep. Not getting a full night's sleep is unhealthy for your heart. Make sure to treat sleep apnea if you have it.\n\nMaintain a healthy weight. If you are overweight or obese, your heart needs to work harder.\n\nHeart rate medications\n\nIf you have a faster-than-normal heart rate (your heart beats more than 100 times per minute), you have what doctors call tachycardia. Itâs not always a bad thing. Exercise, for example, can push your heart rate above 100 bpm. However, you may require medication to slow your heart rate if itâs fast due to a health condition such as atrial fibrillation or arrhythmia. These medications include:\n\nBeta-blockers. This class of blood pressure medication slows your heart rate. Some examples of beta-blockers are:\n\nAtenolol (Tenormin)\n\nBisoprolol (Zebeta)\n\nCarvedilol (Coreg)\n\nMetoprolol (Lopressor)\n\nCalcium channel blockers. This class of blood pressure medication also slows your heart rate. These medications include:\n\nDiltiazem (Cardizem)\n\nVerapamil (Calan)\n\nCardiac glycosides. This class of medication, which treats atrial fibrillation and heart failure, slows your heart rate. The most commonly prescribed drug in this class is digoxin (Cardoxin).\n\nMaximum Heart Rate\n\nYour maximum heart rate is, on average, the highest your pulse can get. One way to get a rough estimate of your predicted maximum is to subtract your age from the number 220.\n\nFor example, a 40-year-old's predicted maximum heart rate is about 180 bpm.\n\nYou can learn your actual maximum heart rate with aÂ graded exercise test. If youâre taking medicines or have a medical condition such asÂ heart disease,Â high blood pressure, orÂ diabetes, ask your doctor whether you should adjust your exercise plan to keep your heart rate under a specific number.\n\nWhat Is a Target Heart Rate?\n\nYou get the most benefits when youÂ exerciseÂ in your âtarget heart rate zone.â Usually, this is when your heart rate is 60%-80% of your maximum. In some cases, your doctor may decrease your target heart rate zone to around 50%.\n\nCheck with your doctor before starting anÂ exercise program. They can help you find a routine and target heart rate zone that match your needs, goals, and overall health.\n\nWhen you start an exercise program, you may need to slowly build up to your target heart rate zone, especially if you havenât exercised regularly before. If the exercise feels too hard, slow down. Youâll lower your risk of injury and enjoy the exercise more if you don't try to overdo it.\n\nWhen you exercise, take a break and check your pulse regularly to find out whether youâre in your target zone. If your pulse is below your target zone, make your workout more intense.\n\nAge\n\nTarget Heart Rate (HR)\n\nZone (60%-80%)\n\nPredicted Maximum Heart Rate\n\n20\n\n120-170\n\n200\n\n25\n\n117-166\n\n195\n\n30\n\n114-162\n\n190\n\n35\n\n111-157\n\n185\n\n40\n\n108-153\n\n180\n\n45\n\n105-149\n\n175\n\n50\n\n102-145\n\n170\n\n55\n\n99-140\n\n165\n\n60\n\n96-136\n\n160\n\n65\n\n93-132\n\n155\n\n70\n\n90-128\n\n150\n\nYour Actual Values:\n\nTarget HR:\n\nMax. HR:\n\nÂ\n\nAbnormal Heart Rate\n\nIf your heart rate is consistently above 100 bpm or below 60 bpm and you're not a competitive athlete, it may be cause for concern. Reach out to your doctor if you have symptoms such as:\n\nChest pain or discomfort\n\nFainting or feeling faint\n\nPersistent dizziness or lightheadedness\n\nShortness of breath\n\nWeakness or fatigue\n\nA rapid heartbeat\n\nFluttering or pounding in your chest\n\nHeart Rate and Anxiety\n\nWhen you feel anxious or stressed, your heart rate goes up. Why? Itâs part of whatâs called our fight or flight response, in which a perceived danger triggers the release of stress hormones, such as adrenaline. This puts your body in high gear to allow you to face threats or make a swift escape. Your brain does this when you're facing physical danger, such as an armed robber. But this process can kick in for more mundane stressors, such as a fast-approaching work deadline.\n\nThese stress hormones also impact the parts of the brain that manage both your blood pressure and your heart rate. So, as a result of your anxiety (whatever the cause), your heart can start pounding, beating fast, or skipping beats. These are called heart palpitations.\n\nIf this happens often, such as if you have an anxiety disorder, the effect on your heart rate could contribute to heart disease. In very serious cases, the effect on your heart rate could lead to cardiac arrest, in which your heart suddenly becomes unable to pump blood. This can quickly result in death, if not treated promptly.\n\nIt works both ways, though. If you have palpitations due to an arrhythmia, for example, you may develop anxiety, which can then lead to more palpitations, creating a tough cycle.\n\nIf you feel anxious or experience heart palpitations occasionally, thatâs probably normal. We all get stressed sometimes. But if it occurs frequently, see a doctor to determine whatâs going on.\n\nTakeaways\n\nFor most healthy adults, a normal resting heart rate is between 60 and 100 beats per minute. Children tend to have faster heart rates, while those of athletes might be lower. You can check your pulse most easily at your wrist or on the side of your neck. If you need to raise or lower your heart rate, talk with your health care provider about lifestyle changes and exercise programs that may be right for you.\n\nHeart Rate FAQs\n\nWhat is a good heart rate by age?\n\nAfter adolescence, a medically normal heart rate for any age adult is anywhere between 60 and 100 bpm. Most healthy adults have a heart rate of 55-85 bpm.\n\nWhat's an unhealthy heart rate?\n\nTrained athletes can have very low heart rates, and children typically have higher ones. If you are neither and have a heart rate that stays below 60 bpm or above 100 bpm along with worrisome symptoms, you should see a doctor.\n\nWhat heart rate is considered too low?\n\nYour heart rate slows to about 40 to 60 bpm when you sleep. If you aren't physically fit or are having unusual symptoms, a consistent heart rate under 60 bpm may be cause for concern.\n\nIs a heart rate of 120 normal?\n\nIf you're exercising, stressed, or sick, your heart rate can rise to 120 bpm. If it stays at that rate at rest and you feel symptoms such as dizziness or palpitations, you should see a doctor."
