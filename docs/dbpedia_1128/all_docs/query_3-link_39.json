        "text": "Fourth Month Baby Milestones: Motor Skills\n\nYour baby is becoming more dexterous and doing more with their hands. Their hands now work together to move a toy or shake a rattle. In fact, those hands will grab for just about anything within reach, including a stuffed animal, your hair, and any colorful or shiny object hanging nearby. You might want to remove any earrings or necklaces if you donât want to experience a painful tug.\n\nAnything your baby is able to pick up will likely end up in theirÂ mouth -- tasting is one of the ways they exploreÂ their world. Itâs crucial that you donât leave small items lying around that baby could choke on. Anything that can fit inside a toilet paper tube is too small to be within fingerâs reach of your 4-month-old.\n\nBy now, your babyâs head should no longer be wobbly. Four-month-olds have pretty good head control while sitting supported, and they can hold their head and chest upright while lying on their stomach during tummy time. They also can kick and push with their feet. Some babies have even figured out how to roll from tummy to back at this point.\n\nFourth Month Baby Milestones: The Senses\n\nDuring the first three months, babies have a lot of trouble distinguishing color contrasts, which was why your newborn preferred bright colors and black-and-white objects. Now at four months, babyâs vision has sharpened to about 20/40. Babies at this age can pick out more subtle color contrasts, such as a red button on a red shirt. They also can see across the room, although they still prefer looking at people close-up.\n\nYour babyâs eyes should move together smoothly and follow objects and people around the room. If you notice crossed eyes or any other vision problems, be sure to mention them to your pediatrician.\n\nYou also may notice that your babyâs eyes are starting to change color. Lighter-colored eyes may go through several changes before settling on their final shade at about nine months.\n\nÂ\n\nFourth Month Baby Milestones: Eating\n\nSome pediatricians donât recommend starting babies on solid foods until six months. But depending on your babyâs size -- bigger babies may not be satisfied with breast milk or formula alone -- and readiness, your doctor may say itâs OK to start solids at four months. Before that first feeding, make sure that your baby has good head and neck control and can sit upright with support.\n\nBabyâs first food should be an iron-fortified rice cereal mixed with either formula or breast milk. Make the cereal very thin at first -- not much thicker than plain formula -- until your baby gets used to it. Then see how they reactÂ to taking the spoon. Babies at this age may still have a strong tongue-thrust reflex. If you put a spoon of cereal in your babyâs mouth and they pushÂ it right back out, you may need to wait a week or two before trying solids again. Keep in mind that your baby might be learning rather than disliking the food you've given them.\n\nFourth Month Baby Milestones: Communication\n\nFour-month-olds are starting to discover themselves as unique individuals. Theyâre also beginning to notice that the people around them respond to their actions. When your baby cries, you come over. When they dropÂ something on the floor, you pick it up. Many babies delight in dropping the same object over and over and over again, just to watch their parents repeatedly pick it up.\n\nBabies at this age are learning to be effective communicators. They express themselves through coos, vowel sounds such as ooh and aah, squeals, gurgles, and laughter. Youâll notice that your baby can use their face to express a wide range of emotions, from a beaming happy smile, to a crunched-up angry face, to open-mouthed surprise. Your 4-month-old is also starting to learn how to read emotions from your voice and facial expressions.\n\nTalking to Your Pediatrician\n\nHere are a few of the items that should be on the checklist for your 4-month well-baby pediatrician visit:\n\nHead circumference\n\nHeight and weight\n\nMilestones\n\nVaccinations\n\nHearing and vision\n\nEating\n\nSleeping\n\nBefore you go to the doctorâs office, make a list of any concerns you have and any questions you want to ask, and then use the list to be sure you get all the information and help you need."
