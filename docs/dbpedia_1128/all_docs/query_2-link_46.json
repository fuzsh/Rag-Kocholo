        "text": "How do I order the wall mount garage door ?\n\nThe Wall Mount Smart Garage Door Opener- Direct Drive Side Mount with Wireless Wall Console, Battery Backup, and Wi-Fi are available through local Genie dealers using this locator, or you can also find this product through Home Depot (some stores and on their website) or Amazon.\n\nWill this opener work on a 16' Wide by 14' tall non insulated garage door? The door is well balanced and I can raise the garage door manually with one hand.\n\nThe Wall Mount garage door opener will work on up to a 14' high garage door, however the 16' x 14' would be over the 180 sq. ft. max that the wall mount is capable of handling. Here is an additional critical measurement sheet for your reference.\n\ndoes this wall mounted garage opener work with Alexa?\n\nYes, the Wall Mount Smart Garage Door Opener- Direct Drive Side Mount with Wireless Wall Console, Battery Backup, and Wi-Fi is compatible with Alexa.\n\nCan i mount on left or right side\n\nYes, the Wall Mount Smart Garage Door Opener- Direct Drive Side Mount with Wireless Wall Console, Battery Backup, and Wi-Fi can be mounted on the right or left side of the door, as long as the clearance is available, please see critical measurements for more information.\n\nI have a Wayne Dalton Torq Master garage door 16 x 7 . Can this unit be used with my garage door ?\n\nYes, the Wall Mount Smart Garage Door Opener- Direct Drive Side Mount with Wireless Wall Console, Battery Backup, and Wi-Fi is compatible with Wayne Dalton Torque Master springs, however you will need the Torque Master Adapter Kit 41032R.\n\nCan I add additional lighting? In my previous Genie opener I had plug connected to the bulb socket on the opener so that when the garage door opened instead of powering a light bulb it power LED lights I had connected to where the light bulb connects on the opener. Can I add more bluetooth enabled lights? How can I pair more lights to this 6170?\n\nUnfortunately, the Wall Mount Smart Garage Door Opener- Direct Drive Side Mount with Wireless Wall Console, Battery Backup, and Wi-Fi will currently only work with one bluetooth light.\n\nWhat is the length of the AC Cord?\n\nFor the model Wall Mount Smart Garage Door Opener- Direct Drive Side Mount with Wireless Wall Console, Battery Backup, and Wi-Fi the power cord is 6 feet long with roughly 5.5 feet available from the housing to the end of the cord. We do have an approved extension cord available at local Genie Professional dealers if needed.\n\nWhat Genie wall panels are compatible with Model 6172H-B opener? Is it possible to simultaneously have wired and wireless panels to control 1 unit?\n\nYes you can have a wired and a wireless wall consoles both to the Wall Mount Smart Garage Door Opener- Direct Drive Side Mount with Wireless Wall Console, Battery Backup, and Wi-Fi. There is a limit of one wired lit wall console. The wired wall console is 39165R the wireless wall console is already included with this unit.\n\nDoes the light have motion detection?\n\nNo, the Wall Mount Smart Garage Door Opener- Direct Drive Side Mount with Wireless Wall Console, Battery Backup, and Wi-Fi light does not have motion detection. However, it does come on when the unit is operated and will stay on for 5 minutes afterward, then turn off. There is also an independent light control button on the wall console that can be used for constant light until the button is pressed again to turn off.\n\nwill this work with a zero track door?\n\nBy zero track door so you mean the door is a one piece flip out style door? Or do you mean you have zero clearance and this is a low clearance door?\n\nIf you have a one piece door, this model is not compatible with that type of door. We would instead recommend the models 3042,4042, 3022, 4062, or 4063 they are all compatible with one piece doors. They require 2 inches above the highest point of travel of the door.\n\nIf you have a low clearance door it depends on how the springs are wound. If the torsion spring is directly above the door and the cables from the spring come off the rollers on the door side of the roller, this unit would be compatible. If the door has reverse wound springs, meaning that the cables come off the rollers on the opposite side of the door, this unit is not compatible with that type of installation. This unit is also not compatible with springs that are mounted in a location other than directly above the garage door opening (springs mounted at the ends of the door tracks are not compatible).\n\nIf you have another situation please let us know and we would be happy to look into. Pictures would be helpful if this does not answer your question.\n\nHow many remote door openers that I can put in my car does this kit come with?\n\nThe Wall Mount Smart Garage Door Opener- Direct Drive Side Mount with Wireless Wall Console, Battery Backup, and Wi-Fi comes with one 3 button remote. It also comes with built-in smart phone/device capability so you can use your smart phone or smart device to open and close the garage. Additional remotes can be purchased, this unit will hold up to 64 remote devices.\n\nIs their a learn button in the wall unit\n\nThe Wall mount unit has a program/set button (PRG/SET) under the flip cover on the front of the motor box. This is used for programming the wireless devices. To program remotes, press and hold the PRG/SET button until a blue light is observed, release, a purple light will start blinking. While the purple light is blinking back up a few feet with the remote and press the desired button 4-5 times until the unit runs. The remote is then programmed. If you need additional help with another item please let us know.\n\nMy shift only about 1 1/2\" past the track is that enough and if not do have some sort of shift extension at attachment\n\nThe torsion shaft must extend at least 2 and 1/4 inches from the bearing plate in order to use the Wall Mount Smart Garage Door Opener- Direct Drive Side Mount with Wireless Wall Console, Battery Backup, and Wi-Fi. You can check the other side of the door to see if the torsion shaft extends farther on the other side.\n\nHow do I teen gage the emergency pull handle\n\nTo re-engage the opener you pull straight down in a firm movement, just as you do to disengage it.\n\nCan a universal push work with this opener\n\nYes, a universal push button will work with this unit.\n\nI have a 12' wide x 16' high door. Will this B6172H opener work on a door this size?\n\nNo, it is not comaptible with a 16' high door.\n\nI have two doors, I want to mount an opener on the left side of one and the right side of the other so I don't need 2 electrical out lets. How to I get a left side or right side opener?\n\nThis can be mounted on either side, so as long as you have the room to mount both in that area, it will work fine.\n\nMy door is a 7' high, 15' wide, 3 panel wood door. Can this handle a door that size?\n\nYes, as long as the door is well balanced.\n\nWhat is the shaft diameter requirement? 1 inch?\n\nYes, 1-inch diameter.\n\nMy doors are 12 feet high and 10 feet wide. Will this B6172H opener work on my door? If not, which one would you recommend?\n\nYes, it will.\n\nDoes this opener have a 'Time to close' feature? How much clearance is needed between spring tubes to mount 2 openers side by side?\n\nThis does not have a timer to close feature. You need at least 7-inches from the torsion shaft and the sidewall to install the wall mount garage door opener.\n\nWhat kind of battery does this operator use? Lead-acid or Li-ion? what's the capacity and voltage of the battery? Also: how is the overhead light powered? is there a cord running from the operator to the light? or does the light have it's own battery? or does it have its own power plug?\n\nThe LED Light connects to the garage door opener with blue tooth technology but has a plug for power that plugs into a standard outlet. The battery is non-spillable lead acid.\n\ndoes it work with google home app?\n\nYes, it does!\n\nDoes it have an emergency release to manually lift and open door?\n\nYes, it does.\n\nI have vertical lift doors that are well balanced and properly sprung, the are 8' tall each, what is the basis for the 84\" vertical lift maximum?\n\nThe Wall Mount garage door opener will work on a vertical lift door up to 8 feet. The 84” is for a high lift door and not in regards to the vertical lift door.\n\nWhy can't I use an extension cord if I don't have an outlet within 5feet?\n\nThe main reason for this is the use of an extension cord is prohibited by the NEC (National Electrical Code) and most local building codes to use extension cords for permanent applications.\n\nCould this be mounted and connected between two 9 foot doors so that they operate simultaneously. (the shafts are perfectly in line) and approximately 18 inches apart)\n\nNo, this cannot be added to more than one garage door.\n\nIs Model 6172H-B compatible with Brilliant Tech's line of smart home switches? I see that Model 6170 is compatible and I see Model 6170 referenced under the product description for Model 6172H-B but don't see anything indicating they are interchangeably compatible with Brilliant Tech.\n\nYes, the 6172H-B model is compatible with the Brilliant Tech as well!\n\nI don’t have enough clearance on the side of the door (less then 5”)can Wall Mount Smart Garage Door Opener be installed above the door and is there any attachment to make this possible.. Thank you,\n\nNo, it cannot.\n\nHello, will this opener work with a 20' Wide X 12' Tall insulated garage door?\n\nYes, it will as long as the door is well-balanced.\n\nHow long is the power cord? Do I need a dedicated power supply? Can the ceiling outlet be used?\n\nA standard 115 VAC grounded electrical outlet will be required within 5 feet of the bottom of the opener. The opener must be properly grounded to prevent personal injury and equipment damage, an extension cord cannot be used.\n\ndoes this work with Homelink?\n\nYes! This Genie Wall Mount garage door opener does work with Homelink.\n\nWill this work for roll up garage doors?\n\nNo, it will not.\n\nwhat is the maximum height of the door the sidemount will open? 15'?\n\nThis garage door opener will work on garage doors up to 14 feet high and 18 feet wide that are well balanced and rated less than 850lbs.\n\nWould this model be compatible with reverse-wound drums, those whose cables are not parallel to the wall but angled a bit? I don't see that mentioned in the documentation\n\nNo, it will not. The Wall mount does not have the ability to reverse the direction of the motor.\n\nWill the B6172H-B work without a battery or if the battery goes bad?\n\nYes, it will still operate as long as it has power.\n\nCan I use Aladdin connect app without having the Bluetooth light set up?\n\nNo, the Bluetooth light has to be connected in order to use Aladdin.\n\nWhat are the dimensions of the opener itself? I see the critical dimensions chart, but I have cabinetry only 11\" from the door and would need to insure the opener would fit between the wall and my cabinets.\n\nIt is 6.8\" wide x 14.5\" tall x 9\" deep.\n\nWill the opener work with 3” diameter cable pulleys? (8’hx10’w insulated door)\n\nHere is a critical measurements sheet you can use to be sure the wall mount is compatible with your door.\n\nWhich are faster, the screw drive openers or the side mount openers? What is the lift time per foot for each?\n\nThe screw drive opener operates up to 12 in/sec. The wall mount operates up to 7.5 in/sec.\n\nIs this compatible with ideal garage doors from Menards?\n\nHere is a critical measurement sheet that will help you determine if it is compatible with your door.\n\nCan the 6172H-B be connected to the iphone homekit?\n\nNo, Wall Mount Smart Garage Door Opener- Direct Drive Side Mount with Wireless Wall Console, Battery Backup, and Wi-Fi does not currently work with HomeKit.\n\nHow do I reset the wall mount opener if I dont want the delay feature anymore? This is for the Residential Wall Mount Opener.\n\nIf you use the DOOR button on the wireless wall console, you will not have the delay. The delay feature is activated with the DELAY button. The default delay period is set for a 10-second delay. With this feature, an open door will delay on close. A closed door will delay opening. Once the DELAY button has been pressed the operation can’t be canceled unless the same console DOOR button is pressed. During the activation of a delay operation, consecutive button presses will add 10 seconds to the delay time. Up to 3 consecutive button presses for a total of 30 seconds can be made. At any point in time during a delay operation, a DOOR button press will disable the current delay. The garage door opener light will begin flashing 4-5 seconds prior to movement.\n\nIs there a wired wall button that can be paired with this unit?\n\nYes, the Wall Mount Smart Garage Door Opener- Direct Drive Side Mount with Wireless Wall Console, Battery Backup, and Wi-Fi can have a wired wall button connected.

What up with that.\n\nI would recommend clearing the light and reprogramming.\n\nTo clear and reprogram the LED light kit fixture unplug all but the opener and light you are working with. You should only have one opener and the corresponding light kit powered. Flip the light cover open on the light. Press and hold the reset button under the light cover until a beep is heard, this clears out the light. Then unplug the light kit. Go to the operator, hold the square button until a green light comes on (8 seconds), release, this clears the motor unit of the light. Then unplug the operator. Plug in the operator, then plug in the light kit, the light will automatically pair when the items are powered up. Light kit will flash and beep briefly.
