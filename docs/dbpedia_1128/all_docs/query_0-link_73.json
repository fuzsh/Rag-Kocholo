        "text": "REVIEW — Among the first of many goosebump moments in the “Jersey Boys” musical now performing at Tuacahn is the introduction of the song “Sherry” — the Four Seasons’ first No. 1 hit and the turning point in the band’s rags-to-riches career.\n\nIt’s important to note that this moment comes about 52 minutes into the show because, unlike many superficial jukebox musicals, this production is narrative-driven and will require some patience, even for us die-hard fans who have been adoring their music for a lifetime.\n\nThat’s not to say the Jersey Boys’ story is not compelling; it is. Formed in 1960, the band struggled to that point under different band names but came into their own when nasally-voiced teenager Frankie Valli (Joshua Charles Skurnik) matured. Meanwhile, other members suffered through creative differences and the occasional prison sentence.\n\nTaking any gigs in and around the tough streets of New Jersey the band gelled when songwriter/keyboardist Bob Gaudio (William Bishop) and the other members at that time, which included bass player Nick Massi (Joe Caskey) and guitarist Tommy DeVito (Jonah Ho’Okano), were signed by established producer/songwriter Bob Crewe (Peter Surace) as session musicians and eventually were “allowed” to make their own records.\n\nIt might seem completely foreign for younger patrons to fully understand how hard it was for musicians in previous decades to record and publish their own music. “Jersey Boys” highlights the struggles and challenges of contract-based recording and often the good luck required to get your music played on the radio – the key to commercial success for 60 years in the business.\n\nWhile The Four Seasons were extremely successful in the ’60s and ’70s, their individual stories were lesser known as the band was often buried in the shadows of famous bands like the Beatles or even the Monkees. Making a story-centered show like Jersey Boys is important musical history as well as a slice of wonderful entertainment.\n\nThe show kicks fully in overdrive when the hits keep coming including “Big Girls Don’t Cry,” “Walk Like A Man,” “December, 1963 (Oh What A Night),” “My Eyes Adored You,” and “Dawn (Go Away).” A fun element of the show is the key role of Joe Pesci (Kyle Kemph) — yes, that Joe Pesci — in the success of the band.\n\nThe band will eventually survive brushes with the mob, bandmember jealousies and lineup changes and personal tragedy. It’s an age-old rock ‘n’ roll cautionary tale but when these boys sing, the cliches disappear and their signature sound remains as unique and timeless as ever.\n\nDirector Aaron DeJesus likely knows this show better than any human alive having performed as Valli for 10 years and is a Tuacahn veteran himself. He does a marvelous job keeping things moving and focused on the impossibly large outdoor stage where this size of show was not designed to be performed.\n\nThose who fell in love with this show years ago may miss having live musicians on stage and the obviously “pretend” musicians in this production don’t help. (Bravo to the hidden kick-butt band in the pit!) Tuacahn was wise to have the content toned down for greater commercial viability. For those who “need” the profanity, this 20-year-old show in its original form will still be performing all over the world for years to come. For the rest of us, we’ll enjoy the goosebumps right here at home.\n\n“Jersey Boys” performs weekly through Oct. 19, with ticket prices ranging from $35 to $130. Children under 3 are not permitted. Contact Tuacahn.org or 435-652-3300 for tickets and information.\n\nCopyright St. George News, SaintGeorgeUtah.com LLC, 2024, all rights reserved."
