        "text": "We have been looking at our screens a lot over the past year, for reasons we don’t need to get into here.\n\nIf you want to rein in the hours you spend looking at screens, whether on your phone, desktop, or gaming device, here are a few things you can do to start limiting your screen time.\n\nTrack and measure your screen time\n\nSet a screen limit or use a timer\n\nTurn off notifications\n\nGo grayscale\n\nDelete (or hide) time-sinking apps on your phone\n\nPursue offline activities\n\nCreate phone- and device-free spaces\n\nAvoid video fatigue\n\nPick up a new hobby\n\nAvoid eating in front of a screen\n\nRead a book instead of reading on your phone\n\nTake fewer photos\n\nChange your auto-lock settings\n\nTalk to your friends and family\n\nTake your work email off of your phone\n\nDisable the “Raise to wake” feature\n\n1. Track and measure your screen time\n\nA good starting point is seeing how much time you actually spend staring at screens, both during and after work, as most people tend to underestimate how much time they spend looking at their screens.\n\niOS, Mac, and Android have built-in screen-time functions—namely Screen Time and Digital Wellbeing—that allow you to see how much time you spend on which type of apps you spend most of your time on.\n\nSet up on iOS\n\nGo to Settings > Screen Time.\n\nTap Turn On Screen Time > Continue.\n\nIf you’re setting up Screen Time for yourself, tap This is My iPhone. If you’re setting it up for your kids, tap This is My Child’s iPhone.\n\nFollow the instructions.\n\nFor Android\n\nGo to Settings.\n\nTap Digital Wellbeing & parental controls.\n\nIf you’re tracking your own screen time, tap Digital Wellbeing. If you’re tracking your kid’s screen time, tap Parental Controls.\n\nIf you’re using Windows or Linux, there are several apps you can use such as ActivityWatch, which is an open-source alternative to other time-tracking apps.\n\nOnce you’re monitoring how much screen time you’re clocking, especially if it’s comparing your screen time every week, you might be surprised to see just how much time you spend on your devices.\n\n2. Set a screen limit or a timer\n\nIf you’re seeing on your time-measuring apps that you’re clocking over ten hours a day on your personal devices, it might be time to consider putting a limit on how much time you spend on your apps.\n\nApple’s Screen Time gives you the option to limit time on your biggest time sinks, which may most likely be social media apps like Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook. On both Mac and iOS devices, a screen will show up after you exceed your time limit to say you’ve used up your screen time but will allow you to extend your time by 15 minutes or ignore it altogether.\n\nGoogle’s Digital Wellbeing app on Android is less lenient, locking your app as soon as you pass the limit, which you can only unlock if you disable the timer entirely. Linux users can try using elementaryOS, which includes a feature to limit time spent on particular apps, and Microsoft Windows has introduced Parental Controls, which you can set screen limits to.\n\n3. Turn off notifications\n\nIt can be hard to focus when your phone is constantly buzzing with notifications from messaging apps and social media platforms like Snapchat and Instagram. Aside from turning on Do Not Disturb or Focus Assist to mute notifications in general, you can change your settings to select which apps you want to get notifications from, as well as how long they stay on the screen.\n\n4. Go grayscale\n\nBoth iOS and Android allow you to turn your phone’s display to grayscale, which is said to help you make your device less attractive to look at, thereby helping you stay off it.\n\nTo do this on iOS and Apple devices, go to Settings > Accessibility > Display & Text Size > Color Filters. Here you can toggle the switch to enable the Grayscale option.\n\nAndroid users can also turn on grayscale by going into the Digital Wellbeing app and enabling Wind Down. There you can turn Grayscale on immediately or schedule it for later. On Windows you can simply switch the grayscale by hitting CTRL + Windows Key + C, and on Linux you can try installing Desaturate All to achieve a duller interface.\n\n5. Delete (or hide) time-sinking apps on your phone\n\nDo you spend most of your screen time doing online shopping or mindlessly scrolling on social media apps? A good way to curb your screen time is to remove apps you’re addicted to from your phone. Even if you delete the apps, you can always access their website versions when you need to\n\nNot only does deleting your apps free up your time, but it can also declutter your device. What’s more, removing certain apps can significantly improve your privacy. You don’t need to wait until the new year to give your phone a clean slate.\n\nDon’t want to go so far to delete your apps? At the very least, you should hide the apps you don’t want to keep using so they are not easily visible on your home screen. Out of sight, and out of mind!\n\nThere are numerous ways to hide an app. An easy way is to move it away from the home screen and into a separate folder. On some Samsung devices, you can move the apps you don’t want to see to a built-in Secure folder.\n\n6. Pursue offline activities\n\nWe know it’s hard to take a break from our screens, but cutting out time to do something offline can give your eyes some much-needed rest.\n\nOn weekdays, you can do daily activities like shopping in a supermarket and working out in the gym. On weekends, you can do something fun such as shopping in malls, going on hikes, or getting a massage. The important thing is to find something to do that is more attractive than swiping on the phone.\n\nRead more: What to do when our devices get a little too distracting\n\n7. Create phone- and device-free spaces\n\nCreating phone-free or device-free spaces could help wean you off your screens. Putting your phone on silent and then tossing it to the other side of the room (or another room entirely) can help you focus on your work without notifications or other mobile distractions.\n\nWinding down for sleep? Kick your phone out of the bedroom. This reduces the amount of blue light you’re seeing at night and gives you a better night’s shut eye. When your alarm goes off in the morning, you will also be less likely to hit the snooze button as you are already out of your bedroom turning off the alarm.\n\nAlso, stop taking your phone to the bathroom. Heading out for a jog or a walk around the block? Leave your phone behind—and focus on getting your blood pumping.\n\n8. Avoid video fatigue\n\nAs remote work is becoming a new normal, many meetings take place in the virtual world when people are all over the world. Video calls require excessive staring at the screen causing video fatigue. To avoid video fatigue, try to limit to around three video calls a day, with each no longer than an hour.\n\n9. Pick up a new hobby\n\nStart a new hobby that you’ve always wanted to try. A project like a lego set or a nice long novel can keep you entertained for hours. Playing music is also a good way to relax and pass time. Ideally, the hobby you choose isn’t held in the format of online classes as it will defeat the purpose! It’s also best that the hobby doesn’t require a computer or a screen. (Photoshop courses are no go.)\n\n10. Avoid eating in front of a screen\n\nTurning to your phone for entertainment while eating can be very satisfying. It also triggers a sense of productivity as you’re doing two things at once. But you’ll likely spend more time on your screen if you want to finish the show you started at the start of the meal. Also, when you eat in front of a screen, you’ll pay less attention to the food you’re eating, which leads to overeating. To reduce your screen time, learn to put your device away and practice mindful eating.\n\n11. Read a book instead of reading on your phone\n\nThis one seems to go without saying. Reading on your phone can strain your eyes. It won’t help especially if your job requires you to stare at a computer all day. When using screens, people tend to blink less, and view the screen at poor angles. Screens also emit blue light, which can strain your eyes and affect sleep. Give your eyes a break. Choose printed books as they do not cause computer vision syndrome (eye problems caused by computer use).\n\n12. Take fewer photos\n\nMany of us like to document the journey of our lives by posting photos on social media. While many people just want to share their precious moments, some turn it into a quest for the perfect shot. . That can involve taking hundreds of photos just to get ten good ones. And if you have the habit of editing your photos before posting them, it’s a lot of screen time you spend on your phone.\n\nThe next time you see something worthy of a snapshot? Just take a few good ones, then put down your phone to soak in the rest of the experience.\n\n13. Change your auto-lock settings\n\nAuto-lock settings let you choose when your phone will lock its screen automatically if you forget to manually lock it. There can be instances where auto-lock settings can make your screen time data inaccurate. For example, if you set your auto-lock to ten minutes, your screen time still counts as such even if you only use your phone for a minute but forget to manually lock it after. Set your auto-lock to 30 seconds to keep your screen time data report accurate.\n\n14. Talk to your friends and family\n\nMessaging apps help us stay more connected with friends and family than ever. Social media updates give us quick glimpses of how friends and family are doing in life. However, over-reliance on these tools adds to more screen time. To give your eyes a rest, get off your phone and get together with your friends or family in a real-life environment.\n\n15. Take your work email off of your phone\n\nHaving your work email on your phone means you don’t miss an important message from your boss even when you are in transit. But this also means you’ll be spending more screen time after working the whole day at the office. Also, studies have shown checking work emails outside work hours results in more stress and anxiety. For better well-being, take your work email off of your phone, and leave tomorrow’s work for tomorrow.\n\n16. Disable the “Raise to wake” feature\n\nThe “Raise to wake” feature on an iPhone lights up the Lock screen as soon as you pick it up, showing unread messages and notifications to you. While it might enable fast access to info, it also tempts you with more screen time. It can be a good idea to disable the feature. Go to Settings > Display & Brightness. Switch Raise to Wake off.\n\nBenefits of reducing your screen time\n\nBetter physical and mental health\n\nProlonged screen time can cause numerous health issues. It leads to poor sleep; the blue light exposure from our screens confuses our body’s internal clock, making it hard for us to fall asleep. It can also cause headaches, eye strain, a foggy brain, weight gain, and depression. In other words, reducing your screen time gives you a healthier body and mind.\n\nIncreased productivity\n\nWhen you reduce your screen time, this means you look at your phone less for notifications, text messages, or calendar reminders. You are more focused on completing the task at hand and get more things done.\n\nGreater bonds with friends and family\n\nWhen you shift from online to real-life conversations with friends and family for reduced screen time, it’s also much easier to find common ground, pick up non-verbal cues, and build empathy. This helps form a stronger bond in your relationship with friends and family.\n\nReducing screen time for kids\n\nIn today’s screen-filled world, kids are spending more screen time for entertainment as well as online school. As kids are still developing, too much screen time can cause damage to their ability to focus, lend attention, and communicate with others. Too much screen time can also affect your kid’s overall physical and mental health as well.\n\nFor toddlers\n\nKids between one to three years old should spend no more than one hour a day on their screen. Here are some tips to reduce your little one’s screen time:\n\nBe the example: Children copy the behavior of others around them. Be a good role model for your kids. Use your devices less, and your kids are likely to follow.\n\nBring them to playgroup: For toddlers, there aren’t a whole lot of options for hobbies to pick up, and playgroup is one that sticks out. It’s a great way for your kid to have fun and learn offline!\n\nUse parental controls: Most devices offer parental controls which you let limit your kid’s screen time. Find out how to set it up on your devices.\n\nFor students\n\nFor those in school, it’s tough to cut screen time when classes are held online. We’ve put some tips together for you to work it out:\n\nGet your eyes off the screen during breaks.\n\nTake notes with a pen and paper instead of using note-taking apps.\n\nForm a study group with your classmates. Share physical notes with one another.\n\nCommit to only studying without a screen two to three hours a day. For example, study the notes you’ve written.\n\nEvery step counts\n\nIt’s hard to go completely cold turkey from the start, so don’t worry about starting small. You could start by deleting a couple social apps for a week or simply taking a closer look at how much time you spend on each of your apps. Experiment with the different tips above and see what works best for you.\n\nRead more: How to declutter the apps on your phone"
