        "text": "Chapter Text\n\nHis heart stammered in his chest, so forceful Danny swore Milo could hear it even as he took a step back, edging further away from the ghost who was steadily encroaching on his personal space.\n\n“What?” Danny asked, ignoring the faint ringing in his ears. “I have no idea what you’re talking about.” It was a weak, paltry lie – an inferior and insufficient statement of innocence that Milo tore through immediately.\n\nThe ghost stepped impossibly closer. “Don’t play dumb; it doesn’t suit you, boy. Or, should I say King?”\n\n“You’re going senile in your old age, boy.” Danny retorted.\n\n“You know, you certainly took your time coming back.” The non-sequitur briefly threw Danny. Milo backed off, slowly making his way around the small attic. “Have fun with your new friends?” Milo intoned the final word with such disdain it warped it into a mocking, cruel thing.\n\nDanny felt the realisation chill him, far quicker than the feeling of passing through any ghost.\n\n“You followed me.” Danny spat.\n\nMilo ignored him. “Love the place, by the way.” He continued, swiping his finger along a dusty surface Danny had overlooked in his initial cleaning. “Especially the rat shit in the corner. Gives it that real homey feel. How about a nice big throne over there-”\n\n“Cut the shit. How did you find out? Who told you?”\n\nMilo’s face twisted, morphing uncannily. That sharp cunning smile curved downwards over pointed teeth, and Milo’s usual sardonic expression took on wide eyes, imploring and deceitfully innocent. It was a look far too practiced, honed over the years by a child ghost – no longer a child. His eyes betrayed him, carrying a weight infinitely older than the youthful mask drawn over them.\n\n“Are you ordering me to tell you?” asked Milo, deathly quiet and deathly dangerous all at once.\n\n“How do you know?” Danny repeated.\n\nHis head felt light, unable to comprehend Milo completely. The frenzied organ, pulsing erratically in his chest, sent jittery blood coursing through his veins. Danny was hyper-aware of every limb yet completely disconnected from them. His legs, once obedient and firm, felt far away, too distant to support him now.\n\n“How do you know?” Milo parroted back, mocking the shaky pitch of Danny’s voice. “How do you think I know? I asked around.” He threw his hands in the air, exasperated. It was the most emotion Danny had seen the ghost show to date. “You’re not exactly subtle, you know. You would think the King would notice where his subjects-”\n\nDanny staggered; the energy had sapped out of him, and he sagged to the floor with a light thump. He hardly weighed enough to make much more noise.\n\n“No. Don’t.” He gasped. “Don’t do that. They’re not my subjects.”\n\nMilo followed his collapse impassively. “If not yours, then whose?”\n\nDanny remained silent under Milo’s piercing gaze. The light, which should have curved around his small frame, passed through him. It reached just before where Danny knelt, a finger breadth away, and as unattainable as ever.\n\nMilo ploughed on, bolstered by Danny’s lack of response.“It wasn’t hard, tracking you down. All it took was a week. Less, even.”\n\nHe was relentless.\n\n“Others were all too willing to talk, and you hardly cover your tracks as well as you think you do. The real question is, why are you here, and not presiding over your subjects in the Ghost Realm? A little negligent, no?” He finished snidely.\n\n“I’m exactly where I want to be.” Danny protested weakly.\n\n“What about where you need to be?”\n\nThis was stupid, he tried to convince himself. A waste of time. “Whatever.”\n\n“Ah,” Milo said cynically, “so, not just a boy-king but a self-serving one. We’re all doomed, I suppose.”\n\nDanny hesitated at Milo’s words, thrown at him offhandedly. He ignored the jibe at him, refusing to rise to the obvious bait.\n\nInstead, he asked, “What do you mean by that?”\n\n“Why do you care?”\n\n“Is something wrong?” Danny ventured again. The ‘Was it his fault?’ went unsaid. Milo caught it anyway. A light lit up in his eye, a cruel, inhumane gleam, like a voracious crow circling its carrion.\n\n“God, you’re a fool.” Milo scoffed. He bent down, coming to eye level with Danny.\n\nDanny averted his eyes; he couldn’t look at that hard gaze.\n\n“Perhaps,” Milo began quietly, “if you checked in a little more often, you would know the havoc that consumes the other side.”\n\nMilo grabbed Danny then, his fingers clenching painfully against the lower half of his face. It was a solid, physical grip. Milo clearly had enough strength to manifest certain parts of his body to a corporeal level.\n\nHe had dragged him all the way to Oma’s place after all. Danny didn’t ponder on what that meant nor how Milo had come about to muster such control.\n\n“Look at me,” he hissed, “It’s bleeding over. Whilst you prattle about, playing the part of a street urchin, more and more ghosts slip through the veil each and every day.”\n\nThe deathly chill seeped over from where the pads of Milo’s fingers came into contact with his skin. A thin layer of brittle ice was steadily spreading, frosting over his lower jaw and dusting his lips.\n\n“That,” Milo enunciated slowly, as though Danny were an insolent and irritating child, “comes with risks for those of us who already dwell here, in the land of the living.”\n\nMilo let go of Danny’s jaw abruptly; Danny lost his balance, only avoiding the floor via quick reflex. The frost receded rapidly, till the only evidence was the persisting, faint blue tinge of Danny’s lips.\n\nThe room echoed with Milo’s tense words, their weight ringing around like a resounding gong.\n\nDanny steeled himself. “Who was it that told you? That I was-” Danny stopped, reluctantly working around the bitter taste of his next word. “-King.” He uttered it as though it were a death sentence. In a way, it was.\n\nMilo, who had since turned away, snapped his head back to Danny. His face shuttered over, something akin to disappointment settling over his pert features.\n\n“Selfish boy.” He carped. Shifting fully to face Danny, Milo spoke again, louder now. “If you’re so damn bothered, make me tell you.”\n\n“I thought orders were beneath you.” said Danny, caustic in his mounting temper.\n\nMilo sneered. “Only when they come from people beneath me.”\n\nAh, Danny thought, the gauntlet had been thrown. It was like those old-timey tales Jazz would read to him, her hushed voice chasing away any fears of what lurked in the shadowy corners of his room.\n\nMilo had challenged him, and Danny – ever the fool – had walked straight into it, like a blind man onto a freeway. ‘\n\nMilo, quite cleverly, had grouped Danny up with the ‘People’, because Danny was hardly a ghost – how could a human be his King?\n\nHe was provoking him, like an overly self-satisfied cat assured in its victory over its idiotic, lesser prey. Danny was nothing more than a quick snack to Milo, something to chew out before he slinked off to Oma or whatever other ramshackle hole he occupied.\n\nIrrationally, Danny felt that ire bubble perilously inside him. Who was Milo to question him? To judge him?\n\nThe ghost hardly knew Danny, what Danny had been through. Milo had no fucking clue what he had to give up. Now, Danny thought irritably, his teeth horribly grounding against each other, Milo wanted him to sacrifice more – to leave his humanity for a role thrust upon him, unsolicited.\n\nIt wasn’t like there had been an instruction manual when he defeated Pariah Dark; there had been no forewarning of what was to come.\n\nIt wasn’t fair. He should be in school, agonising over math functions and Shakespeare, not spending his days running from the GIW, his parents, and his thorny crown. Vindication surged up inside of Danny, clawing its way up his throat like hot, acetic bile. He bared his teeth, defensive and self-righteous and ashamed all in one.\n\n“Shut up.” He snarled, a little hysterical. “Shut up. I don’t even know you. You- you have no idea, and you still stand there, looking down at me, like you’re so much better than me. Why should I have to bear it?” Danny took a ragged breath. “I can’t.”\n\n“You must.” Milo implored, the finality of his words as heavy-leaden as cement. \"It's the law.\"\n\nDanny shook his head. “I’m not even a proper ghost. What use am I to them?”\n\n“What use- you are their King.” Milo said, a bewildered look on his face. “Their ruler. You, Danny, are the hand that guides them. You should govern them, and watch carefully over their afterlives. Danny, you are their God.”\n\n“I’m not a God. I’m just sixteen.” How could he order around an entire kingdom when he hadn't even finished high school? Whoever came up with these laws clearly hadn't given them much thought - either that, or they had not considered the possibility of a sixteen-year-old on their ghostly throne.\n\nMilo was fully facing the window now, back turned to Danny. “Yes.” Milo agreed, voice cool. There was a quality to it though, something weary lying there, long dormant and freshly resurfaced, that gave Danny pause.\n\nMilo continued, in that odd way, neither cold nor kind, “You are. But, Danny, you are also the Ghost King. You can’t go frolicking around, scrounging for scraps of food, holed up in a boarded-up church. It is not your duty to abandon your own for childish whims.”\n\nDanny shook his head. “You don’t get it.”\n\nFor a moment, the ghost stared blankly. Danny felt the urge to recount his statement. Any semblance of understanding dissipated, the room growing cold once more. “Don’t I?” Milo countered, incensed. “I stay here in Gotham, day in, day out. I am surrounded by people who can’t see me, who can't fucking interact with me – whilst I watch on, never truly with them.\"\n\nMilo paused. He stood, silently gazing at Danny's face, as though trying to discern some hidden meaning behind it. Then, he continued, voice as soft as the petals of a peony on the precipice of decay. \"I still fucking stay. It's shitty, I know. Do you think I don’t get it? I do. More than anyone. But these people,” Milo shook his head, “they don’t need you. The ghosts do.”\n\n“What would you have me do then? Just up and leave-”\n\nMilo rolled his eyes, back to his usual, stony self. “Accept it. Do your fucking job.”\n\n“I’m human, too.” Danny pleaded, trailing off quietly. He was human, as much as he was a ghost. Everyone seemed to forget that part. Surely, Milo, who had encountered the depths of mankind's loneliness would be able to understand him. A small part of Danny needed Milo to get it. To feel how he was feeling.\n\n“Kings don’t have the luxury of humanity.” Milo responded, unsympathetic. He exhaled loudly, expelling air from lungs that didn’t need it.\n\nIt was the wrong thing to say.\n\nHis words slammed the air out of Danny. Like sawdust, it suffocated him. The constant noise rose to a deafening crescendo, and an intense pressure filled Danny’s head. His ears throbbed, and the force behind his eyes expounded. He felt like his fucking head was going to pop.\n\n“Danny-” Milo began. His voice sounded funny, thin and distant, as though they were standing on different rooftops shouting incomprehensibly at each other.\n\nThere was a peculiar sense of alarm to it, Danny thought distantly. It hadn’t been there before. 'Liar' chorused around his mind, blearing inside his brain like an air raid siren. No, Milo didn't get it. Milo was a liar. Milo needed to leave. The desire to be alone overcame him. He heaved himself up onto all fours, and then gradually onto his feet. Milo watched him strangely, as though Danny were a particularly pitiful piece of roadkill.\n\n“I- I think you should leave.” He murmured.\n\nMilo said something, but it was inaudible to Danny. He saw the ghost's mouth moving still, but Danny paid it no attention. Rolling his neck, Danny straightened to his full height and towered over Milo. “I asked you to leave.” He said, puffed full of faux-confidence.\n\n“Just a second-”\n\nHe told Milo forcefully: “As your King, I am telling you to leave.”\n\nA severe frown took over Milo’s face, his features changing nastily. It was too grotesque an expression for such a youthful face.\n\n“Get. Out.”\n\nMilo only stared up resolutely at Danny, contesting. “A child ruling the Infinite Kingdoms.” He flicked his gaze up and down Danny’s person disdainfully. Unimpressed. “Pathetic.”\n\n“That’s rich coming from you.” Danny threw back, eyeing up the other. “You’re as much a-”\n\nMilo sneered. “I’d be careful with the words I throw around, if I were you. You wouldn’t want to offend anybody.” He shrugged. “Diplomacy and all.”\n\nDanny’s snapped his mouth back shut. A short mirthless laugh. Then: “Fuck you.” He hissed, full of vitriol. “You’re a snide, miserable little old man stuck in a boy’s body.”\n\nDanny huffed a harsh laugh again at Milo’s screwed-up face. No doubt if blood still coursed through him, his small pointy face would be flushed pink with anger.\n\nHe leaned closer, a mockery of Milo’s earlier invasion. “And guess what? You’ll always be just that. An old man in a body that doesn’t fit him anymore.”\n\nIn all honestly, Danny should have seen the blow coming before it did.\n\nInstead, all he felt was a shock of cold, before white throbbing pain bloomed across the underside of his jaw. His mouth had still been open when Milo had thrown the punch, and as such, his teeth had slammed across, slicing the soft flesh inside his mouth.\n\nReeling, Danny spat a glob of blood on the floor. Wildly, he searched the room for any sign of the ghost.\n\nGone.\n\nDanny never did find out who ratted him out. But he will.\n\n***\n\nJason sat at his coffee table, head buried in his hands.\n\nIt had been a late night, wrought with chasing down leads about errant gang members and weeding out the traitors in his ranks.\n\nJohnny had come by earlier, gracing him with a steaming cup of coffee and a detailed report about the whereabouts and circumstances of his current members.\n\nJason made a point to stay updated on their lives, their every strength and most common weaknesses. Anything that could aid or serve to his detriment was valuable knowledge; one he wouldn’t let slip from his hands. The only thing was, it came with a whole extra workload added to his already sleepless nights.\n\nThank god for Johnny.\n\nAnd curse the devil for Dick.\n\nThe man had ambled by not long after Johnny, quickly chasing off Jason’s saving grace with his overly cheerful demeanour at the godawful hour of who-the-fuck-knows-except-its-really-fucking-early.\n\nThe damn birds were still chirping, for Christ’s sake.\n\nDick was currently bustling around his kitchen, clanking pots and pans for something. “What-” Jason began with a groan, “-are you doing?”\n\n“Making eggs.” responded Dick. “S’just, you’re kind of missing the key component.”\n\n“What’s that?”\n\n“The eggs.” Dick quirked his brow, disapproving and amused all in one. “You don’t have any.”\n\nSo expressive so early in the day, Jason thought glumly. Stupid morning people.\n\nJason mustered up the energy for a glare. “Just make toast like the rest of us.”\n\n“Toast it is! Love toast.” Dick paused for a beat, “Zombies like toast. Good to know.”\n\nDear Lord, give him strength.\n\nJason could always kick his brother out. Except Dick would probably crawl back in through the window. Jason simply buried his head in his pillow instead. His hands weren’t cutting it.\n\nDick, in between stuffing slices of bread in the toaster, coughed lightly as he snuck glances at Jason, who staunchly maintained his front of ignorance. Anything to put off the coming conversation.\n\n“So…”\n\nGoddamnit.\n\n“You remember that, uh, vat of green juice you mentioned?”\n\n“No,” Jason retorted sarcastically, “it seems to have slipped my mind.”\n\n“Shut up, don’t try to be clever. I’m being serious.”\n\nJason sighed. “Just spit it out.”\n\nDick turned, resting his back against the counter. His face was stoic, eyes serious. “Are you a zombie?”\n\nThe toaster went off, and two crispy, charred slices of toast popped out. The smell of burnt toast assaulted Jason’s olfactory senses. “What the fuck, Dick?”\n\nDick raised an eyebrow. “Well? Are you?”\n\nJason felt an absurd burst of laughter bubble up inside him. Of course, this would be the incredibly important question Dick just had to ask. “No.” He shook his head, grinning slightly. “It’d probably be cooler if I was.” he admitted, a little reluctantly.\n\nDick nodded and launched into his explanation about Constantine and green shit everywhere and magic graffiti. Jason’s toast lay untouched, cold and hard next to his half-empty coffee.\n\n“Wait, so let me get this straight.” Jason leaned forward, resting his forearms on his knees. “You and Constantine, grade-A British asshole, actually agree on something?”\n\nDick groaned, throwing himself back on his seat. “I told you to listen. Not ask stupid questions.”\n\nJason cocked his head. “Hmm.”\n\n“Don’t do that!”\n\n“What?”\n\n“That ‘hmmmm’ shit. You know who you sound-” Dick cried out suddenly, grasping his arm. “Ouch! What was that for?!” He complained.\n\n“Stupid questions.” Jason grumbled back.\n\n“I hadn’t even finished.”\n\n“Didn’t need to. Could tell it was stupid from your face.”\n\nDick squinted. “Just eat your toast.”\n\nJason took an experimental bite. “You’re no Alfred, Dickface.”\n\n“Make your own toast next time, you ungrateful ass.” Dick muttered, not without shooting an irate look Jason’s way.\n\nHis brow furrowed further as his gaze drifted, the lines on his forehead deepening. They hadn’t been there a few years ago, just before Jason’s return to Gotham.\n\nNeither had the bold white streak stubbornly stuck in Jason’s hair. It seemed their double life took a toll on them all, even the unflappable Dick Grayson.\n\n“So, ghosts. Do you think they’re real? It’s a little farfetched.” His brother asked quietly.\n\n“Might be. But-” Jason shrugged. “-I wouldn’t be surprised.”\n\n“That’s Gotham, for you.” Dick sighed and cracked his fingers slowly, one by one. Jason narrowed his eyes. It was a nasty habit, one Jason abhorred. Dick knew that, and Jason knew he did it anyway, with quirked lips and a teasing glint in his eye.\n\nIt certainly was plausible. If the dead could return to life, who was to say spirits couldn’t linger, long after passing? If there was one thing about Gotham, it was that she always defied what was normal, natural even.\n\nNot too different from him.\n\nNot too different from Ra’s.\n\nA man who had defied the natural decline of age, schemed and plotted against the scythe of death. If the effervescent glowing waters of the Lazarus Pit really were connected to Dick’s green goop shit, it would only spell bad news for them all.\n\nIt would mean Ra’s and his ilk would no doubt make their way to Gotham once more, whether that be to investigate anything related to their precious pit, or to … harvest this green stuff.\n\nEither way, Ra’s could never stay away from Gotham for long. Not whilst Batman still had breath in his lungs.\n\nEvery time the League came a-knocking, another Bat got caught up with them, entangled, never returning from the fray unscathed. Soon enough, one of them would end up dead – again – and Ra’s would be there, dangling his death-defying device like fruit from the devil.\n\nNothing more than vile poison, languidly taking root.\n\nJason clenched his teeth. “Hey, Dickface?”\n\nDick hummed in acknowledgement.\n\n“What you said earlier, about the ghosts and green shit? You think it’s Ra’s?”\n\nDick faced him fully, a hard look in his eyes. Jason knew it wasn’t directed at him; that flinty gaze was reserved only for those who went after what Dick loved, those who hurt what Dick loved.\n\n“Could be. Sure sounds like him with all the green goop.” He replied, a little too flippant to be genuine. “I hope it’s not though. For everyone’s sake.” Dick pointedly stared at Jason, meaning for him to catch the significance of words unsaid, hanging in the air. For your sake.\n\nJason said slightly brusquely, “Whether it’s him or not, Ra’s equals trouble.”\n\nDick nodded. “When does he not.” The corners of his mouth rose, just barely. “You’d think he’s tone it down in his old age.”\n\nJason let out a laugh. “Highly unlikely. Ra’s will stay plotting even with one foot in the grave.”\n\nDick chuckled.\n\nThey sat, letting the silence stretch between them, comfortable and familiar, like the warm sunny days of spring from their youth, spent lounging on the manor ground – a rare occasion, but cherished, nonetheless.\n\nJason began munching on Dick’s slice of toast. Dick had reached over the small coffee table to grab the lukewarm cup resting there.\n\nHe took a sip and gagged. “What is this shit?!” Dick spluttered, “It’s so bitter! And cold!”\n\nJason looked sideways at his brother. “It’s coffee.”\n\n“Coffee?! More like crude oil.”\n\n“Serves you right for taking-” Jason reached over, snatching back the cup, “-what’s not yours.”\n\n“Zombies are coffee-addicted hypocrites too, I guess.”\n\nJason swiftly punched him again. After a beat, Dick spoke. “Damian, I think he’s hiding something from me.”\n\n“Like?”\n\nDick scrunched his nose. “Well,” He snarked, “if I knew that, I wouldn’t be talking to you.”\n\n“Dick.” Jason muttered.\n\n“I can tell when you mean it as an insult.”\n\n“Just answer the question, dickhead.”\n\n“Well, he seems a little … different?”\n\nJason raised his brows, confused. “Isn’t that a good thing? I thought that’s what you were angling at, y’know pseudo-father figure and all.”\n\nDick shoved him lightly. “Don’t be a dick, man.”\n\n“That’s your job.”\n\n“Asshole. I don’t even know what I’m saying. Forget it.”\n\nJason shifted in his seat. “Man, I don’t know much about kids. I bet if he is hiding something, the kid is far too well-trained to get caught, least of all by his big brother-slash-dad. So-”\n\n“Quit it with that dad stuff, dude.”\n\n“-So, why don’t you try asking him? There’s a higher chance of him just telling you than you actually snuffing him out. He is a trained assassin and the ‘blood son of the Bat.’”\n\nDick glared at him. “Don’t make fun of him.”\n\nJason raised his hands in surrender. “Peace! I call for peace. Don’t go all defensive-daddy on me, now.”\n\n“Wave around your fucking underwear too, if you’re serious.”\n\n“I will.” Jason warned lightly.\n\n“You think he’s okay?”\n\nJason waited before replying, taking care to school his features into something pondering. “I think, you’re losing your touch, Boy Wonder. So much for the world’s greatest detective. It’s no mystery why Bludhaven PD fired you.” He sighed. “Damian’s a teenager, now. Teenagers are weird.”\n\n“So astute, Jay.” Dick drawled, before straightening up in his own defence. “And, I’m suspended, idiot. Not fired. There’s a difference.” He huffed and nestled back down. “S’not because of my skills. The whole place is rotten, down to the fucking floorboards.”\n\n“So, what’re you gonna do about it?”\n\nDick let a wicked grin slide across his face. “Rip the damn rot out, of course.”\n\nDick was reclining, now, on Jason’s shabby thrift store couch, head tilted back and eyes shut. It looked, on all accounts, that he was sleeping – if not for the carefully controlled breaths that betrayed his wakefulness.\n\nThere was no indication of his inner turmoil, the lines of his face lax, his body relaxed. A picture of peacefulness.\n\nSo different from Jason, who was constantly a mess of clenched jaws and taut muscles.\n\nJason knew those breaths well. He breathed the same way, after all. They all did, courtesy of Bruce and his relentless training.\n\n“Do better, Jason. You’re doing it wrong.”\n\n“Come off it, B.” Jason panted, “Besides, how can I be doing it wrong? It’s breathing.”\n\n“Again.”\n\nJason shook his head, rivulets of sweat coursing down the back of his neck, trailing uncomfortably in the crevices of his face. “Nah, B, I’m beat. This is impossible.”\n\n“You asked to learn.”\n\nThat he did.\n\nNow, Jason sorely wished he hadn’t. How excited he had been when Bruce finally relented, succumbing against the barrage of Jason’s ceaseless complaints.\n\nHe had been irrefutably relegated to the easy shit. Stuck on basic sets three weeks in a row – especially due to minuscule issues with his form! What was a slightly bent leg here or an imperfectly elevated elbow there?\n\nNot everyone was The Batman – or Dick Grayson.\n\n“Again.” B called again, gaze hard.\n\nIt had been a quiet night, somewhat of a rare commodity in Gotham, and the two of them had dedicated the following morning to ‘good old training’.\n\nIn Jason’s opinion, there was nothing good or old about this training. It was new, torturous in a way Jason’s mind hadn’t even begun to comprehend, though his body was screaming in agony at the arduous toll it had taken on his body.\n\nThere was little worse than six months of Basics 101. Except this. This was definitely one of them. Who gave a shit if his breathing was a little off? Jason swore his lungs physically weren’t capable of this shit.\n\nJason had been naïve. He could admit that now. If he had the air in his chest, he would have utilised it now to express that.\n\nIt was rare for Jason to express remorse, or admit defeat. However, as he lay here now, sprawled flat on the sweat-soaked mat without a shred of energy to even appeal to his mentor, Jason knew he had been well and truly beat.\n\nHe should have known he had been defeated from the moment he saw that glint to B’s eyes, the one that signified he would be training with Batman and not Bruce.\n\nThe soft curl to his mouth and those eyes slanted in perfect, predatory concentration were chilling even without the cowl masking half of the man’s face. Jason secretly thought Gotham’s rogues were lucky; they, at least, weren’t subject to cutting remarks of form and technique as they were brutally taken down.\n\n“Jason,” Batman called out from above him, the bright lights of the training area stark against his immovable figure, harshly contouring the displeasure on his stupid immaculate face. “If you can’t keep up…”\n\nJason scowled. “I can, swear. Just gimme a-”\n\n“A what? A break?” Batman raised a perfectly groomed eyebrow. “They won’t give you breaks. Gotham won’t give you breaks.”\n\nDamn. Jason hated it when the man had a point.\n\nDespite that, he felt a surge of irritation alongside the irrational need to defend himself. “Well, the rogues aren’t here right now.”\n\nBatman’s face darkened. With a minute tic in his jaw; the man looked away from Jason.\n\nThat corrosive blackness whispered inside him, murmuring at him to push, test, see. Almost against his will, a smirk worked its way onto Jason’s face, defiant. “And, you know what? Gotham can blow me.”\n\n“Language.” B said automatically.\n\n“Tell the Joker he can fucking kiss. My. Ass.”\n\n“Enough.” Batman snapped.\n\nThere we go.\n\n“We’re done here. If you can’t take this seriously,”\n\n“Hey!”\n\n“If you’re going to act like an insolent child, then I will treat you-” He finally fixed his damning gaze on Jason, “-as a child. You’re off patrol and banned from the Cave.” With that, the man swiftly turned, striding off towards the elevator.\n\nJason, meanwhile, had been struck speechless. He had never been taken off patrol before. Granted he hadn’t been on the job all too long, but still, it felt as though B had snatched something precious from him.\n\nFinally, he gathered himself just as B reached the sleek metal doors. “Until when?” He called out.\n\nWithout turning, B stepped into the elevator. Just as the doors slid shut, he replied, “Until I say otherwise.”\n\nJason sighed and collapsed back onto the training mat and threw an arm over his face.\n\nJason could do this, he knew it. It just took him a little longer. He always had to spend a little more time on things, do a little more grunt work. Gruelling effort and sheer spite had gotten him through more than Jason would care to admit.\n\nHe wasn’t the flawless Dick Grayson, with all his natural grace and boundless talent.\n\nIt just wasn’t fair, Jason thought petulantly. Nothing should ever come that easy to anyone.\n\nIn his distraction, Jason had not heard the modified elevators slide open once more. He certainly hadn’t heard the well-trained silent footfalls padding across the floor until he heard the soft sound of someone clearing their throat.\n\nJason’s eyes flew open and he vaulted up onto his feet.\n\nThere, standing in front of him, was Dick Grayson – equipped with his signature devilish grin. Funny, how Jason had once prided himself on his intuition and that prickling sense of awareness stretching out around his environment. How he had been proven wrong, once his training had truly begun.\n\nJason was surprised; it was rare for Dick to stop by the manor, courtesy of his regular bouts with Bruce.\n\nThe two seemed to be constantly engaged in some stifling stand-off or the other, their bitter words were carelessly spoken, more cutting than any physical blows thrown.\n\nUsually, Jason met Dick out on patrol, and that was all the rarer given how Bruce had taken pains to ensure their patrols never crossed paths with the newly established Nightwing.\n\nHe recalled that night, months ago, when Nightwing handed him a slip of paper with his contact details. “Call me,” Dick had said, “for anything. Even if it’s just to talk.”\n\nJason never did call.\n\n“Hey, Little Wing.”\n\nUgh, that nickname.\n\nYou’re lucky I was the one who caught you slacking and not B. He’d have had you running awareness drills for a month.”\n\nJason scowled. “He already is.”\n\nDick flopped down on the floor and patted the spot next to him. “Hardass. You’ll thank him, though.”\n\nThere it was again.\n\nDick was always doing that – explaining Bruce.\n\nIt was almost unfathomable that the two had ever been a duo with the dissent bubbling between them. Almost.\n\nJason gleaned a whole era of experiences from those slivers of history Dick let slip into their conversations. Bruce was all too tight-lipped about his first protégé, but Dick hadn’t quite picked up that impenetrable façade during his years with Bruce.\n\nJason sat beside Dick, silent. It had been … difficult to overcome his initial resentment of his predecessor, the gaping hole he had left when he ditched the cape of Robin to, instead, step into the suit of the shiny, new Nightwing instead.\n\nWhat bullshit.\n\nJason felt that ugly nastiness rear its head again, and tamped down on it, shoving it some dark and small inside his mind. Okay, so maybe he hadn’t completely overcome it, yet.\n\nDick, none the wiser, lounged on the mat. He snuck a glance at Jason. “So,” Dick began neutrally, “what were you up to?”\n\n“Training.”\n\n“What training?”\n\n“Breathing.”\n\nDick whistled lowly. “Oooh, that one’s tough.”\n\nJason spared him a glance. “Oh, really?”\n\n“Yep. I always struggled with B’s whole breathing thing. I swear he’s got a fish’s set of lungs. Mine certainly don’t have that sort of capacity.” Said Dick lightly. He shrugged and reclined back on the floor further. “Still can’t get it right.”\n\nJason’s eyes widened. Is the Boy Wonder admitting defeat? Jason took it for what it was – a concession. He grasped the olive branch, fervently replying before it dissipated into the air. “Really? I- You?!”\n\nDick laughed. “Yes, me. Not all of us are The Batman, Little Wing.”\n\n“But I thought the breathing thing was important!” Jason scoffed. “He took me off patrol because of it.”\n\nDick’s expression shuttered, before flashing a blinding smile. It was a minuscule movement; his facial muscles had hardly moved, but Jason had caught it.\n\nSo like Bruce, and also not.\n\nBruce always shut down, retreating from his emotions into the sanctity of the cowl, whereas Dick seemed to run towards them. He painted a sunny expression or amped up the ditzy persona rather than revealing the true nature of his thoughts.\n\nDisarm. Disengage. That was Dick’s motto. Then, you move in for the kill.\n\nJason gave a tentative smile back when Dick leaned in and gestured conspiratorially, as though he were sharing some great secret.\n\nJason shuffled closer. Some part of him knew this was Dick’s charm, a subtle manipulation to win him over. Jason also knew it was working.\n\n“The breathing thing is stupid anyways. You don’t need it, Jay.” Dick pointed a finger at his chest and winked.\n\n“All you need is you, man.” He stretched, and said a little louder, the moment dispelled. “Besides, maybe you’ll be the first to crack it!”\n\nHis brother always had been better than him. The fucker managed to nail the breathing first. Jason had gotten there, too – eventually. They all did. Bruce would have it no other way.\n\nA knock sounded from the door. Dick gazed at Jason with slitted eyes.\n\nJason shrugged. “No clue, man.”\n\nHe reached a hand under his couch, feeling for the gun he kept strapped there.\n\nDick adjusted his position, poised to jump into action with a lithe grace.\n\nThe knock echoed through the apartment again, more insistent this time.\n\nJason stood, slowly creeping towards the door. His bare feet were silent against the laminated flooring as he made his way forward.\n\nFinally, he reached, hand resting on the doorknob when the knock came again, forceful enough to rattle the cheap wood in its equally cheap frame.\n\n“I know you’re in there, Jason. Let me in! I brought croissants. The almond ones I know you like from Anne’s.”\n\nJason flung the door open.\n\nThere, in all her golden-haired glory, stood Steph; in her hand was a large brown bag.\n\nDick’s earlier toast paled in comparison to the glorious smell of warm baked goods wafting towards him. He snatched the bag from Steph’s hand, staunchly ignoring the smug, little look plastered over her face.\n\nTurning back into his apartment, Jason let the door swing behind him. Steph, unfortunately, grasped hold of the door before it could slam shut and sauntered in behind him.\n\n“Steph!”\n\n“Hey, Dick.” Steph called out, before wrinkling her nose.\n\nShe strode over to the windows and threw them open; a gust of fresh air rushed into the apartment, alongside the noise of the city. “Ugh, it smells like man in here.”\n\nDick looked affronted.\n\n“What do you mean?” He and Jason echoed at the same time.\n\nShe shrugged and set down her things on the table. “Budge up.” Steph plonked down between Jason and Dick and pulled out some creased papers from her bag. She waved them towards Jason. “I got an A on that assignment.”\n\n“The Macbeth one?” Jason replied, head buried in the essay. His eyes moved rapidly across the page, scanning over the comments.\n\nHe had offered his aid to the younger vigilante a few months back. It had been innocuous, at first; empty promises to proofread an essay here or there. Over time, Stephanie had somehow coerced Jason into fully writing her essays, particularly once she realised how many times he had thumbed over those second-hand copies of classics.\n\nSteph had never questioned why Jason reread the same books, over and over like a desperate mantra, and she had never pushed the topic of his high school education, callously cut short and never touched again.\n\n“Yep, even used that quote you drilled into me. ‘I am in blood. Returning were as tedious as going over.’” She tapped her head, grinning. “The point of no return.”\n\nJason nodded, pleased. She had been listening.\n\nDick snorted. “Congrats Steph, You’re finally graduating to writing your own essays.”\n\nHe paused, a haunted look of realisation dawning upon him. “Oh god,” Dick whispered to himself, “there’s two of them.”\n\n“Don’t worry, it was just a one-off.” Steph said, uncharacteristically bashful. “Anyways, Jason here will be writing the next three, per our agreement.” She tacked on belatedly, with a pointed look at Jason, who swiftly avoided her gaze.\n\nAh, yes – their agreement. Jason had managed to strike a deal with Steph. One self-written essay for three of his own, with the promise to tackle a set text a week. It had been a triumph when Jason finally managed to secure her assent; Stephanie struck a hard deal.\n\n“We’ll see.” He said, noncommittally. “Did you read the other texts?”\n\nShe rolled her eyes. “Sorta. I started on Tuesday and then I just- got distracted?”\n\n“By what? Patrol?”\n\n“More like injured, if it was on Tuesday.” Dick muttered.\n\nSteph looked betrayed. “Dick!”\n\n“Injured?” Jason asked quietly. Dick, meanwhile had jumped out of his seat and out of Steph’s range as she glared at him mutinously.\n\n“You know what they say about snitches, Grayson.” Stephanie warned. “Sleep with one eye open, man.”\n\n“Always do.” Dick replied with a laugh, already having crossed the room to the front door.\n\nA soft electronic trill sounded off. “Oh, look! I’m getting a call. See ya.” He called before the door shut softly behind him.\n\nJason let his gaze run over Steph’s form, assessing for any signs of injury or weakness. “You hurt?” He asked.\n\n“Barely a scratch. I can handle myself.”\n\n“Bet you can.” Jason didn’t doubt that. He switched tactics. Focus on common ground. Don’t let her clamp up. “Doesn’t explain why you’re behind on the reading.”\n\n“Won’t you let up?” Steph groaned, before smiling innocently. “I’m sick, remember?”\n\n“Hardly.”\n\nShe sulked, sinking deeper into the couch, the worn leather creaking alongside her. Jason waited, instead fixing his gaze on the lampshade in the corner. The two sat alongside each other, gazing at Jason’s lacklustre décor.\n\nIt seemed out of all of Bruce’s ragtag team of orphans, misfits and killers, Steph was the one Jason could tolerate the most. Between genius CEOs and legacy heirs, Steph was strangely … unremarkable.\n\nNo, that wasn’t right. Her intellect and ability were equally on par with the others, but her place had always seemed a little more tenuous.\n\nShe had never integrated as deeply with the ‘family’ – whether that be her refusal to take on the Wayne name or her infamously short stint as Robin.\n\nEveryone was so tight-lipped about that.\n\nSure, she had earned her place through blood and pain, like the rest of them but she seemed to revolve a little further away from the orbit of Batman. It felt as though she were disillusioned. Less polished. They were not awfully close, all things considered, but Steph was just as adamant as in her negotiations. She swept her way into Jason's life like a swift-moving hurricane; he was merely along for the ride. Their little breakfasts were her form of repayment and knowledge of their newly formed deal was well-guarded.\n\nThey both knew Bruce would hardly approve of any of his little fosterlings willingly associating with Jason outside the boundaries of the mask. On his end, only Dick knew; Jason couldn't be sure if Steph had mentioned it to anyone, let alone who. All he knew was the consequences of getting caught would be hers to bear. He refused to be under Batman's thumb any longer.\n\nSteph narrowed her eyes at him, pulling him out of his fuzzy thoughts. “Stop copying me.”\n\n“I’m not.” Said Jason, staring firmly ahead.\n\n“Don’t lie. What’re you looking at, then?”\n\nJason scoffed, wrapping his arms over his chest. “What are you looking at? This is my place. I can look where I want.”\n\n“You little- the bookshelf.”\n\n“Lampshade.”\n\nShe crossed her arms. “Of course, you’d say that now.”\n\n“Whatever.”\n\nThey lapsed into another silence, considerably more tense. Steph sighed, a clear sign of her cracking first. Jason held in his smirk.\n\nHe had perfected his prolonged silences by fashioning them after Alfred. Why learn from Bruce when the master was right there?\n\nAlfred’s silences were copious, manifesting in a myriad of ways. The butler had mastered manipulating the quiet to do his bidding. He could make you rip out your nails from anxiety-inducing noiselessness, or he could comfort you without a word. Alfred’s true power lay in the inaudible, the space between the insubstantial spoken word.\n\n“I went to a bonfire,” Steph admitted. “in the Alley.”\n\n“When you were supposed to be reading?”\n\n“When I was supposed to be reading.”\n\nJason cracked a smile. “Was it fun, at least?”\n\n“Yeah,” Steph replied with a soft smile of her own, “nice seeing everyone, too. Feels like it’s been forever. Met some new faces too.”\n\n“Tough balancing a social life by day and crime-fighting by night.” Jason would know. That’s why he had devoted himself fully to the moniker of Red Hood. There was no Jason Todd – not really.\n\n“Even tougher with school. So, do me a solid? I gotta graduate, man.” She pleaded.\n\nJason sighed. “What essay is it this time?”\n\n***\n\nMilo had been following the boy.\n\nHe was surprisingly entertained by the child’s endeavours, his strange ambling around Crime Alley.\n\nMilo watched, cautiously hidden in one of Gotham’s many looming alcoves, at Danny below him; he was handing out pieces of paper to nearby vendors and shops before swiftly exiting and moving on to the next.\n\nIt seemed that the events of the night prior had little effect on the boy-king, barring the fading mottled green on his cheek, a memory of a bruise.\n\nA spark of annoyance flared to life low in his gut. How arrogant. To disregard him, to deny him. This Danny, made of untested mettle, was unfit to be their King – to be his King.\n\nMilo was also begrudgingly impressed at how quickly the boy seemed to be healing.\n\nHowever, it was clear to Milo how the boy cared little for anyone other than himself. Let him prance amongst the living, half-wasting away in squalor and filth. Milo had had enough of that during his own short life. He had no desire to relive it as a bystander again.\n\nStill, even now as he watched Danny, a distant tug of something pulled at him, perhaps some remnant of his life, long past.\n\nMilo felt a presence appear beside him.\n\n“You’re as dull as ever, Milo. Age does not become you.”\n\n“Not unlike yourself then.”\n\nClockwork shifted, his body morphing from the form of a middle-aged man to a child, short and baby-faced. “Is this more your speed, old friend?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“So difficult to please.” Clockwork sighed. He raised a hand to his eyebrow, shielding his gaze from the sun. Always with the dramatics, Milo thought scornfully. Never straight to the point.\n\n“Why are you here?”\n\nClockwork peered over the ledge, glancing down to where Danny was stuck waving his arms around at the equally exuberant shopkeeper. “Keeping an eye on our boy, of course.” He raised an eyebrow at Milo. “I’ve got some bets running on him, you know?”\n\nMilo had heard all about Clockwork’s ridiculous betting ring. It was the sort of depravity that any King with good sense would have put an end to millennia ago. Unfortunately, it seems Clockwork’s little criminal enterprise had slipped through the cracks more often than not over the years. He always did have a funny way of evading the consequences.\n\n“Your boy is unready. Untested.”\n\n“On that, my dear friend, we can see eye to eye.” Clockwork said, with a pointed wink.\n\nMilo scowled. “Height jokes. Hilarious.” He muttered.\n\n“Our boy will learn. He already has been.”\n\nThat, at least, was true. Milo had witnessed the ease with which the boy utilised his abilities, slipping them on and off like a silk glove. All the more incredible to do so in his human form, Milo begrudgingly admitted.\n\nAnd yet, “He loses control. He is weak.”\n\nMilo had also seen the way the boy’s blue eyes flashed bright green, fervently overcome with the dormant rage Milo had triggered in him.\n\nThe venom he had spewed in favour of actually exerting even a modicum of his power was … disappointing, uninspiring even. The thrumming thread of untapped power lay unused, begging to be released.\n\nYes, the boy-king was weak.\n\nMilo would never voice the swift sense of trepidation that had seized him wholly. He would never confess that low sinking feeling in his gut, unfamiliar to him but on one occasion – his death. But the moment was fleeting and the inane displeasure rose in him like a tidal wave, washing the purported warnings of doom to the deep shores of his mind.\n\n“No,” Clockwork disagreed, stroking his wizardly white beard that spanned down his pudgy chest. “The boy is far from weak. He loses control because he is too strong. He has too much power inside him, and it only grows by the day.”\n\n“He cannot control himself.” Milo snapped. “Therefore, he is weak. He is so desperate for affection he actually befriended the fucking buffoons who stole his things. He endured my abuse with little more than a harsh word in his defence. The boy is too …”\n\n“Kind.” Clockwork supplied, sympathy outpouring from every line in his ridiculously mismatched body. “Danny is kind.”\n\n“Actually,” Milo said, derision dripping off every syllable, “I was going to say foolish.”\n\n“Naturally.” Clockwork interjected, an amused glint as he watched Milo’s tirade.\n\nMilo ignored him. “But kind is just as bad. Once again, he is unsuitable.” he finished, matter-of-factly.\n\n“Perhaps,” Clockwork argued softly, “a kind King is what the Infinite Realms need currently.”\n\n“No. No then. That is the end of it.” Milo protested, sticking out his chin in defiance.\n\nDanny, below them, was unbelievably being chased by a flock of pigeons. How did he even manage to get himself into that situation, Milo wondered.\n\nClockwork looked at him curiously. “My friend, you have always been stubborn, mulish even, but you have never been stupid.\n\n“Let us not deny the perils of letting the boy repudiate himself. It will do us no good. It will do him no good.”\n\nMilo snorted. “They’ll eat him alive. He won’t get anywhere on soft-hearted altruism. We need a King who at least has a fucking backbone!”\n\n“He can be kind and firm.”\n\n“They will dance on his immortal bones.”\n\n“He will endure it.” Clockwork said firmly. Never afraid to platter up a sacrifice, that one. “A trial by fire.”\n\nMilo knew all too well the sorts of trials ghosts came up with. Years of watching time pass by had made many of them cruel, and distanced from their once cherished humanity.\n\nIf they were going to force the boy into it, he should – at the very least – be prepared. “Train him now.” Milo said, half-startled by the words coming out of his mouth. “We get him ready. Help him prepare.”\n\nClockwork snuck a glance at him. “Guide him? Elucidate to him our ways?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Pity? From you, Milo?” Clockwork drawled. He faced him fully now, a knowing smile growing on his face. “I never thought I’d see the day.”\n\n“Shut up. You’re always nattering on-”\n\n“Nattering?! My friend, how could you-”\n\n“Always trying to make it seem like you know best. I bet you’ll say next it was your idea all along.”\n\nClockwork grinned, before lowering his head demurely. “Well…”\n\n“Oh, spare me.” Milo griped sarcastically.\n\nHe looked to the sky, at dense clouds covering the far-off hazy glow of the stars. “If he hates himself so deeply, who’s to say that won’t extend to us?” Milo said under his breath.\n\nClockwork, ever attentive, heard him anyway. “Exactly, Milo. Danny is dangerous.”\n\n“Dangerous he may be, but he is still young.”\n\n“He won’t be allowed to remain a child for much longer. I know how you get about the young, but war is coming. His power overflows. If he continues to resist then… well, it is all the more reason why we must act now.” Clockwork urged. “If we wait, Danny will begin to face most unpleasant consequences.”\n\nA part of Milo secretly felt the little shit deserved it, but the more rational, cognizant part implored him to act.\n\n“I already tried.”\n\n“Giving up so soon?”\n\n“He’s a lost cause.” Milo stated half-heartedly. He searched for Danny in the crowd, but it seemed he had meandered out of purview\n\n“Be that as it may, you still have something swirling around in that head of yours? Others have their gaze set firmly upon him. Not just in the Infinite Realms. Surely, you know that, given how your human has received word.”\n\nMilo nodded, paying no heed to Clockwork's mentions of Oma. Her business was her own. “Maybe it’s time for a little trip back home then. Tonight?”\n\nClockwork chuckled, “Oh! This is why you are my dearest friend, Milo. Always so devious. Onwards! To the motherland!”\n\n“Don’t call it that, you wacko.”\n\nAnd don’t pretend like it wasn’t secretly your plan all along. Milo could distinguish Clockwork’s machinations for what they were. Like recognises like, after all.\n\n“The fatherland?”\n\nMilo heaved a sigh. It was going to be a long wait till nightfall. A longer wait still, for the boy-king to be ready."
