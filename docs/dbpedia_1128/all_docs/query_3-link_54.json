They are the ultimate low carb Game Day finger food!\n\nHave I ever mentioned that chicken wings are my favorite food group? Yes, I really do think these unassuming little chicken parts deserve their own food group. I consider them to be a very important part of my low carb diet.\n\nAnd these Garlic Parmesan Wings are seriously addictive. They have a crispy, golden brown exterior and succulent meat. The buttery, garlicky sauce certainly doesn’t hurt either!\n\nMy whole family loves these keto chicken wings. We find ourselves jostling and fighting for that last one on the tray. Even when I make a double batch!\n\nCan’t get enough of that garlic parmesan combo? Check out my Keto Garlic Parmesan Knots made with fathead dough, and my Air Fryer Brussels Sprouts for more.\n\nEasy crispy wings at home\n\nWant to know how to make crispy keto chicken wings in your oven? This little tip blew my mind when I first learned about it. But it really does get the skin nice and crispy without the trouble of deep frying.\n\nAnd it uses a common ingredient that you likely have in your pantry right now: Baking powder.\n\nI first discovered this little trick from Recipe Tin Eats. I found it hard to believe that adding a little baking powder would result in such delectable wings. But it does, it really does!\n\nAnd I’ve since used this same trick for other recipes such as Buffalo Drumsticks and Cajun Wings. I even used it to crisp up the skin for some Keto Fried Chicken.\n\nReader Testimonials\n\n“Hello heaven! These wings are unreal – bursting with flavor, and crazy easy! I have a new go-to game day recipe!” — Courtney\n\n“Made these tonight for “living room tailgating” and they were perfect!! Served them with a Bleu cheese/ranch dressing and that really went well with the garlic Parmesan!” — Naomi\n\n“THESE WINGS ARE SOOOOOO GOOD!! THESE WINGS ARE AMAZING!! Follow the directions – you won’t be disappointed! I NEVER leave feedback, but man, you gotta make these wings!” — Mary\n\nIngredients you need\n\nThis post may contain Amazon or other affiliate links. As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.\n\nChicken wings: You can use fresh or frozen wings. If using frozen, make sure to thaw them completely. Pat the wings VERY dry before adding the baking powder and seasonings.\n\nBaking powder: This is the secret ingredient to crispy keto chicken wings. Use aluminum free baking powder, as some people notice a bitter taste with brands that contain it. Don’t use baking soda as it will taste very strong and unpleasant.\n\nButter: You can use salted or unsalted butter. I tend to use salted for savory recipes like this.\n\nGarlic: Either press or mince the garlic finely. You want small pieces to get good coverage over the wings.\n\nParmesan: I like to use the very finely, somewhat powdery, grated Parmesan that comes in a tub in the cheese section, because it sticks to the wings a little better. But you can also use freshly grated Parmesan. Note that I am not referring to the junky Kraft variety that comes in a green can, as that often contains fillers and anti-caking agents.\n\nFresh parsley: Fresh parsley adds better flavor and color, but if you only have dried, you can use that too. Use only 1 ½ teaspoons of dried parsley.\n\nSeasonings: Paprika, cayenne, salt, and pepper.\n\nStep-by-step directions\n\n1. Coat with baking powder: Place half of the wings in a heavy duty ziploc bag and sprinkle with half of the baking powder. Shake vigorously to coat, then place the wings a greased baking. Repeat with the remaining wings and the remaining baking powder.\n\n2. Add seasoning: In a spice jar, combine the paprika, black pepper, and cayenne. Sprinkle lightly over the wings on both sides.\n\n3. Bake at low temp: Bake 30 minutes at 250ºF minutes, until the wings feel dry and crisp. This first baking phase helps render the fat and crisp up the skin.\n\n4. Bake again: Increase the oven heat to 425ºF. Place the wings back on the rack, skin side down. Bake 15 minutes, then flip over once more and bake another 10 minutes.\n\n5. Make the sauce: Melt the butter in a microwaveable safe bowl or in a saucepan. Whisk in the garlic and parsley. Pour the sauce over the chicken wings and then sprinkle with the Parmesan. Toss well to coat. Sprinkle with chopped parsley. Sprinkle with salt to taste.\n\nExpert tips\n\nThis is honestly the best method for oven-baked wings out there. The baking powder does add a fair amount of saltiness, as does the Parmesan, so use a light hand with the salt until you know how they taste.\n\nYou can also prepare these garlic parmesan wings in an air fryer. You don’t need the baking powder to crisp them up, but many readers still use it to make the wings extra crispy.\n\nAir Fryer Method: Place the wings skin side down on the air fryer rack and cook at 400ºF for 10 minutes. Flip them over and cook again for another 10 to 15 minutes, until the skin is crispy. I use the air fryer for my pickle brined wings.\n\nStore any leftovers in an air tight container in the fridge for 3 or 4 days. You can re-heat them in a warm oven, although they will never be quite as crispy as when they are freshly cooked.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nCan I eat chicken wings on a keto diet?\n\nWhile chicken wings on their own are keto-friendly, you will want to steer clear of\n\nwings that have a thick breading or are served with sugar-laden sauces. These keto garlic parmesan wings are super crispy and have only 1.3g net carbs per serving so they’re a great choice.\n\nWhat wing sauce can I eat on keto?\n\nLook for wings that are coated in naturally sugar-free seasonings and sauce. Classic Buffalo sauce is usually sugar-free, as is garlic parmesan and lemon pepper. Cilantro lime is another good option. And you can always use my sugar-free BBQ sauce if you’re craving sweet wings!\n\nWhat is the secret to crispy chicken wings?\n\nBaking powder is slightly alkaline and it raises the pH levels on the chicken’s skin. This breaks the proteins down more easily giving you the crispy brown skin we crave. It also reacts with the natural juices in the wings to form carbon dioxide. This creates small bubbles in the skin which also helps create a crunchy texture.\n\nWhat to serve with keto chicken wings\n\nEnjoy these delicious buttery wings as is or serve with one of these delicious sauces:\n\nChunky Feta Dressing\n\nChipotle Ranch Dressing\n\nSugar Free Carolina BBQ Sauce\n\nKeto BBQ Sauce\n\nSugar Free Honey Mustard\n\nGarlic Parmesan Wings\n\nTruly crispy oven baked wings with a buttery garlic parmesan sauce. These keto chicken wings are a fan favorite for a reason! You will be licking your fingers and asking for more.\n\n4.90 from 65 votes\n\nPrint Pin\n\nPrep Time: 15 minutes minutes\n\nCook Time: 50 minutes minutes\n\nTotal Time: 1 hour hour 5 minutes minutes\n\nServings: 8 servings\n\nCalories: 386kcal\n\nIngredients\n\n3 lbs chicken wings\n\n1 ½ tablespoon baking powder\n\n¾ teaspoon paprika\n\n¾ teaspoon black pepper\n\n¼ teaspoon cayenne\n\n¼ cup salted butter\n\n4 cloves garlic minced\n\n1 tablespoon chopped parsley\n\n⅓ cup grated parmesan\n\nInstructions\n\nPreheat the oven to 250ºF and place a baking rack over a rimmed baking sheet.
