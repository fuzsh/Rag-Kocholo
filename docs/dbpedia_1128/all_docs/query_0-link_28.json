        "text": "12 race card with 3 stakes that go as races 9,10 and 11!\n\nRace 1)Turf 1 Mile|3YOMd Sp Wt 45k|Purse: $45k-Rails 96\n\n#2)Coach Temple – Colt by Curlin comes in with a good series of works, and the family tree, other than the sire leans towards the green stuff. Love the April 5th work, shows a happy horse going easy even on dirt. Ears flopping backwards and forwards. His workmate Run Devil just broke her maiden in fine fashion in her 2020 debut in MSW company! Jock trainer combo a gaudy 38%.\n\n#5)Turn of Events – Maker thought enough of him to run as a maiden in the G3 Palm Beach (he doesn’t misplace his stock)\n\n#7)East Lex – The “other” Maker certainly will deserve some attention off a live race at the Fairgrounds.\n\n#10)Hero D’oro – No idea what to think of this $1.2 million dollar purchase ? Other than he will get bet ???? Annulment is the only stakes runner from the Dam.\n\nRace3)Dirt 1Â Miles|3YOMd Sp Wt 45k|Purse: $45k\n\n#4)Or’effice – Comes out of a hot maiden race and did encounter some trouble (I’m not a steward so I will leave that to them ) Was likely best in there. Posted a gaudy 94 Beyer fig and Saez climbs back aboard. Horse to beat.\n\n#5)Hard Lighting – Split the field in debut, the winner of that came back to win impressively last weekend. Delgado solid 2nd time out.\n\n#7)Newsworthy – Well bred son of Tapit debuts for Mott. I was a massive fan of his Dam ,G1 winner Sweet Lulu, but she has yet to produce anything of merit at all. He does however come in with an above average series of works for Mott at Payson, including some bullets that bounce off the page.\n\nPRICE!\n\nRace #4)Dirt 6 Furlongs|3lcMd 50000(50-40)|Purse: $35k\n\n#3)Invaluable – Hombred for Airdrie Stud (they breed a very good horse) debuts here off a strong series of good looking works. You can catch her latest one on XBTV.com in which she looks focused and ready!\n\n#1)Teenage Kicks – solid for 50k here.\n\n#8)She so Naughty – Another firster, this one for Pletcher and Zayas who have a 30% strike rate together.\n\nRace 6)Dirt 6 Furlongs|3YOcOC50k/SAL50k|Purse: $33k\n\n#2)Sweetheart Deal – Daughter of Kantharous was impressive breaking her maiden for 50K last June. Race a good 2nd in the slop in stakes company in her next and has not been seen since. Abreu 20% off the bench and this filly comes in with better works than prior to her debut ( oh the beauty of XBTV.com) She does tend to lean out a little but that apparently is the norm.\n\n#3)Loriloupies – Broke her maiden for 50k by 6 1/2 in Feb. Like the fact she is protected here. That 46 2/5 work jumps off the page, but note she was asked all the way down the lane for that.\n\nRace 8)Dirt 1 Mile|4lOC 25k/N1X|Purse: $46k\n\n#2)Overdeliver – Found a new running style last time out and now seems more dangerous than ever. The 4/3/1 record at GP doesn’t hurt either.\n\n#3)Kid Bourbon – Loved his race on the turf last time , but hey his dirt races are nothing to be sniffed at either. Keeps Lopez aboard.\n\nRace 9)Turf 1Â Miles|3YOçHoneyRydrB75k|Purse: $75k – Rails 96\n\n#2)Highland Glory – Daughter of Sky Mesa apparently has no limits, should be handy enough to sit in a good spot with the rails at 96. Perhaps the only negative is Paco jumps off to ride Bajan Girl??\n\n#10)Iyvetsu – No doubt whatsoever about this daughter of Tapits ability, but can we trust her not to blow the start or not to blow the turn. Local work was good, straight and true, she works and runs in an extension blinker and showed no sign at all of lugging out in this work below.(perhaps her exercise rider should take out his license?)\n\nWorkout: https://xbtv.com//video/ivyetsu-(outside)-and-uncle-fester-worked-4-furlongs-in/ivyetsu-outside-and-uncle-fester-worked-4-furlongs-in-52-40-at-palm-meadows-on-march-30th-2020/\n\n#12)Seducer – Draws the far gate and will utilize her speed in a race with not a ton of it. As I watch the races at GP on a Thursday its “bucketing it down” and I can’t help thinking she will act well on a softer course. She broke her maiden at Aqueduct in Nov , there is no way that turf was firm. She won in wire to wire fashion.\n\nRace 10)Dirt 7 Furlongs|3lDBigDramaB100k|Purse: $100k\n\n#3)Network Effect – lost all chance at the start of his 2020 debut and still rallied to be beaten just 1/2 a length. Perfect at the distance and gets Ortiz.\n\nRace 11)Turf 1A Miles|3YOEngChnnlB75k|Purse: $75k – Rail 96\n\n#5)Buy Me Candy – Terrific debut Tampa and followed that up with a convincing score at the fairgrounds March. Has the ability to sit close enough but not on the lead. I Think he is a really good horse.\n\n#4)Gufo – Will be running late, can handle a softer turf and Ortiz/Clement are 42%\n\n#3)Doc Boy – Numbers wise a cut below the rest but rarely runs a bad race! Tampa race was visually impressive!\n\nMusings From My Grade One Couch: Gulfstream Park Analysis for May 2nd, 2020"
