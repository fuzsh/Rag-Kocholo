        "text": "It is often said, usually with an expression of grave concern, that they are the audiences of tomorrow. But why shouldn't young people also be the theatre audiences of today? This week, London's Soho Theatre is launching its young writers' season; as its associate director, Jonathan Lloyd, puts it: \"Everywhere we go, there's this huge hunger for theatre.\" So how can that hunger be satisfied?\n\nThere are plenty of theatre practitioners who would love to know. To them, wooing young audiences is a Holy Grail - not least because it's one route to more secure funding. But the road theatre has travelled in its efforts to seduce the young, while paved with good intentions, has often detoured via misjudgment and embarrassment. This is certainly how it is remembered by Leo Butler, a graduate of the Royal Court's young writers' scheme, now writing for theatre-for-young-people specialists Theatre Centre. \"When I was at school,\" he says, \"we had theatre-in-education groups coming in, and I remember really patronising dramas that had no drama and were about just one issue.\"\n\nWhen theatre stops preaching to teenagers and tries to represent them, more pitfalls lie in wait. \"I've seen a few plays about young people, and they tend to be 'teenage drama' about teenage angst,\" says Neela Dolezalova, who at 17 is having her first full-length play staged at Soho Theatre this week. \"A lot of young people feel that they're made to look stupid on stage.\"\n\nGiven the sullied reputation of young people's drama, small wonder if its target audience were to consider theatre a little uncool. But do they? Ola Animashawun, who runs the Royal Court's young writers' group, which visits schools and community centres well beyond theatre's established reach, thinks not. The Court's scheme is way oversubscribed, as is Soho's. \"That's because young people are allowed to get actively involved,\" says Animashawun. \"Of the range of media available to young people - film, TV, radio, internet - we tend to think that theatre must come quite low. But it allows young people a chance to express themselves and that's what they really like doing.\"\n\nIn fact, there is no performing art as well placed to harness young people's eagerness to understand and express themselves. \"A lot of young people don't usually feel as if they're being listened to,\" says Dolezalova, who should know. \"More and more young people are getting involved in creative activities because it's a way of getting a voice.\"\n\nAs a point of policy, Theatre Centre's playwrights develop their scripts in collaboration with young people, and in response to what is delighting, depressing or preoccupying them. For them, involving young people is crucial: not talking down to them, but taking their lively intelligence into account. Butler's play for the company, Devotion, is set in an unspecified war-zone; he workshopped that theme with children and found that, \"They were electric when talking about it. It was inspiring to hear them debating about the war.\"\n\nThe received wisdom is that young people want to see their own lives dramatised on stage, and their own immediate concerns discussed. Says Animashawun: \"Young people do often write about their relationships with their parents. And they do write about escaping, or wanting to escape, because they feel stuck.\" Dolezalova's playwriting career, however, proves that not all young people have such a narrow viewpoint. Her latest work, Playing Fields, is her first to broach teen experiences; its predecessors depicted gang warfare in 1970s America, a conversation between a rapist and his victim, and a 60-year-old sailor in search of his daughter. \"I just love to find the best way of telling a story,\" she says. \"And if that means I have to set a play on a mountaintop with no characters except a crow, that's absolutely fine.\"\n\nHer words also suggest that young people's supposed preference for tele-naturalism is at best a half-truth. It is often argued that theatre for young people should seek to emulate the recorded media. But the theatre companies most beloved of the young in recent times, such as Frantic Assembly and Peepolykus, are those who are flamboyantly theatrical and to whom naturalism is a dirty word. In fact, theatre may be at its most appealing to the young when it makes of a virtue of its artificiality. Rosamunde Hutt, director of Theatre Centre, says that it is wonderful \"when the kids have gym or assembly, then they see their school hall transformed for a play. It's quite a potent symbol of how theatre can transform.\" It cuts through drama's celebrity mystique, too, for schoolkids to see actors at close quarters, lugging kit.\n\nIt's clear that theatre isn't as irrelevant to young people as we are often told. They're not alienated by the actual art-form so much as the structures and habits they see imposed on it by the adult world. Think high ticket prices, and hushed, hallowed atmospheres. Think lack of novelty or urgency. That is why the poet Benjamin Zephaniah, whose play Listen to Your Parents is being staged by Theatre Centre, thinks performing in schools is a necessity, practically as well as theatrically. \"As kids growing up in Birmingham,\" he says, \"we did not go to the theatres in central Birmingham. If something was staged in the park or in our school, then we'd hang around and watch it. But there was no way we were going uptown to some posh theatre.\"\n\nAnd it's not just the atmosphere that surrounds theatres. Paul Medford, who directs Zephaniah's play, says that the choices artistic directors make are as much to blame. \"By tending to stage some American 1920s musical rather than something by a young playwright from Brixton,\" he says, \"theatre has chosen to interest one sort of audience and not another.\" Actor and director Richard Wilson, who directs young writers' work at the Royal Court, agrees that new plays are the thing. \"Young people like stories by living people about living things.\"\n\nThe challenge for the mainstream is to capitalise on theatre's popularity in schools and among the very young; to establish a continuity between fresh, participative, bullshit-free youth theatre and the stuff that grown-ups watch. \"There's an artificial divide that has to be crossed between the idea of young people's theatre and adult theatre,\" says Hutt. \"Everyone involved in theatre has to understand that this is our audience too, and not just some annoying noisy messy type of person who has come in by accident.\"\n\nTheatre itself, and not just young people, would benefit from the shift. \"There's nothing like watching kids when they have a piece of theatre that really connects with them,\" says Zephaniah, \"the joy on their faces, the way they talk about it when they're leaving the theatre or the gym or wherever it's performed. The way they get on the bus and are still talking about it. That's live theatre, man. This is not dead. It really is about making it relevant to people - bringing it to life and not making it something dead from the past.\""
