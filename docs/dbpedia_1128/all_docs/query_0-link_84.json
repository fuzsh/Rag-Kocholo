        "text": "Scene by Scene walkthrough\n\nThis page will list all of the scenes and the possible things you can do. Refer to this page as you go through the overall walkthrough. When the scene starts, it will show the title of the scene on screen, you can use that to look up the scene tips in this page. You will not see all of these scenes in your play through. In fact, this might not even be all of them :) These are the ones I saw in my play throughs or in other play throughs. You won't 100% every character's story line in a normal play through.\n\nSome scenes may not show the title until you've done something first, so if nothing has appeared yet, make sure you look all around first for tapes, food and money, before choosing interactions. The scene name will usually appear after that first interaction is chosen.\n\nHide ads\n\nThis page only covers the optional scenes. Any mandatory scene that you get for story purposes is on the overall walk through page.\n\nAchievements\n\nThe overall walk through page covered 9 of the 12 achievements. The info in this page will get you the other 3.\n\nMany of the scenes below have a phone booth in them, it will be noted in the scene details below. There are 2 achievements that are phone call related, and if you have $12 you can get them done in the same scene. There are some scenes where the phone doesn't work until after the event, the details will mention when.\n\nTo unlock the phone booth achievements:\n\nWalk over to the pay phone, and you will see a choice to call home for $1 - choose that and unlock\n\nHomesick\n\nYou dialed home\n\nIf you have at least $11 remaining, you can place the next call - $1 for the call and $10 to make a donation. Interact with the phone again to place another call. You will have to dial a specific number to donate to a politician's campaign fund. There are two candidates, so two numbers to pick. If you want to donate to Tyrak, call 96555, if you want to donate to Flores, call 96777, and select donation, unlocking:\n\nCampaign Funder\n\nYou called and donated to a campaign fund\n\nThe last one is for collecting 18 cassette tapes. On the overall walk through we covered scenes that would have resulted in 4 tapes. In the details below, you will see there are about 29 more tapes that can be found. Some of those seem to always happen in the scene, others appear randomly, so they may not appear. The game will give you more than enough opportunities to get you 18, but you should be sure to grab them as you see them. After getting 18 tapes you will unlock:\n\nCollect 'em All\n\nYou collected all cassette tapes\n\nFiller Scenes\n\nThere will be some scenes that don't have a name and exist primarily as filler based on what exit route you chose from the previous scene, and whether or not there is a story scene that would make sense based on that choice. These scenes won't have a title, and they won't have one of the story characters involved. I've seen some in a car, and some in a bus. In both cases, there was very little to do other than interact with what you can, and then after a bit you will have an exit to select.\n\nCharacter Scenes\n\nA View to a Kill\n\nBefore talking turn around and look in the bag for a cassette tape (TAPE 4). Talk to Mitch and Stan. They will tell you how to move the cycle left and right, try it out, and then talk to them some more. A taxi they are looking for passes by, so they want to chase. Get up in the back of the cycle to begin a mini game where you have to weave in and out of traffic by going left and right around cars in your lane, and in the incoming traffic lane. Your cycle has a health bar, but I found the game to be pretty straightforward and didn't lose all the health. Eventually you catch up to the Taxi and a cutscene. Talk some more, and then choose how you want to exit.\n\nAbout a girl\n\nUp ahead on the path you will see John walking and talking to himself. Before interacting with him, head to the left a bit to find a campsite. There is a backpack you can search here for a Cassette Tape (TAPE 5). Catchup with John and talk with him and follow him. You will get to a rock he can't move. Approach him and he will boost you over and jump over himself. Now he wants to race up the hill, so go ahead and do that, win or lose. You arrive at the top of the hill where there is a camper and a soccer ball nearby. Play soccer. He will be goalie and you get to kick to try to score. There will be a moving gauge to the left and right. Choose to kick whenever and he will either block it or you will score. I had some success scoring when the gauge was about 1/3rd full on either side. However it ends doesn't matter, you will be talking with him again. Eventually you will be able to leave. In order to leave you have to walk down the hill. Before choosing a way to proceed there is a cardboard tent nearby where you can rest if needed. It will be far right of the bus shelter.\n\nBeat It\n\nYou will be outside of a campground. Just to your right, there is a baseball bat you can take. Use it to make your way through this abandoned campground. You will eventually come to a clearing, and Jarod will appear. Talk to him. After the conversation you can grab money from a table nearby. Talk to him some more, and then help him destroy the radio tower in the center of the clearing. Once that's taken care of you will be sitting with Jarod. There is a drink on the table, and you need to talk to him some more. Eventually you will have your cue to make an exit, you need to use the fallen radio tower as a path out of the campground to choose your exit.\n\nBeep Boop Beep\n\nThis is a location scene, a roadside restaurant, with Alex. Before we interact with Alex (who is inside the restaurant), outside on the right hand side is a teenager selling food and a cassette tape (TAPE 6). Inside the restaurant on the left hand side are 2 bathrooms, open the door to the leftmost one, there was an ATM Card on the ground. Take that and use it at the ATM to take out as much money as it lets you. Right next to the ATM is a pay phone. You can use the phone to unlock the 2 phone related achievements mentioned above. Head to the far right side of the restaurant where there are some arcade games. Talk to Alex, and then play the Pwong game with him. Feel free to play, but it's just quicker to let him win. Afterwards you will sit and talk with him. You can drink something here. Now follow him around outside to the back of the restaurant. He will hack the lock, opening the back room. The door will close behind you. I found money in the desk (open the drawers). There is a safe here that you can't open (yet). If you know how to pick a lock or break a lock, there are car keys in the locker. In order to continue the event, you will have to look at 2 newspaper articles. There are ones in different boxes near the desk, and one in the locker. Reading 2 articles will continue the conversation with Alex where he teaches you the Hacking ability. Now you can open the safe to get more money. The store manager will be coming, so you'll need to hide. Right by the safe is a bigger locker that has a hide option, use it for a cutscene. Ask the manager to let you go and he does. You will be able to leave, but before you do, head back into the restaurant. You can now get behind the counter. In the kitchen area there was a frozen burger in the freezer that you can reheat using the microwave and then eat. Behind the front counter, you can steal some more money from the cash register. On the counter next to the register was another cassette tape in my play throughs (TAPE 7). Lastly before you leave, if you need some rest, there is a cardboard tent area behind the building. That finishes up this scene. Feel free to choose whichever way you want to progress to the next scene.\n\nBetter be good to me\n\nThere is a cardboard box you can rest in just to the right of the motel. Don't use it yet. Go to the far end of the parking lot, there will be a motel office with a shed next to it with a red door. If you have lock picking and hacking abilities at this point, you can pick the lock on the red door to enter the shed, and then hack the safe inside for some money. Talk to the motel clerk in the motel office. At this point you will have to choose how you rest - you can spend money on a room, or use the cardboard rest area pointed out in the beginning. Regardless of your choice you will wake up in Jarod's room. Talk to him a bit, and then he will ask you to hide in the closet. There is a closet/wardrobe nearby select hide to enter it. Listen to the conversation and then look to your left. Talk with Jarod some more and then follow him into the bathroom to continue the conversation. At some point you will have to leave the bathroom and wait. There is a possibility to pick the lock of the main door to try to escape, but I didn't attempt it, I just waited it out. The motel clerk will knock on the door. You will have to answer his questions in a way that gets him to leave. The choices seem pretty obvious (or they don't really affect the outcome). Once the motel clerk leaves, Jarod will give you money and let you leave. You will have to walk out to the parking lot for exit choices to appear.\n\nBlame it on the Rain\n\nYou are in a truck with John. Before talking to him, open up the glovebox and get the cassette tape inside (TAPE 8). Now start talking to John. After a bit he falls asleep. Use the radio to play music to wake him up. Talk some more, after a bit, look forward and choose rest. When you wake up, you will see John is asleep again. Look under the dash and press the button there. Talk again, and then you can choose to go into the back. Look at the picture, and then look at a piece of paper that has a recipe. Open the cabinet, and you will need to collect 2 ingredients. There is one on each shelf. You have to move other items out of the way by shifting things left or right, and forwards or backwards, just to get each ingredient close to you so you can grab them. The first ingredient is a cucumber, the second is coffee beans. On the opposite shelf is the last ingredient you need, ginseng. Shake it all to create the drink. You will get the vitality ability. You can choose your exit option.\n\nBoom Boom Boom Boom\n\nThis is a filler scene, but with a title. There is no story here, there may be money on the glovebox. Interact with other options until an exit choice appears.\n\nBurnin\n\nYou are on the side of the road and up ahead there looks to be a party or festival going on. You can see Sonya's white limo nearby. At the very far end there is a phone booth you can use for the 2 phone achievements if you haven't gotten them yet. As you approach you will see Sonya, you will talk with her to start the scene, and then follow her in towards the party. There is more talking and then you split up for a bit. You can explore around here and play some games if you want. The next step is to find Sonya (she's to your right sitting down) and talk with her. You will now play the cups and balls game. The ball goes under a cup, they get shuffled and you guess which cup has the ball. You will play a few rounds of this, you can win or lose, it won't matter, although some of the rounds are easy and picking the right choice will win you some money. At some point Sonya needs her wallet. She dropped it over by the restrooms. There is a big green restroom sign so you can't miss it but from where you are, if you turn around it will be a bit forward and to the left. Her wallet is on the ground in front of the restrooms. Bring it back and play some more, then she will send you to get drinks. The food tent is on the side of the party directly opposite you, so head over there and talk to the person selling food and drinks. You will automatically get a drink for Sonya. You can choose to buy your own food and drink if you want. Head back to Sonya, but she's gone. Talk to the cup guy a bit, and then head back outside to Sonya's limo. Talk to her driver to finish up the scene. Before choosing your exit, you can use the phone booth for those 2 phone booth achievements.\n\nCruisin\n\nYou are in Sonya's limo. There is drink nearby, then talk to Sonya. Look at the Remote and choose a button. Then look out of the sunroof, and come back down. After more conversation look at the papers to your right, and talk some more. Her show comes on, so you can move over to where she is to watch. While it's on, look to your left, and move the pillow to find a tape (TAPE 9) underneath. After the show is done, use the remote to talk to Adam, then continue talking with Sonya until the scene completes.\n\nEnjoy the Silence\n\nYou are in a taxi with Jarod. You can try to talk, and then knock on the partition. You will talk a little, and then look to your right and rest. Look to your left at the items on the seat. Then look specifically at the notebook. You can lean forward and interact with some items in the front (like the radio and pictures on the dashboard - there is a cassette tape on the front passenger seat, but you can't take it yet) his cold anger will increase and then he will finally tell you that's enough. You exit from leaning forward and then eventually he stops the car and gets out and a timer appears. Now is your chance to lean forward and steal the cassette tape (TAPE 10). Then choose \"unlock door\" near the radio and choose the flee by your door. This will unlock cleverness ability.\n\nGoldfinger\n\nThere is a cassette tape on the floor in front of you (TAPE 11). There is a drink in the backseat. Talk to Alex and play the game he is working on (while you are driving apparently). It's a tank combat game. After each round of playing the game he will ask your opinion on what to change. The cool part is that the game is updated with the mechanic you choose, so iterate a few times, and he'll ask if it's done, if you are happy with the state of the game, say yes to move on. He will give you some money for helping. Continue talking to him and at some point you will have to look at a picture. A little more dialog will end the scene, you only have one exit choice.\n\nHard Knock Life\n\nFiller scene, no story character involved. You are the passenger in a car. You can look around to see if there is anything to grab, but I didn't see anything. Just wait and then choose \"Wait to be dropped off\".\n\nI'm gonna be (500 miles)\n\nFiller scene, no story character involved. You are the passenger in a car. You can look around to see if there is anything to grab, but I didn't see anything. Just wait and then choose \"Wait to be dropped off\".\n\nI've seen that face before\n\nYou are outside of a hotel. Sonya's limo is parked out front. To the right of the building is a cardboard tent where you can rest if needed. Head towards the front door of the hotel. Just before entering to the right is a vending machine. There is food back here and a chance for some money in the vending machine. Head into the lobby. If you have enough money, there is a display of cassette tapes where you can buy a cassette tape (TAPE 12). If you don't have money yet, you will have another chance towards the end of the scene where you should have enough money. There is also a phone booth in the lobby if you need it for the phone achievements. Now talk to the clerk a bit, and then grab champagne. You will get an employee access card as well. Use it to open a nearby door. Inside is a locker you can pick the lock on if you have lock picking ability, inside that is car keys. There is another locker that has a cassette tape (TAPE 13). Exit the room, head down the hall and call the elevator. Get in the elevator and choose to go up. You will see Sonya's driver come out of a room, head in there to see Sonya, then head to the table behind her and put down the champagne. Talk to her, and then use the video camera by the window. In this view you can zoom in and out. Look ahead and choose a response to Sonya and then look down and wait for Adam to appear and zoom in and take his picture. There is more conversation and then eventually more people arrive. Just continue the dialogue, taking pictures when the option appears. Eventually you will have to make a decision and you will be back in the room with Sonya. A little more talking and then you will be in the hallway. Call the elevator and go back downstairs. You will have to talk to the clerk who gives you some money for helping out. If you didn't have enough money to buy a tape, you do now, so make sure you do so. Choose your exit method.\n\nInfinity\n\nRun ( ) all the way ahead to where Fanny is fixing a flat by a tree. You can either walk up directly to her and start talking, or walk around the other end of the car past her. Either way you wind up in the backseat of her patrol car. Down on the floor there will be a tape, so grab it (TAPE 14). Now you can look to the left and talk to Fanny some more. You will then get out of the car and help fix the flat tire. The only tricky part here is inflating the tire. You will need to pump the air until the gauge is well into the green, and then you put in the stopper before the gauge leaves the green. After that, talk some more, follow her under the tree to continue the conversation and then choose your exit.\n\nLet's Get Serious\n\nYou are walking up to a roadside bar. Head to the back of the building. If you have lock picking ability, you can enter this room now, otherwise come back here later with a key. Inside there is a locker with a car key. Head to the other side of the building, there will be a guy standing guard outside a door, talk to him, and he lets you in. Go inside, talk, and play air hockey. Win or lose you will talk more and then be given a drink, but not the kind that gives you energy. There will be more talking and then you will be in a side office room of the bar. Eat the food in here, take some money, open a drawer to find a door key you can use later for the back room noted at the beginning of this scene. Move book on bookshelf to reveal stairs, and head down and straight ahead. Talk more, go into another room, talk more, and make a choice. Once you are back in the bar, head to the bathroom, it's down the hall past the bar to the last door. Open the door, head inside and then open and go into the middle stall. Look to your left to find a backpack you can search and find a tape (TAPE 15). Head back outside. You can try the back room again with the door key if you didn't get in there before, and then choose your exit.\n\nLFO\n\nYou are on a bus, there is food on the seat on the right next to you. On the Left is a pillow. Behind you is Alex, and there is a tape on the seat next to him. You can't take it yet. Start talking to Alex, and then you will be prompted to Rest using the pillow. Talk with Alex some more, and then you will move to sit next to him. He asks you to help get his scanner working. There will be a series of small puzzles you need to do in order to get it working. They are pretty straightforward to solve, but here are the strategies if needed:\n\nBatteries - you will need to orient them correctly in the compartment. the + side shows on the battery, so the other side is the - side. Align the - side with the springs.\n\nSet of 5 switches - these will need to be done in a certain order to get all 5 to light up. For me it was Top Left, bottom left, bottom right, middle left, top right.\n\nDials with numbers - the dials need to be turned to numbers such that the sum of all of the numbers adds up to 8 - so one dial should be 3, another should be 4 and the last should be 1\n\nKnobs on top - there are 2 sets of lights along the top. Turning each dial illuminates a row of lights. you need to turn each knob so that each set of lights is all white\n\nOnce you are all done and the scanner is working, there is more dialogue with Alex and he will give you the tape we saw on the seat next to him (TAPE 16). You'll have a choice of how you want to move on to the next scene.\n\nMore than Words\n\nA slightly more elaborate filler scene. There is no story character here. Head straight through the tunnel, and then near a stopped car head right. Open the door, go through the hallway, open another door.. There will be a table on the left with some food, and pictures on the wall right next to it. Look at the pictures, and then take the picture. To the right there is a staircase with an overturned desk underneath it. Open the desk drawer, look at and then take the picture from there. Open the other desk drawer for a cassette tape (TAPE 17). Now go up the stairs. At the top there will be a picture on the floor you can look at and take. To the left of the bed there is a nightstand with a notebook on it. Look inside and put the 3 pictures in it. The order isn't important. Once all three pictures are in it, a \"Last page\" option appears, choose that, and then look at the page, which will unlock the door right next to the table and you will take the book. Go outside and follow the path up the hill. In the distance you will see a tree with a couple under it, head towards that tree. Under the tree, dig and take what you find and put it in the notebook. You can now choose your exit.\n\nNobody's Supposed to Be Here\n\nAt the outset you are on the side of a road. The path ahead is your only option, so walk forward a bit. The path will open up to a clearing with a fenced area to the left and a shell of an old house straight ahead. If you have lock picking, you can go over to the fenced area and pick the lock to get some food in a cardboard box there. Otherwise head into the first floor of the building. There is a desk in one of the rooms with some money on it. Head upstairs using the stairs on the right side of the building. There will be a drink on a table up here. Walk through the second floor over beams until you get to a room where you can see Mitch and Stan below you. Walk on the beam directly over them, and you will fall into the room with them. Talk to them a bit. They are trying to figure out a date of something, and they want you to help. There are clues all over the desk area they have set up. You can choose to look through all of them to figure out the date and enter it, or you can just give up and tell them you can't figure it out. Either way they will let you leave. You need to select Climb by a ladder on the wall, and then walk down the path here. Before completely exiting there is a cardboard tent you can use to rest, and there is a phone booth, so if you haven't gotten the 2 achievements related to phone calls you can get them here. Then choose your exit.\n\nNothings gonna stop us now\n\nYou are in the sidecar of Mitch and Stan's motorcycle. Look behind you, there is some money you can grab. Look up and talk to them. At some point you will have to look at the bag to continue things, and then have to look at something on the floor of the sidecar. Eventually some police will start chasing. This will turn into a game where you have to throw money at the police car, first to damage, and then to corrupt. When the reticle is red, throw the money. You might be able to get them to stop chasing you, or it might end with them pulling you over. If you do get pulled over, there is a chance you will get arrested and this episode ends, so be careful. If you have the government pass ability, you can use that to finish the scene up successfully. There are also bribery options depending on how much money you have. If you have neither, or choose not to bribe, the scene will end with your arrest, otherwise they will let you go.\n\nPolice Academy\n\nTake the tape from just below the radio. (TAPE 18) Get papers from Glovebox. Then look ahead and choose Drive fast. Fanny will arrive, show her the papers and talk to her. She will get in your car and you will have a mini game of swerving through traffic. Just use right/left when appropriate to avoid cars. You may get some damage, but shouldn't be too hard to make it to the destination. After the driving game, more talking in the car, there will be a drink in the backseat. When Fanny leaves your car, she leaves behind the government pass ability, make sure you grab it. Then drive to the next location.\n\nPraying for Time\n\nAt the start, there is food in the glovebox, a drink and some money in the back seat, and then you can eject a tape from the radio (TAPE 19). You are alone in a car, you will need to Look outside to your left. Turn on the Radio, and then Keep Driving. Eventually you will come across Jarod standing in the road, and he will get into your car. Talk to him a bit, and then you will have to unlock your doors a few times before an option appears over the steering wheel to drop him off. You'll talk to him some more, and then start driving again. At some point in the conversation, an anger bar will appear, so choose dialogue choices that won't get him angry. Eventually he will say you are clever, and you will unlock the cleverness ability. Choose how you'd like to move on to the next scene.\n\nRight here, Right now\n\nThis is a filler scene, but with a title. There is no story here, there may be money on the glovebox. Interact with other options until an exit choice appears.\n\nRoll with it\n\nYou will be near a roadside bar. To the right is a teen selling food and tapes (TAPE 20). Walk around behind the building, there is a cardboard tent you can rest in. At the far end of the parking lot is a phone booth you can use for the phone related achievements. Go into the bar. Before interacting with anyone, head to the left and then towards the back. There is a small office that you can get into if you have lock picking ability. Inside is a locker with another lock to pick that has car keys. In the desk is an ATM card. Head back outside. On the front left side of the building is an ATM machine that you can use the card with to get some money. Head back inside and talk to the bartender and you will wind up serving drinks. There is no time limit and score to this game, and you can mess up, so no pressure. The patrons will ask for a specific drink. You can look for it on the shelves behind you or in the bar below you. For example the woman with a green shirt might ask for Homeland Hops. Find it on the shelf, select it, and then choose Serve in front of that customer. If you get it right, you will get a small tip. While doing this, go over to the cash register, there will be a cassette tape you can steal (TAPE 21). At some point Jarod will arrive and ask for his drink. His drink will be different than the others, it's a combination of 3 drinks. The recipe is on the wall to your left. It will be obvious from the name which one is his. It will list the 3 ingredients in order. You will need to collect the first ingredient, come back here and put it in the shaker nearby. Do it for all three ingredients, and then serve it to him. I've done it correctly, and I also have randomly selected ingredients in the drink, it didn't affect the outcome of the scene. Talk to Jarod, and then the owner will have food for you, eat that, and he will let you leave. Head outside and choose your exit.\n\nShort Circuit\n\nYou will be outside an abandoned gas station. There is a phone booth in front, but it's not usable yet. Head behind the gas station. Way in the back is a cardboard tent rest area if you need it. Go into the gas station using the open back door and talk to Alex. After a bit, grab the nail gun nearby and use it to shoot ceiling tiles to get them to drop revealing the electrical wires. You need to trace the wire to find where it goes, so keep shooting ceiling tiles. Eventually you will get a dialog option, if you don't then make sure you've uncovered enough ceiling tiles to trace the line. Follow Alex outside, keep following the wire, choosing dialog options to move things along. Shoot the lock on a shed and open the door, and walk in. Against the far wall is another puzzle to get a key. Try to grab a key and it won't work. Alex will give you a magnet to use instead. Now you need to guide the key through an electrified path to get it to a place where you can grab it. If the key touches electrified parts you get a shock and have to start over, so go slow around the path. There are blue pegs that the key can touch, which helps you get around some corners. Get the key all the way to the other end of the path, and you can grab it. Use it to start the generator behind you. Follow Alex back out of the shed, and there will be people outside of the station so he will prompt you to hide. After a small scene, there will be a button in front of you to press. You will do it twice at an appropriate time that will be pretty obvious. After a short cutscene it will be morning, and everyone is gone. Walk out to the front of the station. The phone booth is now usable for the achievements if you haven't done them yet, otherwise there is nothing more to find here, so choose your exit method.\n\nSome Like it Hot\n\nYou will be outside a fast food location. There is a teen on the right side of the building selling tapes and food. Be sure to buy a tape (TAPE 22). Head around to the back of the building. There is a door to a back room here you can open and go in. I found another tape in the desk drawer here (TAPE 23). There is also some food on the shelf. Lastly if you have lock picking there is one locked drawer you can pick the lock on, and get car keys. Now head into the restaurant, and speak to the employee behind the counter. You will get more food, either for free or paying for it, your choice. Eat the food and talk with the employee further, and then Mitch and Stan will show up. Talk through the situation with them, choose whatever you want from the choices presented to you. A countdown timer will appear. You can either wait it out doing nothing, or walk around and interact with the other customers. Either way when the timer ends you will have to talk to Mitch and Stan a little more. They will give you some money, and leave. There is a cardboard rest tent nearby if you need to increase your energy, or just choose an exit to proceed to the next scene.\n\nSomething in the way\n\nYou'll be in a police car with another teen - talk to them to get a cassette tape (TAPE 24). After that, talk to Fanny. After a bit there will be an event. You need to crawl. There is money nearby, and then crawl again. Your choice as to how to proceed to the next scene.\n\nStress\n\nYou find yourself on a bus. Fanny has a teen in custody, and you are sitting behind them. At the start look on the seat to your right, there will be a walkman with a tape in it. Open and steal it (TAPE 25). Now you can start the conversation with Fanny. You will have to speak to the Teen as well, and then Fanny again. At this point a Tension meter will appear. You will want to choose dialog options to escalate the tension instead of keeping things calm. It will come to a head where Fanny will have to decide what she is going to do. No matter what she decides, you will need to choose if you want to disembark and walk or ride a little more.\n\nSuspicious Minds\n\nYou are outside a motel. There is a phone booth to the left. If you have enough money you can get the 2 phone related achievements here. Head into the motel reception and talk to the clerk, Fanny will come in, you will have to talk to her. You are now in her motel room, continue talking to her and then when she moves out of the way, take the mugshots from the wall. You are now tasked with doing basically a Guess Who game. You will talk to occupants of the hotel, they will give you description of who they saw and you then can use that to cross off faces from the mugshots. You can either be accurate or not, it's your choice. Note that vacant rooms have a \"vacant\" tag on the door, no need to knock on those. Also you don't need to talk to everyone, just enough to either have 1 face left or no faces left on the mugshot card. Once you reach that point head back to Fanny's room. The motel clerk will interrupt you briefly for a quick conversation and then you can head into Fanny's room. More conversation and then she gives you money for helping out. Once done you'll be back in the parking lot. One more chance to do the phone achievements if you haven't already, then choose your exit.\n\nSweet Dreams\n\nYou arrive near a gas station, you can talk to a teen nearby and/or continue to the gas station. To the right back is a shed, head in there to find a locker that you can pick the lock on if you have lock picking ability. Inside is an ATM Card and car keys. Nearby is a cardboard tent to rest if needed. Head into the gas station itself, there is an ATM here to use the card you just got from the locker for some money. There is also a phone booth in here that you can use for the 2 achievements. Now walk over to the gas station owner outside and work for him, \"Start Shift\". This will be a short mini game of you serving gas. A car will drive up and ask for a dollar amount or quantity of a specific kind of gas. You need to choose the gas from the pump, put the pump in the car, turn around and hold to fill the gas watching the pump to make sure you get close to what they wanted. If you are good enough you get a small tip. But you can also get it completely wrong without anything bad happening. After a few cars, Fanny will show up for some gas. Talk to her and then fill up her patrol car with what she wants. More cops will arrive, with more talking and a short scene. You will wind up with Fanny. Talk some more and then choose an exit.\n\nTake Your Time (Do It Right)\n\nIn Jarod scenes, your dialog choices could result in death, so you will want to be careful how you respond. I try to keep the details sparse as not to spoil the story, but the path below will not result in your death.\n\nYou find yourself walking along a road at night. Walk forward, and a taxi will drive past and stop up ahead. Keep walking towards it. There will be a camper van on your right as you get closer to the taxi. You can look inside for money and food. Keep walking and attempt to walk past the taxi and Jarod will appear and stop you. Talk to him. At one point he wants a light. You can return to the camper and find matches. Grab them and bring them back and give them to him. He is then going to become more aggressive and will want you to get something but not tell you where it is, just tell you if you are getting close to it. The item he wants is in the trunk of the taxi, so walk over there and open it. There is a VCR in the trunk with an option to look at it - don't. Take out the gas can instead. He will want you to take it over to the camper, so just follow his instructions. This will become a life and death situation. I chose to ask about his daughter instead of other choices, and it resulted in him allowing me to leave. Walk/Run past the taxi and options to leave will appear.\n\nTeenage Dirtbag\n\nAlex is driving and you are the passenger. If you look around you will find money and a cassette tape (TAPE 26) on the floor. Talk to Alex, Look at the scanner on the floor. To get it to work, use the dials to get both rows of lights to light up white. Continue talking then move to the backseat. You will be next to a small TV and 3 antennas. You need to tweak the antennas to get a clear picture. I found it easiest to go in reverse order. Tweak the third/bottom antenna (move it left or right until the picture gets a little better), then do the same with the second/middle one, and finish up with the first/top antenna. You should have a clear picture and a dialog choice. This will repeat 2 more times. Keep talking to Alex and then finish up the scene.\n\nThe Passenger\n\nYou are the driver and John is your passenger. There is money in the backseat. His truck is broken down and he needs to get to a phone. You can view a map and plot out your path to the phone. You are the red diamond on the map. You can choose a direction to go, which takes you to an intersection on the road. You can make up to 3 directional choices at once on the map, choose reset to start the path planning over again, or validate to be on your way. There are only 2 phone booth locations on the map. Each time I played this scene, the phone booth that worked was always the second one I went to, so feel free to navigate to them in whichever order you want. Once you are on your way there is just some talking with John. When you arrive at the first phone booth, there will be a short scene, and you will have to map a path to the other phone booth. Once he is able to make a call, you'll automatically head back to his truck for more conversation and he will give you some money for helping.\n\nThe Pursuit of Happiness\n\nAt the start look down, open the glovebox, look behind. In my game, I only found something to drink on the floor. You will talk to John, then need to look outside for a bit, and then talk to him some more. After a while you will need to help handle some distractions on the road, you will be placed in the back of the truck. There are other things to look at if you want, but no money or food or tapes. To continue the scene grab the nail gun sitting on a crate. Shoot the padlock keeping the back doors closed to have them swing open, and you will see a car approaching. Start shooting the car with the nail gun, depleting it's health bar that appears. The targeting reticle should be red when you shoot the nails. After a while it will move to the side. You can open a side door and continue shooting at the car. I was a terrible shot, and still managed to defeat the car, so I think the game is pretty generous in having you handle this situation. You will return to the passenger seat to continue your conversation with him finally dropping you off somewhere.\n\nThe Wild Boys\n\nThis is a scene in a vehicle with Mitch and Stan. Something to eat near the radio. The main event will require you to talk to them, step on the gas, turn on the radio, and then take their quiz. Win or lose the quiz doesn't matter. You will still be able to leave.\n\nThieves in the Temple\n\nYou are outside the taxi headquarters. Mitch and Stan are outside. There's not much to do yet, so talk to them. During this initial conversation they will give you the lock picking ability. Then at some point they will need to boost you up to a vent, just walk over to the one closest and you'll get automatically boosted up. Pick the lock to get through the vent into the back security room of the taxi HQ. Look around for a moment, there are some things you can do before the main reason you are in here. There is another door here you can open. If you have the hacking ability, there is a safe here you can hack, it has money and a cassette tape (TAPE 27). Back in the main security room, there is a scratcher card on the floor for a chance to win some money, and there is food on the desk. Finally you can sit at the desk with all of the TVs. Talk to Mitch and Stan with the walkie talkie. They will ask where they are. Each TV is numbered. If you look to the left there is a map on the wall showing which rooms each camera is in, so you can tell them where they are. An Alarm will go off, and they need you to disable it. There is a pad of buttons to the right, just press them until it turns off the alarm. I think it's always the last one you press. The phone will ring, and you'll need to explain what's happening in a way to not arouse suspicion. The person on the phone will want a passphrase. Mitch and Stan find it, so you can answer - it's a bit complicated and all of the options are similar, so it's possible you will get it wrong, but it won't affect any outcome. The phone call will end, and Mitch and Stan need another code. Open the desk drawers to the left and right of you to select from a bunch of codes. One will work. Now a security guard will show up and knock on the door to your room. You will have to make a choice, and then a countdown timer will appear for you to exit the room. Before you do, open the drawer to the left to get a car key. Take the chair and use it to get out via the vent you came in from. I managed to get out with lots of time to spare. Choose your way to the next scene.\n\nToo Young to Die\n\nYou are at a rest stop. You will see John talking on the phone in the phone booth. Head around to the back of the store and there will be a door you can pick the lock on, if you have that skill. Inside there is a desk. There is money on top of the desk. Open both drawers to find car keys and a cassette tape (TAPE 28). If you can hack, there is a safe here as well with some money. Head back to John and choose \"Listen\". After a cutscene he will be at the picnic table. You can use the phone booth now for those 2 achievements if needed. He will call you over, talk with him and \"Sit\". You can eat and drink as well. There will be another cutscene and you will be in his truck. There is more conversation, and then you will have to look at the 2 photos to keep it going. Then he will ask you to use the CB Radio. Use it and have a conversation, which will end with you having a choice of exit.\n\nVideo Killed the Radio Star\n\nYou find yourself on the side of the road, walk forward. Hug the rocks on the right and head towards an abandoned car. You may be able to open the door and eject a tape from the radio (TAPE 29). Continue along the path until you approach a white limo and meet Sonya. Talk to her. She wants you to help her film a news report, so you will need to walk over to the video camera and use it. She will continue to tell you what to do, but essentially the focus square in the camera will be green when it's what she wants, and red when it's not. You can do whatever you want. If it's green she'll be nicer to you, if it's red she won't. At some point you will have to turn to film the event going on here. Again she will give you directions and you can choose to ignore or follow them. It will impact the overall story, but that's it. Once the event is complete, she will give you some feedback and then leave. You will have a few choices on how you want to leave - but notice that one of them is a phone booth to call a taxi, so you have another opportunity for these 2 phone achievements.\n\nWalk the Dinosaur\n\nIn Jarod scenes, your dialog choices could result in death, so you will want to be careful how you respond. I try to keep the details sparse as not to spoil the story, but the path below will not result in your death.\n\nYou are a passenger in Jarod's taxi. There is money on the top of the seat behind you. Knock on the partition, and read one of the magazines. Talk to him. At some point in the conversation his anger bar will appear, continue to talk to him, but don't get him so angry his bar fills up. At some point he will ask you to Lean forward, go ahead and do so. Talk to him a bit more, and then rest on the pillow in the back seat. When you wake up, the cab is stopped and he is fixing the engine. Lean Forward and look at the video tapes on the floor. There is a video player here as well. Avoid interacting with the video player. If you do, and you look at the tapes, it will lead down a path where you die. So just look at the tapes, but don't interact with the player. He will return to the car and the scene will finish up.\n\nWalking in my Shoes\n\nHead forward towards a phone booth, you find Alex on the phone. Talk to him. He will give you his detector to find something. The detector makes a sound when you get close, and then the screen changes to an Exclamation point when you find something. Looking at the ground nearby you can choose Dig. You need to find the telephone box key to continue the story, but there is also a cassette tape buried around here as well (TAPE 30), so be sure to find both. On a pole nearby is the telephone box. You can now open with your key. Note it may be possible to skip getting the key if you have lock picking ability, but in my play throughs this scene happened before I got the lock picking ability. Once the box is open, push the button inside. Go back and talk to Alex. Eventually he needs you to press the button in the box again, so do so, and then head back to talk to him some more. Afterwards you can grab food from his backpack near the phone booth, and choose how you want to leave.\n\nWorlds Apart\n\nYou will be driving a car. Open the glovebox to find some money, and then look in the backseat area for a cassette tape (TAPE 31). Interact with the radio, and tune it a bit and you will get Sonya's radio show. You will happen upon Sonya on the road, her limo broke down. Talk to her and she will get in your car. She sits in the back, continue talking with her (the dialog choices appear by the rear view mirror. She finds some food in the back and puts it on the front seat. Keep talking, and then eventually she wants music on. So interact with the radio and tune to a station she likes. You will have to do this twice, and then more talking ending with you dropping her near a phone. There is only one exit choice.\n\nYou're the Inspiration\n\nThere will be food nearby, then talk to Sonya. Put on some music. This will start a trippy light show game. You aim at circles and use to clear them. There are quite a few, and there is no scoring, so get some, miss some, it doesn't matter, this will take a few minutes to complete. You will be back in the limo. If you look down at the floor now, there is a cassette tape amongst the magazines. (TAPE 32). Talk to Sonya and eventually you will have to choose an exit\n\nFind anything you think is wrong with this walkthrough?
