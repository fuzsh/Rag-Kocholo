        "text": "The American Dream has fallen on hard times.\n\nJust 53% of respondents to a 2024 Pew Research Center poll said that they could still achieve the American Dream, while another 41% said it was once attainable. Alas, another 6% thought it never really existed at all.\n\nThe most pessimistic Americans are those under 50; less than 40% of those between 18 and 29 say the American dream today is still attainable, and the number is barely better for middle-aged adults.\n\n“Younger Americans are substantially less likely than older Americans to say it’s still possible to achieve the American Dream,” says Gabe Borelli, a Pew research associate.\n\nA look at the data reinforces this complicated picture. The American Dream still lives, but it has health problems.\n\nWhat Is The American Dream?\n\nThe term originates from the 1931 bestseller The Epic of America by author James Truslow Adams, in which he defines the term as “a dream of a better, richer and happier life for all our citizens of every rank.”\n\nBy dint of hard work and ingenuity, achieving the American Dream means you can enjoy a decent life of at least modest prosperity and security. In practical terms, that means a comfortable house, car and growing family.\n\nDecades of robust economic growth led to individual prosperity and affordable houses (especially for first-time buyers), thereby bolstering the reality of the American Dream.\n\nAcademics today, though, argue whether the dream is still possible.\n\nPessimists point to the inability of some recent adults to surpass their parents’ standard of living, and that it’s harder to support a family now than in the recent past. There’s a reason, after all, that young Americans (who tend to make less money) were the most down on the American Dream in the Pew survey.\n\nOptimists, on the other hand, say Americans today are actually doing better than before, especially when you consider tax burdens and government support. Moreover, millions of non-Americans flock to the country every year in hopes of a better life.\n\n“As a general notion, I think America is still a land of opportunity,” says Dr. Michael Strain, the director of economic policy studies at right-leaning think tank American Enterprise Institute. “It’s a magnet for people from around the world.”\n\nWhat Is the Price of the American Dream?\n\nTo answer the question, we looked at how expensive the American Dream is for a family of four and how that cost has changed over the past 30 years.\n\nWe also delivered our verdict (alive or dead) on the health of a particular category. Basically, if a cost has gotten cheaper relative to income over time, then we deemed it alive. If not, it’s dead.\n\nUltimately, our gauge found that two pillars of the American Dream (income and cost of living) were alive, two (homes and cars) were dead and one (college) was hanging on for life.\n\nThis middling score dovetails with how Americans, as polled by Pew, feel about its vitality.\n\nIncome\n\nOur American family is making more money now than 30 years ago.\n\nThe typical family of four earned a little more than $113,000 in 2022, according to the latest data from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey. A similarly sized family earned nearly $41,450 in 1990.\n\nOnce you adjust for inflation, the 1990 family earned $91,500 in 2022 dollars, signaling that this decade’s typical American family is making progress.\n\nThe overall job market also seems healthier. The unemployment rate is 4.1% now compared to 5.4% at the start of 1990, for instance, while weekly initial jobless claims are down by about 123,000.\n\nVerdict: The American Dream is alive\n\nBuying A Home\n\nWhat matters to families, though, isn’t necessarily how much they’re earning, but how far those dollars go. Especially when it comes to one of the pillars of the American Dream: homes.\n\nThe median sales price in the second quarter of 2024 was roughly $412,000, compared to about $127,000 in 1990.\n\nThat means that the average home cost about 3.05x more than the average income for a family of four in 1990, compared to 3.64x now.\n\nSo home prices have gotten much pricer relative to family earnings.\n\nTo be fair, they’ve also gotten bigger. Borrowing costs have also come down considerably, with interest rates dropping from almost 10% in 1990 to under 7% now. (Of course, mortgage rates were significantly cheaper prior to the pandemic.)\n\nNevertheless, the average family today will have a harder time affording the pinnacle totem of the American dream.\n\nVerdict: The American Dream is dead\n\nCollege\n\nAmericans have prioritized making sure their kids go to college.\n\nThe percentage of Americans aged 25 or older who have a college degree today (38%) is nearly double that of 1990 (20%), according to the Census.\n\nInterestingly, the cost of college attendance hasn’t really budged for many students.\n\nThe average tuition and fees for a year of college at a four-year public institution was $4,500 for in-state students in 1990, or about 11% of our average family income. In 2024, the typical family would have to shell out a similar share of its income (or about $11,000).\n\nThe picture darkens when you consider private colleges, though, which comprised 29% of the typical family income in 1990 compared to 37% now.\n\nThe consequence of more people going to college, even if the price hasn’t risen dramatically, is complicated.\n\nCollege graduates have higher career earnings, but also take on more debt. Nevertheless, with costs staying roughly constant (at least for in-state tuition) and more folks earning a degree, the outlook is generally okay.\n\nVerdict: The American Dream is alive-ish\n\nBuying a Car\n\nIt’s become more expensive to buy a car over the past 30 years, which may be why our typical family has fewer of them (2.7 in 1990 compared to 2.4 now, per the BLS).\n\nThe average price of a new car in 2024 is $47,401, or 42% of our typical family’s annual pay, up from 36% in 1990.\n\nUsed cars suffer from the same fate; they used to take up 16% of annual pay ($6,830) but now occupy 23% ($25,571).\n\nThis cost is magnified by the increasing length of car loans, which only add to a family’s debt burden.\n\nTo be sure vehicles are more fuel efficient, technologically advanced and (in some cases) more durable than before.\n\nBut the point of the exercise is to put ourselves in the shoes of a typical family deciding to buy a car at any given time.\n\nVerdict: The American Dream is dead\n\nLiving Expenses\n\nWhat about normal, day-to-day stuff, like going to the grocery store and buying clothes? Isn’t that getting more expensive, too?\n\nActually, not really.\n\nIf you compare the Consumer Expenditure Survey for a family of four from 1990 and 2022 (the most recent report), you’ll find that folks are pretty much paying the same, if not a little bit less, for the basics.\n\nIn 1990, for instance, the typical family spent a little more than $30,000 annually (or 73% of their income) on food, housing, clothes, transportation, health care and entertainment. That same family in 2022 spent 70% of their pay (or nearly $80,000).\n\nThe costs of housing (ranging from mortgage payments to housekeeping supplies), transportation and entertainment basically kept pace with income growth. Food prices, by that measure, are slightly cheaper and clothes are much cheaper than in 1990, while health care costs have skyrocketed.\n\nStill, Americans are paying less overall.\n\nVerdict: The American Dream is alive\n\nIs The American Dream Alive?\n\nWhile a family of four is making more money (even after adjusting for inflation) over the past 30 years, many aspects of the American Dream have gotten harder to afford, with the biggest culprit being a house.\n\nThis has been acutely salient in recent years, following major price increases in the aftermath of the pandemic and the dramatic jump in borrowing costs imposed by the Fed to stymie inflation. In fact, home prices have been unaffordable for more than three years, according to the Atlanta Fed’s Home Ownership Affordable Monitor.\n\nStill, just because homes are expensive now doesn’t mean the American Dream is dead, especially when other costs have stayed constant, or even become more affordable—but it may be on life support."
