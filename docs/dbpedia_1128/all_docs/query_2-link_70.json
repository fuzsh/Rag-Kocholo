        "text": "Breathless in the Midwest\n\nNumber Sick: 15\n\nHospitalizations: 15\n\nDeaths: 7\n\nLocation: US\n\nYour Mission:\n\nA startling outbreak has been reported in Chicago and Milwaukee. Within the past 2 days, 15 people have visited emergency rooms complaining of high fever, fatigue, coughing, chest pain, and difficulty breathing. Several people have died, and others are near death!\n\nYour help is needed to put an end to this outbreak!\n\nClue 1\n\nThe first reported case is a 37-year-old musician from Chicago named Zeke. You start by talking to Zeke to find out what he was doing before he got sick.\n\nZeke said that he started coughing and feeling very tired shortly after he led a music workshop for 50 students at a Chicago concert hall. He thought he might have picked something up from one of the students in the class, or perhaps he caught it 2 days ago on a flight home from vacation in Africa.\n\nTip\n\nYou decide to ask Zeke more about his trip to Africa.\n\nYou learn that Zeke and several of his friends took a trip to Mali last week. While they were there, Zeke took a side trip to meet a drum maker who taught him how to make djembes (African drums made of animal skins and wood). Zeke brought home 4 of the djembes he helped make.\n\nZeke and his friends returned home on the same 20-hour flight. After talking with Zeke's friends, you learn that he is the only one with a high fever, fatigue, cough, chest pain, and difficulty breathing.\n\n1. Where do you think Zeke caught whatever made him sick?\n\nAnswer 1: The flight home from Mali\n\n[Incorrect]\n\nWhile sitting near other people for many hours on a flight can lead to sharing each other's germs, it's still too early to know exactly what's caused the outbreak.\n\nKeep investigating to find out!\n\nAnswer 2: The music workshop\n\n[Incorrect]\n\nIt's too early to know for sure, but Zeke remembered coughing and feeling very tired immediately after the class. Most colds, flus, and other viral infections take at least 1 day before symptoms are easily noticed.\n\nKeep investigating to find out!\n\nAnswer 3: It's too soon to know for sure\n\n[Correct]\n\nYou're right, it's too soon to tell when or how he caught his illness. We don't even know what disease we're dealing with yet.\n\nYou'll need to find out what Zeke has before you can determine what made him sick.\n\nKeep investigating to find out!\n\nClue 2\n\nMore cases of the mysterious illness are being reported in Chicago and Milwaukee hospitals. Patients' loved ones are in a panic and are hoping you can help find out what's made everyone so sick.\n\nLab results show patients are infected with a bacterium that doctors suspect might be anthrax. You immediately send the samples to public health laboratories for testing, but that will take a couple of days.\n\nIn the meantime, you need to talk with everyone who is sick - and their families - to find out which activities they participated in before becoming sick. When you look at the responses to your questions, it seems that many of the sick people participated in the same activities recently - like working in a government building or attending a music event.\n\nData\n\nYou already have gotten information directly from sick patients or family members of those who died. You interview 85 people who are not sick, but participated in similar activities as those who are sick or died. In outbreak investigations we call these people the \"population at risk of getting sick.\"\n\nEach person was asked what they did in the 2 weeks before getting sick. The \"attack rate\" was calculated for each activity.\n\nAttack Rate = the number of people who participated in an activity and are sick the total number of people who participated in an activity\n\nHint: To find a possible source of the outbreak, look for both a high attack rate for those who participated in an activity and a low attack rate among those who did not participate.\n\nDefinition\n\nAnthrax\n\nAnthrax is a serious disease caused by a type of bacteria known as Bacillus anthracis. Anthrax is not contagious. You cannot catch it from another person, like you can catch the cold or flu.\n\nAnthrax can be found naturally in the soil and can infect domestic and wild animals like cattle, sheep, and goats. The animals become sick when they eat spores (germs) in contaminated soil or vegetation.\n\nPeople can get anthrax by:\n\nHandling products made from infected animals.\n\nBreathing in anthrax spores from animal products.\n\nEating undercooked meat from infected animals.\n\nBeing exposed to anthrax spores by bioterrorists.\n\nAnthrax can get into the body through the skin, lungs, or digestive system.\n\n2. What would you do next?\n\nAnswer 1: Re-check the data to see if there is one activity or exposure that all sick people have in common\n\n[Correct]\n\nYou are correct. Knowing what activity or exposure these people have in common can help you find out where this outbreak may have started.\n\nIt looks like all of the sick people attended a music event in Chicago. You may be on to something! But what about the high number of sick people who work in or near a government building? Is that something to worry about too?\n\nAnswer 2: Interview workers in every government building in Milwaukee and Chicago\n\n[Incorrect]\n\nNo. You've already interviewed well and sick people in the Chicago building where people got sick. Interviewing workers in every government building in these 2 cities would not be as helpful as knowing what activity or exposure these people have in common. Knowing this can help you find out where this outbreak may have started.\n\nIt looks like all of the sick people attended a music event in Chicago. You may be on to something! But what about the high number of sick people who work in or near a government building? Is that something to worry about too?\n\nAnswer 3: Cancel all music events in Chicago\n\n[Incorrect]\n\nNo. Canceling all music events in Chicago is not necessary at this point and may cause a panic. That won't help solve the outbreak.\n\nInstead, take this time to re-check your data and see what the sick people have in common.\n\nIt looks like all of the sick people attended a music event in Chicago. You may be on to something! But what about the high number of sick people who work in or near a government building? Is that something to worry about too?\n\nClue 3\n\nWith the large number of government workers who are sick, you decide to look into it more. Police reports show that there was a bioterrorism threat 3 days before Zeke and the others got sick - a former government employee threatened to mail anthrax to his old office building in downtown Chicago.\n\nYou interview the 2 sick people from Milwaukee to find that neither of them had been in or around any government building in Chicago in the 2 weeks before getting sick.\n\nDefinition\n\nBioterrorism\n\nA bioterrorism attack is a deliberate release of viruses, bacteria, or other germs (agents) used to cause sickness or death in people, animals, or plants. Anthrax can be released quietly and without anyone knowing. Bioterrorists may send packages or envelopes that contain harmful germs, like in 2001, when anthrax was added to a powder and deliberately spread through the mail.\n\nAnthrax is one of the most likely agents to be used in a biological attack. It only takes a small amount of anthrax to infect a large number of people.\n\n3. How do you think the people in Milwaukee got infected with anthrax?\n\nAnswer 1: Anthrax was mailed from Chicago to Milwaukee\n\n[Incorrect]\n\nYou're jumping to conclusions. You haven't even determined that any anthrax was ever actually mailed to the building.\n\nAll clues are pointing to something else. Keep searching!\n\nAnswer 2: The sick people in Milwaukee visited the government building in Chicago\n\n[Incorrect]\n\nNo. You interviewed the 2 sick people from Milwaukee and found out they had not been in or near any government buildings in Chicago for the 2 weeks before getting sick. Besides, you haven't determined that anthrax was ever actually mailed to the building in the first place.\n\nOther clues are pointing to something else. But, what could it be?\n\nAnswer 3: More evidence is needed before we can determine if the bioterrorism threat is real\n\n[Correct]\n\nThat's correct. We need more evidence and lab tests before we can determine if this bioterrorism threat is real or a hoax. There are sick people 100 miles away near Milwaukee, Wisconsin. And remember, these sick people told you they had not been in or near the government buildings in Chicago.\n\nOther clues are pointing to something else. But, what could it be?\n\nClue 4\n\nAfter intense questioning, testing at government buildings, and lab tests, authorities find no evidence of anthrax. The bioterror threat was a hoax.\n\nMeanwhile, the results of the blood tests you sent to the public health labs indicate a need for further testing, so you send them away to special labs at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The results from CDC labs show Bacillus anthracis, the bacteria that causes anthrax!\n\nBased on this finding and the patients' symptoms, the doctors diagnose each patient with inhalation anthrax. You tell all the patients to begin treatment immediately. But if it's anthrax after all, does that mean the police missed something?\n\nCases\n\nSince you've ruled out the government building as the place where all of the sick people came in contact with anthrax, you review the attack rates and interviews again. You find that everyone who's tested positive for anthrax also attended a music event at the same Chicago concert hall where Zeke held his music workshop.\n\nHealth Tips\n\nTreatment of anthrax\n\nSomeone with symptoms of anthrax should get medical treatment as quickly as possible to have the best chances for a full recovery. Doctors will use several antibiotics that work best for treating anthrax. They will also consider which antibiotics are best for a patient based on his or her medical history.\n\nPrevention of anthrax\n\nAntibiotics can also be used to prevent anthrax from developing in people who have been exposed but have not yet developed symptoms. Anthrax spores in a person's body typically take 1 to 6 days to be \"activated\" - to start releasing their toxins - but some spores can take more than a month before they do so. That's why people who have been exposed to anthrax must take antibiotics for 60 days - to ensure anthrax is no longer in their bodies.\n\nDefinition\n\nInhalation anthrax\n\nIf a person breathes in anthrax, they can get inhalation anthrax. When anthrax germs are inside your body, they start to grow and multiply. This could happen quickly or it could take a long time. After the anthrax starts to grow, it releases toxins - or poisons - that will attack your body and make you sicker and sicker.\n\nEarly symptoms of inhalation anthrax are much like symptoms of the flu - fever/chills, cough, nausea or vomiting. Other symptoms may include:\n\nPassing out\n\nConfusion\n\nDizziness\n\nTrouble breathing\n\nChest pain\n\nHeadache\n\nSweats (often drenching)\n\nExtreme tiredness\n\nFatigue\n\nBody aches\n\n4. What do you think started the outbreak?\n\nAnswer 1: A release of anthrax at the music event\n\n[Correct]\n\nYes, it is very likely that the release of anthrax occurred at the music event. Maybe something or someone at the music event had been contaminated with anthrax.\n\nKeep looking to find out exactly what happened.\n\nAnswer 2: A person at the workshop had contracted anthrax and was still contagious\n\n[Incorrect]\n\nNo. Remember, anthrax can't be passed from one person to another the way cold or flu can be.\n\nIt's more likely that something or someone at the music event had been contaminated with anthrax.\n\nKeep looking to find out exactly what happened!\n\nAnswer 3: Someone in the workshop had received anthrax in the mail\n\n[Incorrect]\n\nRemember, the authorities had already ruled bioterrorism out. There's no evidence that the suspected terrorist ever had access to anthrax.\n\nKeep looking to find out exactly what happened!\n\nClue 5\n\nAll of the people who became sick in this outbreak were together on the day of the workshop. You're now convinced that the workshop is where anthrax was released, though you still aren't sure how.\n\nWhile you try to figure that out, there's something else you need to do. The 35 workshop participants who are healthy must be given antibiotics to prevent them from becoming sick (this is called post-exposure prophylaxis), since they may have been exposed to anthrax.\n\nYou're one step away from finding out what caused the outbreak!\n\nCases\n\nYou talk to Zeke again. He remembers the drum maker in Mali was coughing and having trouble taking deep breaths, similar to the symptoms of all the sick people from the music workshop. You investigate further, contacting health authorities in Mali. They tell you that the drum maker passed away shortly after Zeke returned to Chicago.\n\nZeke also tells you that during the workshop in Chicago, he demonstrated how to make a drum, using goat skins he brought back from Africa.\n\nYou decide to go back to the other participants at the workshop to ask about it. Interestingly, most of the sick people report that while Zeke was showing them how to make the drum, they noticed a large amount of dust and particles floating in the air.\n\nTip\n\nPeople can get anthrax through contact with infected animals or their products, such as hides or hair. In fact, anthrax used to be called \"wool sorters' disease\" and was considered a common risk for workers in wool mills, slaughterhouses, and factories that processed animal hides, hair, and bone.\n\nAnthrax is rare in the United States, but outbreaks do occur in wild and domestic animals. Yearly vaccination of animals is recommended in areas that have had anthrax in the past. The disease is most common in parts of Central and South America, sub-Saharan Africa, central and southwestern Asia, southern and Eastern Europe, and the Caribbean.\n\n5. How do you think the anthrax got into the music workshop?\n\nAnswer 1: Zeke caught the illness from the drum maker, then spread it to others\n\n[Incorrect]\n\nSorry, no. Remember, anthrax can't be passed from one person to another the way cold or flu can be.\n\nYou conduct tests of the drums Zeke played and the goat skins he used to make drums at the workshop. They're contaminated with anthrax spores! When the drums and skins were shown to Zeke's workshop, spores were released into the air. People who came closest to the drums and skins breathed the spores, making them sick.\n\nThe drums and the goat hides he brought back from Mali were not treated effectively with chemicals to kill anthrax spores. Zeke also did not report the goat skins he brought back from Africa to Customs and Border Protection. Because of this, when he returned to the US, it wasn't verified that they had been properly treated to kill anthrax spores.\n\nAnswer 2: Spores were on Zeke's clothes, which he'd worn in Mali\n\n[Incorrect]\n\nNo. If there were spores on Zeke's clothes, it is unlikely that enough would have come off his clothes to get 14 other people sick. But you're close.\n\nYou conduct tests of the drums Zeke played and the goat skins he used to make drums at the workshop. They're contaminated with anthrax spores! When the drums and skins were shown to Zeke's workshop, spores were released into the air. People who came closest to the drums and skins breathed the spores, making them sick.\n\nThe drums and the goat hides he brought back from Mali were not treated effectively with chemicals to kill anthrax spores. Zeke also did not report the goat skins he brought back from Africa to Customs and Border Protection. Because of this, when he returned to the US, it wasn't verified that they had been properly treated to kill anthrax spores.\n\nAnswer 3: Spores were on the drums and goat skins Zeke brought back from Mali\n\n[Correct]\n\nYes! You conduct tests of the drums Zeke played and the goat skins he used to make drums at the workshop. They're contaminated with anthrax spores!\n\nWhen the drums and skins were shown to Zeke's workshop, spores were released into the air. People who came closest to the drums and skins breathed the spores, making them sick.\n\nThe drums and the goat hides he brought back from Mali were not treated effectively with chemicals to kill anthrax spores. Zeke also did not report the goat skins he brought back from Africa to Customs and Border Protection. Because of this, when he returned to the US, it wasn't verified that they had been properly treated to kill anthrax spores.\n\nLearn More\n\nYour hard work helped to solve this outbreak!\n\nAlthough this scenario was not real, there have been several real-life investigations of anthrax illness involving drums made of contaminated animal hides.\n\nDisease Detectives worked in 2006 to determine that a drum maker in Pennsylvania caught inhalation anthrax by working with dried goat hides that had traces of anthrax spores. In 2009, a New Hampshire woman became sick with gastrointestinal anthrax (a very rare form of the disease that causes flu-like symptoms, sore throat, nausea, and diarrhea) after participating in a drumming event. Disease Detectives worked in each of these cases to determine the cause of the outbreak.\n\nAnthrax also has been used as a bioterrorist threat in the United States. In 2001, Disease Detectives helped solve an anthrax terrorist attack which affected many people across the United States.\n\nNote: Several aspects of the original outbreaks and investigations have been altered to fit the format and length of this application.\n\nBack To Top\n\nThe Village of Gold\n\nNumber Sick: 1400\n\nHospitalizations: 1150\n\nDeaths: 400\n\nLocation: Nigeria\n\nYour Mission:\n\nYour help is needed in a terrible outbreak that's affecting children!\n\nAn international group that aids the sick has discovered a horrifying health emergency: more than 100 children in a remote corner of Nigeria have died, and many more are extremely sick.\n\nThe sick aren't responding to anti-malaria medicine or antibiotics. They desperately need your help to solve the outbreak!\n\nClue 1\n\nDoctors Without Borders has been doing some routine health work in northwestern Nigeria. This is a remote area, with dusty and mountainous terrain. People here are very poor. Most are farmers or miners who dig for precious minerals like gold.\n\nThe doctors discovered that 3 villages are in the midst of a horrible outbreak: 118 children (many of them younger than 5) are dead. Many more are sick, with symptoms including vomiting, abdominal pain, headache, and convulsions (sudden, violent, uncontrollable shaking).\n\n1. It could take days to reach the village. What should you do?\n\nAnswer 1: Recommend that Nigerian authorities take a closer look first\n\n[Incorrect]\n\nThis is a major health crisis. With so many kids dead and more dying every day, there's no time for delay.\n\nGrab your passport and suitcase, get your vaccinations, and line up your visas and security clearances from the American and Nigerian embassies. It's time to fly to Nigeria!\n\nAnswer 2: Closely monitor the situation from CDC headquarters in Atlanta\n\n[Incorrect]\n\nSorry, but doing this slowly and deliberately won't fly this time. It's you who needs to fly, to Nigeria, right now!\n\nThis is a major health crisis. With so many kids dead and more dying every day, there's no time for delay.\n\nGrab your passport and suitcase, get your vaccinations, and line up your visas and security clearances from the American and Nigerian embassies. It's time to solve the outbreak!\n\nAnswer 3: Go to Nigeria immediately\n\n[Correct]\n\nThis is a major health crisis. With so many kids dead and more dying every day, there's no time for delay.\n\nSo grab your passport and suitcase, get your vaccinations, and line up your visas and security clearances from the American and Nigerian embassies. It's time to fly to Nigeria!\n\nClue 2\n\nIt's a major undertaking, but you and your team make it to the villages. There you find a terrible scene. Outside the villages is a graveyard with more than 100 newly dug, small graves.\n\nParents of children who died tell you that their kids had seizures, and you see that many of the sick kids are still having seizures. Others are listless, and some have gone blind.\n\nMost of the sick are children. There are some sick adults, too, but they aren't as bad off, and no adults have died.\n\nNotes\n\nJust reaching the villages was a huge challenge: after a long flight, you then had to drive for 2 days across hundreds of miles of dirt roads, over mountains, while hauling a huge amount of gear. You had medical equipment, environmental testing equipment, computers, large batteries for power, and more.\n\nGPS doesn't work out here, so simply finding the villages was an adventure. Sometimes you had to follow puzzling directions that people offered, like \"turn left at the river.\"\n\nYou also need a team of security guards, and you work closely with the local emir (religious leader) so that people know you're here to help.\n\nCases\n\nThere are 3 villages in this area. Each village consists of open-air dwellings with dirt floors, separated by low walls. People from extended families live in compounds (a number of dwellings close together, enclosed by a common wall).\n\nSome of the compounds have their own well for drinking water, but people in other compounds use a common village well.\n\nA few of the villagers begin to wonder if the drinking water is contaminated.\n\n2. What should you do next?\n\nAnswer 1: Take samples of the sick people's blood immediately\n\n[Incorrect]\n\nBecause this is such an emergency, yes, it seems like a good idea to rush in and take those samples right away. But that could backfire on you.\n\nThis is a traditional Muslim community, and you're an outsider here, coming from another country. You need to earn people's trust and can't assume they'll just go along with whatever you say. The first step is to meet with the village elders, explain what you want to do, and win them over so the villagers will cooperate.\n\nOK, now it's time to get those samples!\n\nAnswer 2: Get permission from the village elders, then take the samples\n\n[Correct]\n\nThat's right! Because this is an emergency, it may have seemed like a good idea to rush in and take those samples right away. But that could have backfired on you.\n\nThis is a traditional Muslim community, and you're an outsider here, coming from another country. You need to earn people's trust and can't assume they'll just go along with whatever you say. So the first step is to meet with the village elders, explain what you want to do, and win them over so the villagers will cooperate.\n\nOK, now it's time to get those samples!\n\nAnswer 3: Get everyone away from the villages immediately\n\n[Incorrect]\n\nYou still aren't sure how people are getting sick, so moving them to a different area might not help. Plus, relocating 3 villages isn't exactly an easy thing to do, and it certainly isn't a good way for an outsider like you to win the villagers' trust!\n\nIt's important to get blood samples, but the thing to do first is to get the permission of the village elders. Because this is a very traditional community, earning that approval first will make the rest of your job a bit easier.\n\nMore kids are dying, you need to hurry!\n\nClue 3\n\nNow that you have the village elders' permission, you take blood tests of all the sick people in the village, including children under 5.\n\nWhile doing your research in the villages, you notice that in many cases entire families are involved in mining. Many children work in the mines and even very young children help their mothers break down rocks or dry the ore in their own family compound.\n\nThe blood tests show that the sick children have extremely high levels of lead in their blood, which means they have lead poisoning, a serious and often fatal condition. The sick children need immediate treatment, but you only have a limited amount of medicine.\n\nCases\n\nAs part of the investigation, you discover that 1 of the 3 villages is not involved in gold mining and has a much lower rate of sickness than the other 2 villages. This leads you to suspect that the mining is to blame for the lead poisoning, since it releases so much toxic lead dust into the air.\n\nThe people who mine gold don't have sophisticated machinery or protective equipment. They collect large rocks and then crush them (with simple tools or their hands) without wearing facemasks, goggles, or gloves. And they don't do this work solely in a mine, either. Much of the work is done in the village, and some is even done in family compounds, by mothers and children.\n\nYou try to talk to the head of each household to find out whether the family members have been mining.\n\nDefinition\n\nWhat is lead poisoning?\n\nLead poisoning is a serious condition that occurs when lead builds up in the body. Even small amounts of lead can cause severe health problems. At very high levels, lead poisoning can be fatal.\n\nChildren under the age of 5 are especially vulnerable to lead poisoning because it can severely affect mental and physical development. Young children are also more likely to get lead poisoning because they're often on the ground and exposed to lead-contaminated soil and dust. They tend to put their hands in their mouth and nose, increasing their chances of infection.\n\nLead-based paint and lead-contaminated dust in older buildings are the most common sources of lead poisoning in children in the United States. Other sources include contaminated air, water, and soil.\n\n3. You have a limited amount of medicine. Whom should you give it to first?\n\nAnswer 1: Children who are least sick and have the best chance of recovery\n\n[Incorrect]\n\nIt's an awful choice to face, but in cases like this where there are so many sick and there is so little medicine, the best thing to do is focus on those who are having seizures or are in a coma. You simply don't have the ability to give medicine to every person who's been infected with lead at this point.\n\nAnswer 2: Children who are the most sick and have seizures or in a coma\n\n[Correct]\n\nThat's right. It's an awful choice to face, but in cases like this where there are so many sick and such little medicine, the best thing to do is focus on those children who are the most sick.\n\nAnswer 3: Children under 5 years old, beginning with the youngest\n\n[Incorrect]\n\nIt's an awful choice to face, but in cases like this where there are so many sick and a limited amount of medicine, the best thing to do is focus on those who are the most sick. You're right in realizing that all the children under the age of 5 are at risk, but for now you need to treat those who are having seizures or are in a coma.\n\nClue 4\n\nYou start treating the sickest kids with chelation therapy to help them recover.\n\nYou've learned that two-thirds of the families in the 2 sicker villages are mining gold. The mining could be responsible for the deaths, but because the villagers are so poor and this is the only way they can make money, they don't want to stop mining.\n\nYou need to determine what parts of mining put the villagers at highest risk. When interviewing the families, you ask about the types of mining activities they do. You need to figure out which of these activities are most dangerous.\n\nDefinition\n\nWhat is chelation therapy?\n\nChelation therapy is a treatment used to address lead poisoning. In Nigeria, doctors used an oral medicine (Succimer), a chemical that binds, or attaches, to heavy metals such as iron, lead, mercury, cadmium, and zinc. The body then removes the chemicals through urination.\n\nChildren treated with chelation therapy receive it over the course of many weeks. Children often need more than one dose of chelation especially if their blood lead levels are very high.\n\nChelation therapy saves lives. The deaths from lead poisoning stop almost immediately as soon as the medicine becomes available. However, it doesn't reverse any damage that has already been done to the child's brain. Some children are blind, have paralysis or major seizure disorders that could be permanent.\n\nData\n\nThere are several steps to mining the gold. Some people break the rocks into smaller gravel, some grind the rocks into a fine powder, some wash and dry the ore powder to separate the gold out, and some use heat to vaporize the mercury out.\n\nTo figure out which steps are most dangerous, you have a talk with mothers who have healthy children as well as mothers who have sick children. In all, you gather data about 52 healthy kids and 50 sick kids. Then, you ask the parents about each mining activity they do so you can calculate the \"attack rate\" for each activity.\n\nAttack Rate = the number of people who participated in an activity and are sick the total number of people who participated in an activity\n\n4. Based on your data, which children are most likely to get lead poisoning?\n\nAnswer 1: Kids whose parents grind rocks into powder, releasing toxic dust\n\n[Incorrect]\n\nYou're right that parents who grind rocks into powder are very likely to have sick kids. The attack rate for that is 73%, the highest of any activity.\n\nBut it's even worse if parents do 3 or 4 different mining activities. Their kids have an attack rate of 85%!\n\nKeep going to solve the outbreak!\n\nAnswer 2: Kids whose parents wash and dry ore\n\n[Incorrect]\n\nYou actually chose the activity with one of the lowest attack rates. It's still pretty bad at 59%, but some of the other activities are even worse.\n\nIf parents do 3 or 4 different mining activities, their kids have an attack rate of 85%!\n\nKeep going to solve the outbreak!\n\nAnswer 3: Kids whose parents perform the most mining activities\n\n[Correct]\n\nYou're right: kids whose parents perform 3 or 4 different mining activities have the highest attack rate (85%). The data shows you that all of the mining activities are unhealthy, and that each additional activity makes it even worse for the kids.\n\nKeep going to solve the outbreak!\n\nClue 5\n\nFour weeks after arriving in the villages, you've given chelation therapy to the sickest kids younger than 5. Most of them have improved, though many may still have permanent disabilities. Teams of Nigerian workers and environmental specialists thought it was best to remove the top layer of contaminated earth from the villages to reduce the number of people who get sick, so it was removed and buried far outside the village. They had to hurry, because the rainy season is coming, and such work will be impossible then.\n\nYou've been working hard to educate the miners about the risks of this kind of mining. You tell them not to mine from inside their own compounds. They should always keep their living areas free of mining activities.\n\nStill, they don't have good protective equipment. And even when they follow your advice, most of the miners come home covered in dust, tracking the dust when they walk to and from the village.\n\nData\n\nYou've kept careful track of the number of cases since the epidemic started by using an epi curve. An epi curve shows how an outbreak changes over time. It includes:\n\nDate when a person became sick.\n\nNumber of people who became sick on each day.\n\nEpi curves are updated as new data come in, so they are always changing. The shape of the curve can provide clues about the possible source of an outbreak.\n\nLearn how to read an epi curve.\n\nHealth Tips\n\nIn this outbreak, lead dust from the mines was to blame. However, in the US, when children have high blood lead levels, it's usually because of lead-based paint (which was banned from use in housing in 1978) and lead-contaminated dust. To avoid lead poisoning in the US, follow these tips:\n\nMake sure children do not have access to peeling paint or chewable surfaces painted with lead-based paint.\n\nRegularly wash children's hands and toys. Hands and toys can become contaminated from household dust or exterior soil. Both are known lead sources.\n\nCreate barriers between living/play areas and lead sources.\n\nPrevent children from playing in bare soil; if possible, provide them with sandboxes.\n\nPregnant women and children should not be present in housing built before 1978 that is undergoing renovation. They should not participate in activities that disturb old paint or in cleaning up paint debris after work is completed.\n\nHousehold dust is a major source of lead, so parents should wet-mop floors and wet-wipe horizontal surfaces every 2-3 weeks.\n\n5. Based on the epi curve, which of the following do you think is happening?\n\nAnswer 1: The epidemic is better, but hasn't gone away. The treatment hasn't worked\n\n[Incorrect]\n\nNot quite. The epi curve shows you that the number of sick has dropped quite a bit since you started chelation therapy and environmental repairs.\n\nIt's good that most families have stopped mining from inside their compounds. But the rate of illness is still way too high. What's likely happening is that miners are returning home covered in dust, which then infects their children. And even though the deaths have slowed down, the children are still being exposed to dangerous levels of lead, which can leave them with major handicaps such as blindness, spastic paralysis, seizure disorders, and mental retardation.\n\nYou did great work and helped solve the outbreak. But this is one case that, unfortunately, still hasn't been resolved. New cases are still appearing and will continue to appear until miners change their behaviors and environmental repairs can be completed.\n\nAnswer 2: The epidemic is better, but miners are still getting too much lead near their kids\n\n[Correct]\n\nThat's right. The epi curve shows you that the number of sick has dropped quite a bit since you started chelation therapy and environmental repairs, but the villages are still facing a lead poisoning outbreak.\n\nIt's good that most families have stopped mining from inside their compounds. But the rate of illness is still way too high. What's likely happening is that miners are returning home covered in dust, which then infects their children. And even though the deaths have slowed down, the children are still being exposed to dangerous levels of lead, which can leave them with major handicaps.\n\nYou did great work and helped solve the outbreak. But this is one case that, unfortunately, still hasn't been resolved. New cases are still appearing and will continue to appear until miners change their behaviors and environmental repairs can be completed.\n\nAnswer 3: The epidemic appears to be ending\n\n[Incorrect]\n\nSorry, but no. The epi curve shows you that the number of sick has dropped, but the villages are still facing a lead poisoning outbreak.\n\nIt's good that most families have stopped mining from inside their compounds. But the rate of illness is still way too high. What's likely happening is that miners are returning home covered in dust, which then infects their children. And even though the deaths have slowed down, the children are still being exposed to dangerous levels of lead, which can leave them with major handicaps.\n\nYou did great work and helped solve the outbreak. But this is one case that, unfortunately, still hasn't been resolved. New cases are still appearing and will continue to appear until miners change their behaviors and environmental repairs can be completed.\n\nLearn More\n\nThe true story behind the outbreak\n\nThis fictional scenario is based on a real-life outbreak that is still claiming lives in Nigeria.\n\nIn May 2010, Doctors Without Borders contacted the CDC and other groups after it discovered that a staggering number of children were dying in villages in a remote part of Zamfara Province. CDC scientists raced to the scene, where tests quickly showed that the children (and some adults) had severe lead poisoning. The cause of the outbreak was traced to what is called \"artisanal gold mining,\" or small-scale mining using primitive tools and little, if any, protective equipment.\n\nScientists have called this the worst case of mass lead poisoning in modern times.\n\nConditions were especially bad because much of the mining was done in family compounds, where children were exposed to huge amounts of lead through dust and other means. CDC, Nigerian authorities, Doctors Without Borders, and other organizations have worked hard to provide chelation therapy and to repair the environment by removing contaminated soil. But because much of the mining activities continue, the outbreak has not ended.\n\nNote: Aspects of the original outbreaks and investigations have been altered to fit the format and length of this application.\n\nBack To Top\n\nThe Queens Killer\n\nNumber Sick: 62\n\nHospitalizations: 59\n\nDeaths: 7\n\nLocation: US (1 State)\n\nYour Mission:\n\nWe're sending you back in time a bit for this one.\n\nIt's 1999, and the New York City Department of Health calls you when 11 people in Queens come down with a mysterious illness. They all had been healthy until very recently, when they suddenly got bad fever with headaches, neck stiffness, and disorientation (confusion). Some of them are partially paralyzed.\n\nSix are in the hospital, and 2 are in critical condition! Doctors suspect a virus, but what is it?\n\nClue 1\n\nIt's late August, and New York City is baking in a heat wave. Fred is a retired US veteran in his 70s and quite active for his age. He's an avid gardener and likes going for long walks every day.\n\nFred started feeling sick 5 days ago, and now he's in the hospital with a high fever, bad headache, and extreme muscle weakness. He's having so much trouble breathing that he's been put on a ventilator.\n\nHis doctor conducts tests that suggest Fred has a virus, although it's not yet clear what kind of virus. The next day, 2 people in their 60s with similar symptoms are admitted to the hospital.\n\nCases\n\nNew York City's Department of Health has reached out to all local hospitals to see if anyone else has been admitted with high fevers and headaches. As it turns out, a total of 11 people are hospitalized with similar symptoms, and they all live in northern Queens. Of the 11 cases, 9 live in the same general neighborhood, and the other 2 live only a short distance away.\n\nOverall, 8 of the 11 are 55 years or older. Most of them had been relatively healthy until getting this sickness, although 2 had recently returned from hospital stays (one after having hip replacement surgery and the other after having a skin lesion removed).\n\n1. Why do you think only older people are getting sick?\n\nAnswer 1: They have weaker immune systems\n\n[Incorrect]\n\nOn the one hand, it's true that older people have weaker immune systems, so sometimes they're more likely to catch certain illnesses. But you don't have any reason to suspect that age has anything to do with this outbreak. In fact, you don't have much information at all. That's the problem!\n\nYou need to talk to the sick people and find out more about what symptoms they have, what they've been doing lately, whether they know each other, and what they might have in common.\n\nKeep going before it spreads!\n\nAnswer 2: They're catching it from each other\n\n[Incorrect]\n\nOn the one hand, it's certainly suspicious that all of the sick people live in the same part of town. But you still don't have any reason to suspect that this is a contagious illness. In fact, you don't have much information at all. That's the problem!\n\nYou need to talk to the sick people and find out more about what symptoms they have, what they've been doing lately, whether they know each other, and what they might have in common.\n\nKeep going before it spreads!\n\nAnswer 3: It's too soon to tell\n\n[Correct]\n\nOn the one hand, it's true that older people have weaker immune systems, and it's certainly suspicious that all of the sick people live in the same part of town. But you don't have any evidence to support the idea that this is a contagious illness or that older people are more likely to catch it. In fact, you don't have much information at all. That's the problem!\n\nYou need to talk to the sick people and find out more about what symptoms they have, what they've been doing lately, whether they know each other, and what they might have in common.\n\nKeep going before it spreads!\n\nClue 2\n\nSadly, Fred dies in the hospital, as does another sick person. Three others are in critical condition, with very high fever, headache, disorientation (confusion), muscle weakness, and convulsions (sudden, violent, uncontrollable shaking).\n\nThe outbreak is getting worse. There are now 17 sick people, all of whom live in northern Queens.\n\nYou talk to the sick people and their relatives to find out what they had been doing in the days before they got sick. You visit their homes and investigate their environments, searching for clues.\n\nBlood samples from the patients are sent to the New York State Health Department laboratory where they will run tests to see if they can identify what may be making these people sick.\n\nData\n\nYou visit with the sick people and their families, asking questions like:\n\nWhen did you first get sick?\n\nHave you traveled much recently?\n\nWhat have you had to eat in the last 5 days?\n\nHave you taken any drugs in the last 5 days? If so, what?\n\nWhat kinds of animals have you been around lately?\n\nDo you spend a lot of time outside? How about in the evening?\n\nAre any of your friends or relatives sick, too?\n\nNotes\n\nYou've been hearing reports that an unusual number of dead crows are being found in the city. You don't have any reason to believe that this is connected to your investigation, because none of the sick people mention having been near birds lately.\n\nStill, you make a point of staying in touch with local veterinarians who are trying to find out why the birds died.\n\n2. Based on clues and data collected, what should you investigate next?\n\nAnswer 1: Diseases spread by birds\n\n[Incorrect]\n\nSorry, but there's no reason to suspect birds at this point. None of the people have mentioned being around birds. Of the sick people, 7 own pets, and only 3 reported that they have been around other animals lately.\n\nWhat should make you suspicious is the fact that 15 of the sick people have spent some time outdoors in the evening recently. That means they may have been bitten by mosquitoes, which can spread a variety of diseases.\n\nAnd if it is being spread by mosquitoes, that means more people could get it very quickly. You need to hurry!\n\nAnswer 2: Diseases spread by contagious people\n\n[Incorrect]\n\nSorry, but there's no reason to suspect that people are catching the illness from other sick people. Only 5 of the sick people know anyone else who is sick.\n\nWhat should make you suspicious is the fact that 15 of the sick people have recently spent some time outdoors in the evening. That means they may have been bitten by mosquitoes, which can spread a variety of diseases.\n\nAnd if it is being spread by mosquitoes, that means more people could get it very quickly. You need to hurry!\n\nAnswer 3: Diseases spread by mosquitoes\n\n[Correct]\n\nThat's right! The fact that 15 of the sick people have recently spent some time outdoors in the evening means that they could have been bitten by mosquitoes, which can spread a variety of diseases.\n\nAnd if it is being spread by mosquitoes, more people could get it soon. You need to hurry!\n\nClue 3\n\nMany of the sick people said they'd recently spent time outdoors in the evening (walking or gardening). In talking with the sick people, many confirm that they were bitten by a mosquito in the last week, although others can't quite remember.\n\nThis evidence, along with test results from the laboratory that suggest infection with a mosquito-transmitted virus, leads you to believe that the sick people have St. Louis encephalitis, a rare disease that caused another outbreak in New York back in the 1950s.\n\nBad news: the outbreak is spreading to other areas! You learn that 2 people in the Bronx have what appears to be the same illness, as does someone in Manhattan and someone in Westchester County, north of the Bronx. Two of these people say they've been to Queens recently. And you also get an update about all those dead birds.\n\nDefinition\n\nWhat is St. Louis encephalitis virus?\n\nSt. Louis encephalitis virus is transmitted to people by the bite of an infected mosquito. Most people infected with St. Louis encephalitis virus have no apparent illness, but some people do get quite sick. Initial symptoms include:\n\nFever\n\nHeadache\n\nNausea\n\nVomiting\n\nTiredness\n\nIn rare cases, St. Louis encephalitis virus can kill or cause long-term disability. Severe illness occurs more commonly in older adults.\n\nThere is no specific treatment for St. Louis encephalitis virus infection. You can reduce your risk by using insect repellent, wearing protective clothing, and staying indoors in the evening when mosquitoes are most active.\n\nNotes\n\nThe reports about dead crows keep coming. The Bronx Zoo calls to say that several of their birds have also died in the last 3 days, including exotic species like Chilean flamingos. But St. Louis encephalitis virus doesn't kill birds, so you assume that this is an unrelated disease.\n\nTo be safe, you talk to the team of veterinarians who took lab samples from the dead birds. The cause of death still hasn't been determined, so they're still investigating and will update you with any news.\n\nHealth Tips\n\nYou can help reduce the number of mosquitoes in outdoor areas where you work and play by draining sources of standing water. These are places where mosquitoes lay their eggs and breed.\n\nAt least once or twice a week, empty water from flower pots, pet food and water dishes, birdbaths, swimming pool covers, kiddie pools, buckets, barrels, and cans.\n\nCheck for clogged rain gutters and clean them out.\n\nRemove discarded tires and other items that could collect water.\n\nLocal mosquito control organizations may also spray insecticides to help further reduce the number of mosquitoes in your neighborhood.\n\nSupport your local community mosquito control programs.\n\nUse mosquito repellents when you go outdoors.\n\nNote: Vitamin B and \"ultrasonic\" devices are not effective in preventing mosquito bites.\n\n3. You encourage people to use insect repellents. What else should you do?\n\nAnswer 1: Encourage people to empty standing water around their home\n\n[Incorrect]\n\nThis is important because mosquitoes - the primary carriers of these diseases - like to breed in stagnant water in ditches, sewage treatment ponds, old tires, clogged gutters, and other sources of standing water but because of the scale and scope of the outbreak, we need to think bigger.\n\nThe best step now is to consider spraying insecticides in New York City to control the mosquito population.\n\nKeep going to solve the outbreak!\n\nAnswer 2: Spray insecticides in New York City and other areas\n\n[Correct]\n\nThat's right! The best step now is to weigh the risks and benefits of spraying insecticides in New York City and surrounding areas. You need to kill off the mosquitoes so they can't infect more people, and the fastest way to do it is by spraying insecticides from trucks or aircrafts to kill adult mosquitoes.\n\nLocal town/county mosquito control helps reduce the number of mosquitoes. This is a crucial part of reducing the risk of infection spreading to people. Mosquito control won't get rid of every last mosquito, but combined with repellent use, it can markedly reduce the chances of getting bitten.\n\nKeep going to solve the outbreak!\n\nAnswer 3: Encourage people to get vaccinated\n\n[Incorrect]\n\nYes, a St. Louis encephalitis virus vaccine would be great, if only one existed. But it doesn't.\n\nThat means that the best step now is to spray insecticides in New York City and surrounding areas. You need to kill off the mosquitoes before they infect more people.\n\nKeep going to solve the outbreak!\n\nClue 4\n\nLab tests on the dead crows show that they have West Nile virus, which has never been found in the Western Hemisphere before!\n\nKnowing this information, you decide to run a different test on the sick people. You learn they don't have St. Louis encephalitis virus after all; they have West Nile virus. West Nile virus is closely related to St. Louis encephalitis virus and causes a similar illness. Since West Nile virus has never been seen in the United States before, the clinical findings and lab tests could be confusing.\n\nMosquitoes spread West Nile virus to people, but mosquitoes can also spread it to birds. This is why the birds started dying at about the same time that so many people got sick.\n\nNow that you know West Nile virus has come to the United States, you need to take some steps to prevent it from spreading even more!\n\nDefinition\n\nWhat is West Nile virus?\n\nWest Nile virus disease is a potentially serious illness spread by mosquitoes. Before 1999, West Nile virus had never been found in the Western Hemisphere. Although it's not clear how the virus came to our area, experts believe West Nile virus disease is now a seasonal epidemic in North America that flares up in the summer and continues into the fall.\n\nPeople typically get symptoms 4 to 10 days after they are bitten by an infected mosquito. West Nile virus affects everyone differently:\n\nAbout 4 in 5 people who are infected will not show any symptoms at all.\n\nUp to 1 in 5 people who become infected will have symptoms such as fever, headache, body aches, nausea, vomiting, or a rash. Most of the symptoms last for a few days. In some people, fatigue may linger for several weeks.\n\nA small number of people (about 1 in 150) will develop severe illness. These severe symptoms can include disorientation, coma, convulsions, tremors, and paralysis. These symptoms can last several weeks, and some damage to the brain and nerves may be permanent.\n\nCases\n\nYou work with city, county, and state authorities to set traps that will collect mosquitoes from across the area.\n\nYou test the mosquitoes for various viruses, including West Nile virus. You have already begun a carefully targeted program of spraying insecticides in northern Queens and the neighboring south Bronx to cut down on the mosquito population, decreasing the possibility that West Nile virus will spread.\n\nThe city sprays insecticides on September 10 (about 3 weeks after you were first called in). The surrounding areas are sprayed on September 14. During the next few days, a few more people get sick. You need to figure out if the insecticides are working or if the illness is still spreading. If it is, you'll need to try something else to stop the spread.\n\nData\n\nTo keep track of the outbreak, you've created an epidemiologic (epi) curve. This shows Disease Detectives how an outbreak changes over time. It includes:\n\nDate when a person became sick.\n\nNumber of people who became sick on each day.\n\nEpi curves are updated as new data come in, so they are always changing. The shape of the curve can provide clues about the possible source of an outbreak.\n\nLearn how to read an epi curve.\n\n4. Has the spraying of insecticides helped to stop the spread of West Nile virus?\n\nAnswer 1: Yes, the outbreak is tapering off\n\n[Correct]\n\nYou weren't fooled by the fact that a few people got sick after the spraying of insecticides. That's because West Nile virus has an incubation period of 4-10 days, meaning that those people were probably bitten before the spraying but didn't get symptoms until afterwards.\n\nThe bottom line is that the various public health measures you've taken (encouraging people to avoid mosquito bites and spraying insecticides throughout the city and surrounding areas) have been a big help!\n\nThings are looking better in New York City, but how about the rest of the country? There's one step to go to solve the outbreak!\n\nAnswer 2: No, because some people still got sick after the spraying\n\n[Incorrect]\n\nOn the one hand, you're right that some people did get sick after the spraying of insecticides. But that's not because the spraying didn't work, it's because West Nile virus has an incubation period of 4-10 days. Those people were probably bitten before the spraying but didn't get symptoms until afterwards.\n\nThe bottom line is that the various public health measures you've taken (encouraging people to avoid mosquito bites and spraying insecticides throughout the city and surrounding areas) have been a big help! The outbreak appears to be fading in New York.\n\nBut how about the rest of the country? There's one step to go to solve the outbreak!\n\nAnswer 3: Too soon to tell\n\n[Incorrect]\n\nThe epi curve shows us that the outbreak appears to be tapering off. A small number of people got sick after the spraying of insecticides, but that's because West Nile virus has an incubation period of 4-10 days. Those people were probably bitten before the spraying but didn't get symptoms until afterwards.\n\nThe bottom line is that the various public health measures you've taken (encouraging people to avoid mosquito bites and spraying insecticides throughout the city and surrounding areas) have been a big help!\n\nThings are looking better in New York City, but how about the rest of the country? There's one step to go to solve the outbreak!\n\nClue 5\n\nAs October begins, a total of 62 people have gotten sick, and 7 have died. All of the people who died were in their 60s or older. Blood tests you've taken of other New Yorkers show that many other people have been infected with the virus, too, but they never showed any symptoms. As has been the case in other countries, only a small percentage of the people infected with West Nile virus actually became sick.\n\nNow that the weather has gotten cooler, mosquitoes have stopped biting people in New York and other northeastern states. We may never know how West Nile virus first came to the United States, but odds are good that it will reappear next spring when mosquitoes return.\n\nNotes\n\nThere are a few theories to explain how West Nile virus came to the United States:\n\nInfected migrating birds brought the virus to New York City.\n\nInfected birds may have flown to or been transported to the United States.\n\nVirus-infected mosquitoes may have been brought accidentally to the United States on boats or planes from other countries.\n\nHealth Tips\n\nMosquito bites are more than an itchy pain. They can also spread serious illnesses. Follow these steps to avoid bites:\n\nApply insect repellent to exposed skin.\n\nWhen weather permits, wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants when outdoors.\n\nPlace mosquito netting over infant carriers when you are outdoors with infants.\n\nConsider staying indoors at dawn, dusk, and in the early evening, which are peak mosquito-biting times.\n\nInstall or repair window and door screens so that mosquitoes cannot get indoors.\n\nSpray clothing with repellents containing permethrin, since mosquitoes can bite through thin clothing. Do not apply repellents containing permethrin directly to your skin.\n\n5. What should you do to prevent West Nile virus from spreading across the US?\n\nAnswer 1: Spray insecticides across the country\n\n[Incorrect]\n\nYou would need a whole lot of insecticide to spray the entire United States. There's no need to go crazy!\n\nThe best thing to do at this point is to start educating people across the country about the importance of using insect repellents and taking other steps to avoid mosquito bites.\n\nYou'll also want to warn other local and state health departments that West Nile virus will likely spread into new areas. They'll need to start taking steps now for monitoring virus activity in the future, and they should start figuring out how they'll control their mosquito population when the virus reaches them.\n\nCongratulations, your hard work helped solve the outbreak!\n\nAnswer 2: Tell people to avoid mosquito bites\n\n[Correct]\n\nThat's right! The best thing to do at this point is to start educating people across the country about the importance of using insect repellents and taking other steps to avoid mosquito bites.\n\nYou'll also want to warn other local and state health departments that West Nile virus will likely spread into new areas. They'll need to start taking steps now for monitoring virus activity in the future, and they should start figuring out how they'll control their mosquito population when the virus reaches them.\n\nCongratulations, you solved the outbreak!\n\nAnswer 3: It's here to stay and there's nothing you can do\n\n[Incorrect]\n\nHey, what kind of attitude is that? On the one hand, you're right that once West Nile virus made it to the United States, it was here to stay. But there's plenty you can do to make sure we don't have big outbreaks!\n\nThe best thing to do at this point is to start educating people across the country about the importance of using insect repellents and taking other steps to avoid mosquito bites.\n\nYou'll also want to warn other local and state health departments that West Nile virus will likely spread into new areas. They'll need to start taking steps now for monitoring virus activity in the future, and they should start figuring out how they'll control their mosquito population when the virus reaches them.\n\nCongratulations, your hard work helped solve the outbreak!\n\nLearn More\n\nYour hard work helped solve the outbreak!\n\nAlthough the characters in this story were not real, this scenario is based on a real outbreak that CDC helped solve. In the summer of 1999, an unusually high number of New Yorkers were hospitalized with encephalitis (inflammation of the brain).\n\nThey were originally diagnosed with St. Louis encephalitis, but when a large number of birds started dying in the city, scientists learned that the birds actually had West Nile virus. This was the first time West Nile virus had ever been reported in the United States.\n\nWest Nile virus was first discovered in the West Nile District of Uganda in 1937. The virus became recognized as a cause of encephalitis in older patients during an outbreak in Israel in 1957. West Nile virus had been reported in Africa, Europe, and the Middle East, but it wasn't until 1999 that it was found in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nSince then, West Nile virus activity has been reported in people, birds, other animals, or mosquitoes in every state except Alaska and Hawaii.\n\nThat means that every spring and summer, there is a possibility that a new outbreak could occur almost anywhere in the continental United States.\n\nThe best way to prevent West Nile virus and other mosquito-borne diseases like St. Louis encephalitis virus is to avoid getting mosquito bites by using insect repellents, reducing mosquito breeding sites on your property, supporting local mosquito control programs, and limiting your time outdoors when mosquitoes are present.\n\nNote: Several aspects of the original outbreak and investigation have been altered to fit the format and length of this application.\n\nBack To Top\n\nCase of the Conference Blues\n\nNumber Sick: 37\n\nHospitalizations: 5\n\nDeaths: 1\n\nLocation: US (5 States)\n\nYour Mission:\n\nThe Georgia state veterinary conference just ended. Dozens of people got sick at the conference, complaining of severe stomach cramps, diarrhea, and fever.\n\nThe conference coordinator called the state health department to report that several participants are sick and 2 have been hospitalized. As an officer in the CDC Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) stationed at the Georgia Department of Public Health, you have been called in to help.\n\nClue 1\n\nYou are on a mission to stop this outbreak! First, you call the event coordinator and ask for a schedule of events and a list of the conference attendees. The coordinator also gives you contact information for the 15 people she knows who are sick so far.\n\nYou begin by attempting to call each sick person to interview them and ask about their symptoms, when they first became sick, which events they attended at the conference, what they ate and drank while at the conference, and if they know of others who are sick. Since you don't have any lab results yet, you need other information to come up with a hypothesis (an idea or theory) about what is making people sick and what these people have in common.\n\nLater, you'll need to find out:\n\nHow many people are sick?\n\nWhat are the signs and symptoms of those who are sick?\n\nWhen did the illness begin?\n\nWhat do the individuals have in common?\n\nWhich events did each of the sick people attend?\n\nData\n\nYou succeed in reaching 10 of the 15 sick people. To better understand how the attendees got sick, you ask about the activities in which they participated since arriving at the conference.\n\nYou also ask about the foods they ate, drinks consumed, as well as other activities that might have put them at risk.\n\nYou then study the data to see what the sick people have in common.\n\n1. When were the conference attendees exposed to something that made them sick?\n\nAnswer 1: At the conference hotel\n\n[Incorrect]\n\nSorry, while several people who stayed at the hotel are sick, there are a number of sick people who did not stay at the conference hotel.\n\nYou're trying to come up with a hypothesis, and since all 10 of the sick people you interviewed attended the Welcome Party, you suspect the Welcome Party is to blame. You'll need to investigate more to confirm or refute your suspicion.\n\nAnswer 2: At the welcome party\n\n[Correct]\n\nYou're off to a great start!\n\nYou suspect the Welcome Party is to blame since all 10 of the people who are sick attended that event, but you need to investigate more to confirm or refute your suspicion.\n\nAnswer 3: At the opening session\n\n[Incorrect]\n\nSorry. While several people who attended the opening session are sick, there are a number of sick people who did not attend the opening session.\n\nYou're trying to come up with a hypothesis since the lab results aren't back yet. You suspect the Welcome Party is to blame since all 10 of the people who are sick attended that function, but you need to investigate more to confirm or refute your suspicion.\n\nClue 2\n\nThe good news is most of the people who are sick are starting to get better. In talking with a few of the attendees, you learn that most of them met a lot of new people at the Welcome Party, shook hands, and ate some food.\n\nBased on what they've told you about the party, you suspect something the participants ate at the Welcome Party is causing everyone to be sick. However, in order to be certain you'll need to interview as many of the conference attendees as possible.\n\nThe conference organizer tells you the food at the Welcome Party was prepared by a local caterer. You request a copy of the menu served at the Welcome Party in order to develop a list of items to which participants might have been exposed.\n\nData\n\nDuring your initial 10 interviews you asked about attendee participation in various conference events, as well as the food items they ate during conference events.\n\nUsing the information gathered from the interviews, along with the Welcome Party menu, you create a standard questionnaire that you use to interview as many of the 75 conference attendees as possible. You make sure to ask clear, detailed questions about any items you suspect.\n\nBy interviewing most of the 75 conference attendees, you learn that at least 25 people are sick, including your 10 initial interviewees. A few individuals began feeling ill on Monday, with many more reporting symptoms on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nYou don't have laboratory test results yet, so you define a sick person as someone who attended the conference and began having diarrhea anytime between Jan. 29 through Feb. 5.\n\nTo analyze the data, you create an epidemic curve or \"epi curve\" which shows how an outbreak changes over time. It includes:\n\nDate when each person became sick.\n\nNumber of people who became sick on each day.\n\nLearn more about an epi curve.\n\nCases\n\nAfter conducting these additional interviews, you calculate the attack rate and relative risk of each conference event and each menu item from the Welcome Party.\n\nBased on the interviews, you confirm your initial hypothesis that the illness was associated with the Welcome Party and not any of the other conference events. You therefore focus on determining the attack rates of the food items at the party.\n\nAttack Rate for the Food Items = the number of people who ate a food item and are sick the total number of people who ate a food item\n\nNotes\n\nRelative risk is a measure of association that helps you to determine which items are most likely responsible for an outbreak. It allows investigators to compare risk factors or exposures among those who are sick, compared with those who are not.\n\nRelative risk = the attack rate for people who were exposed to the item the attack rate for those who were not exposed\n\nSince you have identified the Welcome Party as the source of illness, you now focus on the relative risk of the food items served at the party.\n\n2. What do you think is the likely source of the outbreak?\n\nAnswer 1: Chicken tenders\n\n[Incorrect]\n\nNo need to be \"chicken\" to eat the chicken tenders! However, you should watch out for the spinach dip and veggie lasagna! These foods have the highest attack rates and elevated relative risks.\n\nMaybe there's a common ingredient in these 2 dishes that is to blame?\n\nKeep working to solve the outbreak.\n\nAnswer 2: Spinach dip\n\n[Correct]\n\nIt does look like the spinach dip had a high attack rate and an elevated relative risk, but so did the veggie lasagna.\n\nMaybe there's a common ingredient in these 2 dishes that is to blame?\n\nKeep working to solve the outbreak.\n\nAnswer 3: More than one of the food items\n\n[Correct]\n\nThe attack rates and relative risks for the spinach dip and veggie lasagna are very suspicious. Perhaps there's a common ingredient in these 2 dishes that is to blame?\n\nKeep working to solve the outbreak.\n\nClue 3\n\nInitial laboratory results are back and show that the outbreak is likely due to E. coli O157. The state health department has to confirm the results in their lab, but that could take several days.\n\nIn the meantime, you ask the caterer for a list of the recipes from the Welcome Party and review the ingredients. You notice that the 2 dishes with the highest relative risks (the spinach dip and veggie lasagna) both had raw spinach leaves added as a garnish after the dishes were cooked; no other dishes used raw spinach and there were no other common ingredients between these 2 dishes. You immediately contact the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and tell them about your suspicions that raw spinach could be the source of this outbreak.\n\nYou don't have any time to waste, so you go visit the caterer. Luckily, you find some unopened bags of fresh spinach that were purchased at the same time as those used to prepare the food for the Welcome Party. Since the spinach is still in the bag, FDA is able to trace the lot numbers for this product to find out where it was grown and bagged.\n\nDefinition\n\nWhat is E. coli?\n\nEscherichia coli (abbreviated as E. coli) are bacteria found in the environment, foods, and intestines of people and animals.\n\nMost E. coli are harmless and actually are an important part of a healthy human intestinal tract. However, some are pathogenic, meaning they can cause illness, either diarrhea or illness outside of the intestinal tract. The types of E. coli that can cause diarrhea can be transmitted through contaminated water or food, through contact with animals or their environments, or when infected people do not wash hands well after going to the bathroom, and the bacteria get from their hands into someone else's mouth.\n\nSome kinds of E. coli cause disease by making a toxin called Shiga toxin. The bacteria that make these toxins are called \"Shiga toxin-producing\" E. coli, or STEC. The most commonly identified STEC in North America is E. coli O157:H7.\n\nPeople infected with E. coli O157:H7 usually get sick within 2 to 8 days (average of 3 to 4 days) after swallowing the organism. Most people develop diarrhea (usually watery and often bloody) and stomach cramps. Most illnesses resolve on their own within 7 days. Some illnesses last longer and can be more severe.\n\nHemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a type of kidney failure, can begin as the diarrhea is improving. HUS can occur in people of any age but is most common in children under 5 years old and the elderly.\n\nGet tips on how to stay safe.\n\nHealth Tips\n\nThe best way to protect yourself from an E. coli infection is to:\n\nWash your hands thoroughly after using the bathroom or changing diapers and before preparing or eating food. You should also wash your hands after contact with animals or their environments (at farms, petting zoos, fairs, even your own backyard). This is important even if the animals appear healthy because they can still be shedding germs that can make you sick.\n\nCook meats thoroughly. Ground beef and meat that has been needle-tenderized should be cooked to a temperature of at least 160Â°F (70Â°C). It's best to use a thermometer, as color is not a very reliable indicator of \"doneness.\"\n\nAvoid raw milk, unpasteurized dairy products (like raw milk soft cheeses), and unpasteurized juices (like fresh apple cider).\n\nAvoid swallowing water when swimming or playing in lakes, ponds, streams, swimming pools, and backyard \"kiddie\" pools.\n\nPrevent cross-contamination in food preparation areas by thoroughly washing hands, counters, cutting boards, and utensils after you touch raw meat.\n\nNotes\n\nWhat is a Lot Number?\n\nA lot number is an identification (ID) number given to each batch of a product (or subset of a batch). When manufacturers produce a product, they give each batch a unique lot number so that it is possible to track the product, including the ingredients used, the manufacturing plant, and the equipment used to process an item.\n\nLot numbers help with tracing and may even help you find the specific farm or field where the produce was grown and processed.\n\n3. What would you do next in the investigation?\n\nAnswer 1: Test leftover spinach for E. coli O157:H7 and contact the spinach producer\n\n[Correct]\n\nYou're exactly right! As you wait for the results, it's a good idea for you to jointly work with FDA to contact the spinach producer and inform them about the investigation.\n\nBefore you can determine if the spinach is contaminated, you'll need to rule out things like cross-contamination in the kitchen while the food was being prepared, as well as the possibility that someone who was sick prepared the food.\n\nIf the spinach is to blame, the state health department and FDA will work to find out where the spinach was produced, how it was packaged, and where it was distributed. FDA and the state work to collect and analyze records, looking for common producers or suppliers, as well as other companies who received the spinach of concern.\n\nAnswer 2: Recommend a recall of spinach by this producer\n\n[Incorrect]\n\nA recall is a bit premature at this point. Before you determine if the spinach is contaminated, you'll need to rule out things like cross-contamination in the kitchen while the food was being prepared, as well as the possibility that someone who was sick prepared the food.\n\nYou should work with the state health department and FDA to have the spinach tested for E. coli O157. As you wait for the results, it's a good idea for you to jointly work with FDA to contact the spinach producer and inform them about the investigation.\n\nIf the spinach is to blame, the state health department and FDA will work to find out where the spinach was produced, how it was packaged, and where it was distributed. FDA and the state work to collect and analyze records, looking for common producers or suppliers, as well as other companies who received the spinach of concern.\n\nAnswer 3: Issue an advisory about E. coli infections linked to spinach\n\n[Incorrect]\n\nBefore you determine if the spinach is contaminated, you'll need to rule out things like cross-contamination in the kitchen while the food was being prepared, as well as the possibility that someone who was sick prepared the food.\n\nYou should work with the state health department and FDA to have the spinach tested for E. coli O157.

FDA and the state work to collect and analyze records, looking for common producers or suppliers, as well as other companies who received the spinach of concern.\n\nClue 4\n\nThe results from the state health department are in! The bacterial testing shows the sick people are, in fact, infected with E. coli O157:H7.\n\nThe State Public Health Laboratory sends the DNA \"fingerprints\" to PulseNet (a national network of state and local public health laboratories and federal food regulatory laboratories).\n\nPulseNet scientists at CDC headquarters in Atlanta compare \"fingerprints\" of this strain of E. coli O157 with the DNA \"fingerprints\" in the database and find that this particular strain is indistinguishable from that of 12 other cases that have been reported across the country in the last few weeks. You also discover that this strain has never been reported to PulseNet before now.\n\nCases\n\nIn fact, there is already another ongoing investigation of these 12 sick people. You learn from the EIS officer at CDC headquarters that they are already investigating this outbreak. They also tell you that 3 additional people have been hospitalized and 1 person has died.\n\nIn total, 37 people are infected with the outbreak strain from 5 different states. Twenty-five people were infected during the conference in Georgia, and another 12 people are spread across the country:\n\nCalifornia: 2\n\nGeorgia: 25\n\nMIssouri: 2\n\nTennessee: 5\n\nUtah: 3\n\n4. What should you do next?\n\nAnswer 1: Shut down the production facility where spinach was packaged\n\n[Incorrect]\n\nWe first need to find out if the other 12 people who are sick even ate spinach. If so, then we'll need to track down the point of contamination and that could be anywhere from the field, to the packaging plant, to the distribution center.\n\nYou still have more work to do!\n\nAnswer 2: Ask FDA to contact the spinach producer to suggest a voluntary recall\n\n[Incorrect]\n\nWe first need to find out if the other 12 people who are sick even ate spinach. If so, then we'll need to track down the point of contamination and that could be anywhere from the field, to the packaging plant, to the distribution center.\n\nYou still have more work to do!\n\nAnswer 3: Determine if the 12 people also ate spinach\n\n[Correct]\n\nYou're absolutely right. The next thing you need to do is talk to the 12 additional people who are sick in other states and find out if they ate spinach. If so, then we'll need to track down the point of contamination and that could be anywhere from the field, to the packaging plant, to the distribution center.\n\nYou still have more work to do!\n\nClue 5\n\nYour hunch is right! The initial interviews from the state and local investigators reveal 11 of the 12 other sick people ate spinach, too. To find out if these people ate the same brand of spinach as those at the conference, you need to review the data collected during all of the interviews.\n\nIn the meantime, FDA visits the production facility where the spinach used at the conference event is cleaned and bagged. During their visit, FDA officials look at the possible points of contamination (such as dirty wash water, sick employees handling the spinach, or other problems). However, no likely points of contamination are found.\n\nFDA decides to visit the spinach farm. Now this is a \"field\" investigation!\n\nData\n\nYou review data collected from interviews with each of the 11 additional sick people to find out if they ate the same brand of spinach that made conference attendees sick. You want to learn more about when and where they might have eaten it, including if they ate the spinach at home or in a restaurant. If the spinach was eaten at home, you'll also want to know what brand it was and from where it was purchased.\n\nBased on your data review, you discover all of the people who are sick ate the same brand of spinach as the attendees from the conference. Fortunately, 2 of the individuals still have some of the spinach, so you collect the spinach to check the lot number and test it for E. coli O157:H7.\n\nNot only do the lot numbers match the bags of spinach from the conference caterer, but lab testing of these new bags of spinach finds they were also contaminated with E. coli O157:H7.\n\nNotes\n\nDuring the visit to the spinach farm, the farm manager is interviewed so data can be collected about the farm and its operations.\n\nThe spinach farm is next to a creek. Across the creek, about a quarter a mile away, there is a farm with 300 cows The pastures the cows graze in is a very hilly area that is on higher ground.\n\nThere is a well maintained fence to keep the cows out of the fields and away from the creek. The spinach farmer reports that he uses treated well water for his crops, but there has been some flooding in parts of his fields due to recent heavy rains.\n\nTip\n\nDid you know that cattle are natural carriers of E. coli O157:H7?\n\nCows do not always carry E. coli O157, but sometimes they do.\n\nAlthough cows are usually not affected by the bacteria, they can carry it and shed it in their waste, even while appearing healthy. If the bacteria got into the spinach fields, it could contaminate the spinach.\n\n5. What do you think caused the outbreak?\n\nAnswer 1: The cows ate the contaminated spinach\n\n[Incorrect]\n\nBecause of heavy rains, the cows have been grazing in the pasture across the stream, uphill from the spinach farm. Also, there's a fence that prevents the cows from getting into the creek or the fields. There's no way they could have eaten the spinach.\n\nCow manure is collected and tests positive for the outbreak strain of E. coli O157. Floods from the rain most likely washed the cows' waste onto the plants closest to the stream (which explains why only 1 lot was infected). The cows are therefore the likely source of the spinach contamination.\n\nYou recommend that the spinach farmer improve drainage to avoid flooding from the creek when there is a heavy rain.\n\nAnswer 2: The fields were irrigated with contaminated water\n\n[Incorrect]\n\nBecause of the proximity to the cattle farm, the farmer doesn't use the water from the stream to irrigate the fields and instead uses treated water from a well.\n\nCow manure is collected and tests positive for the outbreak strain of E. coli O157. Floods from the rain most likely washed the cows' waste onto the plants closest to the stream (which explains why only 1 lot was infected). The cows are therefore the likely source of the spinach contamination.\n\nYou recommend that the spinach farmer improve drainage to avoid flooding when there is a heavy rain.\n\nAnswer 3: The flooding washed the cows' waste into the spinach field\n\n[Correct]\n\nThe cattle have been grazing in the pasture across the stream, uphill from the spinach farm. Cow manure is collected and tests positive for the outbreak strain of E. coli O157. Floods from the rain most likely washed the cows' waste onto the plants closest to the stream (which explains why only 1 lot was infected). The cows are therefore the likely source of the spinach contamination.\n\nThanks to the hard work conducted by your team, the state health department, and the FDA, the affected lots were located and recalled, potentially preventing many more people from getting sick. Additionally, the spinach farmer will make changes to improve drainage and help keep the spinach safe in the future.\n\nYour quick thinking and keen detective skills were key to solving this outbreak!\n\nLearn More\n\nThis fictional outbreak was based partly on a real-life outbreak of fresh spinach in the US in August and September 2006.\n\nOver the course of this outbreak, 183 people became sick from E. coli O157:H7 in 26 states, 95 people were hospitalized, and 1 person died.\n\nCDC's Disease Detectives partnered with state and local health departments to work diligently to solve this outbreak by interviewing the people who were sick. By doing so, they found that 95% of the people had eaten uncooked, fresh spinach during the 10 days before getting sick. Based on CDC's investigation, the FDA issued an advisory to warn people about eating fresh, bagged spinach.\n\nCDC's National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases (NCEZID) aims to prevent disease, disability, and death caused by a wide range of infectious diseases.\n\nNote: Several aspects of the original outbreak and investigation and findings have been altered to fit the format and length of this application.\n\nBack To Top\n\nSugar Plantation Blues\n\nNumber Sick: 11\n\nHospitalizations: 1\n\nDeaths: 11\n\nLocation: US (1 State)\n\nYour Mission:\n\nIt's midsummer in Louisiana: hot, humid, and time to harvest sugarcane. Several workers at a sugar plantation are sick with a mysterious illness that's left one man in the hospital. Harvesting sugarcane is a physically demanding job, and the men work in very tough conditions.\n\nDo they just have a bad virus, or is it something they got from working close together in the scorching heat?\n\nLocal doctors need your help to solve the outbreak!\n\nClue 1\n\nThe workers reported to the sugar plantation for their first day on July 9. After 2 days on the job, 7 workers went to the doctor complaining of headache, fatigue, and muscle aches. Six of them have fevers. The doctor told them to take some painkillers and get some rest.\n\nA couple of days later, one of those sick workers, a 20-year-old named Jorge, had to be taken to the nearest hospital. His left shoulder and arm were in a lot of pain, and his hand was numb. The manager just thinks his new workers are faking to get out of work, but one doctor thinks it could be a meningitis outbreak.\n\nNotes\n\nThe temperature has been over 100 degrees since the beginning of July, and the humidity makes it even worse. Mosquitoes are thick in the air, and venomous snakes slither in the grass. Some of the workers have had to watch out for stray dogs that wander onto the plantation.\n\nThe workers share water bottles in the field, and many of them take dips in a nearby lake to cool off after work.\n\nDefinition\n\nWhat is Meningitis?\n\nMeningitis is a disease caused by swelling of the meninges, which are membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord. The swelling is usually a result of an infection of the fluid around the brain and spinal cord.\n\nMeningitis is most often caused by bacteria or viruses. Meningitis also can be caused by physical injury, cancer, certain drugs, or even parasites.\n\nHealth Tips\n\nSwimming in warm water (lakes, ponds, and pools) can put you at risk of recreational water illnesses (RWIs). These are caused by germs spread when people swallow or come into contact with contaminated (dirty) water.\n\nRWIs include many different kinds of infections, affecting skin, ears, eyes, digestive systems, and the brain. Diarrhea is the most common symptom of RWIs.\n\n1. What should you do first?\n\nAnswer 1: Install mosquito nets in the sleeping quarters\n\n[Incorrect]\n\nYou don't have any reason to suspect that mosquitoes are spreading the illness. You need to find out what the patients have in common first.\n\nKeep investigating before it spreads!\n\nAnswer 2: Talk to the sick workers\n\n[Correct]\n\nYou're right! The first thing to do is get a better idea of what the sick people have in common.\n\nKeep investigating before it spreads!\n\nAnswer 3: Test the plantation's lake and drinking water\n\n[Incorrect]\n\nMost recreational water illnesses lead to diarrhea, and none of the sick patients have that. Since one of the doctors suspects meningitis, there may come a time to test the water. But that shouldn't be first on your list.\n\nYou need to find out what the patients have in common first.\n\nKeep investigating before it spreads!\n\nClue 2\n\nFour more workers are sick on July 13, bringing the total to 11. You interview the sick workers and their manager to get more information.\n\nThe workers were split into 3 groups on 3 different fields. Some shared water bottles while they worked, and some swam in the lake afterwards. Some of the workers live in the town year-round, but many came from other parts of the state and even other countries.\n\nMost live in cramped apartments, sharing bedrooms. A few sleep in small trailers on the plantation property.\n\nData\n\nOf the 11 who are sick, 6 recently traveled from another country (4 are from Mexico and 2 are from Guatemala). Jorge, who's from Guatemala, is the only one in the hospital.\n\nEight of the sick workers have worked on this plantation in past summers, and they don't think the hard work or the heat has anything to do with why they've gotten sick.\n\n2. What activity is most linked to the illness?\n\nAnswer 1: Living with people who are sick\n\n[Incorrect]\n\nSorry, no. It's true that a lot of the sick workers are living with a sick person (7 out of 11). But an even bigger number have worked on the North Field (9 out of 11).\n\nBoth of those things lead you to believe that this is a contagious illness. You need to hurry!\n\nAnswer 2: Working on the North Field\n\n[Correct]\n\nThat's right! The data shows you that people who worked on the North Field were much more likely to get sick.\n\nBut why? That's what you need to find out next!\n\nAnswer 3: Sharing a water bottle\n\n[Incorrect]\n\nSix of the sick workers shared their water bottle, which is a good way to spread germs. But what most (9) of the workers have in common is that they worked at the North Field.\n\nYou need to hurry and figure this out!\n\nClue 3\n\nDoctors confirm that the other workers just had a bad virus, but Jorge seems to have something worse. Ten of the workers are feeling better on July 20, and have returned to work.\n\nJorge, however, has gotten worse: one of his eyelids is drooping, he hasn't been able to move his right arm for days, and he's had so much trouble breathing that he's been put on a breathing tube. On July 21, which is 10 days after he first felt sick, he slips into a coma. His symptoms suggest it's something affecting his nerves and brain.\n\nCases\n\nBased on his symptoms, Jorge's doctors now think that he could have rabies, which is almost always caused by the bite of a rabid animal. There's a small scar on one of his shoulders that could be a bite mark. The doctors run some tests to confirm their suspicion, and you send the lab work to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) headquarters in Atlanta to analyze.\n\nYou also talk to a worker named Eduardo, who is from the same town in Guatemala as Jorge. He tells you that they left their town together on July 2, riding buses and trains through Guatemala and Mexico for 4 days. They spent the night in a small town in Texas and made it to the plantation on July 8.\n\nHe doesn't remember Jorge saying he'd been bitten by any animals, but he does tell you that there were a lot of stray dogs near the field where they were working.\n\nDefinition\n\nWhat is Rabies?\n\nRabies is a virus most often spread by the bite of a rabid animal. The vast majority of rabies cases in the US happen in wild animals like raccoons, skunks, bats, and foxes.\n\nThe rabies virus infects the brain and nerves. People who get rabies usually have the virus in their bodies for many weeks before they show any symptoms. The early symptoms are like those of many other illnesses: fever, headache, and weakness or discomfort.\n\nOver time, more symptoms show up: confusion, hyperactivity, trouble sleeping, slight or partial paralysis, hallucinations, hypersalivation (increase in saliva), difficulty swallowing, and fear of water. Within days of these symptoms, the person dies. Because there's no cure for rabies, people who have been bitten by a potentially rabid animal, need to seek medical care immediately, before the virus can travel to their brain.\n\n3. How do you think Jorge might have caught rabies?\n\nAnswer 1: He was bitten by the dogs near the plantation fields\n\n[Incorrect]\n\nThe incubation period for rabies is usually many weeks. Jorge was feeling sick by his second day in Louisiana, so he couldn't have caught it from anything at the plantation.\n\nHe likely was bitten by something back home in Guatemala, long before he traveled to the US.\n\nBut how do you make sure no one else gets rabies? Keep going!\n\nAnswer 2: He was bitten by something during his travels\n\n[Incorrect]\n\nSorry, but the incubation period for rabies is usually many weeks. Jorge was feeling sick by his second day in Louisiana, so he couldn't have caught it from anything during his travels that week.\n\nHe likely was bitten by something back home in Guatemala, long before he traveled north.\n\nBut how do you make sure no one else gets rabies? Keep going!\n\nAnswer 3: He was bitten by something before traveling\n\n[Correct]\n\nThat's right. We still don't know exactly how Jorge got rabies, but we do know that the virus is usually inside an infected person for many weeks before he or she has any symptoms. That means Jorge couldn't have gotten it from something in the US.\n\nHe likely was bitten by something back home in Guatemala, long before he traveled north.\n\nBut how do you make sure no one else gets rabies? Keep going!\n\nClue 4\n\nThe test results confirm that Jorge has rabies. When you call Jorge's mother in Guatemala, she tells you that he had been bitten by a vampire bat in May. A growing number of people in her town have been getting rabies, she says. Because Jorge's symptoms are so far along, unfortunately, there's little doctors can do to save him. On July 26, he dies in the hospital.\n\nThe key to preventing rabies after someone has been bitten is to give a series of shots called post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) before the person has any symptoms. That means you have another big decision to make.\n\nCases\n\nThere could be more infected people who aren't showing any symptoms yet. Because rabies is a fatal illness, anyone who might be at risk should get the PEP shots as soon as possible.\n\nYou know that Jorge traveled for days with Eduardo, lived in an apartment with 3 other people, and worked in the fields with other workers. He even shared his water bottle with some of them. You need to make sure none of these people get sick.\n\nHealth Tips\n\nHow to prevent rabies:\n\nTake your pet dogs and cats to the veterinarian regularly and keep them up-to-date on rabies vaccinations.\n\nMaintain control of your pets: keep cats indoors, and keep your eye on dogs.\n\nSpay or neuter your pets to help reduce the number of stray, unvaccinated animals.\n\nCall animal control to remove all stray animals from your neighborhood, since they may be unvaccinated or ill.\n\nChildren are often at greatest risk from rabies, since they're more likely to be bitten by dogs. Keep them away from wild or unfamiliar animals.\n\nBe especially careful around animals when traveling to other countries, as they don't always have access to PEP.\n\n4. To make sure no one else gets rabies, who should you give PEP shots to?\n\nAnswer 1: Everyone who traveled with and worked with Jorge\n\n[Incorrect]\n\nThere's no need to go overboard.\n\nScientists have proven that rabies can be transmitted through a sick person's saliva, for that reason you investigate further and find out the risk of exposure. As rabies is such a dangerous disease, you should give the PEP shots to the workers who shared Jorge's water bottle. You should also give it to health care workers who may have been exposed to some of Jorge's bodily fluids such as tears.\n\nYour work's not done yet. You need to head south!\n\nAnswer 2: The workers who shared Jorge's water bottle\n\n[Correct]\n\nThat's right. Scientists have proven that rabies can be spread through a sick person's saliva.\n\nYou investigate further and find out the risk of exposure. As rabies is such a dangerous disease, you should give the PEP shots to the workers who shared Jorge's water bottle. You should also give it to health care workers who may have been exposed to some of Jorge's bodily fluids such as tears.\n\nYour work's not done yet. You need to head south!\n\nAnswer 3: Neither. People don't spread rabies; animals do\n\n[Incorrect]\n\nNot quite. It's true that there have been no documented cases of one person spreading rabies to another person, except for some instances involving transplanted organs and tissues. But scientists have proven that rabies can be spread through a sick person's saliva.\n\nYou investigate further and find out the risk of exposure. As rabies is such a dangerous disease, you should give the PEP shots to the workers who shared Jorge's water bottle. You should also give it to health care workers who may have been exposed to some of Jorge's bodily fluids such as tears.\n\nYour work's not done yet. You need to head south!\n\nClue 5\n\nAs you work with health authorities in Guatemala, you learn that Jorge's mother was right: 11 people in his town have come down with rabies in the last 2 years. That's odd, because there had never been any cases in this town before.\n\nThe Guatemalan health department invites you to come down and investigate. This is a small village in the mountains, and it's only had electricity for about 2 years. Many of the cows and donkeys on local farms have bat bites, and so do some dogs.\n\nNotes\n\nYou study where the vampire bats live and which farm animals have been bitten. You also notice that though the village recently added electric lights down its small roads, people still don't have electricity in their homes. Vampire bats prefer to feed in darkness.\n\nIt's possible that the new lights have disturbed the bats' usual patterns, which is why they've started coming to this town. Since the houses are still dark, the bats are flying in and biting people while they sleep.\n\n5. Which of the following should you do?\n\nAnswer 1: Encourage people to bat-proof their homes by closing gaps in the roofs\n\n[Correct]\n\nThat's right! The best way to prevent rabies is to avoid contact with rabid animals. Since bats have been getting into people's homes at night, you should help them find ways to seal openings into the house.\n\nYou were right not to try to kill the local bats, as there's no scientific reason to do this. In fact, because of rabies' long incubation period, most of the bats that were infected have probably already died by now. This means the ones that are still alive have some immunity to rabies. If you killed them off, they'd only be replaced by a new population of bats that would be more likely to get rabies. That's the last thing you want.\n\nAnd giving PEP shots to every single person in the entire village is a bit too much.\n\nCongratulations, you solved the outbreak!\n\nAnswer 2: Offer PEP shots to everyone in the village\n\n[Incorrect]\n\nNope. Giving PEP shots to every single person in the entire village is a bit too much. Certainly anyone who's been bitten by a vampire bat should get one, and so should anyone who's come into contact with saliva or other body fluids from a rabid animal or a vampire bat. But that's it.\n\nWhat you should really do is encourage people to fill any holes in the roofs or walls of their homes to prevent bats from getting in.\n\nYour hard work helped solve the outbreak!\n\nAnswer 3: Try to control the bat population by applying poison in their caves\n\n[Incorrect]\n\nThere's no scientific reason to try to kill the local bats. In fact, because of rabies' long incubation period, most of the bats that were infected have probably already died by now. This means the ones that are still alive have some immunity to rabies. If you killed them off, they'd only be replaced by a new population of bats that would be more likely to get rabies. That's the last thing you want.\n\nWhat you should do is encourage people to fill any holes in the roofs or walls of their homes to prevent bats from getting in.\n\nYour hard work helped solve the outbreak!\n\nLearn More\n\nYour hard work helped to solve the outbreak!\n\nAlthough this scenario was not real, it's based on some recent incidents. A young man in Louisiana died from rabies after being bitten weeks earlier by a vampire bat in Mexico. It was the first time someone in the US died from rabies after a vampire bat bite. And it's unlikely to be the last, as vampire bats have been moving north.\n\nIn the real outbreak, CDC workers traveled to the worker's home town in Mexico. Because cats and dogs in the town were frequently bitten by vampire bats, health workers from the US and Mexico vaccinated dogs and cats to protect them. Local health workers also took steps to control the vampire bat population.\n\nIn another recent case, CDC workers traveled to a village in Peru, deep in the Amazon jungle. The town had never had a rabies case before, but suddenly many people were getting rabies. CDC investigators believe that new electric lights had altered the bats' behavior, and CDC worked with local authorities and the villagers to stop the outbreak.\n\nRabies is a killer. If you're ever bitten by an animal, see a doctor immediately.\n\nNote: Several aspects of the original outbreaks and investigations have been altered to fit the format and length of this application.\n\nBack To Top\n\nHiding in Plain Sight\n\nNumber Sick: 1128\n\nHospitalizations: 357\n\nDeaths: 290\n\nLocation: US (10 States)\n\nYour Mission:\n\nYou might not be able to trust your own eyes on this next outbreak.\n\nIt begins with a surprising increase in a rare eye condition. At least, it's supposed to be rare, but it seems to be becoming a lot more common!\n\nA number of people are being infected by a tiny ameba (single-celled living organism) that's causing permanent eye damage. Dozens of people in these states need transplants of their cornea (the transparent, outermost layer of the eye), and many are going blind!\n\nWe need your help to solve the outbreak!\n\nClue 1\n\nDr. Lee is an ophthalmologist (eye doctor) in Athens, Georgia. He recently noticed that more of his patients were getting a rare disease called Acanthamoeba keratitis (known as \"AK\"). There wasn't a sudden rise in the number of cases; in fact, the increase was so gradual that he only realized it after several years.\n\nHe calls the Georgia Department of Public Health, and it turns out he isn't the only doctor suspecting an increase. Three other doctors have recently called about the same thing. The Department then calls the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and asks you to figure out what's going on, and fast!\n\nData\n\nSoon after the call from Georgia, New York's Department of Public Health calls you about the same thing. It's strange that two states nearly 1,000 miles from each other could have the same problem. You wonder if AK is increasing around the country, or if this is a false alarm. It's possible that a few doctors just happen to have sicker patients than other doctors.\n\nYou decide to gather 6 years of medical records from a sample of eye doctors in Georgia, New York, and 3 other states across the country to see if AK really is becoming more common.\n\nDefinition\n\nWhat is Acanthamoeba keratitis?\n\nAcanthamoeba is a microscopic ameba (\"amoeba\" is the British spelling) that can cause rare but severe infections of the eye, skin, brain, and spinal cord.\n\nOne of the diseases it causes is Acanthamoeba keratitis (AK), an infection of the eye that causes eye pain, redness, sensitivity to light, and the feeling that something is stuck in your eye. AK can permanently damage your vision or cause blindness.\n\nThe ameba is found around the world in soil and dust, as well as in water. It lives in the ocean and freshwater lakes and rivers. It can also be found in swimming pools, hot tubs, and drinking water. Most people will be exposed to it during their lifetime, but very few will become sick from it.\n\n1. Based on the data, is the problem getting worse, getting better, or neither?\n\nAnswer 1: Getting worse\n\n[Correct]\n\nThe problem seems to be getting worse. Although some states have seen more cases than others, the data shows you that there have been more cases each year in each state for at least 6 strai"
