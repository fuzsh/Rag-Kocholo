        "text": "Whether you’re looking for high-performance athletic footwear or casual, everyday kicks, it’s important to wear well-fitting shoes that comfortably support your feet. Shoes that don’t fit properly can leave your feet feeling uncomfortable, achey or blistered. And unfortunately, wearing the wrong size shoe is more common than you might think.\n\nA 2018 study from the Journal of Foot and Ankle Research found that up to two-thirds of people may be wearing shoes that fit improperly, and that wearing the wrong size is associated with foot pain and poorer foot health overall.\n\nSo, how do you know if you’re wearing the right shoe size? Finding the correct shoe size starts with accurately measuring your feet. Read on to learn how to measure your foot size and how to find your shoe size in Nike footwear. Plus, check out additional tips for picking out comfortable, supportive shoes that meet your needs.\n\n(Related: 8 Ideas for Storing Shoes)\n\nNow that you’ve measured your foot size, compare the measurements against a Nike size chart to find the best shoe size for you.\n\nWhile other shoe brands may use similar size scales, it’s best to check out a shoe brand’s size charts before purchasing a new pair of shoes from them, as each brand’s exact approach to size and fit may vary.\n\nWhen a shoe fits correctly, you should be able to perform your desired movement — be it walking, running or playing a sport — with comfort and confidence in your feet. That said, there are a handful of telltale signs to look out for if you suspect you’re wearing wrong shoe size, including:\n\nThe toe box is too tight. If a shoe is too small, you might experience pinching or irritation on the edge of your big toe or pinky toe.\n\nYour heels or ankles feel irritated. If a shoe collar is too high, for example, you might experience redness or blisters on your ankle bone (indicating a too-large fit).\n\nThe shoe’s arch is in the wrong place. If the shoe is too big, the arch might land too close to your heel. In a shoe too small, it might land too close to the ball of your foot.\n\nYour heel slips out while walking. In a shoe that is too big, this might happen even when the laces are tied tight.\n\nTip: When trying on a pair of Nike shoes to assess the fit, be sure to mimic whatever movement you intend to perform in them. For example, if you’re shopping for running shoes, consider testing how they feel by taking a quick jog around the block while wearing them. If you’d like expert tips and advice from a Nike teammate, head to your local Nike store to try on different styles in person.\n\nUsing the measurement tools in this guide is a great way to determine the right shoe size, but it’s important to note that different shoes have different designs and purposes, which may impact the way two different shoes feel on your feet, even if they are the same size.\n\nThere are a handful of factors that can affect the way a shoe feels on your feet:\n\nThe shoe’s last and overall structure. A last is the footform that a shoe is built on, and different shoes (including different Nike shoes) are made with different lasts. For example, a Mercurial soccer cleat is made with a different last than a pair of Air Force 1s. While Nike soccer cleats are designed to fit true to size, they serve a different purpose than a lifestyle shoe, for example, so they are likely to feel different than an Air Force 1 on-foot. Many soccer players, especially elite-level athletes, choose to size down in their soccer cleats so they can feel a more sensitive touch on the ball.\n\n(Related: How Should Soccer Cleats Fit?)\n\nMaterial. Some fabrics will have more stretch and softness than others. For example, leather might feel softer and more pliable than certain synthetic materials.\n\nThe closure system. A shoe with laces may allow you to loosen or tighten the fit for a more personalized feel, while a slip-on shoe will have less adjustability.\n\nThe intended purpose of the shoe. For athletic performance, you may want a soccer, football or baseball cleat to provide a snug, tight fit. Meanwhile, you may want a slightly roomier fit, with more wiggle room in the toe box, for an everyday shoe.\n\nMeasurements aside, shoe fit is subjective. It’s normal for preferences to vary from person to person. You may prefer extra roominess or tightness in your footwear, depending on how you like the shoe to feel. Your best bet: Use your foot measurements as a guide, but be sure to try on several pairs to find what feels most comfortable on your feet."
