        "text": "Today is the day that you’re finally going to stop sacrificing your mental, emotional, and physical health for your family members. I know, it’s extremely hard, and you’ve probably tried already to no avail (that’s why you’re here, right?).\n\nI used to be awful at setting boundaries until I finally got professional help from a therapist. The knowledge I’ve gained has allowed me to fix a relationship with a family member that I haven’t talked to in two years. It’s amazing how so many things in our lives can flourish when we change our approach. Since therapy can be costly, here’s some free therapy for you — the knowledge that I have gained is priceless and I know that it’ll help you, too!\n\nSetting boundaries with family members is usually hard for several reasons:\n\nYou love your family and you don’t want to ruin your relationships with them\n\nIn your familial structure, standing up for yourself is seen as rude or disrespectful, and the point doesn’t get across\n\nYou feel awkward or weird about setting boundaries because you’ve never given yourself a voice\n\nThe person who is overstepping your boundaries needs your help (suicidal, has a drug-addiction, depressed, etc.)\n\nDynamics of power make it hard to speak up for yourself (Ex. Your parents constantly over step your boundaries, but you live with them so you deal with it)\n\nThe Science of Setting Boundaries\n\nYes, it’s a science! You can’t go into boundary setting without some purposeful thought and planning. Most attempts at boundary setting fail because people go into it without any real rhyme or reason, and this ends up making issues worse.\n\nPeople always say: “You have to set boundaries! It’s the only way to preserve your mental energy!” and that’s great thing to say, but it’s practically useless if you don’t know how to set them, or even what they are.\n\nSo, What Is a Boundary?\n\nThink of a boundary as an imaginary line that separates your emotions, needs, and feelings from others. Your boundaries are a way of telling people “Hey! This is how you can treat me, and this is how you can not treat me”. If you don’t set boundaries, people can easily take advantage of you.\n\nSo it seems like boundary setting is going to take some introspection.\n\nIt is soooo important to get to know yourself the best you can. Learn what you really value, learn what truly makes you happy, and learn what makes you upset. The better you know who you are, the better you can understand what you will and will not endure. If you’re not sure where to start, there are five personal rights that you are entitled to no matter what:\n\nYou have a right to be treated with the utmost respect\n\nYou have the right to say no to your family without feeling guilty and without any remorse (we’ll come back to this later)\n\nYou have the right to put yourself and your needs before the needs of other people\n\nYou have a right to not adjust yourself to someone’s (often unreasonable) expectation of you\n\nHow Do I Know When a Boundary Has Been Crossed?\n\nOur bodies are so wonderful, and they constantly give us a ton of information that we don’t even listen to! Our body reactions are very good indicators of how we feel about a person, situation, or relationship.\n\nWhen you’re interacting with someone, really try to focus on what your body is doing in that moment. Are you relaxed and happy interacting with them, or are you tense? Are you sweating? Is your throat or chest tight? Do you feel like you’re gonna cry, or punch a wall? Do you have anxiety or panic?\n\nOften times, we ignore these important cues because we want to please other people, or make sure things don’t blow up. However, when we ignore our bodies, they fight back by making us feel awful. Listen to your body and set those boundaries!\n\nBoundary Setting Template\n\nWhen you set boundaries, you need to be assertive without being rude. That seems really hard, but let me tell you why its necessary: If you are too aggressive, and frame your boundary as an attack, people are more likely to go into defense mode.\n\nAssertive language is clear and firm without blaming or threatening the person on the other end of it. People are more likely to listen to how they’ve made you feel, instead of how their actions were wrong (even if they were wrong). So if you really want a person to listen, avoid going into attack mode.\n\nWell, what does that look like?\n\n“I feel threatened/unsafe/disrespected when you_____, therefore, what I need is______.”\n\nWhen you phrase your concerns in this way, you are confident and unwavering in what you are requesting. You are not attacking them, but you aren’t absolving them of responsibility either. Let’s take a look at an example:\n\nThe productive statement works because, essentially, there is no argument. You’ve expressed how you feel, and you’ve expressed what you need because of it.\n\nHowever, with the unproductive statement, you invite comments like:\n\n“I am listening to you!”\n\n“No, I actually don’t think I’m right all the time!”\n\n“I don’t always yell at you! I listen, too!”\n\nYou see how that gets us nowhere? The unproductive statement is extremely tempting when you’re angry in the moment; but don’t do it. It’s not worth it, and it just throws gasoline on the fire. Just step back, breathe, and think.\n\nDon’t Be Afraid Of No!\n\nIf you’re here on this article, chances are it’s hard for you to say no, especially to your family. One of the most important things I want you to take away from this article is that No is a complete sentence. You are not obligated to explain your no. No is just no, always. We might be hesitant to say no without giving an explanation why, but it isn’t necessary.\n\nStrong “no’s” make people uncomfortable, and honestly, you might ruffle some feathers if you give a blatant no. This does not mean that you did anything wrong. All it means is that the person on the receiving end has a problem with you having autonomy.\n\nNow, I know what you may be thinking:\n\nYou’ve got to be crazy if you think I can just say “no” to my parents or family members without them thinking I’m being disrespectful! We just don’t do that in my family!\n\nThat’s the problem.\n\nA culture of silence garners more silence.\n\nAs a Black woman, I know this dynamic all too well. Here’s the thing: we aren’t saying no for no reason. We are saying no because we are protecting our mental, physical, and emotional health. It’s not like you’re refusing to wash the dishes or mow the lawn- someone is hurting you, and that’s unacceptable.\n\nWhen you are a child, your parents and family members are the village that helps raise you. However, when you become an adult, you have your own sets of beliefs, value systems, and comfortability levels. If you don’t set any boundaries with your family, they will never fully respect that fact. Setting boundaries lets your family know that you are not just a daughter, or a nephew, or a cousin….you are a human who has limits.\n\nSo if your brother asks you to bail him out of jail for the fourth time (But who’s going to bail him out if I don’t?), you can say no. If your alcoholic father asks you to buy him just one bottle (He said please!), you can say no. If your cousin asks to borrow $20 again (She promised she would pay it back!) you can say no. You can absolutely just say no. You can even sprinkle a little “no, sorry” in the mix, if you’re feeling fancy. But no is no.\n\nI know I keep emphasizing this, but family can be some of the hardest people to say no to because you love them and you feel obligated to help them. Guilt can be very taxing on your conscience. Despite what that voice in your head might be telling you, you are not a terrible person for protecting your peace!\n\nSetting Consequences For Your Boundaries\n\nWhen you set a boundary, some family members will immediately respect it— and others won’t. There are 2 types of people that won’t — I like to call them Controllers and Manipulators.\n\nControllers will blow straight through your boundaries, without hesitation, and might even make you feel bad for setting them (“This is crazy! I’m your mother and you’re going to do what I tell you to do!”). These people want control and power over you, even if they don’t consciously know it. They tend to be angry and frustrated when you assert yourself.\n\nManipulators try to manipulate you out of your boundaries, or attempt to explain why they can’t honor them (“Oh, but I don’t mean it that way!” “I’m saying/doing this to you because I care about you!” “But if you don’t help me, I’ll be out here by myself!”). These people will try to rationalize why they have to cross your boundaries; don’t let them!\n\nThe good thing is that both Controllers and Manipulators can be defeated in the same way; through setting consequences. If your boundaries lack consequences, people won’t respect them. They’ll be convinced that no matter what they do, you won’t do anything about it but complain to them. So, here are some examples of consequences that you can set when a person insists on not honoring your boundaries:\n\nWhen people flake on you\n\n“If we make plans and you keep cancelling last minute or not showing up, I will stop making plans with you.”\n\nWhen people wont stop doing a certain thing\n\n“If you keep (doing a certain behavior you don’t like), I will leave the room/house.” (If they are in your house, you can ask them to leave).\n\nVerbal violations\n\n“ We can have a civil conversation, but I feel disrespected when you yell at me. I am going into the other room until you can get your point across without yelling.”\n\nDealing with family members who have drug and alcohol dependencies\n\n“When you drink, you become someone that I don’t want to be around. I will not be around you when you drink.”\n\n“I need to be in a drug-free environment. As long as you don’t get help for your addiction, I won’t be seeing you/ you can’t come over.”\n\nDealing with family members who comment on your sexuality, gender identity, or other core identity markers\n\n“I am who I am, and this is something that can not be changed. If you refuse to accept me for who I am, or continue to make harsh comments, I will not be around you/ I can not sustain a relationship with you.”\n\nWhen family members comment on your physical appearance\n\nNote: This subject can be touchy. This section is assuming that your family member is using shaming language or a harsh tone that is unacceptable when talking to you about these issues. Use this at your own discretion, every situation is different.\n\n“When you comment on my weight/size/shape/hair etc, I don’t find it helpful at all. I feel like you are putting me down, even if you’re well meaning. If you can’t frame your comments in a way that is helpful, I will stop coming around.” (This can be harder if you live with the person making these comments. If that is the case, the consequence can be that you will stop listening to them or confiding in them).\n\nMaintaining boundaries\n\nKnow that your boundaries are flexible and can differ between different people, and that’s perfectly fine. Boundaries depend on the situation and the person, so don’t feel bad for having many different types of boundaries! You don’t want to isolate yourself from all of your family and avoid closeness, but you don’t want to give up all of your time and emotional energy to other people either. Be nice to yourself and allow yourself to figure this all out.\n\nBut what if setting boundaries causes my relationships to be awkward, or non-existent?\n\nThis is going to be hard, especially when you’re dealing with your family members, but I’m going to go ahead and say it: after you’ve set a boundary, people who care about you will adapt and make an effort to change. If they don’t, it is absolutely possible that they will leave once they notice that you are not doing what they want you to do.\n\nWhen you begin to set boundaries, it might take some time for people to adjust to this new version of you. This can be hard but trust me, if the relationship was meant to work out, the person will put in the effort. Relationships that are overly sacrificial quickly and easily turn into exploitation and hurt feelings, so just remember; people can get mad, kick, scream, and yell, but don’t you dare think about adjusting your boundaries to please someone else! This process isn’t easy, but I believe in you!\n\nLast Note: Many of the violations described in this article could be indicators of abuse. Of course, every difficult situation you have with someone is not abuse, but if you feel like your problem is too large for boundary setting to fix, here are some resources for you:\n\nNational Domestic Violence Hotline- Many people think that domestic violence is just between dating partners, but it can be between family members, too. In addition to having a number to call and a live chatbox, this site has several resources for people on all ends of all spectrums.\n\nBetterhelp.com- GREAT source for online therapy with many different races, ethnicities, genders, and sexualities of therapists. Also has discounts based on income.\n\nNational Sexual Assault Hotline- Because, yes, it can even happen with family members. This site also has a number you can call and a live chatbox.\n\nAll of these resources are in English and Spanish. Best Wishes!"
