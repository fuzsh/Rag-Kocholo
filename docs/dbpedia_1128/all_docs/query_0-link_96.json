The event will be the only FIM Hard Enduro World Championship race in North America this season and it will also serve as the seventh and final round of the AMA US Hard Enduro Championship.\n\nOne of the unique features of the TKO is that the top pro Hard Enduro racers from around the world as well as the top riders in other off-road disciplines earn an invitation that gets a free entry into pro class. The top 35 finishers from the 2023 TKO automatically make that list as well. Past TKO main event qualifiers also earn an invitation. A total of 120 riders have earned a spot on the Sunday prequalified list and 35 of those riders are expected to compete.\n\nThe 2024 TKO will attract the top international riders such as Mani Lettenbichler, Mario Roman, Wade Young and Teodor Kabakchiev from the FIM championship who will take on the top North American riders including Trystan Hart, Cody Webb, Ryder LeBlond and Will Riordan.\n\nLettenbichler has dominated the FIM Hard Enduro championship for the past two years, but Hart has managed to beat him at the last two TKO events, so we can expect an epic battle for TKO supremacy between those two.\n\nAnd don’t count out six-time TKO winner Cody Webb for the win. The FactoryONE Sherco rider is having a great season and currently leads the AMA US Hard Enduro Championship series.\n\nGraham Jarvis has also added his name to the list of pro riders planning to compete at the TKO in 2024.\n\nTop 120 2024 Red Bull Tennessee Knockout Prequalified Pro Riders\n\n1.

So they had a lot to talk about!\n\nYou can listen to the episode on AHE’s Spotify show here or wherever you get your podcasts.\n\nOr you can view the episode on the AHE’s YouTube channel here:\n\nAmateur pre-qualification process updated for 2024 Red Bull Tennessee Knockout; Learn how racers pre-qualify for Saturday race two\n\nThe fourteenth annual Red Bull Tennessee Knockout will serve as the final round of the AMA US Hard Enduro Championship and the AMA Grand Championship for Extreme Enduro. The event is open to up to 500 amateur riders and will include three rounds of amateur class competition with some riders pre-qualifying for the championship deciding Saturday race two.\n\nThe TKO amateur racing format includes a Friday Hot-Lap and two races on Saturday. The morning race is a qualifier race to get into the championship deciding race two. All amateur class riders need to compete in the Hot-Lap to earn a starting position for either Saturday race one or Saturday race two for those that are already pre-qualified. Top amateur riders can earn a spot directly into the Saturday race two by meeting one of the following criteria:\n\nRiders ranked in the top ten in the AMA US Hard Enduro championship points, excluding C class and Youth class (Premier, East and West) for the 2024 series leading into the TKO.\n\nRiders that finished in the top 50 overall amateur at the 2022 or 2023 TKO Saturday race two. Riders that finished in the top three in class (excluding the C class) in the 2023 TKO Saturday race two will also be eligible to go directly to the 2024 TKO Saturday race two.\n\nRiders that are not pre-qualified for race two that finish in the top 50 overall during the Friday amateur Hot-Lap will also be qualified directly for Saturday race 2.\n\nThe goal of the qualification process is to allow the top riders to earn their way directly into Saturday race two. Any riders that don’t prequalify will compete in the Saturday morning race where up to 200 riders that finish the course within the 2.5-hour time limit will also move forward to compete in the Saturday race two, which serves as the amateur class championship race.\n\nThe top 30 overall amateur finishers from the Saturday race two will also be invited to compete with the top Hard Enduro racers from round the world starting with a Saturday afternoon Hot-Lap and three round Sunday competition.\n\nThe list of amateur riders that have already pre-qualified for Saturday race two is here.\n\nAmateur racers can read the complete supplemental rules and get the latest event schedule here.\n\nThe ECR eMoto (electric motorcycle) class will also be back for the third year with an AMA Grand Championship on the line. The eMoto class will share the course with the other classes but be scored separate from the gas-powered amateur classes. ECR eMoto Class rules can be found here.\n\nThe free electric motorcycle demo rides, sponsored by Surron, will be back again in 2024 and open to anybody that wants to give one of the bikes from multiple brands, including Surron and Electric Motion a test ride.\n\nTo kick off the weekend, the top sixteen pro riders will compete in a head-to-head prologue on a man-made straight rhythm inspired enduro course in downtown Nashville on Thursday, August 22nd.

Kenda is a popular choice among TKO racers and the brand will be back again for the fourteenth annual TKO in 2024 with tire service for racers and some of the Ohio-based engineers competing in the races.\n\n“Our partnership with the Tennessee Knockout dates back to Kenda’s development of some of the first Hard Enduro specific tires on the market. While it’s a more crowded field these days, it’s fulfilling to see both the discipline and our product line continue to grow,” said David Komoroski, Director of Powersports at Kenda. “A handful of our Ohio-based engineers will ride the TKO again this year and are excited to compete on the same course as some of the best riders in the world.”\n\nYou can learn more about Kenda tires here.\n\nThe 2024 TKO will serve as round five of the FIM Hard Enduro World Championship and the seventh and final round of the AMA US Hard Enduro Championship. So the top international riders such as Mani Lettenbichler, Mario Roman, Wade Young and Teodor Kabakchiev will take on the top North American riders including Trystan Hart, Cody Webb, Ryder LeBlond and Will Riordan. Lettenbichler has dominated the FIM Hard Enduro championship for the past two years, but Hart has managed to beat him at the last two TKO events, so we can expect an epic battle for TKO supremacy between those two.\n\nIn addition to the top pro riders, up to five hundred amateur riders will take on the TKO course aiming for the AMA Grand Championship titles and class wins.
