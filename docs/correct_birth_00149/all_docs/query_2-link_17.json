        "text": "Robin McLaurin Williams (1951-2014) Was an North-American Actor and Comedian, Robin was famous for his usually lightly-hearted comedy Movies. He was also known for his improvisation skills, being sometimes called the funniest person of all time.\n\nBiography[]\n\nWilliams was born in Chicago, Illinois. His mother Laura Smith (1922-2001) was a former model of New Orleans, Louisiana. His father, Robert Fitzgerald Williams (1906-1987), was a senior executive of the automotive company Ford, in charge of the Midwest region. Williams is descended of English, Welsh, and Irish by the side of its father, and of French by the maternal side. He grew up frequenting the Episcopal Church, although his mother practiced Christian Science. He grew up in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, where he attended Detroit Country Day School, and Woodacre, Marin County, California, where he attended a public school, Redwood High School. He also attended Claremont McKenna College (then called Claremont Men's College) for four years. He has two half-brothers: Todd (killed on August 14, 2007) and McLaurin.\n\nWilliams described himself as a quiet child, whose first imitation was that of his grandmother, made for her mother. He was not able to overcome his shyness until getting involved with the dramaturgy department, during high school.\n\nIn 1973, Williams was one of twenty students to be accepted as freshmen in the renowned Juilliard School, and one of only two to be accepted by John Houseman in the advanced program of that school that year (the other one was Christopher Reeve). In his dialect classes, Williams had no problem in quickly mastering all the dialects he taught. He left Juilliard in 1976.\n\nWilliams died on August 11, 2014, at age 63, for suicide. His body was cremated and his ashes were thrown in San Francisco Bay.\n\nGaming[]\n\nRobin William was also a game addict, to the point of naming his daughter Zelda as an Homage to the Legend of Zelda series.\n\nRobin also played Quake sometime during 1997 to 1998 from his house online, being an close friend of John Carmack ,Trent Reznor ,John Romero Conan'O Brien and fellow users in the online IRC communities. After going through a 12 Step progam, Robin quit playing Quake due to time constraints."
