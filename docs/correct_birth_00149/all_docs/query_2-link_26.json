        "text": "Robin Williams\n\nBoth children and adults loved American actor and comedian Robin Williams for his odd expressions, charming awkwardness, and innocent yet funny dialogues. Robin Williams made not just America but the entire world laughs at his delightful antics. Williams was a gifted individual who, despite being better known as a comic, could play a very serious role with the same ease as he could a funny one.\n\nHe was nominated for the prestigious Academy Awards three times, yet he only managed to take home one for his highly praised performance in \"Good Will Hunting.\" Being the son of a top executive, the young Robin's career in show business appeared unlikely. When he was a little boy, he constantly made others laugh at school, earning him the title of \"Funniest,\" without a doubt. His first role was as a stand-up comedian, and he was successful in it. As a result of a series of events, he soon appeared in television comedy shows. He realized that he was set for tremendous success due to his success in the classic comedy \"Mork & Mindy.\" He entered the movie industry. As a result, becoming a famous comedian.\n\nEarly Life of Robin Williams\n\nChicago, Illinois, was the birthplace of Robin Williams on July 21st, 1951. A prominent family raised Williams. Lauren, his mother, was a former model from New Orleans, and Robert, his father, was a senior executive at Lincoln-Mercury Motors in charge of the Midwest division. Robin's family moved to the San Francisco Bay Area before he attended high school. When Robin was younger, he was very quiet. One of the few early predictions that he would become a comedian was his excellent version of his grandmother. Beyond that, he started opening up in earnest when he began performing in high school plays.\n\nEducation\n\nRobin studied at the College of Marin in Kentfield after graduating from Redwood High School in Larkspur, California. He afterward studied at New York City's famous Julliard School. In this location, Robin would first meet his lifelong friend and future Super Man actor, Christopher Reeve. Robin was encouraged by a teacher at Julliard to switch his focus from stand-up comedy to acting. Williams started performing in New York's comedy clubs after considering that advice. His wild actions and quick one-liners rapidly won the hearts of the audience.\n\nCareer\n\nIn the 1970s, he started his career performing stand-up comedy. In late 1977, he had the first tv appearance of one of his stand-up acts. Despite the laugh-fail, sometimes it is evident that it assisted him in getting attention for his talent. When he played at the Comedy Club in Los Angeles in 1977, T.V. producer George Schlatter saw him and invited him to participate in a brand-new edition of his \"Laugh-In\" program.\n\nIn 1979, he gave a live comedy show at the Copacabana in New York called \"Reality... What a Concept,\" for which he got a Grammy. A string of further roles quickly followed, and in 1984 he was cast as Vladimir Ivanoff in the comedy-drama \"Moscow on the Hudson,\" for which he was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor. His role was loosely based on radio DJ Adrian Cronauer in the military comedy film \"Good Morning, Vietnam\" from 1987.\n\nHe appeared in the drama movie \"Dead Poets Society\" in 1989, which told the tale of an English teacher at a traditional school who inspires his pupils by teaching them poetry. The film was a big success. Mr. Doubtfire, a 1993 comedy in which he portrays a guy who dresses as a woman to be near the kids he shares with his ex-wife, is one of his most well-known comedies.\n\nHe appeared in films including \"License to Wed\" (2007), \"One Hour Photo\" (2002), \"Robots\" (2005), and \"Old Dogs\" as he continued to enjoy success in his career well into the new millennium (2009). He was granted the chance to act in the amazing movie \"Good Will Hunting\" in 1997, in which he plays the role of a therapist who offers advice to a disturbed but smart young man. For the movie, he won multiple awards.\n\nRobin Williams' Net Worth\n\nAmerican comedian and actor Robin Williams had a $50 million US dollar fortune at the time of his passing. Robin received a $20 million salary for the 1999 film \"Bicentennial Man,\" which was the highest single payment he has ever received. Robin received the Screen Actors Guild minimum wage of $75,000 for his voice performance in the Disney film Aladdin. Robin decided to accept the low pay under two restrictions:\n\nHis character could not be used to advertise products to children, and\n\nHe could not appear in more than 25% of the movie's advertisements.\n\nDisney later broke both promises, leading Robin to avoid working with them for a long time.\n\nTop 20 Robin Williams Movies List:\n\n1. Popeye, 1980\n\nWilliams' first film role, Popeye, allowed him to show his extreme comedic talent and funny side right away. Williams portrays Popeye, the well-known sailor character who usually mocks and looks for his father, who has been missing for a long time. We follow his and his friends' adventures in the small seaside town of Sweet haven.\n\n2. The Survivors, 1983\n\nThis crime drama follows the friendship between two strangers who lose their jobs. When Sonny and Donald attempt to stop a robber from robbing a bar, they transform from two hopeless men into local heroes, and their lives are forever changed.\n\n3. Moscow on the Hudson, 1984\n\nWilliams represents a Russian saxophonist who travels to New York with a circus company and decides to relocate to the United States rather than continue living in the USSR. We follow his journey to fulfill his American aspirations and succeed in the music industry. He finds himself in Bloomingdales, makes a new friend in a black security officer, and develops feelings for an Italian immigrant.\n\n4. Good Morning, Vietnam, 1987\n\nThis wonderful and heartbreaking biographical film directed by Robin Williams is about a disc jockey that travels from Crete to Vietnam to offer joy and comedy to Armed Forces Radio. However, the management disapproves of him since they feel he is not enough of a G.I.\n\n5. Cadillac Man, 1990\n\nJoey, a car salesman, has two days to sell 12 cars to maintain his career and satisfy his lover. A man with a machine gun rushes into the dealership and decides to hold everyone hostage, making the already difficult scenario even tougher for him to consider.\n\n6. The Fisher King, 1991\n\nCooperation between Gilliam and Williams resulted in one of Williams' most brilliant movies. A former radio D.J. considering suicide is the subject of this fantastic comedy-drama. After making a terrible error, he seeks forgiveness by helping a crazy homeless person who also happened to be the victim of that error.\n\n7. Hook, 1991\n\nThis Steven Spielberg family adventure, which presents a slightly altered version of the Peter Pan story, is certainly one of the kids' favorite movies. Williams represents Peter Pan as an adult forced to leave Neverland after Captain James Hook kidnaps his children. Peter will need to confront his foe and rediscover his former spirit.\n\n8. Aladdin, 1992\n\nIn one of the most well-known Disney movies ever created, a street child named Aladdin spends his days stealing food from the market in the city of Agrabah.

One Hour Photo, 2002\n\nIt is odd to see Williams as a disturbed photojournalist who becomes obsessed with an upper-middle-class family and stalks and harms them.
