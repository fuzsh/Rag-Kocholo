        "meta_description": "isadorakosofsky on May 12, 2024: \"Robin Williams lies in bed next to her mother, Bessie Williams, 98, at Bessie’s home in Los Angeles, California. In 2009, Bessie was diagnosed with mixed dementia. At the time, she was forgetting if she had eaten. Her legs were becoming numb. Her daughter helped her transition from her usual high heels to flat shoes. In 2011, after Bessie’s house caught on fire after an electrical issue, Bessie moved in with her daughter, Robin; Robin was told her mother needed 24-hour care. Robin’s life changed after assuming the role of full-time caregiver. “It altered my life because it changed my whole business,” said Robin who was self-employed and running a catering business. “In the positive way, it enabled me to be more patient,” said Robin. “I’m not in control of what’s going on. I think you’re put in a place you’re supposed to be in at a certain time. I’ve evolved.” When living at Robin’s home, Bessie kept saying, “I want to go home.” In 2015, after moving back into her home with Robin, Bessie had forgotten her house on the border of Los Angeles and Inglewood. Born in 1922, Bessie was born and raised in LA. A mother of three, she worked as a timekeeper for the City of Los Angeles. Living with dementia, Bessie struggles with anxiety when brought outside the home. She often hallucinates that people, including her deceased husband, are in her bedroom. Robin derives strength from her mother’s smile. “She may be in the condition she’s in but she still smiles,” said Robin, “She is still saying thank you.” Robin often leaves the television on in Bessie’s room, particularly the Ellen Degeneres show and Family Feud. When Bessie is anxious, Robin puts on jazz and lights a scented candle. At night, when she hears her mother speaking, Robin, who sleeps upstairs, will address her through a baby monitor to soothe her fears. Over the past decade, Bessie remained social and connected to friends despite her dementia. Throughout her life, she was known for her hospitality and participating in a “block club” of neighbors and a cohort of women named the “elegant ladies.” Bessie passed away at the age of 99. @natgeo #mothersday\".",
