        "text": "The One with the Ultimate Fighting Champion\n\nTo Monica's horror, Pete plans to be in an ultimate fight, and when he can't win but won't give up, she must decide her future with him. Chandler has a problem when his new boss is slaphappy. Phoebe sets Ross up on a date with a woman who used to be bald.\n\nAuthority\n\nWhen restaurant manager Dwight Lomax (guest star Scott Adsit, \"30 Rock\") is caught molesting a female employee, he claims that he was following orders from a \"Detective Milgram\" over the phone. As detectives Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay) and Elliot Stabler (Christopher Meloni) delve into the case, they discover \"Detective Milgram\" was a hoax by engineer Merritt Rook (guest star Robin Williams). Rook later turns his trial into a media circus by using the courtroom as a soapbox. Rook's courtroom antics set him free, and with a group of followers, detectives Benson and Stabler fall prey to another one of Rook's psychological schemes leaving the SVU department vulnerable. Also starring: Adam Beach, Dann Florek, Ice-T, Diane Neal, Tamara Tunie, Richard Belzer, and B.D. Wong."
