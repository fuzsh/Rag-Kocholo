        "text": "An Academy Award-winning actor and multiple Grammy-winning performer unparalleled in the scope of his imagination, Robin Williams continued to add to his repertoire of indelible characters.\n\nWilliams, who began his career as a stand-up comedian, wrapped his 2009 critically acclaimed, sold-out, Weapons of Self Destruction comedy tour as one of the most successful stand-up comedy tours of the year. Over the course of the tour, Williams performed 90 shows in 65 cities in front of 300,000 fans across the country, as well as in London and Canada. Since its launch in September 2008, the tour grossed an astounding $40 million. Weapons was taped over two nights at Washington, DC's DAR Constitution Hall and premiered on December 6 on HBO as the network's highest rated stand-up comedy special of the year. Well known for his free-associative monologues and for pointing out life's absurdities through his astute social and political observations, Williams' previous comedy tour was in 2002. After a 16-year absence from the stand-up scene, he hit the road and toured America with a critically acclaimed one-man show that became the highest-grossing comedy tour ever and culminated in a final performance filmed by HBO and broadcast live from New York on July 14, 2002. The special, entitled Robin Williams: Live On Broadway, was nominated for five Emmy Awards. On the big screen, Williams was recently seen starring in the dark comedy, World's Greatest Dad. The film premiered to raves at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival and Robin's performance has been touted as one of the best of his career. Bobcat Goldthwait directed the film, which was released by Magnolia Pictures at the end of August 2009.\n\nIn 1997, Williams received an Oscar and Screen Actors Guild award for his performance as 'Sean Maguire,' the therapist who counsels Matt Damon's math genius character in Gus Van Sant's Good Will Hunting. The Academy previously nominated Williams for best actor in The Fisher King, Dead Poets Society, and Good Morning Vietnam. Williams garnered a special honor from the National Board of Review for his performance opposite Robert DeNiro in Awakenings. In 2004, Williams received the prestigious Career Achievement Award from the Chicago International Film festival and, in 2005, the HFPA honored him with the Cecil B. DeMille Award for outstanding contributions to the world of entertainment.\n\nWilliams' filmography includes a number of blockbusters. In 1993, he starred in Chris Columbus' Mrs. Doubtfire. For Mike Nichols, Williams portrayed 'Armand Goldman' in The Birdcage, for which the cast won a SAG ensemble award. In 1996, both The Birdcage and Jumanji reached the $100 million mark in the USA in exactly the same week. Williams went on to assume the dual roles of Peter Pan/Peter Banning in Steven Spielberg's Hook, to play a medical student who treats patients with humor in Patch Adams and to star in Disney's Flubber. In 2006, Robin appeared opposite Ben Stiller in the hit comedy, Night at the Museum. To date, the film has earned over $250 million in the United States alone. In May 2009 he reprised his role as 'Teddy Roosevelt' in the sequel, Night at the Museum 2: Battle of the Smithsonian, which so far has earned another $400 million for the franchise worldwide. In addition, Williams' award-winning vocal talents helped propel the Warner Bros. animated film, Happy Feet, to another $200 million box office, as well as the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature Film.\n\nRobin Williams first captured the attention of the world as 'Mork from Ork' on the hit series Mork & Mindy. Born in Chicago and raised in both Michigan and California, he trained at New York's Julliard School under John Houseman. Williams made his cinematic debut as the title character in Robert Altman's Popeye. Additional early motion picture credits include Paul Mazursky's Moscow on the Hudson, in which he played a Russian musician who decides to defect, and The World According to Garp, George Roy Hill's adaptation of John Irving's acclaimed best-selling novel about a writer and his feminist mother. More recent credits include Sony Pictures' hit comedy, R.V., Barry Levinson's political comedy, Man of the Year, License to Wed, opposite John Krasinski and Mandy Moore and Old Dogs opposite John Travolta. In a departure from the usual comedic and family fare he is best known for, Williams collaborated with two accomplished young directors on dramatic thrillers. For Christopher Nolan, he starred opposite Al Pacino as reclusive novelist 'Walter Finch,' the primary suspect in the murder of a teenaged girl in a small Alaskan town, in Insomnia. In Mark Romanek's One Hour Photo, Williams played a photo lab employee who becomes obsessed with a young suburban family.\n\nUsing only his voice, Williams created one of the most vivid characters in recent memory - the 'Blue Genie of the Lamp' in Disney's Aladdin. The performance redefined how animations were voiced. Audio versions of his one-man shows and the children's record \"Pecos Bill,\" have won him five Grammy Awards. More recently Williams lent his vocal talents to the blockbuster hit animated feature Robots.\n\nWilliams' stage credits include a landmark production of Samuel Beckett's \"Waiting for Godot\" directed by Mike Nichols and co-starring Steve Martin and, most recently, the Broadway show \"Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo\" in which Williams took the lead role of the tiger. In 2006 he particpated in a short run in San Francisco of \"The Exonerated,\" which tells the true stories of six innocent survivors of death row. Offstage, Williams took great joy in supporting causes too numerous to identify -covering the spectrum from health care and human rights, to education, environmental protection, and the arts. He has toured the Middle East four times to help raise morale among the troops and is, perhaps, best known philanthropically for his affiliation with \"Comic Relief,\" which was founded in 1986 as a non-profit organization to help America's homeless. To date, the overall efforts of the \"Comic Relief\" organization have raised over $50 Million.\n\nOn August 11, 2014 Robin Williams passed away.\n\nSource 2010 [edited by RWF in 2014]: robinwilliams.com"
