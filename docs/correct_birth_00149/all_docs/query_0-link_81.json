Though Lane and Williams dominate the screen with powerful personalities, the best moments of the film are quieter, character focused scenes that allow these amazing talents to flesh out characters that might otherwise be caricature. A comedy with a message of acceptance.

Thoroughly focused on Williams’ bombastic personality, Good Morning, Vietnam punctuates manic energy with sobering moments of drama. A uniquely energetic war film.
