        "text": "Brian Owen Johnson\n\nThe world lost a great friend, Brian passed away unexpectedly on July 7, 2024.\n\nHe was born on January 4, 1991 to Ray and Robin Johnson in Cincinnati, Ohio. Graduating from Anderson high school in 2009 and from University of Cincinnati in 2014.\n\nTalented musician, skilled bass player, loving brother and son, proud uncle, loyal friend. He had an unpredictable wit and would do anything to make anyone around him laugh.\n\nA lifelong Cincinnati native who could be found listening, singing, playing, or just enjoying music. An avid 76ers fan who made it his mission to dress everyone (including his dog) in 76ers gear. He spent his days surrounded by friends with his dog, Millie, never too far behind.\n\nBrian cherished nothing more than family; the one he was born into and the one he built along the way.\n\nThere will never be another like Brian and the world wont be the same without him.\n\nFare you well, fare you well\n\nI love you more than words can tell\n\nSurvived by his parents Ray and Robin Johnson; his sister Lindsay (Tony) Lambertson; nephew and niece, Jackson and Austin Lambertson; Millie; and his chosen brother Steve Williams.\n\nThere will be a celebration of life; date, time, and location to follow.\n\nTo order memorial trees or send flowers to the family in memory of Brian Johnson, please visit our flower store."
