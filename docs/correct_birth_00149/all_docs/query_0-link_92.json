        "text": "If you've taken the Milwaukee Avenue bus or Blue Line train heading south recently, you may have noticed a towering new mural on the north side of the building that houses the Concord Music Hall (2047 N Milwaukee Ave). The visage of late comedian and actor Robin Williams is depicted on the wall, surrounded by laughing images of the Genie character that he voiced in Disney's animated Aladdin films.\n\nThe expansive mural is the work of New York street artist Jerkface and New Zealand artist Owen Dippie, who collaborated on the project over the past week. Jerkface is known for his subversive depictions of animated pop-culture characters, while Dippie specializes in hyper-detailed portraits.\n\nWhen the mural appeared earlier this week, some Reddit users theorized that the art might have been created in honor of National Suicide Prevention Awareness Month, which takes place each September. Born in Chicago, Williams struggled with depression throughout his career before taking his own life at the age of 63.\n\nA representative for the Concord Music Hall acknowledged the presence of the mural but declined to provide any details about the work beyond the names of the artists who created it. You can head to Logan Square to see the mural for yourself or take a look at some photos of the brightly-colored artwork below."
