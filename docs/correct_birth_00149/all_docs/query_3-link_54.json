        "text": "As we remember the life of Robin Williams, we thought we'd share this interview we did with him back in January 2013 about his upcoming appearance in Savannah. The original headline on this story was: \"Drugs, Popeye and fried chicken: An interview with Robin Williams.\"\n\nPlease enjoy.\n\nIs it even fair to call Robin Williams an actor? Would that be doing him a disservice?\n\nSure, he's got an Oscar, two Emmys, four Golden Globes, two SAG Awards and five Grammys.\n\nBut through the hundreds of roles he's portrayed since transitioning in 1977 from stand-up comedian to, well, whatever he is, what audiences have always connected with most is Williams himself.\n\nExuberant, kind, forever unpredictable.\n\nOn Saturday night, he'll be at the Civic Center for an intimate sit-down with an old buddy, Canadian comedian David Steinberg. Ostensibly, they'll offer Savannah a conversational career retrospective in exchange for its quiet attention. But what the audience actually gets in return likely won't be decided until Williams takes his seat on the stage and flips on his mic. That's what they're really paying for, after all.\n\nMonday evening, I had the same pleasure, with a candid, measured and gracious Williams performing for an audience of one - me - via speaker phone.\n\nDO: So, Robin, where are you calling from?\n\nWilliams: \"Man, today I'm in Fort Myers, Fla.\"\n\nDO: And how's the tour?\n\nWilliams: \"Wow, so far it's been really good. The tour is all the South this time.\"\n\nDO: What's the worst thing about touring the South?\n\nWilliams: \"Nothing, it's absolutely wonderful. But the weather - that's the strangest thing. There was an ice storm in Raleigh-Durham, and this has been the other side of global warming.\"\n\nDO: So tell me a little about your tour.\n\nWilliams: \"It's like sit-down comedy. It's an interview show with David and I together kind of going back and forth about our careers. And it's pretty fun because he's got an amazing career, too.\"\n\nDO: What's the toughest question he's thrown at you so far?\n\nWilliams: \"Well, we kinda talk about, you know, kind of the idea of coming through drugs and alcohol, and we kind of conclude with that, but that's - that's not even tough. It's like, 'OK, let's do this, homie.'\"\n\nDO: You guys are old friends.\n\nWilliams: \"Yeah, big time. Years ago I did a sit-down interview with him for his show - it was actually before he had the Showtime deal - and he put it together with an interview he did with Jonathan Winters. Basically, he paired up different comedians ...\"\n\nDO: That was a great pairing.\n\nWilliams: \"It was me and Jonathan, yeah, which was wonderful. It was the best.\"\n\nDO: I wanted to ask you about Robert Altman's \"Popeye,\" your first big film role. Going into acting, you expect to play historical characters - Abraham Lincoln, Muhammad Ali. But what's it like when you're asked to play a cartoon, this, like, two-dimensional symbol with a 50-year history?\n\nWilliams: \"Oh my, it was the craziest experience. It was great. It was a great script written by Jules Feiffer based on the (E.C.) Segar cartoons and the comic strip, which is really wonderful.\n\n\"He's such a great, crusty character and an orphan, and sort of the whole idea of finding his Pappy - and all that stuff he mumbles is pretty nasty. Going back they wanted me to re-loop it, but it wasn't meant to be understood, it was meant to be like (in voice), 'Oh, I seen better looks in oatmeal,' you know, this kind of wild stuff. But it was, you know - it's a great character. He's tough.\n\n\"That was when I knew my manager was kinda out of it. I said, 'Charlie, how are the dailies?' He said, 'It's great, Robin, but could you open your other eye?' (laughs) And that's when I went, 'Oh God, he's on drugs. This is not good.'\"\n\nDO: There was so much physicality in that role ...\n\nWilliams: \"Yeah, I was training. I was doing gymnastics and tap dancing, to tell you the truth, kind of a double-dip.\"\n\nDO: When people think of Robin Williams, they tend to think about your signature - about your exuberance, which is so out there. But there's also this incredible compassion you've been able to project in all your characters through the years. Where does that come from?\n\nWilliams: \"I think it probably came from my father, who was this very, kind of, very ethical, quiet man, but very powerful and very sweet man. And I think that - I don't know. I think that might be from him. The comedy side came from my mother, she was outrageous.\"\n\nDO: Mom was the laughs and Dad was the heart.\n\nWilliams: \"Yeah. He was a very, just, very kind man and I think that, if I can say anything, I got it from him. Which would be a great gift, 'cause he was a really sweet guy.\"\n\nDO: What are you working on now?\n\nWilliams: \"One I just finished which I'm very proud of is called 'The Angriest Man in Brooklyn.' Basically, it's about a guy who finds out he has 90 minutes to live and tries to make amends for his whole life in that 90 minutes.\"\n\nDO: What kind of ...\n\nWilliams: \"He tries to resolve, tie up all the loose ends, and he has an [expletive]-load of them because he is so angry. He's got a bunch of things in his life that within that time period he's trying to gather together. He wants to have a going-away party, and only this one guy shows up, this one guy who's angry at him from high school. It's just a series of events that kind of cascade around him.\"\n\nDO: If we had a going-away party for you, who would show up?\n\nWilliams: \"God, I don't know (laughs). Hopefully it's not my ashes.\"\n\nDO: We've all been talking, wondering when was the last time you came through Savannah.\n\nWilliams: \"I don't know if I've ever been to Savannah. I was amazed - I was in Charleston, and it's just so gorgeous. You know, there's all these parts of the South people from the North and especially the West Coast are going, 'What?' And you get down here and it's just gorgeous. And then you get outside and you're in Asheville, N.C., and it's just these rolling, beautiful hills and farms. It's exquisite.\"\n\nDO: Where'd you grow up?\n\nWilliams: \"I was born in Chicago and grew up in the Midwest, and then we moved out to San Francisco when I was 16. I think that's where everything kind of kicked into high gear (laughs).\"\n\nDO: And you've been doing it ever since?\n\nWilliams: \"I think so, yeah. Doing it ever since, yeah (laughs). That was the beginning of doing it.\"\n\nDO: Well we're all looking forward to having you here. If you've got time, take a walk downtown. And for dinner, go for the real stuff.\n\nWilliams: \"I look forward to being there. Savannah. Yeah. I'll go for the real stuff (laughs) - what's the real stuff I should go for?\"\n\nDO: Mrs. Wilkes' Dining Room.\n\nWilliams: \"Mrs. Wilkes' Dining Room, huh? (laughs) Thanks for the tip, bro. I'm writing this down. OK.\"\n\nDO: They have the best fried chicken ...\n\nWilliams: \"Oh my God, yeah, that's what I was raised on. There was a black lady who took care of me named Suzie. She was amazing. And that was the best fried chicken of my life.\"\n\nIF YOU GO\n\nWhat: Robin Williams with David Steinberg\n\nWhen: 8 p.m. Feb. 2\n\nWhere: Johnny Mercer Theatre, Civic Center, 301 W. Oglethorpe Ave.\n\nCost: $45 and up; $25 student and military"
