        "text": "Robin Williams was a comedian and actor known for being a key member of Comic Relief as well as roles in hits such as Mrs. Doubtfire, Good Morning Vietnam, Dead Poets Society and Disney's Aladdin. He passed away on August 11, 2014.\n\nRobin McLaurin Williams was born on July 21, 1951, in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nWilliams claimed that when he saw Dr. Strangelove, he knew he wanted to be an actor. He was one of twenty students to be accepted to Juilliardâ€™s advanced program in 1973, where he was revered for his dramatic performances and mastery of dialects.\n\nWilliams began his career doing stand-up in comedy clubs in San Francisco before making the guest appearance on Happy Days as an alien named Mork that propelled him to fame. The character of Mork was so popular on Happy Days, he spawned his own series, Mork and Mindy. The show lasted from 1978-1982.\n\nWilliams continued to do stand-up while taking on film roles. After a couple of box office flops, Good Morning Vietnam was released in 1987 and he was nominated for his first Academy Award for Best Actor. He has also been nominated for this award for his roles in Dead Poets Society and The Fisher King. In 1997, Williams won an Oscar and a Screen Actors Guild award for Best Supporting actor in Good Will Hunting. Williams is equally renowned for his comedic and dramatic roles, taking on a variety of projects over the years, from a cross dressing nanny in Mrs. Doubtfire to a warm hearted clown in Patch Adams to a lonely obsessive film developer in One Hour Photo.\n\nFrom 1978-1988, Williams was married to Valerie Valardi. The couple had a son, Zachary, born in 1983. From 1989-2010, he was married to Marsha Garces. The couple has two children, Zelda and Cody. In 2011, he married Susan Schneider.\n\nWilliams was an avid philanthropist, supporting many charities with proceeds from comedy shows as well as donations of his time."
