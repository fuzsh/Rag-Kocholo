He would often improvise and make his classmates laugh.\n\nAfter completing college, the comedian got a scholarship to attend Julliard School in New York. Him and actor Christopher Reeves were the only two accepted onto the advanced program.\n\nAfter Julliard, Robin then went on do stand-up comedy in San Francisco.\n\nHaving a successful stand-up career, the star moved to Los Angeles where he was then spotted by TV producer George Schlatter.\n\nThis marked the beginning of the actor's TV career, appearing in comedy shows such as The Richard Pryor Show, Laugh-In, Eight Is Enough and Happy Days.\n\nIn 1978, Robin then got his own show, Mork & Mandy. Co-starring with Pam Dawber, the sitcom ran for four seasons.\n\nPlaying the lead role of Popeye, Robin made his big film debut in 1980's Popeye.\n\nBeginning his iconic movie career, he went on to star in movies such as Dead Poets Society, Moscow on the Hudson and Good Morning Vietnam.\n\nRobin battled with cocaine and alcohol addiction for many years, but he had a wake up call when comedian John Belushi died of a drug overdose the morning after they had been partying together in 1982.\n\nDespite checking into rehab for treatment for alcoholism in 2003 and again in 2014, Robin never returned to cocaine.\n\nAfter meeting when he was working as a bartender in San Francisco, Robin married Valerie Velardi In 1978 and welcomed their son Zachary Pym Williams. However in 1988, the couple divorced.\n\nThe actor then married Zachary's nanny Marsha Garces in 1989.\n\nRobin and Marsha had two children together - Zelda Rae Williams, who was born in 1989 and Cody Alan Williams, who was born in 1998.\n\nThe couple finalised their divorce in 2010 after Marsha filed that there were irreconcilable differences.\n\nIn 2011, Robin married graphic designer Susan Schneider and the pair were married up until his death.\n\nOn August 11th, 2014, Robin died by suicide in his Paradise Cay, California home. His autopsy stated that the star 'died of asphyxia due to hanging'.\n\nPrior to his death Robin had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and his wife stated that his anxiety, depression and insomnia worsened.\n\nRobin will always be remembered as an American 'national treasure' who made the world laugh with his stand-up comedy and iconic movies."
