        "text": "Robin Williams' mark on San Francisco stretches far past his iconic role in Mrs. Doubtfire, the classic comedy set in the city by the bay. The funnyman first moved to the Bay Area when he was 16 years-oldâ€”and the city became his comedic playground as he studied theater at the College of Marin and scored some stand-up gigs at San Francisco's now-defunct Holy City Zoo comedy club. Today, with a handful of landmarks named after himâ€”including a rainbow-clad tunnel that sits right above the Golden Gate Bridge, Williams' legacy is still felt nine years since his passing.\n\nThe Aladdin star also set down roots in the city as an adult, buying an Italian Renaissance-style house in San Francisco's upscale Seacliff neighborhood. Now, that home has hit the market for $25 million. According to The Wall Street Journal, Williams and then-wife Marsha Garces purchased the property in 1991 for $3.2 millionâ€”and gave the space their own personal touch. When the couple filed for divorce in 2010, Garces Williams was granted the rights to the home. Now, she is finally parting ways with it 13 years later. \"It's a beautiful, happy house,\" she told The Wall Street Journal. \"We had many, many fantastic years of fun and play and joy there.\"\n\nWhile Williams was known for his excellent comedic timing, this home is no joking matter. Nestled on a 17,149-square-foot lot, this residence boasts panoramic views of the Golden Gate Bridge, Marin Headlands, and Pacific Ocean. In true A-Lister fashion, the home's interiors are just as impressive as those breathtaking vistas. It's the best of both worlds, with updated conveniences but old-fashioned charm.\n\n\"[Garces Williams] and Williams took the house down to the studs and rebuilt it in the early nineties, updating all the major systems,\" Steven Mavromihalis, Compass listing agent, told House Beautiful. \"They expanded the home to its current 10,598 square feet on three levels. However they took great pains to preserve the rare and valuable building materials used in 1926, which are simply no longer available in the construction of modern homes.\"\n\nReady to see more?
