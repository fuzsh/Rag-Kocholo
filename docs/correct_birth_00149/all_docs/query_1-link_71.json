        "text": "I have adored Robin Williams since Mork and Mindy, this has been a devastating month here in Hollywood, we lost alot of people, and what people seem to forget there have been many stars in the past who have committed suicide, people just don't know or remember, and because of the fact that this pure talent, of such a good heart happened to do it, and in their lifetime, they condemn him, fact is whether right or wrong, only he will pay for this, if it is a sin, no one else, just like anybody would, leave it alone, we lost a beautiful person, comedic genius, yes it was a shock, but we didn't live his life, we don't know what the hell he was living with or going through, and yet everyone is so quick to judge, i wish I could of met this man, but I got to meet him through television and the movies, we should celebrate his life and all he gave to the world and to us, as his fans. No one in this life, this world is perfect and I feel grief for him and his family, I know he loved his family, Ive seen the tributes and the love Hollywood has poured out for him, I believe he should have a couple of stars up on the walk of fame, and I plan to go and visit his star today or tomorrow and his footprints at Manns theater, fact is he should of won the Oscar for more than just Good Will Hunting. don't judge this man because of what he has done, which is taken himself away from his family and from us, I'm sad because he was sad enough to feel there was no other way. I guess Heaven needed another angel and another laugh, I said the same thing when Lucille Ball died. I treasure the time that I have been able to enjoy his work, and the fact he made this world a funnier place to be and to live, I'm sad we wont have that anymore, but life does and will go on. I hope his family nothing but the best and hope that those who are close to them may help them heal during this time of tragic loss and sadness, we as his fans we as the public again will never know what he and or his family went through, thus we can go back and watch his work and laugh again, but we wont know the loss of a father, a friend, a husband , a person that they all knew they had to share with the world, Robin will always be loved, remembered, and cherished, and if you people who feel like its your duty to condemn this man, keep your pathetic thoughts to yourself.."
