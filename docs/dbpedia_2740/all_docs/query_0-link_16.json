As editors we sought out a wide selection of recognized scholars, asking them to include the most important new developments in their ﬁelds, as succinctly as possible. We have done our best to trim the familiar but at times off-putting conventions of scholarly apparatus and style, while striving to retain the accuracy, rigor, and open-mindedness of the best scholarly traditions. While we have worked to assure thematic unities in the volume, we have by no means sought to enforce any one interpretive perspective. The scholars represented here do not agree with each other on all points, but they do recognize that conﬂicting viewpoints of a scholarly nature should get a fair hearing. As editors we each contributed one of the articles. We collaborated on the Introduction and Conclusion, but they reﬂect differences of approach and contrasting nuances of interpretation, the Introduction being primarily the work of Albert Lindemann, the Conclusion of Richard Levy. This work is affectionately dedicated to the memory of John Doyle Klier, who died on September 23, 2007, before he could make his contribution to this volume. The scholarly world is a sadder, poorer place without him. ASL RSL\n\nList of Maps 1. Europe and the Mediterannean from ancient times to the end of the Middle Ages 2.

If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and all that was necessary would be to separate them from the rest of us, and then destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. Alexander Solzhenitsyn\n\nThe subheadings of this Introduction touch on themes that each of the volume’s authors has been asked to address. The goal in this Introduction is to alert the reader to key concepts, thus serving as a general overview, posing productive questions without attempting to resolve them. They will be taken up again in the Conclusion in an ampler and less tentative form. A N T ISEMIT ISM : W H AT IS IT? HOW C A N W E BE ST U NDER STA ND IT? Antisemitism is a complex term, in many ways oddly so. Boundless difﬁculties arise in attempting a deﬁnition of it, especially one that is more than a redundancy (hatred of Jews) and that points to its causes and nature. Much the same may be said about the wider, related term racism. Those using the terms antisemite and racist today often have transparently political agendas and are typically innocent of the terms’ tangled histories. Problems of this sort are not uncommon with ideological terms—fascism and liberalism are other obvious examples—but it does seem that what is implied by antisemitism is even more elusive, perhaps uniquely so. It is instructive that even self-proclaimed antisemites have long differed with one another over what the term really means or should mean. There are those who report that they know antisemitism when they see it, much as with pornography, even if they ﬁnd it difﬁcult to pin down with words the nature of their recognition. The comparison with pornography is suggestive in that some believe the mere viewing of it to be dangerously corrupting, whereas others believe that it is the already corrupt personalities (or dangerous tendencies in all personalities) that are attracted to pornography. Some, in turn, see antisemitic ideas as mysteriously potent, dangerously corrupting those who have\n\n2\n\nAlbert S. Lindemann and Richard S. Levy\n\ncontact with them; others believe simply that already corrupt personalities are attracted to antisemitic ideas. There is the associated problem with the term antisemitism, to quote Ian Buruma, that “this particular whistle has been blown so often and with such shrillness that exaggerated anxiety sometimes impairs serious discussion” (The New Republic, September 4, 2006, 23). Antisemite has become one of the most feared of today’s abusive epithets, along with racist. That problem is yet again linked to the issue of determining the genuine importance of antisemitism and evaluating the way that Jews have deﬁned themselves in relation to it: Are they somehow, in their very nature or by God’s design, a suffering people, crucially deﬁned by the hatred they have faced throughout history? Is it possible to imagine a Jewish identity separate from what has been disparagingly termed Leidensgeschichte (suffering history, in German), the centuries-old vulnerability and powerlessness of the Jews? Are Jews inclined to dramatize antisemitism, in history and in the current scene, downplaying other factors? Conversely, are non-Jews prone to minimizing the role of Jew-hatred, avoiding the self scrutiny that a realistic appreciation would involve? Analyses of the causes of antisemitism in history have fallen into several broad categories. At one extreme, it has been argued that the nature of Jews and the actions ﬂowing from that nature are to blame for the hatred they have encountered. Jews must then change their ways if that hatred is to cease. At the opposite extreme, hatred for Jews has been described as being generated from within the non-Jewish world, reﬂecting its pathologies but lacking any signiﬁcant relationship to the actual activities or real nature of Jews. Anti-Jewish hatred from this second perspective is deﬁned as essentially a Gentile problem, not a Jewish problem, and is to be solved by Gentile introspection and reform. At any rate, Jewish reform will not change the minds of genuine antisemites; they will always ﬁnd fault in Jews, whether it is abundant or trivial. Revealingly, the suggestion that both Jews and non-Jews need to change their ways if the hatred is to disappear has been rejected by both sides, often angrily. (The broad history of both sides, in the Jewish Question and a corresponding Gentile question, is explored in Chapter 1.) A more transcendent view of anti-Jewish hatred is that it reﬂects God’s will: Throughout history He has used the Gentiles to punish the Jews for their failure to live up to the covenant at Sinai. From this perspective, Gentile hatred is to be interpreted not only as divine punishment for Jewish transgressions but as part of God’s plan to preserve Jewish separateness—to uplift, purify, and ennoble the Jews through suffering. This general perspective is not limited to those who see a personal God intervening directly in history; as Nobel Prize winning author Isaac Bashevis Singer once put it, “only in exile did the Jews grow up spiritually” (Douglas Villiers, ed., Next Year in Jerusalem, London: Viking, 1976, 8). In other words, the centuries-long experiences, both negative and positive, of Jews in being driven from their promised land into exile have deepened their spiritual\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nsensibilities and broadened their intellectual horizons, rendering them in some sense unique or at least highly unusual among the peoples of the world. Conceptualizing antisemitism as generated from within Gentile society has suggestive parallels with the view that criminal personalities reﬂect inborn character, and not primarily environment. Similarly, in the proposed solutions to criminality and to antisemitism there are parallels in the notions of punishment versus rehabilitation. Some see antisemitism much as others see criminality; both are deeply, even mysteriously rooted and largely incurable. Antisemites, like hardened criminals, must be met with force, not sympathetic understanding; they need to be punished, incarcerated, or rigorously isolated. Efforts to understand them sympathetically will be thankless—and dangerous, much like efforts to appease dictators. Whichever position one favors, the far-reaching implication of the different power of Jews and non-Jews in history is a crucial consideration. Lord Acton famously commented that power tends to corrupt and absolute power to corrupt absolutely, an observation that might be considered fundamental to GentileJewish relations, insofar as Gentiles have been corrupted by their power over Jews. Yet fundamental to the Judeo-Christian worldview is the belief that powerlessness, suffering, and oppression ennoble. There is the contrary but also deep-set idea that oppression tends to corrupt the oppressed, pushing them toward criminality or other psychic disorders. The many ramiﬁcations of these positions will be pursued in subsequent chapters, but virtually all observers agree that the powerful and the powerless see the world in radically different ways, and they compose narratives about themselves in similarly contrasting ways. The ﬁrst of the above two interpretive stances (connecting hatred for Jews to Jewish belief and action) is often considered the basic antisemitic position, or that of the Gentile powerful. The second (placing blame on the non-Jewish world) may be seen as that of Jewish defensiveness, or that of the Jewish powerless. The third of the above interpretations, stressing divine will, must be accepted in some sense by all believers in an omnipotent, omniscient, and just god. However, it is not the kind of explanation that modern historians consider adequate. Even for believers it presents some daunting interpretive challenges. At any rate, after the Holocaust to view Jewish suffering as just punishment for Jewish sins is widely dismissed as abhorrent. In broader application, blaming the victim is taboo today, but beyond the facile way that phrase is sometimes used are some substantial issues, since blame or responsibility, especially when speaking of groups or collectivities, are concepts with remarkably blurred edges. Blaming the Christian world collectively for its centuries of oppression of Jews has long been an element of Jewish self-deﬁnition. Similarly, an element of Christian belief has long been that Jews collectively hate them, their savior, and all that Christianity stands for in terms of genuine human equality before God. Obviously the ﬁnger-pointing in each direction cannot be termed exactly comparable, again because of the issue of power: The historic\n\n4\n\nAlbert S. Lindemann and Richard S. Levy\n\npowerlessness of Jews, their small populations, and the undeniable reality of their suffering over the centuries give a substantially different tenor to the mutual charges. The countercharge that Jews historically have oppressed and exploited Christians is dismissed by many Jewish observers as an antisemitic canard. What scholarly balance might mean in regard to these heated exchanges is not easy to say. Many recognized scholars, Jewish and non-Jewish, implicitly accept that Jews have been responsible to some extent for the hatred they have encountered—and even that they have often exaggerated the extent of that hatred in a manipulative way. But such acceptance is usually accompanied by careful qualiﬁcations concerning how responsibility is to be deﬁned and how dramatization of Jewish suffering has been an understandable tool of self-protection. A central tenet of Zionism, amply expressed in the writings of Theodor Herzl and other leading Zionists, is that historically Jews, in order to survive in galut (exile), acquired character traits that were “objectively detestable.” Jews similarly assumed social positions, such as moneylending, that were inherently precarious and tension-creating. The only realistic or long-term remedy to these ills, from the Zionist perspective, is separation from Gentiles and the restoration of sovereign power to Jews in their own modern nation state. The Zionist form of ﬁnding defects in Jewish character easily moves toward the suggestion that the antisemites’ point of view has some justiﬁcation. Herzl repeatedly marveled at how much support he got from the antisemites of his day, while most Western Jews regarded him with deep suspicion. But today the suggestion that Jews were responsible in any sense for antisemitism is widely and often summarily dismissed, especially on a popular level, as a misapplication of the notion of balance and as a failure to understand Jews and their history as they deserve to be understood. Many who have written about the history of antisemitism have operated on an underlying conviction that antisemites are self-evidently bad people who believe bad things. Period. The main task of the historian, then, is to describe antisemites and their ideas amply. That description should be quite enough to reveal how fundamentally evil, groundless, and dangerous Jew-hatred is. This kind of moral clarity, more amply explored in a separate section below, leaves unresolved the crucial issue of exactly how antisemites are to be identiﬁed. Is antisemitism indeed self-evident and is it unitary in nature, as contrasted with being a hatred with a wide range of intensity and causes? In one interpretive direction, Anthony Julius, prominent lawyer and academic, has argued in favor of including as antisemitic all types of “emotional distancing” from Jews, from mild to ﬁerce. In his view, even those non-Jews who express sympathy for Jewish suffering, or who oppose hostile measures against Jews, still must qualify as antisemitic if they distance themselves emotionally from Jews as a collective category. Julius cites instances of “casual anti-Semitism” or “pseudo-philoSemitism” that he believes qualify as genuinely antisemitic because, in his words,\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nthey do not “welcome . . . [Jews] into those private spaces in which members of a society lead their lives” (David Kertzer, ed., Old Demons, New Debates: AntiSemitism in the West, New York: Holmes and Meier, 2005, 68). By this deﬁnition the majority of non-Jews, even in modern liberal societies such as the United States, have been and are now antisemitic. This deﬁnition also implicitly touches on the issue of power, since the exclusion of Jews from the private spaces of the powerful has unquestionably had wide-ranging negative implications for Jews throughout history. But such a sweeping deﬁnition has some awkward aspects, for it seems to place those Jews who do not welcome non-Jews into Jewish private spaces in a category of bigotry comparable to that of antisemitism. There is again the important complicating factor of power, but Jewish identity over the ages has notably involved a cultivation of Jewish private spaces, linked to an emotional distancing from non-Jews. Jewish religious leaders in the past prohibited the attendance of Jews at non-Jewish festivals and ceremonies, and the rules of kashrut limited socialization with non-Jews even at meals. IDEN T IT Y, DIST I NC T I V ENE SS, TOL ER AT ION Ruth Wisse, Harvard Professor of Yiddish Literature, has written that “from earliest days, Jewish sources distinguished ‘good’ nations from ‘evil’ according to whether they could tolerate Jewish distinctiveness” ( Jews and Power, New York: Schocken, 2007, 18). Distinctiveness is another amorphous concept, as is tolerance, but central to modern notions of identity is a recognition of the value of distinctiveness in the sense of various ethnic and religious private spaces. Modern multicultural and multireligious societies afﬁrm the right, indeed the solemn duty, of their members to cultivate an identity that preserves signiﬁcant differences from others. Those differences are by no means all invidious (and many modern Jews as well as other ethnic groups have obviously sought to minimize them), but some forms of identity are more far-ranging, separatist, and intolerant than others; some establish ampler private spaces, physical and psychological. Some are inclined to deﬁne others as morally inferior, if not intolerable. Such radically separatist and morally supremacist identities have existed and continue to exist among both Jews and non-Jews. (There has also long been a tendency, from earliest days, in non-Jewish sources to distinguish good Jews from evil ones, according to whether they are perceived to have malevolent or benevolent attitudes to non-Jewish society.) However, if the intolerance linked to preserving identity tends in its extreme forms to move toward bigotry, in its opposite direction it meshes with widely agreed-upon standards of moral uprightness. We are proudly intolerant of child molesters and stock market criminals, to say nothing of murderers and rapists. Moral choice inevitably involves not tolerating—indeed taking action against— certain kinds of behavior. But precisely how do we determine which behaviors\n\n6\n\nAlbert S. Lindemann and Richard S. Levy\n\nare tolerable and which are not? That is where consensus begins to come apart even in modern societies, at times explosively. Adherents of monotheistic religions, including Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, have historically believed in their own superior moral standards. References like those of Wisse to Jewish distinctiveness have clearly been made with such beliefs in mind. Revealingly, the term discrimination is similar in its ambiguity to toleration, in that it can suggest either prejudicial attitudes or penetrating observation. Much the same can be said about the term inclusion, which does not usually mean that Holocaust deniers should be included in scholarly conferences, or that Flat-Earthers should be given a place of respect in scientiﬁc discussions of planet Earth. Inclusion must be discriminating. Throughout history there have been those who have concluded that Jewish identity is dangerously different and thus not to be tolerated. They have formed the ﬁrm opinion that Jewish distinctiveness involves something inherently destructive to those among whom Jews live. Such conclusions have been especially prominent when Jews are seen to be growing rapidly in numbers, wealth, and inﬂuence. It was precisely in those regards that the modern term antisemitism came into common use in the 1880s, with a somewhat novel but hardly original notion of Jews as a material body, a race, rather than as a community of belief. Antisemites of those years, again in a novel but not completely original way, offered various programs of action to deal with the perceived threat from Jews. Anti-Jewish action was considered to be not only a matter of urgent self-defense but also one of moral probity. In contrast, those in the late nineteenth century, both Jews and non-Jews, who did not accept such anti-Jewish perceptions began to use the new term antisemitism to indicate an unjust attitude to Jews, based on false perceptions of their nature and activities. Some defenders of Judaism and secular Jewishness insisted that Jews, rather than being threats, beneﬁted the societies in which they lived. The traditional Christian position might be considered a variety of that position, with the crucial difference that Christians believed that Jews had lost God’s favor by crucifying His son. Still, the prevailing Christian position was not that Judaism was entirely evil. Christian morality was unmistakably inﬂuenced by Judaism. Christians recognized that Christ and his original disciples were all Jews, limiting the potential demonization of Jews as a physical entity. The prevailing Christian goal was to convert the Jews, not to destroy them physically. It is thus a striking paradox that imagery derived from Christianity is blamed for the unique demonization of Jews in Western civilization, whereas mainline Christian doctrine saw Jewish survival as useful and indeed as a reﬂection of God’s will. The ways that modern racial antisemites came to regard Jews as evil in nature involved, in many instances, a switching of the metaphor of their being Christ killers to their being spreaders of disease and disorder. That switch can be considered a kind of return to ancient metaphors, but it also provided the\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nfoundation for the concept of a complete physical elimination of Jews—in the way that science was seeking a ﬁnal solution to syphilis or cholera. Many opponents of antisemitism have themselves resorted to metaphors or similes of disease, describing antisemitism as akin to cancer or spreading as do pandemic viruses— thus the need for them to be wiped out. Most modern secular defenders of the Jews in the nineteenth century actually accepted the notion, in a sense similar to that of the Christians, that the Jews of their day had fallen into bad times, becoming useless if not positively harmful to modern societies, and were thus in urgent need of reform. A fair number of Gentile observers offered the “salt in soup” analogy: A little salt enhanced the ﬂavor of soup; too much ruined it. A few Jews might be beneﬁcial to a society, but too many undermined it. Even those who most insistently defended the Jews in the nineteenth century rarely if ever denied that dismayingly large numbers of them had acquired antisocial or parasitical traits. Those defenders nonetheless believed that the antisemites of their day exaggerated the problem, failing to see Jews in a just and balanced fashion, and making them all guilty for the failings of some. T HE ISSU E OF U NIQU ENE SS A ND DEMONIZI NG IM AGERY In defending the Jews, the issue of the uniqueness of Jew-hatred again arose, in that the defenders emphasized how the unjust or exaggerated visions of Jews somehow conjured up a uniquely toxic brew of related emotions—hatred, fear, jealousy, contempt—which over the course of Christian history had been embellished with grotesque images, and that imagery somehow infected believers with a curious (or unique) tenacity of belief, a striking resistance to contrary evidence, and ultimately an inclination to violence. Those historically accumulated images of Jews require special scrutiny. Some of them may be termed normal in that they resembled the imagery applied to other groups (e.g., Jews and Gypsies are secretive; Jews and Germans are arrogant). The more potent anti-Jewish images, however, were distinctly abnormal. Included among them was the Jews’ alleged proclivity to practice cannibalism, poison wells, and spread plague, or to drain the blood of non-Jewish children for various Jewish rituals. Jews have been charged—to enter fully into the peculiarly mystical symbolism of it all—with deicide (killing Christ), not only in having orchestrated the original Cruciﬁ xion, but in ritually rehearsing and rejoicing over it since then. Jews were charged with transforming their Purim narrative about the killing of Haman (the evil vizier) by the Jews of Persia into a thinly veiled yearly celebration of the killing of Christ. In a similarly mystical vein, a belief spread among Christians that Jews surreptitiously stole Eucharist wafers, tortured and deﬁled them, thus ritually reenacting the Cruciﬁ xion.\n\n8\n\nAlbert S. Lindemann and Richard S. Levy\n\nSome of the most inﬂuential deﬁnitions of antisemitism, those offered by such distinguished modern historians as Saul Friedländer and Bernard Lewis, have in common a special attention to the fantastic and mystical, to the peculiar demonization of Jews in antisemitic belief. Friedländer uses the term “redemptive antisemitism” to emphasize how the Nazis claimed to be standing up for godliness, for justice and humanity, against the demonically destructive Jews. Historian Bernard Lewis uses the term “cosmic evil.” Lewis in particular differs from Anthony Julius by warning against the perils, similar to those of crying wolf, of an overly broad or promiscuous use of the term antisemitism. In his opinion, it should not be used to describe any dislike of Jews. Ordinary frictions and hostilities that do not entail describing the Jews as a cosmic evil he dismisses as not appropriately termed antisemitic (“The New Anti-Semitism,” The American Scholar 75[1], Winter 2006: 25–36). He notes that in past centuries Islamic law treated Jews as inferior to Muslims but still treated them as humans, not as a cosmic evil. Muslims did not regularly invite Jews into their private spaces, but the Islamic world only became antisemitic by Lewis’s deﬁnition when it began to import the uniquely Christian demonization of the Jews. We arrive at a widely accepted if often inarticulate position: Antisemitism is in some deeply signiﬁcant sense a hatred like no other—the longest hatred—and the most tenacious and mysterious in human history. The historical depth of that hatred, of that endlessly reemerging antipathy, offers further evidence of its mysterious potency. Ostensibly for such reasons the term Jew-hatred came to appear inadequate to many observers in the late nineteenth century; antisemitism suggested more effectively the uniquely dangerous mystery of it all. There are problems with this more focused deﬁnition, as with the more all-encompassing one, most obviously in its tendency to exclude as antisemitic those hostilities arising from real or ordinary conﬂict between Jews and nonJews. In fact, a very large proportion of what is now or has been termed antisemitic does not have to do with demonization but rather with objective conﬂicts, arising from normal economic competition or social snobbery. Many of those who were called antisemites in the late nineteenth century did not demonize Jews any more than premodern Muslims had. Wilhelm Marr, the patriarch of modern antisemitism and the man credited with giving the new term wide publicity, emphatically rejected Christian demonization of Jews. Much the same might be said of Heinrich von Treitschke, the celebrated German professor who is credited with giving antisemitism respectability and whose name is associated with the slogan, later taken up by the Nazis, “The Jews are our misfortune!” Whatever his ire at the Jews of his day, Treitschke did not make a cosmic evil of them or advocate physical action against them. He did not even support demands that their recently acquired civil equality in Germany be withdrawn. Moreover, he described many Jews as praiseworthy German citizens. What he was demanding was that some of them\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nreform themselves, and he implicitly believed it possible (whereas if Jews were to be considered demons, they could not be reformed). Treitschke’s charges were no doubt unfair, but in Lewis’s terms they were not antisemitic. A N T ISEMIT ISM A S A R ELIGION, JEWS A S CHOSEN The term antisemitism was coined in the nineteenth century along with many other modern “isms” that came into broad use (e.g., liberalism, socialism, conservatism). However, given its status as a snarled emotional response to the presence of Jews rather than a reasoned and balanced conclusion based on cogently examined evidence, it sits in awkward company with the other isms or modern ideologies of the nineteenth century. Those who used the term in a favorable sense in the 1880s, such as Marr, claimed that they were relying on measurable, material evidence, on the scientiﬁcally veriﬁable facts of race, not religious dogma or inherited prejudice. But such claims ﬁnally failed to persuade many if not most Europeans, and a measure of consensus, especially among the educated and those of liberal inclinations, emerged that, rather than being scientiﬁc and rational, this particular ism had something uniquely primitive or atavistic about it. What is increasingly uncontested today is that race in its nineteenth-century usage was a pseudoscientiﬁc concept, one that in practice was applied in amazingly undisciplined and even contradictory ways by racists, including self-described antisemites. Even in the late nineteenth century, many observers dismissed what antisemites claimed as rationally gathered evidence as nothing more than facts assembled tendentiously, to bolster what came down to something like faith, an emotional need (or cynical political ploy) that was remotely if at all related to a disinterested scrutiny of evidence. Stated in other terms, antisemitism was seen to be less about factual evidence about Jews and more about pre-existing attitudes, frames of mind, or psychic states of non-Jews. Although it is often asserted that antisemites of the late nineteenth century were ignorant, ill-educated people, such was probably no more the case than with the followers of other major ideologies. Psychic serenity, high levels of education, and tolerant liberal values are only tenuously related. Even granting that the leading theorists of antisemitism were of mediocre intellectual stature, many antisemites were (and are) by no means unintelligent or unschooled. Indeed, many of them studied evidence about Jews assiduously and knew far more about Jews in a strictly factual sense than those Gentiles who defended them. Religious belief, too, has a tenuous relationship to intelligence, formal learning, and factual evidence—and much to do with social conditioning and psychic inclinations. The elusive, faith-based aspect of antisemitism parallels and is suggestively related to the elusiveness of Jewish identity, which might well be termed the\n\n10\n\nAlbert S. Lindemann and Richard S. Levy\n\nlongest identity in history, at least in Western history, and in modern times it has remained much more than what is commonly understood as a modern religious identity. Deﬁnitions of that Jewish essence (Yiddish: dos pintele yid) have been endlessly if inconclusively debated by Jews themselves. Nonetheless few observers have maintained that there is no content whatsoever to Jewish identity (even if Jewish defensiveness at times implicitly makes it seem that such is being claimed). A familiar conclusion is that Jews have been hated (feared, envied, denigrated) because of their peculiar separatist identity, itself based on their belief that as a people or nation elevated by God they are essentially distinct from the rest of humanity. Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel has described this separateness, this romemut (Hebrew: elevation), as central to Jewish identity. In his words, the Jews are “ontologically” different from others, that is, different in their essential being (Irving Abrahamson, Against Silence, New York: Holocaust Library, 1988, 1:153). His assertion connects with the rabbinical deﬁnition of Jews as a goy kadosh (holy nation) and an am nivchar (chosen people), commanded by God to remain distinct from others, both physically and spiritually. Jews are descended from the Patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, whereas the goyim, (the [Other] Nations) are descended from less hallowed forefathers. Jewish prayers and rituals in most varieties of Judaism to this day connect in one way or another to the concept of Jewish romemut. The havdala (differentiation) prayer, recited at the end of the Sabbath, links Jews to holiness and light, while the Other Nations are considered ordinary, not holy—and often evil. That outrage over Jewish pretensions to divine favor and essential separateness from others might be the most fundamental emotion in antisemitism ﬁnds a symbolic corroboration in Genesis: “Now Israel [Jacob] loved Joseph more than any other of his children . . . But when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they hated him and could not speak peaceably to him” (Gen. 37:3–4). When Joseph described his dream of his sheaf standing high and the sheaves of his brothers bowing down, his brothers hated him all the more: “Are you indeed to reign over us?” they asked angrily. If the Children of Israel hated their own paternally favored brother enough to try to kill him, it is not a long reach to conclude that the Other Nations have similarly hated and resented the Jews as God’s favorite. Modern interpretations of Jewish tradition have resisted much of the above reasoning; their counterarguments imply that the difference between Jews and non-Jews, far from being ontological, is nominal or minimal, especially insofar as the two groups share a common humanity or souls equal in the eyes of God. Even more, modern interpretations of the difference associated with Jewish identity insist that it does not imply the superiority, physical or moral, of Jews to others. Jews have hardly been immune, individually or collectively, to the yetzer hara (inclination to evil), as is amply documented in the Hebrew Bible and\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\nemphasized by rabbinical tradition. Modern Jewish wags of a secular bent have characterized Jews as “just like everyone else—only more so.” Modern Jews remain complexly divided on these issues, as on so many others. Judaism, like Christianity, has been and continues to be characterized by competing, seemingly irreconcilable traditions. One Jewish observer has distinguished an Ezra tradition from a Ruth tradition. The ﬁrst insists not only on the divine elevation of the Jews but on the irreducible otherness (physical and spiritual) and greater inclination to evil of the non-Jew. For those most attracted to the Ezra tradition, “Judaism is not essentially a matter of faith or ethics or ideology but . . . of mysteriously inherited traits” (Harold Schulweis, In God’s Mirror, Hoboken, NJ: Ktav, 1990, 200 ff). The opposing tradition celebrates Ruth the Moabite, a woman from an enemy tribe who joined the Jewish tribe (“whither thou goest I will go”), underlining the option of all peoples to become Jewish and thus the fundamental universalism of Judaism. Self-declared antisemites have actually agreed with those Jewish voices that insist on a unique Jewish identity based on an ontological difference. Frequently antisemites have even seen Jews as more intelligent than non-Jews, or certainly more clever. The essential difference, as antisemites have seen it, lies not in Jews being God’s Chosen but rather in their being agents of evil in history, engaged in a mission of destruction of other peoples, with the ultimate goal of ruling over them. Even many of those who reject such demonization as repellent ﬁnd Jewish claims to universalism a bit Orwellian. (“All animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others”, George Orwell, Animal Farm.) Other observers have deemed Jewish claims, whether to romemut or to genuine human equality, to be unconvincing but nonetheless tolerable in the way that other religious and ethnic claims are, since in modern multicultural and multireligious societies the awkward details and implications of the beliefs of others are not usually emphasized—or at least are no longer found to be as threatening as they were in centuries past (and for the most part remain unknown). Similarly, in modern liberal societies the extremist views of members of a given religious or ethnic group are not usually accepted as characteristic of the entire group, even if they get the most publicity. H A R D T IM E S A ND GR E AT M EN, A N T ISEMIT IC IDE A S A ND AC T ION Modern historians, as observed above, are not satisﬁed with historical explanations that rely on the role of divine intervention. The historical profession has also moved away from explanations that focus on great men as the movers and shakers of history. However, insofar as antisemitism has been conceptualized as produced by impersonal forces, there is a parallel with notions of divine predestination—and a similar paradox, in that predestined or historically conditioned\n\n12\n\nAlbert S. Lindemann and Richard S. Levy\n\ndecisions are difﬁcult to work into historical narratives that feature moral judgments as primary (a tendency that has been prominent in many if not most histories of antisemitism). We then return to the question: How are antisemites in history to be conceptualized, and what is the proper role of moral judgments in historical narrative? Scholars accept that hard times—plagues, wars, revolutions, economic depressions, natural disasters—have constituted, along with a perception of Jews growing in numbers and power, a common background to the most important episodes of antisemitic passion and violence. The very nature of modern historical explanation tends to work in the direction of minimizing personal responsibility and maximizing the role of impersonal forces. But how far should this be taken? Is Hitler understandable—and thus in some sense forgivable—because of his unhappy childhood? The question points toward an obvious slippery slope and the point previously made: Toleration and inclusion must be discriminating. Distrust of historical explanations that emphasize the importance of broad historical forces has moved in several directions. One has been back toward an earlier tendency to emphasize the role of famous historical personalities, either great thinkers or great men of action, who somehow have pulled the general population into their visions and ambitions. Lord Acton added to his wellknown quip (that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely) the following observation: “Great men are almost always bad men.” In that spirit, many of the standard modern histories of antisemitism have focused attention on great antisemites throughout history, men who are often associated with or believed to personify a tribe, people, or nation. Jewish rabbinical tradition has focused on Haman ha-rasha, Haman the Wicked, in the Book of Esther, as a symbol of absolute evil, along with his biblical forebears, Amalek and the Amalekites. In regard to such enemies, no sympathetic understanding is possible, nor is toleration advisable. On a more historically veriﬁable level, the many other Hamans of Jewish tradition have included Saint John Chrysostom, Martin Luther, and Bogdan Chmielnicki—each of whom have historically been revered by Catholics, Protestants, or Ukrainians, who read their own history in a different way than do most Jews. It is often the case that one people’s villain is another’s hero. The issue of sympathetic understanding has emerged with particular acrimony in efforts to understand the Third Reich and the Holocaust. Germany lost millions of its young men in World War I, and was unjustly blamed for having sole responsibility in starting it. Germany’s economy was subsequently thrown into chaos, its institutions undermined, its people humiliated. Can we conclude that Germans, particularly the common people, were victims of impersonal forces they did not understand and certainly did not control? Or are they more aptly characterized as active agents, “willing executioners,” to borrow a term used in a bestselling book on Nazi Germany by Daniel Goldhagen? (The popularity of that book among English-speaking readers had in part to do with\n\nIntroduction\n\n13\n\ngrowing resentments about how modern historians, in putting Nazism into historical context, were perceived as playing down issues of personal and national guilt: Hitler’s Willing Executioners: Ordinary Germans and the Holocaust, New York: Vintage, 1997). A thought-provoking contribution to this discussion was offered by Milton Himmelfarb, in an essay entitled “No Hitler, no Holocaust.” Without Hitler, he argued, there might well have been serious anti-Jewish action in Germany in the 1930s and 1940s but not a systematic program to murder all Jews. Hitler’s will—his irrational and irreducibly evil will—and his unshakable belief in his mission to save the world from the Jewish peril, were crucial to the Final Solution of the Jewish Question (Commentary, March 1984). Hitler looms as the greatest Haman of all history. It seems only natural that his life story would offer us valuable insights about how antisemitic convictions are formed. Was he criminally inclined at birth, or were unfortunate life experiences crucial to his perverse adult personality? Can he be considered a great thinker, in the way that Karl Marx or John Stuart Mill are usually considered to be? The very notion of an ideology that is essentially “anti,” based on hatred, suggests that the antisemitic personality, with Hitler as a prime example, is driven by narrow resentment, fear, and envy, without a broader or more positive vision. The conclusion is familiar: Antisemites, leaders and followers, have been fearful and paranoiac, insecure losers venting their frustrations about their own inadequacies, or the inadequacies of their people, on the convenient scapegoat, the Jews. However, the conclusion that antisemites have been petty losers, while certainly part of the truth, sits awkwardly with the fact that so many great men in European history have expressed anti-Jewish ideas. Similarly, Hitler was a man of greater intellectual abilities—and even of impressive learning in given areas—than has been commonly recognized (Frederick Spotts, Hitler and the Power of Aesthetics, New York: Overlook, 2003). The following chapters offer many examples of the often puzzling disconnect between antisemitic attitudes and anti-Jewish action. Thought and action are naturally assumed to have an integral relationship, but it goes too far to describe all those harboring antiJewish ideas as lowbrow losers, since such ideas have been embraced by many successful people and quite a number of impressively subtle intellects. A long list of such ﬁgures could be composed for modern times alone. In fact, it would be difﬁcult to make up more than a short list of famous or successful ﬁgures who did not have some sharply critical things to say in the public or private spheres about Judaism and Jews. Did antisemitic ideas somehow fatally infect the personality of these great men, as a disease infects a healthy body, or was it simply, to return to an earlier point, that their personalities were corrupt and thus attracted to antisemitism? A close examination of the lives of such men gives only feeble conﬁrmation to either hypothesis. It is revealing that some of the mostly highly esteemed Righteous\n\n14\n\nAlbert S. Lindemann and Richard S. Levy\n\nGentiles of modern times often made statements that qualify as antisemitic even by Lewis’s demanding standards. A few of the most obvious examples are Lord Balfour, Winston Churchill, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and Harry Truman, all of whom are famous for taking friendly actions of great importance to Jewish interests in the twentieth century—yet who have also been denounced as antisemites, based on various comments they made or attitudes they harbored. Churchill: “the Jews have created another system of morality . . . saturated with hatred as much as Christianity is with love.” Truman: “The Jews . . . are very, very selﬁsh. . . . When they have power . . . neither Hitler nor Stalin has anything on them for cruelty or mistreatment to the underdog” (Michael J. Cohen, Churchill and the Jews, London: Frank Cass, 1985; Allis and Ronald Radosh, A Safe Haven: Harry S. Truman and the Founding of Israel, New York: Harper, 2009). Perhaps the most celebrated Righteous Gentile in modern times, Oskar Schindler, was a Nazi Party member, by all accounts a man of easy morals and corrupt business practices—to say nothing of being a drinking buddy with some of the worst Nazi thugs. Yet Schindler risked life and fortune to save hundreds of his Jewish workers. Less known today is the story of Georges Picquart, who risked his career by making public the unreliability of the information used to convict his fellow ofﬁcer, Alfred Dreyfus, in the famous Dreyfus Affair of the late 1890s. Picquart was widely admired as a highly principled person—indeed viewed by Jews at the time as a hero—but his opinion of Jews in general and of Dreyfus in particular remained deeply disdainful, both before and after the Affair. It is tempting to dismiss the examples of men and women who spoke ill of Jews yet acted courageously in their defense as no more than bizarre exceptions to the rule, but they are too numerous to be so easily put aside. Solzhenitsyn’s words in the opening epigram (“the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being”) certainly apply in analyzing the relationship of antisemitic thought to action. The behavior of these people, moreover, suggests the need to qualify signiﬁcantly the assertion that anti-Jewish ideas have an irresistible ability to overwhelm other feelings or moral sentiments, that antisemitic beliefs reﬂect fatally ﬂawed personalities, or that such beliefs will inexorably result in hostile acts toward Jews. Contrasting but also revealing examples of the disconnect between action and pre-existing ideas could be cited in regard to people of liberal sentiments who had previously shown friendship toward Jews but who then turned against them, ostensibly prompted by opportunism, greed, fear, or cowardice. Perhaps even better known than Schindler today is another Nazi Party member, Adolf Eichmann. His story, as presented in Hannah Arendt’s controversial book, Eichmann in Jerusalem, has given rise to the current use (and abuse) of the term “the banality of evil.” Arendt observed that before he had joined the Nazi movement, Eichmann had not been notably hostile to Jews; he even seemed to have had\n\nIntroduction\n\n15\n\nsubstantial reasons to be friendly to them. His participation in mass murder was almost certainly not prompted by powerful pre-existing antisemitic convictions but rather by personal ambition, unquestioning respect for his superiors, and a related concern to show himself faithful to their Nazi ideals (to say nothing of an utterly breathtaking moral obtuseness). If Eichmann had been ordered by his superiors to come to the aid of Jews—and especially if he had believed doing so was necessary to the advancement of his career—there is much reason to believe that he would also have followed those orders faithfully. Eichmann was normal (or banal) in other regards, with no previous signs of psychosis, sadism, bloodlust, or criminality. If he had lived in another country, he would have followed other norms, as set by his recognized superiors, so long as they conformed to his self-interest. Hitler’s case stands in stark contrast, since he was not taking orders but giving them, and, in his early career, he had taken great risks in assuming positions that both questioned authority and stood outside respectability. Nonetheless, even in his case there are little-appreciated enigmas about how he acquired his passionate convictions and especially about the connection between those convictions and his actions between 1919 and 1945. His towering hatred of Jews by the eve of World War II seems beyond serious question, but precisely when or how he acquired that degree of hatred is less obvious. At the beginning of his political career, he does not seem to have had a coherent program in regard to the Jews (whatever his ﬂights of vicious rhetoric against them). Even more than Eichmann, before 1919 Hitler had had a number of friendly relationships with Jews. Again, on the basis of what we know about Hitler’s personal experiences with them, it seems that he had far more palpable cause to be friendly or grateful than full of hatred, since several of them helped him in signiﬁcant ways (Brigitte Hamann, Hitler’s Vienna: A Dictator’s Apprenticeship, New York: Oxford University Press, 1999). The examples of the above-mentioned men are more complex in their details and ambiguous in meaning than can be explored here. But if Churchill or Truman had experienced the disasters and humiliations of Germans or Russians, and if antisemitic traditions had been stronger in their countries, the ambiguities they felt about Jews might well have taken other directions. In both Churchill’s and Truman’s cases, Jewish support, ﬁnancial and in terms of prospective votes, in their political careers plausibly played a role in the decisions they made. Churchill wavered rather dramatically in his attitudes, especially in crisis periods, but he was more inclined to see the “good” Jews as more typical than the “bad.” Similarly, although Truman at times privately expressed ﬁerce irritation with “the Jews,” the main object of his ire was certain Jewish leaders and not all Jews (among whom he counted close, lifelong friends and concerning whom he retained benevolent intentions). Many Nazi leaders recognized that there were a few good Jews but insisted that most were destructive. Even Hitler, in private conversations, recognized\n\n16\n\nAlbert S. Lindemann and Richard S. Levy\n\nthat perhaps a few Jews were good, but he believed the bad ones were far more typical. Had Germany been victorious in World War I, Hitler’s attitudes might well have developed in different directions, his friendly or admiring contacts with Jews given greater meaning. It is even more likely that without World War I and the Bolshevik Revolution, Hitler would have remained a pathetic Austrian misﬁt, unknown to history. History may have lessons for us, but the historical record is also something easily—one is tempted to say usually—misused, its supposedly clear lessons applied in simplistic or crudely tendentious ways, ironically leading to new disasters. A ﬁtting parallel observation to Solzhenitsyn’s, concerning the line between good and evil, might be made concerning the inspirations granted to us by Clio, the muse of History: If only it were all so simple.\n\n1 The Jewish Question Albert S. Lindemann\n\nThe history of the Jewish Question overlaps but is not synonymous with the history of antisemitism or the history of Jewish-Gentile relations. The overlaps are nonetheless instructive; the debates about the position of Jews in modern society have been deeply colored by the history of previous relations and historical expectations. The speciﬁc term, the Jewish Question (sometimes the Jewish Problem), came into wide usage in the early nineteenth century, as part of a characteristic reforming mood and an optimism about how a series of problems could be solved reasonably, prominent among them the Irish Question, the German Question, the Social Question, and the Woman Question. To state what is obvious but at times unappreciated, most of those who offered proposals to solve the Jewish Question believed in that possibility, implicitly accepting Jews into the human family and not considering them a mystically separate and unchangeable branch of it. That optimistic attitude about reforming Jews went contrary to centuries-old traditions in Christian Europe but also nonetheless connected with Christian universalism (insofar as Christians accepted Jewish converts). That some of the nineteenth-century discussions of the Jewish Question moved not toward a reasonable resolution but rather toward antisemitism, that is, to a raging, demonizing hatred—and ultimately toward a “ﬁnal solution”—reminds us again of the issue of Jewish uniqueness. No comparable ﬁnal solution was seriously entertained in regard to the other questions listed above. Indeed, the Holocaust marked a signiﬁcant stage in the modern conceptualization of the mystical uniqueness of the Jews, insofar as it has been claimed that the mass murder by the Nazis was fundamentally unlike any other, rendering it in some sense beyond human comprehension, thus connecting the Holocaust with the most mystical deﬁnitions of antisemitism. In Europe up to the last years of the eighteenth century, Jews, women, and the lower orders did not enjoy full civil equality; their inferior legal status was linked to a long-standing belief that they were inferior in other regards. Reformers began to ask: Should they now be given the vote and awarded other equal legal rights? The character and habits of the Irish and the Jews were widely viewed in negative\n\n18\n\nAlbert S. Lindemann\n\nways, and debates raged throughout the nineteenth century about what could be done to improve them, to transform them into productive and law-abiding citizens. Overlaps in the debates also existed with the Social and Jewish questions, in that it was widely predicted that emancipated Jews would beneﬁt from capitalism and liberal institutions, whereas the emerging free-market factory system was believed to be potentially dangerous to the well being of the laboring classes. What then would be the repercussions of granting civil equality and the vote to Jews (or to workers)? Similarly, was it desirable to let the Irish have their own nation state, a notion that was being discussed for the Italians and Germans? To repeat, “the” Jewish Question refers speciﬁcally to a modern secular issue and discussions of practical political, economic, and social reform, asking if the Jews had the capacity or the desire to become fully emancipated modern citizens, with equal rights and responsibilities. However, “a” Jewish question or problem of a broader nature existed long before the modern period. At the same time, an enduring—if sharply alternating—strain of veneration for Jewish values can be traced, especially insofar as Christianity and Islam based themselves on Judaism. From an entirely different perspective, Jews were often found useful and thus protected, even granted important privileges by non-Jewish authorities. Without that enduring if highly ambiguous respect, paired with a recognition of the Jews’ usefulness in practical terms, it is hard to account for their survival over the centuries. This positive side to the relationship is easily overlooked, and any volume of this sort, explicitly focused on the negative aspects of Jewish-Gentile relations, risks giving an unbalanced impression of historical reality. Still, an implicit mandate of historical inquiry is to study historical problems with the belief that in understanding them we can, in some sense, resolve them, or at least live more comfortably with them. A profound ambiguity about the Jews certainly characterized the Christian Middle Ages in Europe. The increasingly negative attitude toward them in that thousand-year period, however, had more to do with combating Jewish ideas deemed threatening to Christianity than with physically destroying all Jews. There were a number of ugly, violent episodes, and by the late Middle Ages expulsions of Jews from Christian realms were frequent. Still, these fell far short in scope and thoroughness of the mass murder of the twentieth century. Long before the Christian period, “a” Jewish question also existed, in that many non-Jewish rulers considered the Jews to be a bizarre, irksome, or unruly people, presenting problems that needed to be addressed, and were, at times violently. Conversely, it could be said that, in the brief periods in ancient times when Jews themselves exercised political power to one degree or another, they faced a Gentile question: How were Jews to deal with the non-Jews among them? The answers to that question ranged from methodical physical extermination (Joshua’s program, according to the Bible, for Canaanite idolaters), to rigorous separatism (Ezra’s solution after the Babylonian captivity), to forced conversions (in the Hellenistic period), to complex mixtures of exclusion and toleration.\n\nThe Jewish Question\n\n19\n\nStill, Jewish rulers and religious leaders kept ﬁrmly in view the differences between the goy kadosh, the Holy Nation, and the goyim, the [Other] Nations. The modern ideal of equal rights and dignity for all citizens was not one embraced by premodern rulers, Jewish or non-Jewish, although there were some rough parallels in the Hellenistic and Roman periods. (The problem of granting equal rights to non-Jews has of course arisen as a major one in modern times for the state of Israel, to be addressed below.) The issue of power and powerlessness, as discussed in the Introduction, is crucial in evaluating these various periods and realms. Non-Jews have ruled over Jews for many centuries. Jews have only rarely ruled over non-Jews. The identities of each in relation to the other have been decisively inﬂuenced by their different experiences of power. A perceived rise in the power of Jewish minorities has repeatedly evoked hostile reactions by non-Jews. Jews themselves, even when a politically weak minority of the population, had, in a sense, to deal with a Gentile question; intricate rules regulating relations of the goy kadosh with the goyim grew up over the centuries, always concerned to preserve the Jewish sense of separateness and to avoid as much as possible the perceived pollutions and corruptions of close contact with non-Jews. Jewish leaders were also concerned with survival, and that concern inevitably entailed many convoluted compromises in dealing with Gentiles, a point all the more relevant for the ordinary population of Jews, often living as a tiny minority among non-Jews. PH A R AOH’S JEW ISH PROBL EM Throughout history both Jews and non-Jews have developed self-afﬁrming narratives about themselves and disparaging counter-narratives about each other. These dueling narratives were often based on the same biblical texts, but each group found remarkably different meanings in them. The Book of Exodus contains an account of what might be termed the ﬁrst time that Jews became a major problem for a non-Jewish ruler. It is also a founding biblical text for Jewish “suffering history.” Exodus is obviously a mythic narrative, distantly if at all related to actual historical events, but it (or endlessly evolving reinterpretations of it) nonetheless has served as one of several key narratives in the evolution of Jewish identity. It has similarly exercised a wide-ranging historical inﬂuence in terms of how others have composed narratives about the Jews, whether admiring or derogatory. “Judaism teaches,” a modern Orthodox Jew has observed, “that the biblical stories didn’t just happen once, never to be repeated. Instead, they set patterns that history will follow down to the end of history” (David Klinghoffer, “Redeeming Ishmael,” Forward, September 22, 2006, 15). Within Christianity comparable teachings have long existed, as is the case with Islam. All three have shown no little creativity in their interpretations of biblical stories, usually moving far beyond what is obvious from the bare text. Traditional Christian and\n\n20\n\nAlbert S. Lindemann\n\nIslamic readings have anachronistically been termed antisemitic, but modern racial antisemites, too, have often cited biblical texts to corroborate their hostility to Jews. An important element of modern Jewish consciousness is a belief that defenseless Jews have been unjustly persecuted or irrationally hated throughout history by the Other Nations. In that light, the Passover holiday commemorates each year the events described in Exodus. Yet the bare text of Exodus leaves open, to say the least, many other interpretive directions. For example, Exodus’s opening verses emphasize Pharaoh’s legitimate concern about the Israelites’ growing numbers and unstoppable, potentially dangerous power. “The Jews are stronger than we are,” Pharaoh warned. It was therefore necessary to “outsmart them,” to take measures to prevent looming disaster should the Israelites side with Egypt’s enemies. Jews were thus put under strict control and set to burdensome tasks. This notion of Jews as real enemies—not simply the ﬁgments of the fevered imagination of non-Jews—is central to the controversies that surround the history and nature of antisemitism. In those controversies, contrasting interpretations of the raw verses of Exodus have been possible not only because of preexisting agendas but because those verses cannot be easily reduced to the sort of coherent narrative that satisﬁes modern secular requirements. To modern scholars, the odd lacunae and bafﬂing logical inconsistencies of the verses of Exodus stand out. More than four centuries are unaccountably skipped over—the 430 years since the period when Joseph had served as an Egyptian vizier (high ofﬁcial) and when his policies had rescued Egypt from disaster. He had then been invited by a grateful pharaoh to settle on Egyptian land, with his aged father (Jacob/Israel), his siblings (the Children of Israel) and their various spouses, offspring, slaves, livestock, and other retinue. Inexplicably, centuries later the new pharaoh, as well as his immediate successor and all other high ofﬁcials, had forgotten Joseph’s services in saving Egypt from catastrophe. Over those four centuries, too, the god of the Israelites seemed to have forgotten his chosen people—and only suddenly “heard their groaning and remembered his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob” (Exod. 2:24–5). It further remains unclear from the biblical text how much the Israelites, after the passage of some eighteen generations in Egypt, continued to remember and honor their god. It is only natural to ask how much they had begun to blend into the surrounding population, intermarrying, absorbing non-Jewish ways, and worshipping non-Jewish gods. The account of the Israelites in Sinai after they escaped from Egypt leaves little room for doubt that they believed in the power of gods other than Yahweh. There is another apparent glaring paradox: If the Israelites had remained, over those four centuries, faithful to their god as the only true god, genuine ﬁdelity to any Egyptian god was impossible. (Cf. Gen. 8:25: “we [Israelites] . . . sacriﬁce to the Lord our God offerings abominable to the Egyptians.”) To be sure, exactly what “sacriﬁcing to our . . . God” entailed before the covenant at Sinai cannot\n\nThe Jewish Question\n\n21\n\nbe ascertained. Possibly in Joseph’s day, the ﬁdelity of the Children of Israel to their own tribal god over any Egyptian god was considered no threat by the pharaoh, since they were but a forlorn tribe, numbering around a hundred. But if they had subsequently increased their population to something like two million, as the biblical account states, the fear the Egyptians felt seems only natural. If the Egyptian reaction is to be considered a model of subsequent antiJewish feeling (establishing a pattern “down to the end of history”), it is worth noting that the driving emotion is presented in Exodus as an understandable dread about the Jews’ growth in numbers, linked to their dubious ﬁdelity to the pharaoh and the likelihood of their joining Egypt’s many enemies. Of all the examples of biblical “stories that didn’t just happen once, never to be repeated,” and from which lessons are to be learned, this one of a threatening Jewish rise, against which initial measures seemed futile, must surely rank high. Another interpretive puzzle in the Exodus account arises in the description of how the god of the Israelites was able to manipulate Pharaoh’s mind (or “harden his heart”), making of him essentially a puppet. This seems to imply that the Hamans of history are to be viewed ultimately as acting under divine supervision—that, in other language, antisemitism is embedded in the nature of reality, an expression of an omnipotent god’s inscrutable will. The Jewish god’s use of evil to accomplish good is often noted in the Hebrew Bible, as for example in Genesis 50:20, when Joseph explains to his fearful brothers (who had earlier plotted to kill him): “You meant evil against me, but God meant it for good,” in order that the Children of Israel should eventually come to Egypt, proliferate, and fulﬁll God’s plan for them. (The German philosopher Hegel, in the early nineteenth century, developed kindred notions of evil in his “cunning of Reason.”) Of the many non-Jewish interpretations of the events in Exodus, one of the most inﬂuential was that of Manetho, an Egyptian priest-historian of the third century bce. He indeed went further than reinterpreting the bare text; he dismissed it as simply false in its main assertions. Pharaoh’s expulsion of the Israelites, he wrote, was a matter of public hygiene, since they were an unwanted and troublesome band of foreign immigrants who had intermarried with the slave population and moreover were afﬂicted with contagious diseases. What we might today term illegal immigration was a common problem for the Egyptian empire, and to that extent Manetho’s account has some plausibility as actual history, although modern historians rely mostly on Josephus, a Jewish historian who lived in the ﬁrst century ce for what they know about Manetho, and Josephus may have signiﬁcantly edited Manetho’s history. At any rate, Manetho’s account, as presented by Josephus, and similar texts no longer extant were picked up by non-Jewish observers and reworked in many versions in the ancient world, typically featuring the contagious diseases of the Jews. The Exodus account, according to such perspectives, was a transparently pathetic effort to\n\n22\n\nAlbert S. Lindemann\n\ndisguise the Jews’ debased and diseased origins. The real reason for their original separation from the rest of humanity was not divine election but disease. Manetho’s counter-narrative might be termed a classic one in the history of antisemitism, in the sense that it radically reversed the Jews’ claims to holiness and divine favor, making them both loathsome and dangerous. His account is further noteworthy in that the Egyptians were described in the Bible as a particularly scorned Other Nation. Thus, Manetho’s counter-narrative may have reﬂected speciﬁcally Egyptian resentments, since Jews were numerous in Egyptian Alexandria, when Manetho lived there (some thousand years after the Exodus period). By that time they constituted a more afﬂuent and privileged part of the population than the native Egyptians. In short, Manetho may have been rehearsing a contemporary drama, or contemporary tensions, in his rendition of events in Egypt a thousand years earlier. Such a playing-out of contemporary conﬂicts via biblical texts would be a prominent trait of anti-Jewish writings in the ensuing centuries. H A M A N’S JEW ISH PROBL EM Manetho has been termed the ﬁrst antisemite, but a better candidate, especially in terms of associated symbolism and lessons of history down through the centuries, might be Haman. Traditional Jewish interpretations of the biblical text in the Book of Esther and a simple reading of it again point in remarkably contrasting directions, offering ample material for anti-Jewish narratives. In a simple reading, the anger of Haman over the failure of the Jew Mordecai to bow before him seems hardly surprising. What seems incomprehensible is how (or why) Mordecai dared to insult the vizier of a Persian potentate in such a fashion. Haman’s subsequent complaint to his sovereign that the Jews of the realm were disrespectful and disloyal (“their laws are different from those of every other people, and they do not keep the king’s laws”) might be explained simply as personal pique, but it also could be seen as understandable if indeed the Jews did observe laws that went contrary to the laws of the Persian king. However, in the Book of Esther the actual content of the beliefs of the Israelites, aside from their being “different,” is not described; the speciﬁc ways in which the Jews allegedly did not keep the king’s laws and were thus a danger are left unexplained. At any rate, as in Exodus, the Jews emerge victorious: Mordecai, Esther, and the Jews of Persia outmaneuver Haman, gain favor with the king, and then put Haman, his family, and thousands of his followers to death. For Jews in their centuries of powerlessness, this tale has obviously served as a fantasy of vengeance; for antisemites it has been cited as proof of Jewish guile—and of their ruthlessness once they gain power. Any number of other narratives of the Hebrew Bible presents comparable interpretive paradoxes and contradictory lessons. One of the most symbolically\n\nThe Jewish Question\n\n23\n\nrich is that concerning the twin brothers, Esau and Jacob in Genesis. A literal reading of the story seems to point to the conclusion that Jacob, urged on by his mother, was a conniving scoundrel. He deceived his blind and aged father, Isaac, and was thus able to gain the blessing that Isaac had intended for the elder twin brother, Esau (Gen. 25:19 ff.). Similarly, Esau’s anger at Jacob seems justiﬁed, hardly the result of baseless fantasy. Of course, in traditional Judeo-Christian narratives, Jacob stands as a patriarch, the hallowed father of all Jews, whereas Esau is the forefather of the classic enemies of Israel, the Edomites and Amalekites, down to Haman, the Romans, the Christians, Chmielnicki, and Hitler. The story of Esau and Jacob, at an even deeper level, again suggests a divinely predestined hatred, in that the twins were already ﬁghting in the womb, and the Lord announced to their mother, Rebekah: “Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples, born of you shall be divided.” Without the correct initial mindset or emotional predisposition, the texts of the Bible, Old and New Testament, are notoriously prone to what believers, Jews or Christians, dismiss as dangerous misinterpretations. A properly informed initial mindset guides believers along the path of recognizing what should be emphasized and what is to be passed over or explained away. They recognize Jacob’s good qualities (above all, the signs of his being chosen by God) and Esau’s bad ones (his physicality and brutishness). The key theme of today’s Passover ceremony is not that “we Jews grew to two million and scared the daylights out of the Egyptians.” It stresses rather that “we were once slaves,” cruelly oppressed, and because of our undeserved sufferings, we sympathize with the oppression of others. The authors of the Exodus account seem most of all to have been concerned to emphasize the power of the Israelites’ god in relation to the gods of the Egyptians, not his justice and mercy, or his love for all of humanity. Those emphases would come later. T HE CHR IST I A NS’ JEW ISH QU E ST ION The early Christians radically reinterpreted the texts of what they came to call the Old Testament, though not as radically as Manetho, since they retained that testament in their Holy Bible and accepted God’s elevation of the Jews. Martin Luther yet again reinterpreted various passages of the New Testament, rejecting much of the Catholic reading of them. Interestingly, he was at ﬁrst conﬁdent that he was returning to an originally correct interpretation, close to that long held by the Jews, and he expected that they would welcome his rebellion. When that turned out to be a mistaken expectation, he turned against them with a vengeance—again a familiar syndrome in the subsequent history of antisemitism. During the three or four centuries immediately following the death of Christ, when Jews and Christians were in hot contention with one another and the\n\n24\n\nAlbert S. Lindemann\n\nfoundations for the later Christian demonization of the Jews were being laid, Jewish counter-narratives of Christian texts also emerged. There has been much debate among scholars about the actual content of these texts and even more about the extent to which Jews considered them binding or relevant in later periods. But Christian authorities, especially by the high Middle Ages, came to consider them blasphemous, since they allegedly described Mary as a prostitute and Christ as an errant student of the Torah, a sorcerer and idolater, deserving of the death penalty. T HE FIR ST STAGE S OF T HE JEW ISH QU E ST ION I N MODER N T I M E S An initial point to keep in mind in approaching the discussions of “the” Jewish Question in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries is that previously accepted interpretations of the Bible, especially those respecting its divine inspiration, had been subjected to yet another series of counter-narratives, in the form of a searing rationalist scrutiny by the leading ﬁgures of the Enlightenment. The so-called philosophes, the enlightened thinkers of the age, constructed narratives in which not only the divine inspiration of the Bible but the elevation of the Jews and the sacred status of the Christians were all questioned. Men like Voltaire were inclined to view the Hebrew Bible in particular as a source of evil. With its morally confused tales of tribal cruelty, deception, and mass murder in the name of the Lord, it was deemed the basis of the bigotry and intolerance of the Jews, qualities that had then been passed on to the Christians, as well as to the Muslims, resulting in untold death and destruction in the name of the one true god. A second and more obvious point is that for centuries Jews had thought of themselves as indissolubly bound together as a mystical collective body by the covenant at Sinai, and as such explicitly forbidden by their god to mix intimately with the Other Nations. This belief by Jews that they were a separate people (that is, a different physical entity) and not simply the upholders of separate religious ideals, was taken seriously by many non-Jews. Even those Christians who were open to the idea of full modern citizenship for Jews often doubted that a people so long culturally apart and so tenaciously committed to physical separation from others could now become one with non-Jewish peoples, blending both bodies and spirits in universalist union. In short, the deeply entrenched notion, as mentioned in the Introduction, that Jewishness is ﬁnally “not a matter of faith or ethics or ideology but . . . of mysteriously inherited traits” (Schulweis) remained an enduring one even in the nineteenth century. Modern racial antisemites refashioned this idea with a hostile “scientiﬁc” gloss, using the term race to describe those mysteriously inherited traits or separate physical differences (but adding elements to the notion of physical difference that were not part of Jewish tradition).\n\nThe Jewish Question\n\n25\n\nOn the other hand, there were growing numbers of Jews, primarily those of the wealthier classes living in the major cities of western and central Europe, who not only aspired to become full members of modern nation states but who went so far as to lament their Jewish origin, yearning to become like non-Jews. Heinrich Heine, the celebrated German-Jewish poet, observed that Judaism could be considered a religion in the way that being a hunchback was a religion. Bernard Lazare, a prominent French-Jewish intellectual, commented that “Everywhere, up to the present time, the Jew has been an unsociable being. . . . The Jewish nation [has been] . . . demoralized and corrupted by an unjustiﬁable pride” (Albert S. Lindemann, The Jew Accused, New York: Cambridge University Press, 1991, 61–2). Those Jews who wanted to become part of the modern world as equal citizens yet who also continued in some sense to cherish their Jewishness—always a larger group than those who wished to escape from it entirely—agreed that much was repellent and primitive about traditional Jewish beliefs and existing Jewish culture. Various efforts were made by Jews themselves to reform or modernize Judaism and to curb those traits of the general Jewish population that offended others or that seemed to prevent them from becoming full-ﬂedged modern citizens. For another large part of the Jewish population in the nineteenth century, especially the Jews in eastern Europe, where the overwhelming majority of the Jewish population lived, the modernizing Jews were seen as the problem. They were denounced by Jewish religious leaders as heretics, dangerous in their respect for reason over revelation and rabbinical tradition, to say nothing of their desire to blend into the nations of Europe. Thus, the Jewish Question, while best deﬁned as an issue of what the powerful Gentiles considered necessary to reform the powerless Jews, had also a strictly Jewish dimension, one of Jews versus Jews, tradition versus modernism. Voltaire and later antisemites, such as Wilhelm Marr, claimed to feel sympathy for the Jews, but that sympathy was based on Jews as victims of Christian bigotry and not because they were considered admirable in their present state. In the discussions of the Jewish Question in the early nineteenth century this Voltairean perspective played a key role, particularly in the assertion that the majority of Jews in Europe had somehow become frozen in a historically remote stage of development, remaining stubbornly attached to backward, irrational ideas and antisocial habits. Insofar as it was argued that Jewish defects were the result of Christian oppression, reformers urged that Christian oppression be removed. Such reformers were conﬁdent that if the humiliating special laws long applied to Jews were abolished, the Jews would then move quickly to improve themselves. The lament of the celebrated Jewish reformer, Moses Mendelssohn, “They bind our hands and then complain that we do not make use of them,” was a guiding motto for those in favor of a rapidly introduced Jewish emancipation.\n\n26\n\nAlbert S. Lindemann\n\nBut that motto was not accepted as valid by many others, Jews and non-Jews. The non-Jews objected that if Jews were granted immediate civil equality and personal freedom, their long-established deviousness, vengefulness, and destructive proclivities would simply be unleashed. The opponents of immediate full emancipation for Jews, moreover, believed that those dangerous proclivities were essential to Jewishness, deriving mostly from those Jewish religious dictates that instilled contempt for non-Jews. Thus many reformers believed that certain controls over Jews had to be retained, to be removed only gradually, if at all. It would require a ﬁrm hand over many years to transform Jews from blinkered parasites into useful citizens willing to work with others as equals. And, just as important, it would also require many years for non-Jews to grow to trust them. The universalistic optimism of those who believed the Jewish Question could be rapidly solved was accompanied by a faith in unending progress. Similarly, the notion of how the “major” European peoples benevolently should absorb the “minor” ones was widely accepted in the nineteenth century. Even such prominent liberal spokesmen as J. S. Mill could not fathom how such minor peoples could even want to retain a traditional identity, with all its narrowness and backwardness, when they were offered the option of embracing sophisticated, more civilized, clearly superior identities. The Jews, like other minor peoples, needed to abandon their language and culture for the clearly superior cultures and languages of such leading countries as France, Britain, and Germany. In fact, growing numbers of Jews began to do just that. T HE DECLI NE I N OP T IMISM R EG A R DI NG T HE JEW ISH QU E ST ION In most European countries, this conﬁdence in the superiority of Western civilization prevailed up to the eve of World War I, although it had begun to fray at the edges during what was then called the Great Depression (in the 1870s and 1880s), when capitalism and liberal values faced questioning. A renewed appreciation of the realm of the nonrational was then expressed by such inﬂuential writers as Fyodor Dostoevsky and Friedrich Nietzsche. It became ever more widely recognized that religious values persisted even in those who no longer considered themselves religious. Such was allegedly the case with the Jews more than others, since religion in its traditional Jewish form represented an especially totalistic or all-embracing style of life, one that entailed much more than beliefs about God and the world to come. By the eve of World War I, Henry Wickham Steed, a proliﬁc and well-known author, traveler, and editor of the inﬂuential The Times of London, stated that the Jewish Question was “one of the greatest problems in the world”; no one, he added, “can be considered mature until he has striven to face it squarely on its\n\nThe Jewish Question\n\n27\n\nmerits.” Reactions to his reﬂections on Jewish matters were revealing. Many Jews denounced him as ignorant, ill-informed, or prejudiced against them. Many non-Jews, on the other hand, considered him soft or naive on the subject of Jews. NAT IONA L DIFFER ENCE S : FR A NCE A ND RUSSI A In broad national and geographical terms, again two contrasting approaches to the Jewish Question can be distinguished, the French (the most progressive) and the Russian (the most reactionary). A third approach might be distinguished in the United States, where a Jewish question comparable in signiﬁcance to that of Europe failed to arise, in large part because the nation’s founding constitution already granted Jews civil equality, but perhaps even more because during the ﬁrst century of the new nation’s existence the population of Jews was extremely small. In France, in late 1791, after nearly two years of acrimonious debates in the revolutionary national assembly, civil equality was granted to the country’s approximately 30,000 Jews (the total population of France was approximately 20 million). Between 1791 and 1815, France’s revolutionary armies conquered large areas of central and southern Europe, and Jews in those areas were granted civil equality. In 1806, the Emperor Napoleon obtained from a specially convoked Assembly of Jewish Notables a formal afﬁrmation that French Jews were committed to embracing modern citizenship and French nationality. These were large steps for Jews, so much so that some thereafter referred to a new covenant, replacing the one at Sinai. By mid-century, it seemed to many observers in France that the Jewish Question was well on its way to be being resolved, and that France could stand as a model for others. The nature of the Jewish Question in the economically backward and politically despotic tsarist empire was revealingly different, in large part because of rapidly growing numbers of Jews there (nearly 1.5 million at the beginning of the century, 5 million by its end), and their far greater poverty. Another difference was the great diversity of populations and the sprawling territories of the tsarist empire, making integral nationalism and monoculturalism of the French model impractical. The Russian empire had long been ruled with a despotic hand, and a change to Western democratic models was seen as both unworkable and undesirable by Russia’s leaders. The Jewish Question overlapped with other questions in Russia even more than in the West. A primary worry for Russian ofﬁcials was that political and economic liberalization would beneﬁt the Jews but put the Christian lower orders in jeopardy of being exploited. Jews in a liberal state and economy could be expected to take advantage of the simple peasants. Indeed, such issues had been a concern almost as soon as Russia had taken over the lands formerly ruled\n\n28\n\nAlbert S. Lindemann\n\nby the Polish Commonwealth, with its large Jewish population, in the late eighteenth century. More than was the case for most western European countries, the Jewish Question was but one of many daunting questions facing Russia’s rulers, most of which related ultimately back to the issue of how or whether tsarist rule could survive the challenges of modern times. The ever-rebellious Poles were far more of a worry than the Jews; the restive peasants were an even larger concern. While most European states had feared Russian expansion in the early part of the nineteenth century, by the end of the century, the situation had become reversed: The tsarist regime had come to fear rising Western nations, rapidly industrializing Germany and Britain above all. To the east, the expanding and modernizing Japanese empire profoundly humiliated Russia in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–5. If ever there was an example of the events of the Bible seeming to repeat themselves, it was in Russia by the turn of the century: The tsars, like the pharaohs, faced a rapidly growing and restive Jewish population, one that Russia’s leaders feared might collaborate with the Jews in enemy countries. The tsars feared the Jews as a growing internal danger as well; they became highly visible among the revolutionary populists and assassins of tsarist ofﬁcials from the 1870s onward. The Bolsheviks and their competitors, the Mensheviks, numbered many Jews in their upper ranks, much beyond the Jewish proportion of the general population. The explosive growth of the population of the culturally distinct Ostjuden (eastern Jews) was viewed with growing alarm outside Russia, since they were known to be even more uncivilized than the Jews in the rest of Europe. By the 1880s they had begun moving out of their east European areas of concentration by the millions, bringing, in the eyes of their detractors, disease, corruption, and revolutionary doctrines to other countries. This mass exodus was a reaction primarily to economic hardship and population growth, but also to popular anti-Jewish violence and what Jews perceived as legal harassment by tsarist ofﬁcials. A growing part of Russia’s Jewish population concluded that its future under the tsars was bleak and that foreign lands, especially the United States, offered brighter prospects. Russian ofﬁcials, too, saw mass emigration as one way that their Jewish Question could be mitigated. Granting the Jews civil equality was long resisted as simply too dangerous. NAT IONA L DIFFER ENCE S : T HE H A BSBU RG EMPIR E , GR E AT BR ITA I N, GER M A N Y In the neighboring Austria-Hungary, another multinational empire second only to tsarist Russia in the number and proportion of Jews within its borders, extended discussions of the Jewish Question led ﬁnally to the granting of civil\n\nThe Jewish Question\n\n29\n\nequality in 1867, a year of massive internal reforms that included the creation of the Dual Monarchy, or the Austro-Hungarian state form. There was interestingly little pressure on Jews by Habsburg authorities to cast off the traditional national element of their Jewish identity since modern nationalism was considered a grave threat to the survival of the multinational empire. Nonetheless, signiﬁcant numbers of Jews in the Habsburg empire, again those mostly of the upper and middle classes in large cities, enthusiastically embraced the language and culture, especially the high culture, of the ruling Germans and Magyars. Here too Jews constituted a scattered and diverse population, but most of the modernizing Jews in the Habsburg empire did not yearn to live in a modern German nation state, even though they enthusiastically associated themselves with German high culture and language. They preferred a multicultural country that protected their human and civil rights but that did not expect that they so alter their Jewish identity as to blend into another national group. Partly for such reasons, Jewish relations with Habsburg authorities were more harmonious than was the case with Russian authorities of these years. The Emperor Franz Joseph was widely revered by those he affectionately referred to as “his” Jews. Still, popular hostility to Jews in the form of political antisemitism grew into a major issue, as the election of the antisemitic Karl Lueger as mayor of Vienna (1897–1910) demonstrated. In the rest of Europe the French model was admired by liberals but only cautiously applied. Britain’s approach to the Jewish Question as to other political issues was proudly gradualist. That a man of Jewish origin (though converted to Christianity as a child), Benjamin Disraeli, became prime minister was one indication of a more open atmosphere than was the case on the Continent. Still, he was widely regarded by members of the ruling class as unlike them, unchangeably exotic. His own trumpeting of the signiﬁcance of the Jewish race and its role in Europe’s high civilization—indeed the role of Jews in exerting power behind the scenes or in fomenting revolution—provided fodder for many antisemites. The French model was problematic for Germans, since they tended to deﬁne themselves in contrast to the French, especially after the Napoleonic empire fell in 1815. Still politically divided in the ﬁrst half of the nineteenth century, the thirty-odd German states dealt variously with the Jewish Question but generally preferred caution and incremental improvements in the status of Jews. German Jews who had experienced civil equality under Napoleonic rule often faced a return of various discriminatory laws when Napoleon fell. Nonetheless, the culture and intellectual life of German-speaking lands were inﬂuenced by Jewish genius more impressively than anywhere else in the world. Similarly, the exploration of the Jewish Question, die Judenfrage, by Germanlanguage thinkers, Jewish and Gentile, in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries was unusually inﬂuential. Full civil equality for German Jews came only with the formation of the German Reich in 1871, but in that Reich, as\n\n30\n\nAlbert S. Lindemann\n\nin the Habsburg empire, modern political antisemitism soon challenged the wisdom of granting civil equality to the Jews, spreading alarm about the negative implications of rising Jewish power. Perhaps the most inﬂuential of the earliest German writers on the Jewish Question was the Prussian ofﬁcial Christian Wilhelm von Dohm, whose book On the Civic Improvement of the Jews appeared in the early 1780s. Typical of the German enlightened civil servants of the day, Dohm was optimistic but prudent. He observed that the tragic experiences of these “Asian fugitives” had made them devious in their intercourse with non-Jews. The Jews of the biblical past were guilty of murderous hatred of others, he observed, but he concluded that most present-day Jews no longer felt any “commandment to hate and insult members of other faiths.” The moral failings of Jews would diminish if they were allowed to enjoy civil equality and if Christians offered them fair and compassionate treatment. Dohm drew the line, however, at allowing Jews to hold public ofﬁce; that could come only after they had reformed themselves adequately to earn public conﬁdence. Another German contribution was On the Jewish Question (1844) by the young Karl Marx, who was of Jewish origin but like Disraeli formally Christian, since his father had converted to Christianity. Marx was not raised as a Jew, and he married a Gentile, as did Disraeli. But whereas Disraeli held an admiring if not grandiose view of Jews, Marx portrayed them as the archetypical greedy capitalists, so obsessed with money and accumulation of material goods that they had lost their humanity. Only a revolution that would destroy capitalism could solve the Jewish Question. Marx’s essay was cast in the impenetrable philosophic jargon of the day, and the exact meaning of many of its passages remains open to question. Still, there is little doubt that Marx’s attitude to Jews was profoundly negative, and his essay was later put to antisemitic purposes. The declining optimism about solving the Jewish Question toward the end of the century was fed, as noted, by a growing critical scrutiny of enlightened ideals in general. Such was true even in France, where the Dreyfus Affair sent shock waves across the country and beyond. An even deeper pessimism about the likelihood of a rational and humane solution to the Jewish Question emerged after the catastrophic decade of war and revolution between 1914 and 1924. For a few years, the German Weimar Republic seemed to offer hope that Jews and Gentiles could work harmoniously and productively together, but that hope collapsed with the Great Depression. The Bolshevik takeover in the fall of 1917 was accompanied by claims that at long last the Jewish Question in Russia was being solved through Communism, but the Communist solution to the Jewish Question implied, following Marx’s lead, an eventual disappearance not only of Judaism (and all religions) but of Jewishness as a signiﬁcantly separate identity. Even more ominous for the future of the Jews, the birth of the Soviet regime and the concept of Marxist world revolution gave life to the new charge of JudeoBolshevism, revivifying visions of Jewish destructive conspiracies and plans to\n\nThe Jewish Question\n\n31\n\nrule the world—key charges in the Nazi worldview and accepted by many who were not Nazi, even by those strongly opposed to the Nazis. T HE JEW ISH QU E ST ION A F T ER 1945 After World War II and the Holocaust, the speciﬁc term “the Jewish Question” came to have a dated feel, no doubt largely because Jews had achieved formal civil equality everywhere in Europe and America.
