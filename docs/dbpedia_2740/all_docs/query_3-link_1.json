        "text": "The suspect in today’s mass shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh had an extensive antisemitic, anti-Jewish digital footprint.\n\nOn the last day of Passover, bloodshed in the middle of Shabbat services.\n\nWe believe that the suspect held views that reflected hatred of the Jewish people.\n\nViolent attacks against Jews are on the rise.\n\nIn the US, antisemitic incidents are at the highest levels in 40 years—and have more than doubled in the past ten.\n\nThese attacks all have a common root: antisemitism.\n\nAntisemitism means prejudice against or hatred of Jews.\n\nAnd it can take many forms.\n\nThe Holocaust, during which Nazis and their collaborators murdered 6 million Jews, is the worst example of antisemitism in history.\n\nBut it also exists in daily life.\n\nA popular meme depicts a man, meant to be Jewish, with exaggerated, grotesque features.\n\nA social media influencer makes a joke about the Holocaust, or does a Nazi salute in a video shared with millions of followers.\n\nHateful hashtags trend on Instagram.\n\nSchool buildings are defaced with swastikas.\n\nSomeone argues that Israel doesn’t have the right to exist.\n\nThese are all expressions of antisemitism that can become dangerous if left unchallenged.\n\nSometimes, antisemitism doesn’t sound like hatred — it might even sound complimentary.\n\nFor example, believing that all Jews are good with money can open the door to more overtly antisemitic beliefs such as all Jews are greedy.\n\nWhen repeated over and over, and not questioned, stereotypes can be accepted as truth.\n\nAnd that can eventually lead to biases and hatred of an entire group.\n\nThe Holocaust began with words, not killing.\n\nAnd while there’s no direct connection between sharing a meme and violent attacks, when left unchecked, antisemitism creeps into all aspects of society.\n\nAnd starts chipping away at democratic values.\n\nThe more you hear or see antisemitism in your social media feed or in casual conversations, the more accustomed—or numb—you become to hateful and dangerous beliefs and behavior.\n\nWhich is why it’s important to never ignore it, overlook it, or accept it.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic upturned the world, creating both health and economic disasters.\n\nAlong with these disasters came another persistent threat: A rise in antisemitism.\n\nAntisemitism means prejudice against or hatred of Jews.\n\nIn the US, antisemitic incidents are at the highest levels in 40 years—and have more than doubled in the past 10.\n\nIn times of economic or political turmoil, we often look for something or someone to blame.\n\nFor centuries, starting with the crucifixion of Jesus, Jews have been a frequent scapegoat, falsely blamed for catastrophic events.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, when the bubonic plague was destroying Europe, Jews were wrongly accused of spreading it by poisoning drinking wells.\n\nIt was even said that Jews murdered Christian babies to use their blood in religious rituals.\n\nThis so-called blood libel led to massacres of Jews between the 12th and 16th centuries.\n\nFast-forward to the early 1900s, and the devastation caused by the first world war made many people look for simple explanations for what had caused the conflict—or influenced its outcome.\n\nIn Germany, defeated military leaders spread lies that German Jews had betrayed their country, stabbing it in the back and causing it to lose the war.\n\nIn addition to having lost the first world war, Germany was struggling through the Great Depression of the 1930s.\n\nThis made many citizens even more desperate for someone to blame for the economic disaster.\n\nThe Nazi Party that rose to power in 1933 exploited this unrest.\n\nThey began depicting Jews as the enemy of the German people.\n\nThey said that Jews were an internal source of contagion or disease in Europe that had to be wiped out.\n\nThrough official state channels, Nazis said that Jews were the reason for Germany’s misfortune.\n\nThey exploited the general population's readiness to scapegoat Jews by enacting laws that targeted the freedoms of the Jewish people.\n\nSometimes called the longest hatred, antisemitism has persisted for thousands of years.\n\nNo matter how much the world changes, antisemitism adapts, flaring up again and again during turbulent times.\n\nCoronavirus lockdowns and COVID conspiracies are being blamed for a rise in antisemitism.\n\nThis persistent nature, not grounded in facts or reality, is what makes it so dangerous and deadly.\n\nIf history has taught us anything, it’s that we can never ignore it, overlook it, or accept it."
