        "text": "It's HOW one uses religion… ideology\n\nHappy,\n\nPeaceful,\n\nBlessed New Year!\n\n* To begin off with the first genocide (in recent history), the Armenian Genocide, whether it was a jihad [1] or not, it has been agreed [2] that religious-ethnic tensions which existed were certainly \"exacerbated and given direction by modern organic nationalism.\"\n\n* Though, \"Hitler hated Judaism, but he loathed Christianity, too,\" [3] Nazi / their collaborators reiterated, in order to inflame, earlier Christian tropes, even infamous blood libel, [4] and overwhelmingly Europe's Churches acknowledge their failure at the time. [5] Yet, there were Catholics confronting Hitler, [6] and there were Christians and other non-Jews who saved Jews, these individual heroes are called Righteous Among the Nations at Yad Vashem. [7]\n\nAmong the many levels of stands during WW2 [that uniquely dark period in human history, in scope in annihilating an entire people for no reason or \"conflict,\" the vast overall picking on Jews everywhere, the innumerable unimaginable cruelty], there were:\n\nA. Those that could have helped save, but chose not to, even not facing fear of the Nazis.\n\nB. Those that chose to actively help the Nazis in exchange of favors, money.\n\nC. Those that helped the Nazis, for no compensation.\n\nOn the other hand, there were:\n\nA. Those that chose to save Jews when they didn't face any repercussions.\n\nB. Those super heroes, super kind human beings, who sacrificed even in face of fear of punishment by Nazis.\n\n* Among the overwhelming tolerant US clergy, there was that \"Father\" Coughlin. [19].\n\nWhile the oldest known (US) group using religion into bigotry, is the KKK.\n\nThen came about those \"Aryans,\" \"Christian Identity\" and other likewise groups.\n\n* The Nazis used the Mufti Haj Amin al-Husseini and others [20 (b)], and he himself [8] abused Islam to link it with Nazism. There was Shakib Arslan's propaganda: his involvement in translating Mein Kampf, [9] before becoming \"Honorary Aryan,\" [10] his writing at the Nazi Arabic 'Barid al-Sharq [11] which also included the Mufti's Jihad calls. As well as at Radio Berlin - Voice of Hitler in Arabic - Younis Bahri using Islamic texts [12] (reviewed by Salafi: Taqi al-Din al-Hilali [13]) in Nazi broadcasts (1939-44).\n\nYet, there were (non-Arab) Muslims such as Albanians [14] who saved Jews. Asides from a unique case of an Egyptian. [15].\n\nThe Holocaust, was a European crime in scope, though such massacres as the Farhoud [8 (d)] were: Nazi-Arab Allied Mufti, Rachid al-Gaylani, al-Muthanna / Hitler-Youths modeled Futuwwah and others, as well as persecution in North Africa. The subject here is about use of religion.\n\nProgressive Robert Fisk blames the Mufti for frictions between Christians and Muslims that led to such bloodshed as in the 1990s among the Slavs. [8 (a)] He organized the brutal massacre of Jews in Hebron in 1929, [16] most of them ultra-Orthodox, non-Zionist and even anti-Zionist. [17].\n\nEven before the war, when the murderous of many, Mufti's gang, with the help of his brother Ahmad Shukeiri, murdered Dr. Anwar Shukeiri on June 8, 1939 for being on the Nashashibi side wanting peace with the Jews, the moderate Arab leader R. B. Nashashibi eulogized him as being a true Muslim: \"The people of Palestine knew him as a sincere patriot and a true Moslem.\" [18]\n\nHad this and other moderates not been eliminated, and other radicalization taken place, [20] then the Feb. 1941 poll (88% of Palestine Arabs supporting the Nazi/Fascist Axis) [20(h)] [21] might have been very different.\n\nAhmad Shukeiri's mentor, Istiqlal's Auni Abd el-Hadi met the Nazis, admiringly. [22] Shukeiri would fondly recall in his book (Beirut, 1969), how he, they all cheered, prayed for Hitler's victory. [23] Then he became actively involved helping Hitler since 1941. [24] And in 1946 he and Jamal al-Husseini had rationalized the Holocaust. [25] On November 30, 1962, Shukeiri promoted Neo-Nazis [26] [32 (a)] -- while quoting [27] NYT's article about them which in fact stated their Nazism [28] -- at the UN and Saudi Arabia fired him over it, weeks later. [29].\n\n* Deir Yassin, though disputed, even if it was exaggerated in order to strike fear at the Arabs, still, it was not kosher, to say the least. It marked the worst misdeed in 1948 on the Zionist side. Perpetrated by inexperienced radical youths. But who protested it at the immediate time? Haredi (very ultra-orthodox) people of Giv'at Shaul decrying that they had a peace pact with the Arabs and denounced them. So did the Rabbinate upon learning of the case. [30].\n\nWorth mentioning the murder of Haredi: Yaakov Yisrael De Haan on July 1, 1924 by radical secular Zionists. For pursuing peace negotiations with the Arabs. [31].\n\n* The 1960's Tacuara - 'Heil Hitler' era, with Nazi leader George Lincoln Rockwell seeking to conduct with them an International Nazi Conference at the time. [32 (a)] Then in cooperation with Arab League's ex-Nazi collaborator [32(c)] Hussein Triki. Radicals used local Catholics' patriotism for racism.[32 (b), (c)].\n\n* The spread of the militant strand of Buddhists in Asia. [33]. An example outside the Abrahamic faiths.\n\n________\n\nNOTES\n\n[1]\n\nKieser, H. (2020). Talaat Pasha: Father of Modern Turkey, Architect of Genocide.

Rescue took many forms and the Righteous came from different nations, religions and walks of life. What they had in common was that they protected their Jewish neighbors at a time when hostility and indifference prevailed.\n\n[8]\n\n(a)\n\nRobert Fisk: The Great War for Civilisation: The Conquest of the Middle East, Vintage, 2007, Ch. 11. pp. 360, 362:\n\nBy the mid-1990s, the only survivor of the hothouse world of Arab wartime Berlin society still alive was eighty-seven-year-old Wassef Kamal, who had been a supporter of Haj Amin in Baghdad and had made his own way to Nazi Germany via Vichy Syria, Turkey and Bulgaria in 1941: \"Most of the Palestinians and Arabs in Germany gathered round Haj Amin and Rashid al-Gaylani, who had also reached Berlin,\" he recalled for me in 1994...\"...\n\nBut amid the evil of the Holocaust, Haj Amin's moral position seems untenable. There is, too, in the archives of the wartime BBC Monitoring Service, a series of transcripts from Nazi radio stations that cast a dark shadow over any moral precepts Haj Amin might hace claimed. Here he is, for example, addressing a Balfour Day rally at the Luftwaffe hall in Berlin on 2 November 1943: \"The Germans know how to get rid of the Jews . . . They have definitely solved the Jewish problem.\" And on Berlin radio on 1 March 1944: \"Arabs, rise as one man and fight for your sacred rights. Kill the Jews wherever you find them. This pleases God, history and religion.\" On 21 January that year, Haj Amin had visited Ante Pavelic's ferocious Fascist state of Croatia—which included present-day Bosnia— where he addressed Muslim recruits to the SS with these words, so sharply in contrast with sentiments expressed in his postwar memoirs: \"There are also considerable similarities between Islamic principles and National Socialism, namely, in the affirmation of struggle and fellowship. . . in the ideas of order.\"\n\nHe even played a role in fomenting hatred between Bosnian Muslims and the largely Serb-led partisan force fighting the Germans in Yugoslavia, an anger that burst forth again in the atrocities of 1992.\n\nOn 26 May 1944, the BBC Monitoring Service recorded Haj Amin describing Tito as \"a friend of the Jews and a foe of the Prophet.\" In 1943 he received from Heinrich Himmler, the architect of the Holocaust, a telegram recalling for him that “the National Socialist Party had inscribed on its flag 'the extermination of world Jewry.' Our party sympathizes with the fight of the Arabs, especially the Arabs of Palestine, against the foreign Jew.\"\n\nRadio Berlin later reported that Haj Amin had \"arrived in Frankfurt for the purpose of visiting the Research Institute on the Jewish problem.\"\n\nDid Haj Amin know about the Jewish Holocaust? According to his most meticulous biographer, Zvi Elpeleg—a former Israeli military governor of Gaza who is respected as a historian even by Haj Amin's surviving family—“his frequent, close contacts with leaders of the Nazi regime cannot have left Haj Amin with any doubt as to the fate which awaited the Jews whose emigration was prevented by his efforts.\" In July 1943, when the extermination camps were already in operation in Poland, Haj Amin was complaining to Joachim von Ribbentrop, the German foreign minister, about Jewish emigration from Europe to Palestine in the following words: “If there are reasons which make their removal necessary, it would be essential and infinitely preferable to send them to other countries where they would find themselves under active control as, for example, Poland. . .\" Before his death, Haj Amin was to write that \"the Germans settled their accounts with the Jews well before my arrival in Germany,\" a statement that is factually and historical untrue...\n\nAlia al-Husseini, Haj Amin's granddaughter, recalled for me how her grandfather, in his last years, spoke of Hitler's true aims. \"He said that after the Jews, the Germans would destroy the Arabs— he knew this...\"\n\n(b)\n\nSchvindlerman, J. (2002). Tierras por paz, tierras por guerra. Argentina: Ensayos Del Sud. 332-3:\n\nAs early as 1939, an Arabic-language newspaper, Barid al-Sharq, was published in Berlin for distribution in the Middle East. The mufti's headquarters in Geneva and Istanbul allowed him to spread his espionage activities throughout the Middle East, where he had agents in Palestine, Syria and Iraq as well as maintaining contacts with German intelligence agents in Turkey.\n\nThe extent to which Judeophobia ran in al-Huseini's blood was shown by the fact that the mufti drew up a blueprint for the construction of a concentration camp north of Nablus where Jews from the Middle East would be exterminated. In this spirit, in 1940 he requested Germany to \"resolve the question of Jewish elements in Palestine and other Arab countries in accordance with the national and racial interests of the Arabs and along similar lines to those used to resolve the Jewish question in Germany and Italy.\" (emphasis added).\n\nHe told a Nazi official that the Jews should leave Palestine, adding \"they are free to go to he-ll.\" On several occasions al-Huseini urged the Third Reich to bomb Tel-Aviv and Jerusalem in an \"attack (which) must be carried out with great force to have a lasting effect\" as a (then secret) report from the Command of the German Air Force of October 29, 1943...\n\nSid Goldberg, 'The Grand Mufti and His Friends.' ADL Bulletin, September, 1967. (PDF).\n\n...thousands of Israelis are the sole survivors of families that vanished in the Nazi furnaces. But doubly ironic is the fact that the Soviet and Arab accusers of Israel stand guilty of their own charges. It was Soviet Russia that signed a nonaggression pact with Nazi Germany in 1939, a pact which was ultimately broken by Germany, not Russia. Some of the other communist countries which accused Israel ..\n\nalso know that route very well. Hungary, Rumania, Bulgaria, Albania and Slovakia not only were allies of Nazi Germany in World War II but had native Nazi movements that vied in viciousness with the German.\n\nWhat is less known is the record of the Arabs in World War II. President El-Atassi told the General Assembly, \"the Arabs fought in both world wars and contributed to the liberation of Europe from Nazism and to the realization of allied victory.\"\n\nTHE FACT is that Syria, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Lebanon did not declare war on Germany until February, 1945, when the war was little more than a mopping up operation by the allies. The Arab declarations of war were made in late February because attendance at the forthcoming San Francisco conference, setting up the United Nations, required a declaration of war on Germany no later than March 1.\n\nThe only Arab state that played any military role in the war was Transjordan, which declared war on Germany as early as Transjordan was totally dependent on British grants for its existence, and its army, the Arab legion, was in effect a part of the British Army, under British officers. Iraq declared war on Germany in 1943 after it was clear the Nazis were losing. Before that, pro-nazi sentiment was powerful in Baghdad, and a Nazi puppet government was installed there in 1941 under Rashid Ali, who went so far as to declare war on Britain. Rashid Ali received congratulations from Arab leaders in Egypt (including King Farouk), Lebanon, and Syria.\n\nThe latter permitted German bombers and transports to land on its fields while the Nazi regime lasted in Baghdad. The whole temper of the Arab world before and during World War II was neutralist at best, pro-nazi at worst. When Italian troops in August, 1940, invaded Egyptian territory, Egypt did not consider this a cause for war. The fighting was left to the British. Even General Erwin Rommel's invasion of Egypt, in May, 1941, couldn't nudge the Egyptians into a declaration of war. And so strong was the pro-nazi sentiment in Egypt that when Premier Ahmed Maher did declare war-on February 24, he was assassinated while reading the Royal Decree. Arab fighting during World War II was on the side of the Nazis.\n\nSeveral thousand Arab volunteers were mobilized into Nazi units by the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Hitler's man in the Middle Ease. The Mufti, (Haj Amin El-Husseini), who operated out of Berlin from 1941 to 1945, organized his pro-nazi Arabs into sabotage squads, espionage cells and a fighting unit called the Arab legion. The Mufti also helped organize the Moslems of Bosnia and other Balkan areas into special SS Units called \"The Black legions.\" He praised them as the \"cream of Islam\" and they were dispatched to the Eastern front in the Caucasus to stir Soviet Moslems into an anti-communist crusade. Some 3,000 of these Mufti troops were held prisoners of war as late as 1946 in Camp Opelika, Alabama.\n\nThe Grand Mufti was among the most popular Arab leaders before, during and after the war. So effective was his hate sputtering oratory that few if any Arab leaders dared oppose him. As spiritual and political leader of the Palestine Arabs he had learned to hate Jews in the '20's and '30's as their numbers increased in the land of Zion.\n\nNow 71... the Mufti had been Hitler's chief advisor on Arab affairs and the friend and confidante of Adolf Eichmann. Gideon Hausner, chief prosecutor at the Eichmann trial in Israel, established that \"the Mufti asked Gestapo chief Heinrich Himmler co provide him, after the war, when he planned to enter Jerusalem at the head of the axis troops, with a 'special adviser' from Eichmann's department to help him solve the Jewish question in the same way as it had been done in the axis countries. Eichmann offered the job co his assistant, Dieter Wisliceny.\"\n\nThe Grand Mufti spread his anti Jewish venom throughout the war over radio Berlin. He praised the Germans for \"knowing how to get rid of Jews.\" He urged his Arab listeners to \"kill the Jews wherever you find them.\" He gave the number of Jews \"still to be dealt with\" (in 1944) as 11 million, representing the Jewish populations of America, Russia and other countries beyond Hitler's reach. All this would signify no more than the ravings of one madman-except that the Mufti was returned to his role after the war as leader of the Palestine question.\n\nHe directed policy from a lavish and fortified home in Cairo and, as one of the Arab delegates to the United Nations in 1947 said, \"the Mufti is the irrefutable leader of the Holy Land Arabs.\"\n\nTo THIS DAY none of the Arab leaders has repudiated the Grand Mufti, or his pro-nazi assistants who worked with him in Berlin during the war. Nor is this tolerance of a Nazi in their midst surprising. Egypt, the chief victim of the \"Hitlerite\" Israelis, has given sanctuary to hundreds of former Nazis, among them up to 100 of Hitler's rocket and missile experts. Also in Egypt, according to the latest information from the Anti-Defamation League, are the following:\n\n-Colonel Naam Al-Nashar, formerly Leopold Gleim, who was head of German security in Poland. He arrived in Egypt in 1955 and organized the Egyptian security service along Nazi lines.\n\n-Lt. Col. Ben Sala, formerly Bernard Bender, a storm trooper still on the Polish list of war criminals. He is head of the Jewish Department of the Egyptian security service.\n\n- Hassan Soliman, formerly Heinrich Sellmann, wanted by West Germany for crimes committed while he was Gestapo chief in Ulm. He now holds a senior position in the Secret Police in Cairo.\n\n-Col. Ahim Fahumi, formerly Dr. Heinrich Willermann, wanted by West Germany for sterilization experiments he conducted in several Nazi concentration camps. He now runs the Egyptian political prison at Samara, near Alexandria.\n\n- Louis Al-Haj, formerly Louis Heiden, director of a Nazi press agency in Berlin. He is now an adviser to President Nasser and it was he who prepared a pocket-sized Arabic translation of Mein Kampf for Egyptian officers.\n\n- Ibraham Mustafa, formerly Joachim Daemling, wanted by West Germany for crimes committed in Dusseldorf while a storm trooper there. He is an adviser to the Cairo police on concentration camps.\n\n- Ali Mohammed, formerly George Brunner, one of Eichmann's assistants, in charge of deportation of Jews from Greece. He now works in the Egyptian propaganda industry.l The list goes on and on. The Arabs, by raising a \"Nazi issue,\" convict only themselves.\n\nIN WORLD WAR II, 1,300,000 Jews were in uniform in the Allied Armies. In Palestine, 85,800 Jewish men and 50,400 Jewish women volunteered for war service; 27,028 Palestine Jews served with the British forces in various Middle East, North African and European fronts, many in the most hazardous missions...\n\n(c)\n\nWolfgang G.

Numerous copies were distributed in Tunis. In spring 1942, the German consulate in Tangier reported the \"confiscation\" of several boxes of the brochure by Spanish officials. Files stored in the archives of the Foreign Office in Berlin indicate that the distribution of Barid al-Sharq in the Tangier zone repeatedly caused friction between German officials and the local Spanish administration during the North African campaign. The SS played only a small role in Germany's propaganda efforts targeting the Middle East and North Africa. Perhaps the most significant example was the attempt by SS officers to portray Hitler as a religious figure.\n\n[12]\n\n...beginning of the broadcast to get the attention of Muslim listeners.

DJN, Dec 7, 1962.\n\nDramatic exposes of attempts to internationalize the anti-Semitic movement, an Arab spokesman's brazen appeal to bigotry at the United Nations and the revelations of the extent of the worldwide movement of hate contained in current studies of the issue marked the Week's development in many spheres.\n\nA two-day conference of the World Jewish Congress, held in London last week-end, attended by representatives of 15 European countries, issued an appeal to the United Nations, all democratic governments and religious groups of all denominations to join \"in energetic measures to halt increasing activities by Nazi-Fascist organizations which stir up anti-Semitic and racial hatreds in order to destroy human liberty.\"\n\nProof that \"the heirs and successors\" of Hitler Nazism are attempting to form a worldwide anti-Semitic organization under the temporary leadership of George Lincoln Rockwell, and planning to hold a world congress of Nazi-Fascists in Argentina, was submitted at the United Nations to Sir Muhammad Zafrulla Khan, president of the General Assembly, in the form of a photo-copy letter from Rockwell, leader of the American Nazi Party, by Dr. Maurice L. Perlzweig, head of the World Jewish Congress department of international affairs.\n\nThe Rockwell letter, dated last Oct. 3, written on swastika-emblazoned stationery of the American Nazi Party, and concluded with \"Heil Hitler,\" was addressed to three persons in Buenos Aires, identified as Ferreyra, Dubrow and Muller, of the Argentine National Socialist Front.\n\nRockwell took over world leadership of the Nazi movement this fall, when Colin Jordan, British leader of the movement, was jailed for a nine-month term after being convicted of violating Britain's Public Order Act through the holding of anti-Semitic demonstrations.\n\nWhile these revelations were taking place, there was a shocking demonstration of bigotry at a session of the Special Political Committee of the General Assembly of the United Nations, at which an Arab spokesman resorted to the vilest type of venom against the Jews. So revolting was his speech that even delegates from other Arab nations have begun to favor a move for that bigot's expulsion from the international body.\n\nThe move for the recall by Saudi Arabia of its permanent representative to the UN, Ahmad Shukairy, appeared to be under way with Arab diplomats heading the drive. The desire for Shukairy's removal from the UN scene, long contemplated by more moderate Arabs here, gained heavy impetus after the official Saudi Arabian spokesman declared openly a \"salute\" to the anti-Semitic Tacuara movement in Argentina and proposed that the UN \"adopt\" the Tacuara movement.\n\nShukairy's salute to the \"Tacuara\" movement was voiced Friday before the General Assembly's Special Political Committee which is currently debating the Arab issue. Lucio Garcia del Solar, Argentine representative in the committee, immediately objected to the Shukairy \"salute,\" telling the United Nations that his people and government reject everything that Tacuara advocates.\n\nEmbarrassed Arab diplomats, annoyed for many years by Shukairy's intemperate attacks against Israel and Jews, let it be known that they are asking the Saudi government to take Shukairy away from the UN. Some of the Arab diplomats apologized personally not only to Argentinians here but also to other Latin Americans, volubly assuring all that they felt Shukairy had gone much too far in his anti-Israeli drive by endorsing an open neo-Nazi movement like Tacuara.\n\nA sharp protest - against Shukairy's endorsement of Tacuara was received by Dr. Leopoldo Benites of Ecuador, chairman of the committee in which Shukairy called for the \"adoption\" of Tacuara, from Label A. Katz, president of Bnai Brith, who visited Argentina last summer and probed into the neo-Nazi movement there.\n\nThe World Jewish Congress conference in London at which the appeal was issued for worldwide action was summoned to examine the revival of Nazi-Fascist anti-Semitism in various parts of the world.\n\nThe conference also mapped an action program, including legislative, educational and similar actions in cooperation with church groups and humanitarian organizations \"to curb Nazi-Fascist activities.\"...\n\n(b)\n\nSociological Abstracts.

It is econ'ly strong & was reinforced by immigration in the 30's & 40's.\n\nUnder Peron it had a great deal of influence in the armed forces; after his fall it was reinforced by Nazi refugees.\n\nThe neo-Nazis have worked together with the native nat'lists who organized a pogrom as early as Dec 1918. Since the fall of Peron the nat'lists have started terrorist org's of an ultra-nat'list & anti-Jewish character. The chief anti-Jewish org's are analyzed: the Nat'l Socialist Movement (neo-Nazi), the Tacuara Nat'list Movement (nat'list) & the Reconstructionist Nat'list Guard (aristocratic & ultra-Catholic); also the Nazi influence in the Argentine armed forces, \"on the increase over the last 2 yrs.\" However, \"the most important neo-Nazi front org today is the Arab League\" led by a pro-Nazi Arab, Triki. One of his creations is the \"Aryan Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.\"\n\nThe Argentines' recent pol'al & econ troubles make the Jews ideal scapegoats. There has been a recent recrudescence of anti-Semitic activities & assaults on Jews which the gov has done little or nothing to stop.\n\nIt is concluded: \"Since the time of writing, in Dec 1964, no signif. changes have ensued in Argentina.
