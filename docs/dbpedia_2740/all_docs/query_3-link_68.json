        "text": "Racism is based on the idea that there are different human races: the 'white race', the 'black race', the 'yellow race', and the 'red race'. People of the same race are assumed to share certain characteristics.\n\nHitler and the National Socialists (Nazis) also believed that people could be divided into races. And they believed that the races were in competition with each other. According to the Nazis, the Jews were a weak, dangerous, and inferior race that did not belong in Germany.\n\nThe ideas of Hitler and the Nazis were racist. After the Second World War, science showed that the classification of humanity into different races is wrong. There is only one race: the human race.\n\nOther forms of antisemitism may not be racist, or less so. In the past, hatred against Jews was often fuelled by the Christian churches. Throughout the history of Christian Europe and the Islamic world, there have been times when Jews were persecuted. People turned against them, not because they belonged to another 'race', but because they did not believe in the right God.\n\nConclusion: Jews are not a race, and categorising people according to race is wrong and dangerous. Even so, some people still believe in the concept. If it is the basis for their hatred of Jews, it is undoubtedly racist."
