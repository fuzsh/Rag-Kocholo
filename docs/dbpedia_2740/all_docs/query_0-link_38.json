        "text": "History\n\nIt was recognized as a political entity on 20 May 1931 and received juridical personality on 11 January 1932.[11] The movement was formed by Argentine President General JosÃ© FÃ©lix Uriburu officially as a reserve for Argentina's armed forces.[12] The movement's members were authorized to receive military training.[13] The Legion declared itself to be made up of \"patriotic men\" who embodied \"the spirit of the September revolution and who morally and materially were ready to cooperate in the institutional reconstruction of the country\".[14] The Legion was the largest nationalist organization in Argentina in the early 1930s.[15] The movement is known to have committed acts of violence against its political opponents and tortured those that were captured.[16] It collapsed in 1955 after anti-Peronist forces seized control of Argentina with its leader fleeing the country.\n\nIt had a student wing called the Nationalist Union of Secondary Students (UniÃ³n Nacionalista de Estudiantes Secundarios, UNES).[17] Unlike other Argentine nationalist organizations of the time, the Legion had a women's section, while other nationalist groups excluded women from their organizations.[18] The Legion's women section called AgrupaciÃ³n Femenina de la LCA promoted women to love the armed forces and respect for order, authority, and hierarchy in the home and school.[19] These women were to provide aid to the poor to assist in establishing social peace.[20]\n\nDuring the 1946 Argentine elections, the ALN was the largest Nacionalista movement but only gained 25,000 votes in a few areas in which it fielded candidates.[21] This coincided with the election of Juan PerÃ³n as President of Argentina.[22] Following the 1946 election, ALN members attacked the headquarters of several liberal and leftist newspapers, including La Hora, the Communist Party newspaper, as well as attacking a bar in downtown Buenos Aires that was frequented by Spanish republican refugeees.[23]"
