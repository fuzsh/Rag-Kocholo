        "text": "Since the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7th, and Israel’s subsequent bombing and invasion of Gaza, antisemitic incidents have been rising across the world. Governments and civil-society groups in the United States, Europe, Latin America, and Africa have reported a significant increase in attacks against Jewish people and their property. To try to understand these hate crimes, and the historical forces behind antisemitism, I recently spoke by phone with David Feldman, the director of the Birkbeck Institute for the Study of Antisemitism, at Birkbeck College, University of London. During our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, we discussed how different ideological strains of antisemitism coexist and overlap, what makes the latest wave of incidents so disturbing, and whether there are dangers in focussing too much on the Middle East when talking about hatred in America.\n\nWe’ve seen upsurges in antisemitism before. Does this feel similar or different to you?\n\nFrom the U.K., at least, it feels different, and it feels different in two ways. One is that I think the rise in antisemitic incidents recorded by the police over the last three weeks or so, since the 7th of October, has been more dramatic than anything we’ve experienced in the past. And also, as you’ll know, in recent years we’ve had—and not just in the U.K. but in other countries in Europe as well—debates and arguments about how to talk about Israel, the lines between antisemitism and anti-Zionism, and what definitions are helpful. This has been happening since the war in Gaza in 2006. But this war is on a much greater scale, and of course was preceded by a massacre in Israel. Whereas previous instances were chiefly about how we should talk about events going on in Israel-Palestine, the current moment is about responses to dreadful slaughter.\n\nWhat are the different definitions of antisemitism that you alluded to, and how have they featured in these prior debates?\n\nThe International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance adopted its definition of antisemitism in 2016. It was an attempt to distinguish antisemitism from legitimate criticism of Israel—although it spoke about other things, that is what was at its core. I would argue that in its design it narrowed the possibilities for speech. It’s a rather unclear and complicated document. It says that context is important, but it has often been invoked by people in debate to accuse others of antisemitism without reference to context. But it was widely adopted. [The I.H.R.A. definition states that “antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews.” Seven of the eleven examples given make reference to Israel.]\n\nThen, in 2019, a group of people, myself included, began working on what became the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism, which was a response in many ways to the I.H.R.A. definition. The Jerusalem Declaration sought to be clear that anything which denied Jews’ individual or collective rights was antisemitic, and identified narratives and stereotypes which are antisemitic, and which are sometimes invoked in the context of discourse in Israel-Palestine. However, it tried to be much more clear about distinguishing what was antisemitic and what were legitimate criticisms of Israel and claims made in the cause of justice for Palestinians.\n\nThe background to our conversation is what happened on October 7th, and Israel’s response to it. On a basic level of cause and effect, some of these incidents would not have happened without the bombing of Gaza. That being said, I do not want to excuse people committing hate crimes by tracing it back to a cause. After 9/11, there were a lot of people in America who committed hate crimes against Muslims, but I don’t want to blame Osama bin Laden for, say, someone in Wisconsin burning down a mosque.\n\nNo one makes anyone act in an antisemitic way. There’s a difference between comprehending the circumstances in which people act and which lead them to act in particular ways and excusing hate crimes, and I would simply draw the line there. I do think that one of the problems in the current debate, whether it’s over hate crimes outside of Israel or in responses to what happened on the 7th of October, is that some people who seek to explain are then accused of condoning. And, of course, that is what happened to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, in which he both condemned Hamas’s actions but said that those actions did not emerge from a vacuum. So there’s a difference between trying to talk about cause and effect and excusing an action.\n\nHamas arose in a political context of a long-term conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. There’s definitely a context for Hamas, even if we’re horrified by the way they behave. I don’t know what the context is for someone yelling slurs at British Jews in London.\n\nI think that the issue we reach here is the way in which events in Israel and Palestine reverberate and divide people beyond Israel and Palestine. So obviously, as you will know, Jews in the U.K. and elsewhere don’t speak with one voice on this, but mainstream Jewish institutions have lined up quite solidly behind Israel’s actions and policies since the 7th of October. So there is a way in which mainstream Jews in the diaspora identify with Israel and are then identified by others with Israel, which I think is simply providing a context in which Jewish buildings are attacked.\n\nSomething awful just happened, which is that the word “Gaza” was daubed in red paint outside the Wiener Holocaust Library, which is a library and archive dedicated to the study of the Holocaust. There’s no way in which that is a legitimate action, but clearly whoever was performing that action identified the building as one associated with Jews, and he associated Jews with the support for the State of Israel. This is me speaking, if you like, as an academic. And in that context, it seems to me that either we give up or we try to understand why people are acting the way they’re acting. Otherwise, the humanities are not really serving a useful purpose.\n\nI’m just not sure the type of people who commit hate crimes really care that mainstream Jewish organizations do or do not line up with Israel. I feel like hate crimes may be happening separately from that context, that those may be two trains running on parallel tracks, but they’re not actually connected.\n\nYeah.\n\nEspecially with something like antisemitism or any sort of bigotry, I do wonder if looking at proximate causes misses something.\n\nYeah. In a sense, the answer to your question is that we don’t know. But, in some ways, I suggest the reverse of what you said is likely to be the case. In normal times, there are a good deal of hate crimes which take place, and which are akin to hooliganism. Someone sees a person looking visibly Jewish in the street and they pick on them. This is a known phenomenon. But if one looks at the example that I just gave of someone daubing “Gaza” on the wall of a library and archive dedicated to the Holocaust, if one looks at people throwing Molotov cocktails at a synagogue, for example, then I think one does need to look at the immediate context.\n\nIt’s telling when people choose to focus on root causes and when they don’t, and it often shows where their sympathies lie.\n\nSure, I can understand that. And it’s certainly very important to use the same criteria and approaches for all hate crimes across the board. One wouldn’t want to try to explain hate crimes against Jews in the ways that we’ve been discussing but not do so for hate crimes against the other groups. And I agree with you that on some occasions people pick and choose.\n\nBut hate crimes aren’t really what I do and what I think about, as perhaps is a bit obvious. Fundamentally, I’m a historian, and I can place what we’re thinking about today in terms of antisemitism in some sort of historical context. I’m not particularly comfortable with the focus on the causality of hate crimes. That’s not because it’s not a set of legitimate questions; they are, and I think you are raising important issues, but it’s not really what I do.\n\nGoing back to the different definitions of antisemitism, and a way of putting the present moment in some sort of context—I think Jews arguing over what is and what is not antisemitism is not new, and what Jews mean by antisemitism is something which has changed over time. These debates are the latest iteration of a long history, which goes back to when the word antisemitism came into common usage, which was in the eighteen-eighties.\n\nWhen it first came into common usage, certainly in Western Europe, it had a much more restricted meaning than it’s come to have since. Then, the antisemitic movement was a real German movement, which called itself the Anti-Semitic League. And they brought into question civil equality for Jews. Antisemitism was widely understood to be about that. It was about the idea that Jews should not enjoy equality with other subjects.\n\nNow, one of the extraordinary consequences is that the pogroms in Russia were not spoken of as antisemitic in the West. They were barbaric, they were medieval, they were uncivilized. But because Jews in Russia did not have rights to be taken away from them, those pogroms didn’t fit the meaning of antisemitism. The point of talking about that is to say that the meaning of antisemitism has changed over time, and our recent debates are just the latest stage in a long history.\n\nSo much of it today is based on Israel, which is not to say that there wouldn’t still be antisemites if there were no Israel. Do you see the post-1948 period as its own period of antisemitism?\n\nO.K., so that’s a really big question.\n\nYou have thirty seconds to answer it.\n\nI’ll do it in the form of a haiku. There are different dimensions to this question. I have written about antisemitism as a reservoir in the culture, something there to be drawn on. And this is a reservoir which has built up over centuries, even over millennia. There are three key elements in this: one is the idea that Judaism has been superseded by Christianity (the notion that Jews have a particularistic and narrow morality is one consequence of that idea); second, the idea that Jews are forever conspiratorial and up to something against the common good; and, third, the connection of Jews with money. These ideas have been repurposed over centuries in multiple political contexts. And we see them repurposed in some of the antisemitic attacks on Israel.\n\nOne thing shown by multiple opinion surveys in the United States, Germany, and in the U.K. and elsewhere, is that the percentage of committed ideological antisemites is relatively small, but the diffusion of negative stereotypes and narratives about Jews through the culture is much higher and much wider. At certain moments, people draw on these, especially at political flash points when these ideas appear to be useful, and when they appear to explain something. Yes, there are antisemites, sort of ideologically committed individuals and groups who have an antisemitic world view, but much more commonplace are individuals who draw on the well of antisemitism within the culture. And that’s what we see in antisemitism around Israel.\n\nToday, there is what I think people would perceive as right-wing antisemitism that you see from Donald Trump’s online followers, and whomever else. There’s left-wing antisemitism, too. And then you have the antisemitism of certain groups in the Middle East, such as Hamas, which I think in an American political context are associated more with the left, but if you actually look at their ideas about, say, gay people, they appear right-wing. Do you think of these different strands of antisemitism as very distinct in some way?\n\nI would want to think about them as being distinct. You have distinct political traditions which draw on a common culture. There is a tradition of writing about antisemitism which simply emphasizes these long continuities. And I think that as a historian, that doesn’t help one understand the particular instances when they arise, and they also can lead one to misunderstand the present moment.\n\nFor example, look at the very understandable description of the events of the massacre of the 7th of October as a pogrom. It’s easy to understand why people draw on Jewish collective memory to describe these events. However, pogroms in Russia and later in Poland took place where Jews were a racialized minority, relatively powerless, vulnerable, and the violence meted out against them was an attempt to put them in their place. The violence meted out against the Israelis was awful. But calling them pogroms does not see the very different context in which they took place, in a state in which Jews are a majority, in which they have state power. In those terms, if one did want to speak about pogroms, one would be looking at the events in the West Bank in Huwara earlier this year.\n\nMaybe this gets to something that’s been complicated about the current rise in antisemitism. After October 7th, all the major Western powers have lined up pretty solidly behind Israel, with the political support for the Jewish people and the Jewish state being incredibly strong. That is one reason that people have trouble grasping the extent of antisemitism. They say, “You’ve got people of both political parties in America supporting Jews, supporting Israel,” and so on and so forth.\n\nIt’s not only that the Western powers have lined up solidly behind Israel—it’s that Western powers in their internal policies are very clear about combating antisemitism. Biden produced his strategic plan to combat antisemitism. In the U.K., the government helps fund security of buildings which house Jewish institutions. It’s helping fund a Holocaust memorial project next to the Houses of Parliament. The German government is very strong in seeking to prevent any recurrence of antisemitism in German society."
