        "text": "Working definition of antisemitism\n\nIn order to begin to address the problem of antisemitism, there must be clarity about what antisemitism is.\n\nIn 2016, the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance adopted the following working definition of antisemitism:\n\n“Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.”\n\nThis working definition is legally non-binding, but is used by the United States Commission on Civil Rights to help universities identify the lines between hateful and non-hateful incidents. It was adopted as a non-binding, working definition in 2016 by the U.S. State Department and the 30 other member states of the IHRA.\n\nThe Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism is another tool to identify, confront and raise awareness about antisemitism as it manifests in countries around the world today. It includes a preamble, definition, and a set of 15 guidelines that provide detailed guidance for those seeking to recognize antisemitism in order to craft responses.\n\nIt was developed as a response to the IHRA definition in 2020 and was initially signed by 210 scholars in the fields of Holocaust history, Jewish studies, and Middle East studies:\n\n”Antisemitism is discrimination, prejudice, hostility or violence against Jews as Jews (or Jewish institutions as Jewish).“\n\nAdditional resources"
