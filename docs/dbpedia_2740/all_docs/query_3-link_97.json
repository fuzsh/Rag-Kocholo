        "text": "Oxford University aims to ensure that all students, whatever their background, have a fulfilling experience of higher education. To support us in our work, we have adopted (reflecting the position of the Office for Students) the IHRA definition of antisemitism as a guide to interpreting and understanding antisemitism, noting the clarifications recommended by the Home Affairs Select Committee. The IHRA definition does not affect the legal definition of racial discrimination, so does not change our approach to meeting our legal duties and responsibilities, including the Universityâ€™s commitment to uphold freedom of speech.\n\nThe University has followed the IHRA definition of antisemitism since the Government adopted it in December 2016. Harassment and discrimination of any kind including harassment on racial or religious grounds are totally unacceptable at Oxford University and we have strong policies in place to guard against them."
