        "text": "NEW YORK -- The House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved the Antisemitism Awareness Act Wednesday.\n\nIt comes as campus protests are taking place across the country. While the protests have the support of many Jewish college students, many others have said they feel intimidated and unsafe.\n\nThe Antisemitism Awareness Act could make it easier for concerned students to file civil rights complaints.\n\nRead the Antisemitism Awareness Act (.pdf)\n\nCBS New York spoke with Reps. Mike Lawler and Josh Gottheimer, two sponsors of the bipartisan bill.\n\n\"We need to be able to define antisemitism,\" Lawler said.\n\nThe bill put forth by Republican Lawler and Democrat Gottheimer aims to do just that.\n\nInternational Holocaust Remembrance Alliance defines antisemitism\n\nThe Antisemitism Awareness Act directs the Department of Education to use the definition promulgated by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance when enforcing federal anti-discrimination laws.\n\n\"Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews,\" the definition says.\n\nIt goes on to define examples of antisemitism, and some of the heated rhetoric heard on college campuses lately would be included.\n\n\"When you hear 'From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,' that is calling for the eradication of Jews and the state of Israel,\" Lawler said.\n\n\"All of our colleges have a responsibility to protect against hate and discrimination. There's a difference between speech which should be protected and harassment and violence and intimidation, like a death threat,\" Gottheimer said.\n\nColleges that fail to protect Jewish students could face civil rights enforcement.\n\nWhat about legitimate criticism of Israel?\n\nCritics of the new legislation, including Rep. Jerry Nadler, of New York, say the bill sweeps too broadly and would chill constitutionally protected free speech, including legitimate criticism of Israel.\n\nHowever, others say speech has limits and some of the rhetoric crosses the line into harassment.\n\nOmer Granot-Lubaton, a graduate student at Columbia University, said, \"A lot of people come to me, 'Well, maybe they don't understand what they're saying.' Those people are educated adults, going to the best institutions in the world. They should know what they say.\"\n\nThe bill still needs to pass the Senate and be signed by President Joe Biden to become law."
