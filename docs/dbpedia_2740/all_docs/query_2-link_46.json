        "text": "Summary\n\nThis report covers a pattern of suspicious killings and probable extrajudicial executions by Egyptian Interior Ministry forces of people who at the moment of their deaths apparently posed no life-threatening danger to security forces or others, and so amounted to deliberate and unlawful killings. In all of the cases documented here, the individuals appear to have been in custody prior to being killed and some were forcibly disappeared by National Security Agency forces.\n\nFollowing the military ouster of President Mohamed Morsy in July 2013, and particularly after the August 2013 violent dispersal of the pro-Morsy Rab’a sit-in when security forces killed at least 817 protesters in one day, Egypt witnessed a sharp rise in violent attacks by an array of armed Islamist groups, against security forces, government facilities, and civilians. Government and Interior Ministry statements almost always blamed these attacks on the Muslim Brotherhood, one of Egypt’s oldest and largest Islamist organization to which Morsy belonged and which was outlawed in 2013 following the military takeover.\n\nUnder the pretext of combating terrorism, President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi’s government has effectively given the Interior Ministry’s police and National Security Agency free rein to suppress all opposition, including peaceful dissent, with near-absolute impunity for grave abuses. The result has been one of the worst prolonged human rights crises in the country’s recent history. Much of the reporting by human rights groups and investigative journalists has focused on the extralegal killings of peaceful protesters, mass arbitrary arrests, forced disappearances, and ill-treatment and torture in custody. This report looks at the suspicious killings and the probable extrajudicial executions of detained persons, most of whom had been in secret detention.\n\nBetween January 2015 and December 2020, according to 123 Interior Ministry statements and pro-government media reports citing unnamed security officials, security forces killed at least 755 alleged “militants” or “terrorists” in 143 alleged shootouts or gun battles in 19 governorates across the country. In most of these statements the authorities said those killed were members of the Muslim Brotherhood. Thirty-one of these incidents, involving the killings of 297 alleged militants, were in Egypt’s North Sinai. Human Rights Watch has previously documented extrajudicial killings in North Sinai and this report focuses only on mainland Egypt. These incidents proliferated after President al-Sisi in June 2015 called for “swift justice” following major violent attacks.\n\nThis report documents the suspicious and probable extrajudicial execution of 14 individuals in 9 alleged shootout incidents in mainland Egypt in which, according to Interior Ministry statements, security forces killed a total of 75 men of whom only 21 were named. Human Rights Watch examined the Interior Ministry’s statements regarding these 9 incidents, including analysis of the few photographs and videos available, and interviews with acquaintances or family members of 14 of those killed. All evidence indicates that these were probable extrajudicial executions.\n\nThe Interior Ministry statements rarely contained any meaningful information about the circumstances of these incidents, and only occasionally provided photographs or even names of those killed. “Security forces dealt with the source of fire” or “security forces dealt with them,” was the justification cited for the overwhelming majority of these killings. The statements typically claimed that security forces, based on intelligence gathered by the National Security Agency, were approaching a “terrorist hideout” when the alleged militants opened fire, requiring security forces to return fire. The result in almost every case was the deaths of all the alleged suspects. Human Rights Watch’s analysis of the 123 official and quasi-official statements found that only one suspect was reported to have been captured alive in the 143 alleged shootouts while security forces casualties (47 wounded and 5 killed) were reported in only 10 of those alleged gun battles.\n\nOperating with near-total impunity and lack of scrutiny of any sort, the Interior Ministry appeared not to care much whether its statements were convincing. They were often suspiciously pro-forma and sometimes incoherent. In one incident documented in this report, a pro-government newspaper had reported the arrest of a man and his subsequent interrogation over a week before the Interior Ministry subsequently claimed its forces killed him in a shootout. In another incident, the Interior Ministry announced the arrest of nine unnamed suspects of what they called the “special operations unit” of the Muslim Brotherhood in the morning, and in the evening said nine unnamed “terrorists” of the same unit were killed in a shootout.\n\nFor a multitude of reasons, including the government’s severe restrictions on independent reporting, relentless efforts to silence human rights groups, and the lack of independence and inefficiency of Egypt’s prosecution authorities in investigating the alleged shootouts, it is not possible to reach definite conclusions about many of these killings. However, Human Rights Watch found that the incidents documented in this report establish a clear pattern of apparently unlawful extrajudicial executions, in many cases of detainees who had previously been forcibly disappeared or who at the time of the killing posed no imminent danger to security forces or others.\n\nIn all nine alleged shootouts examined in this report, the statements did not indicate that any member of the security forces was killed or wounded. Members of eight of the 14 families said they saw what they believed were signs of abuse on the bodies of their killed relatives. In all 14 cases, family members said their killed relatives had been arrested and were in the custody of security agencies before the incidents in which they were reportedly killed. Eight of the 14 families said they or other people, including friends or acquaintances, had witnessed the arrest. Thirteen of the 14 families said their relative had been forcibly disappeared and that they had officially inquired about their whereabouts before their killing. Twelve families said they sent telegrams or letters to authorities, frequently the Interior Ministry or prosecution. Human Rights Watch reviewed copies of the telegrams in six of the cases.\n\nOnly one family said that the police informed them about the killing of their relative the next day; all the other 13 families said they received no official notice or information at any point. All the families but one said they had to actively seek information about the deaths and the location of the bodies of their relatives. The family of one man was only able to collect his body after two months, and families of two of those killed have not been able to collect their bodies since December 2018. At least 11 families said National Security officers intimidated and harassed them when they tried to locate the bodies of their relatives. Seven families said security forces escorted them from the morgue to the burial site to force them to bury their relatives without any funeral service, fearing that the family would photograph the body or that the funeral would turn into a spontaneous protest.\n\nNo family received a forensic or autopsy report or any further documents or information from the authorities about the circumstances of the killings or alleged shootouts, even though nine of the bodies appeared to have been dissected for autopsy. Authorities called none of the families to have a representative present during autopsy. Five families said they had still not received the death certificates as of time of writing.\n\nHuman Rights Watch found no record that authorities have opened any serious or meaningful investigations into any of the incidents documented in this report. All families said they had not been summoned for questioning as possible witnesses or otherwise requested to provide information that would indicate that any serious investigation was opened.\n\nOnly one family said their killed relative probably had been involved in armed activity. All the other families said their relatives had not been engaged in violence or political activity. Two families said their two relatives were killed during a journey to flee persecution in Egypt via its southern border with Sudan.\n\nFrom official statements and the families’ accounts, it appears that the victims in these killings were men whom the security agencies believed belonged to, assisted, or financed violent, armed groups that emerged in the aftermath of the 2013 military coup such as Hasm and Liwa’ al-Thawra, regardless of evidence, and which the authorities said were armed branches of the Muslim Brotherhood. Analysis of the photographs and videos in three cases demonstrates the absence of evidence supporting the Interior Ministry’s narrative and that bodies had been moved before being photographed. Three other photographs analyzed, including one concerning a case documented in this report, the hands of three deceased men that appear to have been restrained or cuffed immediately before their death. Another photo shows that a gun appeared to have been placed next to one of the men to stage a shootout. Arbitrary arrests and enforced disappearances violate international law and Egypt’s constitution, which requires that all detainees be brought before a prosecutor within 24 hours. Egyptian laws do not explicitly define enforced disappearance, and insufficiently define and punish torture.\n\nThe right to life is an inherent non-derogable human right, regardless of the circumstances, even in times of armed conflict or states of emergency. Summary, extrajudicial, or arbitrary executions are clearly prohibited under international law, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights, to which Egypt is a state party.\n\nExcept for brief periods between 2012 and 2017, Egyptian security forces have been operating for four decades, since 1981, under a nationwide state of emergency as Egypt’s draconian emergency law grants them unchecked powers. Since 2013, new laws further normalized abuses and lack of accountability in violation of the most basic international norms and standards. The 2015 counterterrorism law, for instance, includes an overly broad, abusive, definition of terrorism. It also gives security personnel full discretion to use force without judicial oversight, and immunizes them from criminal investigation even in cases where this use results in loss of life.\n\nIn the incidents documented in this report, Egyptian authorities failed to present any evidence or records indicating that use of lethal force was required. All available evidence suggests the contrary. Even when an exchange of fire may be justified, there are clear restrictions and obligations that Egyptian security forces appear to have violated.\n\nUnder international law, such as the 1990 UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials, the use of potentially lethal force such as firearms is an “extreme measure” that should be only considered when “strictly necessary in order to protect life or prevent serious injury from an imminent threat.” It cannot, for example, be lawfully used to prevent the escape of a suspect or convict if that person did not pose an imminent threat. When unavoidable, officers should only use firearms with a view to “minimize damage and injury, and respect and preserve human life.” Officers should also ensure that medical aid is provided to wounded individuals as soon as possible. In none of the incidents documented in this report did the Interior Ministry say it had ordered ambulance services.\n\nGiven the potentially grave consequences of the use of lethal force, the UN Basic Principles require that law enforcement officials report in detail, and in a timely fashion, details of incidents in which officers used firearms and killed or wounded others. Such reporting includes ensuring that “relatives or close friends of the injured or affected person are notified at the earliest possible moment.”\n\nAccording to the Basic Principles and other instruments of international law, in all cases involving use of firearms by officials persons affected and, in case of death, families of the deceased “shall have access to an independent process, including a judicial process.” Regarding the incidents investigated in this report, the authorities permitted families little or no access to police or forensic reports, relevant documents or information, or independent judicial or administrative redress mechanisms. Photographs that the Interior Ministry occasionally published of the alleged shootout scenes appeared to show that bodies of the deceased had been moved and that the basic elements of preserving the crime scene were not met.\n\nThe 2016 updated UN Manual on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions, widely known as the Minnesota Protocol, offers step-by-step guidelines and principles that governments should apply in investigating any potentially unlawful deaths.\n\nAccording to the protocol’s guidelines, the duty to investigate is “triggered” not only in a clear case of unlawful death, but also where there are “reasonable allegations of a potentially unlawful death.” The duty to investigate is applicable even if authorities do not receive a formal complaint. For persons in detention centers, as at least nine of the individuals whose killings are documented in this report appear to have been, the Protocol states: “Owing to the control exercised by the State over those it holds in custody, there is a general presumption of state responsibility in such cases… .”\n\nOf relevance to the cases of killings documented in this report is the obligation of the authorities to identify, summon, and interview all possible witnesses. This should include door-to-door visits and inquiries in the area surrounding the killings and any other physical location of importance to the investigation.\n\nSteps the Egyptian authorities have taken concerning the killings documented in this report do not even begin to comply with the most basic elements of the protocol’s guidelines, even in the most superficial sense. The Interior Ministry almost always claimed that any investigations into alleged shootouts were handled by the Supreme State Security Prosecution (SSSP), the branch of the general prosecution that typically rubber-stamps security forces’ allegations and almost never investigates accounts of torture or enforced disappearance.\n\nThe Prosecutor General should remove the SSSP from overseeing investigations into possible security forces abuses. President al-Sisi should direct the Justice Ministry to create an independent committee with sufficient resources and authority to promptly carry out thorough and impartial investigations into all killings by Interior Ministry forces including possible extrajudicial executions.\n\nThis report should be read in the context of previous reporting by Human Rights Watch and other groups, providing evidence of the continuing grave abuses committed by authorities in Egypt, particularly by the Interior Ministry and its National Security Agency, including systematic, widespread arbitrary detentions, enforced disappearances, and torture.\n\nHuman Rights Watch calls on the UN Human Rights Council to establish an independent international mechanism to monitor and report on the human rights situation in Egypt, and to investigate grave human rights violations and security forces’ abuses including but not limited to extrajudicial executions, torture, and enforced disappearances.\n\nGiven the level of abuses by Egypt’s Interior Ministry and military forces, documented in this and previous reports, including in North Sinai, Egypt’s international partners should halt all security and military assistance and weapons transfers to the Egyptian government and condition their resumption on an end to grave human rights abuses and transparent investigations of serious crimes. They should also impose targeted sanctions on officials and entities responsible for such ongoing abuses, and where possible, investigate them under universal jurisdiction principles.\n\nRecommendations\n\nThe recommendations detailed here are meant to address, ensure accountability for, and deter the serious human rights abuses documented in this report and previously documented ongoing systematic abuses, including enforced disappearances and torture.\n\nTo President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi\n\nDirect the Justice Ministry to create an independent judicial committee, with sufficient resources, independent experts, and authority to carry out thorough, prompt, and impartial investigations into all killings by Interior Ministry forces, including those killed in alleged shootouts and other possible extrajudicial and summary executions, including but not limited to cases involving complaints by families, human rights organizations, or others.\n\nOffer prompt compensation to the families of those summarily or extrajudicially executed.\n\nState publicly that the government does not tolerate and will prosecute those responsible for extrajudicial executions, enforced disappearances, torture, and ill-treatment.\n\nOrder security forces to immediately end extrajudicial and summary executions.\n\nRequest the parliament to ratify the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance and the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and direct the government to establish an independent national body to carry out regular and unannounced visits to all places of detention.\n\nTo the Egyptian Government\n\nPut an immediate end to detention in National Security Agency facilities, including by issuing necessary decrees or passing legislation.\n\nProvide legal training and education to security forces on international standards and laws regulating the law-enforcement use of firearms and prisoners’ rights.\n\nEnd the abusive, prolonged, and nationwide application of the state of emergency. Ensure that any state of emergency is declared only when and where strictly needed.\n\nAccept without further delay all pending visit requests by United Nations human rights mechanisms, including the special rapporteurs on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and, on the promotion and protection of human rights while countering terrorism, as well as the Working Groups on Arbitrary Detention and Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, and take all measures to fully cooperate with their missions and protect everyone they meet from reprisals.\n\nTo Prosecutor General Hamada al-Sawy\n\nOrder prosecutors to fully cooperate with any independent committee created to investigate killings by the Interior Ministry and to ensure the safety of victims, witnesses, and families of victims during and after investigation and trial.\n\nRemove members of the Supreme State Security Prosecution from overseeing any cases related to alleged security forces abuses. Ensure that every investigation is conducted promptly and impartially, and that prosecutors investigate all possible abuses even in the absence of a formal complaint.\n\nAcknowledge publicly the scope of the problems of enforced disappearance, torture, and ill-treatment in Egypt, and commit to implementing a policy of zero tolerance for all forms of arbitrary and unlawful detention.\n\nIssue clear instructions to prosecutors to immediately inform family members of individuals killed in law enforcement operations of the details of what happened, and to have a family member or lawyer present during an autopsy. Issue orders to facilitate families’ collection of the deceased bodies as necessary.\n\nTo the Egyptian Parliament\n\nAmend the Law 162 of 1958 on the State of Emergency to authorize judicial supervision over implementation of all security measures and remove the unchecked, extra-constitutional powers now given to security forces.\n\nThoroughly revise or revoke Law 94 of 2015 for Combating Terrorism to remove officers’ impunity, narrow the definition of terrorism, and comply with international counterterrorism norms.\n\nAmend the Code of Criminal Procedure and the Penal Code to clearly define and penalize unlawful detentions and enforced disappearances.\n\nConvene public parliamentary hearings for the families of those killed in alleged shootouts to explain their grievances and present their accounts.\n\nTo the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, European Union, its Member States, and all of Egypt’s International Partners\n\nImpose targeted sanctions, including asset freezes, against Egyptian officials and entities most responsible for ongoing serious human rights violations, including those documented in this report, as well as officials responsible for continued impunity for such abuses, as provided for under the US Global Magnitsky Sanctions program, the EU Global Human Rights Sanctions Regime, and similar sanctions instruments in the United Kingdom and Canada. These sanctions will be most effective if pursued collectively. The sanctions should include the Interior Ministry’s National Security Agency as entities. Officials who could be sanctioned could include senior ministers, National Security Agency directors, and senior justice officials. Individuals targeted with sanctions should be given due process and clear steps set out that they can take as individuals to have the sanctions lifted.\n\nSuspend all arms sales and provision of counterterrorism and other security-related and dual-use items such as surveillance technology as well as security training or assistance to Egypt, and condition resumption on the authorities’ adopting concrete, verifiable measures to end grave security forces’ abuses documented in this and previous reports and hold perpetrators accountable.\n\nStates that have provided security assistance to Egypt since 2013 should publicly disclose the kinds of assistance; explain how such assistance is consistent with national laws on the provision of military and security assistance (for example, the United Kingdom’s Overseas Justice and Security Assistance Policy and the US’s Arms Export Control Act and Leahy Laws, and the 2008 Common European Position on control of military equipment exports); and state what steps they have taken to mitigate risks of complicity in human rights abuses.\n\nStates that have provided military or security assistance to Egypt in recent years should have in place effective mechanisms for monitoring the end use of those weapons and programs, and whether any police or army units who received trainings from these states have been involved in serious abuses.\n\nPress the Egyptian authorities to allow unhindered access in the country for independent human rights monitors and journalists and allow them to conduct their work without fear of retaliation for themselves or people they meet.\n\nSupport efforts at the UN Human Rights Council to establish an independent monitoring and reporting mechanism on grave human rights violations in Egypt.\n\nActing where possible under the principle of universal jurisdiction, national judicial authorities should launch broad, structural (preliminary) investigations, without specific suspects, designed to gather evidence related to grave abuses in Egypt which can be used in future criminal proceedings.\n\nUnder the principle of universal jurisdiction and in accordance with national laws and where evidence allows, investigate and prosecute Egyptian security officers and other officials credibly implicated in serious crimes, including enforced disappearances, torture, or extrajudicial executions, as well as superiors who knew or should have known about such crimes and did not take all necessary and reasonable measures in their power to prevent their commission or to punish those responsible.\n\nTo the UN Human Rights Council\n\nEstablish without further delay an independent international mechanism to monitor and report on the human rights situation, and to investigate grave human rights violations in Egypt, including enforced disappearances, torture, and extrajudicial executions. The mechanism should be mandated to establish the facts and identify those responsible with a view to ensuring that perpetrators of violations are held accountable, as well as to collect and preserve information related to these abuses for future use by credible judicial institutions. Ensure that the mandate is sufficiently broad to cover future and past serious abuses at least since July 2013.\n\nTo the UN Office of Counter-Terrorism, UN Counter-Terrorism Executive Directorate, UN Office of Drugs and Crime, and other UN Entities\n\nWithhold funding for counterterrorism programs run by the Egyptian Interior Ministry, military, or other security-related agencies or units until concrete measures are taken to prevent and investigate abuses.\n\nDisqualify the Egyptian government from eligibility to host or co-host any UN conferences or other UN events, pending substantial, measurable improvements in Egypt’s human rights record.\n\nRigorously assess the effects on human rights of Egypt’s counterterrorism measures in country visits by UN entities such as the UN Office of Counter-Terrorism as well as in reviews such as the Universal Periodic Review and the Counter-Terrorism Executive Directorate assessments of member states’ compliance with UN counterterrorism mandates and the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy.\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and Under Secretary-General of the UN Office of Counter-Terrorism Vladimir Voronkov should publicly condemn the failure of Egyptian authorities and security forces to comply with international human rights standards, including while countering terrorism.\n\nTo the African Union (AU) and the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights (ACHPR)\n\nThe AU’s Department for Political Affairs, Peace, and Security, as part of its early warning and conflict prevention mission should place Egypt on its Horizon Scanning briefing on the state of peace and security in Egypt and brief the AU Peace and Security Council periodically about human rights in the country, particularly enforced disappearances, torture, and extrajudicial executions by security forces.\n\nThe Peace and Security Council should review all AU member states’ military and security arrangements with Egypt, embargo arms exports to the Egyptian army and police, and halt security trainings with Egyptian security forces, and condition resumption on evidence of credible steps to investigate and prosecute serious crimes, including extrajudicial executions.\n\nIn lieu of the Commission’s 297 Resolution of 2015 on the deteriorating human rights situation in Egypt, the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights should adopt a new resolution condemning escalating abuses in Egypt, including extrajudicial executions, and the Special Rapporteur for Egypt should request a country visit to assess the extent to which the government has ACHPR Resolution 297.\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this report, Human Rights Watch created a database of 165 official and quasi-official statements made by the Interior Ministry and pro-government media about shootout incidents between January 2015 and December 2020. Of those statements, 123 concerned shootouts with armed men whom the government invariably described in terms such as “terrorists” or “militants.”\n\nTo identify these statements Human Rights Watch monitored the Interior Ministry’s official accounts on Twitter and Facebook and used key terms such as “terrorism,” “terrorists,” or “hideout” to search for and find older posts. Human Rights Watch did not include statements about security raids that did not report a shooting. Human Rights Watch also used the aforementioned key words to find statements in government and pro-government media that were not published on the official Interior Ministry social media pages. This report does not include militants or security personnel killed in major attacks by armed militants on security forces.\n\nHuman Rights Watch investigated nine of the alleged shootout incidents that took place in mainland Egypt (excluding the Sinai Peninsula), in which 75 alleged armed militants were killed. Researchers interviewed 13 relatives or friends of 14 of them. Human Rights Watch also interviewed three human rights lawyers, three human rights activists and a journalist who worked on or covered extrajudicial killings. All the interviews were done remotely, except two, which were conducted in person. Two of the 14 cases were introduced to Human Rights Watch by We Record, a human rights group, and the two interviews concerning those two cases were conducted jointly with an Istanbul-based researcher with We Record. Human Rights Watch reviewed media reports and investigations of the cases by Egyptian human rights groups.\n\nA Human Rights Watch researcher analyzed 52 photographs and three videos concerning six individuals killed in three of the nine alleged shootouts. They show the alleged shootout scenes and dead bodies. The government published 35 of them and the rest were provided by activists and family members. This visual evidence was also reviewed by the Independent Forensic Expert Group of the International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims, including Professor Dr. Onder Ozkalipci, the Group’s steering committee member and a forensic physician, Professor James Lin, the Group’s coordinator and a legal and forensic expert, and by Stefan Schmitt, International Forensic Manager of the National Forensic Science and Technology Center at Florida International University and former director of the International Forensic Program at Physicians for Human Rights.\n\nThis report also highlights and includes additional research into the probable extrajudicial execution of 10 detainees in two separate incidents in mainland Egypt in 2015 that Human Rights Watch had documented in previous reports.\n\nHuman Rights Watch on two occasions sent detailed questions to Interior Minister Mahmoud Tawfiq and Prosecutor General Hamada al-Sawy, on April 27 and May 11 2021. Copies of the letters were also sent to the State Information Service, the National Council for Human Rights, and the spokesperson of the Egyptian cabinet. At the time of publication, the authorities had not responded. The letters are in the annex of the report.\n\nAll interviewees have been given pseudonyms and some personal details were omitted because of security considerations. Egyptian authorities have routinely harassed, intimidated, arrested, and sometimes prosecuted witnesses to serious human rights abuses.\n\nAll persons interviewed were informed of the purpose of the interview, its voluntary nature, and the ways in which the information would be used. Human Rights Watch conducted the remote interviews using encrypted applications, wherever possible, to ensure the security of interviewees. None of those interviewed received monetary or other incentives for speaking with Human Rights Watch. All interviews were conducted in Arabic.\n\nI. Background\n\nWidespread suspicious and extrajudicial killings are not unprecedented in Egypt’s recent history. From the late 1980s through the late 1990s, when the government confronted rising Islamist armed militancy, the Interior Ministry arrested thousands of peaceful as well as violent opponents and was reportedly involved in the extrajudicial killings of alleged Islamist militants. During the decade spanning the late 1980s to the late 1990s, the Interior Ministry killed hundreds of alleged Islamist militants.\n\nIn a 1993 report, Amnesty International wrote:\n\n[M]any of the deaths caused by the police may have been unlawful killings resulting from an excessive and unwarranted use of lethal force. Indeed, some killings bear the hallmarks of extrajudicial executions - deliberate killings of people who posed no violent threat at the time they were\n\nshot dead.\n\nIn a 1995 report on hostage-taking by security forces, Human Rights Watch reported a number of cases of possible extrajudicial executions in what appeared to be staged shootouts. Some 20 years later, in 2016, Mohamed Tha’lab, a former deputy interior minister, in a BBC documentary about violence under former President Hosni Mubarak, claimed that minister Zaki Badr, who led the ministry from 1986 to 1990, had effectively endorsed a ministry policy of extrajudicial executions:\n\nBadr did not want defendants. Defendants would have to be presented to prosecutors and might complain about having been torture and so on. As long as they [the militants] are fighting, kill them. It’s a war.\n\nIn the same documentary, well-known former general and security analyst Fouad Allam, who was also the deputy director of the State Security Investigations (SSI, the name of the National Security Agency until 2011), said that there were orders at the time to “shoot them in the heart,” referring to Islamist armed militants. “They [security] carried out assassinations of members of the [Islamist] groups,” he added.\n\nKillings of alleged armed militants largely subsided in the late 1990s, after the Islamist group al-Gama’a al-Islamiya renounced violence and security agencies had suppressed and dismantled violent Islamist groups.\n\nThe Massacres of 2011 and 2013\n\nMore than 10 years after the violent events of the 1990s, and during the 18 days of the 2011 nationwide uprising against President Hosni Mubarak, Interior Ministry security forces killed hundreds of peaceful protesters. Following Mubarak’s ouster, and faced with public euphoria and demands for accountability, Mubarak’s immediate successors, his own military generals, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, created an interim government and allowed superficial investigations into some of these killings, but almost all the soldiers and officers prosecuted for killing demonstrators were acquitted in court proceedings that lacked any serious efforts to produce evidence and to hold perpetrators accountable.\n\nSecurity and military forces continued to kill protesters in the months following Mubarak’s ouster with impunity. But the worst was yet to come. General Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, then minister of defense, oversaw the largest mass killings of protesters in Egypt’s recent history in August 2013. The military had just overthrown the elected president, Mohamed Morsy, in July 2013, and imprisoned him and his main advisers. On August 14 that year, the military and the police moved to violently disperse tens of thousands of individuals who gathered in Cairo’s Rab’a Square and elsewhere to protest Morsy’s removal. Over the course of July and August, security forces killed over 1,150 protesters, including at least 817 in Rab’a Square alone.\n\nA year after the massacre, in June 2014, al-Sisi became president, winning 96.1 percent of the electoral vote that lacked any meaningful competition.\n\nIn the years since, al-Sisi’s government has faced violent attacks by armed political groups against security forces and civilians. Grave abuses became “normal” daily news. In the following months, security forces killed hundreds and abducted, disappeared, and tortured thousands of protesters and dissidents. Members and sympathizers of the Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt’s oldest and largest Islamist organization, with offshoots throughout the Arab world and the group to which Morsy belonged, were the main target for security forces despite, in many cases, not presenting evidence of the individuals’ involvement in violence. Soon arbitrary arrests, abductions, and forcible disappearances victimized men and women from all walks of life, including journalists, academics, human rights defenders, and social media critics. Since 2015 the repression has included hundreds of gay and trans people and LGBT activists, and women social media influencers whom the government viewed as “immoral.”\n\nEnforced Disappearances\n\nOne of the gravest abuses of al-Sisi’s security forces has been widespread enforced disappearances. At one level this has been a tactic to terrorize critics and dissidents and sharply raise the cost of criticizing the government. Security officers have also wanted to ensure they can extract information and coerce video-recorded confessions without even a semblance of judicial or public scrutiny. Human Rights Watch and other organizations have documented how, under al-Sisi’s government, the Interior Ministry’s National Security Agency in particular forcibly disappeared and tortured detainees to extract information or confessions, or to punish them, on a scale that likely amounts to crimes against humanity.\n\nAn example of the security mentality justifying the practice of enforced disappearance are the words of a National Security Agency officer to a detainee he interrogated while forcibly disappeared for weeks in mid-2015:\n\nIf the public knows that an individual was arrested with us, they will campaign for his release and claim he is innocent. We will come under pressure and will not be able to work.\n\nSuch a mentality, effectively viewing the rule of law as incompatible with security, was reflected in statements by President al-Sisi himself on June 30, 2015, in response to the assassination of Public Prosecutor Hisham Barakat a day earlier. “The hand of justice is chained by laws,” he said, adding that “we will amend the laws to achieve swift justice.” Clearly referring to imprisoned Brotherhood leaders, al-Sisi said, “They are giving the orders from their prison cells.”\n\nLess than two days following Barakat’s assassination, security forces carried out what appeared to be the extrajudicial killings of nine high-profile, detained Muslim Brotherhood leaders. The incident received significant media coverage. Security officers arrested several journalists who tried to visit the building where the killings took place. The coverage this incident received may have been a reason that security agencies have avoided easily accessible locations in subsequent alleged shootouts.\n\nSix weeks later, on August 15, 2015, al-Sisi decreed a counterterrorism law that gives security personnel immunity from any criminal investigation for any use of lethal force during operations. Further reflecting a mentality that problematizes the rule of a law, al-Sisi said a month later, in September 2015, that the 2014 constitution “was written in good will. But countries are not built by good will alone.”\n\nSuspicious Killings\n\nSince July 2015, Egypt has witnessed a spree of suspicious killings by security forces. The Interior Ministry released more than 123 statements claiming its forces killed “terrorists,” “ikhwanis” (members of the Muslim Brotherhood), “suspects” or “militants” in hideouts. Many families of those killed told journalists and human rights groups that their relatives had previously been arrested and forcibly disappeared. In some cases the Interior Ministry claimed that those killed in a “shootout” were responsible for a specific armed attack, but weeks or months later would announce the arrest or the “shootout” deaths of another group of alleged militants, claiming they were responsible for the same attack.\n\nThe killings of previously detained persons have been difficult to document and received little media coverage because of government restrictions on human rights work and investigative reporting, the Interior Ministry’s practice of shrouding its operations in secrecy, and the failure of the Egyptian judiciary to exercise its duty to investigate abuses.\n\nIt appears that the main victims in these numerous “shootouts” have been men whom the security agencies believed, in many cases apparently without evidence, to have belonged to, assisted, or financed Islamist armed groups. Following Morsy’s ouster, and particularly following the Rab’a massacre, Egypt witnessed a sharp rise in attacks on security forces, government facilities, and civilians by Islamist armed groups including those affiliated with al-Qaeda and the Islamic State (ISIS). These groups have been most active in North Sinai, where the Egyptian security forces and military have been battling an ISIS affiliate since 2013.\n\nApart from ISIS and al-Qaeda, other smaller Islamist armed groups emerged and claimed violent attacks in mainland Egypt, most prominently al-‘Eqab al-Thawry (Revolutionary Punishment) in February 2015, Hasm (an acronym for the Arms of Egypt Movement) in July 2016, and Liwa’ al-Thawra (Revolution Brigade) in August 2016. These groups and others have been responsible for attacks that killed and wounded dozens of police and military officers and soldiers, as well as civilians, and destroyed public property, particularly between late 2013 and 2018. They have only occasionally acknowledged the affiliation of or publicly mourned any members killed in the alleged shootouts.\n\nThe discourse of these smaller groups invoked the 2013 military coup and abuses by security forces as their main grievances, rather than claiming they were fighting a broader battle to establish an “Islamic Caliphate” or goals similar to those articulated by ISIS or al-Qaeda. Furthermore, they published statements diverging from the position of ISIS and al-Qaeda that Egypt’s leaders and officers are kuffar (non-believers) who should be fought for that reason. Some of these groups, particularly Hasm and Liwa’ al-Thawra, denounced attacks against Christians in an apparent attempt to distance themselves from other armed Islamists, claiming that they were only targeting security forces. Security and political analysts, including some who are close the Brotherhood, believe that many of the members and leaders of these newer, smaller groups in mainland Egypt possibly had links to or broke off from the Muslim Brotherhood after 2013 as they became dissatisfied with the group’s political strategy and leadership that historically renounced violence in the 1970s. In the years following the coup, the Brotherhood leaders and figures, at best, gave contradictory statements regarding violence; its leadership was clearly divided and fragmented as an overwhelming number of its first- and second-tier leaders were forced into prisons or exile.\n\nIn January 2018, the United States government designated Hasm and Liwa’ al-Thawra as terrorist organizations under the Specially Designated Global Terrorists Act. This followed the designation of Ajnad Masr as a terrorist group in December 2014.\n\nThe Egyptian government in its official statements labeled all these newer groups as “special operations units,” referring to what they alleged to be an “armed wing” of the Muslim Brotherhood, as if they were all one and the same. The government moved swiftly in late 2013 to officially designate the Brotherhood, which had hundreds of thousands of members, as a terrorist organization in order to justify its nationwide crackdown against anyone with the slightest alleged connection to the group.\n\nThe Interior Ministry statements announcing the killings of alleged armed “militants” or “terrorists” usually named the Brotherhood (Ikhwan), Hasm, and other groups interchangeably. Even from an intelligence standpoint, a distinction between those who supported violent opposition and those who did not was apparently immaterial for the government’s purpose of using counterterrorism to criminalize all forms of dissent, including peaceful activism.\n\nThe government has used terrorism allegations to arbitrarily arrest, detain, forcibly disappear, and torture activists and dissidents across the political spectrum including journalists, academics and human rights defenders. Those whom security agencies believed were members or supporters of the Brotherhood or other Islamist groups faced another risk in detention – extrajudicial killing.\n\n“Be careful, if you join one of these cells, you won’t get any help from the judicial system,” an unnamed Western security official monitoring the situation from Cairo told the Wall Street Journal. The Egypt chapters in the US State Department annual human rights country reports have noted reports on extrajudicial executions since at least 2017.\n\nIn 2017, 2018, and 2019, Human Rights Watch documented the probable extrajudicial executions of forcibly disappeared detainees in war-torn North Sinai where the military and police have been battling an ISIS-affiliated group called Wilayat Sina’. This includes a report in March 2017 documenting the probable extrajudicial killings of at least four, and as many as ten, men in al-Arish, in which an official video of the alleged security raid appeared to be doctored to cover up the killings. This report focuses only on security forces’ killings in mainland Egypt.\n\n“Your Hands Are Not Tied”\n\nIn recent years, several officials made statements that could be interpreted as implying security forces have “a right” to battle and kill dissidents. Ali Gom’a, Egypt’s former Grand Mufti, the country’s highest religious authority, whose religious opinions (fatwas) are officially sought on many issues including by courts considering death sentences, made statements concerning the killing of Rab’a protesters. In an August 18, 2013 speech in presence of the interior and defense ministers as well as the most senior military and police commanders, just four days after the Rab’a massacre, Gom’a appeared to be referring to those who opposed the forced ouster of President Morsy or “who touch the Egyptian military” as kuffar (nonbelievers) and khawarij (a word used to refer to an Islamic sect that should be fought as illegitimate). Parts of the speech were broadcast on Egypt’s government TV and other alleged parts of the speech, including an apparent call for killings, were leaked in October that year. A statement by Gom’a’s office did not deny he made such statements but claimed he was referring to armed groups in Sinai.\n\nEgypt’s Dar al-Ifta (House of Fatwa) has issued numerous statements describing members of the Muslim Brotherhood as terrorists, kuffar or khawarij and urging the military and police operations to “battle” them. The statements apparently endorse the blanket government crackdown on anyone with links to the Brotherhood, without clarifying in what context such “battling” or killings would be legal from an Islamic point of view and whether, for example, the killings of people in state custody would be legal.\n\nMany of the alleged shootouts were announced by the Interior Ministry a few days, sometimes as soon as a day or two, after attacks that killed or wounded security forces. This was the case in at least six of the alleged shootout killings documented in this report. An element to consider when investigating such killings is the security forces’ rather explicit expression of wanting to “avenge” their killed colleagues. Government officials, including President al-Sisi, have frequently used terms such as “revenge,” “avenge,” “the right of our martyrs,” and “avenging the blood of our martyrs” in their statements.\n\nOn February 1, 2015, al-Sisi addressed hundreds of the most senior military and police leaders. “Our meeting today with you is very important,” he said, and then angrily shouted:\n\nI did not tie your hands seeking revenge for Egypt’s martyrs. Do you understand this? You are the ones who will avenge for Egypt…. I said before your hands are not tied. And they will not be tied.\n\nAl-Sisi made these televised statements two days after Wilayat Sina’ attacks that killed dozens of police and army soldiers and officers in North Sinai. It was just one of many similar calls. On the same day al-Sisi made these remarks, a low-ranking police officer (amin shorta) shot and killed a wounded suspect attacker named Mohamed Atia al-Sayed, whom he was guarding at a Cairo hospital. Al-Sayed had been detained and hospitalized following an alleged shootout a week earlier.\n\nThe governmental National Council for Human Rights mentions in its annual reports since 2016 that it has received hundreds of complaints of enforced disappearance. Its 2018 report said that the Council’s communications with the Interior Ministry revealed that in the majority of those cases the people had been forcibly disappeared. There is no mention of extrajudicial killings, but in its 2019 report the Council said it had received a complaint about an incident involving a criminal suspect in Gharbiya governorate whom police arrested at home on October 28, 2018, and later executed in a desert area. The 2019 report mentioned that prosecutors were investigating but as of writing Human Rights Watch could not find any information about the results of any investigation.\n\nII. Suspicious Killings and Probable Extra Judicial Executions\n\nHuman Rights Watch reviewed 165 official and quasi-official statements released about killings in alleged shootouts between January 2015 and December 2020. Of the 165 statements, approximately 123 concerned 143 incidents of alleged shootouts that involved alleged “terrorists,” and the others not discussed in this report involved shootouts with alleged criminal or drug gangs. Most of the 123 statements were official, meaning they were released on the ministry’s official Facebook page and Twitter account. The other statements were reported in local media, attributed to unidentified security officials.\n\nInterior Ministry officials claimed in the 123 statements concerning the 143 alleged shootout incidents that its forces killed 755 alleged “terrorists,” usually referred to as “cadres” or “elements” of the “terrorist” Muslim Brotherhood, Hasm, or other organizations, in 19 governorates.\n\nThe Interior Ministry statements routinely provided no meaningful information about the circumstances, only occasionally providing the names and more rarely photographs of those killed. Of the 755 individuals killed, only 141 were named. Some statements said that those killed were still being identified but did not issue any further clarification. Only 21 statements were accompanied by photographs of the dead. The Interior Ministry’s justification for these killings was almost always that security forces had “dealt with the source of fire.” The statements in almost every case claimed that security forces, based on intelligence gathered by the National Security Agency, had identified a “terrorist” hideout, obtained permission from Supreme State Security Prosecution to raid the place, prepared a raiding force, and while approaching the hideout the alleged “terrorists” opened fire, compelling the security forces to return fire. The alleged shootout almost always resulted in the killing of all the “terrorists.”\n\nOne telling indication of how suspicious these “shootout” killings are is that, out of all 143 reported incidents, only in one incident, in June 2015, did officials report that one man was arrested after being wounded. The review found that only in four shootouts were the alleged armed militants or terrorists (at least six of them) reported to have been able to escape. A total of 47 members of the security forces were reported wounded (in 7 incidents) and 5 killed (in 3 incidents). None of the 123 statements indicated that officials had notified ambulances or emergency medical aid to be available to attend to or evacuate wounded suspects despite their obligation to do so under international law.\n\nOperating with near-total impunity and lack of oversight of any sort, the Interior Ministry appeared not to care much whether its statements were compelling or convincing. Almost all used pro-forma language and routinely offered no details about the specific location where the alleged gun battle took place, usually providing only a vague sense of location. The statements also rarely offered details about the numbers or the identity of the “raiding” forces, the time of the raid beyond the date, whether any civilians were harmed or whether any civilian property was damaged – all details one would expect to find in an official statement about an actual shootout, particularly when it allegedly occurred in a residential area where reporting by media and residents could be expected.\n\nOne exception that, in contrast, illustrates missing elements of credibility in the Interior Ministry statements, was a shootout that occurred on April 20, 2020 in al-Amiriya neighborhood in Cairo which did exceptionally have dozens of witnesses. Several videos of the events by residents and journalists went viral. The videos show that the exchange of fire lasted for hours and gunshots were clearly heard while security forces surrounded and slowly approached the apartment where the armed militants were. The Interior Ministry warned residents in nearby buildings to avoid looking out of their windows and shut down the power grid in the whole area. One National Security Agency officer was killed in the shootout. By late evening, the Interior Ministry said it killed all seven “terrorists” that were in the building even though no explanation was given why no one was arrested. There is virtually no such reporting capturing the events in the dozens of incidents since 2015 that the Interior Ministry characterized as shootouts.\n\nMany statements gave at best only a rough idea of the weapons or ammunition seized.\n\nSome of the Interior Ministry statements included other suspicious elements. In a May 2020 statement, the ministry posted photographs of the “terrorists” allegedly killed but the photographs were actually of individuals killed months or years earlier. The ministry removed the photos after activists exposed the discrepancy. In another instance, the Interior Ministry said that on March 16, 2020 its forces killed six \"terrorist elements” in a shootout in Baer al-Abd, in North Sinai. A statement about two months later, on May 23, said its forces killed 21 more armed militants in Baer al-Abd, but some of the photographs published of both incidents appear to have been taken inside the same house or building.\n\nThe statements frequently labeled those killed as members of the “terrorist” Muslim Brotherhood or other groups that the authorities link to them, such as Hasm. Sometimes the statements mentioned the case numbers in which the killed individuals had been prosecuted or wanted. In many cases, they alleged the individuals were responsible for certain attacks or involved in killings of officers without providing evidence for such claims. In some cases, the Interior Ministry alleged that armed militants killed in separate “shootouts” months or years apart were responsible for the same attack or killing of an officer. Sometimes such killings occurred after the Interior Ministry had announced the arrest of alleged suspects or after authorities had charged them.\n\nIt is not possible to reach definite conclusions about the hundreds of killings in alleged shootouts in recent years, given that the Interior Ministry rarely provides even the most rudimentary information, such as the names of those killed. But the investigations of the nine incidents documented in this report, even with the limited available information, show the hallmarks of apparently extrajudicial executions of persons already in custody, in some cases forcibly disappeared. Other cases appear to involve people who at the moment they were killed posed no threat to security forces or anyone else and could have been arrested.\n\nThe following section in this report examines the Interior Ministry’s statements about 9 incidents which took place between July 2015 and September 2019 in which 75 persons were killed. The section draws on analysis of the limited number of photographs and videos available and interviews with acquaintances or family members of 14 of those killed. All evidence indicates that these were probable extrajudicial executions that represent a broader pattern. In four of the nine incidents, the alleged shootouts occurred in a confined space such as an apartment in a multi-story residential building. One incident was inside a car on highway, another in a tent in a desert area. The statements about the other three incidents did not specify the nature of the location. The Interior Ministry statements named only 21 of the 75 killed. In all nine incidents, the statements did not indicate that any member of the security forces was killed or wounded. Members of eight families said they saw what they believed were signs of abuse on the bodies of their killed relatives, including shoe marks on the face, burn and cut wounds, and broken bones or dislocated teeth. Human Rights Watch obtained and reviewed non-official photographs and videos showing the bodies of five of those killed in these incidents, in addition to official photographs showing two other men whose deaths are documented in this report.\n\nIn all 14 cases family members said their killed relatives had been arrested and were in the custody of security agencies before the incidents in which they were reportedly killed. Eight of the 14 families said they or other people, friends or acquaintances, witnessed the arrest. Thirteen of 14 families said their relative had been forcibly disappeared and that they had officially inquired about their whereabouts before their killing. Twelve families said they sent telegrams or letters to authorities, frequently the Interior Ministry or prosecution, seeking information about their loved ones. Human Rights Watch reviewed copies of the telegrams in six of the cases.\n\nOnly one family said that the police informed them about the killing of their relative the next day; all the other 13 families said they received no official notice or information at any point. All the families but one said they had to actively seek information about the deaths and the location of the bodies of their relatives. The family of one man was only able to collect his body after two months, and families of two of those killed have not been able to collect their bodies since December 2018. Nine of the 14 families said they needed security authorization or Supreme State Security Prosecution permission to collect the bodies of their relatives. At least 11 families said National Security officers intimidated and harassed them when they tried to locate the bodies of their relatives. Seven families said security forces escorted them from the morgue to the burial site to force them to bury their relatives without any funeral or service, fearing that the family would photograph the body or that the funeral would turn into a spontaneous protest. No family received a forensic or autopsy report or any further documents or information from the authorities about the circumstances of the killings or alleged shootouts, even though nine of the bodies appeared to have been dissected for autopsy. Authorities called none of the families to allow them to have a representative present during autopsy. Five families said they had not even received the death certificates as of time of writing. Human Rights Watch found no record that authorities have opened any serious or meaningful investigations into any of the incidents documented in this report. All families said they were not summoned for questioning as possible witnesses or otherwise requested to file any information that would indicate that any serious investigation was opened.\n\nOnly one family said their killed relative probably had been involved in armed activity. Two families said their two relatives were killed during a journey to leave Egypt’s southern border to Sudan, fleeing persecution, with the help of smugglers. All the other families said their relatives had not been engaged in violence or political activity.\n\nAlmost all the official statements mentioned near the end that “legal measures were taken” and that “the Supreme State Security Prosecution is investigating the incident,” without further explanation. The Supreme State Security Prosecution is an abusive branch of public prosecution that largely backs up often unsubstantiated allegations by the security authorities. It has also supported the unlawful detention of peaceful activists and dissidents, and has almost uniformly failed to investigate allegations of wrongdoing by security officials, including torture as well as unlawful killings.\n\nEven in cases with strong material evidence that the murdered men had been in state custody when they were killed, Human Rights Watch could find no indication that authorities carried out any serious investigation or held any one accountable. One such incident that Human Rights Watch investigated earlier and received unusually wide coverage in Egyptian media at the time was the killing in May 2015 of Ain Shams University student Islam Atito. Human Rights Watch documented how security agencies probably abducted the final-year engineering student on May 19, 2015 as he finished a school exam. According to witnesses, university surveillance camera recordings collected by prosecutors and seen by a professor supervising him, as well as several media and human rights reports, two or three men chased Atito and pushed him into a car near the university. Atito’s family told Human Rights Watch that they searched for him at hospitals and police stations that day and filed reports with police inquiring about his whereabouts. The next day, May 20, a short Interior Ministry statement announced Atito was an “ikhwani” (Muslim Brother) militant who had been killed in a “desert hideout” after he had opened fire on pursuing security forces. The statement claimed he was responsible for killing a police officer, Wael Tahoun, in April 2015. The Interior Ministry had already arrested separately two groups of alleged militants in the weeks before Atito’s killing, claiming they had “confessed” they were responsible for Tahoun’s killing. Atito regularly attended his classes and reportedly had no noticeable absence from school or political involvement. His family said they saw signs of abuse on his body. Despite all of this compelling evidence, no officer was apparently questioned or found guilty of Atito’s probable abduction and extrajudicial killing. Instead, his younger brother, Ihab, was reported arrested in September 2016. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights, a prominent rights groups, said authorities forcibly disappeared Ihab Atito for over two months. He remains in custody at time of writing.\n\nAtito’s killing was only the beginning of a barrage of such cases.\n\nNine Muslim Brothers Killed in Giza, July 2015\n\nOne of the first reported alleged shootout incidents involving probable extrajudicial executions occurred on July 1, 2015 when Interior Ministry forces killed nine Muslim Brothers, including several well-known senior leaders, in an apartment in October 6 City in Giza.\n\nIn an investigation published on July 31, 2015 Human Rights Watch concluded that these killings may have been extrajudicial executions, based on strong evidence including interviews with 11 relatives and witnesses with knowledge of the incident. The evidence suggested that security forces had arrested, fingerprinted, and tortured the men before killing them. The killings appeared to be in retaliation for the assassination of Prosecutor General Hisham Barakat two days earlier, which the authorities immediately tried to link to the Muslim Brotherhood. During Barakat’s funeral, President al-Sisi publicly complained that “the hands of justice were tied by laws” and asserted:\n\nWe will not sit [watching] those who are killing us being on trials for five or ten years…. No courts would work this way, under those circumstances. This could work with normal people. But [for] the people who are not [normal] only prompt laws would work with them.\n\nThe Interior Ministry, in an official statement issued the evening of July 1, claimed that “security agencies were examining the confiscated material … which could help identify those who carried out the killing of the Prosecutor General,” a further indication of the retaliatory nature of these killings. The statement said that its forces had killed nine men involved in the Brotherhood’s “special operations committees” responsible for “acts of terrorism and vandalization.” The statement claimed that intelligence indicated that Abdel Fattah Ibrahim Attia, a Brotherhood leader described as the “main engine” of the committees, was convening an organizational meeting with other leaders of the “special operations committees.” When security forces approached the apartment where they were meeting, the statement claimed, they were shot at, and therefore “quickly fired back,” killing Attia and eight others.\n\nThe Brotherhood denied the government’s narrative and said that the killed leaders were not armed and were peaceful members of a committee overseeing the support of the Brotherhood’s “martyrs and wounded.”\n\nThe ministry’s statement raised more questions than answers. It did not, for example, explain why, if the Interior Ministry had such intelligence, security forces did not arrest Attia or any others on their way to the meeting. The statement did not name the other eight victims but said two of them had previously been sentenced to death in absentia in cases of alleged violence. The statement claimed that security forces seized three rifles, six magazines, and 132 bullets. There was no mention of any bullet casings. The statement said three members of the raiding force were injured but gave no details.\n\nAnother element of suspicion, one that amounts to an official acknowledgement that the men had been captured alive, was an Interior Ministry statement just a few hours earlier on July 1 saying it had arrested nine members of the Brotherhood’s “special operations committees” the day before, on June 30. No names were mentioned. The Interior Ministry deleted this statement or made it inaccessible sometime in 2021.\n\nEl-Watan, a pro-government newspaper, in a one-line report published between the two ministry statements, said that security forces had “succeeded in liquidating nine Brotherhood leaders,” citing an unnamed “security source.” The newspaper named one of those killed, Nasser al-Hafy, a leader of the dissolved Brotherhood’s Freedom and Justice Party who was an elected member of the 2012 parliament.\n\nA lawyer who asked not to be named and who had represented Sayed Dwedar, one of the nine men killed, said that Dwedar’s driver, who had driven Dwedar to the meeting that morning, called the lawyer at 11 a.m. to say that Dwedar was being arrested. The driver, who was waiting outside the apartment building, said that a large number of security forces had gathered in the area and some had entered the building. The driver did not mention hearing any shooting, but the lawyer did not ask. The driver was then unreachable after a brief follow-up call that evening, the lawyer said.\n\nThe families of the unnamed men killed in the incident learned about the fate of their relatives later that evening when Mekameleen, a pro-Brotherhood TV station, and other media outlets published the list of names and photographs of the nine killed.\n\nAs Human Rights Watch reported at the time, Dwedar’s lawyer and nine relatives of those killed said that most of the bodies bore signs of abuse, including stab wounds, broken bones, and marks from electric shocks. At least four of the nine had been shot in the head, relatives said. The lawyer, who said he had significant experience in fatal shooting incidents, told Human Rights Watch that one of the head wounds bore a circular burn mark, indicating the man had been shot at point-blank range.\n\nBurial permission forms issued by the Health Ministry, viewed by Human Rights Watch, stated that most of the nine men died of gunshots, broken bones, and lacerated internal organs. Today, nearly seven years after the incident, no credible investigation has taken place, and no relatives of the deceased have been called to offer their accounts despite families’ official complaints against the Interior Ministry.\n\nThe incident received significant coverage at the time by government and non-government media. Security agencies arrested several journalists who tried to visit the building where the killings took place. Apparently one of the “lessons” security agencies learned was to avoid carrying out alleged shootouts in an easily identifiable and accessible location.\n\nMu’tasim Ahmed al-Agizi\n\nOne of the two families of the killed men that Human Rights Watch had not been able to reach in 2015 is that of Mu’tasim Ahmed al-Agizi. Al-Agizi, 25, was a sales representative for a pharmaceutical company from Mahlet Abu Ali village, in Gharbia governorate. He was one of eight of the men who were living in cities in Nile Delta and traveled to October 6 City for the July 1 meeting. “Yasin,” a relative of al-Agizi, said that he had left his family home in the early morning that day, and drove his car to Cairo. “We were together until dawn. It was Ramadan and we had Sohor [the meal before day-time fasting] together,” Yasin said. He said that al-Agizi had still been active with the Muslim Brotherhood following the 2013 military takeover. Around noon that day, the family received information from friends of al-Agizi that he was arrested. In the early afternoon, a low-ranking security officer arrived at the family home’s in Gharbia and asked about al-Agizi but gave no information.\n\nUnlike several of the men killed in this incident, al-Agizi, who studied in the faculty of science at Mansoura University, was not wanted by authorities at the time and had no cases against him, Yasin said. Al-Agizi’s father, however, was a senior Brotherhood leader and has been detained since the August 2013 events that followed the dispersal of the pro-Morsy Rab’a sit-in and was sentenced to 15 years in a flawed mass trial.\n\nYasin said that three family members were able to collect al-Agizi’s body shortly after it was transported by ambulance to the Zeinhom morgue in Giza. He added that the family arranged a funeral and buried him in the early morning hours of July 2. “Security forces were present at the funeral with an armored vehicle and two police cars,” Yasin said.\n\nAl-Agizi’s family filed a complaint with the police to retrieve his car and other belongings, including his wallet, mobile phone, a tablet, and some documents. “The family received an unofficial call from an officer who knew the family, who said that they will not get the car or any of Mu’tasim’s belongings back because of the other complaint they filed against officials about the killings,” Yasin said. The family received al-Agizi’s eyeglasses and a wristwatch he was wearing when he was killed.\n\nAl-Agizi’s burial permission, seen by Human Rights Watch, stated that he died from five bullet wounds to the stomach, lacerated internal organs, and broken bones.\n\nThree Men Killed in Assiut, December 2016\n\nAn Interior Ministry statement on December 6, 2016 said that security forces killed three members of Hasm in a shootout in Assiut governorate, in southern Egypt: Abdelrahman Gamal from Minya, and Mohamed Said Zaki and Alaa Ragab Owais, both from the adjacent Bani Suef governorate. The statement said that the three were wanted by the State Security Prosecution in Case 724 of 2016 for alleged armed attacks. The statement used the usual wording: the Interior Ministry’s National Security Agency gathered intelligence about a hideout of alleged leaders of the “military wing of the terrorist [Brotherhood] organization.” The ministry prepared a force to raid the hideout, but when they approached the militants “abruptly fired” at the security agents, who “dealt with the source of fire,” resulting in the deaths of the three men. The statement mentioned that the hideout was a two-story building in Bani Shaaran village, in the town of Manflout, Assiut, close to the western desert road.\n\nThe statement said that Abdelrahman Gamal was responsible for manufacturing explosive devices and providing training for other members on their manufacture. Alaa Ragab Owais was responsible for the “assassination group.” And Mohamed Said Zaki was the leader of Hasm in Bani Suef. The statement named several officers whose earlier killings the three had allegedly been involved in.\n\nThe statement said that after searching the site, security forces seized three 7.62 x 39 millimeter rifles, seven bullet magazines and ammunition of the same caliber, and documents related to their armed activities. In its coverage of the incident, the pro-government Albawabh news site cited unnamed security officials who denied allegations that the three had been forcibly disappeared before their deaths.\n\nEvidence Human Rights Watch gathered suggests otherwise. Their families and human rights groups said the three were arrested separately, in August and October 2016, and disappeared for several months prior to the date of the alleged shootout. The independent Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) said, after the ministry announcement of the killings, that it had previously documented the arrest and incommunicado detention of Mohamed Said Zaki. The ECRF said that while Zaki was shopping with his wife on al-Arish street in Giza on October 9, 2016, men in plain clothes abducted him, put him in an unmarked microbus, and drove away. The family’s inquiries about his whereabouts were unsuccessful, the ECRF statement said. It added that, according to Zaki’s mother, the death certificate stated that Zaki’s cause of death was “acute circulatory failure.” The family told the ECRF that they saw his body and that it had what they believed were signs of abuse, including “signs of wounds in the head, [and] broken upper teeth….”\n\nThe ECRF said that Alaa Ragab Owais was arrested on August 13, 2016, and that his family sent several inquiries to authorities about his whereabouts. The ECRF statement added that a survivor of forced disappearance, whom it did not name, told ECRF lawyers that he saw Owais in the Abbasiya National Security building in Cairo, where they had been held at the same time.\n\nA joint report by two Egyptian human rights organizations, the Egyptian Front for Human Rights and Belady Center for Rights and Freedoms, said that Case 724 of 2016 (also known as Military Case 64 of 2017), for which the Interior Ministry said Zaki, Owais, and Gamal were wanted, was marred by gross abuses, including failure to investigate serious allegations of torture and disappearance; 120 defendants said they had been disappeared. Dozens of defendants’ families filed complaints with the governmental National Council for Human Rights in this case.\n\nAbdelrahman Gamal\n\nThe third person mentioned in the Interior Ministry statement about the alleged Assiut shootout was Abdelrahman Gamal, 23 at the time, from Matay town in Minya governorate. A science student at Minya University, he stopped attending classes and moved to Cairo in late 2013 or early 2014 after he learned he was wanted by authorities for his activism with the Muslim Brotherhood, “Tayseer,” a relative of Gamal living outside Egypt, said. In 2014, the authorities prosecuted Gamal in absentia, in addition to his father and several others, in a mass trial over charges of alleged violence, including membership in a “terrorist” organization and possession of explosives. A court sentenced him to life in prison, Tayseer said. Gamal’s father said in a TV interview that his son was a peaceful activist. But Tayseer said he believed that, in 2015, Gamal had joined the Hasm armed group. Both Gamal’s father and Tayseer said that security forces killed Gamal in custody, about four months after he was arrested, and during that time he was held incommunicado.\n\nAccording to Tayseer, Gamal’s friends, including a witness, informed his family that on August 25, 2016, he was arrested at an apartment in October 6 City, in Giza governorate. “We talked the day before and he told me everything was all right,” Tayseer said. He added that he had been in regular contact, almost daily, with Gamal over the Telegram messaging app.\n\nTayseer said the witness told the family that he heard gunshots when uniformed police raided the apartment, and that several people, including Gamal, were apprehended alive.\n\n“We sent complaints and reports to the Prosecutor General, the minister of interior, the minister of justice and the president himself,” Tayseer said, adding that the family received no response. Two weeks after his arrest, a lawyer who had connections in the Interior Ministry told the family that Gamal had been sighted by other detainees. “We were told that he was sent to the National Security building in Sheikh Zayed [adjacent to October 6 City].”\n\nHours after the Interior Ministry published its December 2016 statement claiming the shootout deaths, officials from the Interior Ministry in Assiut called Gamal’s family in Minya to inform them about his death and tell them they could collect his body from the morgue at Assiut University Hospital, Tayseer said. According to Tayseer, four people who were able to see Gamal’s body said they observed seven bullet wounds, two in the head and the rest in the chest and abdominal area. They further said that there appeared to be signs of abuse including burns to the upper half of Gamal’s body and shoulders.\n\nHuman Rights Watch reviewed a copy of the burial permission, dated December 7, 2016, which said that Gamal’s death was “under inspection by the forensic doctor.”\n\nA December 7, 2016 video published by Al Jazeera Egypt’s Facebook page showed what it said was Gamal’s body shrouded in a white sheet while his mother caressed his uncovered face in the back of a burial service car.\n\nSeveral months after Gamal’s death, police in Minya detained his 16-year-old brother several times for short periods, in what the family said was a form of intimidation.\n\nEight Men Killed on Their Way to Sudan, May 2017\n\nOn May 8, 2017, Egypt’s official Middle East News Agency (MENA) reported that Interior Ministry forces killed eight “terrorists” on the Safaga-Sohag highway in southern Egypt in a shootout. The statement cited an unnamed “senior” security official and did not name any of the eight men. The statement claimed the usual story: the National Security Agency obtained intelligence about a “terrorist hideout,” and when security forces approached the site, they were fired on and fired back, killing all eight. The statement said that security forces seized an unidentified number of guns and ammunition.\n\nA few hours after the news agency statement, the Interior Ministry released an official statement on its Facebook page which was apparently about the same incident. The statement said that eight “terrorist elements” of the Brotherhood were killed in a hideout near a “desert road” in southern Egypt, but did not specify the location. The statement said security forces used “IT technology” in tracking the men and seized three 7.62 x 39 millimeter rifles, 118 bullets and shells of spent bullets. The statement mentioned the names of only three of the men killed: Helmy Saad Masry Mohareb, Mohamed Medhat al-Zanati Nasser, and Abdelrahman Rashad Mohamed al-Wakeel.\n\nSeveral news websites published the names of the other men, including Albawabh news site, which is close to Egypt’s intelligence agencies. Albawabh said that nine men were killed in the incident and published their names and photographs. In addition to the three named in the official government statement, Albawabh included: Mohamed and Mahmoud Ali Hassan, brothers from al-Sharqia governorate, Bassam Adel Adam from al-Arish in North Sinai, Abdallah Ragab from al-Fayoum, Mohamed Abdel Salam from al-Behira, and Ibrahim Gamal al-Ghazali from al-Menofiya.\n\nThe Interior Ministry statement claimed that intelligence indicated that the group was planning to travel to obtain military training arranged by the Muslim Brotherhood outside Egypt, in order to return and carry out violent attacks. The statement claimed that Helmy Saad Masry Mohareb was assigned to lead the group and that he had earlier been sentenced to death in absentia in a case in Damnhour and was wanted in several additional cases involving violence.\n\nThe statement said that Mohamed Nasser was wanted in two 2014 cases for belonging to the Muslim Brotherhood and vandalizing public property. Al-Wakeel was wanted in State Security Case 370 of 2015, involving anti-government “armed militancy” in Qaliubiya governorate, the statement said.\n\nSeveral independent and opposition websites published accounts of the families contradicting the Interior Ministry’s statement. Families and lawyers told the independent Arabic Post and Noon Post websites that the men were traveling to Sudan to flee government oppression of Brotherhood members and that they were not part of any armed groups. The Muslim Brotherhood released an official statement condemning what it described as the “assassination” of eight “innocent” men.\n\nThe Facebook page of Al Jazeera Egypt published a video showing a person it said was Abdelrahman al-Wakeel’s father speaking inside a mosque during his son’s funeral. The father, a lawyer, said that he had encouraged his son to leave Egypt as a court sentence was expected soon. “I am saying the truth before God,” the father said in the video. The father said he had booked a train ticket to Aswan for his son on May 4, and that the family had been in contact with him until May 7.\n\nMohamed Medhat al-Zanati Nasser\n\nMohamed Nasser, 23, one of the men the Interior Ministry named as killed in a “shootout”, was from Ebshady village, in the town of al-Shuhada, in al-Menofiya governorate in the Nile Delta. He was studying commerce in the University of al-Menofiya. In August 2016, he stopped attending classes after security forces attempted to arrest him near his village, apparently because of his Muslim Brotherhood activities, “Naeem,” a relative, said.\n\nIn August 2016, according to Naeem, Nasser was stopped in an agricultural area by two men in plain clothes whom he thought wanted to ask about something. Instead, they attacked him and tried to handcuff him. Nasser was able to kick them and run away and he went into hiding. Naeem said that over the following months the family heard from other detained men that National Security officers were looking to kill Nasser for having kicked the officers and for having got away, which “made their bosses punish them.” “They took it personally,” Naeem said.\n\nThe family then began arranging for Nasser to leave Egypt. They obtained a visa for him but because of his mandatory military service he would not be able to obtain army permission to travel. Instead Nasser intended to cross irregularly into Sudan, Naeem said. In May 2017, Naeem learned that Nasser had begun his journey over a route long used to smuggle goods and people, including wanted dissidents and political activists, between several countries in East and North Africa.\n\nNaeem said he spoke with Nasser on the phone on May 5, 2016. “He seemed afraid and anxious that the journey was not going smoothly and that some fellow travelers dropped out because other travelers didn’t look okay.” Naeem said he encouraged Nasser to wait and check with the person who arranged the trip. On May 6, Naeem called again but another traveler who he says may have been Ibrahim al-Ghazali picked the phone. That man said that they were resting in a farm area. Just an hour or two later, Naeem tried to call again, many times, but the phone had been switched off. On May 7, Naeem called a friend who earlier had left Egypt by the same route and had links to the smugglers, asking him to seek news. The friend called him back a few hours later and said that the group had been arrested on that day, May 7, and might be presented to prosecutors in Hurghada soon. “I immediately called Nasser’s father and told him to file a complaint to inquire about his whereabouts,” Naeem said.\n\nNasser’s family learned about the deaths of the eight men the next day when the Interior Ministry released its statement. According to Naeem, the family received a phone call from someone who said that the bodies might be in a hospital in Hurghada. On their way there, the family received another call telling them the bodies were at Giza’s Zeinhom morgue, but staff there told them they had received no bodies and that some forensic doctors had been called to go to Sohag to carry out some work there, Naeem said.\n\nOn May 10, the family traveled to Sohag. There, authorities required them to give DNA samples for matching and told that they would be contacted in five days to collect the bodies, Naeem said. The family stayed in the same hotel where al-Ghazali’s family was also staying, waiting to collect his body. The next day, a National Security officer called them and asked them to stop gathering in front of the hospital, where the bodies were.\n\nNasser’s family was able to collect his body on May 13 and buried him in al-Menofiya around 11 p.m. that day, Naeem said. Al-Ghazali’s family received his body a day later, according to a relative of his.\n\nNaeem said that, according to other relatives who saw Nasser’s body, it bore what he believed were signs of burn wounds on his knees and wounds from electric shocks on his wrists. Fingers on both his hands appeared to have been fingerprinted and the body had three bullet wounds, he said. No forensic reports were provided to the family, Naeem said.\n\nHuman Rights Watch and the independent forensic experts it consulted reviewed seven photographs showing Nasser’s body in the morgue and a 20-second video showing his back. The photographs and video show several gunshot wounds in the right and left sides of the chest and back. The fingers on his left hand appear to have been fingerprinted. Bones appeared to project from his left hand just above the wrist. His chest had a longitudinal autopsy stitched scar.\n\nIbrahim Gamal al-Ghazali\n\nIbrahim Gamal al-Ghazali, one of the eight men killed in the incident, was not named in the official Interior Ministry statement. Al-Ghazali, 22, was a children’s gymnastics teacher, also from al-Shouhada town in al-Menofiya governorate. “Yasser,” a relative of al-Ghazali, said al-Ghazali was a close friend of Nasser.\n\nAl-Ghazali’s family had been aware of his plans to cross from Egypt to Sudan and that he was going to travel in May 2017 with a group that included his friend, Nasser.\n\nAl-Ghazali had been arrested once for a month in 2014 and charged in Case 1561 of 2014 of Downtown Cairo with participating in an anti-government protest on the anniversary of the January 25 uprising. He was released on bail. A court later sentenced him to 10 years in absentia in a flawed mass trial of 227 people, most arbitrarily arrested, in Case 1564, known as “Mazaleem Wast al-Balad.”\n\nAccording to Yasser, al-Ghazali had earlier plans to travel abroad but his two visa applications to Turkey were rejected. Yasser said that on May 3, 2017, al-Ghazali started his journey to the border with Sudan in the same group with Nasser.\n\nYasser said that he learned on the evening of May 7 about al-Ghazali’s arrest near Halayib city on the Sudan border when someone involved in arranging the trip and in regular contact with the smugglers called him. Yasser said that Ghazali’s family immediately contacted a lawyer to attend his interrogation once Ghazali appeared before prosecutors. But that never happened. “Less than 24 hours after I knew about al-Ghazali’s arrest the Interior Ministry’s statement about the killings came out,” Yasser said.\n\nAuthorities did not inform the family that al-Ghazali had been killed, but since the Interior Ministry statement mentioned Nasser, they were quite sure that their son was among the eight killed. Yasser added that al-Ghazali’s father, not knowing what to do, traveled to Hurghada, on Egypt’s Red Sea coast, as he had been told that people arrested in similar situations were presented to prosecutors there. Half-way to Hurghada, he changed course to Giza when he was told his son’s body might be in the Zeinhom morgue, but it was not there. On May 10, the family received information from a family acquaintance in the Health Ministry that al-Ghazali’s body was in the Akhmim Central Hospital morgue in Sohag.\n\nAccording to Yasser, the Akhmim Central hospital staff told al-Ghazali’s father that he needed security authorization to collect the body. On May 10 he went to the National Security Agency building in the city, where an officer interrogated him about how he knew that his son was among the eight killed even though the Interior Ministry’s statement did not mention his name. After the interrogation, the authorities took a blood sample from the father to conduct a DNA test and told him he would be contacted within the next three to five days.\n\nOn May 14, the family received a phone call informing them that they could collect al-Ghazali’s body from the morgue. After collecting his body, security forces escorted the family on an eight-hour road trip from Sohag to al-Ghazali’s hometown in al-Menofiya.\n\nThe family saw what they believed were signs of beatings and abuse on al-Ghazali’s body, Yasser said, including what appeared to be cigarette burns on his chest and abdominal area. Human Rights Watch and the independent experts it consulted reviewed three photographs that the human rights platform We Record was able to obtain of al-Ghazali’s body. One shows his lower face and his left shoulder, another shows his right arm and the third shows his left arm. The photograph of the right arm showed an apparent high velocity gunshot exit wound on the back (posterior) side. The photograph of the shoulder showed suspected entrance and exit gunshot wounds. The third photograph showed a large circular laceration in the front (anterior) side of the left arm where skin was missing and muscles and bones were visible. We Record said they had other photographs that showed two bullet wounds in his lower back and another in his chest around 20 centimeters below his right shoulder.\n\nThe death certificate reviewed by Human Rights Watch, dated May 9, 2017, stated “unnatural cause of death: bullet wounds, lacerated internal organs, broken bones, and bleeding.” No autopsy report was delivered to the family.\n\nYasser said that authorities did not return to the family any of the belongings that al-Ghazali had with him on the journey, including his mobile phone, passport, and cash.\n\nFour Men Killed in Two Incidents in Alexandria and Cairo, June 2017\n\nInterior Ministry forces killed three men –Sabry Sabah Khalil, Abdel Zaher Yasin Mutawea, and Ahmed Mohamed Abu Rashed – in Alexandria on June 20, 2017, and one, Mohamed Abdel Moniem Zaki Abu Tabeekh, in October 6 City, in Giza, on June 23, 2017, in two separate incidents of alleged shootouts. The Interior Ministry said all four were involved with Hasm.\n\nJust a few days earlier, on June 18, Hasm had claimed responsibility for a roadside bomb attack that killed one police officer and wounded another as well as three soldiers in Cairo’s Maadi district.\n\nHuman Rights Watch interviewed relatives of the four men. Evidence strongly suggests police, between four and five weeks earlier, had arrested the four, who were apparently connected by business or friendship and supportive of the Muslim Brotherhood, and held them incommunicado before they were extrajudicially executed.\n\nFamilies of all four said they made dozens of complaints inquiring about their relatives’ whereabouts without any response from the authorities. Human Rights Watch reviewed copies of the telegrams sent except for those sent in the case of Mutawea. Relatives of Mutawea saw him being arrested, while relatives of Rashed said a witness informed them about his arrest. Families of the three men killed in Alexandria said that the men’s bodies bore what they believed were torture marks. Authorities gave them no autopsy reports despite the fact that bodies had undergone autopsies. The three families also received no death certificates and had to bury their relatives under strict security surveillance.\n\nSabry Sabah Khalil\n\nSabry Khalil was 46 years old when the Ministry of Interior announced his killing on June 20, 2017. A father of five daughters, the youngest 11, Khalil, who worked as an accountant and ran a real estate business, was from al-Dalgamoun village in Kafr el-Zayat, al-Gharbiya governorate, in the Nile Delta.\n\nTwo of Khalil’s relatives, “Soha” and “Nihal,” interviewed separately, said that Khalil had been wanted since 2014 on charges of joining the Muslim Brotherhood. In 2015, a military court sentenced him to 10 years in absentia in a mass trial along with 79 other defendants on charges of vandalizing public property and possession of explosives. Out of fear of arrest, and because his home in Kafr el-Zayat had been raided more than once, Khalil rented two apartments, one in October 6 City, west of Cairo, and another in Alexandria. His work required him to travel frequently between the two cities, the relatives said. One daughter visited him frequently in the October 6 City apartment, most recently on May 16, 2017.\n\nSoha and Nihal said until then their phone communication with Khalil had been regular. They knew that he was traveling to Alexandria but two days after the visit they felt he sounded \"different\" on the phone. Soha said that “he was texting too succinctly.” Nihal said that on May 18 Khalil sent a voice note on a messaging app. “We had agreed on a security question and answer to know if he got arrested,” she said. “He sent a voice note to me, and I was 100-percent sure that he was arrested.”\n\nAround that time, Soha and Nihal said, a close friend of Khalil, Mohamed Abu Tabeekh, was worried because he, too, was unsuccessfully trying to contact him. Abu Tabeekh was from Khalil’s hometown of al-Dalgamoun and lived on the same street in October 6 City. Soha said that Khalil asked Abu Tabeekh to meet, and he agreed. Then both Khalil and Abu Tabeekh went missing and were not reachable by phone.\n\nKhalil’s family concluded that he had been arrested around May 18, as on that day or the next security forces in black uniform and balaclavas raided Khalil’s apartment in Giza, Soha said. Khalil’s family lived in Kafr al-Zayat, but a neighbor of Khalil in Giza’s October 6 City informed them about the raid. The neighbor told Soha that security agents went directly to the fourth floor, where Khalil’s apartment was, and “destroyed” the apartment. According to Soha, security agents arrested another man living in the same building and kept him for two weeks in the National Security Agency’s building in Sheikh Zayed, adjacent to October 6 City, before releasing him. According to Khalil’s relatives, before going to Khalil’s apartment security forces raided Abu Tabeekh’s apartment in a different building on the same street.\n\nOn May 20 and 21, Khalil's family said, they sent several telegrams and complaints to the authorities, including the interior minister, the Prosecutor General, the security directorates in Giza and al-Gharbiya, and the police station closest to the raided apartment, inquiring about his whereabouts, copies of which Human Rights Watch reviewed. The family received no responses and for the next 33 days they had no information about Khalil's and Abu Tabeekh’s whereabouts. On June 20, they said they learned about Khalil’s death from the media.\n\nOn June 20, 2017, the Interior Ministry issued a statement claiming that security forces killed Khalil and two other men in an exchange of fire in Alexandria. The statement claimed that when security approached the building where the men were, the men opened fire and security forces “dealt with the source of fire.” The statement claimed that security agents seized two automatic rifles, a 9 millimeter pistol and an unspecified amount of ammunition. The statement said that the shootout occurred in a deserted building in the Salt Company housing project in Alexandria’s Borg al-Arab area.\n\nThe statement falsely stated that Khalil had received a life sentence in a criminal case in Alexandria. It also said that he, and the two others killed, were sought in State Security case 420 of 2017.\n\nThe two other persons killed in the incident were Abdel Zaher Yasin Mutawea and Ahmed Mohamed Abu Rashed, the statement said. Mutawea, 32, a pharmacist, was a friend of Khalil and helped him rent the apartment in Alexandria, Nihal said. Abu Rashed, 41, worked at the government tax authority and was from Khalil's hometown.\n\nAbu Tabeekh, Khalil's friend who went missing with him, was announced killed in a separate Interior Ministry statement on June 23, 2017.\n\nAuthorities did not contact Khalil’s family, but family members said that through lawyers they were able to learn that Khalil’s body was in the Koum al-Dikka morgue in Alexandria. When they arrived there, morgue employees told the family that there were three unidentified bodies. The family presented the Interior Ministry’s statement about the incident, which included passport-like pictures of the deceased, but the morgue officials said that the family could not collect Khalil's body without Interior Ministry authorization. When the family tried to obtain authorization from Alexandria’s Borg al-Arab police station, officers told them that they had no information about the incident and that no report had been filed about the deaths, Nihal said.\n\nThe officers at the police station told the family to inquire at the office of the Supreme State Security Prosecution in Cairo. There, they were told that they would have to wait for a phone call to inform them when they could collect the body, Nihal said. Soha said that authorities requested two relatives of each of the deceased men to submit DNA samples to prove their relationship to the deceased. After five days of negotiations and traveling back and forth, on June 25, which that year was Eid al-Fitr, the day Muslims celebrate the end of Ramadan, Khalil’s family received a call from the Borg al-Arab police station informing them they could come to collect his body.\n\nThey received no autopsy report or death certificate, as international law requires. The burial permission, a copy of which Human Rights Watch reviewed, mentioned that the cause of death was “pending investigation.” When the family saw Khalil’s body, he was \"too thin, in an obvious way,\" Nihal said. \"He had bruises on his body and three bullet wounds to his chest and around his heart.\" Nihal also said the body had a longitudinal chest scar, indicating he had undergone an autopsy.\n\nSecurity forces in several police cars escorted the hearse and accompanied the family from the morgue in Alexandria to where Khalil was buried in his hometown in Kafr al-Zayat, about 100 kilometers south of Alexandria. Nihal said that police arrested several people following the funeral for chanting against the government but released them shortly afterwards.\n\nThe family received several visits by National Security Agency officers after Khalil was killed, Nihal said.\n\nAbdel Zaher Yasin Mutawea\n\nThe Interior Ministry announced the death of a 32-year-old pharmacist, Abdel Zaher Yasin Mutawea, in the same June 20 incident. “Mohsen,” a relative of Mutawea, said that security agencies had been pursuing him for Brotherhood ties since the military took over the government in July 2013. He was later sentenced to prison in absentia for allegedly vandalizing public property and so constantly moved places to avoid arrest. Mutawea’s wife, in their hometown in Damnhour city, north of Cairo, told Mohsen that she was with Mutawea in an apa"
