Along with our collection of 55,000 Holocaust survivor testimonies, the new testimonies in our Countering Antisemitism Through Testimony Collection will be an invaluable resource to researchers, educators, and policymakers in the urgent effort to mitigate the deadly threat of antisemitism to Jewish and non-Jewish communities around the world.\n\nOur work is guided by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s (IHRA) non-legally binding working definition of antisemitism, which begins with a core definition:\n\n“Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.”"
