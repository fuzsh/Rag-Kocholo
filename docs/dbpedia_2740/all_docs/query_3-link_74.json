Calling for the destruction of Israel, denying Jews a permanent homeland, or holding Israel to a double standard are forms of antisemitism.\n\nZionism is the belief that the Jewish people have a right to a homeland in the State of Israel.\n\nIt is based on the Jewish peopleâ€™s deep historical connection to the land of Zion (ancient Jerusalem) and their right to be free from persecution, exile, and the threat of extermination.\n\nAntisemitism did not end with the Holocaust.\n\nToday, it can be seen in a shooting at a synagogue, a swastika on a building, the use of Jewish stereotypes, retaliation against Jews globally for the acts of the Israeli government, or anti-Zionist actions or sentiments.\n\nYou are not antisemitic if you don't support actions and policies of the Israeli government.\n\nHowever, if you use anti-Israel sentiments to justify the hatred of Jews or prejudices against Jews to demonize the State of Israel, these are both forms of antisemitism."
