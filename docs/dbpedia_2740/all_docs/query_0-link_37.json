        "text": "Arab racism VS Israeli worries\n\nArab racism VS Israeli worries\n\nWhile anti-Israel bigots, Arabs, Muslims have for so long tried to cast Israelis’ legitimate concern over a growing racist Arab threat that seeks its annihilation – in a bad light, the recent phenomenon is that radical leftists inside Israel cast at times these worries and subsequented defensive actions also with such bombastic -unfair- definitions, though their aim is political, the damage is simply horrific, nevertheless.\n\nNow, why don’t we talk about the real racism in the area, outside or even inside Israel, the Arab racism of course, that which since (at least the 1920s) tried to commit genocide on the Jewish population and together with Islamic bigotry, these two fascisms motivated the expulsion of (roughly) 1,000,000 Jews and the anti-Israel campaign.\n\nThe latter campaign has never been discontinued.\n\n[Racism by Israeli Arabs include: creating – via intimidation and violence- an “off limits to Jews and “pure” Arab (areas) zone;\n\nArabs’ targeting of innocent Jews, simply for being Jews; the massive rationalization for support of attackers in the Arab public.]\n\nArab racism in general * Arab racism: Anti-Jewish (in general) * The silence on ‘Arab racism’ * Racist Arab League * Arab racism “Palestinian”/Israeli Arabs * judenrein Palestine – Ethnic cleansing * Genocidal anti-Semitism *Israelis [not racist but] worried of racist Arab attacks * Arab apartheid * pro-Hamas = pro-genocide * Racist Arabs’ anti-democratic-Israel hypocrisy * Arab Islamic apartheid VS free equal Israel * Apartheid [Arab] Palestine\n\n______________\n\nIn general\n\nFor Your Information Arab Racism, Anti-semitism.\n\nMichigan Daily – Dec 6, 1973\n\nArabs often claim that they are not anti-semites because they are Semites. That is irrelevant because anti-semitism historically and means hatred of Jews and nothing else.\n\nAntisemitic literature abounds in the Arab world to day and its main function appears to be the cultivation and maintenance of popular hatred toward Israel. A substantial portion of this antisemitic campaign stems from continued Arab-Nazi collaboration since WW II.\n\nThe leaders of the Palestinian Arabs (Haj Amin el Husseini, Fawsi el Hawkii, Wasef Kamal) were in Berlin since 1941. They helped to organize Muslim SS units in the Balkan which helped to liquidate Jews and partisans.\n\nFurthermore, hundreds of leading Nazis have been and are working in Egypt and Syria in prominent positions. Some examples: Oskar Dirlewanger. murderer of tens of thousands of Jews in the Ukraine, was the coommander of Nasser’s bodyguard (now called Haj Amin).\n\nDr. Heinrich Willerman, the Nazi doctor who cruelly experimented on human bodies in the Dachau concentration camp, is the commander of the Samarra camp in Egypt. And the head of the Gestapo in Poland, Leopold Gleim, is now (under the nam[e] of Ali el Nacher) the head of the political police in Egypt. Finally, the “Institute for Research on Zionism” in Cairo is a profuse source of anti-semitic propaganda; its founder and director was Goebbels’ assistant Dr. J Von Leers (died in 1965)\n\nArab governments cooperate throughout the world with neo-Nazi organizations like the British National Socialist movement. Tacuara (Argentina) and nwspapers like the “Deutsche Soldaten Seitung” (Germany).\n\nMany of these organizations are subsidized by Egypt. The Palestinian terrorist groups also have Nazi links. El-Fatah uses Nazi recruiters (Karl Van der Put in Belgium and Johann Schuller an ex-Nazi living in Rome). The commanded of a PFLP camp in Basra is a former SS-officer (E. Alten).\n\n“While hatred of Israel is a convenient tool to arouse the masses it is no longer of a strict political nmature rather it has been extended into a hate campaign against the Jews. Such a vicious campaign of attacks on Jews as Jews regardless of their nationality or politics, is evidenced by the following investigation: During 1968.. an international commission of educators, established under the authority of the director-general of UNESCO to examine textbooks used by Arav refugee children in schools financed by UN Relief and Works Agency recommended that 65 of the 127 books examined be “modified” and that 14 be withdrawn from use entirely. The objectionable books were so judged because they distorted history, openly incited violence, or employed “the deplorable language if anti-semitism.”\n\nThe commissions’s initial report noted that “special mention should be made of students’ exercises which are often inspired a preoccupation with indoctrination against Jews rather than by striclty educational aims.”\n\nWhen the director-general of UNESCO approached the Arab governments to correct the books, he got the following answer from the Syrian minister of education Suleiman – Ak – Khash (A’ Thoura 3.5.68): “The hatred which we indoctrinate into the minds of our children is sacred.”\n\nThe implications of such Arab-Nazi cooperation are that Israel must take Arab declarations of intended extermination very seriously. Such genocidal threats are not mere rhetorical exercises, but the expression of a Hitlerian-type racism, which still strongly thrives in Arab lands. The Jewish people lost six million… take Hitler seriously! Israel cannot be blamed for taking the Arabs at their word.\n\nQuite apart from Arab antisemitism, it is worthwhile examining other forms of Arab racism which ordinarily do not receive sufficient public attention. The Arabs as a people have one of the worst historical records on racism known to humanity, having enganged in widespread persecution of non-Arab minorities as well as in the wholesale trading of black Africans to slavery.\n\n(The reader is encouraged to look up the section on “Slavery” in the Encyclopedia Brittanica which describes how Arab slave-traders as recently as the late 19th century raided African villages to provide black male slaves for export and to supply black concubines for the harems of Oman and Zanzibar.\n\nAccording to the British Anti Slavery Society, de facto slavery still exists in Saudi Arabia, Muscat, Oman, Qatar and Sudan  all the slaves are black Africans. It should be mentioned that Egyptian pilots helped in the bombing of Biafra, thereby aiding in the massacre of well over a million Ibos. In Sudan, a war is raged against the blacks of the three southern provinces of Sudan.\n\nUntil 1970 the government ruled by northern Arabs killed 500000 blacks, expelled or kill ed all missionaries (the blacks are Christian or pagan as opposed to the Muslim Arabs), murdered the black leader William Dang, and took away all land from the blacks in areas occupied by the Arab northerners. Hundreds of thousands of blacks from Sudan fled to northern Uganda. Even Arnold Taynbee attacked Arab colonialism in the Sudan. (Paly-Boy April, 1967).\n\nIn Egypt, the five million Copts, who are the bona fide, descendants of the ancient Egyptians, are discriminated against in employment.\n\nIn Syria, there is fierce persecution of the Kurds who, as a Muslim non-Arab minority, have no right to vote because they do not speak Arabic. They have no right to be Syrian citizens for the same reason. It is forbidden for Kurds to own land or to be employed in the public service or elsewhere. They are not allowed to learn in high schools (neither Arab nor Kurdish high schools) or to be taught in the Kurdish language. Tens of thousands of them are deported and dispersed in order to break their majority position in Djazireh.\n\nIn Iraq, a similar war against the two million Kurds was waged between 1943 up to the present time. Since 1958, at least seven agreements between the Kurds and the govermnet were signed. All were broken by Bag[h]dad. In the meantime, 40,000 Kurds were expelled from the suburbs of Kirkuk, 240 villages were destroyed, poisonous gas was used, and hundreds of thousands were killed.\n\nThe above facts are especially interesting in light of Arab propaganda tactics to depict Israel as colonialist and white in order to gain the support of Africans and black Americans.\n\nAll these facts are not given in order to incite hatred but in order to demonstrate the vital necessity of a Jewish state in the Middle East, where, the Jews would not be a persecuted minority. The Arabs have 15 states, the Jews 1 state. Does morality postulate 16 Arab states and no Jewish state?\n\nhttp://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bBZKAAAAIBAJ&sjid=tx4NAAAAIBAJ&pg=4400,4172940&dq=arab-racism+-anti-arab&hl=en\n\nArab Racism Fuels Ethnic Cleansing Attacks In Sudan\n\nThe Arab government backs murderous attacks on blacks’ villages with 80,000 dead so far\n\nBy Ellen Knickmeyer\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nEugene Register-Guard – Jul 2, 2004\n\nDAKAR, Senegal.

This is the first time that the Arab League has adopted a racist stance on what has previously been considered to be an internal Sudanese matter. As such, it marks the internationalisation of the conflict. The resolution was so racist… The resolution incites the Arab world to join Khartoum in its racial and religious war against the South. Egypt now appears prepared to commit its own resources to the war in Sudan… The Arab states are also members of the overtly racist Arab League of Nations which passed a resolution in March condemning any moves towards granting Self- determination for Southern Sudan…\n\nhttp://books.google.com/books?id=4fcPAQAAMAAJ&q=%22racist+arab+league%22&dq=%22racist+arab+league%22\n\nArab League SG a “racist” says Darfur JEM, demands public apology … March 15, 2011 (WASHINGTON) – The Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) today directed fierce criticism at the Arab League Secretary General Amr Moussa over remarks he made last week in which he downplayed the gravity of the Darfur conflict compared to the evolving crisis in Libya.\n\nThe United Nations says that more than 300,000 people were killed and 2.7 million displaced in the eight-year conflict in Sudan’s Western region. Khartoum counters these figures saying no more than 10,000 perished.\n\n“Darfur is no Libya. Darfur since years back the restive situation was a result of foreign interferences and exaggerations in evaluating the situation in Darfur. But we succeeded in recent years in putting the Darfur process on the negotiation table and now there are talks under the [auspices of the] United Nations and the African Union and the Arab League [hosted] by Qatar and there is progress, ” Moussa said in response to a question posed by a journalist on why the Arab League moved swiftly to ask the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) to impose a No-Fly Zone over Libya to protect civilians and not in Darfur.\n\nhttp://www.sudantribune.com/Arab-League-SG-a-racist-says,38296\n\nSudan Darfur rebel spokesman accuses Arab League of discrimination\n\nAl-Sharq al-Awsat website, London – May 27, 2008\n\nSudan Darfur rebel spokesman accuses Arab League of discrimination\n\nText of report by Saudi-owned leading pan-Arab daily Al-Sharq al-Awsat website on 25 May [Reports from London by Mustafa Sirri and Cairo by Sawsan Abu-Hasan: “JEM Accuses the Arab League of Discriminating Among the Sudanese on the Basis of Colour and Ethnic Background”] The Sudanese Justice and Equality Movement [JEM] led by Dr Khalil Ibrahim has directed strongly-worded criticism at the Arab League, describing it as racist and saying that it…\n\nhttp://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NewsLibrary&p_multi=BBAB&d_place=BBAB&p_theme=newslibrary2&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=120EFB55D9BEB2C0&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM\n\nBBC Monitoring International Reports : Sudan Darfur rebel spokesman accuses Arab League of discrimination\n\nBBC Archive – May 27, 2008\n\nhttp://www.google.com/search?q=%22strongly-worded+criticism+at+the+Arab+League,+describing+it+as+racist%22&tbs=nws:1,ar:1&source=newspapers\n\nGermans Probing Anti-semitism\n\nSpokane Daily Chronicle, Jan 14, 1960.\n\nSeveral hundred demonstrated again in Paris last night against the signs of racism.

Iraq’s membership of the Arab League was and is an embodiment of this racist Arabism.\n\nSo what was the first achievement of Iraqi “Kurdish” foreign minister?\n\nMoroccan Berbers Call for Independent Berber State, Say Arab League is “Racist”\n\nIn an interview with the liberal Berber website “Tamazgha,” Mustapha Berhouchi, president of the TADA umbrella group of Moroccan Berber organizations, said that the Berbers need a state of their own: “In a world where a fanatical Islam is looking to acquire nuclear capabilities, and faced with Europe’s hypocritical attitude, the Imazighen (i.e. Berbers), if they want to continue to exist as a people, have no choice but to acquire a state.”\n\nIn a separate statement, the CNCCOT, a Moroccan organization demanding official status for the Berber language in Morocco, called for a new secular and democratic constitution, guarantees of freedom of expression, and an end to Morocco’s membership in the Arab League: “The Moroccan authorities’ membership in illusory, phantom organizations like the Arab League is nothing but a waste of time and money… We demand that Morocco withdraw from the Arab League and from all the racist organizations of which it is a member.”\n\nhttp://www.thememriblog.org/berbertest/blog_personal/en/806.htm\n\nDid he, logically in the spirit of new democracy and openness, insist that Iraq is the country of Arabs and Kurds and cannot be a member of the Arab League unless the league changes its racist organisation and identity to allow the recognition not only of the Kurdish nation in Iraq and Syria but also of many other nations in Arab nation-states such as Amazighi nation, people of South Sudan, Druzes and Copts? The Arab League as a useless ideological racist Arabist institution has existed only to promote Arabism and Arab racism against colonised non-Arab nations. This league has a criminal record in supporting Iraqi Ba’thists’ genocide against our nation in Southern Kurdistan and supporting Syrian Ba’thists’ racist Arabising policies in Western Kurdistan.\n\nhttp://www.kurdmedia.com/article.aspx?id=9285\n\nArab League and KKK are Two Faces for One Coin\n\nBy Elhadi Adam Elomda\n\nDate: March 23, 2005\n\nThe KKK (Ku Klux Klan) is equivalent to the Arab League. This is because of the similarity and agreement of these two terrorist organizations’ goals. The KKK was founded to promote the white man’s superiority in the United States of America. It looks for the dominance of white men within political, economical, and cultural aspects in the USA. The KKK started to achieve its goals by strengthening the relations among the white men in the USA. However, the KKK used discriminative means against the minority black people in the USA in order to achieve its prospective goals. As a result, the back people and disheartened white people revolted against the KKK. Therefore, the KKK was disbanded in the 1940s although it changed its goals of hating the black people into love of white people. By the time the KKK was disbanded in the USA as a terrorist organization, another KKK was born.\n\nThis new KKK was born in a different area and has a dissimilar name from the former KKK. Yet, this new born KKK has similar goals to the former one. The newly formed KKK is named the Arab League. The Arab League was established in order to strengthen the political, economical, and cultural relations between its members. The league membership constituted of any independent Arab countries from any continent. Charter I states that “Any independent Arab state has the right to become a member of the League.”\n\nhttp://www.sudaneseonline.com/earticle2005/mar23-57165.html\n\nNew French Party, Headed by Soustelle, Hits Arab Leagues Racist Policy\n\nOctober 19, 1960\n\nPARIS, Oct. 18 (JTA) –\n\nSharp resolutions condemning the “racist policy” of the Arab League, and attacking President Gamal Abdel Nasser of the United Arab Republic as “a dictator trying to provoke a world conflagration through his actions and propaganda.” were adopted here last night at a meeting of a newly emerging political party, the “Committee for Democratic Defense and Action.” The group is headed by Jacques Soustelle, former close associate of President Charles de Gaulle.\n\nAnother resolution adopted at the meeting called for “equal rights for Jews in Russia.”\n\nM. Soustelle compared Nasser’s pan-Arab policy to “Hitlerism and nazism.” He affirmed strong opposition to the UAR’s candidacy for a seat on the United Nations Security Council, and requested that the French Government “oppose that candidacy with all available means.” Linking Nasserism with “the Kremlin’s subversive movement in Africa and Asia,” M. Soustelle told the meeting: “Nasser is threatening not only Middle East peace but world peace.”\n\nMuch significance was attached in political circles here to Soustelle’s pronouncement against Nasser and pan-Arabism, in view of the fact that the former top Gaullist lieutenant, dropped by President de Gaulle for pursuing a tough line against the Algerian rebels, is about to stage a political comeback. M. Soustelle is expected to announce formally tomorrow the launching of his new party as an active factor on the French political scene.\n\nhttp://archive.jta.org/article/1960/10/19/3061487/new-french-party-headed-by-soustelle-hits-arab-leagues-racist-policy\n\nDoming The “racist Policy” of the Arab League..\n\nCanadian Jewish Chronicle – Oct 28, 1960\n\n[p. 9]\n\nhttp://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jO9OAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ZUwDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6292,4107121\n\nOfficial records: Proces-verbaux officiels / Nations unies, Conseil de securite, Volume 32 – Page 15 – United Nations. Security Council – 1977\n\nThey only have to look at the tortured existence of the small Jewish community of 4500 in Syria They can still recall … From an article signed by General Mustafa T’lass, the Syrian Defence Minister, in the official Syrian Army newspaper, Tishrin, dated 10 September 1976, I quote the following: “My Palestinian comrades, the Moslems of Lebanon have begun to hate you because you are interfering in their daily life and their personal liberty. What then is the aim of your liberation? Is your sublime target the massacre of Lebanon? Or perhaps your grand design was to slaughter the residents of the Semiramis Hotel in Damascus? You are mistaken, Palestinian comrades, because you arouse nothing but disgust among all honest Arab citizens . . .”. Then he goes on to state: “no regime will ever accept the illegal acts of the PLO within its borders”. That is a statement with which Israel, incidentally, is completely in accord and which reflects our position too.\n\nSo I say to Mr. Nuseibeh, please do not lecture us about Arab solicitude for Jews in Arab countries- especially you, the representative of a country whose citizenship law No. 6 of 4 February 1954 states in paragraph 3, subparagraph 3: “Any man will be a Jordanian subject … if he is not Jewish.” That is just another example of the inherent Arab racism.

Israeli nationalism — Zionism — has been declared racism. The Arab League enforces secondary and tertiary boycotts against Israel. Jews may not enter Saudi Arabia, except for American soldiers. Malaysia forbids the performance of “Jewish” music. This endless policy of boycott and non-recognition is officially the policy of most Arab states. Countries like Libya, Iraq or Saudi Arabia have never suggested that they would make peace if Israel did X or Y or Z. Their opposition to Israel, supported by leftists everywhere in the world, is one of permanent enmity.

It began with all intents and purposes at Harvard and MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) with a high profile petition on these campus to divest from Israel. The DFI movement has its roots in the original Arab-League Boycott of Israel. This antecedent movement is unabashedly anti-semitic and racist, having started with a de facto boycott as early as 1922 against Jewish interests, not Israeli interests, 26 years prior to the establishment of the State of Israel. The Arab League Council formally instated a boycott on December 2, 1945: “Jewish products and manufactured goods shall be considered undesirable to the Arab countries”. That, might I remind you, is a little less than 3 years before the establishment of the State of Israel and 22 years before the “occupation” began following the 6-Day War in 1967.\n\nThe Arab-League Boycott and the modern DFI are not one in the same; however, they share the same ideological roots of racism and anti-Semitism towards anyone from Israel. During the initial years of the Arab-League Boycott, all products, whether made by Jew or Arab were boycotted…\n\nhttp://www.jfedsrq.org/blog_archive.aspx?id=244&year=2010&month=5\n\nRacism risk in calls for Israeli boycott | The Australian Sep 19, 2009 … Calls to boycott Israel are nothing new.

The story began, of course, in 1948, when the Palestinian “nakba” occurred. It was also the beginning of the controversy of the Arab-Israeli conflict, with the blame heaped on Israel, because it allegedly expelled Palestinian refugees, turning them into miserable wretches.

I see similarities between the issue and my personal experiences growing up. I was raised in an Arabic society in Lebanon that took impressionable young minds and filled them with propaganda. Minds that were young and didn’t know any better.\n\nI am an eyewitness and a victim of the indoctrination of hate education, racism, intolerance, intimidation and fabricated lies by my government and religious influences.\n\nThis indoctrination was for one purpose: To eradicate the newborn state of Israel; to foment hatred and wipe out Jewish presence in an Arab dominated world. For Arabs, the simple existence of Israel was viewed as a catastrophe…al nakbah!\n\nThis pan Arab hate indoctrination was a reaction to Jews returning to their homeland after Arabic and Islamic belief for 1400 years that the Yahuds were vanquished and subjugated as Dhimmi.\n\nI believe hate motivated indoctrination fosters irrational thinking and faulty reasoning whether it influenced my education as a child in Lebanon or the ‘advocacy education’ that roils the classrooms here at Columbia university. This is the root cause, for the controversy swirling around several members of the Middle East Asia Languages Arts and Culture (MEALAC) faculty and their alleged intimidation of students and other faculty.\n\nhttp://www.danielpipes.org/comments/21693\n\nThe Mufti of Berlin\n\nArab-Nazi collaboration is a taboo topic in the West.\n\n[September, 2009]\n\n…the Palestinian wartime leader “was one of the worst and fanatical fascists and anti-Semites,” …. He intervened with the Nazis to prevent the escape to Palestine of thousands of European Jews, who were sent instead to the death camps. He also conspired with the Nazis to bring the Holocaust to Palestine. The mufti “invented a new form of Jew-hatred by recasting it in an Islamic mold,” according to German scholar Matthias Küntzel. The mufti’s fusion of European anti-Semtism—particularly the ”’genocidal”’ variety—with Koranic views of Jewish wickedness has become the hallmark of Islamists world-wide, from al Qaeda to Hamas and Hezbollah. During his time in Berlin, the mufti ran the Nazis’ Arab-language propaganda radio program, which incited Muslims in the Mideast to “kill the Jews wherever you find them. This pleases God, history and religion.” Among the many listeners was also the man later known as Ayatollah Khomeini, who used to tune in to Radio Berlin every evening, according to Amir Taheri’s biography of the Iranian leader. Khomeini’s disciple Mahmoud Ahmadinejad still spews the same venom pioneered by the mufti as do Islamic hate preachers around the world.\n\nMuslim Judeophobia is not—as is commonly claimed—a reaction to the Mideast conflict but one of its main “root causes.” It has been fueling Arab rejection of a Jewish state long before Israel’s creation.\n\nhttp://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203440104574400532495168894.html\n\nNever-ending Islamic Conspiracies… 20 Jan 2005 … African Muslims regularly accusing “Zionists” of spreading AIDS…They were told that the ‘Jews’ were behind the contamination of the vaccine which might cause Aids or infertility … In Iraq today, conspiracy theories are spreading fast and easy.

As a result of escalating Arab terrorism,\n\nNazi-Germany decided to support the Mufti and his movement. On July 15, 1937,\n\nthe Mufti told the German Consul-General in Jerusalem, W. Dohle, that the\n\nPalestinian Arabs were united in their “sympathy for the new Germany”. But it\n\nwas not only the Mufti’s burgeoning relationship with Nazi-Germany that made his\n\nilk of fascism so dangerous. The Mufti’s views, deeply influenced by the Nazis\n\nfascist ideology and his diplomatic initiatives quickly became the single\n\nunifying political cause celebre of the entire Arab world.

One example is Sami Shawkat who is famous for his 1933 speech “Sina’at al-Mawt” (manufacture of death) in which he rationalizes mass violence and war as the way to achieve Arab aspirations. Tragically, this speech was widely distributed in Arab schools and in Iraq in particular. It is interesting that Shawkat teaches that “force is the soil which sprouts the seeds of truth”. Although not widely known, Shawkat was a main force in the organization of the Futuwwa Youth Organization – a movement modeled directly after the Nazi Hitler Youth Movement. The Futuwwa set the pace for future Arab chauvinist movements, such as the B’aath party of Iraq and today’s followers of Bin Laden. It is interesting to note that Shawkat’s ideas became somewhat too hot to handle, even for the pan-Arabists – Satia Al-Husri later disowned Sami Shawkat.\n\nIt is worth noting that Sami Shawkat’s brother, Naji, who by 1941 was a member of the Arab committee in Iraq (which had absorbed the Futuwwa), gave Franz von Papen (a high ranking German official of Nazi Germany in 1941) a letter which actually congratulated Hitler for the brutality that he inflicted upon the Jews.\n\nhttp://www.venusproject.com/ecs/aFarrokhArab.html\n\nThe terror behind Iraq’s Jewish exodus\n\nJulia Magnet Last Updated: 10:39AM BST 28 Apr 2003\n\n“In Baghdad, there are only 30 Jews left. Thirty. You can count them.”\n\n…As he weeps, his wife gestures at the television set in the corner of the sitting-room, where they are constantly flicking between al-Jazeera, Sky and Fox.\n\n“It’s because we are watching this all the time,” she says. “It came back.” Their old life has invaded their clean London sitting-room, and all the memories of persecution in Baghdad are flooding back – “like a dream”.\n\nIt wasn’t always a hard life. In the 1920s, Baghdad was 40 per cent Jewish: Jews made up the largest single community in the city and controlled up to 95 per cent of business.\n\nThe first finance minister of the country – established after the First World War, when the British drew up new borders – was a Jew, as was the justice minister. And when the British imported King Faisal I to Iraq, in 1921, one of his first visits was to the leaders of the Jewish community.\n\nAs late as 1948, after Israel’s war of independence, there were still about 150,000 to 180,000 Jews in Iraq. Now there are between 30 and 40 left in the entire country. In 50 years, one of the oldest Jewish communities in the world has all but vanished.\n\nWithin the borders of Iraq, of course, is the city of Babylon, where the Jews came after their first exile from Jerusalem in 587bc. Iraq is also the birthplace of Abraham. Islam arrived only when the Arabs invaded in ad641 – more than 1,000 years after the Jews had first settled.\n\n… “In the first half of the 20th century,” he says, “there was a sense in which Baghdad was a Jewish city: we were the educated, the middle classes.”\n\n[…] Sadly, what this couple remember is only an interlude: the persecution of the Jews had started 20 years before. In June 1941, there was the Farhud – or pogrom – during which “the mob wreaked havoc”, recalls Kahtan.\n\n“For two days, they killed Jews in the streets, kidnapped girls, raped them, killed them and mutilated the bodies. They burned property, looted houses – it’s estimated that about 600 Jews were killed in those two days.”\n\nFor Jews born later, such as the Edgware couple, the public hangings of Jewish teenagers in 1969 and the omnipresence of the secret police are fresher memories. But their insistence on the “nice life” of the past echoes a pattern set long before.\n\n… In the Thirties, the rise of pan-Arab nationalism coincided with the second King Faisal’s admiration of the Nazis.\n\nBy 1936, says Sylvia Kedourie, widow of the eminent Middle Eastern scholar Elie Kedourie, there were “episodes of Jews being killed in the streets that led to a growing sense of insecurity”. Meanwhile, Zionism was on the rise, and though the Iraqi Jews were hardly Zionists, many Arabs began to see them as hostile, intent on conquering Arab territory.\n\nThe Nazi agenda crystallised Arab anti-semitism. On April 3, 1941, the rabidly pro-Nazi Rashid Ali, a former prime minister, with a group of similarly inclined politicians and army officers, staged a coup against Faisal II. Rashid Ali’s aim was to root out British influence and ally Iraq with the Nazis.\n\nHis new “government” declared war on Britain, and was promptly defeated. On May 31, Rashid Ali fled. But his soldiers and policemen, inflamed by Nazi ideas, started the Farhud – aided by the Arab mob. Although the British Army was stationed outside Baghdad, it waited for two days before stopping the massacre: “They didn’t want to wound Iraqi pride,” says Kahtan.\n\n“I was a very young child at the time, but certain things are imprinted on your mind. On the first day, the mob came to our door to do their business. The house was rented from a Muslim neighbour, of the old generation, and he came down with his rifle, shot in the air, and said: ‘These people are under my protection; anyone who lifts a finger will be dead’ – and he drove them off. […] “When the whole question of the partition of Palestine came up,” says Dr Zubaida, “all the Arab countries sent armies to Palestine, including Iraq. This generated a kind of hysteria, and then Jews who were prominent in public life started being sacked and students in higher education started being expelled.”\n\nKahtan was 10 in 1948, when the state of Israel was declared. The son of his Muslim neighbour – the one who had saved his family – called him into his house.\n\n“He was 19. He showed me a map and said: ‘Today, seven armies are going to attack Israel, kill all the Jews and throw the survivors into the sea.’ Now, that was the son – you see what a change of mentality had taken place. I’ll leave it to your imagination to think what change of mentality has taken place between 1948 and now.”\n\nIt doesn’t take much. In 1949, a court of law falsely accused Safiq Adas, one of Iraq’s most prominent Jewish businessmen, of selling arms to Israel. The charge was ridiculous: Adas sold scrap metal to Italy.\n\nHe protested his innocence and refused to pay the bribes that might have saved his life. Although he had some of the best lawyers in Iraq, his defence was not allowed to call witnesses. He was hanged in front of his house as his wife and children watched. His Muslim partner was never charged and continued the business.\n\nThis, Elie Kedourie has written, was the moment when the Jews realised the full extent of their vulnerability: they were no longer under the protection of the law and there was now little difference between the mob and Iraqi court justice. Everyone I spoke to mentioned Safiq Adas’s “trial”. […]\n\nHis escape on a smuggler’s boat, like all those in the 1960s and 70s, was organised by Israeli agents who mapped out the routes, paid the necessary bribes and met the refugees in Iran. “Israel was paying to save the Jews,” Kahtan said. “I owe my life to the state of Israel.”\n\nAfter the Six-Day War, the Iraqi government took its revenge on the few thousand Jews left in Baghdad. The woman in Edgware recalls: “They started putting young people – youngsters of 16 years old – on trial, just because they were Jews.\n\n“They would just catch them in the streets – whomever they could find – and take them to prison. Then they would torture them and put them on trial as spies.\n\n“And they hanged them in the main square of Baghdad. People were dancing around the gallows there, dancing and celebrating, distributing sweets. ‘What a big day, what a happy day’, catching the Jews and hanging them.”\n\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iraq/1427687/The-terror-behind-Iraqs-Jewish-exodus.html\n\nThe silent exodus of Jewish refugees from Muslim lands\n\nHere is the trailer for the superb filmmaker Pierre Rehov‘s Silent Exodus. Silent Exodus was selected at the International Human Rights Film Festival of Paris in 2004 and presented at the UN Geneva Human Rights Annual Convention that same year.\n\nHere is a summary of the film:\n\nIn 1948 nearly one million Jews lived in Arab lands. But In barely twenty years, they have become forgotten fugitives, expelled from their native lands, forgotten by history and where the victims themselves have hidden their fate under a cloak of silence.\n\nA people whom legend have always associated with “wandering” many of these Jews from Arab lands had lived there for thousands of years and accepted their fate, through good times and bad times.\n\nBut 1948, the beginning of their exodus, also saw the birth of the State of Israel.\n\nAnd, while the Arab armies were preparing to invade the young refugee-country, the survivors of the Shoah were piling up in rickety boats. Meanwhile a few hundred thousand Arabs from Palestine were getting ready to flee their homes, convinced that they would return as winners and conquerors.\n\nSoon – by a terrible twist of fate they, as well, began to fill up refugee camps and passed on their refugee status to new generations.\n\nThe Jews, however, did not receive refugee status.\n\nThey had just rediscovered the land of their birthright.\n\nAnd if they came from Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Syria, Iraq or from Yemen, if they had lost everything, even their relatives and their cemeteries, they were ready to rebuild their lives in the West and for many – in Israel – and try to forget their past.\n\nWithout ever asking for compensation or the right of return, or even wishing that their story be told…\n\nAnd here also is an illuminating article on the subject by Magdi Cristiano Allam, “The Arabs Without the Jews: Roots of a Tragedy” (translated from Italian by Lyn and Lawrence Julius):\n\nIsrael is the keeper of a mutilated Arab identity, the repository for the guilty consciences of the Arab peoples, the living witness to a true history of the Arab countries, continuously denied, falsified and ignored.\n\nSeeing Pierre Rehov’s documentary film ‘The Silent Exodus’ about the expulsion and flight of a million Sephardi Jews helped me gain a better understanding of the tragedy of a community that was integral and fundamental to Arab society. Above all it has revealed to me the very essence of the catastrophe that befell it, a catastrophe which the mythical Arab nation has never once called into question. In a flash of insight I could see that the tragedy of the Jews and the catastrophe of the Arabs are two facets of the same coin. By expelling the Jews who were settled on the southern and eastern shores of the Mediterranean centuries before they were arabised and islamised, the Arabs have in fact begun the lethal process of mutilating their own identity and despoiling their own history. By losing their Jews the Arabs have lost their roots and have ended up by losing themselves.\n\nAs has often happened in history, the Jews were the first victims of hatred and intolerance. All the “others” had their turn soon enough, specifically the Christians and other religious minorities, heretical and secular Muslims and finally, those Muslims who do not fit exactly into the ideological framework of the extreme nationalists and Islamists. There has not been a single instance in this murky period of our history when the Arab states have been ready to condemn the steady exodus of Christians, ethnic-religious minorities, enlightened and ordinary Muslims, while Muslims plain and simple have become the primary victims of Islamic terror.\n\nUnderlying the Arab ‘malaise’ is an identity crisis that neither Nasserist nor Ba’athist pan-Arabism, nor the Islamism of the Saudi Wahabis, the Muslim Brotherhood, Khomeini and Bin Laden has been able to solve. It’s a contagious identity crisis, spreading to and taking hold of the Arab and Muslim communities in the West.\n\nI remember that around the mid-1970s the Arab exam in civic education taken in both state and public schools in Egypt defined Arab identity thus: “the Arabs are a nation united by race, blood, history, geography, religion and destiny.” This was a falsification of an historical truth based on ethno-religious pluralism, an ideological deception aimed at erasing all differences and promoting the theory of one race overlapping with a phantom Arab nation in thrall to unchallengeable leaders. It was directly inspired by Nazi and fascist theories of racial purity and supremacy which appealed to the leadership and ideologues of pan-Arabism and Islamism. It is no wonder that in this context Manichean Israel is perceived as a foreign body to be rejected, a cancer produced by American imperialism to divide and subjugate the Arab world.\n\nThe historical truth is that the Middle Eastern peoples, in spite of their arabisation and islamisation from the 7th century onward, continued to maintain a specific identity reflecting their indigenous and millenarian ethnic roots – cultural, linguistic, religious and national. The Berbers, for example, who constitute half the population of Morocco and a third of that of Algeria, have nothing or very little in common with the Bedouin tribes at the heart of Saudi or Jordanian society. When in 1979 Egypt was sidelined from the Arab League for signing a peace treaty with Israel President Sadat restored its Pharaonic Egyptian identity which he proudly contrasted with its Arabness. Here was an isolated but significant attempt to recapture an indigenous identity – advertising historical honesty and political liberation while saying ‘enough is enough’ to rampant lies and demagogy. Before the screening of the ‘Silent Exodus’ in the Congress Hall in Milan, a gentleman in his Seventies came up to me and said, in perfect Egyptian dialect: “I am a Jew from Alexandria. I have recently been in Tunisia and Algeria. I have to say that people there are not like us, they don’t have the sense of irony that distinguishes us Egyptians.” I smiled and replied that indeed, the Egyptians have a reputation as jokers. They are capable of laughing at anything, including themselves.\n\nWhat struck me was the “us” – “us Egyptians”: even if we were both Italian citizens, he a Jew and I a Muslim. It reminded me that just after the 1967 defeat, I discovered by complete accident that the girl I was in love with – we both were 15 – was Jewish. For me she was a girl like any other. But for the police who submitted me to intensive interrogation she was a ‘spy for Israel’ and I was her accomplice.\n\nIn fact ‘the Silent Exodus’ testifies that anti-Semitism and the pogroms against the Jews of the Middle East preceded the birth of the state of Israel and the advent of ideological pan-Arabism and pan-Islamism. It infers that hatred and violence against the Jews could originate in an ideological interpretation of the Koran and the life of the prophet Muhammed taken out of context.\n\nIt would be a mistake to generalise and not to take into account that for long periods coexistence was possible between the Muslims, Christians and Jews of the Middle East, at a time when in Europe the Catholic Inquisition was repressing the Jews and when the Nazi Holocaust was trying to exterminate them. In the same way, one cannot ignore Israel’s responsibility together with Arab leaders in the emergence of the drama of millions of Palestinian refugees and the unresolved question of a Palestinian state.\n\nThe fact remains that of the million Jews who at the end of 1945 were an integral part of the Arab population, only 5,000 remain. These Arab Jews, expelled or who fled at a moment’s notice, have become an integral part of the Israeli population. They continue to represent a human injustice and an historical tragedy. Above all, they are indicative of an Arab civil and identity catastrophe. That is why to recognise the wrongs committed towards the Arab Jews – as the maverick Libyan leader colonel Gaddafi has recently done – by objectively rediscovering their past and millenarian roots, by finding again their tolerant and plural history and by totally and sincerely reconciling themselves with themselves, the Arabs could free themselves from the ideological obscurantism which has relegated them to the most basic level of human development and has changed the region into the most problematic and confict-ridden on earth.\n\nhttp://www.pierrerehov.com/exodus.htm\n\nRoughly half of Israel’s 5 million Jews are Jewish refugees from Arab countries or their descendants, and they received no humanitarian aid from the United Nations. To this day, the Arab states have refused to pay any compensation to the hundreds of thousands of Jews who were forced to abandon their property before fleeing their homelands. Israel has consequently maintained that any agreement to compensate the Palestinian refugees must also include Arab compensation for Jewish refugees\n\nhttp://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/jewref.html\n\nIsraCast: MIDDLE EAST REFUGEES – PALESTINIAN & JEWISH\n\nFriday, March 14, 2008\n\nIrwin Cotler: ‘There In No Moral Or Legal Basis For The Demand That Palestinian Refugees Be Allowed To Return To State Of Israel’\n\n‘Some One Million Jewish Refugees Were Forced To Flee Arab Countries Compared With An Estimated 550,000 Palestinian Refugees’\n\n‘Arab League Decision To Reject Partition Plan Of 1947 And Declare War On Nascent Jewish State Was Responsible For Both Jewish & Palestinian Refugees’\n\nhttp://www.isracast.com/article.aspx?id=906\n\nIn The House Of Ishmael: A history Of The Jews In Muslim Land, By Martin Gilbert\n\nIndependent – Robert Irwin – ‎Dec 2, 2010\n\n‎\n\nThe paradox is that violent Arab racism and paranoia helped populate Israel.

It was far more of a conscious act of ethnic cleansing by the Arab world than the flight of Palestinians from Israel in 1948. The “Palestine question” acted primarily as a catalyst for accelerating the preexisting long-term trends of decolonization, modernization, and Arab nationalism that engulfed many Christian and long- established Jewish communities in the Arab world. From the beginning of the 1930s the dominant strands of Arab nationalism turned increasingly anti-Zionist and anti- Semitic, leaving little place for Jews or other non-Muslim minorities in the Arab world. As a result, Jews became more and more aware of their acute vulnerability—a condition that was reinforced as Arab nationalist leaders turned to Nazi and fascist models for their inspirations…\n\nhttp://books.google.com/books?id=Lzs48d3tudsC&pg=PT887\n\nThe war of ideas: Jihad against democracy – Page 32 – Walid Phares – Macmillan, 2008, ISBN: 023060255X – 266 pages\n\nIn a global comparison, the evolution of Pan-Arabism (Baathism being one of its emanations) has resembled German national socialism and Italian Fascism more than French, British, and Italian liberal nationalisms.

Her husband lost his job. Taken ill, she had remained behind in Egypt with her new baby, while he left to look for work in Europe. She departed with nothing ‘ along with 25,000 other Jews expelled by Nasser and forced to sign a document pledging that they would never return. In a final act of spite, the customs officers ransacked her suitcase and even her baby’s carrycot.\n\nSarah was speaking at a House of Lords briefing as part of the Justice for Jews from Arab Countries congress. JJAC, an international coalition of 77 organisations, is holding its inaugural congress in London, and aims to highlight the neglected rights of (according to indisputable UN figures) 856,000 Jewish refugees like Sarah.\n\nThe exodus began 60 years ago when Arab states, hell-bent on crushing the new state of Israel militarily, also turned on their peaceful Jewish communities. Street violence killed over 150 Jews. Within 10 years, more than half the Jews had fled or been expelled, following discriminatory legislation , extortion, arrests, internment and executions. Those who remained became subjugated, political hostages of the Arab-Israeli conflict.\n\nToday 99.5% – all but 4,500 – have gone. As the historian Nathan Weinstock has observed, not even the Jews of 1939 Germany had been so thoroughly “ethnically cleansed”.\n\nThe displacement of Jews from Arab countries was not just a backlash to the creation of Israel and the Arabs’ humiliating defeat. The “push” factors were already in place. Arab League states drafted a law in November 1947 branding their Jews as enemy aliens. But non-Muslim minorities, historically despised as dhimmis with few rights, were already being oppressed by Nazi-inspired pan-Arabism and Islamism. These factors sparked the conflict with Zionism, and drive it to this day.\n\nThe Jewish “Nakba” – Arabic for “catastrophe” ‘ not only emptied cities like Baghdad (a third Jewish); it tore apart the cultural, social and economic fabric in Arab lands. Jews lost homes, synagogues, hospitals, schools, shrines and deeded land five times the size of Israel. Their ancient heritage – predating Islam by 1,000 years ‘ was destroyed.\n\nThe Jewish state, which struggled to take in 600,000, many of them stateless, is both a response to Arab antisemitism, and the legitimate political expression of an indigenous Middle Eastern people. Half Israel’s Jewish population is descended from refugees from Arab and Muslim lands.\n\nArab governments have never admitted committing mass violations of Jewish human and civil rights, much less apologised or offered restitution. Over 120 UN resolutions deal with the 711,000 Palestinian refugees; not one refers to the greater number of Jewish refugees. Although peace initiatives have been worded to refer generically to the “refugee problem”, Jewish and Arab, Israel has been reluctant to politicise the Jewish refugee issue, having successfully integrated them as full citizens: Arab denial has thus conspired with Israeli silence to airbrush Jewish refugees out of the picture, leading to obfuscation, distortion and decontextualisation.\n\nThis April, JJAC scored a major success, however, when the US House of Representatives adopted its first resolution (pdf) on Jewish refugees; future resolutions mentioning Palestinian refugees must refer explicitly to Jewish refugees from Arab countries.\n\nThe resolution is about recognition, not restitution, although Jewish losses have been quantified at twice Palestinian losses. Such resolutions could lead to a peace settlement by recognising that there were victims on both sides. Thus justice for Jews is not just a moral imperative, but the key to reconciliation.\n\nMoreover, a major hurdle to peace could be removed if the Palestinian “right of return” were counterbalanced by the Jewish right not to return to Arab tyrannies, recognising a de facto population exchange of roughly equal numbers.\n\nThe Jewish refugees, who spent up to 12 years in Israeli ma’abarot (transit camps), could also serve as a model for the resettlement (in host Arab countries or an eventual Palestinian state) of Arab refugees languishing in camps.\n\nMeanwhile, awareness of the “Jewish Nakba” is growing: a Libyan Jew who fled in fear of her life has addressed the UN Human Rights Council. Jewish refugees were mentioned at Westminster and discussed on BBC radio. In the US, Canada and at the European parliament, the campaign for justice is steaming ahead.\n\nAt Tuesday’s briefing, Sarah will be testifying to the fact that two sets of refugees emerged from the Arab-Israeli conflict. The UK will be urged to look at what role it could usefully play in seeking to resolve issues affecting all Middle East refugees. Fifty-two years ago, Sarah rejoined her husband in England; they rebuilt their lives and put Egypt behind them. This does not mean that she should be denied justice.\n\nhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/jun/25/middleeast.middleeastthemedia\n\nA Backgrounder of the Nazi Activities in North Africa and the Middle East During the Era of the Holocaust\n\nKey issues the reader should note: 1. The Islamic leadership (vis-à-vis the Mufti) did in fact have a significant relationship with the German government during the era of the Holocaust. 2. Pro-Nazi sentiment often resulted in grave consequences against the Jews in Arab countries during the Holocaust. 3. The Germans influenced the Arabs resulting in incitement that led to attacks against Jews in Arab cities during the Holocaust. 4. The Mufti promoted the idea to the Nazis of destroying the Jews before they could escape to Palestine. 5. The Axis powers persecuted Jews in North Africa during the Holocaust…\n\n• Bernard Lewis states: “We know that within weeks of Hitler’s coming to power in 1933, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem got in touch with the German consul general in Jerusalem, Doctor Heinrich Wolff, and offered his services.” 1 There, the Mufti spoke approvingly of the Nazi’s Jewish policies, particularly of the anti-Jewish boycott in Germany.\n\n• A Pan-Arab Committee established at Baghdad in the Spring of 1933 approached Fritz Grobba, the German Ambassador to Iraq, two years later with proposals for closer ties and cooperation.\n\n• Hitler’s Mein Kampf was translated into four different Arabic translations and circulated between 1933-1939 in Beirut, Baghdad, Cairo and Berlin.\n\n• In the first few months of WWII, shops in the towns of Syria would frequently show posters with Arabic sayings: “In heaven God is your ruler, on earth Hitler.” In the streets of Aleppo… Damascus a popular verse in a local dialect said: “No more ‘Monsieur’, no more ‘Mister’-God in heaven, on earth Hitler!”\n\nhttp://www.paulbogdanor.com/holocaust/mideast.pdf\n\nNazi Hatred Dwells in the Arab World\n\nBy Shelomo Alfassa February 23, 2007\n\n…Although the Allies killed Nazi troops, destroyed their buildings, burned Nazi books, and even the fact that German Fuehrer killed himself, the Nazi spirit lived on. This spirit of Jew hatred was brought into the Arab world by Amin Al-Husseini, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem.\n\nThe relationship between Amin Al-Husseini and the Third Reich was strengthened when the Mufti visited the German Consul General at Jerusalem in 1937. After that, he met with Eichmann when he visited Palestine. This was when the Nazis were examining the possibility of deporting German Jews to Palestine. It has been reported that based on war-crimes testimony and the Eichmann trial transcripts, Eichmann and the Mufti enjoyed a close relationship. The Mufti would soon become the spiritual leader of the Islamic legions that were trained by-and-for the Nazis.\n\nThe rise of Hitler to power in 1933 marked a turning point in the new mufti?s activities. He sent a cable of congratulations to the Nazi leader and expressed support for the Jewish boycott in Germany. Soon after Hitler’s Mein Kampf was translated into four different Arabic translations and circulated between 1933-1939 in Beirut, Baghdad, Cairo and Berlin. In the first few months of WWII, shops in the towns of Syria would frequently show posters with Arabic sayings: “In heaven God is your ruler, on earth Hitler.” In the streets of Aleppo, Homs and Damascus a popular verse in a local dialect said: “No more ‘Monsieur’, no more ‘Mister’-God in heaven, on earth Hitler!”\n\nAnti-Jewish feeling continued to mount in the Middle East during the 1930s, as the Fascist and Nazi regimes and doctrines made increasing sense to many Arab nationalists. King Abdul Aziz of Saudi Arabia sought German arms and contacts and was favorably received. Various delegations of Syrians and Iraqis attended the Nrnberg party congresses, and there were several different Arabic translations of Mein Kampf. Both the German and Italian regimes were active in propaganda in the Arab world, and there was much pro-German sentiment in Egypt.\n\nAnti-Semitic elements seized upon the Palestine problem and Arab Revolt of\n\n1936-1939 to portray international Jewry, including the Jews of the Maghrib, in a negative way to the Muslims, many of whom expressed solidarity with the Palestinian Arabs against Zionism and the British Authorities in the Mandate. Nazi propaganda broadcasts from Berlin and Stuttgart, as well as broadcasts from fascist Italy, added fuel to the ongoing anti-Jewish campaigns.\n\nAs part of the new, tough policy against Arab violence, the British dismissed Al-Husseini from his post as head of the Supreme Moslem Council. Fearing arrest, on October 12, 1937, the grand mufti donned disguise and fled to Lebanon, where the French gave him asylum. During 1937, Damascus was center for anti-Jewish activities. During this same year, a Nazi delegation went to Syria where a symbiosis was developed that would lead to intensified anti-Jewish sentiment, especially among both German and Arab youth.\n\nNazi Germany started transmitting in Arabic for the first time in April 1938. Germany thus became an Italian radio surrogate, providing a new programming dimension by the addition of anti-Jewish and anti-British themes broadcast by several prominent Arab exiles, including Rashid Ali El-Ghailani, an ex-prime minister of Iraq, and the Mufti, Al-Husseini.\n\nThe Mufti developed a world headquarters in Germany. In an office in Berlin, his activities included: 1. radio propaganda; 2. espionage and fifth column activities in the Middle East; 3. organizing Muslims into military units in Axis-occupied countries and in North Africa and Russia; and 4. establishment of the Arab Legions and the Arab Brigade. These groups were trained by the Nazis and used by them. The Mufti’s radio broadcasts were some of the most violent pro-Axis broadcasts ever produced. He had at least six stations, Berlin, Zeissen, Bari, Rome, Tokyo and Athens. He used these radio broadcasts to tell Muslims across the world to commit acts of sabotage and kill the Jews.\n\nHitler had made it clear that the project of killing Jews was by no means confined to Europe. As he explained to the Mufti, “his hopes of military victory in Africa and the Middle East would bring about the destruction of Jews in the Arab World.” In November of 1941 Hitler informed the Mufti at a meeting in Berlin that he intended to kill every Jew living in the Arab world, including those in Palestine as well as “Syria, Iraq, Iran, the Arabian peninsula, Egypt, and French Northwest Africa.” Hitler asserted that, in the event of a German advance into the Middle East, the German objective would be the “destruction” of “Judaism” in Palestine.\n\nDuring 1941, in Mosul, Iraq, pro-Nazi Arab activists continued to propagandize against Jews. In Baghdad, when the war film For Freedom showed in cinemas, audiences cheered Hitler and booed Churchill. Leaflets circulated: “Rashid Ali, the Leader of all the Arabs, is returning with ropes and gallows to hang a number of criminal Jews, Christian traitors and other enemies of Islam.”\n\nOctober 5, 1943, the Mufti arrived in Frankfort, Germany visiting the Research Institute on the Jewish Problem where he declared that Arabs and Germans were, “Partners and allies in the battle against world Jewry.” The Mufti beamed radio sermons to the Balkans, the countries of North Africa, and the Muslims in India. Arabs in Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, Iraq and Egypt were called upon for Jihad against the British, these statements included the suggestion Muslims could “save their souls by massacring the Jewish infidels” they came across.\n\nIn a letter to Himmler, dated September 28, 1944, General Berger of the Waffen S.S. reported: “Today the Mufti came to see me for a long talk. He talked about his work and noted happily that the day is nearing he will head an army to conquer Palestine.” It was during this same year that the Mufti developed an Arab Brigade in 1944 that included Arabs trained in Holland by the Germans.\n\nIt was said the Mufti even visited Auschwitz and Maldanek. In both of these death camps, he paid close attention to the efficiency of the crematorium, spoke to the leading personnel and was generous in his praise for those who were reported as particularly conscientious in their work. He was on friendly terms with such notorious practitioners of the “Final Solution” as Rudolf Hess, the overlord of Auschwitz; Franz Zeireis of Mauthausen; Dr. Seidl of Theresienstadt; and Kramer, the butcher of Belsen.\n\nAfter VE Day, May 8, 1945, Nazi officials were prepared to allow Jews to be diverted from concentration camps and even let children go to Palestine via “illegal” ships — all in exchange for cash. Yet, Al-Husseini insisted they get dispatched to concentration camps. That same year, liberated Yugoslavia sought to indict the Mufti as a war criminal for his activities in Bosnia, but with help from the Nazi SS, the Mufti had already escaped Germany with other members of his clan.”\n\nWhile it is easy to reinvent history, it is not easy to overlook original first hand documents, tens of thousands which show the Mufti of Jerusalem in bed with Hitler. As Dr. Bernard Lewis of Princeton University recently said, “The Nazi propaganda impact was immense. We see it in Arabic memoirs of the period….”\n\nThe fierce anti-Jewish hatred that was exacerbated by the Mufti in the Islamic world, fueled by the German war machine, continues to resonate today throughout the Arab and Persian world. Incitement, instituted decades earlier, remains a root cause of anti-Semitism as well as the reason for hostility toward the State of Israel after its formation. This is the reason why over 900,000 Jewish people, born in Arab counries, were made refugees after 1948. Simply, because while the Nazis were destroyed and the Holocaust ended, the intense hostility instituted during that era lived on — and continues to live on in the Islamic world.\n\nhttp://web.israelinsider.com/views/10767.htm\n\nDilemmas of Dhimmitude\n\nLyn Julius\n\nJewish Quarterly. No. 197. Spring 2005\n\n[…]\n\nNewly independent Iraq gave formal undertakings on minority rights when joining the League of Nations in 1932 — and massacred thousands of Assyrian Christians within the year. Xenophobic nationalism, together with anti-British and anti-French feeling, gave rise to political parties and paramilitary youth movements of the Nazi and fascist type. The German envoy to Iraq, Dr Fritz Grobba, set about disseminating Nazi ideology and anti-Jewish propaganda, reinforcing local prejudice. Dozens of Jews were quietly dismissed (although some were reinstated after the community protested). Laws were gradually brought in to deprive Jews of jobs, then education and, eventually, property, residence and free movement. The Mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin Al-Husseini, colluded with the ex-Prime Minister, Rashid Ali, to engineer a pro-Nazi coup, eventually culminating in the farhoud massacre of 1941. For two days and one night of looting, rape and murder, the mob rampaged through Jewish districts of Baghdad. One hundred and seventy Jews were killed.\n\nNaturally, the Palestine question was also to have serious repercussions on the Jewish population. Menahem Salih Daniel, a Baghdad Jewish leader, expressed his misgivings as early as 1922 in a letter to the Secretary of the Zionist Organisation in London (quoted by Nessim Rejwan), even though there had as yet been no active resistance to Zionism:\n\nIt is… the feeling of every Arab that it is a violation of his legitimate rights, which it is his duty to denounce and fight to the best of his ability. Iraq always having been an active centre of Arab culture and activity, the public mind is always stirred up as regards Palestine.\n\nOne Jewess, growing up in the 1930s, recalls how the mob would rampage every anniversary of the Balfour declaration carrying clubs dipped in tar. It fell to a kindly neighbour to shelter her until the mob had passed.\n\nIn the 1941 farhoud too, when the forces of law and order failed to come to the Jews’ rescue, the last line of defence was again the kindly neighbour. As Nessim Rejwan writes,\n\nThroughout the disturbances, with a few exceptions, Jewish homes in mixed neighbourhoods were defended and hundreds of Jews were saved by the willingness of their Muslim neighbours to protect them, in some cases at the cost of their own lives.\n\nThe broader picture\n\nFor the Jews, the 1930s and 1940s were a time of turmoil across the Arab world. Seven years before the farhoud, Jews had been killed in the pogrom of Constantine, Algeria. In Libya, 136 Jews, 36 of them children, were slaughtered in 1945. That same year, bloody riots erupted in Egypt and Aden, as in Syria in 1947.\n\nAll these events, targeting civilian communities, predated the creation of Israel. They demonstrated the vulnerability and insecurity to which Jews were exposed up to 50 years ago. Things might have turned out differently — Crown Prince Faisal, later the British-appointed King of Iraq, had signed a pact in 1919 with Chaim Weizmann viewing with sympathy the establishment of a Jewish home in Palestine. Instead, Arab ruling elites made Zionism a crime from 1948 onwards, passed discriminatory legislation and whipped up popular feeling against the Jews to distract attention from their illegitimacy, their internal problems and obligations.\n\n[…]\n\nThe situation today\n\nAt the beginning of the twenty-first century, the concept of Ottoman pluralism (whatever its limitations) could not be more remote. The Arab world is almost monolithically Muslim and judenrein. Pan-Arab nationalism is a spent force but pan-Islamism is asserting its grip. Those Copts, Assyrians and other groups who have not fled continue to be persecuted and marginalized.\n\nThe mass media of the Muslim world pump out a new antisemitism, inspired by Saudi Wahabism, fed by Koranic accounts of Jewish treachery and drawing on every antisemitic motif and conspiracy theory in the book. This antisemitism is a product of the Israel-Arab dispute, but a fight between two nationalisms over the same piece of land has changed, with the rise of Islamic fundamentalism, into an intractable religious conflict. Israel is an affront to the umma: what was once Muslim territory can never become non-Muslim. Palestine must be reconquered by jihad and the Jews revert to their natural status of dhimmitude. Until this alarming religious dimension is addressed and the forces of Islamic militancy subdued, the conflict will be insoluble.\n\nhttp://www.isranet.org/Israzine/Israzine_V2N21_Dilemma.htm\n\n…One thousand years before the advent of Islam, Jews in substantial numbers resided in what are today Arab countries. For centuries under Islamic rule, following the Moslem conquest of the region, Jews were considered ‘dhimmi’, or second-class citizens. But they were nonetheless permitted limited religious, educational, professional, and business opportunities.\n\nIt is within the last 55 years that the world witnessed the mass displacement of over 850,000 long-time Jewish residents from the totalitarian regimes, the brutal dictatorships and monarchies of Syria, Trans-Jordan, Egypt, Lebanon, Yemen, Iran, Iraq, Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco.\n\nThe rise of pan-Arabism and independence movements in the 20th century resulted in an orchestrated, multi-state campaign against Zionism. These states vehemently opposed the establishment of a homeland for the Jewish people. Hundreds of thousands of Jews resident in Arab countries were ensnared in this struggle.\n\nhttp://www.justiceforjews.com/narr_2.html\n\nIn August 1929, leaflets prepared by the mufti instructed Muslims to attack the Jews\n\nhttp://books.google.com/books?id=Dunx_i1P6fMC&pg=PA42\n\nThe Jewish refugees who came to live in Palestine had to overcome Turkish, British, and Pan-Arab imperialism in order to achieve self-determination. …\n\nWe’ve Come A Long Way… Let’s look back.

Why did Arab rioters kill 510 Jewish men, women and children in 1936-39? Was it Arab rage over Israeli aggression in ’67? … How do you let hypocritical racist regimes accuse us of racism? …\n\nhttp://www.jewish-holiday.com/frontShav62.html\n\nThe Sephardim of Sydney: coping with political processes and social pressures‎ – Page 34\n\nby Naomi Gale – Social Science – 2005 – 188 pages\n\nJews were arrested and sentenced to death for allegedly spying for Israel … were arrested in the wake of the Six- Day War and sent to concentration camps.\n\nhttp://books.google.com/books?id=5H7pfJLQE2sC&pg=PA34\n\nFrom Time Immemorial: The Origins of the Arab-Jewish Conflict Over Palestine‎ – Page 50\n\nby Joan Peters – History – 1985 – 601 pages\n\n…Anti-Jewisg publications deluged Egypt, including the infamous “Protocols” — many of them circulated by the Egyptian government — When the Six-Day War began, Jews were arrested and held in concentration camps, where they were beaten and whipped, denied of water for days on end…\n\nhttp://books.google.com/books?id=5EkgDJsaGhMC&q=arab+immigration+native+jews\n\nSix Day War Comprehensive Timeline\n\nSept 1st 1967\n\nArab summit conference in Khartoum during August 29 ­ September 1, 1967, formulated the Khartoum Resolutions.

Such a stance reinstates the imperialism of the Islamic jihad, which has claimed millions of victims over three continents during more than a millennium, deported an incalculable number of slaves, and annihilated entire peoples, destroying their history, their monuments, and their culture. Have the Copts of Egypt a right to their history and their language? Do the Kabili of North Africa have a right to theirs? We must acknowledge all the victims of the racism that jihad creates, a racism which denies the history, sufferings, and memories of those conquered.\n\nArab racism consists of calling the Land of Israel, Arab land, whereas no Palestinian province, village, or town, including Jerusalem is mentioned either in the Koran or in any Arabic text before the end of the ninth century. On the contrary, these locations are mentioned in the Hebrew Bible, which represents the religious and historical heritage of the Jewish people. The Bible, which tells the history of this country, tells it in Hebrew, the language of the country, and not in Arabic. Palestinian racism consists of asserting that the whole history of Israel, biblical history, is Arab, Islamic, and Palestinian history.\n\nhttp://www.nationalreview.com/comment/comment-yeor080202.asp\n\nARAB RACISM\n\nJerusalem Post – Jul 12, 1992\n\nAuthor: Herbert Zweibon\n\nDate: Jul 12, 1992\n\n[Start Page: 06]\n\nThe right of Jews to live in the Land of Israel cannot be made subject to an Arab veto.

It must be noted that such talk was heard even before any Arab citizens of Israel were killed. This renewed hope, which many of us thought had died long ago, is apparently based in part on the following:\n\n+ The unilateral withdrawal from Lebanon, which seemed like evidence of Israeli weakness (this also accounts for the open support of Hezbollah)\n\n+ The concessions that Prime Minister Ehud Barak was willing to make to Palestinian Authority chairman Yasser Arafat at Camp David and afterward on the issue of Jerusalem as well, which appeared in a false light as Israel’s giving in\n\n+ The disagreement and anti-Zionist mood within Israel’s divided society\n\nThe truth is that Palestinian leaders and the extremists among the Israeli Arab community – the majority rejects, in its passive way, violence and Muslim-Arab racism – are making a great mistake, a mistake that could lead to tragic results for all peoples in the Middle East. The mistake is double: It misinterprets both the nature of Israeli democracy and the willingness to make painful compromises.\n\nIt is the nature of democracy to appear weak from without, while being strong from within. Until quite recently the United States seemed to be at a serious low point, and many people predicted the end of the American era: The United States was humiliated in Vietnam, painfully bearing the internal schism that the war created; it submissively accepted the brazen Soviet invasion of Afghanistan; it accepted the capture of hostages and the siege of its embassy in Tehran, and many people believed that it was beginning to slide down a slippery slope, with the Soviet Union standing above it. Suddenly, with no preparation of public opinion, the giant collapsed and the apparent weakling became the sole superpower.\n\nMany have erred in assessing the strength of democratic rule. Experience teaches that democracy is strong in several ways: First of all, a modern economy can flourish only under a regime of freedom and liberty.\n\nTyranny is the enemy of growth. The Arab world is backward not because it is not talented – Western universities and industry are filled with Arab experts – but because its regimes are tyrannical, corrupt and backward. Israel is in a comfortable position on The Economist’s list of emerging economies, and in 23rd place on the UN’s development rating. No Arab nation comes anywhere close. Israel’s domestic product is greater than that of all of its Arab neighbors.\n\nSecond, by nature democratic society is compromising because it must consider all of its components. But when faced with a dead-end, no-choice situation, it gathers together all of its forces in order to win the war. Dictatorial society conceals a deep and wide bitterness, which hurts its ability to achieve total enlistment. The withdrawal from Lebanon and the far-reaching compromises that the prime minister is willing to make are the sign not of weakness that heralds the end, but rather of informed strength, that is prepared for coexistence based on mutual respect.\n\nIsrael today is stronger economically and military than it has ever been. This strength stems above all from its democratic rule and freedom of expression. If it wants, the Palestinian leadership can achieve peace with us and learn from our democratic experience. But this leadership will be making a great error if it cannot comprehend both our strength, and the secret of that strength\n\nhttp://www.imra.org.il/story.php3?id=4805\n\nHey Kristof… You’re Late!\n\nBy Gerald A. Honigman\n\nMonday, March 23, 2009\n\nWhile The New York Times’ Nicholas Kristof is no stranger to these positions throughout the year, he frequently comes out with his gems of Middle East wisdom right around Bike Week here in Daytona Beach, Florida, when tens of thousands of Harley enthusiasts arrive to also spread their hot air exhaust around town. This year Nick was a few weeks late.\n\nLike others of his ilk–Thomas Friedman (better of late), David Ignatius, Richard Cohen, just to name a few, who are also obsessed with creating a 22nd Arab state (second, not first, Arab one within the original April 25, 1920 borders of the Mandate of Palestine before the Brits gave some 80% away to Arab nationalism creating Transjordan in 1922)–Kristof loves to lecture Israel, practically invisible on a map of the world, about the need to bare the necks of its kids so that Arabs, who conquered over six million square miles of territory from mostly non-Arab peoples in the name of their nation, can have that additional state as well.\n\n[…]\n\nI have never met Cole, but I had–unfortunately–studied under a number of his academic clones in my own graduate school days.\n\nWhile also–but a bit more subtly than President Obama’s dear friend, Rashid Khalidi, Juan Cole, et al–promoting the themes of nasty Zionists and the need to create Arab state # 22, Carter Findley never mentioned the plight of some thirty-five million Kurds who remain stateless to date. They had been gassed and slaughtered by Arabs repeatedly and had their one best chance at statehood aborted by a collusion of British petroleum politics and Arab nationalism after World War I. Indeed, the only time Findley ever mentioned Kurds in his doctoral seminar was when he mocked their plight in Turkey.\n\nIn Juan Cole’s Informed Comment blog of February 11, 2009, he proclaimed Israel’s new incoming government as being prone to racism, apartheid, and so forth. Nothing new…his positions from the get-go. That has been how one gets ahead in Middle Eastern Studies for quite some time now. Israel is routinely placed under the high power lens of moral scrutiny, while a blind eye is turned to literally millions of victims of Arab massacres, gassings, genocide, enslavement, dhimmitude, subjugation, and so forth. And woe unto the student who dares to question such duplicity. Been there, done that…unfortunately.\n\nTurn the clock back several decades again as we return to Findley’s doctoral seminars.\n\nI’ll never forget one Greek Orthodox woman who I’m sure has a great position at some university today…can’t think of her name, but remember her well. Unlike myself, she wasn’t denied a Ph. D. dissertation advisor to finish her doctoral work. Geez…I wonder why?\n\nHer idol was Hajj Amin al-Husseini, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, who spent World War II in Berlin at Hitler’s side and organized a division of Muslim Nazis, ‘the Hanzar.’ He also played a first-hand role in instigating the genocide of Europe’s Jews, Serbs and Gypsies.\n\nWhen she presented her research on the Mufti at our seminar, all the above was either white-washed or ignored altogether. Findley, of course–her mentor and featured guest at her wedding–sat through it all approvingly.\n\nNow, contrast this with my own research about Ze’ev Vladimir Jabotinsky…the man most responsible in the early Mandate era for Jewish defense against Arab slaughter. Findley had no problem emphasizing his alleged “fascist connections” and so forth.\n\nUnlike too many of his pipe-dreaming Zionist opponents on the Left, Jabotinsky was not delusional about what the Arabs’ true intentions were regarding the resurrection of the Jew of the Nations–regardless of its size. A reading of his Appetite Versus Starvation speech in the early 20th century reveals a man truly concerned about justice for Arab and Jew alike. If the so-called Arab World had produced such “fascists,” the Arab-Israeli conflict would have been resolved long ago. But none of this makes a difference to the Juan Coles…Kristof’s sources of enlightenment.\n\nJabotinsky’s heirs are now set to take office in Israel. I hope they do justice to his memory.\n\nSo, the Rashid Khalidis, Juan Coles, Nicholas Kristofs, and so forth now bemoan the end of the so-called peace (of the grave) process because at least most Israeli Jews have finally woken up to the reality that the end game for both the West’s alleged Fatah good cops of Abbas and the bad cops of Hamas is the same regarding Israel. The façade of a difference is largely about who will gain access to the billions of dollars in foreign aid that is and will be pouring in. Arafat’s stashed $$$ millions or more are legendary. Hamas is simply more honest.\n\nDaniel Pipes has long approached the Middle East with a far more realistic and objective appraisal of the facts at hand. He has been virtually prophetic regarding such things as 9/11, militant Islam, and so forth.\n\nOn the other hand, the Juan Coles of the Ivory Tower have blamed solely Israel and America as the culprits.\n\nThe fact that the vast majority of conflicts today, for example, involves militant Islam and/or real Arab racism is of no concern to them.\n\nWhat does the fight in the Philippines have to do with Israel?…Thailand?… Kashmir?…the Balkans?\n\nWhat do the murder and subjugation of Egyptian Copts, North African Berbers, Assyrians, those Kurds mentioned above, or Arab genocide in black Africa’s Sudan have to do with Israel?\n\nThe truth is that Israel–one half of whose Jews who are from refugee families from the “Arab World” where they were know"
