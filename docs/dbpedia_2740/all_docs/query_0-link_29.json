Colin Meade, Telos Press, 2007, 180 pp.\n\nReviewed by Amnon Lord [2008]\n\n\"We were the first to think of translating Mein Kampf,\" wrote Sami al-Jundi, a leader of the Syrian Ba'ath Party in the 1930s. \"Whoever lived during this period in Damascus would appreciate the inclination of the Arab people to Nazism, for Nazism was the power which could serve as its champion\" (26). Al-Jundi also confessed that \"we were racist, admiring Nazism, reading its books and the sources of its thought, particularly Nietzsche, Fichte, and H. S. Chamberlain\" (25).\n\nHow many people know that Arab delegations and senior political figures were invited to the annual Nazi rallies in Nuremberg during the 1930s? Such details are not simply random anecdotes from the remote past. Indeed, in his new book Jihad and Jew-Hatred, German scholar Matthias Küntzel argues that the origins of the Islamist terror of recent years, which culminated in the attacks on the United States on 11 September 2001, and of the radical anti-Semitic ideologies of Hamas, Hizballah, Iran, the Palestine Covenant, and al-Qaeda, lie in the lethal link between Islamism and Nazism.\n\nhttp://www.jcpa.org/JCPA/Templates/ShowPage.asp?DRIT=3&DBID=1&LNGID=1&TMID=111&FID=253&PID=0&IID=2330&TTL=Amnon_Lord_on_Jihad_and_Jew-Hatred:__Islamism,_Nazism,_and_the_Roots_of_9/11,_by_Matthias_K%C3%BCntzel\n\nThe Nazi-Islamist Connection – Herbert Eiteneier, JCPA\n\nPalestinian maps, including in textbooks, do not show Israel at all; Palestinian sources omit the Mufti's role in Nazism and deny the Holocaust, …\n\nhttp://www.jcpa.org/phas/phas-eiteneier-s06.htm\n\nDer Spiegel, 05/23/2007\n\nWorld War II\n\nNew Research Taints Image of Desert Fox Rommel\n\nBy Jan Friedmann\n\nArabs Shouted \"Heil Rommel\"\n\nHitler was celebrated in large parts of the Arab world, and some newspapers even likened him to the Prophet. The Desert Fox was almost as popular as Hitler. \"Heil Rommel\" was a common greeting in Arab countries.\n\nMany Arabs thought the Germans would free them from the rule of the old colonial powers France and Britain. Hitler had shown how to burst the shackles of the Treaty of Versailles. After Germany defeated France in 1940, chants against the French and British echoed around the streets of Damascus: \"No more Monsieur, no more Mister, Allah's in Heaven and Hitler's on earth.\"\n\nAdolf Hitler assured the exiled Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Muhammad Amin al-Husseini, at a meeting in Berlin in November 1941 that his goal was the \"destruction of Jewry living in Arabia.\" The Führer had racist objections to Arabs as well, though. He declined to shake the Mufti's hand and refused to drink coffee with him.\n\nHitler nevertheless provided the Mufti, who later sponsored Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, with a budget of 750,000 Reichsmark per month to foment Jihad in Palestine. In an example of ideological flexibility, the SS even recruited Muslim volunteers and declared that the Muslims living in the Balkans belonged to the \"racially valuable\" peoples of Europe.\n\nhttp://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,484510,00.html\n\nIndigenous Indians: Agastya to Ambedkar, by Koenraad Elst, [Voice of India] 1993, 483 pages, Page 353 [8185990042, 9788185990040]\n\nYoung Fidel Castro would imitate Mussolini in front of the mirror. The secularist Baath Party in Syria and Iraq was modelled on Mussolini's Fascist Party. The Iranian Shah Reza Pahlevi was an open admirer of Hitler (for which he was forced by the British to abdicate in favour of his son).\n\nnbsp;The Muslims in particular were enthusiastic. ...Muslim nations rallied to ally with Hitler: the Bosnian Muslims, the Kalmuks, the Chechen and Ingosh, the Balkans, the Meshkets, and the Krim Tatars. In West Asia, prominant leaders like the Druze leader Shakib Arslan (Walid Jumblatt's father) and the Mufti of Jerusalem allied themselves with Hitler.\n\nhttp://books.google.com/books?id=exVuAAAAMAAJ&q=Muslims\n\nThe war aims and strategies of Adolf Hitler - Page 161 - Oscar Pinkus - 2005 - 537 pages\n\nThe sympathies for Hitler extended all the way from the Islamic Bosnians and Albanians in Europe to the Arab countries in Africa and...\n\nhttp://books.google.com/books?id=gPnjXC1lEJ8C&pg=PA161\n\nJihad and Jew-hatred: Islamism, Nazism and the roots of 9/11 - Pages 10-11 - Matthias Küntzel - 2007 - 180 pages\n\nMale supremacy, sexual repression, the celebration of jihad and the glorification of a martyr's death in war with unbelievers (al-Banna celebrated \"the art of death\") and hatred of the Jews all created points of commonality with fascism and Nazism...\n\nhttp://books.google.com/books?id=q9Y8E-AYVeoC&pg=PR10\n\nAmong the many various Arab pro-Nazi, fascist groups\n\nThe Arab war effort: a documented account By American Christian Palestine Committee, 1946, p. 7\n\nIN SYRIA AND THE LEBANON connections between certain groups of Syrian leaders and the Axis States were of long standing.... the Iron Shirts (led by Fakhri al-Barudi of the National Bloc, still a member of the Syrian parliament in 1946); the League for National Action (headed by Abdu al-Huda al-Yab, Dr. Zaki al-Jabi and others); the An-Nadi al-Arabi Club of Damascus (headed by Dr. Said Abd Al-Fattah al-Imam); the Councils for the Defense of Arab Palestine (head by well known pro-Nazi leaders, such as Nabi al-Azmah, Adil Arslan and others); the Syrian People's Party...\n\nhttp://books.google.com/books?&id=fxzPAAAAMAAJ&dq=well+known+pro-Nazi\n\npage 33\n\nWith the stimulus that the ex-Mufti exerted and with the German armies sweeping victoriously over the Continent of Europe, the Muthana Club, Moslem Guidance Society, the Palestine Defense Society, the Tajaddad Club, and the Arab Rover Society, to quote the names of but a few bodies and societies, intensified their pro-Nazi subversive activities in the hopes that by so doing they would eventually, through enemy assistance, realize their Pan-Arab aspirations.\n\nhttp://books.google.com/books?id=KGMZAAAAIAAJ&dq=defense+of+palestine\n\nDie Welt des Islams, 1985, [Wild, Stefan. \"National Socialism in the Arab near East between 1933 and 1939.\"] p. 127\n\nIn the following section I shall describe five parties and movements in the Arab word which to a greater or lesser degree had taken over certain elements of National Socialism or Fascism, namely the Baath (Ba'th)- Party, the Syrian Socialist Nationalist Party, the Kataeb (katd'ib), Young Egypt (Misr al-Fatdh) and the Futuwwa.

That year an Arab High Committee was formed in the month of April and was presidedover by the mufti, Hadz Amin el Husseini. It included the most reactionary elements of the Arab world and enleashed a revolt which transformed Palestine into a stronghold occupied by more than twenty thousand British soldiers. These Arab elements had been inspired by Fascists and Nazis, a fact since established by the publication of the secret Wilhemstrasse Archives. The Arab High Committee had receieved the financial support of the Nazis and Fascists who financed the revolt, with the Mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin el Husseini, acting as intermediary. Hitler and his police achieved in Palestine what they had attempted throughout the Arab world (against the Jews)\n\nhttp://books.google.com/books?id=l6FoAeIPcuEC&pg=PA108\n\nConfronting fascism in Egypt: dictatorship versus democracy in the 1930s - Page 273 - I.

These tendencies are seen as having manifested themselves particularly in the mushrooming of new radical youth organizations such as the League of National Action, the Lion Cubs of Arabism, the Syrian Social Nationalist Party led ny Antun Sa'ada, the Arab Club, the Steel Shirts, the early Ba'ath movement, and various radical Islamic organizations.

If Mussolini supported Zionists to some extent as a lever against the British Empire, both he and Hitler subsidized Haj Amin el Husseini, the violently anti-Jewish grand mufti of Jerusalem. Anti-Jewish feeling mounted in parts of the Middle East during the 1930s, as the Fascist and Nazi regimes and doctrines made increasing sense to many Arab nationalists. King Abdul Aziz of Saudi Arabia sought German arms and contacts and was favorably received. Various delegations of Syrians and Iraqis attended the Niirnberg party congresses, and there were several different Arabic translations of Mein Kampf. Both the German and Italian regimes were active in propaganda in the Arab world, and there was much pro-German sentiment in Egypt. At least seven different Arab nationalist groups had developed shirt movements by 1939 (white, gray, and iron in Syria; blue and green in Egypt; ... Syrian... Iraqi Futuwa...

Nicosia, Transaction Publishers, 2000, pages 90-91\n\n[page 90]\n\nAfter 1933, there were attempts in the Arab world to establish political parties based on Fascist or Nationa Socialist principles and organization. Both [German representatives: Fritz] Grobba and [Heinrich] Wolf were approached in 1933 by individuals with plans to create National Socialist parties in Iraq and Palestine, respectively. The Palestine correspondent of the news-paper Al-Ahram, Joseph Francis, represented a group of Palestinian Arabs who were interested in establishing such a party. Francis wrote to Wolf in April, 1933, requesting the help of the Consulate-General in thsi endeavor. In Baghdad, a similar overture was made to Fritz Grobba by Abdul Ghaffur el-Bedri, publisher of the newspaper Istiqlal, and a group of his supporters, Wolf's strong opposition to any sort of German encouragement or support for an Arab Nazi party in Palestine was conveyed in a note to the Foreign Office in Berlin in June, 1933,... In Berlin, the Foreign Office concurred with Wolf's opposition to Arab efforts to involve Germany in the creation of an Arab National party in Palestine... provided the rationale behind the instructions issued to Wolf on the matter...\n\nThe objections that Herr Wolf has raised against the promotion of an Arab National Socialist movement by official German representatives are fully supported here.

Rosen, page 106\n\n...The shrill calls to take up extremist politics invoked a symbolism that glorified youth, violence, and death. By 1936 Al Difaa, the paper of the Istiqlal movement and the most widely read paper in the Arab community, proclaimed, in clearly fascist tones, that \"youth must go out to the field of battle as soldiers of the Fatherland.\" Others argued that the \"Land is in need of a youth, healthy in body and soul like Nazi youth in Germany and the fascist youth in Italy which stands ready for the orders of its leaders and ready to sacrifice its life for the honor of its people and freedom of its fatherland.\"\n\n…Nationalist rhetoric accompanied major efforts to build fascist-style youth organizations by recruiting young men to serve as the strike force of the nationalist movement. Throughout the 1930s the children of wealthy Palestinians returned home from European universities having witnessed the emergence of fascist paramilitary forces. Palestinian students educated in Germany returned to Palestine determined to found the Arab Nazi Party. The Husseinis used the Palestinian Arab Party to establish the al-Futuwwa youth corps, which was named after an association of Arab Nazi Scouts. By 1936 the Palestinian Arab Party was sponsoring the developments of storm troops patterned on the German model. These storm troops, all children and youth, were to be outfitted in black trousers and red shirts… The young recruits took the following oath: \"Life — my right; independence — my aspiration; Arabism — my country, and there is no room in it for any but Arabs. In this I believe and Allah is my witness.\"\n\n[...]\n\nThe al-Futuwwa youth groups connected Palestinian youth to fascist youth movements elsewhere in the Middle East. While the Mufti was establishing youth groups in Palestine, al-Futuwwa groups were established in Iraq.\n\nhttp://books.google.com/books?id=zQYQ0tho6mAC&pg=PA106\n\nThe birth of the Palestinian refugee problem revisited, Benny Morris, Cambridge University Press, 2004, p. 28\n\nMore important in 'militarization' of Arab Palestine was the establishment by the Hussenis of the Futuwa (youth companies), in which youngsters were trained in military drill and the use of weapons.

Written with vigor and extraordinary access to primary sources in several languages, Icon of Evil is the definitive account of the man who, during World War II, was called \"the fuhrer of the Arab world\" and whose ugly legacy lives on today. With new and disturbing details, David G. Dalin and John F. Rothmann show how al -Husseini ingratiated himself with his hero, Adolf Hitler, becoming, with his blond hair and blue eyes, an \"honorary Aryan\" while dreaming of being installed as Nazi leader of the Middle East. Al-Husseini would later recruit more than 100,000 Muslims in Europe to fight in divisions of the Waffen-SS, and obstruct negotiations with the Allies that might have allowed four thousand Jewish children to escape to Palestine. Some believe that al-Husseini even inspired Hitler to implement the Final Solution. At wars end, al-Husseini escaped indictment at Nuremberg and was harbored in France. Icon of Evil chronicles al-Husseinis postwar relationships with such influential Islamic figures as the radical theoretician Sayyid Qutb and Saddam Husseins powerful uncle General Khairallah Talfah and his crucial mentoring of the young Yasser Ararat. Finally, it provides compelling evidence that al-Husseinis actions and writings serve as inspirations today to the leaders of Hamas, Hezbollah, and other terrorist organizations pledged to destroy Israel and the United States.\n\nhttp://books.google.com/books?id=QMts5Z36kjAC\n\np. 131\n\nDuring the 1920 and 1930s. Haj Amin al-Husseini was one of the first radical Islamic leaders to issue fatwas, or religious rulings, calling for jihad, or holy war, against Great Britain, the United States, the Jews, and the West. Since Workd War I, during which al-Husseini served as an officer in the Ottoman Turkish army, the fatwa was served as a major instrument by which Islamic religious leaders have impelled their followers to engage in acts of jihad, which invariably involved acts of violence and terrorism.\n\nhttp://books.google.com/books?id=QMts5Z36kjAC&pg=PA131\n\n\"The Mufti of Berlin\n\nArab-Nazi collaboration is a taboo topic in the West\", Daniel Schwammenthal, Wall Street Jounal, September 24, 2009\n\n...the Palestinian wartime leader \"was one of the worst and fanatical fascists and anti-Semites,\" .... He intervened with the Nazis to prevent the escape to Palestine of thousands of European Jews, who were sent instead to the death camps. He also conspired with the Nazis to bring the Holocaust to Palestine. The mufti \"invented a new form of Jew-hatred by recasting it in an Islamic mold,\" according to German scholar Matthias Küntzel. The mufti's fusion of European anti-Semtism—particularly the genocidal variety—with Koranic views of Jewish wickedness has become the hallmark of Islamists world-wide, from al Qaeda to Hamas and Hezbollah. During his time in Berlin, the mufti ran the Nazis' Arab-language propaganda radio program, which incited Muslims in the Mideast to \"kill the Jews wherever you find them. This pleases God, history and religion.\" Among the many listeners was also the man later known as Ayatollah Khomeini, who used to tune in to Radio Berlin every evening, according to Amir Taheri's biography of the Iranian leader. Khomeini's disciple Mahmoud Ahmadinejad still spews the same venom pioneered by the mufti as do Islamic hate preachers around the world.\n\nMuslim Judeophobia is not—as is commonly claimed—a reaction to the Mideast conflict but one of its main \"root causes.\" It has been fueling Arab rejection of a Jewish state long before Israel's creation.\n\nhttp://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203440104574400532495168894.html\n\nGlobal Issues: Selections From CQ Researcher - Page 158 - CQ Researcher - [Pine Forge Press] 2009 [ISBN 1412980372, 9781412980371] - 368 pages\n\nThe Mufti fled Palestine in 1938 to avoid arrest by the British for his part in the Arab revolt. He spent most of the war in Berlin, recruiting Bosnian Muslims for the SS, the semi-military Nazi organization that oversaw Hitler's extermination of the Jews.

Al-Husseini was a bridge figure in terms of transporting the Nazi genocide in Europe into the post-war Middle East.\n\nAs the leader of Arab Palestine during the British Mandate period, al-Husseini introduced violence against moderate Arabs as well as against Jews. Al-Husseini met with Adolf Eichmann in Palestine in 1937 and subsequently went on the Nazi payroll as a Nazi agent.\n\nAl-Husseini played a pivotal behind-the-scenes role in instigating a pro-Nazi coup in Iraq in 1941, in urging Nazi's and pro-Nazi governments in Europe to transport Jews to death camps, in training pro-Nazi Bosnian brigades, and in funneling Nazi loot into post-war Arab countries.\n\nhttp://books.google.com/books?id=HGkthBwbNg8C\n\n---\n\nIn August 1929, leaflets prepared by the mufti Haj Amin al-Husseini instructed Muslims to attack the Jews\n\nhttp://books.google.com/books?id=Dunx_i1P6fMC&pg=PA42\n\nAl-Husseini also helped incite the series of pogroms which lasted from 1936 to 1939, in which hundreds more Jews were killed\n\nhttp://tech.mit.edu/V123/N12/kraus12.12c.html\n\n---\n\nThe Mufti of Jerusalem: Al-Hajj Amin al-Husayni and the Palestinian National Movement, Philip Mattar, Columbia University Press, 1992, p. 95\n\nThey were to go to Iraq, disguise themselves as Arabs, kidnap or kill the Mufti, and destroy oil installations. ...

From [[Berlin]] and other fascist capitals in Europe, the mufti continued to agitate for the destruction of international Jewry, as well as a pan-Arab and pan-Islamic alliance with the Nazi regime, he explained to the German ambassador, Ettel, his plan to bring all Arabs under the banner of Pan-Arabism over to the side of the Axis.

Upon his arrival, he immediately launched into political intrigue by organizing and effectively gaining control of the secretive pan-Arab and pro-Nazi Iraqi Arab National Party.

They have proclaimed the Jihad, Holy war, against Israel, the war which according to the Koran must end with the enemy's total annihilation. In this endeavor the Arabs are making use of the methods applied by the Germans during the Holocaust as well as by directions resulting from their employment of former SS officials.\n\n[...]\n\nAs we have stated before in this chapter, history must be viewed as a continuum. Such an unfortunate continuum regarding the Holocaust exist in the continuing Nazi-Arab connection. The influence of these two groups upon each other is mutual. Too little attention is being paid to the way in which Arabs contributed to the effectiveness of the Final Solution program. Haj Amin el Husseini, head of the Supreme Muslim Council and Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, a venomous Jew-hater, had prior to the war organized Arab terrorism against the Jews in Palestine. From 1941 on, he spent much of his time shuttling between Berlin and Rome. He met in Berlin with Ernst von Weizsaecker, State Secretary in the German Foreign Office, with Himmler, and on November 28, 1941 with Hitler. In his meeting, the Mufti tried to strengthen the Fuehrer's decision to \" exterminate\" all Jews, and both agreed that the Germans would fight the Jews mercilessly, in all of Europe \"and beyond.\"[...]\n\nThe Mufti had also met with Eichmann and visited Auschwitz. In Rome, he was received by the Italian Foreign Minister, Count Ciano, and by Mussolini himself. In his meetings with the German officials, the Mufti stressed the need to wipe out as many Jews as possible and to finally revoke the designation of Palestine as a Jewish National Home. He proposed that after the German victory,an Arab state --under his leadership-- be created that would consist of Syria, Iraq, Transjordan and the Wesrern, Jewish part of Palestine. In return the Mufti promised Arab revolts against the British who were then predominant in these areas. One such serious revolt aganst the British occured in April 1941.\n\nhttp://books.google.com/books?id=SlSDYmjJNU0C&pg=PA235\n\nLIFE - Oct 27, 1952 - Page 145 - Vol. 33, No. 17 - 156 pages - Magazine - Full view\n\nMYSTERY MAN OF ISLAM SPEAKS In exclusive talk, mufti defends tie to Hitler and record on Jews by JAMES BELL The name of Haj Amin el Husseini, usually called the Mufti of Jerusalem, has been associated with assassination, riot, ...\n\nDuring the Palestine war the Muft's holy fighters terrorized Jews, blew up houses and killed many people...\n\nhttp://books.google.com/books?id=2lIEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA145\n\nRashid Ali al-Gailani\n\n[Rashid Ali el Kailani]\n\n[Rashid 'Ali al-Keilani]\n\n[Sayyad Rashid el Keilani]\n\nHighlights:\n\n* Led pro-Nazi, fascist coup in Baghdad, 1941.\n\n* Met with Hitler in 1942.\n\n* Close ties with the Mufti.\n\nNazi propaganda for the Arab world - Page 60 - Jeffrey Herf - [Yale University Press] 2009\n\n[ISBN 0300145799, 9780300145793] - 335 pages - Preview\n\n... 1941, Rashid Ali Kilani led a pro-Axis coup that overthrew the Iraqi government of General Taha el-Hashimi.

The Coup - On April 1, 1941 the \"Golden Square\" and the chief of staff of the Iraqi army staged the coup, and appointed Rashid 'Ali al-Keilani head of the government. Nuri as Said was forced to flee Iraq along with the regent and young king Faysal II. On April 3, a letter from the German Secretary of State Von Weizacker answered Haddad's letter favorably, but the letter arrived after the coup.\n\nRashid 'Ali stated on April 10 that he would honor the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930, apparently fearing British reprisals .On April 16, Rashid responded to a request for landing of British troops at Basra cautiously. He replied that they could land, but must embark immediately for Palestine or Egypt. The British began landing troops on April 16 or 18 at Basra, at first in compliance with Rashid Ali's conditions, and later in violation of the conditions, since the troops did not leave. The British played for time and made pretences of accepting the new situation. However, reinforcements from India kept arriving at Basra.\n\nThe Iraqi government was also trying to buy time, and entered into a pretence of Turkish mediation of the crisis. However, the Iraqi representative in Turkey, told the German Ambassador von Papen, that there would be no compromise with the British. Raschid Ali had already asked the Italians for military aid at the end of March, and likewise, Hitler decided on April 10 to send military aid to the Iraqis. However, the shipments took several weeks. The German foreign office got a report from General Keitel of a large shipment, including, for example, some 15,000 rifles and about 800 machine guns. Arms were shipped from Saloniki and through Turkey and Syria. The shipments from Syria were sent as a consequence of the agreement between the Vichy leader Darlan and Hitler as to general collaboration between Vichy and Germany. In the same agreement Vichy also agreed to allow German aircraft to base and stage through Syria on their way to Iraq, though there would be some pretence involved, so that the Vichy government could plausibly deny to Britain that it was assisting the German war effort. The French also rationed German fuel supplies, and as the Luftwaffe was unable to obtain fuel from Persia or elsewhere, this hampered their effectiveness.\n\nA second group of British troops landed at Basra on April 28, and the Iraqis protested. On the evening of April 29, about 9,000 troops of the Iraqi army surrounded the RAF air base at Habaniyeh and the next day the Iraqis ordered that no flights were to take off. However, the Iraqis had insufficient force. The move was instigated by the \"Golden Square\" officers. Rashid Ali himself apparently wanted to avoid antagonizing the British and wait for supplies from the Germans.\n\nThe British strike back - The British struck to lift the siege of Habanniyeh, remove Rashid Ali from power and restore the pro-British government. Though they were initially unable to move from Basra overland, because of the weather and because Iraqis had cut lines of communication, the British were able to use the RAF at Habbaniyeh and Shaiba effectively, and began attacking on May 2. They had about 90 aircraft, mostly antiquated, but these included a number of Wellington bombers[8]. . The RAF struck the Iraqis surrounding Habbaniyeh The Iraqis used their air force [9], very sparingly and not very effectively. At the same time, relatively small numbers of British reinforcements were ferried by air from Basra. Iraqi anti-aircraft fire and artillery proved ineffective. By May 6 the Iraqi force was defeated and the siege of Habbaniyeh was abandoned, though the roads were still blocked. The RAF also destroyed most of the Iraqi air force on the ground by about May 8.\n\nGerman Aid - During this time, several German officers and diplomats were seconded to Iraq to oversee Luftwaffe operations and the arms supply. Dr Fritz Grobba, the former consul, now returned to oversee the arms shipments and a Major Hansen was sent to oversee the transfer of aircraft. Grobba allegedly distributed sums of money to both Rashid Ali and the Mufti. Raschid Ali got about 90,000 pounds, and the Mufti reportedly got about $10,000.\n\nhttp://www.mideastweb.org/iraqaxiscoup.htm\n\nReference Guide to the Nazis and Arabs During the Holocaust: A Concise Guide to the Relationship and Conspiracy of the Nazis and the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem in North Africa and the Middle East During the Era of the Holocaust - Pages 32-3 - Shelomo Alfassa - [Lulu.com] 2006 [ISBN 0976322633, 9780976322634] - 70 pages\n\nWorking with an old ally, Rashid Ali al-Gaylani, who became prime minister of Iraq in March 1940, the Mufti \"obtained promises of Axis support, and in April 1941 carried out an anti-British and pro-Nazi coup\" in Baghdad.\n\nhttp://books.google.com/books?id=T2g2XA53UOEC&pg=PA32\n\n[p. 33]\n\nFrom Syria they extended their activities to Iraq, where they helped to establish a pro-Nazi regime headed by Rashid Ali al-Gailani.

According to sources on both sides of the Atlantic, it was Philby who advised Ibn Saud energetically to court Nazi Germany in the months before the war. The relationship was mutually beneficial. As one US intelligence study found, the Nazis \"recognized that King Ibn Saud's help was essential for renewing the fight against the British and the Jews in Palestine.\" The Germans proposed that a new government should be formed in Palestine, under the control of Jack's old friend, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem. Further, \"Jews who had settled in Palestine after the First World War would not be allowed to remain.\"\n\nIn January 1939 Saudi Arabia established diplomatic relations with the Third Reich, and Ibn Saud confided to the Germans that at heart he \"hated the English. \" In the following months he concluded arms deals with Germany and signed a friendship and trade treaty with Japan. Philby was pleased, especially as Ibn Saud concealed his secret dealings with the Axis from both the British and Americans. The Nazis also were pleased with the progress they had made with the king. They sent their best Middle East agent, Fritz Grobba, to meet with Ibn Saud, and even promised to obtain for him the most prestigious position in the Moslem world, the caliphate. The Saudi-Third Reich connection flourished, with their main link being their mutual hatred for the Jews.\n\nThe Nazis even promised to supply Ibn Saud with weapons, ammunition, and an armaments factory, and, according to some accounts, gave him bribes during most of World War II.\n\nThe king had many reasons for his secret arms deals with Berlin. The primary purpose \"was to increase the flow of weapons which [Ibn Saud] had secretly been sending to the Arabs fighting in Palestine,\" in order to \"check the Zionist influx that had followed the Balfour Declaration.\" Although he later claimed to be genuinely horrified by the Nazis' Final Solution , Ibn Saud's attitude toward the Jews was extreme, even by Arab standards.

One example is Sami Shawkat who is famous for his 1933 speech \"Sina'at al-Mawt\" (manufacture of death) in which he rationalizes mass violence and war as the way to achieve Arab aspirations. Tragically, this speech was widely distributed in Arab schools and in Iraq in particular. It is interesting that Shawkat teaches that \"force is the soil which sprouts the seeds of truth\". Although not widely known, Shawkat was a main force in the organization of the Futuwwa Youth Organization - a movement modeled directly after the Nazi Hitler Youth Movement. The Futuwwa set the pace for future Arab chauvinist movements, such as the B'aath party of Iraq and today's followers of Bin Laden. It is interesting to note that Shawkat's ideas became somewhat too hot to handle, even for the pan-Arabists - Satia Al-Husri later disowned Sami Shawkat.\n\nIt is worth noting that Sami Shawkat's brother, Naji, who by 1941 was a member of the Arab committee in Iraq (which had absorbed the Futuwwa), gave Franz von Papen (a high ranking German official of Nazi Germany in 1941) a letter which actually congratulated Hitler for the brutality that he inflicted upon the Jews.\n\nhttp://www.iran-heritage.org/interestgroups/history-article2.htm\n\nEncyclopedia of the Holocaust: Volume 2 - Israel Gutman - 1990 - 1905 pages - Page 716\n\nIn 1938 the Al-Futuwwa youth organization sent a delegate to the Nuremberg Nazi party rally, and in turn hosted the Hitler Youth leader Baldur von Schirach in Baghdad.

It was a turning point in the history of the Jews in Iraq.\n\nIn Baghdad the results of this policy were much more severe. On the afternoon of June 1, 1941, when the Regent and his entourage returned to Baghdad and British troops surrounded the city, the Jews believed that the danger from the pro-Nazi regime had passed. They ventured out to celebrate the traditional Jewish harvest festival holiday of Shavuot. Riots broke out, targeting the Jews of Baghdad. These riots, known as the Farhud, lasted for two days, ending on June 2, 1941.\n\nIraqi soldiers and policemen who had supported Rashid Ali al-Gailani's coup d'etat in April and Futtuwa youths who were sympathetic to the Axis incited and led the riots. Unlike in previous incidents, rioters focused on killing. Many civilians in Baghdad and Bedouins from the city's outskirts joined the rioters, taking part in the violence and helping themselves to a share in the booty. During the two days of violence, rioters murdered between 150 and 180 Jews, injured 600 others, and raped an undetermined number of women. They also looted some 1,500 stores and homes. The community leaders estimated that about 2,500 families -- 15 percent of the Jewish community in Baghdad -- suffered directly from the pogrom. According to the official report of the commission investigating the incident, 128 Jews were killed, 210 were injured, and over 1,500 businesses and homes were damaged. Rioting ended at midday on Monday, June 2, 1941, when Iraqi troops entered Baghdad, killed some hundreds of the mob in the streets and reestablished order in Baghdad.\n\nhttp://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007277\n\nIraq [Jewish Virtual Library\n\nFascism and Antisemitism (1933–1941)\n\n[...]\n\nIraqi Jews did not know the kind of *antisemitism that prevailed in some Christian states of Europe. The first attempt to copy modern European antisemitic libels was made in 1924 by Sādiq Rasūl al-Qādirī, a former officer in the White Russian Army. He published his views, particularly that of worldwide conspiracy, in a Baghdadi newspaper. The Jewish response in its own weekly newspaper, al-Misbah, compelled al-Qādirī to apologize, although he later published his antisemitic memoirs.\n\nAt that time the press drew a clear dividing line between Judaism and Zionism. This line became blurred in the 1930s, along with the demand to remove Jews from the genealogical tree of the Semitic peoples. This anti-Jewish trend coincided with Faysal's death in 1933, which brought about a noticeable change for the Jewish community. His death also came at the same time as the Assyrian massacre, which created a climate of insecurity among the minorities. Iraqi Jewry at that time had been subject to threats and invectives emanating not only from extremist elements, but also from official state institutions as well. Dr. Sāmī Shawkat, a high official in the Ministry of Education in the pre-war years and for a while its director general, was the head of \"al-Futuwwa,\" an imitation of Hitler's Youth. In one of his addresses, \"The Profession of Death,\" he called on Iraqi youth to adopt the way of life of Nazi Fascists. In another speech he branded the Jews as the enemy from within, who should be treated accordingly. In another, he praised Hitler and Mussolini for eradicating their internal enemies (the Jews). Syrian and Palestinian teachers often supported Shawkat in his preaching.\n\nhttp://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0010_0_09571.html\n\nArmies of the young: child soldiers in war and terrorism - Page 107 - David M.

It took different forms -- Fascist, Communist and Nazi. But the movements shared a number of traits: apocalyptic and paranoid ideologies, a total police state, a taste for murder. Other versions of that same totalitarianism arose in Arab and Muslim countries in precisely those years.\n\nOne of the Muslim variations eventually emerged as the Islamist radicalism of Osama bin Laden, the Taliban and other movements. A second version evolved into Saddam Hussein's Baath dictatorship. The European inspiration for those movements is not too hard to detect, especially in the case of the Baath, which got started in 1943 in an atmosphere of ardent sympathy for the fascist Axis.\n\nKanan Makiya, an expatriate Iraqi intellectual and a main author of the transition report, described in his book \"Republic of Fear\" how these European movements influenced Islamic radicalism philosophically and organizationally. There was, for instance, the model of the Hitler Youth for the pan-Arabist Futuwwa Youth of the 1930's, which, Mr. Makiya pointed out, pioneered a paramilitary culture \"as if presaging the Baath militas\" in later years.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/31/opinion/31BERM.html?pagewanted=all\n\nDie Welt des Islams‎ - Page 136 - Religion - 1985\n\nThe Futuwwa-movement in Iraq was a youth-organization, not a political party.

Trenches and expended cartridges were strewn about, reminders of the fighting between units of the Irgun and local Arab forces that had taken place there seven months previously. There was a large Arab villa from where Traubner recovered a diary. It turned out to be the daily record of Yusuf Begovic of Pale, a town near Sarajevo in modern-day Bosnia-Herzegovina. In it Begovic had described his activities as a cook for the \"Arab Army of Liberation.\"\n\nTraubner described who Begovic had been serving: \"35 Yugoslav Muslims who had a good reason to expect to be among the first to occupy and loot Tel Aviv, were part of a group of some thousands who came to the Middle East to join the jihad against Israel.\"\n\nWhat were Yugoslav Muslims doing in Jaffa in 1948?
