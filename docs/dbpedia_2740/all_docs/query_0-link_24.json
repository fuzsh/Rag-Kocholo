Colin Meade, Telos Press, 2007, 180 pp.\n\nReviewed by Amnon Lord [2008]\n\n“We were the first to think of translating Mein Kampf,” wrote Sami al-Jundi, a leader of the Syrian Ba’ath Party in the 1930s. “Whoever lived during this period in Damascus would appreciate the inclination of the Arab people to Nazism, for Nazism was the power which could serve as its champion” (26). Al-Jundi also confessed that “we were racist, admiring Nazism, reading its books and the sources of its thought, particularly Nietzsche, Fichte, and H. S. Chamberlain” (25).\n\nHow many people know that Arab delegations and senior political figures were invited to the annual Nazi rallies in Nuremberg during the 1930s? Such details are not simply random anecdotes from the remote past. Indeed, in his new book Jihad and Jew-Hatred, German scholar Matthias Küntzel argues that the origins of the Islamist terror of recent years, which culminated in the attacks on the United States on 11 September 2001, and of the radical anti-Semitic ideologies of Hamas, Hizballah, Iran, the Palestine Covenant, and al-Qaeda, lie in the lethal link between Islamism and Nazism.\n\nhttp://www.jcpa.org/JCPA/Templates/ShowPage.asp?DRIT=3&DBID=1&LNGID=1&TMID=111&FID=253&PID=0&IID=2330&TTL=Amnon_Lord_on_Jihad_and_Jew-Hatred:__Islamism,_Nazism,_and_the_Roots_of_9/11,_by_Matthias_K%C3%BCntzel\n\nThe Nazi-Islamist Connection – Herbert Eiteneier, JCPA\n\nPalestinian maps, including in textbooks, do not show Israel at all; Palestinian sources omit the Mufti’s role in Nazism and deny the Holocaust, …\n\nhttp://www.jcpa.org/phas/phas-eiteneier-s06.htm\n\nDer Spiegel, 05/23/2007\n\nWorld War II\n\nNew Research Taints Image of Desert Fox Rommel\n\nBy Jan Friedmann\n\nArabs Shouted “Heil Rommel”\n\nHitler was celebrated in large parts of the Arab world, and some newspapers even likened him to the Prophet. The Desert Fox was almost as popular as Hitler. “Heil Rommel” was a common greeting in Arab countries.\n\nMany Arabs thought the Germans would free them from the rule of the old colonial powers France and Britain. Hitler had shown how to burst the shackles of the Treaty of Versailles. After Germany defeated France in 1940, chants against the French and British echoed around the streets of Damascus: “No more Monsieur, no more Mister, Allah’s in Heaven and Hitler’s on earth.”\n\nAdolf Hitler assured the exiled Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Muhammad Amin al-Husseini, at a meeting in Berlin in November 1941 that his goal was the “destruction of Jewry living in Arabia.” The Führer had racist objections to Arabs as well, though. He declined to shake the Mufti’s hand and refused to drink coffee with him.\n\nHitler nevertheless provided the Mufti, who later sponsored Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, with a budget of 750,000 Reichsmark per month to foment Jihad in Palestine. In an example of ideological flexibility, the SS even recruited Muslim volunteers and declared that the Muslims living in the Balkans belonged to the “racially valuable” peoples of Europe.\n\nhttp://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,484510,00.html\n\nIndigenous Indians: Agastya to Ambedkar, by Koenraad Elst, [Voice of India] 1993, 483 pages, Page 353 [8185990042, 9788185990040]\n\nYoung Fidel Castro would imitate Mussolini in front of the mirror. The secularist Baath Party in Syria and Iraq was modelled on Mussolini’s Fascist Party. The Iranian Shah Reza Pahlevi was an open admirer of Hitler (for which he was forced by the British to abdicate in favour of his son).\n\nnbsp;The Muslims in particular were enthusiastic. …Muslim nations rallied to ally with Hitler: the Bosnian Muslims, the Kalmuks, the Chechen and Ingosh, the Balkans, the Meshkets, and the Krim Tatars. In West Asia, prominant leaders like the Druze leader Shakib Arslan (Walid Jumblatt’s father) and the Mufti of Jerusalem allied themselves with Hitler.\n\nhttp://books.google.com/books?id=exVuAAAAMAAJ&q=Muslims\n\n.\n\nThe war aims and strategies of Adolf Hitler – Page 161 – Oscar Pinkus – 2005 – 537 pages\n\nThe sympathies for Hitler extended all the way from the Islamic Bosnians and Albanians in Europe to the Arab countries in Africa and…\n\nhttp://books.google.com/books?id=gPnjXC1lEJ8C&pg=PA161\n\n.\n\nJihad and Jew-hatred: Islamism, Nazism and the roots of 9/11 – Pages 10-11 – Matthias Küntzel – 2007 – 180 pages\n\nMale supremacy, sexual repression, the celebration of jihad and the glorification of a martyr’s death in war with unbelievers (al-Banna celebrated “the art of death”) and hatred of the Jews all created points of commonality with fascism and Nazism…\n\nhttp://books.google.com/books?id=q9Y8E-AYVeoC&pg=PR10\n\nPan-Arabism & Nazism\n\nArab-Jewish relations: from conflict to resolution? : essays in honour of Moshe Ma’oz, Elie Podeh, Asher Kaufman – [Sussex Academic Press] 2005 [ISBN 1903900689, 9781903900680] – Page 136\n\nKing Faysal I was far as can be imagined from anti-Semitism….

These Arab elements had been inspired by Fascists and Nazis, a fact since established by the publication of the secret Wilhemstrasse Archives. The Arab High Committee had receieved the financial support of the Nazis and Fascists who financed the revolt, with the Mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin el Husseini, acting as intermediary.

Anti-Jewish feeling mounted in parts of\n\nthe Middle East during the 1930s, as the Fascist and Nazi regimes and doctrines made increasing sense to many Arab nationalists. King Abdul Aziz of Saudi Arabia sought German arms and contacts and was favorably received. Various delegations\n\nof Syrians and Iraqis attended the Niirnberg party congresses, and there were several different Arabic translations of Mein Kampf.

Both [German representatives: Fritz] Grobba and [Heinrich] Wolf were approached in 1933 by individuals with plans to create National Socialist parties in Iraq and Palestine, respectively. The Palestine correspondent of the news-paper Al-Ahram, Joseph Francis, represented a group of Palestinian Arabs who were interested in establishing such a party. Francis wrote to Wolf in April, 1933, requesting the help of the Consulate-General in this endeavor. In Baghdad, a similar overture was made to Fritz Grobba by Abdul Ghaffur el-Bedri, publisher of the newspaper Istiqlal, and a group of his supporters, Wolf’s strong opposition to any sort of German encouragement or support for an Arab Nazi party in Palestine was conveyed in a note to the Foreign Office in Berlin in June, 1933,… In Berlin, the Foreign Office concurred with Wolf’s opposition to Arab efforts to involve Germany in the creation of an Arab National party in Palestine… provided the rationale behind the instructions issued to Wolf on the matter…\n\nThe objections that Herr Wolf has raised against the promotion of an Arab National Socialist movement by official German representatives are fully supported here.

Throughout the 1930s the children of wealthy Palestinians returned home from European universities having witnessed the emergence of fascist paramilitary forces. Palestinian students educated in Germany returned to Palestine determined to found the Arab Nazi Party. The Husseinis used the Palestinian Arab Party to establish the al-Futuwwa youth corps, which was named after an association of Arab Nazi Scouts. By 1936 the Palestinian Arab Party was sponsoring the developments of storm troops patterned on the German model. These storm troops, all children and youth, were to be outfitted in black trousers and red shirts… The young recruits took the following oath: “Life — my right; independence — my aspiration; Arabism — my country, and there is no room in it for any but Arabs. In this I believe and Allah is my witness.”\n\n[…]\n\nThe al-Futuwwa youth groups connected Palestinian youth to fascist youth movements elsewhere in the Middle East. While the Mufti was establishing youth groups in Palestine, al-Futuwwa groups were established in Iraq.\n\nhttp://books.google.com/books?id=zQYQ0tho6mAC&pg=PA106\n\nThe PLO: the rise and fall of the Palestine Liberation Organization, Volume 1984, Part 2\n\nJillian Becker, [Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1984] Pages 29, 293\n\n[p. 29]\n\n…movement in Palestine, the ‘Army of Salvation’ and a paramilitary youth organization, ostensibly a scout movement, called Futuwwah.\n\n[p. 293]\n\nFutuwwah (Mufti movement)\n\nhttp://books.google.com/books?cd=1&id=H7BtAAAAMAAJ&dq=futuwwah\n\nThe birth of the Palestinian refugee problem revisited, Benny Morris, Cambridge University Press, 2004, p. 28\n\nMore important in ‘militarization’ of Arab Palestine was the establishment by the Hussenis of the Futuwa (youth companies), in which youngsters were trained in military drill and the use of weapons.

Written with vigor and extraordinary access to primary sources in several languages, Icon of Evil is the definitive account of the man who, during World War II, was called “the fuhrer of the Arab world” and whose ugly legacy lives on today. With new and disturbing details, David G. Dalin and John F. Rothmann show how al -Husseini ingratiated himself with his hero, Adolf Hitler, becoming, with his blond hair and blue eyes, an “honorary Aryan” while dreaming of being installed as Nazi leader of the Middle East. Al-Husseini would later recruit more than 100,000 Muslims in Europe to fight in divisions of the Waffen-SS, and obstruct negotiations with the Allies that might have allowed four thousand Jewish children to escape to Palestine. Some believe that al-Husseini even inspired Hitler to implement the Final Solution. At wars end, al-Husseini escaped indictment at Nuremberg and was harbored in France. Icon of Evil chronicles al-Husseinis postwar relationships with such influential Islamic figures as the radical theoretician Sayyid Qutb and Saddam Husseins powerful uncle General Khairallah Talfah and his crucial mentoring of the young Yasser Ararat. Finally, it provides compelling evidence that al-Husseinis actions and writings serve as inspirations today to the leaders of Hamas, Hezbollah, and other terrorist organizations pledged to destroy Israel and the United States.\n\nhttp://books.google.com/books?id=QMts5Z36kjAC\n\np. 131\n\nDuring the 1920 and 1930s. Haj Amin al-Husseini was one of the first radical Islamic leaders to issue fatwas, or religious rulings, calling for jihad, or holy war, against Great Britain, the United States, the Jews, and the West. Since Workd War I, during which al-Husseini served as an officer in the Ottoman Turkish army, the fatwa was served as a major instrument by which Islamic religious leaders have impelled their followers to engage in acts of jihad, which invariably involved acts of violence and terrorism.\n\nhttp://books.google.com/books?id=QMts5Z36kjAC&pg=PA131\n\nWolfgang G.

He intervened with the Nazis to prevent the escape to Palestine of thousands of European Jews, who were sent instead to the death camps. He also conspired with the Nazis to bring the Holocaust to Palestine. The mufti “invented a new form of Jew-hatred by recasting it in an Islamic mold,” according to German scholar Matthias Küntzel. The mufti’s fusion of European anti-Semtism—particularly the genocidal variety—with Koranic views of Jewish wickedness has become the hallmark of Islamists world-wide, from al Qaeda to Hamas and Hezbollah. During his time in Berlin, the mufti ran the Nazis’ Arab-language propaganda radio program, which incited Muslims in the Mideast to “kill the Jews wherever you find them. This pleases God, history and religion.” Among the many listeners was also the man later known as Ayatollah Khomeini, who used to tune in to Radio Berlin every evening, according to Amir Taheri’s biography of the Iranian leader. Khomeini’s disciple Mahmoud Ahmadinejad still spews the same venom pioneered by the mufti as do Islamic hate preachers around the world.\n\nMuslim Judeophobia is not—as is commonly claimed—a reaction to the Mideast conflict but one of its main “root causes.” It has been fueling Arab rejection of a Jewish state long before Israel’s creation.\n\nhttp://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203440104574400532495168894.html\n\nGlobal Issues: Selections From CQ Researcher – Page 158 – CQ Researcher – [Pine Forge Press] 2009\n\n[ISBN 1412980372, 9781412980371] – 368 pages\n\nThe Mufti fled Palestine in 1938 to avoid arrest by the British for his part in the Arab revolt. He spent most of the war in Berlin, recruiting Bosnian Muslims for the SS, the semi-military Nazi organization that oversaw Hitler’s extermination of the Jews. From 1939 to 1945, the Mufti’s Arabic radio broadcasts, which mixed anti-Semitic propaganda with quotes from the Koran, made his station the most popular in the Arab world.\n\n[…]\n\nIn 1943, as a propaganda stunt, SS leader Heinrich Himmler wanted to permit 5,000 Jewish children to emigrate to Palestine, in exchange for 20,000 German prisoners. The mufti fought against the plan, and the children were sent to the gas chambers. The Nazis funded the burgeoning growth of Muslim fundamentalism, helping the radical Muslim Brotherhood distribute Arabic translations of Mein Kampf, …\n\nhttp://books.google.com/books?id=6HPB3DlB-m8C&pg=PA158\n\nA history of the Middle East, Saul S.

As he put it, Arab people everywhere were prepared to act as is proper against the common enemy… Haj Amin was receptive to Hitler’s offer in March 1941 of a German volunteer legion that would be parachuted into Iraq. He proclaimed Iraq’s declaration of war in May 1941, a jihad. And when that revolt was snuffed, the mufti incited a pogrom in Baghdad that left 110 Jews dead.\n\n[p. 242]\n\nAfter the failure of the Gailani coup, the Mufti fled to Iran, where he encouraged Reza Khan to oppose the British and Russians. When the allies jointly occupied Persia in August 1941, he fled to Italy, claiming that he had no place else to go. On November 20, the mufti was granted a 90-minute audience with Adolf Hitler at the latter’s Wilhelmstrasse residence. He sought a blessing from the Nazi leader for the creation of a proposed Arab state. Hitler replied it was premature…\n\nFor the duration of the war, the mufti was housed in two elegant villas and subsidized to the sum of 75000 marks per month for heading a special Buro des Grosmufti. Its threefold function: (a) espionage (training of saboteurs), (b) propaganda (public broadcasts on Muslim holy days), and (c) recruitment of 500000 troops for the Waffen SS. Although the numbers never reached such size, dozens of his recruits were charged as war criminals in Bosnia, Croatia, Serbia and Lithuania.\n\n[..]\n\nHaj Amin told one Nazi official: “The Jewish national home must disappear and the Jews get out. They are free to go to Hell.”\n\n[…]\n\nWhenever one of Hitler’s puppets contemplated negotiation with the Allies to rescue Jews, the Mufti presented a stumpling block…\n\nThus, when King Boris indicated a willingness release 4000 Jewish children for Palestine in May 1943, the mufti protested that the children “present a degree of danger…” Later that month, the mufti reacted against a proposal… that would have permitted 80,000 Jews to flee Romania..\n\n[p. 243]\n\nAt a time when the Nazis were transporting Jews to killing centers in Poland, Haj Amin declared, “The Arab nation awaits the solution of the world Jewish problem by its friends, the Axis powers.” He knew what the Nazis mean by Endlosung.\n\nAs Dieter von Wisliceny, one of Adolf Eichmann’s aides, reported: “The grand mufti has repeatedly suggested to the Nazi authorities, including Hitler, Ribbentrop, and Himmler the extermination of European Jewry… Even as the military situation deteriorated for Germany in the last 18 months of the war, the mufti found himself drawn closer to his Nazi associates… photographs with Himmler… pledged cooperation And he made it very clear that when the time was appropriate, he would call upon the “best saviour of the Arabs”—Adolph Eichmann—to apply his expertise in shuttling Jews to death camps. Eichmann had met the mufti in the Middle East in 1937 and later testified that he had instructed to open all field on Jewish Question to the affable Arabs….\n\nhttp://books.google.com/books?id=LCNpmgDOYTwC&pg=PA241\n\nA safe haven: Harry S.

First, Kirchwey and the Nation Associates gave out a lengthy report on the pro- Axis activities of the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem to all fifty-five delegations to the United Nations. Most striking was the fact that it was based on classified U.S. government files… The Arab Higher Committee, the report charged, was the “creature of the Arab League” and was run from Egypt by the Mufti, Haj Amin al-Husseini. The committee’s members were not elected representatives but “nothing more . . . than a deal among leaders of the various Arab factions in Palestine—and the will of the grand Mufti.” Three members of the Palestine Arab Higher Committee who were delegates to the U.N. General Assemply, were called, in the Nation Associates report, men who ranked with the “worst of the Axis war criminals.”\n\n… The accounts of the Mufti, Kirchway explained, was documented from captured files belonging to the mufti and the German High Command, all found by American military authorities in Germany.\n\nAlong with the report were documents and photos that substantiated the charge that the Mufti controlled and directed the Arab Higher Committee. Photos used showed the Mufti and the other Arab leaders with Adolf Hitler, Heinrich Himmler, and Dino Alfieri…\n\n[p. 213]\n\nEmil Ghouri, the head of the Arab delegation to UNSCOP, and delegates Wasef Kamal and Rasem Khalidi as “notorious for … association with the Mufti and his Axis activities.”\n\nMufti’s Jamal Husseini… had joined the Mufti in Iraq in 1939… organized a pro-Axis fifth column that led to the anti-British rebellion.\n\n[…] In the Hague, Arab students were trained in explosives and parachuted into Turkey, Syria, and Iraq. Captured records also revealed that the Mufti had accompanied Adolf Eichmann to visit the gas chambers at Auschwitz. Moreover, the Mufti had put an end to negotiations being carried out to ransom Jews in Bratislava, insisting that they all be liquidated. A letter the Mufti had written to Heinrich Heinrich Himmler revealed the Mufti complaining that Joachim Ribbentrop and Himmler had been too lenient, since the had let some Jews leave Germany. “If such practices continue,” the Mufti was quoted as saying, “it would be incomprehensible to Arabs and Moslems\n\nhttp://books.google.com/books?id=B3SmdKOSPQEC&pg=PA213\n\nThe record of collaboration of King Farouk of Egypt with the Nazis and their ally, the Mufti: the official Nazi records of the King’s alliance and of the Mufti’s plans for bombing Jerusalem and Tel Aviv ; memorandum submitted to the United Nations, June 1948 [Nation Associates (New York, N.Y.), United Nations, The Nation Associates, 1948]\n\nPLANS FOR BOMBING JERUSALEM AND TEL AVIV MEMORANDUM SUBMITTED TO THE UNITED NATIONS JUNE 1948\n\nMufti Urged Nazis to Bomb Jerusalem and Tel Aviv While the …\n\nrevealed in a number of secret documents found by the Allies Armies in Germany…\n\nThus, according to one of these documents, a secret report of the German Air Force Command, dated October 29, 1943, revealed that the Mufti for the past six months had been proposing an attack… “…any attack must be carried out with a very large force in order to have a lasting effect.” But Fieldmarshal Goering was obliged to turn down…\n\nApparently the Mufti did not rest…\n\nhttp://books.google.com/books?&id=tdhmAAAAMAAJ&dq=TEL+AVIV\n\nhttp://books.google.com/books?&id=tdhmAAAAMAAJ&dq=Goering\n\nIcon of evil: Hitler’s mufti and the rise of radical Islam – David G.

They have proclaimed the Jihad, Holy war, against Israel, the war which according to the Koran must end with the enemy’s total annihilation. In this endeavor the Arabs are making use of the methods applied by the Germans during the Holocaust as well as by directions resulting from their employment of former SS officials.\n\n[…]\n\nAs we have stated before in this chapter, history must be viewed as a continuum. Such an unfortunate continuum regarding the Holocaust exist in the continuing Nazi-Arab connection. The influence of these two groups upon each other is mutual. Too little attention is being paid to the way in which Arabs contributed to the effectiveness of the Final Solution program. Haj Amin el Husseini, head of the Supreme Muslim Council and Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, a venomous Jew-hater, had prior to the war organized Arab terrorism against the Jews in Palestine. From 1941 on, he spent much of his time shuttling between Berlin and Rome. He met in Berlin with Ernst von Weizsaecker, State Secretary in the German Foreign Office, with Himmler, and on November 28, 1941 with Hitler. In his meeting, the Mufti tried to strengthen the Fuehrer’s decision to ” exterminate” all Jews, and both agreed that the Germans would fight the Jews mercilessly, in all of Europe “and beyond.”[…]\n\nThe Mufti had also met with Eichmann and visited Auschwitz. In Rome, he was received by the Italian Foreign Minister, Count Ciano, and by Mussolini himself. In his meetings with the German officials, the Mufti stressed the need to wipe out as many Jews as possible and to finally revoke the designation of Palestine as a Jewish National Home. He proposed that after the German victory,an Arab state –under his leadership– be created that would consist of Syria, Iraq, Transjordan and the Wesrern, Jewish part of Palestine. In return the Mufti promised Arab revolts against the British who were then predominant in these areas. One such serious revolt aganst the British occured in April 1941.\n\nhttp://books.google.com/books?id=SlSDYmjJNU0C&pg=PA235\n\nLIFE – Oct 27, 1952 – Page 145 – Vol. 33, No. 17 – 156 pages – Magazine – Full viewMYSTERY MAN OF ISLAM SPEAKS In exclusive talk, mufti defends tie to Hitler and record on Jews by JAMES BELL The name of Haj Amin el Husseini, usually called the Mufti of Jerusalem, has been associated with assassination, riot, …\n\nDuring the Palestine war the Muft’s holy fighters terrorized Jews, blew up houses and killed many people…\n\nhttp://books.google.com/books?id=2lIEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA145\n\n[Rachid] Rashid Ali al-Gailani\n\n[Rashid Ali el Kailani]\n\n[Rashid ‘Ali al-Keilani]\n\n[Sayyad Rashid el Keilani]\n\nNazi propaganda for the Arab world – Page 60 – Jeffrey Herf – [Yale University Press] 2009\n\n[ISBN 0300145799, 9780300145793] – 335 pages – Preview\n\n… 1941, Rashid Ali Kilani led a pro-Axis coup that overthrew the Iraqi government of General Taha el-Hashimi. Haj Amin el-Husseini was deeply involved. The coup plotters included Yunis …\n\nhttp://books.google.com/books?id=YzQNSTvHv-sC&pg=PA60\n\nThe Iraq coup of Raschid Ali in 1941, the Mufti Husseini and the Farhud… The Coup – On April 1, 1941 the “Golden Square” and the chief of staff of the Iraqi army staged the coup, and appointed Rashid ‘Ali al-Keilani head of the government. Nuri as Said was forced to flee Iraq along with the regent and young king Faysal II. On April 3, a letter from the German Secretary of State Von Weizacker answered Haddad’s letter favorably, but the letter arrived after the coup.\n\nRashid ‘Ali stated on April 10 that he would honor the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930, apparently fearing British reprisals .On April 16, Rashid responded to a request for landing of British troops at Basra cautiously. He replied that they could land, but must embark immediately for Palestine or Egypt. The British began landing troops on April 16 or 18 at Basra, at first in compliance with Rashid Ali’s conditions, and later in violation of the conditions, since the troops did not leave. The British played for time and made pretences of accepting the new situation. However, reinforcements from India kept arriving at Basra.\n\nThe Iraqi government was also trying to buy time, and entered into a pretence of Turkish mediation of the crisis. However, the Iraqi representative in Turkey, told the German Ambassador von Papen, that there would be no compromise with the British. Raschid Ali had already asked the Italians for military aid at the end of March, and likewise, Hitler decided on April 10 to send military aid to the Iraqis. However, the shipments took several weeks. The German foreign office got a report from General Keitel of a large shipment, including, for example, some 15,000 rifles and about 800 machine guns. Arms were shipped from Saloniki and through Turkey and Syria. The shipments from Syria were sent as a consequence of the agreement between the Vichy leader Darlan and Hitler as to general collaboration between Vichy and Germany. In the same agreement Vichy also agreed to allow German aircraft to base and stage through Syria on their way to Iraq, though there would be some pretence involved, so that the Vichy government could plausibly deny to Britain that it was assisting the German war effort. The French also rationed German fuel supplies, and as the Luftwaffe was unable to obtain fuel from Persia or elsewhere, this hampered their effectiveness.\n\nA second group of British troops landed at Basra on April 28, and the Iraqis protested. On the evening of April 29, about 9,000 troops of the Iraqi army surrounded the RAF air base at Habaniyeh and the next day the Iraqis ordered that no flights were to take off. However, the Iraqis had insufficient force. The move was instigated by the “Golden Square” officers. Rashid Ali himself apparently wanted to avoid antagonizing the British and wait for supplies from the Germans.\n\nThe British strike back – The British struck to lift the siege of Habanniyeh, remove Rashid Ali from power and restore the pro-British government. Though they were initially unable to move from Basra overland, because of the weather and because Iraqis had cut lines of communication, the British were able to use the RAF at Habbaniyeh and Shaiba effectively, and began attacking on May 2. They had about 90 aircraft, mostly antiquated, but these included a number of Wellington bombers[8]. . The RAF struck the Iraqis surrounding Habbaniyeh The Iraqis used their air force [9], very sparingly and not very effectively. At the same time, relatively small numbers of British reinforcements were ferried by air from Basra. Iraqi anti-aircraft fire and artillery proved ineffective. By May 6 the Iraqi force was defeated and the siege of Habbaniyeh was abandoned, though the roads were still blocked. The RAF also destroyed most of the Iraqi air force on the ground by about May 8.\n\nGerman Aid – During this time, several German officers and diplomats were seconded to Iraq to oversee Luftwaffe operations and the arms supply. Dr Fritz Grobba, the former consul, now returned to oversee the arms shipments and a Major Hansen was sent to oversee the transfer of aircraft. Grobba allegedly distributed sums of money to both Rashid Ali and the Mufti. Raschid Ali got about 90,000 pounds, and the Mufti reportedly got about $10,000.\n\nhttp://www.mideastweb.org/iraqaxiscoup.htm\n\nReference Guide to the Nazis and Arabs During the Holocaust: A Concise Guide to the Relationship and Conspiracy of the Nazis and the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem in North Africa and the Middle East During the Era of the Holocaust – Pages 32-3 – Shelomo Alfassa – [Lulu.com] 2006 [ISBN 0976322633, 9780976322634] – 70 pages\n\nWorking with an old ally, Rashid Ali al-Gaylani, who became prime minister of Iraq in March 1940, the Mufti “obtained promises of Axis support, and in April 1941 carried out an anti-British and pro-Nazi coup” in Baghdad.\n\nhttp://books.google.com/books?id=T2g2XA53UOEC&pg=PA32\n\n[p. 33]\n\nFrom Syria they extended their activities to Iraq, where they helped to establish a pro-Nazi regime headed by Rashid Ali al-Gailani.

According to sources on both sides of the Atlantic, it was Philby who advised Ibn Saud energetically to court Nazi Germany in the months before the war. The relationship was mutually beneficial. As one US intelligence study found, the Nazis “recognized that King Ibn Saud’s help was essential for renewing the fight against the British and the Jews in Palestine.” The Germans proposed that a new government should be formed in Palestine, under the control of Jack’s old friend, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem. Further, “Jews who had settled in Palestine after the First World War would not be allowed to remain.”\n\nIn January 1939 Saudi Arabia established diplomatic relations with the Third Reich, and Ibn Saud confided to the Germans that at heart he “hated the English. ” In the following months he concluded arms deals with Germany and signed a friendship and trade treaty with Japan. Philby was pleased, especially as Ibn Saud concealed his secret dealings with the Axis from both the British and Americans. The Nazis also were pleased with the progress they had made with the king. They sent their best Middle East agent, Fritz Grobba, to meet with Ibn Saud, and even promised to obtain for him the most prestigious position in the Moslem world, the caliphate. The Saudi-Third Reich connection flourished, with their main link being their mutual hatred for the Jews.\n\nThe Nazis even promised to supply Ibn Saud with weapons, ammunition, and an armaments factory, and, according to some accounts, gave him bribes during most of World War II.\n\nThe king had many reasons for his secret arms deals with Berlin. The primary purpose “was to increase the flow of weapons which [Ibn Saud] had secretly been sending to the Arabs fighting in Palestine,” in order to “check the Zionist influx that had followed the Balfour Declaration.” Although he later claimed to be genuinely horrified by the Nazis’ Final Solution , Ibn Saud’s attitude toward the Jews was extreme, even by Arab standards.
