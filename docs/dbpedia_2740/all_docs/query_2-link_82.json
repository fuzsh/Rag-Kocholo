CHATS, based in Aurora, about 35 km north of Toronto, relies heavily on the support of front-line workers (FLWs) to provide vital services to individuals living with chronic health conditions, aging needs and/or disabilities. The COVID-19 pandemic put a significant strain on health-care providers, who were already dealing with funding and staffing issues. CHATS is partnering with Alla Yakerson, Professor, School of Health Sciences, to conduct an interview-based study to improve worker satisfaction amongst FLWs. Ideally, the results will lead to the development of techniques to increase retention and recruitment. Minimizing Mental Health Impact of Burnout and Vicarious Trauma on Front-line Workers of the Residential Care Agencies Mitacs -MHRC Partnership 2022 The Ontario Association of Residences Treating Youth (OARTY) is a provincial association of private residential services. OARTY members provide support to individuals requiring temporary, short or long-term residential care, including those impacted by abuse and neglect and those with developmental challenges, among others. Currently, OARTY and its members face a high staff turnover. While there are many contributing factors, like limited financial resources and shift work, burnout and vicarious trauma are two of the major causes. The mental health implications related to burnout and vicarious trauma are felt by both the staff who resign from the workplace, but also by those in their care, as losing staff has a significant negative impact on their overall treatment. OARTY is partnering with Seneca Professor Enza Badolato and Research Assistant Selvini Devasagayam, to identify strategies that, when implemented by OARTY and its members, will help minimize the negative impacts of burnout and vicarious trauma. Exploring the Impact of De-escalation Training on Recruit Officers’ Tactical Decision Making During Crisis Encounters. Seneca Applied Research Fund (ARF) 2021 Seneca's Bachelors of Crime and Intelligence Analysis (BCIA) program has forged a unique relationship with the Ontario Police College (OPC) to measure the impact of deescalation training on police recruits’ tactical decision-making during crisis encounters. The Ministry of Community Safety and Corrections has prioritized deescalation training for all officers and OPC has introduced a preliminary model into its training practices. Techniques focus on increasing time and space to mitigate effects of psychophysiological arousal (increased heart rate and blood pressure, etc.) and increase tactical flexibility and decision-making, such as increased two way communication versus one way communication, and transition to less lethal force options. The aim of the research is to identify effective de-escalation tactics to build into standardized training delivered by Provincial Use of Force Trainers. BCIA students’ researchers are fully integrated into the project and will assist with research design, data collection, analysis, report writing and delivery of findings to senior OPC administrators.

Led by Sonal Kamath and Sharon Robertson, professors from the school, student Research Assistants from Seneca’s Cosmetic Science graduate certificate program will apply their academic knowledge and skills, while developing practical experience in formulation and evaluating product efficacy, to create a prototype formulation of a TTO-free wipe designed to be effective against Demodex mites that does not cause irritation to the eye. This new formulation will reinforce I-MED's position in the global market as a leader in dry eye care and eye hygiene.\n\nCoping with Crisis: Senior newcomers during COVID-19 Seneca Applied Research Fund (ARF) 2020 The COVID-19 global pandemic brought to light many of our social inequities and revealed the fault lines present in our cities and communities. Among the most vulnerable populations were seniors. Death tolls in long-term care homes surged, community groups closed, and many seniors went through a period of isolation and chaos. In this applied research project, Seneca is partnering with a community organization that serves the needs of immigrant seniors. Working in close collaboration with the Afghan Women’s Organization Refugee & Immigrant Services, the Intercultural Iranian Canadian Resource Centre contributes to building strong communities by supporting urban newcomer communities. This project will explore the ways seniors within this community coped, and what their needs were during the COVID-related lockdown of 2020. This applied research project will offer ways the organization can transform to better serve the needs of this population at times of disruption and crisis. Interactions among cricket frass-based soil amendments, biological control agents, and mycorrhizae in organic soil Seneca Applied Research Fund (ARF) 2020 This research project is aimed at characterizing the interactions among different biologically-based soil inputs in organic agricultural and horticultural ecosystems. Aspire Food Group (AFG) aims to meet public demand for sustainable and nutritious protein sources through its production of cricket protein powder. Cricket frass, an important by-product of the cricket protein powder production operations, is considered an effective, organically acceptable, soil-applied plant fertilizer product. No formal research has been conducted to investigate the interactions among cricket frass soil amendments, soil-applied biological control agents like entomopathogenic nematodes, and plant-fungal associations, such as mycorrhizae. This project will aim to describe and identify potential synergies or antagonisms among these various organic soil inputs. The results of this research will provide AFG and, ultimately, its clients, with valuable information supporting the successful application of its cricket frass products in complex, biologically active organic soils. Enhancing Language and Learning Development for Children with Disabilities Living in Rural and Remote Communities, using an Interactive Web-Based Assistive Communication Platform Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) – College and Community Innovation program – College and Community Social Innovation Fund (CCSIF) 2020 According to Statistics Canada there are an estimated 75,000 Canadian school-age children living with speech and language delays. Moreover, 51.5 per cent of them had unmet or partially met needs with regards to access to assistive technology, demonstrated to impact development and social and well-being outcomes. Children with complex communication needs living in remote and rural regions, and Indigenous communities in Canada face significantly disproportionate access to assistive technologies. Approximately one in five Canadians live in rural and isolated areas and this includes a significant number of children and youth who lack access to Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) systems due to an insufficient level of required support and services from qualified clinicians. While service provider capacity is a longstanding concern, there are also other systemic issues that impact the quality of such services: long waitlists for assessments, lack of trained staff, and communication or procedural barriers across the circle of care between families and professionals within and across the education and community-support sectors. Linggo is a Toronto-based company that developed a novel AAC system to assist individuals with complex communication needs. It has partnered with Seneca’s Professors Mark Tucci and Catherine Leung to expand the functionality of Linggo AAC to transform it into an AAC Virtual Care platform that can be deployed into rural and remote regions. In the first phase of the project, Seneca and Linggo teams will build a Training Portal and develop a comprehensive set of training videos. In the next step, the platform will be deployed in various communities across Canada where the system’s efficacy will be evaluated. The goal is to demonstrate that by providing training, access to tools, and provisions for remote consultations to a child’s circle of care, we can significantly mitigate challenges that rural and remote communities face in providing the highest quality of care to citizens; and advancing children’s speech and language development and associated social and well-being outcomes. This applied research project is supported through NSERC College and Community Social Innovation Fund (CCSIF) grant. LINGGO: An Augmentative and Alternative Communication System (AAC) for Non-Verbal Individuals Centre for Aging + Brain Health Innovation (CABHI) – Spark+ Program 2020\n\nPeople with various conditions that affect their ability to speak (e.g. dementia, Alzheimer's and stroke) require assistive technologies such as augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) systems, to communicate daily with their caregivers, and participate in community activities. Communication partners in a patient’s circle of care (caregivers, guardians and support workers, etc.) require training and instruction on how to effectively use the Linggo AAC system, to support the individual with limited speech in their daily life.\n\nLinggo is a Toronto-based company that developed a novel AAC system to assist individuals with complex communication needs. The company has partnered with Bethany Kopel, Professor, and her team of Research Assistants from Seneca’s Behavioural Sciences diploma program, to develop and assess video training content for Linggo AAC. The goal is to demonstrate that the provision of video-based training to communication partners (primary caregivers/individuals in the circle-of-care) will significantly improve the functional communication of non-verbal individuals. The project also anticipates that social engagement and overall well-being of users will also be significantly improved, and reduce challenging behaviour in the inter-personal and/or interprofessional relationships in the circle of care due to the developing presence of functional communication through the use of the Linggo AAC system.\n\nElevating the Voices of Children and Youth in Care Seneca Applied Research Fund (ARF) 2019 A research team from Seneca’s School of Community Services, Child & Youth Care advanced diploma program worked in collaboration with Jen’s Place, a residential program in Alliston, Ont. Jen’s Place provides quality care in a nurturing therapeutic environment for female youth ages 11 to 18. This project was a descriptive study and document analysis designed to assess how well the voices of young people in care are heard in the planning, implementation and ongoing service delivery of their care plan as outlined by the Ministry of Children, Community and Social Services. This project surveyed young people in care, frontline workers and managers/operators at a variety of residential care programs. The goal of the research is to improve the tools and processes in residential care to ensure that young people are aware of these tools and are given every opportunity to utilize these tools in order to maximize their voice. The Development, Implementation and Evaluation of an Online Gambling Self-Help Tutorial with Ontario Postsecondary Students Seneca Applied Research Fund (ARF) 2019 Ontario is undergoing a major expansion of gambling and gaming opportunities in casinos and online. Young adults in the postsecondary environment are at higher risk of becoming involved with gambling due to social influences that entice young people to play. Health concerns associated with excessive gambling include debt, disruptions in psychosocial functioning, depression and suicide. Seneca in collaboration with the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) are designing, implementing and evaluating a self-help tutorial for postsecondary students to teach students about the fallacies of gambling. Best Practice Guidelines for Pet Loss Support Seneca Applied Research Fund (ARF) 2019\n\nVCA Animal Hospital originated from a small group of hospitals in Calgary back in 1981. Since, VCA has grown and developed into Canada's largest network of animal hospitals. VCA serves pet parents across British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario and Quebec. Their hospitals are committed to caring for our life's greatest animal companions.\n\nVCA understands that the staff working in the animal care industry do not receive formalized training on supporting clients and themselves in the context of pet loss. Clients, however, expect that their loss will be understood, and care will be provided accordingly. As a focused measure, VCA is collaborating with Seneca to develop Best Practice Guidelines that will address both inter-related issues discussed above. When staff are equipped, they are more likely to provide clients with meaningful care thus ensure everyone’s needs are being met.\n\nThe major outcome of this project will a Pet Loss Best Practice Guidelines report, which will become the basis of an end-of-project training with VCA staff. The project is led by Seneca Professor Angie Arora of the Social Service Worker – Immigrants and Refugees diploma program and Professor Kirsti Clarida, Co-ordinator from Seneca’s Veterinary Technician diploma program.\n\nThe Guidelines will be presented to industry stakeholders and then applied to case studies in order to improve the capacity of VCA staff to adequately care for the emotional needs of their clients while still working within their professional roles. The research will employ two Research Assistants from Seneca’s Veterinary Technician diploma program and will consist of an online survey that will be created through a platform licensed by Seneca and supported by Seneca’s Centre for Institutional Data and Enterprise Analytics (C-IDEA). The data from this survey will be analyzed and then inform the development of the best practice guidelines with input and collaboration from experts.\n\nThe value realized through this project will be practical resiliency skills acquisition, which are considered to be a key support in caregiver compassion fatigue. The more equipped staff feel in responding to clients in grief, the less likely they are to experience burnout. When staff are equipped, they are more likely to provide clients with meaningful care thus ensuring everyone’s needs, and their own, are being met.\n\nWeShare Housing Preliminary Research Project Seneca Applied Research Fund (ARF) 2018 Neighbourlink North York was founded in 1994 in the Willowdale area of Toronto, to serve its residents. The primary motivation was the concern about the growing numbers of people, especially seniors, who were living in isolation and poverty. The NLNY mandate is to foster a support network that helps to build stronger communities and enrich the quality of life of its constituents. In order to achieve these goals, NeighbourLink North York offers many free, short-term, non-emergency services such as: at-home services, transportation, food security support, professional services and many more. One of the recent Neighbourlink initiatives is the WeShare Housing concept. WeShare Housing is a way to help home-owning seniors live in their homes longer by renting space to a single parent family for a reduced rate, in exchange for assistance with chores and companionship. The initiative seeks to bring seniors who need support to continue living in their homes, together with sole support mothers, who need an affordable place to live to provide companionship and practical support that is mutually beneficial. NeighbourLink is partnering with Professor Jane Haddad from Seneca’s Leadership and Human Resources program, to conduct a preliminary research into the feasibility and success factors of the WeShare Housing idea. The findings will be used to plan and execute the pilot project.

The pandemic has created a major shift in the JNBS customer base, from approximately 85 per cent business-to-business and 15 per cent business-to-consumer to now about 85 per cent B2C and 15 per cent B2B. Consumers are not trained professionals in the safe use of nail and beauty acrylic products. The shift in consumer utilization of these products, which are known to be potentially hazardous if misused over the near and long term, is a significant concern for ongoing consumer in-home use. The average consumer does not have the training or capacity to handle and store these acrylic products safely. Since there are known evidence-based health and wellness impacts associated with misuse and over-exposure to these products, creating a healthier and safer alternative for consumers can ensure a viable future for this dynamic market shift to consumer in-home use, as well as presenting a viable new business venture for JNBS.\n\nPrincipal Investigator, Barkev Keoshkerian, and Co-Investigator, Sharon Robertson, both professors in Seneca’s School of Biological Sciences & Applied Chemistry, will investigate safer alternatives to ethyl methacrylate (EMA) acrylic nail treatments, including alternative acrylic compounds, water dispersible polymers and film-forming biological polymers.

Wellesley’s current purification process for GlcNAc requires the use of a multistep, organic solvent based, extraction and precipitation methodology. This method is costly, has negative effects on the environment and has safety concerns - expensive explosion proof processing is required. Wellesley is collaborating with Seneca’s School of Biological Sciences and Applied Chemistry (BSAC) to adopt a new green chemistry approach to product recovery and purification. This approach will incorporate the physical solubility properties of GlcNAc to eliminate the need for organic solvent associated precipitation. Wellesley is engaged in the clinical development of GlcNAc for multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy and Parkinson’s disease. Claims for the treatment of these indications will require Wellesley to file a new drug application, requiring a detailed description of physical and chemical manufacturing processes and controls for production. The experimental work carried out at Seneca will translate to inform a detailed description and rationale for the intended commercial production methods to meet the new drug application requirements. Development of a hard surface anti-microbial film/coating Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) – College and Community Innovation Program – Innovation Enhancement (IE) grants – Seneca Centre for Innovation in Life Sciences (SCILS) 2020\n\nGiftgowns, a Toronto company, has collaborated on R&D projects with Seneca to formulate and develop an anti-bacterial prototype spray for porous surfaces, using the concept of encapsulation of essential oils in nanoparticles (EOiP).\n\nThe proposed project under Seneca’s Centre for Innovation in Life Sciences (SCILS), will look to modify the existing spray formulation so that, once sprayed, a quick drying film or coating will be left behind for as an anti-bacterial hard surface application. The project will be led by Professor Barkev Keoshkerian and Professor David Zwick, in addition to two recent graduates from Seneca’s Biotechnology – Advanced diploma program.\n\nIf the development of the hard surface anti-microbial film/coating is successful, this would provide broad-spectrum protection against microorganisms — not just through a barrier — but also through a long-acting viricidal and bactericidal effect. Once the spray is applied, the surface will be decontaminated and remain in a protected state for a prolonged period, even after repeated contacts with an undesirable agent, such as COVID-19.\n\nImproving Harvestable Yields and Antioxidant, Vitamin and Mineral Contents in Hydroponically Grown Basil and Mint using Indoor Vertical Gardens Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) – College and Community Innovation Program – Engage Grants for colleges 2020\n\nJust Vertical is an indoor, vertical farming company, located in Toronto, that builds, sells and supports indoor growing gardens and farming modules.

Giftgowns approached Seneca’s School of Biological Sciences & Applied Chemistry to help them solve the challenge of providing anti-bacterial properties to their gowns.\n\nSeneca and Giftgowns collaborated with joint funding from NSERC Engage for Colleges as well as an Ontario Centres of Excellence College for Technology Adoption to develop an anti-bacterial prototype spray, which was developed from the encapsulation of essential oils (EO), specifically thymol (a major component of oregano essential oils) into nano-particles.\n\nIn this follow-up applied research project, two research assistants (RAs) from Seneca’s Biotechnology – Advanced diploma program, under the supervision of Professor Barkev Keoshkerian and Professor Frank Merante, sought to investigate the efficacy of other essential oils, as well as other experimental extracts, to determine an array of effective and persistent anti-microbial properties from extracts studied.\n\nThis project was designed with the purpose of developing a simple, scalable and cost efficient nanofabricated-particle that can function as an anti-microbial carrier and controlled release vehicle using sustainable, eco-friendly, anti-microbial materials. This product, and the processes needed to manufacture and apply it, will be a new, enhanced offering for Giftgowns.\n\nTesting of a prototype antimicrobial spray Ontario Centre of Innovation (OCI) – College Voucher for Technology Adoption (CVTA) 2019\n\nGiftgowns, a Toronto-based startup company, manufactures and sells comfortable, stylized hospital and maternity gowns for consumers to bring with them to the hospital or give as a gift to friends or loved ones staying in the hospital. In 2020, Giftgowns also launched face masks to help customers stay safe during the pandemic.\n\nThe hospital and maternity gowns are popular, however, unlike the standard issue, utilitarian “blue hospital gowns”, which are washed and sterilized every day; hospitals will not wash a patient’s personal items. Since Giftgowns’ gowns are washed by family and friends (thus less frequently), there is the potential to increase the risk of hospital-acquired infections, especially during transportation.\n\nThe focus for this second collaboration with Giftgowns included modification to the existing spray in an effort to increase anti-bacterial properties and to perform a series of tests to determine the stability of the spray, including its efficacy after washing a garment/hospital gown once sprayed.\n\nThis second collaboration, led by Professor Barkev Keoshkerian and Professor Frank Merante, and two students from Seneca’s Biotechnology – Advanced diploma program, who sought to screen and optimize the particles with bioactive compounds so that they withstand the “worst-case scenario” by spiking the spray with a high concentration of bacterial cultures and testing for reproducibility; and for the ability to maintain its antimicrobial properties after washing. The specific technology adoption for this project was the nano-particle creation. The small particles and assessment of their efficacy to keep a surface free and protected from harmful microbes for a long period of time were the primary outcomes of interest.\n\nCosmetics redesigned for eyes that will not exacerbate ocular surface disease Ontario Centre of Innovation (OCI) – College Strategic Sector/Cluster/Technology Platform (CSSCTP) 2019 Quenchology Cosmetics Inc. is a Canadian based cosmetics company that redesigns cosmetics with ocular surface health at the forefront.
