        "text": "Explaining the deficit\n\nDespite notable socio-economic development in the Arab region, a deficit in democracy and political rights has continued to prevail. This book examines the major reasons underlying the persistence of this democracy deficit over the past decades and touches on the prospect for deepening the process of democratization in the Arab world.\n\nContributions from major scholars of the region give a cross-country analysis of economic development, political institutions and social factors, and the impact of oil wealth and regional wars, and present a model for democracy in the Arab world. Case studies are drawn from Algeria, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Sudan and the Gulf region; they build on these cross-country analyses and look beyond the influence of oil and conflicts as the major reason behind this democracy deficit. The chapters illustrate how specific socio-political history of the country concerned, fear of fundamentalist groups, collusion with foreign powers and foreign interventions, and the co-option of the elites by the state also contribute to these problems of democratization facing the region.\n\nSituating the democratic position of the Arab world in a global context, this book is an important contribution to the field of Middle Eastern politics, development studies and studies on conflict and democracy.\n\nIbrahim Elbadawi, formerly Lead Economist at the Development Research Group of the World Bank, he is currently Director of the Macroeconomics Research and Forecasting Department at the Dubai Economic Council and has published widely on macroeconomic and development policy and the economics of civil war.

Unlike other studies that deal with democratization, the book zeroes in on the major drivers behind the democracy deficit in various Arab countries and offers a complex set of analytical explanations. Eschewing simplistic dichotomies and culturalist dogma, Democracy in the Arab World diagnoses the critical role of conflicts and oil, but also reveals the influence of political leadership, foreign interventions and the cooption of elites, in inhibiting the democratic process in the region despite its notable socio-economic development. Another major strength of the book is that it bridges the gap between theory and history. An impressive list of researchers and scholars of the region!”\n\nFawaz A.

Our deep gratitude goes to a number of institutions and individuals who have supported, advised and encouraged this project.\n\nA generous grant from the International Development Research Centre (IDRC, Canada) made it possible to assemble a first-class research team to undertake the often arduous research work this project has entailed. Emma Naughton of IDRC has been greatly supportive of the research project from its inception and to her we extend our sincere appreciation.\n\nThe Institute of Financial Economics (IFE) at the American University Beirut (AUB) where the project was housed was an ideal place from which to direct the project. We owe special gratitude to the IFE, which provided excellent secretarial and research assistance in an intellectually congenial environment. We also would like to acknowledge the support of the AUB administration and in particular Khalil Bitar, the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, who always stood ready to facilitate the administrative requirements of the project. Our thanks also go to the Office of Grants and Contracts, which provided very helpful administrative support. The Development Research Group of the World Bank has provided generous support, including the time of Ibrahim Elbadawi. In particular, we would like to thank Luis Serven, Manager of the Macroeconomic and Growth Division for his support, and Gary Milante for his substantive and technical contributions to the project.\n\nWe would like to express our great appreciation to several institutions that hosted meetings on the project’s research work. AUB hosted a workshop pertaining to the preliminary findings of the research team as well as a dissemination conference to present the project’s final results. The Economic Research Forum for the Arab Countries, Iran and Turkey (Cairo) organized a panel on the preliminary findings of the cross-country work; the Dubai School of Government hosted a workshop on the research methodologies of the various papers; and the Center for the Study of Democracy at the University of Westminster in London organized a session to present the findings of the project. Furthermore, both the IFE and the Center for Public Policy Research and Dialogue in Amman organized workshops on the Lebanon and Jordan case studies, respectively. All these meetings provided valuable feedback and insights that helped improve the ongoing research.\n\nIt was gratifying to work with our colleagues on the research team. Their unflinching collaboration and engagement in the research work for a period of over two years greatly facilitated our task as co-managers and editors. We hope that as a team our joint aspirations to fulfil the objectives of the research project have been realized. Our sincere thanks go to Kristine Stroad Moore for her capable technical editing of the manuscript.\n\nSamir Makdisi would like to acknowledge his great debt to his wife Jean for her support and patience in putting up with the various demands that the work on the project entailed. Equally importantly, he benefited greatly from her penetrating intellect and, whenever called upon, her enriching of the written text. His three scholar sons, Saree, Ussama and Karim, often provided critical intellectual engagements that helped him focus more sharply on particular issues being addressed. He would also like to extend special thanks to Rima Shaar, secretary of the IFE, for first-rate secretarial support, and to acknowledge the research help of graduate research assistants at the IFE who have efficiently carried out the tasks assigned to them: Moon Baz, Sandra Chaoul, Hanan al Fakih and especially Layal Wehbeh who, for two years, assisted in the research project.\n\nIbrahim Elbadawi would like to acknowledge the support and patience of his wife Enayat and the stimulating discussions with his daughter Lina. He would also like to thank his assistant Tourya Tourougui for her superb secretarial support.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIbrahim Elbadawi and Samir Makdisi\n\nWhen the Arab countries were still under colonial tutelage, the burning question for them was how and when to gain independence. Most of them in fact became independent only after the Second World War,1 and democracy did not arise as a political issue except as a potential post-independence question. However, with the exception of Lebanon and early isolated cases of democratic engagement that did not last long, Arab political regimes since independence have generally been characterized by varying forms of authoritarian rule, despite notable growth in the levels of real per capita income and levels of education.\n\nIntermittent attempts at political reform might over time have permitted limited political liberalization, but the essential nature of authoritarian rule has not changed materially. Indeed, throughout this period Arab intellectuals and groups advocating substantive political reform have condemned authoritarianism and the absence of democracy in the Arab world. Denial of full political rights of citizens and restrictions on civil liberties and, hence, lack of representative and accountable governments, are also blamed for the failure of Arab regimes to achieve sustainable and equitable economic and social development, or to address the major issues presently faced by the Arab world, including, among others, the Palestinian question.\n\nThe primary objective of this book is to address the following important questions: why has the Arab region generally experienced what has been termed a ‘democracy deficit’ (however democracy is defined, a matter we take up below), and what explains the general persistence of this deficit over the decades since independence? A secondary objective is to discern the growth and development consequences of autocracy.\n\nTo identify the factors that explain the continuation of the Arab democracy deficit, a two-tier research approach was adopted that combines both quantitative and qualitative analyses: cross-country work followed by intensive country case studies. The cross-country work is an extended modernity regression model of democracy (measured by the widely used Polity IV index) for a global sample covering most Arab countries. It is preceded by an analysis of the crisis of Arab democracy, which draws a political framework for the penchant of Arab autocratic regimes to hold on to their rule.\n\nThe model finds that after controlling for a host of economic, social and historical variables, as well as for religion, a negative and highly significant Arab region-specific effect remains, that we refer to as the Arab dummy. This finding suggests that, given the level of economic development of the Arab world, as well as other historical and social characteristics, even an extended theory of modernization (in the sense of the Lipset hypothesis of 1959) fails to explain the persistent nature of the Arab democracy/freedom deficit, and stands in contrast to the experience of countries in other regions of the world where economic development has been positively correlated with the democratization process. What we do find is that oil and, more importantly, regional conflicts (notably the Arab–Israeli conflict, but also other civil and international wars) seem to be the major factors that account for this negative Arab dummy.\n\nThe most striking result of the analysis of cross-country work is that once it is interacted with the conflict variable, the direct Arab dummy effect not only disappears, but its interaction effect is negative and highly significant, while the same effect is positive and significant for other developing regions. This finding does not carry over to other determinants of democracy (e.g. oil or female labour force participation), where interactions with the Arab and other dummies were neither significant nor do they influence the direct region-specific effect. These results remain robust against a variety of diagnostic tests.\n\nThe above findings suggest two important conclusions. First, unlike conflict, both oil and gender2 – like other determinants of democracy – had an impact that does not vary across regions. Second, however, the Arab world isdifferent with regard to the impact of conflicts on democracy; while conflicts have led, for whatever reasons, to a subsequent democratization process in other regions, in the Arab world they have not. Thus, drawing from the robust and persistent findings of the econometric analysis, the central premise of this work is that oil and conflicts are the two major overarching factors behind the persistence of the gaping democracy deficit in the Arab world. At the same time, it probes beyond the generality of cross-country work by focusing on selected Arab countries in an attempt to identify country-specific factors that could provide supplementary explanations for the survival of their autocracies.\n\nThus, with the cross-country model as a starting point, the following eight case studies, carried out by teams of economists and political scientists, were selected for in-depth analyses of the factors that account for their persistent, though varying, democracy deficits: Algeria, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Sudan, Syria and the Gulf region. Their choice was governed by one or a combination of the following three criteria: that they be: (1) major countries in the region and/or important oil producers, (2) countries involved in the Arab–Israeli conflict and/or have experienced civil wars, and (3) be highly polarized or fractionalized countries.\n\nThe case studies critically assess how oil and conflict have influenced, directly and/or indirectly, the evolution of democracy in the countries concerned. Equally importantly they analyse country-specific factors (historical, political, economic and institutional) that further explain the persistence of the democracy deficit – factors that are not necessarily captured by the global model, thereby shedding additional light on why autocracy has tended to survive in the Arab world. These idiosyncratic country-specific factors were found to be critical in shaping the dynamics of the influence of oil and conflict in blunting and pre-empting democracy in these countries and thus help explain the observed diversity across these countries in terms of the extent and stability of autocracy. What is noteworthy is that religion as such (Islam, of course, being the major religion of the Arab world) does not appear to play a significant role.\n\nThere have been a number of studies, both inside and outside the Arab world, on the characteristics of contemporary Arab societies and how they relate to the nature of prevailing undemocratic Arab regimes. Gender inequality (whose multifaceted aspects have been addressed by a vast and growing feminist literature), familial, patron–client or tribal relationships, and, in some cases, religion, have been put forward as explaining the intrinsically non-democratic nature of Arab societies. In this vein, culturalist approaches in particular, have been advanced as alternative explanations of the persisting Arab autocracy.3\n\nHowever, as Chapter 1 argues, major scholarly work has put aside social preconditions or the region’s cultural aversion for democracy as being responsible for the turbulent and undemocratic politics of the region. Culturalist approaches that make too many assumptions about the universal acceptance, uniform exposure and internalization of particular views are not supported by historical evidence. This conceptual analytical perspective strongly coheres with our own cross-country empirical work in Chapter 2. We find that while the ratio of female labour force participation is positively and significantly associated with democracy, unlike oil and conflict, it does not, however, explain the direct Arab dummy effect. Moreover, unlike conflicts, the gender effect is uniform across all regions, suggesting that the Arab world is not different from other regions with regard to the potential impact of the empowerment of women on democracy. Similar findings have also been found in the empirical literature, with an even more robust set of gender indicators. For example, based on their extensive empirical cross-country analysis, Donno and Russett (2004: 601) conclude that, ‘Overall, it does not seem either that Islam or Arab countries are autocratic because they oppress women’s rights or that Islamic or Arab countries oppress women simply because their governments are autocratic.’\n\nIndeed, other societies in the developing world have similar social characteristics to those attributed to the Arab region, yet they still made the transition to democracy. Thus, whatever the explanation for this transition in some societies, and for its absence in the Arab world, the persistence of the Arab democracy deficit has remained a question that we felt needed to be critically addressed, and was at the heart of this research, while the causes and nature of the transition from autocracy to democracy lay outside its purview.4\n\nIn undertaking the task of explaining why the democratic process has failed to take root, we have been cognizant not only that notions and meaning of democracy have been explained in various ways, but that its empirical measurement suffers from certain limitations. There is perhaps broad agreement (as noted in Chapter 1) that the concept of democracy encompasses a political system in which members regard themselves as political equals, collectively sovereign and possessing all the capacities, resources and institutions they need to govern themselves. Democratic regimes become consolidated (i.e. no significant political group attempts to overthrow them) when, among other things, the state becomes authoritative, civil society is active and the political and economic institutions that guard democratic values are well established.\n\nWhereas liberalism and democracy are distinct concepts, they have tended to converge. Contemporary democratic regimes are generally liberal ones, though in a few cases non-liberal fundamentalist or other parties have come to power via free elections. This phenomenon poses an interesting challenge to the prospects of the continued congruence between liberalism and democracy, mainly (but not solely) in developing countries, where fundamentalist movements are potentially strong and could assume the reins of power democratically. Whatever these prospects, fear of such movements is not an argument at all, though some writers have propagated it to promote the perpetuation of autocratic regimes. Instead, greater civic and political rights across the board should be promoted, and, in the Arab region, it is imperative that outstanding regional conflicts, primarily the Palestinian question, be justly resolved.\n\nIn our view the root causes for the growth of fundamentalism in the region may be traced to three interacting factors: the unwillingness of the Arab governing classes to democratize, fearing loss of domestic control and privileges; the persistently strong Western support of Israel’s position not to recognize legitimate Palestinian rights; and Western support of Arab autocracies in the belief that this support would protect the West’s oil and other regional interests. Meeting the challenges posed by these interlocking factors would, among other things, greatly help in promoting the cause of democracy in the Arab world.\n\nIt is particularly important to distinguish between formal/procedural and consolidated/substantive democracy. In the former case a polity may demonstrate the trappings of democracy – including elections, ideologically diverse political parties and the appearance of political participation, to name a few indicators – but may not possess a political culture in which citizens evince loyalty to a set of democratic rules of the game, to the idea of an autonomous civil society and to notions of individual social and political rights, including gender equality, as would be the case in a substantive or mature democracy. In the Arab region this distinction is important. A number of Arab political regimes have the trappings of a democratic system, i.e. they create nominally democratic institutions with the objective of stabilizing their regimes, but remain essentially autocratic (for empirical analysis of this question see Gandhi and Przeworski, 2007).\n\nThe gap between a theoretical understanding of a democracy and its actual implementation is often wide, especially in developing countries. But even among the so-called mature democracies there are distinct differences in this regard. For example, the influence of corporate capital on the democratic process, including control of the media, is much stronger in certain Western countries than in others; or the degree of social equity and the quality of social coverage (pertaining to the social rights of citizens), as well as of civil liberties and political participation, may differ markedly from one country to another. Such differences, it might be argued, render some of these countries more democratic than others (see Economist Intelligence Unit, 2007). In other words, empirical measurements of democracy that attempt to capture its basic features – such as political competition, participation, and civil liberties – do not necessarily succeed in fully reflecting the true democratic status in any given country; this is debatably more true in developing than in developed countries. In part this may be attributable to methodological flaws of the measurements, but could also be attributed to their coding rules, which do not always capture accurately the abuses of the governing classes and/or of special interest groups.\n\nEqually importantly, any measure of democracy must fully recognize the universal right to political participation as reflected, for example, in universal suffrage. The Polity IV index (and other indices, with one or two exceptions) does not account explicitly for female suffrage. To that extent it suffers from an inadequate assessment of the democracy status of any given country in the period prior to the enactment of the right of women to participate in national or even municipal elections. This problem is of greater relevance for measures that attempt to identify transitions to democracy than measures concerned with the level of democracy at any particular point in time, as in the case of Polity IV, especially as they focus on recent periods that witnessed a growing extension of female suffrage across countries.5\n\nSuffrage is, of course, part of the wider issue of gender equality that Polity IV and other indices of democracy do not explicitly recognize. In many countries the struggle for women’s rights has led to a higher level of gender equality accompanied by wider female participation in various domains, including the political and economic domains. Such gains reflect the recognition that a real democracy implies gender equality as well as equal opportunities for all segments of society.6\n\nImportant as they are, the above limitations of Polity IV do not bear significantly on the polity analysis of the case studies included in this volume, particularly as the analysis focuses on explaining the persistence of their autocratic regimes and not on any transition from a state of autocracy to a state of democracy. Lebanon is an exception in that from the beginning of independence it has had its own special form of (constrained) democracy.\n\nRegarding universal suffrage, in six of the case studies (Algeria, Egypt, Iraq, Lebanon, Syria and Sudan) women’s suffrage was introduced prior to the period of the study that begins in 1960 or shortly afterwards. Jordan introduced the right of women to vote in 1974. The Gulf region, with the exception of Bahrain and Kuwait, has yet to introduce female suffrage. The former introduced it in 2002 and the latter in 2005. The remaining Arab countries, not included in this volume, introduced female suffrage before 1965.\n\nAs for the wider question of gender equality, the pace of its implementation in the Arab world, under the influence of women’s movements and international pressure including international agreements such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), has varied from one Arab country to another. In all of them however, various forms and degrees of gender discrimination continue to exist, giving an additional signal of the non-democratic nature of political regimes in place.\n\nWhat matters for our purposes is that for all the countries in this volume the persistence of autocracies goes beyond the question of universal suffrage or gender equality in general. Those states that introduced female suffrage early on have remained non-democratic despite subsequent limited political reforms. And for the few that followed suit later on, the granting of women’s right to participate in the political process, a positive step on its own, did not change the basic nature of the political regime in place. This assessment remains valid even after we account for other measures that might have been introduced to reduce gender inequality. With or without greater gender equality, as we note below, the Arab countries (with the exception of Lebanon) remain autocratic and the question of explaining the persistent Arab democracy deficit remains to be addressed.\n\nThus, while we have relied on a widely used empirical measure of democracy, i.e. the Polity IV index, in both the cross-country work and the individual case studies, we have, with the above in mind, been fully cognizant of some of its limitations both on methodological and definitional grounds. Perhaps, as pointed out by some researchers, one main empirical limitation of this index (along with alternative indices of measurement) is the applied aggregation rule: no justification is provided for the weighting schemes of the index attributes, which may lead to potential double counting.7\n\nOn the other hand, Polity IV possesses a number of positive attributes (e.g. clear and detailed coding rules), and whatever its flaws its wide use by researches renders it useful for comparative empirical assessments of the democracy status of different countries and regions. Furthermore, it appears to cohere with other indices of democracy (e.g. Van Hannen’s and the more subjective Freedom House) in terms of the cross-regional comparisons and the dynamic behaviour over time. Indeed, the fundamental results regarding the role of oil and conflicts as the two major factors behind the Arab democracy deficit were robustly corroborated when the democracy model was tested using the Freedom House and Van Hannen’s indices as dependent variables (Chapter 2). This enhances its validity though it does not necessarily establish its total reliability.8 In any case, measures of democracy can and should be supplemented by additional investigations and, where necessary, their assessment should be modified accordingly.\n\nNow, while the Polity IV rankings of Arab countries may not always have accurately reflected their evolving political situation, in general they have not been far off the mark in assessing the status of democracy in the Arab region.9 In Chapter 2 we note that Arab autocracies have persisted in relying on various forms of oppression, including legitimacy by default, the engineering of crisis politics, and, more recently, the pretext of containing fundamentalist movements. There is plenty of evidence that the political and civic rights record in Arab countries has been marred by serious violations, attested to by various reports of Arab and international human rights organizations. All this lends support to the empirical assessment that, excepting one case (Lebanon), various shades of autocracy have prevailed in these countries since independence. The limited political liberalization that some of them undertook at various times does not materially change this picture. Indeed, the case studies clearly point out how political regimes and practices reflect various forms of autocratic behaviour, the intensity of which could change from one period to another depending upon circumstances. The obstacles to the strengthening of democratization in the Arab region are yet to be overcome.\n\nOver the course of the project, three workshops were held during which the research teams discussed the progress of their work and critiqued the methodologies employed. These proved to be extremely beneficial. They allowed for a constructive and enriching exchange of views among the participants in the project. Mutual feedback helped shape the final drafts of the studies. Toward the end of the project a dissemination conference was organized to present the findings of the cross-country and case studies to academics and civil society organizations, among others. Their feedback provided many helpful insights. In addition, a few separate individual country workshops were also organized to engage experts in the research findings of the case studies concerned. All these engagements were greatly advantageous to the progress of the research being undertaken. They allowed for a critical discourse of research methodologies and findings that could only serve to improve the ultimate outcome of the research project.\n\nThe volume is divided into three parts. Part I, on conceptual and cross-country work, sets the framework of the analysis. Part II, the main part, includes the case studies, which are divided into three groups: the Mashreq countries, the oil-dependent countries and the Nile Valley countries. Part III is an interpretive synthesis summing up the question of democracy in the Arab world.\n\nNotes\n\n1 They had been governed by the Ottomans since 1516/17, and by the British and French following the First World War and the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. Indeed, Egypt and the rest of North Africa had effectively been lost to Ottoman rule many decades before the First World War.\n\n2 Admittedly, due to data limitation, we could only account for the gender question through the share of females in the labour force, which is only one aspect of women’s empowerment.\n\n3 See e.g. Al-Naqib (1996a, 1996b); Kedourie (1994); Sharabi (1988). According to Sharabi, patriarchy is a deep-seated characteristic of Arab societies that has survived through the ages and managed to adapt itself to modernity by transposing the acquired dependency relations vis-à-vis imperialist powers into the enduring features of the old patriarchy, hence becoming ‘neopatriarchy’.\n\n4 The extent to which current theories of transition to democracy that are based on the historical experience of the Western countries are useful in identifying the path from autocracy to democracy in the Arab world is an issue that will need to be carefully examined.\n\n5 For a critical evaluation of this question see Paxton, 2000.\n\n6 For whatever it might imply, the regression model of Ch. 2 indicates the positive impact on democratization of the growing share of the female labour force.\n\n7 For a critical evaluation of alternative empirical measures of democracy, see Munck and Verkuilen, 2002.\n\n8 Furthermore, some researchers have referred to data-induced measurement errors (Bowman et al., 2005) which could reduce the validity of the long-term cross-national scales of democracy, and other researchers to the non-interchangeability of the various indices of democracy (Liu, 2003–4; Casper and Tufis, 2003) which reduce their reliability.\n\n9 For some of the case studies, their authors judged that the assigned Polity IV country scores did not always reflect appropriately the evolving political situation and relied instead on their own modified polity scores.\n\nReferences\n\nAl-Naqib, K.

The United States military took over the deserted building, gave it a thorough face lift, with ‘the floors tiled, cells cleaned and repaired, and toilets, showers, and a new medical center added’ (Hersh, 2004a). Then they proceeded to do exactly what the Saddam regime had done there before, only this time they took pictures to amuse themselves.\n\nIn the heated controversy that followed, the US authorities and mainstream media argued that the torture at Abu Ghraib was an aberration, the responsibility of only a ‘handful of rogue elements’ in the US military. However, many analysts argued that the abuses reflected the erosion of democratic and human rights standards in the post-9/11 era, and were linked to the overall US policies in Iraq, Afghanistan and Guantanamo, involving the widespread use of torture on terror suspects (Hersh, 2004b). Some even compared the process to the creeping Nazification of Germany in the 1930s (Rajiva, 2005).\n\nOther observers compared this latest Western incursion into the Arab world to the first: that of Napoleon Bonaparte in 1898. That one also used the pretext of bringing ‘liberty’ to the Arabs, and ended equally disastrously. Two prominent US historians (Richard Bulliet of Columbia University and Juan Cole of the Global Americana Institute) made the comparison almost simultaneously in August 2007. Napoleon had ‘proclaimed his intention of liberating the Egyptians from their Mamluk oppressors. And he brought an army of scholars and advisers with him to make the occupation of Egypt a model of European benevolence’ (Bulliet, 2007). Both leaders displayed a ‘tendency to believe their own propaganda (or at least to keep repeating it long after it became completely implausible).\n\nBoth leaders invaded and occupied a major Arabic-speaking Muslim country; both harbored dreams of a ‘Greater Middle East’; both were surprised to find themselves enmeshed in long, bitter, debilitating guerrilla wars. Neither genuinely cared about grassroots democracy, but both found its symbols easy to invoke for gullible domestic publics. Substantial numbers of their new subjects quickly saw, however, that they faced occupations, not liberations.\n\n(Cole, 2007)\n\nNapoleon’s promise of liberation soon confronted the locals as ‘an avalanche of bothersome regulations’ and predatory practices aimed at raising revenue for the invaders (Flower, 1972: 48). When the people could take it no more and revolted, the advocates of liberty used the most brutal of tactics, including resorting to indiscriminate shelling of Cairo and even the mosque. Every rule in the book was broken, and all pretence of promoting liberty or respecting Islam was dropped. Al-Azhar was occupied and desecrated.\n\nHorses were tethered to the Kiblah, furniture was hurled around and the Koran kicked about the floor. El Djabarty, aghast, saw soldiers spit on the carpets, urinate on the walls, and litter the mosque with broken wine bottles … Heavy fines were imposed all round, and ten Sheikhs believed to have been implicated were stripped naked and shot in the Citadel.\n\n(Flower, 1972: 50)\n\nSound familiar? It could be Fallujah 2004, Hebron 1986, Hama 1982, or Halabja 1987.\n\n1. Democracy, liberalism, occupation\n\nThis convergence of regime conduct across times and cultures should cast a sharp light on some of the unspoken assumptions that underpin much of the current discussions on democracy and democratization. One could cite numerous other examples, from the way the British conducted themselves in the face of the 1857 rebellion in India, through the French atrocities in Algeria, to Israel’s behaviour today, to highlight aspects of this phenomenon, which I would like to call the ‘Napoleon–Saddam Syndrome’. It is a condition that seems to infect rulers and other political actors in the region, regardless of their cultural background or origin, and suck them into a spiral of abuses, oppression, mounting resistance and more repression, leading to eventual collapse.\n\nAn inkling of the nature of this pathology can be found in remarks made by Israeli leaders who, in their attempt to defend Israeli’s aggressive and often brutal behaviour towards the Palestinians by claiming that the Middle East is a brutal area where only the language of violence is understood, betray a sense of siege and isolation (Barak, 1999). The resulting paranoia is self-reinforcing; the actor who feels threatened by everyone around him acts in a manner that further alienates people and confirms his fears. Ironically, this paranoia is also shared by entrenched and increasingly beleaguered Arab regimes, and the excuses are comparable. When challenged about the horrendous abuses they engage in, Israeli officials often use the refrain: ‘This is not Switzerland, you know.’ Arab despots respond to mild suggestions that they moderate their abuses of human rights by quipping: ‘If I were to do what you ask, the fundamentalists would take over … Is that what you want?’ This invariably silences the interlocutor, who quickly changes the subject (Zakaria, 2001).\n\nMany theoreticians tend to follow the autocrats in emphasizing the role of the ‘environment,’ usually delineated in cultural terms. For example, Flower argues that Napoleon’s problem was that his slogans about the ‘rights of man’ had little resonance with ‘the inward-looking Egyptians’ (Flower, 1972: 47), before giving a catalogue of the endless oppressive measures introduced by Napoleon under these slogans. This blaming of the victims suggests that it is not just Napoleon and Bush who tend to believe their own propaganda, but that many analysts do so as well. For the Egyptians did not rebel against the ‘rights of man’, but against unbearable oppression by an alien and insensitive power which ruled by force of arms.\n\nTo start, we can draw one logical conclusion from the encounters just mentioned: that the amount of repression needed to sustain a regime is proportional to the depth and breadth of rejection it faces from the people. That the US occupation forces in Iraq are having to use similar techniques of repression to the Ba’athist regime they displaced is a sign that they are facing comparable resistance from Iraqis. By definition, democracy should not face popular resistance, since democracy is rule by the people, which cannot be in revolt against itself. So if a certain order provokes a fierce resistance, that order is, by definition, not a democracy.\n\nWhile there are many disagreements about defining democracy, David Beetham is right to argue that:\n\nDisputes about the meaning of democracy which purport to be conceptual disagreements are really disputes about how much democracy is either desirable or practicable; that is, about where the trade-off should come between democratic and other values.\n\n(Beetham, 1993: 55)\n\nFor Beetham, democracy can be defined as:\n\nA mode of decision-making about collectively binding rules and policies over which the people exercise control, and the most democratic arrangement to be where all members of the collectivity enjoy effective equal rights to take part in such decision-making directly – one, that is to say, which realizes to the greatest conceivable degree the principle of popular control and equality in its exercise. Democracy should properly be conceptualized as lying at one end of a spectrum, the other end of which is a system of rule where the people are totally excluded from the decision-making process and any control over it.\n\n(Beetham, 1993: 55)\n\nThere is a broad agreement on this conception of democracy as a political system ‘in which the members regard themselves as political equals, as collectively sovereign, and possess all capacities, resources and institutions they need in order to govern themselves’ (Dahl, 1989: 1). The theoretical disputes, as Beetham points out, revolve around rival and contestable claims as to how much democracy can be realized in a sustainable form. This is an important consideration since democracy has been ‘a remarkably difficult form of government to create and sustain’ (Held, 1993: 13).\n\nSustainability, or ‘consolidation’, is a key concern for theoreticians of democratic transitions, and is said to occur when democracy becomes ‘the only game in town’, i.e. ‘when no significant political group seriously attempts to overthrow the democratic regime or to promote domestic or international violence in order to secede from the state’ (Linz and Stepan, 1998: 49). One could argue that this requirement is too stringent, since it could imply that today’s Spain or Britain during the IRA insurgency are not consolidated democracies. However, the general idea is that a democracy can be considered consolidated when such activities do not pose a serious threat to its stability. Linz and Stepan stipulate six conditions needed for a democracy to be consolidated: an authoritative state, a lively civil society, an autonomous political society, the prevalence of the rule of law, an effective state bureaucracy and an institutionalized economic society (Linz and Stepan, 1998: 51–8).\n\nHowever, modern democracy has another dimension to it. As Bernard Crick puts it, what is usually meant by democracy today is ‘a fusion (but quite often a confusion) of the idea of power of the people and the idea of legally guaranteed individual rights’ (Crick, 1998: 257). More often described as ‘liberal representative democracy’ (Held, 1993: 18–20), to distinguish it from ancient direct democracies (like those of Athens) or from other forms that do not respect individual liberties, modern democracies are also referred to as ‘constitutional democracies’. Liberal constitutionalism seeks to limit the powers of the state through guarantees of individual rights and private property. Liberalism (‘a doctrine devoted to protecting the rights of the individual to life, liberty, property, and the pursuit of happiness’: Plattner, 1999: 121) could and did exist without democracy, while constitutionalism could be, and has been, used to curb democracy. The designers of the American constitution in particular had used complex constitutional curbs on democratic rights (indirect elections of the president and senate, special role for the Supreme Court, etc.) in order to guard against the ‘tyranny of the majority’ as much as to guard against the tyranny of the few (Blondel, 1998: 74).\n\nGiven that liberalism contains principles that ‘have been profoundly hostile to democracy’, the evolution of modern democracy has been the ‘history of successive struggles between liberals and various types of democrat over the extent and form of democratization’ (Beetham, 1993: 58). In spite of this, the convergence was seen as inevitable, since liberalism’s values of liberty and rights cannot long survive the denial of equal rights for all (Plattner, 1999: 122). In fact, attempts made to abolish some of the liberal features of modern democracies ‘in the name of a more perfect democracy have only succeeded in undermining the democracy in whose name [these rights] were attacked’ (Beetham, 1993: 57). To a large extent then, modern democracy can be seen as having been ‘conceptualized and structured within the limits of liberalism’ (Parekh, 1995: 165).\n\nHowever, and of central relevance to our current investigation, the consciousness of the distinction and tension between liberalism and democracy has led to another startling conclusion. Taking as its premise the same point made above (that democracy and liberalism have become inseparable), some analysts have argued that in cases where democracy could lead to illiberal regimes (as was the case in the former Yugoslavia or some Arab and Muslim countries where Islamists could come to power), it might not be wise to promote democracy. Instead, some form of authoritarian liberalism should be championed (Miller, 1993; Zakaria, 1997; Plattner, 1999). From this perspective, it could be seen that what Napoleon and George W. Bush were trying to promote in the Arab world was not really democracy, but some form of authoritarian liberalism (cf. Cole, 2007). The claim that Arab culture is hostile to democracy has thus been reinterpreted to argue that Arabs are in fact hostile to liberalism.\n\n2. The basics of ‘culture talk’\n\nThe appeal to culture as an explanatory variable determinant of social and political change, most recently publicized by Huntington’s ‘Clash of Civilizations’ thesis, has a long pedigree, stretching back to Max Weber’s famous citing of the ‘Protestant Ethic’ as the driving force behind modern capitalism (Wedeen, 2002: 713). Other theorists trace the genealogy back to de Tocqueville and even to Aristotle (Diamond, 1994: 10). The political culture approach has in recent years been eclipsed by rival approaches, after a brief ascendancy in the first half of the last century (Almond, 1994: pp. x–xi; Diamond, 1994: 1). Proponents of this approach stake the claim ‘that we can identify distinctive and relatively stable distributions of political values, beliefs and understandings among populations’ that can act as independent explanatory variables for political behaviour (Diamond, 1994: 1). In this regard, certain cultural attributes can cause democracy to flourish, including a level of individualism, moderation, pragmatism and mutual trust among the elite, coupled with an ‘intelligent mistrust of leadership’ (Diamond, 1994: 12). Central also is a solid commitment to the democratic process by all actors as stipulated above.\n\nThis overriding commitment to democratic proceduralism is a critical political cultural condition for democracy. In combination with policy pragmatism and political tolerance, it promotes moderate partisanship, and these qualities together are most likely to limit the politicization of social life and the rancor of political intercourse.\n\n(Diamond, 1994: 11)\n\nIt is of course a truism to say that the culture of a society determines how individuals and groups conduct themselves publicly, especially if political culture is defined as ‘a people’s predominant beliefs, attitudes, values, ideals, sentiments, and evaluations about the political system of its country, and the role of the self in that system’ (Diamond, 1994: 7). For if one includes evaluation of the political system in the definition of political culture, then the assertion about the influence of culture becomes a tautology. Nevertheless, attempts to identify causal links between political development and existing identifiable cultural traits in given societies face a number of problems. This is especially so when we add the assumptions that the components of this culture are widely shared, at least within the elite, and ‘represent coherent patterns which fit together and are mutually reinforcing’, and must also be constant over time and fairly resistant to change (Diamond, 1994: 8–9).\n\nIn view of numerous challenges to these assumptions, the recent revival of the political culture approach thus stakes only modest claims, rejecting outright the determinist version on theoretical and empirical grounds, since masses of evidence from field research and surveys continue to reveal that the causal relationship between culture and political behaviour is a two-way process, and political culture is seen as ‘fairly plastic’. Determinism is rejected also on normative grounds, because belief in the rigidity of culture and a one-way causal relationship would condemn whole societies to perpetual lack of democracy (Diamond, 1994: 9–10). In addition, proponents of this modified political culture approach want to look at culture in terms of ‘geological strata of history’, where competing layers of cultural tradition coexist, and where the latest dominant traits have not completely eclipsed or supplanted earlier legacies (Diamond, 1994: 230–1). Put differently, this approach calls for a further dilution of the initial thesis by advising analysts to ‘disaggregate political culture: look at subcultures (vertical and horizontal); look at elite cultures and mass culture’ (Hudson, 1995: 73). Also, to understand political culture ‘as a multi-layered phenomenon, amenable therefore to “geological” study: look at formal ideologies (on the “surface”), then at opinions (easily changeable), then at attitudes (less so), and finally try to plumb the deep structure of enduring collective values and orientations’ (Hudson, 1995: 73).\n\nThese multiple qualifications look like the prudent preparation of multiple escape routes. But critics continue to reject these claims as ‘either fundamentally tautological or empirically invalid’ (Wedeen, 2002: 713). In any case, recent empirical studies on democratic transition ‘explicitly dismiss the importance for transition of the prior consensus on democratic values’, emphasizing instead splits within authoritarian regimes and the subsequent calculation by one faction ‘that its interests are best served (or risks best minimized) by liberalization’ (Diamond, 1994: 4–5). Acceptance of democratic norms evolves at a later stage, as a consequence of the compromises reached and the deals struck between former enemies. In a sense, it can be said that, apart from the elite commitment to democratic procedures (which may be initially instrumental and expedient) there may not be any specific preconditions for democracy. Moreover, many of the requirements postulated as preconditions for democracy may, in fact, be outcomes of democracy (Diamond, 1994: 15).\n\nAny viable appeal to cultural explanations must take account of this interactive aspect of culture. While cultural norms and identities of necessity condition reactions to political challenges, political realities also condition culture. Culture as a process of meaning construction ‘implies a social process through which people reproduce together the conditions of intelligibility that enable them to make sense of their worlds’ (Wedeen, 2002: 717). The way, for example, ethnic identification evolves and shifts (even within similar groups) depends on many contextual factors as well as conscious choices (Wedeen, 2002: 724–5).\n\n3. On arab political culture and the ‘missing bourgeoisie’\n\nThe political culture approach has been at its most problematic when applied in the Arab-Muslim context of ‘Culture Talk’, a discourse which ‘assumes that every culture has a tangible essence that defines it, and … then explains politics as a consequence of that essence’ (Mamdani, 2005). This discourse comes in two main versions.\n\nOne thinks of premodern peoples as those who are not yet modern, who are either lagging behind or have yet to embark on the road to modernity. The other depicts the premodern as also the antimodern. Whereas the former conception encourages relations based on philanthropy, the latter notion is productive of fear and preemptive police or military action.\n\n(Mamdani, 2005: 18)\n\nBoth versions, however, look at culture, especially Muslim culture, as having ‘no history, no politics, and no debates’. In both, ‘history seems to have petrified into a lifeless custom of an antique people who inhabit antique lands’ (Mamdani, 2005). This position has a political purpose. The message it seeks to send when it argues that the clash of Western powers with Arabs and Muslims is a clash of civilizations rather than a genuine political conflict (Lewis, 1990; Huntington, 1993), is that these people are not worthy of political engagement. Even if the alleged grievances are addressed (and here is a long list that starts with Palestine and does not end there) then these ‘barbarians’ would still remain hostile to the West. These arguments are additionally suspicious when they are promoted by experts known for their right-wing views and sympathies for Israel.\n\nIn some of its more recent recastings, the slightly more sophisticated thesis defines the problem in terms of a fundamental contrast between the world of jihad and the McWorld. The anti-modern world of ‘jihad’ (‘the ancient forces of culture, geography, tradition, and community’: Farazmand and Pinkowski, 2006: 70) and the commercialized ‘McWorld’ of high-tech consumerism and globalized pursuit of profit, may be antagonistic, but they are also interconnected. McWorld represents ‘the natural culmination of a modernization process–some would call it Westernization – that has gone on since the Renaissance birth of modern science and its dominant paradigm of knowledge construed as power’ (Barber, 2003: 156). It embodies the Enlightenment’s ‘trust in reason, its passion for liberty, and (not unrelated to that passion) its fascination with control’ (Barber, 2003: 156). Jihad, by contrast, stands for forces of ‘dogmatic and violent particularism’ which seek to ‘defend and deny, reject and repel modernity wherever they find it’ (Barber, 2003: 7, 11). Needless to say, McWorld predominates in the modernized West, symbolized by America. ‘Its template is American, its form style … It is about culture as a commodity, apparel as ideology’ (Barber, 2003: 17). Jihad, by contrast, is found predominantly outside the West, or on its periphery and in small pockets within it.\n\nApart from the interesting (Freudian?) inversion which uses ‘jihad’ (a term that signifies the struggle in defense of universal truth) to symbolize parochialism, and a term derived from a Scottish clan name to symbolize universalism, this restatement of the old ‘Orientalist’ tautology (East is East and West is West) does not say very much. It does not explain why parochialism persists among some groups and not others. More important, it does not tell us why adopting certain lifestyles, such as eating certain types of food or wearing certain types of clothes, should have magical powers to transform people’s perceptions and conduct in very radical ways.\n\nIn the end, we are finally referring to the Orientalist thesis proper, but in an even more simplistic form. In the Muslim world, where ‘the struggle between Jihad and McWorld has been much more than a metaphor for tribalism or a worried antimodernism’, empirical data appear to point to ‘a certain lack of affinity between Islam and democracy’ (Barber, 2003: 156). While fundamentalism is a phenomenon that has emerged in most religious traditions, ‘only in Islam do fundamentalist tendencies appear to play a central role’ (Barber, 2003: 206–7; cf. Manji, 2004).1 In the end, it appears the long detour of jihad versus McWorld, to paraphrase Anderson (1995) on royal marriages and war in dynastic successions, leads back to the short route of Orientalist Culture Talk.\n\nHudson attempts to tackle the issue by dividing studies that apply the political culture approach to Arab politics into two categories: the reductionist (of which the Orientalists are the oldest and most influential) and the empiricist. The reductionists are given to ‘grand generalizations’ and plenty of stereotyping, tending to descend into absurd caricatures (Hudson, 1995: 65–7). While the empiricists have improved somewhat on the theses of ‘ex cathedra Orientalism and armchair psychology’, they remain ‘better at questions than answers’ (Hudson, 1995: 70, 68). But in spite of all these misgivings, Hudson argues that to understand ‘conditions such as legitimacy, liberalism or democracy it is hard to ignore culture … even if it is a residual variable after structural, economic and exogenous factors’ (Hudson, 1995: 71–2). One has to tread carefully, however, observing the demands outlined earlier and avoiding reductionism and being ‘methodologically multifaceted’ (Hudson, 1995: 73).\n\nLisa Anderson is less charitable to the political culture crowd, accusing them of residual racism and extremely negative attitudes to their subject of study (Anderson, 1995: 79, 88–9). They either characterize Arabs as ‘aliens’ who are radically different from everyone else, blame Islam and the transcendental notions of divine sovereignty (and the failure to render unto Caesar what is rightly his), or dwell on tribal culture, patriarchy, patrimonialism, the informality of patterns of authority, etc. Their work is riddled with logical and epistemological flaws, reflecting ‘an inability to think critically about change’ (Anderson, 1995: 89). Most of these writers fail to notice that the attitudes and behaviour patterns they refer to (when they are not mere projections or misreadings of the facts) are neither uncaused nor unchanging. To say with Hudson that ‘it is infinitely difficult to govern in the face of a hostile, recalcitrant, skeptical populace’ is to overlook the point that ‘most of the people of the Arab world are quite right to be angry, reluctant and suspicious participants in politics’ (Hudson, 1995: 86). As a consequence, to examine political change ‘through the lens of political culture rather than structure may not be the most parsimonious vehicle’ (Anderson, 1995: 86). In the end, ‘the nature of political regimes in the Arab world, like those elsewhere in the world, can best be understood as reflections of the political economy of the countries in question, particularly the character of their integration into the world economy’ (Anderson, 1995: 78).\n\nA position which tries to link political economy and culture argues that the parochialism of the ‘jihad world’ and its resistance to democracy and modernization is a function of an underdeveloped bourgeoisie, or its lack of autonomy from state control (Waterbury, 1994; Salamê, 1994; Ayubi, 1995). This is also the reason why Arab and Muslim countries remain averse to liberalism, since liberalism has been historically associated with the rise of the bourgeoisie (Binder, 1988: 336–58). The rise of an indigenous bourgeoisie and a ‘bourgeois revolution’ is needed for liberalism and democracy to evolve in Muslim lands (Binder, 1988: 66–8). In the absence of such a revolution, democracy in the areas dominated by the parochial forces of ‘jihad’ tends to evolve into an ‘illiberal democracy’, making it perhaps imperative to experiment with spreading liberalism without democracy (Zakaria, 1997; Barber, 2003: 207–11).\n\nTo postpone democratization until liberalism evolves first, some form of ‘guardianship’ scheme (one could even call it wilayat al-librali, guardianship of the liberal, in contrast to wilayat al-Faqih, guardianship of the jurist) would be needed to guide the communities in question towards liberalism and democracy. A ‘liberal autocracy’, like the one the British ran in Hong Kong during most of the last century, could be the sort of guardianship scheme needed for this job (Zakaria, 1997). This also appears to be what the G8’s ‘Broader Middle East Initiative’, launched in June 2004 to promote democracy in the Arab region, has boiled down to. The project envisages what amounts to a loose international guardianship which could help mould the region’s despotic regimes into quasi-liberal autocracies (El-Affendi, 2005). After the debacles in Iraq and the success of Islamists in elections in Egypt and Palestine in late 2005 and early 2006, even this limited goal appears to have been abandoned.\n\nHowever, like the argument about the rise of civil society as a precondition for democratization (Norton, 1995), this pinning of the hopes on an emerging bourgeoisie seems to beg the question where the ‘Black Hole State’ (AHDR, 2005) does not permit a space for civil society to function, and where ‘the emerging private sectors in most Arab countries are still largely “clientalized” by the state, or else remain “informal” or underground’ (Ayubi, 1995: 405).\n\n4. The perspectives of Arab intellectuals\n\nIn spite of Said’s demolition of Orientalism (and a plethora of other critiques2), a significant number of Arab intellectuals did not shy away from indulging in their own forms of ‘Culture Talk’. This approach was given its most coherent (and, one could add, blatant) formulation in Hisham Sharabi’s Neopatriarchy (1988), where he ascribed the longevity of Arab authoritarianism to the enduring patriarchical tendencies in Arab societies. According to Sharabi, patriarchy has been a feature of Arab culture since before Islam, which failed to modify it significantly. It has survived through the ages and managed to adapt itself to modernity, becoming ‘neopatriarchy’, combining both the enduring features of the old patriarchy with the relation of dependency vis-à-vis imperialist powers (Sharabi, 1992: 15–16, 45–66). Similar views are expressed by Khaldoun Al-Naqib, who uses the concept of tribalism to illustrate the same point. He defines tribalism as a hierarchical ‘mode of organization’ based on alliances as well as kin relationships, but also on an ‘ethos’, derived from ‘primordial associations and loyalties existing deep within the consciousness of the group’ (Al-Naqib, 1996: 9). However, Al-Naqib admits that ‘tribalism’, which he regards as the dominant organizing principle in many countries in the Arab East, is extremely adaptable to changing circumstances (Al-Naqib, 1996: 10–11, 20). This qualification squarely contradicts the central claim that Al-Naqib (following Sharabi) also makes about tribalism being so powerful that ‘Islam has been unable to displace political tirbalism … to achieve the cohesion of the umma along moral principles’ (Al-Naqib, 1996: 19).\n\nOther writers such as Hasan Hanafi similarly argue that the problems we face in attempting to build free societies can be traced back to deep roots in our shared heritage, transmitted across generations through texts or direct oral inculcation (Hanafi, 1998: 176–9). These trends include literalism, authoritarianism (distilled through Ash’arism), rejection of the other, and the rejection of rationality (under the influence of thinkers such as Abu-Hamid al-Gazali, d. 1111) (Hanafi, 1998: 179–89).\n\nThis ‘archaeological’ digging in the past to explain the present makes too many assumptions about the universal acceptance, uniform exposure and internalization of particular views, which is not supported by historical evidence. The criticism of Sharabi’s approach can also apply to Hanafi and similar schools. Like Hanafi, Sharabi, it has been correctly pointed out, indulges in sweeping generalizations for which he provides only sketchy and anecdotal evidence (Hamoudi, 2000: 18). He also neglects important facts regarding the role of mothers and the exposure of children to influences outside the home, such as schools or the media (Hamoudi, 2000: 18–21). Moreover, he fails to demonstrate any causal link or coherent interdependence between the traits he ascribes to neopatriarchy (for example, why should a society that embraces patriarchy – supposing that this was the case – tend to be irrational or lacking in initiative?).\n\nNeedless to say, this ‘culturalist’ conception does not induce its proponents to be enthusiastic supporters of democracy. For if the basic problem inheres in the culture, and therefore in the people, it would be useless to advocate democracy. The Orientalists are frank about this, as we see in Kedourie, who cites the fact that democracy has been tried and tested in the Arab world before and was a dismal failure, and who hence argues that the Arabs cannot understand, let alone embrace, democracy (Kedourie, 1994: 1–2).\n\nThe slightly more sophisticated stance expressed by Farid Zakaria (1997) and others entails demands for the setting up of a ‘benevolent dictatorship’ in each Arab country, to see it through to liberal maturity, a point made bluntly by an Arab intellectual (Elhadj, 2007).\n\nAnother Arab intellectual, speaking in 1979, reminded his audience that democracy had taken over 200 years to mature in the West, concluding that what is needed is not only to create the social and economic conditions for democracy first, but also to ‘educate the people in a democratic way, and to train them to practice democracy until democracy becomes a value deeply ingrained in their souls’ (Abdalla, 1998: 119). Another intellectual, El-Tahir Labib (in CAUS, 1998: 327) puts it thus: ‘a backward society cannot but produce a backward socialism and cannot but produce a backward democracy’. Therefore, priority must be given to the revolutionary transformation of that society.\n\nIt has been noted that a significant section of Arab intellectuals made a (very reluctant) conversion to democratic ideals in the late 1970s and early 1980s (Ismael, 1995: 95). A deep sense of crisis that engulfed Arab thought in the aftermath of the 1967 defeat by Israel was made more acute by the slide of most Arab regimes into an intolerably repressive mode. Cataclysmic events such as the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982 and the Gulf War of 1990–1, which saw direct American hegemony imposed on the region, further enhanced this sense of crisis (Ismael, 1995: 93–6; Abu-Rabi, 2004: 50–2). An intellectual writing during that period (in 1983) tried to explain the sudden ‘insistence on the issue of democracy in this period of our history by all political and intellectual trends in our homeland’ by offering three reasons. First, the lesson of the previous decades was that the social and political gains sought by revolutionaries needed the masses to protect them; second, the regimes that promised economic development and Arab unity in exchange for suspension of human rights have achieved neither, and had become so gratuitously and brutally repressive that it had become impossible to tolerate the levels of violence they deploy against opponents; and, finally, the situation in the Arab world had deteriorated dramatically in the face of US-backed Israeli hegemony, leading to a marked increase in Arab dependency in all spheres (CAUS, 1998: 11–12).\n\nHow reluctant and incomplete this conversion to democracy was can be clearly seen from the very debates announcing it. In one such debate organized by the Centre for Arab Unity Studies in Beirut in 1979, one leading Algerian intellectual and diplomat (Lakhdar Ibrahimi) argued point blank that ‘the democratic model operating in the West will not help us to achieve our goals in building a modern progressive society’, mainly due to the general condition of dependency surrounding Arab societies (CAUS, 1998: 95–7). Also, the social conditions of Arab societies, plagued as they were by tribalism, sectarianism and ignorance, make it imperative to prioritize social transformation and social justice rather than formal democracy (CAUS, 1998: 81–3). Another intellectual speaking in the same debate (George Corm) argued that the admiration for democracy in Arab opinion clashes with the antipathy to all things Western and the attachment to values hostile to the individualism that is central to Western democratic norms (CAUS, 1998: 83). A number of intellectuals engaged in that debate accepted that the call for democracy has arisen in Arab thought and practice, not for its intrinsic qualities, but as a tool to achieve independence and development (CAUS, 1998: 97). Another added that the issue of democracy did not arise in the 1950s (during the Nasserist period in Egypt) due to the ‘full confidence that power was in the hands of a resolute and able nationalist leadership’ (Adil Hussein, in CAUS, 1998: 102). In answer to a point made earlier about managing the revolutionary transformation democratically, this same intellectual rejected the idea, arguing that revolutionary change is a protracted affair, occupying an extended period characterized by a fierce struggle, not only with the former ruling classes, but also ‘against the consumerist norms among broad social groups, and against mentalities based traditionally on concepts that do not accord with the needs of development or independence, and so on’ (CAUS, 1998: 102–3).\n\nSimilar ideas were repeated in other writings and debates during the years that followed. It is to be noted that discussions of democracy by Arab intellectuals, including that in the much celebrated Arab Human Development Report, rely heavily on Western concepts and sources in their definitions and explications (Al-Naqib, 1996; CAUS, 1998; Ayubi, 1995; Sadiki, 2004). Often there are differences between those who adopt radical leftist views and those who would like to follow the more traditional liberal line, even though the recent shift referred to above points to a convergence between the two positions. This has led to a criticism that this convergence is another problematic adoption of democracy as an ideology of salvation that is espoused equally irrationally (Tarabishi, 2006: 918). Like many other Arab intellectuals, Tarabishi adopts the Culture Talk stance, arguing that the problem is a social-intellectual, rather than a political, one. Giving freedom to the people could lead to the tyranny of the majority, given the multiple ‘pathologies of Arab civil society’ (Tarabishi, 2006: 16–18).\n\nIn a supreme irony, speakers in the above debates tended to heap tons of blame on the intellectuals who, it was alleged, ‘failed dismally in performing any democratic role’, or to maintain their independence vis-à-vis the ruling regimes (Corm, in CAUS, 1998: 84). Others were even more scathing, accusing intellectuals of becoming too pro-Western and alienated from the masses, or concerned merely with their individual interests. The intellectuals were generally socially and politically apathetic and/or (more seriously) preferred to act as agents of authoritarian regimes. Some intellectuals not only serve despotic regimes as propagandists and apologists, but even ‘rationalize [repression] and push for it. [One has only to] survey the huge number of intellectuals dispersed throughout newspapers, magazines, media channels, publishing houses and research centers to become aware of this shameful reality’ (Abdalla, 1998: 50–1).\n\nThese criticisms notwithstanding, a number of the intellectuals participating in those debates were already officials or sympathizers of regimes that were undemocratic. Many more went on to become ministers in cabinets that could not be described as democratic except by an extreme stretch of the imagination and terminology.\n\nThis probably provides the key understanding as to the nature of the democratic crisis in the Arab world. From the beginning, the concern in Arab and Muslim circles has not been with democracy as an intrinsic value, but as a means to something else. The fact that the early generation of Arab reformers like Rufa’a al-Tahtawi, Khayr al-Din al-Tunisi and Abd al-Rahman al-Kawakibi (and including Abduh) advocated Islah (reform) rather than democracy (Sadiki, 2004: 218–28) was due mainly to the sense of a need to give priority to communal survival over individual freedoms. It was the same with the revolutionaries of the post-war era. For that early generation and their latter day – more radical – successors, some key objectives were too important to be left at the mercy of democratic process. Both groups did not concentrate on empowering the people as an urgent necessity, for the priority was to empower communities or states.\n\nThe fact that the elite remained at best reluctant democrats is not a problem in itself, since studies of democratic transformation have consistently revealed that political actors more often than not opt for democracy as a last resort, or as the ‘lesser evil’ from their perspective. Only later does commitment to democracy evolve and solidify, receiving an unequivocal and enduring commitment from main actors. However, the problem in the Arab world is that rival political groups continue to entertain the view that many things are too important to entrust to the vagaries of a democratic process and the whims of the populace.\n\n5. The religious dimension\n\nThe reluctant conversion to democracy among many former radicals coincided with the ‘Islamic revival’, which further complicated the renewed quest for democracy, and ensured that it would ‘further divide rather than unite secular and religious visionaries and polarize their polities and societies’ (Sadiki, 2004: 251). The debate on governance in the Arab world on the threshold of modernity became entangled from early on with the debate on what form of government is required by Islam. In its early form, the debate centred on the caliphate and whether it could be saved or restored (El-Affendi, 2008: 81–100). Additionally, this debate was also influenced by developments such as the Constitutional Revolution of 1905–6 in Iran, the first experiment of its kind in the Muslim world. Iran’s brief success in establishing a constitutional monarchy modelled on the Belgian constitution, with an elected parliament incorporating a five-man council of ulama to vet all legislation for conformity with Shari’a, became an inspiration for modern Islamic thinkers since Rashid Rida (El-Affendi, 2004a: 172–94; El-Affendi, 2008: 83–96). The combination of a popular uprising demanding participation in decision-making, with a call for incorporation of Shari’a as a basis of legislation, was seen as proof that democracy and Islam are compatible (and it explains the phenomenon that baffled die-hard Culture Talk adepts such as Elie Kedourie, who argued that polls showing the majority of Egyptians demanding democracy and Shari’a are an indication that the Arabs do not understand what democracy is about: Kedourie, 1994: 1–2).\n\nOut of that debate, a myriad of proposals emerged for forms of an ‘Islamic’ system of rule that usually combined an elected government with presumed safeguards to ensure that elected bodies would not transgress Shari’a. Many of the proponents of these models were reluctant to describe them as democratic. In fact, many were adamant that democracy and Islam were incompatible (El-Affendi, 2006). Maududi made the partial concession of calling his proposed system a ‘theo-democracy’, a partial democracy restricted by Islamic law (Adam, 1983: 117–26). This model was perfected in Khomeini’s wilayat al-faqih (jurisdiction of the learned man) system currently being implemented in Iran. According to this formula, elected bodies should be constantly under the supervision of a faqih, a man of profound religious learning and integrity who has the power to overrule any decision deemed in contravention of Islamic law.\n\nThe emergence of Islamist visions of the state has become a hindrance to democratization on two counts. First, the Islamist–secularist divide has become the primary divide in Arab politics, hindering a democratic consensus and also giving autocratic regimes and their foreign backers excuses to avoid a commitment to democracy. The association of Islamism with violent resistance to Israel (Hamas, Hizbullah, etc.) and pro-Western regimes, not to mention terrorism, has been used as a pretext by Western powers not to support Arab democracy and, indeed, to endorse autocratic regimes.\n\nSecondly, Islamist ideas and practices have themselves tended to be anti-democratic. Islamic rule in Iran and Sudan, and the anti-democratic models mentioned earlier, have tended both to build anti-democratic constituencies and to make democrats sceptical about the democratic commitments of Islamists, notwithstanding the fact that moderate Islamist groups have generally made these commitments.\n\nAs explained in some detail elsewhere,3 the Islamist ‘guardianship formulas’ remain problematic because of a number of untenable assumptions underpinning them. For one thing, these formulas appear to assume that governance is essentially a judicial process, with the ruler assuming the role of a chief justice issuing rulings about conformity to law. That characterization of governance is too narrow. Governance is about much more than law enforcement, involving as it does the constant negotiation of rival demands, interests and perceptions. The skills required here are not merely those relevant to the task of determining conformity to law.\n\nBut even if we accept this characterization, it becomes difficult to reconcile the basic contradiction between two central presuppositions inherent in these models. At one level, treating the ruler as chief justice assumes that that Shari’a law has already been clarified and laid down sufficiently for a judge to implement. But in this case, the demand for a supremely pious and learned leader to help determine the law (and the wide area of discretion granted to him) becomes superfluous. That such an expert is called for seems to suggest that the law is not that clear, needing a special guide through its mazes. But if the law is not already laid down, a question arises as to whether one individual (or a small group of experts) is better placed to determine and expound on it than a larger pool of people, which is the essence of the anti-democratic prescriptions of the proponents of the model.\n\nThe anti-democratic ethos of these ‘Islamic’ models is underpinned by a further set of interconnected assumptions, starting with the common claim about Islamic teachings encompassing every facet of life, coupled with the claim that these teachings have already been clearly laid down in such a manner that the specific recommended ‘Islamic’ option in every case cannot be missed. In addition, it is assumed that all Islamic teachings could be subsumed under Shari’a, which must in turn be enforced by a public authority, or by the state. Finally, it is held that public opinion is not a reliable arbiter when seeking to determine what Islamic law dictates, and only specialized experts can tell us what the law is.\n\nThe problem with these assumptions is not only that Islamic teachings cannot be all subsumed under the law, but also that these teachings cannot be regarded as a long catalogue of ‘off-the-shelf’ rules that could be consulted on every occasion. In fact, Islamic teachings are not all legal injunctions, since the bulk are ethical norms requiring and offering a wide area of discretion and initiative. Also the myth that Islamic teachings cover every facet of life and offer ready guidance is contradicted by unequivocal Quranic verses demanding that believers should not ask too many questions of the Prophet (Quran 5: 101). This is, in turn, related to an incident when the Prophet became upset because one individual kept demanding unnecessary clarifications about a command he gave to perform a pilgrimage, prompting the Prophet to advise his audience not to risk burdening themselves with additional duties by asking for details.4 This makes it clear that not only did Islam not have a rule for every conceivable situation, but that it is moreover a fundamental rule of Islam not to have such rules. This leaves the widest possible margin for initiative and fresh thinking on the most appropriate ethical conduct in all areas, including the area of governance, on which the texts say very little anyway.\n\nThe argument that an individual or a class of individuals is better placed to resolve matters of dispute than the community as a whole contradicts another fundamental Islamic tenet: that no priesthood is permitted or acceptable. The Quran condemns earlier religious communities for trusting too much in their ‘priests and monks’, to the extent that they have practically treated them as deities beside God (Quran 9: 31). It makes it clear time and time again that going astray by following the authority of ‘our masters and nobles’ is not an acceptable excuse in the eyes of God. Every individual is responsible for his/her own action, and only they are responsible (Quran 37: 28–35).\n\nThe Quranic injunctions against accepting authority (even presumed ‘religious’ authority) unquestioningly shift moral responsibility squarely onto the shoulders of the individual on the one hand, and the community as a whole on the other. This also rules out the prescription of the models generally offered as ‘Islamic alternatives’ to democracy. Ascribing ‘religious authority’ to an individual or a class contravenes the most fundamental Islamic tenet of all: the injunction against polytheism. A khalifah or a faqih who puts himself up as an absolute authority in fact claims divine powers for himself, an unacceptable situation that can only be negated if the individual in question becomes accountable to the community as a whole.\n\nIt would appear from the above that Islamic teachings are not only compatible with democracy, but demand it. For the assumption that the state, controlled by self-styled men of religion, is needed to guide the Muslim community to virtue, both robs the community of its autonomy without which it cannot perform its religious function and, more seriously, usurps God’s own authority.\n\nThe challenge posed for Arab democracy by Islamist thought and practice is probably the most important one at the moment, and it needs to be tackled at several levels. The Islamists themselves need to revise their models in order to reflect Islam’s true spirit, which is not only favourable to democracy, but is also, as we have shown above, one which finds democracy indispensable. Further, all political forces in the Arab world, including Islamists, need to build democratic coalitions constructed around mutual reassurances and understandings, with a commitment to peaceful coexistence and mutual recognition. This is necessary in order to deprive the despotic regimes of their divide-and-conquer advantage. Finally, a clear international stance in favour of democracy must be developed on the basis of the rejection of all excuses that maintain Arabs are not worthy of freedom for one reason or other. Nothing ever justifies the deprivation of whole peoples of their non-negotiable rights of self-determination and a life of freedom and security.\n\nIn particular, international support must be withdrawn from the militantly authoritarian ‘secular fundamentalist’ regimes which use opposition to Islamism as a pretext to deny fundamental rights. As Waines aptly put it,\n\nWhat is seldom acknowledged is that the strident authoritarian voices of contemporary religious fundamentalists have confronted for decades the powerful forces of secular fundamentalism, which have striven to eliminate them. One consequence of this has been the muting through co-optation by secular fundamentalists of the religiously authoritative voices of modernists.\n\n(Waines, 2003: 27)\n\nWhile the Islamists certainly need to clean up their act in order to make a positive contribution to democratization, key obstacles to Arab democratization are the so-called ‘eradicationists’ (Isti’saliyyin), entrenched elites in countries like Algeria, Tunisia, Syria and Egypt who believe in the ‘eradication’ of Islamists by force, and in the process close all avenues of civil action in the name of combating fundamentalism.\n\n6. The search for Arab democracy\n\nThe account above highlights some key issues impinging on the stubborn democracy deficit in the Arab world. The glaring absence of democracy in the Arab world is not in dispute. Between 1976 and 2006, not a single Arab country has been classified as free in the Freedom House annual survey. Polity IV scores tell a similar story. But it is not just the persistence of autocracy in the Arab world, but its depth. As Elbadawi and Makdisi (2007: 819) pointed out, ‘even if we consider only authoritarian regimes, Arab dictatorships are the most oppressive, with a mean polity score of –7.8 compared to –5.2 for non-Arab regimes’.\n\nA similar story also emerges from comparing annual mean changes of Polity IV in and outside the Arab world … Out of 600 observations of change in the polity score for Arab states, only 31 of them are positive (i.e. associated with political liberalization or improved status of democracy).\n\n(Elbadawi and Makdisi, 2007: 819)\n\nThere are, of course, problems with both indexes, as they do not necessarily reflect accurately the existing conditions due to their reliance on subjective measures. Thus, unrealistically, the Polity IV index gives Libya a higher score than Qatar and UAE and equal to Bahrain, while Tunisia scores higher than Morocco.\n\nMore recently, Saliba Sarsar tried to develop a composite index that\n\nquantifies democratization through consideration of multiple variables: four variables address governance and representative government. These mark how heads of state and members of the legislature are selected, as well as political party development, suffrage, and the maturity of political rights and civil liberties. The annual Freedom House survey provides a fifth variable measuring media freedom. Measurements of religious liberty can be derived from US Department of State reports. A seventh addresses the observance of human rights with the information from Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and the US Department of State. The United Nations Development Program’s human development index provides a measurement of human development. The Heritage Foundation’s index of economic freedom quantifies economic freedom. The status of democracy index assigns each of these nine variables 2 points for a total of 18 points. Each score ranges from 0 to 2, with 0 being nonexistent and 2 being the highest measurement.\n\n(Sarsar, 2006)\n\nOn this basis, Arab states were ranked according to performance, with Morocco at the top, with 11 points, and Saudi Arabia at the bottom, with 2.5 in 1999. In the 2005 rankings, Saudi Arabia was given 4, but still remained at the bottom, while Morocco was downgraded to 8, leaving Jordan and Lebanon at the top spot with 10.5 each (the same ratings they had in 1999). Again, many of the rankings display anomalies, ranking Libya, Bahrain, Oman and Qatar on the same level (5 points; Qatar was raised to 6 in 2005), while Tunisia is given a score of 10 (9 in 2005), well above UAE (6) and one point above Kuwait (9, downgraded to 8.5 in 2005). At 8.5 points (downgraded to 7 in 2005), Syria also towers above most of these countries, and was level with Yemen (raised to 9 in 2005). Clearly, there is also something fundamentally wrong with this classification (Sarsar, 2006).5\n\nHowever, the overall picture cannot be mistaken. The 2004 Arab Human Development Report (AHDR, 2005), confirms this reading, further noting the convergence of Arab regimes into an authoritarian model it dubs ‘the Black Hole State’, a polity that collapses on itself by concentrating power at the centre, normally in the hands of one person or a small clique, assisted by draconian measures and an overpowering repressive apparatus (AHDR, 2005: ch. 5).\n\nIn the 2003 report, the AHDR cited empirical evidence from the World Values Survey (WVS) that directly contradicts the Culture Talk explanation of the Arab situation. The survey has shown that the population of Arab countries values democracy as ‘the best form of government’, higher than any other region in the world. Its score in rejecting authoritarianism is also the highest, significantly higher, in fact, than the population of Western Europe in both scores (AHDR, 2003: 19). The 2004 report conducted surveys of its own that confirmed this inclination (AHDR, 2005: 89–98).\n\nOther empirical analyses based on the WVS and other data further revealed that ‘Islamic orientations and attachments have, at most, a very limited impact on views about democracy’ (Tessler, 2002: 240). This was further confirmed by empirical research conducted specifically to test Franci"
