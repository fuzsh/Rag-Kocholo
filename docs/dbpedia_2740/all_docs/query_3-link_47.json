        "text": "Durham University adopts the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s (IHRA) working definition on antisemitism in line with the UK government and recommendations from the United Nations. The University also adopts the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on British Muslims’ definition of Islamophobia in line with UK governmental bodies.\n\nPlease note that the University applies these definitions in a manner which is consistent with our legally-binding commitments to freedom of speech and to the rights of all students and staff to discuss difficult and sensitive topics, provided that this right is exercised responsibly, within the law, and with respect for others who have differing views.\n\nBy adopting these definitions, the University demonstrates its strong commitment to tackling discrimination and various forms of racism.\n\nAntisemitism\n\nAccording to IHRA, antisemitism is: “a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.”\n\nContemporary examples of antisemitism in public life, the media, schools, the workplace, and in the religious sphere could, taking into account the overall context, include, but are not limited to:\n\nCalling for, aiding, or justifying the killing or harming of Jews in the name of a radical ideology or an extremist view of religion.\n\nMaking mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews as such or the power of Jews as collective — such as, especially but not exclusively, the myth about a world Jewish conspiracy or of Jews controlling the media, economy, government or other societal institutions.\n\nAccusing Jews as a people of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Jewish person or group, or even for acts committed by non-Jews.\n\nDenying the fact, scope, mechanisms (e.g. gas chambers) or intentionality of the genocide of the Jewish people at the hands of National Socialist Germany and its supporters and accomplices during World War II (the Holocaust).\n\nAccusing the Jews as a people, or Israel as a state, of inventing or exaggerating the Holocaust.\n\nAccusing Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel, or to the alleged priorities of Jews worldwide, than to the interests of their own nations.\n\nDenying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor.\n\nApplying double standards by requiring of it a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation.\n\nUsing the symbols and images associated with classic antisemitism (e.g., claims of Jews killing Jesus or blood libel) to characterize Israel or Israelis.\n\nDrawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis.\n\nHolding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel.\n\nIt is important to recognise that this approach does not prevent criticism of Israel or the actions of the Israeli government, just as all other nation states and government can be the subject of critical discussion. For example, as set out by the Home Affairs Committee in 2016:\n\nIt is not anti-Semitic to criticise the government of Israel, without additional evidence to suggest anti-Semitic intent.\n\nIt is not anti-Semitic to hold the Israeli government to the same standards as other liberal democracies or to take a particular interest in the Israeli government’s policies or actions, without additional evidence to suggest anti-Semitic intent.\n\nFor full background on the IHRA definition of Antisemitism, please clickhere.\n\nIslamophobia\n\nAPPG’s definition states “Islamophobia is rooted in racism and is a type of racism that targets expressions of Muslimness or perceived Muslimness.”\n\nContemporary examples of Islamophobia in public life, the media, schools, the workplace, and in encounters between religions and non-religions in the public sphere could, taking into account the overall context, include, but are not limited to:\n\nCalling for, aiding, instigating or justifying the killing or harming of Muslims in the name of a racist/ fascist ideology, or an extremist view of religion.\n\nMaking mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Muslims as such, or of Muslims as a collective group, such as, especially but not exclusively, conspiracies about Muslim entryism in politics, government or other societal institutions; the myth of Muslim identity having a unique propensity for terrorism, and claims of a demographic ‘threat’ posed by Muslims or of a ‘Muslim takeover’.\n\nAccusing Muslims as a group of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Muslim person or group of Muslim individuals, or even for acts committed by non-Muslims.\n\nAccusing Muslims as a group, or Muslim majority states, of inventing or exaggerating Islamophobia, ethnic cleansing or genocide perpetrated against Muslims.\n\nAccusing Muslim citizens of being more loyal to the ‘Ummah’ (transnational Muslim community) or to their countries of origin, or to the alleged priorities of Muslims worldwide, than to the interests of their own nations.\n\nDenying Muslim populations the right to self-determination e.g., by claiming that the existence of an independent Palestine or Kashmir is a terrorist endeavour.\n\nApplying double standards by requiring of Muslims behaviours that are not expected or demanded of any other groups in society, eg loyalty tests.\n\nUsing the symbols and images associated with classic Islamophobia (e.g. Muhammed being a paedophile, claims of Muslims spreading Islam by the sword or subjugating minority groups under their rule) to characterize Muslims as being ‘sex groomers’, inherently violent or incapable of living harmoniously in plural societies.\n\nHolding Muslims collectively responsible for the actions of any Muslim majority state, whether secular or constitutionally Islamic.\n\nPlease clickhere to read the full APPG report.\n\nThis short video clip developed by Prof Peter Hopkins also provides a helpful overview of Islamophobia:\n\nFurther information\n\nGuidance and resources on facilitating faith and belief inclusion can be found in our Faith and Belief pages."
