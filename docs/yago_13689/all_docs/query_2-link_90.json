        "text": "Hey ardent readers! :-p\n\nI hope you are all doing fine. Here is an interesting review for you. A remarkable movie is showing at cinemas across Turkey, Monsieur Ýbrahim and the Flowers of the Koran (Monsieur Ýbrahim et les Fleurs du Coran).\n\nIn director François Dupeyrons Monsieur Ýbrahim, we see unconditional affection between Moses, a young Jewish boy (Pierre Boulanger), and an elderly Turkish Muslim grocer, Monsieur Ýbrahim (Omar Sharif). I think the film derives its heart and soul from this unlikely friendship.\n\nThe movie unfolds in the 1960s in a back street of Paris, Rue Bleue, where Moses house and Ýbrahims grocery are located. Rue Bleue is also a place dominated by prostitutes. Moses, who is in his teens, has a depressed father and an absent mother. In such a chaotic atmosphere, the boy spends most of his time listening to British rock 'n' roll music and checking out the local hookers through his bedroom window. Living in such a neighborhood results in Moses discovering his sexuality through having intercourse with the hookers. Surprisingly, after Moses has sex with most of these women, a humanistic friendship forms between them and the boy. (The director here seems to be emphasizing how nonsensical such social restrictions are. It isn't common to be friends with hookers, is it?)\n\nThen the movie focuses on the most important character, Monsieur Ýbrahim. Moses always shops at Monsieur Ýbrahim's grocery. For Moses, the elderly man is a silent and mysterious character who barely stirs from his seat at the cash register. However, for Ýbrahim, Moses represents youth, innocence and more importantly friendship. The more Moses comes to the grocery, the more he begins to know Ýbrahim. Ýbrahim, who shows him the kindness and friendship he never knew, becomes a father image to the boy. Events take a somber turn when Moses real father abandons him. Ultimately, Ýbrahim leads Moses on a mind-expanding road trip through Europe to Istanbul, where the movie's least predictable moments unfold.\n\nI believe the movie catches the spirit of real life and has a good central message. When people are open and curious and overcome the strictures of religion, cross-cultural ties can flourish.\n\nP.S.1: Throughout the movie, Ýbrahim is represented as a very kind and paternal character who always says, I am trying to behave as the Koran recommends. At this point in time, it is interesting to see a positive rather than a negative view of Islam from a French perspective.\n\nP.S.2: A funny but realistic observation from the director: In one scene of the movie, Ybrahim blindfolds Moses and leads him into different places of worship.\n\nWhen Moses enters a synagogue, he says, I smell incense. When he comes into a church, he says, I smell candles, and when he is led into a mosque, he says, Oohhh! I smell feet. It is funny but true. :-D\n\nP.S.3: It is very nice that rock 'n' roll music accompanies most of the scenes of the movie. Music gives vivacity to the story and prevents it from being overly serious.\n\nAtilla Karakurum (IE/IV)"
