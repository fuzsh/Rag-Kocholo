Who is the killer of rue des Hauts-Fourneaux? In Norbi’s class the boss is Aloyse, older than the other pupils. The teacher’s only interested in those who are likely to pass the entrance exam for secondary school. Norbi’s one of them, but not Aloyse, who feels scorn for Norbi until the latter shows him how to steal sweets: so they become friends. Friendship ends when Aloyse tries to steal a toy from Norbi’s father’s shop. Norbi knows Fred, who talks about Nazis, deserters, mysterious words for Norbi. Fred thinks he’s discovered the identity of P on the father’s diary. He asks Norbi to help him write Gielemännchen (collaborator) on the wall of shop. Norbi has no idea what it’s all about but when he writes the word there’s an outcry in the quarter. For Norbi time has come to prove he’s no longer a child."
