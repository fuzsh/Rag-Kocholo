        "text": "An unclassifiable and prolific author and director, Guillaume Nicloux has directed eclectic films, from experimental cinema to the thriller triptych, from offbeat comedy to political film, from drama to mockumentary. Since The Nun (presented at the Berlinale 2013), he has inaugurated a new, more introspective cycle, which The Kidnapping of Michel Houellebecq (2014) falls within, Valley of Love (in competition at Cannes in 2015), The End (2016) as well as To the Ends of the World (selected at the Directors’ Fortnight 2018) and Thalasso (2019). After four collaborations over a five-year period with Gérard Depardieu, he now appears to be pursuing another filiation with Gaspard Ulliel. In 2018, Guillaume Nicloux directed his first series for Arte/Netflix, Twice Upon A Time. In 2020, for Netflix, he shot a documentary about the carbon tax swindle and in 2021 renews his ties with genre cinema, directing a horror film, La Tour d'Assitan.\n\n© Veeren/BestImage/Unifrance"
