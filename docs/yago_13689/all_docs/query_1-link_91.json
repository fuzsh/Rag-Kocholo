        "text": "Blue-collar wise man\n\n'Monsieur Ibrahim' spans the gap between growing up and growing old.\n\nHe's 71 now and seems utterly unburdened by movie-star vanity, but even playing a humble Paris grocer Omar Sharif possesses that penetrating, dark-eyed gaze and an aura of worldly sophistication that mark him a monumental actor.\n\nAnd in the tender, heartfelt coming-of-age tale \"Monsieur Ibrahim,\" the Egyptian-born star who became an international sex symbol in sprawling films such as \"Lawrence of Arabia\" and \"Dr. Zhivago\" turns in the most touching performance in one of the richest roles of his 50-year career.\n\nAs the grey-haired, gap-toothed old Muslim man of the title, Sharif modestly embraces the melancholy ravages of age as he presides over a cramped, flyspeck grocery on the bustling Rue Bleue in a working-class neighborhood of 1960s Paris.\n\nIt's a hothouse place, alive with stylish hookers strolling insouciantly to a soundtrack of Stax soul music; a place awash with appealing flourishes of the French New Wave as seen in the restless boy Momo (Pierre Boulanger, a matinee-idol handsome teen).\n\nHe's a motherless Jewish lad who basks in the vibrant life of the street and poignantly recalls young Antoine Doinel, the soul-hungry young hero of Francois Truffaut's \"The 400 Blows.\"\n\nWhile the grizzled Ibrahim watches the passing scene with the shimmering bemusement of an ancient sage, the hormonal Momo yearns to plunge into its earthy experiences. And director Francois Dupeyron allows the boy's naked eagerness to propel the story along its tentative path.\n\nThe New Wave echoes are further underscored by a breezy early scene in which a film crew invades the Rue Bleue to shoot sequences for a movie that's clearly intended to suggest Jean-Luc Godard's \"Contempt.\" It's a gem-like scenario in which a buxom, blonde Brigette Bardot figure (Isabelle Adjani) sashays into Ibrahim's store and ignites carnal fantasies in both the randy old shopkeeper and the impressionable Momo.\n\nIt's in this sensual setting that we begin to observe Momo, desperate to grow up fast and escape the hyper-critical gaze of his dour, intellectual father (Gilbert Melki), a morose and distant man ill at ease with fatherhood.\n\nLonging to taste the forbidden pleasures of adulthood, Momo impulsively breaks open his piggy bank one day and uses the money to lose his virginity to one of neighborhood's improbably sensitive streetwalkers.\n\nNewly emboldened by his experiences, Momo strolls into Monsieur Ibrahim's grocery and shoplifts some canned goods, rationalizing that he's only stealing from an Arab. But all the while, the observant Ibrahim spies what the boy is up to, and with patience and kindly gestures he strikes up a friendship with Momo, tolerantly informing the boy that he's not an Arab but is an Anatolian Sufi from Turkey.\n\nAs this unlikely friendship between lonely Jewish boy and mystical Muslim man grows, Ibrahim encourages the boy's enormous curiosity about life and the world (nourished with pastoral parables from the Koran), and the wide-eyed Momo gives the widowed old man a renewed sense of purpose and promise in life.\n\nWhen events take a particularly tragic turn in Momo's life, Ibrahim is there to father the boy through. And the story takes a surprising yet oddly satisfying detour as the two set off in a sporty red convertible on a pilgrimage to Ibrahim's home village in the remote mountains of Turkey.\n\nIt's an unexpected plot turn that leads to a bittersweet climax -- one that's subtly nostalgic but refreshingly free of heavy sentimentality.\n\n\"Monsieur Ibrahim\" (in French and Turkish with subtitles) is adapted from a novel by Eric-Emmanuel Schmitt (which was also made into an off-Broadway play, \"Monsieur Ibrahim and the Flowers of the Koran\").\n\nUnder Dupeyron's deft, sensitive direction it opens up to offer the majestic Sharif a spare but graceful stage on which to lay out his weathered, humanist portrayal of a blue-collar wise man.\n\nAnd it's a wondrous thing to see on screen -- this grand old actor taking a fragile, familiar fairy-tale onto his broad shoulders and infusing it with uncommon warmth and wisdom through the sheer force of his embracing talent.\n\nHis \"Monsieur Ibrahim\" is indeed a worthy mentor to a questing young boy, and his story is an uncommon fable of hard-won wisdom that finds a deeply moving and compassionate intersection in life's journey between growing up and growing old.\n\nMovie: \"Monsieur Ibrahim\"\n\nStars: Omar Sharif, Pierre Boulanger and Gilbert Melki\n\nTheaters: Southroads 20\n\nStudio: Sony Pictures Classics\n\nRunning Time: 95 minutes\n\nRated: R (some sexual content)\n\nQuality: * * *\n\n(on a scale of zero to four stars)\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
