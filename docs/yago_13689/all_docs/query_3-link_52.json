        "text": "Medea is a 1969 Italian film directed by Pier Paolo Pasolini, based on the ancient myth of Medea. Filmed in Göreme Open Air Museum's early Christian churches, Pisa, and the Citadel of Aleppo, it stars opera singer Maria Callas in her only film role. She does not sing in the movie.\n\nThe film is largely a faithful portrayal of the myth of Jason and the Argonauts and the events of Euripides' play The Medea concerning the betrayal of Medea by Jason and his eventual demise at her hands.\n\nThe film was received positively by critics but did not receive commercial success. According to film commentator Tony Rayns the film represents a committedly adversarial piece of art from the director who loved to challenge society. Rayns calls the film \"a love song to Maria Callas\" and describes the ending as \"backing him (Pasolini) into a cul-de-sac\" for the dark ending of the film which almost seems like a resignation from cultural production. Indeed, Pasolini's dramatic and adverse personality is very much alive in this film which depicts Medea's murder of her husband, children and her husband's lover.\n\nAnd Now My Love (French: Toute une vie) is a French-Italian film released in 1974 by Claude Lelouch, starring Marthe Keller, André Dussollier, Charles Denner, and Charles Gérard. The American title derives from the use of the Gilbert Bécaud song \"Et Maintenant\" at the film's climax; the song title literally translates as \"And Now,\" and the song became a worldwide hit when it was recorded with English lyrics as \"What Now My Love\".\n\nAnd Now My Love was nominated for the Best Original Screenplay Oscar in 1975. The film was also screened at the 1974 Cannes Film Festival, but wasn't entered into the main competition.\n\nThe film tells the stories of two stepbrothers who fall in love with the same woman. Isa (In English, Jesus) grows up with his brother, Musa (In English, Moses). Musa is in love with a woman named Meryem (In English, Mary) and wants to get married. But Musa escapes from the village because of a crime he has committed. Musa has to hide. Maryem and Isa get married. Years later Musa returns. Isa gets a fatal disease. Isa (Jesus), Musa (Moses), and Meryem (Mary) will face in a journey they have emerged. This movie is difficult to understand, this film does not contain any action, and it is very different from same films. It's a psychological film. Even if it's a boring film, it's watching for untouched Cappadocia scenes.\n\nAnaganaga O Dheerudu (English: Once Upon a Warrior) is a 2011 Indian Telugu-language fantasy adventure film directed by debutant Prakash Kovelamudi in his first mainstream film. Co-produced by Disney World Cinema, and Arka Media Works with veteran director K. Raghavendra Rao at a budget of ₹ 270 million, it stars Siddharth, Shruti Haasan, and Baby Harshitha as protagonists with Lakshmi Manchu as the antagonist. This film marks the Telugu debuts of Haasan and Manchu. It features a musical score by Salim–Sulaiman, an ensemble soundtrack by Salim-Sulaiman, M. M. Keeravani, Koti and Mickey J Meyer, while cinematography and editing are handled by Soundar Rajan and Sravan Katikaneni, respectively. Anaganaga O Dheerudu focuses on the journey of Moksha, a nine-year-old girl with special healing powers, and Yodha, her fierce warrior bodyguard, as they travel to a faraway village to save its children, under the constant menace of the evil witch Irendri.\n\nManisnya Cinta Di Cappadocia is a comedy love film directed by Bernard Chauly and starring Nur Fazura, Shaheizy Sam, Faizal Hussein, Rafidah Abdullah, Lisa Surihani and Fauziah Ahmad Daud. The film tells the story of the conflict of Ifti Liyana (Nur Fazura) who has to face the love of three men, Fredo (Josiah Hogan), Bahkhtiar (Faizal Hussein) and Nazmi (Shaheizy Sam). After meeting himself with Nazmi in Cappadocia, Turkey, he chose to be with Nazmi. The film was released to the public on 11 December 2014. The film has won two awards out of ten nominations at the 27th Malaysia Film Festival.\n\nA young man leaves his work and his girlfriend behind for a while and leaves for Anatolia. After a short while, he found himself in a friendly village in an idyllic and farce mountain village. After a while, he realizes that he will no longer be able to return to the village. In fact, he made an inner journey towards his own past and his true personality. From now on, his view of himself and life will change.\n\nTreasure tells the story of a man who finds himself in unexpected situations in the town where he went to attend his mother's funeral. Mesut, who is a civil servant, receives the news of his mother's death and returns to the town where he was born and grew up years ago to attend her funeral. Mesut, who came to town to fulfill his last duty to his mother, has only one thing on his mind to return to Istanbul as soon as possible and complete his unfinished affair. However, things don't go as Mesut planned and he has to stay in the village longer than he thought. Meanwhile, Mesut, who participated in a treasure excavation because of his brother Musa, finds himself in various adventures."
