        "text": "Film Review\n\nC'est quoi la vie? is a fairly typical 1990s French social drama which centres around a young man, a farm worker, who is desperately looking for direction in his life. Forceful performances from Eric Caravaca and Jacques Dufilho (playing respectively Nicolas and his grandfather) make this a poignant and memorable film. Through some stunningly beautiful photography, the film conveys the heart-wrenching dilemma which the young farmer faces and constantly reminds us that the search for self-fulfilment is neither straightforward or painless.\n\nAlthough this is unquestionably an attractive and engaging film, its depiction of country life is somewhat superficial, resorting too often to familiar stereotypes. The sumptuous photography shows the beauty of the landscape but does little to convey the hardship of the life of a farm worker. The stylised, romantic feel of C'est quoi la vie? suggests more a latter day fairy tale than a realistic portrayal of country life, but there is sufficient realism for the film to have an impact (in particular, the references to mad cow disease and the increasing unprofitability of farming).\n\n© James Travers 2000\n\nThe above content is owned by frenchfilms.org and must not be copied.\n\nNext François Dupeyron film:\n\nLa Chambre des officiers (2001)\n\nFilm Synopsis\n\nNicolas lives on a farm in the heart of rural France. The farm presently belongs to his father Marc, who is fighting a losing battle to pay off his accumulating debts whilst supporting his family. The news that his herd of cattle is contaminated with BSE and must be destroyed is more than Marc can bear. He hangs himself and the farm has to be sold. Meanwhile, Nicolas is uncertain what to do with his life. He is so used to country life that he not sure he can give it up, and yet he feels he needs a change. He tries his hand at delivering farm produce to Paris, but his heart isn't in it and he soon gives it up. When his grandfather objects to being put away in a hospice, Nicolas decides to move back to the country with his family. Before he knows it, he is starting to live the life of the peasant farmer, and as he does so, he realises that this is the only life he wants...\n\n© James Travers\n\nThe above content is owned by frenchfilms.org and must not be copied."
