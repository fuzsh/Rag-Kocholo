        "text": "ABOUT THE FILM\n\nMain Idea/Topic:\n\nThe main idea of this film is the importance of communication, and the importance of communication within the nuclear family. It talks too, about the importance of a paternal figure who teaches how to be a man of good and how things work in life and this world. And that the greatness of life is acquired or acknowledged when one learns that “everywhere you look at, you can find beauty.”\n\nMain Characters:\n\nMoses Schmitt (Momo)\n\nMonsieur Ibrahim Demirdji\n\nMyriam\n\nSylvie\n\nMomo’s Father\n\nMomo’s Mother\n\nPaulie (Momo’s Fictitious Brother)\n\nPERSONAL RESPONSES\n\nInitial Responses:\n\nI thought it was an excellent movie, one of the best I have seen. It had beautiful situations, in which the presence of a lesson for life is always there to enrich our world views.\n\nLater Responses:\n\nIt’s a movie about the loss of innocence, about the love of father and son, about abandonship, about cowardly, about intelligence, about life experience, about love, about the importance of being happy and the importance of how to smile. Is a movie about a kid that has no affection in his house because has no mother and his biological father does not know how to be a father. Is a movie about one of the hardest things that could happen to a person in life, it is about one of the hardest stages in a human life which is teenage, the stage in which almost defines how we are going to be for the rest of our lives according to what happens to us during these years, but is also about how a kind heart can fix any broken jar.\n\nWho is the writer on the film? / Has the screenplay been adapted from another work?\n\nFrançois Dupeyron\n\nEric-Emmanuel Scmitt\n\nThe screen play was adapted from Eric-Emmanuel Schmitt’s novel Monsieur Ibrahim et les fleurs du Coran, the same name as the film, and also in some passages of the Coran, the sacred book of Islam.\n\nBackground on the director:\n\nGraduate of the IDHEC, 1978 the Night of the owl its first court-measuring and \"the rut\" then in 1982 like realizer, scenario writer for \"one is always too good\", \"the dragonne\" and documentary Night of the owl and mamento gain each one César of best short-measuring 1988 François Dupeyron carries out its first Funny full-length film \"of place for a meeting\" with an imposing casting with Catherine Deneuve, Gerard Depardieu, Nathalie Cardone, the film is nominated for César of the first opens. 1994 François Dupeyron coécrit the son preferred with Nicole Garcia 2001 François Dupeyron is the scenario writer and realizer of film \"the Room of the officers\", the film is in selection with the festival of canes and a nomination for César of best opens (2002) 2002 François Dupeyron carries out Mr Ibrahim and the flowers of Coran according to opens of Eric-Emmanuel Schmitt. 2004 François Dupeyron publishes its first book \"Inguélézi\" at Southern Actes the film adaptation is scheduled for May 2004.\n\n(www.biosstars.com)\n\nWhen was the film made? / What is/was the social and political climate like at the time in that country and the world?\n\nThe Left, led by Socialist Party leader Lionel Jospin, whom Chirac had defeated in the 1995 presidential race-unexpectedly won a solid National Assembly majority (319 seats, with 289 required for an absolute majority). President Chirac named Jospin prime minister on June 2, and Jospin went on to form a government composed primarily of Socialist ministers, along with some ministers from allied parties of the Left, such as the Communist Party and the Greens. Jospin stated his support for continued European integration and his intention to keep France on the path towards Economic and Monetary Union, albeit with greater attention to social concerns. The tradition in periods of \"cohabitation\" (a President of one party, prime minister of another) is for the President to exercise the primary role in foreign and security policy, with the dominant role in domestic policy falling to the prime minister and his government. Jospin stated, however, that he would not a priori leave any domain exclusively to the President. Chirac and Jospin worked together, for the most part, in the foreign affairs field with representatives of the presidency and the government pursuing a single, agreed French policy. Their \"cohabitation\" arrangement was the longest-lasting in the history of the Fifth Republic. However, it ended following the National Assembly elections that followed Chirac's decisive defeat of Jospin (who failed even to make it through to the second round of voting) in the 2002 presidential election. This led to President Chirac's appointment of Jean-Pierre Raffarin as the new prime minister. On May 29, 2005, French voters in the referendum on the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe turned down the proposed charter by a wide margin. This was generally regarded as a rebuke to Chirac and his government. Two days later, Raffarin resigned and Chirac appointed Dominique de Villepin, formerly Foreign Minister as Prime Minister of France. A enduring issue is Jean-Marie Le Pen's National Front party, whose anti-immigration, isolationist policies have him accused of racism and xenophobia. It managed to face Chirac's UMP in the 2002 presidential election second ballot, which many had thought only Chirac and Jospin would reach.\n\nThe modern social structure in France started late 1950's and is based on three distinct classes. The first and highest class is made up of the high level politicians, the wealthy families and the also powerful business owners. Such examples are the president Jacques Chirac, and the CEO of Airbus Noel Forgeard. Following the higher class people, the middle class group comprises of two different types of white-collar jobs. Senior executives of companies and the groups in which the professional jobs are included which include high income and are more or less stable. The lower class comprises of blue-collar jobs where many people are in food-service jobs or work in retail. The unemployment level and the low living standards are very common in this group. Due to the shift to industry, the number of blue-collar jobs has decreased and the workforce in the civil service section has steadily increased.\n\n(www.wikipedia.com)\n\nWhat does the title mean in relation with the film as a whole?\n\nTry to establish a connection –sometimes clear, sometimes metaphorical.\n\nThe title in relation with the film as a whole means two things, the first one is that all throughout the film Monsieur Ibrahim talks about what is in his Koran, and when Momo finally opens his Koran finds two blue flowers that is why the title, but the important thing about this is the meaning of the flowers, this two flowers represented Momo and Monsieur Ibrahim, represented their relationship as father and son; which automatically leads us to the next meanings that refers to all the lessons that Monsieur Ibrahim thought Momo; these lessons are the flowers. Then all in all, is all related which means that the title could mean just one big things composed by these two facts that are tightly joint together.\n\nDescribe how the opening credits are presented? / How do they relate to meaning?\n\nIt starts with a black background and some credits are shown in white letters with a sound of someone tuning in a radio; then, it cuts to a sequence in which a prostitute lights a cigarette and bys some roses while Momo is watching her from his apartment in an upper floor of the building. After that, it cuts to the same situation but the next day during daylight, probably midday; next, it cuts again to the black background and the film’s title is presented. Subsequently, it cuts to a sequence in which Momo is getting dressed to go out and while he is doing it, he is also practicing some lines in the mirror of how he is going to tell the prostitutes to get in bed with him. Then, it cuts again to the black background and the remaining credits are shown. The credits are related to the meaning of the movie as a whole in the fact that during these sequences Momo has just turned 16 years old which by the 60’s in France was the legal age to sleep with prostitutes, but the thing is that Momo at that point does not receive love from no one and his father never talks to him about manhood, so he just looks for love in these prostitutes that eventually care for him and by sleeping with them he thinks he will become a full grown up man. But he has too much to learn yet. Also the sound is used to introduce us to the time in which the story takes place.\n\nWhat three or four sequences are most important in the film? / Why?\n\nThe scene in which he has his first time with Sylvie a prostitute and when he is leaving she tells him that he forgot her gift, he goes to his house and he stares at himself in the mirror for a few seconds, then he jumps into his bed and grabs a Teddy Bear, he thinks a little and rushes into the street to find Sylvie, when he does, he gives her the Teddy Bear and runs away. This scene is important because he does this on the day of his 16th birthday, what we see in these sequence is what Momo is thinking, he is a kid and goes to the prostitutes to be a man, and he pays with the money from his piggy bank. He is still a kid, but after he consummates with Sylvie he sees himself as a man, so he looks at himself in the mirror to see if something is changed, but he looks just the same, the change takes place in his head and because he thinks it does, but in fact he is just the same boy, because when Sylvie tells him that he forgot her gift, he gives her a Teddy Bear, showing that he is still a kid; whether he is aware of it or not.\n\nThe scene in which Momo is paying some stuff to Monsieur Ibrahim at the store and he asks him why is it that he never smiles, and Momo responds by saying that is because he can not afford it. Then Monsieur Ibrahim says “do you think I’m rich?” and Momo says “your till’s full of money”. Monsieur Ibrahim then responds that that money pays for the stock and the rent, and if he knows how much he has left to live on, then he affirms that is not much. Them Momo says that when he says that smiling is for the rich, he is referring to the happy people. Next Monsieur Ibrahim tells him that he is wrong; because smiling is what makes you happy, and that he should try it and he would see. This scene is important because is the first life lesson that Monsieur Ibrahim teaches Momo; that is, the lesson of how to smile, Monsieur Ibrahim teaches Momo how to be a happy person, and he teaches him in the moment that Momo most needed it. A lesson that says that “a smile can work wonders.”\n\nThe scene in which during Momo and Monsieur Ibrahim’s first Sunday walk, they sit down at a café and while talking, Monsieur Ibrahim tells Momo that one can find beauty wherever we looks at. While he says this he is drinking a glass of whiskey and Momo looks at him and tells him that he thought that Muslims did not drink and Monsieur Ibrahim responds that he is a Sufist, Momo looks at him with a weird face and Monsieur Ibrahim explains him that is not a disease, that Sufism is a way of thinking, but that some ways of thinking could be a disease. Then when Momo is home he looks for the dictionary and reads the definition to himself which says: “Sufism: Is a mystical form of Islam. Opposed to legalism. It stresses inner religion.” Then Momo looks for legalism in the dictionary and it says: “Legalism: Meticulous observance of the law.” And Momo think about it and establishes that Monsieur Ibrahim is against the law, be does not know what law. Still, Momo looks at his father which is in the same room and says to himself “if being against the law is not being like him, I prefer being against the law.” This scene is important because Momo accept a philosophy or a way of thinking by opposition to his biological father, and the lesson he accepts is given by Monsieur Ibrahim; the lesson is a reflection on inner religion, is a teaching of one of the most important things in life. That is, that reality is a matter of perception, a matter of definition.\n\nThe scene in which Momo’s biological father leaves him on his own and leaves him some money with a note that says something like “Son: I’m leaving and I’m sorry about it, I leave you all my money and a list of people you can contact. I just was not born to be a father, maybe we will meet someday in the future when I’m less embarrassed and you have forgiven me. Good Bye.” Then Momo rushes into Monsieur Ibrahim’s store and buys some food for him and his father to make everyone believe that his father is still there and he is not sent to an institute. This scene is important because it marks a fundamental change in Momo and Monsieur Ibrahim’s relationship; this departure of the biological father makes their relationship more intimate, now their connection is as father and son.\n\nThe scene in which Monsieur Ibrahim and Momo are on their way to the Golden Crescent and Monsieur Ibrahim tells Momo that “A man’s heart is like a caged bird. When you dance, your heart sings… and then it rises to heaven.” This scene is important because throughout the movie the presence of the music of demarked, but after Momo and Monsieur Ibrahim start their bond is that Momo begins to dance. It is a subtle way to tell that Momo has learned his way to heaven and happiness thru the teachings of Monsieur Ibrahim.\n\nThe scene in which Monsieur Ibrahim is dying he tells Momo that he is not dying, that he is just going to join the immensity. This scene is important because is the last lesson that Monsieur Ibrahim teaches Momo; that is, a lesson of heaven and earth and that even though we are taken away from our physical shape we are still alive in the hearts of those who learned from us or remember us. Is a lesson of not being afraid of dying, is a lesson of knowing how to die.\n\nThe scene in which Momo reads Monsieur Ibrahim’s testament which says: “I, Ibrahim Demirdji, hereby leave all my goods to Moses Schmitt, my son Momo, because he chose me as his father and because I’ve given him everything I’ve learbed in this life. Now you too will know what’s in my Koran, Momo, its all there is to know.” Then, Momo opens Monsieur Ibrahim’s Koran and finds two blue flowers. This scene is really important because is telling us that Momo, is ready for life, that he has know the knowledge he needs to survive on his own, that now he has attained another level of maturity, that now he really is a man.\n\nWhat were your expectations from your knowledge of that country’s cinema or director’s work? / Where they confirmed or disappointed? Explain.\n\nI expected a really visual movie, with great esthetic. I expected a movie which was shocking, insightful and intriguing. Not only all of these expectations were excellently fulfilled, but also I found that the movie explained in one perspective what the philosophy of life says.\n\nIn your opinion, what was the aim/purpose of this film? Be specific.\n\nI believe the main purpose of the film was to show that no matter our beliefs, our religion, our styles, our ways our cultures, we all have one thing in common: we are humans which makes us brothers; therefore, its possible to join, to live together in peace and harmony, it just depends on us.\n\nGive at least five examples from the film (besides the language) which signal it’s being labeled a film from _____________________ (country).\n\nIt presents a critical vision of contemporary society\n\nFocuses on educated, middle-class milieu\n\nPortrays marginal areas of French society\n\nPresents an individualistic point of view\n\nDepiction of a character whose primary function is to ‘be’ rather than to ‘do’\n\nHow does the film try to make its case? (e.g. by emotional appeal, alienation, manipulation of point of view, documentary authority, symbolism, etc.) Give examples. / Is it persuasive?\n\nThis movie does not try to, but does make its case in a brilliant and not only persuasive, but very subtle way through emotional appeal. Because when we see Momo’s family situation one tend to take his side as he is a boy which serves his father all day and studies, is a boy that has a hard life, the only happiness he gets is by having sex with the prostitutes that hang around his block and by talking to Monsieur Ibrahim. The is Monsieur Ibrahim which at first we don’t know how to react before him as he is a little bit distant, but then when we get to know how he is and all the knowledge he has acquired from his experience, and when we see the monumental kindness of his soul and heart helping poor Momo, we learn to like him too. And also is really emotive every time that Monsieur Ibrahim teaches Momo a lesson, because he most of the time does is in a metaphorical, lyrical and romantically beautiful way."
