The movie is based on a book and a play by Eric-Emmanuel Schmitt.\n\nContents\n\nPlot\n\nSpoiler warning: Plot or ending details follow.\n\nThe film begins in a working-class neighborhood in Paris. The main character, Moses (Momo), is a young Jewish boy growing up without a mother and with a father afflicted by crippling depression. Momo as fascinated by the elderly Muslim man (Ibrahim) who runs a grocery store across the street from his apartment (where Momo often pickpockets). Their relationship develops and soon Momo feels closer to Ibrahim than to his father. Ibrahim affectionately calls Moses Momo, and adopts him when his father leaves and commits suicide. Moses and Ibrahim go on a journey to Turkey, Ibrahim's homeland. Ibrahim dies there in a car accident, and when Momo returns to France he finds that he has inherited the store. In the final scene, we see a young child pickpocketing from the store, and Momo calls out to him, replicating the first scene in which Momo was introduced to Ibrahim.\n\nLove in Monsieur Ibrahim\n\nProstitutes\n\nMyriam\n\nCast\n\nMonsieur Ibrahim – Omar Sharif\n\nMomo – Pierre Boulanger\n\nMomo's father – Gilbert Melki\n\nMomo's mother – Isabelle Renauld\n\nMyriam – Lola Naynmark\n\nSylvie – Anne Suarez\n\nFatou – Mata Gavin\n\nEva – Celine Samie\n\nExternal links"
