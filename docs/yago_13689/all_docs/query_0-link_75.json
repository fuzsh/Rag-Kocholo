        "text": "(M) Como\n\nThe melancholy sounds of Timmy Thomas's '60s anthem, Why Can't We Live Together? can be heard at the beginning and end of Monsieur Ibrahim. The song's theme, a cautiously framed address to brotherhood and co-existence, is an important aspect of the film: but so too is its style, its gentle and hesitant sweetness.\n\nThe American and French pop tunes that punctuate the movie come from the radio of Momo (Pierre Boulanger), a young Jewish teenager who lives in a working-class quarter of Paris in the '60s. His mother has departed without trace: he lives with his controlling, nervy father, who torments him with comparisons to Paulie, the idealised older brother Momo never knew.\n\nMomo, neverthless, is an enterprising boy, who uses the contents of his piggy bank to finance his sexual initiation with one of the prostitutes who ply their trade in the Rue Bleue, across the street from his flat. For groceries, he goes to the shop run by the man his father calls \"the Arab\" - Monsieur Ibrahim (Omar Sharif) who sits quietly behind the counter and doesn't seem to notice that the boy is covertly pocketing an item of food every time he buys something.\n\nMomo is intrigued by Monsieur Ibrahim, who in his turn quietly reaches out to the boy, piques his curiosity, offers him advice on what to buy for his father's meals, and makes it perfectly clear that he knows the full extent of Momo's shopping habits.\n\nHe has more to offer, it turns out. Monsieur Ibrahim, adapted by director Francois Dupeyron from a novel by Eric-Emmanuel Schmitt, has the air of a parable or a fairytale: there is something of the fairy godfather in the title character, played with slow, quiet charm by Sharif. Wise, occasionally indulgent, offering insights and advice, he's the father figure that Momo conspicuously lacks.\n\n\"I am not an Arab, I am from the Golden Crescent,\" he tells Momo, early in the film. Often he quotes from the Koran, but he is, as he explains to Momo, a Sufi. The relationship between the two is explored without obvious didactism: the film is more interested, in the end, in the pleasures of discovery that Momo experiences with Monsieur Ibrahim.\n\nMomo's Paris is, despite the austerity and emotional deprivation of his life, a beautiful, somewhat idealised place: but despite the essential buoyancy of the film, it still has some dark and disconcerting moments. And although in its final stages Monsieur Ibrahim moves into the realm of the sentimental and the slightly melodramatic, this doesn't undermine the warmth and confidence of what has gone before."
