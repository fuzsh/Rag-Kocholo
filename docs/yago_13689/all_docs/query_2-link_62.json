        "text": "In François Dupeyron’s sweet life-lessons drama, set in a cheerful vision of sixties France, a young Jewish orphan (Pierre Boulanger) befriends an oracular Muslim shopkeeper (Omar Sharif). Unlikely bonds are forged and life lessons are learned, yet Sharif’s mischievous performance lifts the film above mere melodrama. (1 hr. 35 mins.; R)  BILGE EBIRI AND LOGAN HILL\n\nSpotlight: Omar Sharif\n\nWhen Omar Sharif read French playwright François Dupeyron’s script for Monsieur Ibrahim, he says, “I liked it, but I was worried.” In the strangely sunny script, set in a sixties Paris populated by beautiful, kindly prostitutes, a teenage Jewish orphan is befriended by an elderly Arab shopkeeper, who imparts oblique advice before a noble and mysterious ending. “I thought, ‘This man is always saying these wise things. Why?’ ” Sharif splays his wrinkled fingers in front of his face, striking a mock-innocent look. “He had no life except when the Jewish boy came into his shop. Why? He was very mysterious, this man.” So Sharif, no stranger to mysterious and wise men—think of Peter O’Toole’s sidekick Ali, in Lawrence of Arabia—decided to spice up the character with his own mischievous charm: the patented sidelong glances and eye-twinkling that, come to think of it, George Clooney must have stolen. But the 71-year-old Sharif says he has no problem being typecast as an elderly Arab. In fact, he’s had his fill of nontraditional casting. “Sure, Ben Kingsley can do that sort of thing—he can play anyone. But I still sound like I just got off a camel,” he says before running through a formidable list of roles, including the Russian lover of Dr. Zhivago and the German intellectual of The Last Valley. “Me? A German? Back then, I thought Hitler must be turning in his grave,” he says. “No more. No, it’s all old Arabs for me now.\n\nOpens December 5\n\n Showtimes & tickets (movietickets.com)"
