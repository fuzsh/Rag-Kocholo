        "text": "Moses Schmitt (Pierre Boulanger) is a 13-year-old Jewish boy from the same neighborhood. He and his sullen father (Gilbert Melki) live in a state of genteel poverty. Bookcases that reflect the father’s bibiliophilia dominate their modest, joyless apartment. There is no nurturing maternal presence here, as the mother apparently abandoned the family when Moses was still an infant. Her absence haunts the apartment and fuels the father’s overarching resentment towards his circumstances. The father offers no emotional support and scant attention to his motherless son. Instead, he persistently berates Moses, comparing him unfavorably to an unseen older brother.\n\nMoses has assumed most of the domestic duties of this fragmented family. He shops for groceries at Ibrahim’s shop and has taken to shoplifting whenever he is there. Ibrahim is aware that Moses is filching the merchandise. Rather than respond with anger, however, it elicits Ibrahim’s compassion. He insists upon foisting free merchandise on the wayward lad.\n\nOver time, the shopkeeper and the adolescent forge an increasingly close bond. At long last, there is an adult in Moses’ life who takes an active interest in his emotional well-being. Ibrahim dubs the lad “Momo,” a name that could easily be a nickname for either Moses or Mohammed, patriarchs of Judaism and Islam, respectively.\n\nOne day, the boy arrives home and finds a dispassionate note from his deeply depressed father. It informs Moses that his father has also abandoned him. What will become of him, now that he is devoid of mother or father to guide him?\n\nScreenwriter-director Francois Dupeyron (“What Is Life?,” “The Officer’s Room”) has done a superb job of adapting Eric-Emmanuel Schmitt’s story. He allows the film to unfold at its own leisurely pace and the relationship between Moses and Ibrahim to develop in an unforced manner. It is a treat to see Sharif, who has been absent from the screen for far too long, as a philosophical Muslim. In his screen debut, Boulanger provides an impressive complementary performance.\n\n“Monsieur Ibrahim” is a gem of a film that makes an understated, non-polemical case for the brotherhood of all God’s children.\n\n***1/2 (out of ****); (for some sexual content); 96 minutes"
