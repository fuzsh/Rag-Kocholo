        "text": "This modest, sentimental film concerns the friendship between Momo, a young Jewish boy (Pierre Boulanger), and Ibrahim (Omar Sharif), a Muslim shopkeeper who becomes his surrogate father and spiritual guide. Set in Paris in the 1960's, the movie has a scruffy, New Wave look and a soundtrack full of period-appropriate French and American pop songs. This is, at bottom, a lesson in tolerance, but the atmosphere of unassuming realism and the tenderness of the two central performances make it less cloying then it might be, and Mr. Sharif's sly charisma almost rescues his character, who is basically the personification of exotic, enigmatic wisdom, from being a dubious Orientalist cliché. - A. O. Scott, The New York Times\n\nStarring Omar Sharif, Gilbert Melki, Anne Suarez, Pierre Boulanger, Lola Naymark. Directed by François Dupeyron. (R, 94 minutes).\n\nMonsieur Ibrahim"
