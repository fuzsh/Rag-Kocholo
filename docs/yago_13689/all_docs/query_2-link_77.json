        "text": "The city’s revival and repertory houses will, for the next few weeks, be utterly dominated by the French cinema, new and classic. At Film Forum, Robert Bresson’s 1951 “Diary of a Country Priest” gets a two-week run, beginning today (Anthony Lane’s Notebook entry about it in the magazine this week is available to subscribers), followed by François Truffaut’s “The Soft Skin” for a week. But the biggest news concerns the comprehensive retrospective, at the recently reopened Museum of the Moving Image, of the films of Alain Resnais. (In the opening weekend is one of his best films, “Muriel,” from 1963.) The word that is, rightly, most associated with his work is “memory.” His short film “All the Memory in the World,” a documentary about France’s national library, opens with a glance at a camera and a microphone as a voice-over intones, “Because their memory is short, men accumulate innumerable reminders.” And, aptly, the first weekend’s offerings also include a work of memory about one of Resnais’s greatest memory-movies: “Memories of Last Year at Marienbad,” a documentary in which Volker Schlöndorff—who was Resnais’s assistant on that film—provides voice-over commentary for home-movie footage shot on location by the late actress Fran&#231oise Spira. I saw it last year in a private screening; it’s one of the finest recent movie-centric documentaries. Moving Image is showing it Saturday at four and Sunday at two. The Resnais series runs through March 20th. Many of these films are quite rarely seen here; I’ll revisit some of them here soon.\n\nBAM Cinémathek’s retrospective of films featuring Catherine Deneuve begins next Friday, and she’ll be on hand for some introductions and Q. & A.s. It’s an excellent series, but there are three films I wish it included: Benoît Jacquot’s “Princess Marie”; Philippe Garrel’s “Night Wind”—maybe his greatest film and certainly the one in which he brought a grand chapter in his career to a devastating close (it’s his first late film, maybe even later than those that followed); and Leos Carax’s “Pola X,” a gloriously grandiose adaptation of Melville’s “Pierre: or, The Ambiguities” (which is one of my favorite books). Then there’s the vigorous theatrical contrivance of François Dupeyron’s first feature, “A Funny Place to Meet” (“Drole d’endroit pour une rencontre”).\n\nDeneuve has been an international star since the age of twenty; she has also been a mother since the age of nineteen. In an interview today in Le Figaro, she describes herself as “a woman who resists social pressure,” and explains that this is so\n\neven if it’s easier to be free when you’re famous. But at the same time, I was like that at seventeen; I think it’s in my nature. What I don’t want now, I didn’t want when I was younger. I’m consistent in what I don’t want. As for my strong taste for freedom, I have a theory: I think that children from a big family need more freedom, more space for themselves. Of all my sisters, I was the one who was in the biggest hurry to leave.\n\nOne of her sisters, of course, was Françoise Dorléac, who is one of the stars of Truffaut’s “The Soft Skin” (and died in a car accident in 1967). Deneuve has lived a full—and, more important, a surprisingly ordinary—life. When she was very young, she seemed old beyond her years; now she seems more youthful and spontaneous than most stars her age. Her choice of films has always balanced her commercial productions with audacious works of art (as she says in this interview, “Sometimes you have to choose radicality”), and what makes her a special performer isn’t just her beauty and grace. She brings a kind of lived experience to her work. There are actors and directors who, having achieved fame, give the impression of not having stepped in dogshit in decades; Deneuve seems to walk through the streets freely.\n\nMeanwhile, from March 3rd through 13th, a whole host of venues (Film Society of Lincoln Center, BAM Cinémathek, IFC Center, and French Institute Alliance Française) open their doors to the annual “Rendez-Vous with French Cinema” series, which this year includes new films by Jacquot, Catherine Breillat, Romain Goupil, and many others. I’m particularly looking forward to seeing “La Campagne de Cicéron,” a 1990 film by Jacques Davila, whose first feature, “Certaines Nouvelles,” I liked a lot when I saw it five years ago. (Davila died in 1991.)\n\nThen, in mid-April, Film Society of Lincoln Center will offer a retrospective of films by directors who began as critics at La Lettre du Cinéma, the most prominent of whom, Serge Bozon, will be in town for discussions and other events.\n\nOf all the world’s cinemas, only the French cinema, classic and recent, continues to exert such an enduring fascination here. It is, of course, also the national cinema which has attracted a remarkably large number of the country’s novelists, philosophers, and other artists to its industry and to its critical ranks; the centralization of Paris as the capital of cinema, art, government, and finance has a lot to do with it, as does, of course, the fact that France is, literally, the birthplace of the cinema and has taken it up as an integral aspect of its artistic heritage and self-image. Then, of course, there’s the fact that our very conception of cinema is largely based on the ideas of the Cahiers du Cinéma critics of the nineteen-fifties and on the films they made as the French New Wave. In any case, the wealth of French movies here now and coming soon may provide some further clues."
