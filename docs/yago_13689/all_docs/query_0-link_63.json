        "text": "Presenting inter-religion interaction between a Jewish boy and Muslim man, Monsieur Ibrahim puts Omar Sharif and Pierre Boulanger in the leading roles. Set in suburb area of Paris, Moses a boy arounda lives only with his depressed father, which Moses is oblivious about. He saves money so he can pay the prostitute in his region. Ibrahim is a Muslim resides near to him and owns a small grocery store. Sometimes Moses steals small thing which he doesn’t put in the cashier table. Because of Ibrahim’s friendly character, Moses becomes close to him and called with lovely name, Momo. Ibrahim keeps saying ‘I know what is in my Koran’. Later after his father died Ibrahim will take him to Turkey, his homeland.\n\nThe movie is directed by Francois Dupeyron whose movie La chambre des officiers got into 2001 Cannes Film Festival. The movie is adapted from book Monsieur Ibrahim et les Fleurs du Coran by Eric Emmanuel Schmitt. This is one of the peaceful movie combining the relation between two people of different religion. Though both of them do not show any religiosity, Moses is apparently not at all religious since he lived with a father who never really be affectionate to him however it is not the same to Ibrahim. Ibrahim is going to be the person who represents peace to Moses with all his tranquility since he knows his religion and implementing it in moderate way.\n\nSome analysis told about the intentional names picked for the characters, Moses and Ibrahim. Both of them are the vital founders of the religions. The movie shows a little road scene in the end which is inspiring and hurtful, because there Moses will be separated from Ibrahim due to his death. However the logic is not getting into me when Ibrahim wants Moses to get down in the middle of the road and he will take him back later. It is not clear in the end whether Moses converts into Islam or stays being a Jewish because even though Ibrahim’s family handed him the Koran and told him to learn from it, there is not at all scene where the movie told about the detail. He just ends up being the keeper of Ibrahim’s store when he is grown up."
