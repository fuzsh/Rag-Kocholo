        "text": "Over a decade of birdwatching has taught me that “if you feed them, they will come.” This works with teenagers and a multitude of other creatures, too.\n\nI became a novice birder when I married my husband, Gerry in 2007. He has been a birdwatcher most of his life and his backyards have always boasted bird feeders and bird houses and he’s been known to grandfather dozens of nest of bluebirds in the spring. His bookshelves were full of bird books when I met him, and they’ve become fuller since he married me.\n\nA few years ago, I had made it my New Year’s resolution to learn more about the 300 species of birds that frequent the Bay State. I wouldn’t say I’ve been consistent with this goal, but I’ve learned that I can at least impress my grandchildren with a few names and facts here and there. And so, this past weekend found me reading An Introduction to Massachusetts Birds by Christopher Leahy. It’s a short paperback book, pamphlet-sized actually, published by the Massachusetts Audubon Society in 1975.\n\nMy grandchildren are certain to quickly surpass me in their birding knowledge and I’m going to have to learn fast to keep up. One of our youngest, 1-1/2 year old Maeve, was pointing out the dark-eyed juncos by our feeders this past Sunday morning within minutes after Gerry pointed them out to her. Three-year old Phoebe is well aware that she bears the name of one of her Papa’s favorite birds and he’s taught her the Phoebe’s birdcall. Papa and Phoebe counted over 50 robins in our front yard last weekend. Papa and I watch the male and female cardinals who visit our yard year-round with 2-year old twins Ava and Judah 1-1/2 year old Gabby. We can’t wait for our youngest, 2-month old Jack, to learn to watch for and point out Great Blue Herons as they pass overhead at dusk each summer evening on their way to the rookeries with food for their babies.\n\nOver the past four years, since moving into a weekend home on the south coast, we’ve welcomed more and more species of birds. Our journal notes over 45 types from juncos just before the start of winter and the starlings and blackbirds in the first days of spring. Red tail hawks have landed on our woodpiles, always seeking the most vulnerable of the birding and natural world. We’ve seen our feeders go instantly still, birds suddenly freezing one second to the next, hoping the hawks won’t detect a breath or shiver. Gangs of mourning doves gather below our feeders and coo their delight in the seeds that have been generously dropped by previous visitors.\n\nWhen reading Leahy’s Introduction to Massachusetts Birds, I was aware that his words of wisdom in the very first chapter of the book were true. If your feeders are full, and if you create a welcoming space, the more likely the birds will come. Gerry and I know that when we’ve been absent for a just a few weeks, and our feeders are empty, that it takes at least 24 or 36 hours before the word is out. There is food again! And the backyard birds return to visit.\n\nJulie Zickefoose is the author of some of the most enjoyable books about birds. She and her husband, Bill Thompson, editor of Bird Watcher’s Digest, both blog and write about birds from their home in Whipple, Ohio. (Yes, Whipple. Named after the stream Whipple Run. Named after the man who tripped and fell in the stream. True story.)\n\nHusband Bill Thompson has written numerous birding books, among them Birdwatching for Dummies. He’s also collaborated on books with his wife, Julie as the illustrator. Some of those are The New Birder’s Guide to Birds of North America (2014) and Identify Yourself: the 50 Most Common Birding Identification Challenges (2005) and Natural Gardening for Birds (2001). They’ve collaborated on books for children such as The Young Birder’s Guide to Birds of North America (2012) and they’ve written and illustrated many more.\n\nZickefoose started her career as a field biologist and became a nature illustrator, using her own experiences with birds and animals in Appalachia. She is a contributor to both NPR’s All Things Considered and Bird Watcher’s Digest, writing articles and submitting cover paintings the magazine. (Her website includes many other examples nature, including mammals, amphibians, reptiles, insects and plants.)\n\nBooks written and illustrated by Zickefoose are enchanting works of art. The lovely prose and the beautiful artistic renditions make them my favorites. The Bluebird Effect was published in 2012. Baby Birds was just released just months ago in 2016.\n\nThe Bluebird Effect is a published journal full of wonderful essays about a variety of birds, organized by season. Among many other species, spring includes the bluebird, summer the osprey, fall the red tail hawk, and winter the mourning dove. Zickefoose questions whether bluebird and their nests would survive without the gentle nurturing of their human beings’ concern. That is also true of Osprey that live bountifully along the south coast of Massachusetts where many organizations nurture their nests. These shorebirds summer in tall coastline habitats, built by humans who care enough to nurture them.\n\nZickefoose’s latest book, Baby Birds: An Artist Looks into the Nest (2016), is a wonderful book to peruse with a preschooler. The artist’s renditions chronicle the bird from egg through chick to fledgling. The book includes all Eastern species including house sparrows, northern cardinals, tufted titmouse and ruby-throated hummingbirds. When reading to a 3 or 4-year old, almost all of the prose can be abbreviated. The illustrations can tell the story.\n\nSharing nature, particularly wildlife such as birds, can be an added bonus to everyone, whether it be with your children, friends, grandchildren, or spouses. Bill Thompson brings their children, Phoebe and Liam, birding and points out reasons why children should become birders early in life. I agree with Julie Zickefoose who claims “Every day I find something new.”\n\nCharlotte Canelli is the Library Director of the Morrill Memorial Library in Norwood, Massachusetts. Read Charlotte’s column in the January 26th issue of the Norwood Transcript and Bulletin.\n\nIt had only been a month since my two year old brother Paul had died as I padded down the stairs for my daily evening cry in my parents arms. Paul and I were best buddies. Since I was the big girl of the family, a fourth grader, I was often given the responsibility of watching him. We would hang out on my parent’s bed. Paul would giggle in hysterics as I bounced the bed below him. Paul was born with disabilities. He was two years and hadn’t learned how to sit up. Often he would have seizures that frightened me and my siblings. Having four germy older brothers and sisters would unfortunately cause the pneumonia that took his life.\n\nWhen I reflect on those days and my reaction to Paul’s death, I have such compassion for my parents. They were dealing with their own grief, but they were constantly barraged by mine. I swear it was months that I would make my trek downstairs to sob. I don’t believe there is an antidote for someone’s grief no matter what age, but the Children’s Department has many books that may help parents and children cope with its ravages. There are titles that address the process of funerals and cremation. What Happened to Daddy’s Body by Elke and Alex Barber explains what happens to the physical body after death. A Place in My Heart by Annette Aubrey helps children to learn how to hold onto a loved one’s memories. Something Very Sad Happened: A Toddler’s Guide to Understanding Death by Bonnie Zucker provides parents of younger children assistant in explaining this life change. Children often face the death of a pet before a family member. Titles like Good Bye Jeeper:What to Expect When Your Pet Dies by Nancy Loewen are a good choice. There are many fictional picture books that present ways for children to work through grief. Jim’s Dog Muffins by Miriam Cohen and Cat Heaven by Cynthia Rylant tackle this issue in a meaningful manner.\n\nDealing with difficult issues through books is called bibliotherapy. Having the ability to read to a child about death provides parents with the opportunity to separate from their own grief in order to further explain and acknowledge the child’s experience. We are all have to cope with grief whether an adult or child and the library provide Please do not hesitate to ask a librarian to help you wade through a difficult time.\n\nJean Todesca is the Head of Youth Services at the Morrill Memorial Library in Norwood, Massachusetts. Read Jean’s article in the January 19, 2017 issue of the Norwood Transcript and Bulletin.\n\n2017 has dawned, and it’s time to think of new beginnings and challenges. It’s always a healthy thing to think about how one can change and improve, and what better time than the New Year?\n\nWhen I was younger, I used to take New Year’s Resolutions more seriously and engage in them ambitiously, at least for a short time. Health options are always good. Exercising and eating better have been on my list on and off for years, but neither has a good track record.\n\nIn the computer age, I have spent more time looking at a screen than a page in a book. So I want to plan to read more books. I have, of course, read some books on screen, but the comfort level is still not there.\n\nSpeaking of books, I have sort out some guidance by looking for resolutions in books. “52 Small Changes: One Year to a Happier Healthier You” by Brett Blumenthal is a fun and comprehensive book. Each chapter is a week (52) and gives a suggested life change for each one. Changes range from diet/nutrition and fitness/prevention to mental well-being and green living. It is very specific by giving sample diets and instructional exercises. Blumenthal’s premise is that change takes time, and if one follows a change each week, by the end of the year, one will feel happier and healthier. It would take a lot of discipline to follow his recommendations that closely, but the book gives some very interesting and realistic changes from which one can choose.\n\n“30 Lessons for Living: Tried and True Advice from the Wisest Americans” by Karl Pillemer,Ph.D. is a book that can make one think what changes can be made to have a more fulfilling life. Pillemer is a gerontologist who collected advice of wisdom from people over the age of 65. He wanted to “find out what older people know about life that the rest of us don’t.” Advice is given in the book for lessons on such life issues as marriage, career, money, children, aging, regret and happiness. Pillemere claimed that interviewing the people and writing the book changed his own perspective on life.\n\n“Pivot: The Art and Science of reinventing your career and Life” by Adam Markel is a newer self-help book on how to change one’s life. The idea for the book came from a health scare that Markel had as a result of a stressful and unhealthy life style. He presents the book as a toolkit and roadmap for reinventing one’s life. Markel’s advice goes beyond simply choosing a new year’s resolution, but the book is an interesting read for anyone who is considering some serious and sweeping life changes.\n\nBenjamin Franklin said, “Be at war with your vices, at peace with your neighbors, and let every New Year find you a better man”. I guess that sums it for all time. New Year’s resolutions at least give us the chance for pause and reflection. Happy 2017!\n\nNorma Logan is the Literacy Volunteer Coordinator at the Morrill Memorial Library. Read Norma’s column in the January 12, 2017 issue of the Norwood Transcript and Bulletin.\n\nOne of my favorite childhood memories is spending New Year’s Eve with my grandparents. They lived in Tuftonboro, New Hampshire, a spot overlooking Mt Shaw and surrounded by pine trees and heaps of snow in the winter. During this time, I remember a fire in the fireplace and the smell of Nana’s homemade fish chowder. Sometimes my family would stay up to watch the ball drop in New York City but more often we’d gather in the living room where each person would share what they were grateful for in the past year. It was a peaceful, reflective time.\n\nNeedless to say the calm often disappeared the next day when the mad scribblings of New Year’s resolutions began. Even now the difference between a goal and a resolution confound me. However, I found the clearest distinction between these two words on author Gretchen Rubin’s blog. She says: “You hit a goal, you achieve a goal. You keep a resolution.” In other words, if healthy living is your resolution, Pilates might be your goal.\n\nAfter many, many years of struggling with my annual list of resolutions, I’ve come to a wonderful conclusion. This is big news, so listen up! All of your goals and resolutions can be met by the public library. “What’s that?” you say. “Did you go heavy on the eggnog?” “How can the library possibly help me fulfill my goals in 2017?”\n\nWell, I’m glad you asked. Let us count the ways together.\n\n1. Perhaps you’ve been meaning to help others in your community but you aren’t sure where to begin. Did you know the Morrill Memorial Library has one of the twelve Literacy Affiliate programs in the State of Massachusetts? If you have the time and desire to help adult learners improve their literacy skills, the library has an opportunity for you. Likewise, our Outreach department has volunteers who deliver books and resources to patrons who are physically unable to get to the library.\n\n2. Are you hoping to read more this year? Well, how about that? The library happens to have books galore. But let’s get specific. Not only do we circulate the latest Best Sellers, but should you be too busy to enter our doors, we have a solution for you too. You can borrow books using OverDrive and Hoopla on your cellphone or tablet with your library card. And, if you don’t want to read alone, we have a variety of book clubs available for you to join.\n\n3. Need to shape up? Ah, that fateful word—exercise. I believe I heard a community sigh echo across the room. But let’s think about it in the broad sense of becoming healthier this year. You can accomplish this goal at your public library as well. We have exercise DVDs for the young, the mature and the restless. Everything from Kick Starting Your Metabolism to Cardio Kickboxing. We also have Pilates and Yoga, for the gentler souls.\n\n4. Then again, you may prefer to revamp your diet rather than twist your body into a variety of yoga contortions. We have a bevy of cookbooks for the occasion. My Kitchen Year: 136 Recipes That Saved My Life by Ruth Reichl “follows the change of seasons as Reichl heals through the simple pleasures of cooking after the abrupt closing of Gourmet magazine.” Or try Good and Cheap: Eat Well on $4/Day by Leanne Brown. “If you’re living on a tight budget, Brown shows you how to maximize every ingredient and gives you tips on economical cooking methods; shopping and kitchen equipment; and much more.” And you can’t go wrong with Ree Drummond. Her book entitled The Pioneer Woman Cooks: Dinnertime: Comfort Classics, Freezer Food, 16-minute Meals, and Other Delicious Ways to Solve Supper answers the question “What’s for Dinner?” with 125 simple recipes for the whole family.\n\n5. Want to stay in touch with family and friends but your social networking skills are a bit rusty? While we offer a variety of structured classes, you are welcome to sign up for individual technology assistance with our fabulous gurus. Some of the topics covered are help purchasing new technology, using a mobile device tablet, or Facebook and Twitter guidance.\n\n6. Who doesn’t want to add “Seeing the World” as a resolution for this year? The library has a whole travel section on our second floor. You can prepare for your trip ahead of time, without purchasing every single guide. And, speaking of travel, does your passport need updating? The Morrill Memorial Library is now an authorized US Passport Acceptance Facility. Several staff members have been trained to process passport applications. Book an appointment online, bring all your required paperwork and payment, and soon you will be all set to jet.\n\n7. Maybe you’d like to learn something new! We have workshops and lectures ready and waiting for you. Our Reference and Children’s departments create wonderful programs for all ages, including movie nights (with movie theater popcorn), expert speakers, and Learn to Knit classes. Maybe your child/grandchild can introduce you to a new board game (which you can now check out from the library) or to Queen Elsa when she visits.\n\n8. But wait! There’s more! Have you been meaning to find some of those relatives who may have fallen off of your family tree? We have several databases that could help you trace your roots. American Ancestors and Ancestry Library must be used at the library but Heritage Quest may be searched from home or a device with your library card. Also, Joe Petrie is our volunteer genealogist. You may schedule a one on one appointment with him for two hours and he will assist with your research using the online databases.\n\nIsn’t that amazing? So many of your New Year’s resolutions can be found under the roof of your public library. In the words of Ray Bradbury, “Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future.” What are you waiting for? Come check us out!\n\nNancy Ling is an Outreach Librarian at the Morrill Memorial Library in Norwood, Massachusetts. Read her article in the January 5, 2017 issue of the Norwood Transcript and Bulletin.\n\nIt’s not the holidays for me without a Love Affair. The movie, that is. It might be the original 1939 black-and-white film. Love Affair. Or it could be the 1957 color remake, An Affair to Remember. Or perhaps it’s the1994 Love Affair, Warren Beatty-style. It’s that ending scene on Christmas Day in Terry McKay’s apartment that makes my holiday season a classic affair of the heart.\n\nThe original Love Affair released in 1939 was Director Leo McCarey’s first attempt at telling the story of a notorious playboy who falls deeply and surprisingly in love with a beautiful fellow cruise mate. McCarey co-wrote this tale of a love affair between French painter and paramour, Michel Marnet and the beautiful Terry McKay. (This screenplay was written by Delmer Daves and Donald Ogden Stewart.)\n\nMcCarey had recently crossed the Atlantic himself, along with his wife on a cruise ship. That voyage was inspiration for the film when he viewed the Statue of Liberty and skyline upon entering the New York harbor. The film was shot in glorious CinemaScope, its lovely photography of the luxurious ocean liner and wide-open ocean, impressing theatergoers. Michel Marnet is played by popular French actor Charles Boyer. Boyer is aloof, and a bit too serious, for my taste. Yet, his Michel Marnet character manages to woo glamorous and feisty Terry McKay, played by Academy Award nominee Irene Dunne. Unlike the actresses who played McKay in other versions of the film, Irene Dunne was also a singer. The song sung by children from the orphanage in the 1939 film (“Wishing”) was nominated for Best Original Song in 1940. Of course, “Over the Rainbow” from the Wizard of Oz was also nominated and it won the award that year.\n\nIn 1957, Director McCarey, realizing the enormous success of one of the greatest romances of all time, decided to remake Love Affair. He had directed a big failure in 1952 (My Son John) and needed a sure win. And so, in An Affair to Remember, McCarey cast heart throb, British-American Cary Grant in the new version. Grant played opposite red-headed Deborah Kerr as Nick Ferrante.\n\nCary Grant was a charismatic and handsome playboy and he was the perfect man for his role in Affair to Remember. Grant was in the midst of his third marriage at the time of the film (eleven years from 1949 to 1962 to Betsy Drake) and that marriage actually lasted the longest of any of them.\n\nEven today over 60 years later, An Affair to Remember is absolutely most film-lovers favorite version of the two versions of the film. Several obvious reasons are that Grant is more likeable and sensitive than Charles Boyer in the role of the uncatchable bachelor. Instead of a distant and suave Frenchman in the 1939 film, Cary’s character is both European and American and just a bit more vulnerable. Deborah Kerr as Terry McKay is still feisty and feminine, but the film is in glorious color, and highlights Kerr’s subtle creamsicle gown or bright 50s orange jacket.\n\nMcCarey included the same dialog in virtually every scene and it seems a direct replay from the original with Cary’s British accent substituting for Boyer’s French.\n\nWhat really contributed to the 1957 film’s success, however, was its Academy Award-nominated theme song, “An Affair to Remember” or “Our Love Affair”. Not only is it sung by Vic Damone at the beginning of the film, but is also sung later in the film by Terry McKay, Deborah Kerr’s leading character. Interestingly, Deborah Kerr did not sing in the film but her voice was actually dubbed by Marnie Nixon. Nixon was also the lead character’s singing voice in the film versions of The King and I (Deborah Kerr), West Side Story (Natalie Wood), and My Fair Lady (Audrey Hepburn).\n\n“Our Love Affair” became a jazz standard after its popularity in the film.\n\nThe critics don’t agree with me, but my favorite version of the film is the 1994 version, Love Affair, produced by Warren Beatty. The box office didn’t agree either; the 1994 Love Affair cost over $60,000,000 to make and only grossed $18,000,000 in theaters.\n\nHowever, I think Beatty was perfectly cast. For over three decades of his life, and into his mid-50s, he was known as an insufferable romancer. He was so self-absorbed, in fact, that Carly Simon admitted in her autobiography (Boys in the Trees, 2015) that her cranky song “You’re So Vain” was written about three womanizing men, one of them Warren Beatty.\n\nYet, in 1992, Beatty had finally settled down at the age of 55 with actress Annette Benning. She was cast as Terry McKay in his version of Love Affair, just as she seemingly had been in real life. Beatty and Benning have now been married 24 years (with three children.) In the film, when Beatty is perfectly believable when he says “You know, I’ve never been faithful to anyone in my whole life.”\n\nThe last version of Love Affair begins on a flight from New York to Sydney Australia. When the plane goes down somewhere over the Pacific islands, Beatty and Benning, playing Mike Gambril and Terry McKay, are forced to board a Russian cruise ship in order to re-board a flight in Tahiti. The supporting actors who join them and wacky Russian crew make the film funny and bright for me. It is also Katherine Hepburn’s last film role film role at the age of 86 and she is wonderfully crabby. Kate Capshaw and Pierce Brosnan, play the love interests at home and the late Garry Shandling is particularly charming as Beatty’s agent.\n\nIt’s interesting to note that the screenwriters have named the lead actress Terry McKay in all three versions, whether played by Dunne, Kerr, or Benning; yet, her love affair is with Michel Marnet in 1939, Nick Ferrante in 1957, and Mike Gambril in 1994.\n\nWhichever version of this film you love, the story has been enchanting us for nearly four decades and are worthy of a watch anytime during the year.\n\nCharlotte Canelli is the library director of the Morrill Memorial Library in Norwood, Massachusetts.
