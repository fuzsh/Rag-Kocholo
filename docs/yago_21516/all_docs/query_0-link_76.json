        "text": "The movie Love Affair in 1994 just captured my heart. Perhaps it was the drama of seeing Mike (Warren Beatty) silently wait on top of the Empire State Building with rainshowers and thunderstorms. It was heartbreaking witnessing the used-to-be-playboy wait in the rain with the painting for his beloved Terry (Annette Bening). He kept waiting and waiting. She was not there.\n\nIt was indeed a love affair. One of the highlights of the movie was when Mike’s aunt Ginny (Katharine Hepburn), played an instrumental (Love Affair by Ennio Morricone ) while the two visit her on a paradise-like island.\n\nI have seen the film at least 20 times now. It’s one of my favorite movies because it shows how faith holds a person together for that one soul on the other side of the rainbow. They just both waited, hoping for an opportunity, or in the hearts of their hearts praying that the heavens will conspire a plan to make them meet and fall in love again. Love Affair will totally make you dig deep into the beauty and wonder of having a broken heart forget, forgive and fall again.\n\nThere is just the kind of love that will hit you once and for eternity."
