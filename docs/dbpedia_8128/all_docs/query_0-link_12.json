        "text": "Deda Ena\n\nIakob Gogebashvili (1840-1912), Georgian educator, writer and journalist, compiled and published Deda Ena in 1876. The name translates to “Mother Tongue.” Deda Ena was a collection of literary texts designed by Gogebashvili to promote the Georgian language at a time when the study of Georgian was discouraged, banned and seen as a source of resistance to Russia’s “superior” culture. Deda Ena has gone through multiple editions, and is used to this day for teaching Georgian in schools. A symbolic aspect of Georgian identity, Gogebashvili’s primer was inscribed on the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Georgia registry in 2013.\n\nBACK TO CONTENTS\n\nGeorgian Chokha\n\nThe chokha is an important element of Georgian national clothing. A woolen coat with cartridge casings on the chest, the chokha made its appearance in Georgia around the 9th century. Worn in other regions of the Caucasus, chokhas come in different shapes, sizes and colors. Three types of chokhas – the Kartl-Kakheti, the Khevsur and the Acharian – are the most common regional versions. To this day, chokhas are frequently encountered at wedding ceremonies, funerals and other important events.\n\nBACK TO CONTENTS\n\nGeorgian Cinematography\n\nGeorgian cinema is known for its cinematography all around Europe. The first movie screening in Tbilisi with Lumière apparatus took place on November 16, 1896, just months after the first Lumière film screening in Paris and St. Petersburg. In 1912, Vasil Amashukeli (1886-1977) depicted Akaki Tsereteli’s, a prominent national poet and liberation movement figure, journeying in Racha-Lechkhumi, and created the first full-length (about 1200m of film) Georgian documentary (Journey of Akaki). The first Georgian feature film Christine was based on a short story by Egnate Ninoshvili (1859-1894), a Georgian writer and social democratic activist. Importantly, both Journey of Akaki and Christine are commemorations of Georgian national poetry and literature, a method that many Georgian filmmakers utilize to showcase Georgian culture and pride. Georgian cinema has countless movies of merit, such as The Eccentrics (1973), The Wishing Tree (1976), Blue Mountains (1983), Repentance (1986), The Sun of the Sleepless (1992), and newer emerging masterpieces, such as Tangerines (2013) and Corn Island (2014).\n\nBACK TO CONTENTS\n\nGeorgian Cuisine\n\nA central aspect of Georgian tradition is the “supra,” a Georgian feast held on important occasions. A “supra” is not complete without a Tamada, or a toastmaster, the person in charge of leading the toasts. Traditionally, the Tamada opens the feast with a toast to the homeland, and then to God, before shifting to guests.\n\nGeorgian hospitality, the “supra,” and toast making would be incomplete without the diversity and richness of taste that characterizes Georgian cuisine. With the inclusion of various spices, organically grown vegetables, and rich fillings and sauces, Georgian traditional dishes offer a culinary adventure.\n\nIndividual historical provinces of Georgia have their own method of preparing traditional dishes like Khachapuri (Georgian cheese bread). Chopped vegetarian dishes (Pkhaleuli) are characterized by spiced plants and unique seasoning, while poultry dishes like satsivi are known for the exotic taste of meat brought out by walnut and garlic sauces. A particularly popular meat dish is khinkhali, meat dumplings with a rich meaty juice and eaten by hand. A peculiar national dessert is churchkhela, which is threaded walnuts dipped in hot grape mixture.\n\nBACK TO CONTENTS\n\nGeorgian Script\n\nAsomtavruli, nuskhuri and mkhedruli are all recognized by UNESCO. “The living culture of three writing systems of the Georgian alphabet” satisfied all criteria for inclusion in the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2016.\n\nAlthough the oldest Georgian inscriptions date back to the fifth century AD, many historians debate the time of their first appearance. Leonti Mroveli, the ninth century Georgian historian and the author of kartlis tskhovreba, a collection of Georgian medieval historical texts, dated the creation of the Georgian alphabet to King Parnavaz (Third/Second century BCE) who, he claimed, extended the language throughout Georgian territories. Ivane Javakhishvili, the Georgian historian and linguist as well as a founder of Tbilisi State University, argued that the Georgian alphabet and its writing system was already in place by the 7th century BCE.\n\nThe modern Georgian script – mkhedruli (literally meaning “knightly”) – was preceded by the more rounded forms of asomtavruli and the decorative characters of nuskhuri. Mkhedruli has changed very little since its first appearance in the ninth and tenth centuries AD, and is one of only 14 existing alphabetic scripts in the world. The asomtavruli and nuskhuri alphabets are informally practiced and are often taught in Georgian schools. They are predominantly used by the Georgian Apostolic Autocephalous Orthodox Church.\n\nBACK TO CONTENTS\n\nPolyphonic Singing\n\nGeorgian polyphonic singing has been inscribed on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity since 2001. Polyphonic singing is an important tradition for Georgians as it helped preserve Georgian language and culture when the country was occupied by invaders. Some songs still performed today date back to the eight century. Georgian polyphonic songs are “lifestyle” songs, sung during harvesting or at funerals and during festivities.\n\n“Chakrulo” is a Georgian polyphonic battle song, included in the Golden Record of 27 selections of world music that was sent into deep space on two Voyagers on August 20 and September 5, 1977. The Golden Records were meant to showcase the diversity of life on Earth to any intelligent extraterrestrial life out in the galaxy.\n\nBACK TO CONTENTS\n\nSvetitskhoveli Cathedral\n\nLocated in Mtskheta, Georgia’s ancient capital at the confluence of the Aragvi and Mtkvari Rivers 20 km. northwest of Tbilisi, Svetitskhoveli cathedral is a powerful monument to medieval Georgian architecture. Svetitskhoveli cathedral, along with the Holy Cross Monastery of Jvari and Samtavro Monastery, is recognized by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.\n\nThe historical monuments of Mtskheta illustrate the diffusion of Christianity to the Caucasus, and embody a history of human settlement in the region since the late 3rd millennium BCE. The churches depict the evolution of ecclestiastial art from the 4th to the 18th centuries.\n\nSvetitskhoveli was the coronation site of Georgian monarchs as well as a place of royal burial. Vakhtang Gorgasali, a canonized Georgian king who ruled in the 5th-6th centuries, founded the modern capital of Georgia, Tbilisi. His burial site is in Svetitskhoveli cathedral. Svetitskhoveli cathedral is recognized by Georgians as the burial site of Christ’s mantle, making it a sacred place for Christians.\n\nBACK TO CONTENTS\n\nThe Knight in the Panther's Skin\n\nWritten by Georgia’s national poet Shota Rustaveli, The Knight in the Panther Skin used to be an essential part of the dowry of every noble Georgian bride. A Georgian medieval epic poem depicts fictional adventures in India and Arabia, which represent allegorical settings of the rule of the popular King Tamar of Georgia, the first woman to rule Georgia with a title of a King. Emphasizing the glory of Georgia’s Golden Age during King Tamar’s rule (12th and 13th centuries AD), 1600 Rustavelian Quartains embody values of devotion, conscience, courage, friendship and love. Excerpts from The Knight in the Panther Skin make up an essential part of the Georgian language curriculum in Georgia’s educational institutions.\n\nBACK TO CONTENTS"
