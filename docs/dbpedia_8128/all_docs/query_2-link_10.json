See the methodology.\n\nOverview\n\nGeorgia holds regular competitive elections and hosts lively media and civil society sectors. However, oligarchic influence affects the country’s political affairs, and opposition figures have faced physical attacks. Corruption in government persists and media freedom is undermined by intimidation and pressure against journalists. Executive and legislative interference in the courts remains a substantial problem, as does a lack of transparency and professionalism surrounding judicial proceedings.\n\nGeorgia\n\nFree\n\n76\n\n100\n\nA Obstacles to Access 19 25 B Limits on Content 29 35 C Violations of User Rights 28 40\n\nLast Year's Score & Status\n\n78 100 Free\n\nScores are based on a scale of 0 (least free) to 100 (most free). See the research methodology and report acknowledgements.\n\nOverview\n\nWhile the Georgian online environment remained free during the coverage period, a civil society report revealed that the country’s telecommunications regulator had instructed internet service providers (ISPs) to block hundreds of websites over several years. Additionally, a report from Meta linked a network of inauthentic accounts spreading progovernment narratives to a government agency. Popular pressure forced the Georgian Dream, the ruling party, to withdraw the “foreign agents” bills that would have required civil society organizations (CSOs), online media, and other platforms to register depending on the amount of foreign-sourced funding they receive. State institutions and media outlets did not face any reported major cyberattacks during the coverage period.\n\nGeorgia\n\nTransitional or Hybrid Regime\n\n34\n\n100\n\nDEMOCRACY-PERCENTAGE Democracy Percentage 33.93 100 DEMOCRACY-SCORE Democracy Score 3.04 7\n\nLast Year's Democracy Percentage & Status\n\n34 100 Transitional or Hybrid Regime\n\nThe ratings are based on a scale of 1 to 7, with 7 representing the highest level of democratic progress and 1 the lowest. The Democracy Score is an average of ratings for the categories tracked in a given year. The Democracy Percentage, introduced in 2020, is a translation of the Democracy Score to the 0-100 scale, where 0 equals least democratic and 100 equals most democratic. See the methodology.\n\nOverview\n\nPolitical polarization and party-led radicalization continued to shape Georgian politics in 2023. The ruling Georgian Dream (GD) party faced a choice between expanding its grip on power and advancing necessary reforms to achieve EU candidate status. Most opposition parties pushed their narrow political agendas and therefore failed to persuade the politically disenfranchised electorate to vote for them. Public opinion surveys showed that much of the electorate remained undecided on which party they would vote for, showcasing the failure of most political parties to attract new supporters. Polarization and partisanship has also pervaded the media landscape, including a number of key media outlets that have been accused of biased coverage. This divisiveness has also created a hostile environment for the media. Many journalists and media professionals have faced intimidation, violence, and harassment.\n\nElection Watch for the Digital Age equips technology companies, civil society organizations, and policymakers with a data-driven resource for evaluating the human rights impact of internet platforms on a country’s electoral process.\n\nOur Election Vulnerability Index consists of key election-related indicators regarding a country’s political rights and internet freedom. Derived from our annual Freedom in the World and Freedom on the Net reports, the data and accompanying analysis allows users to identify specific areas of concern ahead of a country’s election, including online influence operations, internet shutdowns, or intercommunal tensions fanned by social media.\n\nPrevious Reports: 2020 | 2024"
