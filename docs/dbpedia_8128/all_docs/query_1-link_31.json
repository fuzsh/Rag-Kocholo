        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is the second-largest country in Africa and has been the centre of one of the world’s longest-running conflicts for decades. Ongoing fighting between rebel groups and government forces, systemic corruption, years of mismanagement of the country's resources and recurring health crises like COVID-19, cholera, measles and Ebola, have left DRC in a severe humanitarian crisis. It is estimated that 27 million people are experiencing poverty and food insecurity – the highest number in any African country.\n\nDRC is rich in natural resources like oil, diamonds, gold and other precious metals, yet over half of its population live in extreme hardship. In recent months, renewed fighting between rebel groups and the DRC’s army has further exacerbated decade-old tensions throughout the country’s insecure East.\n\nOver 5 million children and adults in the DRC are currently displaced, facing poverty, violence, and psychological trauma. Many are forced to flee their homes due to the extreme actions of armed groups and militia.\n\nWhat is the DRC?\n\nThe DRC stands for Democratic Republic of the Congo, formerly known as Zaire.\n\nWhy is it a republic?\n\nFollowing a constitutional referendum involving Belgium and political activism from Congolese people, Zaire became the DRC in 1965. Then in 1997, President Kabila formally changed the country's name after overthrowing the previous regime of Mobutu.\n\nWhat is the population in the DRC?\n\n108 million\n\nWhat are the official national languages of the DRC?\n\nFrench, Kituba (Kikongo), Lingala, Swahili, and Tshiluba\n\nWhat is the capital city of the DRC?\n\nKinshasa\n\n*Red pins show areas where we work.\n\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo Today\n\nThe most recent war in Eastern Congo officially ended in 2003, but ongoing fighting in the East of the country has intensified in recent months, fuelling regional tensions. Armed groups operating in the Kivu and Ituri provinces have launched increasingly brutal and large-scale attacks on civilians, resulting in cross-border involvement, worsening Rwanda-DRC relations. These renewed tensions between armed groups means that more children will be at risk of recruitment and the situation threatens to exacerbate an already dire and critically underfunded humanitarian crisis. Today, the DRC is the scene of one of the world’s most neglected crises. Millions of people are in need of humanitarian aid and the threats facing families and children, and those who have become separated whilst fleeing, are growing by the day.\n\nKeep in touch\n\nWe'd love to keep in touch about our work and how you can continue to make a difference to children's lives, by sending you updates we think you'll be interested in, including fundraising, merchandise, cultural events and activities.\n\nEmail opt-in\n\nSMS opt-in\n\nWe may also contact you by post or phone about fundraising appeals and events.
