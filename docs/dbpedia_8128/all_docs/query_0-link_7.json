        "text": "At the same time, secessionist movements—particularly in South Ossetia and Abkhazia—erupted in various parts of the country. In 1992 Abkhazia reinstated its 1925 constitution and declared independence, which the international community refused to recognize. In late 1993 Georgia joined the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), a loose confederation of former Soviet republics; following a cease-fire reached with Abkhazia in 1994, CIS peacekeepers were deployed to the region, although violence was ongoing. Georgia later signed an association agreement with the European Union, joined the Council of Europe and the World Trade Organization, and became a partner in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n\nIn 1995 a new constitution, which created a strong president, was enacted, and in November Shevardnadze was elected to that office with 75 percent of the vote, and his party, the Citizens’ Union of Georgia (CUG), won 107 of the parliament’s 231 seats. In legislative elections four years later, the CUG won an absolute majority, and in 2000 Shevardnadze was reelected president with nearly 80 percent of the vote. Accusations that he condoned widespread corruption and that his party engaged in rampant election fraud haunted Shevardnadze’s administration.\n\nRose Revolution\n\nRecent News\n\nAug. 2, 2024, 11:44 PM ET (ABC News (U.S.))\n\nUS suspends $95 million in aid to Georgia after passage of foreign agent law that sparked protests\n\nJuly 31, 2024, 7:26 AM ET (Voice of America)\n\nUS withholds $95 million in assistance from Georgian government\n\nJuly 22, 2024, 6:29 PM ET (New York Times)\n\nIn Georgia’s Depressed Heartland, Pining for the Soviet Past\n\nIn 2003 former justice minister Mikheil Saakashvili, the head of the United National Movement (UNM), lead a peaceable uprising—termed the “Rose Revolution”—that drove Shevardnadze from power. Saakashvili was elected president the following year and immediately opened a campaign against corruption, sought to stabilize the economy, and attempted to secure the country against ethnic strife.\n\nBecause of a pattern of human rights abuses and a growing sense of authoritarianism, the administration of President Saakashvili was shortly confronted by growing—if loosely knit—opposition. Journalists and international observers noted that the country’s freedom of speech practices, though protected by law, were susceptible to influence by indirect pressure tactics, and Saakashvili’s campaign against graft was criticized for its focus on the president’s opposition while corrupt practices were allowed to persist among administration associates. Highly critical of the fraud and corruption he had noted among defense officials was Irakli Okruashvili, an opponent of the administration and its onetime defense minister. During his tenure Okruashvili had made public his observation of graft so widespread among armed forces officials that the army itself had fallen into a poor state of order. In 2007 he established an opposition party, Movement for United Georgia, and appeared on Imedi TV, an independent television station, to issue a number of direct accusations against President Saakashvili.\n\nThough the statements served as a rallying point for a largely disorganized opposition, they resulted in Okruashvili’s arrest on extortion charges of his own. His televised appearance a number of days later, in which he pled guilty to the charges against him and retracted his earlier accusations, was largely held by others among Saakashvili’s opposition to be the result of duress; the circumstances under which he left the country following his release on bail were unclear.\n\nThese events contributed to the culmination of a number of points of criticism against Saakashvili and his once-popular government, providing opposition activists with the opportunity to arrange for massive demonstrations—thought perhaps to be as large as those that had previously brought Saakashvili to power—in Tbilisi in early November 2007. Though Saakashvili initially met the protests with several days’ silence, forcible measures were soon employed in breaking up the demonstrations, and it was announced that a potential coup had been thwarted. Saakashvili’s declaration of a 15-day state of emergency— criticized both locally and abroad—was quickly followed by his call for early elections in January. Though emergency rule was formally lifted a week after it had begun, Imedi TV remained off the air; ongoing demonstrations called for its return to broadcast, which finally took place approximately one month later. In late November 2007, Saakashvili resigned as president as required by law in preparation for the early elections.\n\nIn January 2008 Saakashvili was reelected, narrowly attaining the majority needed to forego a second round of voting. Although opposition groups criticized the process as flawed, the election was largely deemed free and fair by international monitors, who noted only isolated procedural violations and instances of fraud.\n\nConflict in South Ossetia\n\nMeanwhile, the simmering conflict between Georgia and its breakaway regions had returned to the fore following the 2004 election of Saakashvili, who prioritized Georgian territorial unity and the reduction of ethnic strife. Although in mid-2004 Saakashvili successfully forced the leader of the autonomous republic of Ajaria from power and returned that republic to central government control, hostilities continued in the territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Offers by Saakashvili in 2005 to discuss autonomy for South Ossetia within the Georgian state were rejected, and in late 2006 the region reiterated its desire for independence through an unofficial referendum. The ongoing conflict also exacerbated Georgia’s tense relationship with neighbouring Russia, which Georgia accused of providing support for the separatists.\n\nIn August 2008 the conflict with South Ossetia swelled sharply as Georgia engaged with local separatist fighters as well as with Russian forces that had crossed the border with the stated intent to defend Russian citizens and peacekeeping troops already in the region. In the days that followed the initial outbreak, Georgia declared a state of war as Russian forces swiftly took control of Tskhinvali, the South Ossetian capital; violence continued to spread elsewhere in the country as Russian forces also moved through the breakaway region of Abkhazia in northwestern Georgia. Georgia and Russia signed a French-brokered cease-fire that called for the withdrawal of Russian forces, but tensions continued. Russia’s subsequent recognition of the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia was condemned by Georgia and met with criticism from other members of the international community. In the midst of its hostilities with Russia, Georgia announced its intention to withdraw from the CIS and called upon other member states to do likewise; the following year Georgia formally withdrew from the association.\n\nSaakashvili continued to face domestic challenges as political tensions mounted in 2009. Opposition parties called on Saakashvili to resign, and in April a series of daily demonstrations was launched. Saakashvili pledged increased reforms and called for early elections to be held in May 2010, but he refused to step down. Although the daily protests of the spring dwindled, new demonstrations were launched toward the end of 2009, and calls for Saakashvili’s resignation persisted as political tension continued to simmer.\n\nGeorgian Dream government\n\nIn 2012 Saakashvili’s UNM faced a challenge from the newly formed opposition coalition, Georgian Dream (GD), led by billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili. Although polls showed the UNM with a strong lead several weeks before the October parliamentary elections, the party’s position was damaged in late September when the release of videos showing Georgian prison guards beating and sexually abusing prisoners provoked widespread public anger. When the election was held, the UNM came in a distant second against the GD coalition, which won 55 percent of the vote and 85 of the 150 seats in parliament. Ivanishvili became prime minister and GD quickly began investigating and arresting many former government and opposition officials on allegations of corruption. When Saakashvili’s term ended in 2013, he left the country amid threats that he too would be investigated.\n\nThe election of GD member Giorgi Margvelashvili as president in 2013 coincided with a general shift of power from the president to the ruling party in parliament. A set of constitutional changes passed in 2010 transferred significant executive authority from the president to the prime minister upon the new president’s inauguration. Ivanishvili, who as prime minister would have become the country’s top policy maker, stepped down from the premiership shortly after the 2013 presidential election, but he was widely believed to be pulling the strings behind subsequent prime ministers. He personally selected his successor, Irakli Garibashvili, who resigned in 2015 without explanation. The next prime minister, Giorgi Kvirikashvili, served until 2018, when he resigned after falling out with Ivanishvili (who had become party chairman just months before). Kvirikashvili was replaced by Mamuka Bakhtadze.\n\nIn the 2016 election GD lost popularity but gained dozens of seats—it received less than half of the popular vote but won three-fourths of the seats in parliament—spurring criticism of the country’s electoral system that splits parliamentary seats between a proportional system based on popular election and a majority system based on geographic constituency. The following year constitutional reforms that were set to take effect in 2024 transformed the electoral system to a fully proportional system and provided that the president would be elected indirectly by an electoral college consisting of members of parliament and of representatives from local governments.\n\nIn the 2018 presidential election Salome Zurabishvili, an independent candidate backed by GD, won in a runoff with 59 percent of the vote and became the country’s first female president. Days before the runoff, Bakhtadze announced that a charity run by Ivanishvili would buy the debts of 600,000 Georgians.\n\nConcerns over the GD-led government came to a head in June 2019, when a Russian legislator delivered a speech from the seat of Georgia’s parliament speaker while Georgia’s parliament building hosted an international conference of legislators from Orthodox Christian countries. Just over a decade since Russia’s invasion of Georgia and its recognition of the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, the scene outraged Georgians, who took to the streets in protest. Even after a brutal dispersal of the protesters, ordered by Interior Minister Giorgi Gakharia, further protests targeted the ruling party, demanding resignations and electoral reform. Some of these demands were conceded, including some top-level resignations and electoral reform for the 2020 parliamentary elections, but protests continued for weeks. In September Bakhtadze stepped down, saying he had fulfilled his mandate as prime minister. Ivanishvili nominated Gakharia in his stead, hailing him for his ability to manage crises. Gakharia’s government was confirmed by the parliament several days later, though the opposition boycotted the vote. In June 2020 the constitution was amended such that four-fifths of parliamentary seats in the October elections would be determined by popular vote and only one-fifth would be determined by district; the fully proportional system set for 2024 remained in place.\n\nGD regained some of its popularity in 2020 due to the government’s swift handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. When the parliamentary election was held in October, GD reproduced its 2016 performance in the popular vote but lost some 25 seats under the new electoral system. The UNM and supporters of Saakashvili, who was put forward as the UNM’s candidate for prime minister, accused GD of foul play during the election. Protests were organized to oppose the results in the weeks that followed, and the UNM and other opposition parties refused to participate in the new parliament.\n\nIn mid-February a court ordered the detention of the UNM leader, Nika Melia, for his participation in the 2019 protests. Worried that it would further polarize the country, Gakharia opposed the move and resigned as prime minister. Garibashvili, who had previously served as prime minister, was selected as his replacement on February 22, and Melia was arrested the following day.\n\nThe Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica"
