        "text": "Drilling-Down Function\n\nAn index is constructed by indicators and components, the former is the lowest level of aggregation while components are sub-indices. The drilling-down function makes it possible to explore the indicators/components included in an index while keeping the index in view. Double-click on an index's line to drill-down. You can select and unselect which of the indicators/components you want to view by clicking on the text labels to the right.\n\nConfidence Intervals\n\nV-Dem data are based on the scores of multiple coders, who sometimes diverge in their ratings. In order to deal with such divergences, we provide confidence intervals about the estimated values of each index. The confidence is illustrated by colored shadows around the lines. Larger intervals indicate greater uncertainty about the estimate.\n\nInterpreting Graphs\n\nDetails about selected indicators and indices are available in the \"Selected Indicators\" box at the bottom of the page.\n\nTip! The V-Dem Codebook includes the appendix ‘Structure of Aggregations – All Indices and Indicators’, which illustrates how indicators, components and indices are constructed and related.\n\nModel Estimates and Original Scales\n\nYou can view the V-Dem data on either the ‘model estimates’ or ‘original scale’ options. When using the default setting of ‘model estimates’ option, all indicators are rescaled allowing for comparisons, even if their initial scale is different. Indicators on their original scales can be viewed using the ‘original scale’ option.\n\nTip! When viewing many indicators in the ‘model estimates’, you can view the original scale for one indicator at a time simply by ticking the box next to the indicator.\n\nSaving a Graph\n\nSave a graph by clicking on the download sign (three-line sign) at the upper right-hand side of the grah, then select your preferred format (png, jpeg, pdf, svg). You can also export the data to a csv file. The csv file includes the original scaled numbers regardless of whether original or model estimates is selected."
