        "text": "Georgia, one of the original 13 colonies, entered the Union in January 1788. The state has participated in every presidential election except 1864 (due to secession). From 1868 thru 1960, the state was as “blue” as can be – voting Democratic in every election. Like many other southern states, its residents were conservative Democrats that went “red” in 1964 in response to unhappiness over the Civil Rights Act, which was effectively exploited by the Republicans in a tactic called the “southern strategy.” In 1968, Georgia voted for Independent George Wallace in an election that marked the last time a third-party candidate received any electoral votes.\n\nGeorgia was reliably Republican from 1972 through 2016, except when a southern Democrat was on the ticket. However, the state has become increasingly competitive and in 2020, Democrat Joe Biden won by 0.2% over Donald Trump. It was the narrowest margin of victory in the country that year."
