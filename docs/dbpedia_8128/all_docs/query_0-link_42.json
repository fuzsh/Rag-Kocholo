        "text": "Assisting the most vulnerable population in the eastern DRC\n\nIn the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, conflicts and epidemics have forced millions to leave their homes and become internally displaced – or seek refuge in neighbouring countries.\n\nHumanitarian needs are acute, with food, shelter, sanitation, and clothing topping the list.\n\nWith support from the European Union, our partner HEKS-EPER is delivering this much-needed assistance to the vulnerable populations of the eastern DRC.\n\nHEKS-EPER provides cash assistance to displaced households, as well as essential non-food items – for example, wash, sanitary and hygiene kits.\n\n“With the help of HEKS/EPER, we were able to buy food, clothes and pay our medical bills. I was also able to buy a goat for breeding. Before the war, that's what I used to do, but I lost all my livestock. Today, I'm hoping to get back into the breeding,” said a beneficiary in Rushuru, eastern DRC.\n\n“Thanks to the soaps received from the distribution, we can do our laundry and save money for our other expenses,” he adds.\n\nHe is sympathetic to those who have not received help yet: \"For those in my former situation, they can only endure, it's not easy to survive.\""
