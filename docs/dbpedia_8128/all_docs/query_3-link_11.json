        "text": "Georgia and Cora are two of my favourite names - we have similar tastes! (I also really love your first dd’s name, Anna!). I’d find it hard to choose between Cora and Georgia too.\n\nCora - pretty but not twee, short enough not to need a nn, everyone’s heard of it but not over used. Suits all ages.\n\nGeorgia - I really love this name - all the Georgia’s I know are pretty and confident women, and go by their full name (no one shortens it). It’s another really great choice.\n\nSorry, not much help but you can’t go wrong whichever you choose!\n\nCora! I have an Anna too and Cora was in the running for DC 2 (we had a boy❤️).\n\nI think they go really well together and have the same feel. It's also nicer to pronounce. I think however hard you try, you'll end up with Georgie by choosing the other.\n\nI've never ever heard Georgia pronounced with 3 syllables. It's Jor-ja, like the state or country. Georgina is 3 syllables, Jor-je-na. However, if you want to shorten to Gia I'm guessing you may be pronouncing it with 3 syllables to get that sound? I honestly think you'll have a lot of pronunciation issues if you do as every Georgia I have ever met (quite a few in the earlier years of my teaching career) has pronounced it Jor-ja.\n\nI think both sound fine with Anna but neither are as classic. Cora is a vintage name on a comeback, Georgia was quite popular in the 00s and is much less so again now. Depends what you're looking for?\n\nI'd be pronouncing Georgia with 2 syllables as is the common UK pronunciation - anything else I think would be a recipe for disaster! Was just thinking of potential alternatives to George / Georgie.\n\nFamily have a history of coming up with \"cutesy\" nicknames, mainly involving name lengthening - exactly like Georgie Porgie! So if we didn't encourage something different from the get go I know that's 100% what she'd get."
