        "text": "On 3 March 2022, Georgia applied for EU membership. On 17 June 2022, the European Commission presented its Opinions on the applications submitted by Ukraine, Georgia and the Republic of Moldova. Based on the Commission’s Opinion, Georgia was given a European perspective on 23 June 2022 by unanimous agreement between the leaders of all 27 EU Member States.\n\nThe Commission’s Opinion outlined twelve priorities which Georgia needed to address in order to progress on the path to the EU. It was complemented by Commission’s analytical report on country’s alignment with EU acquis of 2 February 2023. A more detailed review was part of the 2023 Enlargement Package reports, presented on 08 November 2023, where Georgia was included for the first time. The Commission also recommended granting candidate status to Georgia on the understanding that nine steps are taken. On 14 December 2023, Georgia was granted candidate status by the European Council, on the understanding that the relevant steps set out in the Commission recommendation of 8 November 2023 are taken.\n\nEU support to Georgia aims at improve the quality of life of Georgian citizens through an annual grant assistance of approximately €85 million, fostering tangible and visible results.\n\nEU assistance is based on strict conditionality, and is linked to satisfactory progress in reforms and the respect of the rule of law, effective democratic mechanisms and human rights.\n\nThe EU also supports Georgia with concrete investments. In the medium to long term, the EU continues to work together with Georgian authorities to implement the Economic and Investment Plan (EIP). Under the EIP, the EU has already mobilised over €1.9 billion in public and private investments, including for six flagships that have been identified together with the Georgian authorities.\n\n1a Black Sea Connectivity – Improving data connections with the EU\n\n1b Black Sea Connectivity – Improving energy connections with the EU\n\n2 Transport across the Black Sea – Improving physical connections between Georgia and the EU through feeder/ferry lines and refurbished ports\n\n3 Economic Recovery – Supporting 80,000 SMEs to reap the full benefits of the DCFTA\n\n4 Digital Connectivity for Citizens – High-speed broadband infrastructure for 1,000 rural communities\n\n5 Improved Air Quality – Helping over 1 million people in Tbilisi breathe cleaner air\n\n6 Energy Efficiency in Public Buildings"
