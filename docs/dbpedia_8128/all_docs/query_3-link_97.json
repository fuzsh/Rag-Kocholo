If your current academic record name needs to be changed, please click here to access the official Name Change Form.\n\nGeorgia Southern University currently holds commencement ceremonies at the end of Fall and Spring semesters. Candidates may walk at the Commencement ceremony only after they complete all of their coursework including internships. The only exceptions are the candidates completing in the Summer semester. Summer candidates completing all of their degree requirements at the end of Summer semester are expected to walk in the Spring (May) Commencement ceremony. Doctoral candidates who complete all requirements at the end of Summer semester are expected to walk in the Fall (December) Commencement ceremony.\n\nSpring and Summer Candidates\n\nAll candidates must submit a graduation application in WINGS by the last Friday in January if they plan to complete their graduation requirements in Spring or Summer.\n\nDoctoral Students completing during Summer semester will walk in the Fall ceremony.\n\nFall Candidates\n\nAll candidates must submit a graduation application in WINGS by the last Friday in August if they plan to complete their graduation requirements in Fall.\n\nEvery student receiving a degree must pay a graduation fee of $35.
