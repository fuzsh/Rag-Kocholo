This includes over 288,000 internally displaced persons, around 3,000 refugees and asylum-seekers and some 500 stateless persons. Most refugees and asylum-seekers are coming from Iraq, Iran, Ukraine, the Russian Federation and Egypt.\n\nIn Georgia since 1993, UNHCR has assisted populations displaced by conflicts in the 1990s and 2008. The representation continues to support the Government in implementing commitments to provide international protection for refugees and improve access to relevant services."
