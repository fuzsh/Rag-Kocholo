        "text": "The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), about the size of Western Europe, is the largest country in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). DRC is endowed with exceptional natural resources, including minerals such as cobalt and copper, hydropower potential, significant arable land, immense biodiversity, and the world’s second-largest rainforest.\n\nMost people in DRC have not benefited from this wealth. A long history of conflict, political upheaval and instability, and authoritarian rule have led to a grave, ongoing humanitarian crisis. In addition, there has been forced displacement of populations. These features have not changed significantly since the end of the Congo Wars in 2003.\n\nDRC is among the five poorest nations in the world. An estimated 74.6% of Congolese people lived on less than $2.15 a day in 2023. About one out of six people living in extreme poverty in SSA lives in DRC.\n\nPolitical Context\n\nThe country concluded general elections in December 2023, leading to a second 5-year term for incumbent President Tshisekedi, but a majority is yet to be negotiated in Parliament to form a government. Reaching political consensus, increasing the presence and credibility of the state, including through improved governance, and advancing structural reforms are key to maintaining stability and peace, attracting investments, and creating jobs.\n\nIn recent months, the security situation in North Kivu and Ituri provinces has deteriorated dramatically, with fighting between the army and armed groups forcing thousands to flee. Other pockets of insecurity have emerged in the country, notably as a result of intercommunal conflicts.\n\nEconomic Situation\n\nAfter peaking at 8.9% in 2022, real GDP growth in the DRC remained robust at 7.8% in 2023, supported by a strong mining sector, which grew by 15.4% contributing around 70% to overall growth in 2023.\n\nAgriculture production slowed to 2.2% growth in 2023 (from 2.4 % in 2022). On the demand side, growth was led by private investment and exports, while inflationary pressures caused private consumption to contract, potentially impacting poverty reduction. The current account deficit deteriorated to 6.3% of GDP in 2023, from 4.9% in 2022, owing to higher import prices. The exchange rate depreciated by 21.6 % in 2023 and inflation accelerated to 19.9 % on average in 2023 (up from 9.2% in 2022).\n\nGDP growth is expected to moderate to 6% in 2024 and to stabilize around 5.8% over 2025-26, driven by the mining sector. With the agriculture sector employing over 60% of DRC’s work force, the economy’s vulnerability to climate change-related risks (floods, droughts) is substantial. Finally, an escalating war in the East and continued political volatility could undermine the ability to advance with ambitious structural reforms efforts. To mitigate these risks, DRC’s immediate challenge is to strengthen security and maintain political and macroeconomic stability while building strong institutions to ensure sustainable growth.\n\nSocial Context\n\nDRC ranks 164 out of 174 countries on the 2020 Human Capital Index, reflecting decades of conflict and fragility, and constraining development. DRC’s Human Capital Index is 0.37 which is below the SSA average of 0.4. This means that a Congolese child born today can expect to achieve only 37% of their potential, compared to what would have been possible if they had benefited from a full, quality schooling experience and optimal health conditions. The main contributors to the low score are low child survival rates under age five, high child stunting, and low quality of education.\n\nDRC has one of the highest stunting rates in SSA (42% of children under age five), and malnutrition is the underlying cause of almost half of the deaths of children under the age of five. Unlike other African countries, the prevalence of stunting in the DRC has not decreased over the past 20 years. Due to the very high fertility rate, the number of stunted children has increased by 1.5 million.\n\nThe DRC is home to a diverse array of indigenous peoples (IPs) who have faced a range of challenges, including forced displacement from their ancestral lands, discrimination, and lack of access to basic services such as healthcare and education. Despite these challenges, IPs in the DRC continue to play an important role in preserving the country's cultural diversity and promoting sustainable resource management practices. While efforts are being made to recognize and protect the rights of IPs, much more needs to be done to ensure their full participation in society and the protection of their traditional ways of life.\n\nAccess to education has improved considerably over the past two decades, especially for girls and at earlier ages. Between 2000 and 2017, primary net enrollment increased by 50%, from 52% to 78%. However, the completion rate at the primary level remains low at 75%. The quality of education is extremely poor with an estimated 97% of 10-year-olds in DRC being in learning poverty, meaning they cannot read and understand simple text.\n\nCongolese women face significant barriers to economic opportunities and empowerment, including high rates of gender-based violence (GBV) and discrimination. Only 16.8% of women have completed secondary school—about half of the rate of completion for men. Early marriage and high fertility rates represent a challenge, where women and girls without any education have a fertility rate twice that of women who complete secondary school (7.4 children compared to 2.9 [DHS 2014]). Half of women report having experienced physical violence, and almost a third have experienced sexual violence, most commonly at the hands of an intimate partner (DHS 2013).\n\nWomen’s labor force participation rate in the DRC is estimated at almost 62%, most of whom work in agriculture. While participation is relatively high, women earn considerably less than men and own fewer assets. A 2021 DRC Gender Diagnostic Report identifies three major factors contributing to persistent and significant gender gaps: control over land, voice and agency, and risk and uncertainty including vulnerability to shocks and GBV.\n\nDRC’s health care systems have been greatly impacted by its own protracted conflict, as well as by the continued long-standing complex humanitarian crises in the world. This has been greatly exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and by recurrent disease outbreaks such as cholera, measles, and Ebola. There has been significant COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in DRC, with limited demand, and there is evidence that COVID-19 has had a negative impact on the utilization of health services since March 2020 with a decrease in hospital visits, a reduction in the number of antenatal care visits, reduced access to family planning and contraception, increased food insecurity, as well as increased incidence of sexual and GBV. Close to 23 million children missed out on routine vaccinations in 2020 due to the pandemic, the highest number in more than a decade, according to recent WHO/UNICEF data. This highlights the disruption COVID-19 has had on health systems and a concern that the temporary interruption of basic healthcare delivery will likely lead to a secondary health crisis, if not addressed.\n\nLast Updated: Apr 08, 2024\n\nEducation\n\nThe ongoing Emergency Equity and System Strengthening in Education project supports the Government of DRC’s free primary schooling policy and aims to lower the school fee burden, increase access to primary schooling in the project’s 10 targeted provinces, and strengthen core governance systems in the education sector.\n\nProject results to date include:\n\n3 million additional students enrolled in public primary schools in the 10 project provinces (3.7 million nationwide) in school year 2021-2022 compared to school year 2018/2019.\n\nNearly 77,000 primary teachers in the project provinces (almost 140,000 nationwide) were added to the payroll between 2021 and 2023 and receive a regular salary.\n\nThe revision and signature of enhanced Codes of Conduct addressing multiple forms of violence, including sexual exploitation, abuse, and harassment, by approximately 183,000 teaching personnel and foreseeing sanctions for non-compliance.\n\nA grievance mechanism known as “Allo Ecole,” anchored in the Ministry of Education systems, helps to resolve conflicts/complaints and foster accountability, including by linking survivors of Gender Based Violence to holistic services and complaint redress channels.\n\nA program to allocate school grants in an equitable manner, and merit-based recruitment program for teachers and school directors (encouraging also female participation) were developed and approved by the Ministry of Primary, Secondary and Technical Education (MEPST). These two programs are currently being piloted in three provinces, will be evaluated, and adjusted, if necessary, before being extended to all 10 project provinces.\n\nSocial protection\n\nThe DRC Eastern Recovery Project is scaling-up the coverage of the social safety net programs, including in the North Ubangi province, targeting forcibly displaced populations. To date, more than 218,000 beneficiaries have been involved in productive economic inclusion activities to strengthen their economic autonomy. The conditional cash transfers (cash for work) in urban areas have reached more than 176,000 households and the coverage will be increased to 203,000 beneficiaries during 2024. Regarding, the unconditional cash transfers in rural areas reached a coverage of more than 440,000.\n\nHealth\n\nThe ongoing Health System Strengthening for Better Maternal and Child Health Results Project (HSSP) covers 3,051 health facilities in 12 out of 26 provinces, providing primary health services to 27% of the DRC population. Since its launch in 2016, the project has had a major impact on maternal and child health, including an 80% increase in the number of women receiving at least four antenatal care visits before. Annually, more than 7.5 million people benefit from essential health, nutrition, and population services. The project has also enabled the government to implement major health system reforms.\n\nActive in 4 provinces (Kasai, Kasai Central, Kwilu and Sud-Kivu), the Multisectoral Nutrition and Health Project (MNHP) provides high-impact health services to around 20 million people through performance-based financing approaches focused on the quality of health services in 1658 primary health centers, including the rehabilitation of centers and the supply of essential medicines and equipment. The project also provides high-impact nutrition services through community-based approaches that are key to reducing stunting, an essential contribution to strengthening human capital in the country. The MNHP responded to the Government's request to support its Free Maternal and Newborn Health initiative and launched delivery of a package of free health and nutrition services focused on reducing maternal and child mortality in these four provinces in October 2023. The program will expand to cover an additional 7 provinces in April 2024.\n\nInfrastructure\n\nThe ongoing Regional Great Lakes Trade Facilitation Project has improved the border infrastructure and operating environment for small-scale traders at four locations in North and South Kivu, and supported associations for small-scale traders to continue to trade across borders during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Goma Airport Safety Improvement Project has secured the electricity supply and the enclosure of the airport, modernized air traffic control, improved the runway, and reinforced monitoring of volcano risks. The project also led to an annual increase of at least 10% of the freight and passenger traffic volumes, even during the COVID-19 period.\n\nEnergy\n\nThe Electricity Access and Service Expansion Project has successfully extended new or enhanced electricity services to over 3 million individuals. The project has facilitated the distribution of solar home systems to more than 26,000 households and supported the deployment of solar kits and lanterns by off-grid solar private operators through results-based subsidies. Additionally, the project has produced several planning studies to inform and support the formulation of the Democratic Republic of Congo's National Electrification Plan.\n\nWater\n\nUnder the World Bank Urban Drinking Water Supply Project more than 88,000 new private connections and more than 450 community waterpoints were installed, providing drinking water access to over 3 million people. The Kin Elenda Project has financed completion of the first phase of the Ozone Water Treatment Plant, which has boosted water production in Kinshasa by 110,000 cubic meters per day. The project is also financing the construction of third phase of the Ozone Water Treatment Plant, which is expected to further boost production in Kinshasa by an additional 110,000 cubic meters per day by June 2026. Support is also being provided to expand the water storage and distribution network to increase the coverage of water services to selected underserved communes of Kinshasa.\n\nUrban\n\nBetween 2013 and 2021, the Urban Development Project (UDP) improved connectivity and livability for about 390,000 persons in urban centers through upgrading of 31 kilometers of roads. The project also financed investments to stop the advancement of gully erosion in Kananga. A Kananga Emergency Urban Resilience Project was launched in June 2023 to continue the work of the UDP and lay the foundation to sustainably address the phenomenon of ‘mega gullies’ in several cities of the DRC.\n\nSocial Sustainability and Inclusion\n\nThe DRC Gender-Based Violence (GBV) Prevention and Response Project has reached more than 8.6 million beneficiaries with a variety of services and interventions ranging from community members accessing livelihoods and literacy training to GBV survivors receiving dignity kits. Over 78,000 survivors have accessed holistic GBV services (psychosocial, medical, legal, and case management) and over 60,000 beneficiaries have participated in community-level economic support interventions. Over 10,000 GBV survivors have received specialized mental health support utilizing Narrative Exposure Therapy (NET).\n\nAgriculture\n\nThe Regional Great Lakes Integrated Agriculture Development Project (PICAGL) is working to create inclusive economic opportunities for farming households, and better link inaccessible areas to markets through physical infrastructure (roads, bridges, warehouses) and access to financial support.\n\nIn DRC, about 140,000 small farmers, more than half of whom are women, have been supported to improve productivity in cassava, rice, and dairy, and also with bio-fortified crops such as beans and maize, for improved nutrition.\n\nForests and Climate Change\n\nThe ongoing Improved Forested Landscape Management Project helped establish 25,000 hectares of agroforestry plantations on degraded lands in western DRC to provide the city of Kinshasa with more sustainable charcoal and agricultural commodities. The same project also resulted in:\n\n184,000 hectares of four (4) established Local Community Forest Concessions in accordance with laws and regulation on national strategy on community forests.\n\n33 000 hectares of enclosures established and maintained to protect land areas from bush fires and facilitate natural regeneration.\n\n110,000 people in forest and adjacent communities receiving monetary and non-monetary benefits, 58,400 of which being women, saw their living conditions improved due to project interventions, with over $3 million in Payments for Ecosystem Services distributed to communities and demonstrating the potential of providing incentives for local population to effectively contribute to sustainable natural resources management. The overall household income (monetary and non-monetary) witnessed an increase by 14.7% compared to what it was before the project.\n\nThe distribution of 86,625 efficient cookstoves, contributing to better health, and overall living conditions, as well as climate benefits for communities.\n\n4 million tCO2eq emissions were reduced through the above results.\n\n775 local land use plans developed at the village level and about 252 kilometers of roads rehabilitated, including 41 bridges and 12 road culverts for enhanced market access.\n\nLast Updated: Apr 08, 2024"
