        "text": "Terrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations continue to plot possible attacks throughout Europe. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:\n\nHigh-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)\n\nHotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists\n\nPlaces of worship\n\nSchools\n\nParks\n\nShopping malls and markets\n\nPublic transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)\n\nFor more information, see our Terrorism page.\n\nAbkhazia, South Ossetia, and Adjacent Areas: The United States and most other countries consider these regions part of Georgia. However, de facto local authorities claim independence, and Russian troops and border guards occupy both regions. Attacks, criminal incidents, and kidnappings have occurred in and around the areas. While none of the activity has been anti-American in nature, there is a high risk of travelers finding themselves in a wrong place/wrong time situation. Follow the guidance in our Travel Advisory for Georgia and do not travel to these regions. If you choose to travel there, you should be aware:\n\nU.S. government employees are restricted from traveling to the Russian-occupied regions of Abkhazia or South Ossetia. We are unable to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in either territory. U.S. government employees also are restricted from traveling within five kilometers of the administrative boundary line (ABL) dividing these regions from Tbilisi-administered territory.\n\nThe administrative boundary line (ABL) of South Ossetia is not clearly marked in many places and frequently moving in other places. There is an elevated risk of wandering into South Ossetia unknowingly while hiking, particularly on the ABL’s eastern side, which could result in detention by security forces.\n\nUnexploded ordnance left over from previous conflicts pose a danger near the administrative boundary line of South Ossetia.\n\nYou may only legally enter these regions from the Georgian side, per Georgian law.\n\nYou may be arrested, detained, imprisoned, and/or fined by Russian, Georgian or de facto authorities if you enter without proper documentation.\n\nMedical services in the occupied territories are extremely limited. Hospitals do not accept credit cards or medical insurance, have little to no infectious disease control, and lack medicine.\n\nThere are no commercial airports in either region making air ambulance evacuations impossible during medical emergencies.\n\nIt is illegal to undertake any type of economic activity in Abkhazia or South Ossetia that requires permits, licenses, or registration, per Georgian law. Laws also ban mineral exploration, money transfers, and international transit via Abkhazia or South Ossetia.\n\nPankisi Gorge: The Department of State cautions U.S. citizens against travel to the Pankisi Gorge region (north of the villages of Matane and Chorale, to the border with Russia, including the city of Duisk) because of the current security environment and the potential for civil unrest. There are restrictions on U.S. Embassy personnel traveling to this region or within five kilometers of it. While the Georgian government has had success in combating terrorism within its borders, U.S. citizens should remain vigilant. ISIS recruiting has occurred in Pankisi in the past, and some known terrorists have confirmed ties to the Pankisi Gorge region.\n\nCrime: Criminals may target foreigners. Take precautions against becoming a victim of crime as you would in any large city.\n\nFirearms are readily available in Georgia, assailants may be armed, and disputes with firearms could occur.\n\nAlcohol consumption is prevalent and has been attributed to escalating or exacerbating otherwise minor disputes.\n\nCarrying pocket knives or other cutting devices in Georgia is illegal under most circumstances. You may be detained or cited if found in violation.\n\nThere has been an increase in reports of “confidence scams” where a traveler who orders drinks or food in a bar or restaurant is presented with a bill for exorbitantly high sums and then physically threatened if they do not pay. These are sometimes combined with “romance scams” wherein a traveler is taken to these establishments by someone they met online through a dating or other social meetup site.\n\nU.S. and other visitors have reported occurrences of sexual assault in Georgia.\n\nAvoid walking alone at night.\n\nExercise caution when riding alone in private taxis or “marshrutka” mini buses.\n\nMaintain a low profile, do not carry large amounts of cash, and do not draw unnecessary attention to yourself.\n\nUse caution at ATMs, and always check for skimming devices or other tampering.\n\nAvoid using public WIFI networks or internet terminals as they did not protect your data or personal information.\n\nForeign visitors report having items stolen from locked hotel rooms. Review additional information on crime threats in the Overseas Security Advisory Council (OSAC) Georgia Country Security Report.\n\nDemonstrations occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, and during international events.\n\nDemonstrations can be unpredicatable, avoid areas around protests and demonstrations.\n\nCheck local media for updates and traffic advisories.\n\nSecurity alerts about demonstrations can be found on the Embassy’s website here.\n\nInternational Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information.\n\nVictims of Crime: U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. Report crimes to the local police by dialing 112, and contact the U.S. Embassy in Tbilisi at (+ 995) (32) 227-7724 (after hours + 995 32 227-7000).\n\nThe Georgian Ministry of Internal Affairs (MOIA) operates a 24-hour emergency response center similar to 911 (dial 112) and transfers emergency calls to the fire and rescue service, police, or the nearest medical emergency center. Most dispatchers speak only Georgian and Russian but will transfer calls to English-speaking operators.\n\nRemember that the local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes. The U.S. Embassy has no law enforcement or legal authority overseas, nor can it investigate crimes in Georgia. U.S. embassy staff are prohibited by federal regulation from acting as agents, attorneys, or in a fiduciary capacity on behalf of U.S. citizens involved in legal disputes overseas.\n\nSee our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas.\n\nWe can:\n\nHelp you find medical care\n\nAssist you in reporting a crime to the police\n\nContact relatives or friends with your written consent\n\nProvide general information regarding the victim’s role during the local investigation and following its conclusion\n\nProvide a list of local attorneys\n\nProvide our information on victim’s compensation programs in the United States\n\nProvide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution\n\nHelp you find accommodation and arrange flights home\n\nReplace a stolen or lost passport\n\nDomestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance. Local resources for victims of domestic violence, sexual abuse, or human trafficking include a hotline dial 116-006), temporary shelters, medical and rehabilitation services, interpretation and legal assistance. These may be available through a government agency known as Atipfund Georgia.\n\nTourism: The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities are not routine. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified by host government orby recognized authorities in the field. . In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage.\n\nPersonal Safety in Remote Areas: If you intend to camp, climb, or hike in the mountains or any remote area in Georgia:\n\nResearch local conditions in advance.\n\nGo with a companion or a group. Avoid traveling alone.\n\nProvide route and contact information to someone not traveling with you.\n\nMaintain communication with your family and friends.\n\nIf in trouble, call the emergency number 112. Most dispatchers speak Georgian and Russian but will transfer calls to English-speaking operators.\n\nIn the case of a crisis or natural disaster, U.S. citizens in Georgia may check the Embassy’s website for U.S. Embassy emergency messages, or receive them by email by signing up for the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP).\n\nCriminal Penalties: You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be fined, arrested, deported, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or praticing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.\n\nIf arrested, you may be held in pre-trial detention for up to nine months. Review the State Department’s page on Arrests or Detention of U.S Citizens Abroad.\n\nFurthermore, some lawsare also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website.\n\nArrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our webpage for further information.\n\nNotification to U.S. Embassy Tbilisi of the arrest of U.S. citizens is typically significantly delayed in Georgia. In addition, the Georgian police have the authority under the Administration Violation Code to detain individuals for up to 24 hours without court intervention and 48 hours with court approval (this is referred to as “administrative detention”). There are no due process rights assigned during an administrative hold, meaning the person has no right to counsel.\n\nSpecial Circumstances: Georgia has strict regulations concerning:\n\nPossession, use, or trafficking in illegal drugs in accordance with Georgian laws and controlled substance classifications. Penalties are severe and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines.\n\nThe import or export of alcohol, tobacco, jewelry, religious materials, art or artifacts, antiquities, and business equipment.\n\nExport of items of historical value, such as artwork, antiques, jewelry, or paintings. You must obtain a license. Contact the Embassy of Georgia or see our customs regulations webpage.\n\nFirearms cannot be imported into Georgia.\n\nGeorgian law prohibits the sale of real property (land and houses) in the occupied regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Prior owners may have the right to reclaim the property in the future.\n\nCounterfeit and Pirated Goods: Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. If you attempt to bring counterfeit or pirated goods into the United States you may incur a fine or have the items seized. See the U.S. Customs and Border Protection website for more information.\n\nFaith-Based Travelers: See the following webpages for details:\n\nFaith-Based Travel Information\n\nInternational Religious Freedom Report – see country reports\n\nLGBTQI+ Travelers: There are no legal restrictions on consensual same-sex sexual conduct or the organization of LGBTQI+ events in Georgia. However, traditional cultural attitudes result in LGBTQI+ individuals often facing discrimination and harassment. Some LGBTQI+ persons in Georgia have been targets of attacks. In addition, violent anti-LGBTQI+ protests have occurred in Tbilisi, including in response to public LGBTQI+ related events.\n\nSee our LGBTQI+ travel information page and section 6 of the Department of State’s Human Rights report for further details.\n\nTravelers with Disabilities: Georgian law prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual, or mental disabilities, but the government does not enforce the law effectively. In July 2020, Georgia adopted legislation on the rights of persons with disabilities that establishes principles to guide the government’s implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The government has until this year (2023) to develop an implementation action plan and 15 years to complete accessibility of government buildings, infrastructure, and services. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities is not as prevalent as in the United States. Expect accessibility to be limited or nonexistent in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure.\n\nStudents: See our Students Abroad page and FBI travel tips.\n\nWomen Travelers: See our travel tips for Women Travelers\n\nFor emergency services in Georgia, dial 112 (the equivalent of 911 in the United States)\n\nAmbulance services are not widely available outside Tbilisi and training and availability of emergency responders may fall below U.S. standards. Ambulances are not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment. Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.\n\nLimited Medical Services in Rural Areas: In the event of injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage.\n\nWe do not pay for medical bills. Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.\n\nMedical Insurance: Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most health care providers in Georgia only accept cash payments. See our webpage for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.\n\nWe strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.\n\nAlways carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the Ministry of Health to ensure the medication is legal in Georgia. Georgia strictly regulates types and quantities of prescription medications that may be brought into the country. Travelers carrying prohibited prescription drugs have been detained and face heavy fines or arrest.\n\nVaccinations: Be up-to-date on all vaccinations recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy maintains a list of English-speaking doctors and hospitals in Georgia. We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.\n\nFurther health information:\n\nWorld Health Organization\n\nU.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\n\nAir Quality: Visit AirNow for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates. Air pollution is a significant problem in Tbilisi. Consider the impact seasonal smog and heavy particulate pollution may have on you and consult your doctor before traveling, if necessary. Georgia has installed and maintains air quality monitors around the country. Real-time data is available at: https://air.gov.ge/en/.\n\nHealth Facilities in General:\n\nAdequate healthcare facilities are available in Tbilisi, although below U.S. standards. Outside major cities, medical facilities in Georgia are limited.\n\nHospitals and doctors may require payment “up front” prior to service or admission. Credit card payment is not always available.\n\nMedical staff may speak little or no English.\n\nAssisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy:\n\nIf you are considering traveling to Georgia to have a child through use of assisted reproductive technology (ART) or surrogacy, please see our ART and Surrogacy Abroad page.\n\nThe Georgian government has announced it intends to pass legislation that would ban surrogacy for foreigners starting January 1, 2024. Breaking the law will be a criminal offense. Currently, the law is in draft form and several issues related to surrogacy services, including if and how pre-existing contracts with ART facilities and surrogates in Georgia would be honored, will not be known until the law is passed. You might not be able to receive a refund if you enter into a contract for surrogacy services. Babies born through illegal arrangements might be prevented from leaving Georgia. Before you commit to a surrogacy arrangement, seek independent legal advice. A list of local attorneys in Georgia who have expressed interest in assisting U.S. citizens can be found on Embassy Tbilisi’s website.\n\nAdventure Travel: Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about Adventure Travel.\n\nOther:\n\nTravelers with existing health problems may be at risk due to inadequate medical facilities.\n\nThere is a significant risk of rabies in Georgia. The CDC recommends some travelers complete the rabies vaccine series prior to arriving in country.\n\nSome spices made in Georgia contain high levels of lead. Consider purchasing spices only from recognized U.S. or international manufacturers.\n\nGeorgia has a high rate of Hepatitis C. Exercise caution if you plan to get a tattoo, piercing, dental work, or other procedure with potential for blood exposure. Ensure the provider uses proper sterilization procedures.\n\nEnsure food is cooked thoroughly to reduce the risk of food-borne illness.\n\nGeorgia has eight venomous snake species that are active between March and October. Few medical facilities have antivenin serum. Treat all snakes as potentially venomous.\n\nTuberculosis is prevalent in Georgia.
