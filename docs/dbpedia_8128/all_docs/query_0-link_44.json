        "text": "Because of its size, natural resource, and geo-political importance, the DRC has the potential to become a top contributor to African economic growth and stability. Strategically located at the center of the African continent and sharing borders with nine countries, the DRC is the second largest country in Africa with the fourth largest population. Its unparalleled natural resource wealth includes cobalt, copper, gold, tantalum, tin, diamonds, petroleum, and water. However, corruption, weak institutions and a lack of human capacity and basic infrastructure have impeded development.\n\nSince DRC’s independence in 1960, USAID has partnered with the government and people to improve Congolese citizens’ quality of life, increase the effectiveness of national institutions, and strengthen the foundation for durable peace in eastern DRC."
