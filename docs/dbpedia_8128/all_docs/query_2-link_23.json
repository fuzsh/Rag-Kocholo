        "text": "Despite months of antigovernment protests, Georgia’s ruling party still enjoys support among the older generation.\n\nYoung demonstrators fight on ahead of October elections in a bid to exhaust the administration behind the measure.\n\nLaw obliges organisations getting over 20 percent of funding from overseas to register as ‘agents of foreign influence’.\n\nThe NGOs say they’re ready to pay penalties under ‘the Russian law … which nobody will obey’.\n\nCritics say the bill will restrict media freedom and obstruct Georgia’s chances of joining the European Union.\n\nPresident Salome Zourabichvili says the law is ‘Russian in its essence’, but parliament is expected to overturn veto.\n\nThe ‘Russia law’ will make it hard for Georgia to join European Union, argue protesters, the US and Baltic states.\n\nThe measure, described as authoritarian and Russian inspired, was approved despite warnings from the EU and the US.\n\nPolice in Tbilisi crack down on protesters as tens of thousands rally to oppose a controversial ‘foreign influence’ bill\n\nThe bill requires organisations receiving more than 20 percent of their funding from abroad to register as foreign agents.\n\nProtesters angry at gov’t efforts to pass law against ‘foreign agents’ which mirrors repressive Russian legislation."
