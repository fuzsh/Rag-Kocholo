Gerald Green has signed a non-guaranteed deal with the Milwaukee Bucks, according to The Vertical's Shams Charania.

Green, 31, is coming off his second stint with the Boston Celtics. Signed to a one-year, $XX million deal last offseason, he played in 47 regular season games, averaging 5.6 points off the bench. He shot 35.1 percent from three-point range.

His biggest on-court contribution came in the postseason. With the Celtics down 2-0 to the Chicago Bulls, Brad Stevens inserted Green into the starting lineup in place of Amir Johnson. The move helped turn the Celtics' fortunes around as the squad won its next six games and made it to the Eastern Conference Finals.

However, his time in Boston went beyond on-court production. Unlike his high-flying days to start his NBA career with the Celtics, Green played a more complementary role for the C's this time around and brought a positive veteran presence to the squad. He still showed off his impressive verticality as well as his affinity for hot chocolate.

Beyond a strong demand for hot beverages, Green can bring his experience to help a young Bucks squad, which just lost Jason Terry to the Minnesota Timberwolves. Green played on the same team as Bucks head coach Jason Kidd on the 2008-2009 Dallas Mavericks, so there is some familiarity there.

The last we heard from Green this offseason, he was driving around his hometown of Houston helping victims of Hurricane Harvey.

As for the Celtics, re-signing Green would have been a nice continuation for a squad with so much turnover. However, they should be covered with veteran leadership and will have the roster flexibility to add someone on the cheap in the next few months.
