        "text": "Veteran guard Gerald Green worked out for the Rockets this week, Kelly Iko of The Athletic tweets. They also took a look at another longtime NBA guard, Monta Ellis, Rockets insider Alykhan Bijani tweets.\n\nGreen, 35, did not play in the league last season. He was invited to the Rockets training camp but was waived. He missed all of the previous season with a broken foot.\n\nGreen was a regular rotation player for the Rockets during the 2019-20 season, appearing in 73 games. He also appeared in 11 playoff games that season.\n\nIn 658 career regular-season games, Green averaged 9.7 PPG.\n\nEllis, who has been out of the league since 2017, also worked out for the Mavericks this week. During his 833 career regular-season games, Ellis averaged 17.8 PPG. The Pacers used the stretch provision to distribute Ellis’ remaining salary after his last NBA season and he’s still on their books for $2.245 million. Ellis turns 36 next month.\n\nThe Rockets have 18 players on standard contracts, including 14 guaranteed deals, so it would be surprising if the rebuilding club signed either player."
