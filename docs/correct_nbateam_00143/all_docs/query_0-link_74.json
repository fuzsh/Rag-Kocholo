        "text": "As the NBA preseason marches on, Ball Don't Lie looks at all 30 teams, outlining off-season transactions, projecting win totals, spinning tracks, and much, much more. It's a fun, hot mess. Today, finally heading West, the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nLast Season: 51-31; lost in the first round of playoffs to Hornets\n\nKey Players Added: DeSagana Diop (free agent), Gerald Green (free agent), hot dogs, ketchup\n\nKey Players Lost: Juwan Howard (free agent), Tyronn Lue (free agent), All-Star Jamaal Magloire (free agent), Malik Allen (free agent)\n\nKelly Dwyer's Endless Grey Ribbon: The Mavericks are deep, if you don’t count production and talent and only count names that you’ve heard of. Devean George. Shawne Williams. Jose Barea. Antoine Wright. Gerald Green and James Singleton. The Mavericks have long been averse to handing a high rotation spot to guys who haven’t already made their way across NBA.com a few times, and that doesn’t figure to stop now with Rick Carlisle as head coach.\n\nWhy? Rick Carlisle is about the most risk-averse guy you can think of. I think. The guy doesn’t care if Michael Curry is getting beat on defense and giving your three points and two rebounds in 30 minutes, he just wants to see Curry trying on defense, and doing enough offensively to allow Carlisle to say to himself, “well, he’s not out there for his offense!”\n\nUgh. He’s been successful at it, but he’s also had great teams to surround these Currys with.\n\nI don’t doubt that Avery Johnson was on the outs in the Maverick locker room. The guy started Maurice Ager, after all. But while the Mavs might be after a new perspective with Rick Carlisle at the helm, they might be in for a shock. They might be in for more of the same.\n\nUnless that’s what Mark Cuban is after. Hmm. More on that in a second.\n\nYou see, like Avery, Carlisle plays a small rotation. He doesn’t like to run. Sure, he ran a bit in his final year in Indiana, but that was because he knew he wouldn’t last the season if he didn’t cede to Larry Bird’s wishes on that front. Carlisle plays plucky guys he can depend on, even if they don’t score, rebound, assist, block shots, or play overwhelming defense.\n\nCarlisle, like Avery, ended his time at his first head coaching stop when it became apparent that both the locker room and front office alike were at odds with the head coach. Even though the head coach was just months removed from winning the Coach of the Year award. Carlisle and Avery’s brusque manner both tend to rub people the wrong way.\n\nCarlisle seems to be as close to an Avery Johnson clone as one can put together, to these eyes. But maybe that’s what Cuban wants.\n\nThink about it. Cuban probably knows that a Carlisle/Avery-type coach is the best lead man to get through to his roster. And he also knows that Carlisle/Avery-types tend to wear on teams after a few years. So when one Avery-type wears out his welcome, bring in a Carlisle-type, fresh as a daisy! That buys you another two years or so, you get some top-notch coaching in the meantime (nobody is doubting either coach’s skills), and you get the best bang for your personnel buck. Brilliant.\n\nThe problem I see is not in the hiring of Carlisle, but in this roster. I just don’t think it has enough to consistently battle with the Hornets, Jazz, Lakers, Rockets, and Spurs once San Antonio gets Manu back. Five incredible teams. Five championship-level teams. Those are tough outs, and three of those teams are in Dallas’ division. Ouch.\n\nWorse? Dirk is 30. He’s at, or a little behind (you make the call, I’ve privately, and ruefully, made mine) his peak. Josh Howard will be 29 at the start of the playoffs, and he’s at his peak. Assuming that matters to him. Jason Kidd is 35, Erick Dampier is 33, Jason Terry is 31 (I know shooters like JET can hold up, but still …), Jerry Stackhouse is an old 34 in November, and no amount of two-handed Brandon Bass slams or solid D from Antoine Wright can make up for this. Age matters. Age ain’t nothing but a number for Jose Barea, but height is.\n\nAnd the worry, as it always is with Carlisle, is who his pet will be. I like James Singleton, but not for more than a few minutes at a time. Who knows if Carlisle will fall in love with his game? Or what if it’s (shudder, sorry) Devean George? It won’t be Williams or Gerald Green, we know that, and what if Kidd continues to slide? He couldn’t stay in front of Chris Paul last April, so what’s he going to be doing next April?\n\nThis doesn’t mean Dallas won’t look like world-beaters at times this year, because they will be terrific for spells. They have enough to beat the teams I listed above, working those outfits’ best, even on the road.\n\nBut they don’t have enough to do it consistently. And they don’t have enough to stop from being surprised a bit at home. And the new perspective, as we discussed, is just more of the same. It will be effective, but it’s just more of the same with T-minus two years until the rancor sets in again.\n\nExpected Record: 46-36\n\nLolnbaz:\n\nDirk Nowizki's Career, Guitar Hero-ized:\n\n• When You Were Young You Played Handball — The Killers\n\n• My Name is Dirkus — Weezer\n\n• Rock and Roll and Fadeaway Jumpers All Nite — Kiss\n\n• Slow Stride — Foghat\n\n• Talk Dirty to Me — Poison\n\n• La Canadian — ZZ Top\n\n• Paint It Green — The Rolling Stones\n\n• Game 3 Sabotage — Beastie Boys\n\n• Holiday in Australia — Dead Kennedys\n\n• Cult of Personality — Living Colour\n\n• Raining Threes — Slayer\n\n• Suck My MVP — Red Hot Chili Peppers\n\n• Devil Went Down to Golden State — Charlie Daniels Band\n\n• Anarchy in the Mavericks Locker-room — The Sex Pistols\n\n• Hit Me with Your Best Shot, David West — Pat Benetar\n\n• The Championship Seeker — The Who\n\nReal Talk, Blog Talk (aka excerpts from other blogger team previews):\n\nMavs Moneyball: \"While the perception is that the Mavs have fallen from elite status, a look at the roster shows that this is more perception than reality. The Mavs core group of players is still the same, with the glaring exception of Jason Kidd, and it is distinctly possible that Carlisle can find a way to utilize Kidd's court vision and size on offense in a way that Johnson could not. Still the team is one year older and still have playoff demons in their past. The goal of the team is certainly to win the championship this year, although I believe that they feel that the fight to do so will be harder than in the past, a past where they failed to reach the top any way.\"\n\nDeadspin: \"It's doubtful that Nowitzki will suddenly transmogrify into the big game player the Mavs want and need him to be. It's even more doubtful that Kidd has gotten any younger over the summer. Ditto for Jerry Stackhouse. They're still \"90-pound physicist getting sand kicked in his face at the beach\" weak at the center position. Mark Cuban is still liable to shoot the team in the foot by shooting off his mouth. The team has so much mental baggage at this point, it's hard to imagine them ever overcoming it short of a major roster overhaul. They inexplicably re-signed Devean George.\"\n\nSerious Hoops Blog: \"The Dallas Mavericks have never been the same since they blew that 2-0 lead in the NBA Finals in 2006. This season will be the same as the last two seasons because they are not mentally strong. They have not made any significant changes that make them a better team than LA, New Orleans, Phoenix, San Antonio, or Portland.\"\n\nDeSagana Diop Wants To See You In A Bill Utter Ford ...
