        "text": "Chris Chambers/Getty Images\n\nThe New Jersey Nets are having a rough 2011-12 NBA season and face a free-agency question regarding Deron Williams heading into Brooklyn next season.\n\nHowever, the Nets may have found another young player who has been eager to prove that he belongs in the NBA. That player is none other than Gerald Green, a former member of the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nGreen had been spending time with the Los Angeles Defenders of the D-League (and did spend time with the Los Angeles Lakers in the preseason) before getting called up by the Nets. After two ten-day contracts, the Nets decided to keep Green for the remainder of this season as well as next season.\n\nGreen was drafted right out of high school by the Boston Celtics in the first round of the 2005 NBA Draft. However, Green was never given the opportunity to show that he could expand his game, as injuries and lack of experience kept him sidelined in Boston.\n\nGreen was then traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves as part of the Kevin Garnett deal, although he never got a chance to showcase his skills with the Timberwolves.\n\nSeparate stints in both Houston (was waived by the team) and Dallas gave Green another chance to show that he has improved his game, but he was viewed as being rather raw.\n\nGreen never gave up on playing in the NBA and has been playing much better with New Jersey. He has been averaging 11.5 points in 19 games with the Nets and has taken the league by storm with his amazing dunks.\n\nWith the opportunity to play more minutes, Green can look to expand his game and show that he deserves a role on the team next season. If Green can do this, there will be more interest in the former high school phenom."
