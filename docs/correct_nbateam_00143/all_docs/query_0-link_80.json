        "text": "Green hasn't appeared in an NBA game in more than two-and-a-half years, as he last played with the Houston Rockets during the 2019 Western Conference Semifinals against the Golden State Warriors. Green re-signed with Houston in July 2019, but underwent surgery to fix a broken bone in his left foot that October and missed the entire 2019-2020 campaign.\n\nGreen was traded to the Denver Nuggets in February 2020, was later waived by the club and then re-signed with the Rockets in December 2020. He was waived two weeks later, announced his retirement in October 2021 and joined Houston's staff as a player development coach.\n\nThe 35-year-old was selected by the Boston Celtics with the 18th overall pick in the 2005 NBA Draft and spent the first two seasons of his career with the team. Green earned the 2007 NBA Slam Dunk Contest crown and was traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves with four players including Al Jefferson, as well as a pair of 2009 first-round draft picks, in exchange for Kevin Garnett in July 2007.\n\nGreen played in just 30 games the following season -- 29 with the Timberwolves and one with the Rockets after a February 2008 trade. Green was waived by Houston in March 2008, signed with the Dallas Mavericks that July, and played 38 games with Dallas during the 2008-2009 season.\n\nThe Houston, Texas, native spent the next two seasons playing overseas, before spending the next eight NBA seasons with the then-New Jersey Nets, Indiana Pacers, Phoenix Suns and Miami Heat, as well as a second stint with both the Celtics and Rockets. Green set career-highs in points (15.8), rebounds (3.4), assists (1.5) and minutes per game (28.4) with the Suns in the 2013-2014 campaign, while shooting a career-best 40.0% on three-pointers as well."
