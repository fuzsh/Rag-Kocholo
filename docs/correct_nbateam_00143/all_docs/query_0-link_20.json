        "text": "The Dallas Mavericks don't have a potential playoff slot to compete for at this point in the season, so the rest of their 2016-17 campaign is more or less an exercise in publicity (and tanking).\n\nTo help with both the publicity and the tanking, the Mavericks announced their plans to bring in former Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo on a one-day contract. Romo, according to ESPN's Marc Stein, will actually sit on the team's bench in uniform on Tuesday in Dallas' final home game of the season against the Denver Nuggets.\n\nThe online basketball community mostly reacted with amusement to the news. After all, losses can only help the Mavericks at this point, since the team won enough games to fall to No. 9 in lottery odds but remains within striking distance of the No. 7 slot. Bringing in Romo is a funny gesture that will ensure plenty of eyeballs on their final game, as well as (more than likely) plenty of Mavericks Romo jerseys sold.\n\nBoston Celtics wing Gerald Green hasn't gotten much time on the court this season, playing in 46 of Boston's 80 games to date. He weighed in on Romo's signing after the Celtics' win over Charlotte on Saturday.\n\nGreen has played in 57.5 percent of Boston's games. By our very exact and in-no-way flawed math and reasoning, Romo has a 57.5 percent chance of appearing in the Mavericks' final game.\n\nFor the sake of the Twitter responses that Romo getting actual NBA minutes would generate, let's hope both Green and our super advanced math are correct."
