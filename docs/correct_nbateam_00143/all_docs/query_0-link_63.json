        "text": "Since entering the league in early 2005, Gerald Green has always been known as a high-flying act and he still is today. But Gerald wants to be known as more than just one-dimensional, he wants to establish a home and be known as an all-around player. Hard to shed the label when all the highlights you see from him are his head above the rim. The former member of the Boston Celtics, Minnesota Timberwolves, Houston Rockets, Dallas Mavericks, Russia, China, LA Lakers, D-League, then New Jersey Nets, Indiana Pacers hopes to have established a proper home with his current team the Phoenix Suns. No matter what team he played for or what jerseys heâ€™s worn, the journeyman put up an act for the ages."
