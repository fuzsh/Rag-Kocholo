        "text": "Confidence gets Gerald Green over tough obstacles\n\nBeing shuffled through 10 teams over nine years on three continents could have bothered Gerald Green if he had not been cut from his high school freshman and sophomore teams.\n\nBeing released by a Chinese team after four games could have irreparably devastated Green if he had not been through so much worse in his youth, when his grandparents died in a murder-suicide when he was 15 and he lost most of his right ring finger when he was 11.\n\nGreen has as much bounce in his comeback as he does off the floor, where the dunk artist has turned into an integral player on a successful team for the first time since he left a Houston alternative high school for the pros in 2005.\n\nSpend any time with Green and you quickly come to learn about his unwavering confidence, especially because his volume level from the practice court to the locker room to games will let it be known. It required a blind confidence in himself to overcome a steeplechase of life obstacles.\n\n\"Even before I made my high school team, I'd say I want to be a NBA player, and people laughed at me with, 'Get out of here, you ain't going to be a NBA player. You don't even play basketball,' \" Green said. \"I'd say, 'Yes, I do. I play at the park.' Then they'd talk even more, like, 'You hear this kid? He thinks he's going to be in the league.' I know this sounds arrogant or cocky or like I'm selling myself, but even on the court now, I don't think anybody can stop me. I just have that much confidence.\"\n\nA 'bad' kid\n\nGreen's mother had four kids but had to stop working because her second-oldest, Gerald, frequently was up to no good.\n\nHe was not a delinquent, but the restless energy and active mouth that make him amiable today were trouble then.\n\nHe ran his mouth to students and teachers. He ran southeast Houston's streets, chasing dogs, hopping fences, playing midnight basketball and tackle football on concrete.\n\n\"I wasn't a menace to society, but I was active and I was bad,\" Green said.\n\nGreen always thought he could be the best at any competition, whether it was a video game or hide-and-seek. One day when he was 11, the challenge was to jump and touch the ledge above a hallway door at home. Unfortunately for Green, he could.\n\nHe was wearing his mother's class ring. When he slapped the door ledge, the ring got caught on a nailhead and ripped off the skin and tendons above his right ring finger's lower knuckle.\n\n\"I was hanging on the nail for a split second,\" Green said. \"Have you seen 'Terminator 2' when he cut off his hand and you see nothing but the inside? That's how it was. It was nothing but white bone.\"\n\nGreen's father, a firefighter, made the decision during surgery to have the finger removed above the lower knuckle because the lack of feeling or movement in it could affect him in sports.\n\n\"I was devastated,\" Green said. \"I think about it every day. I didn't cry when it happened. I cried after I woke up from surgery and saw that my finger was gone. I was looking at my hand, going, 'Where the hell is my finger at?' \"\n\nThe finger nub became the source of fights because of his sensitivity about it and his dad's advice to always hit back. He said he would not even discuss it until three years ago when he realized he could inspire people with his story, one in which that was just the first hurdle.\n\n'I know you can do it'\n\nGreen's basketball career would have never happened if he accepted the first rejection. He was cut from the freshman team at Dobie High.\n\nBefore his sophomore year, his grandmother gave him a letter, handwritten in cursive.\n\nGreen was close to his ailing paternal grandparents because he would go to their nearby house three or four times a week. The letter was about how much potential Green had to do better because he was not applying himself.\n\n\"I know you can do it,\" she wrote in cursive. \"I think you should try out for basketball again.\"\n\nLess than two weeks later, Herman and Winifred Green died in a murder-suicide in which Herman shot his wife and took his own life.\n\n\"It was like she knew something was going to happen, and she wrote that in case something did,\" Green said.\n\nGreen was cut again as a sophomore but was added to the sophomore team after the death of a player who collapsed on the court due to a heart defect. He moved to junior varsity before the season was over and varsity as a junior before transferring to Gulf Shores Academy to repeat his junior season.\n\nThe strip-mall school no longer exists. Green said college recruiters would not even come to the campus, where he said he saw students with guns and drugs, pregnant girls fighting and a student cut on the face with a razor.\n\n\"It was not a place you woke up wanting to go,\" Green said.\n\nThe basketball was the only good part, and he was getting noticed. He became a McDonald's All-American and committed to Oklahoma State but declared for the draft in 2005, the last year high schoolers could do so. Boston selected him at No. 18, and he drew little fanfare beyond winning the 2007 Slam Dunk Contest.\n\n\"I don't know if that was healthy for him, to be honest,\" said Clippers coach Doc Rivers, who was Boston's coach at the time. \"He was just so young to handle all the stuff. You look at Rory McIlroy when he won and got all the endorsements. It's tough to keep your focus. A little bit of that hurt Gerald, but he's always been a good kid so you always hoped he'd figure it out. He had to go to Russia to figure it out, and he did. He's still really young. It's amazing. You'd think with all the stuff he's been through, he'd be 35. He's young (28) and getting better every night.\"\n\nA basketball nomad\n\nBoston is the only team that has kept him beyond one season. He has been traded three times and played on two Russian teams.\n\n\"I'm really happy for Gerald,\" said Portland coach Terry Stotts, an assistant for Dallas when Green played there in 2008.\n\n\"I didn't know if he'd be able to stick it out in Russia, and he did. He loves to play. It didn't work out in Dallas, but he left a good memory with everybody.\"\n\nNothing threatened his career and that reputation like getting cut in China after four games.\n\n\"I thought, 'Damn, nobody's going to give me a chance,' \" Green said. \"I got cut from the CBA. When I went to the D-League after that, I felt like that was my last rope. Everything was falling apart. I had the same bills, and my checks weren't as big. Most people wouldn't go play for crumbs. You're riding buses and rooming with people, going from Ritz Carltons to Motel 6s. That sucks.\"\n\nGreen said he would have gone to college had he known his career would play out like it has, but he has found his utopia in Phoenix. In Indiana last season, Green said his usually strong confidence had been stripped because he felt like he could not miss a shot without being pulled. In Phoenix, Suns coach Jeff Hornacek emboldened Green to shoot more but also has been proud of how Green has found other ways to score in transition, post-ups and midrange shots when his 3-pointers are not falling.\n\n\"He's found the right coach,\" said Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle, who had Green in Dallas.\n\nAt 28, his play as a fill-in starter for injuries to Goran Dragic and Eric Bledsoe saved the season, and he went from a trade toss-in to a commodity under a good contract for $3.5 million next season. Even with only 46 starts, Green is fourth in the NBA for made 3-pointers and is averaging a career-high 15.9 points. It is his biggest basketball role since high school.\n\nThat unwavering confidence was not misplaced.\n\n\"People could tell me I was not good at something and, even if I wasn't, I told myself I was,\" Green said.\n\n\"I've got a lot left in the tank. I feel like I still have so much more to give, but it's on me to give it. I can't get satisfied.\"\n\nUp next\n\nGrizzlies at Suns\n\nWhen: Monday at 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: US Airways Center.\n\nTV/radio: FSAZ/KTAR-AM (620), KPKX-FM (98.7).\n\nGrizzlies update: Memphis beat the Suns without Marc Gasol three times this season, including once without Zach Randolph, too. The Grizzlies' grinding style wore out Phoenix each time, particularly by Memphis' strengths on the boards and defense. Point guard Mike Conley also has been brilliant in the series, averaging 20 points and nine assists against the Suns. The Grizzlies were 15-19 this season until their season flipped with their previous victorious visit to Phoenix on Jan. 10.\n\nREMAINING REGULAR-SEASON SCHEDULE\n\nSuns at Kings\n\nWednesday 7:30 p.m.\n\nTV: FSAZ | Radio: 98.7 FM, KSUN 1400AM"
