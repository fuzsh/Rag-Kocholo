        "text": "The Houston Rockets on Tuesday announced their broadcast information for the upcoming 2023-24 NBA season.\n\nThe newly announced Space City Home Network (SCHN) will broadcast the entire 82-game schedule, along with four preseason games. Fans can watch SCHN on the same channels as the team’s prior network, AT&T SportsNet, without needing to take any action.\n\nThe Rockets’ entire television broadcast team returns from last season. That includes Craig Ackerman handling play-by-play duties; Ryan Hollins providing color commentary; and Vanessa Richardson serving as the sideline reporter.\n\nHall of Famer Calvin Murphy is back for pregame and postgame shows alongside Kevin Eschenfelder. Joining that duo for select games will be Houston native Gerald Green, a former Rockets guard.\n\nAll games will be available on the radio broadcast home of the Rockets, Houston’s SportsTalk 790 KBME and NewsRadio 740 KTRH. They will be aired in Spanish on TUDN 93.3 FM.\n\nMatt Thomas continues as the lead voice of English radio broadcasts, and he will once again by joined by Adam Clanton and Adam Wexler. Adrian Chavarria remains as the team’s Spanish radio voice."
