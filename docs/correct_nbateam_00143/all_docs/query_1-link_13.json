        "text": "It’s 11 a.m. on Memorial Day, and 36-year-old Gerald Green is hunched over in a gym, completely drenched in sweat. He’s speaking to an incoming freshman seeking advice from the NBA veteran who’s seen just about everything in his 15-year career. A few feet away, his longtime trainer Kenny Ellis is coordinating the day’s workout.\n\nGreen is ramping up his conditioning as he prepares for his next adventure, the Big3. Because of how the Big3 is played — a bit of a faster-paced setting — he wants to get used to playing faster. Eight-minute quarters, four quarters a game with a running clock. Eight seconds to cross half court, 10 seconds left after that.\n\nIt’s all about adapting, and Green has been able to do that for more than a decade in the NBA, including stints with the Rockets in 2008 and from 2017-20. In October, he announced his retirement and joined the Rockets as a player development coach. In January, however, he came out of retirement and signed with the Rio Grande Valley Vipers of the G League, helping the Vipers win the G League title.\n\nGreen sat down with The Athletic for a wide-ranging interview covering his decision to retire and come out of retirement, his time in Houston in a new role and the glory days, why he went to the G League, his love for the young Rockets and more.\n\n(Some parts have been edited for clarity and brevity.)\n\nIf I recall correctly, last summer was a hard time for you. Coming off an injury, trying to get back to the NBA, contemplating retirement … how was that mentally?\n\nMan, it was tough. Last summer, I was constantly in the gym with Kenny, like, every day. I felt like I took my workouts to a whole nother level as far as something that I hadn’t really done in my career. When I went to Brooklyn for minicamp and I didn’t get invited to training camp, mentally, that kind of messed with me. I felt like, damn, I’m not really good enough. But I knew in my head that I know I can play this game. I’ve been around this game for 15, 16 years. Mentally, I felt if I couldn’t get into training camp, it’s over for me.\n\nSo I went to the Rockets. The Fertittas and Rafael Stone gave me an opportunity of a lifetime to be a player development coach. I’m so grateful for that opportunity. That’s something that I definitely want to do after basketball if I’m still able to have that opportunity. But just being around the game, being around the players, I knew I had so much game in me. Retiring at the time was probably not the best decision for me, mentally. Me having that meeting with Stone and Fertitta, they both supported me. Last summer was an interesting summer. I learned a lot.\n\nHaving served only as a player your entire life, what was the mindset of being back with the Rockets, the team you love, albeit in a different role than you’re accustomed to?\n\nIt was great. I loved it, bro. It was dope, man. Being a Rockets coach? Like, come on. Can’t get no better than that. I was so excited about that situation. That’s why I retired; I was like, ‘Oh, this is perfect.’ Another dream came true, life after basketball. I couldn’t have been in a better situation. I’m coming in just full of joy because it was so exciting to be around those guys. Even if I wasn’t playing, it was just exciting to be around them, to teach the young guys and have an impact.\n\nIt’s just when they asked me to start playing pickup with the young guys, the engine started up and I couldn’t get it to cut off. There were times when I’m thinking about coaching, I’m over here thinking about what I would do if I was in the game, and I knew that was when something was wrong. I gotta get back into the game.\n\nThat must have been tough for you, still able to compete with those guys on the floor and getting that itch back.\n\nPlaying with those guys and being able to compete. And then those guys telling me, too, like damn G, you really should be in the league. That really helped me out. Even some people in the staff said I really should be playing and shouldn’t be out here coaching. I needed to pursue my dream because, like, this is something that doesn’t come off. I want to be able to set an example for all the guys out there who think their career is over, but dig in the bag a little more now you revamp it. I want to be the poster child of how you should be a pro, how you should approach the game, how you should take the game seriously. I’ve been through it all: (straight) out of high school, overseas, out the league, in the league, sign a 10-day off the couch. I’ve done it all.\n\nSo why did you choose the Rio Grande Vipers out of all G League franchises?\n\nFirst of all, it was affiliated with the Rockets. I knew Mahmoud (Abdelfattah) as a coach, he’s a really good coach, one of the best G League coaches there is — he should be a head coach in this league one day. So, it was a no-brainer. Obviously, I knew Usman (Garuba). He would go down there, Josh Christopher would go down there, (Daishen) Nix was down there, Trevelin Queen was down there. Those were my guys who I would work out for player development. It made sense just to go hoop with these guys. I know them already. They know me, I know their game, I know this system. Instead of me trying to go somewhere else and try to fit in with the players that I might not know, try to understand the system that I might not be familiar with, let me just stick with something that I am familiar with, stick with players that I already know. And then, we ended up winning the ring out of it.\n\nComing in, what kind of role did you expect to have with them?\n\nInitially coming in, I felt like my role was exactly what it was — to come in, be a leader, lead by example. I knew that I was gonna play. You’re not gonna come out of retirement and not play. That was the whole reason — I need to get this fuel out of me. I knew that I was going to be a guy who was going to sometimes have to take sacrifices, not play sometimes, but that’s the role of being an NBA veteran. Especially when you’re an OG in this game, you do things like that. I’ve had my time and I’ve had my opportunities to better myself and better my family and achieve my dreams. Some of these guys in the G League might not ever get a chance to go where I’m at.\n\nSo, I’m not going to sit here — if they have an opportunity or if they’re playing good — and not cheer for them. Really ride on what coach is saying, because Mahmoud knows exactly what he’s doing, and just try to teach the young guys, give them game that I didn’t get. When I was younger, I didn’t really have a lot of veterans teaching me how to know how to be a better pro, how to stick in his league. They were teaching me other things that I don’t want to talk about. I wanted to just give the game back to the guys, and it worked out perfectly.\n\nWhat was the feeling like winning the whole thing? Does a G League title feel different than anything else you’ve accomplished in your career?\n\nHell yeah. I loved it, bro. Having my kids, getting married, getting drafted and winning the championship, by far, are the four fantastic moments in my life. And I don’t care if it is the G League. That was a very tough task that we had to do. I felt like I just won the NBA Finals, I’m not gonna lie. I’m still on that high right now. Because you’re a champion, they can never take that away. It’s not a lot of guys who come back out of retirement, go to any league and win a championship. So, I pat myself on the back for being and staying ready. Man, it was one of the best things in the world, for sure.\n\nWhat do you miss most about the James Harden/Chris Paul days in Houston? It seemed like that was a pretty tight-knit group you guys had?\n\nMan, I miss those days, bro. I feel like we didn’t really give it a chance like that, you know? I know a lot of circumstances, a lot of guys being free agents and guys gotta do what they gotta do to take care of their families. But I really wish we could have run that group back. CP pulling his hamstring (in 2018) haunts me to this day. I know if he doesn’t do that, not only do we beat Golden State, we win the NBA Finals that year. No disrespect to that Cleveland team that year, I just think that we were the better team. When CP got hurt, naturally, he was our floor general. He’s the one who helped us get better shots that we weren’t getting at times. James Harden was such an offensive juggernaut that at times, he would get us the ball in the right places. But sometimes, it wouldn’t be the right place — for certain people. Somebody like myself, you can throw the ball anywhere and I’m gonna shoot it because of who I am. But you have other guys on the team who need the ball in a certain spot. CP was better at finding those guys when they were in that certain spot than James was, so we missed CP for that aspect. But again, we still should’ve won. I just feel like if we had CP, it would have been a no-brainer.\n\nI know the losing part stings, but just for you guys as a whole during that time, it looked fun during those years.\n\nMan, that was crazy. We were so close. I mean, we’re all still tight to this day. Me, TA (Trevor Ariza), Ryan Anderson, Nenê, Tarik Black, P.J. Tucker. The list goes on, I know I’m missing some people. We were tight. We always talk about those times. Everybody in that organization knew that that’s the closest the team has gotten in a long time. We had the highest efficiency in NBA history. I don’t think that will ever be broken. That was a good time. It was a good time.\n\nYou’ve spent quite a bit of time around these young Rockets. What are your thoughts on guys like Jalen Green, Kevin Porter Jr. and the group?\n\nWe got next. They got next. Like, I love that team. They got a long time to grow; they got a lot to grow. Jalen is a stud. Scoot (Porter) is a stud. Al P (Alperen Şengün), I can’t stop loving him. They got great guys, but then you got Josh Christopher who’s a workhorse. We had to lock the gym for him not to get in the gym; that’s how much he wanted to work. You still have Eric Gordon, who’s obviously at the back end of his career but can always compete. Like, I really think that team can be a really good team in the future. They got the No. 3 pick this year. They’re still getting great picks. The sky’s the future for the Rockets.\n\n(Top photo: Mary Kate Ridgway / NBAE via Getty Images)"
