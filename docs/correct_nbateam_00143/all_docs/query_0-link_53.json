Picked straight out of Gulf Shores Academy in Houston, Texas, where he was a McDonald’s All-American and averaged 33 points and 12 rebounds, Green made an immediate impact on the Celtics as a rookie and had a big year in 2007, scoring 10.4 points a game. Since being traded to the Mavericks and seeing time with the Nets and Pacers he’s become a solid contributor for the Phoenix Suns, averaging nearly 15 points a game the last two seasons and 10 points over the course of his eight-year career.\n\nDuring his time in the league he’s made a huge splash at the NBA Slam Dunk Contest, showcasing big-time dunks with style and flare that captured him the 2007 Slam Dunk trophy and also allowing him to become a three-time competitor. In 2014 Green was named the NBA Most Improved Player.\n\nBook Gerald Green for your Next Event"
