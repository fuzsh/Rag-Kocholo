EastEnders actor Steve McFadden's married ex-lover arrested after 'row' outside his home

The married GP who had EastEnders star Steve McFadden’s child has been arrested after a row outside the actor’s home.

Dr Rachel Sidwell, 42, allegedly damaged a moped parked on the driveway at the actor’s £750,000 Highgate home, and pounded on the front door as she yelled abuse.

Soap star Steve, 50, who plays hardman Phil Mitchell on the show, was said to be out at the time of the incident last Thursday but his son Matt, 23, dialled 999.

Police dashed to McFadden’s home but there was no one left at the scene.

They later interviewed him when he returned to his house after being called by his son.

The star had three-month-old Amelie Tinkerbell via caesarean section with the married mother after meeting her on the school run.

Police contacted Dr Sidwell, who is now back living with husband Dr James Green after they were reunited, and asked her to attend Hornsey police station last Friday morning.

She was arrested on suspicion of criminal damage to the moped and bailed to return on a date in November.

A Met Police spokesman said: 'We can confirm police were called to a disturbance at Highgate at 9pm on Thursday 1st October.

'A woman in her early 40s was arrested on suspicion of criminal damage after attending a North London police station by appointment the following day. Inquiries continue.'

Dr Sidwell had moved into the actor’s home after leaving her surgeon husband but split with the Albert Square star three weeks ago after claiming 'he can’t be trusted'.

The pair had previously posed up for pictures in a magazine after she gave birth to their daughter.

McFadden – who has a son with childhood sweetheart Sue Marshall and two other daughters with ex-girlfriend Angela Bostock - said: 'This is a very exciting time for me.'
