The ex-partner of EastEnders actor Steve McFadden has announced that she is heartbroken following their break-up.

Yesterday, it was revealed that McFadden (Phil Mitchell) had been dumped by Dr Rachel Sidwell, the mother of his 2-month-old daughter Amelie Tinkerbell.

Sidwell has now reportedly told The Sun that she feels McFadden "can't be trusted".

She continued: "I'm in pieces. I'm too upset to talk about it."

Expecting to receive news from reporters, Sidwell then added: "What's he done now? Whatever it is, it won't surprise me."

Sidwell is said to have reunited with her surgeon husband James Green in the aftermath of the split.
