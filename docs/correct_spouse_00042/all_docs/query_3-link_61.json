        "text": "Virgin Radio\n\n6 Jul 2022, 16:05\n\nSPOILER ALERT: Avert your eyes if you don't want to read about any potential upcoming 'doof doofs'. Could we be witnessing a much-anticipated return of Ross Kemp aka the infamous Grant Mitchell to Albert Square?\n\nSofa detectives have gone into overdrive after watching Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean) try and get in contact with her ex-husband to tell him about Philâ€™s (Steve McFadden) impending doom after fellow inmate Craig Erskine (Connor Mills) threatened to kill him.\n\nBackup prisoner ally Ravi Gulati (Aaron Thiara) was due to help him against Connor, but was transferred to solitary so is out of action for the 6pm literal deadline.\n\nAlthough DI Keeble (Alison Newman) offered to get Phil out of jail in exchange for underground information, Phil has refused to play the card and be a 'grass', much to Sharon's dismay.\n\nAfter confessing her undying love for Phil and being dragged off by prison guards, Sharon was seen calling her ex spouse to tell him the devastating predicament. But Grant didn't pick up.\n\nSo what will happen to Phil and has Sharon given away a vital clue to Grant's ever-anticipated comeback?\n\nThe last time he was back was for mum (Barbara Windsor) Peggy's death in 2016 and later that year when he briefly joined forces with Phil.\n\nGrant is currently living in Portugal with his daughter, Courtney. Let's hope and pray for Phil - and his brother's return to E20."
