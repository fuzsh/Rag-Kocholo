        "text": "George Knight will continue to try and prove himself to his suspicious neighbours next week in EastEnders as he desperately fights to keep the true identity of his ex-wife secret.\n\nLinda Carter (Kellie Bright) refuses to accept George (Colin Salmon) has nothing to hide and enlists Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) to find out more about ex-wife Rose's disappearance.\n\nPhil eventually agrees, wanting to make sure he can trust the man he's about to go into business with and persuades Callum Highway ( Tony Clay ) to search the police database to ease Linda's concerns.\n\nCallum's search of George proves he has a relatively clean record but alarmingly he's unable to search the database for Rose as all access is denied.\n\nWhen Linda hears this she decides her concerns have been proved right while Phil invites George to the Boxing Den to ask him directly about Rose.\n\nThe former champion boxer insists he isn't hiding anything and Linda's vendetta has to stop.\n\nLater in the week, Phil is stalling to sign with George and asks his lawyer Richie to dig up dirt on Rose.\n\nWhen George arrives at The Vic believing he's set to sign the contracts for his new business deal, Phil accuses him of not being straight with him.\n\nMeanwhile, EastEnders actor Colin has revealed George is increasingly losing his patience with Linda and Phil thinking the worse of him.\n\nSpeaking out on Phil confronting him, the actor said: \"George is affronted and angry. It's about respect, and George finds it disrespectful, and that makes him cross. He's like, 'Hang on a minute, you don't know the story, so you've jumped to the wrong conclusion.'\n\n\"But again, George does understand how Phil got to that conclusion, and Linda isn't helping. George has been living under a cloud. Some people think he killed Rose, so it's been nine years of mystery and heartache on top of suspicion and misunderstanding. It's hard if you are a member of a family and your spouse has gone missing, everyone thinks they know what's going on.\"\n\nEastEnders airs on BBC One from Monday to Thursday at 7.30pm.\n\nGot any theories or thoughts on the storyline?
