        "text": "EastEnders' Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) is a man who knows how to bag most of Walford's leading ladies and fall in love with them. The love rat has not only been married five times but he has also been engaged more times than we've had hot dinners, not to mention his one night stands (yes Denise Fox, we're looking at you).\n\nThe local hard nut also shares four children - Ben, Louise, Raymond and Albie - with four different women as he is well and truly keeping the Mitchell name alive for generations to come. Phil is also the grandad to Lexi Pearce.\n\nIt's been 30 years since Phil first said \"I do\" in a shambolic wedding to his first wife Nadia. But can you recall all of Phil's wives? We've broken down Phil's marriage timeline so we can reminisce about all of his big days.\n\nREAD MORE: Help Cindy choose her man - are you George Knight or Ian Beale?\n\n1. Nadia Borovac\n\nRomanian refugee Nadia Borovac (Anna Barkan) became Phil’s first wife in July 1993 and their marriage was very much one of convenience as she married him so she could stay in England.\n\nOf course, Phil and Nadia's wedded bliss didn't last long as the gangster thought that he’d done a good deed for a nice girl he met in a bar and that was that. But she returned to Walford when he was in a happy relationship with Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth) and got him to make their marriage look more realistic for the Home Office so moved in with him.\n\nWhen she pursued Phil and eventually bedded him later that year, she was run out of Walford by Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp) who threatened her. When Phil wanted to marry Kathy months later, he had to track Nadia down who blackmailed him for £1,000, which he paid. She’s not been seen on-screen since.\n\n2. Kathy Beale\n\nTwo years after his mockery wedding to Nadia, Phil was once again exchanging vows in 1995 - this time with Kathy Beale. The iconic couple went on to have their son Ben Mitchell (currently played by Max Bowden) in March 1996.\n\nHowever, when Phil had an affair with Lorna Cartwright their marriage was left in tatters and he turned to alcohol. Kathy decided to move to South Africa with her new husband Gavin Sullivan (Paul Nicholas) in 2000.\n\nDespite parting on bad terms, Phil and Kathy remained friendly enough for Phil to help Kathy out when she was faking her own death. Kathy returned to Walford in 2015, with the former lovers still being good friends to this day.\n\n3. Kate Morton\n\nPhil married Kate in 2003 after initially meeting in hospital when Jamie Mitchell (Jack Ryder) was dying after his road accident. The bride-to-be first introduced herself as Kate Tyler but it would later transpire that her real name was actually Kate Morton, played by Jill Halfpenny.\n\nBelieving Kate to be a nail technician, it was later revealed she was in fact an undercover policewoman tasked by DI Marsden to take the Mitchells down and frame Phil. But when Kate genuinely fell for Phil, she had to quit her job.\n\nPhil ended up proposing to Kate and the pair married but when his ex Lisa Fowler (Lucy Benjamin) turned up on their wedding day wanting her daughter Louise back, to cut a long story short, Phil ended up in prison framed with assault. Kate ended their marriage and moved to Brighton in 2005.\n\n4. Sharon Watts\n\nAh, Phil and Sharon - a leading couple destined to be together (or not). Sharon is arguably Phil’s one true love as their on/off relationship has lasted decades. They’ve been jumping into each other’s beds since Sharon slept with him behind his brother and her then-husband Grant’s back.\n\nThey finally tied the knot in September 2014. But they didn't stand the test of time as Sharon had an affair with Keanu Taylor (Danny Walters) which led to the demise of their marriage. Phil was left heartbroken after discovering his pregnant wife Sharon was carrying Keanu's baby.\n\nPhil and Sharon's divorce was confirmed in 2020 - but in a twist of fate young Albie Watts was revealed to be Phil's son after all on Christmas Day 2023 only hours before Keanu was murdered. Will Sharon and Phil ever get back together...again?\n\n5. Kat Slater\n\nAfter the heartache of Sharon's betrayal anyone would think Phil was put off of marriage for life - but he walked up the aisle again in 2023 and this time Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) was his bride.\n\nIn September 2023 unlikely lovers Phil and Kat sealed their love with a wedding. But shortly before their big day, Phil had a fling with Emma Harding (Patsy Kensit) after a jealous rage thinking Kat was still in love with her ex-husband Alfie Moon (Shane Richie).\n\nPhil managed to marry Kat with his cheating remaining a secret - until his sister Sam Mitchell (Kim Medcalf) told everyone in The Queen Vic in January 2024. This marked the end of Kat and Phil's marriage and the gangster is now single."
