        "text": "English actor (b. 1959)\n\nSteve Robert McFadden (né Reid; born 20 March 1959) is an English actor whose career has spanned three decades. He rose to prominence for his role as Phil Mitchell in the BBC One soap opera EastEnders, which he has played since 1990. Regarded as one of the show's most popular characters, he has received numerous accolades including the British Soap Award for Outstanding Achievement. McFadden was also the presenter of the game show Britain's Hardest (2004).\n\nEarly life[edit]\n\nMcFadden was born in Maida Vale, London, on 20 March 1959.[2] He left school in 1975, and had short stints in jobs including labouring, carrot picking, plumbing and working at a builder's merchant.[3] After attending university, McFadden decided that he wanted to become an actor, and was accepted into the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in 1984, graduating in 1987.[3]\n\nCareer[edit]\n\nIn 1988, McFadden had an uncredited brief appearance in the film Buster as a gang member. He played a small role in the 1989 BBC television film The Firm, and this was followed by appearances in the television series The Bill, Minder and Bergerac.\n\nMcFadden then began portraying the role of Phil Mitchell in the BBC soap opera EastEnders. He joined EastEnders at the beginning of 1990, at the same time as Ross Kemp, who played Phil's younger brother Grant Mitchell. During that time, his character was involved in numerous iconic storylines, such as Sharongate (in which it was revealed that he had an affair with his brother's wife Sharon) in 1994, and the Who Shot Phil? storyline in March 2001, when his character was shot and wounded by a mystery attacker.\n\nMcFadden then made an appearance in the film Kevin & Perry Go Large (2000),[4] and starred in an episode of the BBC anthology series Murder in Mind in 2001. He left EastEnders in late 2003 for a one-year break to concentrate on pantomimes. His character was written out of the series after being framed for an armed robbery by Den Watts (played by Leslie Grantham), and going on the run after breaking out of prison.\n\nDuring his break from EastEnders, he presented the reality television series Britain's Hardest, which was an underground competition broadcast on Sky One. He returned to EastEnders for two episodes in April 2005. In the story, Phil returned to Walford in need of financial help, only to be arrested and returned to prison. In October 2005, he returned on a permanent basis, after his character was cleared of armed robbery. In 2007, he appeared in the film Provoked. He has also appeared as Captain Hook in a pantomime production of Peter Pan from 2010 to 2011 at The Swan.\n\nPersonal life[edit]\n\nMcFadden has five children. His son Matt McFadden's mother is Sue Marshall, and Angela Bostock is the mother of his daughters Teona and Mollie Jane. Rachel Sidwell gave birth to his daughter Amelie Tinkerbell on 29 June 2009.[5][6] At the time, she was his partner, but the couple split two months later.[7] A fifth child, a daughter named Frankie, was born to his girlfriend Karen Cairns in June 2016.[8]\n\nIn 1996, McFadden was banned from driving for 18 months and fined £1000 plus £350 in costs after pleading guilty to drink-driving after attending a party at a London nightclub.[9]\n\nMcFadden is a sailor, and took part in the Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant in his motorboat, Barbara.[10][11] In 2014, he sued the Metropolitan Police and News of the World after a police officer sold details about him to the newspaper. He sued News of the World after one of their journalists admitted trying to intercept his voicemail messages in the News International phone hacking scandal. McFadden stated \"I am particularly concerned that a police officer sold my privacy to a tabloid newspaper for profit. I consider the payment of damages and public apology will go some way to ensuring respect for my and others' privacy in future. I am glad to have been vindicated and to be able to put this matter behind me\".[12]\n\nCold War Steve[edit]\n\nMcFadden, in his role as Phil Mitchell, is a recurrent character in the satirical collages by Cold War Steve, the Twitter handle of artist Christopher Spencer. Spencer's Twitter feed was originally called McFadden's Cold War and then later renamed as Cold War Steve. McFadden has appeared in over a hundred of the artworks.[13]\n\nFilmography[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1988 Buster Gang Member (uncredited) Film 1989 Minder Mickey Episode: \"It's a Sorry Lorry Morrie\" 1989 Screen Two Billy Episode: \"The Firm\" 1989 The Bill Gun Dealer 2 Episode: \"Bad Company\" 1989 Saracen Nash Episode: \"Crossfire\" 1990 Bergerac Jones Episode: \"Roots of Evil\" 1990–2003, 2005–present EastEnders Phil Mitchell Series regular 1993 Dimensions in Time Phil Mitchell Children in Need charity crossover between Doctor Who and EastEnders 1998 EastEnders: The Mitchells - Naked Truths Phil Mitchell Spin-off video 2000 Kevin & Perry Go Large Bouncer 2 Film 2001 Murder in Mind Joe Waterman Episode: \"Flame\" 2003 Comic Relief 2003: The Big Hair Do Phil Mitchell Television film 2006 Provoked DS Ron Meyers Film 2010 EastEnders: Last Tango in Walford Phil Mitchell Spin-off video\n\nAwards and nominations[edit]\n\nYear Award Category Result 2001 National Television Awards Most Popular Actor Nominated British Soap Awards Villain of the Year Won Inside Soap Awards Best Actor Nominated Best Bad Boy Nominated Most Dramatic Storyline (Who Shot Phil?)
