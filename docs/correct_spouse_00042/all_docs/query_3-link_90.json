        "text": "Q. I really like Gates McFadden, Dr. Beverly Crusher, on \"Star Trek: The Next Generation.\" Tell me about her and her address. - B.B., Stanton, Mich.\n\nA. McFadden, 29, an actress, dancer and mime, grew up in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, studied at the University of Pittsburgh and Brandeis University and taught at Brandeis. She was in the movie \"The Muppets Take Manhattan\" but worked mostly in the theater until \"Star Trek.\" She has a young son. Write: Paramount TV, 5555 Melrose Ave., Los Angeles, Calif. 90038-3197.Q. My daughter and I are having a dispute: Is Debbie Boone a daughter or daughter-in-law of Pat and Shirley Boone or is she the daughter of Rosemary Clooney and Jose Ferrer? - P.R., Boise, Idaho.\n\nA. Debbie Boone, 36, is the third of the four daughters of Pat and Shirley Boone. She is married to Gabriel Ferrer, 36, second son and third of the five children of Rosemary Clooney and the late Jose Ferrer.\n\nQ. In 1936, when I was 8, I saw the original \"Last of the Mohicans\" with James Stewart. I've always wanted to see it again but to my knowledge it has never been on TV or tape. - J.M., Philadelphia.\n\nA. It was Randolph Scott in the 1936 \"Mohicans.\" Both it and a 1977 TV version with Steve Forrest as Hawkeye are available on tape.\n\nQ. How about supplying some information on Jennifer Jason Leigh. - C.P., Wichita Falls, Texas.\n\nA. Leigh, 30, is the daughter of the late actor Vic Morrow and writer Barbara Turner. Her real name is Jennifer Leigh Morrow. She borrowed Jason from family friend Jason Robards and dropped the Morrow to have her own identity. Her parents divorced when she was 2. Morrow died in a grisly accident while filming a movie in 1982. Leigh dropped out of high school, started acting at 14, and made her first big impressions in 1981's TV movie \"The Best Little Girl in the World\" and the 1982 feature \"Fast Times at Ridgemont High.\"\n\nQ. I'm from the first generation of \"Sesame Street\" viewers and now my daughter is enjoying it. I've always wondered where it's produced, if one can visit and where to write Carroll Spinney, who has been Big Bird since I was a girl. Also, at what point did others finally believe Big Bird that Snuffy was not imaginary? - M.T., Telford, Pa.\n\nA. The Children's Television Workshop produces \"Sesame Street' in New York but the sets are off-limits to audiences. (For one thing, some of the magic would be lost.) Spinney has been Big Bird and the voice of Oscar since the beginning, Nov. 10, 1969. Write him: Children's Television Workshop, One Lincoln Plaza, New York, NY 10023. Snuffleupagus, a k a Snuffy, has been real to \"Sesame\" adults since 1984.\n\nQ. About five years ago, PBS presented Truman Capote's Christmas story based on his childhood memories of fun with a spinster cousin (played by Geraldine Page). What's the show's title? Is it on video? - Mrs. L.E.K., Irvine, Calif.\n\nA. \"A Christmas Memory\" and another holiday hourlong special based on a Capote short story, \"A Thanksgiving Visitor,\" were first seen in 1967 in ABC's drama anthology \"Stage 67.\" Both are available for TV reruns but aren't on video.\n\nQ. I am a fan of Michael Richards, who plays Kramer on \"Seinfeld.\" I remember watching him on \"Fridays.\" Tell me when it was on the air, what network and where I can get the videos or if it's in syndication. - C.D., Atlanta, Ga.\n\nA. \"Fridays\" was on and off ABC late night several times, 1980-82. It was a blatant \"Saturday Night Live\" rip-off and so offensive several stations refused to carry it. Thirteen shows are available in syndication but the comedy is dated and it's rarely seen. No videos are available.\n\nQ. Please tell me about Lane Davies of the Fox series \"Whoops.\" Where is he from? How old is he? Has he done any films or other television series? - E.L., Glendale, Ariz.\n\nA. Davies is 42, a native of Dalton, Ga. Last season, he was seen on ABC's short-lived \"Good & Evil\" and he's done several features and TV movies. But he's best known for his soap opera roles: Dr. Evan Wyland in \"Days of Our Lives\" and five years as Mason Capwell on \"Santa Barbara.\"\n\nQ. I'm so fed up with sitcoms I could scream. They finally had a show I liked but now it's off the air. Will \"Physical Evidence\" return? I'm a Lee Horsley fan. - Mrs. A.S., Dearborn Heights, Mich.\n\nA. It's \"Bodies of Evidence\" and the show is in production for a midseason return.\n\nQ. Did Lesley Ann Warren ever appear on \"Mission: Impossible\"? When? - J.W.B., Philadelphia.\n\nA. Warren was the second woman on the IMF force, 1970-71. She replaced Barbara Bain, seen 1966-69. Later IMF members: Lynda Day George, 1971-73; Barbara Anderson, 1972-73.\n\nQ. Is the Lynda Day whose name appears in the credits of \"Married . . . With Children\" as producer or director the same Lynda Day who was married to Christopher George and starred in \"Mission: Impossible\"? - J.K., Philadelphia.\n\nA. It is. She is a busy and respected TV director.\n\nQ. How old is Don Adams, Maxwell Smart of \"Get Smart\"? - B.P., Virginia Beach, Va.\n\nA. Adams is 66. He was a mere 39 to 44 when he was bumbling Max Smart, 1965-70.\n\nQ. I'd like to know where to write to Patti LaBelle. I love her new show. - C.W.W., Detroit.\n\nA. \"Out All Night,\" LaBelle's series, has been having problems but NBC hoped to give it a boost with a move to Thursdays. Write: NBC-TV, 3000 W. Alameda Ave., Burbank, Calif. 91523.\n\nQ. Which actress on \"Sisters\" is Naomi Judd's daughter? - H.E.M., Bloonsland, Ind.\n\nA. Ashley Judd, 24, is Naomi's youngest. She plays Reid, the daughter of Alex (Swoosie Kurtz) on \"Sisters.\" She's a 1990 graduate of the University of Kentucky. She studied acting in Pasadena, Calif., then landed her first role, a bit in the 1992 movie \"Kuffs,\" and had a recurring role as Ensign Mussler in \"Star Trek: The Next Generation.\"\n\nQ. At her age, didn't Katharine Hepburn wish she'd never made that recent television movie?\n\nA. Let's just say that Kate was so worried about her performance that she broke her longstanding policy of not viewing her own films. \"I think it's because this is her last movie,\" said longtime Hepburn friend James Prideaux, who wrote the recent CBS film \"The Man Upstairs.\" In fact, she had to be talked into making the film. \"After all, she's 85 years old, has a bad foot, a bogus hip, a shoulder out - she's in pain all the time,\" he said. Yet, Hepburn's determination won, he said. \"For instance, we all wondered whether she could do a scene in which she was supposed to run up stairs. When we shot it, she took the stairs two at a time.\"\n\nQ. Is John Travolta effectively retired from movie-making?\n\nA. Actually, Travolta will come out of hibernation early next year to shoot \"Look Who's Talking 3.\" He made so much money from \"Look Who's Talking\" and its follow-up that \"he doesn't have to ever work again,\" his manager said. That's fortunate, because Travolta hasn't had much other success on the big screen lately.\n\nQ. Has the late Cary Grant's only daughter become estranged from her mother, Dyan Cannon, because of the nasty way her famous parents split up?\n\nA. Grant's only daughter, Jennifer, a 25-year-old graduate student at Stanford University, is very close to her mother. Grant was more than 30 years older than Cannon when they married in 1965. The relationship ended with bitter charges of physical and emotional abuse. Cannon, 54, recently divorced her second husband and has been busy with a number of film projects. She and her daughter are said to be each other's biggest fans.\n\nQ. Does heartthrob superstar Michael Bolton have any kids?\n\nA. The 39-year-old blue-eyed soul singer has three teenage daughters. He and his wife, Maureen McGuire, a onetime exercise teacher, ended their 15-year marriage in January 1991. He has full custody of the children and lives with them in Westport, Conn. His studio is next to his posh home. \"I can go up the stairs, walk across the lawn to my house and have dinner with my kids,\" Bolton (once Michael Bolotin) says proudly. \"People who don't have careers that take them away wouldn't understand this, but for someone in my position, dinner with your kids is a new concept.\" The woman he seems to have dinner with most often these days is actress Nicolette Sheridan, now estranged from her spouse, Harry Hamlin.\n\nQ. Is Don Hastings, of \"As the World Turns,\" the same Don Hastings who was on \"Capt. Video\" in the 1950s? If so, what's his address? - G.N., Northridge, Calif.\n\nA. It was Hastings who was the Video Ranger on \"Capt. Video,\" 1949-55. He was 15 and he was TV's first teen idol. When the series ended, he did a few TV shows before he landed his first soap opera role as Jack Lane in \"The Edge of Night\" when it debuted in 1956. He left in 1960 to join \"As The World Turns\" as Bob Hughes and he's been there ever since. Write: CBS-TV, 51 W. 52nd St., New York, N.Y. 10019.\n\nQ. Many of us who watch \"All My Children\" wonder what happened to Natalie and why she left the show. A lot of us have stopped watching since she was replaced. - Y.H., Brandenton, Fla.\n\nA. Kate Collins, who played Natalie, quit or was fired - take your choice, both stories have been put forward. Melody Anderson, who replaced Collins, was a regular on \"St. Elsewhere\" and \"Jake and the Fat Man.\"\n\nQ. Seeing \"Innocent Blood\" with Robert Loggia set me to reminiscing. At least 35 years ago, I enjoyed watching a talented young actor named Robert Loggia in a Disney miniseries, \"The Nine Lives of Elfago Baca.\" He did \"T.H.E. Cat\" and then disappeared for 25 years until resurfacing in \"Mancuso, FBI.\" What did he do in that lost quarter century? - R.R., Van Nuys, Calif.\n\nA. Loggia did \"Baca\" in 1958 and \"T.H.E. Cat,\" 1966-67. In 1969, he did drop out, but only for four years to \"look for answers to a lot of questions,\" he says. He came back with a guest shot on \"Mannix\" and after that, by his count, did over 50 TV guest roles, plus directed some TV dramas. In 1982, he played Richard Gere's father in \"An Officer and a Gentleman\" and was launched on a feature career that has included a 1986 Oscar nomination for \"Jagged Edge.\" He had a 1990 Emmy nomination for \"Mancuso, FBI.\" In 1991, he starred in a Norman Lear TV flop, \"Sunday Dinner.\"\n\n- Send your questions to Celebrity Questions, Detroit Free Press, 321 W.
