Heal the weakness of your people and save us from lasting death that we may praise and glorify you for ever.\n\nAnt. Bless the Lord, all you his works!\n\nSacred Silence (indicated by a bell) – a moment to reflect and receive in our hearts the full resonance of the voice of the Holy Spirit and to unite our personal prayer more closely with the word of God and public voice of the Church.\n\nLord, make me understand the way of your precepts.\n\n— And I will marvel at your wisdom.\n\nREADINGS\n\nFirst reading\n\nFrom the second letter of the apostle Paul to the Corinthians\n\n3:7–4:4\n\nThe glory of the ministry of the new covenant\n\nIf the ministry of death, carved in writing on stone, was inaugurated with such glory that the Israelites could not look on Moses’ face because of the glory that shone on it (even though it was a fading glory), O how much greater will be the glory of the ministry of the Spirit? If the ministry of the covenant that condemned had glory, greater by far is the glory of the ministry that justifies. Indeed, when you compare that limited glory with this surpassing glory, the former should be declared no glory at all. If what was destined to pass away was given in glory, greater by far is the glory that endures.\n\nOur hope being such, we act with full confidence. We are not like Moses, who used to hide his face with a veil so that the Israelites could not see the final fading of that glory. Their minds, of course, were dulled. To this very day, when the old covenant is read the veil remains unlifted; it is only in Christ that it is taken away. Even now, when Moses is read a veil covers their understanding. “But whenever he turns to the Lord, the veil will be removed.” The Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. All of us, gazing on the Lord’s glory with unveiled faces, are being transformed from glory to glory into his very image by the Lord who is the Spirit.\n\nBecause we possess this ministry through God’s mercy, we do not give in to discouragement. Rather, we repudiate shameful, underhanded practices. We do not resort to trickery or falsify the word of God. We proclaim the truth openly and commend ourselves to every man’s conscience before God. If our gospel can be called “veiled” in any sense, it is such only for those who are headed toward destruction. Their unbelieving minds have been blinded by the god of the present age so that they do not see the splendor of the gospel showing forth the glory of Christ, the image of God.\n\nRESPONSORY 2 Corinthians 3:18; Philippians 3:3\n\nWith our faces unveiled,\n\n— all of us, reflecting as in a mirror the glory of God, are being transformed from splendor to splendor.\n\nWe worship in the Spirit of God and we glory in Christ Jesus.\n\n— All of us, reflecting as in a mirror the glory of God, are being transformed from splendor to splendor.\n\nSecond reading\n\nFrom the Imitation of Christ\n\nThe kingdom of God is the peace and joy of the Spirit\n\nTurn to the Lord with your whole heart and leave behind this wretched world. Then your soul shall find rest. For the kingdom of God is the peace and joy of the Holy Spirit. If you prepare within your heart a fitting dwelling place, Christ will come to you and console you.\n\nHis glory and beauty are within you, and he delights in dwelling there. The Lord frequently visits the heart of man. There he shares with man pleasant conversations, welcome consolation, abundant peace and a wonderful intimacy.\n\nSo come, faithful soul. Prepare your heart for your spouse to dwell within you. For he says: If anyone loves me, he will keep my word and we shall come to him and make our dwelling within him.\n\nMake room for Christ. When you possess Christ you are a rich man, for he is sufficient for you. He himself, shall provide for you and faithfully administer all your cares. You will not have to place your hope in men. Put all your trust in God; let him be both your fear and your love. He will respond on your behalf and will do whatever is in your best interest.\n\nYou have here no lasting city. For wherever you find yourself, you will always be a pilgrim from another city. Until you are united intimately with Christ, you will never find your true rest.\n\nLet your thoughts be with the Most High and direct your prayers continually to Christ. If you do not know how to contemplate the glory of heaven, take comfort in the passion of Christ, and dwell willingly in his sacred wounds. Endure with Christ, suffer for him, if you wish to reign with him.\n\nOnce you have entered completely into the depths of Jesus, and have a taste of his powerful love, then you will not care about your own convenience or inconvenience. Rather you will rejoice all the more in insults and injuries, for the love of Jesus makes a man scorn his own needs.\n\nRESPONSORY Psalm 71:1-2, 5\n\nIn you, Lord, is our hope; and we shall never hope in vain.\n\n— In your justice, rescue me and deliver me.\n\nYou, O Lord, are my hope; from my youth I have trusted in you.\n\n— In your justice, rescue me and deliver me.\n\nCONCLUDING PRAYER\n\nShow favor, O Lord,\n\nto your servants\n\nand mercifully increase the gifts of your grace,\n\nthat, made fervent in hope, faith and charity,\n\nthey may be ever watchful in keeping your commands.\n\nThrough our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\n\nwho lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\n\nGod, for ever and ever.\n\n— Amen.\n\nACCLAMATION (at least in the communal celebration)"
