        "text": "KAT Slater's marriage to Phil Mitchell could be hanging by a thread in upcoming scenes of the long-running soap.\n\nThe EastEnders legend played by Jessie Wallace decides to stand by her former husband Alfie Moon in the midst of his cancer ordeal.\n\nFan favourite Alfie Moon (played by Shane Richie) was diagnosed with prostate cancer in earlier scenes of the BBC One soap.\n\nWhile Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) tried to support him, Alfie decided he needed a break from life in Walford after undergoing surgery for his cancer.\n\nThis prompted him to escape the Square with very little warning but he recently returned to the fictional London borough.\n\nDuring his ordeal, Alfie has also received the support of good friend Linda Carter (Kellie Bright), who soap fans were convinced would embark on a romantic relationship with the soap icon.\n\nHowever, in scenes due to air next week, Alfie's former wife Kat Slater makes a huge decision to support him as he goes through further treatment for his illness.\n\nComing up, Alfie attends an appointment to have his first hormone injection and he is privately glad that Kat chooses to go with him.\n\nBut could it lead to something more?\n\nHow will Phil react to Kat's decision to support her ex-husband?\n\nUpon his initial return to Albert Square in September, 2022, Alfie tried to get Kat's attention ahead of her wedding to Phil Mitchell.\n\nAlfie tried to sabotage the ceremony as he admitted he couldn't live another day without Kat while Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean) did the same in a bid to get back with Phil, her own former spouse.\n\nViewers of the London-based program have been hoping for a reunion between Alfie and Kat but the latter is now married to Phil Mitchell after initially postponing their wedding last year.\n\nAnd a reconciliation seems more likely than ever as Alfie continues to keep one of Phil's dirty secrets - his romp with Emma Harding (Patsy Kensit) which took place shortly before he tied the knot with Kat.\n\nCould Alfie tell Kat everything he knows?\n\nWhile this remains to be seen, Kat and Phil's marriage is jeopardised even further by the recent revelation that he is Albie Watts' biological father.\n\nAs viewers will recall, Sharon Watts was told that her three-year-old son was diagnosed with a genetic condition, which had to be passed down to him by both of his parents.\n\nThe blonde bombshell and her fianc√© Keanu Taylor (Danny Walters) underwent some tests which confirmed she was a carrier of the gene - but her beau wasn't.\n\nThis immediately led her to the conclusion that her son Albie had never been the product of her affair with Keanu but was in fact Phil Mitchell's youngest child.\n\nHow will it affect Phil's marriage to Kat?\n\nAre they headed for the rocks?\n\nWill Kat decide Alfie is the only man for her?\n\nEastEnders airs from Monday to Thursday at 7.30pm on BBC One."
