        "text": "Steve McFadden is best known for his role of EastEnders resident bad boy Phil Mitchell.\n\nPhil has been making waves on Albert Square since 1990 with his fellow Mitchell family members such as brother Grant, mum Peggy and cousins Ronnie and Roxy.\n\nFather to Ben and Louise, Phil has had various lovers during his time on the show, including Kathy Beale, Shirley Carter and currently Sharon Mitchell.\n\nPhil has finally made his return to EastEnders much to the shock of his wife Sharon - who has been enjoying a steamy love affair with 19-year-old Keanu Taylor - and fans can't wait to see what explosive family drama it brings.\n\nBut what about Phil's family in real life? Does Steve McFadden have a family and kids of his own?\n\nThe BBC actor is not married and has five children in total, but is incredibly private about them.\n\nHe has a son named Matthew, who is thought to be 30, with his ex-girlfriend Sue Marshall.\n\nSteve also has two daughters with former partner Angela Bostock, a 20-year-old named Teona and a 14-year-old too.\n\nIn 2009, Steve became a father again to another daughter with Rachel Sidwell. However, they reportedly split a couple of months later.\n\nIn 2016, Steve and his partner Karen Cairns welcomed their first baby daughter.\n\nA source close to the couple revealed to The Sun at the time: \"Steve and Karen are both over the moon.\"\n\n\"Her pregnancy did come as a surprise, but now they are both really happy.\""
