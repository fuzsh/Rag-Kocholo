        "text": "EastEnders spoilers follow.\n\nCallum Highway has found himself in harm's way in EastEnders after his husband Ben Mitchell's demands in EastEnders.\n\nLast week, Ben (Max Bowden) demanded that Halfway (Tony Clay) quit his job with the police because of his trust issues with his new spouse.\n\nThe impact of Ben's ultimatum rippled through Monday's (June 7) episode when Callum promised Ben he'd at least think about resigning, even though he was deeply conflicted.\n\nLater, Ben's father Phil (Steve McFadden) barged into the Slater house to find Callum and his partner Fitzy interviewing Kat (Jessie Wallace) and assumed they were harassing her.\n\nKat finally got Phil in check when she revealed she'd been mugged, but he'd been too busy ranting at Callum to even notice how traumatic the experience had been for her.\n\nWhile Phil tried to make peace with Kat by offering to lease the laundrette and run it together, Callum and Fitzy went to work investigating the mugging around the Square.\n\nThe duo eventually spotted a shady man fitting the description of Kat's mugger in the Square. As they approached to question him, the man took off running.\n\nHalfway and Fitzy split up to chase the mugger through the marketplace and various alleys. Eventually, Callum and Fitzy came face-to-face — but Halfway couldn't warn Fitzy of the danger he was in.\n\nFitzy turned to find the robber right behind him. The robber stabbed Fitzy in the stomach and then held up the knife in Callum's direction.\n\n\"You ain't taking me nowhere,\" he snarled.\n\nCallum was left horrified as his partner slumped to the ground, while the mugger threatened him with the blade. Will Halfway make it out of this encounter alive?\n\nEastEnders continues for a double bill on Tuesday (June 8) at 7.30pm and 7.55pm on BBC One.\n\nDigital Spy now has a newsletter – sign up to get it sent straight to your inbox.\n\nRead more Hollyoaks spoilers on our dedicated homepage\n\nWant up-to-the-minute soaps news, spoilers and gossip on your social feeds?
