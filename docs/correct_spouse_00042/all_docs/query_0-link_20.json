        "text": "Steve McFadden has been in EastEnders as Phil Mitchell for more than three decades since he joined the popular soap in 1990.\n\nPhil is known for being the son of Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor), and the brother of Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp) and Sam Mitchell (Danniella Westbrook).\n\nThe hardman character is also famous for having a string of romances with various residents of Walford's Albert Square over the years including Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean), Lisa Fowler (Lucy Benjamin) and Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace).\n\nThroughout his time on the square, Steve’s character Phil has been caught up in some pretty dramatic storylines, one of which saw him sent to prison for being involved in Vincent Hubbard's death.\n\nBut away from the cameras, Steve has also led a colourful love life too, including becoming a father with his childhood sweetheart, multiple relationships and dating one of his EastEnders' co-stars.\n\nOK! takes a look inside Steve's love life...\n\nSteve, who is the father to five children, is in a long-term relationship with his girlfriend Karen Cairns.\n\nVery little is known about Karen as the couple prefer to keep their relationship out of the spotlight. But the actor also has four children with three of his previous partners.\n\nSteve was first in a relationship with his childhood sweetheart Sue Marshall.\n\nTogether the couple had one child called Matt, who is reported to be around 37, but the couple's romance did not last and they parted ways.\n\nSteve then began a relationship with Angela Bostock, who he met at a party in Salisbury in 1995. But the couple briefly split when Steve began a romance with his EastEnders co-star Lucy Benjamin in 1999.\n\nLucy played one of Phil's ex-wives, Lisa Fowler, and the pair were together for four years.\n\nBut Steve and Angela got back together after his relationship with Lucy came to an end, and the couple went on to have two daughters together, Teona and Mollie Jane, before splitting for good in 2005.\n\nHe then had a relationship with Dr Rachel Sidwell who he reportedly met while on the school run in 2008 and were together for more than a year. They also welcomed a daughter together called Amelie Tinkerbell in September 2009.\n\nHe told OK! Magazine at the time: \"I'm happier now than I've ever been. I can't wait to start having more now.\n\n\"The day she was born was one of the greatest of my life.\"\n\nSteve has since found long-term love with his girlfriend Karen Cairns, who he has been in a relationship with for nearly a decade.\n\nThe couple welcomed their daughter Frankie in June 2016 and a source told the Sun: \"Steve and Karen are both over the moon with little Frankie.\n\n\"Her pregnancy did come as a surprise, but now they are both really happy.\""
