        "text": "The mystery surrounding Walford newcomer George Knight (Colin Salmon) is set to deepen, as Linda (Kellie Bright)’s suspicions about his missing ex-wife Rose continue.\n\nRose – mother of his daughters Anna (Molly Rainford) and Gina (Francesca Henry), abandoned them nine years ago, and the family have heard nothing from her ever since.\n\nWith Linda left furious at the Knights’ arrival, she’s been looking to dig up dirt on George ever since in a bid to rid her pub of the family.\n\nAnd in next week’s episodes she discovers from Callum (Tony Clay) that while he has a clean criminal record all access to information on Rose is denied – leading Linda to suspect foul play.\n\nWhen confronted by Phil (Steve McFadden) during a round at the Boxing Den, George insists Linda has got it wrong – but is he hiding a dark secret related to his ex-wife?\n\nColin Salmon admits that George is angered by this – and the ring might not be the best place to approach the subject with the former champion boxer.\n\n‘Phil approaches George and tells him what’s going down. So, George is like, ‘OK, Linda’s been talking to Phil,’ and that angers him a little bit,’ he said.\n\n‘George is very conscious of who the alphas are. He thinks it’s a bit treacherous of Linda to go to Phil when she could have just asked him. But now she’s started to rattle the cage, which for George is a dangerous cage to rattle because it’s very, very painful.\n\nHowever, the actor admitted George may well understand her hostility towards the character, given the circumstances.\n\nI think because George has been through similar things with Rose, he sort of gets it. He has more empathy with Linda than I think people realise because he knows where she’s coming from,’ he said.\n\n‘He is trying to be tolerant because he gets it – the Knights have all just arrived in her life, and it’s hard. I mean, the last stranger who moved into The Vic was Janine, and she took Linda’s husband.’\n\nHe added: ‘George has been living under a cloud. Some people think he killed Rose, so it’s been nine years of mystery and heartache on top of suspicion and misunderstanding.\n\n‘It’s hard if you are a member of a family and your spouse has gone missing, everyone thinks they know what’s going on.’\n\nWith all sorts of theories currently popping up as to the identity of Rose – with one even suggesting the storyline could tie in with the much-vaunted return of Cindy Beale to Walford – we’ll have to hang in there to see whether we do find out what happened to her.\n\nFor the time being though, we’ve got some cracking scenes to look forward to between Colin and EastEnders veteran Steve McFadden – with the 61-year-old admitting how much he’s been enjoying working with the soap legend.\n\nThe scenes I’ve done with Steve McFadden have been really important,’ he said.\n\nTo me, Steve is EastEnders. I trusted him immediately, and that, as an actor, is everything because it means we can go to places knowing we are safe with each other. That’s been brilliant because his respect is important to me as an actor, and Phil’s respect is important to George as a character.\n\nEastEnders continues on BBC One on Thursday night at 7.30pm.\n\nIf you’ve got a soap or TV story, video or pictures get in touch by emailing us soaps@metro.co.uk – we’d love to hear from you.\n\nJoin the community by leaving a comment below and stay updated on all things soaps on our homepage.\n\nMORE : EastEnders spoilers: Lily in danger, Nish arrested and Kathy plans Lola’s wake\n\nMORE : 12 soap spoilers: EastEnders Nish comeuppance, Emmerdale Caleb left to die, Coronation Street Stephen quizzed, Hollyoaks ordeal"
