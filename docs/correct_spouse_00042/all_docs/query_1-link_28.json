        "text": "EastEnders star Steve McFadden has become one of the most recognisable soap actors of all time, having first joined the hit BBC One soap back in 1990.\n\nThe actor, 64, shot to fame as resident gangster Phil Mitchell and has won numerous awards over the years. He's taken on some hard-hitting storylines during his time in Walford, ranging from alcoholism and addiction, right through to attempted murder and even getting shot!\n\nHowever his most recent storyline has been a little more lighthearted, as he's set to tie the knot with on-screen wife Kat Slater in tonight's episode, 21 September.\n\nAs we wait to see what's next for Albert Square icon Phil, here we take a look into Steve McFadden's life away from the cameras...\n\nEarly life\n\nSteve hails from Westminster, London, and was born to parents Robert and Barbara Mallet Reid.\n\nSoon after he was born in 1959, his parents split and his mother married a man called John McFadden, and Steve then took his stepfather's surname.\n\nThe soap star worked various jobs after leaving school in 1975, including labouring roles and carrot picking, before attending university.\n\nAfter university, he went on to study acting at RADA, and in 1987 he finally made his acting debut when he landed a small role in the film The Firm.\n\nEastEnders cast\n\nSteve joined the cast of EastEnders in 1990, and he and fellow actor Ross Kemp were cast as brothers Phil and Grant Mitchell, with Barbara Windsor playing the boys' mother, Peggy Mitchell.\n\nThe pair wreaked havoc on the residents of Albert Square, and while Ross eventually left the soap, Steve has continued to portray Phil, with the character now easily one of the most recognisable and much loved staples of the series.\n\nThroughout his time on EastEnders, Phil has been embroiled in a number of exciting storylines ranging from hard hitting topics such as alcohol and addiction battles, through to being caught up in more than his fair share of love triangles over the years!\n\nMarried five times on screen and the father to eight children (including his stepsons and adoptive son) - it's safe to say Phil has been at the heart of Walford throughout his time on the show.\n\nDuring his soap career, Steve has won numerous awards, including Best Soap Actor at the Inside Soap Awards, as well as Outstanding Achievement Award at The British Soap Awards in 2016.\n\nDuring his EastEnders stint, the actor has also starred in the film Kevin & Perry Go Large, where he portrayed a bouncer, and 2006 film Provoked, where he was cast as DS Ron Meyers.\n\nPersonal life and net worth\n\nThe highly successful soap star is now believed to be worth a whopping £2.5million, mainly thanks to his 30 year stint on EastEnders.\n\nAway from Albert Square, Steve can be found spending time with his five children.\n\nSteve shares his eldest son Matt McFadden, who is now believed to be in his mid-thirties, with childhood sweetheart Sue Marshall. He then welcomed two daughters, Teona and Mollie Jane, with previous partner Angela Bostock.\n\nIn 2009, he became a father for the fourth time when then-girlfriend Rachel Sidwell gave birth to daughter Amelie Tinkerbell. The couple enjoyed a brief relationship before splitting two months after Amelie's birth.\n\nSteve welcomed his fifth child, a daughter named Frankie, in June 2016 with long-term girlfriend Karen Cairns. The couple are believed to have been in a relationship for a number of years, and are still together.\n\nWhile Steve tends to keep his love life and family out of the limelight, he did enjoy one high-profile romance back in the early 2000s."
