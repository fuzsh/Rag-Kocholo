Please remember that absence of a name does not mean the individual is not buried there, nor does the presence of a name mean that interment there is a certainty. This project is a work-in-progress between our library system and Fort Bend County/Fort Bend County Historical Association. Any information for corrections from our patrons is welcome; please call 281-341-2608 or email genref@fortbend.lib.tx.us.\n\nIf clicking on a name does not lead directly to the obituary or death record, please clear your browser's internet cache and retry your search."
