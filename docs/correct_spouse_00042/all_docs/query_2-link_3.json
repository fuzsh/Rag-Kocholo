        "text": "Eastenders star Steve McFadden has been dumped by the mother of his two-month-old baby.\n\nDr Rachel Sidwell has got back together with her surgeon husband - the man she left for the actor.\n\nSteve, 50, who plays Albert Square hardman Phil Mitchell, fell for mum-of-four Rachel while doing the school run with his other children last year.\n\nBut he's been left devastated after Rachel, 42, returned to hubby Dr James Green despite giving birth to Steve's daughter Amelie Tinkerbell in June.\n\nShe is now living back in the marital home - just 10 minutes away from Steve's house in Finchley, North London.\n\nA source close to the star said: \"Steve is more than heartbroken by the split.\n\n\"Rachel realised she'd made a mistake with Steve and her husband welcomed her back with open arms.\"\n\nSteve recently expressed his joy at becoming a dad again, saying: \"This is a very exciting time for me, it's like a fresh start.\"\n\nJust like his TV character, Steve has a complicated romantic past. He has a son with teen sweetheart Sue Marshall and two daughters with ex-girlfriend Angela Bostock. He also had a tempestuous affair with co-star Lucy Benjamin."
