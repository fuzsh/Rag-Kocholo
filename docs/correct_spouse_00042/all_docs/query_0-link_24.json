        "text": "Byline: STEPHEN MOYES\n\nTHE distraught ex-lover of EastEnders star Steve McFadden hugs their baby daughter as she walks around a park in a daze yesterday.\n\nFriends of Dr Rachel Sidwell, 38, said they are worried about her health after her break-up with Steve, 50, who plays Phil Mitchell. They revealed her weight has plummeted and she keeps bursting into tears as she struggles to cope with the stress of bringing up twomonth-old Amelie Tinkerbell alone.\n\nOne friend said: \"Rachel's doing the best she can in the circumstances but she gave up her husband, children and a contented and fulfilling life to be with Steve.\n\n\"It was a case of love at first sight when she met Steve. But it all turned sour very quickly. Rachel is a different person now.\n\n\"She cries all day and feels lost and unloved. It's tragic to see her so sad.\"\n\nRachel left her surgeon husband and three children after meeting Steve on the school run last year.\n\nThey moved in together in Highgate, North London, and Rachel soon discovered she was pregnant.\n\nBut shortly after Amelie was born Rachel moved back in with her husband.\n\nCAPTION(S):\n\nSTUNNED Dr Rachel Sidwell yesterday BREAK-UP EastEnders' Steve McFadden"
