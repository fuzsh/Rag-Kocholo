        "text": "Byline: STEPHEN MOYES\n\nTHE distraught ex-lover of EastEnders star Steve McFadden hugs their baby daughter as she walks around a park in a daze.\n\nFriends of Dr Rachel Sidwell say they are worried about her health in the wake of her break-up with Steve, who plays Phil Mitchell.\n\nThey say her weight has plummeted and she keeps bursting into tears as she struggles to cope with the stress of bringing up two-month-old Amelie Tinkerbell alone.\n\nOne friend said: \"Rachel's doing the best she can in the circumstances but gave up her life to be with Steve. She chose to leave her husband and children and give up a contented and fulfilling life.\n\n\"It was a case of love at first sight when she met Steve. But it all turned sour very quickly. Rachel is a different person now. She was warm, curvy and bubbly. Now she's shedding pounds every day.\n\n\"She cries all day and feels lost and unloved. It's tragic to see her so sad.\"\n\nRachel left her surgeon husband and three children after meeting 50-year-old Steve on the school run last year.\n\nThey moved in together in Highgate, North London, and Rachel, 38, soon discovered she was pregnant. In June she and Steve posed for pictures in OK! magazine and talked happily of their wedding plans.\n\nHe said: \"I love her so much and she's so clever. It shows opposites attract. She has so many letters after her name and I can't argue with her because I'm too out of my depth.\"\n\nBut shortly after Amelie was born Rachel moved out and back in with her husband.\n\nThe friend said: \"With nowhere else to go she's back in the marital home, but she is not back together with her husband.\n\n\"She feels shunned. The worst thing about it all is that she still thinks things could work out with Steve. She's invested everything in that relationship.\"\n\nA week ago Rachel was questioned by police after a row outside the actor's house.\n\nSteve also has a son and two daughters by two former girlfriends.\n\nCAPTION(S):\n\nBREAK-UP EastEnders star Steve McFadden"
