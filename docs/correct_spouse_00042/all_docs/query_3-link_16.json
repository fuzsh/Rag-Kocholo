        "text": "Philip \"Phil\" Mitchell is a long-standing resident of Albert Square. He is the eldest son of Eric and Peggy Mitchell, the older brother of Grant and Sam Mitchell, and the father of Ben and Louise Mitchell. Phil has been married five times, to Nadia Boravac in 1993, Kathy Beale in 1995, Kate Morton in 2003, Sharon Watts in 2014 and Kat Slater in 2023. Phil has a tough persona and has often resorted to violence. Despite this, however, his family is important to him â€“ particularly his relationships with his younger brother Grant and mother Peggy. Originally portrayed as the nicer of two thugs alongside Grant, Phil developed a nastier side when Grant left in 1999 after betraying his older brother. Phil has committed almost every crime thinkable and has developed a reputation as the local villain but his softer side does still emerge from time to time.\n\nPhil and his brother Grant moved to Walford in February 1990 to open an automobile repair shop, known as The Arches. Phil was originally the calmer brother as Grant was more the hot headed one in their early days, but both brothers had a sense of physical danger, displaying stereotypical masculinity, thuggish behaviour and a tendency to resolve problems through violence and began to be the local hardmen on Albert Square.\n\nPhil was originally the one who often thought things through, and was seen to be the more streetwise of the two, often bailing his more spontaneous brother out of trouble. However by the late 1990s to early 2000s, Phil was driven down a darker, more destructive route. Over the years Phil has somewhat built a 'empire' from being just a dodgy criminal to a full time gangster. Phil has committed many crimes such as countless assaults, robberies, money laundering, manslaughter and attempted murders.\n\nPhil has had numerous feuds with residents with the likes of Mark and Martin Fowler, Steve Owen, Dan Sullivan, Dennis Rickman, Den Watts, Johnny Allen, Patrick Trueman Derek, Jack and Max Branning, and most notably of all, Ian Beale. He has also had many near-death experiences, such as crashing into the River Thames with Grant in 1999 and being shot by his ex-girlfriend Lisa Shaw in 2001. Phil set The Queen Victoria on fire in 2010 after believing his mother Peggy loved the pub more than her own son. In the 1990s, Phil became an alcoholic. Staying sober was a constant battle for Phil and one he didn't always win, with him falling off the wagon several times over the following years.\n\nHistory[]\n\nBackstory[]\n\nPhillip James Mitchell was born on the 20th January 1961, the eldest child of Eric Mitchell and Peggy Mitchell. His brother Grant Mitchell was born on the 8th July 1962. Phil and Grant were close as children. Phil was abused a lot by his alcoholic father Eric, who rarely touched Grant. This lead Phil to be hurt that he was singled out for abuse by his dad. Phil and Grant could be wayward, and often got into scrapes. At school they became best friends with Nigel Bates, who the Mitchell's saw as a brother to them. Nigel was naive, so the Mitchell brothers sorted out anyone who tried to pick on Nigel.\n\nOne time when Phil was about twelve, during the middle of the night, Phil was asleep, his father came stumbling into Phil's bedroom and he punched Phil in the stomach without a reason. Phil use to go school scared stiff that teachers would see the bruises.\n\nPeggy considered leaving when Phil and Grant were teenagers, and once even tried to seduce Johnny Allen, but he turned her down. Peggy tried to save her marriage by having another child and in 1975 her only daughter Sam. Eric stopped abusing Phil when Phil eventually hit him back knocking him out cold, Peggy called the police on Eric for his abuse and he was arrested. Phil was always the calmer Mitchell brother but both had thuggish tendencies. In the late 1970s, Grant joined the army. Phil worked on the lorries for a time where he met Minty Peterson.\n\n1990-2000: Early years in Walford[]\n\nPhil Mitchell first arrived in Walford to open an automobile repair shop, known as The Arches. Just feet away, Rod Norman and Harry Osbourne were sitting in the Square gardens. They had seen Phil zip into the square in his car. Twenty nine year-old Phil made his first appearance in Albert Square, buying the mechanics, The Arches. Him and Grant have a brief fling with Julie Cooper.\n\nPhil goes into a partnership with The Queen Victoria public house, along with his younger brother, Grant Mitchell, and Grant's fiancÃ©e, Sharon Watts but they buy the upstairs house above it. Phil and Grant had a reputation for being a bit dodgy. Grant had a thuggish side, and even Phil showed thuggish tendencies but usually was more level headed. He often kept Grant in check. In 1992, Grant became increasingly moody and unsupportive of his new wife Sharon. Phil comforted her and one time slept with her, something he regretted.\n\nFollowing a break-up from lover, Anne Howes, Phil and Sharon grow closer. Sharon would usually turn to him when she and Grant had a row or Grant gained physical violence. They sleep together, but she chooses to stay with Grant. Grant ended up in jail and in his absence, he and Sharon reconcile their affair. But when Grant is released from prison as a reformed man, she decides to reconcile with him and she leaves a broken-hearted Phil.\n\nMeanwhile, Phil meets a Romanian refugee, Nadia Borovac, who wants to stay in the UK. To avoid deportation, he had enter a marriage of convenience with her, in July 1993, but Nadia departs after the ceremony. Phil later falls in love with businesswoman, Kathy Beale. Nadia returns and makes his life hell, she seduced Phil, which he denied. Phil had wanted to marry Kathy that year but in order to do that, he needs a divorce from Nadia. Nadia would only agreed to divorce if Phil paid her Â£1,000 in order to move to Germany. He gave her the money and she was never seen again.\n\nIn early 1994, Phil bought a flat for a pittance off Frank Butcher. He also bought Frank's share of the cafe for a knockdown price for his new girlfriend Kathy Beale. Phil returned the favour by torching cash strapped Frank's car lot so Frank could claim on the insurance. By accident, a vagrant died in the fire. The police interrogated Phil and Frank but could get no evidence. Phil told Frank to hold it together, one wrong word and they could be arrested and serve a prison sentence for a long time. Frank later legged it after the insurance man saw his business accounts which would have shown Frank was broke and the fire was arson. Phil started drinking and confessed to Grant but Grant told him to stop drinking. Phil got on with his life, sure that Frank was not coming back.\n\nIn October 1994, Michelle and Sharon taped a conversation about their lives in general, but Sharon also admitted she slept with Phil, and the cassette was left lying around. Grant played it on the way home from the brewery and found out. He fell apart and attacked Phil in the Arches, but Phil wanted him to so he could be punished. Phil ended up in hospital. While recovering, Phil and Grant patched things up and they blamed it on Sharon, saying she did all the running.\n\nPhil married Kathy in 1995 and she was soon pregnant. But in late 1995, after almost 2 years away, Frank returned to Albert Square, having been released from a psychiatric hospital. This caused Phil to start drinking again, worried that Frank would go to the police over the car lot scam. Kathy and Phil eventually sort out their differences and get married. Kathy gives birth to Ben. Phil feels neglected and depressed so turns to alcohol, developing an addiction. He becomes neglectful of Ben, so Kathy leaves him. Realising what he has lost, Phil gives up drinking to rebuild his marriage. He attends Alcoholics Anonymous, which helps reveal the basis of his problem, the physical abuse he received from his father and his fear he will do the same to Ben. Kathy takes him back but when he attends counselling, he begins an affair with a fellow alcoholic named Lorna Cartwright, who later starts stalking him. With their relationship in jeopardy, Phil takes Kathy to Paris, hoping that it can bring them closer, but it has the opposite effect when Phil confesses to the affair and Kathy throws her wedding ring into the river. Phil begins sleeping rough, gambling, and blaming Kathy for his decline. Kathy decides to leave Walford to live in South Africa, letting it be known that an offer of reconciliation from Phil would make her reconsider. Phil waits until the last minute but is stalled by Lorna, who locks herself in his bathroom and attempts suicide. Kathy leaves for the airport and Phil follows but is accosted by Kathy's son Ian, who persuades him that Kathy is better off without him. Phil agonises over the loss of his son.\n\nIn 1998, Frank was dating Peggy and Phil initially disapproved, due to knowing how Frank left Pat in the lurch a few years previously. In 1999, Phil was back on track but Grant slept with Kathy when she visited Walford, knowing Phil wanted to get back with her. Phil fell apart when he found out. Grant then emigrated and Phil had lost one more chance to be with his wife and son Ben. Phil turned to drink again and spent the rest of 1999 depressed. Kathy returned briefly in late 1999 and Phil begged her for another chance, even for their son's sake. Kathy rejected Phil and in early January 2000 she flew back to South Africa with their son. Phil tried to get over Kathy and wanted to focus on new girl friend Lisa but he soon realised he loved Kathy more and could not get over her.\n\nDue to losing his son, his brother betraying him and then losing the love of his life, and being unable to get over Kathy, Phil developed a nastier, more menacing side, he became more like his brother Grant in personality. He started to become increasingly violent and even started to treat Lisa badly. In April 2000, Phil started dabbling in stolen cars and even beat Ian Beale up when he got Lisa sacked. Phil hit Lisa on Christmas Day 2000 when he slept with Melanie Healy that day.\n\n2000-2003: Villainous Years[]\n\nHe starts seeing Lisa Shaw, but the relationship stalls when Kathy returns briefly, continuing an affair with Grant. However, before she is due to return to South Africa, she asks Phil to leave with her. Phil cannot go as Grant has planned an armed robbery and Phil will not let his brother do the job alone. Infuriated with Phil's loyalty to Grant, Kathy reveals their recent tryst, leading to Phil confronting Grant after the heist and Grant confessing that he slept with Kathy to get revenge on Phil for sleeping with Sharon. While trying to escape the police in a getaway car, Phil pulls out a handgun and shoots at the dashboard, which causes Grant to crash into the River Thames. Phil is rescued, but Grant's body is not recovered, though he survives and flees to Brazil. When Grant sends Phil his half of The Queen Victoria, he sells it to Dan Sullivan for five pounds to spite Peggy due to her favouritism towards Grant.\n\nPhil and Dan's allegiance ends after Dan tells the police about a motor scam Phil has been involved in, and Phil cons Dan into giving control of the pub back to Peggy. Phil is unsupportive when Lisa has a miscarriage and she becomes unstable. He turns his attention to her best friend Melanie Healy and they sleep together. Phil grows jealous when Melanie reunites with Steve Owen and becomes abusive to Lisa. Thinking a baby will improve things, Lisa stops taking her contraceptive pills. However, Melanie overhears Phil stating he does not want another baby, so she encourages Lisa to end the relationship, confessing to their affair. Lisa leaves Phil, and unknown to him, she is pregnant with his baby. Mark Fowler persuades her to pretend the baby is his. Phil gains many enemies: Lisa, Steve, who had discovered Mel slept with Phil, Ian, who wants revenge for Phil's bullying, Mark, who wants to avenge Lisa and Dan.\n\nOn Steve and Mel's wedding night, Phil is shot in the back by someone hiding in the bushes, collapsing in a pool of blood, and is hospitalised. Steve is prime suspect and is arrested. However, it was not Steve and after being discharged from hospital a month later, Phil confronts the real culprit, Lisa. She had stolen Steve's gun in a moment of madness. Realising he drove Lisa to it, Phil decides to let her off and frames Dan for the deed with the help of Ritchie Stringer, who supplies Dan with the gun. Not realising he is being set up, Dan holds Phil at gunpoint, demanding money. However, the police arrive, arresting Dan for attempted murder. Steve is called as a witness at Dan's trial and Phil persuades him to give a false testimony, further implicating Dan, but to everyone's astonishment he is found not guilty. Dan seeks revenge, so he kidnaps Mel, the only common link between Phil and Steve, threatening to kill her unless they each give him Â£100,000, they work together to rescue Mel but Dan escapes with the money.\n\nPhil begins a second relationship with Sharon, who has returned, and they run the Queen Victoria together. Phil wants children, but Sharon reveals she is infertile and tells him Lisa's baby, Louise, is really his daughter. Phil ends their relationship and confronts Lisa, demanding to be part of his child's life. Steve offers to take Lisa to California, but when she is unable to leave, Steve absconds with Louise. Phil is informed and chases after Steve in his car. Steve crashes into a wall and Phil rescues Louise but cannot save Steve, who dies when the car explodes. Phil knows he must win Lisa back to gain custody of Louise, and Lisa is easily swayed. Phil slowly begins excluding Lisa from Louise's life, so in desperation, Lisa flees to Portugal with Louise. Phil's nephew Jamie helps her escape, earning him a beating from Phil. Phil goes to Portugal and returns a month later with Louise. Some of Phil's neighbours suspect he has murdered Lisa.\n\n2003-2005: Feud with Den Watts and temporary departure[]\n\nPhil falls for Kate Morton, not knowing she is an undercover police officer, investigating Lisa's disappearance. After gaining a confession from Phil that he manipulated Lisa into handing over Louise, Kate reveals her true identity, and says she loves him and will quit her job, but Phil threatens to kill her. Kate disappears, but several months later, Phil finds her while she is working undercover for the square's gangland boss Jack Dalton. Soon Phil rescues Kate's life when Jack orders his hitman George Peters to kill her, Phil later manages to convince Jack to call off the hit, but in so doing gets himself indebted to Jack when he says that Phil now owes him a favour. Kate then moves in with Phil.\n\nLater on Jack orders Phil to kill Sharon's half-brother Dennis Rickman, so Phil corners Dennis at gunpoint, but Dennis tells Phil he will kill Jack so they can both be free of him, which he does. Phil and Dennis vow to keep their involvement in Jack's murder to themselves, but Phil later tells mobster and Jack's second-in-command Andy Hunter the truth about the incident. Dennis is enraged by Phil's betrayal and demands that they settle the score with a fight. Phil hires a group of men to deal with Dennis instead.\n\nPhil and Kate go on to marry, but Lisa arrives, demanding access to Louise. She plans to shoot Phil again but fails. She breaks down until Sharon and Dennis' illegitimate father, Den Watts vows to get revenge on Phil for her and for having his son Dennis beaten up. Den plans an armed robbery and coaxes Phil into joining him, but Den, with Dennis' assistance, sets Phil up and he is arrested. Kate is forced to give Louise back to Lisa and they leave Walford together and also sleeps with Dennis while he is in prison, Phil cannot forgive Kate and their marriage ends, Phil manages to escape from prison and vows to go after Den for setting him up.\n\nOn Christmas day 2003 Phil attacks Den in Angies Den, but Den knocks Phil out with a chair when Phil turns his back, when Phil regains consciousness Den offers to give him Â£200,000 as long as as Phil agrees to not come after him, left with little choice due to being on the run Phil takes the money and leaves Walford not being seen again until 2005.\n\n2005-2006: Return to the Square and Feud with Johnny Allen[]\n\nPhil returns in need of money and attacks Ian, who leads him to believe he will help him escape, but Ian calls the police and Phil is jailed again. However, the case falls through after Grant pays a witness to change his testimony and Phil is released. The brothers then return to help their mother exonerate Sam after she is framed for Den's murder by his wife Chrissie, who had killed her husband several months ago. Eventually with Sharon's help, the Mitchell's are successful with their efforts and Chrissie is arrested for Den's murder.\n\nBy this point, Phil has embarked on a feud with the square's newly-established crime boss Johnny Allen, earlier on Johnny waged war on Peggy and has threatened to harm the Mitchell's. The conflict soon escalates when Dennis gets involved in Phil's feud with Johnny, particularly when Johnny later delivers a threatening ultimatum to Sharon, either she and Dennis leave the square for good, otherwise Dennis will be killed. Sharon confides to Phil about Johnny's threat and also reveals that Johnny had killed Andy on the same night Den was killed. Phil subsequently informs Dennis, who then beats up Johnny in revenge. But later on Johnny has Dennis murdered, leaving Phil feeling responsible for ridding Sharon of her husband and also swearing revenge on Johnny more than ever.\n\nIn March 2006, Phil convinces Grant to help him confront Johnny to avenge Sharon's loss by bringing Johnny to justice for Dennis's murder. The brothers arguing allows Johnny to capture them, and Johnny orders his henchman Danny Moon to kill them in the woods. However, they are saved when Danny is accidentally shot dead by his brother Jake, who then reveals to Phil and Grant that it was Danny who Johnny ordered to kill Dennis. Thereafter the Mitchell Brothers witness Johnny being arrested, after he was forced by his daughter Ruby to surrender himself to the police for his gangland crimes, Johnny is sentenced to life imprisonment for killing Andy and ordering Dennis' murder, but months later he dies of a heart attack caused by Ruby's boyfriend Sean Slater.\n\n2006-2010: Bonding with Ben and coping with family problems[]\n\nSoon enough, Phil resolves to bond with his son Ben after it transpires that Kathy has apparently been killed in a road collusion.

Jack tries to blackmail Phil regarding his involvement in a motor scam with entrepreneur Kevin Wicks, which inadvertently kills Kevin. Phil teams up with Jack's brother Max to remove Jack from Walford.\n\nPhil proposes to his girlfriend Suzy Branning when she tells him she is pregnant, but his friend and employee Shirley Carter tells him there is no pregnancy and Suzy is trying to con him. However, Phil stays with Suzy until he discovers she has schemed with his uncle Archie.

The \"Who Shot Phil?\" storyline captured viewer and media interest and the culprit-reveal episode was watched by 22 million viewers.\n\nSharongate[]\n\nOne of the most notable and popular early storylines involving Phil was a love triangle between him, his brother and his brother's wife Sharon (played by Letitia Dean). Despite the fact that Sharon was married to Grant, EastEnders writer Tony Jordan revealed in The Mitchells â€“ The Full Story that the love-triangle storyline had been planned since Phil and Grant's introduction, after the writers decided Sharon was perfect for them both. This storyline was slow burning and spread over several years, providing a plethora of dramatic tension along the way. The episode in which Phil betrayed his brother with Sharon occurred in September 1992 in one of the soap's notorious three-handers.\n\nThings finally came to a head in 1994 with some of EastEnders most popular and renowned episodes, which were dubbed \"Sharongate\" â€“ centred around Grant's discovery of the affair and his reaction. The repercussions of Phil's betrayal contributed to many subsequent storylines involving the Mitchell brothers during the 1990s. Sharongate has also proven a popular storyline with viewers and it was voted the sixth top soap opera moment of the decade in a poll of 17,000 people for What's On TV magazine.\n\nAlcoholism[]\n\nAmong the many issues Phil has been used to cover is alcoholism and the consequences the condition has upon the sufferer's life. The relationship between alcohol abuse and domestic violence was explored between Phil and his wife Kathy (played by Gillian Taylforth) culminating in the slow deterioration of their marriage, which gripped viewers throughout 1997.\n\nOf particular note is an episode where Phil attends Alcoholics Anonymous (February 1997), an \"alien and uncomfortable arena\" where he was forced to talk about his condition, expose his vulnerability and reveal the basis of his problem â€“ the physical abuse he'd received from his father and his fear that he will do the same.\n\nThe Mitchell car crash[]\n\nPhil's disposition altered during the early 2000s when a darker more menacing side to his personality began to surface. This change was perhaps a consequence of Grant's departure, who up until this point had always been depicted as the more selfish, thuggish and nastier of the two. The storyline signifying the departure of Ross Kemp played heavily on the Mitchell brothers' fragile and damaged relationship.\n\nAfter discovering that Grant had vengefully slept with Kathy, Phil went ballistic with a handgun causing the hijacked Vauxhall Astra they were driving to career at high speed into the River Thames, in an episode that was watched by 19.5 million viewers. Shot in London's Docklands, the scenes required stunt doubles, divers and crash test dummies and it has been hailed as \"one of the soap's most dramatic storylines ever.\"\n\nWho shot Phil?[]\n\nPhil's behaviour earned him a number of sworn enemies in Albert Square and by 2001 the character had become one of the soap's nastiest villains. In an interview with The Guardian McFadden commented on his alter ego's descent into villainy \"Phil's been had over by a lot of people, so now he feels like he can do it back. It's his history\". However the character finally received his comeuppance in one of EastEnders most highly anticipated storylines, dubbed \"Who Shot Phil?\". Phil was gunned down outside his home in March 2001 in a \"Dallas-style\" whodunnit mystery. Various key characters were in the frame for the deed and viewers were left guessing for weeks as to which of them was the real culprit. Several outcomes were allegedly filmed[15] and it was reported that only a few TV executives knew the identity of the would-be assassin â€“ even the actors were kept in the dark. A spokesman commented \"The cast are only getting their own scripts. They are not being told anyone else's storylines. Not even Phil knows who shot him. It's top secret.\" Script writers were reportedly given private security after a writer's laptop was stolen in what was believed to be an attempt to gain the identity of the assailant. The storyline captivated the public's imagination leading to thousands of bets being placed at the bookies across the UK â€“ bookmaker William Hill said there was about 50,000 bets on who was responsible.[16]\n\nAn estimated 22 million viewers watched EastEnders on 5 April 2001 to find out that Lisa Shaw â€“ Phil's ex-girlfriend â€“ was the culprit. The episode caused the third-largest power surge on record, and the Liverpool and Barcelona UEFA Cup semi-final was postponed for 10 minutes to accommodate a special 40-minute edition of the soap.\n\nDrug addiction[]\n\nIn June 2010, it was reported that Phil would develop an addiction to crack cocaine after his troubled personal life leads to depression. The report followed the news that Lucy Benjamin was to return for a single episode, reprising her role as Lisa, the mother of Phil's daughter Louise (Brittany Papple). In the storyline, Phil gains custody of Louise after she is dropped off in Walford by an unseen person, however, Peggy eventually returns Louise to Lisa after Phil punches his mother in the face. A spokesperson for the show said \"Lisa Fowler was a major part of Phil's life â€“ she knows him as well as anyone, so she won't be happy about him looking after his daughter. With their history, you know that this storyline is going to be an explosive episode in the Mitchells' history.\" Phil also loses his son Ben (Charlie Jones), who makes a temporary departure from the show in order for the part to be recast. Subsequently, Phil becomes addicted to crack cocaine. Producers worked closely with drug and alcohol charities, including Addaction and DrugScope. Viewers never see Phil take drugs to make sure the episodes are suitable for all audiences. Martin Barnes, chief executive of DrugScope, commented: \"If EastEnders sensitively reflect the impact that drug use has on Phil, it could help. The storyline also sees Phil become more violent.\n\nMcFadden decided to lose weight for the storyline by going on a crash diet, saying that food would not be one of Phil's priorities.\n\nFirst and last lines[]\n\n\"You should see this place, Grant. It is ripe, and I have found the ideal spot.\" (First line, to his brother Grant on the phone)\n\nSee also[]\n\nPhil Mitchell - List of appearances"
