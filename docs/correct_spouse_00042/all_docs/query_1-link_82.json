        "text": "EastEnders has been running since 1985 and over the years has brought a whole host of memorable, lovable and even dislikeable characters onto our screens. And the truth is, you can't help but invest in them whether it's their latest romantic pursuit, their wellbeing or their families. We all love a good half-hour of Enders!\n\nBut, what about some of the cast's real families - which stars have children of their own? From June Brown, who plays Dot Cotton, to Natalie Cassidy, who plays Sonia Fowler, and Tamzin Outhwaite, who plays Mel Owen - it's time to meet their own broodsâ€¦\n\nPatsy Palmer who plays Bianca Jackson\n\nPatsy is back on the Square in 2019 much to her fans' delight. In real life, the actress' life is even more glamorous, as Patsy lives in California with her husband Richard Merkell and their talented brood. Patsy is mum to Charley from her past relationship with boxer Alfie Rothwell. She shares children Fenton, Emilia and Bertie with husband Richard. Interestingly, Patsy's brother, Harry Harris, is married to the actress Lindsey Coulsen who played Bianca's mum Carol in EastEnders. Small world.\n\nTamzin Outhwaite who plays Mel Owen\n\nTamzin Outhwaite was married to Lucifer actor, Tom Ellis, from 2006 to 2014 and they share two daughters together, Marnie Mae Ellis and Florence Elsie Ellis. The pair divorced in 2014 and Tamzin cited adultery. She has since hinted that this was due to more than just a fling, saying to Essentials magazine in 2016: \"I wouldn't not be with my husband over a one-night stand is all I'll say\".\n\nMORE: Soap Star Babies! 10 TV actors who have children together in real life\n\nSteve McFadden who plays Phil Mitchell\n\nHe plays one of the most iconic EastEnders characters, bad boy Phil Mitchell, but in real life, Steve McFadden is a loving dad to five kids, which he has had with four different partners. He had his first child, Matthew, with his childhood sweetheart, Sue Marshall. He had daughters Teona and Mollie with ex-girlfriend, Angela Bostock. He had his daughter Amelie with Rachel Sidwell, who he split with a couple of months after her birth. His current partner, Karen Cairns, is mum to his daughter, Frankie. The couple welcomed her in 2016."
