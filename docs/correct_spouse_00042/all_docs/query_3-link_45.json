        "text": "JESSE McFadden's wife secretly married the convicted sex offender less than a year before he fatally shot her and her three children in a cold-blooded murder-suicide.\n\nA heartbroken Heather Pettigrew said her family was kept in the dark about her sister Holly's marriage to Jesse McFadden, revealing exclusively to The U.S. Sun that they only learned about their nuptials a few months ago.\n\n\"We were told they were married on Christmas Eve,\" Heather said, learning on Tuesday that her sister, Holly Guess, and McFadden had been married for nearly a year.\n\n\"We did not find out that wasn't true until yesterday [Tuesday]. No one in my family even knew the wedding took place.\n\n\"They had a wedding cake at our Christmas Eve party. I am not sure how or when they met. They moved in together right around the beginning of 2021, I believe,\" Heather said.\n\nA marriage license obtained by The U.S. Sun reveals McFadden and Guess legally wedded on May 26, 2022, in an Okmulgee, Oklahoma, courtroom.\n\nHeather, 32, said her sister never spoke or mentioned McFadden's court hearing or criminal history.\n\n\"They argued sometimes, as do every couple, but other than normal arguments, I had no indication of any troubles with any of them,\" she said.\n\nHeather described her older sister as a loving mother whose kids were \"her world.\"\n\n\"Holly was sweet and funny. Super creative and super smart. She snorted like a pig when she laughed, which only made her laugh harder,\" Heather said.\n\nHORRIFIC CRIME SCENE\n\nThe grim discovery came on Monday afternoon as the Okmulgee County Sheriff's Office searched for missing teens Ivy Webster, 14, and Brittany Brewer, 16, after they failed to contact their parents over the weekend.\n\nBrittany's parents said their daughter was staying over at the McFadden family's home, but she knew something was wrong when the 16-year-old didn't call for their usual Saturday chat.\n\n\"I knew something was wrong cause she wasn’t answering my — I mean, I tried to call,\" mom Malaina Schabell told NewsNation.\n\nAt McFadden's farmhouse, authorities found the bodies of seven victims, including that of the convicted sex offender and Ivy and Brittany.\n\nFour additional bodies, including McFadden's wife, Guess, 35, and her three kids, Rylee Elizabeth Allen, 17; Michael James Mayo, 15, and Tiffany Dore Guess, 13, were also found.\n\nOn Wednesday, Okmulgee County Sheriff officials revealed the convicted sex offender shot and killed all his victims and then turned the gun on himself in a twisted murder-suicide plot.\n\nEach of the victims was shot one to three times in the head, Okmulgee Police Chief Joe Prentice said.\n\nPrentice said that it appeared the teens and mother were gunned down while they tried to escape the sadistic gunman at his farmhouse in Henryetta, about 50 miles south of Tulsa.\n\nAll the bodies were found outside but detectives believe the remains could have been staged after their deaths, local Fox affiliate KOKI-TV reported.\n\n\"People who perpetrate crimes like this are evil,\" Prentice said when asked about the motive.\n\n\"Normal folks like us can't understand it.\"\n\nDARK PAST\n\nMcFadden, 39, spent 17 years behind bars after being convicted of sexually assaulting Krystle Strong, who was 16 years old at the time, in 2003.\n\nHe was released in 2020 and was scheduled to appear in court on the day of the murders for allegedly soliciting child pornography from a teen with a contraband cell phone while in prison.\n\nHeather branded McFadden a \"psycho\" who manipulated her sister \"from day one.\"\n\n\"I don't believe she ever had any clue as to who he really was,\" she said. \"Psychos like him are good at smooth talking and manipulation.\n\n\"She was lied to and manipulated from day one. She would never have knowingly put her children or anyone's children in that danger.\n\n\"I didn't know him well, only met him a few times, and he mostly stayed in his computer room except when he came out to eat.\n\n\"I had no idea about his past or that he was capable of these horrible actions.\"\n\nHeather and Holly's mother, Janette Mayo, 59, also previously said that her daughter and grandchildren were \"manipulated and controlled\" by McFadden.\n\n\"He lied to my daughter, and he convinced her it was all just a huge mistake,\" Mayo told The Associated Press.\n\n\"He was very demure. He was very standoffish, generally very quiet, but he kept my daughter and the kids basically under lock and key.\n\n\"He had to know where they were at all times, which sent red flags up,\" the heartbroken grandmother added."
