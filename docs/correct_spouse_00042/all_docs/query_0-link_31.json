A source told the newspaper: \"Steve and Karen are both over the moon with little Frankie. Her pregnancy did come as a surprise, but now they are both really happy.\"\n\nThe 57-year-old already shares a son, Matt McFadden, 28, with Sue Marshall, two daughters, Teona, 18, and Mollie Jane, 12, with Angela Bostock, and Amelie Tinkerbell, 7, with Rachel Sidwell.\n\nCLICK TO VIEW GALLERY\n\nSteve has become a father for the fifth time, according to reports\n\nThe star has had plenty to celebrate recently, as he also recently won the Outstanding Achievement accolade at the British Soap Awards for his role as Phil Mitchell from EastEnders, a role he began playing in 1990.\n\nSteve was particularly praised for his acting after his character came to terms with his mother, Peggy Mitchell's, death. Dame Barbara Windsor's role at the Queen Vic's iconic landlady came to an end after discovering her cancer was terminal and taking an overdose, saying: \"I will die as I have lived. Straight back, head high, like a queen.\"\n\nThe happy couple have named their daughter Frankie\n\nSpeaking of saying goodbye to the role, Barbara said: \"Peggy is a character close to my heart, but I made the decision a while ago that I need to say goodbye to Peggy once and for all, as otherwise she will always be there, urging me to go back, and that is something I need to shut the door on.\n\n\"And I thought that whilst the guvnor, who I adore, is still in charge I want him to be the one to oversee it. I am grateful that Dominic has accepted my decision and together, since late last summer, we have been secretly plotting Peggy's last scenes.\""
