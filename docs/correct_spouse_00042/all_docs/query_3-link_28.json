BUT with the endless stress of daily responsibilities it can be tough to keep those same loving feelings that you felt when you said “I do.” As one of your 2019 resolutions, you might want to include a challenge to yourself to fall back in love with your spouse this month. Your marriage doesn't have to be rocky to fall out of love with your spouse. Sometimes your marriage becomes bland and stale, and you just drift apart. . It is hard work, but someone must be willing to be the first to break the cycle if a relationship is to be restored. If a relationship has grown sour, then neither party is acting as they once did someone must take the initiative to break the cycle. Is it worth it to you? Is the salvation of your home, the stability of your children, the sacredness of your commitment, and the sanctity of your own well-being and relationship with God worth the effort? No one can answer that question but you. You can fall in love again, but the medicine is hard to take. While you may not fight and argue all the time, this kind of rut in your relationship is still just as dangerous.

Seeing your spouse react the first time they try a new sport or try new food is a great way to find out something new about your spouse and recreate some spark. Talk to your spouse, when you feel out of love with your spouse, it’s difficult to tell him. You may not want to hurt his feelings. You may also feel selfish to tell her that you want to be happier — especially if your marriage isn’t too rocky. But telling your spouse will let him know what you’re going through and will give him an opportunity to meet your emotional needs. When you see her trying to meet your emotional needs, it creates love. Have an identity outside of your marriage, it’s important to do things together as a couple, but it’s also important to be an individual. If you don’t have your own likes and interests and hobbies, it makes it difficult to give your spouse someone unique and exciting with whom to connect. Give yourself permission to have your own interests outside of your marriage and outside of your family. It not only helps you, but it helps your marriage, as well. Once love dies in the relatio"
