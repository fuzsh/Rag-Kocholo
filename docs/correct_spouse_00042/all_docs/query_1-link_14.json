Both mother and baby are doing well.”\n\nThe baby is yet to be named.\n\nSteve and Rachel - who have three children each with other partners - met while taking their respective offspring to school.\n\nRachel eventually left her surgeon husband to be with the actor.\n\nSteve recently revealed his excitement at becoming a father again, saying he felt he was being given a “second chance” at life.\n\nHe said: “Children are a bond, a physical entity and living proof of your love and commitment to each other. This is a very exciting time for me, I feel like I'm having a fresh start."
