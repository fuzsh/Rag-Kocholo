        "text": "Actor Steve McFadden has reportedly welcomed a baby girl with his girlfriend Karen Cairns.\n\nThe star, best known for playing Phil Mitchell in EastEnders, and Karen have named the bundle of joy Frankie.\n\nA source told The Sun, “Steve and Karen are both over the moon with little Frankie. Her pregnancy did come as a surprise, but now they are both really happy.”\n\nSteve, 57, has four other children with three previous partners. His eldest child Matt, who he had with Sue Marshall, is 28 years old, while he has an 18-year-old daughter Teona and 12-year-old Mollie Jane with Angela Bostock. He also has a seven-year-old daughter called Amelie Tinkerbell with Rachel Sidwell.\n\nThe star was honoured in May when he won the Outstanding Achievement award at the British Soap Awards for his performance as bad boy Phil.\n\nAfter his character discovered Peggy Mitchell - who is played by Barbara Windsor - had committed suicide, fans were quick to compliment his emotional performance.\n\nOne fan tweeted, “It isn't often we see Phil Mitchell scream out in pain but he did tonight and it was truly heartbreaking. Steve McFadden is phenomenal.”\n\nAnother added, “Steve McFadden deserves an award with the acting he's executed in the past few months, amazing,” while one big fan gushed, “Steve McFadden deserves a best actor award for EastEnders, that was such a tear-jerking aftermath! Tears all round my home.”"
