        "text": "SpecialtiesOut-of-Control Sexual Behavior (OCSB)\n\nStephen works with individuals and couple where one partner has out of control sexual behavior. He currently runs two online groups for men struggling with this. See the link for Menâs Sexual Health Groups for more information.\n\nOut-of-Control Sexual Behavior (OCSB), also sometimes known as Sex Addiction or Sexually-Compulsive Behavior (SCB) is a pattern of using sexual behavior or fantasy in a way that is problematic to your life and your relationships. It can begin to \"take over\" your time, thinking and activities and becomes harder to stop or pull back. It can cause internal conflict and distress, and can lead to breaking relationship agreements with spouses or partners. With the increase in internet pornography and sexual websites and apps, there has been a corresponding increase in out-of-control sexual behavior.\n\nSince there is a wide variety of sexual practices and norms, itâs helpful to assess whether oneâs sexual behavior is out-of-control with a professional. The process of assessment sorts out whether the behavior is indeed out-of-control or is representative of sexual needs and interests that are not well-integrated into a personâs âs self-identity and/or relationships. There are also a variety of methods to help people better understand and make changes to sexual patterns, resulting in a connection with your sexuality that is more congruent with oneâs sense of self and relationships.\n\nSince the beginning of his practice in the 1980s, Stephen has treated men with sexually-compulsive behavior (SCB) and sex addiction. In the past six years, he has been working with the OCSB model, which is based on sexual health principles and is also sex-positive. He has trained with the developers of this model, which is increasingly recognized by the sex addiction and sex therapy communities, and currently provides individual, couple and group treatment in this area."
