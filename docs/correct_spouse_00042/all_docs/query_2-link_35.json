        "text": "EASTENDERS hardman Steve McFadden showed he's a huge softie away from the TV cameras when he played proud papa to his newborn daughter Frankie.\n\nThese images, exclusive to The Sun Online, reveal his tender side as he pushed his youngest in a pram during a family day out.\n\nSteve, who plays badboy Phil Mitchell in the BBC soap, is dad to five children with four different women and was joined by girlfriend Karen Cairns for some quality time with their day-old daughter.\n\nThe skinhead was eager to take charge of parenting duties as he strode down the streets of London with the chic black buggy.\n\nIts exposed top gave passers-by a sneak peek at his adorable new arrival who seemed to be squinting up at her dad.\n\nA white blanket could be seen tossed around the handles which suggested Frankie had become a little too warm during her time in the sunshine with Steve.\n\nMeanwhile the EastEnders favourite was well kitted out in practical parenting clobber.\n\nSteve, 57, wore a black sun hat with a brim and a t-shirt and blue shorts as he stepped out in the London sunshine.\n\nHe slung a black satchel, presumably carrying baby essentials like extra nappies and bottles, across his shoulder as the pair took a stroll.\n\nLater in the day his other-half Karen joined the cute daddy-and-daughter day sporting a trendy black and white striped top, white jeans and matching wedge shoes.\n\nShe stood close to Steve as he whipped the carry-cot part of the pram away from the wheels and held it close.\n\nAfter peeking out from the sides, Frankie headed inside a black vehicle looking all snug as well-practised dad-of-five Steve popped her car seat inside.\n\nHe then had a natter with Karen as their tot was safely buckled in.\n\nWe revealed the pair had a new addition to their brood yesterday and a source said: “Steve and Karen are both over the moon with little Frankie. Her pregnancy did come as a surprise, but now they are both happy.”\n\nFans were quick to take to Twitter and post messages of congratulations.\n\nMeanwhile Steve's love life is nearly has complicated as that of his most-famous character, boozy Phil, who has been married four times.\n\nHis eldest child is son Matt, 28, who he had with Sue Marshall.\n\nSteve also has Teona, 18, and Mollie Jane, 12, with Angela Bostock, and Amelie Tinkerbell, seven, with Rachel Sidwell.\n\nThe actor is believed to have split from Rachel just two months after their daughter was born in 2009.\n\nSteve's baby news tops a stellar few days for the actor after he won an Outstanding Achievement gong at the British Soap Awards last week.\n\nHe has also been praised for his hard-hitting performances in the show as his character Phil said goodbye to mum Peggy (Barbara Windsor).\n\nThe boozy bad boy was left distraught after discovering Peggy's body in the aftermath of her suicide.\n\nPeggy took her own life after doctors confirmed her cancer had spread to her brain, and had become terminal.\n\nThe storyline reunited some of Walford most famous faces, with Ross Kemp reprising his role as Phil's brother Grant Mitchell after a decade-long absence from the Square.\n\nAnother former star of the soap, Danniella Westbrook, also returned to film scenes as Mitchell sister Sam.\n\nThe long-awaited reunion of one of the soap world's most famous families became one of the most highly-anticipated TV events of the year."
