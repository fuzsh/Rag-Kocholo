        "text": "EastEnders star Steve McFadden has played the iconic role of Phil Mitchell since 1990 and just last month viewers watched as he tied the knot with Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace).\n\nBut it seems the honeymoon period has already ended as Phil's been feeling a bit uneasy about Kat's close bond with her ex-hubby Alfie Moon (Shane Ritchie). And he was far from pleased when he recently found them sharing a heartfelt hug.\n\nBefore their wedding, Phil and Alfie, who are as different as chalk and cheese, agreed to keep each other's secrets. Phil promised not to tell Kat about Alfie's illness if Alfie kept quiet about Phil's fling with Emma Harding (Patsy Kensit).\n\nNow that Alfie has told Kat about his health worries, fans of EastEnders are wondering when other secrets will be revealed. As Phil starts to worry about his future with Kat, let's take a peek at actor Steve's real life, which has had its fair share of drama away from Albert Square...\n\n'Surprise' baby\n\nSteve, 64, is a proud dad to five kids from four different mums. His eldest son Matthew was born in 1986 during Steve's marriage to his childhood sweetheart, Sue Marshall.\n\nAfter rekindling an old flame with Angela Bostock, Steve welcomed his two eldest daughters, Teona and Mollie Jane, born in 1997 and 2004 respectively. His fourth child, Amelie Tinkerbell, was born in 2009 during Steve's relationship with Dr Rachel Sidwell.\n\nAlthough Steve usually keeps his private life private, he spoke openly about the joys of being a dad when Amelie was born. In an interview with OK!, Steve said: \"I'm happier now than I've ever been. I can't wait to start having more now. The day she was born was one of the greatest of my life.\"\n\nHis youngest daughter Frankie arrived in 2016, and she was a lovely \"surprise\" for Steve and his current partner Karen Cairns. A source told The Sun at the time: \"Steve and Karen are both over the moon with little Frankie. Her pregnancy did come as a surprise, but now they are both really happy.\"\n\nCo-star split\n\nSteve and his co-star Lucy Benjamin were part of one of EastEnders' most jaw-dropping storyline ever, with the 'Who shot Phil?' mystery keeping fans on the edge of their seats. It was finally revealed that Lucy's character Lisa Fowler had used a stolen gun on Phil as payback for how he treated her during their turbulent relationship.\n\nOff-screen, Steve and Lucy were also an item, dating from 1999 to 2003. Lucy left the soap around the same time they broke up, but she has made several comebacks over the years, including in 2010, 2017, 2019 to 2020, and 2023.\n\nLuckily, it seems there are no hard feelings between the exes, with Lucy previously chatting about their friendly working relationship during an appearance on Loose Women in 2017. Lucy shared: \"It was strange really, but lovely to be working with Steve, Tish, and Natalie Cassidy again. It was just like being with mates. They have been doing fabulous work and I knew that they would look after me and have my back upon my return.\""
