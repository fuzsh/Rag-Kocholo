        "text": "McFadden said: “She’s been an absolute pleasure to work with, and a wonderful person and friend in my life. Thank you Barbara for everything.”\n\nThe BBC One soap’s storyline took an emotional twist last month when Peggy took her own life after doctors confirmed cancer had spread to her brain and was terminal.\n\nBut McFadden, who has played Phil since 1990, was praised for his emotional performances after her suicide. Fans on Twitter said it deserved an award.\n\nTV’s Phil said Peggy asked him to help her commit suicide.\n\nHe added: “She wanted me to be there with her, I went along with it at first, she seemed so desperate.\n\n\"But then I changed my mind, I thought she’d changed hers. And maybe that’s what I wanted to believe.\n\n“I thought we’d talked her out of it. It was such a relief. We were going to make the most of the time we had left.\n\n“She was lying. The last thing she did was lie to me, and she had to lie because I let her down.”"
