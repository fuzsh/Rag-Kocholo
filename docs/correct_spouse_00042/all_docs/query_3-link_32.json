        "text": "1955 Â· The Civil Rights Movement Begins\n\nThe civil rights movement was a movement to enforce constitutional and legal rights for African Americans that the other Americans enjoyed. By using nonviolent campaigns, those involved secured new recognition in laws and federal protection of all Americans. Moderators worked with Congress to pass of several pieces of legislation that overturned discriminatory practices.\n\n1957 Â· Troops are sent to Central High School\n\nIn September 1957, troops were sent to Central High school in Little Rock, Arkansas. The reason was that nine African American children were going to start going to this school and putting the new law of Brown v Board of Education into action. These nine children became known as the Little Rock nine."
