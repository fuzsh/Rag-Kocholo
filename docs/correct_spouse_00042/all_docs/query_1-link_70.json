        "text": "EastEnders favourite Phil Mitchell has been wooing the women of Walford for decades.\n\nSince arriving on Albert Square in 1990, the Albert Square hardman has had multiple relationships with residents including Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean) and Lisa Fowler (Lucy Benjamin).\n\nActor Steve McFadden has also led a colourful love life off-screen too, including becoming a father with his childhood sweetheart, multiple relationships and dating one of his EastEnders' co-stars.\n\nREAD MORE: EastEnders Alfie Moon star's life - wild orgy, wearing dresses and sex in car with wife\n\nREAD MORE: Click for more brilliant Daily Star TV stories\n\nAs Phil tries to win back Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) after cheating on her with Emma Harding (Patsy Kensit), Daily Star has taken a look back at Steve's wild romances.\n\n'Dogging' past\n\nSteve McFadden may have had his fair share of wild storylines in EastEnders, but his private life has also been a wild ride too.\n\nIn 2005, his ex-girlfriend Angela Bostock alleged that over a 10-year period he had sex in public and was watched by strangers. She alleged at the time: \"Steve loved dirty old men watching us have sex in car parks. It disgusted me, but he told me it was normal.\"\n\nHe was off-air at the time, but a source told The Mirror that the BBC would be standing by him and the allegations wouldn't affect his position.\n\nChildhood sweetheart\n\nLong before dating one of his co-stars, Steve was in a relationship with his childhood sweetheart Sue Marshall. Together the couple had one child called Matt, but sadly their teenage romance did not last and they parted ways.\n\nAfter dating Sue Marshall, the actor began a relationship with Angela Bostock, who he had met at a party in Salisbury in 1995. During this time however, the couple split when Steve McFadden began a relationship with EastEnder's co-star Lucy Benjamin in 1999.\n\nHowever, Steve and Angela got back together after Steve's relationship with Lucy came to an end, and the couple later welcomed two daughters called Teona and Mollie Jane.\n\nSteve and Angela parted ways in 2005, with the actor going on to date Dr Rachel Sidwell. It is reported that their romance blossomed after they bumped into one another on a school run in 2008, with the couple dating for over a year.\n\nThey also had a daughter called Amelie Tinkerbell in September 2009, with the actor telling Ok! Magazine following her birth: \"I'm happier now than I've ever been. I can't wait to start having more now. \"The day she was born was one of the greatest of my life.\"\n\nHowever, the couple split up less than two months after the birth of their daughter, with a source telling The Mirror: \"Steve is more than heartbroken by the split.\"\n\nCo-star ex\n\nSteve met ex-girlfriend Lucy Benjamin on the set of EastEnders, after Lucy arrived on the soap to play Lisa Fowler. During that time, not only did Lisa have a relationship with Phil, but she was also the culprit in the famous Who Shot Phil Mitchell storyline.\n\nAlthough the characters had a fiery relationship on screen, Steve and Lucy's love blossomed off screen. The couple dated for over four years from 1999, before splitting up in 2003. However, both Steve and Lucy have remained close friends, with Lucy telling ITV daytime programme Loose Women that she enjoyed working with him again during Lisa's return to Albert Square in 2017.\n\nHave you joined Threads? Follow Daily Star to keep up to date on all things showbiz here\n\nTalking about filming the scenes and working with Steve, she said: \"It was more about the history between Lisa and Phil and there is so much water under the bridge with those two people.\" \"You just resort back to their storylines and the things they have gone through as characters. We didn't have to think about me and Steve and the old days.\n\n\"It's lovely to be working with Steve, Tish and Natalie Cassidy. She added: \"It was strange really but within 10 minutes it was like I'd never been away. \"It was like having old mates back and I knew they would look after me on my return.\"\n\nGirlfriend\n\nSteve has since found love with girlfriend Karen Cairns, who he has been in a long-term relationship with for nearly a decade. The couple were also delighted when they welcomed their daughter Frankie in June 2016, who is Steve's fifth child.\n\nSteve and Karen could be seen looking cosy together in photos as they took their daughter out for a stroll following her birth, with a source telling The Sun at the time: \"'Steve and Karen are both over the moon with little Frankie. \"Her pregnancy did come as a surprise, but now they are both really happy.\"\n\nEastEnders airs Monday to Thursday on BBC One at 7.30pm"
