        "text": "Phil Mitchell will go down in history as one of the most iconic EastEnders characters of all time.\n\nKnown widely as Albert Square's hardman, the legendary head of the Mitchell clan has dealt with countless dramatic storylines and been part of iconic plots including 'Sharongate' and 'Who shot Phil?' reports the Mirror.\n\nAs well as experiencing Phil's dramas, actor Steve McFadden has gone through his fair share of his own ups and downs worthy of a soap opera within his personal life.\n\nEarly life and rise to fame\n\nSteve grew up in London but lived in Westminster working in a variety of jobs before leaving school including an unusual job of carrot pickings.\n\nPrior to pursuing his acting dreams, the star also dabbled in plumbing and working as a builder's merchant.\n\nThe 64-year-old studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, finally making his acting debut in 1989 when he landed a small part in football hooligan film, The Firm.\n\nIt was in 1990 that he joined the cast of EastEnders alongside his onscreen siblings, Grant (Ross Kemp), and Sam (Daniella Westbrook).\n\nRomances\n\nThroughout the years, Phil had a few love affairs - with four marriages under his belt.\n\nHis offscreen counterpart Steve has also had an eventful love life, including a co-star romance.\n\nHis first relationship was with childhood sweetheart Sue Marshall, with whom he shares son Matt.\n\nHowever, following their decision to end things, his next relationship was reportedly with Angela Bostock, whom he met at a party back in 1995.\n\nIt was following his break-up with Angela he met fellow cast member Lucy Benjamin, who played his volatile onscreen girlfriend Lisa Fowler.\n\nThe pair dated from 1999 to 2003, and continued to work together after their split.\n\nDuring a 2017 episode of Loose Women, following her character's return to the Square, Lucy remarked: \"It was strange really, but lovely to be working with Steve, Tish, and Natalie Cassidy again. It was just like being with mates. They have been doing fabulous work and I knew that they would look after me and have my back upon my return.\"\n\nSteve then resumed his romance with old flame Angela following his relationship with Lucy, subsequently welcoming daughters Teona and Mollie Jane, before breaking up for a second time in 2005.\n\nThe actor then embarked on a relationship with Dr Rachel Sidwell., with whom he welcomed another daughter, Amelie Tinkerbell, in 2009.\n\nFor more than ten years, Steve has reportedly been in a relationship with current girlfriend Karen Cairns, with whom he shares a daughter Frankie, born in 2016.\n\nFamily life\n\nThe on-screen Walford hardman is a proud dad to Matthew, Teona, Mollie, Amelie, and Frankie, and, although the actor prefers to keep his private life out of the limelight, has previously opened up about the joys of fatherhood following Amelie's birth in September 2009.\n\nThe delighted father told OK! magazine: \"I'm happier now than I've ever been. I can't wait to start having more now. The day she was born was one of the greatest of my life.\"\n\nAfter his youngest daughter Frankie's birth in June 2016, a source told The Sun: \"Steve and Karen are both over the moon with little Frankie. Her pregnancy did come as a surprise, but now they are both really happy.\"\n\nAlleged feud with Danny Dyer\n\nAfter his exit from EastEnders in 2022, Danny Dyer, who played landlord Mick Carter, dropped various hints that he wasn't friendly with everyone on set.\n\nDuring an appearance on ITV's Jonathan Ross Show, he revealed: \"There's a few. I ain't going to lie. I won't say who. Most I love dearly. Not all…\"\n\nA TV source later told The Sun that Steve disliked Danny from the moment he joined the cast in 2013, claiming: \"It was an open secret on set. They rarely worked together.\"\n\nA separate source told the publication: \"Steve hated that bosses gave Mick the Queen Vic, which spent so many years being at the heart of the Mitchell family. It meant Danny would have maximum screen time. Danny coming in was a big fanfare, and everyone loved him, but Steve didn't like him. Danny tried to win him over but Steve wasn't having it. In the end, Danny got sick of him.\"\n\nThings apparently became so heated that Steve snubbed the leaving do of his otherwise well-liked castmate."
