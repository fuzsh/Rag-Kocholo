Well 'ard!\n\nGRANT is married to the editor of the Sun?? DOUBLE RANDOM!!\n\nAlso, this *is* funny. Poor, suffering Mitchell Brothers!\n\nBwhahaha i so never knew he was married to the editor of The Sun, that is enough to make her scary to me. I wonder if this story appeared in The Sun? LOL\n\nApparently it got a very small mention at the bottom of a page :)\n\nHAHAHAHAHAHAH\n\nthey've terrified me since childhood.\n\nThis is TOO loltastic.\n\nI seriously cannot stop lolling about this! I just sat watching EastEnders pointing and laughing at them this evening.\n\nThe fact that it was headline news in ITV this evening and had Richard and Judy up in arms makes it even funnier..!\n\nHa i can just imagine how Richard & Judy were, they will probably start some sort of campaign relating to it soon. Gosh i miss the UK...\n\nthe best bit about this story is how rebekah wade was behind the sun's big anti-domestic violence campaign a few years ago...\n\nIt wouldn't be funny if it were the other way around now would it?\n\nYes. I bloody hate Rebekah Wade.\n\nOMG! Anyone who has ever seen Eastenders must be laughing. I even saw it on the BBC!\n\nRoss Kemp should have used his SAS- Super Army Soldiers Training to beat up that girl\n\nGRAAAAAAAAAAAANT!\n\nThis used to be my show back in the day.\n\nMan I loved that show! There was a guy who looked spot on to \"Grant\" at my local, in California no less. Crazy!\n\nI don't understand why people are laughing at this. Domestic violence is not funny just because it's a man being attacked. If this situation had been the other way round, there'd be outrage.\n\nYou're quite correct that domestic violence is not funny. However, the attacks are \"alleged\". And the fact that they are notorious for being \"hard\", and the fact that they were BOTH allegedly \"attacked\" - and the fact that The Sun is the kind of newspaper that would LOVE this kind of gossip.\n\nI apologise, perhaps loltastic was the wrong term, but it is, IMO, very strange \"gossip\"."
