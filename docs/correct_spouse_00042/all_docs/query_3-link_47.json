        "text": "EastEnders has released as first look at Eddie Knight in prison as the pensioner was found guilty of the historic murder of George's real dad Henry Kofi Asare. In next week's episodes of the BBC One, George Knight (Colin Salmon) faces even more turmoil at the hands of his adoptive father Eddie.\n\nIn the wake of Gloria Knight's (Elizabeth Counsell) sudden death, George is consumed with grief having shared some moving final moments with his adoptive mum in the hospital. Gloria suffered a heart attack while at court for Eddie's murder trial, and despite being rushed to hospital she couldn't recover and later died while holding George's face.\n\nFollowing her death, George fails to get hold of his estranged son Junior to relay the news before Eddie calls George from prison. Eddie asks his adoptive son George to meet to discuss his wife Gloria, but a vicious showdown ensues as the pair exchange harsh words.\n\nREAD MORE: EastEnders fist look at Eddie Knight in prison as George makes shocking demand\n\nEddie bans George from attending Gloria's funeral, and a despairing George deals with this news by heading back to the underground boxing club. He's stopped by pal Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden), who begs George not to fight.\n\nGeorge doesn't listen and ends up being knocked out. After sleeping it off at Phil's place, he wakes up battered and bruised.\n\nWhen he returns home, Elaine Peacock (Harriet Thorpe) is horrified to see the state of George along with his shocked daughters Anna (Molly Rainford) and Gina (Francesca Henry), but George lies and tells him he was jumped.\n\nLater, George tries to make some headway against Eddie, but a knockback sends him spiralling again.\n\nElaine decides not intervene when George storms off, but his ex-wife Cindy Beale (Michelle Collins) is deeply worried and confronts Phil to find out where heâ€™s going.\n\nPhil and Cindy arrive at the boxing club to find the bouncers refusing George entry. Cindy takes him to the Boxing Den to talk.\n\nGeorge only recently found how his adoptive dad Eddie had killed his real dad Henry. He also discovered that his real mum had died four months ago. With his adoptive mum Gloria now also dead, how will George cope with all of the heartache?\n\nEastEnders continues on Monday, April 15, at 7:30pm on BBC One."
