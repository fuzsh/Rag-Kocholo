        "text": "There’s a mystery surrounding the Knight family, who’ve recently moved in to EastEnders’ iconic Queen Vic pub. It centres around Anna (Molly Rainford) and Gina (Francesca Henry)’s mum Rose – George (Colin Salmon)’s ex wife.\n\nIn recent episodes Gina confronted her dad after she heard that he’d proposed to Elaine (Harriet Thorpe) – and she’d accepted.\n\nGeorge wanted to know why Gina had become upset and fled from the bar at the news and she told him that it was because he never mentions their mum.\n\nRose abandoned the family nine years ago and they’ve heard nothing from her since. Despite this, Gina revealed that she and sister Anna talk about Rose all the time – but George never mentions her.\n\nWhile George made it clear that Elaine wasn’t intending to replace their mum he also insisted that ‘life can’t stand still forever’ and he was determined to move on.\n\nOne person who isn’t going to move on easily from this is Linda Carter (Kellie Bright), who’s been suspicious of George from the outset.\n\nShe decides to talk to Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) about the mysterious Rose, and he agrees to do some digging, with Callum Highway’s (Tony Clay) help.\n\nEven with the resources of the police at his disposal, Callum comes up with nothing useful as George’s record seems fairly clean.\n\nIt’s when he tries searching for Rose on the police computer system that the mystery really deepens, as all access is denied.\n\nThis news convinces Linda that her instinct about George is right. Phil continues to try to find out what could have happened to Rose by asking George directly. George fobs him off and insists he isn’t hiding anything and Linda has got him wrong.\n\nColin Salmon told us, ‘Some people think he killed Rose, so it’s been nine years of mystery and heartache on top of suspicion and misunderstanding.\n\n‘It’s hard if you are a member of a family and your spouse has gone missing, everyone thinks they know what’s going on.’\n\nDespite this Phil refuses to give up and gets Ritchie Scott (Sian Webber) to help. Armed with whatever information she can provide, he’s soon accusing George of not being straight with him.\n\nWhat has Ritchie discovered? Could Rose actually be dead? Or is there another explanation?\n\nExpect huge revelations in a special episode set to air soon, when we’ll finally discover what happened to Rose.\n\nMORE : Who does Colin Salmon play in EastEnders and what else has he been in?\n\nMORE : EastEnders and Emmerdale star Patsy Kensit tells ‘a***hole’ critics to ‘do one’ over claims about her son\n\nMORE : EastEnders spoilers: Callum takes a big risk for Phil that could cost him dearly\n\nFollow Metro across our social channels, on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram\n\nShare your views in the comments below"
