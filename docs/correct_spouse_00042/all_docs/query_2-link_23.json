        "text": "Steve McFadden has reportedly become a dad again - his fifth child with a fourth woman, but he's not the only star to have fathered a few kids.\n\nThe EastEnders ' star is said to be celebrating after welcoming a daughter called Frankie with his girlfriend Karen Cairns, according to the Sun newspaper.\n\nSteve already has son Matt McFadden, 28, with Sue Marshall, and two daughters Teona, 18, and Mollie Jane, 12, with his ex Angela Bostock.\n\nIn June 2009 Rachel Sidwell gave birth to his daughter Amelie Tinkerbell, 7, and the couple reportedly split two months later.\n\nHere are more famous men who have fathered several kids with a few women:\n\n1. Rod Stewart 8X5\n\nThe singer wins the prize for fathering the most children with the highest number of different women. He has a whopping 8 with 5 different women.\n\nIn 1963 a 20-year-old Rod had his first child with art student Susannah Boffey. The young couple gave their daughter – Sarah Steerer- up for adoption.\n\nIt wasn’t until 1979 that Rob had his second child Kimberley Alana Stewart with his then wife Alana Hamilton.\n\nHe had two more children with the former model - Sean Roderick Stewart and Kelly Emberg Ruby Stewart.\n\nRod later married blonde model Rachel Hunter – who he fathered Renée Cecili Stewart with in 1992 and then Liam McAlister Stewart in 1994.\n\nThe star is currently married to Penny Lancaster, another leggy blonde. The couple have children Alastair Wallace Stewart and Aiden Patrick Stewart in 2011 when he was 66-years-old.\n\n2. Eddie Murphy 8x4\n\nActor Eddie has five children with his first five Nicole Mitchell. Bria L. Murphy (born November 18, 1989), Myles Mitchell (born November 7, 1992), Shayne Audra (born October 10, 1994), Zola Ivy (born December 24, 1999) and Bella Zahra (born January 29, 2002).\n\nDuring those years, while still married to Nicole, he had two children with two separate women.\n\nA son Christian with Tamara Hood and another son Eric with Paulette McNeely.\n\nWhen he finally divorced Nicole he had a brief relationship with Spice Girl Mel B.\n\nMel gave birth to a daughter – Angel Iris – in 2007 and a DNA test proved Eddie was indeed the father.\n\n3. Mick Jagger 7x4\n\nIt probably comes as little surprise that Rolling Stones rocker Mick has a fair few children.\n\nHis first - Karis Hunt Jagger – was born in 1970 to Marsha Hunt.\n\nNot long after he married Bianca De Macias and in 1971 the couple had a daughter – jellewry designer Jade Sheena Jezebel Jagger.\n\nWith his second wife Jerry Hall, he has model daughter Elizabeth 'Lizzie' Scarlett Jagger (born 2 March 1984), son James Leroy Augustin Jagger (born 28 August 1985), daughter Georgia May Ayeesha Jagger (born 12 January 1992), who is also a model, and son Gabriel Luke Beauregard Jagger (born 9 December 1997).\n\nTwo years after his last child with Jerry he fathered Lucas Maurice Morad Jagger, who is spitting image, with Brazilian beauty Luciana Gimenez.\n\n4.Paul Weller 7 x4\n\nThe Jam’s Paul Weller is perhaps a slightly surprising joint third.\n\nPaul married Dee C. Lee in 1987 and divorced just a year later but not before they had two children together Leah and Nathaniel\n\nAfter a brief relationship with a make-up artist known only as Lucy, he had his third child – a daughter called Dylan.\n\nHe went on to become involved with Samantha Stock – who he had a further two children with.\n\nFollowing that relationship he moved in with a backing singer on his 22 Dreams album – Hannah Andrews.\n\nThey married in September 2010 on the Italian island of Capri and have twin boys, John Paul and Bowie, who were born on 14 January 2012.\n\n5. Sean Combs 5x3\n\nRapper Sean, aka P Diddy or Puff Daddy, had his first child – Justin (born 1993) - with his high-school sweetheart designer Misa Hylton-Brim.\n\nHe had a further three children with Kim Porter – Christian (born 1998), and twin daughters D'Lila Star and Jessie James (born December 21, 2006).\n\nIn 2007 he took legal responsibility for another daughter Chance – who was born just five months after his twins. Her mother is Sarah Chapman.\n\n6. Liam Gallagher 3X3\n\nOasis’ Liam Gallagher’s first child, born in 1998, – Molly – was the result of an affair with Lisa Moorish, not long after he married Patsy Kensit.\n\nLiam and Patsy only have one child together, son Lennon Francis Gallagher, was born in September 1999. The couple divorced a year later.\n\nHis second son – Gene Gallagher – was born to Nicole Appleton on 2 July 2001.\n\n(7. Bob Marley 9x7)\n\nWe couldn’t compile a list without Bob Marley who according to official records has 9x7, however he was believed to have many more…"
