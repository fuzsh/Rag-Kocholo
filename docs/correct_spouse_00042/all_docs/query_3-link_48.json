        "text": "It is with great heartbreak and sorrow we announce the peaceful passing of Timothy Duncan McFadden, surrounded by family full of love, after a courageous and humbling battle. High school sweethearts Tim and Cathy (Coke) McFadden married June 3, 1977 and together created their most cherished legacy Nick, Marianne and Michelle who along with their spouses Ann, Rob, and Jamie blessed them with 8 beautiful grandchildren: Lila, Henry and Lars McFadden, Avery and Willow Horvath, and Decker, Berkeley and Blake Beatty. Predeceased by his parents Walter and Christine (Parry) McFadden and in-laws, Donald and Joan (Evans) Coke. Adored brother of Wally and Gisele McFadden, Ann and Steve Shaw, Christopher and Jennifer McFadden, and Kelly McFadden. Incredible brother-in-law to Neil and Marlene Coke, Connie and Brad Babula, Chrissy and Rob McFadden. Treasured by Aunt Dot, cousins, nieces, nephews, great-nieces, and great-nephews. He will be sadly missed by his large group of friends from Squires hockey, Owls baseball, and the Legion Branch 113. Tim was the Legion Branch 113 past president, a retired volunteer firefighter of 24 years, and a member of the Dresden Sports Hall of Fame Committee. He was the proud former owner of McFadden’s Heating and Cooling, a business he built from the ground up. He loved farming the McFadden Flats family farm on the river bend outside Dresden. The legacy he leaves behind is one to be commended. He was a hard worker and a most cherished friend to many. He didn’t wait for anything, and did everything on his own time. Tim and his wife Cathy travelled frequently and completed a pretty tremendous bucket list. Tim’s buddies called him “Brute”, and they had a love of good food, riding Harley’s, hockey, golf, baseball, football and spending time laughing together. The family would like to thank Melanie from Bayshore, Joyce and the CCTC team at LHSC (Victoria Campus). Friends and family will be received at Badder Funeral Home & Reception Centre, 679 North St., Dresden on Friday October 13, 2023 from 2:00 PM - 5:00 PM. A Celebration of Tim's Life will be held at Dresden Legion Branch 113, 80 St George St N, Dresden on Saturday October, 14. 2023 from 4:00 PM -8:00 PM. A Private Graveside service will be held with family at Blackburn Cemetery, Dresden. Those planning to express their remembrance are asked to consider donating to Dresden Legion Branch 113, Dresden Minor Hockey, Dresden Minor Baseball, or a charity of one’s choice."
