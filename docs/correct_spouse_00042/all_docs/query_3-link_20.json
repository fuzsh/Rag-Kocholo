        "text": "EastEnders actor Steve McFadden has reportedly threatened Jim Davidson over a dirty joke he made about his girlfriend.\n\nThe 50-year-old comic called police over the alleged threat, which came in a phone call.\n\nDavidson cracked his off-colour gag during a gig in Southampton that he had organised for the widow of murdered policeman Ian Broadhurst, killed in Leeds last month.\n\nThe comedian is currently appearing with McFadden's partner Lucy Benjamin in the panto Aladdin, and she was in Monday night's audience when he cracked the joke.\n\nThe pair later went to dinner, which is when 33-year-old Benjamin, who plays Lisa Fowler in EastEnders, called her boyfriend about the gag.\n\nDavidson then came on the line to explain, which is when 44-year-old McFadden allegedly made the threats, Ananova reports.\n\nThe comic called police, who took statements, but he decided not to take the matter any further.\n\nA Hampshire Police spokeswoman said: \"We can confirm that a complaint was received regarding a threat made against a 50-year-old man.\n\n\"A statement was taken from him but he didn't wish to proceed any further with the complaint and no further action is being taken.\"\n\nPublished: 29 Jan 2004"
