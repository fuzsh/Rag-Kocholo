        "text": "EASTENDERS just wouldn't be the same without Phil Mitchell.\n\nThe Walford tough man has been played by Steve McFadden for over three decades - but fans have been left wondering if he is leaving Albert Square.\n\nIs Phil Mitchell leaving EastEnders?\n\nEastEnders viewers need not worry, as Phil Mitchell isn't leaving Albert Square anytime soon.\n\nHe is however, taking on a new job over Christmas 2023, which sees him in panto.\n\nThe actor is taking to the stage for Jack and the Beanstalk at Dunstable's Grove Theatre.\n\nFans have been left wondering if he will be leaving the soap for good, as the soap has teased a murder at Christmas.\n\nHow long has Steve McFadden been in EastEnders?\n\nPhil is one of the longest standing villains, appearing in EastEnders for the first time in early 1990.\n\nThe character has only left the soap once in the early noughties.\n\nOn Christmas Day 2003, Phil was given a choice by \"Dirty Den\" Watts after attacking him.\n\nDen offered to give him £200,000 as long as he agreed not to come after him.\n\nBoth characters had been feuding, notably over Kate Morton.\n\nLeft with little choice due to being on the run after escaping from prison (which could be a hint to a potential return if the villain truly accepts his sentence), Phil accepted Den's offer and left Walford with the money he was offered.\n\nSteve McFadden then reprised his role for a brief stint in April 2005, after his character ran out of funds, before making a more permanent return in October 2005 - and he's been on the soap ever since.\n\nThe actor has appeared in more than 3000 episodes of EastEnders.\n\nDuring that time, his character has been involved in numerous iconic storylines, such as Sharongate - where it was revealed that he had an affair with his brother Grant's wife Sharon in 1994.\n\nThen there was the famous Who Shot Phil? storyline in March 2001, when his character was shot and wounded by a mystery attacker, which turned out to be his ex-girlfriend Lisa.\n\nSpeaking about his gritty storylines, he once told Digital Spy: \"No-one gets called into the office to discuss their storylines and I'm not in the meetings where they decide. It's best that it just gets chucked at me.\"\n\nBefore joining the soap, Steve had numerous other TV roles in the late 80s.\n\nHe appeared in the film Buster as a gang member, and played a small role in the 1989 BBC movie The Firm.\n\nThis was followed by appearances in The Bill, Minder, and Bergerac.\n\nAway from TV and Steve also has five children.\n\nWith girlfriend Karen Cairns,he had his daughter in June 2016 who they named Frankie.\n\nHis older son is called Matthew and was born to his previous girlfriend, Sue Marshall.\n\nHe also had another daughter, Amelie Tinkerbell in June 2009 with Rachel Sidwell.\n\nSteve' has two more daughters, Teona and Mollie Jane, with ex-partner Angela Bostock.\n\nHow old is Phil Mitchell supposed to be?\n\nPhillip James Mitchell was born on the January 20 1961, the eldest child of Eric Mitchell and Peggy Mitchell.\n\nThis would make him 62 as of December 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, Steve McFadden was born on March 20 1959.\n\nHow many times has Phil Mitchell been married?\n\nPhil hasn't been very lucky when it comes to his marriage.\n\nHowever, he has given it a fair go, being married four times.\n\nHis first wife was Nadia Borovac and they were married from 1993 to 1994.\n\nPhil then wed Kathy Beale from 1995–2001 before Kate Morton 2003–2005."
