Steve McFadden's ex-girlfriend Rachel Sidwell has been struggling to cope with her split from the EastEnders actor, according to a report.

Soap star McFadden was reportedly dumped by the married GP last month, just weeks after they had welcomed a baby girl together.

It is thought that Sidwell has now returned to live with her surgeon husband and three other children, though she has not reprised her former relationship.

A source told The Mirror: "Rachel's doing the best she can in the circumstances but gave up her life to be with Steve. She chose to leave her husband and children and give up a contented and fulfilling life.

"It was a case of love at first sight when she met Steve. But it all turned sour very quickly. Rachel is a different person now. She was warm, curvy and bubbly. Now she's shedding pounds every day. She cries all day and feels lost and unloved. It's tragic to see her so sad."

The insider added: "The worst thing about it all is that she still thinks things could work out with Steve. She's invested everything in that relationship."
