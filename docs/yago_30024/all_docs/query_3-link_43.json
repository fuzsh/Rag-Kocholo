The royal city of Bergen was chosen as the coronation venue while Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim was designated as the place where the regalia were to be safeguarded. In 1183 the Norwegian crown and sceptre fell into the hands of Sverre who claimed to be the rightful heir to the throne of Norway and Magnus V to be merely an usurper. Soon Sverre deposed and killed Magnus V, proclaiming himself the new king of Norway in 1184. The Church, however, refused to crown him and the archbishop fled Norway. Nevertheless in 1194 Sverre managed to force the bishops to crown him, without Papal consent, naturally. His coronation, like that of his predecessor, took place in Bergen.\n\nThe next king to be crowned in Norway was Haakon IV in 1247. This time Papal consent was granted. On the occasion of Haakon IV’s coronation a short account of the Norwegian regalia was made. According to it the regalia consisted of a gold crown, two silver sceptres and a coronation sword. In 1235 Haakon IV received from the king of England a gold diadem set with precious gemstones. Bergen witnessed two further coronations, of Magnus VI in 1261 and Eric II in 1280. The last mediaeval king to be crowned in Norway was Haakon V. He was crowned in 1300, but the king broke with tradition and chose Oslo as coronation venue.\n\nFollowing Norway’s personal union with Sweden in 1319, subsequent Norwegian kings were crowned in Sweden (Magnus VII in 1336 and Eric III of Pomerania in 1397), but the Norwegian regalia were still kept in Norway in the treasury of BÃ¥hus Castle. It seems that in 1332 the regalia were transferred to Akershus Castle in Oslo. An inventory written down in the 1340s mentions two sceptres, three gold rings and other items, but not the crown, nor the coronation sword, both mentioned earlier.\n\nFollowing Norway’s personal union with Denmark in 1380 only a few common kings were crowned in Norway, choosing either Oslo (Christopher of Bavaria in 1442 and Christian II in 1514) or Trondheim (Christian I in 1450 and Hans in 1483) as coronation venues. After 1514 the tradition of separate Norwegian coronations disappeared entirely. The common kings were crowned exclusively in Denmark with Danish regalia only. In 1530 the success of the Reformation made the Catholic archbishop of Trondheim flee Norway. The archbishop loaded the contents of the cathedral treasury - including the Norwegian regalia - onto two ships and set off towards continental Europe. The ultimate fate of the mediaeval Norwegian regalia is unknown, as only one of the ships reached its destination, while the other one went down in Trondheim Fiord.\n\nThe tradition of Norwegian coronations was revived after 1814 when Norway was separated from Denmark and united with Sweden. The new Norwegian constitution required a separate coronation for Norway at Trondheim Cathedral. The first common king, Charles II (Charles XIII in Sweden), was too frail and too old to fulfil the requirements of the constitution and was therefore never crowned in Norway. But his successor, Charles III John (Charles XIV John in Sweden), was. His coronation at Trondheim in 1818 was the first Norwegian coronation since 1514. As Norway possessed no regalia at the time, Charles III John provided a splendid set of regalia for his new realm. The crown was first used at the funeral of Charles II in 1818 and later that year for Charles III’s coronation. The regalia were paid for by the king himself and were to be kept in the treasury of Trondheim Cathedral. The new Norwegian regalia consisted of the following items:\n\nRoyal crown: made in Stockholm in 1818 by goldsmith Adolf Zethelius. The crown is a corona clausa and consists of a ring carrying eight hoops made of gold and surmounted by a globe of blue enamel and an amethyst cross on top of it. The crown is decorated with numerous pearls and gemstones including amethysts, chrysoprases, a topaz and an alexandrite. In front it is adorned with a huge green turmaline, a gift of the Brazilian consul in Stockholm to King Charles III John.\n\nRoyal orb: made in Stockholm in 1818 by goldsmith Adolf Zethelius of gilt silver. It is decorated with small roses placed on a band in the middle of the orb.\n\nRoyal sceptre: made in Stockholm in 1818 by goldsmith Adolf Zethelius of gilt silver.\n\nAnointment horn: made in Stockholm in 1818 by goldsmith Adolf Zethelius of gilt silver.\n\nCoronation sword: early 19th century. Tradition has it that the sword was Napoleon’s gift to the future king of Sweden and Norway, Charles John Bernadotte, when he was French marshal.\n\nQueen’s crown: made in Stockholm in 1830 by goldsmith Erik Lundberg. The crown is a corona clausa made of gold. It consists of eight hoops surmounted by a globe of blue enamel decorated with pearls and a pearl cross on top. The crown is adorned with numerous gemstones (amethysts and topazes) and pearls.\n\nQueen’s orb: made in Stockholm in 1830 of gilt silver and decorated with amethysts.\n\nQueen’s sceptre: made in Stockholm in 1830 of gilt silver and decorated with amethysts.\n\nCrown Prince’s coronet: made in Norway in 1846 by goldsmith Herman ColbjÃ¸rnsen Ãyset. The coronet is a corona aperta made of gold and decorated with amethysts, topazes and pearls.\n\nThe next Norwegian king, Oscar I (1844-1859), postponed his Norwegian coronation due to a number of obscure reasons, but it seems that the main cause of royal unwillingness to carry on with his coronation in Norway was the opposition of the bishop of Trondheim to the coronation of the queen. As a result neither Oscar I nor his queen were ever crowned in Norway. Oscar I’s son, Charles IV (Charles XV in Sweden), was crowned in Trondheim with his consort, Queen Louise, in 1860. It was the first coronation of a Norwegian queen since 1299. Only two more kings had the opportunity to wear the Norwegian royal crown at their coronations: Oscar II in 1873 and Haakon VII in 1906. In 1908 the Norwegian Parliament adopted a law which abolished coronations in Norway.\n\nThe Norwegian regalia, according to the wishes of King Charles III John, were kept at Trondheim Cathedral until 1825 when they were removed to the Regalia Chamber in the archbishop’s palace in Trondheim. After 1835 they were transferred to Oslo (Christiania) and kept in the Regalia Tower at Akershus Castle. Later the regalia were deposited in the vaults of the Bank of Norway in Oslo, where they quietly survived the German invasion and occupation of Norway 1940-1945. In 1988 the regalia were returned to Trondheim and have been on public display in Nidaros Cathedral. In 2006 the Norwegian regalia were transferred to the Archbishop's Palace next to Trondheim Cathedral where they are exhibited on a permanent exhibition in the so-called Regalia Room.\n\n01.
