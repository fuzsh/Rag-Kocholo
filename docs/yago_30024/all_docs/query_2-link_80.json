        "text": "Gustav III 1746-1792\n\nSweden's king Gustav III was an enlightened ruler. Here is more about Enlightenment.\n\nHe was the founder of the Swedish Academy.\n\nGustav was married to Sofia Magdalena, the daughter of Denmark's king Frederick V.\n\nThe big subject of the day was the power of the Riksdag, the Swedish parliament. Gustav thought the king should have more power than the parliament, switched laws around, and made it happen.\n\nThat was the bloodless coup of August 1772.\n\nRegarding French help, see also Vergennes.\n\nGustav was a modern man and ready for many reforms. But the Riksdag was sulking and the Swedish nobility grew bitter.\n\nKing Gustav III had an adviser he could trust, Gustaf Armfelt.\n\nIn 1788, Gustav declared war on Russia but lost it. A large contributing factor to Gustav's defeat might or might not have been the backstabbing and scheming weasels of the Swedish upper class, a ruthless bunch.\n\nOn March 16, 1792 they assassinated Gustav in the Stockholm opera. Many people were involved in the conspiracy. The man who shot Gustav down was Jacob Johan Anckarstr√∂m. Gustav didn't die on the spot but two weeks later.\n\nMore on the assassination of Gustav III.\n\nSee also Assassinations in History.\n\nGustav III was succeeded by his son, who became Gustav IV Adolf.\n\nMore History"
