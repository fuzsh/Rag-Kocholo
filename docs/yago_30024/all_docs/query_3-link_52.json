        "text": "5124. Christian IV’s crown, made 1595-96 by the goldsmith Dirich Fyring in Odense. Gold with enamel, table-cut stones and pearls. Total weight 2895 g. The enamelled figures on the crown’s large points illustrate the virtues which a good king should possess, and at the same time his functions as a sovereign: In front, over the King’s forehead and repeated over his ears is a pelican pecking at its breast in order to feed its young, originally a symbol of Christ’s martyrdom, but here a symbol of the King’s duty to protect and defend his people with his blood. Over King’s right hand Fortitudo, the female rider on a lion, a symbol of the King as warlord, and over his left hand Justitia, the woman with sword and scales, symbolising the King as supreme judge. Over the King’s neck Caritas, the mother with a nursing child, a symbol of the King as head of the Church, his love of God and of his people.\n\nThe insides of the points show the coats-of-arms of the royal provinces. The present black-enamelled coats-of-arms were added for Frederik III’s coronation in 1648, after Denmark had been forced to cede Gotland and Oesel at the Peace Treaty of 1645. Their coats-of-arms can be seen in the circlet of coloured shields that must be the originals.\n\nAlso visible is the coat-of-arms of the Kalmar-Union with three open crowns, which can explain the crown’s open form. The usual European closed crown with the points meeting in arches (as in the Absolutist crown no. 5592) was also the most common in Christian IV’s time. By choosing an open crown like that used by the kings of the Union, Christian IV was stating that he was the heir to a united North.\n\nThe crown was used for the last time at Frederik III’s coronation in 1648. For this occasion an inset section of arches was made, as can be seen in the miniature portrait of Frederik III (no. 5174), so as to close the crown. It was probably melted down and used again when Christian V had the Absolutist crown made in 1670-71\n\n."
