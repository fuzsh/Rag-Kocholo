        "text": "I saw the film (first part) 'Gustav III's äktenskap' and I think it was so excellent movie that other movie makers should watch it and learn how to make quality movies. I would like to order an original version of it but I do not know how. It was subtitled and I am happy that I had a chance to hear the actors speak in Swedish. The actors Jonas Karsson, Iben Hjejle and Magnus Roosman were great and the plot and the dresses and everything were EXCELLENT and so lovely that I do not find words how to discribe it. Definitely I put this movie almost to the best category in my movie list. I would like to cancel my trip abroad on Saturday when the second part comes but my friends insist that I have to travel with them. They do not understand that I want to to see the second part immediately when it comes - not from the video and what if the recording does not work. I really recommend this movie to adults and maybe to kids over 12 yeas of age. All the best to everyone who were part in this movie. This movie affected so much on a positive way into my life. Thank you so much and Happy New Year 2003!!! I LOVE THIS MOVIE."
