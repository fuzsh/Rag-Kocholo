        "text": "Carl Gustav looks a lot like his father.\n\nHe was an interesting royal.As I read somewhere, historians protray him as sympathetic to the Nazi movement in Germany.Some even called him \"The German Prince\".However there is not a lot of proof of this,as this was just speculation.\n\n4.) How come his marriage to Princess Sibylla of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha occurred in Germany? I mean, he was the first son of the first prince to the senior prince up to the king .. one would have thought that marriage would occur in Sweden?????\n\nMany of the Swedish royal princes have got married in the bride's home country, Gustav VI Adolf got married twice in England; Gustav V married Victoria of Baden inKarlsruhe in Germany; Oscar II married Sophia of Nassau in Germany, Oscar I and Joséphine of Leuchtenberg were wedded twice, first a Catholic cermony in Germany without the groom present and then a Lutheran cermony in Stockholm. So Gustav Adolf followed in the tradition of his father, grandfather and great-grandfather.\n\nMany of the Swedish royal princes have got married in the bride's home country, Gustav VI Adolf got married twice in England; Gustav V married Victoria of Baden inKarlsruhe in Germany; Oscar II married Sophia of Nassau in Germany, Oscar I and Joséphine of Leuchtenberg were wedded twice, first a Catholic cermony in Germany without the groom present and then a Lutheran cermony in Stockholm.

Svensk Damtidning has a gallery of his life.\n\nBildextra! Så minns vi kungens far _ Svensk Damtidning\n\nSvensk Damtidning has in this week's issue an article of prince Gustaf Adolf. Although he was baptized as Gustaf Adolf, everyone in the family called him Edmund. And his mother Margareta sometimes called him Västerbotten because she thought it sounded so nice.\n\nImage Upper.com - Free Image Hosting - View Image\n\nImage Upper.com - Free Image Hosting - View Image\n\nImage Upper.com - Free Image Hosting - View Image\n\nImage Upper.com - Free Image Hosting - View Image\n\nAt the time of the very unfortunate airplane accident there were rumors that the beautiful young women (I believe she was a performer - singer?) onboard was not just another passenger.\n\nAmong the 22 persons killed at the crash were U.S. opera singer Grace Moore (age 48) and the Danish actress Gerda Neumann (age 32) who was travelling with her husband and her brother's nephew. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1947_KLM_Douglas_DC-3_Copenhagen_accident\n\nSvensk Damtidning has in this week's issue an article of prince Gustaf Adolf.

Just wondering what would had happened if he would had survived. Politically hardly much and king would still become pretty powerless. But to royal family it would has much consequences. CG would know his father and him would become king much later, perhaps in end of 1990's. This all would surely change his personality dramatically. And another question is would CG have younger siblings? And would CG be allowed marry Silvia Sommerlath or someone else commoner. But I think that he would be allowed do that even if GA is bit relucant for that."
