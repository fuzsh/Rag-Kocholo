        "text": "Frederik VII was King of Denmark from 1848-1863. He was first married to Princess Vilhelmine Marie in 1828 but it ended up in divorce in 1837 because of Frederiks cheating and drinking. 1850 he married a non royalty, Louise Rasmussen. A huge scandal at that time. A King HAD to marry a royal princess in everyones opinion.\n\nShe died at their palace JÃ¦gerspris in 1875 and was interred there in a mound.\n\nCemeteries, Buildings - Religious, Objects - Misc\n\nLinks: en.wikipedia.org\n\nBy: Dania"
