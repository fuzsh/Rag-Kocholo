The king was interested in converting the marsh lands to arable farm land. Germans were known for their good farming skills and for being hard workers, so it seemed like a win-win situation both both Danes and Germans. Magdalena and her husband Mattias decided to take advantage of the opportunity to immigrate to Denmark with their family.\n\nMatthias reported to immigration officials that he was a farmer from Baden-Durlach, an Evangelical Lutheran. [7]\n\nHis family, along with 100 others, departed from the processing center in Altona on 29 June 1761 and arrived in the City of Schleswig on 04 July 1761.[7] He took his oath of allegiance to Denmark on 24 July 1761 and was considered a reserve colonist in Rendsburg.[7] He was recorded as living at 26 Juels Hof in Colony G9 Christiansholm in the area of Gottorf.[7]\n\nThe marshlands were very inhospitable to farmers. Although the Germans were good farmers with typical farm land, it was far more difficult to convert these former wetlands and grow crops. Most of the German immigrants barely reaped enough to feed their families, let alone to provide food for others in Denmark. When Catherine the Great invited Germans to immigrate to Russia, Matthias decided it offered him a better opportunity than what was available in Schleswig-Holstein. He departed for Russia on 01 May 1765.[7]\n\nI wasn't able to find his name in the Index to the 1767 Volga German colonies census reports, even though I checked miscellaneous possible spellings of the surname. The closest name I found was:\n\nHuwa, Johann Heinrich – Dönhof – 1:369 [8]\n\nThis seems to be a completely different person, however, with not only a variation of the surname spelling, but a different middle name and a different Volga German village named as his destination.\n\nIn the 1775 census, Matthias Gula is listed with his wife Magdalena and a 14-year-old son Jakob. If his two older children survived, then they were living in other households, possibly in different villages.\n\n1775 Grimm Census [9]\n\nFamily # 9\n\nHead of the Household Matthias Gula [Hula?], age 50\n\nWife Magdalena Gulam age 52\n\nChild #1 Jakob Gula, age 14\n\nIn the 1798 census, his surname appears to be spelled Gulau followed by a question mark, so it's unclear if this was the real, correct spelling of the surname, or just another iteration of it. Both he and his wife Magdalena, now identified with the surname of Franz, were still living, ages 76 and 78, which was quite a long life for those early Volga Germans who struggled to survive during their early years after immigration to Russia. His son Jakob had married Louisa Barbara Engelhard and the couple had three children: Johann Heinrich, Johann Jakob and Regina Rosina.\n\n1798 Grimm Census [10]\n\nFamily # 14\n\nHead of the Household Matthias Gulau [?], age 76\n\nWife Magdalena Franz Gulau, age 78\n\nChild #1 Jakob Gulau, age 38\n\nWife of Child #1 Louisa Barbara Engelhard, age 23\n\nGrandchild #1 Johann Heinrich Engelhard, age 8\n\nGrandchild #2 Johann Jakob Engelhard, age 6\n\nGrandchild #3 Regina Rosina Engelhard, age 4\n\nMagdalena Gula/Gulau was not listed in the 1834 census. [11] She likely died well before that year. Had she survived, she would have been nearly 110 years old.\n\nSources\n\n↑ Ancestry.com.
