        "text": "Gustav II Adolf (9 December 1594 – 6 November 1632, O.S.) was the King of Sweden from 1611 to 1632. He is known in English as Gustavus Adolphus.\n\nHe is often said to have made Sweden a great power. (In Swedish: Stormaktstiden). He is also said to be one of the best military leaders of all time. Gustav led Sweden to be a military power during the Thirty Years' War and spent most of his reign fighting.\n\nLife\n\nGustavus Adolphus was born in Stockholm. His parents were Charles IX of Sweden and his second wife, Christina of Holstein-Gottorp. When his father died in October 1611, while Gustavus was only 16 years old, he became King of Sweden.\n\nGustavus married Maria Eleonora of Brandenburg, daughter of John Sigismund, Elector of Brandenburg. Their daughter Christina later became Queen of Sweden.\n\nIn June 1630 he landed in Germany, starting the Swedish fight in the Thirty Year's War on the Anti-Imperial Protestant side, which was losing at the time. With Sweden's help the situation flipped so that the Protestants were winning.\n\nGustavus died in the Battle of Lützen in 1632 while leading a cavalry attack.\n\nGustavus Adolphus Day\n\nGustavus Adolphus Day is on 6 November. Every year it is celebrated in Sweden, Estonia and Finland. On this day only, a special pastry is sold that has a chocolate or marzipan medallion of the king.\n\nImages for kids\n\nGustavus Adolphus leading a cavalry charge\n\nThe Lion of the North: Gustavus Adolphus depicted at the turning point of the Battle of Breitenfeld (1631) against the forces of Count Tilly.\n\nGustavus Adolphus at Breitenfeld in 1631\n\nDeath of Gustavus at Lützen by Carl Wahlbom (1855)\n\nGustavus Adolphus's sarcophagus at Riddarholm Church\n\nGustav Adolf Grammar School in Tallinn, 2007\n\nA GAW Flag in the Protestant church of Sopron, Hungary\n\nImage of King Gustav Adolph on a wall of Stockholm Palace\n\nStockholm statue at square named for him\n\nWith his wife\n\nCathedral memorial in Borlänge\n\nDeath location memorial in Lützen\n\nSee also"
