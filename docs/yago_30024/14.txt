Gustav III 1746-1792

Sweden's king Gustav III was an enlightened ruler. Here is more about Enlightenment.

He was the founder of the Swedish Academy.

Gustav was married to Sofia Magdalena, the daughter of Denmark's king Frederick V.

The big subject of the day was the power of the Riksdag, the Swedish parliament. Gustav thought the king should have more power than the parliament, switched laws around, and made it happen.

That was the bloodless coup of August 1772.

Regarding French help, see also Vergennes.

Gustav was a modern man and ready for many reforms. But the Riksdag was sulking and the Swedish nobility grew bitter.

King Gustav III had an adviser he could trust, Gustaf Armfelt.

In 1788, Gustav declared war on Russia but lost it. A large contributing factor to Gustav's defeat might or might not have been the backstabbing and scheming weasels of the Swedish upper class, a ruthless bunch.

On March 16, 1792 they assassinated Gustav in the Stockholm opera. Many people were involved in the conspiracy. The man who shot Gustav down was Jacob Johan Anckarstr√∂m. Gustav didn't die on the spot but two weeks later.
