        "text": "Multi-talented actor-musician-dancer Roshon Fegan became a teen fan-favorite on several Disney TV offerings, prior to branching out as an independent recording artist and reality show contestant. Born Roshon Bernard Fegan on Oct. 6, 1991 in Los Angeles, his mother, Cion, was Filipino and his father, Roy Fegan, was an African-American actor with dozens of film and TV credits to his name. Following in the family footsteps, Fegan showed an early interest in all things performance related. It was not long before the youngster transitioned to a home-schooling program in order to accommodate his acting studies and blossoming professional opportunities. He made his feature film debut with a small role in the blockbuster comic book sequel \"Spider-Man 2\" (2004), followed by more appearances in projects like the popular mystery series \"Monk\" (USA Network, 2002-09) and the Owen Wilson comedy \"Drillbit Taylor\" (2008). It was, however, a supporting role as a break dancer/rapper on the made-for-TV musical comedy \"Camp Rock\" (Disney Channel, 2008), starring the Jonas Brothers and Demi Lovato, that brought the exceptionally talented Fegan to the attention of teens everywhere."
