        "text": "Disney kids and \"Dancing With the Stars\" go together like peanut butter and jelly, so it wasn't surprising to hear that \"Shake It Up!\" star Roshon Fegan would be on Season 14 of ABC's hit reality dance competition.\n\nAnd it looks like the 20-year-old, and his professional partner Chelsie Hightower, may have a pretty good chance at taking home the Mirror Ball.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost widely recognized for his roles on Disney Channel, this musical artist, songwriter, producer and actor -- quadruple threat! -- currently stars on the Disney Channel original series “Shake It Up!” as Ty Blue.\n\nPrior to this role, he appeared as Sander Loyer in the Disney Channel original movies “Camp Rock” and “Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam,” along with other Disney stars Demi Lovato and the Jonas Brothers. Lovato and the Jo Bros have since found worldwide fame outside of the House of Mouse. Could it be Fegan's turn to shine?\n\nFegan also performed songs on the “Camp Rock” soundtrack, as well as the DVD bonus track “Camp Rock.” The aspiring singer/producer recently released his first self-produced EP, “I Am Roshon,” which contains two new tracks written and produced by Fegan himself, “Got Me Like” and “Top of the World.\"\n\nHe writes and produces all of his own music under his independently owned record label, 3inaRo Entertainment, where he serves as CEO.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo celebrate the reveal of the \"DWTS\" Season 14 cast, HuffPost TV put together the slideshow below to help you get to know the new cast. Get to know fellow \"DWTS\" contestant William Levy here. \"Dancing With the Stars\" Season 14 premieres March 19 at 8 p.m. EST on ABC."
