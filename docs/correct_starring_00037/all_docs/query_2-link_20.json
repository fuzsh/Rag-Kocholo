        "text": "Can you tell me about your music career?\n\n\"Music is everything to me. I fully write and produce my own music—It's a mix between pop, R&B, hip hop, and funk. I play a lot of instruments, like the keytar, the guitar, the piano, and drums. I like to incorporate live music into my recordings.\"\n\nHow did you go about producing your own album?\n\n\"Ever since I was small, I've always been into music and computers. At about 14, I had my own studio. Getting a studio at that age and learning how to work everything—now that I'm 20, I can do it all.\"\n\nWhat is your daily training schedule like for Dancing with the Stars?\n\n\"I wake up at six in the morning and rehearse all day. I only have a week to learn a full-on dance, and that seems impossible, but I have to make it possible.\"\n\nWhat are your favorite and least favorite styles of dance?\n\n\"So far, I've really liked the salsa. I did a little Michael Jackson thing when I did the samba, and that was amazing. The dance coming up, the pasodoble, is really challenging. It involves a lot of strength. I'm getting used to it and am just starting to learn it, but hopefully I master it. I really enjoy them all though!\"\n\nBesides winning, what do you hope to accomplish on Dancing with the Stars?\n\n\"I definitely want to win, but with these upcoming dances, I want to show my growth process and that I'm able to take on these dances. I want to show the judges that I can take their criticism and give them what they want.\"\n\nWho do you think is your biggest competitor at this moment?\n\n\"Katherine Jenkins—just because she's leading right now. Obviously, she's doing something right, and I have to catch up and get on top. But the greatest part is that everyone is really cool and we all love being around each other. It's not an awkward thing. We're all there for the same reason, but it's not too competitive. It's a great feeling.\"\n\nWhat can our viewers expect from season three of your Disney show, Shake It Up?\n\n\"Everyone is changing and getting into their characters. The storyline is getting deeper and more real. The show is just maturing. It's already a good show, so I can only imagine it's going to get better and better.\""
