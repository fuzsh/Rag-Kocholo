        "text": "Shake it up taping Season 2 5/24/2011\n\nOn May 24, 2011 we were lucky enough to be able to go to the first taping of Shake it Up season 2. All the cast members were there except the guy who plays Gary Wilde, Brandon Johnson.\n\nWe took some friends and all met at LA Center Studios. We watched Model it Up on the monitors while the pages were helping everyone get to their seats, In that episode, a talent agents discovers Rocky and wants her to do a photo shoot! She comes as an angel and Cece tags along as a biker. The photo shoot goes really well and the talent agent want Rocky to move to New York! Bella tells everyone to pretend that they are OK with Rocky leaving.. in the end, of course. Rocky stays!! This episode was called Model it up!\n\nThen the live taping started. It was fun watching them film, make mistakes, and tape the whole episode! Some scenes were in playback. My hip hop teacher Lindsay Taylor was a back ground dancer! Remi, Kailey Swanson, Hailee Steinfeld and Mason Cook were all there as guests!\n\nThe episode, called Shrink it Up, had three funny stories all together.\n\nGunter and Tinka decide to be nice to Deuce. Flynn buys a toy dinosaur that doesn’t work well. When he goes to complain he gets hired , along with Ty as toy consultants. Rocky gets annoyed with CeCe always getting her in trouble and deciding things for them both with out talking to her about things! The girls go to a therapist for help. The therapist is really funny. Near the end there are flashback episodes with a young Zendaya played by Jasmyne and a young Bella. We see when they first meet each other and even Gunter and Tinka are in the flash back episode!! SO CUTE!! The taping was awesome then after, we got pis and autographs for ourselves and our Twitter friends! We had a blast!!\n\nMeeting the cast of Camp Rock\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nCamp Rock 2 was a Disney Channel Original Movie that was a sequel to Camp Rock. It premiered on the Disney Channel on September 3, 2010.\n\nMitchie Torres (Demi Lovato) returns to Camp Rock with her mother Connie (Maria Canals-Barrera) for another year of summer camp. A rival camp called Camp Star was opened by a old friend of Camp Rack’s owner. Luke Williams (Matthew Finley , MDot) is the most talented performer of Camp Star. He is kind of the leader. He sings Fire at the bonfire when both camps come together. Many counselors and campers leave Camp Rock to go to Camp Star. The Jonas Brothers return as members of a band called Connect 3. When we first meet them, their tour bus has a flat tire and their bus driver Oliver (Big Rob) is trying to fix it. It rolls down a hill and the boys make it to the camp in a truck full of chickens. Chloe Bridges plays Dana the daughter of Camp Star’s owner. Nate (Nick Jonas) falls in love with her and sings Introducing Me to prove he really does love her and can share his thoughts with her! Roshon Fegan and Jordin Francis play Sander and Barron, two talented friends who like hip hop. Tess (Meaghan Martin) decides to go to Camp Star. At the Final Jam, she and Luke Sing “Tear it Down” Frankie Jonas plays Trevor. He takes video of the camp at that video is used at Final Jam when Camp Rock plays What We Came Here For.\n\nThere is a lot of funny parts in Camp Rock 2. There was also a lot of cool songs. At the end, there is a show down between the camps!\n\nI was lucky enough to go to a screening of Camp Rock 2 a few months before it was on TV. We went to the Disney Studios and watched it there. After we met Paul Hoen and a few other people who made the movie. That was cool. They didn’t let us take cameras in but that’s where the pic above was taken.\n\nDemi Lovato plays Mitchie Torres. I met her at a free concert in Glendale. She signed my Friends For Change Poster and was really sweet. She tried to meet a whole lot of fans that day, so I only saw her for a little while.\n\nI haven’t officially met the Jonas Brothers but I went to and their Burn It Up tour, the Road Dogs Game and and The Camp Rock 2 tour in September 2010. I had front row seats so I really enjoyed the concert. I met Ashley Greene there. We went to the bathroom and when we came back, she was in our seat! I took a pic bit it doesn’t really belong here.\n\nSome of the Cast of Camp Rock\n\nDemi and Joe singing Wouldn’t Change a Thing\n\nI’ve met many members of the cast at different events, screenings, premieres, and charities. They have all been nice. I hope you follow them all on Twitter and follow @CR2News .. they are huge supporters of the movie and members of the cast!\n\nMarie Canals-Barrera before the concert\n\nMaria also plays Theresa, the mom on Wizards of Waverly Place.

She attended Debby Ryan’s 16 Wishes premiere and she played basketball with the Hollywood Knights. I met her at these events and a couple of charity events too.

It stars 7 young people and is set in Chicago! I’ve gone to two tapings of the show and met the young talented stars several times! It has dancing, music, friendships, comedy, drama, and everything you want in a show! In the pilot episode the girls who love dance get chosen to dance on Shake It Up a TV show based in Chicago. Stefanie Scott was originally cast as Tinka and then replaced by Caroline Sunshine. Each week, different guest dancers perform. One week , for the taping of Meatball it Up, Quest Crew were the guests. (We were at this taping.

They have a single mother who is a police officer in Chicago!\n\nYou can follow her on Twitter at @Bellathorne143 . She tries really hard to reply to her fans.

Two of the times that we met Zendaya, her mom was here in LA as well!\n\nZendaya Plays Raquel “Rocky” Cece’s best friend, Rocky is timid, nervous and wants everyone to like her. Cece is always pulling Rocky along pushing her out of her comfort zone! Her brother ,Ty, is played by Roshon Fegan.\n\nRoshon Fegan\n\nRoshon’s dad is Roy Fegan, an actor.

Deuce is always trying to sell the girls something strange to make a buck. On one episode, he sold them some clothes that were electrified and shocked them.
