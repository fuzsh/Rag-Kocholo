A brand new, special feature length video for the exhilarating summer anthem “It’s On” will showcase the return of all of our favourite characters; their incredible voices; and world-class choreography that this musical extravaganza became known for.\n\nSince its premiere, Camp Rock has reached over 137-million unduplicated viewers, and its soundtrack has sold 2.5-million CDs worldwide, while spending a remarkable 10 weeks in the Top 10 on the Billboard 200 Album Chart in the US.\n\nThis summer of fun opens on a high-pitched Camp Rock reunion. All the Camp Rockers have returned, eager to tune up and rock out. Nobody's more excited than Mitchie, who anticipates more than a summer of music. Fresh from a world tour, the rock band Connect 3 is hanging all summer - Shane, to pursue last summer's crush on Mitchie; his band mates as moral support. Guitar legend, Brown Cesario, Camp Rock's owner, is ready to rock 'n roll.\n\nBut all is not as it appears at this rocking teen paradise. Across the lake glistens the new Camp Star: a high-tech, big-money music camp funded by Brown's former band mate-with-a-grudge, Axel Turner. Down-to-earth Camp Rock may have passion; talent; and commitment, but Camp Star boasts resources; infrastructure; and money - enough money to poach Camp Rock's counsellors and put Camp Rock out of business.\n\nBut Axel isn't counting on a natural born leader named Mitchie, who vows to save her beloved camp and her friends' summer. Clipboard in hand, she organises the older Camp Rockers into counselors and keeps the camp running. Then Mitchie steps it up again… by challenging the egocentric Camp Star to a Final Jam - an end-of-summer performance duel - may the best camp win.\n\nStarring Demi Lovato as Mitchie Torres; Joe Jonas as Shane Gray; Nick Jonas as Nate; Kevin Jonas as Jason; Alyson Stoner as Caitlyn Geller; Meaghan Martin as Tess Tyler; Jasmine Richards as Peggy; Anna Maria Perez de Tagle as Ella; Matthew \"Mdot\" Finley as Luke; Chloe Bridges as Dana Turner; Roshon Fegan as Sander; Jordan \"J\" Francis as Barron; Maria Canals-Barrera as Connie Torres; Daniel Fathers as Brown; and Daniel Kash as Axel Turner.\n\nCamp Rock 2 provides for an even more unrivalled Disney entertainment experience via a worldwide concert tour - a spectacular live show, filled with headliners, the Jonas Brothers; special guest, Demi Lovato; and the stars from \"Camp Rock.\" Produced by Live Nation, the three-continent concert tour begins 27 July in America.\n\nCamp Rock 2 The Final Jam was written by Dan Berendsen (Disney's Hannah Montana The Movie and Wizards of Waverly Place The Movie), and the team of Karin Gist and Regina Hicks. It is based on characters created by Karin Gist; Regina Hicks; Julie Brown; and Paul Brown. The director and co-producer is DGA Award-winner, Paul Hoen (Disney Channel's The Cheetah Girls One World and Jump In). The producer is Kevin Lafferty and the executive producer is Alan Sacks. Camp Rock 2 The Final Jam is a production of Coin Flip Productions, Ltd and Alan Sacks Productions.\n\nAbout the author\n\nThis is only some dummy text because I dont really know what to write.
