        "text": "The Jonas Brothers premiered their new Disney movie, Camp Rock, last night in New York City. Seventeen was on the red carpet and got to talk to all the stars, including the three bros, and it was quite an experience!\n\nWalking to the theater, we could hear screams from a few blocks away. We were scared we missed the boys walking down the carpet, but discovered that it was actually a line of eager fans warming up for their arrival. Seventeen talked to the girls lined up, and it was official: Everyone couldn't wait for Nick, Joe, and Kevin to arrive.\n\nWe set up our video camera on the carpet and waited for the stars to come to us. Demi Lovato, who plays Joe's love interest in the movie, looked gorgeous and talked to us about what it was like working with the guys. She's even going to be performing on their summer tour, which begins July 4.\n\nAlyson Stoner, Meaghan Jette Martin, Jasmine Richards, and Aaryn Doyle looked beautiful as well. They all talked to us about what it was like filming the movie. Each of the girls had funny stories about working with the Jonas Brothers. Check back next week to see the video and find out what they said!\n\nWe also caught up with the other boys in the movie: Roshon Fegan, Jordan Francis, and Giovanni Spina. They were all really cool and talked about how much fun it was working on set with everyone. There was also lots of talk about dance parties off camera. We wish we could have been part of those!"
