The director is Matthew Diamond (‘Great Performances: Dance inAmerica’) and the cinematographer is Dean Cundey (‘Who Framed Roger Rabbit‘, ‘Jurassic Park’). Emmy Award winner Alan Sacks (‘Welcome Back, Kotter’, ’The Color of Friendship’) is the executive producer. Kevin Lafferty (‘Twitches’, ‘Twitches Too’, ‘Jump In!’) is the producer.\n\ndisneychannel.co.nz\n\nwww.sky.co.nz\n\nENDS"
