        "text": "Dancing With the Stars Unveils Season 14 Cast\n\n\"I'm not going out there in a thong,\" says soap star Jack Wagner (The Bold and the Beautiful). \"Anything else, I'm good to go.\" And so are 11 other stars, who will strap on their dancing shoes for the 14th season of ABC's Dancing With the Stars. Call it the Season of Nostalgia, with actors like Wagner, Melissa Gilbert (Little House on the Prairie) and Jaleel White (Urkel from Family Matters); the \"Empress of Soul\" Gladys Knight and tennis legend Martina Navratilova taking top billing.\n\nListen Up, Twitter: Demi Lovato and Demi Moore Are Two Different People\n\nRecent reports about Demi Moore being hospitalized for \"exhaustion\" have some folks on Twitter confused. It seems they're mixing up the 49-year-old star of G.I. Jane with the 19-year-old Demi Lovato, who has also had her share of medical issues.\n\nDemi Lovato: I Will Deal With My Eating Disorder For the Rest of My Life\n\nDemi Lovato is opening up for the first time about her battles with her life-long eating disorder that landed her in rehab last year. In an interview with Seventeen, obtained by Radar, the 18-year-old actress says, \"I don't think there's going to be a day when I don't think about food or my body... But I will deal with it for the rest of my life because it's a life-long disease.\""
