        "text": "Published August 2, 2013 9:30am\n\nI am very proud to be Filipino and represent…y’know Pinoy Power!” Disney star Roshon Fegan could not have stressed it enough as I asked him about heritage and pride.\n\n“Roshon” to thousands of screaming fans, who gathered July 26 at the Universal CityWalk, topped this week’s headliners celebrating the world famous tourist attraction on its 20th anniversary.\n\nBorn and raised in Los Angeles, Roshon is remembered most lately by all avid viewers of “Dancing with the Stars” as a finalist on its 14th season. He’s been described as not only as an actor but also as a rapper, singer-songwriter, and freestyle dancer.\n\nThe younger generation definitely knows him from “Shake it Up,” and the “Camp Rock” movie franchise starring the Jonas Brothers and Demi Lovato.\n\nAs I walked into the capacity crowd of the CityWalk, I observed that his fans come from all demographics by ethnicity and age.\n\nMan, it’s awesome that you have made a breakthrough; how do you feel about cultural expectations from both sides of your heritage, I asked him.\n\n“I was born and raised here in Los Angeles,” Roshon began. “So this is all I know, this is my lifestyle; but I do know that there’s a lot of people in the Philippines watching every move I make and making sure they’re proud of the moves that I make; I try to keep it in my mind at all times and I try to make very, very wise decisions.”\n\nHe’s aware that mainstream culture celebrates his talent in dance and acting.\n\n“I’m committed to art but I also support Filipino (heritage), if that makes sense haha, “he added bashfully.\n\nHis mother Cion hails from Manila. “But please don’t ask me from what town because I always forget the name of the place,” he laughed. His father is African American actor and producer, Roy Fegan, whose television credits include “The Shield” “Married… with Children,” “The Meteor Man” and “Will & Grace.”\n\nHe says he’s quite conscious that he has to serve as a role model to his younger fans to make a meaningful influence.\n\nA result of his loyalty to his fan base could be seen from the huge crowd turnout at the Universal Studios. Journalist Lydia Solis, said this is the second time that Universal brought him to entertain their patrons: “The last one was around March which also brought thousands of fans, many Filipino youths,” she said.\n\nFrom my initial interactions with him, I find him to be humble, and approachable despite his successes in his young life. I first saw him in his early cameos in “Spiderman 2,” to his supporting credits in “Camp Rock,” to headlining his own popular show, “Shake it Up,” where he plays the popular character, Ty Blue. He’s just launched his own music company. It’s impressive how Roshon managed to retain his exuberance and optimism despite Hollywood.\n\nJudging from his acting forays, he’s already created a global network of followers. If you ask me, he is that proverbial ambassador from the Filipino demographic to the pop culture of America. Definitely his status as a Pinoy icon is firm and well-founded. - The FilAm Los Angeles"
