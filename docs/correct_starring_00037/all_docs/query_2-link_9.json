        "text": "Camp Rock is a 2008 Disney Channel Original Movie starring the Jonas Brothers and Demi Lovato. The music is written by Julie Brown, Paul Brown, Regina Hicks, and Karen Gist. The movie is directed by Matthew Diamond and produced by Alan Sacks.\n\nOn January 25, 2008, during the commercials for Minutemen, it was announced that Camp Rock would debut June 20, 2008. Camp Rock was the second DCOM to air on ABC's The Wonderful World of Disney after its premiere on Disney Channel, and be available online after its premiere on Disney Channel. The movie stars the Jonas Brothers and introduces Demi Lovato for their first lead role in a film. The film took in 8.9 million viewers on the night of its premiere.\n\nA sequel was released in 2010 titled Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam.\n\nPlot[]\n\nThe story follows Mitchie Torres (Demi Lovato), an aspiring young musician who hopes to become a professional singer. Mitchie wants to go to a music camp named \"Camp Rock\". Since the family can not afford the tuition, Mitchie's mother, Connie (Maria Canals Barrera), arranges to cater food for the camp, thus allowing Mitchie to attend. In return, Mitchie must help her mother out in the kitchen.\n\nMeanwhile, spoiled pop star Shane Grey (Joe Jonas), of Connect 3, has been assigned to be in charge of dance classes for one month at Camp Rock by his bandmates Jason (Kevin Jonas) and Nate (Nick Jonas) and is forced to record a song with the winner of Final Jam. Shane accidentally hears someone singing on the first day and falls in love with the voice, but does not know the identity of the singer.\n\nDuring Opening Jam, Mitchie learns that many of the campers have notable roots and is embarrassed that she was only able to come to the camp because of her mother's catering service. She lies and tells Tess Tyler (Meaghan Jette Martin), a girl known for her famous mother and her popularity, that her mother is the president of Hot Tunes TV China. Tess, impressed, invites Mitchie to bunk with her group. Caitlyn (Alyson Stoner) warns Mitchie that becoming one of Tess' background girls will not be as she expects.\n\nWhen Mitchie overhears Shane's new song, she compliments him. Shane, doubtful that his record label and his fans would accept the song, begins to fall for Mitchie. In the cafeteria, Tess and Caitlyn begin to throw spaghetti at each other and Mitchie gets in the middle of the fight. Brown, the owner of the camp, breaks the fight up and Tess frames Caitlyn for the incident. Brown punishes Caitlyn by having her work in the kitchen and Mitchie, who is worried that Caitlyn will learn her secret, does not help her out.\n\nWhen Mitchie accidentally enters the kitchen while Caitlyn is working, Caitlyn learns about Mitchie's secret. At Pajama Jam, Mitchie supports Caitlyn when Tess attempts to upstage her show. Mitchie and Caitlyn reconcile.\n\nShane spreads the word that he is searching for a girl with \"the voice.\" When Tess sees Mitchie and Shane rowing together, she becomes jealous and after finding out about Mitchie's secret, she tells the entire camp. Shane believes that Mitchie lied to him just to use him and Mitchie gets kicked out of Tess' group.\n\nOn the eve of the Final Jam, Tess realizes that Mitchie was the girl that Shane was looking for and frames her and Caitlyn for stealing her charm bracelet, resulting in Brown banning them from the rest of camp activity \"until the end of Final Jam\".\n\nAt the Final Jam, Ella (Anna Maria Perez de Tagle) and Peggy (Jasmine Richards) confront Tess and leave her group. When Tess performs her song, she learns that her mother is in the audience. Unfortunately, her mother leaves the room after getting a phone call and Tess stumbles on the stage. After Brown announces that the Final Jam is over, Mitchie comes out on stage and performs her song, which Shane realizes is the same one he heard on the first day of camp. He sings with her on stage and makes up with her. The judges, Connect 3, announce the winner: Peggy, who had performed under the name \"Margaret Dupree.\" The cast ends Final Jam by performing \"We Rock.\"\n\nCast[]\n\nMitchie Torres (Demi Lovato) Mitchie is a girl who hopes to be a singer someday.
