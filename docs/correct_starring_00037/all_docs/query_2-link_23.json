Call it the Season of Nostalgia, with actors like Wagner, Melissa Gilbert (Little House on the Prairie) and Jaleel White (Urkel from Family Matters); the \"Empress of Soul\" Gladys Knight and tennis legend Martina Navratilova taking top billing.\n\nVIDEO: Shake it Up Stars Dance Even When the Camera Isn't Rolling\n\nAs one of the stars on Disney's Shake It Up, Roshon Fegan often has to dance for fans on the spot. \"They just walk up and instead of saying, 'I know who you are and I want your autograph,' some people walk up and say, 'Do a dance move for me!'\" Fegan tells TVGuide.com. \"I usually do any move I can remember and go for it.\" VIDEO: Shake It Up stars share how show emulates their real life\n\n5 Reasons Adults Should Watch Camp Rock 2\n\nWho says the Disney Channel is just for kids? When its latest original movie, Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam premieres, there will be plenty of reasons for adults to tune in. The sequel stars Demi Lovato as Mitchie Torres, who returns to Camp Rock only to learn that a new rival camp, Camp Star, has recruited some of Rock's campers and instructors. It's up to her and rock stars Connect 3, played by the Jonas Brothers, to save their turf. From the music and choreography to first loves, find out why people of all ages should Rock out from the stars themselves. No. 1: A nod to Classic RockKevin Jonas (Jason) tells TVGuide.com about the pop-culture references in the film that an older generation will appreciate. \"We have images from records, like a couple [of] Bruce Springsteen, Band on the Run ... They're in the middle of the scene and all of a sudden it'll happen, and you either catch it for a second, or it'll go away.\" See photos from Camp Rock 2"
