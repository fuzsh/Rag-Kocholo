As the confident leading talent at Camp Star, a training ground for young musicians and dancers, Luke challenges Camp Rock to a showdown that will prove which camp has the most talented performers.\n\nThat fires up the singers, dancers and musicians on both sides of the lake and they prepare for an all out battle of the bands. Finley comes to the role of Luke as an accomplished R&B musician who has performed as the opening act for Ciara, Marques Houston, Day 26 and others. He was named the best R&B male performer at the Urban Threshold Music Awards in 2006.\n\nHe plays five instruments (saxophone, guitar, piano, drums and bass) but concentrated on saxophone as a student at the Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts. Since he moved to Los Angeles in September 2008, he has been working on his first album. Working on \"Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam,\" changed Finley's impressions about his career.\n\n\"I was working with the heavy hitters for this movie and they're not thinking about niches-acting, music, dancing,\" he says. \"They're into everything, the whole deal.\" Now, so is he. \"I want to usher in a positive image for R&B,\" Finley says. \"By that I mean a positive image for pop, rock, R&B, hip-hop - the urban sound.\" He got his nickname, \"Mdot,\" in college because he became fascinated by the production side of music making, with all its technical components.\n\n\"My friends started calling me Mdot, as in, Matthew-dot-Finley,\" he says. Finley was born July 12, 1987, in Dayton, Ohio. In high school he was a serious golfer and considered going professional but he decided to study music and he fell in love with all aspects of it.\n\nAbout choreographer Rosero McCoy:\n\nBorn and raised in the San Francisco Bay area, Rosero first discovered his passion for dance when performing in front of his seventh grade class. Never feeling like he fit in, McCoy shined and relished in the excitement of performing in front of an audience.\n\nHe attended John O'Connell High School of Technology in San Francisco with the intent of becoming a mechanic until he realized that dance performance could become his future. While in school, he continued to embrace and expand his love and appreciation of dance, frequenting dance clubs and classes as often as possible.\n\nIn 1990, he relocated to Los Angeles, honed his technical training in choreography and got his start in the entertainment industry, dancing and choreographing for Usher, Celine Dion, Snoop Dogg and N'Sync.\n\nHe has since gone on to choreograph projects for Beyonce, Fergie, Tom Cruise, Queen Latifah, Nicole Scherzinger, Ellen DeGeneres, Outkast, Toni Braxton, Tyrese Gibson and Gloria Estefan. He is currently choreographing a movie with Jessica Alba, as well as the newly announced Disney Channel series, \"Shake It Up.\"\n\nMost recently he choreographed MTV's \"America's Best Dance Crew.\" His choreography credits include the feature films \"Alvin and the Chipmunks,\" \"Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel,\" \"Step Up,\" \"Beauty Shop,\" \"Vanilla Sky,\" \"Garfield: The Movie\" and \"Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties.\" Additionally, he has choreographed major commercial projects for Volkswagen, Target and Sprint. His diverse inspirations range from Gene Kelly to Janet Jackson to the opening scene of \"Sound of Music.\"\n\nHe still frequents Los Angeles dance clubs at least three times per week to keep up with the younger generation of evolving dancers. To wind down after a busy day, McCoy enjoys listening to soundscapes in his Los Angeles home. For Camp Rock 2, Rosero drew inspiration for many of the numbers in \"Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam\" from his childhood.\n\nFor \"Can't Back Down,\" the big dance number in Camp Rock's cafeteria, McCoy recalled his family weekends spent camping at Camp Mather in San Francisco and in Yosemite National Park - from eating breakfast in the mess halls to performing in the camp-wide talent shows. McCoy also includes sign language in this number, something he adds to a lot of his dances, to pay homage to his dear friend Jason Howell's father, who is hearing impaired."
