Live.\n\nKnown as the Federal Reserve Bank in the 20's, the old bank vault-turned-studio opened with a master class, offering artists “to work on their triple-threat talent”.\n\n“If owning a dance studio and a music studio inspires others to express themselves like I do, I’m just excited, I’m proud,” Roshon said in another interview with Asian Journal.\n\nHe noted that his love of music and performing arts were part of why Grand Vault Studios was created.\n\nUnique Filipino upbringing\n\nGrowing up, he was inspired to start his career by his mother, who was a singer, and his father, a singer-producer.\n\n“My mom used to let me play with the pots and pans and instead of telling me to stop like most moms would she just let me do it. So the noise kind of turned into music,” he said to The Celebrity Cafe, an entertainment website.\n\nIn the same interview with Asian Journal, he proclaims his love of his parents' culture, and the Filipino's amazing capacity to support budding talents who represent the country well.\n\nIn an earlier interview on The FilAm Los Angeles, a content partner of GMA News Online, Fegan said he always keeps his actions in mind, as he has a young fanbase and is representing country internationally. — Rie Takumi/VVP/VC, GMA News"
