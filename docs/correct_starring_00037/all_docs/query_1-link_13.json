When she's overheard singing - but not seen -- by a teen pop star at the camp, he is completely taken and sets out to find the girl behind the beautiful voice. But first she must confront her fears, step out of the kitchen and into the spotlight.\n\n\"Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam\": Mitchie can't wait to return to camp rock so that she and nice guy rock star Shane can spend the summer making music and having fun with their friends and band mates. But Shane finds himself too busy teaching classes and helping Uncle Brown run the camp to have much fun. Mitchie meets a handsome and talented musician (Luke) from the slick new camp across the lake, and he has all the time in the world for her. All Mitchie's loyalties are tested and she eventually has to choose between Shane and Luke at a dramatic battle of the bands between the rival camps.\n\n{who's w h o}\n\nDemi Lovato - Mitchie Torres\n\nJoe Jonas - Shane Gray\n\nNick Jonas - Nate\n\nKevin Jonas - Jason\n\nAlyson Stoner - Caitlyn\n\nMaria Canals Barrera - Connie Torres\n\nRoshon Fegan - Sander\n\nJordan Francis - Barron\n\nMeaghan Jette Martin- Tess Tyler\n\nJasmine Richards - Peggy\n\nAnna Maria Perez de Tagle - Ella\n\nChloe Bridges- Dana Turner\n\nMatthew \"Mdot\" Finley - Luke Williams\n\n{the music}\n\nwe rock ~ play my music ~ gotta find you\n\nstart the party ~ who will i be ~ this is me\n\nhasta la vista ~ here i am ~ too cool\n\nour time is here ~ two stars ~ what it takes\n\nbrand new day ~ fire ~ can't back down\n\nit's on ~ wouldn't change a thing ~ heart and soul\n\nyou're my favorite song ~ introducing me ~ tear it down\n\nwhat we came here for ~ this is our song ~ different summers\n\nwalkin' in my shoes ~ it's not too late\n\nthe supporters\n\nmillion little stars (Christy)\n\nBefore The Storm (Jordyn)\n\nSomething Special (Adie)\n\njakesprincess (Marian)\n\njump the sun (Raffaella)\n\nMake A Wave (Jess)\n\nCan't Have You (Tori)\n\nlulu-144 (Lucy)\n\nmurphyboy11 (Jordan)\n\n__________________\n\npathological people pleaser\n\nwho only wanted you to s e e her\n\nâ™¥"
