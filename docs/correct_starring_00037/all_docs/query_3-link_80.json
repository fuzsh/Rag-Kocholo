        "text": "Over a decade ago – 2008, to be specific – I watched Camp Rock a couple of weeks after it had premiered on the Disney Channel following months and months of tween tabloid hype. Even then, when I was neck-deep in my M and J-14 magazines and still loving the High School Musical movies, I thought that Camp Rock was pretty much garbage.\n\nSo why did I choose to subject myself to it all over again? Well, it was all because of one offhand comment I made while discussing High School Musical and how much Camp Rock failed to resonate on its level. I suddenly felt masochistic and thought that it might be…interesting…to give this flick another look and see just why it film didn’t work while the High School Musical films did.\n\nTurns out, the reasons why Camp Rock doesn’t work are endless (way more than I remembered). In fact, the very idea of comparing this film to High School Musical gives me a headache because they aren’t in the same league at all. You can tell that this film was trying to be the next High School Musical but, oh, how it failed. My enchantment with Disney tween movies was rapidly wearing off by the time I saw this movie, but I’d like to think that, had it come out a couple of years earlier, I still wouldn’t have supported it.\n\nAt first glance, Camp Rock doesn’t seem that bad. I like a good camp story because, if nothing else, you get pretty woodland scenes and log cabins and swimming in the lake and s’mores by the fire and all of that campy goodness. (This, at least, I will give the movie: the “summer camp” scenery, especially on the lake, is beautiful.) And we have a disgruntled pop star bad boy who has to go to camp for rehabilitation (of course, the characters never describe it as such) and stumbles upon a mystery girl singing and spends the rest of the summer looking for “the voice,” and the girl in question has to learn how to come out of her shell and be herself.\n\nSounds solid, right?\n\nMaybe, in an alternate universe, it would have been.\n\nThe chief issue within Camp Rock: it fails as a musical on a fundamental level. You know the classic writer’s rule where, if it doesn’t add anything to the story, cut it? The same rule applies to songwriting in a musical. And Camp Rock fails this test hard within the first fifteen minutes. The first big number of the film is set at the first night of Camp Rock: this girl named Lola gets up and performs a song about “who’s got what it takes to be my guy” and it’s all hardcore and empowered and stuff – but this character is someone we have never seen before this point, someone we never see again (except maybe in background shots), and what she sings about has nothing to do with the story. I think this song is the worst offender, but it doesn’t get much better after that.\n\nThe songs in Camp Rock don’t progress the story and they don’t reveal anything about the characters or do anything that a musical should. They’re all diegetic numbers (translation: the songs are sung because the campers are performing, not numbers that take place because of musical logic such as “Stick to the Status Quo” or “Get Your Head in the Game” in High School Musical) but that’s no excuse for their lack of insight into the characters or the story. Look at “Start of Something New” and “Breaking Free” from High School Musical, which function both as semi-generic karaoke/audition songs but also have subtext about who the characters are – and the actors latch onto that subtext and make the experience far more meaningful for the audience. The characters in Camp Rock just sing because they’re supposed to sing. It’s depressing. And boring.\n\nWorse still, rather than moving the film along, the songs actually bring it to a grinding halt. Instead of a story that naturally works with the songs, the script is a lazy way of connecting a handful of Radio Disney hits into one semi-functional narrative. Take that scene when the Jonas Brothers just show up and play a song for everyone at the camp – they aren’t there for any real reason in the plot; they’re just there because they’re the Jonas Brothers and every viewer who devoured the tween tabloids would freak out over seeing the Jonas Brothers perform together in this movie. It has nothing to do with the story.\n\nThe film completely gives up the pretense of a plot in the last act, where the Final Jam is just 20 minutes straight of different Radio Disney hits played to dance numbers and it stops caring about if it makes any sense at all. You literally get five musical numbers back-to-back, and it becomes exhausting and tedious rather than exciting. Moderation matters, and there’s a reason why songs are spaced out a certain way within musicals (assuming they’re not sung-through musicals, of course – but even those musicals strategically place the ballads and rousing group numbers and soliloquies apart from one another, rather than doing the same thing over and over again). This experience is like someone honking a horn repeatedly. At a certain point, you just go numb.\n\nOh, and as for character consistency? Forget that. One of Tess’s (Evil Mean Girl, Discount Sharpay) cronies is suddenly in the “Hasta La Vista” number, despite the fact that she ditched Tess literally five minutes ago, because why not? Because the actress is a big face on the poster and they want someone of importance in this number. Forget the fact that it wouldn’t make any sense for this character to be in this song, let alone with a lead singing role. Nah, viewers won’t care! They’re too stupid and enamored with the music and various stars to consider narrative function.\n\nAnd then there’s Tess’s other crony who steps out with a guitar and sings a big old sentimental solo about being in the dark and breaking free from your toxic relationships, or something along those lines, and the film – I kid you not – does a cheap black-and-white flashback montage to all of her moments in the movie prior to this where she was abused by Tess, and it’s so embarrassingly awful and misplaced. We have had no reason to care about this person and then suddenly not only is she given an eleven-o’clock ballad but she also wins the contest, and it’s just like – what? It also steals/copies the arc that’s supposed to be for Mitchie, who also steps away from Tess and learns to not go with the crowd, so whatever impact this moment might have had is also lost because it’s completely redundant.\n\nAs for the story (what little there is): it’s basically Mean Girls meets Meatballs meets DisneyMusicVEVO. The film plays everything so lazily that the “Mitchie hangs out with the mean girls and tries to be popular through lying” plot isn’t strong enough to last half an hour, let alone ninety minutes. To top it all off, Mitchie’s character is entirely inconsistent. She’s apparently shy and afraid to show her true colors and perform for people – but she also approaches Shane (Bad Boy Rock Star) without a moment’s hesitation and speaks her mind to him, and is a desperate social climber who immediately steps up and talks to the camp’s top dogs. Basic logic says that she would at least be somewhat nervous around Shane – or tell him off before she knows who she is, because she definitely wouldn’t if she did – or not know how to fit in with the mean girls at first. Instead, Mitchie is outspoken and smiley to the point where it’s a little terrifying, and she definitely doesn’t read as someone who is shy or uncertain about who she is.\n\nThe only part of the movie that has the potential to be mildly compelling is Shane, Mitchie, and the “mystery girl” arc, probably because it’s the material of fairytales. But Shane and Mitchie’s relationship is so underdeveloped and bland, with no chemistry between the actors and none of the grit that the story was begging for (Shane’s no “bad boy” despite all the claims). And the “mystery voice” subplot isn’t used in any interesting way – Shane hears a voice, he wants to find the girl for the whole movie, and then she reveals herself at the Final Jam. Wow, how very exciting. At least throw in some tension, movie.\n\nThis is where Camp Rock makes me legitimately angry. It pissed me off as a tween, too, because even at that age I saw that the script was being idiotic. See, there’s this moment when Tess hears Shane singing the lyrics of his mystery girl’s song – which Mitchie has also performed for Tess in their cabin – and she races back to their cabin, digs Mitchie’s notebook out from under her mattress, confirms that Mitchie is the mystery girl, and then says ominously, “Mitchie, you are so never going to see Final Jam.”\n\nWhat does she do?\n\nTake Mitchie’s notebook and perform the song herself at the Final Jam so Shane will think that she is the mystery girl (since she’s been trying to attract his attention for the whole movie).\n\nUse her evil mean girl powers to ensure that Mitchie does not perform the song and therefore does not reveal herself to be Shane’s mystery girl.\n\nHold the notebook ransom until Mitchie gives her something that she wants – i.e., swearing not to perform in the Final Jam.\n\nDo nothing with this information and instead perform some completely different song, allowing Mitchie to go onstage and perform her song and everything to go swimmingly.\n\nNo, I don’t think it makes any sense to use Option D either, reader. But that’s what the movie did.\n\nAt the very least, Tess frames Mitchie for stealing her bracelet so she isn’t allowed to compete in the Final Jam, which I guess could be read as her acting in response to this knowledge. But seriously, why give the mean girl – who clearly wants Shane – such a juicy tidbit of information and have her do nothing with it? At this point in the movie Tess and Mitchie already had their falling-out, so Tess was probably trying to stop Mitchie from performing at the Final Jam anyway; it’s not like learning that Mitchie was the mystery voice pushed her over the edge or broke their friendship. And, even if Mitchie couldn’t perform, she could still reveal herself to Shane, which would give her a level of attention that Tess couldn’t stand, so why would Tess just let that be? It’s such bad writing.\n\nMostly, I fault the film’s bones, because there was no getting past this convoluted, derivative script. But the actors don’t do much to elevate the material. Demi Lovato is sufficient, but she has very little acting range and even the scary-big smile that she consistently busts out can’t hide that. And the Jonas Brothers are such amazingly bland actors that it’s somewhat hilarious. Joe fares better than the other two (good thing, because he’s the only one in the movie for more than five minutes) since he’s basically just playing an angry jerk. He probably has the finest moment in the whole film when he begs his bandmates to let him leave Camp Rock: insisting that he’s reformed, he spits out, “I showered in cold water. I looked at a tree. It’s been three hours; I need hair product!” Unfortunately, he doesn’t get to keep up this level of savagery as Shane actually becomes a Nice Person, and the genuine moments just don’t land.\n\nAnyway, the movie ends with a big dance party because of course it would. It’s a discount “We’re All In This Together” where the characters insist in the refrain that they rock, even though they really don’t (both literally and figuratively – the icing on the cake of the Camp Rock experience is that it contains zero rock songs). And I think this really sums up the movie – it’s a desperate attempt to cash in on the High School Musical formula about performing arts kids finding themselves but it fails on practically every level. I suppose, as far as Disney Channel movies go, it’s probably middle-of-the-line (though, not having watched that many of them, I can’t say for sure), but, in relation to the High School Musical films, it’s a complete joke. If anything, this movie’s existence proves just how special High School Musical was: amid paint-by-numbers pandering material like this, those films tapped into something far more genuine, human, and charming, which is why I think they don’t deserve to be easily dismissed as “Disney Channel movies.” Because there’s a big difference between this Disney Channel movie and that Disney Channel movie. And that difference was everything."
