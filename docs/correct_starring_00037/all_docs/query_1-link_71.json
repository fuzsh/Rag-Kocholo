It was just announced today that the title will be Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam and the Jonas Brothers and Demi Lovato are set to reprise their roles at the band Connect 3 and Mitchie Torres. Meaghan Martin, Alyson Stoner, Anna Maria Perez de Tagle, and Roshon Fegan have also signed on for the second movie.\n\nHere's the deal: The campers will return to Camp Rock for another summer –Â but this time there will be a rival camp, Camp Star, that has taken some of Camp Rock's staff and campers! Camp Star's big shot, Luke (played by Matthew \"Mdot\" Finley), will challenge Camp Rock to a huge showdown to see which camp really is the most talented.\n\nAnd if that wasn't enough drama, Nick's character, Nate, will have a love interest this movie! He's going to fall hard for the owner of Camp Star's daughter, Dana (played by Chloe Bridges).\n\nCamp Rock 2: The Final Jam is set to premiere in the summer of 2010!\n\nAre you guys excited? Why or why not?\n\nFor even more dish on CR 2 (Are Demi and Joe going fall in love this time around?!), make sure to get\n\nJ-14's August issue on stands now!\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of Disney Channel"
