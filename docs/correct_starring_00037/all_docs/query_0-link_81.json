        "text": "It’s On! Jonas Brothers and Demi Lovato will rock the summer in “Camp Rock 2 The Final Jam,” a full out rock ‘n roll musical that celebrates music, dance and the freedom of summer and reminds viewers to ‘enjoy the journey.’ Part of the blockbuster Disney Channel Original Movie franchise that introduced a generation to contemporary movie musicals, “Camp Rock 2 The Final Jam” premieres FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 3 (8:00 p.m., ET/PT) on Disney Channel. It will be ushered in by the biggest summer-long experience ever presented by the channel, the industry leaders in providing world-class content for kids, tweens and families.\n\nThe movie’s soundtrack, featuring 15 original songs spanning hip-hop, rock and pop/rock, will be available TUESDAY, JULY 27 on iTunes and in stores nationwide.\n\n“Camp Rock 2” provides for an even more unrivaled Disney entertainment experience via a worldwide concert tour — a spectacular live show filled with headliners the Jonas Brothers, special guest Demi Lovato and the stars from “Camp Rock.” Produced by Live Nation, the three continent concert tour begins July 27 in Dallas, Texas. Tickets can be purchased at www.livenation.com. Further information is available at www.jonasbrothers.com.\n\nBeginning May 11, fans can also access a “Camp Rock”-themed premium iTouch and iPhone app, which will also be optimized for the iPad, to buy tickets to the concert, hear music clips, watch videos and more.\n\n“Camp Rock 2 The Final Jam” is the sequel to the TV/soundtrack/DVD triumph “Camp Rock,” which for 2008 was cable TV’s #1 entertainment telecast in Total Viewers (10.1 million) and TV’s #1 entertainment telecast among Tweens 9-14 (3.8 million). Since its premiere, the Disney Channel Original Movie has reached over 137 million unduplicated viewers, and its soundtrack has sold 2.5 million CDs worldwide while spending a remarkable 10 weeks in the Top 10 on the Billboard 200 Album Chart. The “Camp Rock Extended Rock Star Edition” was the #1 TV movie and the #1 Family TV title on DVD in 2008.\n\nThis summer of fun opens on a high-pitched Camp Rock reunion. All the Camp Rockers have returned, eager to tune up and rock out. Nobody’s more excited than Mitchie, who anticipates more than a summer of music. Fresh from a world tour, the rock band Connect 3 are hanging all summer – Shane to pursue last summer’s crush on Mitchie, his band mates as moral support. Guitar legend Brown Cesario, Camp Rock’s owner, is ready to rock ‘n roll.\n\nBut all is not copasetic at this rocking teen paradise. Across the lake glistens the new Camp Star: a high-tech, big-money music camp funded by Brown’s former band mate-with-a-grudge, Axel Turner. Down-to-earth Camp Rock may have passion, talent and commitment, but Camp Star boasts resources, infrastructure and money — enough money to poach Camp Rock’s counselors and put Camp Rock out of business.\n\nBut Axel isn’t counting on a natural born leader named Mitchie, who vows to save her beloved camp and her friends’ summer. Clipboard in hand, she organizes the older Camp Rockers into counselors and keeps the camp running. Then Mitchie steps it up again… by challenging the egocentric Camp Star to a Final Jam — an end-of-summer performance duel… may the best camp win.\n\nStarring are Demi Lovato as Mitchie Torres, Joe Jonas as Shane Gray, Nick Jonas as Nate, Kevin Jonas as Jason, Alyson Stoner as Caitlyn Geller, Meaghan Martin as Tess Tyler, Jasmine Richards as Peggy, Anna Maria Perez de Tagle as Ella, Matthew “Mdot” Finley as Luke, Chloe Bridges as Dana Turner, Roshon Fegan as Sander, Jordan “J” Francis as Barron, Maria Canals-Barrera as Connie Torres, Daniel Fathers as Brown and Daniel Kash as Axel Turner.\n\n“Camp Rock 2 The Final Jam” was written by Dan Berendsen (Disney’s “Hannah Montana The Movie” and “Wizards of Waverly Place The Movie”) and the team of Karin Gist and Regina Hicks. It is based on characters created by Karin Gist, Regina Hicks, Julie Brown and Paul Brown. The director and co-producer is DGA Award winner Paul Hoen (Disney Channel’s “The Cheetah Girls One World” and “Jump In”). The producer is Kevin Lafferty and the executive producer is Alan Sacks. “Camp Rock 2 The Final Jam” is a production of Sudden Motion Productions, Inc and Alan Sacks Productions.\n\n— Soundtrack in Stores July 27; Tickets Available in May for\n\nJonas Brothers with Demi Lovato and Camp Rock Friends\n\nConcert Tour Embarking July 27 –\n\n(source: Disney)"
