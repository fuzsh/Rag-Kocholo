        "text": "BURBANK, Calif., July 27 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- No. 1 selling recording artist Demi Lovato and the multi-platinum-selling artists, the Jonas Brothers are featured on the soundtrack of the summer—Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam—set to rock into stores and online retailers on Tuesday, August 10th. The album features 15-all new songs from the movie, including three bonus songs (\"Different Summers,\" \"Walkin' In My Shoes\" and \"It's Not Too Late\"). The physical CD also features exciting special bonuses, including the full-length \"It's On\" music video, exclusive interviews with Demi Lovato and Jonas Brothers, and a movie photo gallery accessible through computer ROM drives. \"Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam,\" premieres Friday, September 3rd on Disney Channel.\n\nThe Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam soundtrack will receive its worldwide broadcast debut on Radio Disney's Planet Premiere feature Saturday, August 7th (7:00 p.m., ET/ 4:00 p.m., PT) and Sunday, August 8th (12:00 p.m., ET/ 9:00 a.m., PT). Two of the soundtrack's hits, \"It's On,\" and \"Can't Back Down,\" have been anchored in the Top 10 of Radio Disney's Top 30 Countdown.\n\nAfter the tremendous success of the original \"Camp Rock,\" which became cable TV's #1 entertainment telecast in Total Viewers (10.1 million) and TV's #1 entertainment telecast among Tweens 9-14 (3.8 million) in 2008, the blockbuster Disney Channel Original Movie catapulted Demi Lovato into a global star and pumped up the volume on the hugely popular Jonas Brothers. In addition, the \"Camp Rock\" soundtrack sold 2.5 million CDs worldwide and spent a remarkable 10 weeks in the Top 10 on the Billboard 200 Album Chart for that same year.\n\n\"Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam\" is a full out rock 'n roll musical that celebrates music, dance and the freedom of summer and reminds viewers to 'enjoy the journey.' This summer of fun opens on a high-pitched Camp Rock reunion. All the Camp Rockers have returned, eager to tune up and rock out but a glistening new camp across the lake, Camp Star, poaches Camp Rock's counselors and may put Camp Rock out of business. Mitchie Torres (played by Demi Lovato) steps it up as she challenges the egocentric Camp Star to an end-of-summer performance duel—it's on!\n\nNick Jonas commented, \"In the first movie, music was part of it. This one—music tells the story.\" Demi Lovato added, \"In this movie there are several different kinds of music -- and music is what drives 'Camp Rock 2'.\"\n\nThe accomplished songwriters who contributed to the full out musical film and soundtrack include: Kara DioGuardi, Mitch Allan, Dapo Torimiro, Antonina Armato, Tim James, Jamie Houston, Adam Watts and Andy Dodd.\n\nThe three continent Jonas Brothers Live in Concert with Special Guest Demi Lovato plus Special Friends from \"Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam\" features both artists' hits as well as music from both \"Camp Rock\" films, embarks on August 7 in Chicago, Illinois. The \"Camp Rock\" film stars who will join theLive In Concert world tour include Alyson Stoner, Matthew \"Mdot\" Finley, Anna Maria Perez de Tagle, Roshon Fegan and Jordan Francis.\n\nThe Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam soundtrack will be available nationwide on August 10, 2010 wherever music is sold.
