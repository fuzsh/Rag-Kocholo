        "text": "This may be hard to believe, but it’s officially been more than 10 years since both Camp Rock movies premiered. That’s right, the first flick hit Disney Channel on June 20, 2008, and we cannot believe how fast time has flown by.\n\nFor those who forgot, the first Camp Rock flick was all about a stuck-up rockstar named Shane Gray who was forced to volunteer at a sleep away camp. When he overheard a mystery girl singing and instantly felt a connection to her, he set out on a mission to try to find her. The mystery girl ended up being Mitchie Torres, an aspiring singer and songwriter who was trying to hide the fact that she can only afford to attend the camp because her mom worked in the kitchen. It also starred Demi Lovato, Joe Jonas, Nick Jonas, Kevin Jonas, Meaghan Martin, Alyson Stoner, Anna Maria Perez de Tagle and more! It came out in June 2008, and there’s not a day that goes by that fans don’t miss it.\n\nAlthough they found major success following the Camp Rock premiere, Demi said that if they could go back in time, she wouldn’t become a child star.\n\n“I wouldn’t start that young if I could do it over again,” the singer explained in a June 2017 interview, per People. “It was a difficult transition from child star to transforming into a mainstream artist. It’s something that is very challenging.”\n\nShe continued at the time, “You have to find your identity. For so long you’ve been molded into something and then you’re expected to figure out who you are very fast in front of the entire world.”\n\nOver the years, both Demi and the Jonas Brothers have revisited their Camp Rock days in various social media videos. Amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic in early 2020, Demi shared a series of Instagram Stories videos that showed her reacted to the film. The JoBros, for their part, have recreated some iconic scenes via TikTok.\n\nBut what else has the cast been up to since Camp Rock first aired via the Disney Channel? Well, J-14 decided to do some investigating, and it turns out, they’ve accomplished a lot over the last nine years. Some of them went on to land a ton more roles, while others stepped away from the spotlight to start families of their own! Scroll through our gallery to find out what the cast of Camp Rock is up to now."
