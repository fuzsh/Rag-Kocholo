        "text": "Background\n\nIn 2002, Alyson Stoner became the co-host of the Disney Channel’s “Mike’s Super Short Show” along with Michael Alan Johnson, an infomercial segment regarding forthcoming Disney releases.\n\nShe starred in the 2003 comedy “Cheaper by the Dozen” and in 2005 “Cheaper by the Dozen 2,” playing the character Sarah. Stoner has also appeared in several T.V. shows aimed at the preteen market, including “The Suite Life of Zack & Cody,” “That’s So Raven,” and “Drake and Josh.” In 2005, Stoner recorded a cover version of the Jojo song ‘Baby It’s You.’ She was taking vocal lessons in order to focus on transitioning her style from kiddie pop to a richer tone and texture.\n\nStoner has also hosted a global fan summit on Amazon.com with good friend and “Hannah Montana” star Miley Cyrus. Stoner appeared in the Disney Channel Original Movie “Camp Rock,” along with the Jonas Brothers and then rising star Demi Lovato. Stoner featured in the 2008 Disney Channel Games as a member of the Blue Lightning Team along with Kiely Williams, her “Camp Rock” castmate Demi Lovato, Shin Koyamada, Roshon Fegan, Cole Sprouse, and several overseas Disney Channel actors. She has also appeared as a voice actor in the “Kingdom Hearts” video game series. She played Xion in “Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days” and Kairi in “Kingdom Hearts Re: Chain of Memories.” She later reprised her role for both characters in “Kingdom Hearts III.”"
