It will be staffed by tribal officials Aug. 17-18.\n\n“Montford: The Chickasaw Rancher” will be available to view at 5 p.m., Aug. 17, at the Violet Crown Cinema, within walking distance of the art market, according to Bridget Forshay, Chickasaw Nation marketing manager. CNP and Violet Crown Cinema are co-sponsoring the showing.\n\nForshay, along with Chickasaw Nation Marketing Director Shelly Miller and Senior Marketing Manager Travis Stanberry, will be on hand to visit with actors and interested patrons about registering with the Chickasaw Talent Database online at ChickasawFilms.Com.\n\nThe trio will answer questions and explain the successes enjoyed by the Chickasaw Nation in feature film production and documentaries.\n\nActors and film crew workers, both First Americans and non-First Americans, may register online for inclusion in the database, Miller said.\n\nChickasaw Nation Director of Creative Development Jeannie Barbour will be joined by Philip Sullivan, Chickasaw Nation Director of Video Production and Brad Clonch, Chickasaw Nation Executive Officer of Creative Services, 2 p.m. Aug. 17, at Santa Fe Plaza to talk about CNP, and its mission in films and documentaries.\n\nCNP was established in 2009 as a result of Chickasaw Nation Governor Bill Anoatubby’s vision to utilize film production to preserve the stories of the Chickasaw people.\n\nThe goal of CNP is to educate audiences by producing feature films and documentaries with accurate, positive portrayals of Chickasaw people, history and culture.\n\nEach film illustrates how Chickasaw culture played a significant role in the lives of the individuals and events portrayed in the films, and how those individuals and events influenced the world around them.\n\nCNP has produced critically acclaimed full-length movies and documentaries. They include “Pearl,” “Te Ata” and “Montford: The Chickasaw Rancher.”\n\n“Te Ata” and “Montford: The Chickasaw Rancher” were featured by Netflix during 2023’s National Native American Heritage Month and enjoyed extended airtime.\n\n“Montford: The Chickasaw Rancher” remains available on Netflix.\n\n“Te Ata” portrays the life of Mary Frances Thompson whose stage name was “Te Ata.” She entertained thousands of Chautauqua entertainment seekers as well as European royalty and President Franklin D. Roosevelt.\n\n“Montford: The Chickasaw Rancher” follows the early life of famed rancher Montford Johnson, whose business, at its zenith, included more than 35,000 head of cattle roaming 1.3 million acres in Indian Territory.\n\n“Pearl” tells the story of Chickasaw citizen Pearl Carter Scott. On Sept. 12, 1929, she became the youngest licensed pilot in the United States when she took her first solo flight at age 13. She studied flying with famed aviator and inventor Wiley Post.\n\nCNP’s first documentary is also available on the website. “First Encounter” tells the story of the Chickasaw Nation’s encounter with Spanish conquistador Hernando de Soto in 1540.\n\nMore Stories Like This\n\nKartemquin/Hulu Accelerator Offering $30,000 to Indigenous Filmmakers\n\nHere's What's Going On in Indian Country, August 9th — August 16th\n\nChickasaw Softball Player Wins Her Sixth State Title\n\nAshley Callingbull First Indigenous Woman Crowned Miss Canada Universe"
