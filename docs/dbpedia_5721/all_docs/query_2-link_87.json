        "text": "Every once in a while I read a book which contains the answers to so many of my questions or puts language to everything I have been feeling and gives me that feeling that I am not the only one and I am on the right path. This to me was one of these books. The other two over the past couple of years which did this for me were The Blood & The Glory by Billye Brim and Heavy Rain by Kris Vallotton and another which I read many years ago and still read every so often is Seeing The Invisible and Doing The Impossible by Oral Roberts.\n\nHosting The Presence really blessed me in so many ways and took me deeper. From the outset Bill Johnson stated that the pattern we are to follow in terms of hosting the very presence of the Spirit of the living God is the pattern of Jesus’ life. He says,\n\n“Jesus lived in response to the Father. I must learn to do the same. That is the only example worth following.”\n\nHis observations are deep and profound and yet so simple when he says it. He talks about the first person to touch Jesus on his arrival into the world being Mary the virgin but how the first person to touch Jesus / be in His Presence upon his resurrection was Mary Magdalene until John 20:17. He says how\n\n“Jesus’ promise of sending Holy Spirit would now have to take on very practical expression for this one who had to have more of God. She had found the one thing-the Presence of God.”\n\nIn essence we all have to have more of God, to be continually seeking and growing ever deeper in relationship.\n\nFurther on, Bill Johnson’s statement that\n\n“You are uniquely positioned in this world because of the cry of other people. His favour is upon you so you can be a part of His plan of distributing that same favour to others”\n\njust totally resonates with me on so many levels. From Joshua’s stillbirth and sharing the story (testimony) of how God walked us through that so that others can also walk through it and find their peace with God through the storm, to working at CAP (Christians Against Poverty) knowing that for each client I speak to and help on their journey out of debt, we’re God’s answer to their heart cry for help.\n\nBill talks about how God isn’t into us increasing our knowledge about Him but wants us to increase in our experience and relationship with Him. He says,\n\n“when God gives us revelation, He is inviting us to a new place of experience – knowing Him. To know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled up to all the fullness of God’ (Ephesians 3:19). This verse states that we can know, by experience, what surpasses knowledge or more specifically, comprehension.”\n\nThere were so many parts in this book where I felt such resonance in my spirit that I wanted to shout a massive AMEN such as this:\n\n“If for some reason you can’t seem to sense what to do in a given environment, worship. When in doubt, always worship.”\n\nThis has been my biggest strength in life since coming to know God. Every situation I have encountered I have chosen to worship as if my life or the life of someone else depends upon it. There’s such a beautiful, divine exchange which occurs when I give God glory, praise and honour just for who He is and everything else just takes its place when He is in His rightful place.\n\nIn my journey I have become so aware of many other Christians who make following Jesus about “doing” something for God. Many times the “doing” whatever that may be, isn’t actually for God at all but for a sense of seeking some form of significance or doing good works as if that somehow makes a person better. The God I know and love, has such unfathomable love for me no matter what I do or don’t do. He loved me to extremes before I ever bothered to give Him a second thought, so doing anything for Him now is actually not going to make Him love me any more than He already does. However, Bill says that,\n\n“While it is one of my highest privileges to serve Him completely, my labour is the by-product of my love. This baptism [of the Holy Spirit] introduces us to intimacy at the highest possible level.”\n\nI am so envious of what Bill has but more so of what King David has. I want so much to have greater intimacy with God and go all in over my head, forgetting what’s behind and just pressing on to the greatest prize of eternal life and intimacy with my God, my King, my Creator, my Father. And then, I read what Bill says about his passionate desire to live as Jesus lived, walking with the Spirit of God, so aware of Him with every step. This is the pattern to live. “We must be those who see what’s available and contend for a greater measure of His favour upon us.”\n\nBill Johnson continues to talk about the vital importance of worship followed by the power and presence of Holy Spirit:\n\n“The Presence of God follows wholehearted, extravagant, extreme worship.”\n\n“The people who are people of worship, regardless of circumstances, will become fruitful in ways beyond reason.”\n\n“Massive efforts are made to do church in a timely fashion so we can continue with the rest of our lives. Apparently, many have not yet discovered that we really don’t have a life outside of Christ.”\n\n“We are to know the ways and Presence of the Holy Spirit so we can cooperate with Him in a way that changes the world around us. This is true ministry.”\n\n“In Matthew 28 they [the disciples] received authority, but in Acts 2 they received power. To this day this is true: authority comes from the commission, and power comes from the encounter. And while these two elements seem to have their primary focus on ministry, they are first the essential elements for our engaging the Holy Spirit for relationship. Power and authority introduce us to the nature of the Holy Spirit with a primary focus on hosting His Presence. Ministry should flow out of the relationship with the person who lives in us for our sake, but rests upon us for the sake of others.”\n\nOh my very days – the feeling I have felt so often in church and particularly on a recent Sunday morning meeting which brought tears to my eyes was this – Bill has written it down right here in chapter 10 of Hosting The Presence and this is what I feel is needed for our sakes but also for the sake of our community around us in our city and nation – the Spirit of the Living God as our focus. This book truly is phenomenal – it’s like Holy Spirit is answering everything for me in this book written before I ever realised (2012 when Rebecca was born). There are so many times in church that in the worship we’re just on the brink of something deep and profound, where the Presence of God is being ushered in and we’re hungry for God and then someone jumps up on stage and instead of guiding us in the moment and giving place to God to do what He wants to do they crack on with the programme of taking an offering, giving announcements and welcoming the speaker. It’s utterly devastating to me. Church is not, for me, ever supposed to be about listening to a carefully crafted message by a skilled and gifted communicator but instead is about spending time in the Presence of God, the One who transforms us and empowers us to be all that He created us to be and to transform our nations.\n\nDoing church in a “timely fashion” as Bill puts it may make life appear to be easier to plan family life etc but oh my, what are we missing out on when we do this?\n\nMy absolute favourite times in church which I have experienced on many occasions have been when we have our senior pastors present and their sensitivity to the spirit of God has led them to hold back from just jumping up and carrying on with the programme. Instead, they have stewarded the moment knowing that this is about God and His people having a communion moment. I have been (and have seen other people) healed and touched in profound ways in these moments so much so that it has wrecked me for ever being satisfied with anything less. I am so desperate for more.\n\nTwo more quotes which reiterate and affirm this for me are:\n\n“I’m not sure when it happened, or even how it happened, but somewhere in church history the focus of our corporate gatherings became the sermon. I’m sure the change was subtle and was even justified: it’s the high value we have for the Word of God. But to me, it’s not a good enough reason. That is not to devalue the Scriptures. It’s just that the physical presence of a Bible should never become the replacement of the Spirit of God upon His people.”\n\n“Living conscious of His Presence with us is one of the most essential parts to this life. His name is Emmanuel, which means God with us. The God with us lifestyle is one we inherited from Jesus. We must live it with the same priority of Presence to have the same impact and purpose as He did.”\n\nSo, my takeaways from this book are simply –"
