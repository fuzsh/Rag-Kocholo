        "text": "Scott Lentz, '18, Marketing and Film Studies Co-Major\n\nDuring my time in the business school, I have developed an interest in the softer science of marketing. What makes people tick? How do I market successfully to different types of people? What considerations must I make in marketing to consumers in other countries? While the data is important, I am always more keen to learn about culture…about people. The Film Studies co-major gave me another opportunity to satisfy this desire. Courses in national cinemas enable me to compare and contrast Hollywood to the film industries of other countries. Courses in film history showed me how film reflects ever-shifting cultural attitudes. But, above all else, the through line of my film courses has been understanding people. Film is a powerful art form that displays the human experience in such a unique way; similarly, Marketing is about connecting business to the human experience. I’ve found this connection between two seemingly disparate majors to be truly fascinating and an integral part to my Miami experience.\n\nFilm Studies is a co-major, and thus must be paired with another major outside of the Department of Media, Journalism & Film. The core requirements of the FST major are:\n\nMJF 143 Introduction to Media\n\nMJF 146 Media Aesthetics\n\nFST 201 Film History and Analysis\n\nFST 301 Film Theory\n\nFST 401 Advanced Research Seminar in Film Study\n\n19-23 additional hours are required, and can include courses in national cinemas, genres, auteurs, film production, and other topics.\n\nThe student-run Miami Film Society hosts regular screenings on campus, as well as field-trips to off campus screenings and events. See their Facebook page for more information.\n\nFilm Studies majors also present their original research in a yearly Film Studies Research Seminar, which is open to the public.\n\nSelect students (based on GPA and professor recommendation) may be eligible to attend Miami’s program at the Telluride Film Festival in Telluride, Colorado in September.\n\nFilm Studies’ emphasis on interdisciplinary connections and cinema as a global medium means that our students are exposed to diverse ideas and peoples, and consequently, as graduates they are able to establish unique paths for themselves wherever they go.\n\nStudents who co-major in Film Studies gain critical thinking, reading, writing and viewing skills. In addition, they develop important skills valuable to most businesses, such as creative research and problem-solving, good communication skills and the ability to work in and make important contributions to a team. Our co-major also allows students to study film production, thus many of our students gain the valuable experience of directing, shooting and editing their own movies. As a result, Film Studies students find employment in a wide range of film and media related fields- as directors, producers, writers, editors, curators, festival programmers, marketers, designers, events managers, teachers, or even professors."
