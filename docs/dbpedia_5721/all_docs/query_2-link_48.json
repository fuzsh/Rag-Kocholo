        "text": "Crashing the \"company car\"-and a rented one at that-may\n\nspell unemployment in most industries. But in the world of independent\n\nfilm, just such an occurrence proved to be the first learning experience\n\nfor editor Tom McArdle. For more than a decade, McArdle has worked\n\nthe editing room with some of today’s biggest indie success stories,\n\nbeginning with Nick Gomez’s classic Laws of Gravity, and\n\nmost recently with Tom McCarthy’s The Station Agent, which\n\nwon accolades at Sundance and took home the Audience and Best Screenplay\n\nAwards, as well as the Best Actress prize for Patricia Clarkson.\n\nAn unconventional tale of loneliness and, ultimately,\n\nfriendship in an old train depot, McArdle says he was attracted\n\nto the script\n\nbecause of its warm treatment of existentialist themes. Here, he\n\ndiscusses his commitment to the world of indie film and why a film\n\nabout a \"train-obsessed dwarf who lives in an abandoned depot\n\nin rural New Jersey and reluctantly becomes friends with an overly-talkative\n\nCuban hot dog salesman\" seemed like a sure bet.\n\nJennifer Wood (MM): What was the film that inspired\n\nyou to become a film editor?\n\nTom McArdle (TA): The film that made me want to become\n\na film editor was All That Jazz. I was 11 when it came out\n\nand I wasn’t allowed to see R-rated films at the time. A friend\n\nand I snuck into the theater and later told our parents that we\n\nhad seen The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh. Anyway, All\n\nThat Jazz had a lot of scenes that take place in the cutting\n\nroom (showing Roy Scheider as the Bob Fosse character and editor\n\nAlan Heim working on Lenny). The cutting room seemed like\n\na very interesting place. There were scenes that showed Fosse and\n\nHeim changing scenes and also the overall structure of the film-within-the-film.\n\nAlso, the cutting style of All That Jazz itself seemed really\n\nunconventional. Some scenes cut out before you thought they would,\n\nand there were the quick-cut montages of the Fosse character popping\n\npills and talking to himself in the mirror. And, of course, there\n\nwere the very dynamic dance numbers shot from multiple angles.\n\nOn top of all that, the glimpse into the lifestyle of an artistic\n\nperson living in the big city seemed very exciting to a shy suburban\n\nyouth.\n\nMM: How did you first get into editing, and how did\n\nyou land your first feature?\n\nTA: I studied film (and English lit) at Dartmouth College.\n\nI always knew I wanted to edit. When I graduated, two Dartmouth\n\nalums I knew who worked in editing, Bill Johnson (who won an Emmy\n\nfor editing The West Wing) and John Gilroy (who cut Narc)\n\ntold me about this new independent film production company in New\n\nYork City called The Shooting Gallery. I went down there and started\n\nworking as a PA. The Shooting Gallery specialized in low-budget\n\nand no-budget filmmaking. A lot of people there had worked on Hal\n\nHartley’s films.\n\nOn my third day on the job, I was driving a cube rental truck\n\nand got cut off by a cab driver and crashed into some Con Ed equipment.\n\nI figured my career was over before it began. However, since this\n\nwas the world of guerilla filmmaking, the production manager thought\n\nquickly and called the truck rental company and blamed the accident\n\non the (supposedly) faulty truck. The company gave us the truck\n\nfor free for the week and paid for the repairs. So I learned right\n\naway that things can turn around pretty quickly. After a few weeks\n\nat The Shooting Gallery, I started assistant editing. A couple\n\nmonths later I was editing short films. Then Nick Gomez asked me\n\nto cut his $38,000 documentary-styled Laws of Gravity, which\n\nwas my first job as a feature editor. The success of that film\n\nallowed me to keep editing features on a regular basis.\n\nMM: You seem to gravitate more toward independent fare\n\nin your work. What is it about the indie world that keeps you\n\ncoming back?\n\nTA: I guess the concepts for the projects are less broad\n\nand more personal. I like films that aren’t completely predictable.\n\nI also like films about outsiders. There is always the hope that\n\nindie films can say something new, take risks.\n\nMM: At the same time these kinds of films are usually\n\ncreated in a shorter time span and on a much lower budget. How\n\ndo you think these two factors affect the need for creativity\n\nand, ultimately, your role as editor?\n\nTA: Well, a lower budget might mean\n\nthat some things get rushed during the shoot. Then, in editing,\n\nyou might have to figure\n\nout ways around certain problems. Sometimes I may not have enough\n\ncoverage for a scene or two, so I might start to think about making\n\na montage out of incomplete scenes or inter-cutting scenes. There\n\nis usually some sort of solution. Also, due to the lower budgets,\n\nI might be asked to work fast, which I’m used to.\n\nMM: What was it that attracted you to The Station\n\nAgent?\n\nTA: How can you not like a script about a train-obsessed\n\ndwarf who goes to live in an abandoned depot in rural New Jersey\n\nand reluctantly becomes friends with an overly-talkative Cuban\n\nhot dog salesman? Seemed like a sure bet to me. But seriously,\n\nI like scripts about outsiders, existentialist stuff, and this\n\nscript had that. Then it turns into something else along the way,\n\nsomething sort of off-handedly warm. I also liked Tom McCarthy’s\n\ncomedic tone in the script, which was sort of deadpan, with funny\n\nsmall moments. Tom McCarthy, personally, is a hilarious guy, so\n\nworking with him on the film was a ton of fun.\n\nMM: The film marks Tom’s feature debut, but you have\n\na lot of experience working with first-time directors. What are\n\nthe questions you generally ask of a director before deciding\n\nto work together? And what are the personality traits that attract\n\nyou to a director, regardless of experience?\n\nTA: Well, when I first meet a director, I try to get a\n\nsense of whether the person has a good amount of life experience\n\nand intelligence. I also look to see how they handle people. You\n\nknow, if we meet at a restaurant, are they nice to the waiter?\n\nThen I also try to find out about the director’s film sense–have\n\nthey made short films or gone to film school? What kind of films\n\ndo they like? Things like that.\n\nMM: In deciding how to tackle a film editorially, what\n\nare the questions you ask (either of yourself or the director)–and\n\nwant answered–before the process begins? Do you have ways to\n\nto solidify the story and where you want to go with it before\n\nyou start cutting?\n\nTA: I ask about the films that the director\n\nfeels have a similar style or tone to the film that we’re about\n\nto make. These influences can then be referred to throughout\n\nthe process as touchstones.\n\nSometimes in the edit, you are simply going for ‘a feel,’ and how\n\ndo you describe ‘a feel’ properly? So having other films as tone\n\nor mood reference points helps. There can also be perfomance touchstones.\n\nOn some jobs the editor and director may say to each other ‘Let’s\n\nmake it more Steve McQueen’ or ‘more Daniel Auteuil’ or whoever.\n\nThen you can shape a performance around an idea.\n\nMM: Is there any one aspect of a film that clues you\n\nin best to the editing–the script, the acting, the cinematography,\n\netc.?\n\nTA: Well, you always start out trying to tell the story\n\nas written. However, as Francis Ford Coppola says on The Conversation DVD\n\ncommentary, the script cut never quite works out as well as you\n\nmight hope it will. Then, once you get past that whole issue, I\n\nthink it usually works out that the acting drives the edit a lot\n\nmore than anyone would want to admit. I think everyone, whether\n\nin the film business or not, is very sensitive to false acting\n\nmoments. To me a false acting moment is like someone playing a\n\ntrumpet and hitting the wrong note. You just cringe, and the film\n\nloses credibility. So in the edit, you do whatever you can to keep\n\nthings feeling real all the time.\n\nMM: The Station Agent is very much\n\na \"character\" piece.\n\nNot just in the sense that it’s about people rather than action,\n\nbut in that it’s about three clearly-defined characters, the\n\nlikes of whom we don’t often see on the big screen. What does\n\nit help you to know about the characters, in particular, in deciding\n\nhow to edit a film?\n\nTA: It’s good to know some backstory, if you can. The film\n\nI am editing right now, Killer Diller, is based on a novel\n\nby Clyde Edgerton and, in preparation, besides reading the script\n\na number of times, I read the book a couple times so I could know\n\nwhat the characters were thinking at any given moment. Then, if\n\nI know what they’re thinking, I can choose reaction shots to reflect\n\nthat, even though it might not be in the script. Books have the\n\nspace to describe thoughts, scripts usually do not.\n\nMM: Do you like to choose a different editing style\n\nfor each of the characters, to help define them better on screen?\n\nTA: In general, I do not try to establish an editing style\n\nfor individual characters. However, in The Station Agent,\n\nI think Fin may have ended up getting his own editing style in\n\nsome scenes simply because of his reluctance to connect with others\n\nand his deadpan expressions. Sometimes, cutting at a certain moment\n\nto his emotionless face just staring at people could only make\n\nyou laugh.\n\nMM: The film made its debut on the\n\nfestival circuit, premiering at Sundance, playing at Toronto,\n\nDenver, Mill Valley,\n\nAspen, Chicago and San Sebastian and winning a number of awards\n\nin the process. How satisfying is it to you to create such a\n\npersonal film and have it touch so many people throughout the\n\nworld?"
