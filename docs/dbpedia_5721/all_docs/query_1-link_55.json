        "text": "To Senators Sherrod Brown and J.D. Vance and U.S. Rep Bill Johnson:\n\nDear gentlemen,\n\nEnclosed is an editorial I wrote recently that I feel you should read. I am 90 years old and have live a charmed life in the greatest Republic man has even devised. However, I am witnessing either corrupt or inept leadership in our federal government leading and accepting change that is, in my opinion, un-American.\n\nI am asking you, as my representative in the federal government, to resist this constitutional and certainly un-American direction that our country is facing today.\n\nThe list of misdirection extends beyond the unbelievable debt, inflation, open borders, weak foreign policy and the domestic handouts, to name a few. The list is simply a collection of bad policy decisions and lack of sensitive, intelligent American leadership.\n\nMy children and yours will look back and determine if today is a turning point in American history or the continuation of our status quo government continuing to fail its constituents.\n\nAt the age of 90, I have lived under presidents from Hoover to Biden, The Depression, World War II, Vietnam, the continuing Middle East unrest and am an Army veteran. I have never been more pessimistic about the direction of our great country than I am today.\n\nPlease, for the sake of our great country, throw away your political prejudices and put on your American hat. You are all leaders and we are staking our country’s future on your leadership.\n\nRonald J. Price,\n\nSebring\n\n———-\n\nI Don’t Recognize My Country Anymore\n\nReflections on a life well-lived in a country well-loved.\n\nAs I watched TV news a few nights ago, a high school teacher was severely mugged in the cafeteria of a high school. The worst situation I experienced through 12 years of school was some one chewing gum being sent to the principal’s office. Of course, I graduated from Wellsville High School in 1949.\n\nWhen Dr. Daw, our local school superintendent visited our elementary classes, which was frequently, we all stood up and said, “Good morning, Dr. Daw.” Now we have patrol officers on duty and visiting.\n\nAs class began, we all stood and recited the “Pledge of Allegiance.” Do they even do that anymore?\n\nWe loved and were proud of all products marked, “Made in America.” Made in China” is more popular now. I am told slave labor is much cheaper!\n\nBack in 1949, political correctness was considered ridiculous if even considered. Merry Christmas, Happy Easter, etc. were “in.” Tribalism, populism, identity politics were “out.” We had two pronouns: “He” and “She.” We were also paying off our gargantuan debt from World War II.\n\nRadio programs we listened to faithfully (TV would come later) supported truth and honesty: The Lone Ranger, Mr. D.A., Henry Alderich, Fibber McGee and Molly, etc.\n\nAs boys and men, we respected adults and encouraged.\n\nAn accused individual was considered “innocent until proven guilty.” Now, it seems, “The guilty are presumed innocent.” Look at our bail system, homelessness and drugs!\n\nUnsavory tactics by Justice, the FBI and even politicians were frowned upon. Don’t mention Hunter’s computer today or Joe’s Chinese ties or illegal immigration or fentanyl or no jail time for those who unconstitutionally harassed our Supreme Court Justices.\n\nJudicial coercion was considered un-American. The word “equity” meant just what it stated, “Equal Opportunity,” not equal outcomes.\n\nAre we better off today than when I graduated from Wellsville High School in 1949? After reflecting on my over 90 years of living in this great country of ours, my answer is “not really!” Why? Because, we have, as a country, changed dramatically, overturned many of our values and as such lost our way. This country is rapidly heading in the wrong direction. And, the latest polls show over 70 percent of American agree. We are becoming a “nanny” country and our politicians are abetting the change.\n\nWe can accept the status quo or stand up for what over 70 percent of us believe. How do we do that? The ballot box has been the savior of our country many times before. It will again steer this great country, the greatest Republic the world has ever seen, back to freedom, free enterprise and continuing equal opportunity."
