        "text": "Contents\n\nThe Council of Science Editors scientific style of documentation is used primarily in the physical sciences, life sciences, and mathematics. CSE offers two systems for documenting sources: 1) a Citation-Sequence system, 2) a name-year system. This guide explains the CSE Name-Year system, which his very similar to the Author-Date system used by the APA (refer to APA guide for more information and specific formatting examples).\n\nInserted at the point of reference, an in-text parenthetical citation containing the author's name and the date of publication interacts with the end documentation by pointing to a specific entry in the References List.\n\nThis guide is based on Scientific Style and Format: The CSE Manual for Authors, Editors, and Publishers (8th ed.) 2014, a publication of the Council of Science Editors. Formatting examples are also based upon the National Library of Medicine Recommended Formats for Bibliographic Citation Supplement: Internet Formats. 2nd Ed. 2007. [Updated Aug 2015].\n\n[Guide Updated Jul 2017]\n\nCiting Sources within Your Document\n\nThe CSE Name-Year in-text citation system follows a parenthetical format rather than the superscripted numbers found in the CSE Citation-Sequence system. It emphasizes authors' names and dates of publication, both of which are important benchmarks denoting relevancy and validity in the social and the hard sciences.\n\nIn some cases, chapters, paragraphs and page numbers are required. Regardless of contents, the parenthetic citation should immediately follow the cited material within a sentence and before the period if it is at the end of the sentence. In the case of quoted material, the citation is placed between the final quotation mark and the period at the end of the sentence.\n\nCSE Name-Year In-Text Formatting Rules\n\nCSE Name-Year in-text formatting rules are as follows:\n\nOne space should separate the author's name and the year of publication.\n\nPage numbers are included only when part of a source or a direct quotation is cited. The abbreviation (p), without a period should precede the page number(s).\n\nPlace a comma and one space after the year of publication when including a page number.\n\nSpecific rules depend on whether part or all of a source is being cited as well as whether or not the author's name is mentioned in the sentence where the citation occurs.\n\nExamples of Name-Year In-Text Formatting Rules\n\n1. Citing an Entire Source\n\nWhen citing an entire work, document the last name of the author and the year of publication. No page numbers are necessary. The citation format will vary according to whether the author's name is mentioned in the sentence being cited.\n\nAuthor Name Not Included in Preceding Sentence\n\nFormat:\n\nCite both the last name of the author and the publication date. The citation is placed in parentheses directly following the information being cited. When the citation falls at the end of the sentence, the parenthetical note precedes the end punctuation (the Period). One space separates the author's name and the date.\n\nExample:\n\nIn one such study (Anderson 1997)...\n\nAuthor Name Included in Preceding Sentence\n\nFormat:\n\nWhen the author's name is mentioned in the sentence, you may omit this name from the parentheses to avoid redundancy, using only the date. The date (in parentheses) should follow directly after mention of the author's name.\n\nExample:\n\nAnderson (1997) determined that...\n\nExamples of Variations to Name-Year In-Text Formatting Rules\n\n1. Citing Anonymous Sources\n\nFormat:\n\nThe word \"Anonymous\" replaces an author's name in the parenthetic citation of a work authored by an anonymous source rather than the abbreviated title. The reference list entry begins the same way.\n\nExample:\n\nCritics occasionally mention the difficulty of interpreting findings like these (Anonymous 1995).\n\nCiting Sources at the End of Your Paper\n\nThe end documentation in the CSE Citation-Sequence system is called the References list. It is located at the end of a document or book and contains all the bibliographic information needed to find out more about each cited source within the text.\n\nThis page is a selective bibliography and does not include a full accounting of sources related to or consulted before you began writing your document, but only those actually cited. You may want to include sources that directly informed your thinking but aren't explicitly cited in the text on a separate page entitled Additional References. Further reading suggestions or a fuller bibliography should be placed on yet another page entitled Additional Reading or Bibliography.\n\nProper CSE documentation depends on the References page. Without it the in-text numbers would make little sense as they would no longer be pointing at any corresponding entries in the end documentation.\n\nCSE References Formatting Rules\n\nCSE References formatting rules call for the end documentation to begin on the last page of your document, not on a separate one. If your document is 6Â½ pages long, the References list should begin on page 7, directly below the concluding text of your document.\n\nThe References list formatting rules are as follows:\n\nReferences is the most common title, however Cited References or Literature Cited are acceptable titles as well.\n\nThe title should be placed flush-left on the page and may appear Bold, Underlined, or capped in UPPERCASE letters.\n\nDouble space between title and first entry; single-space all other entries.\n\nSet font-size one or two point (type) sizes smaller than the document text.\n\nThe first line of each entry is flush-left. Indent each subsequent line five spaces from the left margin (the normal tab-button default space).\n\nArrange entries alphabetically.\n\nCSE Bibliography formatting rules differ slightly from the References rules:\n\nThe title--Bibliography--replaces the word References at the top of a separate page.\n\nEntries are arranged alphabetically, last name first.\n\nOptional elements such as author affiliations, original language, notes, etc., may be included here. More information on their placement is available online in National Library of Medicine Recommended Formats for Bibliographic Citation, (pdf file).\n\nExamples of CSE Name-Year References Formatting\n\nBooks and Book Parts\n\nNote: For consistency, book entries should be formatted with the initials of authors and editors first names when the References list includes journal article entries [for which the rule calls for using initials rather than the first names of authors and editors] as well.\n\n1. Book with One or More Authors\n\nFormat:\n\nLast Name and Initial(s) of Author, [Followed by Last Name and Initial(s) of Other Authors, if Any]. Year of Publication. Title of Book.
