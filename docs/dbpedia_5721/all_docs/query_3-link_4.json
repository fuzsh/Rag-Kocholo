        "text": "Sean Feucht’s documentary film, “SUPERSPREADER: THE RISE OF #LETUSWORHSIP” has been shown in 235 theaters across the United States since it debuted last September. This month, it will be shown in New Zealand and Australia, and plans are underway for it to be viewed in Canada, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. The film, which was just released on DVD and online, has grossed $399,000 in box office revenue.\n\nOn Oct. 10 and 11, the Feucht film even appeared at Redding’s Cinemark 14 theater. An exuberant Feucht posted a Facebook video about it.\n\nThe 39-year-old Feucht is a far-right evangelical preacher and musician. Feucht previously worked for Bethel Church, a Redding mega-church, as a worship leader and musician. His million-dollar nonprofit is headquartered at his Redding residential property.\n\n“SUPERSPREADER” focuses on Feucht’s “Let Us Worship” revival tour that started in 2020. Feucht toured the country as he preached, played music, promoted his far-right politics and protested government-mandated limitations placed on in-person church services enacted to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Despite the pandemic mandates that banned in-person events with large groups of people, between 2020 and 2022 Feucht’s “Let Us Worship” events took place in nearly 200 cities. The film features recorded video footage from “Let Us Worship” events in a few select cities. The film also features commentary from a bevy of far-right religious leaders, media personalities, and politicians. Bethel Church’s Senior Leader Bill Johnson speaks in the film on several occasions.\n\nAttendees at “Let Us Worship” events did not wear masks or practice social distancing. The events were frequently scheduled in cities experiencing surges in COVID-19 cases, something Feucht expressed in the film as a source of pride. At times, Feucht intentionally scheduled shows in cities rife with social unrest in the wake of the killing of George Floyd.\n\nThe title of the film was appropriated by Feucht from a Rolling Stone journalist who called him a “superspreader” because of his “Let Us Worship” events held during a pandemic. Feucht claimed in the film that contact-tracing tests performed after every event found they were not tied to any Covid-19 outbreaks. However, Feucht never previously shared any information about contact tracing as he traveled the country, and this seems like a nearly impossible feat.\n\n“SUPERSPREADER” was produced by Michael Mauldin and his company Mauldin Media. Mauldin Media is a subsidiary of Mauldin Ministries, a multimillion-dollar religious nonprofit based in Broken Arrow, Okla. Mauldin’s wife, Meredith Mauldin, is a B-movie actress and Christian singer professionally known as Meredith McCoy. McCoy has performed with Feucht across the country at his “Let Us Worship” events.\n\nFeucht’s documentary presents the argument that the stay-at-home measures designed to prevent the spread of COVID-19 were more harmful than the deadly virus. The film also pushed the conspiracy theory that those measures were part of a communist plan to take over the country.\n\nFeucht says California is on fire\n\nFeucht said in the film that California is figuratively and literally on fire. As Feucht explained this statement, the film shared several video clips of the deadly and destructive wildfires that have swept through various portions of Northern California. Feucht exploited the death and suffering countless people faced by using video footage from various wildfires to drive home his point that he is here to save the day. The film also showed scenes of a small wildfire that appeared intentionally ignited for the film.\n\nShasta County Film Commissioner Sabrina Jurisich told A News Café that she and the Shasta County Film Commission assisted with helping Feucht’s filmmakers locate the proper resources to create the fire scene. Jurisich and the film commission were both given “special thanks” in the closing credits.\n\n“We supported on their exterior shots including connecting them with a local fire department for vehicles, and staff, and to create a fire scene,” said Jurisich. “This had been a particularly hard scene to source in drought-stricken California at the time of the filming”.\n\nJurisich told A News Café that the film commission connected the filmmakers with several local fire departments. The Shasta Lake Fire Protection District and its Fire Chief, Dennis Beck, were the only fire departments and firefighters given “special thanks” in the closing credits.\n\nBeck, however, told A News Café he did not know why the filmmakers thanked him and the department.\n\n“To the best of my Knowledge Shasta Lake Fire Protection in no way aided the production of this documentary or its filmmakers,” Beck said.\n\n“As to why he gave special thanks to this agency, I do not know. I had to actually Google who or what ‘superspreader’ was, to even answer this question”.\n\nSpecial thanks to local far-right media personality\n\n“Special thanks” in the closing credits were also given to Redding-based, Bethel-Church connected, far-right media personality and Feucht pal, David Harris Jr. In May of 2022, Harris Jr. and Feucht were photographed together during a film premier party at President Trump’s Mara-Lago resort. The featured premier film was 2000 Mules – a widely debunked documentary that disseminated wildly inconceivable misinformation about voter fraud.\n\nHarris Jr. has spoken at both “Let Us Worship” and Red, White, and Blueprint events. Despite being thanked in the credits, Harris Jr. did not appear in Feucht’s film.\n\nRun for Congress paves the way for pandemic protests\n\nFeucht claimed in the film that he was “seething with rage and anger and hurt” and also shocked by his unsuccessful run for California’s 3rd Congressional District in 2020. His loss was nearly inevitable as Feucht did not live in the district, and he was running as an unknown Republican candidate in a heavily Democratic district. Feucht came in third place with 13.5% of the vote.\n\nEven though Feucht was troubled about losing the election, he said “the Lord” spoke to him and told him to be ready for new challenges. Those challenges would materialize, for Feucht, in the form of Gov. Gavin Newsom’s stay-at-home mandates that limited in-person church services.\n\nBethel Church and Redding\n\nSenior Bethel Church leader Bill Johnson warned, in the film, that the government is dangerous because it only takes control of people’s lives and does not protect freedoms and liberties. Johnson, an anti-vaxxer who once referred to the COVID-19 vaccine as the “mark of the beast,” was essentially criticizing the limitations placed on church service in 2020 designed to prevent the virus from spreading.\n\nAll of the interviews filmed for the documentary of Sean Feucht and his wife Kate Feucht were recorded in and around their Redding home. In some scenes, Sean Feucht sat in the middle of his deluxe two-story man-cave outbuilding filled with tens of thousands of dollars’ worth of mounted big and small game animals he has killed around the world.\n\nIn other scenes, Feucht, wearing a worn-out T-shirt and jean jacket, sat on an old Chevy truck’s open tailgate. The scenes of Feucht shot around his home depicted him as someone who lives out in the country.\n\nInterviews not recorded at luxurious Orange County home\n\nAlthough the Feuchts previously considered their Redding home their primary address, it now mostly serves as the address for Sean Feucht Ministries, Inc., Feucht’s nonprofit tax-exempt cash cow.\n\nAs first reported by A News Café, Feucht’s nonprofit company saw its income increase from $284,000 in 2019 to $5.3 million in 2020 – a significant amount of which is thought to come from donations. Now, the Feucht family’s primary residence is a lavish home in a private Orange County neighborhood that Feucht and his wife purchased for $1.65 million in February 2022. In fact, the Feuchts and their nonprofit own millions of dollars in residential properties, much of which was purchased after the start of Feucht’s “Let Us Worship” 2020 tour. Feucht and his fellow performers ask for donations at every “Let Us Worship” event. They also beg attendees to buy Sean Feucht merchandise.\n\nOne of the Feuchts most recent purchases is a million-dollar cabin in Montana that they rent out as an Airbnb vacation property. It is listed on the Airbnb website for double the going rate of other comparable rental properties in the area, and has only been reviewed five times since the summer of 2021. The Montana property is almost never reserved and currently has no bookings through 2023.\n\nBethel Supernatural School grad Whitney Beaudoin\n\nThroughout the film, Bethel School of Supernatural Ministry graduate Whitney Beaudoin shared her experiences working as Feucht’s executive assistant during the “Let Us Worship”.\n\nAs previously noted on A News Cafe, Feucht officiated Whitney Beaudoin’s marriage to Jamie Beaudoin in Texas in February of 2022. Jamie Beaudoin works for Feucht as a guitar player, producer, and personal assistant. Jeremy Edwardson, creator and director of the far-right propaganda media company Red, White and Blueprint, attended the wedding. Edwardson is also close friends with Feucht.\n\nJamie Beaudoin has produced music for Red, White and Blueprint docuseries episodes and, like his wife, is a graduate of BSSM, (Bethel School of Supernatural Ministry). Beaudoin also works as an engineer and producer at Edwardson’s recording studio in Redding. Like Feucht, Edwardson and the Beaudoins are heavily connected to Bethel Church.\n\nFeucht pushes misinformation about Redding event\n\nFeucht’s film presented misinformation about key details related to his “Let Us Worship” events. For example, Feucht said he received requests for a “Let Us Worship” show in Redding after he had taken it to several cities in California. In reality, the Redding “Let Us Worship” event was only the third event, after those Feucht held on the Golden Gate Bridge and in Huntington Beach. The Redding event took place under the Sundial Bridge on July 22, 2020.\n\nFeucht said his wife, Kate Feucht, discouraged him from hosting an event in Redding because there had been drama in other cities, and “we did not want to feel that at home”. It is unknown what specific drama the Feuchts claimed to face for his “Let Us Worship” event. At the time of his Redding event, Feucht was still relatively unknown.\n\nNews “hit piece” in Redding?\n\nFeucht claimed the local news did a “hit piece” on him the day after his Redding event; a KRCR story that was picked up by CNN. The KRCR story was not a “hit piece”, but a news story about Feucht’s concert that even included a statement from Feucht.\n\nAfter Feucht discussed the KRCR and CNN news stories, the film cut to a screenshot of A News Cafe publisher Doni Chamberlain’s July 30, 2020 story about the Sundial Bridge event. As Chamberlain reported, Feucht claimed he had been in talks with the mayor of Redding and the city council about whether the event could be held beneath the Sundial Bridge. Chamberlain reported that neither the mayor or city council members granted Feucht permission to conduct his event, but nevertheless, Feucht went ahead with it.\n\nIn defense of his July 2020 event, Feucht said he wanted to “honor” city leaders by encouraging attendees to socially distance and wear masks before the event. That turned out to be a preposterous claim because social distancing was impossible due to the number of people, and just a couple of people (one was a photographer) wore masks. The event was attended by a few thousand people, most of whom were packed in tightly under the Sundial Bridge. A source who attended the event, and asked to remain anonymous, learned after the concert that some people in the crowd had been in contact just days earlier with people who’d tested positive for COVID-19. The source also believed that COVID-was spread at the event.\n\nFeucht fails to share that Bethel Church was his “home church”\n\nIn the film, Feucht said his Redding event “pulled my home church into all this controversy”. He said people wanted to know if his “home church” — which he never named as Bethel Church — was behind him, and if it sponsored the event. Feucht said Bethel did not sponsor the event, but Bethel’s leaders have undeniably supported Feucht since he stopped working there.\n\nFeucht also failed to mention that – as he has shared in the past –he views Bethel Church Senior Leader Bill Johnson and his late wife Beni Johnson as his “spiritual parents”. At the time of the Redding event, Feucht was a worship leader and a musician at Bethel Church.\n\nAfter Sean Feucht’s comments about Redding in the film, Kate Feucht said they received a text message from some unnamed, loved and respected leaders who told the Feuchts that they were disappointed in their actions.\n\n“It broke me,” Kate Feucht said through tears.\n\nThroughout the film the Feuchts were repeatedly characterized as victims; despite the fact that Sean Feucht’s nonprofit made millions of dollars in 2020 alone, and that he has hundreds of thousands of social media followers.\n\nIn one part of the documentary, Kate Feucht recalled how she’d begged her husband to stop with the Let Us Worship events, and that after the Redding event she told him that he was ruining their lives. Sean Feucht, however, refused to stop. Kate Feucht also said she cried all the way from Redding to Los Angeles for the next “Let Us Worship” event.\n\nMisinformation about the Portland event\n\nIn the summer of 2021 Feucht took his “Let Us Worship” roadshow right into downtown Portland where some George Floyd protests still simmered. Although it had been a year since Floyd’s death, Portland was still experiencing periodical unrest during ongoing clashes between Black Lives Matter activists, ANTIFA-identifying protesters and far-right MAGA activists.\n\nBut, in order to make it look as if “violent protesters” attacked Feucht at his event in Portland, he included video footage of an event that did not occur on the same day as his “Let Us Worship” — one that had nothing to do with him. Feucht’s film also included amateur video footage of an attack on far-right Polish-Canadian preacher Artur Pawlowski.\n\nPawlowski is well-known for his homophobic, anti-women’s rights, and anti-COVID-mandates activism. The footage in Feucht’s documentary showed activists attacking Pawlowski with pepper spray and smoke bombs. The footage also showed Pawlowski’s PA system being tipped over and destroyed by activists.\n\n“They actually threw tear gas bombs at a whole family, a lady carrying a baby,” Feucht said. “The baby started choking. They were freaking out.” Feucht did not disclose the truth in that statement; that the incident Feucht described involving the family did not occur at his event.\n\n“That was the first time that I had ever had people rioting us,” said Kate Feucht while the video footage of Pawlowski played on the screen.\n\n“They were yelling and screaming at us,” said Kate Feucht. “Like whole mobs of people would go through the crowd and be screaming with megaphones and threatening to be violent”.\n\nFeucht sugarcoats paramilitary force and Proud Boy connection in Portland\n\nThe section of the film about the Portland event also featured recorded video footage of the paramilitary force that acted as Feucht’s bodyguards. This was after the footage of the attack on Pawlowski that made it appear as if they, too, were activists who showed up to attack Feucht.\n\nAs previously reported by A News Café, Sean Feucht bragged on social media about his paramilitary force of bodyguards in Portland. He posted a picture of himself standing with them on his Facebook page and wrote: “If you mess with them or our 1st amendment right to worship God, you’ll meet Jesus one way or another”.\n\nThe group of men who worked as Feucht’s paramilitary force at the Portland event were part of a tightly connected network of far-right extremist Russian and Ukrainian Americans, as well as Proud Boys outfitted in bulletproof vests, helmets, and other types of military gear.\n\nFeucht said in the film that he did not expect the “level of demonic activity” he confronted in Portland. However, most of the violence that occurred in Portland — during and after the “Let Us Worship” event — came from the hands of Feucht’s own paramilitary force. In one instance, a member of Feucht’s paramilitary force pushed down a woman, without provocation, who’d been standing with her bike near Feucht’s event. Members of Feucht’s paramilitary force were also caught on camera attacking people in downtown Portland after the event.\n\nSean Feucht’s new documentary is packed with far-right Christian nationalist commentary and misinformation. However, those who are unfamiliar with Feucht’s history could watch the film and come away with a positive view of him, thanks to the film’s sugarcoated angle. The film, for instance, failed to include the anti-women’s rights and anti-LGBTQ+ activism Feucht has repeatedly partaken in over the last few years. It also framed him as a modest guy who lives out in the country, rather than a wealthy preacher, musician and grifter who made millions during the pandemic.\n\nMost recently, sometime between the evening of Dec. 31 and New Year’s Eve morning, the City View Church in San Diego was tagged with a large amount of pro-LGBTQ+ and pro-BLM graffiti. On New Year’s Eve morning Feucht jumped onto his various social media accounts to share details about the graffiti. He called the graffiti hateful, and said those who were responsible for it were bigots. Many on such social media platforms as Twitter suggested the possibility that Feucht or his supporters put the graffiti on the church walls as yet another way to drum up more support and donations.\n\nFeucht’s film was short on transparency, but long on narratives that characterized Feucht as a spirit-led musician doing God’s work (while making millions in the process). The documentary was replete with considerable misinformation that presented him as a victim, while omitting his less-Jesus-like money-making schemes, and his far-right paramilitary activism connections.\n\nSince Sean Feucht began his “Let Us Worship” campaign, he has been called by many names: Plague rat. Superspreader. Dollar Store Jesus. Ramen-haired phony.\n\nHowever, Sean Feucht is best known as a far-right, evangelical flim-flam hustler who’s made millions off his hustle. With seemingly no end in sight."
