        "text": "To the editor:\n\nThe GOP’s cry of a ruinous economic record is meant to gaslight you, wanting you to believe something that your eyes, ears and common sense tell you is false. In spite of the GOP’s rhetoric, President Biden seems to know how to govern. Biden has delivered the largest economy recovery plan since Roosevelt, the largest infrastructure plan since Eisenhower, the most judges confirmed since Kennedy, the largest health care bill since Johnson and the largest climate change bill in history. However, our Republican congressman who represents Ohio’s 6th District, Bill Johnson, states in print media and television ads that he is looking out for your well being and stopping the unneeded spending. Spending for what? Biden’s administration is spending it in the right areas.\n\nWe are entering into a “re-shoring” of jobs in this country. More than 350 thousand jobs have been added this year alone in the manufacturing sector with such companies as Black and Decker and Caterpillar, just to name a few. Will the consumer possibly pay more for products because American workers will earn more? Yes, but the supplies and products will be made closer to home, alleviating the supply chain issue.\n\nJohnson has especially denounced Biden’s latest move to curb, and in some cases erase, college loan debt for 30 million borrowers. Unlike debt on other things such as homes, and cars and yachts, college loans cannot disappear by filing bankruptcy. There’s a former president who filed bankruptcy six times I might add. But, who will help the poor student? Joe Biden deferred those payments during the pandemic and again until January, but in order to compromise and pass a bill that is fair, he deferred from going higher with the amount.\n\nHowever, Johnson is once again gaslighting you with fear tactics, such as “you’re being hooked into paying for others’ mistakes … and it’s inflationary.” Even Goldman Sachs indicated this debt reduction won’t increase inflation. I wonder how many locals who attended college to gain a degree to better themselves were caught in this dilemma and are finding it hard to make those monthly payments. How do they feel about Johnson’s rhetoric?\n\nI agree with a number of Democratic representatives who would have liked more in this plan. It’s a good plan, but not an excellent plan. To be an excellent plan, we need to reign in the tuition and fees that colleges add to the cost each year. I like the fact that at least Biden’s plan temporarily reduces the monthly payment to 5 percent of the debtors’ incomes. That may mean a car payment to most people.\n\nMany people who paid off their student loans, before this reprieve came about, are not bitter. Instead, they characterize themselves as being some of the fortunate ones.\n\nIt was the GI bill in 1940s that helped the 1950s flourish. This may go down in the history books as a smart move.\n\nKathy Antinone\n\nSteubenville"
