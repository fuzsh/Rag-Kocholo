        "text": "With nine shows last year, including “All American,” “All American: Homecoming,” “Superman & Lois,” “You” and “Found,” the production company led by Berlanti and Schechter continues to grow. The Berlanti family includes Okoro Carroll, who showruns both “All American” series and created “Found,” and Gamble, who developed, writes and produces “You.”\n\nProducers you most admire?\n\nGamble: Two producers I’ve been behind closed doors with: Greg Berlanti, because I’ve watched him kindly solve issues that many a producer would be tempted to address via murder; and John McNamara, because I’ve watched him fight tirelessly for the people who work for him in ways they’ll never know.\n\nLast show you binged?\n\nBerlanti: “The Crown”\n\nSchechter: I’m binging “Fargo” season 5. Constantly impressed with the originality and quality of this show.\n\nMost anticipated show of 2024?\n\nOkoro Carroll: “The Diplomat” Season 2\n\nABC’s breakout hit sitcom “Abbott Elementary” took home three Emmys in 2022 and landed eight more nominations for its second season. With Brunson as creator, writer and star, the series has continued to be the strongest broadcast comedy of the year. In addition to “Abbott,” Halpern and Schumacker continue to executive produce Max’s “Harley Quinn,” with its fourth season airing in 2023.\n\nProducers you most admire?\n\nBrunson and Einhorn: Norman Lear Schumacker: Lucille Ball. You try making 30-plus episodes per season of a genius sitcom classic and also produce the original “Star Trek.” Undefeated.\n\nLast show you binged?\n\nHalpern: Final season of “Better Call Saul.” I end up getting to everything about a year late but because I never engage in meaningful conversations with other humans nothing ever gets spoiled\n\nfor me.\n\nMost anticipated show of 2024?\n\nBrunson and Einhorn: “Severance”\n\nAmazon Freevee’s “Jury Duty,” co-created by Eisenberg with Heller as showrunner, is one of the biggest surprise hits of the past year: In maybe the most 2023 sentence of all time, the show took off after going viral on TikTok and landed four Emmy nominations. Eisenberg also created “Lessons in Chemistry” for Apple TV+, serving as an EP and writer.\n\nLast show you binged?\n\nEisenberg: I’ve been tearing through a “Mad Men” rewatch; even better the second time around.\n\nHeller: “Slow Horses”\n\nCreated by Bos and Thureen, Max’s “Somebody Somewhere” — which was inspired by the life of star and exec producer Everett — returned for its touching second season and has already been renewed for a third. With compassionate yet hilarious takes, the series has been a breakout since\n\nits debut.\n\nMost anticipated show of 2024?\n\nEverett: “The Regime”\n\nProducer you admire most?\n\nThureen: Carolyn Strauss — brilliant, accomplished and kind.\n\nLast show you binged?\n\nBos: “Love Has Won: The Cult of Mother God”\n\nBest friends Fielder and Safdie took their relationship to the next level when they created Paramount+’s satirical black comedy “The Curse,” which they also star in alongside Emma Stone. Fielder, who was named one of Time’s most influential people this year, also served as an executive producer on HBO’s “How to With John Wilson,” which aired its final season over the summer.\n\nProducer you admire most?\n\nSafdie: Jim Brooks just because he’s a visionary and he’s great.\n\nHorror producer, writer and director Flanagan created his latest series, “The Fall of the House of Usher,” alongside his business partner, executive producer Macy. Produced under their Intrepid Pictures banner, the series is loosely based on the works of Edgar Allen Poe.\n\nLast show you binged?\n\nFlanagan: The last show I watched was “Gen V,” but I didn’t binge it — I think the binge model is a problem, and it really needs to go away.\n\nMacy: Oddly the last show I watched was also “Gen V,” but I haven’t finished it yet.\n\nFor decades, Goldsman has been making a statement with his work; after all, he wrote the screenplay for “A Beautiful Mind.” In 2023, he launched “The Crowded Room” on Apple TV+, executive producing the series, inspired by the 1981 novel “The Minds of Billy Milligan,” alongside star Tom Holland. Plus, he’s the co-creator “Star Trek: Strange New Worlds,” which just aired its second season.\n\nLast show you binged?\n\n“The Lazarus Project,” my favorite reality shifting show since “Devs.”\n\nThe minds behind “Barry” — Hader, Berg and Rodgers — all bring something different to the table, which may be why the HBO series wrapped up in such a unique series finale. For the first time, star and co-creator Hader directed all eight episodes. “Barry” amassed 55 Emmy nominations over its run, with 11 of those for its fourth and final season.\n\nLast show you binged?\n\nHader: “The Murder Tapes”\n\nProducer you admire most?\n\nRodgers: I adore Sarah Esberg. She has the most amazing taste, and she is a fabulous human.\n\nMost anticipated show of 2024?\n\nHader: I don’t know. I just know I don’t want to be on “The Murder Tapes.”\n\nAfter her “To All the Boys” YA books were turned into hit films, Han has taken a big swing on television, adapting her hit “The Summer I Turned Pretty” book series into an Amazon Prime Video series that viewers can’t get enough of. The second season dropped and became one of the Top 10 most-watched shows on the platform. Plus, she’s one of the few producers to feature multiple Taylor Swift hits in her show.\n\nLast show you binged?\n\n“Upload”\n\nOne of the most beloved series without any Emmy awards, “Reservation Dogs” came to an end this year at FX after three seasons. Co-created by Harjo and Waititi, the touching, dramatic comedy series featured all Indigenous writers and directors — the first American television show to do so. As Harjo will continue to work with FX under his overall deal, Waititi also serves as an exec producer on Max’s “Our Flag Means Death.”\n\nLast show you binged?\n\nHarjo: “Fargo” Season 5\n\nMost anticipated show of 2024?\n\nHarjo: “The British Bake-Off”\n\nAs the creator and writer of FX’s “Fargo,” Hawley has continued to rake in the awards attention — and deservedly so. The series, which has earned 55 nominations since its 2014 debut, launched its fifth installment with a new cast of A-list actors in front of the camera. While best-known for “Fargo,” Hawley will be a bit busy in 2024 with a different project — the “Alien” television series at FX.\n\nMost anticipated show of 2024?\n\n“True Detective”\n\nCo-created by Hoffman and Martin and exec produced by Fogelman, Hulu’s “Only Murders in the Building” had its biggest season yet with Paul Rudd and Meryl Streep joining the already incredible cast — which includes Martin, Martin Short and Selena Gomez. Since the strike created holes in the broadcast schedule, the Hulu hit is airing on broadcast for the first time this year.\n\nProducers you admire most?\n\nHoffman: Deep tie between Normal Lear and James L. Brooks.\n\nLast show you binged?\n\nFogelman: My wife and I are back into “Happy Valley.” We’d devoured the first season but honestly didn’t know there were second and third seasons until recently and dove back in. Sarah Lancashire is off the charts, every moment of every episode.\n\nAlthough Peacock has struggled to make a splash overall, “Poker Face” did not. The new take on “Columbo,” created by Johnson, is produced by Bergman and Lyonne, the latter of whom leads the case-of-the-week series. “Poker Face” landed four Emmy noms.\n\nProducers you admire most?\n\nLyonne: It’s hard in this moment not to immediately think of the beloved Norman Lear and for good reason — what a sweeping impact and beautiful human being.\n\nFisher, who has an overall deal with Universal Television, served as “Never Have I Ever” showrunner alongside co-creator and executive producer Kaling. The fourth and final season remained on Netflix’s Top 10 chart for multiple weeks in 2023. Together, Fisher and Kaling focused on diversifying both the cast and crew.\n\nProducer you admire most?\n\nKaling: Tyler Perry. His voice is clear, his work ethic is unmatched, and he is unbelievably generous.\n\nMost anticipated show of 2024?\n\nFisher: I really can’t wait for the second season of “Severance.” They ended on such a crazy cliffhanger. I’m eager to see how that world changes and evolves and what other weird places are in that building. Remember that room of baby goats?\n\n“The Boys,” developed by Kripke, continues to be one of Amazon Prime Video’s top series, with its third season being viewed for more than 1 billion minutes. Kripke continues to expand the universe: the college-set spinoff “Gen V,” showrun by Fazekas, launched in 2023 and was almost immediately renewed for a second season.\n\nProducer you admire most?\n\nKripke: Rod Serling by a mile. He basically invented the notion of using genre TV to explore difficult issues. He was vocally anti-war and anti-racist [in the 1950s] and on top of it all, his scripts were intimidatingly great.\n\nLast show you binged?\n\nFazekas: In the middle of binging “For All Mankind” after my writing staff raved about it so much — LOVE IT.\n\nThe writer, director and exec producer is never working on just one project at his production company, Secret Hideout, with his team and fellow producer Aaron Baiers. In 2023, new seasons of Kurtzman co-creations “Star Trek: Strange New Worlds” and “Star Trek: Picard” dropped while the next season of “Star Trek: Discovery” is set for 2024. During its final season, “Picard” managed to pull off an epic “Star Trek: The Next Generation” reunion.\n\nKurtzman is also an exec producer on the upcoming Sundance title, Rob Peace, which he produces under his banner, 25 Stories.\n\nMost anticipated show of 2024?\n\n“The Brothers Sun.” Someone should build a museum to Michelle Yeoh.\n\nLawrence is easily one of the busiest men in the business — and surrounds himself with the same. In 2023, the (probably) final season of “Ted Lasso,” the Apple TV+ series, which he produces alongside co-creator and star Sudeikis, debuted and went on to receive 21 Emmy noms. Goldstein both wrote for the show and starred in it; during that process, he and Lawrence, along with Segel, came up with the idea for Apple TV+’s “Shrinking,” which perfectly blended themes of loss and hope\n\nwith comedy.\n\nProducers you admire most?\n\nGoldstein: David Milch. Responsible for some amazing TV series but will always get my vote for “Deadwood,” a stone-cold masterpiece written with a voice like no other.\n\nLast show you binged?\n\nSegel: “The Fall of the House of Usher”\n\nBefore he hung out with Taylor Swift and got to work on “Deadpool 3,” and in between producing duties on “Stranger Things,” Levy exec produced and directed all four episodes of Netflix’s “All the Light We Cannot See,” a miniseries about two teenagers whose paths cross during World War II.\n\nMost anticipated show of 2024?\n\n“The Last of Us” second season. Is that coming out in 2024? Can we ask Craig Mazin to work faster? Because the world and I NEED IT.\n\nThe sitcom king himself, Lorre launched his first series at Max this year with “Bookie,” co-created by Nick Bakay. It immediately made headlines as Lorre surprisingly reunited with “Two & a Half Men” star Charlie Sheen. Lorre knows it’s all about building a fanbase, something he perfected with “Big Bang Theory” prequel “Young Sheldon,” which aired its sixth season in 2023; the upcoming seventh will be its last. Additionally, his groundbreaking comedy “Bob Hearts Abishola” will air one final season this year.\n\nLast show you binged?\n\n“The Crown”\n\nBefore the second season of “Yellowjackets” dropped on the ever-changing Showtime, the twisty series was renewed for a third season. Lyle and Nickerson, who showrun alongside Lisco, have so much story to tell — and have multiple storylines to do so — that the series could continue for many years to come.\n\nLast show you binged?\n\nLyle: “The Amazing Race.” I’m going to start a training regimen this year in the hopes of fulfilling my dream of being a contestant someday. This accidentally answers the second question because Mike White is the producer I admire most; not only do I love his writing, but he’s been on “Survivor” AND “Amazing Race.” Goals!\n\nLisco: “Devs”\n\nProducers you admire most?\n\nNickerson: George Meyer. I will never be able to express the extent to which “The Simpsons” shaped not only my sensibility but also the way I see the world. And reading about the approach of the secret comedy genius credited with “thoroughly” shaping the voice of the show, I think, helped me learn to approach my own work with a sense of profound seriousness. Even when attempting to make something that was first and foremost meant to be fun, which is always.\n\nWith his animated comedies “Family Guy” and “American Dad!” continuing their long runs — in Season 22 and Season 21, respectively — MacFarlane isn’t slowing down. In addition to new seasons of the above airing, he worked on the TV adaptation of “Ted,” debuting this month on Peacock.\n\nMost anticipated show of 2024?\n\nWell, I spent most of the last year making “Ted,” so I can’t wait to watch it if someone loans me their Peacock password.\n\nWhen Mancini created “Child’s Play” in 1988, little did he know he’d still be “working” with Chucky 36 years later. He now serves as showrunner on the Syfy/USA Network series “Chucky” — the third season dropped in October — alongside exec producers Kirschner, Antosca and Hedlund. Plus, the latter two have a big year ahead with “Cape Fear” in the works.\n\nProducers you admire most?\n\nKirschner: Norman Lear has influenced me the most, as I lived for any of his shows growing up and he was instrumental in helping me bring my first feature film, “An American Tail,” to Steven Spielberg. Antosca: Rod Serling\n\nMost anticipated show of 2024?\n\nMancini: I was praying for “The Gilded Age” to get a Season 3, if only for the hats.\n\nHedlund: I’m looking forward to more “Chucky” of course!”\n\nSeven years after co-creating “The OA,” Marling and Batmanglij returned with an entirely new world: FX’s miniseries “A Murder at the End of the World,” starring Emma Corrin. Together, the pair took turns writing and directing each episode of the thriller, which follows an amateur detective trying to solve a murder while on a retreat.\n\nProducer you admire most?\n\nBatmanglij: Ryan Murphy, Russell T. Davies and Alan Ball\n\nMost anticipated show of 2024?\n\nMarling: “Feud: Capote vs. The Swans.” I would also love a “PEN15” Season 3 … I know it’s not in the cards, but a woman can dream.\n\nEach time a new season of Morgan’s “The Crown” drops on Netflix, it begins trending on social media and tops Netflix’s Top 10 charts week after week. Although the penultimate season wasn’t the most popular, the historical drama returned with its final season — which included the death of Princess Diana — split into two parts. Morgan, who wrote (or co-wrote) every episode of the final season, continues his deal with Netflix, so stay tuned to see what’s next.\n\nProducer you admire most?\n\nThe people that made me want to do what I do: David Chase, Jimmy McGovern and Yulian Semyonov.\n\nWhen Amazon Prime Video’s “Swarm” dropped, viewers didn’t know what to expect. The story of a young girl obsessed with a pop star stood out from the competition thanks to creators Nabers and Glover. The series earned three Emmy nominations in a successful follow-up for both of them after six years of “Atlanta.” Glover will next star in Prime’s “Mr. and Mrs. Smith.”\n\nLast show you binged?\n\nNabers: “1883.” I loved every second of it\n\nThe fourth season of Apple TV+’s “For All Mankind” began streaming late last year and ended up on most top TV of 2023 lists. It was co-created by Wolpert, Nedivi and Ronald D. Moore; Nedivi and Wolpert have also written all of the seasons’ finales. The pair have worked together for years — previously on three seasons of “Fargo,” “American Crime Story: The People v. O.J. Simpson” and\n\n“Umbrella Academy.”\n\nLast show you binged?\n\nWolpert: “Deadwood” Season 1, for the fifth time.\n\nMost anticipated show of 2024?\n\nNedivi: “Masters of the Air”\n\nSome of the buzziest shows of the year came from the team at Hello Sunshine. Amazon Prime Video’s “Daisy Jones & the Six,” an adaptation of Taylor Jenkins Reid’s novel, earned nine Emmy nominations, with both Neustadters and Witherspoon exec producing. Lauren Neustadter and Witherspoon also served as exec producers on Apple TV+’s “The Last Thing He Told Me,” Hulu’s “Tiny Beautiful Things” and Apple TV+’s “The Morning Show.”\n\nMost anticipated show of 2024?\n\nL. Neustadter: “Palm Royale.” Kristen Wiig AND Laura Dern?! Heaven.\n\nLast show you binged?\n\nS. Neustadter: “Love Has Won” on Max. I love me some cult documentaries.\n\nAfter writing “My Policeman” last year, it’s no surprise that Nyswaner followed it up with a project that landed him on this list. In his historical romance “Fellow Travelers,” Nyswaner tells the story of a decades-long volatile romance that began at the height of the Lavender Scare of the 1950s.\n\nLast show you binged?\n\nWhen I returned home from Toronto, where I’d shot “Fellow Travelers,” I started at the very beginning of “Succession” and binged all four seasons in a week — it was wonderful living inside the complicated minds of those characters and experiencing the brilliant architecture of one of the greatest television series of all time\n\nWith two critically acclaimed seasons of “Harlem,” creator Oliver and exec producer Poehler found a poignant, fresh way to tell the story of four college best friends now venturing into life, living in the upper Manhattan neighborhood. Additionally, Poehler serves as co-host and exec producer on Peacock’s “Baking It.”\n\nProducer you admire most?\n\nPoehler: Norman Lear.\n\nOliver: I have two! For me as a Black female creator, Shonda Rhimes has always been the GOAT. I was in college when “Grey’s” came out. When I learned a Black woman was behind this massive hit, it altered the course of my life. That was when I first started to take writing seriously. Two is Amy Poehler. Amy has been such a gracious mentor for me. She bet on me and our show, “Harlem,” even before “Girls Trip” came out. She saw something in me early on and was willing to throw her weight behind me. I’m deeply appreciative to Amy for betting on me. Throughout the years, I’ve been so incredibly inspired by her Virgo work ethic and how she actually attends meetings AND comes to set to play Justin Bieber’s “Peaches” to lighten the mood. Amy and “Peaches” are both delightful.\n\nIt’s not easy to follow up “Sex and the City,” but somehow, King did just that with “And Just Like That.” The second season, in fact, earned much better reviews than the first, with the core women — and yes, it even had a Samantha cameo — finding their rhythm once again.\n\nLast show you binged?\n\nThe current season of “What We Do in the Shadows.” I love its daring storytelling sense and it is consistently a delight.\n\nWith more than 11 million viewers per episode across linear and streaming, CBS’ “Ghosts,” adapted by showrunners Port and Wiseman, continues to break through and reach new audiences.\n\nLast show you binged?\n\nPort: “The Gilded Age,” which I thoroughly enjoyed. On “Ghosts,” it’s one of the time periods we lampoon the most, because it has so many parallels to our own, and because Rebecca Wisocky, who plays our gilded age ghost, is so hilarious.\n\nMost anticipated show of 2024?\n\nWiseman: “Masters of the Air.” I loved “Band of Brothers” and “The Pacific,” and I can’t wait to see this next chapter.\n\nIn 2023, Rhimes and Beers continued their success with “Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story” debuting at No. 1 on Netflix. It re-upped the popularity of “Bridgerton,” which will return in 2024 with its third season. While she’s now based at Netflix, Rhimes’ ABC series continued to see success last year: “Grey’s Anatomy,” run by Vernoff, aired its 19th season with “Station 19” airing its sixth. The latter will end in 2024.\n\nLast show you binged?\n\nVernoff: “Colin From Accounts” — it is funny and sexy and smart and romantic, and made me laugh out loud every episode.\n\nStoudt came into “The Morning Show” as the new showrunner after two seasons had been completed — and did not hold back. The third season, which tackled everything from space travel and Elon Musk-like storylines to the Capitol attacks on Jan. 6, earned more Critics Choice nominations than any other TV show in 2023.\n\nMost anticipated show of 2024?\n\n“The Penguin.” Colin Farrell vs. Cristin Milioti. Yes, please.\n\nBest Day Ever, the production company founded by Tigelaar and Silverman, created Hulu’s “Tiny Beautiful Things,” the critically acclaimed 2023 miniseries starring Kathryn Hahn and Merritt Weaver, based on the 2012 book by Cheryl Strayed.\n\nLast show you binged?\n\nSilverman: Over the strike, I rewatched all 156 episodes of “The Good Wife.” Even the second time around, Will’s death hit me hard, I am still in mourning.\n\nProducer you most admire?\n\nTigelaar: Mike White. I think he’s a visionary who has held true to himself and been unchanged by his success. I met him decades ago when we both worked on “Dawson’s Creek,” and he is the exact same person now that he was then. Be it writing, acting, directing or producing, he isn’t afraid to tell powerful, painful, ugly and beautiful truths about what it means to be human. Bonus, he was on “Survivor” and “The Amazing Race,” a real fave in my house."
