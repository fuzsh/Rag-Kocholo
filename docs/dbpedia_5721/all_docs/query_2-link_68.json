        "text": "DEAR EDITOR:\n\nThe Vindicator reported that the YSU trustees, by a vote of 8-1, offered the presidency of Youngstown State University to Bill Johnson, the sitting six-term congressman from Marietta.\n\nThis is stunning news.\n\nJohnson, whose career has spanned over 20 years in the Air Force, some time in the private sector, and 12 years in the House of Representatives, has no experience in academia. His level of education is a master’s degree.\n\nYSU, our university, is the cradle of higher education in the Mahoning Valley, with over 11,000 students. As with most universities, it is the home for learning, but also the home for the exchange of ideas, acceptance of facts as real and toleration of others’ ideas.\n\nAs president, Johnson would be the face of YSU. He comes from a political background where book banning is accepted, women are not in control of their bodies, immigrants are feared and different cultures and religions are denigrated.\n\nJohnson himself was one of 147 Republicans that refused to accept the results of the 2020 election by voting against the Electoral College results. He did this even after fleeing the House chamber when a mob stormed the Capitol.\n\nJohnson is also dubious of climate change, since he is an outspoken advocate for more coal and natural gas exploration.\n\nI think this is hardly the right choice for the presidency of a university, our university, YSU.\n\nFRANK WANAT\n\nPoland"
