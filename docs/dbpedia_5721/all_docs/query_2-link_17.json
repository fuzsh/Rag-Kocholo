        "text": "DEAR EDITOR:\n\nAfter nearly two weeks of relentless attacks on Rep. Bill Johnson, I feel compelled to raise my voice in support of the recent announcement for the congressman to lead YSU, from the perspective of a former staffer, a lifetime resident of the Mahoning Valley, an executive committee member of the Youngstown Regional Chamber, and most importantly, a working mother of two.\n\nWhen Congressman Johnson hired me, I was a few months away from the birth of my first child. Bill Johnson promoted and empowered me to be a leader within his office, teaching and inspiring me to be the business leader I am today. At the same time, he was mindful and supportive while I was a new mother.\n\nHe has put women in leadership roles throughout his entire career in Congress. To the critics who claim he is not “academic” or fit to lead with diversity in mind, I can tell you firsthand that claim is simply groundless. Over the years, Bill Johnson has led countless young people to become successful in both the public and private sectors — some even serve in the Ohio Statehouse today!\n\nBill Johnson believed in us. He believed in what we could achieve. And it’s his endless hope, guidance and leadership that makes him the best choice to lead Youngstown State University.\n\nJACKIE STEWART\n\nCanfield"
