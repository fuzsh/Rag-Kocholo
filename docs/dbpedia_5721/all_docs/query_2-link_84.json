        "text": "Update: Bill Johnson died on Thursday, Jan. 21, 2016\n\nThe man who lives at the end of the second-floor hallway, Room 48, of the Regency Gresham Skilled Nursing and Rehabilitation Facility, is locked onto me with the only good eye he has left. He has a brain injury. There have been strokes, too. He's lost the ability to speak. His left eyelid is shut. And we are alone.\n\nBill Johnson has his mouth open.\n\nHe'd like me to feed him.\n\nOn the table in front of the 1984 Olympic men's alpine ski gold medalist there are laminated cards with basic commands printed on them: \"CALL MY MOM,\" and \"I NEED A DRINK.\" There is another with the alphabet printed on it.\n\nA small bowl of candy is there. A glass of water with a straw sits beside it. That alphabet is waiting for me to run my finger over its letters and for the man who once blistered down the mountain on skis to muster a nod when I land on the character he wants. Johnson looks at me with that steel-blue eye and he waits for me to spell with him.\n\n\"F.\"\n\nWhen I arrived at the nursing home at hour earlier, I found Johnson downstairs, sitting in his motorized wheelchair, frustrated, waiting to go outside for the daily 4 p.m. smoke break. I apologized for not visiting sooner, for being one of many who mostly think of him once every four years when the Winter Olympics are on. He broke into a smile, and nodded.\n\nIn 2010, before the Vancouver Games, I drove up the mountain to visit Johnson a half dozen times at his mobile home in Zig Zag. I visited with him as he shuffled around with a cane, telling stories through slurred words. He showed me his gold medal in the garage, but refused to put it on. He sat in front of the television, smoking pot, and telling me that he only made his comeback at 40 because he thought winning another Olympic medal would bring his ex-wife and children back.\n\nJohnson's wife did not come back. His children, two boys, grew up in California, playing sports and going to their high school proms without him there to take their photograph. Johnson's comeback ended, as you may remember, in 2001 with the skier slamming his head against the side of a mountain in a horrific training-run accident in Montana.\n\nJohnson does not remember any of it. When people tell him about the crash, losing control, his body hurling forward, end over end, like a loose jackhammer tumbling down the slope, it's all big blank. As if it happened to someone else.\n\n\"Maybe the brain has a way of protecting itself,\" he told me in 2010.\n\nThere have been television documentaries done on Johnson's life. There have been rumors that he's on life support, and near death, especially after a major stroke he suffered after the last Winter Olympics. But he's none of these things. On Friday, Johnson is on the patio of the nursing home, smoking a Marlboro cigarette through a long rubber tube stained black from tar. He's wearing an Olympic baseball cap.\n\nPaula, a fellow resident, says, \"Bill wants a cigarette as much as all of us.\"\n\nJohnson smokes two, his limit. Then, a nursing-home employee takes his smoking bib off, places his left hand on the joystick of his wheelchair and Johnson races back through the door, slaloming and winding down a long hallway back toward his room, with me chasing.\n\nBill's mother, DB Johnson-Cooper, told me on Thursday that her son's mind is fine, but his body is gone. Only that left hand cooperates, albeit inconsistently.\n\n\"Some days he can move his scooter chair around. Other days he can't,\" she said. \"We don't know why.\"\n\nMom visits daily, but with medical bills and a small Medicaid check every month, she has a business to run. The receptionist said Johnson doesn't get many visitors. A man from out of state called last week, asking if someone might hold the telephone to his ear. He was a skier, too, who also suffered a brain injury.\n\n\"He wanted to preach to Bill,\" DB said. \"A couple of days before that we got a huge box full of goodies that had pictures of Bill in frames. It had candy in it too. Bill loves candy so it was very appropriate.\"\n\nBack in Johnson's room, we settle in and he wants to watch the Olympics coverage from Sochi. The women's 15km biathlon is on, and Johnson's eye follows a pair of Eastern European women competing for the gold. He looks lost in the competition. I ask him if he ever wanted to cross country ski, or stop halfway down a ski run and fire a rifle. He shakes his head.\n\n\"You only wanted to go fast?\" I ask.\n\nJohnson smiles and nods.\n\n\"O.\"\n\nWe have two letters now. I wonder where \"FO...\" will take us. I wonder if Johnson wants food. Or if Johnson, who can be crass, is telling me to get lost. I watch his mouth, waiting for him to speak, as he did in 2010, when he called Bode Miller \"a boy who skis,\" or when he told me once of his competitors in Sarajevo, \"I got under their skin, which is 100-percent of the battle.\"\n\nI wait for Johnson. He wants more letters.\n\nThere's an email printed out and taped on the wall of his room from one of his sons, Tyler. The son watched a documentary about his father's career recently and wrote to say that he now, \"understands what life was like for dad before and after the accident.\"\n\nTyler wonders if his grandmother might call two nights a week, and hold the telephone to his father's ear. I read the letter, and tell Johnson that it must have made him feel really good to hear that his son wants to connect. He smiles and nods. Beside the letter is a photograph of another son, shirtless, posing beside an American flag. Johnson's son has an Olympic tattoo near his heart matching the one Johnson got after winning his gold medal.\n\nOn Friday, we spelled words together and communicated. He smiled when I asked him if he ever thought H-A-N-G-M-A-N would become his life. I asked the first American man to win an Olympic alpine gold medal if he was happy. Bill Johnson nodded. Most days, those around him say he is. But especially around the Olympics, which he watches day and night on television.\n\n\"Also, we get out for dinner once a week,\" his mother said.\n\nIf anyone asks, tell them Johnson is alive. He's here, in Room 48, or maybe out on a smoke break. He's waiting for your letters. He's watching television. He's here, if you remember him, or care to visit, especially not in an Olympic year.\n\n\"I think he's just happy people still remember him,\" his mother said.\n\nJohnson's health is just fine, she says. An occupational therapist works with him daily, trying to hold onto the little range of motion he has in that left hand. I feed Johnson crackers, and break a chocolate bar in pieces for him while we watch the Olympics.\n\nThat task?\n\nSpelling that one word he wanted so badly to convey to me?\n\nAfter \"F\" and \"O\" we find \"U,\" then \"R,\" on Johnson's chart. F-O-U-R. Four what? His eye is trained on the tabletop, and I see what the most fearless American downhill skier who ever lived wants now. There is a raisin, a peanut, and two jelly beans on the table top. Four little bits.\n\n\"All four at once?\" I ask.\n\nHe nods, and opens his mouth."
