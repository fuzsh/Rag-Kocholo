        "text": "I met Deborah Edmisten a few years ago at a writers’ group, and while we didn’t become instant friends, I’m glad to say that our friendship has grown with my renewed attendance at the group. We were participants at an author event recently, where we had time to speak more personally, and I read three of her books, which I thoroughly enjoyed. That was when I knew I had to share this wonderful, talented woman of faith with my followers. Without further ado, I’d like to introduce Deborah Edmisten.\n\nTell me a little bit about yourself.\n\nI’ve been married to my best friend for thirty-five years, I’m the mother of three sons and one daughter, a mother-in-law to three incredible individuals, and grandma to five unique and wonderful grandchildren. I was saved by the Lord in my early 20s; a miracle I’m grateful for every single day of my life.\n\nI grew up in Akron for the first ten years of my life before my family moved to Canal Fulton when I was in fourth grade. I’ve lived in the Northeast Ohio area the entirety of my life except for a three-year-stint in Jacksonville, Florida, for my husband’s job with Goodyear.\n\nWe have an amazing church family which we cherish. We’ve been with them for twenty-two years, and we’ve experienced both tragedy and joy together. It’s a gift to have that kind of a bond with a group of people, and we don’t take that for granted.\n\nWhat has your experience been?\n\nI had several different jobs before I became a stay-at-home mom after the birth of our first child. Camera sales, bank teller, office clerk at a wholesale seafood company, receptionist, and then administrative assistant at a financial services company.\n\nRegarding training and my writing, this may make you laugh, but I’ve had absolutely no training in writing other than high-school creative writing classes and some mentoring in my early twenties from Sharon Mondragon, the author of The Unlikely Yarn of the Dragon Lady. I attended a Midwest Writers Workshop at Kent State Stark with Sharon in the late 80s. That is the extent of my training in the field of writing.\n\nDid your work experience lead to the pursuit of writing? If not, please expound upon what led to your decision to write.\n\nNo, my work experience didn’t lead to the pursuit of writing. I knew from a young age that I wanted to be a writer. My fourth grade Christmas list (that I still have) verifies this; I asked for reams of paper so I could become a writer. Though I wrote poetry and short stories during and after high school, my dream of writing didn’t come to true fruition until I lost my mom in 2005. For some reason, her passing caused me to have a “now or never” moment, and I dove in and have been writing ever since.\n\nHow did you develop your passion for writing?\n\nI guess I would say that I didn’t develop a passion for writing, rather, it developed in me through my passion for reading. From a very young age, I found books to be absolutely magical, and that view into other worlds between the pages of books gave me a profound desire to write.\n\nWhat or who is your inspiration?\n\nWow, this is such a tough one to answer! There are so many authors I read growing up and in adulthood who shaped my worldview and birthed in me a desire to write.\n\nTo name a few of them: L.M. Montgomery, Agatha Christie, Dorothy L. Sayers, Wilson Rawls, E.B. White, Fern Michaels (Mary Ruth Kuczir), Jane Austen, Charles Dickens, John Bunyan, C.S. Lewis, and John Newton, to name a few.\n\nDo you put yourself into your writing?\n\nElements of myself are in some of the characters I’ve created, but I haven’t modeled any one character solely on me.\n\nAbout which subjects do you enjoy writing?\n\nI enjoy writing about subjects that are meaningful and cause people to reflect deeply on many of the challenges that we encounter in life. Some of the topics I’ve incorporated into my books are domestic abuse, alcoholism, slavery, the Underground Railroad, anxiety, suicide, marrying a person who doesn’t share your faith, human trafficking, immigration, etc.\n\nI enjoy the challenge of creating a story that tackles tough topics but is also entertaining.\n\nWhat does your writing process involve? What’s your routine?\n\nI used to write early in the morning at our dining room table, but after going through an intense season of anxiety and severe sleep deprivation in late 2021 and into 2022, my routine has changed. I’m not sure why, but now I do better with writing in the evening in my husband’s home office where we relax in the evening. Life is strange like that, isn’t it? I don’t write every day, though; I write when an idea comes to me, so that makes my writing sporadic.\n\nHave you been featured in a magazine or other publication?\n\nMy middle-grade and tween books have been featured in several different editions of Story Monsters Ink magazine; a prestigious magazine and valuable resource for teachers, librarians, and parents when looking for quality teen and children’s books.\n\nI’ve also been featured on a few author blogs – which is always fun!\n\nIn which contests have you competed? What awards have you won?\n\nI’ve entered the Story Monsters Approved contest, The Purple Dragonfly Book Awards, and the Royal Dragonfly Book Awards. My tween time-travel series won the Story Monsters Approved seal of approval and my middle-grade books have won honorable mentions in both the Purple Dragonfly and Royal Dragonfly book awards. All three contests are prestigious and reputable, and I feel very blessed to have received recognition for my work from these contests.\n\nDo you write for people (professionally or personally?) How does a client contact you?\n\nMy In Time series was written at the request of the children of a good friend of mine, but other than happily complying with that request, I haven’t written for anyone else professionally or personally. I’ve done some editing for fellow writers, but not professionally. Being a busy grandma, I’m not sure I’d have the time to write for others, so I doubt I would venture into something like that at this point in my life.\n\nWhat’s your favorite story that you’ve written?\n\nFrom a spiritual standpoint, my favorite book is Many Waters. I think it deals with profound issues of faith in an honest and real way, and that’s very satisfying as a writer.\n\nThe Red Dress is probably my next favorite. It deals with topics near and dear to my heart. In many ways, it’s a rough read, but the reality of history is often difficult to dissect, but that process is still necessary.\n\nWhat’s your dream story to write/writing project?\n\nI think it would be incredibly fun to write a play and see it performed on stage.\n\nWhat’s one aspect about writing that you absolutely love?\n\nI love seeing new worlds come to life and how connected I feel to my characters; the good and the bad. I love that my characters often tell me which direction they want to go, despite what I thought should or would happen to them. That aspect of writing is so rewarding.\n\nWhat’s your biggest complaint with writing?\n\nThat I’m not as prolific as I wish I could be. In the writing world, I’m considered a Pantser – a writer who writes from “the seat of their pants” as they’re inspired opposed to a writer who outlines extensively before starting a writing project. I have to wait for ideas and storylines to form in my mind, and that isn’t necessarily always a quick process.\n\nWould you like to work full-time as a writer? If so, how do you envision this occurring?\n\nAll things considered, probably not. This wouldn’t be true of all writers, but I believe for me, writing full-time would deplete my creativity and make the writing process burdensome.\n\nDo you write alone or in collaboration with another writer? Have you ever been part of an anthology?\n\nI write alone. Being a Pantser, I’m not sure what a collaboration would look like, but never say never, right?\n\nYes, a short story of mine was included in the anthology, In Review: The Eclectic Works of The Write Stuff Authors Group and an essay in the anthology In Conclusion: The Eclectic Works of The Write Stuff Authors Group.\n\nWhere can someone find you online? Do you have a website?\n\nYou can find my website at Nothing Hidden\n\nI’m on Facebook at Deborah Edmisten, Author\n\nYou can also find me on Instagram @deborahedmistenauthor\n\nEnjoy this post featuring another talented artist who helped make the Realm book launch celebration memorable. I discovered Madeline at the Hartville Flea Market, where I picked up her card because I was impressed with a young woman working the forge. After perusing her website, I knew she could make a pendant that would be a perfect depiction of something a character in my novel would create and wear.\n\nTell me a little bit about yourself.\n\nMy name is Madeline. I am a 19-year-old female artist. I enjoy creating things, whether it be digital art or traditional art, crochet, and writing. My passions are blacksmithing and knifemaking.\n\nWhat has your experience been?\n\nI’ve been a blacksmith/bladesmith for almost seven years now. I’ve apprenticed under Lockhart Ironworks and Maple Wood Forge. I’ve won awards in Southern Ohio Forge & Anvil’s Quadstate Gallery and am constantly learning from other makers.\n\nDo you put yourself into your forging?\n\nI try to do my best with everything I make. A lot of experience, trial and error, and problem-solving goes into just knowing how to do a simple scroll or taper, even more so how to do it well or quickly. I don’t always succeed how I’d like on the first try, but how I deal with that is also a culmination of patience and a willingness to try again.\n\nDid your work experience lead to the pursuit of metalworking?\n\nBlacksmithing is the first job I’ve ever really had. I’ve always liked to create things, and the opportunity to learn how to be a blacksmith has been incredible. Something to note is how blacksmithing is the core of so many other fields, and it creates a base knowledge for many other crafts, like welding, farrier work, copper or silver work, jewelry, knifemaking, and many more. I get to explore outward with each new project I try.\n\nHow did you develop your passion for metalworking?\n\nI’ve always loved art and helping others, and I never really felt intimidated by the fact that not many young women are blacksmiths. When I was around age twelve, my school had an assignment encouraging us to find someone we could shadow for a day in a job that we liked. I chose blacksmithing. My parents were incredibly supportive even through the difficulty of finding one. I was welcomed into one of Doug Lockhart’s beginner classes and started an apprenticeship soon afterward. I continue to learn and grow in gratitude for my craft each time I pick up the hammer.\n\nWhat or who is your inspiration?\n\nMy family and friends have always been my biggest support. They’ve allowed my interest in this to thrive into a business and continue to be there for me throughout everything. My mentors and the blacksmithing community, their history, and their dedication to the craft are wonderful inspirations as well. In the past year, my unofficial fiancé has been a great motivator especially since he shares my craft, albeit more on the bladesmithing side of things. His own dreams, aspirations, and his unending support are wonderful, and I hope we can continue to help each other far into the future.\n\nWhat do you enjoy creating?\n\nI love figuring out new things. A good portion of what I sell is of my own design and took many tries to get right. Complex projects always push me forward and give reasons as to why I love blacksmithing. Some of these projects are trivets, scissors, bourbon glass holders, and folding knives.\n\nWhere can someone find you online?\n\nYou can find me on Instagram. This account features a number of projects and reals depicting the steps of my processes and showcases my finished works.\n\nDo you have a website?\n\nEverflame Forge is my current website, although I’m developing a new one.\n\nHave you competed in contests? What awards have you won?\n\nI’ve been in the Southern Ohio Forge & Anvil’s Quadstate gallery for six years now and have won awards most of those years. My first knife, a wine glass holder, and a folding knife won first place, along with other projects getting second and third. Although now that I’m no longer in the youth category, I’m ready for a bigger challenge.\n\nHave you been featured in a magazine or other publication?\n\nNot yet! Primarily, I sell items through commissioned orders and from my table when I demonstrate blacksmithing at The Hartville Marketplace’s Moonlight Markets. Also, my new website will have online ordering available.\n\nDo you create metal items for people? How does a client contact you?\n\nYes, I’ll do my best to talk with anyone who wishes to buy or commission my work, hoping to find a way to make something they like at a fair price. Currently, the best place to contact me is Instagram, although my email works just as well albeit slower.\n\nWhat is your process for creating an item?\n\nFirst, I have to figure out the steps it takes to make it and if I have all of the materials. Using the forge, I can heat metal to over 1,800° F. I can control the temperature by how much and how long the metal is exposed to the flame to get an optimal forging color where the metal is soft enough to shape. Other temperatures are needed for different parts of the forging process, such as quenching and tempering. Using a hammer, I can draw the metal out, flatten, round, taper, bend, and texture it. Sometimes, I’ll use pliers or a jig to achieve a particular bend and a butcher’s block brush to remove scale. Depending on the work, I’ll use a belt grinder, angle grinder, drill press, sandpaper, and other tools. I usually finish by quenching in a particular oil to protect against rust and preserve my work for generations to come.\n\nHow is what you create for yourself different from what you create for other people?\n\nWhat I create for myself is usually prototypes. I test and grow my ability by trying to make new things and that often leads to experimentation. If I like an idea enough to make it again, it ends up as one of the things I try to make regularly to sell.\n\nHas your work ever been used for commercial purposes?\n\nMost of my work is for the personal use of my clients.\n\nWhat’s your favorite metal piece that you’ve created?\n\nI’d have to say that so far, the favorite of my works is a lockback pocketknife, one of the first blades I’ve made. It really pushed my experience and took a couple of tries but is a testament to how far I can go. It’s far from perfect, but it always makes me excited to keep trying.\n\nWhat’s your dream piece to create?\n\nSo far, I’ve been able to make a lot of what I’ve put my mind to, but I hope to get into more Damascus steel soon. I’m very excited to be able to work together with my fiancé on Damascus knives in the future.\n\nWhat’s your biggest complaint about blacksmithing?\n\nI wouldn’t complain about blacksmithing so much as the trouble I have with motivation on occasion. My energy is stretched between a lot of different things. Often, I spend time in my head. I am learning to control this and prioritize myself and my work.\n\nWould you like to work full-time as a blacksmith? If so, how do you see your business growing?\n\nI would love to work full-time as a blacksmith. I’ll do my best with where I am now, but I definitely hope to partner up with my fiancé and build our businesses together doing what we love.\n\nDo you work alone or with a partner?\n\nWhile I love working with other people, I work by myself currently. It leaves room for the unfortunate side effects of demotivation and distraction. Although, every once in a while, I’m able to spend time with one of my mentors or friends making something. As I’ve said, hopefully that will soon change, and I’ll be able to work with my life partner.\n\nI discovered Natalie Friedrich through her tea, Philosopher, and her company, Gnat & Bee, when I purchased a sample-sized packet at Thirty-two 8 Inspired & Co. It was love at first sip, and I immediately knew that I wanted Natalie to be part of my book launch party for my recently released novel, Realm.\n\nFortunately, Natalie agreed, and the process of working with her was most pleasant and educational. I’ll allow her answers to the Artist’s Corner interview questions to be her introduction as I’m sure her passion for all things tea will shine through.\n\nTell me a little bit about yourself.\n\nI am thirty-two years old, a first-generation Japanese American, and grew up on Kauai, Hawaii, and California’s central coast. My husband and I met in the west, and we moved to Ohio together where he grew up. I have now lived in Wooster for over 10 years, and we are so grateful to be on a beautiful five acres in the countryside with our two daughters. On our homestead, I love to garden herbs and vegetables, forage wild ingredients, and enjoy caring for chickens.\n\nWhat has your experience been?\n\nI attended Monterey Peninsula Community College where I took a wide variety of art classes and studied psychology. My favorite mediums that I continue to practice include watercolor painting and ceramics. I have always loved cooking and I have had many years of experience as a vegan and conventional baker for cafes, restaurants, events, and freelancing. I began my self-studies in herbalism when I moved to Ohio. Most recently, I worked for a food and art co-op where I helped with daily operations, digital marketing, in-store design, and product management with local producers.\n\nDid your work experience lead to the pursuit of tea blending?\n\nI consider myself to be an independent creative. I created my own bakery business, then transitioned into making teas and body care with my knowledge of herbalism. In my last job, I often coached people with new business ideas on how they can be successful in a local marketplace. There, I learned the importance of branding, marketing, consistency, and sourcing quality (local or self-produced) ingredients when possible. These are all important components that I apply to the work that I do now, as a tea blender.\n\nDo you put yourself into your tea blending? If so, how?\n\nAbsolutely. Blending tea is very personal to me, it is an activity that captivates every one of my senses. Every ingredient is carefully selected, some grown and harvested by my own hands. Stirring the components together is a peaceful ritual and creative outlet for me.\n\nHow did you develop your passion for blending tea?\n\nAs a culinary creative, I have always enjoyed producing unique flavor combinations and experiences to share with others. Many moons ago, one of my favorite small tea companies, Altar and Leaf, taught a wonderful and intuitive tea blending class. Lindsay’s course was so inspiring! This is when I began to blend, experiment, and discover my own style and tastes. It was such a joy to work with herbs, fruits, and spices to create nourishing and comforting cups of tea.\n\nWhat or who is your inspiration?\n\nI am inspired by the four seasons in nature, life experiences, and stories.\n\nWhat blends do you enjoy creating? What are your favorite ingredients?\n\nI enjoy creating teas that, upon sipping, take you to a different place. When you take in the flavor and aroma, you may find yourself in a field of wildflowers or a cottage garden, a rustic countryside, a woodland wander, or on an exotic spicy adventure.\n\nWhat is your favorite blend that you’ve created?\n\nOh, this is a tough one! I have about 35 original recipes under my belt now. I have wonderful memories of creating Strawberry Sun. It is made with delicate white tea, dried strawberries, and citrusy spruce tips that I love to harvest every spring.\n\nWhen creating for yourself, what is your process?\n\nWhen I create for myself, it is a very natural flowing process because I have a feeling or story in my head and heart. It becomes translated through the jars of botanicals in my apothecary and mixed in a small pottery bowl. Usually, it will take a few cuppings and adjustments to get a blend exactly how I want it to taste. It is so satisfying to match a flavor to a feeling.\n\nDo you work alone or with a partner?\n\nI used to work alone. Now I have one full-time helper, and she really keeps me motivated, on task, and we are so productive together. I would be a mess, and so far behind without her.\n\nWhere can someone find you online?\n\nI am most active on Instagram. I love visual storytelling and sharing my work, processes, and nature around me.\n\nDo you have a website?\n\nI do have a website where we sell our goods and sometimes share a blog with a tea recipe or seasonal inspiration: Gnat and Bee\n\nFor whom do you create teas?\n\nI create teas for all kinds of people from all walks of life.\n\nHow does a client contact you?\n\nEmail: natalie@gnatandbee.com\n\nWhat is your process when creating for a client?\n\nWe will discuss the purpose and intention of the blend. We talk about likes, dislikes, and medical conditions. I will provide samples, and we will decide together when the blend is perfectly finished.\n\nAny complaints in the tea blending business?\n\nThrough working in this industry for a handful of years, I see companies that are built solely on buying tea blends that are made by another larger company and then repackaged with their own brand name. I think this is dishonest, lazy, and unoriginal. I could never imagine calling someone else’s creation my own. There are also a lot of artificial or heavily flavored teas in the blended tea category, I think this is a crutch and a shame. I like to honor the individual plants and ingredients, they have so many health benefits and beauty to offer us. It can be challenging to source or grow so many different single ingredients, but this is how I can ensure the highest quality for the best-tasting teas. I think this care and attention sets our teas apart from other companies.\n\nDo you work full-time as a tea blender? If so, how do you see your business growing?\n\nYes, I resigned from my last job in March of 2022 and now run my business full-time. We are currently a home-based cozy apothecary with dedicated workspaces for efficient production and shipping. I have a goal to renovate a building on our property for the business to move into. This would include a welcoming space for a tea house that would be open to the public with indoor and outdoor seating overlooking the gardens. I would love to host events and classes for guests here.\n\nPrior to meeting Kori Frazier Morgan, I heard her name mentioned several times by fellow writer, Don Ake. Then I had the pleasure of hearing her speak at the writing group Don facilitates, The Write Stuff. She was quite professional and pleasant. I, however, wasn’t in the right place to receive what she talked about. Finally, at the annual Christmas party hosted by The Write Stuff, Don insisted that I sit down next to Kori and talk with her. He even cleared a chair beside her so we could speak uninterrupted face to face. Well, all I know is that I can only avoid so many divine appointments before the lightning bolt successfully strikes through my thick skull. Kori was exactly what my novel needed, and I am so thankful to God for her. She’s also what I needed, and she came along at just the right time. Take a moment to meet this marvelous woman through her interview.\n\nWelcome to the Artist’s Corner. Tell me a little bit about yourself.\n\nI’m Kori Frazier Morgan. I grew up in Kent, Ohio and now live in rural northeast Ohio with my husband, Curtis, who is a machinist and craftsman. We have three pets—two cats, Anastasia and Moe, and Gus, a basset/beagle mix. I hold a B.A. in creative writing and professional writing from Ohio Northern University and a Master of Fine Arts in fiction writing from West Virginia University. Aside from reading and writing, I enjoy long-distance cycling, watching movies, seeing live theatre, and listening to vinyl.\n\nHow did your work experience contribute to your desire to write?\n\nI have been blessed to pretty much work in some area of the writing field since graduating from college in 2007. I have created educational content, taught writing classes, and worked as a copywriter and content developer. Even when I worked in retail, it was at a bookstore, so I was still operating within the writing world. All my jobs have helped me get better at writing and learn new things.\n\nHave you always wanted to be a writer? When did you develop your love of writing?\n\nI have enjoyed making up stories and writing them down since I was a kid, but I didn’t start to really think seriously about writing as a career until eighth grade, when I found out that creative writing was something you could study in college. Up until then, I just thought it was a cool hobby. I was blessed to have some wonderful teachers in middle school and high school who helped me develop my talents. I worked on the newspaper staff, took acting and communications classes, and loved being in AP English and history courses, where writing essays was a big part of the class.\n\nHave you ever worked as a freelance writer?\n\nAll the time. Every day. In 2012, I left academia to pursue freelance writing full time. I returned to the classroom for a few years to teach at a career college and later worked in marketing, but I can’t say I’ve ever totally left the freelance world. Now I run a small business (more on that later) and freelancing is a big part of my life.\n\nWhat genre do you write?\n\nI have primarily written fiction in the past, but I am now working on a collection of flash nonfiction essays. I also run a weekly blog, Creativity Matters, as part of my business, Inkling Creative Strategies.\n\nTo which writing communities do you belong?\n\nI am a member of The Habit, a worldwide community of Christian writers. We work together to study writing, encourage each other, and help each other to become proficient in our craft. The fellowship at The Habit is extraordinary. People care not just about helping you write excellent work, but about you as an individual. We take writing classes, share our writing on a forum, and have virtual writing time on Zoom, where we hang out and work on our projects.\n\nMore in our immediate area, I’m part of A Writer’s Life NEO and The Write Stuff, groups based in the Akron/Canton area that meet monthly to critique members’ work. You can either bring something to share or just read and comment. It’s a very low-key, informal way to get some feedback on your writing and The Write Stuff goes out to eat afterward.\n\nWho or what influences your writing?\n\nI am a big fan of music and film. I listen to music while I write and try to put together playlists that help shape what I’m working on. My novel-in-stories, The Goodbye-Love Generation, is heavily based on my dad’s experiences as a member of the Northeast Ohio music scene around the time of the Kent State shootings in 1970, and I have a whole Spotify playlist devoted to the songs that are in the background of the story. When I’m not writing, I enjoy listening to everything from classical to classic country to hymns to Metallica.\n\nMy favorite movie is The Shawshank Redemption, which I’ve seen an obscene number of times. I think it is the perfect film for writers to study to learn about narration, character development, foreshadowing, and just how to deliver a satisfying story in general.\n\nHow have your favorite authors and/or books shaped your writing?\n\nMy favorite author is Flannery O’Connor, and my favorite book is her novel, Wise Blood. I love that she is a Christian author who is not afraid to look at the darkness of the human heart. All of her characters have to face the question of what we are to do with Jesus Christ and His death and resurrection on our behalf, but she does so in a way that resists sentimentality. Many of the stories conclude in a way that is open-ended, leaving room to speculate about what their answer might be. I’m not sure exactly how her work has directly impacted my writing. I just know it has.\n\nWhat’s your dream goal as a writer?\n\nI want my books to get to as many people as possible whose lives will be impacted by them.\n\nWhich authors/genres do you enjoy reading?\n\nI like literary fiction, memoir, and books about theology and spirituality that will help me grow in my faith. I also love studying the Bible. It is God’s inspired Word and contains everything I need to learn more about Him and receive His direction for my life.\n\nWhat are you reading right now?\n\nI am reading The Door on Half-Bald Hill, a novel by Helena Sorensen. Helena is a member of The Rabbit Room, an organization I support that provides encouragement and edification for Christian artists of all kinds.\n\nWhat have you published and where?\n\nI have published two books: Bone China Girls, a poetry chapbook, and The Goodbye-Love Generation, both through my independent imprint, Bezalel Media. Numerous individual pieces have also appeared in literary journals such as Shenandoah, SN Review, Switchback, Rubbertop Review, Blanket Sea, Up the Staircase Quarterly, and more.\n\nDescribe your journey to publication.\n\nI have been writing professionally for more than 15 years, and the landscape of publishing has changed tremendously in that time. I am an independent author and do the majority of the work to publish and promote my work. During my MFA program in the late ‘00s, we were told that self-publishing was not a legitimate way to publishing a book and that going that route would destroy your credibility. As a result, even as time passed and it became more accepted and prevalent, I was reluctant to pursue publishing my own work.\n\nThings changed after my chapbook, Bone China Girls, was still being rejected after five years. The book recounts the true story of the tragic death of a sixteen-year-old girl in the mid-’60s at the hands of teens and children in her neighborhood, and I felt that it commented on issues such as sexual abuse, bullying, and violence against women that were widely discussed and that I could provide insight into. I decided to publish the chapbook myself because I saw it as an urgent matter. The book’s message was important, and I simply couldn’t wait around for the gatekeepers to tell me I could share it.\n\nI am an independent author and I enjoy publishing my own books. As a marketer and editor with a desktop publishing background, I have the majority of the skills necessary to do the work on my own. I would certainly not recommend this path to everyone—there are some truly hideous books out there that have resulted from authors taking on the responsibility when they are not equipped to handle being the entirety of their publication team. You have to be able to do it professionally in order to be taken seriously.\n\nHave you faced any challenges with writing and/or publishing?\n\nI have struggled with superimposing my own will on my work—trying to make my writing do something that, within the context of a particular project, it is simply not able to do. The Goodbye-Love Generation was like this. I had an agent turn it down when I was finishing grad school because it was a novel composed of short stories and not a traditional novel. As a result, I assumed there was something wrong with that format and spent ten years trying to make it work as a novel or abandoning it for periods of time because I was so frustrated.\n\nEventually, I realized that I had it right the first time. It was supposed to be a collection of interconnected stories. The fragmented nature of the story fits the characters’ own fragmented perception of the world and themselves. No other format would work to tell this story. Instead of just working with what I had, I let one person’s opinion dictate what I did with my book for ten years. You have to believe in your vision for your writing even if it isn’t what the powers that be seem to want.\n\nAre there any comparative titles to your work(s)?\n\nI am a big fan of two other authors who have written fiction about the Kent State tragedy. Sabrina Fedel has a book called Leaving Kent State that addresses the year leading up to the shootings from the perspective of a high school senior dealing with a friend who returns from Vietnam with PTSD and a debilitating injury. I was also thrilled to receive an endorsement for my book from the fabulous Rita Dragonette, whose novel The Fourteenth of September impacted my revisions. The book is about a college student in the ROTC nursing program who secretly becomes involved with an anti-war group on campus and is caught between her family’s traditional conservative values and her growing feelings that the Vietnam War is wrong.\n\nDescribe your research process.\n\nI like to get immersed in places. When I was researching The Goodbye-Love Generation, I felt it was necessary to get the reader out of Kent for some of the stories and move away from the politically charged narrative of the shootings. I can’t remember exactly how it happened, but some thread or another of my Google searching led me to Chippewa Lake Park, a now-defunct amusement park that played an active role in giving local musicians exposure back in the ‘60s and ‘70s. It found its way into two stories in the book. That wasn’t something I planned on, but I think it brought an element of innocence to a story that is otherwise very violent and full of loss.\n\nI also wrote some of the book at a cafe in downtown Kent across the street from the former site of J.B.’s, the bar where my fictional band, The Purple Orange, performs in the book. Downtown Kent is very different now than it was in the ‘70s but being able to imagine the characters there really informed how I described the setting.\n\nTell me about your newest business venture.\n\nInkling Creative Strategies is an author services company that offers editing, project development, consulting, typesetting and interior book design, mentorship, and more. My inspiration is the Inklings, the writing society that J.R.R. Tolkien, C.S. Lewis, and other writers at Oxford started to encourage each other in their work. My goal is to help writers reach their full creative potential so they can impact and inspire readers. We have been in operation for almost two years, and in that time, authors have released books, completed manuscripts, developed short stories, and started blogs. It’s been awesome to see how it’s developed!\n\nWhere can one find you on the Internet?\n\nYou can visit my website to learn more about Inkling Creative Strategies. On my website, I offer free writing tools, including workbooks and checklists, as well as the opportunity to schedule a free Zoom consultation.\n\nFor more information about my book, visit The Goodbye-Love Generation.\n\nYou can also find me on Instagram @inklingcreativestrategies.\n\nWhat advice can you offer for someone seeking an editor?\n\nI think an ideal editor balances being knowledgeable about the English language and creative writing with understanding the author’s vision. It isn’t about being correct all the time—it’s about collaborating with the writer to make their work exactly what they want it to be. Editing has to be an ego-free process, and you can’t be married to the rules. You need to show the author grace in terms of helping them execute their ideas. I would strongly advise writers to not take on an editor who is rigid and not willing to collaborate.\n\nWhat’s your dream job as an editor?\n\nI would love to see an author I work with just totally blow up with their work—get tons of readers and attention, and maybe even become a hit nationally. Not because Inkling might get some credit for that, or that even I would, but because I would have accomplished my mission of helping someone reach their full creative potential.\n\nWhere do you see yourself in the world of writing in ten years?\n\nI would love to see Inkling grow enough that I can partner with other editors who share my vision. I also, of course, hope that I will continue to write and publish work that will make an impact on readers, whatever that looks like. I also fantasize about The Goodbye-Love Generation being made into an Amazon or Netflix limited series.\n\nThose are great goals and dreams. Wishing you all the best in your pursuits!\n\nAs a writer, I like to keep it simple. A spiral-bound notebook and a no. 2 pencil sharpened to a precise point are all I need to make my ideas a reality on the page. I love the sound of the pencil scritching across the paper. It’s the sound of progress being made. But every now and then, a writer needs to raise the quality of her writing instrument if for no other reason than the sheer pleasure it brings in owning a piece of artwork.\n\nI cannot describe the thrill of writing with my custom-made fountain pen created by woodworker Arthur Miller. So far, I’ve saved my beautiful pen with its specially chosen color of ink for journaling. But art such as Mr. Miller creates is beautiful, functional, and durable. It would be a shame to keep my pen locked away for only occasional use. I simply love the feel of the pen in my hand and how the silky flow of ink makes even a humble grocery list look like a masterpiece of calligraphy.\n\nMr. Miller was gracious enough to share his passion for woodworking and explain the process behind the fountain pens and other beautiful works of art he creates in his studio.\n\nTell me a little bit about yourself.\n\nI was born in Akron, Ohio. I attended Springfield Township Schools and graduated from Buchtel High School. The Vietnam War was on, so two years after graduating I joined the U.S. Coast Guard. My first airplane ride was from Cleveland to Philadelphia, where I boarded a bus for the trip to Cape May, NJ where I attended boot camp. I have been stationed in Ogdensburg, NY on the St. Lawrence River; Cleveland, Ohio; Honolulu, Hawaii; Cape May, New Jersey; Little Creek, Virginia; New York City, and back to Cape May thus completing thirty years, two months, and fifteen days of service and retiring as a Chief Warrant Officer, CWO4. Following retirement, I worked for a durable medical equipment company, at a hardware store, and at a destination resort in Cape May. I have always been interested in wood turning, and my hobby, now in full force, somehow got out of control.\n\nI am married to my first wife, Diana (from Medina, Ohio), and have two married daughters who live close by, and one grandson.\n\nHow did you develop your interest in woodworking? Was it a career or hobby? How long have you been at it?\n\nI have long loved wood. Our childhood home was made from wood of one form or another: barn siding in the kitchen, pine paneling boards in the living room and office, mahogany panels in the bedrooms. The only plaster in the house was in the bathroom. I loved the smell, the feel, and the look of wood since forever except when we moved and I had to remove all the green paint from the oak paneling and woodwork in our new city house. I loved to climb trees and build things from wood. In high school, I took wood shop from Mr. John McKay who further enhanced my woodworking experience.\n\nAre you professionally educated/trained in wood working or self-taught?\n\nWhile I have been exposed to several of the foremost wood turners in the country since starting my business, and I don’t make any claim to match them. I am largely self-taught beyond the high school years.\n\nWhat tools do you use in the process of woodworking?\n\nFor tools of the wood working trade, of course there are the lathes of which I have three: two bench top (a 10 in. x 24 in. and a 12 in. x 24 in. capable lathes) and a larger 16 in. x 36 in. floor model. The smaller number indicates half the distance from the spindle to the bed x 2 which is the maximum turning diameter over the bed. Of course, the lathe can be reconfigured. The headstock can be moved to the end of the bed where by the maximum diameter is half the distance from the spindle to the floor—in my case about 7 feet. I am not turning 7 foot diameter items at this time!\n\nThen there are the tools of wood turning. They come in two types: HSS (High Speed Steel) and carbide. The HSS come in several categories, gouges, scrapers, and specialty. This category of tool is sharpened on a diamond grinding wheel. Carbide tools are not sharpened. The cutting surface is replaced when it is no longer sharp. Both tools are important in the studio of Sweet N Round. Resins are another important tool used for casting.\n\nWhat are some products you make from wood?\n\nThe product line at Sweet N Round is quite extensive. I make Pepper Mills, Salt Mills and Shakers, Coffee Mills, Platters, Bowls, Kaleidoscopes, Pens and Pencils, Sewing and Knitting items (Seam Rippers, Yarn Minders and Yarn Barns, Crochet Hook Sets), Marker Rings, Shawl Pins and Rings, Key Rings, Pill Boxes, Purse Hangers, Clocks, Garden Dibbles, Pizza Cutters, Bottle Openers, Wine Cork Extractors and Stoppers, and many other items.\n\nDo you make furniture, sheds, toys, porches, framing, or other large items?\n\nAll items are made in my studio. Funny, in 1996, my brother-in-law and I built a shed. Soon, since I did a little mechanical work at that time, it was called a “Shop.” Today, that same building is now called my “Studio.” I do make toys—toy tops and kaleidoscopes.\n\nDescribe the process of making a fountain pen.\n\nHow to make a pen: first and foremost, select the style pen to make—be it a simple ball point, an advanced ball point, a roller ball, a fountain pen (which also come in simple and advanced), or a dip pen.\n\nMost pens share these steps: select the kit (metal parts which will make up the pen), match with the material (see more on material later), we will call this the blank. Mark the blank to maximize the probability the grain will match. Cut to length then drill a proper hole for the tube that holds the workings inside—ranging from 7 mm to 27/67 inch. The drilling is done on the lathe using a special chuck, which holds the material tightly on the lathe, and of course the proper size drill. All brass tubes used on the interior of the pen must be roughed up with sand paper. This process is also done on the lathe using a mandrel. Tubes which will be used in acrylic pens must next be painted white. When the blanks are measured, drilled, and ready, the tubes are glued into the blank using either CA (cyanoacrylate) or two part epoxy glue. You know CA by its more common name, Super Glue. When the glued blanks have set, the next step is to mill the ends of the blanks (make the ends of the pen square with the tube). Once squared, the blanks are almost ready to be turned. Each blank is marked inside to indicate the end. In my shop, the mark is either the nib end or the finial end. In the case of many high-end writing devices, the finial end is larger than the nib end. Finally, the piece is turned. The blanks are mounted on a pen mandrel and turned to the proper sizes—sanded to usually 5000 grit in the case of wood—and then an appropriate finish is applied. In the case of acrylic or other similar products, the blanks are finished to 12,000 grit, polished with cream, and then buffed on the buffing wheel.\n\nIf wood, the finish may be wax, wax and oil, or CA. If CA is used to finish, seven coats of CA are applied and cured, and then the blank is finished in the same manner as acrylics.\n\nWhat types of wood do you work with? What’s your favorite wood to work with?\n\nThe most expensive exotic woods used at Sweet N Round are composites. A composite is wood or other material which, standing alone, has no value. The wood or other material is cast in different materials and then cut into blanks. Seashell blanks come to mind. The seashell material destroys regular cutting tools. Think of sanding sand in resin with sand paper. It cannot be cut using a regular saw, drill, etc.\n\nWe work with local woods (maybe from my back yard), domestic and exotic woods, acrylics, Corian, antler, horn, composites, and other materials.\n\nMy favorite woods to work with are those that smell nice. Pau Ferro, aka Bolivian Rose Wood, of the Rose Wood family comes immediately to the front. Included in this family is Cocobolo, a wood from Mexico. Many people are allergic to these woods though once finished it poses no issues to the user.\n\nWhat other materials do you work with?\n\nI like to turn a variety of acrylic and Corian although at the initial turning stages the chips are shrapnel. One must protect oneself from the hundreds of flying sharp pieces. Also a consideration in wood turning is the dust. Air filters are an absolute must in a closed shop and studios. Masks are also a must to protect the lungs from the dust. However, they also cause the eye protection to fog, so everything comes to a halt until I can see once again. Another wood I use is color wood. Grown in Maine, bass is cut, sliced into thin plies, dyed different colors, glued into slabs, cut to size, and sold to me for a ton of money. Colored wood items, such as mills, sell ten to one over the most beautiful grained cherry, oak, mahogany, maple, sassafras, etc.\n\nWhat has been your biggest challenge with woodworking?\n\nFinishing. Most of the time I use a finish called friction finish. It is mostly shellac and carnauba wax. I have no problem with small surfaces, but bigger surfaces are not always so good. I would like to learn lacquer and colors.\n\nMany artists love turning a concept into a reality. What is your dream project?\n\nI would like to turn items frozen in ice. Assorted shapes, permanently mounted on a base of some type, and then frozen in a block of ice to hold the smaller pieces in position. The result would be perhaps a wood or other material ball with a concave shape cut into it or a pyramid or a box. I’m still thinking about it.\n\nWhat has been your most complex project to date?\n\nI’m thinking the most complex, which should be the simplest, drilling a hole through a baseball bat.\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about woodworking and/or working with your hands?\n\nI like taking a piece of wood, conceptualizing, mounting on the machine, and then have the wood dictate to me what it wants to be.\n\nDoes your chosen craft require practice? If so, how much?\n\nHow do ya get to Carnegie hall? Practice, practice, practice. I often get pieces of wood from someone’s family farm, or the yard, or something Grandpa always liked. The instruction: “I dunno, see what you can get from it”.\n\nHow critical are you of your own work?\n\nI’m pretty tough. My quality control lady (wife) is way tougher. My burn box is full of items that did not make the grade.\n\nOf what product/piece/project are you most proud?\n\nI like my “Dark Side of the Moon,” my “Lunar Lander,” and my large “Natural Edge Cherry Burl Bowl”—I don’t know what to name it.\n\nDo you teach your craft to others?\n\nAbsolutely. Belonging to the Cape Atlantic Wood Turners, an AAW affiliate (American Association of Wood Turners), one of the missions of our club is to spread the word. Each member has some private instruction arrangement and several of us teach basic wood turning at our local Technical Night School.\n\nDo you participate in trade shows, craft shows, lectures, demonstrations, or conferences?\n\nShows are where it is at. I enjoy meeting the people, explaining, demonstrating, showing, and selling my work. It is a joy to see someone come to my table and their eyes just light up. One show, it was a Sunday afternoon, a lady came to my table, and tears immediately filled her eyes. I didn’t know what to think. Her son was about to graduate from college and her husband, a Vietnam Vet, had just passed away. She was looking at my wooden Sierra Vista Pen, which was a rendition of the Vietnam Service Ribbon, in wood. Something we enjoy but have not done a lot is the home parties.\n\nAre all your pieces unique? Do you work by commission?\n\nI tell people all the time that my pieces are unique. I never (well rarely) measure. If you find two alike, it was an error or a forgery. Bring it back!\n\nI am honored when people ask me to do commission work. I once made a lid for the urn for Uncle Fred’s ashes.\n\nWhen I do this kind of work, we understand we will aim for this or that goal. If my work misses your goal, we will try again until you are happy. However, woodworking is an art form.\n\nWhere would you like to go with your woodworking?\n\nI’m pretty happy with where I am though not stagnating. There are items I must make to sell—that is what pays the bills—and there are items I call bait. Be they big or small, bait are items people want to drool over but really, where will they put it or how will they afford it? I like to make captured ring items. Typically a wine glass looking piece with a ring of the stem.\n\nDoes your skill set include carving or wood burning?\n\nI burn my fingers all the time! I do not (have not) carved. Occasionally, I will burn a ring into a piece as accent.\n\nWhat are you currently working on?\n\nPens, pens, pens. I make usually sixty pens at a time. Pepper mills for the summer.\n\nWhere is your workshop set up?\n\nMy shop is at the rear of my home. It is 12 x 16 feet. I have no radio because I want to hear the machines and the work as it is developing.\n\nWhere can people find you on social media?\n\nWe call ourselves Sweet N Round, and we can be easily found on Facebook.\n\nSweet: because we are honeybee keepers. We also honor my wife’s heritage as a Medina Bee. Medina is the honey capital of the world and home of the A. I. Root Company—formerly the largest honeybee supplier in the world and now the premier candle producer in the world.\n\nN: for a conjunction\n\nRound: well, I make round things.\n\nAbout a year and a half ago, I was invited to join an informal meeting for members of Sisters in Crime at a fellow writer’s home. Although I don’t write mysteries, the meetings were, and still are, extremely beneficial as we talked craft and industry across the genres. The feedback has been wonderful, and the friendships are invaluable.\n\nI met author Cari Dubiel at these meetings, and right from the start I could tell she was an articulate, intelligent woman. Being a librarian, book lover, and writer definitely scored Cari high marks in my book, but since that first meeting, she and I have had the opportunity to discuss the joys and woes of the writing life in some detail. Imagine how pleased I was to find a kindred spirit who shared my passions and concerns. In fact, much of what Cari said precisely mirrored what I had been thinking and feeling and I realized she would be the perfect candidate for an Artist’s Corner interview.\n\nSo, without further ado, allow me introduce you to genre-bending author Cari Dubiel.\n\nTell me a little bit about yourself.\n\nI’m a lifelong Ohio resident, married with two young children. I’m the Adult Learning and Information Services Manager at the Twinsburg Public Library in Twinsburg, Ohio. I’ve worked there for 11 years, though not always as a manager. Prior to TPL, I worked for a few other public libraries in Northeast Ohio, for a total of 20 years in libraries. I also speak and write in the library field, and I adjunct at Kent State University.\n\nWhen did you develop your love of writing?\n\nI was a very early reader – I don’t remember it, but my mom said that I could read fluently by the time I was three. She used to take me to her work, open a magazine, and watch all her friends’ jaws drop when I was able to read any sentence she pointed to. And, of course, I loved to read. So by the time I was in third grade, I wanted to write my own stories. My first story was called “Trapped in a Video Game,” and it was complete with illustrations of Mario and the Princess.\n\nDid your position as a librarian play into your career as a writer?\n\nWell, I don’t do any writing at work, and I’m not allowed to use my position to promote my books. But there is a natural correlation. A woman I worked with years ago introduced me to her husband, who was an avid mystery fan. He introduced me in turn to Casey Daniels, who got me involved in Sisters in Crime. So I guess I have Bob Burke to thank for my connections so far! I also regularly host authors at the library, and I read and review their books. And of course, we have a fantastic collection of craft books that I’ve cultivated. I think it’s the best in our consortium.\n\nHave you ever worked as a freelance writer?\n\nIn library land, I’ve written for Library Journal, Booklist, and several professional blogs. Occasionally, I also take on freelance editing jobs, but I only take those that I am really passionate about, as I don’t have a lot of extra time! I’ve had a few short stories published online and in anthologies as well.\n\nIn what genre(s) do you enjoy writing?\n\nI love to experiment with genre. I don’t like to feel boxed into one specific type of story. My writing is mainly focused on the characters and their arcs, but I also like to have a solidly structured plot to keep the reader guessing. I like pseudoscience – taking existing scientific concepts and playing with them, saying “what if?” I also like to have a mystery aspect to everything I write. It may not always be a “whodunit” – sometimes it’s a “whydunit.” And sometimes both.\n\nWhich genres do you enjoy reading? Who are your favorite authors?\n\nI pretty much read everything. I’ll go through phases when I’ll be in the mood for just one thing, and then I’ll switch gears to a totally different genre or type of book. Right now I’m in a sci-fi groove, particularly funny sci-fi. My other favorites are literary fiction, psychological thrillers, traditional and cozy mysteries, and nonfiction of all kinds. I tend to pick up whatever strikes my fancy – working in a library definitely enables my reading habit – but I always look forward to new books by Ernest Cline, Peter Swanson, Jennifer Weiner, Jonathan Tropper, Kate Racculia, and Ann Patchett. I love to support my writer friends as well – I’ll read and review everything they send me, or I’ll buy their books after pub date if I can’t get a review copy.\n\nHow have your favorite authors shaped your writing?\n\nI think each one brings me a different strength. Tropper and Weiner have strong male and female voices, respectively, with smart, flawed protagonists. Patchett writes so beautifully and subtly, and Swanson writes highly readable killer thrillers. Cline is the master of sci-fi intrigue. I can’t wait for the Ready Player One movie. Kate Racculia is a fabulous literary writer, but she also has a strong focus on plot and character that really drives her fiction.\n\nTell me about your novel, How to Remember.\n\nI often have intense, realistic, bizarre dreams. I also sleepwalk, so I wonder if there’s something weird going on in my unconscious mind. I woke up from one where I had lost exactly one year’s worth of memory, and it took me a while to figure out what was going on. In the dream, my phone had been wiped, and I couldn’t find my computer, so there were no clues to what had happened. My protagonist, Dr. Miranda Underwood, starts off the novel in that situation. Through the course of the book, she has to find those clues and follow them to the answers she needs.\n\nMiranda narrates from 2017; secondary protagonist Ben Baker narrates from 2016, helping to fill in the blanks. He encounters Miranda in her job at a company called MindTech, where she helps patients deal with past trauma by looking at their mental maps and providing them with targeted therapeutic solutions. Ben’s mother has died under mysterious circumstances, and he’s looking for answers of his own. The two narratives dovetail to show the reader what happened.\n\nThe book is available for pre-order at Inkshares: How To Remember\n\nAre there any comparative titles?\n\nThe concepts are similar to the movie Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, but the style is completely different from that film. With its focus on suburbia, the setting is reminiscent of Holly Brown’s This is Not Over or Liane Moriarty’s Big Little Lies. In that way, the book is strongly domestic suspense. There are strong themes of parenthood and exploration of the relationships between parents and children. However, it also has the science fiction component with a lot of nerdy appeal, which fans of Ready Player One and The Impossible Fortress by Jason Rekulak would enjoy.\n\nWhat has the editing process been like for you?\n\nNot bad so far – I’ve had some reader input, as well as a professional critique from author Lori Rader-Day through the Hugh Holton Critique Program. That critique program spurred me to enter the Hugh Holton Award competition with the Midwest chapter of the Mystery Writers of America. I won that award in December 2017, so that was a great experience!\n\nI’m looking forward to a professional edit, although I’m also nervous about it since I’ve never been through one before. I do edit for other people, so it will be strange to be on the other side of the screen.\n\nDescribe your journey to publication.\n\nI’m hoping the answer to this will be a lot more complete in the future! Right now I’m campaigning for a publication deal. I need to sell at least 250 copies of my book as pre-orders for the deal to be funded. I’m lucky that this book has won an award, and it’s also been backed by two syndicates on Inkshares, which means that it’s been endorsed by many interested readers. But it’s still not a guarantee.\n\nI have many friends who are in this business, who run the gamut from straight indie to hybrid to traditionally published, and there are so many setbacks and trials for all of them. Every person hits different roadblocks and trials along the way. Mine is no different, and it’s not done yet.\n\nWhy did you decide upon Inkshares?\n\nI read The Punch Escrow by Tal M. Klein, which was a fabulous sci-fi story with great character development. As I usually do when I’ve read a book I like, I checked to see how it was published. The concept of books being published by reader interest was intriguing, and when I logged onto the platform, I was impressed by its sharp look and user appeal.\n\nAt first, I wasn’t sure if I had done the right thing, but now I regret nothing. I’ve met so many cool authors on the platform, who are smart, warm, and kind, and their books are astounding. I’m writing an article for IndiePicks magazine in March to highlight my favorites. I love “selling” books I love to library patrons.\n\nWhat is crowdfunding?\n\nCrowdfunding is a business model that relies on user interest to develop a product. Most people will be familiar with it from platforms like Kickstarter or Indiegogo. When a user sees an item they like, they pledge money towards it to help the product become a reality. On the Inkshares platform, it’s a little different: readers pre-order copies, so they don’t have to spend more than $10 for an e-book or $20 for a physical copy. If they want their name in the back of the book, they can spend $60, and they’ll also receive 3 copies of the book.\n\nWhat challenges have you faced in your writing and with publication?\n\nHonestly, my biggest challenge has been due to my own fault. I haven’t been able to choose a direction. And that comes from my deep love of reading everything. With my writing, I want to echo and amplify other authors, and it’s impossible to put everything I love into one book.\n\nMy friend Amanda Flower gave me the best advice, which finally helped me focus. She said to write what you love, what speaks to you. The rest of it is all business. It may not be the right market for the story at the time, but eventually, if it’s a good story, its time will come.\n\nHow can interested readers assist your efforts?\n\nPre-order at: How to Remember! If I make that 250 mark, readers are guaranteed a copy at publication. If pre-ordering isn’t possible, share the link freely. Inkshares does occasionally publish titles that they determine to have organic popularity, and that comes from liking, sharing, and clicking on the link.\n\nI’ve also released a short story collection for free at “Lost Memories.” I’m posting these stories as I write them, so if you follow me on Inkshares, you’ll get alerts when I add the new content.\n\nWhat is your marketing plan?\n\nI’ve already done two giveaways, and I’m planning more. I find that even if readers can’t afford to purchase the book, they’re grateful if they win, and they’re more likely to follow me and keep up on my work. With each giveaway, I’m hoping to spread the love of books and reading, and I want to get to know my potential readers.\n\nMy awesome graphic artist is developing new covers for both How to Remember and “Lost Memories.” I also have another fabulous artist who is working on line drawings of the main characters. Prints of those will be released in a giveaway as well.\n\nI’ve done some video content, too. The book trailer is on YouTube: How to Remember\n\nYou can follow my channel for more updates.\n\nWhere can one find you one the Internet?\n\nInkshares: Cari Dubiel\n\nGoodreads: Author Cari Dubiel\n\nWebsite: www.caridubiel.com\n\nFacebook: Cari Dubiel Author\n\nTwitter: @caridubiel\n\nInstagram: @cb1281\n\nEmail Newsletter: Sign Up\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nWelcome back to The Artist’s Corner for the second portion of my interview with poet Carrie Tangenberg. Today, we’ll continue with Carrie’s amazing insight into poetry as well as enjoy one of her original poems.\n\nWhy is poetry important?\n\nA literary question for the ages. I can only look through my biased poet’s lens, but I think it’s valuable not just because academia tells us it is.\n\nFor me: Poetry gave me a way to express myself early in life that did not demand absolute clarity or lots of text. I could write what I felt or wanted to feel. I could focus on rhythm and the sounds of words. It didn’t have to make sense to anyone but me, and even then, it took me a long time to be so kind to myself. I used to be quite experimental, moving from puns to invented words and concepts, creating sense out of nonsense. Poetry lets me stretch linguistic connections, explore different word combinations and uses of any given word or phrase, and discover new routes to meaning and beauty.\n\nIn general: Poetry offers a shortcut to evoking reader emotion, making us feel deeply, recalling our humanity. Poems explore, celebrate, articulate, and enhance life, death, love, art, nature, and human connection. Poems invite different ways of seeing everyday things, different ways of thinking about life. Poetry is lyrical, musical, rhythmic, with creative phrase order, language use, lines, and “paragraphs.” Poems present puzzles and riddles to solve and enigmas to wonder at. Poetry can add a touch of class, beauty, spirit, weight, or emotion to more logical or pragmatic ceremonies, presentations, and texts.\n\nPoetry can be challenging, not lying down easily before you just because you showed up to read it. It makes you work by being in stanzas and by making readers pay attention to details to gain meaning. It’s a useful form to renew our concentration abilities, recovering them from Tweet and sound bite, back toward longer literary forms. Among literary modes, poetry pre-dates the novel, the news article, and the textbook. It has longevity. Poetry lets readers and writers approach the depths of meaning to find a way to shine a light and share. Poetry offers greater variety of form than fiction or non-fiction does. It is a diamond of many faces. Poetry offers a niche to fit into when your work or interests don’t fit neatly anywhere else. For instance, poetry lets non-visual artists, listeners, and readers penetrate and fill the spaces between too-reasonable words and wordless music. Songs are poems, and they lend insight into and mark the passage of our culture’s generations.\n\nBeyond that, I refer you to The American Interest online article “Why, Poetry?” by David Kirby (2007). Great stuff. Addressing poetry’s value, he asks, among other things, “Why is there a poet laureate but not a novelist laureate or playwright laureate?” It must mean something to us. Poetry is easier than it used to be, more accessible, and more diverse. New forms are invented on the Internet, and poetry culture moves forward.\n\nAs with any art or literature, not all poems work for everyone, but poetry is a unique form with so much mileage that there really is something for everyone.\n\nWhat do you see as the role of humor in poetry?\n\nAs with many aspects of poetry, humor in poetry is often subtle, but there’s no rule against including the comical in a poem that doesn’t also apply to the rest of the poem or non-humorous ones as well. As long as a poem can breathe, that is if it’s of sufficient length, there can be room for humor in even the most serious. The tension between opposing emotions is something that makes art great.\n\nBilly Collins is the perfect example of a poet who has woven humor masterfully into much of his work. See “Paradelle. Silly and/or psycho form from Billy Collins.” – from the Writer’s Digest article “List of 50 Poetic Forms for Poets.”\n\nHumor’s role in poetry varies and can be manifold. It can be an effective method of emotional contrast for emphasizing a concept or point, or for deepening a dramatic effect. It can help some readers better relate to a poem’s message. It can be pleasurable in its own right. Then, there are the forms of poetry designed for or generous to humorous content: limericks, rhyming couplets, parody, and others.\n\nThere are also poetic forms, such as the elegy, that are meant to be serious. In the end, the poet should aim to match form to content and mood. For a simple example, if a humorous shape emerges from a concrete poetic image, the reader expects funny content.\n\nWhat is the relationship between your speaking voice and your written voice?\n\nWe both tend to be long winded. I’ve always been a formal speaker and an even more formal writer, using words often beyond the understanding or comfort levels of readers and listeners, who in my experience tend to be young or struggling students. But because I dabble in so many different genres, forms, and purposes with my writing, I’m still trying to find a cohesive voice for each. In some ways, just as novelists must put themselves in different frames of mind to get into different characters, a poet can use the poetic space to explore different perspectives and different voices from different characters. The narrator/speaker is not always the author in either poetry or fiction, and they should not be equated. Qualities of an author’s history or personality may echo through his or her work, but not all poetry or fiction is fully or even partially autobiographical.\n\nI think, though, that it is a rare person who is able to speak the same way to every other person encountered in life. Because of this, even our speaking voices are not internally consistent, let alone matched up perfectly with our written voices. On one hand, you wouldn’t want to speak to a stranger the same way you speak to your child or partner. On the other, even when we try to “be ourselves,” we unconsciously hide and reveal, emphasize and downplay, different parts of ourselves depending on who we interact with, our comfort levels, intentions, vulnerabilities, experiences, habits, and modes of being—recreational versus professional atmospheres, for example. People not only can change but do, quite often from moment to moment, in how they represent themselves. It may be dishonest at times, but just as truth can be subjective, so can our identities be flexible. People rarely walk around unfiltered. There’s always a hidden and a visible self. Self-control, invaluable to civilization, means suppressing our first impulses, and that’s a kind of lie, too.\n\nDo you belong to a writing group or community of poets with whom you share your work? Has this been beneficial?\n\nI’m in a writing group, but it’s multi-modal and focused on fiction. Luckily, there are a few members who are also poets, which can add a layer of insight that those less familiar with poetry may not be able to offer. It’s always good to have an outside perspective to consider during revision. With the group, I learn things that apply to all my writing, including poetry.\n\nWhat do you believe is the measure of success for a poet?\n\nThat’s an excellent question. The short answer, unfortunately, is the unsatisfying “It depends.” In this day of self-publishing at the drop of a hat, it’s not the ability to self-publish or be “published.” It’s not solely the ability to get the words on the page with confidence. It’s not necessarily being held in high esteem by authorities with clout, or receiving poetry awards. It’s neither self-defined nor externally defined alone. I suppose it could be a blend of self-perceived success, some degree of circulation of one’s poetry amidst the masses, and some acclaim as a result of that.\n\nIf you don’t feel successful, that doesn’t mean you aren’t, but success in poetry can rarely if ever be defined by financial reward or income sustainability. It’s a long-standing sad joke among poets that this just doesn’t happen with poetry alone. A writer has to diversify. Focus on non-fiction of various kinds, including researched biography, instruction books, a cultural niche, or journalism than to rely on poetry for lucrative ends. Once the poet accepts this reality and still commits to the work of writing verse as part of the repertoire, the aim is to continue to develop as an artist, to advance your craft beyond what it was yesterday. If you can do that, and know that you have, you are succeeding as a writer.\n\nWhat advice do you have for aspiring poets? Do you believe writing poetry can be taught or is it strictly an inherent ability?\n\nCertain principles and several specific forms of poetry must be taught, but writing good poetry also requires innate orientation to the music, cadence, rhythm, sounds, imagery, lyricism, phrasing, or forms of poetry. It requires a thorough understanding of the effective use of language to communicate, to suggest, to imply, and it requires knowing what not to write and how not to write. It requires study, whether self-driven or received in a top-down fashion, as in college or an MFA writing program. True poetry rarely just happens, though I suppose it has occurred and remains possible in that rare individual.\n\nI come from a verse writing education where my professor encouraged further study of certain aspects of my work beyond the scope of my courses. However, I believe a poet can emerge without formal higher education. Poetry is one of those modes of writing with so many variations in approach and form that experimentation and innovation may actually be more readily achieved in poetry than in long-form fiction, for one.\n\nConsistency and cohesion within a poem are key. You can break the rules, but do so across the poem without restoring them at any point. For example, if it’s going to be a poem with end rhymes, you must carry that through to the end. If the first lines are not rhymed, suddenly starting to rhyme part way through is jarring to the reader. If you don’t apply techniques consistently across a piece, you’ve probably written at least two different poems or parts of poems, thinking they’re one when they’re not.\n\nPoetry is all about patterns and the communication of the parts with each other. This is more important in a short form of writing, including short stories, than in longer forms, though novels still do better with some discernible shape—the rising action, conflict, climax, etc.—than without it. If a poem is poorly organized or incoherent or disjointed, it’s really, really noticeable. You can more easily get away with a little nonsense or minor error in a fiction manuscript.\n\nHow would you recommend someone reading poetry for the first time approach a poem?\n\nAny poem of significant length, complexity, or difficulty should be read in phases for its layers. First, read it for the basic idea, and then read aloud to listen for its music. Poetry is designed to be read aloud. Next, read it over and over again with a different focus each time, including: (1) prosody, or the elements of versification and metrical structure, (2) meter-related rhythm, (3) form, including stanza division and line breaks, (4) rhyme, alliteration, assonance, consonance, and other sonic devices, (5) use of literary tools such as personification, metaphor, and simile, (6) point of view and speaker vs. author, (7) relationship of title to poem, etc.\n\nForm should reinforce meaning, support and not work against it, so the more you learn about how a poem is constructed, the closer you come to understanding its message. Sometimes, form can be a large part of message. Poetry is a mode not infrequently used in a self-reflexive way, with poems about poetry, to express poetic principles in structure and words. Finally (or first!) and most important of all, try to pinpoint what you like and dislike about a poem and why. This will inform your reading choices, increasing your enjoyment in the future, and help you learn more about poetry and how to write it.\n\nHow important is accessibility of meaning? Should one have to work hard to “solve” the poem?\n\nA poet should not make it her primary or even secondary aim to impede the reading of her poem. I don’t believe in purposely self-defeating behavior. If you’re reasonably intelligent and you’ve read a poem repeatedly, discussed it, studied it, and still can’t figure out the major strokes, it’s not worth any more of your time. It’s probably unnecessarily difficult.\n\nHowever, because there are layers to any good poem that’s not a couplet or simple Haiku, most poems can be appreciated at multiple levels. Something I enjoy most about poetry and any art form is the richness that allows the audience to discover something new with each return to the work. In academia, poetry reading and study involving sustained, diligent effort markedly increase your chances of fulfilling whatever analytical requirements your instructor has assigned. In pure enjoyment especially, however, poetry is in the eye of the beholder. Like all art, it is subject to matters of personal taste. It’s a subjective enterprise and a personal study. If you’re not required to work hard to solve it, why strain?\n\nWhat do most poorly-written poems have in common?\n\nA bad poem can be bad—or have bad sections—for many reasons. It states the obvious, confuses concepts, turns personal grievance into whining, stops at surface-level emotions and ideas, employs clichéd imagery, demonstrates careless word choice, uses length as a crutch to seem important, applies techniques inconsistently, ends after the first draft, abandons form for content, or, conversely, abandons sensible content to show off a certain structure—or all of the above.\n\nIf you start with free verse, let it remain free. Start with metered verse, and it should probably conform to the meter your first lines set, though some poetic forms deliberately shift meter across the poem. Unless your specific purpose is to explore the different effects deliberate shifting between formalism and free verse has on the structure or ideas, pick one or the other and stick to it.\n\nExamples of excessive structural worship include using rhyme in a forced way, writing a sonnet with hackneyed imagery and stale word choice, writing in meter with awkward rhythm (i.e., bad meter), breaking lines in awkward places just keep lines neat, or only ever breaking lines at sentence endings.\n\nThere are still other ways poems can be poor in quality, but I think those are the main ones.\n\nWhat do most well-written poems have in common?\n\nThe bottom line is that quality poetry, and any writing, is earned. Achieving quality in most things demands study, careful craft, practice, revision, and polish—and those efforts show in the final product. Beyond the opposite of all of those traits described in the previous answer, freshness and originality, masterful vocabulary, applied nuance, and skilled balancing of all aspects set great poems apart from the herd.\n\nWho is your favorite poet?\n\nToo many to list, but here are the main ones: Emily Dickinson, Elizabeth Bishop, Judith Wright, John Keats, Walt Whitman, W. B. Yeats, William Wordsworth, Amy Clampitt, Philip Larkin, Gerard Manley Hopkins, Billy Collins, Sylvia Plath, Wallace Stevens, Wislawa Szymborska, Matthew Arnold, Wilfred Owen, William Shakespeare, Edgar Allan Poe, William Carlos Williams, Ezra Pound, e. e. cummings, Robert Frost, Louis MacNeice, Marianne Moore, Rita Dove, Theodore Roethke, Adrienne Rich, Derek Walcott, Hugh MacDiarmid, W. H. Auden, Christina Rossetti, Robert Burns, Seamus Heaney, Robert Pinsky, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, and many 20th- and 21st-century songwriters.\n\nOther poets I enjoy: William Matthews, Geoffrey Chaucer, Jane Hirschfield, Carolyn Kizer, Mary Jo Salter, D. H. Lawrence, Henry David Thoreau, Dylan Thomas, Robert Pinsky, James Merrill, Richard Wilbur, Kenneth Koch, Patrick Kavanagh, Paul Laurence Dunbar, Donald Hall, Ted Hughes, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Gwendolyn Brooks, William Blake, and Elaine Feeney.\n\nWhat is your favorite poem?\n\nThat’s a bit like asking someone to pick a favorite moment in life or art. Some of those I’m most passionate about, which I highly recommend everyone reads, would be:\n\nAmerican trailblazers: “Song of Myself” by Walt Whitman; Emily Dickinson’s “Because I could not stop for Death,” “A Route of Evanescence,” “Hope Is the Thing with Feathers,” “My Life had stood a Loaded Gun”\n\nBest war themed: “Anthem for Doomed Youth” by Wilfred Owen (WWI) and “First Snow in Alsace” by Richard Wilbur (WWII)\n\nA downright favorite: Amy Clampitt’s “Beethoven, Opus 111” and “The Sun Underfoot Among the Sundews” (love, love, love Clampitt!)\n\nQuintessential Romanticism: “I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud” by William Wordsworth and “Ode to a Nightingale” by John Keats\n\nA. E. Housman’s “To an Athlete Dying Young” and Countee Cullen’s “Heritage”\n\nLove breaking the rules: “since feeling is first” by e. e. cummings\n\nPure contemporary, comic enjoyment: “Forgetfulness” and “I Chop Some Parsley While Listening to Art Blakey’s Version of Three Blind Mice” by Billy Collins\n\nSelf-reflexive poem about what poetry should be: “Ars Poetica” by Archibald MacLeish\n\nA good feminist spin-off: “Eve to Her Daughters” by Judith Wright\n\n20th-century metrical verse: “The Sunlight on the Garden” by Louis MacNeice and “One Art” (a villanelle) by Elizabeth Bishop. Most poems by Elizabeth Bishop.\n\nComparing fish: “The Fish” by Marianne Moore and “The Fish” by Elizabeth Bishop\n\nOh, the sounds: “Root Cellar” by Theodore Roethke and “Lake Isle of Innisfree” by W. B. Yeats\n\nAvant-garde, nature, ephemeral love & line breaks: Book I of Asphodel, That Greeny Flower by William Carlos Williams and “Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird” by Wallace Stevens\n\nA favorite Scots poem: “To a Mouse” by Robert Burns\n\nEpic post-colonial poem: Omeros by Derek Walcott (having some French will help)\n\nBest (only?) nonsense poem I know: “Jabberwocky” by Lewis Carroll\n\nPhilip Larkin: “Church Going,” “For Sidney Bechet,” “An Arundel Tomb” & “Talking in Bed”\n\nSylvia Plath’s “Blackberrying,” “Tulips,” “Ariel,” and “Daddy”\n\nMen of Ireland: “When You Are Old” by W. B. Yeats and Seamus Heaney’s “Punishment”\n\nWhat kind of work are you most drawn to reading yourself? Do you find yourself reading work similar to your own or completely different?\n\nWith writing, I think like attracts like. I seek out what I want to emulate, and I try to emulate what I find most precise, original, musical, and beautiful.\n\nWhat book are you reading right now?\n\nA book club book: The Good Earth, itself written with lyrical, rhythmic prose by Pearl S. Buck. I’ve recently collected some books of poems by Elizabeth Bishop, Wislawa Szymborska, Judith Wright, and Elaine Feeney. I received A Thousand Mornings by Mary Oliver as a gift, but I haven’t been as impressed with her work. Also on my bookshelf are almost all of Billy Collins’ poetry, an old complete works of Emily Dickinson, poems by Rumi, and the Norton Anthology of Poetry, 4th edition, along with many other books of and about poetry.\n\nDo the Internet and social media contribute to the well-being of poetry?\n\nI believe so, though I couldn’t say how at the moment. Or, rather, I can’t tell whether the net effect is positive or negative. But like any major cultural force, it does have impact on art. So much is more readily accessible than before this digital information age. Quoting is a pastime for many. And yet, the impulse to speak constantly to others, to comb and scroll and scan through endless talk must also diminish the preciousness of words. We increasingly employ the short form in communicating with one another—the sound bite, tweet, Facebook shout-out, Instagram posting—but that doesn’t make it poetic, any more than reading print copies of novels makes us necessarily more poetic.\n\nWhere can one find you on the Internet?\n\nBlog: “Philosofishal”\n\nTwitter @Carrielt37\n\nFacebook: Carrie Tangenberg\n\nLinkedIn: Carrie Tangenberg, Writer, Tutor\n\nDo you have any non-poetry/writing creative outlets?\n\nMy most prevalent non-writing hobby would probably have to be photography. I like to draw occasionally. I’ll paint a picture every once in a while, but not without guidance; I’ve enjoyed a couple of those wine and painting events. I love color in general, so I dabble in home decorating, gardening, coloring books, and the occasional craft project.\n\nPlease share an original poem.\n\n“Ode to Cantwell” by Carrie Tangenberg © 6/9/01, revised 4/10/16, 11/3/17\n\nFirst composed at Cantwell Cliffs, Hocking Hills State Park, south central Ohio\n\nFerns cry up the greenest\n\nmoss-kissed stones I’ve seen.\n\nFellows dress in fringe,\n\nand cascade merriment.\n\nVelvet mats outdo\n\na frond-sprawl of delight—\n\nin one vale, fresh spinach,\n\nanother, shamrock shake (or\n\nis that lichen?), then lime\n\ngreen Jell-O, young\n\navocado—ever glad\n\nin rained-soaked shade.\n\nIf trees are chefs and servants,\n\nthen falls of ale ensconce\n\na vast buffet, inviting\n\ncalls to Cantwell Cliffs.\n\nNo hearth yet in view,\n\nwe walk, my love and I,\n\ngrasp at crags and creases.\n\nA share of these replaces\n\nclasping hands—too fraught,\n\ndespite appeasing warmth.\n\nPlump rock faces, deep-\n\nset stoned eyes, cliff chins,\n\ntalus noses, unkempt\n\njoyful, bearded jaws\n\nof giant height (or depth),\n\nbouldered, flaunt their black-\n\nand-green tartan patterns,\n\nlike heady Guinness pints\n\nwrapped in Beltane bands.\n\nWe lurk the upper lip\n\nand scarce escape the teeth.\n\nOne walking stick—scepter-\n\nshaped, a hovering torch—\n\nguides a canty man\n\naskance our emerald path.\n\nSwift, glad and keen,\n\nearthen steps from rod to\n\nroot, his wordless cant:\n\n“I am the fateful ambler,\n\nchief of my migration,\n\ngod of my life and strife.\n\nI come here to be, to pass,\n\nto climb, to stir green trails\n\nto sight and sense, imbibe\n\nand feast in any weather,\n\nhearth or no, till I’m full\n\nand satisfied. I’m noble\n\nbut free, for I leave it all\n\nhere, fulsome as before.\n\n“Though I look not behind,\n\nI know return is rare.”\n\nSerrated plumage wags\n\nat slightest breath of man.\n\nUntrod, the mosses cling.\n\nEbullient, verdant things."
