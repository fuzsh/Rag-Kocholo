        "text": "Lindsay Lohan and Samantha Ronson, left, attend the Charlotte Ronson 2009 Spring Collection in Bryant Park during Fashion Week in New York. (AP Photo/Peter Kramer, file)\n\nIn a year when gay marriage was legalized in California (at least briefly), a New York comedian became forever linked with the governor of Alaska, and once-fierce presidential opponents cozied up by year’s end, one could say 2008 stood out for unique pairings.\n\nSame for pop culture — and that’s not even considering the presidential pairings or the legions of strangely named twins born to celebrities in 2008.\n\nPreviously confirmed man-lover Lindsay Lohan sustained her longest relationship, only this time with a woman. John Mayer, who’s bedded just about every young starlet in Hollywood, seemed to finally settle down with a woman nearly a decade older than he is. After he dumped her.\n\nMadonna and baseball star Alex Rodriguez discarded their spouses, seemingly for each other, amid a swirl of strange stories. “The Hills'” Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt staged nauseating, thematic, faux-romantic photo ops almost daily, until they apparently staged their own wedding by the end of the year. And even stranger, Britney Spears spent the year not paired with anyone.\n\nA candidate for America’s sweetheart, Anne Hathaway, broke up with her longtime beau, just before he was indicted, and Hulk Hogan’s estranged 49-year-old wife, Linda, dated a skateboard-toting teenager. Meanwhile, to the astonishment of everyone on the planet and probably beyond, young and beautiful Megan Fox continued dating former “Beverly Hill 90210” actor Brian Austin-Green.\n\nSo, because there aren’t enough meaningless awards given out this time of year, allow us to add to the fray. Only we’ll concentrate on the year of the odd, unique or downright mind-boggling pairings.\n\nThe “Holy Cow, Did I Really Do That?” Award: John Mayer broke up with Jennifer Aniston in August and blogged about it like a whiny cheerleader. Then he woke up and got her back a couple of months later. Runner up: Mutt Lange, the music producer who somehow decided to cheat on his wife of 14 years, the gorgeous and talented Shania Twain, with his “house manager.” That brilliant decision may or may not have something to do with him now being single.\n\nThe “What’s Your Name “… Oh What the Hell, Let’s Get Married” Award: Nick Cannon and Mariah Carey dated for six weeks before marrying in May. And, because they knew each other so well, immediately got tattoos of each other’s names. Later, while probably wearing prom clothes, giggling and pawing each other, they admitted to not having sex until they got married. What are these two “… 17?\n\nThe “Is She Really Going Out With Him?” Award: Imagine, of all the men in her life, Paris Hilton was tamed by relatively low-key Benji Madden of punk-pop band Good Charlotte. And they managed to stay together most of the year.\n\nThe “Surprise Turnabout of the Year” Award: Lindsay Lohan, who was known to like men so much she’d play tonsil hockey with two or three a night, settling down with diminutive DJ Samantha Ronson, who isn’t a man but wears lots of hats. Not that there’s anything wrong with hats.\n\nThe “Supreme Object of Hollywood Beer Goggles” Award: David Spade, who once dated Heather Locklear, begrudgingly admitted he fathered a child in August with a Playboy bunny, then dated Nicolette Sheridan by fall. David Spade? That David Spade? The government has its best scientists working on this mystery and there are still no answers. Runner-up: Marilyn Manson, who broke up with 21-year-old Evan Rachael Wood in November after a year, and after being with, among others, Dita Von Teese and Rose McGowen.\n\nThe “Trendy, Fictional Pairing of the Year” Award: Sarah Silverman, who made a video for boyfriend Jimmy Kimmel breaking the fictitious news that she was (bleeping) Matt Damon. We almost laughed as hard when Kimmel responded with his own video, revealing that he was (bleeping) Damon’s best pal, Ben Affleck. Then Silverman and Kimmel mysteriously broke up after five years. They were back together by fall, presumably (bleeping) no one else but each other.\n\nThe “Who Do You Think You’re Fooling?” Award: Many winners here, starting with underage Miley Cyrus, who dated Nick Jonas at year’s beginning and was with a 20-year-old singing underwear model by year’s end. Meanwhile, purity-ring-wearing Jonas started dating purity ring-wearing Selena Gomez. And supposedly none of these extremely good-looking, hormonal and famous young folks under contract to Disney weret having sex. Sounds a lot like that Britney Spears person a decade ago, who was only having sex when she wasn’t telling interviewers she was saving herself.\n\nThe “Nobody Knows Me But Famous Chicks” Award: Justin Long, who dated Drew Barrymore for a year before they broke up in July, immediately went to clubs to make out with Kirsten Dunst and Tila Tequila, who still hasn’t decided if she wants to pair up with a man, a woman, or maybe Lindsay Lohan. Who’s Justin Long? He’s that guy in “… you know, those commercials “… and that movie.\n\nThe “Don Johnson-Melanie Griffith Reconciliations Should Be Illegal” Award: Kate Hudson and Owen Wilson, who reconciled after their 2007 breakup might have factored into Wilson’s suicide attempt. It’s always a great idea to revisit a relationship that almost killed someone. She moved on before any permanent damage was done. Runners-up: Michael Bolton and Nicolette Sheridan. Already leading next year’s balloting: Sean Penn and Robin Wright, who reconciled a month after filing for divorce in April. In 2008 Penn was connected with everyone from young Russian models to Lindsay Lohan who, as far as we know, now likes women. Not that there’s anything wrong with that.\n\nThe “‘Til Death Do We Part “… Now Please Die” Award: Eddie Murphy and Tracey Edmonds, who got married in January in Bora Bora, then split up before their guests went home. It was actually two weeks, which was still longer than “Meet Dave” was in theaters.\n\nThe “Make Up Your Mind, Already” Award: Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams, the co-stars of the dreamy romance film “The Notebook,” gave fans a tremendous thrill by rekindling their storybook relationship over the summer. They reversed field in November, broke up, and caused millions to weep and tragically question whether love exists at all.\n\nThere’s still hope. There’s always next year.\n\nReach Tony Hicks at thicks@bayareanewsgroup.com. Read his blog, “Insert Foot,” on www.ibabuzz.com/tonyhicks.\n\nOriginally Published: December 26, 2008 at 6:31 p.m."
