It brought the brothers to his bedside while he recuperated and led to their film collaborations, which have included “Devil” and “Quarantine.” The 2006 Thailand trip nearly got some of the family involved in a government meltdown, which is the subject of “No Escape,” opening in theaters Wednesday.\n\n“Right as we got there, a coup happened. They overthrew the prime minister and generals took over the government,” said John, who traveled to Thailand with his dad (Drew was at a friend’s wedding in Scotland at the time). That trip sent his mind back to his previous trip to Thailand with his family.\n\n“We had been there before with my two little sisters, Lindsay and Claire, who we call the Beeze,” John Dowdle says. “The whole time I was there in 2006, I was thinking what that would have been like if I were a dad who was there with two little kids.”\n\nThat is what happens in “No Escape.” Jack and Annie Dwyer (Owen Wilson and Lake Bell) relocate to an unnamed southeast Asian country with their daughters, Lucy and Beeze, and are immediately swept into a violent overthrow of the government, one that specifically targets outsiders from America.\n\nThe Dowdles’ script for “No Escape” (they co-write, but John directs the movies and Drew produces) began coming together not long after the 2006 trip. By 2008, they were ready to make a trip to Cambodia and Thailand to look for locations — even though they were on their own dime because, at that point, no movie studio had signed up to pay for the trip.\n\n“That was the first bad decision,” joked Drew, who was in the Twin Cities earlier this week with his brother to do interviews and host a screening of the thriller. (Another Dowdle brother, Ryan, worked as a wardrobe assistant on the film.) “But a lot of the details in the movie come directly from that trip. We shot 10,000 photos …”\n\n“… and we recorded sounds in the jungle. All of that kind of stuff was useful,” added John, who, like his brother, is a graduate of St. Paul’s St. Thomas Academy (John in 1991, Drew in 1993).\n\nAs they worked to put together financing, the brothers moved on to other projects, but “No Escape” — originally known as “The Coup” — remained in the back of their minds. And it has turned out to be a lucky thing it did. After more than a decade of working on low-budget productions, “No Escape” — both their biggest-budget movie and the one with the biggest stars (Pierce Brosnan is also in the film, playing a shadowy stranger) — has earned them the Hollywood attention they’ve been hoping for all those years.\n\nHaving been slotted in a low-budget horror niche, the Dowdles said now they’re getting meetings for more prestigious material: political thrillers, adventures based on true stories and adaptations of novels. They have four projects in the works, any of which could be ready to go later this year if studio backing comes together. At least one of those projects would be a natural to shoot in northern Minnesota.\n\n“We’d love to shoot a project here. We’ve talked to the (Minnesota) film board a lot,” said John, noting that where they make their movies usually comes down to which state or country can offer the best incentives package to the studio. “We’d really love to work with them to make it an easier place to shoot.”\n\nWhichever of those projects the Dowdles proceed with, it’s likely little snippets of their lives will creep into it. In addition to memories of their younger sisters, “No Escape” is also influenced by John’s son and daughter with his wife, Stacy Chbosky, an actress who plays two small roles in the film — and who, John gleefully noted, gets killed in both of them. The kinds of decisions that parents must make are peppered throughout the film as the Dwyers struggle to survive.\n\n“We like to say the movie is a metaphor for raising kids,” John said of a charged “No Escape” scene in which one parent tries to protect the kids from their new, violent reality while the other insists the children need to know what’s going on. “You want to teach the kids about life but, at the same time, you also don’t want them to be afraid all the time.”\n\nWhile they’re on the run, the Dwyers try to balance those two impulses, learning what could be called extreme parenting. Not surprisingly, they are most successful at evading their pursuers when they work together.\n\nEven the little girls end up contributing, unexpectedly, to the effort to keep their family alive. That happens in a scene where the family tries to read a map that’s printed in a language they don’t understand — a scene that also was loosely inspired by the Dowdles’ youth in Highland Park.\n\n“Our little sister, Lindsay, would come up with things out of nowhere all the time,” Drew said.\n\n“I remember one time in high school you started a grease fire and you’re running around, not knowing what to do and she’s like, ‘Baking soda!’ ” added John.\n\nThat sort of problem-solving ability is evident throughout “No Escape,” which is a thriller but which also says that no matter what adventure you’re on — whether making a movie, recuperating from a plane crash or surviving the violent overthrow of a government — it helps to have family on your side.\n\nChris Hewitt can be reached at 651-228-5552.
