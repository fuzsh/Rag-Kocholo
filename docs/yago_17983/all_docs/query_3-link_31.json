        "text": "Tomie: Unlimited (富江 アンリミテッド) is a 2011 Japanese horror film directed by Noboru Iguchi and written by Iguchi and Jun Tsugita and is the eighth instalment of the Tomie film series based on Junji Ito’s manga of the same name. In this a photography student's life takes a turn for the worse when her dead sister is welcomed back into the family home. The series overall focuses on the titular Tomie Kawakami, a beautiful young girl who drives her stricken admirers to madness, often resulting in her own death. However, due to her ability of regeneration, she comes back to life to terrorize her killers.\n\nThere is one thing I can always be sure of, and that is that anything that comes out of Japan is going to get an intense emotional response from me. If you are a watcher of international cinema then you will know Japan is known for producing some supremely fucked up, creepy, disturbing films and Tomie: Unlimited is no exception, and no one told me this was part of a series. The movie comes right out the gate and there are no holds barred. My first thought was, “the acting is surprisingly good”, but that was quickly followed with “why does everything look like they slapped a Valencia filter on it?” which was then followed by “wow these are some of the worst visual and practical effects I have ever seen”. With all of that in mind, I can tell you with 100% certainty I did not get this movie, at all.\n\nNow knowing that it is part of a franchise and what the franchise subject matter is, it does put the movie into perspective which I appreciate it, because it does make certain aspects make sense but ultimately, I still wasn’t getting it. I was literally spending the whole movie bouncing between “oh I think I get it”, “I don’t get it”, “no, wait, I think I got it”, “I definitely don’t got it”. This movie succeeds at being creepy as hell, there is one scene in particular that (regardless of what you think of the movie), is undoubtedly creepy, disturbing and can definitely induce nightmares. So, in that regard the movie is a success.\n\nThe music and score choices for this film were utterly bizarre, and frankly off putting. If I was to close my eyes I could swear I was watching an episode of Sailor Moon, but then I would open my eyes to see a giant, badly CGI’d centipede made of hair and human faces and that confirmed I was most definitely not watching Sailor Moon. Sometimes the music was this sweet, lovely, bright melody that did not remotely reflect the tone of the bizarre things that were happening on the screen. In another scene the music playing would be what I might describe as soft rock, which also did not fit the scene either. It was just a mixture of incredibly bad decisions that prevented me from ever taking this film seriously during the one hour and twenty-five minutes of which I was watching it.\n\nWhile it is creepy I didn’t feel like the creepy aspects served a purpose and a lot of the techniques and imagery used didn’t make any sense. It also felt like the plot was never truly established and nothing ever explained why all of this is happening and then by the end of it I stopped expecting that to ever happen, I just accepted more fucked up shit was going to happen and I just have to deal with it. The actors sold the fuck out of this movie, I don’t know what they were selling, but I bought it. I also kept the receipt and plan to return it (metaphorically speaking). This was just nuts, I was expected disturbing, but not bat shit crazy, so overall, I didn’t enjoy watching this. I’m usually someone who loves watching something disturbing or creepy, but this just didn’t do it for me so for all the reasons above and the fact that I watched the whole thing, I give Tomie: Unlimited a rating of 1/5 crystal balls."
