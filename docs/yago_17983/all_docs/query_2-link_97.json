        "text": "Frederick Stiehl\n\nReview of Iguchi Noboru’s Live\n\nThe Korean Premiere of cult director Iguchi Noboru’s Live was held at this year’s Pucheon International Fantastic Film Festival (PiFan). The “Beloved Director of PiFan,” this year represents Iguchi’s fourth trip to the festival (Yoon Ena, PiFan Daily, 7/24/2014). Also appearing at Montreal’s FanTasia Film Festival, Live has been making the rounds internationally, along with his other 2014 film Gothic Lolita Battle Bear (the latter was not screened at PiFan). Director of films such as Machine Girl (2008) and Dead Sushi (2012) (As well as having a hand in filming the commercial segments of Nishimura Yoshihiro’s cult favorite Tokyo Gore Police (2008)), Iguchi Noburo is known for an exploitation-film style that is both highly ridiculous and gory. What other director would have a scantily dressed woman on roller skates with a wrist-mounted crossbow fighting a college-age gymnast with a pair of chainsaw gloves?\n\nFilled with blood and gore, the tacky special effects make Noburo’s films intentionally hilarious – a true guilty pleasure.\n\nLive does depart from Iguchi’s previous works in its more serious tone. Drawing from the popular novel by Yusuke Yamada, Trouble child Tamura Naoto leaves his mother’s home after a fight and moves to Tokyo. One day, after receiving a mysterious package containing the film’s eponymous book, he receives a phone call from a stranger, who has kidnapped his mother and threatens to kill her if he does not follow hints in the book, effectively reenacting the novel. Uncovering his first clue, he finds that many others – all with names similar to the characters in the novel – are in the same situation and only the winner of the race can save their family. More than a simple marathon, the racers find themselves at the mercy of deadly traps and eventually each other – a death game in the tradition of Battle Royale (Fukasaku Kinji, 2000) and The Running Man (Paul Michael Glaser, 1987). The contestants work together to survivor the course, but must constantly be on watch for their opponents who will do anything to save their loved ones.\n\nHeavily centered on themes of family devotion, forgiveness and self-sacrifice, Live is a much more serious film than many of Iguchi’s previous works (which is very much a relative statement). These themes are well developed in each of the contestants, and even the archetypical ‘stock’ characters, often parodies of themselves, are given personality, characterization, and nuance to even the minor contestants. Comedy acting isn’t about acting silly, but about being serious about the most absurd of characters or circumstances, and the heavily stylized acting of much of the supporting cast combines and contrasts excellently with the sincere and natural style of the main characters. In a blend of ultraviolence, outrageous humor, and sentimentality, Live offers a narrative which is simultaneously entertaining and endearing.\n\nWhile Iguchi’s signature heavy gore is far from absent, it is comparatively subdued. With its thematic concerns and shifted emphasis away from the exploitation genre, Live is an attempt to appeal both to diehard horror fans as well as a general audience. Certainly more tame than a lot of Iguchi’s previous works, at times I worry that he might not have split the baby. With its over-the-top gore, dismemberment, and sexual content (while there is no nudity, the former JAV director certainly does not shy away from gratuitous close-ups of bras and panties), the film may not appeal to everyone, but anyone who is familiar with Iguchi’s previous works, or with a slightly off-color sense of humor, will be more than entertained. Between the gore and irreverent humor, Live can be as gross as it is juvenile – and I loved every minute of it."
