That there must be some malfunction in your brain, causing you to see something that isn't there. That there is no way, this is the intended message your eyes are sending to your brain.\n\nThose are the exact thoughts and feelings that went through my head while watching the trailer for Noboru Iguchi's new film Robo Geisha. Following up his similarly themed Machine Girl and Tokyo Gore Police films. I haven't seen any of his other films, but apparently they are just as bloody and ridiculous.\n\nThis is exactly what I sent to fellow reporter Dr Venkman via instant message, after viewing the trailer.\n\nThat's one of the most ridiculous things I've ever seen... Buildings were bleeding!\n\na girl got stabbed in the ass\n\na man was blinded with fried shrimp\n\nI don't know how to express my shock in words!"
