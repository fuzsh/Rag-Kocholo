        "text": "Official Title: Kataude Mashin Garu\n\nDirector: Noburo Iguchi\n\nStarring: Minase Yashiro, Asami, Honoka, Yuya Ishikawa, Ryosuke Kawamura\n\nRating: 18 (Unrated)\n\nCompany: Fever Dreams\n\nDuration: 96 minutes\n\nFilms can drag out the most obscure and intense emotions out of a viewer, all designed to stimulate the senses. Horror movies are made intending to frighten people while comedy makes them laugh. But there are a strange few that truly baffles you in how to react. What appears to be horrifying can sometimes be seen as funny, mainly due to its strange style or approach to the subject matter, making you feel almost like some kind of sadist. Maybe it was due to the situation I was in when I watched this film being surrounded by other excited horror fans at 2am at the Dead By Dawn Horror Film Festival, holding a pint of Guinness in one hand and a bag of sweet and buttery popcorn in the other. But when I saw the opening sequence to this Japanese Horror Comedy Exploitation flick called ‘The Machine Girl’… I thought it was the most amazing movie I have ever witnessed!\n\nThe plot of this film is to that found at the bottom of a bargain bin, following all the cliches of the revenge genre combined with the madness of Kung Fu movies similar to ‘The Story of Ricky’. A typical Japanese schoolgirl called Ami is forced to take care of his younger brother after their parents killed themselves due to the pressures of a homicide investigation as a means of ‘defending their honour’. The brother and his best friend are harshly bullied by the son of a powerful Yakuza boss, known famously for his Ninja heritage. When he and his friend gets killed by this gang of punks, Ami goes on a hellbent mission to seek revenge by killing off everyone involved, leading right towards the source of the super Ninja family. Right, so as you can see this ain’t your average bedtime story. The plot itself slowly becomes irrelevant and quite literally takes a logical backseat. This simple yet completely uninspiring story is just there to set up for the extremely gory and hilarious set-pieces the film goes through. To be honest, this film seems to have all the features of a bad movie with the practically dire drama queen acting, stupidly underdeveloped plot and lack of any message or theme… but it is amazing purely because of all the ingenious death sequences and graphically in-your-face gore!\n\nThe insanely over the top gore completely boggles the mind as to how they were able to get away with it. This film becomes so violent, intense and graphic that it gets to the realm of the ridiculous, with most of the body horror appearing like bad slapstick comedy. This would fall under the category that films such as the ‘Evil Dead’ trilogy, ‘El Mariachi’ trilogy and ‘Planet Terror’ would feel right at home in, having lots of influences from them. There is a sequence where Ami gets her arm sliced off accidentally by a samurai sword. As she drags her now arm-less body towards some shelter, she stumbles across the brother’s best friend’s parents, who conveniently happen to be mechanics and great martial artists. From the remains of her arm, they were able to build and attach a huge machine gun to it, creating an almost indestructible force. Getting in the way of this awesome weapon will leave you having precious body parts physically ripped and destroyed, all in a glorious squatting fountains of over pressurized blood. Now, on paper that sounds just horrible, but onscreen it is one of the most astonishingly cool sight you’ll ever witness. And it gets better… or worse even. Once the characters are set, chaos breaks loose with all rational thought left in this film thrown out the window, leaving a visual shell of insanity. There are Ninjas, Chainsaws, Flying Claws, Torture and horribly cruel Punishment all round, ending in by far the oddest weapon ever invented… the Drill Bra.\n\n‘The Machine Girl’ is not really a film for anybody. It is a film that is too violent and gory for a mainstream audience, too low budget and independent to be given any kind of hype and it is too insanely stupid to be taken seriously at all. This film is one of those rare finds that will completely divide people. If you watch this movie and get the urge to laugh aloud at a man getting disemboweled by a chainsaw, then you are officially a part of an odd but amazing club of insane gore nuts. I had a wonderful time watching this film, clapping away at the ludicrous antics happening on the screen, making me a part of the violent elite. If you watch the first 10 minutes of the film and not enjoy a second of it, this film is not for you and I would recommend you stop watching it. But if you find it amazing, then stick around and you’ll be taken on an insane illogical roller-coaster ride that will get you all excited, crying with laughter by the really cheap but extremely gory special effects. It is the perfect modern exploitation film gem."
