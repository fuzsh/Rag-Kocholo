        "text": "High school ninja clubs, tempura arms, a flying guillotine and flesh ripping bras it’s easy to see why it’s already become a cult classic…\n\nMinase Yashiro stars as schoolgirl Ami Hyuga, whose world is turned upside down after she seeks to find the truth behind the supposed suicide of her brother and his closest friend. She soon finds out that her brother Yu was bullied and then killed by school thugs led by son of the local yakuza.\n\nFailing to get any sympathy from the parents of her brother’s friend, nor justice from the police, she confronts one of the gang members in his home only to find his parents far more psychotic and dangerous. Stepping over the line, bloody revenge is her only path. However, despite her keen kung fu skills, she’s no match for the yakuza, who torture her and cut off one of her hands before she barely manages to escape.\n\nFinally finding refuge at the garage belonging to her brother’s friend, the mother Miki (Asami) and her husband agree to help her get revenge, building a custom machine gun for her lost hand, they plan to turn the tables on the yakuza. (It helps that Miki is rather proficient with a chainsaw.) One things for sure, it’s gonna get pretty messy…\n\nOkay, so let’s be clear about this: if you can’t make it through the opening titles of The Machine Girl, then you’d better steer clear of this blood spattered fest altogether. With hands sliced off, heads graphically blown apart, director Noboru Iguchi (Sukeban Boy, Robo-geisha) sets outs the films manifesto pretty quickly: old-school exploitation, grindhouse style! (Unsurprisingly that’s brought comparisons to Robert Rodriguez’s half of the Grindhouse movie Planet Terror, particularly with its mechanical appendages.)\n\nDespite low-budget concerns (or perhaps because of them) Machine Girl delights in a celebration of gruesome bloodletting. Think of it as part slocky update of Zhang Che’s One-armed Swordsman, more wholesale gore in the mould of Sam Rami’s Evil Dead 2 or Peter Jackson’s Brain Dead, and you soon start to get the picture. This is over-the-top violence in the extreme, all in the worst possible taste, and definitely not to be taken seriously. A welcome relief from the ‘scary haircut girl’ that’s become such a recurring trait of Asian horror, it feels like someone has finally picked up the baton from Ryuhei Kitamura’s Versus.\n\nHowever, amongst the genuine fun director Noboru has with the material, some of the elements he throws on the screen seem a little misplaced or superfluous. There’s the back-story about Ami Hyuga’s parents having committed suicide after being framed for a murder they didn’t commit, for instance. More disturbing are some of the entirely unnecessary elements, like necrophilia and a suggested rape scene. Under the gallons of blood there are also a few interesting asides, like the fact the parents in general are a lot crazier and lethal than their children, and that Ami’s vengeance breeds vengeance as the parents seek to avenge their son’s deaths.\n\nWith other recent films like Ryuhei Kitamura’s X-Cross and the upcoming Yoshihiro Nishimura’s Tokyo Gore Police and Yudai Yamaguchi’s Meatball Machine, this unquestionably marks a turn in Japanese low-budget horror against the wave of US ‘torture porn’ towards more enjoyably super exaggerated, utterly preposterous gore – just like they used to make in the old days.\n\nIt might not be for everyone, but The Machine Girl seems like a pretty good start to Cine Asia’s Extreme label…\n\nHome media details\n\nDistributor:Cine Asia Extreme (UK)\n\nLike the US release, the Cine Asia Extreme DVD features a good transfer of the main feature. There’s little in the way of extras, especially in comparison with the Japanese release. An informative behind-the-scenes, and a few trailers.\n\nMost disappointing still is the absence of the short spin-off movie, The Hajirai Machine Girl (aka Shyness Machine Girl), which would have been a real treat for fans who’ve already caught this movie at festivals."
