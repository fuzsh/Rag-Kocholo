        "text": "Happinet announced on Thursday that it is producing a live-action film adaptation of Shūzō Oshimi's The Flowers of Evil (Aku no Hana) manga in collaboration with NTT Plala. Noboru Iguchi (The Machine Girl, Yamishibai: Japanese Ghost Stories, The World Yamizukan) is directing the film, while Mari Okada (anohana, The Anthem of the Heart, Maquia) is penning the script. Phantom Film is in charge of the film's production, and another partner, Kadokawa Daiei Studio, is handling distribution and publicity. The film will open next year.\n\nVertical published the manga in North America, and it describes the story:\n\nBookworm takao falls in love with Nanako, but he cannot express his feelings through words. Instead he secretively acts out in a heat of passion which creates a huge scandal in his school. There is one person who knows his true nature, and this girl will do anything to nurture what this Charles Baudelaire hides.\n\nOshimi (Inside Mari, Happiness) launched the manga in Kodansha's Bessatsu Shōnen Magazine in 2009 and ended the series in the June 2014 issue. Crunchyroll streamed the anime adaptation as it aired in Japan in 2013. Sentai Filmworks released the anime on home video in 2014.\n\nOshimi's Inside Mari manga inspired a live-action series adaptation in March 2017, and his Drifting Net Café also inspired a live-action series in 2009. His Sweet Poolside manga inspired a live-action film in 2014."
