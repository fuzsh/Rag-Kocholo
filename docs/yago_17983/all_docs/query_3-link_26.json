The plot - oh screw it, this movie is about a high school girl who gains a gatling-gun-arm, and there's ninjas, flying guillotines, a drill bra, and more blood than you've ever seen before. Where do the hell do they come up with this stuff? Only over there across the Pacific, I guess I'd say. This could end up being \"the cult film of next\", but my only question is when the hell will we be able to see it?! At least this trailer will hold us over.\n\nWatch the trailer for The Machine Girl:\n\n[flv:machine_girl.flv 480 270]\n\nThe Machine Girl is both written and directed by Noboru Iguchi, of other crazy Japanese films like Cat-Eyed Boy, Sukeban Boy, and Kazuo Umezu's Horror Theater: The Harlequin Girl. The film doesn't have a US distributor or any release dates yet, but I hope in some way, shape, or form it makes its way here."
