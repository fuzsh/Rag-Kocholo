The double-disc blu-ray destroyer will be locked and loaded on June 25th!\n\nTHE MACHINE GIRL: JACKED!- Ami is your average schoolgirl trying to provide a normal life for her younger brother and herself following the tragic death of their parents. But her whole world comes crashing down when her brother and his friend are brutally murdered by a ruthless gang of bullies headed by the spoiled brat son of a local yakuza boss! When Ami sets out to avenge her slain sibling, she soon finds herself over her head and minus a left arm! Bleeding profusely and barely alive after a vicious yakuza attack, Ami seeks shelter at an auto repair garage where two sympathetic mechanics take pity on her and help rehabilitate her. To aid her in her unrelenting quest for revenge, they fit her arm stump with a custom prosthetic arm that sports a high-powered rotary machine gun! Ami meets and teams up with the equally vengeful mom of her dead brother’s slain friend, and together they wage an unholy two-woman war against the yakuza’s deadliest hitmen and an army of lethal ninja assassins in the cinema’s greatest all-out apocalyptic bloodbath! Extras include behind-the-scenes footage and the trailer. This edition features the recent HD remastered edition with noticeable improvement in picture resolution.

When Yoshie is attacked and abducted by the buxom but deadly Battle-Bust Sisters, Dharma brutally amputates Ami’s arm, leaving her for dead– unconscious and profusely bleeding! With the help of professional hit-man-for-hire Matsukata, Ami is more determined than ever to get revenge! Meanwhile, Dharma has transformed her sister Yoshie into a cyborg programmed to kill! Soon, the clan conflict escalates into a hyper-violent bullets-and-blood ballet! Will Ami rescue her sister and restore her humanity? Extras include- behind-the-scenes, still gallery and trailers.

THE JAPANESE CULT HIT THAT UNLEASHED AND SPAWNED A TIDAL WAVE OF EXTREME ASIAN ACTION-GORE WANNABES!”\n\n“A riotous blend of arterial spray and grindhouse glee.” - Jeanette Catsoulis, The New York Times\n\n“Nonstop violence, gallons of spurting blood, outrageous humor (a kitchen scene is a hoot), extreme vomiting, a drill bra, human sushi and tempura, and other perversity.” - V.A. Musetto, New York Post\n\n“Shameless gore, gallows humor and guilty pleasures are the byproducts of a mechanical plot and impressive helming.” - Russell Edwards, Variety\n\n“Director Noboru Iguchi delivered what might be the actual definition of a bloodbath. The amount of blood we get to see sprayed, blasted, poured, and gushing every time we blink our eyes is enough to tickle the fancy of even the most desensitized movie-goer out there. The action comes quick and the blood comes fast… you will surely be entertained. - The Dude, denofgeek.com\n\n“This movie is funny, fast, and furious and for those unfamilar with Asian movies, think of this as the last half hour of Kill Bill Volume 1 with a little of Planet Terror mixed in.” - Matthew Brown, Home Theater Forum\n\n“Its extreme absurdities are often what make it so entertaining. The Machine Girl won’t be for everyone, but it is stupid, bloody fun for those who love cheesy action and gory insanity. ” - Chris Sawin, reelrundown.com\n\nRISE OF THE MACHINE GIRLS\n\n“Highly imaginative reboot… a bloodsoaked thrill…” - HK Cine Fan\n\n“RISE OF THE MACHINE GIRLS is loads of fun to watch, basically because it seems to know no bounds, it's crazy for crazy's sake, and it seems to serve every Japanese crazy-movie fetish, from school girls to upskirt pics to big guns to body horror to gallons of gore, with a gusto and a wink at the audience. You'll feel splendidly entertained!” - SearchMyTrash.com\n\n“The film really hits its stride where a plethora of action set pieces arrive with numerous gun battles, excessive stunt work, and utterly impressive practical effects that make this a fine action-centered exploitation offering!- AsianMoviePulse.com\n\n“An extremely bloodthirsty revenge campaign against cyborgs, assassins and the head of the organ dealers. What fun! RISE OF THE MACHINE GIRLS is pure, bloody entertainment.” - OutNow.ch\n\nABOUT MEDIA BLASTERS\n\nFor over twenty years, Media Blasters has been a leading independent publisher of popular anime and classic cult live-action programs on DVD, Blu-ray and for new media in North America.
