        "text": "Stars: Minase Yashiro, Asami, Nobuhiro Nishihara\n\nRun Time: 96 minutes\n\nThe film is done very much in the same style as Tokyo Gore Police, I’m almost certain if you liked that then you’ll also enjoy this one. The story is a fairly basic revenge story, when Yu Hyuga and his his friend Takeshi borrow money from the son of a Yakuza boss things go very wrong for them.\n\nUnable to pay the cash back the sadistic Sho Kimura and his goons beat the boys up but when they fight back he kills them. This leads Yu’s sister Ami to take up a revenge mission, she turns out to be tougher than you could imagine.\n\nBeautiful, Deadly and she’s got a fecking machine gun for an arm\n\nHowever her toughness is not enough and the Yakuza boss along with his wife and other goons capture Ami, torture her and chop her arm off. She manages to escape and is found passed out by two mechanics, they fix her up and replace her arm with a machine gun because why wouldn’t you?\n\nWith the help of the mechanic Miki, Ami sets out on a brutal and bloody revenge mission to murder those responsible for maiming her and killing her brother. When I say bloody I really mean bloody not Hollywood style kills but limbs and blood squirting all over the place by the gallons.\n\nThe two women on a revenge mission combined with the gore really make this film great fun\n\nIt all eventually leads to a show down with the Yakuza boss and his wife and son. Obviously I won’t spoil things for anyone who hasn’t seen it but the end battles are brilliantly fun to watch.\n\nThe Good\n\nMinase Yashiro as Ami and Asami as Miki are both great at playing the main characters seeking revenge.\n\nThere’s some really creative deaths.\n\nThe pace of the film is great, opening with some bloody action before building up the reasons for revenge then going all out bonkers.\n\nThe villains were over the top and fun to watch, the main Yakuza man looking like a younger version of Master Pain/Betty from Kung Pow.\n\nOuch!\n\nThe Bad"
