        "text": "Read all\n\nEven though Zombie Ass isn't part of the official Sushi Typhoon catalogue, it's very much in line with other Sushi Typhoon releases. Bad CG, horrible actors and a pretty amateurish finish are all part of the deal, but in return you get some of the weirdest, sickest and funniest moments ever caught on film. If there ever was a \"so bad it is good\" flick, this one is definitely it.\n\nIguchi expands on the short he entered in the ABCs of Death anthology (F is for Fart). Never before has a director explored the CG fart in such devastating depths and with such great conviction. Ironically the longer running time actually plays in Iguchi's favor here, as the ever-increasing sense of embarrassment really adds to the fun. Not that the entire film is about farts, there are also a bunch on toilet zombies and a group of anal tentacles to balance out the narrative. Great art this is not, but if you're looking for 90 minutes of mind-blowing weirdness, Zombie Ass is a must see.\n\nRead all\n\nThe performances are pretty bad, the film looks cheap and the plot makes no sense at all. It's pretty funny that the director looks a bit like Kawase I guess (considering what surfaced about her), but it's minor tidbits like that which have to make the film somewhat bearable. Devoted Iguchi fans might want to watch this, but I can't see anyone actively liking this film."
