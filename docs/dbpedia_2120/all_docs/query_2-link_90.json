        "text": "Marcel van Eeden, invests once again in the In Situ gallery.\n\nMachine/Machinery, his new proposal, brings together a selection of new and relatively recent works. These works are all in the graphic and pictorial vein that characterize fully this Dutch artist who was born in 1965 and exemplifies the systematically real images of that age.\n\nNot just any image incidentally. The iconography for this artist for the last twenty years has been broad and open as reality itself, a reality that Marcel van Eeden addresses through reproduction. The images he chooses, archived by their graphic capture, are carefully selected from old newspapers, magazines, history books and textbooks, photographic funds and postcards. The act of creation here steams from a post-production reminiscent of the copier and the documentary. It takes less to invent an imaginary universe than to bring the viewer to a reinterpretation of the existing world, indefinitely multiplied by the images from the beginning of civilization to the cycles of mechanical reproduction.\n\nThis is to clarify, related to before-biography : the directory in which any photographic image or illustration precedes his date of birth of November 22nd, 1965.\n\nArranged in a series of moments, almost as if compiling many mundane objects and trivial scenes from cars or weapons to idyllic landscapes of animals, flowers, and food. His recent productions are stamped with the enigmatic words \"Machine/Machinery\" therefore giving this exhibition its general title. These colorful designs by Marcel van Eeden restore cryptically the time past, returning it in a hazy but suggestive manner. Their mode of production, calling on the recent history of art, is almost inseparable from the artistic concepts of repetition and indexation, a conceptual perspective, amid Andy Warhol's appropriation of the spirit of the \"factory\".\n\nMarcel van Eeden’s works are part of collections such as Centre Pompidou, Paris, The Museum of Modern Art, New York, Hamburger Kunsthalle, Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, Humblebæk, Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, Haags Gemeentearchief, The Hague, Teylers Museum, Haarlem, SØR Rusche Sammlung, Berlin, Kupferstichkabinett, Museum of Prints and Drawings, Berlin, Kunstmuseum St. Gallen, Switzerland, Centro de Arte Caja de Burgos, Spain, Glenbow Museum, Calgary, Museum Het Valkhof, Nijmegen, Sammlung Goetz, Muenchen …"
