        "text": "A Look at unlocking $750K incremental revenue on Amazon. I wanted to share a bit more advanced use case of using Skai's budget navigator as well as Helium 10 Listing builder to drive incremental ad revenue. Background: Monthly spend is “use it or loose it” with no month to month roll-over. Monthly budget is set at $75K for Amazon search with no flex between other channels like Walmart or Instacart. There is a separate Amazon DSP media budget. Last year’s total ROAS on Amazon was $3. The Ask: Find ways to unlock 750K in incremental revenue for the year across retail channels. Analysis: We ran an analysis across all retail channels to find growth opportunities, which included cap out reports, ad & organic placements, indexed keywords as well as weekly sales trends per product. Based on the analysis, we saw that Amazon had the biggest growth opportunity. Our campaigns were capping out early and we still had room to improve on both bid & product placements across key keywords. There was also an opportunity to optimize the listings with additional keywords. A clear weekly sales trend emerged showing sales started to pickup going into the weekend and peak on Saturdays. We saw a similar sales trend on all channels. Listing & Product Strategy: The top 8 products on Amazon captured 90% of sales each month, so we started optimizing the listings from the top down. On average we were able to increase the generated search volume for each product by 300K using Helium 10’s Listings Builder. Media Strategy: Adjust Amazon media spending to reflect the findings from analysis and ramp up budgets going into the weekend, peaking on Saturdays each week. Ensure spend allocation is still allowing for 50% to go towards category to continue increasing New-To-Brand sales. Launch rank campaigns for all newly added keywords and focus on wining the Amazon’s Choice badge for critical keywords. Set ROAS target for February to $3.5 and March - December to $4. Accomplished & Expected Results: December was spent completing the listing optimizations and January was focused on stabilizing the campaigns at $3.5 ROAS. The goal is to drive $75K in incremental ad revenue per month x 10 months + $36K for February, which should set us at $786K incremental revenue for the year. Limitations & Next Steps Starting in March the challenge will be to maintain a $4 ROAS for the rest of the year. BN is predicting we will be able to achieve our $4 ROAS goal in March, but we still have to account for out of stocks and competitor response. We should also see an up-tick in organic sales, which will help exceed our incremental revenue goal even further. Based on results, a similar approach will be done for other channels. Have questions on how to unlock incremental growth.

This is a quick case study I wanted to share on how I helped a client launch a new product invocation on Amazon and turned it into a $1MM a year revenue generator for the brand. For large 1P CPG brands 9 months may be a long time, but this was for a natural 3P brand. Background: Coming out of Covid the brand saw an opportunity to create a product that is complementary to their normal portfolio. They wanted to launch in late 2021 but global supply chain issues pushed the launch back to Q2 2022. We started with 0 reviews and were unsure if a sold cross selling strategy would provide any momentum. The Ask: Put together a product launch strategy with incremental monthly ROAS goals to get us to $100K a month in total revenue on Amazon. We unfortunately have no incremental budget to support the launch, so use the current monthly budget we have. Listing & Product Strategy: Product listing was fully optimized with copy, images, A+ and video. Product was priced extremely competitive in the market without sacrificing quality. To help with conversion, we placed a discount on the product so we can focus on velocity and generate reviews. Product was also submitted to vine. We shipped in a pallet of the product before launch and kept min 60 days worth of FBA inventory. Media Strategy: Since this was a new product innovation, we had zero product specific branded keywords to leverage. We had to go all in on category right from the start and focus on rank & velocity. As branded terms started to popup we would spend max 20% on brand. 80% of spend went towards category targeting & keywords. Challenges: Reviews came in slower than we had hoped, but the product was priced well enough to keep velocity going for the first 3 months. The biggest challenge was not having incremental budget for the launch. I had to set aside a specific % of budget each month dedicated to this product and pull spend from under performing campaigns. Results: Pairing media with a well priced high quality product created a recipe for success. Focusing on rank and category growth helped to accelerate top line sales and enabled us to reach our goal in 9 months. I still remember the days on Amazon where you could go from $0 - $100K in under 6 months. I feel like product review count has accelerated the last 2 years making launching new products a bit more challenging, especially if it’s a competitive category. I would love to hear how other people executed a launch like this. #retailmedia #amazon #success #sales #growth #amazonfba #amazonadvertising #amazonppc #mediastrategy #productlaunch #digitaladvertising #strategy\n\nCan you forecast ROAS of $40K increment spend on Amazon under 5min? Yes you can! Here is a basic Skai Budget Navigator Use Case. With some of Skai's advanced features, brands and advertisers are able to quickly ball park the expected return of either budget cuts or incremental investments. Background: Client has 57 products on Amazon across 384 live campaigns. Current Amazon PPC budget is $100K a month and we are focusing on category growth as the main PPC strategy. We under spent last month due to some out of stocks. Last month ROAS was $4.52 Ask: What would an expected ROI be on an incremental $40K? BN Forecast: With quick click of a button, we might expect to see a 10% decline in ROAS with the incremental investment. BN estimates a $4.03 ROAS for $140K spend based on past campaign performance. Limitations: The forecast does not take in consideration how competitor brands might react to your increase in spend or other factors like inventory & brand health issues. To be a bit more realistic, I would say the range might be 15% - 20% decline in ROAS. It also may not assign the spend according to our category growth strategy. I'll have to go in manually and adjust spend % for category portfolios. Next Steps: Create a media plan of how exactly we are going to spend the money. I'll need to provide specifics like spend distribution across the portfolio; what % will go towards category vs competitors vs brand etc. Using a couple other features and Skai dimensions I'm able to quickly pull the data I need to put the plan together. If you have questions on how to unlock incremental spend on Amazon with Skai, feel free to each out to me to any of the awesome Skai reps. #amazon #amazonadvertising #amazonads #skai #retailmedia #cpg #cpgmarketing #cpgbrands #mediastrategy #mediabuying #mediaplanning #digitaladvertising\n\nInstacart is a goldmine for new grocery brands! I wanted to share an awesome success story of how a brand used Instacart to unlock additional in-store distribution. They started with limited distribution on the East Coast, to having national distribution in 1.5 years. Background: This was a new brand that launched in a very competitive category and they only have 5 SKUs. Upon getting shelf placement in major grocery chains on the East Coast of the US, the brand had to increase sales velocity at shelf to unlock additional distribution. Instacart was a new channel activation for the brand. The goal was to unlock full national distribution within 2 years of launch. The Ask: Use a Test & Learn approach on Instacart to increase household penetration and in-store sales velocity. Media Strategy: With limited brand awareness at the time of launch, 100% of the budget went towards category growth. A floor and ceiling ROAS was set to allow for some flexibility. A “flex” spend approach was put in place across all retail media channels that also included Amazon, CitrusAd and Quotient. The intent was to shift spend in real-time based on performance. Challenges: Out of stocks and low competitive pricing promotions were the biggest issues the brand faced. Limitations: As we all know, Instacart does not provide attributed sales information on a retailer level. Impact of spend has to be high enough in-order for it to be seen on retailer sales reports. Results The growth focused media strategy paid off and the brand was able to unlock additional in-store distribution across the US in just 1.5 years, while generating $1.3MM in attributed revenue on Instacart from the time of launch. With the right approach, Instacart can help brands reach their retail distribution & revenue goals. If you are interested in Instacart, but unsure if it’s worth the investment, please let me know. I would be happy to talk through the capabilities & limitations of the platform. #instacart #retail #success #sales #growth #strategy #brand #media #cpg #retailmedia #mediastrategy #digitaladvertising #amazonadvertising #citrusad #quotient\n\nI wanted to share the power of Skai's Budget Navigator when your spend is running Super Hot! I got asked to slow down spend for a brand on Jan 17 when 93% of their Amazon PPC budget was already spent for the month. We needed to move quick but not pause campaigns. There were 75 products and 255 campaigns across 4 different brands. They were already on Skai, so I was able to leverage the Budget Navigator feature to ensure we come in on budget by the end of the month. Took me 15min to implement. Even though we are able to stay on budget for the month, the client will still need an explanation of why it was pacing so hot. SOV & sales velocity won't be great, but at least we'll be on budget... #skai #retailmedia #amazon #retailtechnology #amazonadvertising #ppcadvertising #mediabuying #mediaplanning #advertisingagency #cpg\n\nHow does Pinterest fit into my retail strategy? With TikTok being at the center of influencer marketing, brands are starting to create an exceptional amount of content for their products. Pinterest is a great way to repurpose some if that content and then link back to specific online retailers. Its a haven for affiliate marketers. The article by Profit Whales talks about promoting Amazon products, but you can use the same approach for Walmart, Instacart, Target, CVS, Walgreens etc. You may not be able to activate Rich Pins but all you need is a link and engaging content. Pinterest is all about creating engaging pins. My recommendation is to experiment with different pins to see if it makes sense for your brand. It could be a great way to drive off-site traffic to your product listings. https://lnkd.in/eeTZB2JW #retailmedia #retail #amazon #brand #strategy #influencermarketing #instacart #contentmarketingtips #contentmarketingstrategy #content #omnichannel #digitaladvertising #pinterest #pinterestmarketing #pinterestforbusiness"
