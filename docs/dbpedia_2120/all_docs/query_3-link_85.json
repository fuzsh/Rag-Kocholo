        "text": "23 November 2019 to 22 March 2020\n\n‘Meticulous, varied and intense work of great quality. Work that stays with you’: the glowing assessment in the jury report for the Ouborg Prize 2019. They refer to the oeuvre of artist Jeroen Eisinga, who on Friday 22 November will receive The Hague’s art prize which is awarded jointly by the city council, Kunstmuseum Den Haag and Stroom Den Haag. At the same time, an exhibition of Eisinga’s work entitled The Social Ladder will open and a publication of the same name will be launched at Kunstmuseum Den Haag.\n\nArtist Jeroen Eisinga (b. 1966) is ambitious, not easily satisfied and is constantly pushing boundaries. In his now iconic film Springtime (2011) he was covered in a swarm of around 150,000 bees. Every one of his productions is highly labour-intensive. His body of work is not large, therefore, but it is impressive nonetheless. His films have been shown at international festivals and arts venues, and now form part of a number of museum and private collections.\n\nThe Social Ladder\n\nJeroen Eisinga – The Social Ladder in Kunstmuseum Den Haag’s Projects Gallery, Eisinga will combine five films from the 1990s: 40-44-PG (1993), Grauzone (1995), The Most Important Moment of My Life (1995), Night Porter (1993) and The Social Ladder (1996 - 2019). This last film, from which the title of both the exhibition and the publication are taken, has never been screened publicly before. Besides the five films, visitors will also be given a glimpse of the research and preparations that are part of Eisinga’s making process. Sketchbooks containing 25 years of preparatory research will be on display. Some of them are like artworks in themselves.\n\nPublication"
