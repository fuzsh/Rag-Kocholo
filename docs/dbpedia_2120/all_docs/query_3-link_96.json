        "text": "LUBOK 11\n\nLubok 11 is one of a series of books printed from original linocuts, reproduced on a mechanical letterpress. The craftsmanship of the linocut is preserved in the end product. Lubok 11 is co-produced by Lubok Verlag, Leipzig and PrintRoom.\n\nParticipating artists: Damien Deroubaix, Sebastian Gögel, Irene Hanenbergh, Thomas Moecker, Olivia Plender, Marcel Ruijters, Jasper Sebastian Stürup, Koen Taselaar, Marcel van Eeden, Ewoud van Rijn, James Whitman and Christoph Ruckhäberle (cover image).\n\nLubok Verlag\n\nLubok Verlag was founded by the artist Christoph Ruckhäberle. The name Lubok is an allusion to cheap popular prints from Russia. Lubok Verlag aspires to make high-quality prints available to a mass market.\n\nThe collaboration between Rotterdam-based PrintRoom and Lubok Verlag began last year with an exhibition of all the Lubok publications. It was then that the idea of putting together a joint edition of the Lubok series with contributions from Dutch and foreign artists took shape.\n\nCoinciding with a number of openings in Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen there will be a book launch and pre-sale of Lubok 11 on Saturday 8 June, when the book will be priced at €45. You can also order a copy at PrintRoom until this day. After that date the book will be on sale in the museum shop, via Lubok’s webshop and at PrintRoom for €50.\n\nA large selection of Lubok 11 pages will be exhibited at Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen from June 8 trough September 1 2013.\n\nMore at Boijmans\n\nThe presentation of Lubok 11 is part of a packed contemporary art program in Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen. From 8 June, the museum not only presents Lubok 11, but also presents the anniversary exhibition 25 Years City Collection Rotterdam and the first edition of Sensory Spaces with Oscar Tuazon (USA 1975). This summer Klaas Kloosterboer (NL 1959), Chris Martin (USA 1954) and Jim Shaw (USA 1952) will transform the Submarine Wharf in Rotterdam’s docklands into a gigantic art studio. They will present existing and newly-created site-specific work. More information: http://www.boijmans.nl/en/."
