        "text": "The Frieze London art fair, which is currently in its preview days in the capital city, has named the winners of two prizes that it facilitates. Sprüth Magers gallery, of Berlin, London, and Los Angeles, has taken home the Frieze Stand Prize, which is given out at each edition of the fair to one notable booth. Currently on view at the Sprüth Magers booth are works by Thomas Demand, Jenny Holzer, Marcel van Eeden, and Kaari Upson.\n\nThe jury for this year’s Stand Prize included Katrina Brown, director of the Common Guild in Glasgow, Scotland; Anne Ellegood, senior curator of the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles; and Francesco Stocchi, curator of modern and contemporary art at the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Its members said in a statement that Sprüth Magers was “inventive with their use of space and created an absorbing environment that places the works in dialogue with each other, while also highlighting the significance of each individual piece.” London’s Pilar Corrias gallery and Los Angeles’s the Box gallery also received “special commendations” from the jury, according to a release.\n\nThis year’s Camden Arts Centre Emerging Arts Prize at Frieze went to Wong Ping, whose work is currently on view at the booth of Edouard Malingue Gallery, of Hong Kong and Shanghai. As winner of the prize, Ping will now receive a solo show at the Camden Arts Centre in England within the next year and a half.\n\nAlong with these announcements came news of works acquired through funds supported by Frieze in collaboration with various institutions. Through the Frieze Tate Fund, Tate added to its collection works by Sonia Boyce, Giorgio Griffa, Claudette Johnson, and Johanna Unzueta. And through the Contemporary Art Society’s Collections Fund at Frieze, works by Kehinde Wiley and Zadie Xa will be heading to the collection of the Box museum (not relation to the same-named gallery) in Plymouth, England."
