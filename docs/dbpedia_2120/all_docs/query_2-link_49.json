        "text": "marcel van eeden (*1965, lives and works inthe Hague) basically concentrates on one majorproject. Through the medium of drawing, he almostencyclopaedically appropriates his parents‘ andgrandparents‘ world which he was not able to experienceand perceive directly himself. He makesone drawing every day based on newspaper andmagazine illustrations or other pictures which dateback to before his birth. The visual impressionsare detached from their original context throughthe black and white of his pencil and specialchalk, van Eeden‘s translation of them into hispersonal mode of perception through his indivi-dual drawing style, the use of rather similar formatsand working materials, and the adherence to adaily drawing ritual which is reminiscent of OnKawara‘s date paintings: „Before you existed, nobodymissed you, and after you're gone, the samewill be really true again... It's a kind of ideal state...It's a strange twilight zone: you can't ignore it,yet you can, more or less. There is somethingblissful about it,\" says the artist.The museum franz gertsch is the first Swissmuseum to present this work in a selection ofmore than 80 masterly drawings from Marcel vanEeden‘s picture encyclopaedia. Until September 12"
