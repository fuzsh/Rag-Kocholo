        "text": "Sorry, but our interactive content currently requires Flash\n\nWhen I was about 16 or 17, I wanted to be a poet. I was reading poems by Gerrit Achterberg, an early 20th-century Dutch poet who wrote about magical formulas. At the time, I had a girlfriend who didn't want to be with me. I wanted to write poems that would change her mind, but I didn't have the talent so I thought I would work with paintings instead – turning everything upside down. And then I noticed that Georg Baselitz had already done that …\n\nAnd then I thought I could paint a world that was anti-me – monochromes painted with a date from before my birth. And then I noticed that On Kawara had already done that too. I eventually decided to use old photos instead of dates. I started with paintings, and then moved to linocuts, and then I discovered drawing …\n\nI started producing one drawing a day during my last year at the art academy in Den Haag, Holland. Since the 1980s I've only drawn from images that predate my date of birth (1965). I have a huge archive of images on my laptop: photographs, magazines, postcards, posters, flyers, books … I open them in iPhoto and decide what I like. I usually use details, making cutouts in my head.\n\nSince 2006, I've been combining my daily drawings into a long-term narrative, using found facts and images (always pre-1965) as building blocks for a fictional story. I have created a number of protagonists, whose storylines often develop in parallel to my life – they travel to the same places I do, and their lives often take shape from images and text I find while traveling.\n\nWhen I'm working on a story, I often leave the bottom of the page blank. Sometimes I make 10 drawings and then I look for the story line. Sometimes I have a bit of the storyline and I search for the drawing that fits best with the story but sometimes it doesn't fit at all, and I like that because then you have a kind of Dadaistic coincidence. You search for meaning, and question seemingly incongruous juxtapositions."
