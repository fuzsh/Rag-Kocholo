Marcel van Eeden

Text by Katja Blomberg, Konrad Bitterli.

Since the mid 1990s, the Dutch artist Marcel van Eeden (born 1965) has used drawing to attempt to forge a relationship with the world prior to his birth. Based on print media published exclusively before the year 1965, his drawings also weave imaginary celebrities into their narratives, ultimately evolving into a self-contained world from which their author is emphatically absent. This volume surveys his work.
