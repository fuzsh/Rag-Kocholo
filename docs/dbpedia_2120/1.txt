The artist book Marcel van Eeden – 1898 is being published to coincide with the Hans Thoma Prize 2023. The prizewinner, Marcel van Eeden (b. 1965), explores Thoma’s littleknown travels to the Netherlands in 1898. He reflects on Thoma’s analysis of Rembrandt van Rijn or Paulus Potter, under the problematic influence of the cultural theorist Julius Langbehn. Present-day gum bichromate images of the places Thoma visited alongside historical quotes by Thoma and Langbehn result in a multifaceted, critical consideration of nationalistic views on culture.
