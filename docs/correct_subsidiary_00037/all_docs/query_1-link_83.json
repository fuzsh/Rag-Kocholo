        "text": "Annual Cash Incentive Compensation\n\n• An annual cash payment targeted as a percentage of base salary that is contingent upon performance\n\nProvides financial incentive to achieve annual business objectives Long-Term Incentive Compensation\n\n• Following the Business Combination, and in consideration of the cancellation of the underlying phantom units previously granted under the MLTIP, the Company granted Replacement RSUs and associated Earnout Rights to certain NEOs pursuant to the terms of the A&R MLTIP described further below\n\n• The Company began granting annual incentive RSU awards in early 2022\n\nProvides incentives to meet long-term Company goals, align executives with stockholder interests, and support retention •\n\n“Retained Value” equaled 10% of the sum of (i) the fair market value of all FoA Units held by the Continuing Unitholders immediately following the closing of the Business Combination plus (ii) the product of (x) the number of shares of Class A Common Stock held indirectly by the Continuing Stockholders (as defined in the Transaction Agreement) immediately following the closing of the Business Combination and (y) the Closing Price plus (iii) the present value of the estimated payments to be made by the Company pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreements (as defined in the Transaction Agreement) plus (iv) the aggregate principal value of notes issued by FoA Equity (or its subsidiaries) (if any) that are distributed to Original Unitholders prior to closing of the Business Combination. Any determinations as to the calculations of the Retained Value will be made by the Administrator in its sole discretion; and\n\n(4)\n\nRepresents the aggregate grant date fair value of time-vesting Replacement RSUs and Earnout Rights granted in connection with the Business Combination calculated in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, Compensation—Stock Compensation (“Topic 718”). The assumptions made in determining values with respect to awards granted during fiscal 2021 are disclosed in Note 27 (Equity Based Compensation) to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form\n\n10-K\n\nfiled on March 15, 2022. As the Earnout Rights vest subject to the Company achieving certain share price targets, they are subject to market conditions, and not performance conditions, as defined under Topic 718, and therefore have no maximum grant date fair values that differ from the grant date fair values presented in the table. Such Replacement RSUs and Earnout Rights were granted to certain executive officers in connection with the Business Combination in consideration for the cancellation of legacy phantom units previously granted to such officers by FoA Equity under the initial MLTIP from January 1, 2015 through the date of the Transaction Agreement. For additional information on the cancellation of such phantom units, see “—Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Actions Taken in Connection with the Business Combination.”\n\n(7)\n\nRepresents the amount of the Eligible Distribution Award received by Ms. Cook and Messrs. Prahm, Fleming and Thornock in connection with the Business Combinations with respect to their phantom units. From January 1, 2015 through October 12, 2020, each of Ms. Cook and Messrs. Prahm, Fleming and Thornock received awards of phantom units under the Company’s prior MLTIP. The phantom units were accounted for as a profit-sharing arrangement under Topic 710 as they did not represent a substantive form of equity and were not indexed to the price of UFG common units. In connection with the Business Combination, each of Ms. Cook and Messrs. Prahm, Fleming and Thornock received an Eligible Distribution Award upon the Original Unitholders achieving a return in excess of the hurdle associated with the phantom units. Pursuant to the terms of the Transaction Agreement, the Original Unitholders elected to reduce the amount of the\n\npre-closing\n\ndistributions permitted under the Transaction Agreement to which they would have otherwise been entitled by an amount equal to the aggregate Eligible Distribution Award payable to the A&R MLTIP Participants. Accordingly, the Eligible Distribution Award payable to each of Ms. Cook and Messrs. Prahm, Fleming and Thornock was borne economically by the Original Unitholders. For additional information see “—Compensation Discussion and Analysis —Actions Taken in Connection with the Business Combination.”\n\n(9)\n\nTo supplement the\n\nSEC-required\n\ndisclosure in the Summary Compensation Table, we have included this additional “Adjusted Total” column to the right of the Summary Compensation Table. We are presenting this supplemental column to show how the compensation committee views the NEOs’ compensation for fiscal 2021. The additional “Adjusted Total” column reflects the “Total” compensation column calculated under SEC rules but excludes the grant date fair value of Replacement RSUs and Earnout Rights granted to certain executive officers in connection with the Business Combination in consideration for the cancellation of legacy phantom units previously granted to such officers by FoA Equity and any Eligible Distribution Award received by such executive officers as a result of the Original Unitholders achieving a return in excess of the hurdle associated with such phantom units. Pursuant to the terms of the LTIP Award Settlement Agreement, the Original Unitholders, including our Principal Stockholders, have agreed to pay and bear the economic consequences to the Company of the obligation to settle such Replacement RSU and Earnout Right awards. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Transaction Agreement, the Original Unitholders elected to reduce the amount of the\n\npre-closing\n\ndistributions permitted under the Transaction Agreement to which they would have otherwise been entitled by an amount equal to the aggregate Eligible Distribution Award payable to the A&R MLTIP Participants. Accordingly, the Eligible Distribution Award payable to the A&R MLTIP Participants was also borne economically by the Original Unitholders. Amounts reported in the “Adjusted Total” column differ substantially from the amounts determined under SEC rules as reported in the “Total” column, and are not a substitute for “Total Compensation” as determined under SEC rules.\n\n(1)\n\nRepresents grants of Replacement RSUs. Each Replacement RSU represents a contingent right to receive one share of the Company’s Class A Common Stock. The restricted stock units will be settled in either Class A Common Stock or cash (or a combination thereof) at the discretion of the compensation committee. Pursuant to the terms of the A&R MLTIP, 25% of the Replacement RSUs vested on the grant date, and the remaining 75% will vest in equal installments on each of the first three anniversaries of the closing of the Business Combination, subject to each holder’s continued employment through the vesting date. See “—Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Actions Taken in Connection with the Business Combination” for further discussion of the Replacement RSUs granted in 2021. As discussed above, pursuant to the terms of the LTIP Award Settlement Agreement, the Original Unitholders, including our Principal Stockholders, have agreed to pay and bear the economic consequences to the Company of the obligation to settle such Replacement RSU awards.\n\n(2)\n\nReflects Earnout Rights granted in 2021, which represent the right to receive additional shares of Class A Common Stock. Half of the Earnout Rights will vest upon the occurrence of the First Earnout Achievement Date and half of the Earnout Rights will vest upon the occurrence of the Second Earnout Achievement Date. The Earnout Rights are subject in each case to the same service requirements as the Replacement RSUs. See “—Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Actions Taken in Connection with the Business Combination” for further discussion of the Earnout Rights granted in 2021. As discussed above, pursuant to the terms of the LTIP Award Settlement Agreement, the Original Unitholders, including our Principal Stockholders, have agreed to pay and bear the economic consequences to the Company of the obligation to settle such Earnout Right awards.\n\n(3)\n\nReflects the CFO\n\nSign-On\n\nRSUs granted to Mr. Gericke. Each CFO\n\nSign-On\n\nRSU represents a contingent right to receive one share of the Company’s Class A Common Stock. The CFO\n\nSign-On\n\nRSUs will be settled in either Class A Common Stock or cash (or a combination thereof) at the discretion of the compensation committee. Pursuant to the terms of the award,\n\none-third\n\nof the CFO\n\nSign-On\n\nRSUs vested on the grant date, and the remaining\n\ntwo-thirds\n\nwill vest in equal installments on each of the first two anniversaries of the grant date, subject to Mr. Gericke’s continued employment on the applicable vesting date.\n\nName\n\nNumber of Shares or\n\nUnits of Stock That\n\nHave Not Vested\n\n(#)\n\nMarket Value of\n\nShares or Units of\n\nStock That Have Not\n\nVested\n\n(1)\n\n($)\n\nEquity Incentive Plan\n\nAwards: Number of\n\nUnearned Shares,\n\nUnits or Other Rights\n\nThat Have Not Vested\n\n(#)\n\nEquity Incentive Plan\n\nAwards: Market or\n\nPayout Value of\n\nUnearned Shares,\n\nUnits or Other Rights\n\nThat Have Not\n\nVested\n\n(1)\n\n($)\n\n(1)\n\nPursuant to the award agreements granting each of Ms. Cook and Messrs. Prahm, Fleming and Thornock Replacement RSUs under our 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan as a result of the A&R MLTIP, in the event any named executive officer’s employment terminates as a result of his or her death or disability, all unvested Replacement RSU awards shall immediately vest. Additionally, pursuant to the Replacement RSU award agreements, in the event any named executive officer’s employment is terminated by the Company without Cause, or by the employee for Good Reason, all unvested Replacement RSU awards shall immediately vest. Pursuant to the award agreement granting Mr. Gericke RSUs under our 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan, in the event our named executive officer’s employment terminates as a result of his death or disability or in the event of a change in control, in connection with which the successor to the Company fails to assume, convert or replace the RSUs, all unvested RSU awards shall immediately vest. Additionally, pursuant to the RSU award agreement, in the event our named executive officer’s employment is terminated by the Company without Cause, or by the employee for Good Reason, all unvested RSU awards shall immediately vest. Equity amounts are based on the closing market price of our Class A Common Stock of $3.97 on December 31, 2021.\n\n(3)\n\nPursuant to the award agreements granting each of Ms. Cook and Messrs. Prahm, Fleming and Thornock Earnout Rights as a result of the A&R MLTIP, in the event our named executive officer’s employment terminates as a result of his or her death or disability or, in the event our named executive officer’s employment is terminated by the Company without Cause or by the employee for Good Reason, the service condition for all of the outstanding Earnout Rights shall be immediately satisfied. The Earnout Rights will remain outstanding and subject to an Earnout Date being achieved, i.e., the market condition being met, prior to vesting. As of December 31, 2021, the market condition applicable to the Earnout Rights had not been met.\n\n(2)\n\nThe amount reflects the aggregate grant date fair value of the stock awards granted on November 18, 2021, computed in accordance with Topic 718, based the closing price of our common stock on the grant date. Such aggregate grant date fair values do not take into account any estimated forfeitures related to service vesting conditions. For more information on the assumptions used in our estimates of value, please refer to Note 27 (Equity Based Compensation) to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form\n\n10-K\n\nfiled on March 15, 2022. The amounts reported in this column reflect the accounting cost for these RSUs and do not correspond to the actual economic value that may be received by the directors upon vesting and/or settlement of the RSUs. As of December 31, 2021, each of our eligible\n\nnon-employee directors\n\nheld an aggregate 18,691 RSUs.\n\n(1)\n\nSubject to the terms of the Exchange Agreement, the FoA Units are exchangeable for shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock on a\n\none-for-one\n\nbasis. Beneficial ownership of FoA Units reflected in this table has not been also reflected as beneficial ownership of shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock for which such FoA Units may be exchanged. Shares of Class B Common have no economic rights but provide each holder of at least one such share (regardless of the number of shares so held) to a number of votes that is equal to the aggregate number of FoA Units held by such holder on all matters on which stockholders of the Company are entitled to vote generally.\n\n(3)\n\nThese shares are available for grant as of December 31, 2021 under the Incentive Plan pursuant to which the compensation committee of the board of directors may make various share based awards including incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, other equity-based awards, and other cash-based awards granted under the Incentive Plan. The maximum number of shares that may be granted under the Incentive Plan is 21,250,000, without giving effect to any “evergreen” increase, pursuant to which such “Absolute Share Limit” is automatically increased on the first day of each fiscal year commencing on January 1, 2022, in an amount equal to the least of (x) 5,312,500 shares of Class A Common Stock, (y) 2.5% of the total number of shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year, treating, for the avoidance of doubt, all then-outstanding FoA Units as shares of Class A Common Stock assuming the full exchange of then-outstanding FoA Units for shares of Class A Common Stock in accordance with the Exchange Agreement, and (z) a lower number of shares of Class A Common Stock as determined by the board.\n\n•\n\nthe price of shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock at the time of the sale or exchange—the increase in any tax deductions, as well as the tax basis increase in other assets of FoA, is directly proportional to the price of shares of Class A Common Stock at the time of each sale or exchange;\n\n•\n\nchanges in tax rates—payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements will be calculated using the actual U.S. federal income tax rate in effect for the applicable period and an assumed, weighted-average state and local income tax rate based on apportionment factors for the applicable period, so changes in tax rates will impact the magnitude of cash tax benefits covered by the Tax Receivable Agreements and the amount of payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements; and"
