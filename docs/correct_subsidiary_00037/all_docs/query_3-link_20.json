        "text": "\"YOU'RE NOT A PROPELLERHEAD!\" Jonathan Lee thumps the conference table in front of him with both fists. \"That's good!\" he bellows. Across the table, James Crum, business systems manager of Mirapoint, a fledgling e-mail server manufacturer in Cupertino, Calif. looks startled but happy that he's made the cut.\n\nThe barrel-chested Lee, 38, who is to your average in-house corporate propellerhead what Charles Bronson is to your average street thug, is on a sales call. His Silicon Valley startup, Corio, wants to take effective control of Mirapoint's most critical information-technology decisions for the next five years. He wants to own and support Mirapoint's software. Scariest of all, Lee wants to rent the service to Mirapoint over the Internet.\n\nThe key weapons in Lee's arsenal: the Internet, 16 years of scars from the IT trenches -- and a burgeoning backlash against Big Software. In the name of increased efficiency and productivity, U.S. companies plunked down more than $2 trillion for hardware, software and services in the past decade. Two trillion. For that sum U.S. companies restructured themselves, civilized cyberspace and built new businesses from nothing. But they also endured unending pain, hassle and complexity.\n\nSomehow the computer industry has gotten away with making life miserable for its best customers, delivering products that are incredibly hard to install and cost more to use than they did to buy.\n\nCustomers have obliged, enduring a relentless cycle of technology upgrades and planned obsolescence driven as much by an industry's genetic need to grow as by any need to run a business.\n\nLee's crew at Corio deride all of this as software \"heroin deals\"\n\nthat render the client in the complete thrall of the supplier. After all, once a company invests $50 million and two years of struggle for a massive software system, spending $4 to $10 extra for every dollar spent on the package itself, it can't usually afford to turn back.\n\n\"The IT industry has misunderstood what it's there for,\" says Lee, Korean-born, American-educated and the son of a Methodist minister in Silicon Valley. He preaches fire and brimstone of his own: \"It's about helping the shipping clerk make shipments faster and closing the books faster. What good is having a computer with the faster chip or newer software? It isn't intrinsically valuable. You can use it as a bookend, maybe. You can't eat it.\"\n\nThen the clincher: \"Everybody talks about technology in terms of the next machine, the next cool program. Well to hell with those things.\n\nInformation technology comes down to its impact on making people do their work better.\"\n\nNo wonder Lee's customer, Jim Crum at Mirapoint, looks like a willing convert. Corio could cut 30% from Mirapoint's budget and let Crum convert an entire room of servers into badly needed office space. Crum sees an even bigger benefit: a chance to jump off the high-tech treadmill.\n\n\"Each new release requires you to customize it. Then you've got a custom system that has to be changed every time you upgrade,\" Crum complains. \"I don't want to get the call in the middle of the night. If I can offload those headaches onto somebody else, that's great.\"\n\nOutsourcing data processing is a well-worn concept by now. Corio and a band of Webheads want to use the Internet to extend it to a far broader scale among small and midsize companies. They are harnessing the power of high bandwidth and high-grade encryption to rent out even the most important software systems swiftly and securely over the global network. It will be more akin to paying for a utility like electricity or telephone service than bankrolling the companywide root canal that today's in-house systems entail.\n\nIf these renegades succeed, it will turn the software business on its head, undercutting pricing models, sapping much of the industry's next wave of growth and pink-slipping legions of costly consultants from Andersen Consulting, IBM and the like.\n\nYou probably won't see, anytime soon, a rush by multinationals to rip out the systems they spent millions to install. Over-the-Net technology isn't robust enough for that. Yet. Like the technology shifts that helped minimills undercut Big Steel and diesel-electric trains displace steam locomotives, this wave is starting small.\n\nBut already it threatens the software industry, which thrives on complexity and technology turnover. Companies like SAP, Baan, Oracle and PeopleSoft saw stunning growth in revenues and fat profit margins over the last decade.\n\nTheir wares arrive incomplete, ready to be tailored to each customer's quirks by the consultants -- who bill by the hour. And then there's the upgrade treadmill. The latest software often forces you to replace the desktops and servers; linking it all together requires more help from the consultants.\n\nSome big corporate accounts are full up. Sales growth has slowed sharply at Baan, PeopleSoft, SAP and other \"enterprise resource planning\" shops. In mid-March Oracle surprised Wall Street with only 10%\n\ngrowth in database sales, about half the expected rate, shaving 21% off Oracle shares in one day. The same day, Microsoft cited a $400 million shortfall. The companies blame temporal factors -- a slowdown to brace for Year 2000; delays in shipping the next round of products.\n\nBut something more fundamental is going on here: Big Software's biggest customers are getting fed up. For years vendors benefited by imposing a don't-get-left-behind imperative on their clients; now the clients are beginning to push back.\n\n\"It's very disruptive,\" says Susan Arseven, chief information officer of paper giant Union Camp Corp. \"Everybody's speaking up to these companies now. We're saying we don't constantly want new products. It's a problem we all have.\"\n\nShe recently spent nine months and almost $2 million upgrading Union Camp's 9,000 PCs -- all to put in Windows 95, not the Windows 98 upgrade unveiled last June. Horrors -- last year's model? It's too disruptive to keep up with each new release, Arseven says. When suppliers tell her, \"We can't ship you that, it's not the latest thing,\" she fires back: \"If you can't ship us what we want, we'll have to find someone else.\"\n\nHer shop is too big to hand everything over to a Netsourcer like Corio -- for now. But even the biggest names in Big Software see the Net threat and are trying to preempt it by embrace. Microsoft has pumped $200 million into fiber-networker Qwest with an eye toward renting its applications out over Qwest lines. SAP has an accord with outsourcer EDS to reduce massive SAP apps to digestible bytes that can be served up to small companies over the Internet.\n\nPeopleSoft moved to strike deals with Corio, USinternetworking and a few other \"application service providers.\" It will extend PeopleSoft into smaller companies that could not afford it before; but it also could mean selling fewer programs overall, because Corio &Co. buy one copy and rent it to several accounts, sending the softwaremaker a cut of the proceeds.\n\nOracle works the Internet angle, too. Like Corio, its Business OnLine program rents applications to customers via the Internet for a monthly fee. Unlike Corio, it offers only one brand -- Oracle -- and the lack of choice might hurt it later.\n\nThe Oracle effort's first customer: Triton Network Systems, a fast-\n\ngrowing equipment startup. Carryl Smith, Triton's chief information officer, was a client waiting to happen. In his previous job at DSC Communications, a billion-dollar-a-year telecom equipment maker, he oversaw an agonizing migration from a mainframe system with custom software to an Oracle system. It took three years.\n\nBrought into Triton to help evaluate its options, Smith wasn't about to inject another heroin deal. He passed on \"lowball\" bids for in-house systems from Baan and SAP. After a mere two-month preparation, Triton flipped the switch in February and began running Oracle general-ledger and accounts-payable software over the Internet. It has worked without a minute of downtime ever since.\n\n\"We've got 100 employees now and 4 people on our IT staff,\" says Smith. \"If we were going to run [the system] in-house, we'd need 10.\"\n\nOne of Smith's favorite features of the Internet-based system: It can't be customized to the maniacal degree that in-house systems can.\n\nWhether Oracle genuinely wanted to make its programs less complex (the company line) or had to trim them to run smoothly over the Internet (an engineering necessity), it means Smith's retraining headaches will be milder when he adds a new program.\n\nWill Oracle's simplified, rentable versions of its flagship software cut into services revenue? Absolutely. But Oracle is so convinced that today's ERP model is doomed that, last year, its programmers finished writing all applications around Internet protocols.\n\nThe sudden scramble by Oracle and other titans to simplify delivery and implementation gets at the root of the problem: too much complexity.\n\nThe systems are so complicated that there aren't enough hackers around to run them. About 350,000 high-level infotech staff jobs go begging in the U.S., according to Information Technology Association of America.\n\nThe complexity rises with upgrades. If a customer stays for years on the same old package, the costs to the software vendor for supporting both the old stuff and new releases begin to mount. Eventually the vendor sends the customer a \"desupport\" notice, which says, essentially:\n\n\"Upgrade or be damned.\" (See box, right.)\n\n\"The consultants are never going away,\" says Bruce Richardson, an analyst for AMR Research, which evaluates ERP software for clients. The first brush with ERP is often a rude surprise. \"My clients often think it's over once they get through the sales process and installation. I tell them 'You're out of your mind. The hard work is starting now.'\"\n\nSometimes a heroin deal turns into an o.d. Carrollton, Tex.-based drug distributor FoxMeyer Corp., which liquidated and was absorbed by McKesson, says a three-year project for a $5 million SAP system run by Andersen Consulting put it out of business. FoxMeyer is suing SAP and Andersen for $500 million apiece.\n\nAnother Frankenstein tale: Last November supermarket operator Nash Finch Co. reportedly had to freeze a $76 million SAP project after sinking $50 million into it; the effort will be revived after next year.\n\n\"Add it all up and you've got a disaster on your hands,\" says a gleeful Vinod Khosla, cofounder of Sun Microsystems and now a partner at venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. Gleeful because, where there's disaster, there's money to be made fixing it.\n\nKleiner Perkins made hay in just about every digital trend -- except ERP software. Now Kleiner is up to its patched elbows in startups using the Internet to attack the software establishment at its weak points: ease of use, price and service.\n\nThe race is on. Annapolis, Md.-based USinternetworking, set for a public offering this year, has raised $95 million in venture funding (none of it from Kleiner) and is under contract to run Siebel software for telco U S West's sales force.\n\nOther startups, like Atlanta-based Employease Inc., are leaving popular, complex software packages behind and writing their own code.\n\nRather than having to use specialized \"client\" software on your PC, as in a typical ERP system, you can run Employease's human resources apps with nothing but a Web browser.\n\nCorio is Kleiner's main vehicle in the Netsource race so far.\n\nJonathan Lee in an unlikely driver: He graduated from the University of California at Berkeley in 1983 and began his career selling, installing and integrating the complicated technology he now decries. But in recent years, he turned to high-tech troubleshooting, fixing messes wrought by new digital gear.\n\nThat is how he came to Kleiner a few years ago, when he was brought in to fix the data mess at half a dozen startups. The firm moved to bottle his energy, buying his consultancy and hiring him and three dozen henchmen to form Corio.\n\nThe rules of engagement: Instead of charging customers by the hour, Corio charges a flat fee up front and a monthly retainer. This takes away any incentive to drag an assignment out. Instead of working on systems that customers own, Corio owns the software and rents it out through two data-center operators, letting one program serve several customers. Rather than tailor software to customer wishes, Corio standardizes the features -- key to rent-ing the same stuff to multiple accounts. Any tricky integration is handled by Corio's own coders, not consultants.\n\nCorio started work for its first client in November, running PeopleSoft accounting and fixed-assets applications for Internet portal Excite, another Kleiner puppy. Since then, Corio has landed two telecom equipment makers, Vertical Networks and Clarent Corp.\n\nIt's about time fast-growing upstarts got hold of software flexible enough to help manage the growth, says Richard Heaps, chief operating officer of Clarent. \"Without Corio, I don't have the capital to invest in a PeopleSoft system -- and I wouldn't get their attention.\"\n\nLee looks for rapid growth from there. With an eye toward taking Corio public this year, Kleiner is bringing in a more presentable chief executive, Ronald Clark of Automatic Data Processing. The rough-edged Lee will stick around as executive vice president, happy to preach to customers instead of schmooze investment bankers.\n\nIt will take a while to sort out whether the Netsource movement can cut complexity and put the customer back in control -- or will simply become another hot market for the same old suppliers. But after years on the high-tech treadmill, corporate customers might welcome a change of pace."
