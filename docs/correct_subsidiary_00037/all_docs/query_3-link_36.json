        "text": "As the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) “gold-rush” intensifies, industry consolidation is inevitable. The latest example of this consolidation process is today’s announcement by NetSuite that it intends to acquire OpenAir.\n\nThis announcement not only reaffirms the SaaS industry consolidation trend, but it also is the latest example of a company profiled by THINKstrategies being acquired shortly thereafter. Other examples include,\n\nVtrenz which was acquired by Silverpop\n\nEverdream was acquired by Dell\n\nAimNet was acquired by Cognizant\n\nCorio was acquired by IBM\n\n(Contact me if you’d like a copy of our Strategic Thinking profiles on these companies.)\n\nI had the privilege of talking with Zach Nelson, CEO of NetSuite, and Morris Panner, the CEO of OpenAir, moments before today’s announcement was made public.
