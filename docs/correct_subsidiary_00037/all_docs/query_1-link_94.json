        "text": "March 28, 2024\n\nDear Stockholder:\n\nPlease join us for Finance of America Companies Inc.s Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held on Monday, May 13, 2024, at 9:00 a.m., Eastern Time. The Annual Meeting will be held in a virtual meeting format only and will be conducted via live audio webcast. You will be able to attend the Annual Meeting online, vote your shares electronically and submit your questions during the Annual Meeting via a live audio webcast by visiting www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/FOA2024 and entering the control number shown on your proxy card or the instructions that accompanied your proxy materials.\n\nWe urge you to read the accompanying materials regarding the matters to be voted on at the meeting and to submit your voting instructions by proxy. The board of directors recommends that you vote FOR each of the proposals listed on the attached notice.\n\nWhether or not you plan to attend the meeting, your vote is important to us. You may vote your shares by proxy on the Internet, by telephone or by completing, signing and promptly returning a proxy card, or you may vote via the Internet at the Annual Meeting. We encourage you to vote by Internet, by telephone or by proxy card in advance even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting. By doing so, you will ensure that your shares are represented and voted at the Annual Meeting.\n\nThank you for your continued support of Finance of America Companies Inc.\n\nSincerely, Lauren E. Richmond Chief Legal Officer, General Counsel & Secretary\n\nFINANCE OF AMERICA COMPANIES INC.\n\n5830 Granite Parkway, Suite 400\n\nPlano, Texas 75024\n\nTelephone: (877) 202-2666\n\nPROXY STATEMENT\n\nAnnual Meeting of Stockholders\n\nMay 13, 2024\n\nGENERAL INFORMATION\n\nUnless the context otherwise requires, all references to we, us, our, Finance of America, FoA, or the Company refer to Finance of America Companies Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. References to FoA Equity are to Finance of America Equity Capital LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, that the Company controls in an UP-C structure.\n\nOn April 1, 2021, the Company became a public company as a result of a series of transactions pursuant to which Replay Acquisition Corp. (Replay) combined with Finance of America Companies Inc. (the Business Combination), and began trading under the symbol FOA on the New York Stock Exchange on April 5, 2021.\n\nWhy am I being provided with these materials?\n\nWe are providing this Proxy Statement to you in connection with the solicitation by the board of directors (the Board or board of directors) of Finance of America Companies Inc. of proxies to be voted at our Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held on May 13, 2024 (the Annual Meeting) and at any postponements or adjournments of the Annual Meeting. On or about March 28, 2024, we distributed or made available, as the case may be, this Proxy Statement, and our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (referred to as the Proxy Materials), notifying each stockholder entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting how to vote.\n\nWhat am I voting on?\n\nThere are three proposals scheduled to be voted on at the Annual Meeting:\n\nWho is entitled to vote?\n\nStockholders as of the close of business on March 18, 2024 (the Record Date) may vote at the Annual Meeting or any postponement or adjournment thereof. As of that date, there were 96,561,759 vested shares of our Class A Common Stock outstanding, 4,258,500 unvested shares of our Class A Common Stock outstanding and 15 shares of our Class B Common Stock outstanding.\n\n1\n\nHolders of our Class A Common Stock have one vote for each share held as of the Record Date, including shares:\n\nThe shares of Class B Common Stock have no economic rights, but entitle each holder, without regard to the number of shares of Class B Common Stock held by such holder, to a number of votes that is equal to the aggregate number of limited liability company interests (FoA Units) in FoA Equity. Holders of shares of Class B Common Stock vote together with holders of Class A Common Stock as a single class on all matters on which stockholders are entitled to vote generally, except as otherwise required by law.\n\nWhat constitutes a quorum?\n\nThe presence in person or by proxy of stockholders holding a majority in voting power of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting constitutes a quorum for the Annual Meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes are counted as present for purposes of determining a quorum.\n\nWhat if a quorum is not present at the Annual Meeting?\n\nIf a quorum is not present at the scheduled time of the Annual Meeting, the person presiding over the Annual Meeting may adjourn the Annual Meeting until a quorum is present or represented.\n\nHow many votes are required to approve each proposal?\n\nUnder our Amended and Restated Bylaws (the Bylaws), directors are elected by a plurality vote, which means that the director nominees with the greatest number of votes cast, even if less than a majority, will be elected.\n\nThere is no cumulative voting.\n\nUnder our Bylaws, the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares of stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on such matter is required to approve the compensation of the named executive officers of the Company (Proposal No. 2), and the proposal to ratify the appointment of BDO USA, P.C. as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2024 (Proposal No. 3).\n\nWhat is a broker non-vote?\n\nA broker non-vote occurs when shares held through a broker are not voted with respect to a proposal because (1) the broker has not received voting instructions from the stockholder who beneficially owns the shares and (2) the broker lacks the authority to vote the shares at its discretion. Under current New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) interpretations that govern broker non-votes, Proposal Nos. 1 and 2 are considered non-routine matters, and a broker will lack the authority to vote uninstructed shares at their discretion on such proposals. Proposal No. 3 is considered a routine matter, and a broker will be permitted to exercise its discretion to vote uninstructed shares on this proposal.\n\nHow are votes counted?\n\nWith respect to the election of directors (Proposal No. 1), you may vote FOR or WITHHOLD with respect to each Nominee. Votes that are voted WITHHOLD will not count as a vote FOR or AGAINST a director because directors are elected by plurality voting. Broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of Proposal No. 1.\n\n2\n\nWith respect to the advisory vote to approve the compensation of the named executive officers (Proposal No. 2), you may vote FOR, AGAINST or ABSTAIN with respect to the compensation of the named executive officers. Abstentions will count as a vote AGAINST Proposal No. 2 and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of Proposal No. 2.\n\nWith respect to the ratification of our independent registered public accounting firm (Proposal No. 3), you may vote FOR, AGAINST, or ABSTAIN. Abstentions are counted as a vote AGAINST this proposal. There are no broker non-votes with respect to Proposal No. 3, as brokers are permitted to exercise discretion to vote uninstructed shares on this proposal.\n\nIf you sign and submit your proxy card without providing voting instructions, your shares will be voted in accordance with the recommendation of the Board with respect to the Proposals.\n\nHow does the Board recommend that I vote?\n\nOur Board recommends that you vote your shares:\n\nWho will count the vote?\n\nRepresentatives of Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. (Broadridge) will tabulate the votes and act as inspectors of election.\n\nHow do I vote my shares without attending the Annual Meeting?\n\nIf you are a stockholder of record, you may vote by authorizing a proxy to vote on your behalf at the Annual Meeting. Specifically, you may authorize a proxy:\n\nInternet and telephone voting facilities will close at 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on May 12, 2024, for the voting of shares held by stockholders of record as of the Record Date. Proxy cards with respect to shares held of record must be received no later than 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on May 12, 2024.\n\nIf you hold your shares in street name, you may submit voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee. In most instances, you will be able to do this over the Internet, by telephone or by mail. Please refer to information from your bank, broker or other nominee on how to submit voting instructions.\n\n3\n\nHow do I attend and vote my shares at the Virtual Annual Meeting?\n\nThis years Annual Meeting will be a completely virtual meeting of stockholders. You may attend the Annual Meeting via the Internet. Any stockholder can attend the Annual Meeting live online at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/FOA2024 and enter the control number shown on your proxy card or the instructions that accompanied your Proxy Materials. If you virtually attend the Annual Meeting you can vote your shares electronically, and submit your questions during the Annual Meeting. A summary of the information you need to attend the Annual Meeting and vote via the Internet is provided below:\n\nWill I be able to participate in the online Annual Meeting on the same basis I would be able to participate in a live annual meeting?\n\nThe Annual Meeting will be held in a virtual meeting format only and will be conducted via live audio webcast. The online meeting format for the Annual Meeting will enable full and equal participation by all our stockholders from any place in the world at little to no cost.\n\nWe designed the format of the online Annual Meeting to ensure that our stockholders who attend our Annual Meeting will be afforded the same rights and opportunities to participate as they would at an in-person meeting and to enhance stockholder access, participation and communication through online tools. We plan to take the following steps to provide for such an experience:\n\nHow do I vote online during the Annual Meeting?\n\nIf you are a stockholder of record, you may vote your shares by attending the 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders online and following the on-screen voting instructions.\n\nIf you hold your shares in street name and you wish to vote online during the Annual Meeting, you must obtain a legal proxy from the brokerage firm, bank, dealer or other similar organization that holds your shares. A legal proxy is a written document that authorizes you to vote your shares held in street name at the Annual Meeting. If applicable, please contact the organization that holds your shares for instructions regarding obtaining a legal proxy.\n\n4\n\nWhat if during the check-in time or during the meeting I have technical difficulties or trouble accessing the virtual meeting website?\n\nIf you encounter any technical difficulties with the virtual meeting website on the meeting day, please call the technical support number that will be posted in the instructional email you will receive after completion of your registration and on the day of the Annual Meeting. Technical support will be available starting at 8:45 a.m., Eastern Time, on Monday, May 13, 2024 and until the meeting has finished.\n\nWhat does it mean if I receive more than one proxy card on or about the same time?\n\nIt generally means you hold shares registered in more than one account. To ensure that all your shares are voted, please vote once for each proxy card you receive.\n\nMay I change my vote or revoke my proxy?\n\nYes. Whether you have voted by Internet, telephone or mail, if you are a stockholder of record, you may change your vote and revoke your proxy by:\n\nIf you hold shares in street name, please refer to information from your bank, broker or other nominee on how to revoke or submit new voting instructions.\n\nCould other matters be decided at the Annual Meeting?\n\nAs of the date of this Proxy Statement, we do not know of any matters to be raised at the Annual Meeting other than those referred to in this Proxy Statement. If other matters are properly presented at the Annual Meeting for consideration and you are a stockholder of record and have submitted a proxy, the named proxies will have the discretion to vote on those matters for you.\n\nWho will pay for the cost of this proxy solicitation?\n\nWe will pay the cost of soliciting proxies. Proxies may be solicited on our behalf by our directors, officers or employees of the Company (for no additional compensation) in person or by telephone, e-mail or facsimile transmission. Brokers and other nominees will be requested to solicit proxies or authorizations from beneficial owners and will be reimbursed for their reasonable expenses.\n\n5\n\nPROPOSAL NO. 1ELECTION OF DIRECTORS\n\nThe number of authorized directors is currently six and may be changed by resolution of our board of directors. At this Annual Meeting, all director nominees will be elected for a one-year term, expiring at the next annual meeting of stockholders.\n\nThe biographies below describe the business experience of each director nominee standing for re-election. In considering each director nominee for election at the Annual Meeting, the nominating and corporate governance committee assessed the contributions of those directors recommended for re-election in the context of the perceived needs of the Board. See discussion under Board Nomination Process, Identifying Nominees for Election to the Board.\n\nThe Board expects that each of the nominees listed below will be available for election as a director. However, if one or more of the nominees is not available for election, the persons named in the form of proxy have advised that they will vote for any substitute nominees as the Board may nominate. If a nominee is not available for election or is otherwise unable to serve as a director, the Board may reduce its size or choose a substitute nominee.\n\nNominees for Election to the Board of Directors in 2024\n\nThe following information describes the offices held, ages (as of the date of this Proxy Statement) and other business directorships of each director nominee, as well as the experiences, qualifications, attributes or skills that caused the Board to determine that the director-nominee should serve as a director.\n\nName\n\nAge\n\nPrincipal Occupation and Other Information\n\nBrian L. Libman 58 Brian L. Libman oversees our Companys business strategy and has served as the Chairman of our board of directors since the closing of the Business Combination. He is the architect of the Companys unique business model, and it is his vision that guides the Company. Mr. Libman has spent his entire career in the specialty finance area and has been involved in structuring and consummating the acquisitions of more than twenty businesses. Prior to creating Finance of America in 2013, he was the managing partner and CEO of Green Tree Servicing and became the Chief Strategy Officer of its public market successor. He began his career at Lehman Brothers and spent more than a decade developing the loan acquisition, servicing and lending businesses there, including the creation of Aurora Loan Services, one of the nations leading alternative mortgage originators and servicers. Through his deep knowledge of the lending space, he invented and was awarded patent: US20070136186A1 for his Automated Loan Evaluation System, which is a system and method for providing a loan pricing model for various lending scenarios. Mr. Libman submatriculated with honors from The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, having earned both his M.B.A. and B.S.E. Norma C. Corio 63 Norma C.

Ms. Corio previously worked for JPMorgan Chase for over 30 years from October 1982 to March 2013 where she held various positions, including Treasurer\n\n6\n\nTHE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND CERTAIN GOVERNANCE MATTERS\n\nOur board of directors directs and oversees the management of our business and affairs and has three standing committees: the audit committee, the compensation committee, and the nominating and corporate governance committee. In addition, from time to time, special committees may be established under the direction of the board of directors when necessary to address specific issues.\n\nComposition of the Board of Directors\n\nOur business and affairs are managed under the direction of the board of directors. In connection with the Business Combination, the Company and certain pre-closing equityholders of FoA Equity entered into a Stockholders Agreement (the Stockholders Agreement). Pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement, each of certain funds affiliated with Blackstone Inc. (Blackstone, and such funds, the Blackstone Investors) and an entity controlled by Brian L. Libman (Brian L. Libman and certain entities controlled by him, the BL Investors and, together with the Blackstone Investors, the Principal Stockholders) are entitled to nominate a certain number of directors to the board of directors, based on each such holders ownership of the voting securities of the Company. The Blackstone Investors have not currently exercised their right to nominate any directors to the Board. See Transactions with Related Persons Stockholders Agreement.\n\nDirector Independence and Independence Determinations\n\nOur board of directors has affirmatively determined that each of Ms. Corio and Messrs. Lord, Pratcher and West qualify as independent directors under the NYSE listing standards.\n\nBoard Nomination Process, Identifying Nominees for Election to the Board\n\nThe nominating and corporate governance committee is responsible for identifying, evaluating and recommending nominees for election to our board of directors. Final selection of director nominees for election remains within the sole discretion of our board of directors.\n\nDepth of experience, fitness and the ability to make meaningful contributions to our board of directors oversight of the business and affairs of the Company in addition to a willingness to exercise independent judgment, and an impeccable reputation for honest and ethical conduct that align with our core values, are important factors when identifying opportunities to add new directors to our board of directors. Additionally, in identifying new director candidates, our board of directors evaluates a candidates time commitments to ensure the appropriate amount of time, energy, and care is given to the needs of our business.\n\nOur nominating and corporate governance committee may identify potential director candidates by asking current directors and executive officers for their recommendations of persons they believe possess the right mix of criteria and qualifications, and are prepared to represent the best interests of the Company and our stockholders. Our nominating and corporate governance committee may also engage firms that specialize in identifying director candidates to our board of directors. Director nominations also may be made at the recommendation of stockholders pursuant to our Bylaws.\n\nOur nominating and corporate governance committee will evaluate candidates for nomination for election to the board of directors, including those recommended by stockholders on a substantially similar basis as it considers other nominees. Our Bylaws establish advance notice procedures with respect to the nomination of candidates for election as directors, other than nominations made by or at the direction of the board of directors or a committee of the board of directors. In order for any matter to be properly brought before a meeting, a stockholder will have to comply with advance notice requirements and provide us with certain information. Generally, to be timely, a stockholders notice must be received at our principal executive offices not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of stockholders. Our Bylaws also specify requirements as to the form and content of a stockholders notice.\n\n9\n\nOur Stockholders Agreement grants our Principal Stockholders the right to designate nominees to our board of directors subject to the maintenance of certain ownership requirements. Mr. Libman was designated by our Principal Stockholders in accordance with the Stockholders Agreement. For additional information on our Stockholders Agreement, see Transactions with Related PersonsStockholders Agreement.\n\nBackground and Experience of Directors\n\nWhen considering whether directors and nominees have the experience, qualifications, attributes or skills, taken as a whole, to enable the board of directors to satisfy its oversight responsibilities effectively in light of its business and structure, the board of directors focuses primarily on each persons background and experience as reflected in the information discussed in each of the directors individual biographies set forth above. We believe that our directors provide an appropriate mix of experience and skills relevant to the size and nature of our business. In particular, the members of our board of directors considered the following important characteristics, among others:\n\nControlled Company Exception\n\nOur Principal Stockholders control a majority of the combined voting power of all classes of the Companys stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors. As a result, the Company is a controlled company within the meaning of NYSE corporate governance standards. Under these corporate governance standards, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, group or another company is a controlled company and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance standards, including the requirements (1) that a majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors, (2) that the board of directors have a compensation committee that is comprised entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committees purpose and responsibilities and (3) that the board of directors have a nominating and corporate governance committee that is comprised entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committees purpose and responsibilities. Accordingly, you will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of these corporate governance requirements. In the event that the Company ceases to be a controlled company and the Companys shares continue to be listed on the NYSE, the Company will be required to comply with these provisions within the applicable transition periods.\n\nBoard Committees and Meetings\n\nThe board of directors has established an audit committee, compensation committee and nominating and corporate governance committee. The responsibilities of each committee are described below. The composition of the audit committee satisfies the NYSE listing standards and the independence standards of Rule 10A-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (as amended, the Exchange Act). The board of directors may also establish from time to time any other committees that it deems necessary or desirable.\n\n10\n\nMembers serve on these committees until their resignation or until otherwise determined by the board of directors.\n\nEach of the standing committees of the board of directors discussed below operate under written charters. The charters for our audit committee, compensation committee and nominating and corporate governance committee are available on our website under https://ir.financeofamerica.com/corporate-governance/governance-documents. The information contained on, or accessible from, our website is not a part of this report by reference or otherwise.\n\nThe following table summarizes the current membership of each of the Boards Committees.\n\nAudit\n\nCommittee Compensation\n\nCommittee Nominating and\n\nCorporate\n\nGovernance\n\nCommittee Director\n\nBrian L. Libman\n\nChair Chair X\n\nNorma C. Corio\n\nChair X\n\nRobert W. Lord\n\nX X X\n\nTyson A. Pratcher\n\nX X X\n\nLance N. West\n\nX X\n\nAll directors are expected to make their best effort to attend all meetings of the Board, meetings of the committees of which they are members and the annual meeting of stockholders. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Board held four meetings, the audit committee held five meetings, the compensation committee held three meetings and the nominating and corporate governance committee held two meetings. During fiscal year 2023, all of our directors attended at least 75% of the aggregate of the total number of meetings of the Board and committees during the time in which he or she served as a member of the Board or such committee. Additionally, four of our five directors attended the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders.\n\nAudit Committee\n\nOur audit committee consists of Ms. Corio and Messrs. Lord and Pratcher, with Ms. Corio serving as chair. Ms. Corio and Messrs. Lord and Pratcher qualify as independent directors under the NYSE listing standards and the independence standards of Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act. Our board of directors has determined that Ms. Corio qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as such term is defined in Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K and that all members of the audit committee satisfy the financial literacy requirements of the NYSE.\n\nOur audit committee is responsible for, among other things:\n\n11\n\nCode of Business Conduct and Ethics\n\nWe have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to all of our officers, directors and employees, including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer and controller, or persons performing similar functions, which is posted on our website at https://ir.financeofamerica.com/corporate-governance/governance-documents. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is a code of ethics, as defined in Item 406(b) of Regulation S-K. We will make any legally required disclosures regarding amendments to, or waivers of, provisions of our code of ethics on our website.\n\nCorporate Governance Guidelines\n\nOur commitment to good corporate governance is reflected in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, which describe our board of directors views and policies on a wide range of governance topics. These Corporate Governance Guidelines are reviewed from time to time by our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and, to the extent deemed appropriate in light of emerging practices, revised accordingly, upon recommendation to and approval by our board of directors. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines are available on our website at https://ir.financeofamerica.com/corporate-governance/governance-documents.\n\nExecutive Sessions\n\nExecutive sessions, which are meetings of the non-management members of the Board, are regularly scheduled throughout the year. Brian L. Libman presides at the executive sessions. In addition, at least once a year, the independent directors will meet in a private session that excludes management and any non-independent directors.\n\nLeadership Structure\n\nBrian L. Libman is our Chairman. As provided in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Board does not have a policy on whether or not the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer should be separate. Accordingly, the board of directors believes that it should be free to make a choice from time to time regarding a leadership structure that is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. At this time, the Board believes that Mr. Libman is best situated to serve as Chairman and that the Companys current separated roles of Chairperson and Chief Executive Officer is appropriate. Mr. Libman has extensive experience in the specialty finance area and has been involved in structuring and consummating the acquisitions of more than twenty businesses. Mr. Libman serves as Chairman. Effective April 5, 2023, Graham A. Fleming was appointed as our Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Fleming joined Finance of America in 2013 and served as President from late 2020 until he was named CEO in April 2023.\n\nWhenever the Chairman of the Board is also the Chief Executive Officer or is a director who does not otherwise qualify as an independent director, the independent directors may elect from among themselves a Lead Director of the Board. Following nomination by the nominating and corporate governance committee, the Lead Director will be elected by a plurality vote and should generally serve in such capacity for a minimum of one year. Service as Lead Director, however, generally should not exceed five consecutive years but is subject to the Boards discretion to set other guidelines in specific instances. The responsibilities of the Lead Director (if one has been elected) shall be determined from time to time by the Board, upon the recommendation of the nominating and corporate governance committee.\n\nCommunications with the Board\n\nAs described in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, anyone who would like to communicate with, or otherwise make his or her concerns known directly to the chairperson of any of the audit, nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees, any then-serving Lead Director or the director designated\n\n13\n\nby the non-management or independent directors as the presiding director, or to the non-management or independent directors as a group, may do so by addressing such communications or concerns to the Companys Chief Legal Officer, 5830 Granite Parkway, Suite 400, Plano, Texas 75024, who will forward such communication to the appropriate party.\n\nOversight of Risk Management\n\nThe Board has extensive involvement in the oversight of risk management related to us and our business. The Board exercises direct oversight of strategic risks to the Company in regular coordination with the Companys management. The audit committee reviews guidelines and policies governing the process by which senior management assesses and manages the Companys exposure to risk, including the Companys major financial and operational risk exposures and the steps management takes to monitor and control such exposures. The compensation committee oversees risks relating to the Companys compensation policies and practices. The nominating and corporate governance committee assists the Board by overseeing and evaluating programs and risks associated with Board organization, membership and structure and corporate governance. Each committee charged with risk oversight reports to the Board on those matters.\n\nHedging Policy\n\nOur securities trading policy prohibits company personnel and their related persons from engaging in any transactions involving any derivatives, including trading in futures and derivative securities, or hedging activities, including options, warrants, puts, call or other similar arrangements or instruments designed to hedge or offset decreases in the market value of securities, related to the Companys securities. Further, our securities trading policy provides that Company personnel and their related persons are prohibited from initiating any transactions that involve pledging any Company securities as collateral for a loan or holding Company securities as security in a margin account after the adoption of the policy.\n\nCorporate Responsibility Overview\n\nOur People\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had 922 U.S.-based employees. Of these, there were 919 full-time and 3 part-time employees. We had an additional 14 employees based in the Philippines. As of December 31, 2023, we also employed 18 full-time contractors. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we consider our employee relations to be good. Our long-term success as an organization depends upon our ability to maintain and develop our human capital.\n\nWe strive to foster an environment that is safe and healthy. We also strive to promote a strong culture across our business that recognizes the importance of respecting one another and our customers. These objectives are accomplished through a commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), an emphasis on training and development and the provision of a comprehensive benefits package with a focus on physical and mental wellness.\n\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion\n\nIn 2023, we continued our commitment to DEI and took steps to make that commitment clear to our employees, investors, stakeholders and future talent. Diversity is simply a fact in our geographically dispersed workforce. It is important to acknowledge our differences and the value that our varied experiences and perspectives can bring to the Company, which can lead to innovation and revenue growth. We believe that we can increase employee engagement and retention and improve recruitment of the best talent by creating an inclusive culture, compensating employees fairly and providing opportunities to grow and thrive.\n\n14\n\nEmployee Training and Development\n\nFinance of America utilizes a modern learning management platform that houses our centralized training and organizational development content, including compliance training. Our compliance training program covers an array of legal and regulatory topics. All consumer-facing employees are assigned required courses that educate them on compliance with consumer protection laws for the industries in which we operate. Required compliance training is reviewed not less than annually by representatives of the Compliance and Legal departments to ensure that necessary topics are included and that courses are assigned to all employees who are required to, or would benefit from, the training.\n\nAll new employees are assigned a series of training courses during onboarding, spanning topics such as ethics and insider trading, and are required to attest to our core Company policies such as our information security policy. Such policies are also accessible to employees on the Companys intranet site. New loan officers also participate in a comprehensive six-week instructor-led onboarding program called Sales Academy that encompasses practical training, real-time engagement with live leads, and personalized one-on-one coaching to our licensed reverse mortgage originators. This structured onboarding process is carefully crafted to acquaint new hires with the Companys culture, policies, procedures, systems, and the specifics of their roles and responsibilities. The primary objective is to equip employees with the essential knowledge, skills, and resources needed to adjust quickly to their new work environment, enabling them to make meaningful contributions to the organizations objectives.\n\nWe also require our entire workforce to periodically complete discrimination and harassment prevention training courses to ensure they understand what constitutes unlawful sexual harassment and discrimination, employees rights and available forums for adjudicating complaints. We send quarterly reminders to employees about the Companys anonymous hotline and encourage employees to utilize the hotline to report complaints and concerns.\n\nCompliance with consumer protection regulations is supported by robust technology and monitored by our Compliance department.\n\nEmployee Benefits and Wellness\n\nWe offer many benefits and wellness resources to our employees, including but not limited to our Employee Assistance Program, health insurance, dental insurance, vision insurance, life insurance, pet insurance, identity protection, flexible spending accounts and 401(k) plans with an employer match. We also offer paid time off or flex time off programs to full-time employees and an employee stock purchase plan. We partner with a leave of absence administration vendor to ensure efficient processing and management of leave requests. We carefully coordinate these available resources and ensure employees are aware of available resources. We also monitor the types of benefits available in the market and consider adding new benefits from time to time in order to better meet the needs of our employees.\n\nExecutive Officers of the Company\n\nSet forth below is certain information regarding each of our current executive officers.\n\nName\n\nAge\n\nPrincipal Occupation and Other Information\n\nGraham A. Fleming 54 Graham A. Fleming joined the Company in December 2013 and has served as Chief Executive Officer since April 2023. Prior to his current role, Mr. Fleming served as Interim Chief Executive Officer from July 2022 to April 2023 and as President from October 2020 to April 2023. Additionally, Mr. Fleming served as Interim Chief Financial Officer from October 2023 to November 2023. Throughout his tenure with the Company, Mr. Fleming has also acted as Chief Administrative Officer at each of the Companys operating subsidiaries, overseeing Finance,\n\n15\n\nPROPOSAL NO. 2NON-BINDING VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\n\nThe Company is requesting that stockholders vote, on a non-binding basis, to approve the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in the Executive Compensation section of this Proxy Statement and the tabular executive compensation disclosure, including the Summary Compensation Table and accompanying narrative disclosure. While the results of the vote are non-binding and advisory in nature, the Board intends to carefully consider the results of this vote. In 2022, our board of directors recommended, and our stockholders approved, an annual vote, on a non-binding basis, to approve the compensation of our named executive officers. Accordingly, we intend to conduct future advisory votes on the compensation of our named executive officers every year. The next advisory say-on-pay frequency vote is scheduled for 2028.\n\nThe text of the resolution in respect of Proposal No. 2 is as follows:\n\nRESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the Companys named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the compensation tables and related narrative discussion, is hereby APPROVED.\n\nAs described in the Executive Compensation section of this Proxy Statement, our executive compensation programs and underlying principles, as developed and administered by the compensation committee, are designed to provide competitive pay opportunities to support the attraction and retention of highly qualified executives while promoting our core values. Our executive compensation programs are structured to be consistent with our pay for performance philosophy and utilize performance measures that are intended to align the executive teams incentives with the long-term interests of the Company and its stockholders.\n\nIn considering their vote, stockholders may wish to review with care the information on our compensation policies and decisions regarding the named executive officers presented in the Executive Compensation section for Finance of America Companies Inc., as well as the discussion regarding the compensation committee presented in this Proxy Statement.\n\nYOUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE FOR THE APPROVAL OF THE COMPENSATION PAID TO OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS.\n\n18\n\nCompany, increasing her base salary from $400,000 to $650,000. Our named executive officers did not otherwise receive any adjustments to their base salaries for 2023.\n\nSalary Continuation Agreement\n\nThe Company entered into a salary continuation agreement with Jeremy E. Prahm on December 2, 2015, which provides the Company the option to pay Mr. Prahm his regular salary and any benefits (excluding bonus or other incentive compensation) for a period of the Companys choosing (not to exceed 6 months from the date of termination) in exchange for Mr. Prahms agreement to abide by certain restrictive covenants, including noncompetition, non-solicitation and confidentiality provisions. The agreement would be triggered by his voluntary separation from the Company and not by any other type of separation.\n\nNone of our other named executive officers are party to any arrangement that provides for severance benefits.\n\nAnnual Cash Incentive Compensation\n\nOur named executive officers were eligible to earn an annual cash incentive award targeted at an amount equal to a specified percentage of such named executive officers base salary. Awards to named executive officers were tied primarily to Company performance with some variability due to business unit performance. For 2023, target incentive payout amounts for each of the named executive officers were as follows:\n\nNamed Executive Officer\n\n2023 Base Salary\n\n($) Annual Incentive\n\nTarget\n\n% of Base Salary Annual Incentive\n\nTarget Payout ($) Annual Incentive\n\nAwarded ($)\n\nGraham A. Fleming\n\n850,000 147 % 1,250,000 650,000\n\nKristen N. Sieffert\n\n587,500 204 % 1,200,000 600,000\n\nJeremy E. Prahm\n\n850,000 147 % 1,250,000 650,000\n\nThe compensation committee, in its sole discretion, approves each named executive officers annual cash incentive award payout. For 2023, these decisions were based primarily on the compensation committees assessment of such named executive officers individual performance, operational performance of the business functions for which they have responsibility, and the officers potential to enhance and contribute to our equity owners long-term interests. In evaluating these factors, members of the compensation committee relied upon their judgment to determine the ultimate amount of a named executive officers annual cash incentive payment that the compensation committee believed was necessary to properly incentivize the named executive officer to seek to achieve our objectives and reward a named executive officer for achieving those objectives over the course of the year. Key factors the compensation committee considered in making such determination with respect to Mr. Fleming were his role in overseeing the operations of the Company and his leadership on the strategic direction of the Company generally. Key factors that the compensation committee considered in making such determination with respect to Ms. Sieffert were her leadership in the Companys development of a streamlined retirement solutions platform, including the integration of the operational assets of American Advisors Group acquired as described under Transactions with Related PersonsAmerican Advisors Group Transaction. Key factors the compensation committee considered in making such determination with respect to Mr. Prahm were his role in overseeing and managing the strategic direction of the Companys Portfolio Management segment.\n\nLong-Term Equity Incentives\n\nThe Company maintains the Finance of America Companies Inc. 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the Omnibus Plan) to provide employees and directors of FOA with additional incentives to promote the long-term growth and performance of the Company and to further align the interests of our directors and management with the interests of our stockholders by increasing their ownership interests in the common stock of the Company. The Omnibus Plan is administered by the compensation committee. In 2023, as a long-term incentive, Mr. Fleming,\n\n20\n\nMs. Sieffert and Mr. Prahm each received a restricted stock unit (RSU) grant of 1,209,678, 403,226 and 1,209,678 units, respectively. Such RSUs vest ratably over a prospective three-year period, subject to the grantees continued employment on the vesting date. See Summary Compensation Table  Stock Awards for the grant date fair value of each named executive officers RSU award.\n\nCommencing in 2024, the Company may grant stock options to its named executive officers pursuant to the terms of the Omnibus Plan. Such stock options would generally vest on the second anniversary from the date of grant (subject to the named executive officers continued employment on the vesting date), be exercisable for a period of five years from the date of grant, and have an exercise price equal to the greater of the fair market value of one share of Class A Common Stock on the date of grant and $2.50.\n\nAmended and Restated Management Long-Term Incentive Plan\n\nThe UFG Holdings LLC Management Long-Term Incentive Plan (the MLTIP) was established by UFG Holdings LLC (UFG), the Companys predecessor holding company, on January 1, 2015 to provide an incentive to key employees to continue in the employment of UFG and to improve the growth and profitability of UFG. In connection with the execution of the transaction agreement, by and among Replay, FoA Equity, and the other parties thereto, dated as of October 12, 2020 (the Transaction Agreement), UFG adopted the Amended and Restated UFG Holdings LLC Management Long-Term Incentive Plan (the A&R MLTIP), effective as of the date the Transaction Agreement was executed, which amended and restated the MLTIP.\n\nUnder the terms of the A&R MLTIP, participants (including Mr. Fleming, Ms. Sieffert and Mr. Prahm) were entitled to receive, subject to the terms and conditions of the A&R MLTIP, in consideration for the cancellation of legacy phantom units previously granted to such participants under the MLTIP, (i) a cash payment promptly following April 1, 2021, the closing date of the Business Combination, (ii) a grant of restricted stock units under the Omnibus Plan (such restricted stock units referred to herein as the Replacement RSUs) and (iii) the right to receive additional shares of Class A Common Stock upon the occurrence of, at any time during the six years following the closing of the Business Combination, (a) the average trading price of our Class A Common Stock meeting or exceeding $12.50 for any 20 trading days within a period of 30 consecutive trading days (the date when the foregoing is first satisfied, the First Earnout Achievement Date) or (b) the average trading price of the Class A Common Stock is $15.00 or greater for any 20 trading days within a period of 30 consecutive trading days (the date when the foregoing is first satisfied, the Second Earnout Achievement Date; such rights collectively, the Earnout Rights). The Earnout Rights are subject to the same service requirements as the Replacement RSUs, as described below. The A&R MLTIP is administered by the compensation committee of the Company, such administrative body being referred to herein as the Administrator.\n\nAs described above, the Earnout Rights will vest upon the occurrence of certain market-based events (in each instance, an Earnout Date). As applicable, each participant shall receive the right to receive a number of additional shares of Class A Common Stock equal to the product of (i) 900,000 and (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of Replacement RSUs granted to such participant and the denominator of which is equal to the quotient of (x) the Retained Value (as defined below) divided by (y) the Closing Price (as defined below). The Earnout Rights are subject to the same vesting conditions as the Replacement RSUs to which they relate and will settle at the same time as such Replacement RSUs; provided that, to the extent that a Replacement RSU has settled prior to the occurrence of the applicable Earnout Date, any Earnout Rights in respect of such Replacement RSUs will be vested as of the occurrence of the applicable Earnout Date and will be settled promptly following such Earnout Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that any Replacement RSUs are forfeited on or prior to the occurrence of an Earnout Date, for purposes of calculating such participants Earnout Rights with respect to such Earnout Date, the amount in the numerator of the fraction described in clause (ii) of the first sentence of this paragraph will be reduced by the number of Replacement RSUs forfeited by such participant on or prior to the applicable Earnout Date.\n\nThe terms of the A&R MLTIP provided that, to the extent that the holders of FoA Units (following the Business Combination) as of immediately following the preBusiness Combination closing reorganization (the Original\n\n21\n\nUnitholders) receive (i) cash distributions (other than tax distributions) and (ii) cash amounts in respect of a transfer of such FoA Units, together with all prior distributions in connection with the closing of the Business Combination, in excess of a specified hurdle amount equal to the sum of (x) $250,000,000, (y) any capital contributions made to the Company after January 1, 2015, and (z) an amount equal to a fifteen percent (15%) return on capital contributions made to the Company after January 1, 2015, compounded annually (such distributions, Eligible Distributions), each participant holding phantom units who is actively employed by one of FoA Equity, its affiliates, subsidiaries or successors or, following the closing of the Business Combination, the Company (for purposes of the A&R MLTIP, referred to herein collectively as, the Company Group) on the closing date of the Business Combination would be entitled to receive an amount equal to the product of (i) such Eligible Distribution, (ii) 10% and (iii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of phantom units held by such participant and the denominator of which is 1,250, payable promptly following the closing of the Business Combination (Eligible Distribution Award).\n\nOriginal Unitholders received an Eligible Distribution in connection with the closing of the Business Combination, and, accordingly, participants in the A&R MLTIP who were employed by a member of the Company Group on the closing date of the Business Combination (the A&R MLTIP Participants) became entitled to receive their respective Eligible Distribution Award, subject to satisfaction of the Release Requirement (defined below). In connection with the Business Combination and pursuant to the terms of the Transaction Agreement, the Original Unitholders elected to reduce the amount of the pre-closing distributions permitted under the Transaction Agreement to which they would have otherwise been entitled by an amount equal to the aggregate Eligible Distribution Award payable to the A&R MLTIP Participants. Accordingly, the Eligible Distribution Award payable to the A&R MLTIP Participants was borne economically by the Original Unitholders and any rights to repayment or tax deductions associated therewith was allocated to the Original Unitholders. Under the A&R MLTIP, the Administrator had the discretion to pay Eligible Distribution Award in the form of cash, Class A Common Stock, other equity securities or property or any combination. The Administrator determined to pay the Eligible Distribution Awards in cash, and such amounts were paid to participants on or around April 23, 2021.\n\nIn addition, on June 17, 2021, pursuant to the terms of the A&R MLTIP, the Company granted to each participant (including Mr. Fleming, Ms. Sieffert and Mr. Prahm) that (i) held phantom units as of the closing date of the Business Combination and (ii) remained employed with the Company Group as of the RSU Grant Date (as defined below), in consideration for the cancellation of the participants phantom units, a number of Replacement RSUs (rounded to the nearest whole number, with 0.5 rounding up) equal to the product of (x) the number of phantom units held by such participant as of the closing date of the Business Combination and (y) the quotient of (A) the Retained Value per Phantom Unit divided by (B) the Closing Price (the date of grant of such Replacement RSUs, the RSU Grant Date). For purposes hereof:\n\n\n\nClosing Price equaled $10 per share;\n\nThe Replacement RSUs have the following terms:\n\n22\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing to the contrary, in the event that a participant experiences a termination of employment other than a termination (i) by the applicable member of the Company Group who employs such participant (the Employer) for Cause (as defined in the A&R MLTIP) or (ii) by the participant when grounds for Cause exist, in each case, prior to the RSU Grant Date, the Company will issue, or shall cause to be issued, to such participant a number of shares of Class A Common Stock equal to (x) if such termination is a termination of such participants employment by the Employer without Cause, by the participant for Good Reason (as defined in the A&R MLTIP), or as a result of the Participants death or disability (as defined in the A&R MLTIP) (each of the foregoing terminations referred to herein as a Good Leaver Termination), the number of shares of Class A Common Stock underlying the Replacement RSUs that such participant would have received had they remained employed with the Employer as of the RSU Grant Date or (y) if such termination is not a Good Leaver Termination, the number of shares of Class A Common Stock underlying the Grant Date RSUs that such Participant would have received had they remained employed with the Employer as of the RSU Grant Date; provided, that in the sole discretion of the Administrator, the obligations to issue shares of Class A Common Stock may be fully or partially satisfied by the Company causing the Employer to make such participant a cash payment equal to the fair market value of all or some portion of the common stock as of the date of the participants termination of employment.\n\nIn the event that a participant experiences a Good Leaver Termination and such participant holds any unvested Replacement RSUs as of the date of such Good Leaver Termination, such Replacement RSUs will become vested as of such date. Such Replacement RSUs will be settled promptly following the date of such Good Leaver Termination. The compensation committee may, in its sole discretion, accelerate the vesting of any Replacement RSUs without the consent of a participant.\n\nThe Replacement RSUs (and the associated Earnout Rights) were issued pursuant to the Omnibus Plan and each are considered a Substitute Award for purposes thereof. In the sole discretion of the compensation committee, the obligations to issue shares of Class A Common Stock may be fully or partially satisfied by the Company causing the Employer to make to such participant a cash payment equal to the fair market value of all or some portion of the Class A Common Stock otherwise required to be issued.\n\nExcept in the event of a Good Leaver Termination (described above), any outstanding unvested Replacement RSUs (and the corresponding Earnout Rights) will be forfeited immediately upon a Participants termination of employment for any reason. The participant will be entitled to retain any amounts previously paid or shares of Class A Common Stock issued or transferred to such participant in respect of his or her phantom units or Replacement RSUs (including subsequent Earnout Rights which are due to such participant in respect of Replacement RSUs which are not otherwise forfeited as described above), as applicable, prior to any termination of employment, provided that, if the Company Group terminates the participants employment for Cause or such participant has violated any of the restrictive covenants set forth in any confidentiality, non-solicitation, non-competition or similar agreements entered into by the participant and any member of the Company Group, any unrealized Earnout Rights held by such participant shall be forfeited, and the participant (or his or her estate, as applicable) shall be required to repay to the Employer any amounts previously paid in respect of any phantom units or gain realized on Replacement RSUs or Class A Common Stock issued pursuant to the A&R MLTIP, as applicable, held by such participant (as reduced by any taxes paid in connection with the distributions that are not recovered by deduction, credit or otherwise), without further adjustment for earnings, losses or similar items.\n\n23\n\nAs a condition to the receipt of any cash, shares of Class A Common Stock or restricted stock units, as applicable, pursuant to the A&R MLTIP, participants were required to agree in writing that such receipt is in full satisfaction of any rights or payments owed to such participant under the A&R MLTIP or the MLTIP and that the Company Group shall be released from any further liability other than its satisfaction of the obligations to make payments pursuant to the A&R MLTIP (the Release Requirement).\n\nAs discussed further below, the obligations of the members of the Company Group to make cash payments and/or deliver shares of Class A Common Stock, whether pursuant to the Replacement RSUs or in connection with the Earnout Right, in each case, under the A&R MLTIP, will be borne economically by the Original Unitholders and any rights to repayment or tax deductions associated therewith will be allocated to the Original Unitholders.\n\nLTIP Award Settlement Agreement\n\nIn connection with the Business Combination, the Company entered into an LTIP Award Settlement Agreement (the LTIP Award Settlement Agreement), dated as of October 12, 2020, by and among the Company, FoA Equity, and the Original Unitholders, including the Principal Stockholders, pursuant to which such stockholders agreed to pay and bear the economic consequences to the Company of the obligation to settle the Replacement RSU awards. Accordingly, in connection with the settlement of each vested Replacement RSU award and any related Earnout Rights for which the earnout condition is achieved, such stockholders will deliver to the Company FoA Units and shares of Class A Common Stock, as applicable, in settlement of the awards in accordance with the terms set forth in the LTIP Award Settlement Agreement. Until the earlier of the sixth anniversary of the closing date of the Business Combination or such earlier date when all outstanding Replacement RSU and Earnout Right awards have been settled or otherwise forfeited, the Original Unitholders have agreed to reserve, and not to transfer, a portion of their FoA Units and shares of Class A Common Stock, as the case may be, for future delivery to FoA Equity in connection with the settlement of awards under the A&R MLTIP.\n\n24\n\nPROPOSAL NO. 3RATIFICATION OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n\nThe audit committee has selected BDO USA, P.C. to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2024. Although ratification is not required by our Bylaws or otherwise, the Board is submitting the selection of BDO USA, P.C. to our stockholders for ratification because we value our stockholders views on the Companys independent registered public accounting firm. If our stockholders fail to ratify the selection, it will be considered as notice to the Board and the audit committee to consider the selection of a different firm. Even if the selection is ratified, the audit committee, in its discretion, may select a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders.\n\nA representative of BDO USA, P.C. is expected to be present at the Annual Meeting. The representative will also have the opportunity to make a statement if he or she desires to do so, and the representative is expected to be available to respond to appropriate questions.\n\nThe shares represented by your proxy will be voted FOR the ratification of the selection of BDO USA, P.C. unless you specify otherwise.\n\nAudit and Non-Audit Fees\n\nThe following table presents the aggregate fees billed for professional services rendered by BDO for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022.\n\nAudit Committees Pre-Approval Policy\n\nIt is the audit committees policy to pre-approve all auditing services and non-audit services (other than prohibited non-audit services) to be provided to the Company by its independent registered public accounting firm. The audit committee may delegate authority to one or more independent members to grant pre-approvals of audit and permitted non-audit services. Unless otherwise provided by the audit committee, the audit committee chairperson (provided such audit committee chairperson is independent) is hereby authorized to pre-approve audit and permitted non-audit services as necessary. Any pre-approvals made by the audit committee chairperson or such other independent member of the audit committee to whom such authority has been delegated shall be presented to the full audit committee at its next scheduled meeting. The Companys audit committee pre-approved all of BDOs services for 2022 and 2023 and, in doing so, considered whether the provision of such services is compatible with maintaining independence.\n\n31\n\nREPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE\n\nThe Board of Directors has determined that all of the members of the Audit Committee meet the independence and experience requirements of The New York Stock Exchange, or the NYSE, and that Ms. Corio is an audit committee financial expert within the meaning of the applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, and the NYSE.\n\nManagement of the Company is responsible for our overall financial reporting process. BDO USA, P.C. (BDO), our independent registered public accounting firm, is responsible for expressing opinions on the conformity of our audited consolidated financial statements with U.S. GAAP. The Audit Committees (the Committee) responsibility is to oversee these processes and, necessarily, in its oversight role, the Committee relies on the work and assurances of management and of BDO. The Committee is also solely responsible for the selection and termination of our independent registered public accounting firm, including the approval of audit fees and any non-audit services provided by and fees paid to the independent registered public accounting firm.\n\nThe Committee:\n\n\n\nmet five times in 2023;\n\nIn reliance on these reviews and discussions, and the report of BDO, the Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited consolidated financial statements be included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, for filing with the SEC.\n\nThis report was submitted by the Committee and shall not be deemed to be soliciting material or to be filed with the SEC or subject to Regulation 14A promulgated by the SEC or Section 18 of the Exchange Act.\n\nAudit Committee Members Norma C. Corio-Chair Robert W. Lord Tyson A. Pratcher\n\n33\n\nSECURITY OWNERSHIP OF PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDERS AND DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS\n\nThe following table sets forth information regarding the beneficial ownership of shares of the Companys Class A Common Stock as of March 18, 2024 by:\n\nBeneficial ownership is determined according to the rules of the SEC, which generally provide that a person has beneficial ownership of a security if he, she or it possesses sole or shared voting or investment power over that security, including options and warrants that are currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days.\n\nThe beneficial ownership of the shares of Class A Common Stock of the Company is based on 96,561,759 vested shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding as of March 18, 2024 and 15 shares of Class B Common Stock outstanding as of March 18, 2024. The shares of Class B Common Stock have no economic rights, but entitle each holder, without regard to the number of shares of Class B Common Stock held by such holder, to a number of votes that is equal to the aggregate number of FoA Units held by such holder on all matters on which stockholders of the Company are entitled to vote generally. Holders of shares of Class B Common Stock vote together with holders of Class A Common Stock as a single class on all matters on which stockholders are entitled to vote generally, except as otherwise required by law.\n\nThe beneficial ownership information below excludes 4,258,500 unvested shares of Class A Common Stock held by Replay Sponsor, LLC, which are subject to vesting and forfeiture and will not be entitled to receive any dividends or other distributions, or to have any other economic rights until such shares are vested, and such shares will not be entitled to receive back dividends or other distributions or any other form of economic catch-up once they become vested. Additionally, for so long as they remain unvested, such shares must be voted proportionately with all other shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock on all matters put to a vote of holders of the Companys voting stock (i.e., holders of unvested shares will have no discretion in how such shares are voted).\n\nThe beneficial ownership information below excludes the shares underlying the warrants, the securities which were issued as an additional earnout payment in connection with the Business Combination (the Earnout Securities) and the shares expected to be issued or reserved under the Omnibus Plan, which are not deemed beneficially owned under the rules of the SEC.\n\nUnless otherwise indicated, we believe that all persons named in the table have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares beneficially owned by them.

The address of each of such Blackstone entities and Mr. Schwarzman is c/o Blackstone Inc., 345 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10154.\n\n36\n\nTRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PERSONS\n\nStockholders Agreement\n\nIn connection with the Business Combination, concurrently with the closing of the Business Combination, the Company and certain pre-closing equityholders of FoA Equity entered into the Stockholders Agreement.\n\nPursuant to the Stockholders Agreement, each of the Blackstone Investors and BL Investors are entitled to nominate a certain number of directors to the board of directors, based on each such holders ownership of the voting securities of the Company. The nomination rights of each Principal Stockholder are substantially identical and subject to the same terms, conditions and requirements. The number of directors that each of the Blackstone Investors and the BL Investors will separately be entitled to designate to the board of directors increases and/or decreases on a sliding scale such that, for example, if the Blackstone Investors or the BL Investors, as the case may be, hold more than 40% of the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock, assuming a full exchange of all FoA Units for the publicly traded Class A Common Stock, such applicable investors will be entitled to designate the lowest whole number of directors that is greater than 40% of the members of the board of directors; if the Blackstone Investors or the BL Investors, as the case may be, hold between 30% and 40% of such outstanding shares, such applicable investors will be entitled to designate the lowest whole number of directors that is greater than 30% of the members of the board of directors; if the Blackstone Investors or the BL Investors, as the case may be, hold between 20% and 30% of such outstanding shares, such applicable investors will be entitled to designate the lowest whole number of directors that is greater than 20% of the members of the board of directors; and if the Blackstone Investors or the BL Investors, as the case may be, hold between 5% and 20% of such outstanding shares, such applicable investors will be entitled to designate the lowest whole number of directors that is greater than 10% of the members of the board of directors.\n\nThe Stockholders Agreement also provides each Principal Stockholder with basic information and management rights, as well as detailed venture capital operating company covenants. In addition, the Stockholders Agreement permits the Companys Principal Stockholders to assign their rights and obligations under the agreement, in whole or in part, without the Companys prior written consent. Furthermore, the Stockholders Agreement also requires the Company to cooperate with the Principal Stockholders in connection with certain future pledges, hypothecations, grants of security interest in or transfers (including to third party investors) of any or all of the FoA Units held by the Principal Stockholders, including to banks or financial institutions as collateral or security for loans, advances or extensions of credit.\n\nUnless earlier terminated by agreement of the Principal Stockholders and the board of directors, the Stockholders Agreement will terminate as to each Principal Stockholder at such time as such Principal Stockholder and its affiliates collectively hold less than 5% of the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock, assuming a full exchange of all FoA Units for the publicly traded Class A Common Stock. In addition, prior to the closing of the Business Combination, the Blackstone Investors and the BL Investors entered into a letter agreement pursuant to which the Blackstone Investors and the BL Investors agreed, among other things, to permit the Blackstone Investors to have priority over the BL Investors with respect to certain sales notwithstanding the terms of the Stockholders Agreement or the Registration Rights Agreement.\n\nExchange Agreement\n\nIn connection with the Business Combination, concurrently with the closing of the Business Combination, the Company, FoA Equity and the Sellers (as defined therein) entered into an Exchange Agreement (the Exchange Agreement). The Exchange Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions upon which holders of FoA Units may exchange their FoA Units for shares of Class A Common Stock on a one-for-one basis, subject to customary conversion rate adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends and reclassifications. Each holder of FoA Units (other than the Company and its subsidiaries), and certain permitted transferees thereof, may on a quarterly basis (subject to the terms of the Exchange Agreement) exchange their FoA Units for shares of Class A Common\n\n38\n\nStock. In addition, subject to certain requirements, the Blackstone Investors and the BL Investors are generally permitted to exchange FoA Units for shares of Class A Common Stock provided that the number of FoA Units surrendered in such exchanges during any 30-calendar day period represents, in the aggregate, greater than 2% of total interests in partnership capital or profits. The Company may impose restrictions on exchange that it determines to be necessary or advisable so that the Company is not treated as a publicly traded partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a holder exchanges FoA Units for shares of Class A Common Stock, the voting power afforded to such holder of FoA Units by their shares of Class B Common Stock is automatically and correspondingly reduced and the number of FoA Units held by the Company is correspondingly increased as it acquires the exchanged FoA Units. For example, if a holder of Class B Common Stock holds 1,000 FoA Units as of the record date for determining stockholders of the Company that are entitled to vote on a particular matter, such holder will be entitled by virtue of such holders Class B Common Stock to 1,000 votes on such matter. If, however, such holder were to hold 500 FoA Units as of the relevant record date, such holder would be entitled by virtue of such holders Class B Common Stock to 500 votes on such matter.\n\nRegistration Rights Agreement\n\nIn connection with the Business Combination, concurrently with the closing thereof, the Company and the Principal Stockholders entered into a Registration Rights Agreement (the Registration Rights Agreement). Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, upon the demand of any Principal Stockholder, the Company will be required to facilitate a non-shelf registered offering of the Companys shares requested by such Principal Stockholder to be included in such offering. Any demanded non-shelf registered offering may, at the Companys option, include Company shares to be sold by the Company for its own account and will also include registrable shares to be sold by holders that exercise their related piggyback rights in accordance with the Registration Rights Agreement. Within 90 days after receipt of a demand for such registration, the Company will be required to use its reasonable best efforts to file a registration statement relating to such demand. In certain circumstances, Principal Stockholders will be entitled to piggyback registration rights in connection with the demand of a non-shelf registered offering. In addition, the Registration Rights Agreement entitles the Principal Stockholders to demand and be included in a shelf registration when the Company is eligible to sell its Company shares in a secondary offering on a delayed or continuous basis in accordance with Rule 415 of the Securities Act. Within 45 days (in the case of a shelf registration on Form S-1) or 30 days (in the case of a shelf registration on Form S-3) after receipt of a demand for such registration, the Company will be required to use its reasonable best efforts to file a registration statement relating to such demand. Moreover, upon the demand of a Principal Stockholder, the Company will be required to facilitate in the manner described in the Registration Rights Agreement a takedown off of an effective shelf registration statement of registrable shares requested by such Principal Stockholder.\n\nThe Registration Rights Agreement also provides that the Company will pay certain expenses relating to such registrations and indemnify the registration rights holders against (or make contributions in respect of) certain liabilities which may arise under the Securities Act.\n\nAmerican Advisors Group Transaction\n\nOn March 31, 2023, through FAR, an indirect subsidiary of the Company, the Company acquired a substantial majority of the assets and certain of the liabilities of American Advisors Group, a California corporation (AAG/Bloom, NKA Bloom Retirement Holdings Inc.), including, among other things, certain residential reverse mortgage loans and the right to service certain mortgage loans originated pursuant to the Federal Housing Administrations Home Equity Conversion Mortgage program, pursuant to (i) an Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of December 6, 2022, by and between the Company, FoA Equity, FAR, AAG/Bloom and, for the limited purposes described therein, Reza Jahangiri, an individual residing in the State of California (the AAG Principal), (ii) a Servicing Rights Purchase and Sale Agreement, dated as of December 6, 2022, by and between FAR and AAG/Bloom and (iii) a Loan Sale Agreement, dated as of December 6, 2022 (the foregoing agreements, as amended by the Amendment Agreement, dated as of March 31, 2023, by and among FoA Equity, FAR, AAG/Bloom and AAG Principal, the AAG Agreements and such acquisition, the AAG Transaction).\n\n39\n\nPursuant to the AAG Agreements, in consideration for the assets acquired thereunder, on the Closing Date, (i) FAR paid to AAG/Bloom $5.5 million in cash and issued to AAG/Bloom a promissory note with an aggregate principal amount of $4.5 million (which was paid in July 2023 in accordance with its terms), (ii) the Company issued to AAG/Bloom one share of Class B Common Stock and (iii) FoA Equity issued to AAG/Bloom 19,692,990 FoA Units (the Closing FoA Units). The AAG Agreements provide that FoA Equity may issue to AAG/Bloom up to 14,200,676 additional FoA Units (the Additional FoA Units), upon the occurrence of certain events (none of which have occurred as of December 31, 2023) and subject to reduction based upon certain offset rights.\n\nOf the Additional FoA Units, 7,142,260 FoA Units represent indemnity holdback units (the Indemnity Holdback Units). The Indemnity Holdback Units are issuable to AAG/Bloom in certain increments on the second and third anniversary of the closing date of the AAG Transactions and, until such time, are subject to offset in the event of a claim for indemnification by the Company pursuant to the terms of the AAG Agreements (Buyer Indemnification Claims). As of December 31, 2023, the Indemnity Holdback Units have been reduced by 63,263 FoA Units to offset the Companys losses incurred in connection with certain Buyer Indemnification Claims. Further, pursuant to the AAG Agreements, the Company agreed, for a period of three years following the closing date of the AAG Transaction, to fund costs and expenses arising from certain specified litigation liabilities (the Specified Litigation Expenses) in an aggregate amount up to $5 million (the Litigation Expense Cap). To the extent incurred, the Company is entitled to offset Specified Litigation Expenses in excess of $2.1 million and up to the Litigation Expense Cap against the Indemnity Holdback Units. As of December 31, 2023, the Company has paid $375,583 of such Specified Litigation Expenses, without offset against the Indemnity Holdback Units.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, AAG/Bloom owns 11,692,990 FoA Units (representing (a) 19,692,990 Closing FoA Units, minus (b) 8,000,000 Closing FoA Units already exchanged for 8,000,000 shares of Class A Common Stock), which FoA Units are exchangeable for 11,692,990 shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant to the Exchange Agreement. As of December 31, 2023, 14,137,413 FoA Units remain issuable (but are not already issued) to AAG/Bloom under the AAG Purchase Agreements (representing (a) 14,200,676 Additional FoA Units, minus (b) 63,263 Indemnity Holdback Units already reduced from the Indemnity Holdback Units to offset the Companys losses incurred in connection with certain Buyer Indemnification Claims), which FoA Units would be exchangeable for 14,137,413 shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant to the Exchange Agreement.\n\nIn connection with the AAG Transaction, the Company and FoA Equity entered into an Equity Matters Agreement (the Equity Matters Agreement) with AAG/Bloom pursuant to which, among other things, AAG/Bloom joined and became a party to (i) the A&R LLC Agreement (as defined and described below), as a Member thereunder, (ii) the Exchange Agreement, as an LLC Unitholder thereunder and (iii) the Registration Rights Agreement, as an Other Holder thereunder. Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, AAG/Bloom is permitted to exchange its FoA Units for shares of Company Class A Common Stock on a one-for-one basis, subject to customary conversion rate adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends and reclassifications. The Equity Matters Agreement also provides AAG/Bloom with demand rights under the Registration Rights Agreement, which would obligate the Company to file a registration statement upon a demand by AAG/Bloom starting from the date that is 71 days following the closing date of the AAG Transaction.\n\nEquity Investments\n\nOn March 31, 2023, the Company issued and sold 10,869,566 shares of Company Class A Common Stock to each of (i) BTO Urban Holdings L.L.C., Blackstone Family Tactical Opportunities Investment Partnership -NQ -ESC L.P. and BTO Urban Holdings II L.P. (collectively, the Blackstone Investor) and (ii) Libman Family Holdings, LLC (together with the Blackstone Investor, the Investors), in exchange for an aggregate purchase price of $15,000,000 paid by each of the Investors, pursuant to separate Stock Purchase Agreements, dated as of December 6, 2022, by and between the Company and each of the Investors (each, a Stock Purchase Agreement and such issuance and sale, the Equity Investments). Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreements,\n\n40\n\nthe Company agreed to use the proceeds of the Equity Investments (i) for general corporate purposes and/or (ii) to fund or reimburse amounts to be paid by the Company or its subsidiaries in connection with the AAG Transaction.\n\nTax Receivable Agreements\n\nIn connection with the Business Combination, concurrently with the closing thereof, the Company entered into a Tax Receivable Agreement with certain funds affiliated with Blackstone (the Blackstone Tax Receivable Agreement) and a Tax Receivable Agreement with certain other members of FoA Equity (the FoA Tax Receivable Agreement, and collectively with the Blackstone Tax Receivable Agreement, the Tax Receivable Agreements). The Tax Receivable Agreements generally provide for the payment by the Company to certain owners of FoA Equity prior to the Business Combination (the TRA Parties) of 85% of the cash tax benefits, if any, that the Company is deemed to realize (calculated using certain simplifying assumptions) as a result of (i) tax basis adjustments as a result of sales and exchanges of units in connection with or following the Business Combination and certain distributions with respect to units, (ii) the Companys utilization of certain tax attributes attributable to Blocker or the Blocker Shareholders (as defined in the Tax Receivable Agreements), and certain other tax benefits related to entering into the Tax Receivable Agreements, including tax benefits attributable to making payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements. These tax basis adjustments generated over time may increase (for tax purposes) the depreciation and amortization deductions available to the Company and, therefore, may reduce the amount of U.S. federal, state and local tax that the Company would otherwise be required to pay in the future, although the IRS may challenge all or part of the validity of that tax basis, and a court could sustain such challenge. The tax basis adjustments upon sales or exchanges of units for shares of Class A Common Stock and certain distributions with respect to units may also decrease gains (or increase losses) on future dispositions of certain assets to the extent tax basis is allocated to those assets. Actual tax benefits realized by the Company may differ from tax benefits calculated under the Tax Receivable Agreements as a result of the use of certain assumptions in the Tax Receivable Agreements, including the use of an assumed weighted-average state and local income tax rate to calculate tax benefits. The payment obligation under the Tax Receivable Agreements is an obligation of the Company and not of FoA Equity. The Company will generally retain the benefit of the remaining 15% of these cash tax benefits.\n\nFor purposes of the Tax Receivable Agreements, the cash tax benefits will be computed by comparing the actual income tax liability of the Company to the amount of such taxes that the Company would have been required to pay had there been no tax basis adjustments of the assets of FoA Equity as a result of sales or exchanges or certain distributions with respect to the units, no utilization of certain tax attributes attributable to the Blocker or the Blocker Shareholders, and had the Company not entered into the Tax Receivable Agreements. The actual and hypothetical tax liabilities determined in the Tax Receivable Agreements will be calculated using the actual U.S. federal income tax rate in effect for the applicable period and an assumed, weighted-average state and local income tax rate based on apportionment factors for the applicable period (along with the use of certain other assumptions). The term of the Tax Receivable Agreements will continue until all such tax benefits have been utilized or expired, unless the Company exercises its right to terminate the Tax Receivable Agreements early, certain changes of control occur, or the Company breaches any of its material obligations under either the Blackstone Tax Receivable Agreement or the FoA Tax Receivable Agreement, in which case all obligations generally will be accelerated and due as if the Company had exercised its right to terminate the Tax Receivable Agreements (as described below).\n\nEstimating the amount of payments that may be made under the Tax Receivable Agreements is by its nature imprecise, insofar as the calculation of amounts payable depends on a variety of factors, including:\n\n41\n\nAs a result of the size of the anticipated tax basis adjustment of the tangible and intangible assets of FoA Equity and the Companys possible utilization of certain tax attributes, the payments that the Company may make under the Tax Receivable Agreements are expected to be substantial. There may be a material negative effect on our liquidity if, as a result of timing discrepancies or otherwise, the payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements exceed the actual cash tax savings that the Company realizes in respect of the tax attributes subject to the Tax Receivable Agreements and/or distributions to the Company by FoA Equity are not sufficient to permit the Company to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements after it has paid taxes. Late payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements generally will accrue interest at an uncapped rate equal to LIBOR plus 500 basis points. The payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements are not conditioned upon continued ownership of the Company or FoA Equity by the Continuing Unitholders.\n\nIf the Company exercises its right to terminate the Tax Receivable Agreements or in the case of a change in control of the Company or a material breach of the Companys obligations under either the Blackstone Tax Receivable Agreement or the FoA Tax Receivable Agreement, all obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreements will be accelerated and the Company will be required to make a payment to the TRA Parties in an amount equal to the present value of future payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements, which payment would be based on certain assumptions, including an assumption that any FoA Units that have not been exchanged are deemed exchange for the market value of Class A Common Stock at the time of the termination or the change of control and an assumption the Company would have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize all potential future tax benefits that are subject to the Tax Receivable Agreements. As a result of the foregoing, (i) the Company could be required to make cash payments to the TRA Parties that are greater than the specified percentage of the actual benefits the Company ultimately realizes in respect of the tax benefits that are subject to the Tax Receivable Agreements, and (ii) the Company would be required to make a cash payment equal to the present value of the anticipated future tax benefits that are the subject of the Tax Receivable Agreements, which payment may be made significantly in advance of the actual realization, if any, of such future tax benefits. In these situations, the Companys obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreements could have a substantial negative impact on its liquidity and could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combination, or other changes of control due to the additional transaction\n\n42\n\ncosts a potential acquirer may attribute to satisfying such obligations. The Company accounts for obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreements arising from exchanges in connection with the Business Combination at fair value and records obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreements resulting from exchanges subsequent to the Business Combination, as they occur, at the gross undiscounted amount of the expected future payments as an increase to the liability along with the deferred tax asset and valuation allowance (if any) with an offset to additional paid-in capital. If the Company determines that it is no longer probable that a related contingent payment will be required based on expected future cash flows, a reversal of the liability is recorded through earnings.\n\nDecisions made by certain of the TRA Parties in the course of running our business may influence the timing and amount of payments that are received by an exchanging or selling existing owner under the Tax Receivable Agreements. For example, the earlier disposition of assets following an exchange or acquisition transaction generally will accelerate payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements and increase the present value of such payments, and the disposition of assets before an exchange or acquisition transaction will increase a TRA Partys tax liability without giving rise to any rights of a TRA Party to receive payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements.\n\nPayments under the Tax Receivable Agreements will be based on the tax reporting positions that we will determine. The Company will not be reimbursed for any cash payments previously made to the TRA Parties pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreements if any tax benefits initially claimed by the Company are subsequently challenged by a taxing authority and are ultimately disallowed. Instead, any excess cash payments made by the Company to a TRA Parties will be netted against any future cash payments that the Company might otherwise be required to make under the terms of the Tax Receivable Agreements. As a result, it is possible that the Company could make cash payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements that are substantially greater than its actual cash tax savings.\n\nFoA Equity Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement\n\nIn connection with the Business Combination, immediately prior to the closing thereof, FoA Equity adopted an Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement (the A&R LLC Agreement). In connection with the adoption of the A&R LLC Agreement, all equity interests of FoA Equity as of immediately prior to the closing of the Business Combination were reclassified into a single class of unitized equity interests designated as FoA Units.\n\nPursuant to the A&R LLC Agreement, the Company has the sole right to appoint all of the managers of FoA Equity. The board of managers has the right to determine when distributions will be made to the members of FoA Equity and the amount of any such distributions. If the board of managers authorizes a distribution, such distribution will be made to the holders of FoA Units pro rata in accordance with the percentages of their respective FoA Units held. The A&R LLC Agreement provides for tax distributions to the holders of FoA Units if the board of managers determines that a holder, by reason of holding FoA Units, incurs an income tax liability. These tax distributions are computed based on the board of managers estimate of the net taxable income of FoA Equity multiplied by an assumed tax rate equal to the highest effective marginal combined United States federal, state and local income tax rate prescribed for an individual (or, if greater, a corporation) resident in California or New York, New York (whichever is higher), taking into account the deductibility of certain expenses and any limitations thereof and the character of FoA Equitys income.\n\nThe A&R LLC Agreement also provides that substantially all expenses incurred by or attributable to the Company, but not including obligations incurred under the Tax Receivable Agreements by the Company, income tax expenses of the Company and payments on indebtedness incurred by the Company, will be borne by FoA Equity.\n\n43\n\nSenior Notes\n\nOn November 5, 2020, Finance of America Funding LLC issued $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.875% senior unsecured notes due 2025. Certain of FoAs owners or their affiliated entities, including Blackstone and Brian L. Libman, FoAs founder and chairman, purchased notes in the offering in an aggregate principal amount of $85 million. Mr. Libman also purchased an additional $50 million of senior unsecured notes. Assuming each holder has maintained proportionate ownership in the senior unsecured notes, the Company would have paid $10.6 million in interest expense to the holders for the year ended December 31, 2022 and $10.6 million in interest expense to the holders for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nWorking Capital Promissory Notes\n\nIn June 2019, FOA Equity (through its predecessor UFG) entered into two Revolving Working Capital Promissory Notes (the Original Promissory Notes) with certain entities affiliated with Blackstone and Brian L. Libman, respectively (such entities, the Noteholders). The Original Promissory Notes were structured with simultaneous draw and paydown terms and provided for revolving borrowings in an aggregate amount of up to $35.0 million. In 2022 and 2023, the Original Promissory Notes were amended to provide for aggregate commitments for revolving borrowings of up to $60.0 million, a maturity date of November 30, 2024 and an interest rate per annum of 10% increasing to 15% per annum, effective May 15, 2024. Further, the Original Promissory Notes were secured by tangible assets of FoA Equity, excluding pledges of equity interests, and certain Pledged Risk Retention Securities (as defined below) held by MM Risk Retention LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of FoA Equity (MM Risk).\n\nOn January 30, 2024, the Original Promissory Notes were further amended (each such note as amended, an Amended Promissory Note) to provide for an aggregate amount of permitted borrowings of $85.0 million and a maturity date of May 25, 2025. In addition, the Amended Promissory Notes received the benefit of a new guarantee and security agreement and include certain restrictive covenants and mandatory prepayment events, in each case, as more particularly described below.\n\nIn connection with the Amended Promissory Notes, FoA Equity, the Guarantors (as defined below) and Blackstone, as administrative agent under the Amended Promissory Notes, entered into a new guarantee and security agreement for the benefit of the Noteholders to add the Guarantors as guarantors of the Amended Promissory Notes and pledge additional collateral to secure the obligations under the Amended Promissory Notes, as described herein. The Amended Promissory Notes are guaranteed by certain current and future wholly owned subsidiaries of FoA Equity, in each case, except for certain subsidiaries, including those subsidiaries which are not wholly owned subsidiaries, securitization subsidiaries, warehouse facility subsidiaries, foreign subsidiaries and other excluded subsidiaries. The guarantors under the Amended Promissory Notes as of the date of the Amendment include Finance of America Funding LLC (FoA Funding), the issuer of the Companys existing unsecured 7.875% senior notes due 2025 (the 2025 Notes), Finance of America Reverse LLC (FoA Reverse), Finance of America Mortgage LLC (FoA Mortgage), the other guarantors under the 2025 Notes (subject to certain exceptions) and MM Risk (collectively, the Guarantors).\n\nEach Amended Promissory Note is secured on a first-priority basis, subject to permitted liens, by substantially all of the unencumbered assets owned by FoA Equity and each of the Guarantors (except for FoA Reverse and FoA Mortgage) (collectively, the All Assets Collateral). The All Assets Collateral includes pledges of the equity interests of each Guarantor and the equity instruments required to be retained by MM Risk (presently and in the future) in connection with the issuance of proprietary reverse loan asset-backed securitizations (the Pledged Risk Retention Securities). Each Amended Promissory Note is also secured on a first-priority basis, subject to permitted liens, by pledges of the equity interests of the direct subsidiaries of FoA Reverse and FoA Mortgage, subject to certain exceptions (together with the All Assets Collateral, the Collateral). The Guarantors are also required to transfer any unrestricted cash in excess of $90 million that the Guarantors hold on an aggregate basis to an account that will be subject to a springing control agreement with Blackstone, as the administrative agent.\n\n44\n\nThe Amended Promissory Notes are required to be partially or fully repaid, and the commitments under such Amended Promissory Notes reduced by the same amount, in connection with the occurrence of the following specified events: (i) certain sales or financing of our reverse mortgage servicing rights, (ii) public or private sales or issuance of capital stock or preferred stock (with certain customary exceptions), (iii) any casualty event and certain asset disposition"
