A systematic interdisciplinary search for the bioactive principles of pine bark has yielded the trimeric PAC, ent-epicatechin-(4Î²â8)-epicatechin-(2Î²âOâ7,4Î²â8)-catechin (3), representing the hitherto most potent single chemical entity capable of enhancing dentin stiffness. Building the case from two congeneric PAC dimers, a detailed structural analysis decoded the stereochemistry, spatial arrangement, and chemical properties of three dentin biomodifiers.\n\nRead More... categories publications science\n\nPosters / Minimizing the problems with âPIMPsâ >\n\nA recent article by Baell(1) on the problems experienced by medicinal chemists with pan-assay interference compounds (PAINS) and Shoichet’s work(2) on the impact of aggregation occurring in high throughput screening libraries, prompts a consideration of how these and other similar problems are experienced by pharmacognosists with promiscuous invalid metabolites as panaceas (PIMPs). Contrary to the classical definition of secondary metabolites as being species specific (or near specific), several natural products, particularly in the more extensively investigated plant kingdom, are common across species, genera, and even families (e.\n\nRead More... category posters\n\nPosters / K-targeted isolation of C-glycosylflavones from Vitex agnus-castus by countercurrent methodology >\n\nC-glycosylated flavones, including orientin, isoorientin, vitexin, and isovitexin, are minor but biologically significant constituents of fruit extracts of the chaste-tree (Vitex agnus-castus L.), a botanical supplement used to treat PMS and postmenopausal symptoms. The partition coefficient, or K-value, is the ratio of the concentration of a compound in each phase of a biphasic solvent mixture and is a physicochemical property of a particular compound in a particular solvent system. This value can be used to predict retention volume (V ret) in a countercurrent separation procedure.\n\nRead More... category posters\n\nPosters / Dissemination of original NMR data enhances the reproducibility of natural product research >\n\nThe acquisition of 1D 1H NMR (HNMR) spectra is one of earliest steps in characterizing natural products and other organic molecules. For publication, HNMR information usually is âconvertedâ into a table format, and sometimes spectral plots are provided. However, this transformation is lossy and frequently insufficient for unambiguous dereplication. This ambiguity can even lead to structural revision, such as in the recent case of aquatolide (1), a sesquiterpene lactone from Asteriscus aquaticus.\n\nRead More... category posters\n\nPosters / Chemical nano shifts explain the NMR fingerprints of dentin-enhancing oligomeric proanthocyanidins >\n\n1D NMR spectra contain a wealth of vital structural information that can enhance the description of bioactive molecules.

This approach is established by analyzing 1D NMR spectra of oligomeric proanthocyanidins (OPACs), which exhibit high dentin bioactivity, and were isolated from the inner bark of pine.\n\nRead More... category posters\n\nThis article is in english, but the original one is in french.

The extent and nature of cross-linking is influenced by the composition and specific chemical structure of the bioactive compounds present in certain PAC-rich extracts. This study investigated the effect of the molecular weight and stereochemistry of polyphenol compounds on two important properties of dentin, biomechanics, and biostability. For that, purified phenols, a phenolic acid, and some of its derivatives were selected: PAC dimers (A1, A2, B1, and B2) and a trimer (C1), gallic acid (Ga), its esters methyl-gallate (MGa) and propyl-gallate (PGa), and a pentagalloyl ester of glucose (PGG).\n\nRead More... categories publications science\n\nauthors Ariene A.

With an ever-growing rhythm, a multitude of biological activities of naturally occurring stilbenes are being reported. In this work, we investigated minor stilbenoid compounds from Vitis vinifera stalks. The compounds were purified by means of centrifugal partition chromatography (CPC), a countercurrent-separation technique. Electrospray ionizationâion trap mass spectrometry (ESIâIT-MS) after optimization proved to be extremely efficient for the detection of these new molecules, providing both structural information for structure elucidation and a means to achieve identification even with minute amounts.\n\nRead More... categories publications science\n\nauthors Thierry Buffeteau , Dominique Cavagnat , Jonathan Bisson , Axel Marchal , Gilbert D.

Polyphenols were extracted from their canes and identified by liquid chromatographyânuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

These compounds were tested at 5 and 10âÂµM on BV-2 microglial cells stimulated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide.

However, our initial HPLCâMS analyses of crude wine samples demonstrated the presence of compounds with molecular weights matching characteristic stilbenoid dimers, trimers, and tetramers that were unaccounted for in the literature. Due to the likelihood that these are known compounds, a chemical dereplication method is highly desirable. We developed such a method using LC-DADâMS monitored fractionation steps, using adsorption and centrifugal partition chromatography (CPC), to obtain fractions rich in stilbenoids for analysis in stopped-flow LCâNMR.\n\nRead More... categories publications science\n\nauthors Davide Slaghenaufi , StÃ©phanie Marchand-Marion , Tristan Richard , Pierre Waffo-TÃ©guo , Jonathan Bisson , Jean-Pierre Monti , Jean-Michel MÃ©rillon , Gilles de Revel\n\njournal Food Chemistry (RoMEO status: Green)\n\nsubjects CPC Oak Wood Flavor Wine\n\nFlavours extracted from oak wood during barrel ageing contribute to the organoleptic character of wines and spirits.

Preparative centrifugal partition chromatography (CPC) is a promising solution for purifying the oak extract.

However, one of the major bottlenecks in liquid-liquid chromatography is the solvent system selection. In this work, a NMR-based analysis of complex solvent mixtures was developed for biphasic system selection and modification. This allowed us to develop more versatile separation conditions, such as gradients. Additionally, we hyphenated our countercurrent chromatography device with NMR and mass spectrometry.\n\nRead More... category conferences"
