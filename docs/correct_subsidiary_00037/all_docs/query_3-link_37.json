        "text": "The sudden demise of Pandesic last Friday could spell trouble for the latest buzzword-driven crop of companies: the ASP.\n\nPandesic, a joint venture between Andy Grove’s Intel and SAP, the German company that makes software that does much of the muscle work in heavy industry, announced Friday that it was “winding down” its operations.\n\nDespite having more than 100 customers, including Adidas, Express.com and Fila, the company said it could see no way to make a profit.\n\nASPs, or Application Service Providers, have been the hot new thing in the Internet space over the last three months.\n\nAn ASP firm typically offers to take care remotely of a company’s software needs, such as payroll or inventory. When the software breaks or needs upgrading, the customer does not have to worry For a rental fee or per-seat license, the client gets a professional service without having to buy computers or hire techies.\n\nMany companies that reveled in the dot-com moniker in 1999 changed to a B2B (Business-to-Business) focus in early 2000 when that sector became trendy – only to switch to calling themselves ASPs when a chill wind ran through the Nasdaq in April.\n\nWith the flap over Napster, the term P2P (Peer-to-Peer) has suddenly become hot. Napster users swap files “peer-to-peer” – between each other directly – without much of a middleman, but nobody’s figured out how to make money from P2P yet.\n\nThe ASP shakeout has hit suddenly, catching some by surprise. Just yesterday, a media alert went out from Yankelovich Partners saying they will be unveiling decisionDOMAIN in August, “the first Web-based ASP geared towards the needs of marketers.”\n\nDave Boulanger, e-bus-\n\niness analyst at AMR Research, agrees that the ASP space is getting very crowded: “There are about 300 companies calling themselves ASPs, but only about 15 have been in the business for any length of time, like Siemens, IBM Global and EDS.”\n\nHe said part of the rush for businesses to call themselves ASPs is to be seen in blue-chip company – and partly because the Internet changes so rapidly.\n\n“There are companies that thought they could survive by building and running Web sites for others, but after about six months of that, you realize there’s no money in it. You have to start trying to provide other services.”\n\nNonetheless, AMR estimates the market for real ASPs will boom in the near future, from half a billion dollars now to $12 billion by 2004\n\nKirk Krappe, senior vp of products and markets at recently IPO-ed Corio, said that Pandesic’s problem was they were trying to set up transactional Web sites for companies and take “3 to 6 percent of the top of all the revenues that came through. Six percent is OK in retail but not in corporations.”\n\nHe added that the new wave of small companies calling themselves ASPs was “ridiculous. It’s like anyone offering software over a network thinks they’re now an ASP.”\n\n“Pandesic was stuck in 1997. They got overtaken by the market,” said Boulanger. “All the smart players specialize in verticals, like aerospace, pharmaceuticals, e-fulfillment.\n\nThe supply of three-letter acronyms is not exhausted yet, however. Companies such as ClearCross of New York – which lets companies calculate shipping tariffs and legal bills associated with import-export activity and also lets them use its network of insurance companies, banks and freight carriers – have found that the ASP acronym has bad associations.\n\nThey’ve started calling themselves BSPs, Business Solution Providers. BSPs offer customers the chance to outsource practically everything.\n\n——\n\nDEATH OF A BUZZWORD\n\nWith word that Pandesic, the biggest and oldest Application Service Provider (ASP), is winding down, the Internet industry is losing yet another magic phrase for separating venture capitalists from their money.\n\nA short history:\n\nDot-com – Aimed to sell anything and everything over the Internet. Problem: They failed to make money.\n\nB2B – After the dot-com shakeout, all the e-tailers tried to become business-to-business exchanges. Problem: They failed to make money.\n\nASP – When B2Bs got killed a few months ago, ASPs became all the rage as firms tried to sell their expertise. Problem: They failed to make money.\n\nP2P – The newest fad, peer-to-peer networks like Gnutella link individual users with no central site. Problem: No one knows how they’ll make money."
