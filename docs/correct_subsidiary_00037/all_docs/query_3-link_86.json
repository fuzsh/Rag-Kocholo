        "text": "IMPLEMENTATION OF ASP (APPLICATION SERVICES PROVISION)\n\nBeyond the old computer application share application become a new way of communication in information technology. ASP (Application Service Provision) has a concept of since it first come in 1990's.\n\nActually like the idea came from Bill Davidow. He saw that,\n\n\"Hi-tech development and changes at a fast rate are moving towards convergence of the software, information, technology carriers and computer engineering. As a result the information technology shifting from desktop and mainframe environment towards internet based structure\"\n\n(DAWN NEWSPAPER)\n\nIt is some times called a software-as-a service, on demand computing, apps-on-tap or utility computing. ASP is different then the \"Active Server Page\" so don't mixed with it. It is a \"Active Service Provision\"\n\nSometimes the ASP deployed by the member like host, managers, updates, software based services and solutions and distributed to clients from central location XML and HTML process allow the clients to interact with the software.\n\nAsp also rent out the network and the server hardware. The first wave of ASP's were mostly application outsourcers, and many continue to fine success today companies like USI, Corio, Appshop , eOnline (now Blue star solutions), Sure bridge, Tele Computing have carved out their niche and are still relevant in today's asp landscape. Many traditional software vendors have dipped their toes into the asp pool to varying degrees. Companies like oracle, people soft, sap and Siebel have all tested the waters, and found varying success. Siebel's recent acquisition of Upshot and a renewed focus on an asp strategy by oracle and PeopleSoft show that the old-timers are taking notice.\n\nNow the enterpriser started the side solution in which software and the relevant hardware are functions remain on customer's side.\n\nASP services can be grouped in different portions. According to the words of DATA corps, they are commercial enterprise application (customer relation management, enterprise resource planning, e-commerce, data ware housing and programs to support industries and other things), collaborative applications (programs that enables internal operations such as email, groupware document creation management messaging) and for personal use like games, home office applications and other software like that.\n\nBRANCHES:\n\nNow a days ASP plays a great role like some large firm's such as IBM are using ASP methodology as a specific business model that supports specialized clientele. According www.aspnews.com. ASP's are divided into five categories.\n\n? Enterprises ASP's:\n\nThese ASP's high are business applications.\n\n? Local and Regional ASP's:\n\nThese types of ASP's provide wide variety of application services.\n\n? Specialized ASP's:\n\nProvide applications for a specific need such as web side services and human resources.\n\n? Vertical Market ASP's:\n\nThese types of ASP's provide supports to a specific industry.\n\n? Volume Business ASP's:\n\nSupply general small and medium-sized businesses with pre-packaged application services in volume\n\nASP's model is one of the economical behind the scenes methodology and it's working very successfully in more connected world.\n\nMany experts and industrialist see that ASP's becoming a big business and Asp's concept is ideal for the countries like PAKISTAN.\n\nASP'S IN PAKISTAN:\n\nThe concept of ASP's is still new in PAKISTAN. Despite all whirl we are going through corporate PAKISTAN have not yet embraced IT, exceptions a side, so no effect can be seen in ground but there is still hope in development of ASP in PAKISTAN IT industry.\n\nWhat has been achieved by PAKISTAN IT industry and some futuristic concern so far not more than the scratch on ground? There are many resources for this\n\nI. Resistance to change and lack of trust in technical.\n\nII. Web has not been made use of due to lack of standard business cultural of strategic planning and thinking.\n\nIII. Another big impediment in PAKISTAN is social rather than technology.\n\n\"The generations at the helms of business affairs, mostly family sun, thinking for them in the past is good enough. They hesitate to take new incentives into the untested area. The strength of this social impulse reins back the widespread IT employment in any area\"\n\nDR EHSAN MALIK (International Market Expert)\n\nThere are the big disadvantages of the ASP's are poor employment and lack of necessary infrastructure, slow speed, non-availability of internet access and things like electric shut down at the time in which data is transferred.\n\n\"At present there is no scope of ASP in PAKISTAN\"\n\nABBAS MALIK (IT professional from a reputable software house)\n\nReliable internet connectivity is still a big issue here because here a person does not want to close their shops only because of internet.\n\nIn the third world countries the business still are not mature due to this, the IT services or internet services are very cheap than the developed countries if ASP's provide a services on a affordable rate then this scenario might be change in PAKISTAN.\n\n\"When ASP's comes in operation and result are noticed, people will stat buying ASP solutions for automatically manufacturing and marketing processes, instead of costly software solution businesses have to realize that it is like any thing else they do on a subscription basis. Major things any potential ASP need is to build confidence and develop trust\"\n\nMANSOOR A SHEIKH (call centre developer)\n\nIn addition, if the company is successful in transitioning to an on-demand model, it will do so at the expense of its installed software base. Companies like Seibel have been making efforts to enter the market, amid ten consecutive quarters of declining revenue.\n\nThe difference between the traditional software model and on-demand model are much more than just a change in the delivery mechanism. But the same difference that make it difficult for the traditional vendors to make the transition make an ASP that has been built that way from the ground up highly desirable to the investing community.\n\nI still believe the on-demand model, is a disruptive innovative that will replace traditional enterprise software in 5 to 7 years. We continually see the barriers to corporations deploying mission critical applications on a hosted basis falling away.\n\n\"Like internet services provider (ISP's) we are so familiar with ASP have to make applications available with ASP have to make applications available to multiple users at a time, the more subscribers they will have the lower the lease rates will drop. Difficulty is that no one wants to see what's other do and how.\n\nThis is why we are far behind in making innovative use of the technology available\"\n\nQASAR MEHDI (Developer)\n\nISP's are more suited to transform themselves into ASP's.\n\nThe only things which the ASP's has to develop are;\n\nManagement applications enterprise resource planning applications, banking and credit card transaction, hospital management or simply e-mail management.\n\nNow days it cab be seen that the small businesses are most likely users of ASP's in PAKISTAN. Larger companies also get this opportunity by using ASP's and cut their budget which management on IT.\n\nBy default, when various ISP's were contacted for finding out about any possible future plans for the purpose of this article the answer which is come is not very encouraging .\n\n\"We have already missed so many opportunity (like business process out serving and back office operations) in IT sector. We should not miss this one stake holder should focus on measure to stay competitive. Necessary talent is there and many companies talent is there and many companies are doing a good job in individual capacity\"\n\nMANSOOR SHEIKH\n\nThe ASP's is more feasible then the ISP's but the problem is that most peoples and business man are afraid to hold new things in PAKISTAN. They think that if they started using Asp's there is a chance to leak out their personal data from ASP's center and there is also a chance of loss of data during transfer or electricity problem , and daily software problems. Instead of this Asp's is more affordable then ISP's so that's why good wishes are still with ASP's and one wishes to see it happen as soon as possible.\n\nIn the end of this discussion I want to say optimistically that very soon or couple of years everyone will understand the importance of ASP and hope they will understand even before the dare time to benefit greatly this new technology.\n\n\"Today's ISP's are ASP's tomorrow\"\n\nABBAS MALIK\n\nCompiled by;\n\nFahad Sattar\n\nBS (SE)-1\n\nKARACHI UNIVERSITY"
