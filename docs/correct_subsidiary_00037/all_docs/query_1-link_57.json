        "text": "On-Demand\" strategies are no flash in the pan. The buyouts are proving\n\nit. IBM's latest takeover of Bangalore-based Network Solutions (NetSol),\n\nmanaged services and software company that specializes in system integration for\n\nnetworks, caps a year of sustained application hunting. The management of the\n\ncompany has, down the year, supplied its huntsmen with a carte blanche to target\n\ncompanies with strong managements and sound application development might. Not\n\nto mention the possibility of raking up new customer wins in the mid-market\n\n(where legacy systems abound and expensive new server orders are harder to\n\nclinch) as a direct consequence of its buyouts.\n\nThis is not NetSol's first engagement with the status of being an\n\nacquisition target. Its consulting team was snapped up by Intel in 2000 to\n\nsupport the latter's partner base of systems integrators and solutions\n\nproviders in incorporating Intel architectures and networking technologies into\n\ndata centers.\n\nOver the last four years, IBM has been priming its on-demand strategy to\n\ninclude the growing wave of IP telephony networks. This intention was clearly\n\nintimated when IBM opened its Network Consulting, Integration and Deployment\n\nServices group in 2002 to help customers plan and migrate their current\n\nenterprise telephone systems to a single network using Internet Protocol (IP).\n\nAnd, IBM's IP networking partnerships have been notable for the depth of\n\ntheir market applications, and, ambitions. In February this year, Cisco and IBM\n\nunveiled joint offerings to safeguard enterprise networks against viruses, worms\n\nand hackers. And in July, they deepened a longstanding storage alliance. While,\n\nlast month, IBM capped its partnership history with Cisco by announcing that\n\nCisco's switch modules would be integrated with IBM's servers to improve the\n\nperformance of corporate data centers. But where it has really moved ahead with\n\nCisco is in coming up with a slew of development offerings for converged\n\nnetworks- where packet voice, data and video can stream over a single system.\n\nNetSol implementation capabilities fit the bill nicely in all the above niches.\n\nAnother angle is: Linux clusters would work mightily fine in handling all the\n\nVoIP work over these networks-a possibility IBM will find compelling in the\n\nmonths ahead as more VoIP customers emerge.\n\nThe Yankee Group says that 54% of enterprises worldwide are either testing or\n\nevaluating VoIP for their business. The opportunity for what IBM calls\n\n\"business performance transformation services\"-a combination of\n\nsoftware, consulting expertise and engineering assistance-is huge. IBM CEO,\n\nSam Palmisano, had said last year that such services represent a $500 bn market\n\nopportunity, over and above the $1.2 tn that companies worldwide spend on IT\n\nproducts and services each year. In 2004, IBM took in $3 bn in business\n\nperformance transformation services revenue-a 45% gain over its 2003 revenue.\n\nAs VoIP applications steadily gain use in businesses, especially those\n\ninstalling networking equipment for the first time or launching major upgrades,\n\nthe NetSol team's experience with customers in the Indian sub-continent will\n\ncome in use. The NetSol buyout will help IBM's IP telephony services group,\n\nwhich also offers network operation and management services, to become more\n\nintegrated with IBM Global Services and delegate a larger application portfolio\n\nand a wider range of clientele to the new, wholly owned, subsidiary.\n\nNetwork services, where IBM can build on NetSol's expertise, especially\n\nwith Cisco's products, would include security, performance, capacity and\n\nchange management, problem configuration and end-to-end application management\n\nover wireless/wireline networks, server and workstation platforms. IBM's\n\nOn-Demand strategy envisages building and hosting applications so that clients\n\ncan use what they need on a utility basis. But remember the strategy still\n\nattempts to leverage IBM's phenomenal clout in the Unix server market, while\n\nits DB2 and Websphere range of applications-which also work with open source\n\nplatforms-are crying out for fresh air. A wider penetration into the\n\nfragmented SMB services and manufacturing units would help both DB2 and\n\nWebsphere find much-needed markets and further push excellent applications like\n\nIBM's Lotus Domino communications suite-while a strong application\n\nmanagement services provider like NetSol will help pilot the IBM's buildup in\n\n\"business performance transformation services\".\n\nThe NetSol buyout is the latest, and by no means the last, buyout aimed at\n\nsharpening the \"utility\" angle of the On-Demand architecture. In\n\nJanuary this year, IBM had announced its acquisition of Corio, an ASP providing\n\nutility access for Oracle, SAP, Siebel and Ariba applications, to SMBs. It\n\nsimultaneously acquired SRD, which makes identity-resolution software.\n\nWidening its vertical expertise has been a key driver of Big Blue's\n\nacquisition binge. The returns from the Danish buyouts in the second half of\n\n2004 have been good, according to IBM. The acquisition of Danish IT services\n\nfirms Maersk Data and DMdata have increased IBM's ability to serve clients in\n\nthe transportation and logistics industry. Ditto for the consulting and IT\n\nservices deals with AP Moller and Danske Bank. It makes sense for IBM to\n\ncontinue concentrating its acquisition efforts on technologies that complement\n\nits current capabilities. It's busy days ahead for NetSol."
