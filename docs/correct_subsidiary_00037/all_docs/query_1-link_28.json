Klépierre S.A. (Klépierre) (Euronext Paris) and Corio N.V. (Corio) (Euronext Amsterdam) announce that they have reached conditional agreement to create the leading pure play retail property company in Europe. The transaction offers a unique value proposition to both Klépierre and Corio shareholders:  Scale-up effect, with gross asset value (“GAV”) in excess of EUR21 billion and a wider combined footprint of prime shopping destinations in key strategic regions of Europe;  Significant organic growth upside through active leasing strategy on a wider platform, acceleration of the portfolio refocus process and more than EUR3 billion development pipeline, with the support of Simon Property Group;  Best-in-class financial profile with combined market capitalization of more than EUR10 billion and LTV at c.40%;  A value creating transaction, immediately accretive, with expected run-rate synergies of c. EUR60 million; and  David Simon, Chairman of the Supervisory Board of Klépierre, will remain Chairman of the combined group. The Management and Supervisory Boards of both companies have unanimously recommended the terms of the contemplated transaction. Simon Property Group and BNP Paribas, Klépierre's largest shareholders, as well as APG, Corio’s largest shareholder, fully support the contemplated transaction. APG has agreed to irrevocably tender its 30.6% Corio shares to Klépierre. The transaction will be completed via a recommended public exchange offer to be made by Klépierre for 100% of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of Corio (the \"Offer\"). Under the terms of the offer, Corio shareholders will receive 1.14 Klépierre ordinary shares for each Corio ordinary share, valuing Corio at an enterprise value of EUR7.2 billion based on Klépierre’s share price as of 28 July 2014. Laurent Morel, Chairman of the Executive Board of Klépierre “The transaction we propose today will create the leading pan-European pure player retail property company, with an unrivalled footprint in Continental Europe, a consistent portfolio of leading shopping centers and a team of seasoned professionals with deep knowledge of regional retail markets. Leveraging the retail focus, complementary footprint and shared\n\n4. 4 | P a g e strategic vision of both groups, we will be better positioned to further implement and accelerate the reshaping of our portfolios and seize new development opportunities. We believe this is a unique opportunity to drive change in the retail landscape for the benefit of our clients and our customers, our employees and our shareholders.” Gerard Groener, Corio CEO “We are excited to be creating the leading pan-European pure player retail property company. Both companies firmly believe that all of our stakeholders will benefit from the proposed transaction. Size is becoming an increasingly decisive factor in the retail property market in order to create attractive shareholder returns over the long term and being able to compete for larger high-performing retail properties. The combined group is geographically complementary and will benefit from significant scale advantages, synergies and a solid financial position. I am confident it will play a leading role in further consolidating the global real estate investment industry.” ABOUT THE ACQUIRER CO.: KLÉPIERRE A leading shopping center property company in Europe, Klépierre combines development, rental, property and asset management skills. Its portfolio is valued at 14.0 billion euros on June 30, 2014 and essentially comprises large shopping centers in 13 countries of Continental Europe. Klépierre holds a controlling stake in Steen & Strøm (56.1%), Scandinavia’s number one shopping center owner and manager. Klépierre’s largest shareholders are Simon Property Group (28.9%), world leader in the shopping center industry, and BNP Paribas (21.3%). Klépierre is a French REIT (SIIC) listed on Euronext ParisTM and is included into the SBF 80, EPRA Euro Zone and GPR 250 indexes. Klépierre is also included in several ethical indexes – DJSI World and Europe, FTSE4Good, STOXX® Global ESG Leaders, Euronext Vigeo France 20 and Eurozone 120 – and is a member of both Ethibel Excellence and Ethibel Pioneer investment registers. Klépierre also ranked as a Green Star by GRESB (Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark). These distinctions mark the Group’s commitment to a voluntary sustainable development policy. Klépierre is a pure player in the continental European shopping center segment, with a property portfolio valued at 16 billion euros. The Group has created or redeveloped these\n\n5. 5 | P a g e assets itself, transforming them into pivotal retail leaders in the heart of their catchment area. In all, they attract a billion visitors each year. Relying on its workforce of 1 346 employees and their combined expertise in development, rental property management, and asset management, Klépierre has gradually positioned itself in those regions of Europe identified as the most dynamic and buoyant in France, in Belgium, in Scandinavia, and in Northern Italy, as well as in the major capitals of Europe. By actively rotating the assets in its portfolio, Klépierre has successfully bolstered its presence in these regions, developing shopping centres that are increasingly of premium quality, compliant with the most stringent environmental standards, and seamlessly integrated into the regions in which they are located. Places where people interact and experience life, Klépierre’s shopping centres appeal to innovative retail brands looking for singular locations. They attract customers who are looking for a retail mix that changes ahead of the times, and who are won over by the unique combination of the one-ofa- kind shopping experiences Klépierre invents for them and the attentive customer care it delivers to them. ABOUT THE TARGET CO.: CORIO NV Corio is a leading pan-European retail property company, specialising in the selection, development, redevelopment and management of shopping centres. Corio currently has operations in seven countries: Italy, the Netherlands, France, Germany, Spain, and Portugal and Turkey. The portfolio consists of 57 shopping centres, offering space to more than 5,000 retailers to operate their businesses and hosting around 400 million visitors across the portfolio. Corio's headquarters are in Utrecht, Netherlands. The strategy of Corio is to create Favourite Meeting Places, as the success of a shopping centre originates from the number of visitors we can attract: sustainable centres where people like to meet, spend time and shop; places they want to return to. The company’s shares are traded on Euronext NYSE in Amsterdam. Under Dutch law Corio is a closed-end fiscal investment institution (FBI). It has a SIIC status in France. As of March 2008, Corio has been included in the Dutch blue-chip index of 25 leading shares, the AEX, EPRA, GPR, STOXX Europe 600, EURO STOXX, FTSE4 Good, DJSI and World, ASPI index, Euronext Vigeo 120 and ECPI. Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP is Corio’s largest shareholder (last reported 30.6%).\n\n6. 6 | P a g e Corio had been a serial under-performer within the listed European real estate sector. Since the peak of the financial crisis in September 2008, Corio has significantly underperformed Klepierre and Unibail. Corio suffered from a combination of badly executed deals, high exposure to Southern Europe and a cap-ex backlog on its ageing portfolio. Corio conducted a strategic review in 2012. Following a detailed analysis of the portfolio it was split into two categories: · Favourite Meeting Places (FMPs): These are typically shopping centres located in town centres, with good transport infrastructure and are dominant in their local catchment. These are the centres that are best suited to current retailer trends and would be the focus of future capital expenditure; and · Traditional Retail Centres (TRCs): These focus on daily needs, are convenience based and are often smaller assets. The target was to significantly reduce this part of the portfolio within 3-4 years. Corio made good progress in disposing of the TRC portfolio, with 14 asset sales in the first few months of 2014. Significant write-downs were realised in the disposal process. In February this year Corio sold a portfolio of Dutch and French TRC assets for €213 mln, a startling 27% discount to the most recent independent valuation. While the discount reflected poor asset quality and a motivated seller, it raises many questions about the accuracy of the external valuations. Despite the losses crystallised on disposal the result was a much cleaner vehicle, with much greater appeal to potential acquirers. Dutch Government pension manager ABP, the largest shareholder with a 30% shareholding, had become increasingly unhappy about Corio’s under-performance and was keen to explore change. Unhappy shareholders always reduce the execution risk for the acquirer.\n\n7. 7 | P a g e INDUSTRY OUTLOOK: RETAIL ESTATE MARKET Trends in direct real estate markets remain positive, as low bond yields continue to attract investors to the relatively high yields offered for good quality real estate. The latest report from CBRE showed that European investment volumes were €84bn in H1 2014, 30% higher than the level in the same period last year. CBRE noted that there was a large increase in interest from US based investors and there was a significant broadening in the range of markets that they will consider. Recent company reports have shown that lower Eurozone inflation and a weak macroeconomic backdrop has contributed to a weakening in rental growth for some of the largest Continental European REITS, most notably in France. The chart below shows how like-for-like rental growth has been trending downwards for the large French REITs. Whilst operational performance has been weakening, share price performance has generally been strong. To date this is justified by a continued reduction in the cost of capital. However, earnings accretion from falling interest costs is beginning to peak out. An improving economic backdrop will be needed to drive share prices further from here. Below are some newsworthy items that caught the attention:  London home sellers cut asking prices by the most in more than six years in August, adding to signs that the property market in the U.K. capital is coming off the boil. London asking prices fell 5.9% from the previous month to an average £552,783, the\n\n8. 8 | P a g e biggest drop since December 2007, property website Rightmove said. Prices in London’s outskirts are expected to rise faster than in the capital’s central boroughs over the second half of 2014, according to Jones Lang LaSalle. JLL has forecast growth of 13 percent for homes outside central London but within the M25.  Average residential rents in Dublin city center rose 17% year on year to €1,345 in the second quarter, according to property rental website Daft.ie. Dublin rents have increased by 26% since 2011 and now stand only 9% below peak values in 2007.  Middle East government/fund entities now control nine of central London’s largest development sites equating to c.28,000 homes. The ruling family of Abu Dhabi – Al Nahyan – has become the second-biggest landowner and investor in Mayfair after the Grosvenor Estate.  Cathay Life, the Taiwanese insurance firm, has completed the acquisition of Woolgate Exchange in the City for £320 mln. The asset is 100% let and boasts Investec Asset Management, NASDAQ OMX, Sidley Austin and the University of Chicago as tenants. The building was acquired by TPG Capital in February 2013 for £260m, thereby showing a 23% increase in value in just over one year of ownership  There are no signs of a cooling in the London office market. 30 St Mary Axe, also known as 'the Gherkin', is now on the market. The building has a £650 mln asking price and has attracted interest from over 200 investors from 40 different countries  Spain issued a €1 bln 50 year bond with a 4% coupon  Exit clauses are being inserted into commercial property contracts in Scotland to allow buyers to scrap deals or renegotiate prices if voters opt for independence, according to leading advisers to the sector  Property Week reported that Orion Capital Partners exchanged contracts to acquire the East Kilbride Shopping Centre, near Glasgow, from the Royal Bank of Scotland and Delancey for £180 mln. The centre was acquired by Propinvest in 2007 for £405 mln. The centre has therefore fallen in value by 55% since 2007, showing how much value has been destroyed in the UK Retail sector, despite the recent recovery in property values TRANSACTION HIGHLIGHTS The transaction will lead to a unique investment platform in the pure play retail property business in Continental Europe, with the following features:\n\n9. 9 | P a g e  A significant scale-up of footprint in Continental Europe with leading positions in the main European markets. The combined property portfolio encompasses 182 shopping centers for a pro-forma gross asset value of more than EUR21 billion (total share including duties) and combined 2013 net rental income of more than EUR1.21 billion:  An enlarged joint platform of must-have, non-replicable shopping destinations that are in the best position to attract European customers with Klépierre and Corio each bringing complementary assets;  Focus on high demographic and income growth areas, in order to capitalize on the best consumption trends and create broader offer for top brands and retailers, consistent with Klépierre’s and Corio’s strategy; and  Best-in-class, fully dedicated local teams with deep knowledge of regional and global retail markets.  Presents an enhanced opportunity to capture significant embedded growth and rental income by:  Recent upgrading of Klépierre portfolio, supported by Simon Property Group, will enable to accelerate Corio achieving its strategic objectives;  Capitalizing on an enlarged pan-European platform to implement active retenanting and retail management strategy, boosting traffic and leading to higher rental growth;  Accelerating portfolio refocus on the best assets through selective disposals of non- core assets; and  Utilising Klépierre’s strong in-house development expertise and financial capacity to capitalize on a combined pipeline worth more than EUR3 billion of mainly tailor- made shopping centers extensions in the most desirable areas of Continental Europe.  A value creating transaction with further opportunities for growth and expected run- rate synergies of c. EUR60 million:  Accelerated rental growth through re-tenanting, additional leasing and specialty leasing;  Wide access to the financing market at lower cost of debt; and  Improved operations through sharing of best practices.  Best in class financial profile  Combined market capitalization of more than EUR10 billion and EUR5 billion free float will offer global investors a unique highly liquid investment vehicle wholly dedicated to retail property in continental Europe;\n\n10. 10 | P a g e  Strong credit profile with a combined LTV at c.40%.  Klépierre will launch a recommended public exchange offer for 100% of the share capital of Corio with an exchange ratio of 1.14 Klépierre’s ordinary share per Corio share implying a price of EUR41.4 per Corio share based on Klépierre’s closing price on 28 July 2014  The transaction has been unanimously recommended by Corio Management and Supervisory Boards and by Klépierre Executive and Supervisory Boards  Simon Property Group and BNP Paribas, Klépierre's largest shareholders as well as APG, Corio’s largest shareholder, fully support the contemplated transaction. APG has agreed to irrevocably tender its 30.6% Corio shares to Klépierre  It is intended to maintain the tax provisions for Klépierre and Corio with respect to the SIIC and FBI regimes in France and the Netherlands respectively  Settlement is expected in the 1st quarter of 2015 STRATEGIC RATIONALE 1. Significant scale-up of operating portfolio With the contemplated transaction, Klépierre and Corio will create the leading pan-European pure player retail property company. The combined group will operate 182 shopping destinations in 16 European countries, with a combined gross asset value of more than EUR21 billion. The combined portfolio will provide the ideal platform for further expansion of Klépierre’s know-how and positioning to retailers and brands, which in turn will support the objective of being recognized as the most effective shopping center platform across Europe. Through the contemplated transaction, Klépierre will develop strong bases in three new countries (the Netherlands, Germany and Turkey), and reinforce its positions in France, Italy and Iberia. Corio assets in these regions are mostly located in dynamic urban hubs with strong and sustainable demographic growth (Grenoble, Marseilles, Amsterdam, Istanbul), and above average purchasing power (Rome, Turin, Rotterdam, Utrecht, Madrid, Berlin).\n\n11. 11 | P a g e Over the last few years, Corio has executed a strategy of refocusing on leading shopping centres in their catchment areas, such that most of the acquired assets benefit from the same dynamics and competitive advantages as those of Klépierre. Source: Company website\n\n12. 12 | P a g e 2. Ideal portfolio for implementing value creation know-how within the group The 57 shopping destinations offer an ideal portfolio for fully capturing embedded growth and rental income potential of the assets. Klépierre will leverage the best available knowledge within the combined new group to implement its strategy. With respect to the core shopping centres, the combined group will implement retail asset management expertise comprised of active re-tenanting actions and innovative marketing approaches by leveraging Klépierre’s track record. In terms of re-tenanting, the combined group will apply a dynamic strategy that focuses on offering the best-performing retailers the most suitable retail format, promoting the cross-fertilization of best retailers in new territories and accelerating the re-tenanting of the less performing units. In terms of innovative marketing approaches, the combined group will identify the best operating practices and deploy them across the wider portfolio, accelerate digital connection with retailers and shoppers, and further roll out large-scale marketing events for leading brands across several shopping destinations. Further development of specialty leasing is also anticipated considering the high appeal of the new platform for the best brands. Since 2012, Klépierre has demonstrated its acute capital management through the sale of EUR3.6 billion of non-core assets. Corio has also made substantial progress over the last 18 months with its divestment plan. Post-closing, the combined group will continue asset recycling through periodic portfolio review. Specific disposal processes will be defined for non-core assets. Proceeds from these disposals will provide financial flexibility for investment in the shopping centres, standing or projected, which are core to the implementation of the strategy of the combined group. The combined group will have a development pipeline of more than EUR3 billion. Specific attention will be paid to committed projects in order to secure or enhance expected returns through a shared approach to leasing and cost management. All controlled and identified\n\n13. 13 | P a g e projects will be streamlined in order to optimize conception and execution. Lastly, the development potential of each site will be evaluated. Shopping centers with demonstrated potential will be reviewed in order to develop new extension plans. 3. Identified synergies of c. EUR60 million in run-rate, to be reached in 3 to 5 years The parties have identified synergies of c. EUR60 million in run-rate, to be reached in 3 to 5 years. Half of the synergies will be driven by the incremental rental income expected from the implementation of leasing, re-tenanting, innovative marketing and specialty leasing efforts. The other half will come not only from operational improvements and the sharing of best practices between Klépierre and Corio teams but also from the financial savings that will result from the gradual refinancing of Corio’s debt, which will benefit from the stronger credit profile of the combination. TRANSACTION STRUCTURE Klépierre S.A. (Klépierre) and Corio N.V. (Corio) have reached conditional agreement to effect a strategic combination of their businesses by executing a merger protocol dated 29 July 2014 (the \"Merger Protocol\"). It is intended that this combination will be achieved by means of a recommended public exchange offer to be made by Klépierre for all issued and outstanding ordinary shares of Corio (the \"Offer\"). Under the terms of the Offer, each Corio shareholder will receive 1.14 Klépierre ordinary shares (\"Klépierre share\") for each Corio ordinary share (\"Corio share\") that it holds (the \"Exchange Ratio\"). The Exchange Ratio implies a price of EUR41.4 per Corio share based on the Klépierre closing price of EUR36.4 on 28 July 2014, the last trading day prior to this announcement. The Exchange Ratio represents a 15.6% premium based on the closing price of EUR35.8 per Corio share on 28 July 2014, the last trading day prior to this announcement. Corio and Klépierre have agreed not to pay or declare any (interim) dividend or to make any distribution in kind until completion of the Offer. Assuming 100% of Corio shares are tendered, Simon Property Group, BNP Paribas and APG will respectively hold 18.5%, 13.7% and 13.6% of adjusted Klépierre shares after the Offer (on the basis of Corio and Klépierre outstanding number of shares excluding treasury shares). Klépierre shares are intended to be listed on both Euronext Paris and Euronext Amsterdam as of completion of the Offer.\n\n14. 14 | P a g e Klépierre and Corio may further integrate their businesses after completion of the Offer by means of a cross-border merger with Klépierre as the surviving entity and Corio as the disappearing entity (the \"Merger\" and together with the Offer, the \"Transaction\"). Unanimously recommended by Corio's Management & Supervisory Boards After careful consideration, the Supervisory Board and Management Board of Corio believe the Transaction to be in the best interests of Corio and its stakeholders, including its shareholders, and unanimously recommend the Offer for acceptance and the Merger for approval to the Corio shareholders. In this respect, Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch and Goldman Sachs International have issued a fairness opinion to the Supervisory Board and Management Board of Corio, each to the effect that the Exchange Ratio of 1.14 Klépierre shares for each Corio share is fair to the Corio shareholders from a financial point of view. An extraordinary general meeting of shareholders of Corio, discussing the Offer and resolving on the implementation of the Merger and related governance matters (the \"Corio Resolutions\"), is expected to take place in Q4 2014. The Supervisory Board and the Management Board of Corio shall propose and recommend the Corio Resolutions to the Corio shareholders. The Supervisory Board and the Management Board of Corio may revoke, modify, amend or qualify their recommendation in case of a Competing Offer (as defined below) or in case Klépierre's share price drops below EUR29.8 and a price that represents 20% underperformance compared to FTSE EPRA/NAREIT Developed Europe Index measured on closing of either the first trading day after the approval by the AFM of the offer memorandum or five trading days prior to the Corio EGM. Unanimously recommended by Klépierre's Executive & Supervisory Boards The Supervisory Board and the Executive Board of Klépierre unanimously support the Transaction. An extraordinary general meeting of shareholders of Klépierre, resolving on the issuance of new Klépierre shares to Corio shareholders, the implementation of the merger and governance matters related to the Transaction (the \"Klépierre Resolutions\"), is expected to take place in Q4 2014. The Supervisory Board and the Executive Board of Klépierre shall propose and recommend the Klépierre Resolutions to Klépierre’s shareholders. The Supervisory Board and the Executive Board of Klépierre may revoke, modify, amend or qualify their recommendation in case of a Competing Offer (as defined below).\n\n15. 15 | P a g e Irrevocable undertakings APG, Corio’s largest shareholder with a 30.6% interest, has entered into an irrevocable undertaking with Klepierre to tender its Corio shares under the terms of the Offer, to vote in favour of the Corio Resolutions and to support the Transaction in accordance with the terms of the irrevocable undertaking. Klépierre's largest shareholders, Simon Property Group, with a 29.4% interest in Klépierre, and BNP Paribas, with a 21.7% interest in Klépierre, have agreed to an irrevocable undertaking to support the Transaction and to vote in favour of the Klépierre Resolutions. In accordance with the applicable Dutch public offer rules, any information shared with APG, Simon Property Group and BNP Paribas about the Offer shall be included in the offer memorandum and Klépierre prospectus (if and when issued). Corporate governance After successful completion of the Offer, the Klépierre Supervisory Board will consist of ten members of which five will be independent within the meaning of the French AFEP-MEDEF Code. One new independent member of the Klépierre Supervisory Board will be identified by Corio, subject to Klépierre's consent. The other five members of the Klépierre Supervisory Board shall be identified by Simon Property Group (which shall identify three members, including the Chairman of the Klépierre Supervisory Board), BNP Paribas (which shall identify one member) and APG (which shall identify one member). In addition, after successful completion of the Offer, the Klépierre Executive Board will consist of four members, one of whom will be identified by Corio, subject to Klépierre's consent. After successful completion of the Offer, the Corio Supervisory Board will consist of five members including three new members to be identified by Klépierre initially and two current members of the Corio Supervisory Board qualifying as independent within the meaning of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, who will be identified by Corio before launch of the Offer (the \"Continuing Members\"). Non-financial covenants Klépierre and Corio have agreed to certain covenants in respect of the combined group's strategy, protection of minority shareholders, financing, corporate governance, employees and post-closing measures for a period of two years after completion of the Transaction. Klépierre will respect the existing employment rights and benefits of the Corio employees, including under any existing covenants with the Corio Works Council, employment\n\n16. 16 | P a g e agreements and pension plans. Following settlement, all positions with overlap between Klépierre and Corio will be selected based on fair allocation principles or any other business oriented objective principles, irrespective of nationality or current employer. The combined company will foster a culture of excellence, where qualified employees are offered attractive training and national and international career progression based on available opportunities. The companies envisage that the combined business of Corio and Klépierre remains properly financed to safeguard the continuity of the business and the execution of the strategy. Klépierre and Corio have agreed that the Continuing Members will have certain veto rights to safeguard these non-financial covenants. If as a result of the Merger Corio N.V. would cease to exist, Corio Nederland B.V. will install a Supervisory Board and the Continuing Members will be appointed to such Supervisory Board. FBI and SIIC status Following the completion of the Transaction, Klépierre intends continuing the application of the Dutch fiscal investment institution regime (fiscale beleggings instelling) (FBI) in respect of Corio and intends to maintain the status as French Société d’Investissement Immobilier Cotée (SIIC). Acquisition of 100% Klépierre’s willingness to pay the Exchange Ratio is predicated on the acquisition of 100% of Corio's ordinary shares. Klépierre and Corio anticipate that full integration of the Corio business will deliver substantial operational, commercial, organizational and financial benefits, which could not, or only partially, be achieved if Corio were to continue as a standalone entity with a minority shareholder base. The full integration of Klépierre and Corio may be effected by means of the Merger, following settlement of the Offer. Klépierre and Corio may prepare for the Merger simultaneously with the Offer (subject to completing appropriate information-consultation proceedings). If it is decided to prepare for the Merger, Klépierre and Corio will prepare a joint cross-border merger proposal which will be made publicly available.

OTHER DEALS IN THE INDUSTRY Unibail-Rodamco Experience In early 2007 Unibail announced a merger with Dutch operator Rodamco to create Europe’s largest REIT. The deal had a number of similarities with the Klepierre / Corio deal, including: · French shopping centre operator taking over a Dutch peer; · Creation of a €20bn pan-European portfolio; · Expected synergies of around €50m; · Synergies expected to be achieved over a 5 year period. Given the similarities of the portfolios and expected synergies it is instructive to study how the merged Unibail-Rodamco performed subsequent to the deal. The synergies in the Unibail deal were anticipated to be achieved mainly on the revenue side and were expected to be achieved over three broad categories: · Leasing synergies, through application of best practice and greater appeal to international retailers; · Speciality leasing synergies; · Increased purchasing power reducing operating expenditure.\n\n22. 22 | P a g e Unibail anticipated that these synergies would result in a material enhancement of the net rental income margin by 2012. As can be seen from the chart below, it is questionable whether these synergies actually materialised. Although caution is advisable when considering potential synergies, there is evidence that in the case of Unibail-Rodamco some qualitative synergies did materialise. Prior to the merger Unibail’s performance in terms of total shareholder return and rental growth had been highly correlated to Klepierre. However, form 2008 onwards, performance diverged for both rental growth and total shareholder return. This is arguably due to the implementation of best practices and a stronger negotiating position with tenants, or maybe it isn’t? The relative performance is shown below, with Unibail-Rodamco out-performing by a cumulative 50% in the five years following the merger.\n\n23. 23 | P a g e MARKET REACTION Klepierre SA (LI) sold almost all its Spanish shopping malls three months ago to focus on better spots in Europe. Now, company values are so attractive it’s willing to become Iberia’s second-largest mall landlord as part of its proposed purchase of Corio NA. Improving economies, pent-up demand and cheap funding costs propelled European real estate deals to their highest number in six years in the first quarter and the next three months topped that. Paris-based Klepierre’s 4.2 billion-euro ($5.6 billion) offer for Corio, announced Tuesday, would be the biggest transaction in Europe’s real estate industry in at least two-and- a-half years. “We are observing an enormous amount of appetite for real estate assets in Spain and other European countries,” said Ismael Clemente, chief executive officer of Madrid-based real estate investment trust Merlin Properties SA, which yesterday announced it bought the Marineda City mall in La Coruna, Spain, for 260 million euros. “Investors perceive that these markets have reached bottom.” Cash piles amassed by sovereign-wealth funds and private-equity firms for property in Europe are making formerly undesirable assets like Spanish malls look increasingly attractive. In the three months through June, 223 property deals totaling $30.8 billion were announced in Europe that includes pending, completed and proposed transactions. That topped 222 deals in the first quarter, the most since the second quarter of 2008. European Targets More than half of the $11 billion raised for real estate investment worldwide in June is targeting Europe, according to research from Indirex Ltd., which compiles data on property funds that aren’t publicly traded. Sovereign-wealth funds are expected to spend about $7.5 billion on European property this year, little changed from last year, according to a May report by broker Savills Plc. That’s making buying companies look more attractive than purchasing individual properties. “It’s increasingly evident that real estate investment trusts cannot buy buildings at the cap rates they are valued at on their balance sheets, so M&A looks likely,” Jefferies Group LLC\n\n24. 24 | P a g e real estate analysts including Mike Prew wrote in a July 28 note to clients, citing Derwent London Plc’s July 22 sale of two London properties for 49 percent more than book value. “A way of assembling a high-quality property portfolio promptly is to buy a REIT and there’s a lot of hidden value in these companies,” Prew said by phone. “M&A is an increasing theme.” Attractive Bets The deal between Klepierre, Europe’s second-largest publicly traded-shopping mall operator, and Corio may make other acquisitions more attractive. “For companies such as Unibail- Rodamco SE, we believe that the U.K. seems like a good place to expand,” Valerie Guezi, a real estate analyst at Exane BNP Paribas wrote in a July 29 note. Targets may include Intu Properties Plc, the U.K.’s largest shopping-center owner, and London-based mall operator Hammerson Plc, according to Guezi. Buyers spent 1.1 billion euros on stores and malls in Spain in the first half of the year, according to data compiled by broker CBRE Group Inc. Purchases of Spanish malls may reach as much as 1.5 billion euros this year as buyers anticipate a recovery in consumer lending, said Gema de la Fuente, an analyst at real estate agent Savills in Madrid. That’s at least 10 times more than in 2012. Values Rising Real estate values across Europe are rising. U.K. commercial-property values last month surged the most since the market began to recover in May 2013, led by office buildings, Investment Property Databank Ltd. said. Land Securities Group Plc, the U.K.’s largest REIT, bought a 30 percent stake in the Bluewater Shopping Centre, one of the best malls in the U.K., from Lend Lease for 656 million pounds in June for a yield of 4.1 percent. “Euro zone real estate still offers a large premium” relative to corporate bond yields, Patrick Moonen, who helps oversee $241 billion as a senior strategist at ING Investment Management, wrote in a note today. “In the U.K. yield of real estate is actually lower than the yield on corporate bonds.” Investment in Italian real estate reached 1.8 billion euros and transaction volumes jumped almost 40 percent in the first half as investors such as Blackstone Group LP (BX), Orion Capital Managers LP, and the Qatar Investment Authority bought malls, warehouses and office buildings, according to broker Cushman & Wakefield Inc.\n\n25. 25 | P a g e Discount Trading Klepierre offered to pay an 8 percent premium to net asset value for Utrecht, Netherlands- based Corio a mall operator “that has continually traded at a discount” and “shown negative net asset value growth of 7.7 percent” compound annual growth rate over the last five years, JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts including Tim Leckie wrote in a note to clients. If that deal is completed, Klepierre will have 23 assets in Spain and Portugal valued at 1.3 billion euros, making it the second-biggest mall owner there, according to a July 29 presentation to shareholders. Still, Klepierre plans to sell non-essential assets if the deal to buy Corio is approved by shareholders, Laurent Morel, chief executive officer of Klepierre said July 29 without being more specific. Spanish developer Metrovacesa SA’s sale of its 27 percent stake in French developer Gecina SA for 1.55 billion euros to institutional investors including Blackstone had been the biggest real estate deal in Europe this year. It made June the biggest month for deals by dollar amount since January 2012. July was even bigger, with $14.8 billion worth of deals, led by Klepierre’s bid for Corio. ANALYSIS OF THE DEAL Klépierre and Corio have announced conditional agreement to create the leading pure-play retail property company in Europe. The first impression is that Klépierre is paying a full price (16.5x adj PE and 8% premium to EPRA NAV). However, the rationale of this deal is crystal clear as well: 1) Corio has cleaned up its portfolio over the past few years, which limits downside risk. 2) The Dutch retail landscape is improving (26% of Corio’s assets). 3) Klépierre can add value by transferring know-how and best practices. 4) Synergies are the icing on the cake, making this deal attractive for both parties. As such, we are positive on this transaction from both perspectives, and don't believe there will be a counter bid due to the full price being paid.  Klépierre is offering 1.14 Klépierre shares for 1 Corio share. This values Corio at €41.4, and equals a premium of 16% on yesterday close, and a premium of 18% to Corio’s 1H-14 EPRA NNNAV, and 8% premium to Corio’s 1H-14 EPRA NAV.\n\n26. 26 | P a g e  Klépierre is paying up in our view. 1) Klépierre is paying 16.5x for Corio’s 2014E EPS of 2.51 (JPMe FY) 2) Corio currently trades at a 20% premium to historical average on a P/E basis at 14.3x 2014e, while the implied price of €41.4 reflects a 16.5x P/E – a 38% premium to historical average. 3) Paying an 8% premium to NAV for a stock that has continually traded at a discount and has shown negative NAV growth of 7.7% CAGR over the last five years. 4) Taking EV of €7,277m and 2014 NRI of €345m we get to a net initial implied yield of 4.74% vs. the estimated Klépierre WACC of 6.18%. These four reasons seem to indicate that Klépierre is paying a strong price.  On the flip side, Corio sold the Spanish portfolio at a substantial discount to valuation, and a lot of the challenges that Corio faces are well known and reflected in the share price. So we think the downside is somewhat mitigated.  We therefore don’t think Klépierre will raise the bid, and likewise see it as unlikely that a third party would enter the fray.  We estimate a theoretical FV per share range of Klépierre before synergies of €32- 37, based on a blended P/E and P/NAV of 15.59x and 2.5% premium as indicated by pre-transaction share prices and forecasts. Should Klépierre realize synergies through cost reductions and higher rental growth, these pricing multiples could increase. However, both Klépierre and Corio traded at a 26% premium to their respective historical P/E ratios before the transaction, indicating already high expectations for future growth.  Long-term rationale crystal clear – but short term no bargain. Corio has been suffering for quite a few years, the shares have been underperforming and APG has supposedly been looking for a solution to this problem. On the other hand, the Dutch retail landscape (26% of Corio’s assets) has been improving over the past year, and Klépierre recently cleaned up its portfolio by selling the Carrefour assets. Also, the company has the backing and expertise of (29% shareholder) Simon Property Group.  In the long term we are very positive on this deal from both perspectives.  The deal is unanimously approved by Klépierre and Corio Executive and Supervisory Boards and fully supported by key shareholders. APG, owning 30.6% of Corio, has agreed to irrevocably tender its shares, and Klépierre’s main shareholders, SPG (29.4%) and BNP Paribas (21.7%), give full support.\n\n27. 27 | P a g e  There is a minimum acceptance level of 95% at Corio. This can be lowered to 80% if a cross border regime is approved by a 66.67% acceptance at Corio’s EGM.  Following the deal, Klépierre’s Supervisory Board will have 10 members, 3 of whom will be proposed by SPG, 1 by APG, 1 by BNP Paribas, and 5 independent members. Klépierre will have a 4-member (vs 3 earlier) Executive Board (1 designated by Corio).  The offer is expected to be launched in Q4 2014, and expected to be closed in the first quarter of 2015.  In case of termination of the Merger Protocol because of a material breachof the Merger protocol, the breaching party will forfeit a €36.1m termination fee to the non- breaching party.  Pro-forma numbers: GAV in excess of €21bn and shopping centres at €26.8bn. The combined company will have recurring earnings of €665m (based on 2013 figures), so the synergies amount to 9% of recurring earnings. LTV will remain at 40%. Combined the company has 16 countries covered, 182 shopping centres (Klépierre: 125, Corio: 57), a combined footfall of 1,150m, total GLA of 4.5m sq m.  €60m of projected synergies: Klépierre and Corio see synergies of €60m in run-rate (9%), to be reached in 3 to 5 years. 50% of synergies will be driven by rental income (marketing, releasing), and the other half from operational improvements by operational streamlining (we read lowering overhead costs), and improving the financial profile.  Both companies expect to leverage on best practices and know-how, among which are: *) accelerate cash flow growth, *) anticipate trends to accelerate re-tenanting, *) non-core asset disposals to fund pipeline.  Corio – 1H-14 preliminary results 6% drop in direct result. Corio preliminary results: Net rental income of €177m, (vs €197m in 1H-13) and direct result of €123m (€130.6m in 1H-13). Corio sees 2014 direct result at €227m-233m (2013: €261.2m). This guidance does include merger one-off costs (Bloomberg consensus €242m). Preliminary unaudited EPRA NAV and EPRA NNNAV are expected to come out at €38.2 and €34.9 per share. As per 1H-14, LTV and ICR will likely amount to c42% and 3.5x. Corio will report results on the 6th of August.  Based on Klépierre’s requirements of demographic growth and strong purchasing power, Klépierre didn’t want to quantify how much of the Corio portfolio would not\n\n28. 28 | P a g e meet Klépierre’s usual investment criteria, but did say the company does only sell to improve the average quality of the portfolio.
