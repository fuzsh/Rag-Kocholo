        "text": "Arthur Chiang - Senior VP Corporate Development and Investor Relations\n\nThank you operator.\n\nHello and thank you for joining us to discuss Corio's second quarter of fiscal 2003 financial results which is for the period ended June 30, 2003.\n\nIf you do not have a copy of today's press release, please feel free to go to the Corio website at www.corio.com where it is presently posted.\n\nI am here today with George Kadifa, President and CEO of Corio, and Brett White, CFO, both of whom will be addressing you shortly.\n\nGeorge will report our financial results and take you through our business from the last quarter.\n\nThen we'll discuss our financial results in more detail and provide financial guidance.\n\nGeorge will come back for some closing remarks, and then we'll open the call up for questions.\n\nFirst I'd like to preface this discussion with our Safe Harbor Statement.\n\nAll forward-looking statements made during the course of this conference call are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements.\n\nWe are including as part of this conference call, discussion of targets for the financial performance of Corio for the third quarter 2003 as well as the fiscal year 2003.\n\nAll of this discussion constitutes forward-looking statements regarding future events, or future financial performance of the company.\n\nThere are some uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements, which include, but are not limited to the risk factors noted in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the company's registration statement on Form S1, its Prospectus, its quarterly reports on Form 10Q, and annual reports on Form 10K.\n\nThe company assumes no obligation to update the outlook information that we are providing today.\n\nAnd with that I'll turn the call over to George.\n\nGeorge Kadifa - President and CEO\n\nThank you Arthur, and welcome everyone.\n\nI would like to characterize the second quarter as one of very solid execution by the Corio team on a number of fronts.\n\nTo start with, I would like to mention first, our solid financial performance.\n\nWe have exceeded our revenue guidance.\n\nWe provided you last quarter with the guidance of $15.5m to $16.5m in revenues.\n\nWe actually reached $17.1m in revenues for Q2.\n\nWe have also exceeded our cost reduction guidance.\n\nAs you recall last quarter, we guided you for an additional $1m of cost savings from our Q1 numbers.\n\nActually, we were able to reduce our operating expenses by $1.7m versus $1m goal.\n\nAnd we did that while we actually increased headcount.\n\nWe invested in Corio India, and we kept our investment levels from a research and development perspective.\n\nAnd we also have accomplished a positive EBITDA for the second quarter in a row.\n\nSo, here we are for the second quarter producing positive EBITDA.\n\nAnd the last piece from the financial performance perspective is we have exceeded our cash performance guidance, and we reached a third quarter of positive operating cash flow.\n\nIn addition to the solid financial performance we are showing that our business is scaling, and is scaling quite nicely.\n\nOne is, we have more than 150,000 subscribed users on our platform.\n\nWe are actually, across all of our product lines, are able today to scale across the customer base; and we believe that we can even scale higher in that regard.\n\nAt the same time we're applying [inaudible] automation technologies and we've been able to increase the quality of our service while simultaneously reducing the expense to deliver such service.\n\nAnd the third piece, we're doing all these components while at the same time expanding our operations offshore and maintaining a very significant R&D budget investment through it.\n\nWith that I would like to turn the call over to Brett to provide us with the detailed financials; and then I'll come back to you, and I'll make comments on the market and the competition.\n\nBrett?\n\nBrett White - CFO\n\nThanks George.\n\nGood afternoon everyone.\n\nAs you can probably tell we're very excited to share with you our financial results, and accomplishments for the second quarter, as well as our outlook for the third quarter.\n\nThe second quarter was really terrific.\n\nRevenue was $17.1m in total, which is a 43% increase from last year.\n\nApplications management revenue was $14.8m and 87% of total revenue.\n\nThis represents a 65% increase from last year, and includes $500,000 of non-recurring settlement fees, which is the same as last quarter.\n\nOn the expense front, total cost of revenue expenses, which includes application management services and professional services, were $13.6m, which was a decrease of $1.6m or 12% from the prior quarter.\n\nThis decrease includes the realized benefits from negotiated vendor contracts, and the implementation of the initial phases of our offshore strategy.\n\nGross margin for the second quarter was 20%.\n\nThe cost of application management services revenue in the second quarter was $11.9m, which was a decrease of $1.3m or 10% from the prior quarter.\n\nApplications management services had a gross margin of 20%.\n\nThe cost of professional services was $1.7m in the second quarter.\n\nThis was a decrease of $300,000 or 15% from the prior quarter.\n\nProfessional services had a gross margin of 23%, which is a healthy improvement off of a 15% gross margin last quarter.\n\nIndirect operating expense which includes R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A all net of amortization, in total were $5.5m for the second quarter, which is a decrease of 7% from the prior quarter.\n\nResearch and development expense was $1.35m in the second quarter and that was flat compared to Q1.\n\nWe had a net addition of 8 headcount in R&D in the quarter.\n\nSales and marketing costs net of amortization were $2m in the second quarter compared to $2.1m in the prior quarter.\n\nAs of June 30th, we had 10 quota carrying reps.\n\nG&A expense was $2.2m in the second quarter, a decrease of 8% from $2.4m in the prior quarter.\n\nOn the earnings front, our GAAP loss in Q2 narrowed to $3m, or .05 cents per diluted share which is a decrease of $4.8m or 62% from last year.\n\nEBITDA, which is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization in the second quarter, was a positive $800,000.\n\nOnto the balance sheet.\n\nWe finished the second quarter with $47.1m in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash and generated positive operating cash flow of $.1m.\n\nThis is the third quarter in a row of positive operating cash flow.\n\nOur DSO was 16 days.\n\nHard to believe an improvement from the 19 days last quarter.\n\nOur collections people are just doing an outstanding job here, and we're seeing a lot of success on collecting; and, therefore, cash flow.\n\nWe're continuing to target DSO in the 30-35 day, but I certainly am happy with where it is now.\n\nWe had 287 employees on board at the end of the second quarter which is a net increase of 5 employees from the prior quarter.\n\nOn to guidance.\n\nIn Q3 '03, we expect to show year-on-year revenue growth of approximately 10% or more.\n\nWe also expect to see continued improvement in our operating efficiency and further leverage from the expansion of Corio India, and expenses to decrease again in Q3 in addition to the impressive cost reductions already realized in Q1 and Q2.\n\nAs we discussed in our last couple of calls, there were customer contracts acquired from Quest in September '02 that we knew were in the process of transitioning out.\n\nWe have wrapped up the significant known transition customers in Q2, and we believe that Q3 will represent our revenue baseline going forward.\n\nThe expected impact of transition customers were reflected in the full year's revenue guidance that we gave in our January '03 conference call.\n\nOur guidance for Q3 - we believe revenue will be between $14.5 and $15.5m.\n\nWe expect total expenses to decrease approximately $1m from Q2 to Q3 which includes the expansion investment costs associated with Corio India that we expect to incur in Q3.\n\nWe expect about half of this $1m reduction to be amortization.\n\nWith that I'll return the call to George for his closing comments and Q&A.\n\nGeorge?\n\nGeorge Kadifa - President and CEO\n\nThanks Brett.\n\nTo conclude, I would like first to cover the demand side.\n\nI just want to let you know that this quarter is starting to look very good.\n\nWe had a very strong July month.\n\nWe haven't ended the month yet, but so far it's looking quite good.\n\nAnd our pipeline today looks-it's the strongest pipeline we've had since the dotcom era.\n\nOn the competitive side, we basically today do not see other ASPs or software vendors as competitors any more.\n\nOur win rate against these entities has been very, very high.\n\nOur current competition, we see it with large integrators, and typically with companies with 'three letter words.'\n\nFrom a partner perspective, we're starting to see traction with partners.\n\nAnd we had situations where partners have brought us deals.\n\nAnd finally I'm very pleased with the customer satisfaction performance we've achieved so far.\n\nAs you all know, we have quarterly customer satisfaction surveys.\n\nQ2 has indicated it's one of the highest, if not the highest customer satisfaction quarters we ever had.\n\nAnd frankly when you look at our DSOs which are 16 days today, it's a reflection of customer satisfaction.\n\nAs Brett keeps reminding me, happy customers pay on time.\n\nWith that, we're very pleased with Corio's performance in the second quarter.\n\nI would like to thank, to take the time right now to thank the contributions of our customers, our partners and also all the efforts of the Corio employees.\n\nWith that I would like to turn the call over to the operator for questions."
