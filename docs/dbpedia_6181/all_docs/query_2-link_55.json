        "text": "Cocoa Life is MondelÄz Internationalâs global cocoa sustainability program.\n\nAs one of the worldâs leading snacking companies, it is a major priority to make our most important ingredients, such as cocoa, right. Launched in 2012, Cocoa Life is a US$1 billion investment by MondelÄz International through to 2030 to help make cocoa sourcing more sustainable in key cocoa-producing countries.\n\nCocoa Life helps make cocoa right. It helps lift the people and protect the landscapes, with the aim of bringing dynamic change to communities and forests where the cocoa bean grows before it becomes the chocolate for the snacks the world loves.\n\nâWith our US$1 billion total investment between 2012 and 2030, we are in a unique position to apply 10 years of progress and learnings. Cocoa Life believes in smart innovation and collaboration for transformational impact. With our partners, we support farmers, communities and their landscapes through actions like Targeted Good Agricultural Practices, Payment for Environmental Services and Community Action Plans.\"\n\nCedric van Cutsem, Senior Director Cocoa Life, MondelÄz International\n\nBy 2025, we aim for 100% of cocoa volumes for MondelÄz International chocolate brands to be sourced, on a mass balance approach, through Cocoa Life1. We also have a goal to further increase our cocoa volume scale and reach around 300,000 farmers by 2030.\n\nâCocoa Life is on a long-term journey to help create a vibrant, strong cocoa supply chain while growing opportunities to help transform the livelihoods of farmers and their communities. We believe that empowered, thriving cocoa communities are the essential foundation for more sustainable cocoa.\"\n\nCathy Pieters, VP Sustainable Ingredients & Cocoa Life, MondelÄz International"
