As part of our 15-month Masters programme we ordinarily go on a fieldtrip somewhere as a group and explore interesting sites and situations in different cultural contexts. Due to ongoing Covid restrictions, this year we are compelled to change our patterns. In lieu of our in-situ fieldtrip, we plan to explore specific sites and situations virtually, led by amazing practitioners from around the world.\n\nConfirmed Speakers:\n\nEmeka Ogboh http://emekaogboh.art\n\nArchitecten Jan DeVylder Inge Vinck https://architectenjdviv.com\n\nForensic Architecture https://forensic-architecture.org\n\nJorge Otero-Pailos http://www.oteropailos.com/\n\nJennifer Walshe http://milker.org\n\nKatrina Palmer https://artreview.com/review-katrina-palmer-end-matter-2015/\n\nEstudio Teddy Cruz + Fonna Forman http://estudioteddycruz.com\n\nXiaoyi Chen https://chenxiaoyi.net/Home\n\nZhang Kechun http://zhangkechun.com\n\nJoseph Grima / Space Caviar http://www.spacecaviar.net\n\nOPEN ACCESS VIDEO RECORDINGS WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE AFTER THE SERIES ON:\n\nhttps://www.situated-practice.net/events\n\nSITES & SITUATIONS 1 / Emeka Ogboh\n\nTime: Apr 29, 2021 11:30 London\n\nEmeka Ogboh connects to places with his senses of hearing and taste.
