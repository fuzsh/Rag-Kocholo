The defendant will see the magistrate during the booking process. The booking process can take anywhere from 2 to 12 hours to be booked in the jail.\n\nIf charged with DUI, DWI or public Intoxication by state law you are mandatory to stay 6 hours before making bail. If charged with a domestic crime by state law you are held for 12 hours.\n\nOur practice at Carlos Bail Bonding is to keep checking on our clients every 15 to 20mins until they are booked, because we can make the bond as soon as the bail is set. That way when the hold is up the deft can be released.\n\nIf charged with a felony, you will remain in police custody until your scheduled bond hearing with a judge, which could take several days, depending on the seriousness of the charges.\n\nWhat are the most common bond charges for the most common criminal charges?\n\nCommon bond charges for misdemeanors and felonies vary by jurisdiction.
