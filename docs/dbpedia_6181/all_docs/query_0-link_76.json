        "text": "August Giveaway Days: Thursday 8/29/24 or Saturday 8/31/24\n\nHome of the Big Yellow Wheelbarrow\n\nJoseph's Storehouse is a faith-based food ministry that began in 1999 distributing food to only 22 families and has grown to provide assistance to an average of 800 families per month. We also provide assistance to other nonprofit agencies in the Middle Tennessee area. We distribute over $100,000 worth of food, toiletries and household items monthly. The food program targets the low-income, disabled, elderly, and single parents. While we offer one-time emergency food assistance at any time during the month, the primary assistance program is offered the last Saturday of each month and the preceding Thursday.* Please click our calendar link to see actual giveaway dates.\n\n*November & December food distributions are held the Thursday and Saturday before Thanksgiving and Christmas.\n\nDrive-thru Distribution Process:\n\nOn our regular distribution days (the last Saturday of each month and the Thursday prior*) food is distributed by a drive-thru process. Clients will remain in their vehicles and line up as directed. Our team members will go to each vehicle to register clients or help new applicants complete their paperwork. Our ministry team is available to offer prayer as desired or other support as needed.\n\n*November and December dates may vary due to Holidays."
