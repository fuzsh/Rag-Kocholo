Documentation states it should be in the .homeassistant configuration folder but there is no .homeassistant folder with Hass.io. I tried to dump it in the /config folder (/config/www) but no joy.\n\nAny advise?\n\nCheers\n\nIt was working all along I just didnt know it. I was going to https://my-ip:8123/local and expecting to see a directory of files, but got 403 forbidden instead. I finally just went to https://my-ip:8123/local/file.mp3 and it worked.\n\nI’ve found this place looking for answers. It was not working for me (manually created the www directory, but could not find the content by calling …/local/…\n\nTurns out that with hass.io a restart of the HA instance is necessary in order to see that data.\n\nI have not looked into the details, but it might be that upon starting, the core container copies the content of the configuration (and the www directory) into the container…\n\nI have followed all these instructions: created “www” folder in the config file, placed JPEG files in folder; I still cannot get the files to show up by calling …/local/… and cannot get the images to work with my device tracker image. Any help much appreciated.\n\nHow can I execute a py script from the local folder?\n\nSomething like:\n\nhttps://MY_HA_URL:8123/local/test.py\n\nThere is something like cgi that I can use to execute the test.py?\n\nThank you!\n\nJust to double triple clarify if anyone lands on this…\n\nFiles you put in your [config]/www folder are available at /local within the home assistant dashboard.\n\nExample: [config]/www/pictures/myphoto.jpg would be at the path /local/pictures/myphoto.jpg\n\nCould someone put the whole path here?\n\nI have a Home Assistant OS installed in a LXC in Proxmox and as far as I can tell the directory it is running in is:\n\n/root/.homeassistant/\n\nIn this directory there is no config/ directory but I created it and in here created the directory www/. In this directory I created a file: test.txt.\n\nIn the Home Assistant settings I rebooted Home Assistant.\n\nWhen going to http://my.ip.address:8123/local/test.txt it says 404: not found.\n\nSo for me it is not working… Any ideas?"
