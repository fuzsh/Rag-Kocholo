        "text": "We are property experts, helping create an education estate that provides world-class schools and colleges across England; both now and in the future.\n\n“We understand the scale of the challenge and the property landscape. LocatED has the expertise and will operate at pace to negotiate with multiple partners across the private and public sector to ensure the best value for money for the taxpayer and best outcomes for schools.”\n\nLara Newman, Chief Executive\n\nAs well as buying sites for free schools and colleges, we deliver complex and mixed-use developments, sell surplus sites at the best possible value, and diligently manage a portfolio of held assets to generate income and savings.\n\nWe apply our substantial commercial property expertise to support and advise the Department for Education on its long-term strategy for an efficient education estate. We also empower England’s schools and colleges to self-fund building improvements and release land for housing in areas of high need.\n\nLeading partnerships with the wider property profession, across the government and other agencies, we contribute to cross-departmental aims for the public estate: the levelling up agenda, the provision of housing, and green energy initiatives. And we leverage these relationships to drive better inclusion in the property sector, to improve pathways into the profession and progression for under-represented groups.\n\nSince 2017, we’ve created more than 100,500 new school places, helped future-proof the education estate, and saved millions of pounds for the public purse.\n\nFIND OUT MORE ABOUT LocatED\n\nLocatED Property Limited (LocatED) is a limited company that was incorporated under the Companies Act 2006 in September 2016 and whose sole shareholder is the Secretary of State for Education. It is a non-departmental public body (NDPB) that was established to acquire sites for the government’s Free Schools Programme, and has a framework agreement with the Department for Education.
