        "text": "First and foremost, we want to thank all of our customers for their continued loyalty and trust in our business to serve you and your heating and air needs. Without you, we wouldn’t be the company we are today. Thank you, Wilson County, for making Bentley’s Air in Lebanon your number one choice for 4 years in a row! We are so honored to continue to be voted number one and work hard to uphold that standard of always doing the best and being our best. Family-owned and operated, Bentley’s Air, started by Grady Bentley in 1945, then passed to Mackey Bentley before the business was turned over to his sons. In January 2015 the two men decided it was best to part ways and each run their own Bentley’s location as separate entities and separate companies. Bruce Bentley has operated, maintained, and grown Bentley’s Air LLC of Lebanon to the great company it is today. Our company is incredibly grateful for the continued support of our loyal customers after the business was split into two separate businesses. The office staff, technicians, and installers at our business here in Lebanon strive to provide the quality, trustworthy service you’ve always expected from our company and employees. We are proud to serve Wilson & the surrounding counties as we continue to branch out and grow as our own company, Bentley’s Air of Lebanon. During the uncertain times of 2020 including the tornado, COVID-19, and many other new hurdles to navigate, we have remained open to serve you and will continue to do so. We have technicians on call 24/7 to keep you comfortable in your homes &; businesses. Bentley’s Air continues to offer all of the following:\n\nHeating and air maintenance & service\n\nReplacement of existing units\n\nNew construction installations\n\nDuct work repair & replacement\n\nUV light installation & any other HVAC needs!\n\nAgain, we thank you for the support & appreciate all of your votes & business. Let us, Bentley’s Air of Lebanon show you that we continue to offer the quality service that our previous owners have always given. We may be our own independent company, but there’s no change in the standard & excellence of service we offer."
