        "text": "It appears that we inherit this policy from Debian. The closest discussion I can seem to find on this policy is from this discussion in 2003.\n\nHowever I did find a new draft policy (Check out section 3.1) that appears to have more detail which might help solve your question. It specifically mentions the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard. According to that /usr/share/doc includes \"Architecture-independent (shared) data.\", which includes web pages that user's can't modify.\n\nSince Mediawiki is user editable /var/lib/mediawiki would be the place for it to go since the FHS says that /var/lib is the place for \"State information. Persistent data modified by programs as they run, e.g., databases, packaging system metadata, etc. \" and the manual says:\n\nUser uploaded content\n\nA unique subdirectory of /var/lib/PACKAGE\n\nThe rest of the section in the manual explains architecture dependent things (like PHP and Perl).\n\nThis information is marked Draft however so I am not sure if it's enforced or pending in Debian. I would expect that if this were the final policy that we would likely inherit it from Debian.\n\nSo I guess the partial answer is \"The FHS says so and Debian follows it so we do.\" I (unfortunately) cannot find any information on the justification/reasons why the FHS is the way it is in this regard, maybe someone else will have better luck finding this information and adding an answer."
