It’s one of America’s 15 fastest-growing cities\n\nby Jeremy Tanner IMay 18, 2024 IThe Hill\n\nWith just a couple of exceptions, the fastest-growing cities in America are located in the South, according to new data from the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nBetween July 1, 2022 and July 1, 2023, the most recent data available, Texas cities dominated the list of the fastest-growing 15.\n\n\"The population growth across the South in 2023 was driven by significant numeric and percentage gains among its cities,\" said Crystal Delbé, a statistician in the Census Bureau’s Population Division. \"Thirteen of the 15 fastest-growing cities were in the South, with eight in Texas alone.\"\n\nCelina, located near Dallas, grew by more than a quarter – a whopping 53 times the national growth rate of 0.5%, according to the Census Bureau.\n\nOutside of southern communities, the only two to make the list of fastest-growing cities were Lathrop, California (13.6%) and Athens, Ohio (8.6%).\n\nWhen it comes to the largest total gains, San Antonio, Texas was first (21,970), followed by Fort Worth, Texas (21,365) and Charlotte, N.C. (15,607).\n\nPrior analyses by the National Association of Realtors found that people moving within the United States in 2022 tended to leave large states and metropolitan areas to save money amid soaring mortgage and inflation rates.\n\nPopulation growth in U.S. cities is also caused by international migration, with 1,138,989 foreign nationals moving to the United States, according to Census data.\n\nStates that received the greatest influx of new residents from abroad were Florida (178,432), California (150,983), Texas (128,982), New York (73,867) and Massachusetts (50,647).\n\nWhen it comes to domestic migration, these states lost the most people: California (-338,371), New York (-216,778), Illinois (-83,839), and New Jersey (-44,666).\n\nStates with the biggest domestic migration gains were Florida (194,438), Texas (186,767), North Carolina (97,264) and South Carolina (82,562).\n\nLebanon Among Nation's Fastest-Growing Cities\n\nBy Meg Wrather – Managing Editor IMay 23, 2024 I NashvilleBusinessJournal.com\n\nOne of the nation’s fastest-growing cities is located right here in Middle Tennessee.\n\nLebanon is the 12th fastest-growing city in the country, according to recently released population estimates from the Census Bureau.\n\nThe Wilson County city, about 30 miles east of Nashville, grew 8.9% from July 1, 2022, to July 1, 2023.\n\nThe city and county have been a target for both new residents and corporate expansions in recent years. Multiple companies, including Bridgetown Natural Foods LLC, Lochinvar LLC and REI have announced plans to open manufacturing or distribution facilities in the community.\n\nThe state has announced close to 20 economic development projects in the county since 2020, totaling 6,300 jobs and over a billion in investment.\n\nLebanon’s leadership is also working to attract restaurants and other amenities. The city recently recruited sit-down restaurant Aubrey’s under a $1.5 million economic development incentive.\n\nThe South tops the Census' list of regions with the fastest-growing cities of a population of at least 20,000.\n\nCities in the South grew by an average of 1%. Celina, Texas, was the fastest-growing city, with a 26.6% increase.\n\n\"The population growth across the South in 2023 was driven by significant numeric and percentage gains among its cities,\" said Crystal Delbé, a statistician in the Census Bureau’s Population Division, in a news release. \"Thirteen of the 15 fastest-growing cities were in the South, with eight in Texas alone.\"\n\nMetro Nashville gained more than 5,600 residents last year, making Music City the 21st largest city in the country. The city’s population increased 0.83%, to 687,788. Zooming out, Tennessee as a whole grew by 1.1%\n\nNew York City is the most populous city in the country, according to the Census Bureau, with 8.3 million residents.\n\nAgee & Johnson is pleased to announce the Real Estate Agent Pruitt Jones is now their Newest Auctioneer.\n\nPruitt Jones is a lifelong resident of Gladeville (or as many refer to this tight knit community ‘The Glade’).

Their values and lifestyle drive them toward buying condos because they tend to be more affordable than single-family homes and because condos typically come with a lower maintenance burden and are mostly located in urban cores.\n\nBased on the top 25 markets, the average sale price of condos in 2019 was 16% lower than the average sale price of single-family residences.\n\nTo support that point, CoreLogic Fraud Consortium Loan Application data shows that FTHBs gravitate toward condos. Last year, about 40% of all condo-purchase mortgage applications were submitted by FTHBs, compared to just 33% of all non-condo purchase mortgage applications by the same group. Additionally, the data shows condos were more popular with millennials – 47% of all condo-purchase mortgage applications were submitted by millennials in 2019, up 2% from 2018.\n\nGeographically, in 2019, the condo share of sales activity by state was highest in Hawaii (46%), followed by Washington D.C. (42%), Massachusetts (20%), Florida (18%) and Illinois (17%) (Figure 1). At the metro level, condo sales activity also varied. In 2019, eight of the top 25 condo markets experienced increases in condo sales relative to the prior year (Figure 2). However, in 2018, only 12 of those top 25 condo markets experienced increases in condo sales relative to the prior year.\n\nAmong the top 25 markets with the most condo sales, Austin, Texas, had the largest annual increase in condo sales in 2019, with a gain of 12%, followed by:\n\nNew York, N.Y. (6%)\n\nNaples, Fla. (3%)\n\nSan Diego, Calif. (3%)\n\nand Denver, Colo. (3%)\n\nMiami, Fla. and Warren, Mich. experienced the largest annual drop in condo sales, with a decline of 11%, followed by:\n\nAtlanta, Ga. (-9%)\n\nOrlando, Fla. (-9%)\n\nHonolulu, Hawaii (-9%)\n\nand Las Vegas, Nev. (-9%)\n\nGiven worsening affordability challenges in many markets, condos could be a viable option for many. However, condo supply remains tight; according to CoreLogic MLS data, months’ supply for condos fell to four months in December 2019 – the lowest since 2006.\n\nIn the coming years, younger millennials (age 30 or below) are likely to drive much of the condo demand as they are a very large group (Figure 3). Still, there will be more condo demand than supply as young millennials approach peak household formation and home buying age.\n\nData Source: CoreLogic TrueStandings\n\nThe 25 largest condo markets were defined at the Core Based Statistical Area (CBSA) level and determined based on total condominium sales between 2000 and 2019 according to CoreLogic.\n\nThe months’ supply indicates how long it would take to sell all the current for-sale inventory (assuming no new supply hits the market) at the current sales rate.\n\nJuly Home Sales Show Recovery Is Sticking\n\nAugust 21, 2020 | realtor.com\n\nExisting-home sales soared 24.7% in July, outpacing their record growth of 20.7% in June, when the nation’s economic reopening ignited home buying activity, the National Association of REALTORS® reported Friday. Now 8.7% higher year over year, the strong rise in existing-home sales—including single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums, and co-ops—is fueling optimism in the real estate market through the rest of the year.\n\n\"The housing market is well past the recovery phase and is now booming with higher home sales compared to the pre-pandemic days,\" says NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. \"With the sizable shift in remote work, current homeowners are looking for larger homes—and this will lead to a secondary level of demand, even into 2021.\"\n\nHome prices, too, are reaching new all-time highs, with the national median existing-home price hitting $304,100 in July—the first time it’s ever broken $300,000, according to NAR. However, low inventory stands to limit gains moving forward. Total housing inventory at the end of July totaled 1.5 million units, down 21.1% year over year. \"The number of new listings is increasing, but they are quickly taken out of the market from heavy buyer competition,\" Yun says. \"More homes need to be built.\"\n\nOther important findings from NAR’s July housing report include:\n\nProperties are selling fast. Sold homes in July typically spent 22 days on the market, down from 24 in June.\n\nFewer first-timers are in the market. The share of first-time buyers was 34%, down slightly from 35% in June.\n\nInvestors are holding steady. The share of all-cash sales was 16%, unchanged from June.\n\nDistressed sales are down. Foreclosures and short sales represented less than 1% of total sales, falling from 3% in June.\n\nCondo prices are increasing. The median existing condo price was $270,100 in July, an increase of 6.4% from a year ago.\n\n\"Luxury homes in the suburbs are attracting buyers after having lagged the broader market for the past couple of years,\" Yun says. \"Single-family homes are continuing to outperform condominium units, suggesting a preference shift for a larger home—including an extra room for a home office.\"\n\nRegional Breakdown\n\nJuly marked the second consecutive month that year-over-year sales and median home prices grew in each of the four major regions of the country, NAR reported.\n\nNortheast: Sales up 30.6%, median home price ($317,800) up 4%.\n\nMidwest: Sales up 27.5%, median home price ($244,500) up 8%.\n\nSouth: Sales up 19.4%, median home price ($268,500), up 9.9%.\n\nWest: Sales up 30.5%, median home price ($453,800) up 11.3%.\n\nSource:"
