        "text": "WTW is an acronym or abbreviation used in chats. It can be confusing because it has a few different meanings, depending on the context. I will discuss the two most commonly used meanings and then mention a few others.\n\nWhat the word?\n\nWTW often means 'What's the word?', which is almost like saying 'what's up?' It doesn't necessarily mean that you must reply with a word, but rather that they are just checking up on you and want to know how you are doing. In addition, if someone texts 'what the word' it often means that they want to hang out, or it can be used as a way to ask for more information to confirm plans.\n\nFor example, if someone sends a message: WTW tomorrow? it's a cool way of saying: What are you up to tomorrow? Do you want to hang out?\n\nIf someone sends a WTW message like this and you'd like get together, let them know that you're not too busy and would like to hang out. You can say something like: I'm watching the game at home. Would you like to come over?\n\nIf you're not sure that they have plans, you can let them know what you're doing and wait for more information. For example, you could respond with: Just hanging out at home.\n\nWhat the what!\n\nWTW can also mean 'What the what!' This is an expression of surprise, similar to saying 'What the heck!' If someone responds to a message you've sent with 'What the what!', they're probably shocked or surprised by something you told them.\n\nFor example:\n\nPerson 1: Did you hear that Alan was arrested?\n\nPerson 2: WTW! He would never do something like that!\n\nThere are two other definitions for WTW that are not as common.\n\nWalk the walk:\n\nThis means that you are authentic, what you say is what you do.\n\nWorth the wait:\n\nFor example, if you were waiting to see a new movie, and then respond that it was worth the wait.\n\nConclusion:\n\nTexting has many different acronyms and abbreviations, which often makes it difficult to understand the text even if you know the language. WTW, like some other abbreviations, can be especially tricky as it has different meanings in different contexts. To summarize, the most common meanings are 'What's the word?' in asking how you're doing and implying that they want to hang out, and 'What the what!' which is an expression of surprise.\n\nORIGIN\n\nThe abbreviation “wtw” originates from text messaging. From around 2005. The phrase “what’s the word?” comes from street slang in the African-American community. The saying goes back as far as the 40s as a way to ask someone what’s going on.\n\n'WTW\" is a textspeak acronym used to ask \"whats the word\", meaning whats up?\n\nWTW formal / informal\n\nIt cam be used in both formal and informal situations.\n\nIt’s a way to ask someone how they are doing or ask them for information when you arrive at a situation and need someone to fill you in on the events you missed.\n\nExample.\n\nformal - Gentlemen, WTW with the merger have anyone gotten across with the lawyers?\n\ninformal - “wtw, bruh. It’s been a minute since I saw u.\n\n“What’s the word?” is a common street slang greeting between friends. You can use it in real conversations in varying degrees of tone to describe the meaning of the expression. For example, using the saying with a curious tone means you want to know what’s going on with the person or the situation."
