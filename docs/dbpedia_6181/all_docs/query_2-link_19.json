        "text": "Depending on the configuration of the server or the system, you can use the folder where the files of your web application are copied (.html, .php, etc.). This folder have different names, but basically it is a folder with \"permits public access\".\n\nThe folder can be called this on Linux systems:\n\nhtdocs\n\npublic_html\n\nwww\n\nIn OS X (Apple), this folder is called \"Sites\", and in Windows Server it is called \"WWWroot\".\n\nIt really all depends on the server configuration. Sometimes hosts will configure www to be document root, sometimes htdocs will be for other applications (this is just an example).\n\nEither way, both are public and there is no difference as far as standard configuration goes.\n\nLike I said though, it really depends on the server configuration.\n\nAll of your configured settings can be found in httpd.conf\n\nApache will use whatever folder it's configured to use: you could call it whatever you want. Common conventions include htdocs, httpdocs, and www, but you could also make up your own if you felt like it.\n\nBased on your server configuration, it depends.\n\nThose are the default folders that are assigned to upload web related files into server.\n\nIf you want to set another folder for that purpose, follow below steps.\n\nFind and open httpd.conf file inside the xampp/apache/conf folder. (in xampp)\n\nThen change ( DocumentRoot “C:/xampp/htdocs” ) into what you want.\n\nAlso, next line ( <Directory \"C:/xampp/htdocs\"> )\n\nNow, you can use your own folder to upload files into server.\n\nThank You.\n\nApache will use whatever folder it's configured to use: you could call it whatever you want.\n\nCommon conventions include htdocs, httpdocs, and www, but you could also make up your own if you felt like it by yourself."
