        "text": "🌍 I'm excited to share that alongside my brilliant colleague Julie Noble I’ve officially become a Certified #CarbonLiteracy Trainer! 🎉 What I’ve learned as a property professional delivering Carbon Literacy training: 🔑 Making it local boosts engagement: Tailoring the content to real-life, relatable situations—like the challenges faced on the London Underground due to the heatwave—made a big difference. Learners could see how climate change impacts their everyday lives, which really helped drive home the need to take action. 💡 Learning from each other: Encouraging open discussions between people at all levels—whether they were students on work experience or senior execs—made a huge impact. It showed how we can work together and share ideas to find practical solutions to climate challenges. 👥 Teamwork creates a ripple effect: Carbon literacy goes beyond just individual actions. By sparking group discussions about larger-scale solutions—like decarbonising the education estate - we could see how the training could influence wider change beyond our own immediate sphere. The results so far: 🚀 People felt much more confident in making their own carbon reduction pledges, when they were empowered to set specific, measurable goals ⚒ We’ve seen the beginnings of group projects focused on innovative areas like sustainable procurement and energy-efficient building practices 📒 Communication about the science of climate change and the development of our own pledges has helped spark broader commitments and actions for meaningful change at all levels 🌱 #Sustainability #NetZero #CarbonLiteracy #ClimateAction The Carbon Literacy Project"
