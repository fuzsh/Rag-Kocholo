They denounced it as a calculated conspiracy to alter the territory’s demographic makeup and strip its people of their resources, jobs, identity, and right to self-determination.\n\nThe leaders criticized the Indian government’s settler-colonial policies and anti-Kashmiri laws, calling on the international community to take effective action against India’s actions in occupied Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nThe Hurriyat leaders also condemned the recent killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh by Israel, describing it as an act of state terrorism. They extended their condolences to the family of Shaheed Ismail Haniyeh and the people of Palestine, expressing solidarity with the Palestinian struggle for freedom and self-determination."
