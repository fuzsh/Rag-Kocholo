        "text": "One of the most important things you can do is protect your home and family in case of an emergency. SimpliSafe Home Security offers comprehensive protection against break-ins, fires, floods and more. And their industry-leading 24/7 professional monitoring is just a buck a day—less than half the cost of traditional home security.\n\nSimpliSafe is professionally monitored and will send police, fire, or medical professionals when danger is detected. SimpliSafe alarms are easy to purchase directly online and easy to install yourself. Plus, there are no contracts and no hidden fees—because who wants those? Not Ramsey fans, for sure.\n\nVisit SimpliSafeDirect.com and get 20% off your entire new system and first month of monitoring FREE when you enroll in Interactive Monitoring.\n\nThousands of families all over the country are discovering an affordable, biblically based way of meeting healthcare costs: Christian Healthcare Ministries. CHM isn’t health insurance; they’re a health cost-sharing ministry that gives members the freedom to choose the doctors and providers they want for approved treatments—without all the frustration of worrying about networks.\n\nCHM has helped members satisfy nearly $10 billion in healthcare costs. You can join CHM at any time, so no waiting around for open enrollment. Find out more about the only health cost-sharing option Ramsey endorses today.\n\nSometimes the highest thing about higher education is the price. Seriously, student loans are out of control. When your private student loans are past due and you’re struggling to make any payments, it might feel like you can’t breathe. But don’t believe the myth that you can’t do anything about it.\n\nThere’s a way out: Refinance your private student loans with Yrefy. Yrefy doesn’t judge. They refinance defaulted private student loans other places won’t touch, and give you a custom, fixed-rate loan built for you, based on your ability to pay.\n\nYrefy is not licensed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation. Yrefy is not authorized by the New York State Department of Financial Services to service any New York loans. Funding may not be available in all states.\n\nHealth insurance can be confusing. Deductibles? HSAs? Part D? Who can help you understand all that stuff and make sure you don’t get gypped?\n\nHealth Trust Financial, that’s who. Health Trust Financial is the ONLY company Ramsey recommends to find you the best health insurance. They don’t work for the insurance companies—they work for you! While other companies are just after premiums, Health Trust Financial cares about taking the time to educate you, saving you money, and shopping different providers to find you the RIGHT health insurance.\n\nBusiness is gaining momentum—but sometimes it seems like the wheels are about to come off. Communication breaks down because different systems have different “sources of truth” for key performance indicators. If that sounds like your business, you should upgrade to NetSuite by Oracle.\n\nNetSuite is the top cloud financial system for streamlining accounting, financial management, inventory, HR and more. For 25 years, they’ve been helping businesses manage risk, get reliable forecasts and improve margins. NetSuite is everything you need for better decisions, all in one place.\n\nBuying a home is the biggest investment most of us will ever make. You want your home to feel like a blessing—not a burden. That's why we tell people to contact Churchill Mortgage.\n\nDespite what you may have heard, getting a mortgage is not a button push—it’s a process. Whether you’re buying your first home, an investment property, or you’re looking to refinance, it takes a relationship with an expert you can trust to help you do things the Ramsey Way. Churchill Mortgage is RamseyTrusted because they know your house can be a forever home, but your mortgage shouldn’t be forever. Their mission is to help you achieve your dream of owning your home free and clear.\n\nFree Instant Term Life Insurance Quote\n\nIdentity Theft Protection\n\nFree Instant Disability Quote\n\nEvery smart financial game plan should include term life insurance, ID theft protection and long-term disability coverage.

A will is a great way to protect your family’s financial future and make sure your wishes are carried out to the letter when you die. If you don’t make a will, some random probate judge will decide who gets what. That’s not cool.\n\nYou also need medical and financial power of attorney documents, which name the people who can make decisions on your behalf when you need them to. Mama Bear Legal Forms makes it easy to get these legally binding documents online—and it takes just 20 minutes. Plus they’re specific to the state you live in. In the time it takes to drink a cup of coffee, unless you drink coffee really slowly, you'll have peace of mind knowing your family is taken care of.
