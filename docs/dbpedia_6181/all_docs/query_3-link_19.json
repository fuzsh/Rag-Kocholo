        "text": "What is a WiFi Mesh System?\n\nA WiFi Mesh System is designed to complement your internet’s existing router, to deliver strong WiFi signal in areas within your home that the said router cannot reach.\n\nThe WiFi Mesh system ensures that strong WiFi is delivered to rooms or areas where WiFi Mesh units are strategically placed.\n\nCheck out this page for more info.\n\nHow will I know if I need a WiFi Mesh system at home?\n\nA home with any of the following characteristics is a good candidate for a WiFi Mesh system:\n\nAt least 700 sq. ft. in size\n\nHas multiple rooms with thick walls\n\nSpans multiple floors\n\nGet more details here.\n\nWhat are the benefits of a WiFi Mesh system?\n\nIn addition to eliminating WiFi dead spots and ensuring that strong WiFi is available throughout the home, WiFi Mesh systems have other notable benefits!\n\nEasy Setup and Network Management\n\nStreamlined Connections\n\nAdvanced Features\n\nTight Security\n\nGet more details on these features here.\n\nWhat is the difference between a WiFi Mesh and a WiFi Extender?\n\nWiFi Mesh systems and WiFi Extenders both work on strengthening WiFi signal and eliminating dead spots in your home. However, these two solutions work quite differently. Here are the main differences between the two:\n\nWIFI COVERAGE\n\nThe range that WiFi Extenders can cover is much smaller than that of a WiFi Mesh system. Typically, extenders can extend WiFi signal by 300 to 2,000 sq. ft. whereas WiFi Mesh systems can cover areas from 2,000 to 6,000 sq. ft with 3 mesh units. And if additional units are added, the coverage area can be extended further. This makes WiFi Mesh systems perfect for large homes and multi-level homes.\n\nNETWORK\n\nIn a typical setup that uses an Extender, users often see multiple network names – one network offered by your wireless router and the others offered by the Extenders. You will need to manually switch from one network to another depending on which device you are nearest to, which can be inconvenient if you move around the house a lot. Mesh Systems, on the other hand, offer a seamless roaming experience as devices are able to automatically connect to the closest mesh unit.\n\nSET UP AND MANAGEMENT\n\nSetting up a WiFi Extender can be a challenge as it needs to be manually configured to work with your router. Managing and configuring it can also be inconvenient as you will be required to access the software through a webpage, while connected to your network, in order to change the settings or install updates. Meanwhile, Mesh Systems come with user-friendly apps, which have a step-by-step, visual setup guide setup and through the app, users can conveniently manage the network, even outside the home.\n\nFEATURES\n\nWiFi Extenders simply address WiFi signal issues in your home. WiFi Mesh systems, however, have so much more to offer as they come with features like Parental Controls and Guest WiFi.\n\nOverall, WiFi Mesh systems are smarter and more intuitive, have better coverage, are more convenient to use and have a lot more useful and relevant features vs. WiFi Extenders. WiFi Mesh systems are perfect for large homes, households with multiple devices that engage in bandwidth-hungry activities.\n\nWhat do I need to start putting together my WiFi Mesh system?\n\nIf you are a new WiFi Mesh user, you will need at least two WiFi Mesh units to start building your system. One unit will serve as your WiFi Mesh Router and this will be connected to your Fiber Modem. The other WiFi Mesh unit can serve as your WiFi Mesh Access Point and can be placed in the area or room where WiFi signal is absent weak so that coverage is extended to the mentioned area. You may add as many WiFi Mesh Access Points as needed.\n\nWhat are the available WiFi Mesh systems to choose from?\n\nPLDT offers three WiFi Mesh models to choose from. Below is a comparative of these devices.\n\nTP LINK M5 TP LINK M4 TENDA MW6 COVERAGE 5,500 sq. ft. for 3 units 5,500 sq. ft. for 3 units 6,000 sq. ft. for 3 units CONNECTION SPEEDS Up to 1Gbps Up to 1Gbps Up to 1Gbps CHIPSET Qualcomm Quad Core CPU Qualcomm Quad Core CPU Dual-core Realtek WIRELESS Dual-band AC 1300 Dual-band AC 1200 Dual-band AC 1200 PORTS 2 x GE LAN/WAN 2 x GE LAN/WAN 1xGE LAN / 1xGE WAN/LAN BEAMFORMING* SEAMLESS ROAMING PARENTAL CONTROLS GUEST WiFi ANTIVIRUS SIMULTANEOUS DEVICES Up to 100 devices Up to 100 devices Up to 35 devices PRICE As low as P109/mo for 36 mos As low as 99/mo for 36 mos As low as 99/mo for 36 mos\n\n*Transmission of signals in the direction of your wireless devices, ensuring optimum connectivity.\n\nHow many units do I need for my home?\n\nWe recommend having one mesh device per 100 square meters or 1,000 square feet for sufficient and effective WiFi coverage. But here are the recommended WiFi Mesh setups per type of home:\n\nSmall bungalow or 1-bedroom apartments\n\nTwo WiFi Mesh units should be enough for this type of home. One unit will be plugged directly to your modem and the other can be placed in a spot in the area which the WiFi signal from your modem does not reach.\n\nLarge bungalow, two-storey home or townhouses\n\nFor best results, we recommend atleast 3 WiFi Mesh devices. One unit will be plugged directly to your modem and the other can be distributed throughout your home, following the above recommended distance between mesh units.\n\nThree-storey home or bigger\n\nTwo WiFi Mesh units per floor would be the optimum number of mesh devices especially for houses that are 150 square meters or more. One unit will be plugged directly to your modem while the other units may be distributed throughout the home.\n\nHow do I know where to place my WiFi Mesh units?\n\nYou don’t need fancy software to identify WiFi dead spots in your home. You may simply pick up your wireless device, connect to your WiFi network and walk around your house. Pay attention to the WiFi signal indicator on your device. If signal strength drops or goes down to zero then you’ve found a weak signal area or a dead spot.\n\nIn addition, your WiFi Mesh system, once it has been set up, will also tell you via the app the quality of the signal in the area where it is placed so you can be guided on where best to place your mesh units.\n\nHow do I ensure I have the optimal WiFi Mesh setup?\n\nKnow which areas in your home have low or no WiFi signal and place your mesh units in the center of these areas. Avoid placing your WiFi mesh units in the corner of a room or near a window as this will limit WiFi range. These devices emit spherical shaped signal so it’s best to have them positioned in the center of a room, far from any physical obstructions like walls, cabinets and shelves, so that it can evenly distribute strong WiFi signal across the area. It also helps improve signal if you place your mesh units at eye-level or higher.\n\nMake sure your mesh units are also far from any metal objects or appliances that emit electromagnetic waves such as the ones listed below (naming a few) as these cause signal interference.\n\nMicrowave ovens\n\nWireless audio equipment\n\nBaby Monitors\n\nWireless Cameras\n\nCordless Telephones\n\nSatellite TV receivers\n\nOther Routers\n\nPrinters\n\nWhat is the ideal distance between my WiFi Mesh units?\n\nA good rule of thumb is to place the WiFi Mesh units approximately 100 to 150 square feet apart from one another, free from obstructions and wireless interferences. Note that this distance may vary depending on the setup of your home (e.g., thickness and materials used for walls).\n\nHow do I set up my WiFi Mesh system?\n\nAll the WiFi Mesh systems that we offer come with a companion app, which makes setting up the mesh network easy and convenient! The app will give you a step-by-step guide on how to quickly install and manage your network.\n\nYou may download the following apps on Google Play or the Apple Store, depending on the mesh units that you have:\n\nTP Link Deco – TP Link Deco App\n\nTenda Nova – Tenda Nova App\n\nOnce you’ve downloaded and opened these apps, make sure your WiFi and GPS are turned on before you start the setup process so that your setup experience will be seamless.\n\nHow can I avail of a WiFi Mesh system from PLDT?\n\nThere are several ways to get a WiFi Mesh system from PLDT:\n\nThe easiest way to get mesh units is thru this website. You may apply directly via pldthome.com/wholehomesystem and with just a few steps, you can purchase mesh units, to be billed on top of your PLDT Statement of Account, subject to your credit rating. Mesh units purchased thru the website will be delivered directly to your home.\n\nIf you are in the mall or near a PLDT Store, our mesh units are also available for purchase in branches nationwide. Store-purchased mesh will be released over the counter to you, subject ofcourse to the availability of stocks and mesh models per store.\n\nIf you prefer to speak to our customer care agents, you may also course your request for mesh units through the PLDT Hotline 171 and get your mesh units via delivery.\n\nOur mesh units are also available at the official PLDT Home Pages on Lazada and Shopee. If you are a PLDT Home subscriber, we still recommend you get it from PLDT sales channels so that we can link your mesh to your PLDT account and provide you with comprehensive after-sales. Mesh units purchased thru Lazada and Shopee are covered only by a 15-day replacement warranty\n\nCan I avail of a WiFi Mesh system without a PLDT internet connection?\n\nYes, you may purchase a WiFi Mesh system from PLDT thru the official PLDT Home pages on Lazada and Shopee. A 15-day replacement warranty applies, subject to Lazada and Shopee rules.\n\nHowever, if you are an existing PLDT Home subscriber, it is still best that you purchase your WiFi Mesh units from PLDT so that you can enjoy the following:\n\nAffordable amortized monthly payments of up to 36 months\n\nConvenient payment of mesh monthly fee via PLDT bill\n\n12-month replacement warranty c/o PLDT\n\nWhat is the lock-in period if I get a WiFi Mesh system?\n\nThis will depend on the payment option you choose when you purchase a WiFi Mesh system from PLDT as your lock-in will correspond to this.\n\n24 months amortization – 24 months lock-in\n\n36 months amortization – 36 month lock-in\n\nWhat is the difference between a WiFi 5 and WiFi 6 Mesh?\n\nWiFi 5 and WiFi 6 refer to the technologies that power a WiFi Mesh system. And the latter is the latest and best WiFi Mesh technology available in the country today. Here’s why:\n\nBIGGER BANDWIDTH AND FASTER SPEEDS\n\nWiFi 6 expands the WiFi channel width you are able to access from 80 MHz to 160MHz – that’s double the channel width internet traffic can pass through! Imagine that with WiFi 5, traffic passes through a single lane. With WiFi 6, traffic is able to pass through 2 lanes, creating a faster connection from your router to the device you are using.\n\nINCREASED EFFICIENCY WITH OFDMA\n\nOFDMA stands for Orthogonal Frequency-division multiple access. This sounds like a mouthful but simply put, it is an innovation for structuring data transmissions. OFDMA allows multiple simultaneous users to access the same channel at the same time by ensuring that the data sent by these users are processed efficiently and with minimal conflict. Think of your WiFi connection as a series of delivery trucks delivering data packets to your devices. With WiFi 5, each delivery truck could only deliver one parcel to one device at a time. With OFDMA, each truck can deliver multiple parcels to multiple devices simultaneously. This vast improvement in efficiency works for both uploads and downloads.\n\nIMPROVED MULTIPLE DEVICE CONNECTIVITY WITH MU-MIMO\n\nMU-MIMO refers to Multi-user, multiple-input, multiple-output technology. WiFi 5 MU-MIMO only works for downloads with up to 4 streams while WiFi 6 MU-MIMO works with both uploads and downloads with up to 8 streams (depending on the device model capabilities). This means that whether you’re streaming, downloading, playing Virtual or Augmented Reality, MMOs or RPGs, there’s more than enough bandwidth for everyone.\n\nMINIMAL INTERFERENCE WITH BSS COLOR\n\nInterference from other wireless networks can cause issues with your WiFi signal. BSS or Base Service Station Color marks from neighboring networks so that your router can ignore them.\n\nREDUCED POWER CONSUMPTION\n\nWiFi 6 gives your devices an improved Target Wake Time (TWT). Target Wake Time is the feature that allows devices to negotiate when and how often they turn on and off based on when they need to send and receive data. This has a significant impact on device battery life since not all devices need to be switched on during all hours of the day as they only turn on when they need to perform a task. This feature significantly prolongs battery life.\n\nWith all these features, WiFi 6 Mesh proves to be significantly more powerful, faster and more efficient vs. WiFi 5. With WiFi 6, you can experience lag-free downloading and uploading of multiple large files, streaming of 8K video content, hardcore gaming and running of numerous Smart Home devices – making it the standard for device and bandwidth heavy environments.\n\nTo see PLDT Home’s Wifi 6 offers, please visit: https://pldthome.com/wifi6"
