        "text": "\"I’m looking forward to new adventures at PBS and getting the chance to grow and learn in such a great environment. I’m excited to be a part of something that gives back to so many people across the country, and that supports their employees in meaningful ways. My ideal workplace was somewhere that allowed me to exercise my creative and analytical sides of my brain while also contributing to a greater common good, and PBS has been the perfect match.\"\n\nMaggie Hardy, Senior Program Associate - General Audience Programming\n\n\"Having never worked in public media, I didn’t know what to expect or if I even had a shot with PBS. But every conversation - from the first emails with my now-supervisor to the quick chats with future teammates, to my correspondence with HR and meeting department leaders - was about more than how my skillset fit the role, but about making real connections with people who wanted to see me succeed, no matter the outcome. That has carried over into a truly positive and uplifting work environment that I’m proud to be a part of today.\"\n\nJimmy Donofrio, Director, Communications and Operations - Station Services\n\n\"I’ve enjoyed working for a company where I can bring my whole self to work. My lived experiences as a mother, woman, and person of color are valued just as equally as my education and skills. I love that I’m trusted to do my job and provided autonomy to set direction and make decisions. At PBS, I’ve been able to define my own career and create a path for a bright future.”\n\nTia Graham, Vice President, Individual Giving - PBS Foundation\n\nIt’s a privilege to work in an organization with such a strong legacy of service. Everyday, I get to work alongside creative and dedicated colleagues all focused on educating, inspiring and entertaining our audiences. I joined the team 22 years ago as Program Associate. I thought it was just a job, but I quickly learned how special this organization is. PBS taught me how to make the most out of what I can offer and provided incredible opportunities for me to do the same for others. If you are up for the challenge of a unique and awesome sized mission, consider joining our team!\n\nDavid Fields, Vice President, Content Operations - Technology and Operations\n\n“My internship with PBS KIDS was very eye-opening and engaging experience! There was a lot of opportunities to be involved in things even past your initial responsibilities, and as a result I got to do many interesting things as well! It's a great team and a good working environment too.”\n\n– Christopher Kwok, Former Intern '22\n\n“I already knew that I wanted to be in kid’s media, and this summer solidified that. During my internship, I learned that I want to know about kids what they want/need from their interactions with media. Kids are the reason our content at PBS KIDS exist, and they are the experts in fun, so it is important to listen to their ideas to stay connected to the things they think/dream about.”\n\n– Bailey Long, Senior Associate, Content, PBS KIDS/Former Intern '22"
