The IRS will then verify your information.\n\nAfter the IRS verifies your information, your payment processor (ACI Payments Inc. or Pay1040) will then send you a second email with a link to your payment barcode and instructions.\n\nStep 4: Take your barcode and cash payment to a participating retailer\n\nEither print the payment barcode at home or send it to your smart phone. Take your payment barcode and payment to any participating retailer to make your payment.\n\nYou will receive a receipt from the store after they accept your cash. This receipt is confirmation of your payment and should be kept for your records."
