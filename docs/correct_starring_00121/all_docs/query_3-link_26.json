Shortly after the birth of her younger sister, Angela, she and the family immigrated to Los Angeles, California. Cartwright began her career as a child actress in 1958 with a role in the World War II film \"In Love and War.\" On television, she appeared in four episodes of the sitcom \"Leave it to Beaver,\" playing Beaver's classmates Violet Rutherford and Peggy MacIntosh. Around this time, she also made appearances on the programs \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents,\" \"Make Room for Daddy,\" \"Route 66,\" \"The Twilight Zone,\" and \"The Eleventh Hour.\"\n\nIn the early 60s, Cartwright had significant roles as a child actress in two hit films: William Wyler's \"The Children's Hour\" and Alfred Hitchcock's \"The Birds.\" In the former, she played the character of Rosalie Wells opposite actresses Audrey Hepburn and Shirley MacLaine. In the Hitchcock film, Cartwright played Cathy Brenner, a girl whose birthday party is besieged by seagulls. Among her other child acting credits were the film \"One Man's Way\" and the television series \"Daniel Boone,\" on which she portrayed daughter Jemima Boone during the show's first two seasons.\n\nFurther Film Career\n\nFollowing an 11-year hiatus from film, Cartwright returned in 1975 in the British film \"Inserts,\" starring opposite Bob Hoskins, Richard Dreyfuss, and Jessica Harper.
