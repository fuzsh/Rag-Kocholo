        "text": "A 1983 Best Picture Nominee, The Right Stuff is a heart-stirring and visually opulent look at the formation of the U S space program that might be a tad overlong, but provides solid entertainment with a historical accurate story, incredible production values, and a once in a lifetime all-star cast.\n\nThe film begins in the mid 1950's as we watch air force pilot Chuck Yeager (Sam Shepherd) become the first pilot to break the sound barrier, a move that has the air force going after their next goal, space exploration and beating the Russians to it. This leads to the formation of the Mercury 7 team of astronauts consisting of Alan Shepherd (Scott Glenn), Gordon Cooper (Dennis Quaid), John Glenn (Ed Harris), Gus Grissom (Fred Ward), Scott Carpenter (Charles Frank), Wally Schirra (Lance Henricksen), and Duke Slayton (Scott Paulin). The film documents their often rigorous training regiment, the effect this program has on their families, and the battle for ultimate control of their missions because it is implied that the administration who controls the program doesn't really know what they're doing.\n\nDirector and co-screenwriter Tom Wolfe based the screenplay on a book by Wolfe and that's one of the great things about this movie. It's difficult to articulate, but this recreation of historical events plays out as fiction, because Kaufman and Wolfe put the audience right in the center of the incredible events that take place here, as well a inside the minds and hearts of the people involved. I've often complained in the past about films that cover too much territory. This film covers a lot of territory and does it really well.\n\nThere's no denying that the film is a real time commitment and didn't need to be quite as long as it is, but there isn't a whole lot that I could see cutting. There's a flashback scene with Cooper and his wife (Pamela Reed) that we could have lived without and some discreet editing of the Yeager story was possible since once the Mercury 7 team was chosen, Yeager was pushed to the periphery of the story and then brought him back for a heart-stopping finale. Loved a lot of the training sequences, including the guys' struggles to produce a sperm sample, John Glenn's tirade against the guys' extra curricular activities, the tragedy of Gus Grissom's first solo flight, and Glenn's return to earth after his first mission, scenes which made any slow spots in the film irrelevant.\n\nIn addition to the Best Picture nomination, the film received seven other nominations and won richly deserved statues for Sound, Sound Effects Editing , Film Editing, and Bill Conti's thunderous music. Sam Shepherd received a Best Supporting Actor nomination, but this reviewer thinks that nomination should have gone to either Scott Glenn, Ed Harris, or Dennis Quaid, who I have never enjoyed onscreen more as the cocky Gordon Cooper. Also loved Donald Moffat as LBJ. Other stars who pop up along the way include Barbara Hershey, Veronica Cartwright, Scott Wilson, Kim Stanley, Jeff Goldblum, Harry Shearer, and John Dehner. A dazzling motion picture experience more than worth the time commitment."
