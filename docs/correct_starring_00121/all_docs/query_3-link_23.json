        "text": "It’s been 39 years since Ridley Scott’s classic horror sci-fi movie “Alien” opened in U.S. theaters. On May 25, the anniversary of the film’s release, cast member Veronica Cartwright will share memories of the film prior to a screening at this year’s Omaha Film Event. Proceeds will benefit the Nebraska Kidney Association (see www.omahafilmevent.com).\n\n“The film still holds up,” said Cartwright, from Los Angeles, who played navigation officer Lambert on the merchant spaceship Nostromo. “Ridley had an incredible eye. Everything was built and filmed on the largest sound stage in London, so walking onto those sets was an incredible experience.”\n\nWhile tame by today’s standards of graphic screen violence, “Alien” still creeped out audiences due to a menacing monster eerily metamorphosing through several life stages – concluding with the adult creature portrayed by Nigerian Bolaji Badejo (1953-1992), in a costume.\n\n“He was extremely thin and almost 7-ft tall, from the Masai tribe, and they discovered him in a (London) pub. They built the alien suit to fit his body and sent him to mime and tai chi classes so he could roll into a ball, then unfold himself. Oh my God, in that suit, he was incredibly creepy so I just worked off of him in my final scene where Lambert is killed. He was actually a graphic artist, not an actor, but got along with everyone and was a really lovely person.”\n\nAnother memorable scene for Cartwright features the alien in post-embryonic form emerging from John Hurt’s chest while the remaining cast – Sigourney Weaver, Tom Skerritt, Harry Dean Stanton, Ian Holm, and Yaphet Kotto – watch in horror.\n\n“We didn’t really rehearse that scene,” recalled Cartwright, who knew something (a puppet dubbed the chestburster) would be popping out of Hurt’s fake chest. When it did, she says the surprise reaction by her and the rest of the cast was genuine. She was also splatted with more fake blood than expected.\n\n“As I leaned in to watch, a blood jet hit me in the face. I backed up but hit my knees and flipped over (unseen on film), then quickly got back into the scene.”\n\nCartwright first viewed the completed film at the Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood after it opened in 1979.\n\n“There was no formal premiere,” she recalled. “I actually stood in line to see it like everyone else. I was a bit disappointed they never did shoot my actual death scene – I was supposed to hide in a locker and be pulled out by the alien. So all you see is the alien’s tail moving up my body, which was actually Harry Dean’s in the scene. Later, they filmed me hanging from a meat hook, but you just see my legs hanging down covered in blood.”\n\nCritical reaction to “Alien” was mixed on release, but today many regard it as one of the all-time great sci-fi thrillers.\n\nCartwright was also surprised by the reaction to her short hair after wrapping up filming and returning to the U.S. “I must have been the only woman in America who had a crew cut then, because people looked at me as if I was an alien myself!”\n\nBut the role brought her publicity and she went on to work on numerous TV and film projects including hit movies such as “The Right Stuff” and “The Witches of Eastwick” (see www.veronica-cartwright.com).\n\n“None of us were really famous actors at the time we made ‘Alien,’ but Ridley Scott felt there was great competence in the cast and I think we all realized we were part of something that could become bigger than we anticipated,” recalled Cartwright. “And with no CGI, what you see is actually as it was. I think people still really appreciate that.”\n\nNick Thomas teaches at Auburn University at Montgomery, Ala, and has written features, columns, and interviews for over 700 newspapers and magazines.
