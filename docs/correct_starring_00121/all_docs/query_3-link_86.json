        "text": "The Michael Connelly character Hieronymus (Harry) Bosch first premiered in a series of books in 1992. In the summer of 2022, the character has led to 24 distinct books and two distinct television shows. We focus here on the first season of the series Bosch (2014-2021), starring Titus Welliver in the title role for the series.\n\nHarry Bosch is a homicide detective in the Hollywood neighborhood of Los Angeles, California for the Los Angeles Police Department. Beyond his past service with the United States Army in the Persian Gulf War of 1990-1991 and Afghanistan, part of the discovery of the first season is learning about how Harry Bosch‘s past impacts the case presented with this season. The underlying story for this season of ten episodes was adapted from the Michael Connelly books The Concrete Blonde of 1994, City of Bones of 2002 and Echo Park of 2006.\n\nThe story of the season deals primarily with the discovery of buried skeleton in the woods. The deceased is a boy that had been horribly beaten, with evidence of abuse that had occurred for a prolonged period before this. Jerome (Jerry) Edgar, as portrayed by Jamie Hector, catches the case with Harry Bosch, who is standing trial in federal court. Amy Aquino portrayed Grace Billets, a lieutenant, supervisor and friend to Harry.\n\nWhile quarreling with deputy chief Irvin Irving over the federal case, Raynard Waits, a serial killer pulled over for a traffic violation, confesses to the child murder being investigated by Jerry Edgar and Harry Bosch. The case leads from here leads to Jerry and Harry getting into the details of the dead boy’s past. Jason Gedrick portrayed Raynard Waits as Lance Reddick portrayed Irvin Irving.\n\nHarry takes an escalating romantic interest in Julia Brasher, a rookie police officer assigned to the same station. Tensions escalate following the trial and with changing circumstances with Raynard Waits, which leads to further action towards Harry from Irvin Irving. The escalating circumstances leads Harry to buckle down on the current case in front of him. Traveling to Las Vegas, Nevada to see his ex-wife Eleanor Wish, as portrayed by Sarah Clarke, professional assistance from his ex-wife is requested. Annie Wersching portrayed Julia Brasher.\n\nHarry takes the time to additionally see the daughter Eleanor and he share while in Las Vegas. Maddie, the daughter to Eleanor and Harry, is portrayed by Madison Lintz. Things escalate and change interpersonally on many levels at this point, taking a mature, sophisticated and engaging path through much of the background of characters introduced through the above background. The emotional intensity grows with each episode and change of circumstances.\n\nThe conclusion of season one addresses many questions. Many unresolved issues setup intrigue that it seems clear will present fodder heading into future seasons that are on the way. The show itself is meant for a mature audience, with my recommendation to consider this point. I grant the first season of Bosch, presented as an Amazon original series, 4.5-stars on a scale of 1-to-5.\n\nMatt – Wednesday, July 27, 2022\n\nRidley Scott‘s second film that spawned a movie franchise while launching the acting career for Sigourney Weaver. Alien (1979) premiered in May of 1979 at the fourth Seattle International Film Festival (SIFF), with a broad release later that summer. The film won an Academy Award for Visual Effects, garnering wide critical and fan esteem in the science fiction horror genre.\n\n(John Hurt as Kane, Veronica Cartwright as Lambert, Tom Skerritt as Dallas, Yaphet Kotto as Parker, Sigourney Weaver as Ripley, Harry Dean Stanton as Brett, and Ian Holm as Ash from the film Alien).\n\nRidley Scott directed the Dan O’Bannon written film Alien, which follows the crew of the commercial space ship Nostromo. After having mined a world for cargo ostensibly valuable on Earth from far outside our solar system, the crew is awakened to discover the possibility of life on a moon more than six weeks from home. By the terms of their contract, the crew must investigate or risk not getting paid upon delivering their cargo.\n\n( From left, Ian Holm as Ash, Sigourney Weaver as Ripley, Tom Skerritt as Dallas, and John Hurt as Kane in the film Alien).\n\nWhen landing on the moon in question, the Nostromo sustains damage when traveling through a challenging atmosphere for landing on a rocky landscape. Parker and Brett, as portrayed by Yaphet Kotto and Harry Dean Stanton, repair the ship while Dallas, Kane, and Lambert, portrayed by Tom Skerritt, John Hurt, and Veronica Cartwright, head out to investigate the signal that prompted the crew to land on the moon. It is during this time that Ripley, as portrayed by Sigourney Weaver, deciphers part of the message that brought the Nostromo to the alien moon as a warning.\n\n(From left, Yaphet Kotto as Parker, Sigourney Weaver as Ripley, Ian Holm as Ash in the film Alien).\n\nUnable to communicate the warning to the exploration crew, Dallas, Kane, and Lambert stumble upon a chamber containing hundreds of eggs, Kane is attacked by a creature that breaks through his helmet and attaches to his face. Dallas and Lambert carry Kane back to the Nostromo. Ash, as portrayed by Ian Holm, overrules a command decision by Ripley and allows entry onto the Nostromo to Dallas, Lambert and Kane.\n\n(Bolaji Badejo as Alien and Veronica Cartwright as Lambert in the film Alien).\n\nIt is at this point that the stage is clearly set for what transitions Alien from a science fiction film to science fiction horror film. Movie time and suspense passes before the audience is introduced to Bolaji Badejo as the title character, Alien. The intelligence controlling the Nostromo, known as mother and voiced by Helen Horton, becomes one of multiple characters to question along the journey of the larger movie.\n\n(Sigourney Weaver in character as Ripley with Alien director Ridley Scott).\n\nThe film Alien fits in stylistically with many of the larger movie successes of the nineteen-seventies. While taking a bleak tone in the nature of the storytelling, the suspense building with a rising sense of tension accompanied by character revelation his many marks that land the movie into classic status. The feel of this movie makes this a worthwhile watch for those who haven’t seen it yet are looking for an entertaining escape. My rating for Alien as directed by Ridley Scott is 4.25-stars on a scale of one-to-five.\n\nMatt – Wednesday, May 6, 2020\n\nThe United States Library of Congress chose to preserve the film The Birds (1963) for preservation in 2016. As quoted by the Internet Movie Database, the Alfred Hitchcock film follows a “wealthy San Francisco socialite [who] pursues a potential boyfriend to a small Northern California town that slowly takes a turn for the bizarre when birds of all kinds suddenly begin to attack people.” This PG-rated examination of fear is worth your view.\n\n(Alfred Hitchcock directed the film The Birds).\n\nMelanie Daniels, as played by Tippi Hedren, wealthy San Francisco socialite. We first meet Melanie as she looks to retrieve birds she was looking to care for at a pet store in San Francisco, California. While she is waiting on the party due to deliver said birds at the pet store, Melanie becomes intrigued by a suitor named Mitch Brenner who comes calling upon her.\n\n(Tippi Hedren as Melanie Daniels in The Birds).\n\nRod Taylor stars in The Birds as Mitch Brenner, who frequents San Francisco as well the small town north of San Francisco named Bodega Bay. Writer Daphne du Maurier, who wrote the short story that became the feature film, had set the story in the English countryside. We come to experience Mitch as a charming ladies man and father who shares a Bodega Bay household with his mother and daughter. Melanie Daniels brings a pair of love birds to Mitch, creating the fiction that the birds are for Mitch’s daughter Cathy.\n\n(Rod Taylor as Mitch Brenner in The Birds).\n\nBefore meeting Mitch Brenner or his family in Bodega Bay, the story Alfred Hitchcock shares in The Birds introduces some characters and local color surrounding Bodega Bay. The subterfuge of a story that Melanie Daniels makes in offering the love birds to Mitch’s daughter Cathy first requires that Melanie visits the school teacher of the Bodega Bay School, Annie Hayworth. Suzanne Pleshette portrays Annie Hayworth, who came to Bodega Bay as a love interest of Mitch Brenner. Annie still has feelings for Mitch, yet is willing to help Melanie as she suffers the first bird attack on the island while Melanie also pursues a relationship with Mitch.\n\n(Suzanne Pleshette as Annie Hayworth in The Birds).\n\nJessica Tandy stars as Lydia Brenner, the domineering mother of Mitch Brenner. After multiple odd experiences with birds randomly attacking, it is Lydia who experiences the first large emotional shock of the film when she visits a neighboring farm when seeking help with the erratic behavior of chickens on the Brenner farm. Lydia finds the farmer’s eyeless corpse in his bedroom, who was the victim of a clear bird attack.\n\n(Jessica Tandy as Lydia Brenner in The Birds).\n\nWhen this information is shared with the family, Melanie aims to care for an emotionally vulnerable Lydia by offering tea and comfort. The notion of a relationship between Mitch and Melanie is broached in this, and a thawing in the relationship between the two ladies begins. Shortly thereafter, the notion for where Cathy Brenner, Mitch’s daughter, is raised. Melanie heads to Bodega Bay School in an attempt to assuage the Lydia’s concerns.\n\n(Veronica Cartwright as Cathy Brenner in The Birds).\n\nMelanie Daniels heads to the school to find Annie Cartwright teaching a one-room school house full of kids fully engaged in a lesson full of singing. Cathy Brenner, as portrayed by Veronica Cartwright, is engaged in the lesson. It is only after Melanie assesses the situation as normal, and then sits down to a smoke, that crows begin to assemble atop the playground equipment in anticipation of another attack. Melanie and Annie work together to have the school kids flea the birds, which in turn prompts another bird attack.\n\n(Ethel Griffies as Mrs. Bundy in The Birds).\n\nIn the aftermath of the school attack, Melanie lands in a diner where she aims to get word of the event to Mitch Brenner and others who can help to address the situation. The folks in the diner overhear the conversation, aiming to offer various thoughts and opinions surrounding whether birds are likely to attack. A voice that is given much credibility in the opinion sharing, yet is largely rejected as not being born out by the facts of the occasion of several attacks, is ornithologist Mrs. Bundy. It was Mrs. Bundy, as portrayed by Ethel Griffies, the Drunken Doomsayer in the Diner as portrayed by Karl Swenson, and others who served to raise the tension that ultimately helps raise the tension towards the closing climax of the movie.\n\n(Karl Swenson as Drunken Doomsayer in the Diner in The Birds).\n\nThe major drive of The Birds brings the tension of at least three more attacks following the diner scene. At least one more major character in the film meets an untimely end to the birds. The resolution of the film comes with the attempted departure of some main characters from Bodega Bay. The fact that the reason behind for the bird attacks is not resolved, and if the remaining major characters experience a satisfying end to the tension raised, are two points I will withhold. I will admit that I appreciate the manner in which the film comes to a conclusion. I rate The Birds at 3.75-stars on a scale of one-to-five stars.\n\nMatt – Wednesday, May 1, 2019"
