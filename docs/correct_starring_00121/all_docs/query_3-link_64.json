Angela Cartwright made an uncredited film debut at the age of 3 in 1956's \"Somebody Up There Likes Me.\" The following year, she was cast as Danny Thomas's stepdaughter in \"Make Room for Daddy,\" which was retitled \"The Danny Thomas Show.\" Cartwright not only remained in the cast until the series ended in 1964, but reunited with Thomas in the 1970 sitcom sequel, \"Make Room for Granddaddy.\" Her career peaked when she was cast as Brigitta von Trapp in the 1965 classic \"The Sound of Music.\" That same year, Cartwright played Penny Robinson, the pre-teen middle child of Professor John Robinson and wife Maureen in Irwin Allen's science fiction series, \"Lost in Space.\" Following the show's cancellation after three seasons, Cartwright drifted away from show business, her only other film appearances being in 1979's Allen-directed \"Beyond the Poseidon Adventure\" and a cameo in the 1998 motion picture remake of \"Lost in Space.\"\n\nHighest rated movies\n\n86% Somebody Up There Likes Me\n\n83% The Sound of Music\n\n27% Lost in Space\n\n0% Beyond the Poseidon Adventure\n\nPhotos\n\nSOUND OF MUSIC, Angela Cartwright, Nicolas Hammond, Heather Menzies, 1965, TM & copyright (c) 20th Century Fox Film Corp.
