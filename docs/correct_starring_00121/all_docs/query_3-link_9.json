Her career as a child actress began in 1958, with a role in In Love and War. Among her early appearances was a semi-regular part in the television series Leave It to Beaver (as Beaver's classmate \"Violet Rutherford\") and an episode of The Twilight Zone \"I Sing the Body Electric\" (1962). She guest starred twice in 1963 in NBC's medical drama about psychiatry, The Eleventh Hour, in the episodes \"The Silence of Good Men\" and \"My Name is Judith, I'm Lost, You See\".\n\nCareer life[]\n\nCartwright appeared in the films, The Children's Hour and Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds which were both highly successful. She was cast as daughter Jemima Boone in the first two seasons of NBC's Daniel Boone from 1964 until 1966, with co-stars Fess Parker, Patricia Blair, Darby Hinton and Ed Ames.\n\nCartwright's career slowed down during the late 1960s. She continued to work and achieved two of her biggest successes with Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978) and Alien (1979), the latter performance winning her a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress. She was originally cast as Alien's heroine Ellen Ripley, but director Ridley Scott switched her role with Sigourney Weaver's just prior to shooting the film."
