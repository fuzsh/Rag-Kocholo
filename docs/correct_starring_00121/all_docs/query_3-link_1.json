        "text": "British-American actress (born 1949)\n\nVeronica Cartwright (born April 20, 1949)[1] is a British-born American actress. She is known for appearing in science fiction and horror films, and has earned numerous accolades, including three Primetime Emmy Award nominations. Her younger sister is actress Angela Cartwright.\n\nAs a child actress, Cartwright appeared in supporting roles in The Children's Hour and The Birds, the latter of which was her first commercial success. She made her transition into mainstream, mature roles with 1978's Invasion of the Body Snatchers. She played Lambert in the science-fiction horror film Alien, which earned her recognition and a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress, and additionally appeared in the films The Right Stuff and The Witches of Eastwick which earned her praise. In the 1990s, she received three nominations for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series, one of which was for her role on ER and two of which were for her role in The X-Files.\n\nCartwright was born in Bristol, England, and grew up in Los Angeles, having emigrated to the US shortly after the birth of her younger sister, actress Angela Cartwright.\n\nIn 1958, her career as a child actress began with a role in In Love and War. Among her early appearances were repeated roles in the television series Leave It to Beaver (as Beaver's classmates Violet Rutherford and, later, Peggy MacIntosh) and episodes of One Step Beyond (\"The Haunting\") and The Twilight Zone (\"I Sing the Body Electric\").[2] In 1963, she guest starred twice in NBC's medical drama about psychiatry, The Eleventh Hour, in the episodes \"The Silence of Good Men\" and \"My Name is Judith, I'm Lost, You See\".\n\nCartwright appeared in the films The Children's Hour (1961) and Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds (1963),[3] which were both highly successful. In The Birds, she was cast along with her television father from Leave It to Beaver, Richard Deacon, although the two were not on screen together. She appeared in Spencer's Mountain (1963) with Henry Fonda and Kym Karath. She played daughter Jemima Boone in the first two seasons of NBC's Daniel Boone from 1964 until 1966, with co-stars Fess Parker, Patricia Blair, Darby Hinton, Ed Ames and Dallas McKennon. She won a regional Emmy Award for the television movie Tell Me Not in Mournful Numbers (1964).[3][4] She achieved adult success with film roles in Inserts (1974), Goin' South (1978) and Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978).\n\nCartwright's breakout feature was the science-fiction horror film Alien (1979), for which she was originally cast as Alien's heroine Ellen Ripley, but director Ridley Scott instead set her to play Lambert prior to shooting. The infamous chestburster scene in the film featured a genuine reaction from Cartwright, who had not been informed beforehand that blood would be involved;[5][6] co-star Tom Skerritt confirmed this by saying, \"What you saw on camera was the real response. She had no idea what the hell happened. All of a sudden this thing just came up.\" She won the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance.[7]\n\nHer subsequent film roles include The Right Stuff (1983), Flight of the Navigator (1986), The Witches of Eastwick (1987), Money Talks (1997), Scary Movie 2 (2001), Kinsey (2004) and Straight-Jacket (2004). She was nominated again for the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress for The Witches of Eastwick.\n\nA frequent performer in television, she has played guest roles in such series as Route 66, Leave It to Beaver, The Mod Squad, Miami Vice, Baywatch, L.A. Law, ER, The X-Files, Chicago Hope, Will & Grace, Touched by an Angel, Judging Amy, Six Feet Under, The Closer, and Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.[8] Cartwright has received three Emmy Award nominations,[9] one for her work in ER in 1997, and two for her work on The X-Files in 1998 and 1999. Cartwright also starred as Mrs. Olive Osmond in the made-for-TV film Inside the Osmonds.\n\nShe co-starred in the fourth version of Invasion of the Body Snatchers, The Invasion (2007). She appears on the cover art for the Scissor Sisters' 2006 single \"I Don't Feel Like Dancin'\" and on their second album Ta-Dah. In 2014, Cartwright reprised her role as Joan Lambert for DLC episodes in Alien: Isolation based on the original film, and appeared in the remake of The Town That Dreaded Sundown.[10][11] She played the role of Sibley Gamble, a psychic on General Hospital, between July 8, 2019, and July 16, 2019.[12]\n\nCartwright's many theatre credits include Electra, Talley's Folly, The Bat[13] and The Master Builder,[14] for which she received brilliant reviews. Her performances in The Hands of its Enemy,[15] The Triplet Collection and Homesteaders brought her Drama-Logue Awards for Best Actress.[16]\n\nCartwright's first marriage to Richard Gates lasted from 1968 to 1972. Her second husband was Stanley Goldstein, whom she married in 1976 and divorced in 1980. Her third marriage was to television director Richard Compton and they remained married until Compton's death in 2007.\n\nA Catholic, Cartwright and her sister Angela have attended Mass at St. Charles Borromeo.[17]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1958 In Love and War Allie O'Neill Uncredited 1961 The Children's Hour Rosalie Wells 1963 The Birds Cathy Brenner Spencer's Mountain Becky Spencer Uncredited 1964 One Man's Way Mary 1975 Inserts Harlene 1978 Goin' South Hermine Invasion of the Body Snatchers Nancy Bellicec The Kid from Not-So-Big Corinne 1979 Alien Joan Lambert 1983 Nightmares Claire Houston Segment: \"Night of the Rat\" The Right Stuff Betty Grissom 1984 Terror in the Aisles Nancy Bellicec Archive footage from Invasion of the Body Snatchers 1985 My Man Adam Elaine Swit 1986 Flight of the Navigator Helen Freeman 1987 Wisdom Samantha Wisdom The Witches of Eastwick Felicia Alden 1989 Valentino Returns Patricia \"Pat\" Gibbs 1990 False Identity Vera Errickson 1991 Walking the Dog Unknown Short film 1992 Man Trouble Helen Dextra 1994 Mirror, Mirror 2: Raven Dance Sister Aja Speed Bag Lady Uncredited On Hope Woman In Grocery Short film Two Over Easy Molly Short film 1995 Candyman: Farewell to the Flesh Octavia Tarrant 1996 Shoot the Moon Mrs. Thomas 1997 Money Talks Connie Cipriani Sparkler Dottie Delgato 1998 My Engagement Party Sarah Salsburg 1999 A Slipping-Down Life Mrs. Casey Trash Principal Evans 2001 In the Bedroom Minister On Television Critic's Choice Watkins Short film Scary Movie 2 Mother 2002 Mackenheim Eleanor Short film 2003 Just Married Mrs. \"Pussy\" McNerney Uncredited 2004 Twisted Landlady Uncredited Straight-Jacket Jerry Albrecht Kinsey Sara Kinsey 2005 Barry Dingle Eleanor Dingle 2007 Mommy's House Mommy Short film The Invasion Wendy Lenk 2009 Call of the Wild Sheriff Taylor 2010 Neowolf Mrs. Belakov 2011 InSight Patricia Montana Amazon Margaret 2012 The Yellow Wallpaper Catherine Sayer 2013 The Odd Way Home Francine 2014 The Town That Dreaded Sundown Grandma Lillian 2015 The Dark Below Tess 2019 Limbo Louise 2019 The Field Edith 2020 Breaking Fast Judy 2022 The Phantoms Miss Sayer\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1959 Zane Grey Theater Sarah Butler Episode: \"The Lone Woman\" Make Room for Daddy Girl in Play Episode: \"Bob Hope and Danny Become Directors\" 1959â€“1961 Leave It to Beaver Violet Rutherford Episode: \"The Tooth\"\n\nEpisode: \"Beaver and Violet\"\n\nEpisode: \"Beaver's Rat\" 1960 Alcoa Presents: One Step Beyond Gillian Episode: \"The Haunting\" The Betty Hutton Show Fake Foster Child Uncredited, Episode: \"Gullible Goldie\" 1960 Alfred Hitchcock Presents Viola Wellington Season 5 Episode 35: \"The Schwartz-Metterklume Method\" (uncredited) 1961 Alfred Hitchcock Presents Judy Davidson / Lettie / Lauretta Bishop Season 6 Episode 15: \"Summer Shade\" 1961 Make Room for Daddy Veronica Episode: \"Teacher for a Day\" 1962 Route 66 Miriam - age 9 Episode: \"Love Is a Skinny Kid\" The Twilight Zone Anne Rogers - age 11 Episode: \"I Sing the Body Electric\" S3 E35 1963 The Dick Powell Theatre Unknown Episode: \"The Third Side of a Coin\" Leave It to Beaver Peggy MacIntosh Episode: \"Don Juan Beaver\" The Eleventh Hour Judith Cameron / Jan Ellendale Episode: \"My Name Is Judith, I'm Lost, You See\"\n\nEpisode: \"The Silence of Good Men\" 1964 Tell Me Not in Mournful Numbers Unknown Television film 1964â€“1966 Daniel Boone Jemima Boone 37 episodes 1965 Dr. Kildare Nancy Hiller Episode: \"Take Care of My Little Girl\" Who Has Seen the Wind?
