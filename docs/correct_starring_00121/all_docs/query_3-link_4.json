        "text": "Accomplished character actress Veronica Cartwright began acting as a young girl after her family moved to Los Angeles in the mid-1950s. During that decade, Cartwright toiled in guest appearances and smaller roles while her younger sister Angela earned her place as a trivia question by playing Danny Thomas' daughter on \"Make Room For Daddy.\" Veronica landed good feature roles, however, ranging from her debut in \"In Love and War\" (1958) to the kleptomaniac forced to lie about her teachers in William Wyler's \"The Children's Hour\" (1961). In 1963, she was also the daughter of the family terrorized by Alfred Hitchcock's \"The Birds\" and Henry Fonda's child in \"Spencer's Mountain.\" Although her sister had become the TV regular, from 1959, Cartwright had the recurring role of the bullying Violet Rutherford (who gave Theodore his first kiss) on ABC's \"Leave It to Beaver\" and she spent two seasons (1964-66) as the frontiersman's daughter Jemima, on the NBC series \"Daniel Boone.\""
