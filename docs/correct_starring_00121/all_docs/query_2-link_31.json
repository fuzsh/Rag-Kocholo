        "text": "The Right Stuff was released on October 21, 1983 based on the book of the same name.\n\nThe film would make an estimated $21.1 million domestically during its run on an estimated budget of $27 million.\n\nThe Right Stuff received overwhelming acclaim from critics.\n\nRoger Ebert named The Right Stuff best film of 1983, writing, \"There was a lot going on, and there's a lot going on in the movie, too. The Right Stuff is an adventure film, a special effects film, a social commentary and a satire... it joins a short list of recent American movies that might be called experimental epics: movies that have an ambitious reach through time and subject matter, that spend freely for locations or special effects, but that consider each scene as intently as an art film... It's a great film.\" He later named it one of the best films of the decade and wrote, \"The Right Stuff is a greater film because it is not a straightforward historical account but pulls back to chronicle the transition from Yeager and other test pilots to a mighty public relations enterprise\". He later put it at #2 on his 10 best of the 1980s, behind Martin Scorsese's Raging Bull.\n\nGene Siskel, Ebert's co-host of At the Movies, also named The Right Stuff the best film of 1983, and said \"It's a great film, and I hope everyone sees it.\" Siskel also went on to include The Right Stuff at #3 on his list of the best films of the 1980s, behind Shoah and Raging Bull.\n\nThe Right Stuff would be nominated for seven Academy Awards including Best Picture, Supporting Actor (Shepard), Art Direction, and Cinematography, and win for Film Editing, Original Score, Sound, and Sound Effects Editing.\n\nIn 2013, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.\n\nThe Right Stuff currently holds a 96% among critics on RT, a 91 score on Metacritic, and a 4/5 on Letterboxd.\n\nAccording to NASA, the mysterious \"fireflies\" observed by John Glenn on his first orbital flight were actually condensed ice crystals from the small hydrogen peroxide rockets used for altitude control illuminated by sunlight. Upon use, many of them formed a particulate cloud around the spacecraft and attached themselves to the skin of the vehicle as well. This was confirmed by astronaut Scott Carpenter on the next Mercury flight when he banged on the craft's side, causing more of the flakes to break free and become visible.\n\nWhile several of the lead actors chose to meet their real-life counterparts, Scott Glenn elected not to meet with Alan Shepard. Scott said he wanted to get down Shepard's character and nuances by observation and by hearing others' points of view. After filming, the real Alan Shepard wrote writer and director Philip Kaufman and commented on Scott Glenn's \"spot-on\" performance - except for \"not being nearly as good-looking as he was.\"\n\nIt is generally believed that Gus Grissom was not at fault in the real-life hatch-blowing incident on the Liberty Bell 7 capsule. Kickback from the manual activation switch caused a tell-tale bruise to form on the hand activating it, and Grissom never developed the bruise. Wally Schirra, at the end of his Mercury 8 space flight, deliberately activated his own hatch to demonstrate how the bruise formed and exonerate his comrade. The most likely explanation for Grissom's hatch blowing is that the external release lanyard came loose as it was only held in place with a single screw - a design that was changed to be more secure for subsequent flights. N.A.S.A. apparently believed in Grissom's innocence as well, as he remained in a prime rotation spot for subsequent Gemini and Apollo flights. There is also significant belief among astronauts of the time that, had he not been killed in the Apollo 1 fire, Grissom would have been the first man to walk on the moon.\n\nDuring the weekend of April 4, 1999, Gus Grissom's lost Liberty Bell 7 capsule was located and recovered on the ocean floor ninety miles northeast of the Great Abaco Island in the Bahamas. It underwent a restoration and went on a national tour before being placed in a permanent exhibit at the Cosmosphere, a space museum in Hutchinson, Kansas. The hatch, which many thought would have proved or disproved Grissom's contention that it blew open on its own, has not been recovered. Inside the capsule the restorers found a large number of Mercury dimes that Grissom had brought along as souvenirs. During the bar scene before Grissom's flight, two rolls of dimes can be seen on the bar."
