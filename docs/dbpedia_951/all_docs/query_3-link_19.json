The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 9:38 a.m. in room 406, Senate Dirksen Building, Hon. James M. Inhofe (chairman of the subcommittee) presiding. Present: Senators Inhofe, Sessions, Thomas, and Boxer. Also present: Senator Baucus. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JAMES M. INHOFE, U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA Senator Inhofe. The hearing will now come to order. Today's hearing will examine the Breaux-Inhofe bill, S. 1084, which we call the Ozone and Particulate Matter Research Act of 1997. The legislation was introduced as a result of the new clean air standards for ozone and particulate matter promulgated by the EPA on July 17. And in the House we have a companion bill. It is H.R. 1984. This bill is worded essentially the same, with some modest changes in the $25 million that would be set aside for ozone research. Senator Breaux and I thought it was necessary to introduce this legislation because the EPA ignored the tremendous opposition to these new standards. Those who oppose the standards include everyone from the Governors, the U.S. Conference of Mayors--and I used to be on the board of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, and it's one certainly that cannot be accused of being a Republican organization--National League of Cities, National Association of County Officials, National Conference of State Legislators, and local government officials. The Farm Bureau, Farmers Union, Cattleman's Association, American Corn Growers, fertilizer and other groups, small business community, including NFIB, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Black Chamber of Commerce, Small Business Survival Committee, and a number of State environmental directors too long to articulate here. In total, there have been over 3,200 letters, resolutions, and comments expressing concern with these standards. While I don't want to take time to read the names of all the organizations who have sent these letters, I will distribute copies of an index. This is the index of these letters, Senator Sessions. And we're talking about thousands and thousands. Of course, we have many of them up here on the table. In addition, a number of organizations have written in support of this legislation being considered today. I would also like to introduce these letters into the record, showing more than 30 organizations supporting it. These are the letters that we have up here on the table. [The index of letters is printed at the end of the hearing record:] The House version currently has 191 co-sponsors, and the Senate bill has a bipartisan list of nine co-sponsors. I'm pleased to say that as of yesterday we added an additional 12 Senators, which means we now have 21 co-sponsors for the Senate bill. Before we get to the testimony today, I'd just like to briefly outline what the bill does. The bill establishes an independent panel to be convened by the National Academy of Sciences to prioritize the research needs on the health effects of particulate matter. This step would help bring consensus to any new standards proposed by the EPA in the future. So we're dealing not just with what has happened to us since the past-- in the last 11 months, but also what could happen in the future. So it would make the process a little bit more professional and predictable. With the recent standards, the EPA relied on epidemiological studies and research performed by former EPA employees. The National Academy of Sciences would help restore credibility to this process. Next, in order to ensure that the Federal dollars are spent on the research priorities of the independent panel, the legislation establishes a Particulate Matter Interagency Committee to coordinate the activities of Federal agencies engaged in particulate matter research. This committee will be composed of eight different a agencies and departments. This is not a new committee, as such, but a coordination of those efforts that are going on currently. The EPA will use this research, in addition to private research, to review the air quality criteria through the Clean Air Science Advisory Committee--CASAC--set up statutorily. This review must be completed no earlier than 4 years after the enactment of this Act. In addition to this science research, the EPA is authorized to require State implementation plans in order to establish a particulate matter monitoring program. During this research, the monitoring period, the original standards for ozone and particulate matter will be reinstated and shall not be revised until scientific review is completed. The legislation also directs the National Institutes of Health to begin a research program to study the health effects of allergens in asthmatics, particularly in regard to urban inner cities. One of the biggest holes in the EPA's proposal was identifying the true causes of respiratory problems in inner-city children. Finally, the legislation authorizes $100 million to carry out the provisions, with 25 million of that set aside for ozone research. This plan follows the advice of three of the four past CASAC chairs who testified before this committee. It concentrates on understanding the science. For the farmers, the small businessman, the unions, the mayors, and the Governors, it provides continuity. Today they are concerned at the EPA's implementation schedule. They realize it can be challenged and thrown out by the courts, and they need stability while they try to implement the 1990 standards. They say these will not be implemented until 6 or 9 years, in accordance with what came from the EPA, but the EPA knows well and everyone here knows well that there are lawsuits that could come forward and challenge the fact we have double standards. I would like to remind everyone what Mary Nichols, the former EPA Assistant Administrator for Air, said in our last hearing. This is a quote. ``Under the President's implementation schedule, the new standards will not save any lives over the next 5 years.'' Therefore, the Breaux-Inhofe bill will provide the necessary research, monitoring, and stability for the American people without endangering any lives. Senator Baucus, do you have an opening statement. Senator Baucus. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Actually, I'll defer to my colleague from California, Senator Boxer. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. BARBARA BOXER, U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA Senator Boxer. Thank you so much. Mr. Chairman, I wanted to thank Senator Baucus for his understanding. I have to be introducing a nominee over at the Judiciary Committee at 10:00 am. Mr. Chairman, with all due respect to you and Senator Breaux, I'm dismayed to see that the Subcommittee on Clean Air would give serious consideration to a bill that, in my opinion, will jeopardize clean air and the public health. S. 1084, the Ozone and Particulate Matter Research Act, would block the EPA from protecting the public health by blocking the new ozone and particulate clean air standards which have been in effect since September of 1997. This bill turns the clock back and reinstates the old, less-protective standards. S. 1084 would deny the American public the health protections they deserve, violating the most fundamental requirement of the Clean Air Act. The EPA estimates that this bill will result in at least 60,000 premature deaths--this bill that we're considering-- 300,000 additional cases of chronic bronchitis, 1.5 million asthma attacks, and 12.5 million work days lost. It seems to me for the Committee on the Environment and Public Works to be considering such a bill is a cruel irony. EPA has a statutory mandate to protect the public health with an adequate margin of safety. Those are the words in the law. Mr. Chairman, the very same arguments that we've heard today against new clean air standards we heard before the Clean Air Act was approved in 1970, an Act that was signed into law by then President Richard Nixon. And I have some of those quotes. I will not go into them today, but you couldn't tell the difference. When EPA announced the new ozone and particulate matter clean air standards in July of this year, it did so after an exhaustive scientific review, which indicated that current standards do not adequately protect public health. Under S. 1084, the EPA could not revise the ozone and particulate matter standards for at least 4 years, until further research and review by a new National Academy of Sciences panel and a new Inter-Agency Committee on Particulate Matter, a virtual duplication of the EPA effort, which resulted in the new standard. Are we going to keep redoing studies that we've already done until we find an answer every single person likes? I certainly hope not. We need to deal with reality , Mr. Chairman. When the EPA issued the new ozone and particulate matter standards earlier this year, it did so after an exhaustive scientific and public review process. The EPA analyzed thousands of peer-reviewed studies and presented its recommendations to an independent scientific advisory body, the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee. This committee concluded that EPA's standards for ozone and particulate matter needed to be strengthened, and I think it is important to note that the committee came out with a range--a range that it recommended--and the EPA took the middle of the road on this. And the panel included scientists from General Motors. They all agreed something had to be done, and they came out with a range, and the EPA hit that right down the middle. Mr. Chairman, I believe that, as Senators, we have no greater duty and responsibility than to protect the health and safety of the American people, and I look at that as an economic issue. I reject the argument that there's a conflict between clean air and the economy. I believe, if you look around the world, what you'll see in countries where the air is filthy dirty and they don't have any protective laws, economic growth grinds to a halt. It's very simple: if you can't breathe, you can't work. So we need to move forward, it seems to me, with these standards, and I think blocking them will have significant adverse impacts on the health of Americans, especially our children and the elderly. And we all know that when a society is judged, it's judged the way it treats the most vulnerable among us. The current annual average concentration of fine particulate matter in southeast Los Angeles County may be responsible for up to 3,000 deaths annually and more than 52,000 incidents of respiratory symptoms, including 1,000 hospital admissions. Young children constitute the largest group at high risk from exposure to air pollutants. They breathe 50 percent more air by body weight than the average adult. In California, alone, there are over six million children under the age of 14, and approximately 90 percent of them live in areas that fail to meed State and Federal standards. How are our children being affected? Studies show health effects ranging from 20 to 60 percent loss of lung capacity. It isn't fair, Mr. Chairman, that a baby born in a certain part of the county has less lung capacity than another. Despite this, representatives of industry claim that a 30 percent loss of lung capacity is not really a health effect because it's only a temporary, reversible loss in lung function. Tell that to a mother whose asthmatic child has to stay home or visit the emergency room a regular basis. Tell that to a mother whose teenage son suffers from continuous coughing, throat irritations, chest pain, and shortness of breath. And what about the potential of causing permanent damage? We have studies of lab animals which indicate long-term exposure to ozone causes permanent damage to lungs. In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, thank you for this opportunity to have the floor to cast my strong disagreement with this bill. You've been very generous in giving me this time. I think we must work together to ensure that we don't turn back the clock on the progress we've already made, and I think we should move forward with the EPA's recommendation. Thank you very much. Senator Inhofe. Thank you, Senator Boxer. Senator Sessions. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JEFF SESSIONS, U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF ALABAMA Senator Sessions. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I really want to express my appreciation to you for your intensive interest in this important issue, and for coming forward with a positive solution to a situation I've become very troubled with. For the past 9 months, as a new member of this Senate and a new member of this committee, I have looked anxiously and waited anxiously to find a kind of scientific basis for the kind of significant regulations that we are--that EPA proposes to impose on America. I have not found those. Like you, I hear from the people in my State, from the business community, from the mayors in the State, from the county commissioners in the State, and from our Department of Environmental Management in our State. They have serious reservations and really objections to the proposals as they are. Your idea of giving more intensive scientific study is the right approach. There was not a witness that said we had the kind of complete data that they would like to have to make these important decisions. On February 5, for example, the Subcommittee on Clean Air held a hearing, and I questioned Dr. Schwartz, a member of the EPA's own Scientific Advisory Committee, the CASAC committee, about the Birmingham study--Birmingham, Alabama. Dr. Schwartz had conducted that, showing increased mortality on high particulate matter days. A subsequent peer-reviewed study using the exact same data as Dr. Schwartz' study showed that when humidity was a factor in the model, no statistically significant effect could be observed. I don't know the right scientific answer, but EPA admits relying on Dr. Schwartz' study as a basis for their new standards. It was previously mentioned how many lives would be lost. I have been very concerned, troubled, and really offended that use of numbers in what I would consider a promotional tactic that would create fear in America. EPA announced these standards in late 1996. They stated 40,000 lives could be saved by implementation of the particulate matter standards, 40,000. On February 12, the EPA Administrator appeared before the committee and testified that 20,000 deaths, \\1/2\\ of them, could be prevented by implementation of these standards. In April of this year, after an outside analyst discovered an error in the estimates, the agency again lowered its numbers to 15,000 premature deaths. Many of these are very elderly and in severe health conditions. In May the same analyst who first discovered the error in EPA's estimates found additional errors, which brought the estimates of premature deaths to under 1,000. These are not good numbers that we're dealing with. This is what you are looking forward to to answer, and I think we need to do that. The CASAC votes were split. If you add up the numbers--as I recall their votes, those numbers really totaled in opposition to the standards adopted by EPA if you added them up. Every vote was--virtually every vote was severely split. The cost of these standards will be extremely high. Our air is getting better. Why asthma attacks are going up we don't know, but ozone is going down. At a time when ozone is going down, asthma attacks are going up. You are very wise, I think, to do some research into why that health condition is occurring. I support this approach. I think it is a reasoned, modest, and moderate alternative to a proposal of the Environmental Protection Agency that I think is not justified, and I support you and appreciate the leadership of you and Senator Breaux and others who put this package together. Senator Inhofe. Thank you, Senator Sessions. I appreciate your attendance, too. This is the sixth hearing that we've had on this particular subject, and you've been here for all six. I appreciate that very much. Senator Baucus. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MAX BAUCUS, U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF MONTANA Senator Baucus. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I'd like to point out, first, it has been almost one year since the EPA released its proposal to strengthen the national ambient air quality standards for ozone and particulate matter, and since that time we've heard from just about everyone interested in this issue. You mentioned, Mr. Chairman, this subcommittee has had six hearings. I might say that both the House and the Senate together have held 24 hearings to examine the science, the economics, the health aspects of the new standards, and we listened to scientists, industry folks, farmers, ranchers, environmentalists, health professionals, State and local governments. And I might add, too, that in the end the EPA also listened, because the final standards that went into effect on September 18 were changed. They were changed from what EPA initially proposed. But, more importantly, EPA acknowledged the potential difficulties in implementing the new standards. As a result of our hearings and other comments, it is clear that the Agency is working hard to fashion a sensible approach to implementation. I don't think anyone can dispute that. Today we will hear about recently published research that supports EPA's decision to set new standards. We will learn about new technologies that will lower the cost of improving air quality. That's a familiar pattern. Air quality standards have always been met with claims of economic demise. But then technology catches up, innovative programs are implemented, further research bolsters the initial decision--and I might add, in our economy, the drive to improve the bottom line always results in ways to reduce costs. And in the end, costs are a fraction of the initial claims and everyone breathes cleaner air. That is exactly the case with the emissions trading system set up in the 1990 Clean Air Act. Compliance costs are now one- tenth initial estimates. That is not to say we should be making decisions without sufficient information. We need to continue the high-caliber research that has been a tradition of the United States. In fact, EPA's funding bill for fiscal year 1998 contains almost $50 million for particulate matter research, to the credit of Senators Bond and Mikulski, but I do not think we need this bill to authorize more research. Existing Clean Air Act already provides EPA with the authority it needs to conduct the necessary studies. What is much more troubling to me, though, is that S. 1084 would revoke the ozone and particulate matter standards that just became effective. Furthermore, it prohibits EPA from revising the standards for at least 4 years, even if new research uncovers additional health problems resulting from ozone or particulate matter air pollution. With all due respect to you, Mr. Chairman, and the sponsors of the bill, I think that's the wrong approach. Instead, I believe that we must continue to protect public health. Implementing the current standards is a fair and cost-effective manner, and a fair and cost-effective manner is the best way to achieve the goal. I hope we can work together in a bipartisan fashion to ensure that it's done right. And I want to underline that I think that all of us here do want to improve our air quality standards. They are good in this country. Mr. Chairman, I don't see very many Americans heading for the door to go live in other countries because their costs are so high in this country to comply or because of all the problems in this country. It's just the opposite. We need to learn about pollution of other countries. It's because those countries have not undertaken the immense effort that is required to try to find air quality standards to assure that people in those countries breathe clean air. They just don't do it. They don't because they just don't make the extra effort. We, in our country, have made an extra effort, and I think it's incumbent upon us not to take the easy way--which is to criticize--but, rather the hard and right way--which is to work together to do this right. Thank you. Senator Inhofe. Thank you, Senator Baucus. I now ask our witnesses to take their places at the table. And, while they're coming forward, as the Chair I'll give you an overview of how we'll proceed at this hearing. We do have a time constraint. We have to be out of the room at 11:30. It should not take the 2 hours. We have six witnesses who will be testifying today. I also mention that, while some of the members of the subcommittee are not here, they will be coming in and out and the staffs are here at this hearing, both majority and the monitory, who will be monitoring and reporting back to the members. The witnesses will be allocated 5 minutes to give an opening statement. There will be lights in front of you--red, yellow, green. I think we all know what that means. And we'd ask you to try to comply with those time limitations. Following the 5-minute comments by the witness, I will then ask any member of the subcommittee if they would like to ask questions. They will have a round of questions and answers. I think we're ready to begin. Let me just introduce all six in the order that they will be making presentations: Mr. James A. Martin is the vice president of Martin's Famous Pastry Shoppe, Inc., on behalf of the American Bakers Associate in Chambersburg, PA. In just a minute I will read a letter from Senator Santorum, who regretted he couldn't be here today. We'll have Mr. Adam Sharp, assistant director of governmental relations, regulatory affairs, American Farm Bureau Federation. Mr. Andy Abbott, assistant to the international president, the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Iron Ship Builders, Blacksmiths, forgers, and Helpers, in Fairfax, VA. Mr. Jason Grumet, executive director, Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management in Boston, MA. Dr. George Thurston--I welcome Dr. Thurston back. He has been here with us before--associate professor, Department of Environmental Medicine, New York University School of Medicine, New York. And Mr. Thomas Smith; president, National Coalition for Petroleum Retailers in Griffin, GA. We that, please allow me to call on Mr. James Martin to present his testimony. I will convey greetings from Senator Santorum. His letter states every nice thing that he could say about you, Mr. Martin, and he's very pleased that you are here today, and I'm sure he'll see you during your visit. Mr. Martin. STATEMENT OF JAMES A. MARTIN, VICE PRESIDENT, MARTIN'S FAMOUS PASTRY SHOPPE, INC., ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN BAKERS ASSOCIATION, CHAMBERSBURG, PENNSYLVANIA Mr. Martin. Good day, and thank you for the opportunity to be here. I am Jim Martin, an owner of Martin's Famous Pastry Shoppe, Inc. We have bakeries in Chambersburg and Shippensburg, Pennsylvania. Ours is a family business started in 1955 by my parents. Perhaps you've seen our Martin's famous potato rolls in our grocery store bread aisles. Today I'm speaking for myself and the members of the American Bakers Association. The American Bakers Association represents 80 percent of the wholesale baking business, which includes small businesses like ours and the companies with national brand names that you may know. Bakeries were captured by the Clean Air Act because the natural process of yeast fermentation used to make bread and rolls produces ethanol, an alcohol, which is considered volatile organic compound. Ethanol from bakeries is non-toxic, low reactive, probably eaten by the bacteria in the atmosphere. The American Bakers Association strongly supports Senate 1084. This bill will ensure that sound science and good planning have the time to develop before costly and potentially inappropriate controls area required. The baking by has already spent $28 million to comply with existing requirements. We estimate that the banking industry will spend $236 million to implement the new standard. The equipment to control bread aroma from a bakery costs about $500,000 to install and costs between $35,000 a year and $100,000 a year to operate. That's about $12,000 per ton of VOC controlled, not the $1,400 per ton estimated by the USEPA. The American Bakers Association has worked with the bakers in each State and with the State officials to develop reasonable rules to bring States and industry into compliance. The States have worked hard to implement the Clean Air Act under demanding and often changing EPA policies. We offer our compliments to Pennsylvania and many of the other States where hard work has put the most cost-effective control requirements in place. However, State officials are struggling to further reduce emissions and are being forced to look at smaller and smaller sources--that is, small businesses. Bakers are a low-volume, low-profit-margin business. Let me give an example how a small baker might be affected by control requirements. Imagine Joe's Bakery in your State. Joe is operating a white bread bakery he inherited from his father. The bakery has been in business for 80 years, with a profit margin of 1.7 percent. His bakery, like others, is labor intensive, providing jobs at relatively high pay rate and supporting many families in the neighborhood. No one is getting rich, but everyone is being paid and the local area has good, fresh-tasting bread. His potential of emissions trigger the control requirements. Joe goes to his bank and asks for a loan for the $500,000 to install controls and cut his profit margin by 24 percent. The bank denies his request, which is good business practice for the bank. If he can find a buyer, he can sell his bakery, or Joe can close. Sadly, some bakeries have closed during the implementation of the current standard. Now, let me share with you the situation at our bakeries. We emit enough ethanol to trigger control requirements. Stack testing, permitting, engineering reports, communications, and costs associated with investigating new technology have exceeded $250,000 to date in our bakeries. Our engineers calculate that adding a control device will increase our production energy consumption by 50 percent per package of rolls. However, rather than purchase the control equipment, we have chosen to limit our production and the growth of our business. This means our ability to serve the region with a maximum variety of product or to respond quickly to changes in consumer taste and demand is limited. That's not my understanding of free enterprise, and I have wondered, ``Is less bread on the table a good trade for no measurable improvement in air quality?'' I and the bakers I represent urge you to pass Senate 1084 to make clear legal statements about the funding of the research and science and timing of the implementation of the air quality standard. Please help us do the right thing to protect the air and the earth. Thank you for this opportunity to speak, and I'll answer any questions. Senator Inhofe. Thank you, Mr. Martin. Senator Inhofe. Mr. Sharp. STATEMENT OF ADAM SHARP, ASSISTANT DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENTAL RELATIONS, REGULATORY AFFAIRS, AMERICAN FARM BUREAU FEDERATION Mr. Sharp. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for this opportunity to provide testimony for this important hearing on S. 1084. I'm Adam Sharp, assistant director of governmental relations for the American Farm Bureau Federation here in Washington, D.C. I'm also a partner in my family's farm in southeastern Ohio where, along with my three brothers, my father, and my grandfather, I operate a dairy farm and diversified crop farm. Today I am representing the American Farm Bureau Federation, the Nation's largest general farm organization, with more than 4.7 million member families. The Farm Bureau supports Senate bill 1084 for many reasons, but foremost because it will allow the necessary time for the agricultural community and EPA to gain a more accurate understanding of agricultural emissions, how much we emit, and to what extent the air quality standards will impact our industry. My comments focus primarily on PM2.5 standard. There has been and continues to be a tremendous amount of conservation activity by farmers and ranchers across this country. These activities reduce wind erosion of the soil, which in turn provides cleaner air. Farmers are cleaning the air and should get credit for those activities; however, agriculture is concerned because EPA lacks actual measurements of what agriculture emits in the form of fine particulate. One estimate is that 34.3 percent of the primary fine particulate matter can be attributed to agriculture and forestry, and others suggest as low as 5 percent. EPA is finally acknowledging what we have been telling it: that agriculture is not a major emitter of this pollutant. However, nothing has been done to date to correct faulty documentation that over-estimates agricultural sources or solidifies Administrator Browner's promises that agriculture will not be impacted. The Administrator's promises have done little for our concerns because States decide who will be regulated, not her. I quote The Honorable Larry Combest, chairman of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Forestry, Natural resources, and conservation. He says--and we agree--that we don't have the research yet to know whether we can actually attain these standards, how much it will cost the agricultural industry and the consuming public, and how much agriculture activity actually contributes to air pollution problems. Let me focus on an actual situation farmers in California already face in regard to present PM10 serious nonattainment area for central and southern California. Agriculture in other areas of the country may face the same or similar situation when dealing with the new particulate matter PM2.5 standard. The emission inventory for agriculture used by EPA has proven to have many flaws for PM10. Inaccurate estimates of the number of times a farmer drives his tractor over a field is one major example--eight times for alfalfa, 13 times for rice, twice for rangeland. But probably the most blatant example of an inaccurate inventory was the initial emission inventory for combustion engines used to drive irrigation pumps. The original inventory estimated nitrogen oxide or NOX emissions, a precursor of PM, at 600 tons per day for all the pumps in the San Joaquin Valley. This would have been the highest emission category for NOX emissions in the valley, exceeding all the cars and trucks, which together only made about 300 tons per day. Driven by agricultural inquiries, a new study based on interviews with farmers determined that the NOX emissions for these pumps was only 32 tons per day--600 down to 32. We have only begun to address agriculture's concerns with PM10 measurements, many of which are still unaddressed and uncorrected. Considering these discrepancies, it is unimaginable that we are now again faced with the same problems, only this time with a smaller particulate matter. In attempting to resolve some of these agriculture emission issues surrounding PM10 and PM2.5, it became necessary to conduct a multi-year, multi-faceted air quality study, which is now underway in California. However, it will not be completed for roughly 5 years. S. 1084 would give agriculture the needed time to attain this important agriculture PM2.5 emissions data. I want to emphasize that this study is the first comprehensive study that actually measures instead of estimating agriculture's PM2.5 emissions. In order to avoid the mistakes made with PM10, the new PM standard should be delayed until this study and others like it are completed and before costly implementation activities begin. We fear that, despite guarantees, that implementation of this new standard may come quicker than what has been spelled out. In conclusion, I want to emphasize that the present approach of placing a new PM standard before having good scientific data for fine particulate sources may lead to false agriculture emission estimates again. Agriculture will also see a tremendous amount of indirect impacts from the new standards. Targeted industries such as utilities, fuel, transportation, chemicals, equipment, and many more will pass their costs on to their users. One of those is agriculture. In a study by AUS consultants to be released soon, the net cash income for all farmers is projected to fall by 10 percent, or $5 billion annually over the first 6 years of implementation of these new standards. Those are simply indirect impacts. Those are not even direct. The agriculture community enjoys breathing clean air as much as anybody. This committee must continue to demand that the concerns of America's farmers and ranchers are addressed by the EPA in order to ensure a continued safe, abundant, healthy, and affordable food supply. Thank you. Senator Inhofe. Thank you, Mr. Sharp. Senator Inhofe. Mr. Abbott. STATEMENT OF ANDE ABBOTT, ASSISTANT TO THE INTERNATIONAL PRESIDENT, THE INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF BOILERMAKERS, IRON SHIP BUILDERS, BLACKSMITHS, FORGERS, & HELPERS, FAIRFAX, VIRGINIA Mr. Abbott. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. I have to apologize up front. I came down with a serious cold yesterday afternoon. With your permission, sir, I'd like to just enter my statement into the record and just make a very short verbal---- Senator Inhofe. Yes. All your statement will be entered into the record in its entirety, and you can make any length of statement you'd like, Mr. Abbott. Mr. Abbott. Thank you very much, Senator. The International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, along with all the other building trades unions, as well as the Mine Workers Union and many of the other unions, had been very supportive of the Clean Air Act when it was up for consideration back years ago. We understood that there was going to be an initial cost, we understood that there were going to be industries that were going to be economically hurt, and we knew that there were going to be some jobs at stake. But, overall, providing clean air to the United States was very important to our agenda. We all felt that for our generation and all generations to come, that clean air was necessary. Mr. Chairman, we met with EPA earlier this year to discuss these new clean air standards, I guess I can tell you that the 21 or 22 people that were involved from the labor unions were really quite stunned by what we discovered from EPA. Their inability to answer questions and how easily some of their assumptions were being successfully challenged--EPA initially used the 60,000 premature death figure, and I said, ``Wait a minute. If you're talking about asthma''--and, Mr. Chairman, I'm an asthmatic, myself-- ``I know that you could shut down every combustible, every manufactured source of pollution in the United States, and you would still have people with asthma and you would still have some people dying of asthma.'' Other people are even allergic to the sun, and I don't know what you can do about some of these. When you have a background from nature, I just don't know what EPA is going to do about controlling that. But when I asked EPA about, ``When you made these studies for the PM standard down to 2.5,'' I said, ``did you actually analyze the content of these materials?'' They said no, that they hadn't really analyzed them, they had no idea what it was. I said, ``Well, would it be safe to say that most of it was from nature?'' and they said yes. I become very concerned about that, especially when we start looking at some of the coastal states, as an example, California, the Gulf coast, Oregon, Washington, where you have salt that is just naturally in the air, and all of this starts getting counted against the PM standards, and all of that is going to be registering on monitors. I mean, 2.5 microns is very, very small, and I don't know of any pollen in nature that is smaller than that. Almost everything is larger. As a result of that, it has been projected that there will be over 800 additional counties that will be in noncompliance. So we asked the question, ``Well, what happens if you have an area that is continually not in compliance?'' EPA said, ``Well, we're going to shut down heavy construction projects, we're going to stop mowing the gas, we're going to end barbecues. We're going to keep people from burning stuff in their fireplaces.'' And then they volunteered, well, in some areas--you've got the airline industry in Los Angeles and San Francisco that's putting hundreds of millions of tons of pollution in the air every day on takeoff and landings of airplanes I said, ``Well, what are you going to do about that?'' They just shook their head. They've got no answer for it at all. Mr. Chairman, there were just so many things as we were going through this that they could not answer even a little bit of it, and I was, frankly, stunned. In dealing with EPA in the past, when we were dealing with the Clean Air Act and the amendments to the Clean Air Act in 1990, there was no hesitation. Things made sense. You would go through. There seemed to be substance to what they were saying, and when you began to challenge them with any amount of logic in the past they were able to answer it. With these standards, there is absolutely nothing that we found that we could support in these standards. We just feel that, with the effect that this is going to have on employment, and especially since they're talking about expanding NAFTA and everything else, that, among other things, this is just going to drive more businesses out of the United States. It's hard to estimate anything. I mean, you throw out the numbers of jobs lost. Some people have estimated it will be over 1.3 million jobs. Some have estimated higher. A few have estimated lower. But, in any case, I just don't think that we should be going forward with any standards unless they can meet somewhat of a logic test and meet somewhat of a scientific study, scientific scrutiny. In dealing with the EPA and the issues that they brought up and the answers that they gave, Senator, we were very, very disappointed. I thank you very much, sir. Senator Inhofe. Thank you, Mr. Abbott. Senator Inhofe. We've been joined by Senator Thomas from Wyoming. Senator Thomas, we've heard from Mr. Martin, who has a small bakery and is in the bakery industry; and, of course, Mr. Sharp with the Farm Bureau you've met before; and Mr. Abbott with Boilermakers. Do you have an opening statement you'd like to offer. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. CRAIG THOMAS, U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF WYOMING Senator Thomas. I would like to submit it for the record, but please proceed with this hearing. Senator Inhofe. All right. [The prepared statement of Senator Thomas follows:] Prepared Statement of Hon. Craig Thomas, U.S. Senator from the State of Wyoming Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this hearing today to discuss S. 1084, the ``Ozone and Particulate Matter Research Act of 1997.'' This is important legislation and I want to compliment you, and Senator Breaux, for the leadership you have taken in pursuing enactment of this initiative. As most are aware, great uncertainty surrounds the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) rule to tighten National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter and ozone. Since the committee first held hearings on this issue, scientists--including those on the EPA's own Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC)--have testified that the court-ordered deadline did not allow enough time for them to adequately examine the rule. We also heard testimony that more time was needed to conduct additional research. However, these efforts were thwarted when President Clinton endorsed the standards on July 18, 1997. This was in spite of the fact that more than 250 members of Congress, 27 Governors, labor groups, the agncultural community and the National Conference of Mayors expressed opposition to the new regulations. Even several of President Clinton's agencies have expressed serious doubt. According to the U.S. Small Business Administration, the EPA's regulation ``is certainly one of the most expensive regulations, if not the most expensive regulation faced by small businesses in 10 or more years.'' The Department of Agriculture stated that ``farm groups have expressed concern that the proposed standards may impose significant costs on farmers and agribusiness.'' The Department of Energy encouraged the EPA to ``retain the current primary ozone standard,'' and the Department of the Treasury believes ``that many areas cannot achieve the new fine particle standard.'' It's clear, Mr. Chairman, that the scientific evidence for these new standards is not complete. Under your proposal, an independent panel would be organized by the National Academy of Sciences to prioritize research needs on the health effects of particulate matter. It's my understanding that the EPA would be required to establish PM monitoring programs through state grants, and a Particulate Matter Interagency Committee would be established to coordinate the activities of federal agencies involved in fine particle research. With regard to ozone, S. 1084 takes the necessary steps to further research programs looking at the adverse health effects of ground-level smog-- especially in urban areas. I'm also encouraged that the bill authorizes adequate funding levels to carry out these research needs for the next 5 fiscal years. This is good legislation; I am pleased to be a cosponsor, and willing to help Senator Inhofe and others pass S. 1084 this year. Let me say, however, that placing a 4-year moratorium on the EPA's regulations does not mean we are against a clean environment. We need to continue to look for ways to improve and protect public health, but this must be achieved in a balanced manner. Many uncertainties remain, including the fact that a large number of areas are having trouble meeting current Clean Air Act standards and may never reach attainment with the adoption of these new regulations. Furthermore, the costs will be extreme and we need to make sure this initiative will be worth the enormous price that businesses and individuals will have to bear. I do not believe we should be heading down a regulatory road before additional research is conducted so we truly know which pollutants are causing adverse health effects. We have a diverse panel before us today, Mr. Chairman, and I look forward to their testimony. Thanks again for your leadership and willingness to make the EPA come to the snubbing post and justify their actions. Senator Inhofe. All right. Mr. Grumet, you're recognized. STATEMENT OF JASON GRUMET, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, NORTHEAST STATES FOR COORDINATED AIR USE MANAGEMENT (NESCAUM) BOSTON, MA Mr. Grumet. Thank you very much. My name is Jason Grumet, and I'm the executive director of the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management, or NESCAUM, which for the last 30 years has been representing the six New England States, New York, and New Jersey in their efforts to achieve air pollution standards. On behalf of my colleagues, who spend each and every day trying to implement the Federal air quality standards, I appreciate the opportunity to join you here today. I'm going to try to continue Mr. Abbott's thoughts about logic for a moment. We reach a different conclusion. The northeast States strongly support the new air quality standards because we believe they represent a more rational, logical, and accurate physical reality of the problems that we are trying to address. We think, moreover, these standards are long overdue, and therefore we are opposed to S. 1084 and any other effort, for that matter, which would shackle our programs to 20-year- old science. What I'd like to do to help you understand this is really touch on three issues: one, Government's responsibility to provide the public with accurate information; second, cost-- something that we're all concerned about; and, third, equity, an issue of particular concern to the northeast. But, just to get started, I need to say a few things about the standards. The standards do many things. One of the most important things, from our point of view, that the standards do is they provide a blueprint, essentially a road map for how we can design our air quality programs. Anyone who has ever been on a country road on a dark night with a 20-year-old road map will have some sense of what we think these new standards do for us right now. They give us a general direction, but they don't get us from here to there in the quickest, most rational way possible, and I'd like to try to explain why. They're 20 years old. They're based on our scientific understanding of the ozone problem derived largely from the Los Angeles air basin in the 1970's. They tell us that air pollution is a local problem. Well, we now know it's a regional problem, stretching hundreds of miles across many States. They tell us that our concern should be for peak ozone levels and one-hour violations. We now know that air pollution is a multi- day problem, and the health effects are chronic over several hours at a time. The old standard also focuses towards VOC controls, the kind of controls that Mr. Martin was complaining about being very expensive. Well, we now know, since the National Academy study about 5 years ago, that the real problem is NOX pollution, which, fortunately, is much more cost-effective to control. So we have a situation in which we are being given a road map which does not, in fact, diagnose the problem. In 1970, when these standards were adopted, they were fairly called a ``partial diagnosis.'' Carrying the medical analogy forward, since we think we do public health work, the 1970 standards right now, frankly, represent air pollution malpractice, and the suggestion that we should go back to those standards deprives us of tools that will help us achieve air quality in a cost-effective manner. I'd like to now turn quickly to public information. And I'm going to ask if you have it to take a peak at attachment A which I included in my testimony. We believe government has a fundamental responsibility to provide people with accurate information, and one of the most important things the standards do is just that. The map that I included is a map that shows the highest daily ozone levels every single day for five summers--from 1991 to 1995. It's a depiction of chronic exposure to ozone. Many critics of the standards have told us there's no threshold beneath which people are safe. Well, what this map shows you is that there are dramatic health effects in States right now which are deemed attainment. Massachusetts, where I'm proud to live, is deemed a serious ozone non-attainment area, yet the chronic ozone exposure in Massachusetts is far less than the ozone exposure in Virginia, West Virginia, Ohio, Illinois--States that are now told that they are in attainment. I suggest to you that this is misleading tens of millions of Americans into believing that they, in fact, are not facing any risks from air pollution. And to go back to that standard I think would be a grave mistake. I want to focus for a moment on cost, because this is something that we all spend a great deal of time thinking about. We have heard and Senator Baucus indicated that the worst case dire projections, the fears of economic ruin that have accompanied every air quality regulation to date have not been realized. We posit the same will happen here. Simply put, the new standards focus us on nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions. These are emissions which come from two main sources--heavy-duty diesel vehicles and utilities. These are some of the most cost-effective control options available today. We can achieve the utility controls we want without adding more than 1 or 2 percent to the residential electric bill, and, since heavy-duty vehicles have yet to be regulated, we also believe there are very cost-effective measures there, as well. The reason that costs are continuously overstated is really three-fold: we have worst-case projections, understandably, by concerned industries; we have a failure to take account for competition; and a failure to account for innovation. If you look at attachment C, which I won't go into, you'll see that in each and every instance utilities--gasoline, automobiles--the costs are dramatically overstated. There's only one dynamic that will stop this innovation from bringing these costs down in the future, and that dynamic is uncertainty and delay, and it's our fear that that would be the result if S. 1084 became law. Let me just end by talking about equity for a moment. Unsurprisingly, the areas with the highest chronic exposure to ozone also have the highest utility NOX emissions. If you look at attachment B, you will note that all the States listed have more NOX emissions from their utilities than all eight northeast States combined. One of the reasons for this is that the old standards have mislead these communities, these political leaders, and these residents to believe that they don't have a problem. They have had no self-interested incentive to reduce their pollution. And we have found that altruism, alone, has not gotten the job done. We believe that the new standards will provide people with good, accurate information, and with that information the political leaders and the residents of the midwest and the southeast will take the same self-interested rational actions we have to cost-effectively reduce our emissions. So, in conclusion, we think the new standards provide better information. We think they will provide more cost- effective approaches and more-equitable approaches to air pollution problems, and for those reasons we support them. Senator Inhofe. Thank you, Mr. Grumet. Dr. Thurston, welcome back. STATEMENT OF GEORGE D. THURSTON, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE, NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, NEW YORK, NEW YORK Mr. Thurston. Thank you. I am George Thurston, a tenured associate professor of environmental medicine at New York University School of Medicine. My scientific research involves investigations of the human health effects of air pollution. I'm also the director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences' Community Outreach and Education program at NYU. A goal of this program is to provide an impartial scientific resource on environmental healthy issues to decision-makers, and that's my purpose in testifying to you here today. I must take issue with much of the intent of S. 1084 and with the findings upon which it is based. First, the new ozone standard will not disrupt or delay ozone reductions, as implied by finding four. Instead, it is S. 1084 that would increase uncertainty in the marketplace and by regulators, thereby slowing air quality progress. Second, findings five and six fail to acknowledge that CASAC reached a consensus that a PM2.5 standard is needed and that the ozone standard should be changed to an eight-hour basis, both of which the EPA promulgated on July 18, 1997. I really would like to take issue with Senator Sessions' statement that there were lots of differences of opinion on the committee, on all these issues, and that their CASAC vote was split. I can show you the quote from the closure letter saying that there was a consensus by CASAC on these two points--the need for the PM2.5 and the need for an eight-hour ozone standard, as the new standards reflect. The revocation of these new standards called for in bill S. 1084 would be unwise and would be inconsistent with the intent of the Clean Air Act. Moreover, bill S. 1084 wrongly seeks to fundamentally rewrite the Clean Air Act by restructuring who decides whether new standards are needed. The existing Clean Air Act requires that EPA review the standards every 5 years and then leaves that standard-setting decision to the Administrator with advice from CASAC. Bill S. 1084, in contrast, seeks to shift that power to Congress by imposing a change back to the old ozone and PM standards. To my knowledge, this would be the first time that the Congress has intervened to interfere with air quality standards set by the EPA. The bill also says that the next science review of these standards may not occur any earlier than 4 years from now, but sets no requirement for the latest that these reviews may occur, which could possibly be interpreted as eliminating the Clean Air Act requirement for every-5-year reviews of these pollutants. These changes would represent a dramatic and unacceptable change in the Clean Air Act. The newly promulgated EPA air quality standards for ozone and particulate matter are based on sound science and need to be retained if the public's health is to be adequately protected. The adverse health consequences of breathing ozone or PM are serious and well-documented, even at levels below the US national ambient air quality standards that were in effect before July of 1997. This documentation includes impacts demonstrated by controlled chamber experiments and by observational epidemiology showing consistent associations between each of these pollutants and adverse impacts across a wide range of human health outcomes. These adverse impacts include: decreased lung function, a measure of our ability to breathe freely; more frequent respiratory symptoms; increased numbers of asthma attacks; more frequent emergency department visits; additional hospital admissions; and increased numbers of daily deaths. In previous Congressional hearings, much discussion has centered on New York City hospital admissions effects, but the adverse impacts on hospital admissions are only the tip of the iceberg of adverse effects associated with PM and ozone pollution. Indeed, in my testimony and in this table figure that's included in my testimony, I show that hospital admissions account for only approximately .01 percent of all ozone-induced adverse health impacts in New York City. Also, while there are about seven million persons in New York City, there are a total of some 122 million persons throughout the U.S. who now live in areas exceeding the ozone standard and will, therefore, also be benefitted by that new standard. Thus, the New York City hospital admissions effects are best viewed as an indicator of a much broader spectrum of potentially avoidable adverse health effects being experienced by the public today as a result of air pollution exposures. The scientific evidence that has been published since the PM and ozone criteria documents were written is consistent with a need for the immediate implementation of the more stringent standards that the EPA promulgated. Indeed, while the exact causal mechanism--i.e., the smoking gun of the PM mortality association--is not yet known, there are biologically plausible mechanisms that are now known--and these weren't available and weren't included in the criteria document--that could account for the associations. For example, recent animal experiments by Godleski and coworkers at Harvard University confirmed that exposures to elevated concentrations of ambient PM can result in cardiac-related deaths in animals. Epidemiological evidence has also accumulated over recent years, indicating a role by ozone in daily human mortality, a fact not fully considered by the EPA. I've attached a list of over 20 studies showing associations between ozone and mortality which were not considered. Thus, it is more clear than ever that important reductions in public health risk can be achieved by rapidly implementing the standards recently promulgated by the EPA. They for this opportunity to testify. Senator Inhofe. Thank you, Dr. Thurston. Mr. Smith. STATEMENT OF THOMAS SMITH, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL COALITION OF PETROLEUM RETAILERS, GRIFFIN, GEORGIA; ACCOMPANIED BY: JIM DASKEL, GENERAL COUNSEL, NATIONAL COALITION OF PETROLEUM RETAILERS Mr. Smith. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm Tom Smith, president of NCPR, the chief advocate of the interests of America's 45,000 mom and pop gasoline retailers across America, and a Texaco dealer from Griffin, Georgia. And with me is our counsel, Jim Daskel. NCPR strongly supports Senate 1084, the Ozone and Particulate Matter Research Act, and we want to make three major points in our testimony today. First, a claim that there is no need for the legislation because the compliance deadlines are well off in the future is misleading. Without Senate 1084, compliance schedules would be dictated by citizen suits and sanction threats, because the Clean Air Act mandates that the states adopt a number of control technologies. Second, EPA's claims of a flexible implementation process are undercut by the statutory mandates and, more importantly, by EPA's actions with respect to vehicle IM and SBREFA. EPA hurts its credibility with statements such as telling the Agriculture Committee that the standards will lead to more ethanol fuel sales. EPA tried to rewrite the Clean Air Act to mandate ethanol before and got shot down by the court of appeals. Our third point is that we need Senate 1084 to ensure that we do not rob Peter to pay Paul. If you do not pass Senate bill 1084, our members' limited resources would be diverted from compliance with the 1998 underground tank regulatory deadline, where they would most benefit human health and the environment, into ineffective redundancies like stage two vapor recovery. Let me first talk about the idea that there is no need for the legislation because the compliance deadlines are well off into the future. Once an area becomes a nonattainment area, the Clean Air Act forces the States and our members to implement control strategies such as stage two, enhanced IM, and the sale of reformulated gasolines. These mandatory control strategies can be enforced by citizen suits and other threats which will inevitably occur well before the date EPA is talking about. States will be forced to act now if the legislation is not passed. The threat is so severe that NCPR has had to file suit against EPA, alleging that the provisions of the Clean Air Act that mandate certain control strategies are unconstitutional under the 10th Amendment and a 1997 Supreme Court decision. Though EPA has promised to be flexible, this statute ties their hands. Based on our experience in the motor vehicle/IM debate, our members have deep-seeded reservations over EPA's flexibility promise. To quote Georgia State Representative Mike Evans, testifying under oath before the House Commerce Committee in the 104th Congress, he stated, ``EPA's assertion that they have been flexible is simply not so. We have not seen it in Georgia, nor do we believe that other States have seen it, either. The only thing that we have heard is sanctions, sanctions, and sanctions. We also question the flexibility claim in light of EPA's absurd position that changing the standard does not implicate SBREFA. The EPA says we will not hurt small businesses and farmers, such as those in my family. EPA has a funny definition of the word ``hurt.'' My family members and farm-based customers do not buy the EPA line and are concerned that higher fuel prices and regulatory costs will squeeze already thin farm margins. I also do not see how EPA can make the claim that the standards would mean more use of ethanol-blended gasolines with a straight face. Ethanol cannot be used in many nonattainment areas because it will hurt or worsen the ozone problems. Let me add that the ethanol subsidy is destructive to competition in the gasoline industry, and any version of a highway bill that extends the ethanol subsidy for another 7 years to us is just poisoned tea and would force us to oppose the entire bill, though we support CMAQ funding. As very small locally owned and operated businesses, gasoline dealers' limited resources must be used in a way so as to achieve the maximum environmental bang for their buck. Our members need to spend money on the underground tank upgrades required by 1998 in order to protect groundwater. Due to the requirements of the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act, many stations and their tanks will be sold to small dealers and have to be replaced in the next 15 months. Gasoline dealers have long been involved in the debate over the clean air, primarily because the dealer and his family, as well as our employees and their families, breathe the same air and drink the same water as our friends and neighbors do. We support the 1990 Clean Air Act as amended, even though they cost us at least 15 percent of the independent dealer stations. We cannot support the new standards and urge the passage of Senate 1084. Thank you. Senator Inhofe. Thank you very much, Mr. Smith. We'll have some 5-minute rounds up here, and we will adhere to our time schedule so that we can have as many rounds as possible within the time limit that we have, and we'll have some other Members that are coming here shortly. Mr. Martin, I'll start with you. In your testimony you offer two very profound examples on impact of the air standards on small, family-owned bakeries. First is the inability to secure loans to get their equipment, the control equipment; and then your own example, where you've literally decreased production so that you don't trigger the control levels. You know, neither example helps your businesses or the supply of bread--to me, at least. It doesn't seem efficient to force companies to cut production. If the regulations were to continue in effect, as promulgated by this association, what do you think would happen to your industry? What is the--can you give us idea of what a profit margin is of a small bakery. Mr. Martin. I think, within our own experience, it would probably range from--just looking at a 10- to 15-year period-- from probably a small percentage loss to a high of maybe 3 to 4 percent. Senator Inhofe. Yes. How do you think these regulations would impact that. Mr. Martin. I guess it would depend. If you want to put it on a percentage, we know up front we're going to spend the 500,000 at least to make building modifications and put the technology in which we have gone and looked on site and have promised with the way it would apply to our industry, and then for the extra cost of operation it would be another 100,000 a year, probably. Senator Inhofe. Mr. Grumet had said that the industry normally over-estimates the cost of compliance. In your testimony you stated the cost to bakers is $12,000 per ton of DOCs controlled, not the 1,400 per ton estimated by EPA. Who is right, you or the EPA. Mr. Martin. Well, I can understand where they came up with some of those numbers, although I was not particularly a part of it. I asked some of those questions, myself, and, simply, the $1,400 would be taken from the handful of a certain type of baking operation, the 12,000 would be looking at the overview of all bakeries of many different sizes and shapes and forms. Senator Inhofe. You know, it is a difficult thing--and I think that Senator Sessions touched on this--that the original estimate of the cost of compliance by the EPA was--in fact, the one they're still using--is $8 billion. The President's own Economic Council used $60 billion per year. And the Reason Foundation out in California--I think came out with theirs right before our last hearing--they estimated somewhere between $90 and $150 billion per year. So it's difficult to use these estimates in any logical sense. Mr. Sharp, I was particularly impressed with your testimony because I spent quite a bit of time talking to farm bureau groups last Monday night. I was their speaker at the banquet in Cherokee, Oklahoma. That was a regional group. Not long before that I was up in North Dakota at the North Dakota Farm Bureau. A very consistent thing comes out of these guys. They say that the biggest problem they have is over-regulation, and that they don't recall any time, including the BTU scare, that the over-regulation would be a greater problem to the small farmers. Do you agree with that? Is this what you hear out there. Mr. Sharp. Absolutely. Small- and average-sized farms obviously are the ones that would suffer the most under regulation as is and under new regulation. Even USDA came out in their comments with concerns for small- and average-sized farms under this standard and, of course, under other regulation. Senator Inhofe. I understand that there is a copy of the economic report on the impacts of these regulations on agriculture. I think it is just coming out today. The results of these are pretty dramatic. Have you had a chance to see that. Mr. Sharp. I mentioned in my testimony the numbers that we've seen. This is the first study that we have seen that has come out with any numbers on agriculture impacts from the new standard, and a 10 percent decrease or a $5 billion annual income loss to farmers is something that is going to knock you way below any small- or average-sized farm profitability margin. When you only deal with a few percent anyway, a drop of 10 percent is quite dramatic for those folks in the average or small farm arena. Senator Inhofe. Yes. Mr. Abbott, I was interested in some of your comments as to the effect on jobs. I was one who was very much concerned back when NAFTA was first imposed what would happen. If you go industry-by-industry--I'm from Oklahoma. Of course, it's a big agriculture State. Also, we have a refinery industry. I was listening with some interest to Senator Dorgan, when he was talking about the loss of jobs that has come, the fight from across the border. And I'd kind of like to get your idea as to what you think that job loss would be. You mention an estimated 35,000 jobs, but is that just within your union or your particular--how would you broaden this to cover other jobs. Mr. Abbott. Yes, sir. Just within our small union--and the number, I think, that the building trades department of the AFL-CIO is using is 1.3 million amongst all the crafts and trades. That loss comes because of a lot of different factors. We not only construct, but we maintain a lot of the refineries, and the large power plants, as well as cement kilns. One of the things that happened with the Clean Air Act last time, there was a lot of the refinery business that moved into the Caribbean region, they actually moved off-shore. Very few refineries are actually left in the United States, which really is a problem. But, of course, if you had maybe 8,000 or 10,000 people nationwide, like the boilermakers did, that was maintaining those refineries, those are just jobs lost. That's just man-years of work lost. Senator Inhofe. I'll cover that in just a minute. Senator Baucus. Senator Baucus. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Grumet, I'm very interested in this chart of yours in your testimony that's labeled ``C.'' It's entitled, ``Actual Costs are Less than Original Estimates.'' Mr. Grumet. Yes. What I tried to do---- Senator Baucus. I can tell what you tried to do here, and I find it very interesting that you've taken five different areas and you've given the projected costs for each and the actual costs and you've given a source, and the source is essentially industry sources. Now, is that industry source the source for the projected cost? And does that source actually agree with the actual costs in each of those areas. Let's take number one, unleaded gasoline. Mr. Grumet. Unleaded gasoline, the suggestion at the time of enactment by API and others was it would be eight to ten cents per gallon. The actual cost, based on surveys by the Energy Information Association and others, has been one cent nationally and two cents in California. And I should just add that these aren't the costs that people are seeing. People are seeing no cost whatsoever. What we've tried to do here is be absolutely accurate and indicate the costs that the---- Senator Baucus. But the point is here that the actual cost of unleaded gasoline is about one-eight or one-seventh of the projected cost. Mr. Grumet. That's correct. Senator Baucus. Let's take VOC controls for marine vessel boating. Why don't you explain that. Mr. Grumet. This was a nice example in that this was a very particular issue in New Jersey. We had the industry testify at a public hearing that the cost would be, at minimum, two cents per gallon, based on the controls. New Jersey's penalty structure is based on the notion of disgorging any undue economic benefit a company gets from noncompliance. So it turns out that one of these Company's failed to comply, and in the penalty phase they demonstrated conclusively to the State that the actual costs were, in fact, one-tenth of the costs they suggested 2 years earlier. Senator Baucus. One-tenth of the projected. Mr. Grumet. Yes. Senator Baucus. All right. Let's take power plant SO2 controls. Mr. Grumet. Well, this is an example that I think many people refer to, the acid rain controls in the 1990 Clean Air Act. Again, I think we were somewhat conservative. There were many industry estimates that the cost for a tons of SO2 removed would be over $1,500 a ton. But, looking at really just kind of the basic industry projections--because what I think I want to stress here is that this isn't an effort, I think, on the part of industry to mislead anybody. Senator Baucus. Right. Mr. Grumet. I just think there are some natural dynamics-- -- Senator Baucus. Right. Mr. Grumet. ----that inevitably inflate cost. The costs were projected to be $500 to $1,000, and recently the costs were $101. They're down actually to $75. Senator Baucus. And the same general phenomenon occurred with respect to power plant NOX controls. Mr. Grumet. Yes. Absolutely same with NOX controls. Senator Baucus. And the California low emission vehicle program. Mr. Grumet. That's correct. Senator Baucus. I just saw something on the news last night. I don't know if you saw it. It's a combination fuel cell gasoline, which looked pretty promising. I don't know if it's going to turn out to be as good as it sounds like it's projected to be, but, as I recall, I think it was on ABC news last night. Mr. Grumet. Daimler-Benz has committed to have 100,000 fuel cell operated vehicles on the road in the next 10 years. The Ballard Company in Canada is producing buses that run on fuel cells right now. What's unfortunate is that there is no one in the U.S. doing it. Senator Baucus. But I understand this car uses a combination of regular gasoline and fuel cells. Mr. Grumet. Correct. Senator Baucus. And it will be available in 5 or 6 years maybe, or maybe sooner than that; that it will cost no more to operate than current cars; it would have the same performance; and it will have virtually none of certain emissions. I suppose it would be---- Mr. Grumet. The only emissions would be some CO2 and some water. Senator Baucus. CO2 and water. But no other emissions. Mr. Grumet. Correct. Senator Baucus. Now that would help with ozone, wouldn't it. Mr. Grumet. That would be a dramatic advantage. Yes. Senator Baucus. And so maybe these ozone standards might not turn out to be quite so bad to the degree that those technologies are developed, when there is no additional cost. Mr. Grumet. We have found time and time again that many of the gentlemen to my left and right and their industries are incredibly capable of achieving cost-effective reductions when, in fact, we set clear requirements and stick to those requirements. Senator Baucus. Yes. Well, are there other technologies that might develop. Mr. Grumet. There are a host of technologies. Just to touch on a couple that are pertinent to these new standards, as I mentioned, the main requirement would be to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions, which would come as some comfort to Mr. Martin because bakers really don't emit much NOX emissions, if any. In order to get NOX emissions down, there are two technologies that people are using. One is selective catalytic reduction. It's like taking the catalytic converter you have in a car and putting it on a big smokestack. For years we were told that it wasn't possible, even though it was happening in Europe. Well, now it has happened in two of my States, New Hampshire and New Jersey, and it has happened incredibly cost-effectively. We are able to achieve up to 90 percent controls of nitrogen oxide emissions for under $1,000 a ton, and that is, as Mr. Martin indicated, far and away more cost effective than the control strategies that the old standards were bringing forward. I don't know how many more you want me to touch on, but we have--Honda just announced the ultra-low-emission vehicle for the exact same cost as a regular vehicle. People said it couldn't even be done 4 years ago. Senator Baucus. And one of the reasons this happens, as you mentioned, is competition. Mr. Grumet. Absolutely. Senator Baucus. Different companies want to develop a better product--cheaper, more-efficient product. It's just competition. Mr. Grumet. That's the American way. And the ``New York Times'' last Friday had an article showing that, in fact, pollution control companies had stagnated their sales. Their sales have actually gone down since 1985, showing that, in fact, we're really not pushing our industrial base to improve our environmental quality. Senator Baucus. Thank you. I see I've got a red light here, Mr. Chairman. Senator Inhofe. Well, we'll have more rounds, Senator Baucus. Senator Thomas. Senator Thomas. Yes. As I listened to you, Mr. Grumet, if competition is driven by more efficiency, then why do we need regulation. Mr. Grumet. Well, pollution, in my micro-economics class-- and I wasn't very good--was the example that was used to describe market failure. When we have a situation---- Senator Thomas. I don't think that's true. We're talking about efficiency and cost is mostly why these new things come about, not---- Mr. Grumet. Well, Senator Thomas, I may not understand, but I think it's very possible for a company to have very low costs while creating a tremendous amount of pollution, which inposes high costs on other people, but---- Senator Thomas. I won't pursue it any farther, but if you're talking about competition and efficiency driving these things, that's what drives it, and not the setting by EPA of standards. Senator Baucus. If I might say, Mr. Chairman, the point is to internalize the cost, and therefore the competition drives the technology. You have to have standards to internalize the cost. Senator Thomas. Senator Baucus, I was questioning them, but thank you very much. I certainly appreciate it. I'm talking about efficiency, and we get efficient---- Senator Baucus. If they internalize it, they get some efficiencies. Senator Thomas. Absolutely, and it doesn't take regulation if you believe in the marketplace. That's an aside. Doctor, you sort of indicated that there was great scientific consensus. You're the first one I've heard say that. Mr. Thurston. Well, the points of consensus of CASAC have been under-represented in hearings here, I think, and I think especially George Wolfe, when he talks about what happened at CASAC, he tends to dwell on the points of lack of consensus. But I feel that more emphasis should be put on where there was a consensus, and I think that's where EPA acted. There was a consensus, and I can read you right out of George Wolfe's closure letter where they said that there was a consensus--let's see. Here's one. ``There was also a consensus that a new PM2.5 NAAQS be established.'' It's right out of his closure letter. And, similarly, for ozone. Senator Thomas. Well, wait a minute. You may have this group consensus. I'm talking about science, in general. You know, one of the real problems for us--and you can understand this--is on all these things, ``Let's have a scientific basis.'' ``Let's do it on good science.'' We have ten scientists come, and all of them have a different view. Now, how many of this consensus group agreed on 15 micrograms daily. Mr. Thurston. There was a consensus to have a standard. They didn't attempt to set the actual standard. That was left to the Administrator. They---- Senator Thomas. Only two out of twenty-one agreed with the initial proposition. Mr. Thurston. I think that what happened, if you read the transcript of the day that they talked about this, as I have, George Wolff simply asked them where they would set it, and each person gave a number, and I think that had they perhaps gone around the table again you would have seen a little more consensus. But the fact of the matter is there was a large agreement--there was a consensus that they needed a PM2.5 standard, and the way it reads is that EPA sets the standard. Their job wasn't to come to a specific number. As a matter of fact, I think George Wolff was the first chairman who has done such a poll asking for a number, because I don't think it is the job of CASAC to set a number. That's the Administrator's job, and that's exactly what the Administrator did. Senator Thomas. Exactly, and not many scientists agree with that. That's the problem. And I understand science isn't always going to come the same, but to suggest that there is consensus among science I think is a little misleading. That certainly hasn't been what we've heard from everyone who has come here. Also, you've talked about the costs will not be substantial, and I don't know what ``substantial'' means. Small Business Administration says, ``It is certainly one of the most expensive regulations, if not the most expensive, faced by small business in 10 years or more.'' Mr. Thurston. I don't believe I said that---- Senator Thomas. No, I'm talking to Mr. Grumet. I'm sorry. Mr. Grumet. Thanks. Senator Thomas. Small Business. This is the government agency. Mr. Grumet. Yes, I agree. Government is also not immune from overstating costs--EPA does it all the time--because all Government can do is use the best information that they are given by the same people who are providing you this information. I think, though, that you also know that there are very often times tensions in any large organization--the Administration being a very large one--and EPA is going to great ends to try to diminish the impacts on small businesses. We care very deeply about small businesses in the northeast. We are not apologists for EPA. We have many conflicts with them. We are of the belief that these standards, because they reflect the true science, will, in fact, bring forward--now, when I say ``science'' I'm not talking health science, because---- Senator Thomas. True science. Mr. Grumet. Well, Senator, let me back up for a second. These standards are not perfect, but there's a choice before us that is presented by S. 1084, and that choice is between the old standards or the new standards. And if you ask yourself which standards better reflect the health costs and the health impacts, which standards better reflect the true reality of the problem, since that is the relative choice we have, I think there is little question that the new standards are a better reflection of the health issues. Senator Thomas. That's your view, and I understand that. Mr. Grumet. That's why I'm here to offer it. Senator Thomas. But that's not a consensus, obviously. Not everyone thinks that's--it seems like the northeast seems to have more problem with air quality. Is that valid. Mr. Grumet. It partially---- Senator Thomas. I can almost tell where people came from as to what they're going to say. Mr. Grumet. I think the map I showed you--and I refer back to attachment ``A''--demonstrates that if you care about chronic exposure to ozone, the midwest actually has a greater health risk than the northeast. If you look at the highest one hour experienced each year, the northeast has a worse problem than the midwest. Senator Thomas. Is the northeast generally in compliance. Mr. Grumet. By and large, no, for two reasons--our own pollution and the pollution that wafts into our region from other regions. Senator Thomas. Why would you then ask for more stringent controls if you're not in compliance with what's in place. Mr. Grumet. That's an excellent question, and the answer is because the existing standards call forth irrational and ineffective controls, which is why implementing them doesn't fix the problem. Senator Thomas. The EPA director said that they're not putting in the control; that they're leaving that to somebody else. All they're doing is setting standards. Mr. Grumet. You have to apply standards in order to try to meet a certain end point. If that end point is trying to reduce peak ozone levels and your only opportunity is to try to place controls in the urban area where you have that kind of violation, you are left with doing things like regulating bakeries very stringently. Senator Thomas. But you haven't met the controls now. Mr. Grumet. We have implemented far more controls than other regions of the country, yet we still have---- Senator Thomas. No. Let's talk about results. Let's talk about goals. Your goal is compliance with current, isn't it. Mr. Grumet. It is, absolutely. And if we are given an inappropriate set of tools which are ineffective in achieving those goals, it's hard for me to understand how we could be criticized for our failure. Senator Thomas. I don't understand that, but my light is-- -- Mr. Thurston. Maybe I could help if I responded to this point. Senator Thomas. My time is up. Senator Inhofe. Well, I think it is kind of interesting. You talk about where you are out of attainment, and out there you are. I've often thought--I can remember when Secretary Browner talked about when she goes around the country, so yes, you have an attainment problem. It's not your fault. It's the guys west of you. This happened down in Louisiana when she was making a presentation down there. ``You mean we're going to have to actually implement all these changes?'' No, your problem comes from Texas. And I'm sure if she were in Texas she'd say it was from Arizona, and eventually get maybe to Wyoming. I don't know. I was pleased yesterday to hear from Secretary Pena on this zero emissions car, but I think we're losing site of something here because I'd like to remind my colleagues that Carol Browner had previously stated that no new requirements would be placed on mobile sources under these standards, anyway; that it would all be from utilities. And also I'd like to point out that I can remember some 20 years ago when they said by the year 1998 we'd all be driving electric cars. Well, that's next year, and I don't see that coming up either. So I think in the best of circumstances the announcement yesterday--he said that this would be available in the show rooms in 10 years. Well, I wouldn't want to predicate our decisions today on what we think is going to happen in 10 years. Back to you, Mr. Abbott. When you talked about the refineries, and I don't think you and I either one would blame the owner of a refinery for going south of the border in that very competitive industry, because they could be down there where they do not have the requirements--the EPA requirements and other requirements. I can remember during the debate on NAFTA one of my concerns was that in the transportation industry that we would allow--NAFTA would allow a Mexican trucking line to pick up a load in Brownsville, Texas, and take it to New York City and not comply with all the requirements. And, of course, that gave them a competitive advantage. And so I don't think either one of us would blame them for doing that. I just want to correct an environment that encourages that. Mr. Abbott. Absolutely. Yes, sir. One of the things that's important to point out, too, is that these cars that Senator Baucus talked about, all of these things have been going for quite a while under the old EPA Act. I mean, there has been a lot--there has been an evolving technology that has been going on for some time. That certainly did not come about because EPA decided to change the standards. We are on the cutting edge. The building trades unions do install a lot of the environmental controls, and therein is one of the problems, because a lot of these large utilities have gone to a tremendous expense, hundreds of millions of dollars, to install pollution control equipment, and then all of the sudden the goal post is moved and now some of the other businesses that were not in compliance perhaps under these standards have an additional 10 years to comply. It just seemed that the Clean Air Act was working, we were getting excellent results all the way through. The emissions were being reduced, the pollution was being reduced, the ozone level was going down, and the control equipment that was being put on or had been ordered in the last few years, some of that equipment, because these standards were being proposed, the owners held off installing clean air equipment. So there were a lot of jobs that were lost just from the fact that these standards were pending and not knowing what was going to happen. Senator Inhofe. Mr. Abbott, I think in all the seven hearings we've had I don't recall one person suggesting that the air isn't getting cleaner every day. It is. However, that doesn't seem to be factored in to all these considerations, what we're going to do from this point forward. I think the most--when you talk about moving the goal posts, Government doesn't understand what it costs to move goal posts. When an industry--I don't care if it's a baking industry or the family farmer or the power industry--invests millions of dollars, and then all the sudden finds, ``Well, we now have implemented new standards, so you have to do--'' there just is not an appreciation for the cost and who bears that ultimate cost, whether it's the cost of labor, the cost of manufacturing, the cost of production. It's going to be ultimately the consumer. That's the thing that concerns me. Mr. Grumet, I understand that the standards that are proposed by the EPA are really not enough for you, are not set high enough for you. I think you've been quoted many times saying you want a more stringent standard. Mr. Grumet. Are you speaking of the recently-set standards or the old standards. Senator Inhofe. The recently-set standards. Mr. Grumet. I'm not sure what you're referring to, but back, I guess, 6 months ago we did comment that the particulate standard, the daily particulate standard, should be set more strictly than the 65 micrograms per cubic meter, so we do think that standard is inadequately protective. But, again, we're not going to let the best become the enemy of the good. Senator Inhofe. I was really wondering whose side you're on. You're against our bill, but you also are against the---- Mr. Grumet. No. I'm strongly supportive, as are the Northeast States, of the standards recently adopted by the Administrator. Senator Inhofe. But you said those standards do not go far enough. Mr. Grumet. I'm saying that I don't think they're perfect and I don't think any standards ever will be perfect. I think those standards are far better protective of public health and far better in terms of inspiring cost-effective results. Senator Inhofe. All right. I'm going to pursue this, and I don't have to leave but Senator Baucus does, so I'll yield to him. Senator Baucus. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'd just like to--first of all, I have a letter I want to insert in the record. This is from Administrator Browner. She has information that bears on this hearing and the fact that she asked to testify and she was refused the ability to come to testify at this hearing, so I'll put this letter in the record. [The information to be supplied follows:] Environmental Protection Agency, Office of the Administrator, October 21, 1997. The Honorable Max Baucus, Committee on Environment and Public Works, United States Senate, Washington, DC 20510. Dear Senator Baucus: I am writing in response to your letter of October 15, 1997 requesting the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) views on S. 1084, a bill that would repeal EPA's recent update of the air quality standards for ozone and particulate matter. As you know, these new standards are a major step forward in public health protection. Each year, they will prevent approximately 15,000 premature deaths, as well as hundreds of thousands of cases of significantly decreased lung function in children and hundreds of thousands of asthma attacks in children and adults. EPA strongly opposes S. 1084 because it would undermine these important public health protections. The bill would revoke the stronger, updated standards, reinstate the old standards, and prohibit EPA from revising or replacing these outdated standards for at least 4 years. The decision to strengthen the air quality standards was based on compelling science indicating that the old standards were not adequately protective. Repeal or delay would only result in needless suffering for millions of Americans. In addition, delay would have other adverse health consequences and environmental effects such as reduced yields of agricultural crops, damage to commercial and non- commercial forests, and continued visibility impairment. Furthermore, the public has a right to know whether the air in their communities is safe to breathe, as determined by the latest, best available science--and these standards are the means by which government makes this information available. As you know, the President has announced a flexible, common-sense implementation plan for the new standards. This implementation approach will continue current progress in achieving cleaner air. It will give states, local governments and business the flexibility to meet the new standards in a cost-effective way. EPA's strategy for regional emissions reductions, as proposed by EPA last week, will allow the vast majority of areas to meet the new ozone standard without additional local pollution controls. The President's implementation policy also ensures that at a new round of review of particulate matter science will be completed within 5 years, and that no areas will be designated as nonattainment for fine particles during this period. The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is no objection to the submission of this report from the standpoint of the President's program. I hope that these views are helpful. If I can provide any additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me. Sincerely, Carol M. Browner. Senator Baucus. Second, I'd just like to remind us all of the time line--I'll just take PM2.5--that something might happen. This year EPA issues its final PM2.5 standard. This year EPA begins new scientific review of health effects of fine particulate matter. Next year, voluntary State discussions on regionally transported particle pollution. Between the year 1998 and the year 2000, monitors are put in place nationwide. I might add that in Administrator Browner's letter she states that, with respect to PM2.5, that the President's implementation policy also ensures that the new round of review of particulate matter science will be completed within 5 years, and that no areas will be designated as nonattainment for fine particles during this period, so there is a whole 5-year study that will be in place before any decisions will be made on particulate matter. In the period 1998 to 2003, collect monitoring data; in the year 2002, EPA completes the 5-year scientific review of particulate matter standards, which I just mentioned and she states in her letter. Between the years 2002 and 2005, EPA designates areas. Between the years 2005 and 2008, the States submit their plans, their SIPs, outlining how they will meet the PM2.5 standard, and the States needing reductions begin. That's in the period between 2005 and 2008. So, in summary, between the years 2012 and 2017, following designation, States may have up to--the point it, the States may have up to 12 years under the Clean Air Act to meet PM2.5 standards. We're going to learn a lot in the next 12 years. We're going to learn the degree to which the standards selected by the Administrator make sense and the degree to which they don't make sense, reminding ourselves that the standards that she selected were for range proposed by CASAC, the scientific review panel. She didn't just pick these out of thin air. This is a range of standards presented to her by CASAC, which is required under current law, a 5-year review of every 5 years. So I understand some of the concerns that people have about these standards. I have concerns, myself. I come from a farm State. But I also think that this period of time gives us adequate time to adjust it, to change the standards that they should be changed, depending upon data that we get and studies that are conducted. All this makes much more sense to me to continue down this time line rather than to pass this bill, which says stop. In fact, it implies we don't do anything. It just says do nothing for 4 years. And, as has been pointed out, there's nothing in this bill that says we do anything after 4 years. It just says stop. And we do know that there are a lot--that these standards will avoid many premature deaths, certainly avoid a lot of unhealthy--some people that have unhealthy conditions that have caused them to be very unhealthy. And I trust, frankly, the American people. I trust the process. It's the only one we've got, folks. It's us, our country, our Government. We should work to make it work, not just say stop, do nothing with respect to PM2.5 and ozone. Another point I'd like to make is with respect to PM2.5. It's my understanding that virtually none of the PM2.5 would be directed at agriculture. One could dispute whether it's 1 percent or 2 percent or what not, but it's a very small amount. In fact, we all know the letter from Carol Browner to Secretary Glickman saying it's not targeted at agriculture, etc. I have some sympathy to what you're saying, Mr. Sharp. A lot of farmers and ranchers, it's a very small margin and they're out of business. There's no doubt about that. I know that's the case. But I also strongly suspect that when States implement implementation plans for areas that are in nonattainment, they're not going to sell it to agriculture. They just won't. At least they won't in my State. I can tell you that. I can't speak to other States, but I think that farmers should be slightly concerned about all of this, but I don't think they should be alarmed. Mr. Sharp. Could I reply to that. Senator Baucus. Sure. Mr. Sharp. Our concern is that EPA has no idea how much we emit of PM2.5. That's the biggest concern for us. We want to avoid regulation that California has already included for PM10. I'll read---- Senator Baucus. We don't have time here. We don't want to talk about PM10, because we're not talking about PM10. We're talking about PM2.5. Mr. Sharp. Okay. PM2.5 for agriculture fugitive dust from crops, three million tons is their estimate from agriculture; agricultural livestock, 181,000 tons. Those figures are what has been given to the States to use---- Senator Baucus. That's 2.5. Mr. Sharp. That's 2.5 Senator Baucus. And whose studies are those. Mr. Sharp. Those are all credited in STAPPA and ALAPCA, the State and Territorial Air Pollution Program"
