        "text": "Despite record flooding in northwest Iowa and a record number of tornadoes across the state, the relatively mild summer should produce good crop yields.\n\n“In typical La Nina falls, we generally see warmer temperatures, which could be good for agriculture, drying down in the fields,\" State Climatologist Justin Glisan said. \"We don’t need as much propane to dry down the grain. But also, some semblance of a near-normal to slightly wetter pattern for September, October and November. So, it could be shaping up to be another excellent season in fall, as well as summer.”\n\nThough temperatures will be heating up over the weekend, it won't reach the heat levels experienced at this time last year, he said.\n\n“If you remember last year after the state fair, we had two flavors of heat waves. We had one in which dew points were up in the upper 70s and low 80s. So we had heat index values in the 120°-130° range. And then we had a second heat wave that was very dry, low relative humidity, but overall, we haven’t seen heat waves.”\n\nGlisan made his comments on IPR’s River to River on Friday.\n\nA cabinet-level federal administrator is in western Iowa to encourage people who’ve seen their homes and livelihoods damaged or demolished by this year’s severe weather to accept help from the federal government.\n\nAdministrator Isabel Casillas Guzman heads the U.S. Small Business Administration and tells Radio Iowa that the SBA isn’t just devoted to helping small businesses recover, but also helping home owners and renters. She says her team aims to help customers and employees.\n\nGuzman is in the Adair County town of Greenfield, which was hit by an EF-4 tornado in May that killed four people and destroyed 153 homes. It’s been an especially bad year for severe weather in Iowa, with significant damage in multiple counties from storms, flooding, straight-line winds, and a record 122 tornadoes.\n\nGuzman says the SBA has approved over 500 loans of $62 million to residents and businesses across the three disaster declarations.\n\nGuzman plans to visit Greenfield businesses as well as the SBA’s Greenfield Disaster Recovery Center which opened earlier this month. She also plans to host a meet and greet with homeowners to hear about their recovery needs.\n\nFriday afternoon, the administrator will hold a roundtable meeting in West Des Moines with federal, state and local stakeholders, along with business owners and non-profits, to discuss tornado damage recovery efforts. She says the agency’s loans are very affordable.\n\n“These are 30-year terms, so those payments are spread out over quite a long period, and they’re very low cost, as low as 2.68% for homeowners and renters, as well as as low as 4% for businesses and 3.25% for nonprofits,” Guzman says. “We hope to continue to move forward and get as many of those who need help the assistance that they need.”\n\nBefore flying back to Washington D.C, Guzman plans to meet with the owners of BLK & Bold in Des Moines, the first black-owned nationally-distributed coffee company, as part of celebrating National Black Business Month.\n\nOver 40 languages are spoken in the city of Waterloo, often by families of first-generation immigrants to Iowa.\n\nThat has brought on a shortage of translators, and in turn a difficulty for non-native English speakers to connect with essential services.\n\nGlen Keith is the executive director of Love Inc. in the Cedar Valley, one of several area nonprofits that provide community support for non-native English speakers. He says it’s sometimes difficult to connect people with what they need due to a shortage of translators.\n\n“We have such a diverse community here in the Cedar Valley, and oftentimes it bridges misunderstandings and cultural gaps, and being a volunteer-based organization, it’s always tough to find enough translators to talk with folks who need that assistance.”\n\nLove Inc. currently has two translators, one for French and another for Spanish.\n\nWaterloo languages range from Burmese to Bosnian, from Spanish to Congolese French.\n\nSchool district schedules and academic documents are shared in four languages to accommodate families who speak a language other than English at home.\n\n“When you think about legal documents, people applying for different things, there’s an incredible need,” says Keith. “And then you think about all the nonprofits serving this community, we’re all in the same boat asking for help.”\n\nRepublican Rep. Ashley Hinson is speaking out against Vice President Kamala Harris’s southern border policy as outlined in her acceptance speech for the Democratic nomination.\n\nHinson’s comments came after Harris said that the nation can \"reform its broken immigration system” while also criticizing former President Donald Trump for his role in striking down a bipartisan border security bill.\n\nHinson argued in her media call on Friday morning that support died because the bill simply wouldn’t do enough.\n\n“That bill is a nonstarter in the House because it’s like a piece of masking tape over a gushing Niagara Falls. It’s not a realistic plan. It still allows for nearly two million illegal immigrants to come in every year.”\n\nShe also went on to criticize Harris for having not yet met with the head of the Border Patrol Union with just over 70 days before the election.\n\nThis fall, 319 public sector labor unions across the state will vote on whether to recertify their unions. Before contract negotiations can begin, public sector unions have an extra step the private sector doesn’t. More than 50% of the union have to vote “yes.” Any “no” votes, or people who choose not to vote, count against the recertification effort.\n\nThe Iowa State Education Association, which represents teachers, has been critical of the law since it passed in 2017. ISEA President Joshua Brown says if politicians were held to the same standards, reelection would be an impossibility.\n\n“If the governor had to get a majority of people to vote yes to let her stay in office, if you counted every single person that didn’t vote against her, that would not happen.”\n\nHe says even with the new school year starting, his locals are preparing for how to run an election and ensure members are aware it’s happening.\n\nThe election period will run for two weeks in mid-October.\n\nThe South Dakota Supreme Court has ruled in favor of landowners on the route of a proposed CO2 pipeline in a case that questions whether the company behind the project should be allowed to use eminent domain.\n\nMultiple lawsuits from landowners challenged Summit Carbon Solutions’ legal right to survey private property without consent. They also argued that Summit is not a common carrier, which is necessary to use eminent domain.\n\nThe ruling states that granting Summit common carrier status is premature at this point and sent it back to the lower courts for further litigation.\n\nA spokesperson with Summit said, “We are evaluating the South Dakota Supreme Court's decision and look forward to providing the information requested to the district court that reaffirms our role as a common carrier, and that CO2 is a commodity.”\n\nThe Sierra Club of Iowa says the court’s decision is a win for landowners.\n\nLandowners in Iowa are also challenging a state survey law. Oral arguments in front of the Iowa Supreme Court will be held on Oct. 8\n\nScams involving taxes have been around for some time, but the Internal Revenue Service says they are becoming more sophisticated, and now operate online.\n\nThe IRS is partnering with state tax agencies and private groups to combat the growth of scams targeting taxpayers and tax systems.\n\nTerry Lemons, a spokesperson for the agency, says many of these scams now circulate on social media.\n\n“What’s different now is we’re seeing a lot of social media activity on this, and a lot of people only get their information off social media and there’s a lot of bad advice circulating about tax issues on social media. And that’s part of what led us to this effort.”\n\nOne scam involves so-called “ghost preparers.”\n\n“These are people who take a large payment and promise a big refund. We call them ghost preparers because they don’t sign the tax return. And after the return’s filed and they make their money, they disappear, leaving the taxpayer on the hook for whatever consequences are there.”\n\nLemons says a new task force known as the Coalition Against Scam and Scheme Threats, or CASST, will counter the scams through enforcement and education. Along with the IRS and state agencies, the task force includes tax software companies and tax professional organizations. He says any time someone has a question about their taxes, they can call their local IRS branch.\n\nA paid job training program in Des Moines will address barriers to entering the workforce for young adults experiencing or at risk of homelessness.\n\nYSS, a nonprofit serving a variety of youth, held a ribbon cutting this week at its Rooftop Gardens hydroponic greenhouse to celebrate the first group of workers that started in July.\n\nSamanthya Marlatt, director of youth empowerment and advocacy at is with YSS, said the main barriers for this cohort finding permanent work are housing, transportation and food access.\n\n“We also have a little kitchenette. We keep it stocked with breakfast items, snacks, stuff to make lunches because what I’ve seen time and time again with workforce programs not designed for this population, is that they will come to programming and leave at noon or so because they don’t have food and they will have to go somewhere that has food.”\n\nThe program includes working in the greenhouse and meeting individual career goals, like earning degrees or certifications. Marlatt says the focus for the first few months is instilling hope in the young adults.\n\nThe goal at the end of the program is for each participant to secure a job or enroll in classes for college or trade school.\n\n“They don’t have time to slow down, think about their passions, think about how they want to be connected to the community or sit in the classroom and be in a place to upskill to get higher level credentials or career pathways. We need to get them out of survival mode and into dreaming mode.”\n\nAdditional help is available in northwest Iowa for victims still trying to recover from historic flooding this summer.\n\nCommunity Action Agency of Siouxland Executive Director Jean Logan says recovering from a natural disaster takes time and money.\n\n“We've all learned a lot about what the limits of federal assistance are, and it's just not going to cover the amount of damage that some of the people have received. You know, people are getting bids to recover that it's going to take $120,000. Well, FEMA property loss caps out at $42,500.”\n\nLogan says one of the biggest challenges is finding contractors to fix homes.\n\n“We have a lot of people that have not got repairs done, that are living in campers, sometimes they're on their property. We still have people that have not had power restored to their homes.”\n\nA long-term recovery group has been formed to help with building materials, food, financial support and mental health services for Woodbury County residents and areas just outside the Sioux City metro area.\n\nLogan hopes the group will continue expanding into other communities as more organizations offer assistance.\n\nThe state of Iowa has launched a new website with the goal of making it easier for families to find child care.\n\nIowans can visit childcareconnect.iowa.gov to search for open child care slots near their home or on their route to work. The search can be filtered by location, type of child care, quality ratings and more. The website doesn’t include prices.\n\nKelly Garcia is director of the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services. She says she struggled to find child care for her own kids, and this will be an important tool for parents. Garcia says it’ll also allow policymakers to figure out where child care shortages exist so they can consider targeted solutions.\n\n“The power of this data is incredibly valuable to all involved. And again, nearly real-time, which allows us to make decisions today, but probably more importantly allows us to invest for our future.”\n\nGov. Kim Reynolds says it’ll help parents who need daycare and policymakers who want to see which parts of the state need more investment in child care.\n\n“To our knowledge, we believe Iowa is the first state in the nation to integrate and display near real-time child care data from multiple sources in this way, while also improving our child care system statewide.”\n\nState officials say the child care search website cost about $5 million and was paid for with federal American Rescue Plan funding. It’ll take an estimated $500,000 per year to maintain.\n\nRead more.\n\nAn Iowan who has served on the Democratic National Committee for the past four years says there’s been a sea change within the party since Vice President Kamala Harris became the party’s presidential nominee.\n\nJodi Clemens of West Branch spoke with Radio Iowa from the floor of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago.\n\n“The enthusiasm and the energy that has been brought in the past couple of weeks has just been amazing,” Clemens said. “I think we kind of forgot what it was like to feel optimistic and it’s just been really great. Volunteers have been pouring in from back home and we’re just having a really great time.”\n\nClemens, who worked on Bernie Sanders’ 2020 Iowa caucus campaign, described Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as “an inspiring pick” for vice president.\n\n“Minnesota’s doing some amazing things up there, passing some of the legislation that we’d love to enable on a national level, you know, free school lunches for all kids,” Clemens said. “The things he’s been able to achieve, I think us Iowans are looking up there, we’re ready to take back our governorship and our Legislature and get some of our own progressive policies passed.”\n\nWalz was the closing speaker at the convention last night.\n\nDelegate C.J. Petersen of Templeton uses the word “outreach” to describe the message party activists are getting from the convention stage.\n\n“Make sure we’re uncovering every stone and we’re doing everything we can,” Petersen said. “We don’t want to wake up the day after the election and wonder what we could have done differently.”\n\nPetersen, who was born deaf, was a brief sign language interpreter on the floor of the convention Tuesday night. During the roll call of the states, Petersen signed what the state party chair said during Iowa’s half minute in the spotlight.\n\n(Additional reporting in Chicago by Ashley Byrd, Learfield)\n\nSac County’s jail in Sac City has been in operation for over 80 years, and the county’s voters will decide in November whether a new jail should be built.\n\nThe Sac County Board of Supervisors is proposing that a new county jail be built across the street from the current one, then the old one would be used by the county sheriff’s office.\n\nThe supervisors have voted to put a nearly $11 million bond referendum on the General Election ballot to finance the two-phase project. According to the state jail inspector, Sac County has the second-oldest jail in Iowa and it does not meet current safety standards, putting staff, inmates and the public at risk.\n\nIowa’s oldest county jail is in Pocahontas. Last November, Pocahontas County voters overwhelmingly approved $8.5 million in bonding for a new 18-bed jail.\n\n(Abby Ward, KCIM)\n\nOrganizers for the Farm Progress Show near Boone are preparing for around 150,000 people across the three-day event next week.\n\nDon Tourte is the senior vice president of sales and events for Farm Progress.\n\nHe says farmers looking for the latest in agriculture technology are the core audience.\n\n“There really is nothing like the Farm Progress Show when it comes to the world of agriculture. And I’m a little bit biased because obviously I’ve been doing this for a while. But everyone should come see this. Everyone should appreciate what’s going on. Everyone should appreciate what it takes to raise the food that we, the food and fiber that we have every day in America.”\n\nThe Farm Progress Show draws in more than 600 exhibitors showcasing everything from the latest combine design to apps that identify pests in the field.\n\nThe show will run from Aug. 27-29.\n\nThis is the 8th year in Boone. The location alternates with Decatur, Ill.\n\nInflation is making it harder for many families to afford everything on required back-to-school supply lists this year.\n\nIn Iowa, teachers may spend an average of $700 a year on supplies. That's more than Nebraska and South Dakota, but less than Missouri–where teacher spending can reach as high as $1,300.\n\nKristen Beinecke is a Missouri kindergarten teacher. She says her community bands together to help keep schools stocked. Still, needs arise.\n\n“I think when that happens the teachers do provide it. It's in our makeup. It's in who we are. I always say that being a teacher is a calling and not a career. It's a calling and not a job.”\n\nOver her 24 years in the classroom, Beinecke says she has spent thousands of dollars of her own money on supplies.\n\nThe National Education Association, a teachers union, says inflation has raised the prices of school essentials by more than 20% in recent years. Teachers and schools often depend on nonprofits and donations also to fill the gap.\n\nRead more from Holly Edgell.\n\nA courtroom heard emotional victim impact statements during the sentencing of an Algona man for the shooting death of an Algona police officer last year.\n\nA judge in Kossuth County this morning handed down a mandatory sentence of life behind bars without parole to 44-year-old Kyle Ricke. A jury in Dickinson County convicted him of first-degree murder last month.\n\nRicke said he was sorry for killing Algona Officer Kevin Cram.\n\n“Every night, I pray for forgiveness for the family. I'm very regretful for the pain and hurt that I caused them, and I pray that one day that they can forgive me for my horrible actions.”\n\nAfter Ricke told the court he was sorry for shooting Cram, Cram’s father responded.\n\n“You ambushed him like a coward. After he was on the ground, defenseless, you put three more bullets in his back. That is the very definition of a yellow, back-shooting coward, and that is you.”\n\nCram was shot eight times at close range after arriving to arrest Ricke on a warrant for misdemeanor harassment.\n\n“You not only destroyed a family and children's lives, but your own family and an entire community with your selfishness,” said Cram’s wife, Lara.\n\nThe packed Kossuth County courtroom also heard an emotional recording of one of Cram’s three sons crying because he misses his dad.\n\nIowans are being warned to be very careful when posting videos of themselves on social media.\n\nJim Temmer with the Better Business Bureau says criminals are using audio from online videos to fake people’s voices in scam calls.\n\n“If you put anything out there that has your voice in it — not very long, it’s something like eight or ten seconds — they can use software then to generate your voice saying anything.”\n\nTemmer says scammers are banking on people’s trust of them to trick people into other scams, like sending money transfers or giving up personal information.\n\n“A friend of yours, a relative, gets a call from you saying, ‘Hey, I’m in trouble. I need some help right now,’ and it not only sounds like you, but scammers also have the ability to spoof phone numbers.”\n\nThe best way to prevent this from happening is to only share your videos with your friends and family. Temmer warns to keep a close eye on friend requests to make sure they are not from phony accounts.\n\nA new state law to address chronic absenteeism requires notifying parents by certified letter if a student misses school for eight days in a semester. After additional absences, there must be an in-person meeting with a parent or guardian.\n\nThe most recent data shows absenteeism is remarkably widespread in Iowa schools.\n\n“The levels of chronic absence tend to be highest in the high school level and then middle school and then elementary,” says Anne Discher, executive director of Common Good Iowa, “But there’s no doubt that even at the elementary level we’re seeing high levels of chronic absence.”\n\nAdvocates of the new law say regular attendance at school is a habit that will carry over into adulthood and much of what happens in a classroom cannot be learned through make-up work. According to a national group called Attendance Works, one in four Iowa students were chronically absent during the 2021-22 school year. Discher says that means they missed 10% or more of school days, for any reason.\n\n“It could be sickness, it could be vacations, it could be any number of things,” Discher says, “But the idea is that when kids are absent for any reason, they’re not getting the instruction they need that day.”\n\nDischer is hoping more recent data could show improvement, but she said some students just haven’t reconnected with school after the pandemic.\n\n\"Certainly we would encourage districts to really start out with supportive techniques to really help reengage students in school,” Discher said.\n\nUnder Iowa law, if a student misses 20% of school days in a semester, a meeting of the student, a parent or guardian and the county attorney will be scheduled.\n\nGov. Kim Reynolds is awarding $7.2 million to housing developers that have plans to build new homes and apartments in communities hit by severe storms and flooding this year.\n\nReynolds announced the program last month to supplement government assistance in areas covered by federal disaster declarations.\n\nThe funding announced Tuesday supports 175 new housing units in six communities.\n\nMuch of the money is going toward projects in flooded cities in northwest Iowa. In Spencer, which saw record flooding back in June, developers plan to use the money to build 27 single-family homes there, and another 24 multi-family units. In Rock Valley, four different projects will share in the state funding. Other projects were approved in Rock Rapids, Cherokee, Minden and Crescent.\n\nThe Iowa Economic Development Authority will continue taking applications until the program reaches its $10 million limit.\n\nA separate state program is available to help current homeowners in FEMA disaster areas pay for repairs.\n\nA judge has denied a request for a new trial from the man who was convicted last month in the September 2023 shooting death of Algona Police Officer Kevin Cram.\n\nAttorneys for 44-year-old Kyle Lou Ricke filed a motion on Aug. 5 requesting a new trial, following his conviction on a charge of first-degree murder back in July. In that motion, Attorney Barbara Westphal argued that the jury’s verdict of guilty was contrary to the evidence presented during trial, and insufficient to prove the premeditation required for a conviction on a charge of first-degree murder.\n\nFollowing a video conference on Monday, Judge Nancy Whittenburg denied the defendant’s request for a new trial on Tuesday.\n\nIn the ruling, Judge Whittenburg writes, “The Iowa Criminal Jury Instructions defining 'willful,' 'deliberate,' 'premeditate' and 'malice aforethought' do not require any particular length of time before the act.\n\nShe goes on to say the defendant's “actions of walking away from his conversation with Officer Cram, retrieving a firearm, and then returning to where Cram was standing to unload all or nearly all of his firearm’s magazine into Cram’s body is sufficient to suggest 'willful,' 'deliberate' and 'premeditated' conduct. These acts also suggest malice.”\n\nWith the motion for a new trial denied, Ricke’s sentencing will continue as scheduled Wednesday at 9:30 a.m. The first-degree murder conviction carries a mandatory sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole.\n\nThis September, residents in the Cedar Rapids Community School District will decide whether to continue its tax levy for school facility maintenance and equipment.\n\nCRCSD is the second-largest school district in the state and Superintendent Tawana Grover says for 50 years, the voter-approved Physical Plant and Equipment Levy, or PPEL, has been an important pot of money for the district.\n\n“Within the Cedar Rapids Community School District, we're taking care of 32 buildings. That’s huge, right? With the PPEL funding, we're able to take care of the upkeep of our facilities, to take care of some of the basic needs for our students.”\n\nLast year, voters said no to the district’s bond for new buildings. This special election does not include any of the projects from that plan. If renewed, PPEL would provide more than $10 million over ten years for facilities, equipment, security and other improvements.\n\nGrover says since the district has already been putting aside the money for 50 years, reupping this September wouldn’t impact tax rates.\n\n“I'm not asking the community for one more cent. We're just renewing things, taking care of business the way that they've been taking care of for the last 50 years. And we want to keep doing it for the next 50 years to come.”\n\nToday is the first day voters in the district can receive absentee ballots or vote early in person. The special election is Sept. 10.\n\nIowa delegates to the Democratic National Convention cast their votes in a ceremonial roll call Tuesday night.\n\nParty officials announced earlier this month that the Iowa delegation was unanimously supporting Harris as their party’s presidential nominee, but the chair of the Iowa Democratic Party’s Arab American Caucus instead voted present. All the other Iowa delegates supported the Harris-Walz ticket.\n\nEach state chose an upbeat dance tune for their time in the spotlight. Iowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart made the announcement as \"Celebration\" by Kool & the Gang played.\n\n“The Tall Corn State of Iowa, the state that launched Barack Obama on his way to the presidency, the state that put ‘Education’ on its state quarter and the state that feeds and fuels the world casts one vote present and 45 votes for the next president of the United States of America, Kamala Harris,” Hart said.\n\nObama won Iowa’s 2008 caucuses and carried the state in the 2008 and 2012 general elections. Donald Trump won Iowa in 2016 and 2020.\n\nPolls this year in Iowa have consistently shown Trump leading Joe Biden by a significant margin, but Brian Jackson, a delegate from Solon, said having Harris at the top of the ticket could make a big difference.\n\n“Maybe folks who were not 100% happy with some of Biden’s policies — he’s done a lot of great things, there are some things that people might disagree with — I think we’re going to see a lot of those people in the middle of the road, and even people on the Republican side, realize that what we’re trying to do is bring people together,\" Jackson said during an interview in the convention hall.\n\nThe co-founder of the company operating a baby formula factory in southern Iowa said there is an opportunity for significant growth in production capacity and the workforce at the plant in Allerton.\n\nRon Belldegrun is the CEO of ByHeart, which bought the DairiConcepts plant in Allerton after using the facility in 2019 during trials of its new recipe for baby formula.\n\n“After six years of development, we launched as the first new infant formula manufacturer in over 15 years,” Belldegrun said.\n\nBaby formula recalls and subsequent shortages in 2022 highlighted the fact that three companies controlled 90% of the market. ByHeart’s production of baby formula began in March of 2022. It bought the Allerton plant in 2023.\n\nByHeart uses whole milk from grass-fed cows and other ingredients in the powder that’s currently produced in Allerton, but canned and packaged at a facility in Oregon. Belldegrun said ByHeart invested “very heavily” in the Allerton plant to make it a “state of the art” baby formula factory. There are now 100 people employed at the facility.\n\n“We’ve increased the workforce by nearly 40%. Now that facility is one of the only facilities to come online to support this critically important domestic supply chain since the shortage.”\n\nByHeart, which also owns plants in Pennsylvania and Oregon, currently produces enough formula to feed half a million babies a year.\n\nBelldegrun said the company has a “big vision” for what’s next in Allerton. Engineers are drawing up plans to add packaging and canning to the Allerton plant, and Belldegrun said he’s had “productive discussions” with government officials, university researchers, farmers and other ingredient suppliers about creating what he describes as “an ecosystem” around the southern Iowa facility.\n\nProposed ordinances affecting the unhoused population in Des Moines were not on the agenda at Monday night’s city council meeting. But that didn’t stop several of those in attendance from speaking out against them.\n\nOne new ordinance would impose a $50 fine for sleeping in a public space. Another ordinance would be amended to shorten the amount of time someone has to remove their belongings from public property.\n\nLuiz Gomez said many unhoused people have mental health and substance abuse issues, while others living on the street are fleeing domestic violence.\n\n“Fining people $50 and taking them to jail, to put a simple misdemeanor in their record, will make it harder for them to obtain housing. So, do you really think that will help folks get out of the situation they’re facing?”\n\nMayor Connie Boesen has said the city is working with service providers, and Des Moines has done more than any other city in Iowa to provide affordable housing.\n\nThe Des Moines City Council has tentatively scheduled a third and final reading of the ordinances at a Sept. 16 meeting. After the second reading, only Ward 3 councilmember Josh Mandelbaum voted against the ordinances.\n\nA national organization has singled out a northwest Iowa city for its diversity. The Same House, based in Atlanta, is hosting an event on Wednesday called Tables Across America in Orange City. The goal is for people to bond over food, conversation and other activities.\n\nOrange City Chamber of Commerce Executive Director Mike Hofman said Tables Across America usually happens in larger locations, but Orange City was chosen for the way it embraces new residents, including people from Ukraine, South America and China.\n\n“Sometimes rural, small America gets overpassed by some of these larger organizations because they just think there's nothing going on in these communities. And there certainly is.”\n\nHofman said the demographics of Orange City have grown more diverse because of new residents moving into town from other counties.\n\n“The only way that we're going to continue to grow is by having new demographics come to town. And it's a great way for us to get those folks integrated into the community — doing events like this and inviting them — and then also, trying to get them connected with local service organizations and ways that they can be involved in the community is always a good thing.”\n\nThe Same House visit also coincides with an end-of-year celebration for the Orange City Arts Council.\n\nThe State Auditor’s Office has examined operations in the town of Zearing after the city’s former clerk missed two deadlines and the city was unable to collect property taxes for a year.\n\nZearing City Clerk Karen Davis was fired in July of 2022 after she failed to file the city’s budget with the state. It was a $191,000 hit to the budget for the town of about 500 residents, because no property taxes could be collected\n\nResidents of Zearing asked the State Auditor’s Office to review how their town’s finances are handled. The general conclusion from the state auditor’s report is that the Zearing City Council needs “to exercise additional oversight of the city’s finances.”\n\nThe review found the city’s balance sheet was not kept up to date and one city employee was responsible for the city’s payroll, for handling cash and checks paid to the city and for paying all the city’s bills.\n\nThe auditor’s staff also reviewed when city funds were used to buy fuel and other items from a business owned by a member of the city council. The report concludes 72 charges were “not properly supported with an invoice.”\n\nOne of the Iowa delegates at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago said her friends in other countries are paying close attention to the presidential race.\n\nState Sen. Janice Weiner, D-Iowa City, joined the U.S. State Department in 1987 and had assignments in seven foreign countries before her retirement as a foreign service officer.\n\n“I can guarantee you that people around the world have their eyes trained on the United States, both for this convention and they will be throughout the entire election period. I have friends who’ve been talking about it for months.”\n\nWeiner said one reason she wanted to be a delegate at this week’s convention was because of President Biden’s foreign policy initiatives.\n\n“We need to thank him for the last four years, for standing up for democracy, for strengthening alliances, for strengthening NATO, for standing up for and helping Ukraine, for really making us a country and a government that our foreign partners can work with and trust.”\n\nIowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart said for the past two weeks she has been thinking about the speech Biden would give at the convention and how it would solidify his legacy.\n\nThe State of Iowa currently holds around $500 million in unclaimed funds and property.\n\nState Treasurer Roby Smith paid a visit to the Des Moines Community Playhouse Monday to return a small portion — $316.80 — that had landed in the state’s fund of unclaimed property.\n\nMoney often lands with the state from unclaimed bank accounts and insurance policies. For the Playhouse, it came from a school district that had sent a group to see a play but didn’t work out the payment process.\n\nSmith said one in ten Iowans are likely to have unclaimed money held by his office. Individuals should check online to see if they have money to claim — and so should businesses and nonprofits.\n\n“And we encourage people to do it once a year. We always have money coming in. Always getting it reported to us, and we just want to get the rightful owners back.”\n\nLast year, the Treasurer’s Office said it returned a record $34 million in cash and valuables. Smith is hoping to top that mark by the end of 2024.\n\nFormer Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack is reminiscing about his long-time connection to President Joe Biden at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago.\n\n\"I got started working in politics in 1986 working for then Sen. Biden, who was running for president. He said, ‘The penalty for not getting involved is that people less qualified than you end up governing you.' Oh my God, isn't that the truth?\" Vilsack said.\n\nVilsack, who served as Biden's U.S. Secretary of Agriculture, spoke Monday morning to the Minnesota delegates at the DNC. Biden is set to speak at the convention Monday night.\n\n\"He's a great man and he made an extraordinary decision, a decision, frankly, that the folks on the other side just could not comprehend that anybody would make, which is why they are in such chaos and so disorganized now. They just never, ever thought he would give up the most powerful position in the world for his country and his party. But that's the kind of guy he is,\" Vilsack said to applause.\n\nVilsack said he called the White House chief of staff the day after Biden's announcement to suggest Tim Walz would be a good running mate for Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\n\"I said, 'Here's why: First of all, the guy's really good with a quip.' Oh, was he ever,\" Vilsack said, and the Minnesotans laughed. \"'But secondly, he has an incredibly progressive record and he's not defensive about.'\"\n\nVilsack served two terms as Iowa's governor and left office in early 2007, when Democrats controlled the Iowa House and Senate.\n\nAn Iowa State University football player will wear a different number on his jersey this season in a show of support for a former player who’s undergoing treatment for a brain tumor.\n\nState Sen. Jack Whitver, a former starting wide receiver for the Cyclones, announced his diagnosis this spring. ISU football coach Matt Campbell invited Whitver and his family to join the team on the field this weekend.\n\n“He’s going through a really hard battle right now,” Campbell said. “It’s going to take all of us to rally around him.”\n\nCampbell said the player who will wear number 26 this season had the same journey Whitver did at ISU.\n\n“Started off as a walk-on, now one of the great leaders in our football program — and that’s Caleb Bacon.”\n\nBacon, who is from Lake Mills, is a linebacker who played in all 13 ISU games last season and made 60 tackles — the second most on the team.\n\nWhitver was on the Cyclone football team from 1999 to 2003 and finished his college career with five touchdowns and 96 career receptions. Whitver is currently the Republican leader in the Iowa Senate.\n\nA controlled blast took place in Sioux City Monday to start the demolition of a railroad bridge destroyed by floodwaters. In late June, a bridge owned by Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway partially collapsed into the Big Sioux River on the northwest side of Sioux City.\n\nCrews detonated 14 cutting charges on the South Dakota side of the river to break the 100-year-old bridge into three pieces Monday morning.\n\nAmy McBeth, director of public affairs for BNSF Railway, estimates once the bridge is removed, it will take nine months for a new, more modern bridge to take its place.\n\n“The community is still recovering from the impacts of that high historic water volume. So, the new pier will be deeper in footings to be able to withstand that moving forward.”\n\nAnother blast will happen in early September to remove the span on the Iowa side.\n\nWatch the video.\n\nHeat is the deadliest climate-driven disaster in the U.S. There have already been several reports of heat-related deaths this year in the Midwest and Great Plains. But experts say it’s likely that many more people die of heat than the numbers show.\n\nExtreme heat can cause all kinds of life-threatening health effects. Some are explicitly related to high temperatures, like heat stroke. But something like a heart attack spurred by heat can be harder to track.\n\nAlok Sengupta is an emergency medicine physician and Chief Medical Officer at Mercy Hospital in St. Louis.\n\n“If heat illness or heat exhaustion or heat stroke isn't listed as a cause, you're not going to know that that was a contributing factor. So, it's definitely underreported.”\n\nEven without a clear picture of the data, the National Weather Service says heat kills more people every year than hurricanes, tornadoes and floods.\n\nRead the full story from Harvest Public Media’s Kate Grumke.\n\nGov. Kim Reynolds is proposing giving monthly boxes of food to low-income families next summer instead of accepting federal food assistance through Summer EBT. Her plan mentions the possibility of using existing summer meal sites for distributing food.\n\nStory County Medical Center Foundation Coordinator Liz Zuercher used a new state grant to start three summer meal sites in Maxwell and Collins this year. Hospital employees and volunteers prepare a few days’ worth of breakfast and lunch that families can pick up for free.\n\n“It’s worked out really well. It’s great to see all the kids. We started with seven kids and now we have 71 signed up. So yeah, it’s gotten more and more over the summer.”\n\nZuercher said she’s still looking into Reynolds’ plan, but thinks it will take a lot of work for the state to distribute monthly food boxes.\n\n“I guess it’s wait and see right now. If the waiver is approved by the USDA, then a more complete description of the state’s program will have to be done so we know what we’re getting into as communities and on the local level.”\n\nA USDA spokesperson said they will review Iowa’s proposal, but added that Reynolds is asserting that the state knows better than families do about their own needs.\n\nRepublican lawmakers on the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee brought a hearing to the Iowa State Fair Friday to promote tax changes made during the Trump administration.\n\nMany parts of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act are set to expire at the end of next year, including an increase in the child tax credit and several deductions for individuals and small businesses.\n\nLana Pol told lawmakers she used a deduction on business expenses to grow the fleet of her Pella-based trucking business. Now that the deduction is set to expire, she said she’s more cautious.\n\n“We have had to implement a freeze on purchasing any new equipment. This is due to the uncertainty of the tax provisions at the end of 2025 and because of the increased cost of equipment.”\n\nThe Trump-era tax law has been criticized for making many individual and small business provisions temporary, while a cut to the corporate income tax rate is permanent.\n\nIowans who suffered property damage and loss in the tornadoes that hit Minden in April and Greenfield in May have until Aug. 23 to register for disaster assistance from FEMA.\n\nJohn Mills, an external affairs officer at FEMA, was in both communities after the tornadoes hit. He said the deadline next week doesn’t mean assistance will not be available after the cut off.\n\n“It’s important to be registered with FEMA before the deadlines, so after the deadline, help is still available. You can stay in touch with FEMA, call us, update us about what your family’s needs are, about what your individual needs are related to the disaster.”\n\nMills said FEMA can provide money that doesn’t have to be repaid for things like home repairs not covered by insurance, temporary housing and replacing personal items.\n\nMore information about applying for assistance is available online. People can also go to one of the FEMA disaster recovery centers operating in Greenfield and other communities affected by severe weather.\n\nEmergency repairs are underway to stabilize a flood-damaged trail in the Sioux City metro. The Iowa Department of Transportation estimates the total cost to fix a mile along the Big Sioux River and Interstate 29 at around $8 million.\n\nDuring a news conference Friday, DOT engineer Jessica Felix said the work is challenging.\n\n“The slope is so unstable, and as the Big Sioux recedes, we have scour damages that we cannot always see with the naked eye.”\n\nFelix said with flooding throughout northwest Iowa, people need to stay out of construction zones and not go around barricades. Violators could face a $10,000 fine and jail time.\n\nEmergency repairs are expected to be completed this fall, and Felix said part of the trail could reopen for pedestrians sometime next year.\n\nThe World Health Organization is declaring an international health emergency over mpox, formerly known as monkeypox. Though no cases have been reported in Iowa, Iowans are warned to be aware.\n\nBrian Simmons, an infection preventionist with Gundersen Health System, explained how mpox is transmitted and what it does.\n\n“Mpox is a virus that is spread either through close contact with family members or through sexual contact. It is a virus that can cause sores that we see on different parts of the body. It’s very similar to what smallpox might have looked like years ago.”\n\nSymptoms of mpox include: fever, headache, muscle aches and backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills, exhaustion and a rash or blisters. It can be fatal, especially a strain that’s appearing primarily in African nations.\n\n“The newer strain of mpox is more virulent than what the previous strain was that we saw a few years ago, that we actually saw around here in the United States, even around locally. Currently, the newer strain is mostly around or within the sub-Saharan African nations, such as Congo and so on.”\n\nThe WHO has only declared public health emergencies seven times, including for mpox in 2022. Across the U.S., more than 1,600 mpox cases have been reported this year, which is twice the number of cases seen by this time last year.\n\nSimmons said this virus shouldn’t be a big worry for the majority of Iowans.\n\n“For those that could have a high risk for mpox, they may want to consider a vaccine. That still is a way to combat against mpox transmission.”\n\nState health officials said a limited amount of mpox vaccines are available to eligible individuals in 13 Iowa counties: Black Hawk, Cerro Gordo, Des Moines, Dubuque, Johnson, Linn, Polk, Pottawattamie, Scott, Story, Washington, Webster and Woodbury.\n\nProviding digital copies of books to patrons can be difficult, with varying agreements and vendor — and patron — expectations.\n\nAnne Mangano, collections services coordinator at the Iowa City Public Library, said the licensing agreements for libraries to provide e-books or audio books on the popular library app Libby are expensive.\n\n“You may be able to get that copy on Amazon or Apple books for $12, $20. We're paying $65, we're paying $85, for audiobooks that can be $125 per copy. And we get those copies, sometimes for one year, sometimes for two years, sometimes for 24 checkouts, and then we have to repurchase it.”\n\nAfter the copy is purchased, and although it’s a digital copy, it can only go to one person at a time, just like a physical book. On top of that, the library may have to pay multiple times for popular titles or after a certain amount of time or checkouts have passed.\n\n“The publishers have set the terms and they've been a little bit upfront about it, in that if it's inconvenient to use it at your public library, you will be more compelled to buy it for yourself,” Mangano said.\n\nRead more from Natalie Dunlap.\n\nFranklin County Republican Central Committee Chair Larry Sailer is strongly condemning the content of flyers placed on the doors of Hispanic businesses in Hampton earlier this week.\n\n“To me, it’s a bit of a hate crime, and I just strongly condemn it. As chair of the Franklin County Republican Party, there’s just no room for this. It’s just a way to try to divide people, and that’s really not what we do now in small town, Iowa. We work pretty well together.”\n\nThe flyers read in part, “USA Illegal Immigrant Hunting Permit – No Bag Limit – Tagging Not Required.” At the bottom of the flyer, it reads, “Trump 2024.”\n\n“People know what’s going on. This poster didn’t do either party —any party — any good. Just not how we operate. We want to operate on the issues, have a discussion, talk to everybody,” Sailer said.\n\nGov. Kim Reynolds has rejected the Summer EBT program for this year and next year, which would’ve sent $29 million of grocery money to about 240,000 kids over the summer.\n\nShe’s asking the federal government to approve her plan to provide monthly food boxes to low-income families instead.\n\nReynolds says this would reach more kids, cost less than Summer EBT and promote nutrition to help fight childhood obesity. It’s not clear if the U.S. Department of Agriculture will approve the plan.\n\nIowa Hunger Coalition Chair Luke Elzinga says it’s not exactly what he hoped for, but he’s grateful the state is recognizing the rise in food insecurity.\n\n“We appreciate the state’s willingness to explore alternative options, but we also remain steadfast in our belief that using Summer EBT to provide grocery benefits directly to families is the best decision for Iowa.”\n\nElzinga says research shows that when parents have more money for food, they choose healthier options.\n\nRead more from IPR’s Katarina Sostaric.\n\nAugust is typically one of the hotter and drier growing months for corn and soybeans in northeast Iowa. So far, it’s been relatively mild.\n\nTwo weeks into the month, rainfall is about 3 inches below the total average for August, and temperatures have been below the roughly 80° average\n\nTerry Basol, a field agronomist with Iowa State Extension, said that’s great news for the region’s corn and soybeans because it helps keep them from maturing too quickly.\n\n“The higher the temperature you have, it increases the development of the crop because it just speeds things along. So, if we keep things at a lower temperature, like we are now, it’s perfect.”\n\nIf the weather stays this way, he said that could lead to a higher yield come harvest time.\n\n“What it does is it really helps lower that stress load on both the corn and the soybeans. Any time you have less stress on that crop, it allows them to basically reach their maximum potential for yield.”\n\nBasol added that the region’s subsoil moisture is 85% adequate thanks to a wet July.\n\nAfter a 12-day dig, the Office of the State Archaeologist unearthed the bones of a mastodon in Wayne County. A sample from the well-preserved skeleton dates it to about 13,600 years old, which is on the edge of when Native Americans would have come into south-central Iowa.\n\nWhile the contours of the skull may be eye-catching, State Archeologist John Doershuk said he was particularly excited about a 2-foot section of tusk recovered from the site. He called it a “goldmine” for answering all kinds of questions about the animal.\n\n“Apparently there are techniques now to determine how many calves a female mastodon had that get recorded as a chemical signature because of the changes in the body chemistry during the pregnancy and the birth. And that gets recorded in the tusks.”\n\nThe team didn’t find any stone tools near the bones. Doershuk said he is interested in whether analysis will reveal cut marks consistent with early human involvement.\n\n“The last glaciation probably still had the northern part of Iowa under ice. But the southern part was ice-free at the time and was starting to vegetate. Animals like mastodons were coming in to browse and human hunters would have also found that a hospitable place, as well.”\n\nTemporary housing for flood victims is now available on the Clay County fairgrounds in Spencer.\n\nKevin Robinson, deputy city manager in Spencer, said RVs have been set up in the camping area of the fairgrounds.\n\n\"There's one complete row of trailers in there right now — RV trailers — and then once all of those fill up, there's room to put another row to the east of that.\"\n\nIn mid-July, federal officials approved Iowa's request for FEMA's Temporary Housing Program, which can provide assistance to residents in counties that have been declared presidential disaster areas.\n\nSome of those property owners may be waiting to see if their home will be part of a buyout program. FEMA provides 75% of the money to buy homes and businesses in floodplain areas, and the state and city must provide the rest.\n\n\"The city will go through a process of determining which areas make sense to acquire, from a maintenance standpoint, from an adjacency standpoint to the river — there's lots of different variables.\"\n\nThe program has been used in several other Iowa cities in the past 30 years.\n\nOfficials in Cedar Rapids approved the first batch of 28 property buyouts 18 months after flooding in 2008 wrecked many areas of Cedar Rapids. Ultimately 1,400 properties were voluntarily sold, cleared and could not be redeveloped.\n\nNew data shows less than half of Iowa seniors 65 and older who are eligible for several public benefit programs are participating in them.\n\nThe National Council on Aging and the Urban Institute found 34% of eligible Iowa seniors are enrolled in the Medicare Savings Program, and 27% are enrolled in Supplemental Security Income. Just 17% are enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).\n\nJen Teague, director of health coverage and benefits with the National Council on Aging, said there are many reasons for this, including that many seniors may not know about the programs or how to sign up.\n\n“The other piece is that we often find people saying, ‘I don’t want to take a benefit from somebody else.’ And what we really want to encourage, what we want people to hear, is that these benefits are available for anyone who’s eligible — and it’s not taking it away from someone else.”\n\nThe data show Iowa fares worse than the national average for eligible senior enrollment in all three programs.\n\nOfficials in Okoboji have made temporary changes to a key ordinance to assist property owners dealing with significant erosion along the shore of West Okoboji Lake.\n\nCity Administrator Michael Meyers said it usually takes at least a month to get a lakeshore landscaping permit, but requirements for a public meeting and other administrative steps are being waived.\n\n“In the City of Okoboji, we had between ten and 15 just catastrophic lakeshore collapses. Recognizing the emergent situation that we were in, the city made a decision that having a month-long process was just too long.”\n\nProperty owners will still be required to get an engineer’s evaluation of the project and follow other zoning rules.\n\n“Those are all still intact. So, it’s not necessarily a blank slate for folks to do whatever they want, but it is an opportunity to make things go a heck of a lot quicker. Because for some of these landowners, time is not necessarily in their favor.”\n\nLake-adjacent properties in the City of Okoboji are in a zone where landowners are required to follow specific landscaping methods allowed in the ordinance.\n\n“The intent of the City of Okoboji’s lakeshore landscaping ordinance is really to make shorelines appear as before any of us were here. We’re really promoting native shoreline restorations, deep-rooted plants and just making sure that these lakeshores are really set up for success in the long term.”\n\nSome of the shoreline of both West Okoboji Lake and East Okoboji Lake are within the city limits, but Meyers said the majority of intense flood damage in Okoboji city limits has been along the West Okoboji Lake shoreline.\n\nAt the end of September, the University of Iowa’s sexual assault support service will close. By then, the Iowa City-based Domestic Violence Intervention Program (DVIP) said its new sexual assault support division serving the same eight-county area will be fully operational.\n\nFinding a new provider, securing necessary funding and hiring new staff have made for a long few months for the University of Iowa. Earlier this year, the university announced it would no longer offer support services and would “transition” those services to a community-based program.\n\nSarah Hansen, UI’s vice president of student life, said the university plans to directly fund the DVIP at a similar level to what it gave to the original provider — the Rape Victim Advocacy Program (RVAP).\n\n“We're funding two campus advocate positions. We've also, on campus, added a prevention position to the sexual assault prevention team. So, there's three positions there.”\n\nHansen said money donated to the original provider will be diverted directly to DVIP for sexual assault support services.\n\nRVAP’s final day of operation is Sept. 30.\n\nHampton police are investigating anti-immigrant signs posted on the doors of Latino-owned businesses early Tuesday morning in the north-central Iowa town.\n\nA photo shared on Facebook by the Hampton Chronicle shows a black-and-white sign that reads, “USA Illegal Immigrant Hunting Permit,” and below the permit image, the sign says, “Trump 2024.”\n\nJanette Acolt is development coordinator for La Luz Centro Cultural, a nonprofit in Hampton that serves the Latino community. She said one of the signs was posted to the nonprofit’s door, and then she found other businesses that were targeted with the same sign.\n\n“We’re very scared, just knowing how some people can get very riled up. We were scared that someone could come in. I mean, we have a lot of children’s programs here, so our program coordinator was also very scared.”\n\nAcolt said this was a hate crime and she wants justice. She said Latinos are important to Hampton and they’re not going anywhere.\n\nFranklin County Attorney Andrea Miller — who would determine any criminal charges — had no comment Wednesday morning. She said she is still waiting for the results of the police investigation.\n\nRead more.\n\nResidents of Linn County will begin receiving semi-annual property tax statements this week.\n\nLinn County Assessor Jerry Witt wants property owners to know about a couple of tax credits.\n\nPeople who were 65 or older at the first of the year qualify for a new homestead credit. A military exemption has also increased from just over $1,800 to $4,000.\n\nWitt said property owners have to apply for the credits, which will come in handy as home values continue to rise.\n\n“I’ve seen a lot of the numbers throughout the state, and I know for us, we’re looking at about a 7% or 8% increase in overall valuation, at least residential.”\n\nApplications for tax credits and exemptions for future tax cycles are available on the Iowa Department of Revenue website.\n\nA Democratic candidate for Iowa’s 2nd Congressional District said she would like to see a reversal of the state’s six-week abortion ban.\n\nSpeaking at The Des Moines Register’s Soapbox at the Iowa State Fair Tuesday, Sarah Corkery said she would work to overturn Iowa’s law that bans abortions when cardiac activity is detected.\n\n“We need to codify Roe v. Wade, first of all, and I truly believe all medical decisions should be between a person and a doctor — with no government involvement at all. So, we’ve got a long way to go from a six-week ban to making sure it’s just a protected health situation.”\n\nCorkery is a Cedar Falls native whose platform also includes increased funding for public schools and an expansion of alternative medicine, including legal marijuana.\n\nShe is challenging incumbent Republican Rep. Ashley Hinson in the district.\n\nThe Libertarian running for Congress in Iowa’s 3rd District said he plans to keep campaigning even if a state panel decides he is not eligible to stay on the ballot.\n\nMarco Battaglia is in a three-person race for the 3rd Congressional District seat currently held by Republican Rep. Zach Nunn.\n\nLast week, a pair of voters who are active Republicans filed a complaint to remove Battaglia from the ballot. They claim the Libertarian Party failed to hold required county conventions.\n\nBattaglia said the party instead held a state convention where county delegates broke off into separate meetings.\n\n“I don’t know what the mix-up is to be honest. I just know that I’m going to keep campaigning. I’m going to go to my town halls in every county in the district, regardless. If they take my name off the ballot, I’m going to say, ‘Write in Marco Battaglia.’ I’ll keep the promises I made to the people when I said I would go up there and represent them.”\n\nBattaglia spoke to reporters at the Iowa State Fair after appearing at The Des Moines Register Political Soapbox.\n\nSimilar complaints were filed against Libertarians running for Congress in the 1st and 4th Districts.\n\nThe State Objection Panel, which includes the Iowa secretary of state, state auditor and attorney general, is planning to hold a hearing on the issue later this month.\n\nRead more.\n\nLibertarian Nicholas Gluba said his priorities, if elected to represent Iowa’s 1st Congressional District, would include rebalancing the branches of government and banning eminent domain for private gain.\n\nAt The Des Moines Register Political Soapbox at the Iowa State Fair, Gluba said the president and executive branch shouldn’t have the authority to write their own laws without action by the legislative branch.\n\n“That effectively makes the president in the United States a king. We fought against the king back in 1776. We won. We need to do it again. We need to win that war again and make sure a king can’t control the United States of America ever again.”\n\nGluba said he would also sign onto a bill to ban the use of eminent domain for projects that benefit corporations.\n\nHe also criticized challenges that were filed to keep him and two other Libertarian congressional candidates off the ballot. Gluba said Libertarians will defeat those challenges and appear on the ballot in November.\n\nRead more.\n\nDemocrat Lanon Baccam believes his background serving in the military and at the U.S. Department of Agriculture will attract rural, independent voters in Iowa’s closely contested 3rd Congressional District.\n\nBaccam served for eight years in the Iowa Army National Guard. At The Des Moines Register Political Soapbox at the Iowa State Fair Monday, he explained it was hard to convince his parents to let him enlist. They resettled in Iowa in the 1980s as refugees from war-torn Vietnam.\n\n“To eventually come to this country, and for their son to serve in the military, they were terrified for what that would mean if we ever went to war. But I knew it was my time to go, and I did.”\n\nBaccam deployed to Afghanistan in 2004 with a combat engineering unit. He is running against incumbent Republican Rep. Zach Nunn, who is a veteran of the Air Force and Iowa National Guard. Nunn spoke at the fair on Friday.\n\nThe 3rd District includes the Des Moines area, as well as much of south central and southwestern Iowa.\n\nRepresentatives from the Iowa Hunger Coalition met with state officials to convince Gov. Kim Reynolds to participate in the Summer EBT program next year.\n\nThe program provides an extra $120 in summertime federal food assistance for each child who qualified for free or reduced-price lunch at school. Reynolds cited administrative costs when she turned down the federal funds for this summer’s program.\n\nLuke Elzinga, a spokesman for the coalition, said the USDA announced it will provide grants to states to cover technology expenses associated with the benefits.\n\n“There’s also a free online application that’s been developed that USDA is allowing states to use, so some of those administrative expenses might be addressed. And, again, almost a quarter of a million kids throughout the state of Iowa could benefit from this.”\n\nElzinga works for the Des Moines Area Religious Council food pantries, which saw record use in July. He said food pantries in the state are overwhelmed.\n\n“We absolutely think Summer EBT would help relieve some of the strain, not just on families across Iowa, but on food banks, food pantries and other service providers,” Elzinga said. “This is the case in urban areas, small towns, the suburbs. People are really struggling right now.”\n\nThe Iowa Hunger Coalition delivered a petition to the governor’s office this week that was signed by over 3,500 Iowans urging Reynolds to accept the extra federal funding next summer.\n\nThe number of exhibitors in dairy cattle shows at this year’s Iowa State Fair is nearly identical to last year, despite new bird flu testing requirements for milking cows entered in the contests.\n\n“There was definitely an increased number of heifers. At some of the farms, their heifers happened to be on a different location and didn’t have to be tested if they didn’t have cows in that location,” Mike Eilers, the superintendent for dairy cattle at the Iowa State Fair, said. “But there still was roughly 120 to 130 cows here at the show, which is pretty good given all they had to go through with the testing and stuff.”\n\nEilers grew up on a dairy farm and showed Guernsey cattle, but has what he describes as an office job now. For the past decade, he’s been managing the State Fair dairy shows to stay connected to the industry and make sure kids, in particular, have a place to showcase their work.\n\n“Just to be able to come here and compete, to see the quality of the animals they have and compare it to everybody else in the state and the other animals — and just to meet and hang out,” Eilers said. “There’s a lot of families and kids from all over the state that get to become friends just because they come to the fair.”\n\nMike and Rhonda Guy of Newton were in the State Fair Livestock Pavilion this weekend watching their granddaughter show her Brown Swiss heifer in the youth dairy show.\n\n“The value of this is tremendous. It teaches them a work ethic,” Mike Guy said. “It’s nice to see them do things that we did, as well — carry on a tradition, to some extent.”\n\nGuy and his brother shut down their milking operation about 20 years after deciding they either had to expand or get out of the dairy business. According to the latest data from the USDA, there were about a thousand dairy farms in Iowa in 2022.\n\nThe Libertarian candidate running in Iowa’s 4th Congressional District said he disagrees with Iowa’s six-week abortion ban.\n\nCharles Aldrich said even though he does agree with the Supreme Court’s decision to give states the power to enact abortion laws, it comes down to upholding personal rights.\n\n“The government is interfering with a person and their caregiver. They shouldn't be doing that. It's out of the purview of the state.”\n\nAldrich, an engineer from Clarion, made his comment to reporters after appearing at The Des Moines Register Political Soapbox at the Iowa State Fair on Sunday.\n\nAldrich is running against incumbent Republican Rep. Randy Feenstra and Democrat Ryan Melton in the 4th Congressional District, which covers the western border of Iowa and the cities of Ames, Fort Dodge and Marshalltown.\n\nA complaint was filed to keep Libertarian congressional candidates in Iowa off the November ballot. The issue is expected to be resolved during a hearing with state officials. Aldrich said he isn’t concerned about the challenge.\n\nThe Democrat running for Congress in Iowa’s 4th District said incumbent Rep. Randy Feenstra is vilifying immigrants.\n\nFeenstra, the two-term Republican, has said that securing the southern border is the number one concern of people living in the district, which covers Iowa's western border and includes Ames, Fort Dodge and Marshalltown.\n\nRyan Melton, who took part in The Des Moines Register’s Soapbox at the Iowa State Fair Sunday, said immigrants are being used as scapegoats when there is no proof that they commit more crimes than native-born citizens.\n\n“We should want people that are willing to put their lives on the line to give their kids a better life. So, this narrative about immigrants and invasion and threat is wrong. It's shameful, and eventually, it's going to lead to people getting hurt.”\n\nFeenstra introduced the Build the Wall and Fight Fentanyl Act in Congress last year. Melton said the vast majority of fentanyl that comes into the country arrives through legal ports of entry by U.S. citizens and that building a wall is a “kindergarten solution” for a complicated issue.\n\nThe Libertarian candidate for president, Chase Oliver, said one of the main reasons purchases ranging from groceries to homes continue to get more expensive is deficit spending by the federal government. Oliver made his comments Saturday at The Des Moines Register’s Political Soapbox at the Iowa State Fair.\n\n“It’s because the government is making our dollar worth less and less and less each year, because they run deficit spending to the tune of trillions of dollars. And they have to print money to make up for that. What that does is it devalues the dollars in your pocket.”\n\nChase told a small crowd gathered for his speech that the rising prices amount to a “hidden tax” on Americans. He pledged to veto any unbalanced budget Congress might send him. The U.S. hasn’t had a balanced federal budget since the Clinton administration.\n\nOliver is on the ballot in about three dozen states. The latest NPR/PBS/Marist poll shows him with less than 1% support among likely voters.\n\nRead more.\n\nDemocratic 1st Congressional District candidate Christina Bohannan criticized her opponent’s record on abortion and immigration at the Iowa State Fair on Saturday.\n\nDuring a speech at The Des Moines Register Political Soapbox, Bohannan said Republican U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks refused to support a bipartisan border security bill earlier this year.\n\nBohannan said unlike Miller-Meeks, she would vote to put abortion rights protections under Roe v. Wade into federal law.\n\n“She has sold out Iowa women. As we stand here today, Iowa now has one of the strictest abortion bans in the country. And there’s a lot of blame to go around, plenty of it on this ban, but in a lot of important ways, this is Mariannette Miller-Meeks’ abortion ban.”\n\nMiller-Meeks wasn’t in the Iowa Legislature when the six-week abortion ban was passed, but she supported a total abortion ban at the national level.\n\nMiller-Meeks is not scheduled to speak at the Soapbox this year.\n\nRead more.\n\nRep. Zach Nunn, a Republican from Iowa’s 3rd District, said undocumented immigrants coming into the U.S. is the most \"clear, direct threat” to the country.\n\nSpeaking from The Des Moines Register Political Soapbox at the Iowa State Fair Friday, Nunn said border security is the number one thing he hears about when touring his district.\n\nHe said every county has become a border county, as some Iowans have died of fentanyl overdose. Nunn said the border must be secured before Congress considers immigration reform.\n\n\"Eight million illegals coming into our country is a direct threat to our nation. In fact, I think there’s no more clear, direct threat to our country.”\n\nFederal officials say fentanyl is often brought from Mexico through border crossings in cars driven by U.S. citizens.\n\nNunn is running for a second two-year term in the U.S. House of Representatives. He is facing Democratic challenger Lanon Baccam, who is scheduled to speak at the fair on Monday.\n\nRead more.\n\nTwo of the most popular trails in Iowa – Raccoon River Valley and High Trestle – will officially connect on Saturday with a celebratory bike ride and ribbon cutting.\n\nThe new trail extension between Woodward and Perry creates a nearly continuous 120-mile paved loop for bikers, runners and walkers.\n\nAndrea Boulton is the trails and community conservation director for the Iowa Natural Heritage Foundation, which has been working on Rails to Trails projects for more than 40 years.\n\nBoulton said developing long-distance, destination trails gets more people outdoors.\n\n“As they’re doing that, they’re discovering new places, new restaurants, new stores, new parks and places that they’ve never been to before. And they’re realizing they can make a whole vacation out of it.”\n\nA 2012 study found cyclists and trails generate over $360 million in direct and indirect economic impacts on the state. A new study is underway.\n\nRead more.\n\nA new Iowa law that went into effect in July has given county supervisors the option to control elected officials’ wages more directly.\n\nThe law allows counties to reestablish or disband their compensation boards, and Black Hawk County has voted for the latter.\n\nThe compensation board has overseen county elected officials’ wages in some form since 1975. The change means that county supervisors will take on the task of setting wages themselves come budget time.\n\nBlack Hawk County Auditor Grant Veeder said that could lead to substantial wage swings in the future.\n\n“If they really took this seriously and said, ‘OK, we’re going to check these salaries for comparable positions around the state, and then we’re going to find out it looks like people for these kinds of jobs get paid a lot more, so we’re going to pay our elected officials a lot more.’ That could happen.”\n\nAt least 18 other counties are considering reestablishing compensation boards.\n\nA federal appeals court ruled Friday that Iowa’s law banning books with sexual content from school libraries can take effect.\n\nThe law also prohibits instruction about sexual orientation and gender identity before seventh grade. Those provisions were challenged in two lawsuits and were blocked by a court from late December until now.\n\nA three-judge panel from the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the temporary injunction and said the lawsuits can continue in U.S. district court.\n\nIowa Attorney General Brenna Bird called the ruling a victory.\n\n“Parents will no longer have to fear what their kids have access to in schools when they are not around.”\n\nJoshua Brown, president of the Iowa State Education Association, which was one of the groups challenging the law, said he is disappointed in the decision. Brown said banning books is a burden for educators and students, who “are deprived of reading from great authors with valuable stories.”\n\nThis upcoming school year is the third one where Des Moines Public Schools will offer free breakfast and lunch to all of its 30,000 students, regardless of their family income.\n\nThe program is funded through the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Community Eligibility Provision for school districts that serve predominantly low-income families.\n\nDMPS Director of Food and Nutrition Services Amanda Miller said offering all students free meals takes away the stigma faced by low-income students.\n\n“We used to have to worry about parents putting money in their account, and then what do you do if they if there's a negative balance? And so that is all gone,” Miller said. “We're allowing people to come in and to have a safe space to eat meals.”\n\nMiller said the district hopes to continue this program indefinitely.\n\nThe crowd at the “Big Boar” competition roared as this year’s winner weighed in and Swine Barn Superintendent Ernie Barnes announced the result. “1,420 pounds,” Barnes said, and his congratulations that followed were drowned out by the cheers, whoops and applause of those watching.\n\nThe winner is 120 pounds heavier than the previous record set by a boar from Indianola.\n\n“I won in ’19 and then in ’21 as well, and we were close to the record, but I really had my goal set for the record,” Bryan Britt of Monticello said. “Back home, I’m known as ‘the big boar guy.’”\n\nBritt, who is Irish, called the boar Finnegan for good luck.\n\n“I’m a pork producer and I’ve been raising pigs all my life. I’ve raised this guy since birth. For me to break that record, it’s really nice. I couldn’t believe that he was that much heavier.”\n\nWhile some of the bulked-up boars in these types of competitions eat things like donuts and drink milk in addition to about 20 pounds of feed a day, Britt said Finnegan is a “finicky eater.” Britt is keeping the ingredients in Finnegan’s standard ratios a bit of a trade secret.\n\n“I picked him out at birth, thinking he had a big skeleton. You’ve got to feed them right to get them to this size. It just doesn’t happen overnight.”\n\nFinnegan is three years old and has a taste for what’s sometimes called the “Irish champagne.”\n\n“I’ve given him a Guinness and he seems to like that,” Britt said, with a laugh, adding that he likes a pint of his own on occasion.\n\nThere were six other contestants in this year’s “Big Boar” competition at the State Fair. Britt’s boar weighed nearly 400 pounds more than his closest competitor.\n\nFinnegan will spend the next ten days in the Swine Barn at the Iowa State Fair, then due to biosecurity measures to prevent the spread of disease, Finnegan won’t return to Britt’s operation. He will spend the rest of his days on another farm nearby.\n\nWhen middle and high school students return to Gehlen Catholic School in Le Mars in a few weeks, they will be facing a new “no cell phone” policy.\n\nPrincipal Bryan Paulson said they’ve tried restricting cell phone use in the past, but it just wasn’t working.\n\n“Each classroom in grades seven through 12 had a cell phone holder, and the kids were to turn their cell phones in to the holders with the teachers, and then they would get the cell phones back at the end of class. Some students were just leaving them in their pockets. They were trying to just leave them in their bags. Cell phones were a big distraction in the hallways in between classes.”\n\nThe policy going into effect this fall will force all students to surrender their devices upon entering the building.\n\n“When the students get here in the morning, they will come to our center meeting area, and we actually have cell phone lockers. If you talk to the kids, they call them ‘jails,’ but there’s an actual case. Each kid will be assigned a slot to put their cell phone and their devices into, and then they’ll go off to class for the day, and we’ll lock those up.”\n\nUnder the plan, phones will be passed back out to students in the final five or so minutes of the day. Paulson said cell phone use by students was having a negative impact on their behavior and attitudes toward learning, and some weren’t engaged in the classroom.\n\n“Students were rushing through their tests just so they could get on their phone. We had a couple of teachers tell us if they saw one student go on their phone, other students would start to wonder what they were doing on their phone, if they were Snapping, if they were missing something on TikTok. So, we kind of saw their anxiety rise.”\n\nThere will be exceptions to the policy for students who need their phones during the day to contact a parent or to go to a doctor’s appointment. Paulson said Gehlen Catholic parents are urged to discuss the matter and the new policy with their children.\n\nMany Iowa homeowners are seeing their insurance premiums rise, and some companies are refusing to insure some properties altogether.\n\nSonya Sellmeyer, a consumer advocacy officer in the Iowa Insurance Division, said there have been a series of rate increases since the derecho that hit Iowa in August of 2020.\n\n“It just seems like ever since then, we’ve just continued to get hit by storms. It costs a lot of money to repair that damage, for many different reasons — inflation, material costs have gone up, the reinsurance that the companies themselves have has gone up for them.”\n\nReinsurance is essentially insurance for insurance companies.\n\nSellmeyer said Iowans facing a significant hike in homeowners’ insurance could consider a higher deductible if it’s an amount they can afford. Sellmeyer encouraged Iowans to have a discussion with their licensed insurance agent to ensure their policy would cover the cost of replacing their home and its contents.\n\n“You don’t want to be paying something — especially as it becomes more expensive — that’s not going to give you what you really need to replace your home in case something would happen. And understand your riders that you have, too, on your policy or that you may need. Sump pump and sewer riders are very important.”\n\nFlooding is the most common and costly natural disaster in the U.S. There has been a federal flood insurance program since the 1960s for properties in a flood plain and a federal rule change in 2019 encouraged private companies to sell flood insurance policies.\n\nSellmeyer said you can buy private flood insurance in Iowa even if your property is not in a flood plain.\n\n“I spent a weekend in Spencer, shortly after the flooding happened, with those survivors there and I strongly suggest all Iowans need to sit down with their insurance agent and see if this is something that they need.”\n\nAccording to the National Association of Realtors, home insurance premiums in the U.S. are expected to rise about 6% on average nationwide by the end of the year.\n\nThe attorneys general from Iowa, Nebraska and nine other states are asking the Environmental Protection Agency to make it clear there’s a national standard for labeling Roundup and other weed killers that contain glyphosate.\n\nDuring a news conference this morning in Omaha, Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird said a new EPA rule is needed because California has proposed cancer warnings on Roundup and other products that contain the world’s most commonly used herbicide.\n\n“If we don’t stop it now…the glyphosate situation — that is just the tip of the iceberg,” Bird said. “There will be other things that states like California try to do to tell our farmers how to farm and that future will make it very hard for farmers to be able to grow their crops, which is what it’s all about. Food does not come from a grocery store. It comes from a farm.”\n\nThe EPA has said glyphosate is not likely to cause cancer in humans and in November, a federal appeals court ruled in favor of Monsanto — the maker of Roundup — and said California did not have authority to require a cancer warning on Roundup’s label. Bird said it’s time for the EPA “to set things straight.”\n\n“Farmers have a lot to deal with…sometimes low crop prices, high input prices, natural disasters,” Bird said. “They shouldn’t have to worry about the types of things that are happening in other states on the coasts to figure out how they’re going to make their family farm work.”\n\nKevin Ross, a farmer from Underwood and former president of the National Corn Growers Association, said there is no real substitute for glyphosate.\n\n“It’s been one of the most tested chemicals ever on the marketplace, and it’s known to be safe and very effective,” Ross said, “so EPA — set the regulations, do your job in DC and let us farmers do our job on the ground here in the U.S.”\n\nMonsanto’s attorneys have argued that a warning label on Roundup violates the company’s First Amendment right to be free from compelled speech that it disagrees with. This spring, the Iowa Senate passed a bill to block lawsuits against farm chemical companies based on how the products are labeled, but it stalled in the House. Similar bills were introduced in other states. Monsanto, now owned by Bayer, has settled about 100,000 lawsuits, and the company estimates there are more than 50,000 pending.\n\nA Colorado-based company will soon begin testing in Carroll County as it searches for hydrogen trapped underground. Scientists say natural hydrogen could be a source of clean energy.\n\nChris Justice, a representative of Twin Rivers Exploration, says a truck that’s a little smaller than a garbage truck is used for what they call “vibro-seismic” testing.\n\n“It has a plate, maybe three feet in diameter. It gently lowers this plate to the ground and then it will shake and send kind of a vibration through the ground,” he says. “We place sensors along the road that will pick up the signals of how these vibrations bounce off of different geologic formations, which will allow us to map out underground formations.”\n\nTwin Rivers Exploration recently completed land surveys in Webster County, and the company has mapped out a five-mile-square grid to survey, with the small Carroll County town of Lidderdale at its center. Scientists say when iron-rich rocks come into contact with water deep underground, hydrogen is generated, and the hydrogen can get trapped under a dome.\n\n“The hydrogen should come out of the ground on its own. Hydrogen, being a gas, it should flow out freely,” Justice says. “What you’d be looking at is about a five foot tall wellhead that sits on about a five acre pad.”\n\nThere’s only one well in the world currently collecting natural hydrogen from underground and it’s in Mali, a country on the west side of the African continent. Drilling for hydrogen is underway in Europe, South America and in Nebraska and Kansas. Justice says there would be a fairly large boost to the local economy if his company finds underground hydrogen in Carroll County.\n\n“Depending on the quantity, we would probably use it for ammonia to help make fertilizer. Hydrogen is a major component of ammonia that is right now created through very expensive means, so it would help the fertilizer industry quite a bit,” Justice says. “If we found it in greater quantities there could be applications in electricity and, in enormous quantities, even transportation.”\n\nJustice says the company’s trucks should arrive in Carroll County around Aug. 19 and crews should complete their work in the area by the end of the month. The trucks will move at a one-mile-per-hour pace and the company will have people redirecting traffic, if necessary.\n\nThe Des Moines City Council is scheduled to meet later this month, when they’ll likely cast a third and final vote on amended ordinances that affect unhoused people. The new laws would ban sleeping in public spaces and cut the amount of time given to remove belongings from city property.\n\nMark Stringer, executive director of the Iowa Chapter of the ACLU, opposes the proposed laws.\n\n“To push forward this ordinance, which basically penalizes unhoused people for having to sleep and having to find a place to live…that’s just inhumane. The solution’s not to pass more draconian laws that harass and fine people with no resources, but to focus on better access to shelters and programs that can help these people so they don’t remain homeless.”\n\nStringer called these laws inhumane for focusing on getting homeless people out of sight.\n\n“The through-line seemed to be the homeless don’t make Des Moines look good. And that’s not the basis of policy like this, not when we’re talking about real humans. We’re not talking about imaginary people. We’re talking about people with lives, and they just can’t be discarded like this.”\n\nSupporters of the ordinances say they’ll compel unhoused people to seek services. During last Monday's Council meeting Mayor Connie Boesen said Des Moines shelters have been getting people from as far away as Waterloo and Osceola, and said other communities need to do more to address their unhoused populations.\n\nAs students prepare to start classes in about two weeks, a nonprofit in a rural Iowa county has already passed out 160 school bags with supplies to students. Community Resources In Service to People, or CRISP, is a nonprofit in Madison County that serves families experiencing homelessness through emergency grants and resource matching.\n\nDirector Kathleen Rush says a lack of affordable housing and emergency shelters in the area makes it harder to find long-term housing.\n\n“Sometimes families will have other friends and family they can stay with temporarily. We have helped people find housing in hotels or motels. We have made referrals to Des Moines shelters. We’ve helped pay for tents and campers.”\n\nRush says poverty looks different for each family and there is no one-size-fits-all approach.\n\nShe says most families find CRISP through local school districts or word of mouth.\n\n“There is sometimes some hesitation. So, people have to be ready to receive help and sometimes it’ll start small, like a coat and that will lead into other programming as it becomes available.”\n\nOther programming includes a winter clothing drive and Christmas gifts drive. Rush says CRISP keeps in touch with families through newsletters and check-ins. CRISP services are open to any Madison County family with children under 18 years old.\n\nThe state of Iowa hasn’t issued permits yet for school employees to carry guns on school property under a new law. It’s also still not clear if public schools will be able to arm staff without risking the loss of insurance.\n\nRepublican lawmakers passed the new law this year, allowing school staff to get a professional permit to carry a firearm on school property, which school boards would have to approve.\n\nSchools were already allowed to arm staff, but two districts that chose to do so ended up reversing their policies after their insurance carrier said their coverage wouldn’t be renewed. The new law was meant to address the insurance issues.\n\nThe Iowa Department of Public Safety says that’s because the administrative rules for implementing the law won’t be in effect for about two more months. They’re open for public comment through Aug. 13.\n\nAs for insurance coverage, the company that covers the majority of school districts still isn’t saying publicly if it’ll cover schools that arm staff.\n\nA spokesperson for EMC Insurance says, “We are analyzing the new law and its implications as we continue to evaluate options in this evolving marketplace.”\n\nRead more from Katarina Sostaric.\n\nIt’s been a big year for bad weather in Iowa and State Climatologist Justin Glisan says there’s a new record in a undesirable category — most tornadoes in a single year.\n\n“We’re about 127 tornadoes across the state, and that beats the record that was set back in 2004 with 121 tornadoes, and our season’s not over yet,” Glisan says. “So it’s been a very active severe weather season, with hail, high winds, we’ve had a derecho, but then all these tornadoes as well.”\n\nTornadoes can strike during any month of the year, even during the wintertime. In 2021, Iowa had a record 63 tornadoes in a single day — in December. That was during the state’s second derecho in as many years, and that December outbreak set another record for most EF-2 tornadoes in one day — at 21.\n\nAs for the month ahead, Glisan says August promises to be something of a rollercoaster as far as temperatures.\n\n“Look at those short term outlooks that get us six to ten days out, so in the middle of the month, and they are showing a cooler signal, at least initially,” Glisan says, “Then you look at eight- to 14-day highlights, we’re getting into the third week of August, that’s where we see a slightly elevated signal for warmer temperatures coming back in.”\n\nRainfall should be about average for August, though Glisan notes July rainfall was nothing close to average.\n\n“Particularly in eastern Iowa, we saw rainfall totals 150 - 200% of normal, so you’re thinking two to three inches above,” Glisan says. “Overall across the state, about five and a half inches, preliminarily, and that’s about 1.3 inches above average.”\n\nJuly goes into the books as the 6th wettest July on record for Iowa.\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley is sharing his initial impressions of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz — Vice President Kamala Harris’ pick for a running mate.\n\n“Well, I don’t have any opinion of him,” Grassley said Tuesday morning, “and I realize now that I’ve learned that he served ten years in U.S. House, but I don’t remember any interaction with him.”\n\nWalz served in the House from 2007 to 2019 and was a member of the House Agriculture Committee. Grassley said it’s unusual that he didn’t work with Walz on anything agriculture or ethanol-related in all of those years, especially since they’re from neighboring states. Grassley, a Republican, said he’s done some research on Walz.\n\n“He has changed from being a moderate congressman to being a very liberal, progressive-agenda governor in Minnesota,” Grassley said, “particularly since the Legislature in Minnesota has switched to both houses being Democrat.”\n\nGrassley says voters will have a very clear choice in November between the Trump-Vance and Harris-Walz tickets.\n\n“There’s a whole long list of very liberal pieces of legislation that he’s advocated and has signed,” Grassley said of Walz, “and so that turnaround from somebody that’s moderate to somebody really progressive would kind of surprise me, that he’d have that change of mind.”\n\nWalz was born and raised in Nebraska, served 24 years in the Army National Guard, and worked as a high school social studies teacher before turning to politics. He’s been Minnesota’s governor since 2019.\n\nIowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart released a written statement after the Harris campaign announced Walz would be the vice presidential nominee. Hart said Walz “is a great candidate who understands Midwest principles, how hard Iowans work and the value of a dollar.”\n\nIowans for Tax Relief President Chris Hagenow is optimistic Iowa lawmakers will be open to making changes next year in a tax break for big corporations. It’s called the research activities tax credit and it’s refundable, which means the state is required to cut the corporation a check for any amount above what the company owes in taxes.\n\nHagenow said the latest data from the State of Iowa shows John Deere received over $19 million in tax credits for research activities last year.\n\nJohn Deere was the state’s largest recipient of Iowa’s research activities tax credit in 2023. Hagenow said Iowans may find that worrisome, given recent layoffs at Deere facilities in Iowa, as well as the company’s plan to build a plant in Mexico.\n\n“We generally support a flatter, fairer tax code for everyone without carve-outs for anyone. With regard to John Deere, then, being the biggest recipient of those credits, it really makes it much more difficult to take.”\n\nIn tax year 2023, about 350 corporations filed for the state research activities tax credit, with claims totaling $77 million. Hagenow, a former Republican lawmaker, said he hears from small business owners who cannot qualify for this kind of a “lucrative subsidy.”\n\n“I think Iowans instinctively know a lot of these incentives are there and they’re not always fairly applied.”\n\nThe 1984 Iowa Legislature created the research activities credit. Businesses may receive a credit worth up to 6.5% of the company’s annual budget for research. Backers of the credit said it keeps companies in Iowa that are doing high-value research with highly paid staff.\n\nAccording to a state report, the salaries paid to employees who do research accounted for 56.5% of the total amount of the tax credits awarded last year.\n\nThe third edition of the Refocus Film Festival takes place Oct. 17-20 in downtown Iowa City. On Tuesday, the festival announced its opening night film selection, which will play at the Englert Theatre on Oct. 17.\n\nThe festival, which is rooted in celebrating the art of adaptation, will open with Nightbitch, a comedy horror film starring Amy Adams. It is based on the 2021 novel by Iowa City author Rachel Yoder, who is an assistant professor of cinematic arts at the University of Iowa.\n\nThe story was written for the screen and directed by Marielle Heller, who previously directed the Oscar-nominated films A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood and Can You Ever Forgive Me?\n\nAhead of their programming reveal party Tuesday night, the festival’s executive director, Andrew Sherburne, said they are thrilled to present Yoder’s novel adaptation to the Iowa City community.\n\n“One of this festival’s guiding principles is celebrating Iowa’s incredible contributions to the world\n\nof storytelling. There’s no better way to honor Iowa City’s artistic talent than by showcasing the cinematic adaptation of Rachel’s electric novel Nightbitch. We’re so excited to see this on the big screen.”\n\nPreviously, the festival announced guitarist Marc Ribot’s appearance at a live score event for the 1924 silent Soviet film Aelita: Queen of Mars.\n\nRefocus Film Festival will announce the remaining films and events for the 2024 program at a later date. Passes to attend the festival are available for purchase online.\n\nThe 49 Iowans who are delegates to the Democratic National Convention voted electronically for Vice President Kamala Harris as the party’s presidential nominee.\n\nC.J. Petersen is one of those delegates and the designated “whip” to round up votes in the group. Peterson spoke during an online gathering of Iowa Democrats.\n\n“We were all elected as Biden delegates, but we knew that we had to make a decision. And the moment we unanimously voted to unite behind Vice President Harris felt historic to me, because not only were we doing something we were not obligated to do — we could vote for anyone that we wanted to — but it was unprecedented in modern history.”\n\nPetersen made his comments during an online gathering of Iowa Democrats on Monday.\n\n“Giving up power willingly after a lifetime of service is a stunning act of selflessness and patriotism and I want to say ‘Thank you’ one more time to Joe Biden for passing the torch.”\n\nThe 2024 DNC takes place in Chicago Aug. 19-22. There, Harris and her newly-selected running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, will officially accept the presidential nomination.\n\nThe state auditor said his office has identified another significant instance of embezzlement in a small Iowa town.\n\nA new report from Auditor Rob Sand alleges former Delhi City Clerk Lori Tucker misused $80,000 in taxpayer funds. The vast majority was in the form of excess wages, unused vacation and payments to a health insurance savings account.\n\n“This is another example of why it's important for governmental entities to have policies in place and procedures in place that allow for and encourage proper oversight of your tax dollars.”\n\nSand said the Iowa Legislature has an opportunity to potentially deter future misuses of taxpayer money.\n\n“If we want to see less embezzlement of tax dollars across the state of Iowa, we are years past-due for the Legislature to make it a mandatory prison sentence, period. I’ve been asking them to do that since I was first elected in 2018 and they still haven’t done it.”\n\nTucker is currently the city clerk of nearby Ryan, and Sand confirmed that Ryan was also under investigation. Sand said his office’s report has been forwarded to the county attorney and Attorney General’s office for potential criminal charges.\n\nSeveral Midwestern states are working to restore oxbows. These u-shaped remnants of meandering rivers and streams provide critical habitat for dozens of bird and fish species. They also store floodwater.\n\nA recent study shows oxbows can remove around 60% of nitrate in water flowing from farm fields to streams and rivers.\n\nKaren Wilke, associate director of fresh water for The Nature Conservancy of Iowa, said it’s natural for oxbows to fill in with sediment over time. But this process has sped up since European settlement.\n\n“Nature wants to get back to nature, right? So, we kind of just help it along its way, and it does its own thing.”\n\nAfter removing sediment and seeding the perimeter to prevent weeds and erosion, Wilke said the water, aquatic plants and wildlife tend to come back on their own.\n\nExperts say not every oxbow needs to be restored, but there’s plenty of work to be done. An average prairie stream can have more than 400 oxbows.\n\nRead more from Harvest Public Media’s Rachel Cramer.\n\nA 77-year-old University of Iowa physics professor was killed, and four others were injured, in a four-vehicle crash in eastern Iowa early Sunday evening.\n\nThe accident happened on Highway 1, near Solon. According to the Iowa State Patrol’s accident report, the driver of a Jeep Cherokee failed to stop at a stop sign, crashed through a camper and hit an SUV on the driver’s side.\n\nUsha Mallik, an emeritus professor of physics at the University of Iowa, was driving that third vehicle and died at the scene. A fourth vehicle was hit by debris from the camper.\n\nThe driver of the first vehicle was flown to University of Iowa Hospitals. A one-year-old child, a woman from Cedar Rapids and a man from Paris, France, were taken by ambulance to the same hospital in Iowa City.\n\nThe professor who died in the accident has been involved in research at CERN, the world’s largest particle physics laboratory. In 2020, Mallik received a University of Iowa award for being a mentor to students and faculty, as well as her service to the global “high energy physics” community.\n\nFor more than a month now, some Iowa airports have not been reporting their temperature readings and dew points because their systems are disabled.\n\nIt’s information that’s very helpful to pilots, and they’re having to go without — for now — as are weather forecasters and anyone else who might like to access those hourly measurements.\n\nIowa DOT Aviation Director Tim McClung explained what’s going on.\n\n“When we have a temperature sensor that goes down on our aviation weather systems across the state, we’re no longer allowed to just notify pilots that, ‘Hey, the temperature readings are out of tolerance right now.’ We’re now being required to disable that temperature sensor.”\n\nDue to the new federal regulations, the sensors at nine Iowa airports are down, including those at Carroll, Denison, Creston, Clarion and Webster City. McClung said the Iowa DOT is addressing the situation.\n\n“We’re doing our very best to try to circle around and get a larger inventory of sensors and get our technicians out there to get those replaced. This will be a rolling situation for likely the next several months until it cools down.”\n\nMcClung said there is no danger to aircraft from the disabled sensors.\n\nThe DOT said Iowa has 104 public-owned airports, including eight commercial s"
