Jennifer with her duties as honorary page (NEWS Photo by Marc Blanchette) Health care education key issues Lawmakers from A1 still adjusting to his new role in the Legislature though a veteran of the intense cost-cutting special session in November which adjourn until 4 am Dec 1 wish things would move a little faster but everyone feels that way\" said Carr a longtime guidance counselor at Hermon High School understand how the process works but not a quick Carr was elected in a special election in November to finish the term of the late Rep Robert Yack-obitz R-Hermon who died in September So far Carr said he has been impressed by the leaders of both parties at the State House I As for pending issues Carr said may have a problem with the federal government cutting Carr has been assigned to the Legal and Veterans Affairs 'Committee The other new member elected during a special election in Novem-'ber was Rep Shirley Richard D-Madison who is already familiar with the Legislature husband Rep Alexander Richard D-Madison served in the House from 1980 to 1990 Rich- ard usually accompanied her husband for late-night sessions and sat in the House balcony with other wives of legislators Now Richard sits at the same desk in the back row of the House that was occupied by her late husband for a decade She says the seat has been reserved for the Madison legislator for many years Richard was elected to rnish the term of Rep Dorothy Rotondi D-Madison who moved outside the Changes from Al cussions in an effort to reach a solution to the dispute Butland was reportedly at the office Wednesday afternoon but Senate Republicans whose numbers control the upper body said their caucus saw no role for the Senate in negotiations between House Republicans and Gwadosky To that end Gwadosky threw down the gauntlet Wednesday afternoon to House Republicans who have threptened to call for a new election for House speaker if they are not given committee roles proportionate to House Democrats suggestion would be to put the order in tomorrow and proceed Gwadosky said we be paralyzed here for months If interest in reorganizing the House do it tomorrow not wait Then see where the votes are and where the support House Republican leader Walter Whitcomb of Waldo said if Republicans can provide a candidate who has the faith and support of the majority of the 151-member body the GOP can assume control of the House for the first time since 1975 we have the votes in control and he does what he Whitcomb said think Dan is at a juncture where he must decide if going to satisfy the Democrats or if going to satisfy decision Long perceived as outside the loop by her fellow Democrats Rep Gerry has always displayed an independent streak that has frequently left party leaders exasperated She speaks admiringly of former Democratic Rep John Michael a onetime Auburn legislator who also unenrolled to become an independent and whom Gerry described Wednesday as her Like Michael who led a statewide petition drive Gerry is a staunch advocate of term limits for elected officials and cited her concern over a possible challenge to the state term-limits law by Democratic lawmakers as a principle reason for her withdrawal from the party Although many Democratic and Republican lawmakers do not support the term limits law passed as a constitutional amendment by Maine voters in 1993 no legislator has signaled any intention to appeal the provision In a letter presented to Gwadosky Tuesday Gerry also criticized Democratic leadership for failing to give Republicans equal representation on joint standing legislative committees in a House that has seen political majority defined by one seat The ebbing Democratic majority in the 117th Legislature was caused by political defections and the deaths of two legislators unenrollment leaves the political lines drawn at 75 Republicans 75 Democrats and one independent Despite the near parity Gwadosky has given Republicans only 77 of the 170 committee slots available None of the 17 powerful House chairmanships included in that number is held by a Republican responsibility to operate an accept the demands Although Republicans hold only a two-vote edge in the Senate President Jeffrey Butland has not awarded committee assignments proportionately There are two Republicans and one Democratic senator on each of the 16 committees The 17th committee Marine Resources features a Republican a Democrat and an independent In order to limit Republican control on the joint committees Gwadosky assigned his 10 members on each committee in such a way as to split political control of the panels Under his formula eight of the committees are controlled by Republicans eight by Democrats with the Marine Resources Committee evenly split by both parties Each of the joint committees has a Senate chairman and a House chairman None of the Senate chairmen is a Democrat None of the House chairmen is a Republican Gwadosky met with his House committee chairmen Wednesday and learned not surprisingly that none was eager to give up the positions As a compromise the speaker hopes to partially give the House Republicans what they want at the Senate expense Senator Butland were willing to make some minor adjustments on the overall committee breakdown it would be much easier to reach an accommodation in the Gwadosky said Butland wanted to make some changes in the numbers it would be easy to go eight-eight-one but with greater representation by Senate Democrats and more representation by Republicans in the The plan would maintain the status quo of the overall political clout of the committees by decreasing Senate Republican power proportionate to the increased House Republican representation The linkage was perceived by House Republicans as irrelevant The House GOP is concerned only about its representation and perceives efforts to achieve some sense of overall balance on the committees as tantamount to meddling in the affairs of the Senate Butland was unavailable for comment Wednesday but Senate Republican leader Leo Kieffer of Caribou made it clear his caucus would not buy plan see the connection between the two this is strictly a House Kieffer said had changes in the Senate and I expect there will be changes in the House But it is certainly not up to the president of the Senate to make appointments in the Gwadosky and Whitcomb are scheduled to resume discussions on the GOP requests today presumably after the speaker has conferred with Butland In the event he is unable to find a satisfactory compromise Gwadosky may be forced to call the bluff and prepare for a vote to determine whether he should continue as speaker the Republicans are willing to do that I would suggest that they do it as soon as possible because institutionally we need to get on with the business\" Gwadosky said I can do something constructive for the state and my area then happy to do Rep Shirley Richard D-Madison learning results on all Maine public schools can either be one of the best things we do for children or one of the said Winn Rep Richard Campbell R-Hold-en anticipates debating a number of health care bills on the Banking and Insurance Committee Campbell said he wants to work for reduced cost and better access for health care without imposing a universal health insurance system on everyone For Rep Robert Tufts R-Stock-ton Springs who was a teacher for 30 years the most important issue is finding more money for public schools represent seven towns that pay high taxes for Tufts said As for the recommendations of the Productivity Realization Task Force charged with finding $45 million in efficiency-related savings Tufts said me it looks like programs have to be cut I like that I like to see jobs be Sen John Benoit R-Rangeley took a different approach am keen on continuing to cut government\" Benoit said can find $20 million and we may be able to find The task force already found $25 million in cuts that were approved by the Legislature in special session Now it needs to recommend another $20 million in cuts in order to balance the budget with a total of $45 million in cuts Benoit plans to work for his bill that would require registration of convicted sex offenders Another bill sponsoring would give parents a choice of where to send their children to school They would no longer be limited to sending children only to schools in their district want to see us get out of here by the end of March and not the middle of April in order to save some said Benoit Legislative leaders have set March 31 as their target adjournment date honorable House lies with the speaker and members of the House Gerry wrote in her letter unenrollment removes any excuse for continuing this example of partisan power politics that Maine people have come to Gerry said she appreciated the support she received for her low-income heating assistance legislation from both Republicans and Democrats who openly courted her during special session when rumors of her dissatisfaction with Democrats were circulating Just the same she said she remained in the Democratic because of the inability to address campaign finance reform and failure to unite to ban reformulated gas in Maine Rep Gerry always has displayed an independent streak Having never accepted any political action committee money Gerry! said she felt no sense of betrayal to Auburn Democrats who she said elected her for her principles not the leave the Democratic Party the Democratic Party left said Gerry a Democrat at heart but maybe the party just needs a good kick in the Gerry said she may choose to rejoin the Democratic Party at some point but will remain distant from both parties for the remainder of her term She has been invited to Attend both caucuses in the House Republicans respond Only a day before announcement House Republican leaders met briefly with Gwadosky in an effort to convince the speaker to hand over more of the coveted House chairmanships and committee assignments on a proportionate basis Although they returned empty-handed Republicans renewed their demands Wednesday upon learning of unenrollment Convinced that Gerry would vote with them against Gwadosky Republicans believe they have the 76 votes necessary to force a new election for House speaker Not only would such a coup have the likely effect of tossing a dozen or so Democrats out of a job in the office the shakeup could rattle the House chamber where a number of Democrats are also employed Whitcomb and Republicans met Wednesday morning and concluded that Gwadosky must split all of the committee slots between Republicans and Democrats and hand over eight committee chairmanships to the GOP if the speaker wants to avoid a challenge to his leadership appreciate the fact that trying to cling to power but not our Whitcomb said The increased Republican presence on the committees is significant since their numbers would give them greater control in advancing agendas and shaping legislation Citing frequent references to his bipartisan leadership approach Assistant House Republican leader Joe Carleton said it was time for the speaker to prove it by granting committee assignments that reflect the political composition of the House current arrangement just said the Wells legislator moral authority of leadership is at stake offer While Republicans prepared for a 1 pm meeting with Gwadosky Gov Angus King also a political independent sat one floor below the storm in his executive office fielding questions from reporters A day before he had pledged to spend more time on the third floor meeting with lawmakers to enhance Ids legislative rapport The governor wisely chose not to initiate his new policy Wednesday be surprised if the new House party split creates a serious King said of the developments wifi add one more bit of spice to a fascinating political That political mix in state government is represented now by an evenly divided House with one independent a Senate where Republicans outnumber Democrats 18-16 with one independent member and an independent governor with deep Democratic roots It is the role of the Senate in the composition of thq 17 joint standing legislative committees that is making it difficult for Gwadosky to Rep Ralph Carr D-Hermon district is not new to Richard said Wednesday as she waited for her committee assignment know the long hours the waits If I can do something constructive for the state and my area then happy to do Richard said she is most interested in education issues because she was a high school teacher for 30 years Rep Julie Winn D-Glenbum who sits on the Education Committee said she looks forward to debating the merits of imposing statewide education standards or Storm creates near-whiteout conditions temperature reaches record high inches in Bar Harbor and 9 inches in Farming- ton to 8 inches in Portland and 7 inches in Augusta said Carl Cemiglia a meteorologist from the National Weather Service in Gray The National Weather Service predicted 8 to 16 inches in some regions State Police in Augusta responded to between 40 and 50 reports of accidents or vehicles sliding off roads starting at 8 am a supervisor said Wednesday night There were about 24 fender-benders on the Maine Turnpike said a state police dispatcher in Gray Most state offices shut down at 2 pm joining other government agencies and businesses that closed early because of the storm The speed limit on the Maine Turnpike was lowered to 45 mph as police scrambled to keep pace with a rash of minor accidents during the morning commuter rush Many communities imposed parking bans to clear the streets for plowing crews during the night With heavy snow and temperatures remaining in the single numbers throughout most of the state all that was needed was an increase in wind velocity to put the storm in the blizzard category cold and the snow are certainly suffi- said meteorologist Jim Mansfield at the weather service in Gray thing missing at this moment is the The storm set the stage for a spell of cold weather expected to continue through the week Maine Storm from Al land and points south as well as Down East coastal sections of Maine were expecting more than a foot of snow from the midwinter storm charging up the East Coast Aroostook County however was expected to get a mere dusting of snow as the storm moved eastward The storm will usher in cold weather which is expected to continue through the weekend The wind-driven snow and low temperature slowed business to a crawl in many places and caused schools to close early Meanwhile Bangor officers and state police were kept busy with a rash of accidents The Stillwater Avenue accident that halted journey produced minor injuries but tied up traffic for at least half an hour on the southbound lane of 1-95 about midafternoon Slippery roads caused a single-car accident which was compounded when another four cars piled up behind the accident scene after drivers were distracted by lights from emergency vehicles responding to the accident according to Sgt Rod Carr of the Maine State Police Within minutes of the four-car pileup a tractor-trailer rig and a camper slid off the road in separate incidents in the same area said Carr advice to motorists is to slow said Carr the biggest problem in this type of Snow began falling around daybreak in southwestern Maine according to The Associated Press Snow tallies as of 7 pm ranged from 10 end with daytime highs generally in the teens and lows ranging from file single numbers in southern Maine to 10 to 20 below in the north Snow piles up in several states The Associated Press reported that 13 inches of snow had fallen at Utica NY with 10 inches by midday in central Indiana 9 in Illinois and up to a foot in Missouri Snow flurries were reported as far south as Alabama Up to 18 inches fell along the Great Lakes in upstate New York total this season jumped from 43 inches to 58 seven more inches than all of last season and 10 inches of new snow gave it a season total of just over 88 inches up from 35 at this time last year In New England Concord NH had 6 inches by afternoon for a total so far this season of more than 40 inches compared with 35 during all of last winter Logan Airport closed for 30

room in town was booked and they set up a shelter at the Presbyterian church down the way for people who get a said Matt Nelson night auditor at a motel in Mattoon 111 I The New York Times The average surface temperature climbed to a record high last year according to preliminary figures bolstering sense that the burning of fossil fuels is warming the climate Spells of cold snow and ice like the ones this winter in the north-eastern United States come and go in one region or another as do periods of unusual warmth But the net result of these local variations was to make 1995 the warmest year globally since records first were kept in 1856 says a provisional report issued by the British Meteorological Office and the University of East Anglia The average temperature was 587 degrees Fahrenheit according to the British data seven-hundredths of a degree higher than the previous record established in 1990 The British figures based on land and sea measurements around theVorld are one of two sets of long-term data by which surface temperature trends are being tracked The other maintained by the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York shows the average 1995 temperature at 597 degrees slightly ahead of 1990 as the warmest year since 1866 But the difference is within the margin of sampling error and the two years essentially finished neck and neck The preliminary Goddard figures differ from the British ones because they are based on a somewhat different combination of surface temperature observations around the world One year does not a trend make but the British figures reveal the years 1991 through 1995 to be warmer than any similar five-year period including the two halfidec-ades of the 1980s the warmest decade in the record to date This is so even though a sun-reflecting haze cast aloft by the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines cooled the Earth substantially for about two years i ."
