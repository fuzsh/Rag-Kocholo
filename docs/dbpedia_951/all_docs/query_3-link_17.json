Submissions were first judged at the district level with district winners advancing to a national committee.\n\nKiefer, an assistant director of communications for Stanford Athletics, took the highest award with his entry entitled: “A Reason to Smile.” The story was entered in the Athlete Profile category.\n\n“A Reason to Smile eloquently captured the struggle, fortitude, and courage of Stanford swimmer, Nicole Stafford,” one national judge said. “Kiefer’s story contained the same style and grace displayed by Nicole and brought attention to her condition while also offering an insight into Nicole's determination to not let this puzzling medical condition keep her from living her dream as a world-class collegiate swimmer.”\n\nRead David Kiefer’s national-winning entry: http://stanford_ftp.sidearmsports.com/Feature/AReasonToSmile/\n\nSix other awards were claimed at the national level as well. Kiefer was the top writer in three other categories, including Coach/Administrator Profile & Historical Feature, General Feature, and Blog.\n\nHis win in the Coach/Administrator Profile & Historical Feature category was titled “Morrison Warren: My American Story.”\n\nRead David Kiefer’s Coach/Administrator Profile & Historical Feature entry: http://stanford_ftp.sidearmsports.com/MyStory/MorrisonWarren/\n\nHis entry in the General Feature category came by the name of “A Good, Good Man.”\n\nRead David Kiefer’s General Feature entry: http://stanford_ftp.sidearmsports.com/Feature/Reuland/\n\nFinally, Kiefer’s victory in the Blog category was named “The Magic of Tyrone L. McGraw.”\n\nRead David Kiefer’s Blog entry: http://www.gostanford.com/news/2017/6/21/track-field-the-magic-of-tyrone-mcgraw.aspx?path=track\n\nBJ Pickard of the Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference prevailed in the Event Coverage category with “Record Crowd Set to Seek the Holy Grail”.\n\nRead BJ Pickard’s Event Coverage entry: https://www.miacathletics.com/sports/fball/2017-18/releases/20170922nme9rg\n\nChelsey Kraft of the University of Oklahoma topped the Story With Video category with “Sooner Leo: From Inspiration to Art”.\n\nRead Chelsey Kraft’s Story With Video entry: http://www.soonersports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=750311&SPID=127243&DB_OEM_ID=31000&ATCLID=211382289\n\nLastly, “Season Review: MSUB Baseball” by Evan O’Kelly of Montana State University Billings was first in the Season Preview/Recap category.\n\nRead Evan O’Kelly’s Season Preview/Recap entry: https://msubsports.com/news/2017/5/30/season-review-msub-baseball.aspx?path=baseball\n\nWhen contacted about his winning entries, Kiefer commented that “I’m honored to receive these awards, not only for myself, but for those in the industry who value quality writing.\n\n“There is a tendency to overlook the written word as we shift toward greater efforts in social media and graphics, and face a media that no longer has the resources to cover our programs as it once did. To me, this means we have an even greater responsibility to tell our stories, because we can’t count on others to do the same,” Kiefer noted. “With each story that we intelligently tell with impact, we increase our level of trust among our athletes and coaches, and with our fans and the public.\n\nThank you to CoSIDA for valuing writing and sponsoring the Fred Stabley Sr. Writing Contest, thank you to all the judges who spent so many hours reading the stories, and thank you to all the writers who took part and continue to produce amazing work all around the country.”\n\nThe 2019 contest will include entries written from January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018. Just a reminder: Association members are only allowed to submit one (1) entry per category and each entry can only be used in one (1) category.
