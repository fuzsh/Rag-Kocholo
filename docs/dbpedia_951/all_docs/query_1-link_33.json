        "text": "Our Mission\n\nFor too long, inefficient metal structures and unreliable solutions have dominated the greenhouse market. We feel it is our responsibility to bring the greenhouse industry into the 21st century by providing a more economically and environmentally sustainable greenhouse than has ever been available before. By incorporating the newest materials and technologies in renewables, light dep, climate control, and lighting, we strive to develop a product that meets the demands of a constantly evolving industry. It’s our mission to craft and provide a year round hybrid greenhouse solution that decreases energy usage, maximizes production, is environmentally responsible, and sets our growers up for longterm success.\n\nJames Arn\n\nOperations Analyst\n\nJames is the engine behind ArchSolar’s sales and product development processes. When not putting together project deliverables, he can be found on the ground supervising construction projects and helping clients to implement ArchSolar solutions. James studied New Media Interactive Development at Rochester Institute of Technology. Outside of ArchSolar, you can find James experimenting with sourdough, or on the trails in the mountains of New England.\n\nBrian Billett\n\nDirector of Business Development\n\nBrian helps to spearhead business development efforts for ArchSolar. His concentrations include meeting prospective clients and guiding them from initial discussions to the design phase, along with continuing business relationships with existing clients. He recently retired from professional hockey in April of 2019. While playing minor pro, Brian has been heavily involved in the industry by working with both private and public companies for projects that include greenhouse cultivation, M&A, raising capital, cultivation technology, and other specialized projects. Brian sees great opportunity for ArchSolar's greenhouses to expand into new markets within the United States and internationally.\n\nBruce Granger\n\nGrow Strategies Consultant\n\nBruce has extensive experience in the commercial growing industry. From indoor to greenhouses, he is fluent in countless growing strategies and best practices. He got his start as President of Kind Love, in Colorado, and has since worked with grow systems manufacturers, extraction lab designers, and consulted with Colorado Senators to draft State Bill 1284. Bruce has been recognized in the industry as a pioneer and leader."
