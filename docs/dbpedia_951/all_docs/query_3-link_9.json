The subcommittee met at 10:01 a.m., in room SD-138, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Mary L. Landrieu (chairman) presiding. Present: Senators Landrieu, Lautenberg, Coats, and Murkowski. opening statement of senator mary l. landrieu Senator Landrieu. Good morning, and let me call the subcommittee of Homeland Security Appropriations Committee to order. I am looking forward particularly to our hearing this morning. This is a favorite topic of mine and to many people that I represent, and I am happy to provide the time to air out some of these important issues. I thank my ranking member. We were notified this morning that there will be a vote on the floor of the Senate at 10:45 a.m. We are going to try to keep this subcommittee moving forward, even as we vote. It just depends on the members and if they are going to be able to attend. Senator Coats has another meeting at 10:30 a.m. So we will just see how it goes, but we are going to try to be accommodating to everyone's schedule. Let me welcome all of you. The tourism and travel industry is a substantial component of the U.S. economy. In 2010, it represented 2.7 percent of the country's gross domestic product and 7.5 million jobs. International travel to the United States supports 1.2 million jobs alone. The average overseas visitor spends $4,500 while they are here. And I would venture to say much of that money is spent at relatively small businesses, whether it is restaurants or museums or gift shops, art stores, antique dealers, et cetera. So we want to increase that opportunity for our small businesses here. Travel is a key economic driver for many of our major cities. According to information from the Department of Commerce, New York City continues to reign as the number one destination for international travelers, commanding a 32- percent share of overseas arrivals. Los Angeles experienced a 33-percent increase during 2010, gaining over 800,000 visitors. Las Vegas saw a 31-percent increase in overseas visitation during 2010, welcoming 570,000 more visitors than the year before. And during the first half of 2011, 446,400 international travelers visited New Orleans, a 6.9-percent increase over the first half of 2010 and the largest jump for us in many years. There are other parts of the country, of course, that benefit as well, but just pointing out those specific destinations. Today's hearing will focus on the Federal Government's initiatives, primarily the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), but also the Department of State (State Department) in both domestic and international arenas to make air travel as efficient but as convenient as possible but without sacrificing security. The subcommittee will examine the execution of a number of existing programs designed to expedite security screening for air travelers and to improve the arrival process for visitors to the United States. We will also look at steps the State Department is taking to expedite the issuance of tourist visas. We will also hear from representatives of the private sector who are impacted by these programs. On January 19, earlier this year, President Obama announced a series of initiatives to enhance travel and tourism to this country. He stated: ``Every year, tens of millions of tourists from all over the world come and visit America. The more folks who visit America, the more Americans we can get back to work. We need to help businesses all across the country grow and create jobs, compete, and win. That is how we are going to rebuild an economy where hard work pays off, where responsibility is rewarded, and where everyone can make it if they try.'' I could not agree more. Today the U.S. Travel Association is launching a national bus tour at Union Station to highlight many of the issues we will be discussing this morning. The travel dollar is an integral part of our economy, and we all should want to see it grow. At the same time, we must never forget that planes were, in fact, used as weapons of mass destruction on 9/11, and Congress created the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) in response to those horrific attacks and the continued threat to our Nation's aviation sector that has been widely publicized lately. However, 10 years after TSA was created, the screening process is viewed by many as overly burdensome. For too long, travelers with low-risk profiles have been screened no differently than those with high-risk profiles in a one-size- fits-all system. I am pleased to have the Administrator of TSA here today to discuss his efforts to think anew and to move away from that outdated screening model. TSA has launched an expedited screening program for known travelers called PreCheck (Pre3TM). It relaxes screening requirements for children under 12 and this week began relaxing screening procedures for passengers over age 75 and for the military. The plan is to expand Pre3TM from 11 airports to 35 airports this year. That is good news, but we have many more airports to reach. These efforts have received positive reviews and today we will explore how risk-based screening can be expanded to accommodate more travelers. TSA is also beginning to expedite access to airplanes for pilots through its crewmember program. I personally believe we must expand this program to include flight attendants. If any group should be considered trusted travelers, it most certainly is our flight crews. The bottom line is that security and convenience are not mutually exclusive. It is important that pleasure and comfort once again become words that are associated with air travel. Airlines have a big role to play in this, as do airports, but so does the Federal Government. As someone who has returned from international travel and has been required to stand in long lines without the use of a cell phone for a long time, waiting to clear Customs, I have often wondered what tourists coming to this country for a vacation to see the sights and spend their money must think of this great country of ours if this is their first impression. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers at our Nation's airports are the face of America to these tired travelers. It is important that we be both vigilant and welcoming. In 2011, more than 91 million travelers to the United States were processed by CBP through international airports. CBP has developed a number of Trusted Traveler programs designed to securely expedite the entry process for frequent travelers. Global Entry allows expedited clearance for preapproved, low-risk travelers who have paid $100 to participate in the program for 5 years and submitted to a more thorough background check. There are currently more than 252,000 members enrolled in Global Entry. NEXUS is a binational cooperative effort with Canada, similar to Global Entry and valid for land, sea, and air. Currently there are more than 629,000 participants who pay $50 for a 5-year enrollment. At the direction of Congress, CBP initiated the Model Ports of Entry program in 2007 to make the entry process more streamlined, understandable, and welcoming. It currently operates at 20 major airports, and there are other programs which will be discussed today. In an effort to promote these activities, we put in our bill last year additional funding--and I thank my co-chair--for 300 CBP officers at new and expanded ports of entry and $10 million above the request for TSA to support risk-based screenings such as Pre3TM. We will get an update, Senator, on that investment today. The State Department has the primary responsibility for issuing visas to people wishing to travel. The President's January 19 Executive order specifically calls for a 40-percent increase in non-immigrant visa processing capability over the coming year while ensuring that 80 percent of non-immigrant visa applications are interviewed within 3 weeks of their visa application. These benchmarks reflect mandates that I have worked to include in the fiscal year 2012 State and Foreign Operations budget as a member of that subcommittee. These are robust targets. We will want to know what steps the State Department is taking to meet these goals. On the second panel, we will have a variety of witnesses from the private sector who will discuss how these policies, already implemented by the Government, have improved the travel and entry process, and equally as important, they will share with the subcommittee their ideas on what more can be and should be done to further improve the ability to visit this country, increase travel, and grow the economy. I would like to now call on Senator Coats for his opening statement, and then I will turn to Vice Chair Frank Lautenberg when he arrives. And Senator, please and thank you. And I understand you have to leave in about 20 minutes. So thank you. STATEMENT OF SENATOR DAN COATS Senator Coats. Madam Chairman, you have suggested we do a rolling coverage so we can keep the subcommittee going. I can work that out. So you go first. I will wait, and then vote when you come back. Then I have got another appropriations hearing that is important to me. But this is important and I want to be here as much as I can. So we will figure that out. Thank you very much, Madam Chairman, for bringing these people together on this subject. All of us have experienced travel issues, lines at airline counters and self-check kiosks, and delays at boarding gates, lines at security screening and so forth. But we have to remember that 9/11 was a game-changer and that a lot of important adjustments needed to be made in terms of our ensuring that travel and the tourists that do travel and Americans that travel are safe to every extent possible. And so these adjustments have been made--many adjustments and things have been added to our ability to make travel more secure and convenient. There is this ying and yang that goes back and forth. We all want to balance security with convenience. Everybody wants to be perfectly safe or as safe as possible and at the same time have everything be as convenient as possible. And the members of the first panel that is before us have to deal with these issues every day and finding that balance is a real challenge, and I think we have to recognize that and recognize the efforts that have been made to try to achieve those two goals. TSA and CBP have a number of initiatives underway, Pre3TM and Global Entry among them, which could positively impact their ability to concentrate their limited resources on risk-based screening. The State Department is working on an initiative to address visa issuance problems. There is a ying and yang between our first panel and our second panel. If CBP and TSA schedule too few staff on a shift, resulting in lines and delays for processing and screening, that is a problem. But airline policies and scheduling also play a role in processing and screening. Too few personnel staffing airline self-check kiosks can hold up travelers, as can the impact of an airline's baggage fees. If there are too many international flights scheduled for arrival, say, between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m. at Dulles, this contributes to long lines for processing. And too many flights scheduled for early morning departure or late afternoon arrival or departure contribute to long lines for security screening. So I am hoping this morning that we will hear concrete, achievable suggestions for improvements. Let me just expand on that. Achievable suggestions for improving processing and screening while maintaining our security and recognizing budget constraints. This is a real challenge. We are facing a serious crisis in this country with our Nation's debt and the yearly deficit. It cannot be ignored, and there can no longer be such a thing as a sacred cow. We all have our sacred cows, but when you add them all up, nobody wants to subtract anything. I do not believe the answer to our problems is more taxpayer money sent to Washington. So we need to find innovative ways to be more efficient with the resources we do have. I note that several of the written testimonies include calls for more Federal staff at airports, mandating in statute a time limit for processing international arriving flights, mandating a time limit for processing visa applications, modernizing Federal information technology systems, providing Federal funding for checked baggage, screening equipment, et cetera. And while many of these suggestions that have been made may be good ideas, most likely most of them will require additional appropriations, which we do not have. They might require increases in fees levied on international airline passengers or visa applicants or even domestic passengers which have, as we know, little if any public support. And most importantly, some of these suggestions have a cost in lowered security. So do we want CBP watching the clock every time an international flight lands, or do we want them concentrating on assessing the information and the demeanor of each individual who has come off that plane? Do we want the State Department checking the calendar every day a visa application is in the office, or do we want them making sure that they have found every piece of information they can about a potential visitor or immigrant to this country before making a final decision? It is not okay to complain about security requirements for visas, airports, or entry into the United States and then demand that they be fundamentally changed when one mishap or one bad guy gets through the system. None of us want to see international travel drop in the wake of a successful terrorist attack the way it did in 2002 in the aftermath of 9/11. So in conclusion here, we all need to work together to figure out ways to work smarter but not necessarily more expensively or in a way that could compromise security. TSA, CBP, and the State Department need to contribute ideas just like the travel industry, airlines, event planners, and flight attendants need to contribute ideas for all of us to do this while ensuring that the United States remains a safe and preferred destination for international travelers. I look forward to continuing this discussion on these important issues. Madam Chairman, I know you and I, Senator Lautenberg, and others on this subcommittee pledge to work with all of you to try to achieve efficiency and effectiveness, at the same time providing security for those who travel from abroad and for Americans who take advantage of this magnificent country by getting on a plane, train, bus to go to places and continue this vibrant and dynamic tourist industry. I might just say I am happy to see my friend and fellow Indiana Law School graduate, John Pistole, here. We would prefer that nothing happens to interrupt our time between Friday evening 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. when Indiana plays Kentucky in the Sweet 16. Mr. Pistole. Go Hoosiers. Senator Coats. So to the extent you gentlemen can prevent anything serious from distracting during that timeframe, we would be most appreciative. Senator Landrieu. Senator Lautenberg. STATEMENT OF SENATOR FRANK R. LAUTENBERG Senator Lautenberg. Thanks, Madam Chairman. The President set the goal for America to be the top tourist destination in the world, and thanks to the Travel Promotion Act and other new policies, we are well on our way. Tourism is a big business even in my small, most densely populated State of New Jersey. People like to see the wonders of that energetic State, and it continues to be one of the largest and fastest growing businesses in our State. Nationwide the industry is supporting more than 7 million jobs, and in the next 10 years--think of it--travel and tourism will create 1 million more jobs in the United States. And we have to be aggressive in searching those jobs out. But our tourism industry can only reach its full potential if travelers are confident that they are going to be safe and secure. And as 9/11 showed, a terrorist attack can have a devastating impact on our travel industry, in addition to the tragic human toll. More than a decade after 9/11, aviation security remains a serious concern, particularly in my home State of New Jersey where we have witnessed security lapses at our airport, Newark Liberty, one of the busiest airports in the country. And one cannot talk about the conditions without remarking about how well our security structure has served. We have had incidents. Incidents, thank goodness, that were interrupted along the way show that our people are there. And Mr. Pistole, you have got a good team out there. We are looking for perfection. Hard to get but essential as a goal. In one incident a carry-on bag containing a knife got past the TSA agents at the airport. On another occasion, the passengers were able to enter secure areas without being screened properly. That one did not have a weapon but it did have a love connection. There was one last kiss goodbye and the guy just went under the rope and that was it. They shut the airport down for 1\\1/2\\ hour. Incidents like these raise concerns about our ability to protect the public as they move through our aviation system. And I also remain concerned about the ability to scan baggage effectively as airline baggage fees cause passengers to carry on more and bigger bags. And the bottom line is this. We have got to make aviation security our primary mission, but where we can speed up the process and improve efficiency, we must make these investments. And I look forward to hearing these witnesses today, Madam Chairman, on how we can address the challenges. Thank you. Senator Landrieu. Thank you so much, Senator Lautenberg. Let us begin, if we could, with our first panel. I want to welcome Senator Murkowski who has joined us and we will go through a round of questioning after our panel. Why do we not start, Mr. Administrator, with you? John Pistole, of course, has testified many times before this subcommittee, as the TSA Administrator. Thomas Winkowski, Acting Deputy Commissioner, CBP; Douglas Smith, Assistant Secretary, DHS for the Private Sector; and David Donahue, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Visa Services. So we will go in the order that I have called you all. John, why do we not begin with you? STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN S. PISTOLE, ADMINISTRATOR, TRANSPORTATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION Mr. Pistole. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman and Vice Chairman Lautenberg, Ranking Member Coats, and Senator Murkowski. Good to see you today. Thank you for the opportunity to testify as to what TSA's ongoing efforts are to provide the most effective security in the most efficient way for the traveling public. As you are aware, TSA employs a risk-based, intelligence- driven approach to reduce the vulnerability of the Nation's transportation systems to terrorism. Our goal is to maximize security and we are accomplishing this through an evolving, multi-layered approach. Really at its core, the concept of risk-based security (RBS), as we say, is an acknowledgment that we are not in the business of eliminating risk associated with traveling from point A to point B. Our objective is to mitigate that risk working with our partners and to reduce the potential for anyone to commit a deliberate act against our transportation systems. RBS enables our dedicated transportation security officers (TSOs) to focus their attention on those travelers we believe are more likely to pose a risk to our transportation network, including those on terrorist watch lists, of course, while providing expedited screening and perhaps a better travel experience to those less likely to pose such a risk. Through RBS initiatives, TSA is moving closer to its goal of providing the most effective security in the most efficient way possible. While a one-size-fits-all construct was necessary after 9/11, technology and intelligence are facilitating and enabling TSA's move toward an RBS model. Perhaps the most widely known RBS initiative is TSA Pre3TM. Since first implementing this effort last fall, we have expanded it to 11 airports, including Reagan National and Chicago O'Hare, which both began yesterday. More than 540,000 passengers have experienced expedited physical screening through TSA Pre3TM. Effective partnerships with participating airlines, airports, and CBP all contribute to this initiative's success. Airlines work with us to invite eligible passengers to participate, while CBP works with us to extend TSA Pre3TM benefits to many members of its Trusted Traveler programs including Global Entry. By the end of 2012, we expect to be offering expedited security screening in 35 of our busiest airports. We also look forward to working with individual airports on initiatives they may have to expand this also. This subcommittee's support of these efforts has been essential and is much appreciated. In fiscal year 2012, the subcommittee included $10 million to fund necessary upgrades to the Secure Flight system, a key enabler of TSA Pre3TM. Yesterday at Reagan National, we extended TSA Pre3TM benefits to Active Duty U.S. Armed Forces members with a common access card (CAC). This initiative also includes Active drilling members of the U.S. National Guard and reservists. These travelers are entrusted to protect and defend our Nation and its citizens with their lives. So this initiative comports with the new law signed by President Obama on January 3 of this year called the Risk-Based Security Screening for Members of the Armed Forces Act. Internationally CBP, of course, operates 14 aviation preclearance locations. Each of these locations has been or is scheduled to be evaluated by TSA to confirm that preclearance airports are performing checkpoint screening procedures of passengers and accessible property comparable to those of domestic airports. All pre-cleared flights arriving from the 14 preclearance airports are permitted to deplane passengers directly into the sterile area of U.S. airports. At this point, checked bags on connecting domestic flights will continue to be screened by TSA upon arrival until the screening technology and protocols at preclearance airports conform to U.S. standards. In addition, under the Beyond the Border initiative, TSA and others are working with Transport Canada for mutual recognition of checked baggage screening systems. And that is an initiative that began last month working closely with them. We are also supporting the expansion of the Known Crewmember initiative, which you mentioned, Madam Chair, an identity-based system which checks uniformed pilots against a database called the Common Access Security System to confirm their identity. We have had 475,000 pilots go through that thus far and look forward to expanding that as that takes hold in the 10 airports and is expanded throughout the country. In addition, we are committed to using the behavior detection officers to determine whether a traveler needs additional screening. PREPARED STATEMENT And finally, we are in the final processes of testing technology to automatically verify passenger identification documents and boarding passes, strengthening our ability to identify altered or fraudulent documents. And we will be deploying that throughout the rest of the year. Madam Chair, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss RBS and the streamlining process for inbound international passengers. [The statement follows:] Prepared Statement of Hon. John S. Pistole Good morning Chairwoman Landrieu, Ranking Member Coats, and distinguished members of the subcommittee. Thank you for the opportunity to testify today about the Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) on-going efforts to develop and implement a comprehensive risk-based approach to secure our Nation's transportation systems, and about Department of Homeland Security (DHS) travel programs to make domestic and international travel more convenient and efficient for passengers without sacrificing security. TSA employs risk-based, intelligence-driven operations to prevent terrorist attacks and to reduce the vulnerability of the Nation's transportation systems to terrorism. Our goal at all times is to maximize transportation security to stay ahead of evolving terrorist threats while protecting privacy and facilitating the flow of legitimate commerce. TSA's security measures create a multi-layered system of transportation security that mitigates risk. We continue to evolve our security approach by examining the procedures and technologies we use, how specific security procedures are carried out, and how screening is conducted. ADOPTING A RISK-BASED SECURITY STRATEGY Since becoming TSA Administrator, I have solicited the opinions of our key stakeholders and security professionals, our dedicated workforce and our counterparts abroad about how TSA can work better and smarter. Based on this feedback, I directed the agency last fall to begin developing a strategy for enhanced risk-based security (RBS) in all facets of transportation, including passenger screening, air cargo, and surface transportation. At its core, the concept of RBS demonstrates a progression of the work TSA has been doing throughout its first decade of service to the American people. It is an acknowledgment that we are not in the business of eliminating all risk associated with traveling from point A to point B. Risk is inherent in virtually everything we do. Our objective is to mitigate risk and to reduce, as much as possible without undermining travel and commerce, the potential for anyone to commit a deliberate attack against our transportation systems. RBS in the passenger screening context allows our dedicated transportation security officers (TSOs) to focus more attention on those travelers we believe are more likely to pose a risk to our transportation network--including those on terrorist watch lists--while providing expedited screening, and perhaps a better travel experience, to those we consider pose less risk. By utilizing our RBS initiatives, TSA is moving away from a one- size-fits-all security model and closer to its goal of providing the most effective transportation security in the most efficient way possible. While a one-size-fits-all approach was necessary after 9/11 and has been effective over the past decade, two key enablers-- technology and intelligence--are allowing TSA to move toward a RBS model. TSA PRECHECK PROGRAM Perhaps the most widely known security enhancement we are putting in place is TSA PreCheck (Pre3TM). Since first implementing this idea last Fall, the program has been expanded to nine airports and more than 460,000 passengers around the country have experienced expedited security screening through TSA Pre3TM. The feedback we've been getting is consistently positive. The success of TSA Pre3TM has been made possible by the great partnerships with our participating airlines and airports and our sister component, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). The airlines work with us to invite eligible passengers to opt into the initiative, and working with CBP we are able to extend TSA Pre3TM benefits to any U.S. citizen who is a member of one of CBP's trusted traveler programs, such as Global Entry, SENTRI, or NEXUS. By the end of 2012, TSA expects to be offering passengers in 35 of our Nation's busiest airports the expedited screening benefits associated with TSA Pre3TM. This subcommittee's support in these efforts has been essential, and it is deeply appreciated. By providing funding for essential technologies and program enhancements, TSA will be positioned to include new airports, air carriers and other populations as participants in TSA Pre3TM. In fiscal year 2012, Congress appropriated an additional $10 million to TSA for upgrades to the Secure Flight system, allowing it to incorporate new populations into the low-risk passenger pool. The fiscal year 2013 President's budget proposal requests $7 million in fiscal year 2013 which will continue to support this new capability. Under TSA Pre3TM, individuals volunteer information about themselves prior to flying in order to potentially expedite the travel experience. By learning more about travelers through information they voluntarily provide, and combining that information with our multi-layered system of aviation security, TSA can better focus our limited resources on higher risk and unknown passengers. This new screening system holds great potential to strengthen security while significantly enhancing the travel experience, whenever possible, for passengers. TSA pre-screens TSA Pre3TM passengers each time they fly through participating airports. If the indicator embedded in their boarding pass reflects eligibility for expedited screening, the passenger is able to use TSA's Pre3TM lane. Currently, eligible participants include certain frequent flyers from American Airlines and Delta Air Lines as well as existing members of CBP's trusted traveler programs who are U.S. citizens and are flying on participating airlines. We are actively working with other major air carriers, such as United, US Airways, Jet Blue, Hawaiian, and Alaska Airlines, to expand both the number of participating airlines and the number of airports where expedited screening through TSA Pre3TM is provided. In February, Secretary Napolitano and I announced the national roll out of TSA Pre3TM and our goal to have the program operating at the 35 busiest domestic airports by the end of 2012. Because we know more about these passengers, TSA Pre3TM travelers are able to divest fewer items, which may include leaving on their shoes, jacket, and light outerwear, and may enjoy other modifications to the standard screening process. As always, TSA will continue to incorporate random and unpredictable security measures throughout the security process. At no point are TSA Pre3TM travelers guaranteed expedited screening. Earlier this month, we expanded the TSA Pre3TM population to include Active Duty U.S. Armed Forces members with a Common Access Card, or CAC, traveling out of Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. Servicemembers will undergo the standard TSA Secure Flight pre-screening, and if we are able to verify the servicemembers are in good standing with the Department of Defense, by scanning their CAC card at the airport, they will receive TSA Pre3TM screening benefits, such as no longer removing their shoes or light jacket, allowing them to keep their laptops in their cases, and their 3-1-1 compliant bags in a carry-on. In addition to Active Duty members of the United States Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, this evaluation will also include Active drilling members of the U.S. National Guard and reservists. U.S. servicemembers are entrusted to protect and defend our Nation and its citizens with their lives. In treating them as trusted travelers, TSA is recognizing that these members pose little risk to aviation security. This evaluation is being conducted in compliance with the ``Risk-Based Security Screening for Members of the Armed Forces Act,'' signed into law by President Obama on January 3, 2012 (Public Law No. 112-86). Streamlining the Process for Inbound International Passengers TSA Pre3TM, as mentioned previously, is being extended to any U.S. citizen who is a member of one of CBP's trusted traveler programs. To further expedite the screening process, CBP currently operates 15 international aviation preclearance locations. Each of these locations has been or is scheduled to be evaluated by TSA to confirm that preclearance airports are performing checkpoint screening procedures of passengers and accessible property comparable to those of domestic airports and are providing an equivalent level of protection. All precleared flights arriving from the 15 preclearance airports are permitted to deplane passengers directly into the sterile area of U.S. airports. However, connecting passengers' checked baggage intended for connecting domestic flights must still be screened by TSA upon arrival in the United States, until the screening technology and protocols at the preclearance airports conform to TSA domestic checked baggage requirements. To that end, under the Beyond the Border (BTB) initiative, in accordance with a joint declaration signed by President Obama and Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper on February 4, 2011, TSA and the National Security Staff (NSS) have been working with Transport Canada (TC) toward mutual recognition of the two countries' checked baggage screening systems. Under an action plan, released last December, Canada's eight preclearance airports (Calgary, Edmonton, Halifax, Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, Vancouver, and Winnipeg) have initiated the process to upgrade their checked baggage screening equipment to TSA- certified explosives detection system (EDS) equipment as the primary checked baggage screening equipment. According to the BTB Action Plan, this upgrade, partnered with comparable implementation of TSA- equivalent policies and procedures, will make it unnecessary to rescreen checked bags from these Canadian airports when the passengers connect in the United States to other flights. This upgrading process began on February 11, 2012, and is scheduled to be completed at all Canadian preclearance airports by March 31, 2015. TSA will conduct a site visit of each preclearance airport in Canada to ensure checked baggage screening procedures provide an equivalent level of protection. Additional Security Initiatives The following additional recent initiatives to enhance security complement those discussed above. Known Crewmember.--To build on our risk-based approach to security, we are currently supporting efforts to test another identity-based system to enable TSOs to positively verify the identity and employment status of airplane pilots. The Known Crewmember program is the result of a joint operation between the airline industry (Airlines for America) and pilots (Air Line Pilots Association, International), which allows uniformed pilots from 22 airlines to show two forms of identification that are checked against a database called the ``Cockpit Access Security System,'' which confirms identity. After more than 2 months into the pilot program, and with deployments nearly complete at the seven participating airports, over 59,000 uniformed pilots have been cleared through the process, with an average of nearly 1,900 approvals per day. Like TSA Pre3TM, Known Crewmember is a clear example of TSA's commitment to focusing its attention and resources on those who present the greatest risk, thereby improving security and the travel experience for passengers across the country. Expanded Behavior Detection.--TSA took steps last fall to expand its behavior detection program that builds on the existing Screening of Passengers by Observation Techniques (SPOT) program, which has grown since 2003 to include over 160 airports. Under the Expanded Behavior Detection pilot program, TSOs employ specialized behavioral analysis techniques to determine if a traveler should be referred for additional screening at the checkpoint. The vast majority of passengers at the pilot airport checkpoints experience a ``casual greeting'' conversation with a behavior detection officer (BDO) as they pass through travel document verification. This additional interaction, used by security agencies worldwide, enables officers to better verify or dispel concerns about suspicious behavior and anomalies. Preliminary analysis from Boston, where the pilot is currently being conducted, shows an increase in the rate of detection of high- risk passengers. However, additional data is required to understand if the trend seen in the Boston data is statistically significant and replicable at other airports. TSA is currently conducting analyses with the DHS Science and Technology Directorate to estimate the number of cases required for validation. In the meantime, we have expanded the pilot program to Detroit to collect additional data on incorporating enhanced real-time risk assessments into our other layers of security. New Document Assessment Technology.--In addition to testing new procedures for low-risk populations, TSA is also employing technology to automatically verify passenger identification documents and boarding passes, providing TSA with a greater ability to identify altered or fraudulent documents. This technology, known as Credential Authentication Technology--Boarding Pass Scanning Systems (CAT-BPSS), will eventually replace the current procedure used by security officers to detect fraudulent or altered documents. CAT-BPSS enhances security and increases efficiency by automatically comparing a passenger's ID and boarding pass to a set of security features to concurrently authenticate them and ensure that the information on both match. The system can screen a wide range of travel documents. TSA began testing the technology in July 2011 and will deploy and evaluate the technology at airports in the near future. CONCLUSION As we review and evaluate the effectiveness of these aviation security enhancements, additional changes to the security screening process may be implemented in the future as TSA continues to work toward providing all travelers with the most effective security in the most efficient way possible. Of course, TSA will always retain the ability to incorporate random and unpredictable security measures throughout the airport, and no individual is ever guaranteed expedited screening. We appreciate the ongoing support and cooperation of the aviation industry and the traveling public as we strive to continue strengthening transportation security and improving, whenever possible, the overall travel experience for all Americans. The interconnectedness and interdependence of the global economy requires that every aspect in aviation security spectrum be as strong as possible. Whether it is for business or for pleasure, the freedom to travel from place to place is fundamental to our way of life, and to do so securely is a goal to which everyone at TSA is fully committed. Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss RBS, the streamlining process for inbound international passengers, and TSA's additional security initiatives. Senator Landrieu. Thank you so much. Tom. STATEMENT OF THOMAS S. WINKOWSKI, ACTING DEPUTY COMMISSIONER, CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION Good morning, Chairman Landrieu, Vice Chair Lautenberg, Senator Coats, and distinguished members of the subcommittee. It is an honor to appear before you today on behalf of the men and women of CBP to discuss the important work we do to secure and facilitate the flow of passengers into the United States. CBP has worked to improve the entry process for visitors to the United States, reengineering the way we process travelers while also increasing security and expediting the flow of legitimate travel. Today I would like to highlight how we are transforming our business model, enhancing professionalism, and pursuing advanced targeting initiatives to provide a safer, more welcoming environment for visitors coming to the United States. In the area of transforming our business model, CBP is continuing to transform the way we do business at our ports of entry. For instance, our Trusted Traveler programs expedite processing for low-risk, preapproved travelers upon arrival. These programs include SENTRI, NEXUS, and Global Entry and have nearly 1.3 million travelers enrolled. Global Entry, our newest program, allows members to bypass the regular lines and instead use self-service automated kiosks at 30 airports. Approximately 4,500 travelers use the kiosks each day, which allows CBP to make more efficient use of resources to secure and facilitate the flow of passengers. Global Entry typifies the unprecedented partnership we have forged with the travel industry. Together we have promoted Global Entry through community outreach events, advertisements, press releases, media events, and partnerships with airports and airlines. And as Administrator Pistole indicated, we have also partnered with the TSA to pilot the Pre3TM screening concept, which Global Entry is an integral part of. In the area of automation, CBP is continually exploring automation opportunities that will bring efficiencies to passenger processing and make more efficient use of resources. The Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) enables DHS to conduct enhanced screening of visa waiver program travelers through a fully automated online system. This not only helps us determine the eligibility of travelers under the visa waiver program, it allows us to eliminate the paper I-94W. This has resulted in a 58-percent faster processing time and helped us meet these demands of increased passenger volumes. CBP is actively working to automate and eliminate the I-94 form for other visitors as soon as possible. In the area of professionalism, a CBP officer is the first face an international traveler sees on arrival, as you indicated, Chairman, and we work actively to promote customer service while maintaining our important law enforcement focus. At the 20 model airports, CBP has installed audio and video technology to display informational and welcoming videos for travelers. There are also uniformed CBP Passenger Service Managers on site who act as key advocates for promoting traveler satisfaction. Our work is paying off. A traveler satisfaction survey was conducted in late 2011, which shows that travelers recognize our improvements and are satisfied with our overall arrival process. Nearly 90 percent of the travelers agreed that CBP officers are welcoming, provide travelers with the right information, and provide entry processing within a short and reasonable time period. CBP is working directly with industry partners to develop and maintain an ongoing survey process. CBP closely monitors traveler wait times and strives to process arrivals quickly and as securely as possible. On a typical day, CBP processes more than 240,000 incoming international air passengers, and we expect air travel to continue its increasing trends. Our current statistics show that 88 percent of travelers wait less than 45 minutes for CBP processing and 73 percent of travelers wait less than 30 minutes. Although we have achieved some efficiencies, CBP is committed to doing better. The search for efficiencies not only contributes to better customer service, it helps us work smarter in a tight budget environment. This is especially important because CBP relies on user fee collections to fund more than 35 percent of our front- line CBP officers, and that is about 7,200 CBP officers. With the fluctuations in travel, that leaves us with a less predictable source of funding for more than one-third of our personnel. We are identifying staffing requirements through a workload staffing model and evaluating alternative funding strategies. Now, the workload staffing model employs a data-driven methodology for identifying staffing requirements at all ports of entry. It also captures future staffing needs for new and expanded facilities and technology deployment. In the area of advanced targeting initiatives---- Senator Landrieu. Tom, try to wrap, if you could. Go ahead. Take 15 more seconds. Mr. Winkowski. In the area of advanced targeting initiatives, we have made great strides. As you have indicated, our travelers need to feel safe and we need to make sure that we provide the right oversight from the standpoint of keeping dangerous people off our airplanes. PREPARED STATEMENT So in conclusion, I appreciate the opportunity to come here today and I look forward to your questions. [The statement follows:] Prepared Statement of Thomas S. Winkowski Chairman Landrieu, Ranking Member Coats, Vice Chairman Lautenberg, distinguished members of the subcommittee, it is an honor to appear before you today to discuss the work of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to secure and facilitate the flow of passengers and trade into the United States. We have created several programs specifically for this purpose, and it is my pleasure to share some of them with you today. CBP is engaged in a series of business transformation initiatives to make our inspection processes more effective and efficient. These initiatives involve evaluating core processes, incorporating technology enhancements, assessing utilization of law enforcement staffing, and developing additional automation efforts. Above all, we remain committed to our multi-layered approach, to include: --Transforming Our Business Model.--CBP is working hard to efficiently transform our processes and business models to optimize our current resources. --Professionalism and Model Ports.--CBP is revamping our strategies operationally to promote a more responsive workforce that makes the arrivals process easier and more welcoming. --Advanced Targeting Initiatives.--CBP is proactively working with our security partners to identify security risks and threats abroad before they reach our borders. Prevention of these threats is a crucial part of our strategy to ensure travel remains safe and secure. BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION CBP has collaborated with industry partners, airlines, and airport stakeholders to identify opportunities that will promote travel to the United States and improve the traveler experience. We continue to implement new programs that facilitate travelers' arrivals while making the most effective use of our resources. These programs are discussed in greater detail below. Trusted Traveler Programs Trusted Traveler Programs have been essential to our risk-based approach to facilitate the flow of travelers into the United States. They provide expedited immigration, customs, and agriculture processing upon arrival in the United States for pre-approved, low-risk participants through the use of secure and exclusive dedicated lanes and automated kiosks. These programs are predicated on the thorough vetting of travelers who have voluntarily applied for membership, paid a fee, and provided personal data (including biographic information, photos, and fingerprints) to CBP. CBP officers ensure that comprehensive database checks have been conducted against terrorist watchlist records, criminal history records, active wants/warrants; previous customs, immigration, or agriculture violations; investigatory records; and other law enforcement records. Participants are vetted every 24 hours to ensure no new derogatory information has been identified, and are subject to law enforcement checks every time they use one of the program-dedicated lanes or kiosks to enter the United States. Applicants are denied participation if any disqualifying information is uncovered during the application process, or at any time during the traveler's membership period. Applicants may also be denied if they are suspected of being involved in any illicit activity or present a potential risk for terrorism, criminality, or smuggling. Currently, almost 1.3 million travelers are enrolled in CBP's four trusted traveler programs: Secure Electronic Network for Travelers Rapid Inspection (SENTRI), Free and Secure Trade (FAST), NEXUS, and Global Entry. --For travelers at our southern land border with Mexico, SENTRI provides expedited processing for pre-approved, low-risk travelers through dedicated commuter lanes. CBP has developed and distributed a new, enhanced, trusted-traveler card with increased security features to all SENTRI members. SENTRI cards are Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI)-compliant documents for entry into the United States by land or sea, and also provide expedited travel to the United States and Mexico. --FAST expedites the processing and release of approved commercial truck drivers making fully qualified trips between the United States and Canada or to the United States from Mexico. Commercial trucks using FAST lane processing must be a Customs- Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT)-approved carrier; carrying qualifying goods destined for a C-TPAT-approved importer; be driven by an individual in possession of a valid FAST-commercial driver card; and have a high-security seal. On the southern border, manufacturers must also be C-TPAT-approved in order for shipments to qualify for FAST release. --NEXUS provides expedited CBP processing for pre-approved, low-risk travelers at pre-clearance airports, land border, and seaport crossings between the United States and Canada. NEXUS cards are WHTI-compliant documents for land and sea travel, as well as air travel when traveling to and from airports using the NEXUS program. --Global Entry allows expedited clearance for pre-approved, low-risk air travelers upon arrival in the United States. Global Entry is available to U.S. citizens and U.S. lawful permanent residents, Canadian citizens and permanent residents, Dutch citizens enrolled in the Privium program, Mexican citizens, and citizens of the United Kingdom, Germany, and Qatar through limited pilot programs. In addition, CBP has entered into joint arrangements with South Korea and Panama to allow their qualifying citizens and permanent residents to participate in Global Entry. Global Entry is an example of unprecedented partnership with private industry, airlines, and airport authorities. Pre-approved, low- risk air travelers may enter the United States by using automated kiosks located at one of the 20 selected airports. Global Entry allows vetted air passengers to clear CBP inspectional processing much faster than general passenger processing. Global Entry membership now includes those travelers enrolled in NEXUS and SENTRI, and the program has surpassed 940,600 eligible users with over 4,000 daily uses. Global Entry automated kiosks have been used over 2 million times--saving over 42,400 inspectional hours that CBP has reallocated to focus on the regular traveler queues. With Global Entry, CBP is able to focus resources on travelers about whom DHS knows the least, therefore providing overall enhanced screening to the traveling public. Last month, CBP published the Global Entry Final Rule, which makes this highly successful program permanent. The rule expands Global Entry to allow children under the age of 14 to participate, allowing more families to enjoy the benefits of the program. In 2012, CBP will expand the number of airports participating in the program to 24 airports. Collaborative Efforts Strong partnerships with the travel industry allow CBP to leverage different customer bases to identify frequent travelers and potential Global Entry members. We have promoted the Global Entry program using advertisements, press releases, media events, and partnerships with airlines and conducted community outreach to raise awareness of the program. Recognizing the benefits of the program, some travel providers now reimburse top-tier customers for Global Entry application fees and we are working with others to expand enrollment. CBP also continues to work with our stakeholders to improve the inspection process in ports of entry at airports. This effort includes implementing new programs like Express Connection and One-Stop. Both of these programs work cooperatively with the air carriers and airports to expedite travel--they reduce missed connections, increase passenger throughput, and enhance the arrival processing experience. Express Connection is designed to facilitate the processing of travelers with closely scheduled connecting flights to reduce missed connections, and is available at 11 of the Nation's busiest airports. Working closely with participating airlines, CBP dedicates personnel to identify and direct pre-selected travelers who can use designated Express Connection primary booths. Through our One-Stop program, airport operators and airlines provide a streamlined processing option for those travelers who have no checked luggage. Dedicated lanes provided by CBP for One-Stop identified travelers are located at Houston (IAH) and New York City (JFK) International Airports. CBP is pleased with the initial success of the Express Connection and One-Stop programs, and is considering further expansion of each. Our partners at TSA are applying intelligence-driven, risk-based screening methods to domestic travel to improve security and expedite travel for those passengers about whom we know the most. The TSA Pre3TM initiative broadens the scope of benefits available to CBP Trusted Travelers by enabling expedited screening at dedicated lanes within TSA Pre3TM airports. Going forward, CBP and TSA will continue to work together to strengthen security while significantly enhancing the travel experience for low-risk travelers. Automation and Technology CBP is continually exploring additional automation opportunities that will provide greater efficiencies in the passenger processing environment while allowing for a more effective use of existing resources. Some changes that we have adopted range from new technologies to eliminating unnecessary paperwork, saving inspection hours for CBP officers. The Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) is a security enhancement to the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) that was developed pursuant to the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007. ESTA is a fully automated travel authorization system used to collect information from travelers planning to travel by air or sea to the United States under the VWP. An approved ESTA application is mandatory for all VWP travelers prior to commencing travel by air or sea to the United States. The information submitted by applicants is screened against appropriate law enforcement databases, including the terrorist watch list, to determine the eligibility of travelers to travel to the United States under the VWP, and whether such travel poses a law enforcement or security risk. Through ESTA, CBP was able to automate the I-94W form, which was previously used by over 60 percent of travelers arriving by air to the United States, and eliminate the paper form. The result is 58 percent faster processing time for travelers under the VWP. This time savings has resulted in more efficient processing in most airports and has helped CBP meet the demands of increased passenger volumes. CBP is currently working with DHS partners to automate the standard I-94 form used by all other, non-VWP visitors entering the United States. There have also been many automation improvements in the land environment through our Land Border Initiative (LBI). Radio frequency identification (RFID) technology, improved license plate readers, and the Vehicle Primary Client remain the key to facilitating travel by allowing traveler information to be pre-positioned for our officers and automatically queried via law enforcement databases as the vehicle approaches the primary inspection. Vehicle Primary Client is a next generation computer upgrade that allowed CBP officers to quickly verify the validity of travel documents and make determinations regarding the admissibility of persons. Simultaneously, WHTI increases the security of U.S. land borders by requiring travelers to present a securely issued travel document, which can be verified electronically in real- time, to establish identity and citizenship. The use of RFID technology and the promotion of new RFID document options allows for the transition of travelers from less efficient to more efficient processing methods. Passenger name law enforcement queries stemming from RFID travel documents are 20 percent faster than queries conducted with a machine readable document and 60 percent faster than a manual entry with a paper document such as a birth certificate. As of February 2012, there are more than 13 million RFID- enabled documents in the hands of travelers. As part of WHTI, CBP greatly increased its use of technology in the land border environment; this technology is now integral to CBP operations, providing clear security and facilitation benefits. PROFESSIONALISM AND MODEL PORTS CBP and our travel industry partners have worked together to improve processes for welcoming travelers into our country while maintaining the highest levels of security and professionalism. CBP has taken a proactive management approach in addressing passenger processing issues and is constantly working in partnership with airport authorities, airlines, and the travel industry to identify new ways to more efficiently facilitate the entry process. Model Ports The Model Ports program was created to make the entry process more streamlined, understandable, and welcoming. The program is in place at the top 20 airports by volume: Washington-Dulles, Houston (IAH), Atlanta, Boston, Dallas/Ft. Worth, Chicago (ORD), Detroit, Ft. Lauderdale, Honolulu, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Miami, Newark, New York (JFK), Orlando, Philadelphia, Sanford (FL), San Juan, San Francisco, and Seattle. Some of those best practices of the Model Ports program include the establishment of the Passenger Service Manager (PSM) position, a key advocate for promoting traveler satisfaction. The PSM is a uniformed CBP manager able to: respond to traveler complaints or concerns; oversee issues related to travelers requiring special processing; observe overall traveler processing; address issues on site as they occur; and provide recommendations for improvement of traveler processing and professionalism. The PSM also provides training to managers, supervisors, and officers on customer service and professionalism issues; collects and analyzes reports concerning professionalism and traveler satisfaction; and promotes public awareness of the CBP mission through distribution of public information bulletins, brochures, and comment cards. There are full-time PSMs stationed at each of the 20 Model Ports. Photographs and contact information for all PSMs are prominently displayed for maximum traveler visibility and access. In partnership with airport authorities and airlines, CBP also implemented the use of special service representatives to aid in directing travelers to open CBP primary booths and ensure CBP forms are completed prior to arrival in the processing area. Under the program, we have also significantly improved signage that is clear and concise for international travelers. CBP has installed and implemented audio and video technology in the passport primary queuing area in order to display CBP's informational video, ``Welcome to the United States `Simple as 1, 2, 3','' which presents travelers with step-by-step instructions on what to expect during CBP processing. The video is subtitled in eight languages and is seen by over 25 million visitors each year. CBP also partnered with Walt Disney Corporation to create a video at our Model Ports depicting images of America that provide a warm welcome to arriving visitors and resonate with U.S. citizens returning home. Another example of successful partnership with industry partners and stakeholders resulted in significant improvements to the facilities at the Orlando International Airport. A working group that included DHS agencies, the Port of Orlando, and private sector participants resulted in improved queuing, streamlined signage, a more welcoming interior decor, and foreign-language-speaking passenger facilitation. This local effort is considered a model for ports across the country and we are looking to highlight similar efforts in the future. Traveler Satisfaction Survey As a result of CBP's commitment to improve customer service, CBP and the DHS Private Sector Office developed and deployed a traveler satisfaction survey to benchmark passenger satisfaction at the 20 Model Ports of Entry. The survey was conducted by Medforce Government Solutions (MGS), under a CBP contract, to evaluate CBP's performance in achieving Model Port goals. The traveler satisfaction survey for all 20 Model Ports began in October 2011 and was completed in November 2011. MGS used personal digital assistant (PDA) devices to collect data from English-speaking travelers; travelers speaking other languages were given paper surveys. The survey findings indicate that: --Nearly 90 percent of travelers agree that CBP officers are welcoming; --Over 90 percent of travelers agree that CBP is providing the right information to travelers, at the right time and in a hospitable manner; --Over 80 percent of travelers agree that CBP is creating a calm, pleasant Customs waiting area; and --Nearly 90 percent of travelers feel that the entry processing time is either short or reasonable. Travelers have expressed high satisfaction with the way CBP is managing its entry process and providing timely and friendly customer service. We are still analyzing the results of this survey and working directly with industry partners to develop and maintain an ongoing survey process to maintain a feedback loop with our travelers so that improvements continue. Aligned with the customer service survey initiative, CBP revitalized the comment card program. Comment cards are available in the CBP areas at airports and can be filled out by travelers wishing to express their views of CBP processing. Each card is collected and the results are shared with the ports of entry, and if necessary referred for additional investigation. CBP has improved the format of the card made the cards more accessible to the traveling public, provided more analysis and feedback for the ports of entry, and taken corrective action where necessary. Reducing Wait Times In addition to proven improvements to the traveler experience, we closely monitor wait times for international travelers. CBP strives to process arriving travelers, regardless of the port environment, as quickly as possible while maintaining the highest standards of security. Current statistics show that the 88 percent of travelers wait less than 45 minutes for processing and 73 percent of travelers wait less than 30 minutes for processing at airports. The national wait time average in fiscal year 2011 was about 22 minutes. Although CBP continues to address ways to manage wait times, other issues affect wait times, including concurrent arrivals that exceed the capacity of the airport and the need to staff multiple terminals. To address these challenges, CBP is implementing an aggressive, multi- pronged mitigation strategy to enhance air passenger facilitation over the near and mid term. The near term strategy includes: --More effective use of existing resources; --Partnerships with carriers and airport authorities on facilitation measures; and --Enhanced risk segmentation through increases in trusted traveler program membership. In the mid-term, CBP will focus on optimizing front-line staffing resources and transforming business processes. Critical elements of this strategy include: --Transforming and reengineering current business processes; --Implementing alternative funding strategies to expand services at requesting locations; and --Accurately identifying staffing requirements through a rigorous, audited, workload staffing model. Our port directors identify peak processing periods well in advance based on historical data and real time operational information provided by carriers and airport authorities. With this advanced information, directors make appropriate operational adjustments, including restricting annual leave and administrative functions during peak processing periods, expanding pre-primary roving operations, utilizing cargo lanes for passenger processing as much as possible, and adjusting individual schedules and lane assignments. The airport wait time console is used to report on primary processing passenger wait times at the top 63 air ports of entry. This data is based on measurements of time intervals between the arrival of the aircraft and the processing of the passenger on primary. The wait time for each arriving passenger is recorded, and aggregates of these wait times may be obtained based on the individual flight, class of admission, time of day, or any other data element associated with an arriving air passenger. CBP reports wait times on our public Web site, and we continue to refine the reporting. The airport wait time console real time flightboard utilizes live data feeds from multiple sources to create a view of passenger arrival data that allows CBP field operations personnel to make optimal staffing decisions. By taking into account such factors as aircraft arrival time, facility constraints, as well as passenger volume and admission class, CBP field operations management is able to foresee how changes in any of the elements will require corresponding adjustments to staffing in order to meet our passenger wait time goals. CBP is currently testing this program at airports such as JFK and LAX, and we expect to expand the program to additional airports later this year. Workload Staffing Model CBP is also developing a workload staffing model (WSM), employing a rigorous, data-driven methodology for identifying staffing requirements at the air, land, and sea ports. The WSM considers all business processes required of CBPOs, the workload associated with those business processes, and the true level of effort required to effectively carry out the mission on a daily basis. The WSM identifies the suggested personnel necessary to accomplish the critical daily mission, and it also captures future staffing requirements for new or enhanced facilities and technology deployments. Professionalism: Enhanced CBP Officer Training CBP has also improved its training of CBP officers to ensure the highest level of professionalism. In 2008, CBP began working on a comprehensive basic training program for new officers. This new training program was launched in February 2011. The new curriculum includes three mandatory components: a 15-day pre-academy, an 89-day basic academy and a post-academy training program that ends as the trainee completes his or her probationary period. The goal of these programs is to produce a professional law enforcement officer who possesses the skills necessary to effectively carryout CBP's critical mission. The programs prepare trainees mentally, physically, and ethically to meet the challenges and demands of a law enforcement position and equips them with the specific skills needed to perform their duties with a high level of competence. Partnership With Brand USA CBP is committed to the goal of facilitating lawful travel and fully supports efforts to expand legitimate travel and tourism to the United States. In support of these efforts, CBP has worked with Brand USA (formerly the Corporation for Travel Promotion) since it was established by the Travel Promotion Act of 2009. Brand USA was created for the purpose of encouraging travelers from all over the world to visit the United States of America. The public-private marketing entity was created in 2010 to work in close partnership with the travel industry maximizing the social and economic benefit of travel in communities around the country. CBP works closely with Brand USA to promote CBP programs such as ESTA and Global Entry and to identify ways of improving the traveler experience at U.S. ports of entry based on feedback from the customer satisfaction survey. Proposal To Seek Reimbursement Authority for Outlier Services CBP believes that providing additional services that are not currently offered such as service for additional flights, new airports, or land border crossings and pre-clearance operations are in the best interest of the traveling public and economic prosperity. The current statutory limitations on CBP's authority to receive outside funding, except in narrowly defined instances, have prevented us from receiving reimbursement from private sector and international, State, and local partners. In turn, CBP has had to deny requested services or the provision of services without reimbursement. Therefore, through the fiscal year 2013 budget request, we are seeking the passage of a proposal that provides the necessary authority to consider and approve the provision of inspectional services for full reimbursement at domestic or international airports, seaports, land border environments other than user fee facilities currently defined in 19 U.S.C. section 58(b). The underlying objective is to allow CBP to provide additional services at ports that it otherwise could not provide without reimbursement. ADVANCED TARGETING INITIATIVES CBP has also placed a great emphasis in targeting potential security and law enforcement threats prior to their arrival in the United States and specifically, prior to boarding a U.S.-bound flight through its pre-departure targeting strategy. To accomplish this strategy, CBP has expanded and reorganized operations at the National Targeting Centers, enhanced the Immigration Advisory Program (IAP), increased international partnerships, and participated in new initiatives such as the U.S.-Canada Beyond the Border plan. National Targeting Center The NTC was established in November 2001 in response to the 9/11 attacks to provide advance passenger targeting, research, and coordination among numerous law enforcement and intelligence agencies on a 24/7 basis in support of the CBP anti-terrorism mission. Following the attempted bombing of Northwest flight 253 in December 2009, the NTC re-engineered its targeting operations with an increased emphasis on pre-departure targeting and interdiction, outbound targeting, and the re-vetting of previously issued U.S. visas. To increase its focus on pre-departure, the NTC not only expanded its operations significantly, but also accelerated its response time. The additional workload and time-sensitive analysis required process, technical, and resource enhancements. As a result, CBP has had to maximize the effectiveness of advanced technology and information, intelligence, databases (classified, law enforcement, commercial, and open-source), domestic and international partnerships, and well-trained human resources to effectively screen, review, identify, and prioritize passengers, cargo, and agriculture across all international modes of transportation, inbound and outbound. Immigration Advisory Program and Regional Carrier Liaison Groups The Immigration Advisory Program is a partnership between DHS/CBP, foreign governments, and commercial air carriers to identify and prevent high-risk travelers who are likely to be inadmissible into the United States from boarding U.S.-bound flights. CBP officer teams are deployed to work with foreign law enforcement and air carriers at key airports in host countries. IAP teams work collaboratively to identify high-risk passengers with targeting support from the NTC and/or an assessment of passengers and their documentation. IAP extends the zone of security beyond the physical borders; CBP officer presence in foreign locations provides the on-site capability to question and assess travelers and serve as a direct liaison with foreign authorities. The Regional Carrier Liaison Groups (RCLG), located at airports in New York (JFK), Miami, and Honolulu, also work closely with carriers to provide information prior to passenger travel. Using various targeting methods, they prevent passengers who may be inadmissible, or who possess fraudulent documents, from traveling to the United States. Recommendations are made to the carriers regarding suspect travelers. The work of the IAP and RCLG has resulted in substantial savings for both carriers and the U.S. Government. The Federal Government saves costs associated with processing and detention of inadmissible persons, while carriers can avoid fines associated with bringing improperly documented aliens. Preclearance Preclearance provides for the inspection and clearance of commercial air passengers and their goods prior to departure from 15 foreign locations in five countries in support of CBP's extended border strategy. All mission requirements (agriculture, customs, and immigration) are completed at preclearance locations prior to departure enabling CBP to prevent inadmissible travelers and prohibited goods from entering the United States, and to protect U.S. agricultural infrastructure from foreign pests, disease and global outbreaks. Preclearance supports CBP's initiative to extend the borders outward and is part of the DHS strategic plan to deploy technology systems overseas to detect radiological threats before they leave foreign territories. A preclearance inspection is the same inspection an individual would experience at any United States port of entry, except it is conducted on foreign territory. As a result, the individual does not have to undergo a United States Government inspection again upon arrival in the United States. Instead, the traveler merely arrives at a United States domestic terminal facility and either connects to a United States domestic flight or leaves the airport. Passengers are afforded the benefits of making quick domestic and international connections and by having their checked luggage automatically transferred between flights by air carriers without being claimed. Meanwhile, United States airports enjoy the benefit of reduced passenger delays in the international arrival area. CONCLUSION CBP is a world-class law enforcement agency--every day we are working to keep air, land, and maritime travel safe and secure, while providing professional services to our travelers. Air travel has increased by 3 percent in the past year, requiring more efficient processing for our travelers. As the industry is expected to grow even further in the coming year, we are positioned to respond with improved customer service and greater efficiency while engaging in techniques that identify threats before they arrive in the United States. We are holding CBP officers to a higher standard of professionalism and interpersonal conduct. Further, we will continue to take a proactive approach and engage in programs and initiatives that enhance security and expedite the flow of legitimate travel. Through business transformation, professionalism, and targeting initiatives, CBP is working to realize our goals and maintain traveler confidence that we are doing our best to keep air travel safe and secure. Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today. I look forward to your questions. Senator Landrieu. Thank you so much. Doug. STATEMENT OF DOUGLAS A. SMITH, ASSISTANT SECRETARY, PRIVATE SECTOR OFFICE, DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY Mr. Smith. Thank you, Chairman Landrieu. The timing of this hearing could not be better. I was thrilled to hear you mention the President's announcement in Orlando last month. As important as that announcement and calling attention to travel and tourism is who is at this table. We are not just here today as a one-time deal. The four of us literally talk every single day. In my role as the Secretary's Assistant Secretary for the Private Sector, what she looks for me to do is to coordinate across the entire Department and the interagency how to best work with the travel industry. As important are the people sitting behind me: Roger Dow, Airlines for America (A4A), and all of our partners in the travel industry. We are reaching out to them and working with them every single day looking for ways to create better efficiencies, looking at ways to increase throughput at airports, but to your point, Senator Coats, never compromising security. We firmly believe we can have both. It is the standard the President and the Secretary of Homeland Security hold us to. We can do both. We can facilitate travel to the highest degree possible and at the same time keep America safe whether it is for exciting events, Senator, next week in your hometown, the final four, perhaps we need a follow-up hearing, Senator Coats, down there in New Orleans for the final four championships. Senator Landrieu. Good idea. I should have thought of that. Mr. Smith. In New Jersey in the work we are doing at Newark International Airport to expedite travelers through so when they take those long flights back from Singapore, they are not standing in lines. We are committed across the entire Federal enterprise to continue to raise the bar. Since we came into office 3 years ago, we have put exciting programs into place. In fact, we have now through the programs such as Global Entry, TSA Pre3TM, broken the million-person mark of people that have those benefits. These people with those expedited travel benefits are already showing what can happen at our airports. What we are doing in Orlando in the Model Ports program-- the lessons learned there, we have been able to take across the country. I held a field hearing down there about 1 year ago, brought in 20 stakeholders from Walt Disney World, Universal Orlando, Gatorland, the airport authority, local members down there to talk about how we could improve the system, how we could make the welcoming experience better. Everybody came together. The achievements we learned there and working it across the Federal Government and our private-sector partners has given us the learnings to take across the country to not just the top 20 airports in the Model Ports program, but where we are expanding. There is a lot of work to do and we realize that, but it is this partnership that I can say has never been stronger. My partners in the private industry are not shy about reaching out and calling on a regular basis. But we are not shy about asking for help, asking for their help, and helping us grow our expedited traveler programs, helping us think through ways to better market to consumers. We are in the security business at DHS. My colleagues, Tom Winkowski and Administrator Pistole, are the best that there are. We rely on their counsel on a daily basis. But it is an integrated team, a team that extends to the United States Secret Service, to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, to the Coast Guard, and looks at innovative solutions to help keep the country safe and at the same time support our friends in the travel industry as they work diligently to grow this incredibly important driver of our economy. I know this week you will be talking to some of your colleagues on the possible expansion on the visa waiver program. It is a program we watch carefully. As you know, we have talked with many of your colleagues on areas in that program. It is an important tool. But there are many tools out there. With the time I have left, the one thing I would like to stress is it is about a partnership. We are committed. We are putting everything we have against this. Whether it is Secretary Napolitano, Secretary Salazar, Secretary Bryson in chairing the Travel and Tourism Advisory Board, the President, we are putting all that we have against it. But it is a partnership with private industry, with the administration, and with the Congress. Your colleagues, Senator Blunt and Senator Klobuchar, in chairing the Travel and Tourism Caucus in the Senate, have been phenomenal partners with the insights and the ideas they have given us. Your colleagues over on the House, Congressman Bonner and Congressman Farr, are equally supportive in giving us ideas. But that is how we are going to improve. To your point, Senator Coats, you are right. Budgets are not growing. They are shrinking and it is why we need to continue to close ranks, be as creative as we can to work with what we have. We could always use more. Everybody knows that. But we are confident that in working closely in these partnerships with private industry, with the Congress, across the administration, we will continue to find efficiencies and support the absolute critical path of growing tourism into this country. PREPARED STATEMENT Thank you for your time, and I look forward to your questions. [The statement follows:] Prepared Statement of Douglas A. Smith Chairman Landrieu, Vice Chairman Lautenberg, Senator Coats, and distinguished members of the subcommittee: Thank you for the opportunity to testify today about the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) current major travel initiatives. My name is Douglas Smith, and I am the Assistant Secretary for the Private Sector at DHS. I am the primary advisor to the Secretary on how DHS impacts the private sector, opportunities for public-private partnership, and how DHS impacts the economy. In my capacity as the Assistant Secretary for the Private Sector, I have served as the Department's representative on interagency working groups on travel and tourism, such as the Tourism Policy Council and the recently established Task Force on Travel and Competitiveness. Additionally, I am the DHS ex-officio member of the U.S. Travel and Tourism Advisory Board (TTAB), which advises the U.S. Government on policies and programs that affect the travel and tourism industry. I also serve on the President's Export Council on travel and tourism issues Given the President's recent Executive Order 13597, ``Establishing Visa and Foreign Visitor Processing Goals and the Task Force on Travel and Competitiveness,'' and the growth of a number of DHS travel and tourism-related programs and initiatives, today's hearing is especially timely. THE DEPARTMENT'S EFFORTS ON TRAVEL AND TOURISM At the onset, I want to stress DHS's commitment to the President's critically important initiative. There is no better area in which to showcase our dual goal of economic and national security than our work to foster and facilitate travel to and within the United States. My testimony will provide a brief overview of DHS support of the larger U.S. Government effort to foster and facilitate a thriving travel and tourism industry, the engagement my office has had with our private sector partners, and the steps DHS is taking to improve the traveler experience. Every year tens of millions of tourists from all over the world travel to see firsthand this great country. DHS plays a primary role in the facilitation of what amounted to a $134 billion industry in 2010. We secure passengers and their luggage before they board planes, we screen travelers as they enter our borders, and we play an important role in the visa process, among many other responsibilities. This is why Secretary Napolitano has made the facilitation and security of travel and tourism a priority for the Department. We are taking concrete steps at the President's direction, and are working closely with Congress and the Office of Management and Budget, to boost America's tourism industry so that we can grow our economy and create more jobs while continuing to secure our country. At DHS we believe the goals of economic prosperity and national security are fundamentally intertwined. At the interagency level, Federal Government collaboration to foster travel and tourism has never been stronger. President Obama's Executive order on January 19, 2012, has resulted in a coordinated interagency effort to streamline the visa issuance process, strengthen the Visa Waiver Program and trusted traveler programs, provide useful and accessible travel information online, and develop our country's first National Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Strategy. Through the interagency leadership of Secretary of Commerce Bryson and Secretary of the Interior Salazar, DHS works every day toward these commitments. I am also proud to say DHS is continuously striving to meaningfully incorporate and involve the travel and tourism industry in the policy- making process. Some of the stakeholders we regularly work with include the U.S. Travel Association, Airports Council International, Airlines for America, and--because this is a global effort--the International Air Transport Association (IATA). As Secretary Napolitano's representative to the TTAB, I work to ensure DHS has a formal, structured working relationship with the travel industry, engaging businesses on issues that matter most to industry. When the TTAB submits recommendations on behalf of industry, we not only share those perspectives with the appropriate program managers and leadership within DHS, but we also work with industry to leverage their expertise and partnership in identifying solutions to their recommendations. We have worked with businesses to share their best practices on customer service and queue management, promote DHS programs and initiatives, and we have even encouraged our ports of entry to engage and work directly with their industry stakeholders. Through our work with the TTAB and others, the travel and tourism industry is fully engaged in operations and policies that impact them. Agency-wide DHS is responsive to their needs and concerns. We are focused on making America as safe and as easy as possible to visit, and we view industry as a resource and a critical partner in this effort. THE TRAVELER EXPERIENCE The Department is working at each step of the travel experience to increase the number of legitimate travelers to the United States and facilitate their journey and entry in a safe and efficient way. I will describe examples pre-arrival, on arrival, and while traveling within the United States. As potential tourists are making their travel plans, DHS is a part of the effort to promote the United States as the destination of choice. In fiscal year 2011, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) managed the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) fee which collected over $116 million for the Corporation for Travel Promotion. ESTA fees are paid by travelers seeking to enter the United States under the Visa Waiver Program. The corporation, established by the 2010 Travel Promotion Act, is a public-private organization charged with promoting travel to the United States. The CBP ESTA Program is expected to collect the same amount, if not more, this fiscal year. My colleagues at CBP and I are closely engaged in that effort as the Corporation for Travel Promotion implements its global marketing strategy ``BrandUSA.'' In addition, as directed by the President's Executive order, the interagency Task Force on Travel and Competitiveness, is developing a National Travel and Tourism Strategy to promote domestic and international travel opportunities to and throughout the United States. After foreign tourists decide to travel to the United States, many must apply for a visa. DHS is currently collaborating with the Department of State (DoS) to strengthen visa processing, and facilitate legitimate travel and tourism. Under a new pilot, in select circumstances, qualified foreign visitors who were interviewed and thoroughly screened in conjunction with a prior visa application may be able to renew their visas without undergoing another interview. All applicants will still undergo thorough screening against inter-agency databases. However, this initiative will free resources to interview more first-time applicants. The resulting reduced visa application wait times are expected to encourage travel and tourism to the United States, especially among travelers from emerging markets. DHS is committed to supporting DoS in its goal to increase by 40 percent nonimmigrant visa processing capacity in China and Brazil specifically. When visitors arrive at our borders, CBP is improving the arrivals experience to make it more welcoming. Working with some of the most recognized brands in the tourism industry, CBP has improved passenger service training for our front-line officers, streamlined signage at our ports of entry, and implemented programs to speed passenger traffic through Federal Inspection Services areas. In addition to our internal efforts to make the ports of entry more welcoming, DHS recognizes that each port is unique in its facilities and the airlines, passengers, and local industry that it serves. For this reason, we have emphasized the importance of local external collaboration at each port of entry, where local companies, the airport authority, and DHS entities can engage in dialogue and work together to improve the port at the field level. Our first effort launched in Orlando, where DHS and the Greater Orlando Aviation Authority worked with the local travel and tourism industry to improve the signage and port facilities. Out of this partnership, DHS was also able to accommodate a new daily flight from Brazil to Orlando. This flight currently brings more than 200 tourists to Orlando every day. Local industry estimates this flight will have a $100 million annual economic impact. More achievements like this will be accomplished through c"
