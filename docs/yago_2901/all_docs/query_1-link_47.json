        "text": "Sunandha Kumariratana The Queen of Thailand\n\nin 1880\n\nshe\n\ndrowned\n\nwhile her subjects\n\nwatched\n\nthey\n\nwere\n\nforbidden\n\nto\n\ntouch her\n\nVincent Zepp about Vincent Zepp. Arriving at the time in history (including literary history) when I did. I was blessed to have such a rich tradition of poetry, art, music, and culture to available to me. This continues to allow my poetry to flourish in a rich loam of influences. The work I believe is representative of the best thoughts and intuitions of my generation of writers whose challenge is to move forward with the gifts given to us from previous generation of artists. From Ferlinghetti who opened my eyes to Pound and Eliot through the various significant literary and art movements of the 20th century. Then there was the haiku master Basho who showed us frogs leaping into the pond of our mind. John Berryman said our poetry should be something no one else could do. I’ve tried to focus on that idea."
