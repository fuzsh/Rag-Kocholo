        "text": "In Ancient Siam (modern-day Thailand), there were some laws that forbade people from touching members of the royal family. Under no circumstance was a person of royal blood allowed to mingle with others, who were seen as commoners. This rule was strictly followed and was quite prevalent during the 19th century.\n\nSadly, the rigid position of the above law led to the untimely death of one of the queens of Siam. Her name was Sunandha Kumariratana.\n\nWho was Sunandha?\n\nSunandha Kumariratana was the queen consort and first wife of King Chulalongkor of Siam (modern-day Thailand). At the age of 19, she and the King were already blessed with a baby girl and were expecting another child.\n\nIn May 1880, Sunandha embarked on a trip to the royal family’s residence outside Bangkok. Along with her daughter, some servants and guards, Sunandha proceeded to the royal family’s summer palace at Bang Pa- In. Unfortunately, things did not turn out as expected because it was during this time that tragedy struck."
