        "text": "Saw Ba U Gyi\n\nSaw Ba U Gyi ( 1905-1950)\n\nThere were many heroes who assisted their ethnic people while they were struggling with violence. Saw Ba U Gyi was the face of the Karen rebellion. He was best known as the founder of the Karen National Union (KNU). Ba U Gyi was a committed politician, who repeatedly voiced the Karen cause in negotiations with the British and the past-independence Burma government, and eventually resorted to an armed struggle. Saw Ba U Gyi was a famous Karen leader who was brave enough for the Karen people to get independence or freedom. He was a good person and worked for the Karen people. This article aims to explain about the life and legacy of Saw Ba U Gyi.\n\nBiographical sketch\n\nSaw Ba U Gyi was born in Bassein in 1905 to a wealthy landowning family. After he completed his degree at Rangoon University, in 1925 he went to London, studied at Cambridge University and became a lawyer. Two years later, he passed the English Bar in 1927. He returned to Burma in 1937, and he joined the government of Ba Maw SA, as Minister of Revenue. Later, Saw Ba Oo Gyi joined the pre-independence cabinet and he became Information Minister of Burma. Saw Ba Oo Gyi endeavored to gain independence for the Karen people. In September 1945, he was one of the leaders of the Karen Central Organization. Saw Ba Oo Gyi and the KCO asked the British to give them their own homeland. On 25 August 1946, he and the other Karen leaders went to London to get their homeland and freedom. At that time, the British had colonized Karen land and he went to Great Britain in an effort to get back the land for his people, but the British disagreed and did not give it back to them. Instead, the British gave it to Burma. On 27 January 1947, the British agreed with Aung San- Attlee, the Burmese president, and gave him power over the land. Moreover, the Anti-Fascist People’s Freedom League (AFPFL) gained rule over all of Burma. Saw Ba Oo Gyi also had joined the AFPFL political line but he resigned to lead the Karen National Union.\n\nHe is one who loved his people and cared for them. He wanted his people to have freedom and a separate Karen country. He didn’t want to fight with the other countries. He asked other countries to help the Karen people to get freedom. K.N.U is the Karen National Union. The K.N.U asked to give them Karen state, and said “from Karen one Key and the Burmese one Key.” But the Burmese people didn’t want the Karen state and they took control of all the territory.\n\nSaw Ba U Gyi also outlined what were to be the main principles and cornerstone of the Karen revolution:\n\n1. For us surrender is out of the question.\n\n2. The recognition of Karen state must be complete.\n\n3. We shall retain our arms.\n\n4. We shall decide our own political destiny.\n\nSaw Ba U Gyi knew that the Burmese took the Karen country and he asked the Burmese government to give back the Karen state but the Burmese said “No,” the government didn’t agree with them. Instead the Burmese government said, “This is my country,” and The Burma military came to invade the Karen's areas. Furthermore, they used violence on the Karen People and they killed many of the Karen people. Saw Ba U Gyi saw that the Karen people didn’t live together. Some Karen people lived in the forest. Burmese took the Karen girls and married them. The Karen boys had to work, but they didn’t get the food or drink.\n\nSaw Ba U Gyi and Karen soldiers worked together to get back the Karen country, and they fought the Burmese soldiers. Saw Ba U Gyi saw a lot of Burmese living in the state. After the negotiations with the AFPFL government for the benefit of the Karen Nation were unsuccessful, Saw Ba Oo Gyi worked in the Karen National Liberation Army (KNDO) in 1949 as a commander. On 12 August 1950 at the small village near Moulmein, 170 miles from Rangoon, Saw Ba Oo Gyi and other Karen were killed by the Burma military. In order to avoid making a shrine to the fallen Karen heroes, Ba u Gyi’s body was thrown into the sea. To this day the 12th of August is respected as Martyr’s Day and ceremonies marking saw Ba u Gyi’s death are conducted by Karen throughout the world.\n\nBy: Poe Aye\n\nReferences\n\nHorning, L.

When Ma Nwe’s husband found out that his wife was pregnant, he became doubtful and they argued with each other. The day that both Ma New and her cousins gave birth, one child was a girl and one was a boy. Let’s say it was a special day because when the baby girl came out, the baby’s body was very shiny. All the people who stayed there were surprised, including her husband. When he saw the thing that happened, he realized that this was a great child, not an ordinary child. The baby was so shiny, even though the father tried to cover the baby’s body, the baby stayed shiny. When they looked at the baby, they found that the baby was a girl, so they gave the baby a name called Mu Yeh Peh. For the baby boy, they give the name Saw Lar. When her mother was breastfeeding the mother could see the milk go through the baby’s throat because the baby’s throat was very shiny when she swallowed or ate something. As she grew up day by day her body's shininess became less, but her throat's shininess did not become less. (Karen Reminder History, 2020, Jan, 6).\n\nLoading...\n\nFrom 20 September 1853 to 23 October 1910, was the time of King Chulalongkorn who ruled Thailand. But it was not a very successful country. Even though he tried to build his own country, he cannot make it successful. One day he called his fortune teller to look for his country and what he had to do to make his country improve. After the fortune teller prediction was finished, he told the king that to make your country successful, you have to sacrifice one girl for your country to become successful. But to make it, you will have to use your money a lot to find this girl. The fortune told the king of the place where he could find the girl. After the king knew about that he started to prepare to find the Mu Yeh Peh. He let his savior look at all the girls who came and sold the things to his country. At that time a lot of village people came and sold things to his country including the Karen people. When Mu Yeh Peh’s mother knew that her friend would also go and sell things and get a lot of money, she also wanted the money. One morning, she talked to her daughter Mu Yeh Peh about letting her go and selling things in Thailand. For Mu Yeh Peh she knew that if she went something would happen to her and she will not be able to come back. But she didn’t tell her mother. The next morning her mother prepared the things that she will sell. But before she went, she told her mother that if she didn’t come back and if her mother saw some blood in her weaving to please clean it with cotton. After she finished she started to go. But her mother did not mind it. (Wai, n.d.).\n\nTo arrive in Thailand she had to pass through seven mountains. On the way that they went a lot of her friends tried to drink water but she didn’t drink any water because she was afraid that the others would see that her throat was shining. When they arrived in Thailand and after they sold the thing, she didn’t take a rest and came back Immediately. On the way that she came back she didn’t know that the king's soldiers were following behind her. When she arrived at the number 6 mountain she controlled herself, not drinking water because she became very thirsty. Before she drank the water she looked around her, but she didn’t see anyone so she started to drink water. The soldiers, who were hiding when they saw her drinking water and her throat were shiny so they immediately arrested her and brought her back to the King. When the King saw Mu Yeh Peh he fell in love with her but Mu Yeh Peh did not like him. Instead of sacrificing her, the king let her be his wife. When his older wife saw that he loved Mu Yeh Peh more than another wife, she was not satisfied with this. Later on, Mu Yeh Peh got two pregnant with the king. But both babies died when they were born because Mu Yeh Peh had sworn that she will not make any generations with Thai people. When the first time that he knew that the baby died he asked Mu Yeh Peh why the baby died? But Mu Yeh Peh answered that she did not know because after she gives birth to the baby she fainted. The second time the king got the same answer as the first time so he was not satisfied with it. (Karen Reminder History, 2020, Jan 6).\n\nWhen the king let his fortune-teller look for this problem after the fortune teller looked for it to finish he replied to the king that the baby’s death is not because of another kill but it is because Mu Yeh Peh has sworn. And the fortune-teller told to the king again that, \"I have told you before already right that this girl is one you have to sacrifice for your country, not become your wife.\" \"The thing that you are doing is wrong,\" said the fortune teller to the king. After that, the king thought and he decided to sacrifice the Mu Yeh Peh for his people to have a good life and his country to be successful in the future. In the morning he went and talked to Mu Yeh Peh that he will kill her and she replied yes you can kill me for your country. And the king said to her before I will sacrifice you for my country, tell me what you want, I will do for you everything that you want. And she replied I want you to promise with me in front of my people and your people. The king agreed with it. The king let her meet with her uncle Saw Lar and when she met she told her uncle that now the king is going to kill her but before I die, I would like to make some Loyalty between the Karen and the Thai people. (Scribd, n.d.).\n\nOn one regretful morning, the air was full of depressing sounds. Mu Yeh Peh sat on the king’s throne and wore the king’s shirt. She let her uncle Saw Lar and her people sit on the left-hand side, for the king and his people they sat on her right-hand side. So she started to make the loyalty between the Karen and the Thai people. She said, ”in the future if my people have to face the problem, my people will come to your country and you have to take care of them. You can not have a problem with my people. You have to let my people stay in your country with peace. If not, your country will not succeed. If you ever face the problem, you may rely on my people in future.“\n\nThis was the word that Mu Yeh Peh swore between the Karen and the Thai people. After that, she took off the king’s shirt and went down from the king’s throne. After this, the sacrifice offering began. At that time the air was full of sounds of people crying and sounds of the sacrifice. In addition, they let one of the blind elephants step on Mu Yeh Peh and the blood of that girl spread all around that place and one drop of her Blood spread to her weaving place. But at that time her mother felt regretful and crying so she forgot to clean the blood that was on My Yeh Peh’s weaving because she forgot the thing that her daughter said. The reason she let her mother clean for her is that she wanted to become her mother’s daughter again in another life. Her uncle Saw Le was still waiting for his cousin Mu Yeh Peh until now, no one knew whether he died or not. For Thailand, they became a successful and peaceful country. (Ta Bo Moo, 2020, December 24).\n\nKaren History\n\nIntroduction\n\nHistory is important to study because it is needed for all of us to understand ourselves. Knowing and understanding history is absolutely necessary to recognize what happened in the past and to notice the original character of the people we come from. In Myanmar, we can see a lot of interesting histories about different ethnicities. Among those, I would like to write and introduce the Karen's history such as their origins, culture, holidays, religion, language and revolution.\n\nThe Origin of the Karen\n\nAccording to tradition, the home-country of the Karen was the land called (Htee-Hseh-Meh-Ywa) ' Water pushes sand flows'. It means that it was the land that Sand Moves or Flows as a river, The River of Sand'. About 2,000 years ago, the Karen traveled from Tibet and China. Thus it seems that the Karen came from Mongolia, and they were a tribe of the Mongolian or Tibetan race in China. (Rajah, 2008)\n\nMigration to Burma\n\nKaren are also known as the Kayin. In the sixth or seventh century (AD) the Karen migrated to Burma from Southern China. The first migration of Karen was in 1125 B.C. and they were a migratory group that arrived in the region now called Burma. The Karen first settled down in a place and they called it the green country (Kaw Lah). When they migrated to Burma they entered three rivers. (Rajah, 2008)\n\nThe Karen entered to today's Myanmar along the three routes:\n\n1. The Mekong valley route\n\n2. The Irrawaddy valley route\n\n3. The Salween valley route\n\nCulture\n\nThe Don dance is a traditional Karen performance. \"Don\" roughly translates to \"in agreement\". The dance is a series of uniform movements accompanied by music played from traditional Karen instruments. During the performance, a \"Don Koh\" leads the troupe of dancers. The Don Dance originated from the Pwo Karen, who developed it as a way to reinforce community values. (Traditional Karen Don Dance, 2020, September 17)\n\nThe Sae Klee Dance or bamboo dance is a traditional Karen performance held during celebrations such as Christmas and New Year. Performers are typically divided into two groups. One group creates a platform by holding bamboo sticks in a checkered pattern, while the other group dances on top of the platform. Dancers must be careful to avoid stepping into one of the platform's many holes. (SU-KNYA Channel, 2018, January 14)\n\nHolidays\n\nThe Karen New Year is one of the major holidays that the Karen people celebrate. The date of the Karen New Year on the Gregorian calendar varies as the Karen people use the lunar calendar. The Karen New Year usually falls on a date in December or January on the Gregorian calendar.\n\nKaren Wrist Tying is an important Karen holiday. This holiday is observed annually in August.\n\nKaren Martyrs' Day (Ma Tu Ra) commemorates the Karen soldiers who have died fighting for Karen self-determination. It is observed annually on 12 August, the anniversary of the death of Saw Ba U Gyi, the first President of the Karen National Union. (Wikipedia, n. d.)\n\nReligion\n\nIn our Karen community, we have five known religious beliefs such as Animism, Buddhism, Christianity, Lehkai, and Telahkon. Of these five, the majority of the Karen are Animist, Buddhist, and Christian.\n\nLanguage\n\nKaren languages are spoken in lower Burma and on the Thai border. The Karen language is generally divided into three groups: northern (including farmers), central (Bwe and Geba) and southern (including Pwo Karen and Skaw); Only Pwo Karen and Skaw from the southern group have writing systems. Top scholars believe that the Karen language is related to the Tibetan-Burmese group of the Sino-Tibetan language family, but the relationship does not appear to be close. Around 1830, an American Baptist Missionary created a written script for Karen. This was developed from the Burmese alphabet. (Phan. n. d.)"
