        "text": "Queen Saovabha Phongsri (Thai: เสาวภาผ่องศรี; RTGS: Saowapha Phongsi (Pronunciation)) was an agnatic half-sister and queen of King Chulalongkorn (Rama V) of Thailand, and mother of both King Vajiravudh (Rama VI) and King Prajadhipok (Rama VII). As in accordance with Thai royal tradition, King Vajiravudh later bestowed on his mother the title of \"Queen Mother Sri Bajrindra\" (Thai: ศรีพัชรินทร; RTGS: Si Phatcharin).\n\nLife\n\nSaovabha was born as a Princess of Siam to King Mongkut (or Rama IV) and Princess Consort Piyamavadi (Piam Sucharitakul). She was the youngest sister of the future Queen Sunandha Kumariratana and Queen Savang Vadhana. Saovabha became the consort of her half-brother King Chulalongkorn sometime in 1878. She gave him 9 children, 5 would survive to adulthood (one died in infancy), two would eventually become King of Siam.\n\nIn 1897, Queen Saovabha became the first female Regent of Siam, when her husband went on a tour of Europe. When he returned he bestowed upon her the title of \"Somdet Phra Nang Chao Saowapha Phongsi Praborommarachininat\" (RTGS) (Thai: สมเด็จพระนางเจ้าเสาวภาผ่องศรี พระบรมราชินีนาถ) (roughly equivalent to H.M. the Queen Regent). During her time as queen, she took many interests, especially in the issues concerning women. In 1904 she established one of the first schools for girls in Siam; the \"Rajini School\" or Queen's School in Bangkok.\n\nWhen she died in 1919 at the age of 58, she was given a grand Royal Funeral, attended by all members of the Siamese Royal Family, and the ceremony was presided over by her son King Vajiravudh. She played a prominent posthumous role in the 1924 Palace Law of Succession, in which her son King Vajiravudh stipulated that her children would take precedent among all others over the line of succession. This guaranteed the accession of her youngest son Prince Prajadhipok to the throne in 1925, despite there being more senior and learned sons of Chulalongkorn. The Queen Saovabha Memorial Institute was named after her.\n\nChildren\n\nShe had 9 children with King Chulalongkorn:\n\nName Birth Death Spouse Children Bahurada Manimaya, Princess Debanariratana 19 December 1878 27 August 1887 Vajiravudh 1 January 1880 25 November 1925 Prabai Sucharitakul None Princess Vannabimol Varavan None Prueng Sucharitakul None Krueakaew Abhaiwongse Princess Bejaratana Rajasuda Prince Tribejrutama Dhamrong 8 February 1881 22 November 1887 Chakrabongse Bhuvanath, Prince of Bisnulok 3 March 1883 13 June 1920 Ekaterina Ivanovna Desnitskaya Prince Chula Chakrabongse Princess Javalit Obhas Rabibadhana None Prince Siriraj Kakudhabhanda 27 November 1885 3 May 1887 Princess (Unnamed) 13 December 1884 13 December 1884 Asdang Dejavudh, Prince of Nakhon Rajasima 12 May 1889 9 February 1924 Paew Suddhiburana None Chudadhuj Dharadilok, Prince of Bejraburana 5 July 1892 8 July 1923 La-or Sirisambandh Princess Sudasiri Sobha Ravi Kayananda Prince Varananda Dhavaj Princess Bunchiradhorn Jumbala None Prajadhipok 8 November 1893 30 May 1941 Princess Rambai Barni Svastivatana None\n\nIn addition, the queen also adobted one of Savang Vadhana's daughters, Princess Valaya Alongkorn and raised as her own daughter."
