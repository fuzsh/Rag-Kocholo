        "text": "\"Convention of 11 August 1880\n\nArticle 1.\n\nHer Majesty's Government agrees to take part with other Powers having Treaty relations with Siam in the framing of proper Regulations for the control of the Liquor Traffic in Siam, on the following basis:\n\nThe importation of spirituous liquors of such inferior quality as to render the sale thereof deleterious to the public health to be prohibited.\n\nA reasonable import duty to be imposed on spirituous liquors.\n\nThe sale of spirituous liquors by retail or, under a prescribed quantity to be prohibited except by persons holding a Government licence, for which a reasonable fee shall be charged.\n\nThe regulations shall not apply to wine or beer, which shall be admitted at the general ad valorem rate of duty in force for the time being.\n\nArticle 2.\n\nSubject to the conditions of Art. III of the present Convention, the restrictions contained in Art. IV of the Treaty in 1856, as to the residence of British subjects in Siam, and to the purchase or renting by them of houses and lands, and the building of houses, are hereby cancelled.\n\nArticle 3.\n\nBritish subjects wishing to reside in any part of Siamese territory beyond the limits prescribed in Art. IV of the Treaty of 1855 must first apply to the British official, who will inform the Siamese authorities of such desire, whereupon the Siamese authorities, conjointly with the British official, will decide if the requisite permission shall be given, but permission shall not be withheld without reasonable cause.\n\nArticle 4.\n\nIn the event of foreign or intestine war or rebellion, the Siamese Government may at once prohibit and stop the export trade in rice, fish, and salt by Proclamation, such prohibition taking immediate effect.\n\nThe export of the same articles may also be prohibited in the event of expected scarcity, but in such case prohibition shall not take effect till the expiry of one calendar month after the date thereof.\n\nIn either of the above cases, merchants shall render to the government, within fourteen days of any such Proclamation as aforesaid, an account of what rice they may have in store, or in respect of which they shall have made a bona fide contract of purchase for exportation; and all the rice so indicated may be exported but merchants are prohibited from exporting any other rice than that which they shall indicate as above within such fourteen days.\n\nArticle 5.\n\nThe Siamese Government may levy a reasonable duty upon all goods not specified in the tariffs; they will, however, conjointly with Her Britannic Majesty's representative, from time to time decide and agree upon the amount of duty as to be collected.\n\nArticle 6.\n\nThe general import trade duty up to this time having been three percent ad valorem, the Siamese Government may increase the same by the addition of two percent, thus making five percent, provided that the increased duty shall not be levied until six months after the ratification of this convention.\n\nArticle 7.\n\nAll custom-house officers, and officers of stations, authorised by the Siamese government in provinces and districts, shall have the right to search for, and, in case of discovery, to confiscate contraband goods, and goods, in respect of which the payment of duty has been evaded.\n\nThey shall also have power to examine all persons in a proper manner, in accordance with regulations to be made on that behalf in concert with the representatives of the Powers having Treaty relations with Siam.\n\nPenalties can only be levied and enforced by the confiscation of the articles which have evaded the payment of duty, and which will thereupon become the property of the Government.\n\nArticle 8.\n\nThe Siamese Government reserve the right of working any mine, or dealing with any minerals, which may at any time be discovered within the Siamese dominions, but this right may be leased or assigned wholly or in part to British subjects on payment of rent or royalty, or such other terms as may be agreed in each separate instance, between the representative of Her Majesty and the Siamese Government.\n\nNothing in this article shall affect the present vested rights of any British, subject in any mine or minerals.\n\nArticle 9.\n\nNo Siamese subject shall be entitled to any exemption from Siamese law except to such extent as is recognised in Great Britain in the case of servants employed by a Minister of Diplomatic Agent, and then only while in such actual employ.\n\nShould a British subject desire to engage a Siamese subject, either as an agent for the purpose of trading in any part of the Siamese dominions, or as a domestic servant, a contract must be made before the Siamese authorities to be registered with them. In the event of any difficulty arising in any part of such dominions, the agent or servant, as the case may be, shall apply to the provincial offers, who shall examine into and settle the matter in dispute.\n\nAn agent or servant employed under such a contract shall enjoy British protection, but shall not be entitled to any exemption from Siamese law.\n\nArticle 10.\n\nSiamese subjects residing for a time in British countries, and there becoming naturalised British subjects, shall, on returning to Siam, again become the subjects of Siam as they were originally born.\n\nIn the case of mixed marriages between British and Siamese subjects, the nationality of the husband shall prevail.\n\nArticle 11.\n\nChinese, and people of other races than British, who are not born or naturalised in a British Colony or Possession, but coming from thence provided with a passport from British authorities giving them British protection, shall, after residing three years in Siam, lose such protection and come under general protection of Siamese law, and the British authorities shall thereafter not interfere.\n\nArticle 12.\n\nAny British subject openly guilty of crime may be arrested, and any house or property belonging to a British subject suspected of being used as a place of shelter for unlawful objects or purposes may be searched by the Siamese authorities.\n\nBut such arrest or search shall not, except under circumstances of special urgency, take place without notice being previously given to, and the concurrence requested of, the British authorities, provided a British official is resident within a distance of ten miles. If there be no British official resident within the distance of ten miles, the arrest or search may be immediately executed, but the earliest possible notice shall be given to the nearest British official, in order to further proceeding in the case.\n\nArticle 13.\n\nBritish shipping and trade shall be free at all the ports and within the entire Kingdom of Siam and its dependencies as regards all manner of merchandise not contraband, on payment of the duties thereon, export or import as laid down in the tariff of the Treaty of 1856, and except as after-mentioned, shall be liable to no other charges or dues whatever, either at the coast or frontiers of the Kingdom, its provinces and its dependencies.\n\nAll dues for pilotage, lighterage, harbour lights and all such matters will continue to be levied as at present by the Siamese authorities.\n\nAny modification or alteration to be introduced subsequent to the present convention shall be agreed to in concert with the representatives of the Powers having Treaties with Siam.\n\nArticle 14.\n\nIt is agreed that the treaty between the King of Siam and the Government of India of 1874 shall be cancelled, and new arrangements for the purpose of promoting commercial intercourse between British Burmah and the adjoining territory of Chiangmai, Lakon, and Lampoonchi, belonging to Siam and of preventing dacoity and other heinous crimes in the territories aforesaid, shall be entered into by Supplementary Articles to be annexed to the Convention.\n\nArticle 15.\n\nBritish vessels of war arriving at Paknam [ปากน้ำ; heute: Samut Prakan - สมุทรปราการ] in need of docking repairs or supplies shall on application to the Siamese Government, receive all necessary and convenient assistance from the same.\n\nThis article is to be understood as applicable to every other port of Siam, so far as the nature of the locations may require or permit.\n\nArticle 16.\n\nIf any British vessel be at any time wrecked or stranded on the coast of Siam, or compelled to take refuge in any port on the same, the Siamese authorities shall, on being informed of the fact, render every assistance in their power in regard of the crew, cargo, or vessel, and shall, if necessary, furnish the crew with means of conveyance to the nearest consular station.\n\nSimilar assistance will be rendered by the British authorities to any Siamese vessel or its crew, if wrecked, stranded or compelled to take refuge on the British coasts.\n\nArticle 17.\n\nThe provisions of the present convention are to be understood as having effect in all tributary or independent States and Provinces of the Kingdom of Siam in the same manner as within the Kingdom itself.\n\nArticle 18.\n\nThis convention being supplementary to the Treaty of Friendship and Commerce between Her Majesty and the King of Siam of April 1855, and the Supplementary Agreement thereto of May 18, 1856, it is understood that the provisions of the said Treaty and Agreement are to remain in force and to be observed, subject to the modifications hereby agreed to, and to such further modifications as may be made by the Supplementary Articles to be entered into under Article 17 of the Convention.\n\nArticle 19."
