        "text": "The biographical book Katya & The Prince Of Siam, published for the first time in 1994, has been a source of knowledge and insight for Thai history buffs, and they have longed for more stories about a Siamese prince who fell in love with a Russian woman before their marriage ended sadly over a century ago. The wait is over with the recent launch of the first comprehensive exhibition and a new book on the prince's life and work.\n\n\"Duty And Passion: The Life And Times Of Prince Chakrabongse\", an exhibition of historical correspondence based on the royal letters of King Chulalongkorn (Rama V) and one of his sons, Prince Chakrabongse, is being held until the end of September at the Police Museum, formerly Parusakawan Palace's Chitralada Villa, which was the prince's home. Hosted by the Chakrabongse family, River Books and the Police Museum, the exhibit depicts the life and achievements of Prince Chakrabongse who was born on March 3, 1883. It provides rare opportunities to see major documents and artefacts from the late 19th century.\n\n\"There are currently two exhibitions at Wang Parus. One about my grandfather Prince Chakrabongse and one about Siam and the World War I,\" said MR Narisa Chakrabongse, the only granddaughter of Prince Chakrabongse and CEO of River Books.\n\n\"The one on my grandfather covers the main events in his life from his birth to King Rama V and Queen Saovabha in 1883 through his education in England and Russia, his marriage to a Russian woman, his return to Siam and scandal about the marriage, his work in the army and his early death in 1920.\"\n\nThe stories about the life and work of Prince Chakrabongse and the close relations between the Russian royal family and the royal court of Siam are told through royal letters, rare documents and artefacts. They serve not only as the background of a princely romantic story and glimpses of court life, but also tell of international relations and the tumult of the early 19th century.\n\nSiam and Russia began their official ties in 1897 when King Chulalongkorn visited Russia and stayed with Tsar Nicholas II, whom he had first met in 1891. During the stay, he decided to send one of his sons, Prince Chakrabongse, to study in Russia. The prince remained in St Petersburg for eight years. \"A lot of the exhibition is photographs and pictures. However there are some artefacts -- jackets worn by my grandfather over 130 years ago, bronzes of my grandfather's horse and Tsar Nicholas II. There are letters from my grandfather to Katya written from the Winter Palace, and to King Chulalongkorn both in Thai and English,\" MR Narisa added.\n\nThe collection of royal letters was inherited by Prince Chula Chakrabongse, Prince Chakrabongse's son, and later were stolen. The news about these letters emerged in 1995 when Christie's announced its auction of this collection of letters.\n\nOn Nov 12, 1995, the Bangkok Post reported: \"More than 400 letters written by members of the royal family of Thailand, including a confession of love by Prince Chakrabongse, will be the 'jewel of the crown' at Christie's sale of autographed letters and manuscripts on Nov 29.\"\n\nMR Narisa worked tirelessly to halt the auction and the majority of the collection is now housed in the British Library. However, significant letters, diaries and other artefacts are part of the Chakrabongse Collection and more than 400 pieces are now on show for the first time at this exhibition.\n\n\"I am always impressed by how well my grandfather adapted to life in Russia. He often delivered letters between the Tsar and King Chulalongkorn and met with ministers, statesmen and other members of European royalty. When the Russo-Japanese war broke out, the Prince was very upset but then he actually served in the Hussars, training the new recruits as all the other officers had gone to war. This was something that his commanding officer said he would remember for the rest of his life,\" she said.\n\nAlso on view at the Police Museum as part of the celebration of 120 years of Thai-Russian ties is the \"Siam And World War I\" exhibition on Siam's decision to enter the war and send an expeditionary force to France. It documents Siam's roles in World War I and the advantages gained internationally and domestically.\n\nThe exhibit marks the centenary of Siam's declaration of war by King Vajiravudh (Rama VI) on July 22, 1917. Prince Chakrabongse who was the commander-in-chief of the Royal Siamese Army organised the Siamese Expeditionary Force sent to France. The most important outcome of joining the war was that Siam renounced its unfair treaty with Germany and Austria-Hungary and also accelerated negotiations to revise the unequal treaties that Siam had with France, Great Britain and other European countries.\n\nBoth exhibitions were inspired by the appropriate timing when MR Narisa was about to wrap up a long project to translate King Chulalongkorn and Prince Chakrabongse's 300 or so letters six months before the celebration of 120 years of Thai-Russian relations.\n\nThese are also thanks to support from the former director of the Police Museum who is a big fan of Prince Chakrabongse.\n\nAt these two exhibitions, visitors can check out River Books' two new beautifully illustrated tomes: Letters From St. Petersburg -- A Siamese Prince At The Court Of The Last Tsar, a book recording the life of Prince Chakrabongse during his time in Russia, and Siam And World War I by Stefan Hell, an illustrated account of Siam's involvement in the \"war to end all wars\".\n\nAccording to the publisher, Letters From St. Petersburg tells the story of the Prince's life and successes through the about 230 letters he wrote to his father and from the King to his son. These letters provide an insight into the events which occurred in their lives and their views on a broad range of subjects -- events of the day, family matters, the weather, their health, their missing each other, the King admonishing his son when he felt he was going astray and more.\n\nThe second book is an introduction to the role of Siam in joining World War I a century ago. Besides outlining the background and buildup as well as the lives of Germans interned in Bangkok and Siamese students interned in Germany, it details the story of the Siamese Expeditionary Force in France and how they invaded Germany. It also highlights the diplomatic significance of Siam being on the winning side and taking part in the Versailles peace talks.\n\nAlthough the story of a prince seems to be very far from the daily lives and interests of some people, especially the young generation and non-history enthusiasts, MR Narisa believes the exhibition is worth exploration by anyone.\n\n\"My grandfather's story is a romantic and intriguing one. My grandfather graduated top of his class after only learning Russian from 14 onwards. This is quite inspirational and shows that hard work and determination leads to success. He also had a very close relationship with the last Tsar, which is fascinating from an historical point of view in an era in Thailand when history is becoming less important. I think we need to fight against this trend.\n\n\"I think the fact that my grandmother adapted so well to Thai life and overcame prejudice is also an important lesson that is relevant today when there are attempts to impose a monocultural Thainess and it can raise interesting questions about ethnicity and belonging,\" she said."
