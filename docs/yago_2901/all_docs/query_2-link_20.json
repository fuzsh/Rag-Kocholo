        "text": "At home, she was called Kateryna Desnytska, but in Siam, they called her Mom Katerin Na Phitsanulok. What is the story behind the Ukrainian girl turned socialite and later, nurse, who became the Princess of Siam?\n\nFrom a nurse to a prince’s love\n\nBorn in Lutsk, modern-day Ukraine (then a part of the Russian Empire), on April 27, 1886, Kateryna was brought up in a wealthy family as one of twelve children. Her father Ivan Desnytsky, chief judge of the Lutsk District Court, died when she was only two. When he passed away, Kateryna’s mother Maria Desnytska (née Khyzhnyakova) moved the family to Kyiv. There, Kateryna studied at the prestigious Fundukleyiv Women’s Gymnasium.\n\nAfter graduating in 1904, Kateryna moved to St. Petersburg with her brother, where she began studying as a nurse. It was in 1905 that the young girl met the Siamese prince of Bishnulok, son of King Chulalongkorn, Chakrabongse Bhuvanath, at a ball. The prince had previously arrived in the Russian Empire to study at the Imperial Page Corps.\n\nDespite hitting it off straight away, Desnytska went on to volunteer as a nurse in Manchuria where Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905 continued. Kateryna’s decision to leave for war upset Prince Chakrabongse, but it didn’t put him off his pursuit of her. The prince wrote her letters and sent her flowers all throughout her absence before she returned to St. Petersburg from the war with several decorations to her name. Subsequently, Prince Chakrabongse proposed to Kateryna. Upon accepting, she issued one condition: that in lieu of the traditionally tolerated in Siam polygamy, she was to be the Siamese prince’s only wife – and he agreed.\n\nWinning over the in-laws\n\nBecause of the couple’s different faiths – Kateryna was an Orthodox Christian and Prince Chakrabongse was a Buddhist – many local Russian priests refused to marry them. As a result, the couple traveled to Constantinople and generously paid an Orthodox priest who agreed to join the two in matrimony. After marrying, they went to Egypt for their honeymoon before traveling to Singapore. There, Prince Chakrabongse left Kateryna for Siam, where he wished to warm up his parents to the prospects of a foreign daughter-in-law. It wasn’t easy – King Rama V was unhappy about the idea of his son, then second in line to the throne, having a European wife.\n\nThe king’s wife, Queen Saovabha, was also not accepting of Kateryna. Yet eventually, having become a fluent Thai speaker and gotten to know the ways of court life, Kateryna succeeded in winning over her parents-in-law, who gave her the name Mom Katerin Na Phitsanulok in a nod of approval for her marriage to a prince of royal blood.\n\nLovestory turned nightmare\n\nIn 1908, Kateryna gave birth to a son, Prince Chula Chakrabongse, who became the royal couple’s first grandchild. The couple went on several trips visiting Kateryna’s relatives in Ukraine after stopping in St. Petersburg.\n\nA few years into their marriage, in 1912, tragedy struck when Desnytska found out that her husband had an affair with his fifteen-year-old distant niece, Javalit Obhas Rabibadhana. The development was worsened when Prince Chakrabongse gave the young girl the status of a royal wife, while swearing to Kateryna that she remained his number one. It was an irreparable blow to Kateryna’s faith in their marriage and she filed for divorce, which was granted.\n\nAfter the couple divorced in 1919, the princess-turned-back-to-commoner was forced to leave her son Chula behind. Wanting to go back to Ukraine, but unable to make the journey as First World War raged on, Kateryna moved to Beijing to live with her brother. While in China, Desnytska began working for the Red Cross and eventually met American engineer Harry Clinton Stone, whom she married. The couple went on to move to Paris, and later, the United States.\n\nAfter they divorced, Kateryna returned to France and settled near Paris, where she died aged 74 years old on Jan. 3, 1960. While Kateryna’s story is a fascinating one, it remains a chapter of hidden history unknown to most not least in part owing to her figure having been co-opted by Russian historiography. As such, a Ukrainian girl from Lutsk, Volyn region in Ukraine, is frequently cited as a “Russian girl from Kiev,” and Kateryna’s name often can be seeen transliterated in Russian as Ekaterina Desnitskaya. Kateryna Desnytska has thereby inadvertedly joined the long list of Ukrainian historic figures to have their origins erased and their stories appropriated by Russia. Nevertheless, her life posits a captivating case of a connection between Ukraine and modern-day Thailand.\n\nText: Kvitka Perehinets"
