        "text": "For those gasping — or maybe slightly chuckling — at the idea of Jon and Dany formalizing their relationship despite being suprisingly closely related, may I present thousands of years of worldwide dynastic marriages, aka royal in-breeding?\n\nWe're talking \"Game of Thrones,\" of course, not real life. Or are we? George R.R. Martin's breadbox-sized tomes draw heavily on English and Germanic traditions, and in their unblinking bloodiness, horror and bizarre family relations, from throughout this wide, weird world.\n\nPtolemaic dynasty rulers frequently married siblings, some years before DNA was discovered. King Tut himself was the product of incest, which DNA, since discovered, has confirmed. Keeping it all in the family, Tutankhamun married half-sister Ankhesenamun. Akhenaten, aka Amenhotep IV, married his sister. Ancient Greek Princess Laodice IV married not one, not two, but three of her brothers.\n\nIn Roman Egypt, roughly 30 BC forward, after the defeat of Mark Antony and Cleopatra (who married both of her brothers; 'course, she may have murdered one or both as well, so all's fair), sibling marriage was preferred among royalty, building upon the mythic Osiris and Isis hookup. John V, Count of Armagnac and Isabelle d'Armagnac, full siblings, married in 1450, though a supposed papal dispensation for this agreement was later found to have been forged.\n\nThe fifth monarch of Siam, Chulalongkorn, King Rama V (son of Rama IV, the et-cetera dude from the musical \"The King and I\") married his first cousins Narinaka, Saovabhak Nariratana, and Saisavali Bhiromya, and yet somehow found time to wed half-sisters Sunandha Kumariratana, Savang Vadhana, Saovabha Phongsri, Sukhumala Marasri and Thaksincha.\n\nSay those five monarchs fast.\n\nAnd speaking of dudes from famous shows, King Leonidas of Sparta, infamous flexer and bellower from Zack Snyder's oh-so-testosteriffic \"300,\" married his niece Gorgo, before dying with a heroic, muscle-bound bellow. \"This! Is! Legal! (Muttering) At this place and point in time.\" In ancient Greece, half-siblings with different mothers, same fathers, could marry, as could uncles with nieces.\n\nEmperor Claudius married his niece Agrippa. Maria I of Portugal married her uncle. Hawaiian royalty often married siblings.\n\nAnd then of course there's pretty much the whole House of Habsburg/Hapsburg, which died out in 1700, after Charles II left no heirs. Historians determined he'd suffered numerous congenital deformations due to centuries of in-breeding. Probably, despite the title, he wasn't such an attractive match. Or maybe his standards were too high. Maybe he wanted to marry someone he hadn't met at family reunion.\n\nSo after all that, cousin-marriage might seem downright — well, somewhat — less creepy. And here, it's not just royalty at play.\n\nQueen Victoria married first cousin Albert, kicking off a long line of in-breeding. Mark Antony married first cousin Antonia, and later fourth cousin Octavia. Biblical Jacob married two of his first cousins, Leah and Rachel.\n\nThe current queen of England, Liz, and her hubby, Phillip, are second AND third cousins. The most recent (and perhaps last) dynastic marriage was arranged in 1982.\n\nMusicians can play: Johann Sebastian Bach married second cousin Maria. Edvard Grieg married first cousin Nina. Sergei Rachmaninoff married cousin Natalia. Igor Stravinsky married first cousin Katerina.\n\nFilmmaker David Lean married first cousin Isabel. Actress Greta Scacchi married first cousin Carlo. H.G. Wells married first cousin Isabel Mary. Werner von Braun married first cousin Maria Luise.\n\nAlbert Einstein and Charles Darwin — who you'd think have known better — married their first cousins, Elsa and Emma, respectively. When is Disney going to film THAT animated classic?\n\nAlso, Darwin and Emma's siblings Caroline and Josiah married (each other), and their grandparents, Sarah Wedgwood and Josiah Wedgwood, were third cousins.\n\nPerhaps this explains Darwin's fascination with origins.\n\nIt's a game Americans play, too. FDR and Eleanor were fifth cousins, though that seems almost nitpicky.\n\nSecond President John Adams married third cousin Abigail; his grandson John Adams II married his first cousin Mary Catherine. John Q. Adams' granddaughter Mary Louisa married her second cousin William. Another John Q. Adams granddaughter, Mary Gardiner, married her cousin Henry, though to be fair, Henry was described as \"distant.\"\n\nThe Adams-Adams family. Click click.\n\nThomas Jefferson's wife Martha was his third cousin. Eighth U.S. President Martin van Buren wed first cousin Hannah. Seventh U.S. Pres. John C. Calhoun married cousin Floride.\n\nSamuel F.B. Morse's second wife — short short, long long — was his first cousin Sarah.\n\nThe 38th governor of Alabama, Bibb Graves wed his first cousin Dixie, and yes, I do believe we are distantly related from my grandmother, Dad's mom, who was a Graves.\n\nOutlaws can become in-laws: Jesse James wed his first cousin, Zerelda \"Zee\" Mimms. Rob Roy MacGregor married first cousin Mary Helen.\n\nEdgar Allen Poe married his first cousin Virginia. ... when she was 13, and he 27.\n\nIt's only rock 'n' roll, but eww: Jerry Lee Lewis married his first cousin Myra ... when she was 13, and he 22. Dennis Wilson of the Beach Boys married his cousin Shawn Marie Love. Rudy Giuliani married his second cousin Regina, and I'd be curious to know how many of his predecessors were closely related.\n\nBuddha Gautama married his first cousin Yaśodhara, proving love can come from within.\n\nSo do Jon and Dany stand a chance? Sunday's epic — it's said to run an hour and 20 minutes — third episode of the final season may settle the question before it unsettles the kingdom. Though the \"GoT\" creators sit tightly on details, it's known that Miguel Sapochnik returned to direct. He's the guy behind stunning episodes \"Hardhome\" and \"Battle of the Bastards,\" both remarkable for epic battle scenes that, while running extended lengths, never really lose steam, or lose track of who's dismembering whom, balancing character and heartache with gore and tension.\n\nAfter Sapochnik and the Night King's ice zombies finish slicing through Westeros, maybe the living will consider that any warm blood is a good blood.\n\nReach Tusk Editor Mark Hughes Cobb at mark.cobb@tuscaloosanews.com or 205-722-0201."
