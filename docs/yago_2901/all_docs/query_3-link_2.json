From the very first time I went there, it was a fulfillment of my childhood fantasies of the way travel should be.”\n\nAnthony Bourdain\n\nDuring our recent November 2023 holiday in Thailand, my husband, sister, and I had the privilege of exploring Wat Ku.\n\nThis extraordinary temple in Nonthaburi is easily accessible for a day trip from Bangkok, making it suitable for those with limited time.\n\nMy sister, an American expatriate residing in Thailand, was introduced to the temple by her Thai friend.\n\nMy sister expressed enthusiasm about showcasing its beauty. She suggested that I write about the poignant narrative associated with the temple."
