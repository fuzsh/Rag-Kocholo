Research Notes:

A Genealogy of the Allen Family recounts several of the facts that are documented above. [51] A genealogy of the Babcock family has similar information. [52] A genealogical descent from Nocholas to Tobias has been publihsed. [53]

Substantial research has been reported about Chad Brown. [66] [67]

1638-1657 A biosketch from Portsmouth reports: Nicholas Brown was made a freeman in 1638. His house lot is now known as the "Fishermans Lot" on Anthony Road. He also owned land south of Church Lane, as well as land on the southwest corner of Hedley Street. A lot of about six acres on the south side of Hedley Street, at the brook, was also granted him. In 1657 he had a grant on the west side of Jepson Lane. [Edward Homer West. History of Portsmouth, 1638-1936 (1936), no page numbers]

Nicholas Brown, of Reading, Massachusetts, was the son of Edward Brown of Inkborrow, Worcestershire, England. Nicholas Brown, of Reading, Massachusetts, was a different person from Nicholas Brown of Providence, Rhode Island.

Robinson discusses a Nicholas Browne of Lynn and Reading, Massachusetts. [69] Robinson states that this Nicholas Browne was the son of Edward Brown of Inkborrow Worcestershire, England, and Jane Lide, daughter of Thomas Lide, that the will of this Nicholas Browne was dated and proved in 1673, and that Nicholas had children John, Edward, Joseph, Sarah, Cornelius, Josiah, and Elizabeth.

Cyrus Brown states that Nicholas Browne of Reading did not mention a son named Thomas in his will and concludes that Nicholas Browne of Reading was not the father of Thomas Browne of Lynn. [70]

1628 Jane, the wife of Edward Browne, was buried on April 17, 1628, in Inkberrow, Worcestershire, England. [71]

Parish of Inkberrow, Names of those buried in 1628 "April 17 Jane uxor Edwardi Browne"

Keith Harrison conflated Nicholas Browne of Rhode Island (will dated 1694) and Nicholas Browne of Lynn and Reading Massachusetts (will dated 1673). [72]

1660 Nicholas Browne of Reading executed a power of attorney which confirms the identity of his parents.[73]

In 1660, Mr. Browne sent his son John to England to look after certain property to which he had become heir, and furnished his son with a power of attorney, of which the following is a copy:--

"Know all men by these presents, that Nicholas Browne, of Redding, in the County of Middlesex, in the Massachusetts Colonie of New England, sonne of Jane, the daughter of Thomas Lide, which said Jane was the wife of Edward Browne, father of the said Nicholas, who lived and died in the parish of Inkburrow, in the County of Woster, in the realme of England ; the said Nicholas Browne, on the fifth day of October, in the year of our Lord one thousand six hundred and sixty, stile of England, appeared before me, Robert Howard, dwelling in Boston in the Colonie aforesaid, Notary and Tubellion public by authority of the General Court of the said Colonie, admitted and sworne, and in presence of the witnesses hereafter named, the said Nicholas Browne declared and manifested that of his own accord he hath nominated, assigned, made, ordayned, constituted and appointed, and in his place and stead, by these presents, doth nominate, assign, make, ordayne, constitute and appoint his eldest sonne, John Browne, now bound for England, his true and lawful attorney, for him the said Nicholas Browne, his father, in his name and stead and to his use, to call William Rand of Inkborough aforesaid to accompt what of shops, houses and lands, that by discovery are found to be appertayning and belonging unto him the said Nicholas Browne as next heir unto the Lides, which the said Rand by former power unto him granted from the said Nicholas Browne hath recovered.

Nicholas Browne. (L.S.)

Signed &c. in presence of Robt. Howard Not. Pub.

This Deed acknowledged by the said Nicholas Browne, Oct 6, 1660.

Before me, Ri. Bellingham, Depy. Govr."

However, there are also reports that Nicholas Brown had siblings Lydia and Preserve Brown, which are names that were used in subsequent generations of this family. Is there any basis for this? A biosketch of daughter Jane Brown reports [74]:

Jane (Brown) Babcock was the daughter of Nicholas Brown (1601-11/16/1694) and Elizabeth (Leids) Brown (1605 - 11/1/1674). Nicholas Brown was from Inkburrow Parish, Worcestershire, England and Elizabeth (Leids) Brown was from Malford, Worcestershire, England. … Nicholas Brown's father's name is unknown. His mother was Sarah Leids (abt 1578 - ?) from Inkberrow, Worcestershire, England. Nicholas Brown's siblings were Ann (Brown) Hawkes (1595 - 12/4/1669), Lydia (Brown) (abt 1602 - ?), and Preserve Brown (1604-?). All of the children were born in Worcestershire, England.

Stillwell published a biosketch (including some speculations) for the family of Nicholas Brown [75]:

He was, apparently, an Episcopalian and was liberal in his donations to that Church. Nicholas Brown married three times.

The plaintiff replies that Benjamin West, being dead, and he, the nearest relative, the right is now vested in him. John Slocum for evidence saith that the mare sewed for was a mare formerly called the difference mare and was accounted a stray, and that when the mare was about to be branded, Kathrine Brown forewarned the branding of her, but Christopr Almy told her lett the mare be branded Sister and she shall be never the farther from off from you, for I have sold a beast to John Wood in Rhoad Island and I goe there and find whither that beast hath the same eare marke that this mare hath, then if she hath tis mine otherwise not.

1719. Hugh Jackson bought from his "loving brother-in-law," Nicholas Brown, formerly of Monmouth Co. but now of Burlington Co., land in Monmouth Co., then in the occupancy of the said Hugh Jackson. (Salter). [This appears to be an error. Salter reports somewhat differing accounts in sketches of the Brown, the Jackson, and the Potter families. I suspect that Salter miss-represented the deed in his sketch of the Jackson family, which Stillwell subsequently cited. [76] [77] [78] [79] Transcriptions of these two deeds are available. [80] [81]]

1729. Hugh Jackson was the brother-in-law of Nicholas Potter. This relationship was through his having married Mercy, a sister of Nicholas Potter, both being children of Ephraim Potter. The relationship of Hugh Jackson, this same man, to Nicholas Brown of Burlington Co. is not so easy to establish, and I am led to infer that the solution of it lies in a possible marriage of Nicholas Brown's father, Abraham Brown, to the widowed mother of Hugh Jackson. This supposition would change the expression of relationship from "brother-in-law" to stepbrother. This deduction is further sustained by the fact that Abraham Brown, 3, had two wives.
