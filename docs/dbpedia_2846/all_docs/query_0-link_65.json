        "text": "The early English and Scots-Irish settlers tended not to give a new settlement a unique name.\n\nMany New England place names came from towns and shires in England and Ireland. The Puritans even named groups of towns in New England after groups of towns in England: Boston and Lynn, for example, were next to each other in East Anglia as they were in Massachusetts. So were Worcester and Leominster, and Amesbury, Salisbury, Newbury and Andover.\n\nIn Rhode Island, the geography of England was mimicked in Warwick and Coventry and in Bristol and Newport. In New Hampshire, Sandown and South Hampton are next to each other as they were in England. And, as in England, there was once a Gosport on the Isles of Shoals next to Portsmouth in New Hampshire.\n\nUnique Names\n\nThe Scots-Irish did the same. As the earliest pioneers after the Puritans, they named their frontier towns after home. New Hampshire has a Derry, Dublin and Antrim; Massachusetts a Colrain and a Charlemont; Maine a Belfast, a Limerick and a Newry. Both Vermont and New Hampshire have a Londonderry, and Connecticut has a Waterford.\n\nBut sometimes the first settlers simply named a place after its geographic features, like Marshfield, Mass., and Rockport, Maine.\n\nOthers named their towns after heroes, like Washington, Warren, Hancock and Adams. Generally, individuals only had towns named after them after the American Revolution, though one New Hampshire governor was the exception that proved the rule.\n\nThere are at least six New England places that have a unique name found nowhere else.\n\nMianus, Conn.\n\nMianus is a village along the Mianus River that lies in three other districts in Greenwich, Conn: Riverside, Greenwich and Cos Cob.\n\nIt began as a project of the Veterans Administration and the Town of Greenwich to build 40 starter homes for servicemen returning from World War II and their families. During the Baby Boom there were 90 children in Mianus, and they played in the nearby woods and along the river and harbor. A writer named Jack T. Scully grew up there and wrote a book of poems celebrating his elegiac childhood, called Mianus Village.\n\nThe unique name is pronounced ‘maɪˈænəs,’ which made it the butt of jokes on the reality show Jackass.\n\nMianus is also known to antique inboard marine engine enthusiasts because it was home to the Mianus Motor Works, founded in 1889.\n\nThe area was given its unique name by English settlers in the 17th century, who called it Mianus after the chief of the Siwanoy Indian tribe.\n\nKennebunk, Maine\n\nA large sign once proclaimed, “Kennebunk, the only village in the world so named.” The locally famous billboard boasting the town’s unique name was attached to the Kesslen Shoe Mill on Route One.\n\n‘Kennebunk’ was an Abenaki Indian word meaning ‘the long cut bank,’ which refers to the long bank behind Kennebunk Beach. The town’s presence on the Kennebunk and Mousam rivers made it an early center of shipping and shipbuilding. Later, manufacturers built mills on the rivers to make textiles, leatheroid, shoes and luggage.\n\nToday Kennebunk is a bedroom community and a destination for upscale tourists attracted by its beaches and shopping. The town was overshadowed by its neighbor – also with a unique name. Kennebunkport was often in the world’s news when President George H.W. Bush summered there at his family compound.\n\nKennebunk today is home to the Rachel Carson National Wildlife Refuge, historic buildings, the 1799 Inn, Tom’s of Maine and the Brick Store Museum.\n\nDracut, Mass.\n\nPassaconaway, the Pennacook sachem who brokered peace in the Merrimack River Valley, spent most of his life on what is now Dracut, Mass.\n\nIt was known as Augumtoocooke until Passaconaway’s daughter Bess sold the land in 1665 to Captain John Evered, whose family was associated with Draycot Cerne in northern England. (Evered had earlier been in charge of the execution of Mary Dyer.) The land was sold for ‘four yards of Duffill and one pound of tobacco’ and given the unique name of Dracut.\n\nDracut belonged to Chelmsford until 1701, when it formally separated. Part of Dracut was set aside as a Praying Town for Christianized Indians. Dracut’s paper and textile mills attracted French-Canadian and Irish immigrants. Modern real estate development swallowed much of the town. What isn’t a suburb of Lowell is now part of Lowell, which annexed large parts of the town. Dracut has a population of about 30,000 and still retains some rural landscapes and historic buildings.\n\nHenniker, N.H.\n\nHenniker, a bucolic New England town near Concord, prides itself on being ‘the only Henniker on earth.’ It was chartered before the American Revolution and named for British merchant Sir John Henniker, an unusual practice at the time.\n\nChristopher Lenney argued that towns named ‘directly and unequivocally for persons are largely of post-Revolutionary vintage’ in Sightseeking: Clues to the Landscape History of New England. “The custom was un-English and only became widespread in the 19th century, when antipathy to the practice had broken down.”.\n\nNew Hampshire Gov. Benning Wentworth broke with that tradition when he dispensed land grants and charters in Vermont and New Hampshire, naming them after friends in high places to win their support for his westward expansion. Henniker, which received its charter in 1768, had been known as Todd’s Town and New Marlborough until Wentworth decided to name it after his friend.\n\nToday Henniker is home to New England College, Pat’s Peak and the Old Depot No. 6 book barn.\n\nBurrillville, R.I.\n\nBurrillville, R.I., broke off from Glocester in 1806 and named itself after a favorite son, James Burrill, Jr. Burrill had established himself as a leader of Rhode Island by the tender age of 34. He had become Rhode Island’s attorney general at 25 and was elected a U.S. senator in 1817. Shortly before he died on Christmas Day in 1820, he delivered an eloquent speech opposing the Missouri Compromise, which banned free blacks and people of mixed race from settling in Missouri. That clause ‘was entirely repugnant to the Constitution of the United States’ he said, because it created separate classes of citizens.\n\nBurrillville originally comprised 60 square miles but lost land to Massachusetts over a border dispute. Now part of the Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor, Burrillville once had many mills, now gone or shuttered.\n\nSt. Johnsbury, Vt.\n\nSt. Johnsbury was organized in Vermont’s Northeast Kingdom in 1790, a time when the un-English custom of naming towns after individuals began to take hold.\n\nSt. Johnsbury was named for Michel Guillaume St. Jean de Crevecoeur, also known as J. Hector St. John, a French writer living in New York. St. John wrote Letters from an American Farmer in 1782, a book praising American agriculture.\n\nSt. John befriended George Washington and Benjamin Franklin, and he corresponded with Ethan Allen, who wanted to name the town St. John. The writer suggested St. Johnsbury, realizing that several places already had the name St. John.\n\nSt. Johnsbury became a minor manufacturing center where the Fairbanks family made its famous platform scales. By the 1940s, St. Johnsbury was the world’s largest manufacturer of scales, maple sugar and candlepins for bowling.\n\nToday it is a quintessential Victorian industrial town with a large historic district that encompasses the Railroad Street District, Main Street, the St. Johnsbury Athenaeum and the Fairbanks Museum and Planetarium.\n\nPhotos: Dracut Old Yellow Meeting House, By John Phelan – Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=26184431 ;Henniker Congregational Church and Historical Society, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?curid=3380925. This story last updated in 2022.\n\nNew England’s oldest hospitals are all younger than such venerable institutions as schools, banks, businesses and taverns.\n\nReligious orders had run hospitals for centuries to care for the poor, not just the sick. They evolved during the 18th century into places for the practice and teaching of medicine by trained professionals. Nurses, like Louisa May Alcott, for a long time had little or no formal training.\n\nOver time, hospitals became centers of medical innovation and research. They developed specialties and affiliated with medical schools. During the 19th century, lunatic asylums sprang up to take care of mentally ill people outside the family.\n\nAfter the Civil War, the number of hospitals grew rapidly in the United States, to 4,400 by 1910. They got larger, cleaner and more professional.\n\nNew England’s oldest hospitals reflect that evolution. One early hospital gave wine to poor people. One took in the insane. A woman who also wrote hymns started one. And one of the oldest hospitals has a unit named after a woman who gave birth to a president in another of the oldest hospitals.\n\nHere, then, are six of the oldest hospitals in New England, one in each state.\n\nState Hospital, New Haven\n\nThe old State Hospital is Connecticut’s first and boasts many other firsts. It published the first nursing textbook in 1879, produced the first x-ray in the United States in 1896 and used chemotherapy as a cancer treatment for the first time ever in 1942. It also, for the first time in the U.S., allowed healthy newborns to stay in their mothers’ rooms in 1946. Barbara Bush, by the way, gave birth there to future U.S. President George W. Bush that year. In 1975, Lyme disease was identified and named at Yale-New Haven Hospital.\n\nNow called Yale-New Haven Hospital, it was founded in 1826 by the General Hospital Society of Connecticut. It opened in rented quarters, but founders raised enough money by 1833 to build the 13-bed State Hospital designed by Ithiel Town. East and west wings were added.\n\nDuring the Civil War, the U.S. government leased the building for use as a military hospital. Fifteen hundred beds were set up in the building and in tents on the grounds to treat 25,000 U.S. Army soldiers during the war. Yale-New Haven Hospital has been designated a military hospital in every subsequent war.\n\nThe Yale-New Haven Hospital is not only one of the oldest hospitals in the country, it is one of the biggest. Today it has a 1,541-bed hospital, the 168-bed Smilow Cancer Hospital, the 201-bed Yale New Haven Children’s Hospital and the 76-bed Yale New Haven Psychiatric Hospital. It also serves as the teaching hospital for Yale School of Medicine and Yale School of Nursing.\n\nMaine General Hospital\n\nMaine Medical Center in Portland is now the largest hospital in Northern New England. It has 637 beds serving Maine, parts of Vermont and New Hampshire. It was founded as the Maine General Hospital through the efforts of the Maine Medical Society and the state Legislature. Now it serves as a teaching hospital affiliated with four university medical schools.\n\nDoctors founded the Maine Medical Association 20 years earlier to quash the practice of homeopathic and alternative medicines. The group also had concerns about the lack of a general hospital in Maine. The Legislature granted land and funds for the institution, which opened its doors in 1874.\n\nMaine’s doctors had lobbied for the Maine General Hospital. A Maine Medical Association founder, Dr. Gilman Davies, pronounced, ‘the Maine General Hospital is the child of the Maine Medical Association.’\n\nLike the Yale-New Haven Hospital, the Maine Medical Center has a connection to the Bush family: the Barbara Bush Children’s Hospital. Once the teaching hospital for Bowdoin College, it now has affiliations with Dartmouth, St. Joseph’s, Tufts and the University of Southern Maine medical schools.\n\nThe Boston Dispensary\n\nOne of the five oldest hospitals in the country, the Boston Dispensary was founded in 1796, 60 years after the start of Bellevue Hospital in New York and Charity Hospital in New Orleans.\n\nThe Dispensary was New England’s first hospital, and it took care of poor people. It was founded by Boston’s civic leaders, including Paul Revere and Sam Adams. Oliver Wendell Holmes received his medical training there, as did other prominent physicians such as James Jackson and Henry Bowditch.\n\nDoctors took care of patients at the Dispensary in Boston’s South End or in their homes, and gave them medicine and wine, if they felt it necessary. Clinics were established throughout the city, and eventually so was an evening clinic for the working poor, which was partially funded by employers.\n\nSubscribers supported the Dispensary by paying $5 a year for a ticket, which entitled them to recommend two patients to its care. The Massachusetts Historical Society has a ticket signed by Paul Revere.\n\nThe Boston Dispensary over the years affiliated with other medical institutions, including Boston’s Floating Hospital for Children, Tufts University’s medical and dental schools and the Pratt Diagnostic Clinic. In 1968 those affiliations became formal in a merger resulting in Tufts New England Medical Center, now Tufts Medical Center.\n\nPortsmouth Cottage Hospital\n\nPortsmouth Cottage Hospital admitted its first patients in 1884, nearly a century after the Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical School opened its doors in 1797.\n\nHarriet Kimball, the daughter of a Portsmouth pharmacist, provided the drive to start Portsmouth Cottage Hospital. She also published poetry and hymns. Kimball founded the hospital as a charity, with some funding from the City of Portsmouth.\n\nThe hospital opened in the large house in which a famous writer, Thomas Bailey Aldrich, once lived. That house now belongs to the Strawbery Banke Museum complex.\n\nIn 1989, five years after Portsmouth Cottage Hospital opened, fundraising for a proper hospital building began. A 2-1/2 story brick building opened in 1895 and expanded until 1962. That year, the hospital moved to a new building next door.\n\nIn 1983, the for-profit hospital chain Health Corporation of America bought it and opened a new campus. HCA renamed it Portsmouth Regional Hospital. HCA since settled fraud charges with the U.S. government totaling $2 billion, then the largest fraud settlement in history.\n\nConcord Hospital, also founded in 1884, still serves as a charitable hospital. It started with a gift of $60,000 from George Pillsbury, father of Pillsbury Co. co-founder Charles Pillsbury. George named it Mary Pillsbury Hospital as a 50th wedding anniversary gift to his wife. It admitted its first patients in 1891.\n\nButler Hospital, Providence\n\nRhode Island’s first hospital has the unusual distinction of being a psychiatric hospital. Butler Hospital for the Insane was founded in 1844 with a donation from industrialist Cyrus Butler. It also received financial support from Nicholas Brown, Jr.\n\nThe hospital’s first superintendent, Dr. Isaac Ray, toured the asylums of Europe before Butler received its first patients in 1847. Ray reported his findings in Europe in the American Journal of Insanity. People now consider him a founder of forensic psychiatry.\n\nToday, Butler Hospital is affiliated with Brown’s Warren Alpert Medical School. It also serves as the flagship of the university’s acclaimed department of psychiatry.\n\nIf you thought Rhode Island’s first general hospital would be a philanthropic project of the Brown family, you would be right. Rhode Island Hospital started with a bequest from Nicholas Brown, Jr.’s nephew, Moses Brown Ives.\n\nThe hospital was officially dedicated on Oct. 1, 1868.\n\nMary Fletcher Hospital, Burlington, Vt.\n\nThe first hospital in Vermont opened its doors in 1879 in Burlington, thanks to the generosity of Mary Fletcher.\n\nMary was born in Jericho, Vt., to Thadeus and Mary Fletcher in 1830. Thadeus was a successful businessman who left a fortune when he died. Young Mary was the last of the family’s five children, and by 1876 she had outlived her siblings and her parents. Though she suffered from tuberculosis, Mary, who was never married, worked to complete the philanthropic dreams of her parents.\n\nDeploying the family’s wealth she established the Fletcher Free Library and the Mary Fletcher Training School for Nurses. Working with her doctor, Walter Carpenter, she spent more than $200,000 buying land and constructing and equipping the Mary Fletcher Hospital, which she named after her mother. She would die in the hospital, in 1885.\n\nThe hospital has merged with other institutions over the years, but part of the original hospital is still working today as part of the University of Vermont Medical Center.\n\nThis story was updated in 2022.\n\nFamily-owned businesses are becoming a thing of the past as Amazon and Walmart gobble up everything in sight. But the independent business still exists in New England. The oldest business in your state could be a farm that survived real estate development and competition from agribusiness. Or it could be a tavern that made it through more than a dozen wars. Perhaps it’s a ferry that’s been running since Nathaniel Hawthorne took notes.\n\nHere, then, is the oldest business in each New England state.\n\nField View Farm, Connecticut’s Oldest Business\n\nThe Griswold Inn in Essex, Conn., and the Hartford Courant are two of Connecticut’s oldest businesses, having opened in 1776 and 1764, respectively. But neither is as old as Field View Farm, which has been in continuous operation in Orange since 1639.\n\nThomas Hine established the farm in 1639, and his descendants have run the farm for 12 generations. Today it’s a dairy farm that sells eggs, milk and ice cream (and lets you pet the cows). It’s the last remaining farm between New Haven and New York City, and it has stayed alive by diversifying. The farm is also a trucking business, with tractor trucks and trailers that haul goods throughout the Northeast.\n\nA fire burned down the main barn in 1996, and since then the Hine family has sold agricultural equipment and rented vehicles to stay in business.\n\n707 Derby Ave., Orange, Conn.\n\nSeaside Inn\n\nThe town of Kennebunk, Maine, bustles in the summer with tourists seeking lobster, whale watching, shopping and the summer home of President George H.W. Bush. Tourists have stayed in Kennebunk since 1667 at the Seaside Inn, Maine’s oldest business.\n\nInnkeeping dates to 1660 on Kennebunk Beach, when ferrymen stayed on the oceanfront peninsula at the mouth of the Kennebunk River in case travelers needed to be ferried across the river.\n\nJohn Gooch was the first member of the family to settle in Kennebunk. He arrived in 1637 as an agent of Ferdinando Gorges, who ordered Gooch to run the ferry. He began running an inn in 1667. The current inn has been in the Gooch family since 1756, when Jedidiah Gooch bought the business.\n\nIt is the fifth oldest family business in the United States. Maine also boasts the ninth oldest family business, Smiling Hill Farm, in operation in Westbrook since 1720.\n\nFor generations, the business was passed down to the first-born son. Four generations ago, it was passed down to a daughter and today the Seaside Inn and Cottages is run by a ninth-generation member of the family, Trish Mason, and her husband Ken.\n\nTrish Mason has written a book, Seaside House: Maine Innkeepers. You can buy it here.\n\n80 Beach Avenue, Kennebunk, Maine\n\nBarker’s Farm\n\nBarker’s Farm in North Andover, Mass., is still growing corn, strawberries and apples since it started in 1642. It has been in the same family since 1642, and is now run by Dianne Barker, the 11th generation owner.\n\nWhen the first Mr. Barker came to America, another old Massachusetts business was up and running – only in Constantinople. Zildjian didn’t move its cymbal company to Quincy until 1928 (it’s now in Norwell).\n\nToday the Barker farm has 70 acres and a farmstand that sells corn, fruit, butter and vegetables. Customers can pick their own apples and flowers.\n\n1267 Osgood St North Andover, Mass.\n\nTuttle’s Red Barn\n\nJohn Tuttle almost didn’t make it when he left England for the New World in 1632. His ship sank. But his wife and four-year-old daughter survived and found their way to what is now New Hampshire.\n\nNow New Hampshire’s oldest business, The Tuttle Farm has been operating without pause in Dover, since 1632. It’s almost as old as the Shirley Plantation in Charles City, Va., which has been around since 1613.\n\nThe farm expanded to 240 acres in the 20th century, but now is down to 134. It’s been passed down through 11 generations of Tuttles. In the 1870s, Joseph Edward Tuttle died when his only son was still a baby. His brother ran the farm for 40 years until he died, when the farm went to the grown-up George Tuttle.\n\nThe Tuttle Farm today includes a 12-room house built around 1780, greenhouses, barns and a farmstand, which sells produce, groceries, plants and gift items. Its biggest crop is corn, followed by vegetables and berries.\n\nWill and Lucy Tuttle sold the farm in 2013 for about $1 million to Matt Kozazcki, who also owns a farm in Newbury, Mass. It is now doing business as Tendercrop Farm.\n\n123 Dover Point Rd., Dover, N.H.\n\nWhite Horse Tavern\n\nNewport, R.I., is home to three very old American businesses: John Stevens Stonecutter, Caswell-Massey and the White Horse Tavern.\n\nThe White Horse Tavern, Rhode Island’s oldest business, was built by Frances Brinley in 1652. It didn’t sell food and drink until 1683 when William Mayes bought the property and enlarged it into a tavern. And it wasn’t named White Horse until 1730.\n\nThe tavern was a hangout for Tories in the early days of the Revolution and housed British soldiers leading up to the Battle of Rhode Island. Among its more colorful owners was William Mayes Jr., a Rhode Island pirate.\n\nToday you can not only visit the White Horse, you can still get a meal and a drink there. For more information, visit the Tavern’s website here.\n\nJohn Stevens Stonecutter has been cutting stone since 1705, and Caswell-Massey has made soaps and scents since 1752. Kenyon’s Grist Mill has been grinding meal and flour in West Kingstown since 1696.\n\n26 Marlborough St., Newport, R.I.\n\nFort Ticonderoga Ferry\n\nThe trip between Larrabee’s Point in Shoreham, Vt., and Ticonderoga, N.Y., takes seven-and-a-half minutes, just as it has for more than 100 years.\n\nThe Fort Ticonderoga Ferry makes its way across Lake Champlain guided by a set of cables that rest on the lake’s bottom.\n\nThere has been a ferry running from Ticonderoga to ports on the Connecticut River since at least the 1759 when Lord Jeffery Amherst, governor general of British North America, ordered the establishment of ferry service to assist in moving armies and supplies in the Seven Years’ War.\n\nSince 1799, there has been a ferry service between New York and Larrabee’s Point, making it Vermont’s oldest business. In the early days it was essential to trade.\n\nOperating from late spring through early fall, the ferry is less important as a vehicle for trade today than it used to be. But it still delights travelers as it did more than 100 years ago when Nathaniel Hawthorne noted its peculiar charms. He wrote of: “the continual succession of travelers who spent an idle quarter of an hour in waiting for the ferry boat, affording me just enough time to make their acquaintance, penetrate their mysteries and be rid of them without the risk of tediousness on either side.”\n\nImages: White Horse Tavern By Kenneth C. Zirkel – Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=58527439.\n\nIn February 1788, George Washington was staying close to home at Mount Vernon, anxiously awaiting news from New Hampshire. The state’s constitutional convention was to be held on February 13, and two of his friends were running it: John Langdon and his former general John Sullivan.\n\nWashington had been relieved to hear that on Feb. 3, 1788, Massachusetts became the sixth state to ratify the Constitution. From Boston, Henry Knox wrote to Washington to say New Hampshire would surely follow its neighbor. Knox thought of New Hampshire as a stronghold for Federalists, who supported the document.\n\nIt had to happen, Washington thought. The current government created under the Articles of Confederation was in chaos. The new country had huge war debts and no way to pay them. And often, enough congressmen didn’t show up to make a quorum, so they couldn’t conduct daily business.\n\nMeanwhile, two of the biggest and most powerful states, New York and Virginia, quarreled bitterly over the Constitution. Rhode Island had no intention of ratifying it. Washington realized if New Hampshire didn’t ratify the Constitution, the country probably wouldn’t have one.\n\nThen the devastating news arrived: New Hampshire’s constitutional convention adjourned after nine days on February 22 — without ratification.\n\nJohn Langdon\n\nJohn Langdon, politician and Portsmouth merchant, had gotten very rich in international trade. An early revolutionary, he built a grand Georgian mansion that Washington later visited.\n\nDespite their friendship, John Langdon helped Ona Judge Staines evade Washington’s nephew when he came to New Hampshire. The nephew wanted to bring her back as Martha Washington’s slave.\n\nLike the other Portsmouth shipping merchants, John Langdon ardently supported the Constitution. He thought a stronger national government would protect and expand American commerce.\n\nBut Langdon understood something outsiders didn’t. Most New Hampshire people lived inland from New Hampshire’s 18-mile coastline. They didn’t expect to benefit from maritime commerce, nor did they like coastal merchants. They opposed the Federalists, because they feared a central government would concentrate power and destroy democracy.\n\nThe Massachusetts Constitutional Convention\n\nDelegates to the Constitutional Convention finished in Philadelphia in September 1787. Nine of 13 states had to approve the document for it to take effect. By the time Massachusetts got around to its Constitutional Convention on Jan. 9, 1788, Delaware, New Jersey, Georgia, Connecticut and Pennsylvania (though only barely) had ratified.\n\nThe Massachusetts delegates argued for days inside the Old State House in Boston. Washington kept tabs on developments. “We are locked in ice,” he wrote John Jay on Jan. 20, 1788.\n\nGov. John Hancock had stayed away with gout, but when he finally arrived at the Constitutional Convention he had a proposal. Hancock suggested Massachusetts recommend a bill of rights. When Sam Adams supported Hancock, Massachusetts ratified the Constitution on Feb. 3, 1788.\n\nNew Hampshire’s Constitutional Convention would follow in just 10 days.\n\nJohn Sullivan\n\nNew Hampshire Gov. John Sullivan was a canny politician who knew the western part of the state wouldn’t vote to ratify the Constitution.\n\nHe was the son of an Irish schoolmaster and his wife who immigrated to America. Born in Somersworth, N.H., he practiced law in Durham, N.H., and formed a friendship with Gov. John Wentworth.\n\nBut then Sullivan turned away from Wentworth in the run-up to the Revolution. Along with John Langdon, he became a delegate to the Continental Congress. When war broke out, Sullivan received a commission as a brigadier general.\n\nFor five years after the war ended, either John Langdon or John Sullivan served as governor of New Hampshire.\n\nSullivan supported ratification, and he tried political trickery to get it. He called a meeting of the state Legislature in January 1788, when winter roads made it hard for westerners and northerners to travel to Exeter. The largely Federalist Legislature agreed to hold the Constitutional Convention in February, when snow and ice still blocked the roads.\n\nBut Sullivan’s maneuvering didn’t work. Nor did a pro-ratification propaganda campaign that included ministers preaching supportive sermons. While Washington watched from Mount Vernon, strong opposition broke up New Hampshire’s Constitutional Convention after nine days.\n\nThe surprising development did huge damage to the cause. New York’s governor, George Clinton came out as an ardent opponent of the Constitution. Opposition also gained steam in Pennsylvania and Virginia.\n\nBut then Maryland ratified the Constitution in April, South Carolina in May. So Langdon and Sullivan decided to try again in June.\n\nVote Counting\n\nSullivan and Langdon had counted votes carefully. They persuaded four Federalists to stay away from the Constitutional Convention because their towns bound them to oppose ratification.\n\nNinety of the 113 delegates showed up on the first day, June 18, 1788, at Concord’s Old North Meeting House. By the second day, 107 delegates were present. Pierce Long, a Portsmouth delegate, described ‘dry arguments gone over again’ that left both sides tired out.\n\nWhen Maj. Joseph Kimball of Plainfield, a supporter, arrived on the third day, Langdon and Sullivan decided to go for it. They knew four of the five still-absent delegates opposed ratification, and they might show up at any moment.\n\nSince proposed amendments had won the day in Massachusetts, John Langdon headed a committee to propose New Hampshire’s own amendments. They were the same as those in Massachusetts, but New Hampshire added three: there was to be no quartering soldiers in private houses; no laws touching religion; no disarming of citizens unless they’d been in actual rebellion.\n\nThen Joshua Atherton, a former Loyalist from Amherst, made a motion. He wanted the Constitution to take effect only with the amendments. He strongly opposed the Constitution because it endorsed slavery.\n\nSamuel Livermore, a Federalist from Holderness, moved that the amendments not be a condition of ratification. He won.\n\nThen Atherton sent fear into the hearts of the Federalists. He moved to adjourn.\n\nAtherton lost. The vote would take place the next day.\n\nOn June 21, 1788, the clerk took the yeas and nays. Ratification of the Constitution passed by the surprising margin of 57-47. The amendments had done it.\n\nThe Constitution was now the law of the land. New Hampshire had put it over the top and, in the process, become the ninth state in the republic.\n\nAftermath\n\nVirginia and New York had yet to ratify the Constitution, however. Could the Republic stand without those two large important states as part of it? Four days later, Virginia ratified the Constitution. New York would follow in a month.\n\nNews traveled slowly in those days. Virginia was already celebrating its own ratification with cannon fire, banquets and toasts. Then an express rider arrived at Mount Vernon before dawn with the surprising news that New Hampshire had ratified the Constitution.\n\nGeorge Washington attended a stag dinner at John Wise’s Fountain Tavern to celebrate. He was greeted outside the tavern with the fire of 10 cannon and 10 toasts, to celebrate the 10 new states.\n\nHe rejoiced at the decision ‘by the People of this great Country to preserve the Union–establish good order & government — and render the Nation happy at home & respected abroad.’\n\nThis story about New Hampshire’s constitutional convention was updated in 2023.\n\nCovered bridges have been around since the late 18th century in the United States.\n\nUncovered bridges had short lifespans of about 15 to 20 years. So people started to cover them to protect the timbers underneath from the wind, rain, and snow.\n\nToday covered bridges are more about rural charm than practicality.\n\nPennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana each has more covered bridges than any New England state, according to the National Society for the Preservation of Covered Bridges.. Pennsylvania, with 219, has the most. But Vermont can claim the densest concentration of the old timbered structures, with 106.\n\nNew Hampshire once had close to 400 covered bridges, but that number has dwindled to 54. Rhode Island is the only New England state with fewer than eight covered bridges, with but one.\n\nHere, then, are six covered bridges, one in each state. If you know of a covered bridge worth mentioning, please include it in the comments section.\n\nWest Cornwall Covered Bridge\n\nThere are about 90 covered bridges in Connecticut, where Ithiel Town invented the lattice truss in 1820. His design used latticework to carry a bridge’s load and allowed unskilled workers to build covered bridges quickly with local materials. Town, by the way, also designed the Wadsworth Athenaeum in Hartford and Trinity Church on the Green in New Haven.\n\nIn 1864, the current incarnation of the West Cornwall Covered Bridge was built of red spruce and held together with wooden pegs. It’s one of the oldest covered bridges in the country. The key to its longevity was Town’s lattice truss design – and some heavy metal later in its life.\n\nAs more and more automobiles and trucks crossed the bridge, the West Cornwall Covered Bridge was closed to pedestrian traffic in the 1920s. In 1945, an oil truck weighing 20 tons fell through the bottom of the bridge. The State of Connecticut decided to replace the bridge in 1968, but a local group persuaded the state to save the bridge. Connecticut built a steel support deck that saved the bridge and won a Federal Highway Administration award.\n\nIt wasn’t painted red until 1957, which gave it iconic status. The bridge is featured in the opening scenes of the 1967 film Valley of the Dolls.\n\nThe bridge carries the Sharon-Goshen Turnpike (now Rte 128) over the Housatonic River in West Cornwall.\n\nSunday River Bridge or Artist’s Bridge\n\nMaine once had 120 covered bridges, but fire, flood, development and the great freshet of 1896 reduced their number to eight.\n\nArtist’s Bridge dates to 1872, deep in Maine’s back country on Sunday River Road in Newry. Some say the name of the bridge reflects its position as Maine’s most photographed and painted covered bridge. Other suggest plein air master painter John Enneking gave the bridge its name because he painted it so often. Locals then started calling it Artist’s Bridge.\n\nSince then, artists may have put more paint on their canvases to illustrate the bridge than peoole ever put on its sides.\n\nThe Artist’s Bridge is northeast of the Sunday River Ski Resort, next to the crossing of the Sunday River by Sunday River Road.\n\nBurkeville Covered Bridge\n\nTimothy Palmer built Massachusetts’ first covered bridge in Amesbury in 1792, though it didn’t get its roof until 1810. Timber covered bridges were revived in the second half of the 20th century, and a handful of ‘Massachusetts Modern’ covered bridges replaced historic wooden bridges that couldn’t be saved.\n\nThe Burkeville Covered Bridge in Conway is one of the oldest surviving covered bridges in the United States, having been built in 1870. It’s 107 feet long and considered a fine example of state-of-the-art wooden bridge building of the era.\n\nA flood washed away the previous bridge. The roof caved in under a heavy load of snow in 1975, but volunteers restored it. In 1985, the Burkeville Covered Bridge was closed for safety reasons, but renovated and opened to vehicles in 2013. It is located on Main Poland Road just off of Route 116 in Conway.\n\nThe bridge is beloved in Conway, where it has been the site of fundraising dinners, memorial services and weddings (not to mention wedding photos).\n\nHoneymoon Bridge\n\nThink a bridge can’t be romantic? Think again. The Honeymoon Bridge in Jackson, N.H., got its name because so many couples share a kiss in front of it — and take photographs of themselves doing so.\n\nThe bridge dates to 1876 when Union Army Sgt. Charles Austin Broughton and his son Frank built it to access their dairy farm on Route 16A. Broughton was land agent for the Swift River Lumber Company in Albany, New Hampshire, an avid bear hunter, an accomplished fiddler, and a carpenter. Today the bridge ranks as one of the most photographed — and photogenic — covered bridges in New England.\n\nThe Honeymoon Bridge carries Village Street over the Ellis River in Jackson.\n\n(Thanks to New Hampshire Covered Bridges by Richard Marshall.)\n\nSwamp Meadow Covered Bridge\n\nRhode Island has but one covered bridge on a public road: The Swamp Meadow Covered Bridge in Foster, R.I.\n\nFoster proposed building a covered bridge in honor of Rhode Island’s 350th anniversary in 1986. Volunteers began building the bridge in September 1992, using an Ithiel Town lattice truss on top of an existing steel bridge. The bridge was dedicated in May 1993, but vandals burned it four months later. The Foster Town Council immediately voted to rebuild it, and it was dedicated on Nov. 5, 1994.\n\nThe Swamp Meadow Covered Bridge, in the rural northwest corner of the state, crosses Hemlock Brook on Central Pike.\n\nMount Orne Bridge\n\nDating to at least the 1870s, the Mount Orne Bridge was built in the days when people could make money charging tolls to cross covered bridges.\n\nThe Union Bridge Company operated the span as a link between River Road in Lunenberg, Vt., and Elm Street in Lancaster N.H., until a log jam wiped it out in 1908. Thereafter the two towns rebuilt it.\n\nThe Mount Orne Bridge enjoyed a small spot of notoriety in 1969 when a fully loaded salt truck tried to test its limits and plunged through the bridge deck. The truck was a sight, with its rear-end caught on the bridge and its nose resting on the frozen river below. Fast-acting rescuers dislodged it and scooted it off to the shore before the salt that spilled from the truck could melt through the ice and plunge it into the river.\n\nThe Mount Orne Bridge joins Elm Street (N.H. Rte. 135 in South Lancaster) with River Road (Town Highway 1) in Lunenberg.\n\nImages: West Cornwall Covered Bridge, The George F. Landegger Collection of Connecticut Photographs in the Carol M.

Thomas Gage said the death of Joseph Warren was ‘worth the death of 500 men.’\n\nCounties in 14 states bear the name of Joseph Warren, as do four towns in New England (New Hampshire and Rhode Island each have a Warren named after Sir Peter). Five ships were named after him, four statues bearing his likeness are on display and a street in Detroit is named ‘Warren Avenue.’\n\nSo what was so special about Joseph Warren?\n\nJoseph Warren\n\nUnlike John Hancock, Joseph Warren didn’t have a wealthy uncle who took him under his wing when his father died. But Joseph Warren was ambitious, both for wealth and for glory.\n\nHe had taken to heart the words of his father: “I would rather a son of mine were dead than a coward.”\n\nJoseph Warren was just 14 and about to enter Harvard in 1755 when his father was killed falling off a ladder while picking apples. His mother, Mary Stevens Warren, mortgaged the farm to send him to Harvard, though she probably could have used more of his help to run it.\n\nAfter graduating from Harvard, he married a 17-year-old heiress, Elizabeth Hooten, in 1764. She died eight years later, leaving him with two young sons and two young daughters.\n\nJoseph Warren became the youngest doctor in Boston and one of the best, with a stellar list of clients including Sam Adams, John Hancock, John Adams and his family. He saved 7-year-old John Quincy Adams’ finger from amputation.\n\nWarren also had Loyalist patients: the children of Thomas Hutchinson, British Gen. Thomas Gage and his wife Margaret. After his wife died, Joseph Warren is believed by some to have had an affair with Margaret Gage. She may have tipped him off about the British plans to raid Concord and arrest Hancock and Adams.\n\nIt was Joseph Warren who enlisted Paul Revere and William Dawes to spread the alarm on April 19, 1775.\n\nMost Influential Patriot\n\nOf Joseph Warren, military historian Ethan Rafuse wrote, “No man, with the possible exception of Samuel Adams, did so much to bring about the rise of a movement powerful enough to lead the people of Massachusetts to revolution.”\n\nJoseph Warren was gregarious, charming and a powerful speaker who enlisted in the patriot cause. He became Grand Master of the Masonic Lodge of St. Andrew when Paul Revere was the secretary. He was also a member of the Sons of Liberty, and he tried to save Christopher Seider, the young boy killed in 1770 by British soldiers.\n\nTo commemorate the second anniversary of the Boston Massacre, he delivered a speech at the Old South Meeting House while wearing a toga.\n\nIn the fall of 1774, Joseph Warren wrote the Suffolk Resolves, which supported a boycott of British goods and urged armed resistance to the British.\n\nBy the first months of 1775 he was the most influential patriot leader in Massachusetts. Hancock and the Adamses were in Philadelphia attending the Second Continental Congress, and Warren, just 33, was the president of the Provincial Congress – Massachusetts’ shadow government.\n\nBunker Hill\n\nJoseph Warren belonged to the Committee of Safety. He had made sure powder and arms were stored in towns throughout Massachusetts. He also tried to organize Massachusetts’ fighting forces into an ‘army of observation,’ and he propagandized so they’d be willing to fight.\n\nOn the day of the Battles of Lexington and Concord, he sneaked out of Boston and led militia in harassing the British returning to the city. He then returned to Boston, where he organized soldiers for the siege of Boston and negotiated with Gage.\n\nJoseph Warren Dies in the Battle of Bunker Hill\n\nOn June 13, colonial leaders learned the British planned to send troops to take the unoccupied hills surrounding the besieged city. That night, 1,200 colonial troops stealthily occupied Bunker Hill and Breed’s Hill and built an earthworks.\n\nWarren had been commissioned a major general in the Massachusetts militia. However, he insisted on fighting as a private in the thick of the battle. He asked Gen. Israel Putnam where the heaviest fighting would be.\n\nDuring the battle he fought behind the earthworks until the patriots exhausted their ammunition. He stayed there to give the militia time to escape while the British made their final assault. A British officer then recognized him and shot him in the head. He died instantly, six days after his 34th birthday.\n\nThe British stripped his body and stabbed it beyond recognition, then threw him into a shallow grave with another patriot killed in the battle. Paul Revere later identified his body.\n\nThe day after the battle, Abigail Adams wrote to her husband:\n\nI have just heard that our dear Friend Dr. Warren is no more but fell gloriously fighting for his Country-saying better to die honourably in the field than ignominiously hang upon the Gallows. Great is our Loss. He has distinguished himself in every engagement, by his courage and fortitude, by animating the Soldiers & leading them on by his own example.\n\nMore on that Battle\n\nInterested in the Battle of Bunker Hill? You might want to read what it was like for Abigail Adams and her young son to watch it from 10 miles away.\n\nMany others watched the battle from hills and rooftops, including this 10-year-old Loyalist who told her granddaughter what it was like.\n\nOr you might want to read about the printer’s apprentice who spent 107 days in a British prison for cheering the patriot side while watching the battle.\n\nThe most detailed account of the battle came from someone who fought in it: a private named Peter Brown who enlisted after he heard the news of Lexington and Concord. The British, he wrote, got a ‘choaky mouthful.’\n\nThe news about the Battle of Bunker Hill threw the surrounding towns into a panic. Read the first-person account of a Salem doctor who thought the British had reached the next town.\n\nHere is a more detailed description of the death of Joseph Warren.\n\nPaul Revere was a man of many talents. He became the first odontologist when he identified the Warren’s body nine months after the battle ended.\n\nThis story was updated in 2023."
