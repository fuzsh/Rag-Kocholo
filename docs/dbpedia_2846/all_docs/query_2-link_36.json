        "text": "With the addition of Brown, the Bengals' offensive line room has more jewelry than Joe Burrow and Ja'Marr Chase combined.\n\nWe all know Burrow and Chase have plenty of ICE, but the Bengals' big men have four Super Bowl rings.\n\nAlex Cappa (1), Ted Karras (2) and Brown (1). All three guys have played on the biggest of stages and know what it takes to win a Lombardi Trophy.\n\n\"We're really excited to get him in here and have him play left tackle for us and win those championships that we've been pursuing these last couple of years,\" Bengals head coach Zac Taylor said with a gigantic smile. \"That's what he's all about. He's experienced that before. He's played at a high level for a long time.\"\n\nThe Bengals' offensive line is hoping to add another ring or two to their collection over the next few years.\n\nSigning Scott to a 3-year, $12 million contract is the perfect signing for the Bengals for a few reasons.\n\nFirst and foremost, it gives Lou Anarumo a veteran to lean on in the back end of his defense.\n\nHe visited the team on Thursday. They hosted Taylor Rapp on Friday, his former teammate with the Rams, before signing Scott\n\nThe veteran has appeared in every game for Los Angeles over the past two seasons and made 16 starts in 2022. He's a versatile chess piece that should be a perfect compliment to Dax Hill.\n\nLike Brown, Scott has a Super Bowl ring of his own and should fit right in from a culture standpoint.\n\nLosing Vonn Bell hurt, but the Bengals kept Germaine Pratt and brought in a younger, less expensive option. And just because he's cheaper, doesn't mean he isn't better in some areas. A safety duo of Hill and Scott is more athletic than what they had last season with Jessie Bates and Bell.\n\nThe Bengals will likely add a veteran tight end in the near future after losing Hayden Hurst in free agency.\n\nFoster Moreau could make the most sense of the free agents available. He visited the Bengals on Friday.\n\nThe former fourth-round pick spent the past four seasons with the Raiders being Darren Waller's backup.\n\nAt just 25-years-old, he's a young, athletic player, who's best days are likely coming in the near future.\n\nMoreau posted a career-high 33 receptions for 420 receiving yards career-high) and two touchdowns last season.\n\nHe also played with Joe Burrow and Ja'Marr Chase in 2018 at LSU. He's a more than capable blocker and is dynamic after the catch. Signing Moreau to a multi-year contract would make sense for Cincinnati."
