        "text": "SAN ANTONIO – A University of Texas at San Antonio football player has been suspended after he was arrested and charged with alleged aggravated robbery.\n\nNicholas Ryan Brown, listed on the UTSA football roster as Nick Booker-Brown, was taken into custody Thursday night, Bexar County jail records indicated.\n\nBrown, 23, was booked into the Bexar County Adult Detention Center Friday on two aggravated robbery charges stemming from a Feb. 3 incident. Both charges are considered first-degree felonies.\n\nRecords said each aggravated robbery charge carried a bond of $75,000, totaling a bond of $150,000.\n\nBrown has since bonded out of the Bexar County Adult Detention Center, records showed.\n\nSan Antonio police told KSAT Saturday that Brown’s Thursday night arrest was due to an incident unrelated to the aggravated robbery charges.\n\nAs a tow truck towed away an illegally parked vehicle at an apartment complex in the 12000 block of Engelmann Drive, police said Brown went outside to stop the tow truck driver from taking the vehicle.\n\nWhile Brown tried to track down the tow truck, the truck made contact with one of Brown’s feet, SAPD said. Brown suffered non-life-threatening injuries, but he was taken to a nearby hospital for further treatment.\n\nAuthorities said the tow truck driver returned to the scene to cooperate with SAPD’s investigation. Brown was later discharged from the hospital with minor injuries.\n\nOver the course of SAPD’s investigation, the department said it found information regarding Brown’s two alleged aggravated robbery warrants out of Bexar County.\n\nAs a result of his arrest, a UTSA athletics spokesperson said Brown has been “indefinitely suspended” from the team while the athletic department gathers more information.\n\nBrown, a graduate of Westfield High School in Houston, transferred to UTSA from North Carolina State in 2022. During that season, Brown, a defensive end, was named as an all-Conference USA honorable mention player.\n\nBrown appeared in all 13 games for the Roadrunners during the 2023 season, recording 6.5 tackles for a loss. Brown also had a sack in UTSA’s bowl win over Marshall, the program’s first-ever bowl victory."
