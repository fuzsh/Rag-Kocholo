        "text": "The Old School is the New School Again. That's my message of the month for Fogelman students. Memphis employers are telling me they want graduates who know how to communicate, know how to work in teams, know how to learn, and are excited to join an organization in a face-to-face work environment. So get ready to be in the office, write and speak clearly, handwrite your thank you notes, and share your business cards. About 14 years ago I was teaching online courses at Oregon State, and online teaching back then made me kind of unique. No more; every professor now knows how to teach online. Similarly, our grads can no longer differentiate themselves with remote-work skills. The vast majority of our workforce knows how to work remotely, so although we will not neglect this important aspect of modern work, this skill is no longer unique. If you want to be differentiated today, tell your interviewer that you know how to be a great team player, and that you are excited to be engaged face-to-face in their organization. That's what Fogelman students are hearing, and I can see them preparing themselves everyday to be career-ready. Hire our grads!\n\n📣 WE'RE HIRING! 📣 Are you passionate about students participating in shaping the world around them? Do you understand how to create democratic processes which encourage them to do so? Do you feel strongly about the power of nurturing student leaders? Yes? You could be our next Democracy and Advocacy Coordinator! That's quite a long job title isn't it? Let us explain what that actually means. In this role, you'll be doing everything student democracy, helping students to make the changes they want to see at University. What this looks like is... 👍 Overseeing our student elections 👍 Facilitating student council, supporting students with change making and being an expert in university governance 👍 Supporting our elected Sabbatical Officers to achieve their manifesto priorities But enough about what we want from you. Let’s talk about what we offer in return. We are a people first employer, and believe in flexibility, staff development and wellbeing. And we're not just talk. If you work for us, you will receive… 👉 A very generous annual leave allowance: 28 days (excluding Bank Holidays), plus winter and spring closure periods of at least three weeks per annum, and of course, your birthday off! 👉 Religious holiday leave and/or Charity Days in addition to annual leave 👉 Trialing reduced summer hours (30 instead of 35 per week) on full pay through June, July and August 👉 Hybrid working - when you need to be in the office, you're here! When you need to be at home, you're at home! No arbitrary 4 days in, 1 day at home. 👉 Flexible working, so you can you make your hours work for you. Need to work 7am-3pm so you can pick up your child from school? That's fine with us! 👉 Free access to campus gym We also have a significant learning and development budget and, in addition, you’ll have access to internal training courses. Westminster's student body is one of the most diverse in London, and we strongly believe our staff team should reflect that! We therefore highly encourage individuals from an ethnic minority background to apply for this post, as we continue to reflect our diverse student body. Do we require a University degree to work with us? No. What about a background in Students’ Unions or Higher Education? Also no. We welcome staff from all professional backgrounds and appreciate diversity of thought – it’s your experience and ability to work with people that matters here. 👏 If you are worried at all about whether you're the right fit for us - reach out for a chat! We value who you are more than what you might have on paper, so if you're feeling that imposter syndrome, please do get in contact.
