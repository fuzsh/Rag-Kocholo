        "text": "Grief-stricken Bobby Brown was seen Thursday afternoon for the first time since the tragic death of his 28-year-old son.\n\nThe music legend looked somber as he spoke with police detectives at the front gate of the apartment complex where Bobby Jr died on Wednesday.\n\nBrown has been left devastated at the sudden death of his son who was pronounced dead at his Encino, California apartment on Wednesday at 2pm.\n\nIt's not yet clear how he died but police say no foul play is suspected.\n\nAt around 1.30pm Thursday detectives with the Los Angeles Police Department were seen poring over CCTV footage captured at the apartment complex.\n\nFour suited officers, displaying badges on their belts, were seen at the security lodge at the main gate of the complex.\n\nThe officers, all wearing face masks and some carrying clip boards, arrived in a gray, unmarked Crown Victoria police car before talking with a security guard.\n\nOne of the officers was seen looking at a screen in the lodge carefully reviewing security footage.\n\nIt's unclear exactly what the detectives were looking for, but it is likely part of the ongoing investigation into Bobby Jr's death.\n\nAround an hour later detectives accompanied Brown from his home in the complex and took him to the security lodge.\n\nBrown was seen examining CCTV footage alongside the officers before returning to his home a few minutes later.\n\nThe star, who was with a female companion, was wearing glasses and a white back to front baseball cap and had green sweat pants and a beige sweatshirt on.\n\nBrown sported a graying goatee beard, wore a gold necklace around his neck and puffed on a cigarette as he spoke with police.\n\nHis eyes appeared puffy after 24 hours wracked with grief for his son.\n\nIn a statement given to DailyMail.com Bobby Brown said the family is ‘devastated’ over his son’s death.\n\n‘Please keep my family in your prayers at this time. Losing my son at this point in our lives has devastated my family.\n\n'There are no words to explain the pain,’ said Brown. ‘We ask that you respect the family’s privacy at this time and there will be no further comment.’\n\nThis comes as it emerged Brown Jr was not feeling well a couple days before his death and was suffering from flu-like symptoms, according to a family spokesperson.\n\n‘This is a tragic loss and we will be let the authorities conduct their investigation of his death,’ said Christopher Brown, Esq. of Brown & Rosen LLC, counsel to Bobby Brown. Ends Ryan\n\nOn Thursday night Bobby Brown Jr’s death was plunged further into mystery.\n\nA spokesperson for LA County Dept. of Medical Examiner-Coroner said the cause of his death had been deferred.\n\nThat means that after an autopsy, a cause of death has not been determined and the medical examiner is requesting more investigation into the death, including additional studies.\n\nA spokesperson told DailyMail.com: ‘Once the tests/studies come back, the doctor evaluates the case again and makes the cause of death determination.’\n\nAspiring musician Bobby, was one of Brown's seven children and is the second child the R&B singer Brown has lost after the death of his daughter - with ex-wife Whitney Houston - Bobbi Kristina, who was found unconscious in a bathtub in 2015 at the age of 22.\n\nBobby Kristina's 'adopted brother', Nick Gordon, with whom she had a controversial relationship before her death, also died in January this year.\n\nThree years before her daughter's death, Houston drowned in a bathtub after taking cocaine and Xanax.\n\nShe and Brown had a tempestuous 15-year marriage that was plagued by drug abuse, violence and infidelity.\n\nBobby Jr. was Brown's second child with Kim Ward, with whom he had an 11-year relationship around the same time he was with Houston.\n\nWard gave birth to Bobby Jr. less than a year before Brown and Houston had their daughter, Bobbi Kristina, in 1993 - their only child together."
