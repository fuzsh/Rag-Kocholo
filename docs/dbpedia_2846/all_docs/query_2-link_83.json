        "text": "Wearing brand-new gray alternate uniforms under the lights, Ohio State gave its home crowd plenty to cheer about as the Buckeyes rolled to a 38-3 victory over Michigan State to improve to 10-0 on the season.\n\nQ1 Q2 Q3 Q4 #1 Ohio State 14 21 3 0 38 MICHIGAN STATE 0 3 0 0 3\n\nAs he often is, Marvin Harrison Jr. was the star of the night for Ohio State, scoring touchdowns on all of the Buckeyes’ first three possessions to propel the home team to a 21-0 lead two seconds into the second quarter. Ohio State entered halftime with a 35-3 lead before an uneventful second half in which its backups saw extended playing time on both sides of the ball.\n\nHarrison started the scoring with the first rushing touchdown of his OSU career on a play from the 19-yard line.\n\nMichigan State attempted a 56-yard field goal on its opening drive, which Jonathan Kim missed to give the ball back to the Buckeyes at their own 39-yard line. The Buckeyes took advantage of the short field with a four-play, 61-yard drive capped by a 26-yard touchdown pass from Kyle McCord to Harrison.\n\nHarrison’s third touchdown came on a 9-yard catch on the first play of the second quarter.\n\nThe Spartans scored their only points of the night on their fourth possession of the game with a 53-yard field goal by Kim.\n\nTreVeyon Henderson became the first Buckeye other than Harrison to score a touchdown on the night when he ran for a 9-yard score on Ohio State’s fifth possession.\n\nOhio State tacked on a fifth touchdown with 15 seconds to play before halftime when McCord threaded the ball between two defenders to Cade Stover, who made an excellent adjustment to the ball for an 18-yard catch in the end zone.\n\nOHIO STATE METRIC MICHIGAN STATE 530 TOTAL YARDS 182 177 RUSHING YARDS 94 32 RUSHING ATTEMPTS 29 5.5 AVERAGE per RUSH 3.2 2 RUSHING TOUCHDOWNS 0 353 PASSING YARDS 88 26-34 COMPLETIONS–ATTEMPTS 13-25 13.6 AVERAGE per COMPLETION 6.8 3 PASSING TOUCHDOWNS 0 25 1st DOWNS 11 66 TOTAL PLAYS 54 8.0 YARDS PER PLAY 3.4 5-11 third down conv 2-14 3-25 PENALTIES 5-36 31:12 POSSESSION 28:48\n\nHarrison built upon his spectacular first half with a 57-yard reception on Ohio State’s first offensive play of the second half.\n\nThat led to a 36-yard Jayden Fielding field goal on what would be the final drive of the game for several Ohio State starters including Harrison, Henderson, Stover and Emeka Egbuka.\n\nA missed 41-yard field goal attempt by Fielding was the closest either team came to scoring in the fourth quarter.\n\nWith just two regular-season games to go, Ohio State will look to improve to 11-0 in its final home game of the season when it hosts Minnesota at Ohio Stadium next Saturday.\n\nKickoff is set for 4 p.m. with Big Ten Network televising."
