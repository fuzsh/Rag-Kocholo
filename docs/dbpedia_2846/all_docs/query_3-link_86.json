        "text": "My name is Nicholas Brown (I also go by Nico) and I am looking for an opportunity to obtain a top education at a college or university that will also allow me to play soccer at the highest level. My goal is to develop into a professional soccer prospect and graduate with a degree. I am currently about 6’1” and weigh 179 lbs and I am a goalkeeper in the Soccer Institute at Montverde Academy (SIMA) (https://www.mvasima.com/ ) in the class of 2025. I played for the top team, SIMA Gold (U19), this past winter/spring. Here is a link to my YouTube channel with some of my highlights from this year (https://www.youtube.com/@NicholasBrown25), also my Instagram is (@nicothegk).\n\nThe SIMA program allows us to practice every weekday morning at 7:45 am and then take classes starting at 10:15 am for the rest of the day. SIMA does not play in a league, but we set up friendlies against USL teams, college teams, and other soccer academies. Two of the highlights for me this year were the friendly matches against the pro teams at USL-2 Nona FC and USL’s Tampa Bay Rowdies (https://www.rowdiessoccer.com/news/2023/02/22/rowdies-draw-with-sima-in-preseason-test/ ). The Director of SIMA is Kevin Varnado ([email protected] & 407-469-2561 X 7015).\n\nIn terms of my academics, my school just stopped class rankings, but at the last class ranking, I was in the top 10 GPAs of my class with a weighted GPA of 4.28 because I take a course load with AP and Honors classes. Also, my PSAT score this year was in the 90th percentile and I plan to take the SAT for the first time in June. I am undecided on my major, but two subjects that I find that are interesting are linguistics and economics.\n\nOutside of the classroom, I was elected to be the Junior Class Vice President and I am a member of the school’s Disciplinary Committee, the panel of students who determine what punishment should be used for any rules violations. I am also in the National Honor Society, Spanish Honor Society, Montverde Academy Distinguished Scholar, and I have a Highest Honors Ranking."
