        "text": "Fred D. Brown, Jr., age 84, of Shelton, beloved husband of Caroline (DeGruttolo) Brown, passed away peacefully on Friday, April 12, 2024 at his home surrounded by his loving family. Born in Bridgeport on November 24, 1939, he was a son of the late Fred D. and Marie (Mitchell) Brown and was a longtime resident of Shelton.\n\nMr. Brown was drafted into the United States Army and was stationed in Panama and served as a Radioman during the Panama uprising. After proudly serving his country, Fred went to work for the City of Bridgeport in the Tree Department and later became the Foreman at Seaside Park where he retired after 25 years of dedicated service. Fred wasn't retired very long before he joined the Custodial Department with the Town of Stratford Board of Education. He was a huge UConn women's basketball fan, long before it was trendy, and a New York Giants fan.\n\nFred was the biggest cheerleader for his grandchildren and could be found at all of their sporting events cheering them on. Above everything his greatest joy came from spending time with his family. He was a devoted husband and loving father, grandfather and great grandfather and will be missed by all who knew and loved him.\n\nFred was blessed to spend 61 glorious years of marriage with his perfect match and best friend Caroline. In addition to his wife Caroline, survivors include his loving children, Fred R. Brown and his wife Dawn and Karen Philippas and her husband Luke, four grandchildren, Kera Niedzwecki and her husband Brian, Zackery Philippas, Nicholas Brown and Joshua Philippas and his wife Kasara, and great granddaughter, Bria.\n\nHe was predeceased by a sister, Irene Haschak, three brothers, Timothy, Daniel and Walter Brown and a grandson, Fred R. Brown Jr.\n\nAll are invited to attend a Mass of Christian Burial on Thursday, April 18, 2024 at 10 a.m. directly in St. Catherine of Siena Church, 200 Shelton Rd., Trumbull. Entombment with Full Military Honors will follow in Mount St. Peter's Cemetery, Derby. Friends may greet the family on Wednesday, April 17th from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. at the Abriola Parkview Funeral Home, 419 White Plains Road, Trumbull."
