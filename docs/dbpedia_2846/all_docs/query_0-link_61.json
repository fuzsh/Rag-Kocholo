        "text": "PROVIDENCE, R.I. — The swapping of Buddy stories is a common pastime here. Nearly everyone is in on the game because the man called Buddy was everywhere. At the block parties. At the ribbon cuttings. At the Little League games. In the bars. In your head.\n\nIt hardly matters that Buddy, also known as former Mayor Vincent A. Cianci Jr., has resided for the last three years at the St. Ann Cemetery in nearby Cranston . He lives on in anecdotes that sound apocryphal only if you haven’t spent time in Providence.\n\nHere’s a test. Is the following true or false?\n\nWhile stewing one night at home, the mayor of Providence summoned a man he believed to be sleeping with his estranged wife. Then, in the presence of a city police officer guarding the door, he tortured and assaulted the man with an ashtray, a fireplace log, a lighted cigarette and a coffee mug.\n\nGood for you if you guessed false. There was no coffee mug.\n\nThe story of Cianci’s rise and fall (and rise and fall) is the story of recent Providence history; an urban opéra b ouffe. So it was all but destined that the city’s leading theater, the Trinity Repertory Company, would someday make dramatic use of the rich material he generously provided right up to his death in 2016, at 74."
