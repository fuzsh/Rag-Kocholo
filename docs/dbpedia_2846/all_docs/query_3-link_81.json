        "text": "— For years, Nick Brown and other employees of Southwest Power Pool operated in what Brown calls “stealth mode.”\n\n“Nobody knew who we were,” Brown says. “There was a strategy not to talk about yourself. If somebody asked, we'd say, ‘It’s an engineering firm.’ We didn’t hide it, per se. We just didn’t talk about it.”\n\nThere was a reason for the low-key approach: Southwest Power Pool coordinates the transmission of electricity within a nine-state region, a task considered critical to national security.\n\nBrown is more than willing to talk about Southwest Power Pool today, and there’s plenty to discuss. Since 2003, when he became chief executive officer and president, the nonprofit organization of power producers, transmitters and marketers has quadrupled in size and scope of responsibilities. Today it boasts more than 500 employees and an annual budget of $139 million.\n\nBy mid-2012, Southwest Power Pool is scheduled to move its headquarters from a high-rise near Park Plaza mall to a new $62 million, high-security complex in west Little Rock.\n\nAnd just last month, the organization that once kept a low profile won the outstanding philanthropic corporation award presented by Arkansas’ chapter of the Association of Professional Fundraisers.\n\nIn deciding how Southwest Power Pool could best contribute to the community, Brown found the answer in the psychologist Abraham Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, the most basic of which include food. When the Arkansas Foodbank staged its cereal drive this year, Southwest Power Pool employees responded with 27,878 boxes.\n\n“We didn’t just win it, we killed it,” Brown says. “I couldn’t be more proud.”\n\nFriends tease Brown about being obsessive-compulsive, but his attention to detail comes in handy when dealing with something as complex as the nation’s electrical grid. A preference for building consensus rather than do-it-my-way leadership suits him to lead an organization whose 68 members all have a sayin its operation.\n\n“I think Nick’s been the catalyst for most of the progress,” says Jim Eckelberger of Dallas, a retired Navy rear admiral who chairs the Southwest Power Pool board. “I think his work is spectacular.”\n\nBrown also seems to have a knack for confronting and learning from challenges, including some tough ones he faced early in life.\n\nORPHANED AT 15\n\nBrown spent his first years in Hope, where his father, Gilbert Thomas, was minister of music at First Baptist Church. When Nick was 5, Thomas moved the family to Louisville, Ky., to attend a seminary. Shortly after, he died of a heart attack at age 32, having outlived several previous generations of Thomas men.\n\n“It just runs in the family,” Brown says.\n\nNick attended junior high school in Tulsa. Just before he was to start high school, his mother, Anita Jean Thomas, returned with her family to Hope, where she’d been hired as a church secretary.\n\nBut Anita remained devastated by her husband’s death, at times suffering from mental illness and believing he was still alive. She died on Valentine’s Day in 1974. Nick was 15.\n\n“She died of a broken heart,” Brown says. “She could not get over the death of my father.”\n\n“How much of an impact that had on me, I’m not sure,” Brown says. “I knew she was not well.”\n\nHugh and Viva Brown, who had known Brown’s family through church, offered to take in Nick and his older sister, Lisa, who was just starting college at Ouachita Baptist University in Arkadelphia, so the siblings wouldn’t be separated. A year later, they adopted Nick.\n\n“He’s my hero,” Nick says of Hugh Brown, who still lives in Hope. Viva died three years ago.\n\nHugh Brown worked in his family’s fuel distributorship. Relatively well off, the Browns exposed Nick to travel and other material things. Even more, they supplied a support system he’d been lacking.\n\n“It was an amazing thing for them to take in an orphan from a troubled family,” Brown says. “I guess they just had love in their hearts.”\n\n“We just gave him recognition that he hadn’t been getting,” Hugh Brown says. “He said, ‘I just wasn’t used to somebody paying attention to me.’”\n\nHugh Brown recalled a family trip to Estes Park, Colo. After dropping Lisa off at band camp, he handed the car keys to Nick, who’d just started driving, and told him to get them home.\n\n“He said later, ‘It liked to scared me to death, but you showed so much trust in me,’” Hugh Brown says.\n\nNick later told Hugh that he probably wouldn’t have finished high school without the Browns stepping in. Nick made good grades in high school but really focused on music. He was first-chair trumpet in the band and drum major his senior year.\n\nAs he prepared for college, Hugh Brown questioned Nick about his plans. Like his older sister, Lisa, now a pianist in Dallas, Nick intended to major in music in college.\n\n“I said, ‘Well, what are you going to do with it? Do you want to teach?’” Hugh says. “He said, ‘No, I don’t want to do that.’ I said, ‘Well, don’t do it if you’re not going to be able to use it later.’”\n\nNick saw the logic. “While I was a decent horn player, I’d never have made a living at it.”\n\nFROM MUSIC TO MATH\n\nBrown followed his sister to OBU, majoring in physics and math and applying the diligence to those subjects that he’d applied to music. He sold his trumpet and helped pay his way through school by working as a lab assistant.\n\nFrom OBU, Brown moved to the graduate school for electrical engineering at Louisiana Tech University in Ruston.\n\nNick Akins remembers Brown as the most organized of a group of graduate-school friends who went on a canoe trip in Arkansas.\n\n“After three days, it becomes pretty primitive, you know,” says Akins, who’s now president of the Ohio-based American Electric Power. “He [Brown] was the one that organized all the cookouts and breakfasts and everything else. It all goes back to his being meticulous, maybe borderline obsessive-compulsive. He had it all planned out.”\n\nBrown intended to get his doctorate and teach at the university level. His department head at Louisiana Tech told Brown he’d have to devote most of his time to research.\n\nBrown decided that if he couldn’t teach, he was going to work where he’d be better paid. He took a job with SWEPCO (Southwestern Electric Power Co.) in Shreveport. Projects he worked on included extending the company’s power lines from Texarkana to Hope and building the Flint Creek power stationin Northwest Arkansas.\n\nAfter three years with SWEPCO, Brown left for a job with Southwest Power Pool. At the time, he was one of seven employees. He became a manager four years later, a vice president a decade later, and in 2003 was chosen by Eckelberger and others to head the organization. By then, Southwest Power Pool had 116 employees, but its biggest growth was still to come.\n\n“It just kept evolving over the years and still is,” Brownsays. “It’s amazing.”\n\nAIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER\n\nBrown usually explains what Southwest Power Pool does by analogy: Southwest is to electricity what air traffic controllers are to airlines.\n\n“We don’t own the airlines or the airport, but we coordinate the traffic to ensure that the airplanes arrive safely.”\n\nElectric companies have been interconnected - buying and selling power from each other - since the early part of this century. Southwest Power Pool dates to 1941, when 11 utility companies pooled electricity to power an Arkansas aluminum plant needed for World War II aircraft production.\n\nRecognizing the benefits of regional coordination, the members decided to maintain the organization after the war. There was a small staff, but most of the planning, studies and other work was done by the members or outside consultants.\n\nThe need for better safeguards in the nation’s electrical grid became evident when the Northeast blackout of 1965 struck, leaving more than 30 million people in New England and Canada in the dark for up to 12 hours. In 1968, Southwest Power became one of eight regional councils established to improve the system’s reliability.\n\nBy the time Brown came aboard, Southwest PowerPool was doing more of its work in-house, mainly to save money. It added employees as it added responsibilities. In 1997, it began monitoring power flow throughout the region, working to prevent blackouts and coordinating the response when they occurred. In 1998, it began processing transmission requests by its members.\n\nThe growth really escalated after the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission passed regulations designed to make the wholesale electric market more competitive. As a result, in 2004 Southwest Power became what’s called a Regional Transmission Organization. Southwest Power now coordinates the movement of power through the region, operates a wholesale power market and plans for the future needs of the network.\n\nIn his office, Brown shows a visitor a map of the region’s electric grid, which looks like an anatomical chart might if somebody tried to include every artery and vein down to the smallest capillary.\n\nBrown says the North American electrical grid has been called “the single most complex machine on earth.”\n\nHow complex? The region covered just by Southwest Power Pool includes 847 generating plants, 6,101 substations and some 50,000 miles of transmission lines spread out over 370,000 square milesof service territory.\n\n“Every time you plug something in, it becomes part of that machine,” Brown says.\n\nOnce Southwest Power reached a certain size, Brown says, it made no sense to try to fly under the radar. Crucial operations are centered in a security-hardened facility in Maumelle that will become a backup for those at the new headquarters in west Little Rock.\n\nBACK TO MUSIC\n\nBrown never lost his love of music. In 2002, he helped found the River City Men’s Chorus, a 50-voice group known for its annual Christmas concert. Brown sings tenor. Last month, the chorus toured Italy, performing in St. Peter’s Basilica. It also funds a scholarship for young men majoring in music.\n\nTwo decades after selling his trumpet, Brown took up that instrument again, along with the fluegelhorn. He plays with church groups and occasionally at weddings.\n\n“I think there’s a correlation between a technical mind-set and music,” Brown says.\n\nHe’s also a pilot, though he insists he learned to fly and bought a small plane strictly for business reasons.\n\n“It’s how I get from point A to point B,” he says. “It’s like a VW with wings - four seats and no AC.”\n\nBrown’s wife, Susan, says her husband decided to get his pilot’s license after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, when airport security precautions made travel even more time-consuming.\n\n“He set a goal to get it done by a certain date,” Susan Brown says. “He was done in half that time and moving on.”\n\nBrown’s first marriage to Debbie Freeze ended in divorce after 19 years and two children. The two remain on good terms. Brown said Freeze, a nurse, volunteered to care for his father afterHugh Brown fell and broke his arm while visiting Little Rock this year.\n\nHe married Susan, whose first husband had died of cancer, in 2000. Susan worked as an administrative assistant at Southwest Power Pool until Brown’s appointment as CEO triggered its anti-nepotism policy.\n\nNick and Susan are both active in Trinity United Methodist Church, singing in its choir and attending Sunday School. Susan is on the board of Our House homeless shelter and Nick is chairman-elect of the Arkansas Symphony Board.\n\n“I just can’t imagine life without her,” Nick Brown says of Susan. “Our temperaments are very much alike, yet she’s the feeling side and I’m the thinking side.”\n\nSusan sees both sides of her husband. She sees cares melt away from his face as they cross the dam to De-Gray Lake, where they keep a houseboat. They get together with their four children - sons Chesley, 27, and Nolan, 26, and daughters Jaime and Lana, both 24 - for lunch after church each Sunday. There’s almost wonder in Susan’s voice as she describes Nick with the dog they adopted from the Humane Society of Pulaski County shelter.\n\n“Nick’s very neat and organized,” Susan says. “He likes everything in its place. Then this little mutt came into our lives. He sheds like crazy. If you could see them together, all that stuff just goes out the window.”\n\nBut she also remembers him telling her that the way to accomplish things was to set a goal and do something - anything - to reach it every day.\n\nNick Brown doesn’t deny it.\n\n“Physics taught me one thing - nothing ever stays the same,” he says. “I just strive to improve in every aspect of life, and that takes time and effort.”SELF PORTRAIT\n\nNick Brown\n\nDATE AND PLACE OF BIRTH Jan. 15, 1959, Tulsa\n\nTHE GUESTS AT MY FANTASY DINNER PARTY WOULD BE King David, Jesus, Michelangelo and Abraham Lincoln.\n\nTHE MENU FOR THAT PARTY WOULD BE Six-ounce filet, medium-rare, nestled in a bed of Susan’s cheese grits, all smothered in sauteed baby portobello mushrooms and red onions, accompanied by a bottle of 2000 Far Niente Cabernet. Tiramisu for dessert with a shaken Brandy Alexander served up with nutmeg.\n\nI COULDN’T LIVE WITHOUT MY Faith, hope and love.\n\nTHE LAST BOOK I READ WAS Start With Why by Simon Sinek.\n\nTHE BEST ADVICE I EVER RECEIVED WAS Don’t major in music because you may be a good horn player but you aren’t good enough to live on it!\n\nMY IDEA FOR A PERFECT DAY IS Swimming and water skiing followed by dinner enjoyed by family and friends on top of our houseboat while watching the sun set over Lake DeGray.\n\nIF I WASN’T RUNNING SOUTHWEST POWER POOL I WOULD BE A commercial pilot and part-time college professor.\n\nMY WIFE THINKS I AM Very picky!\n\nI DRIVE A 2003 Ford Expedition 4x4 that’s in great condition.\n\nONE THING I’D LIKE TO DO BEFORE I DIE IS Witness a true spirit of public service displace the greed and selfishness in many of our elected and appointed officials.\n\nONE WORD TO SUM ME UP Tenacious."
