        "text": "Raise your hand if you've tied your personal identity to your work 🙋♂️ Ok, lower your hand. Raise your hand if you've seen a colleague/peer/friend/classmate etc doing well and start to question if you're doing enough in life 🙋♂️ Ok, lower your hand again... Tomorrow we're doing a session on mental health with Kara Hardin (hosted by Daniel J. Murphy) in Exit Five - specifically your professional identity vs. who you are outside of work. Kara Hardin is the Founder and CEO of The Practice Lab. She is a mental health educator, Registered Psychotherapist, and former practicing corporate and securities lawyer. We are going to discuss: ➡ How we come to treat our work as our identities ➡ Ways to separate and ground your sense of worth (regardless of your productivity) ➡ Practices to navigate the emotional ups and downs of being between jobs, overworking in your role and feeling the need to be perfect in your life To attend, you need to be an Exit Five member, but if you’re interested in joining, you can use the code “KARA” when you sign up for a membership. DM/comment if you have questions.\n\nIn the four months since incorporating Opportunity Knocks Communications and working with clients, a major life transition, I've done a great deal of growing and learning along the way. Here's my top five (at least today's top five). 1. Always go to the bathroom when you can. You never know when you might have access or time again. 2. Prioritize exercise. Mental health and physical health are closely tied, we aren't built to sit at desks all day. 3. You never get to go backwards. The time I've been able to spend with family and friends has been irreplaceable and I am so thankful for every second. Recently talking to an aging and ailing friend, he expressed that right now I am choosing to spend time with family and friends, helping with their needs - when you get older, you don't get to choose. inevitably we will lose some and young ones will grow old and set out on their own. 4. Get a puppy. He hasn't arrived yet so this one is tentative at the moment. But I am thrilled to have a companion to share my days starting in mid-February (this will certainly impact rules one through three making them even more important). That's him at the bottom. Yes, I am shamelessly exploiting puppy pictures. 5. Accept what you can't control. The hardest rule to follow yet something that would be on my list any day. Let go of things outside your control and grab onto things within your control, you'll be happier for it - I promise.\n\nIn our fast-paced world, it's easy to get caught up in the daily grind and overlook the profound impact of genuine human connection. Yet, it's this very connection that fuels our spirits, nurtures our souls, and strengthens our communities. When we feel truly seen, heard, and valued, something magical happens. It's an energy that can't be replicated—an invisible thread that binds us together. It’s the comfort of a friend who listens without interrupting, the warmth of a hug that says “I understand,” and the joy of being appreciated just as we are. These moments of connection are the lifeblood of our emotional well-being. Why Connection Matters: 💬 Feeling Seen and Heard: In a world where everyone is talking, truly listening is a rare and precious gift. When someone takes the time to listen to our stories, fears, and dreams without judgment, it creates a safe space where we can be our authentic selves. This validation is crucial for our self-esteem and mental health. ❤️ Giving and Receiving Without Judgment: True connection is a two-way street, where giving and receiving support happen naturally and without conditions. It’s about showing up for each other in times of joy and sorrow, celebrating successes, and providing comfort in difficult times. 💪 Deriving Strength from Relationships: Our connections with others are a source of sustenance and strength. They help us navigate life’s challenges and celebrate its triumphs. Whether it’s family, friends, or a supportive community, these relationships provide a foundation of support that empowers us to thrive.\n\nTo the young professional who’s feeling: ⚫️Tired ⚫️Lonely ⚫️Anxious ⚫️Burn Out ⚫️Insecure ⚫️Overlooked ⚫️Overwhelmed You’re not alone🤍 Over 50% of young professionals report experiencing mental health challenges at work. A couple of years ago, after a close family member of mine passed away. I struggled to get back into work. So, I opened up to my mentor, and she listened. She also suggested the book Hope Restored by Hannah C. Fairchild. If you’re experiencing mental health issues. Reach out to a colleague who you trust or a mentor. You can also meet with a HR representative. To see if your organisation has support resources. In light of mental health awareness week.

Without a vision, you may find yourself wandering aimlessly without direction, feeling unfulfilled or stuck in an unsatisfactory situation. In contrast, having a clear vision for your life provides a roadmap for where you want to go and what you want to achieve. A clear vision helps you identify your priorities and focus on what is truly important to you. It allows you to make decisions that align with your values and goals, and avoid distractions that can lead you off course. Furthermore, a vision provides motivation and inspiration to keep you going, even when faced with obstacles or setbacks. However, developing a vision for your life can be challenging. It requires self-reflection, careful planning, and a willingness to take risks. It may also involve making difficult choices and sacrifices along the way. But the reward of living a life that aligns with your vision is well worth the effort. In conclusion, having a vision for your life is crucial to achieving your goals and living a fulfilling life. It provides clarity, direction, motivation, and inspiration to help you stay on track and achieve your dreams. So take the time to reflect on what's important to you and create a vision that will guide you towards the life you truly desire.

There’s something uniquely powerful about those who face their own pain and struggle and then choose to use those experiences to help others. Many people in the helping professions carry their own stories of adversity—stories that have shaped them, tested them, and ultimately strengthened them. These experiences don’t just add to who they are as clinicians; they make them even better at what they do. They’ve walked their own path, and now they walk alongside their clients, guiding them with the kind of empathy and understanding that only comes from lived experience. We all go through crises in life. But what matters most is what we do with that crisis. Do we let it define us, or do we repurpose it into something meaningful? The truth is that a crisis can always be a catalyst for transformational growth. Let's embark on this journey together 🌻 Have your personal experiences made you better at what you do professionally?

The conversation around mental health has been such an important topic for our team and one I have had to better understand myself. Thankfully with the help of this platform that information is often front and center from some incredible thought leaders like Adam Weber Kyle Lacy Andrew Huberman Rich Roll Santiago (Santi) Jaramillo Dr. Craig Overmyer and many more! Two years ago we started with the idea to close the business, across every team, every department and every role so that we could: 1. highlight the need to talk about mental health as a company 2. so that we could literally make space for you to focus on yourself, if only for one working shift for one day by closing down the company The feedback from our team has been incredible, they validated how important this day is but they also highlighted something we didn't even think about when we started. When you go on vacation, other people are working and at times it can feel like work piles up while you are gone and then you come back to \"dig out\" but with our mental health day, when we shut it down and literally discourage working, everyone can collectively breathe a sigh of relief knowing that no one is adding anything to your plate. I'm still learning, we are still making space and we are excited to launch our 2nd mental health day of the year tomorrow. We don't have it all figured out, we have lots to learn but I hope this could encourage someone or other companies to find ways to make space for what belongs by inviting conversations around mental health and like we did two years ago, beg borrow and steal some new ideas. Our entire team California Closets: Indiana | Illinois | Ohio | Kentucky will see you on Monday 😎 #mentalhealth #mentalhealthawareness #culture #leadership\n\nWE ALL NEED TO BE TUCKED IN “Clara Ramas, philosopher: \"We are all children outdoors wishing to be tucked in\". Article published in the newspaper \"EL PAÍS\". When a person is at their peak in relation to mental health, there is a common aspect that is repeated with more or less intensity: VULNERABILITY. Vulnerability increased and conditioned by two aspects: the impossibility on the part of the individual to act directly (it is not a physical wound), with sometimes partial or not entirely accurate diagnoses, a combination of chemicals that responds to the type and dose when finding the right combination, increasing the feeling of insecurity. The other aspect is the external world (I don't remember the line from the Joker movie again). After COVID, individualism and the loss of values have multiplied, I would say, exponentially. Faced with a vulnerability of such magnitude, people who suffer from it need to be \"tucked in\" at least during the process. It goes without saying that when that person, once recovered, is \"lucky\" if they have a profile that can provide a differential value (to avoid entry barriers) to enter an organization it is necessary to \"wrap them up\" with actions that have hardly any cost (in order of priority: isolation from any toxic environment, flexibility in deadlines and \"ad-oc\" (recoverable) breaks). As Clara Ramas says, we all need to be tucked in. I remember a (extreme) scene from the movie \"saving private Ryan where an American soldier in the middle of the Normandy landings and trying to protect himself screams at his mother scared to death. I personally believe that even the most aggressive executive on Wall Street could collapse if a good enough psychologist struck a chord with him on an emotional issue.\n\n🌿 Exploring the Link Between Psychology and the Environment 🌿 This month at Layla we are exploring mental well-being related to the environment. There is a profound connection between our psychological well-being and our external surroundings, including the environment. Here are some key points to understand the connection between psychology and environmental shifts and challenges: ➡ Window of Tolerance: Each of us has a unique threshold for stress and change, known as our window of tolerance. Major events, like climate change, that provoke fear can push us beyond our tolerance window. When this happens, our ability to manage stress significantly decreases, leading to reactions such as anger or emotional shutdown. ➡ Emotional Shutdown: Feeling overwhelmed by major issues such as climate change can cause us to shut down or even avoid the issue. This reaction can stems from a sense of powerlessness, which highlights the impact environmental issues have on our mental health. ➡ Collective Action: Managing mental well-being in the midst of environmental distress involves connecting with others and engaging in impactful environmental initiatives. Our emotional well-being is closely tied to what we do and how we connect with what is important to us. By supporting each other and taking collective action to nurture our environment, we can increase feelings of connection and increase our sense of agency."
