        "text": "Thousands of New England’s historic barns have survived severe weather, westward migration, suburban sprawl and competition from corporate agribusiness.\n\nOften connected to other farm buildings and the farmhouse, they usually had many uses. Historic barns sheltered dairy cows, teams of oxen, horses, hay and crops.\n\nSome historic barns, on the other hand, were built specifically for one purpose, like Connecticut tobacco or Vermont dairy cows.\n\nBut typical New England farm families grew a variety of crops and livestock, making and selling anything to support the farm. A New England farmer might sell maple syrup, timber, clothing, hard cider and barrels. He might run a tavern, or rent out his rooms or his beehives.\n\nBig House, Little House…\n\nNorthern New England’s historic barns often connect to the house and to other buildings, Thomas L. Hubka described such connected farm buildings as ‘Big House, Little House, Back House, Barn.’\n\nThough you might assume New Englanders connected their houses to outbuildings because of the weather, you would be only partly right.\n\nAccording to Hubka, the agricultural reform movement beginning in the early 19th century inspired New England farmers to make their farms more efficient.\n\nSo they connected their houses with such outbuildings as barns, ells, chicken coops, sugar houses, woodsheds, workshops and carriage sheds.\n\nFarming as a way of life has waned in New England, but the public appetite for locally grown, unadulterated food is sparking a revival on a smaller scale.\n\nIf you have any favorite historic barns in New England, please share them in the comments section.\n\nWindsor Tobacco Barn\n\nTobacco loved the sandy soil of Windsor, Conn., and in 1640 farmers began planting tobacco seeds from Virginia. As cigar smoking grew popular in the early 19th century, Connecticut farmers began to specialize in cigar binders using Broadleaf and Havana Seed. Eventually, they grew a light, tasty tobacco under tents of hand-woven cloth (hence ‘shade tobacco’) to use as wrappers.\n\nBy the middle of the 19th century, Connecticut emerged as a leading producer of tobacco. The tobacco Valley ran from Springfield to Hartford.\n\nTobacco farmers relied on seasonal labor from college campuses in the South, including Morehead College, which sent a young Martin Luther King, Jr., to Simsbury. They also used local child labor. World War II and the passage of child labor laws forced farmers to rely on immigrant workers from Puerto Rico and Jamaica.\n\nHealth concerns and competition from mass-produced cigar wrappers caused Connecticut’s tobacco acreage to dwindle.\n\nWindsor produced more shade tobacco than anywhere else in the state. So in 1988, the Connecticut Valley Tobacco Historical Society formed in Windsor to preserve artifacts from the era. The historical society’s Luddy/Taylor Connecticut Valley Tobacco Museum is located in Northwest Park in Windsor.\n\n135 Lang Road, Windsor, Connecticut\n\nSabbathday Lake Barns\n\nAnn Lee founded the Shaker sect, formally known as the The United Society of Believers, in Manchester, England, in 1847. Lee broke away from the Quakers, and her followers were known as the ‘Shaking Quakers’ because of their ecstatic dancing during Sunday meeting.\n\nAfter Ann Lee – known as ‘Mother Ann’ – went to prison for her beliefs, she came to America with eight followers in 1774.\n\nThe Shakers expanded to 19 utopian communities throughout the Northeast and Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, Georgia and Florida. They preached a doctrine of celibacy, self-sufficiency, pacifism, communal living and equality between the sexes.\n\nIn 1794, the Shakers formed Sabbathday Lake near New Gloucester and Poland, Maine,\n\nBy the 1840s, the Sabbathday Lake Shakers had carved a large enterprise out of the Maine forests. They owned 1,900 acres and 26 large buildings, including barns, a meetinghouse, a blacksmith shop and a large dwelling house.\n\nThe Sabbathay Lake Shakers built their barns in the New England style, the most common found in the region. Larger than typical barns in other parts of the country, they have doors at the ends and basements. The Shakers built the Sabbathday Lake barns into the side of a hill, which allowed them to access the upper floor from the ground.\n\nThe Shakers peaked in the 1840s, with 6,000 members throughout the United States. Their belief in celibacy would doom them to slow, near extinction.\n\nBut for many years during the 19th century, the simple, self-sufficient Shakers of Sabbathday Lake, Maine, sold their products to the luxury-loving guests and the owners of the Poland Spring Hotel.\n\n707 Shaker Road, New Gloucester, Maine\n\nOld Tavern Farm\n\nLike many historic barns in Northern New England, the barn at the Old Tavern Farm in Greenfield, Mass., connects to buildings with other uses.\n\nThe Old Tavern Farm served many purposes over the centuries, reverting today to its original use as a bed and breakfast.\n\nThe farm’s early owners supplemented their farm income by running a tavern – or perhaps it was the other way around. They served neighbors and travelers along the Old Post Road\n\nThe tavern also served as a meeting place, a courtroom and a newsroom, noted the registration form for the National Register of Historic Places. The property doubled as a military training field, sports arena, stockyard and fairgrounds.\n\nSamuel Hinsdale inherited the farm from his father, Mehuman Hinsdale, once taken captive by Indians in the 1704 raid on Deerfield. Hinsdale began building on the land in 1740, and by 1747 he operated a tavern.The main house was built around 1820, but the wing was built in 1794 on Hinsdale’s foundation.\n\nOthers ran the tavern from 1836 until 1860, when the temperance movement shut it down. The Smith family ran the 160-acre farm from the latter part of the 19th century until 1997.\n\n817 Colrain Road, Greenfield, Massachusetts\n\nBennett Farm\n\nOcean Born Mary’s son Thomas Wallace once owned the land in Henniker that became the Bennett Farm. The son of the legendary New Hampshire woman then sold it to Joseph Lewis in 1777. Its subsequent owners ran it as a tavern until 1848. From that point on, its owners ran it as a typical Northern New England farm.\n\nThe barn was built in 1834 as a religious meeting house. Around 1860, the Bennett Farm’s barn burned down, so the farm’s owner moved the meeting house to the farm and converted it to a barn. The top of the steeple blew off during the Hurricane of 1938, leaving a cupola. .\n\nMark Bennett bought the farm in 1902, and his son Stephen took over when his father died in 1925 and ran it into the 1960s. Stephen’s son now runs the farm.\n\n“Bennett Farm as it survives today conveys the character and scale of a late 19th-early 20th century diversified family farm,” notes The National Register of Historic Places registration form.\n\n11 Bennett Rd., Henniker, New Hampshire\n\nMount Hope Farm\n\nThe Mount Hope Farm in Bristol, R.I., includes a mansion built in 1745 and expanded in 1840 and 1895, and two historic barns built in 1860. But it also owes its significance to its storied owners and connected events.\n\nOnce the traditional seat of the Wampanoag Indians, Benjamin Church killed King Philip nearby. The colonists then confiscated the land, and the wealthy merchant and slave owner Isaac Royall, Jr., built the farmhouse in 1745. But Royall’s Loyalist sympathies forced him to move to Halifax at the outbreak of the American Revolution.\n\nThe State of Rhode Island then confiscated the land again. Proceeds from the sale of Mount Hope went to pay Continental Army officers and soldiers.\n\nWilliam Bradford, great, great grandson of the Pilgrim governor, bought the house in 1783, and George Washington visited him for a week there. Bradford later won election to the U.S. Senate. The farm is also known as the Governor Bradford House, though he only served as deputy governor.\n\nIn the early 1950’s, the then-owner, Rudolf F. Haffenreffer, III, deeded Mount Hope and approximately 250 acres of the original farm to Brown University.\n\n“Today, this handsome estate with its historic mansion and beautiful gardens, is an island of tranquility in an increasingly urban landscape,” noted the National Register of Historic Places registration form.\n\n250 Metacom Ave., Bristol, Rhode Island\n\nShelburne Farms Horseshoe Barn\n\nCornelius Vanderbilt’s granddaughter, Eliza Osgood Vanderbilt Webb, created a classic Gilded Age gentleman farm in Shelburne, Vt.\n\nEliza and her husband, Dr. William Seward Webb, bought up small farms to create their 3,800-acre estate in 1886. They hired Frederick Law Olmsted to design the winding drives, scenic vistas, parklands, gardens and a golf course.\n\nAmong Shelburne Farms’ historic barns is the horseshoe barn, not one of the original buildings designed by architect Robert Henderson Robertson. It was built later as the next generation of Vanderbilts struggled to keep up the farm.\n\nThe Webbs’ daughter-in-law, Electra Havemeyer Webb, turned Shelburne Farms into a museum. She wanted a proper setting for the carriage collection, so she searched and found a rare horseshoe-shaped dairy born in Georgia, Vt.\n\nBecause the owner refused to sell it, Electra had her staff find, move and assemble hand-hewn beams from 12 historic barns and stone from two gristmills. They finished the 238-foot-long barn in 1949.\n\nIn 1957, the museum built the annex to house 150 more vehicles added to the collection.\n\nIn 1972, the Webb descendants incorporated Shelburne Farms as a nonprofit educational organization. It has 400 acres of sustainably managed woods and a grass-fed herd of Brown Swiss cows. It’s also one of the principal concert sites for the Vermont Mozart Festival. Shelburne Farms also features an inn and restaurant, open seasonally, on the shores of Lake Champlain, tours, walking trails, a children’s farmyard and a farm store that sells, among other things, cheddar cheese.\n\nShelburne Farms, 1611 Harbor Road, Shelburne, Vermont\n\nImages: Bennett Farm By User:Magicpiano – Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=19490337; Old Tavern Farm By John Phelan – Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=24500134.\n\nMount Hope Barn by By Kenneth C.

The tradition of college pranks came to North America with the Puritans.\n\nIn the early 1800s, Harvard students thought it amusing to ring the bell in Memorial Hall during the wee hours of the morning. But at Brown, students preferred to muffle the college bell.\n\nOver the years, college pranks have involved putting farm animals in inappropriate places. Pranksters often victimized prominent statues as well. Dartmouth students painted the statue of Harvard’s John Harvard green, Yale students painted him blue and others put him in women’s underwear.\n\nHere we bring you six historic college pranks performed at New England institutions of higher learning. If you know of any other college pranks, please include them in the comments section.\n\nCollege Pranks, Animal House Style\n\nThere’s nothing like a sports rivalry to inspire college pranks, and the University of Connecticut and the University of Rhode Island, not 60 miles apart, are no exception.\n\nIn 1933, Connecticut State Agricultural College changed its name to Connecticut State College, and renamed its football team the Statesman rather than the Aggies.\n\nIt didn’t help the team. In 1934, the Connecticut Statesmen lost six out of their first seven games, while their opponents shut them out five times. Their final home game against the Rhode Island State Rams was likely to end badly for Connecticut.\n\nThen Connecticut students learned that Rhode Island students planned to taunt them by bringing Ulysses, their ram mascot, to the game.\n\nThe Connecticut students stole Ulysses. During the 1934 game, Connecticut fans paraded Ulysses on the field accompanied by the marching band. As expected, Connecticut lost 18-0, Rhody fans tore down the goal posts and a fight broke out.\n\nThe next month, Connecticut chose as its mascot the Husky, a less kidnappable animal than the ram. For years afterward, Connecticut students ramnapped Ulysses and his successors. And for years afterward, the winner of the UConn-Rhode Island football game took home Ramnapping Trophy. When Rhode Island quit using live rams as mascots in 1974, the trophy was moved to the J. Robert Donnelly Husky Heritage Sports Museum on the UConn campus.\n\nStreaking in Winter\n\nCollege pranks took the form of streaking on college campuses starting in the early 1970s. Defined as running naked through a public place, streaking started out with solitary males running across campus or at sporting events. Women soon joined in the fun and streakers began running around en masse.\n\nSome historians peg the beginning of the craze after newspapers began reported streakers at Florida State in January 1974. Despite the New England winter, University of Maine students quickly took up the sport at Orono.\n\nThe student government in March called a meeting at Memorial Hall to discuss how to handle the streaking epidemic. One streaker couldn’t resist temptation, and he streaked the meeting.\n\nThe state of Maine ended up enacting a law against streaking, but it proved ineffective. On Nov. 2, 2002, a police officer arrested two University of Maine undergraduate women for jogging naked through downtown Orono. A prosecutor charged them with indecent conduct. One of the women asked the police officer if he saw her genitals. He said no. The judge ruled a woman naked in the street is not an indecent act under Maine law because a woman’s genitals are primarily internal.\n\nMIT Masters College Pranks\n\nThe geeks at MIT have so perfected college pranks over the centuries that the MIT Museum once featured a Hall of Hacks.\n\nThe college pranks at MIT often display technical aptitude, something you’d expect at a university that teaches technology. MIT students once put a campus police car on top of the Great Dome, its lights flashing and its dummy inhabitant enjoying coffee and donuts.\n\nLater, they put a subway car on the Great Dome and got it moving.\n\nIn the 1930s, Ken Wadleigh and four other MIT students welded a streetcar to its rails. They distracted the motorman and then set off thermite bombs to weld the wheels. Wadleigh became a dean at MIT.\n\nIn 1958, MIT students used undergraduate Oliver R. Smoot to measure the length of the Harvard Bridge. They marked the bridge at every Smoot, and measured it as 364.4 Smoots, plus or minus an ear. When the bridge was renovated in 1964, the markings were restored, and they remain today.\n\nNot all pranks involve technology. MIT students dressed the John Harvard statue as the Unabomber after the arrest of that Harvard alumni.\n\nCow-centric College Pranks\n\nUniversity of New Hampshire students have long taken to heart the admonition, “If at all possible, involve a cow.”\n\nStudents at UNH, a land-grant college, have access to farm animals for their college pranks. Over the years, students put pigs and sheep in places where pigs and sheep don’t belong.\n\nIn the 1930s, Alpha Gamma Rho brothers managed to haul a cow into the Thompson Hall tower. Somehow they got the cow down as well.\n\nIn 1951, students replicated the college prank by stashing a cow in the second floor of Ballard Hall. A poem written by the night watchman, Pop Marshall, recounts the episode:\n\n“Now I’m willing to guard your property / And watch your buildings fine, / But teaching music to a cow / Is a little out of my line.”\n\nYears later, UNH would be victimized by a more serious college prank of sorts when popular physics professor Kevin Yates turned out to be a college dropout named Marvin Hewitt. Read Hewitt’s extraordinary story here.\n\nMessing With Messer\n\nIn the annals of Brown University, perhaps no administrator was so victimized by college pranks as Asa Messer. He became president in 1804, just when Nicholas Brown gave $5,000 to the College of Rhode Island and renamed it Brown. Under Messer’s tenure, the student body grew, but Brown’s bequest wasn’t quite enough to run the college to the student’s liking.\n\nBeloved tutors left Brown for other colleges, but Messer couldn’t afford to hire enough replacements to keep class size down.\n\nEarly in his presidency, students played harmless college pranks such as painting Messer’s horse or stabling it in his third-floor office.\n\nThen the students’ pranks turned dangerous. They built a hut of kindling and set it on fire next to University Hall, endangering the building’s roof and Messer’s barn. Students damaged dormitories in University Hall and broke windows and doors of Hope College’s new chapel.\n\nMesser didn’t believe in sparing the rod and spoiling the undergraduate. He punished pranksters by rusticating them – sending them off to work on a farm. They called him a tyrant.\n\nMesser believed the students aimed their vandalism at him personally, and he resigned.\n\nSamuel Gridley Howe had attended Brown during those troubled times, and had once led Dr. Messer’s horse into the belfry. He also put hot ashes in his tutor’s bed.\n\nAfter he founded the Perkins School for the Blind, Howe went to visit Dr. Messer. He apologized for his wayward youthful behavior. Messer replied, “Howe, I am afraid of you now. I am afraid there will be a torpedo under my chair before I know it.”\n\nPanty Raid To End All Panty Raids\n\nOn the evening of May 24, 1963, carloads of cadets from Norwich University led a panty raid against the women of Vermont College (now the Vermont College of Fine Arts).\n\nVermont’s faculty and staff had an inkling something would happen that evening. A local store clerk said he’d sold out of women’s underwear that day. Vermont Dean Pauline Collins told her students she’d received a call from Gen. Ernest Harmon, who headed of Norwich Academy, warning about the panty raid. She told them to cancel their dates, return to the dormitory by 7:00 p.m., turn out the lights when the panty raid began and let no one into the building.\n\nAt dusk, cars carrying 300 Norwich cadets began to arrive, followed by the police and fire department. A hose truck stopped in front of the dorm, and the firefighters jumped out to hook up the hoses. A Norwich cadet commandeered the fire truck and drove it into a fountain. Girls shouted from the windows, “Come on Norwich! We want Norwich!” Firefighters then turned their hoses on the students in the windows.\n\nFighting broke out between police and cadets. Police Chief George Connor said, “We were knocked down, kicked, and trampled upon. It’s a miracle that no one was killed.”\n\nIn the end, Vermont’s president issued a denial that his students had participated at all in the hijinks.\n\nImages: Smoot, By Denimadept – Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=6792703; Streaker, By Alex Kehr – originally posted to Flickr as #367, CC BY 2.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=3953923Thompson Hall at UNH By AcrossTheAtlantic – Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=63031225.

According to a review by R.V. Cassill the letters applauded him “for tearing the veil of hypocrisy from around the depravities of college life,” or they berated him “for spoiling the game by publicizing it.”\n\nSome actually asked for more information about “what really happened to clean-cut boys sent to Ivy league colleges to be perfected as gentlemen.”\n\nThough he paid a steep price for his unflattering picture of college life, Percy Marks inspired one of America’s most influential and popular humorists.\n\nPercy Marks\n\nPercy Marks was born in California in 1891 to Jewish parents. He graduated from the University of California in 1912, got a master’s from Harvard in 1914 and served in the U.S. Army as a second lieutenant during World War I. For a decade after the war he taught English at Dartmouth, MIT and then Brown.\n\nThe Jazz Age zeitgeist captivated Brown students, many of whom studied as little as possible between football games, fraternity parties and pep rallies.\n\nMarks didn’t think much of the emphasis on athletics and observed that half the seniors were semi-illiterate. He had little use for most professors, concluding there were ‘many specialists but few scholars, many pedants but few wise men, many wind-bags but few teachers.’\n\nAs a Jew he couldn’t help but notice anti-Semitism. “It would be absurd to say that the fraternity men never show prejudice against either the Jews or the Catholics; they show it against both,” he wrote.\n\nPercy Marks, Perelman Mentor\n\nMarks developed a following of Jewish students at Brown, including S. J. Perelman. He encouraged their writing and helped them cope with discrimination. He also witnessed Perelman’s sophomoric hijinks firsthand.\n\nPerelman edited the campus humor magazine, the Brown Jug. He got into trouble for a critique of Brown that pretty much mirrored Percy Marks:\n\n“Ah, the college boys, the college boys! I daresay that if all the sub-freshman who are intending to come to Brown could see it for what it is, a fraternity-ridden and lethargic academy of middle-class “boosters,” they would change their minds about starting for Providence next fall. From the dot of 9 o’clock when we rush in to fear God for fifteen minutes every morning till Cap Cameron ‘the campus policeman` puts the last blowzy drunk to bed, the spectacle is the same …”\n\nIn 1924, the Brown Jug feted Percy Marks at a banquet in Wickford, R.I. Percy Marks arrived to find a half-empty bottle of scotch on each table and the Jug writers throwing dinner rolls at each other. Perelman yanked a tablecloth off a table, sending flatware and china flying. The boys then began to wreck the restaurant, the owner threatened to call the police and Percy Marks persuaded them to go back to campus. The Jug paid for the damages.\n\nBanned\n\nThe Jug banquet was one of the last times Percy Marks appeared on campus. His book The Plastic Age became a publishing sensation. It described campus life at Sanford, a thinly disguised combination of Dartmouth and Brown, rampant with drinking, swearing and sex. Young women attending Sanford dances, he wrote, checked their corsets in the cloak room.\n\nThe Plastic Age was the second best-selling book of 1924 and was made into a film starring Clara Bow. It also drew harsh criticism; the Watch and Ward Society even banned The Plastic Age in Boston.\n\nBrown dismissed Percy Marks that year, presumably because he offended its stern Baptist president.\n\nHe married, moved to New Haven and wrote several best-selling novels, none so influential as The Plastic Age. Late in life he returned to teaching at the University of Connecticut for a few years. Percy Marks died in 1956.\n\nThis story last updated in 2023.\n\nLillian Gilbreth hated the best-selling book written about her in 1948 because it depicted her as a sweet, stay-at-home mom who deferred to her husband.\n\nCheaper By the Dozen, written by two of her 12 children, described how she and her husband used time-and-motion principles to manage their large household. They figured out the most efficient way to take a bath – and had the children listen to language lessons on the Victrola while doing so. They even incorporated recordkeeping into the daily routine, requiring the children to initial process charts showing they had bathed, brushed their teeth, made their beds and combed their hair.\n\nWhat Cheaper By the Dozen failed to show was that family life was just an extension of Lillian Gilbreth’s professional life. She and her husband ran an engineering firm, and together wrote hundreds of articles, published eight books, ran courses on industrial management and wrote many, many professional papers. Lillian Gilbreth was actually one of the most influential women of her age.\n\nWhen her husband Frank died of a heart attack at the age of 42, Lillian Gilbreth turned her attention to the domestic space, where she sought to reduce the drudgery of household chores. Her goal was to help other working mothers find more time for leisure and creativity. She called those moments ‘happiness minutes.’\n\nLillian Gilbreth\n\nLillian Moller Gilbreth was born on May 24, 1878 in Oakland Calif., the second of 11 children. Both her father, William Moller, a well-to-do merchant, and her wealthy mother Annie Delger, were of German descent.\n\nLillian Gilbreth was well-educated for her time, and graduated from the University of California at Berkeley in 1900 with a bachelor’s degree in English. She was the college’s first female commencement speaker. She started on her master’s degree in English at Columbia University, but fell sick and returned to California. In 1902 at the University of California she finished her master’s degree in English, but by then her interest was turning to psychology.\n\nIn 1903, she dropped out of graduate school and embarked on a tour of Europe with friends. They stopped in Boston, where she met a charismatic building contractor named Frank Gilbreth. Sixteen months later they were married at her parents’ home in Oakland.\n\nLillian gave birth about every 15 months, in between moves from California to New York to Providence to New Jersey, with summers on Nantucket. Together Frank and Lillian Gilbreth had 13 children; one daughter was stillborn and another died of diphtheria at the age of five.\n\nFrank Gilbreth\n\nFrank, a poor student, had never gone to college and started his career as a bricklayer’s apprentice. He became fixated on the single most efficient way to lay bricks. He learned about other aspects of building and contracting as well, taking night school courses on mechanical drawing.\n\nFrank rose rapidly at a large construction firm, patented several inventions and then quit to start his own company. When he married Lillian, they founded a management consulting firm that studied employees’ work habits and recommended ways to make their jobs easier and more efficient. His specialty was time-and-motion management, while hers was educational psychology.\n\nIn 1912 their consulting firm won a contract to introduce scientific management to the New England Butt Co., a hinge maker, in Providence, R.I.\n\nHome Laboratory\n\nThere, Lillian Gilbreth was able to earn her doctorate in psychology from Brown, and she and Frank turned their home near the university into a laboratory for motion study.\n\nThe Gilbreths took photos of their children doing dishes to figure out how to do it faster. They spent a vacation on Nantucket finding the best way to pack soap for Lever Brothers. The children learned Morse code after Frank painted the symbols on their walls and ceilings. He left funny messages in code for them to decipher.\n\nIn their work, Frank and Lillian Gilbreth pioneered ways to incorporate psychology in industrial planning. They introduced such concepts as work breaks, improved lighting, suggestion boxes and free books. They did research into fatigue management, the forerunner to ergonomics.\n\nIn 1919, the Gilbreths moved to Montclair, N.J. Frank died five years later of a heart attack. She outlived him – and succeeded on her own – for 48 years.\n\nOn Her Own\n\nLillian Gilbreth continued the consulting firm, but turned her attention to housework and home management. She thought that gave her the best chance of success on her own. She did marketing and management research for Johnson & Johnson and Macy’s. And she consulted with Katharine Gibbs and helped IBM develop an exhibit for the 1933 Chicago World’s Fair.\n\nShe is credited with developing the modern kitchen, conceiving the ‘work triangle.’ She also invented the foot pedal trash can, refrigerator door shelves and wall light switches.\n\nLillian Gilbreth had a long friendship with Herbert Hoover and his wife Lou. She campaigned for Herbert Hoover and headed the President’s Emergency Committee for Employment in 1930. At Lou Hoover’s request, she became a consultant and director to the Girl Scouts. She also did work for the federal government through the Truman Administration.\n\nAcademia\n\nOn top of all that, Lillian Gilbreth was a visiting professor at Purdue and the University of Wisconsin. She lectured at many other colleges. At the age of 86 she became resident lecturer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nLillian Gilbreth retired in 1968, just before turning 90. She died Jan. 2, 1972, in Phoenix, Ariz.\n\nCheaper By The Dozen, still in print, made the best-seller list. It was also made into a film, a stage play and a musical.\n\nYou can still see the New England Butt Company building at 304 Pearl St., where the Gilbreths pioneered the first process flow charts and micromotion studies. At Brown University, Lillian obtained her PhD in Applied Management. The family lived a half block from Brown, first at 71, then at 77 Brown Street. The Gilbreths’ Nantucket cottage, which had two buglights on the property, was on the extension of Hulbert Avenue behind the Jetties Beach tennis courts. This story was updated in 2023.\n\nA historic observatory in New England could be a stone remnant on the Canadian border, a mountaintop clubhouse or a state-of-the-art, NASA-funded astronomy compound at Harvard University.\n\nAstronomy has been important to the United States since it was founded. The new country lacked accurate maps, a vexing problem for mariners and military planners. Astronomical observations established latitude and longitude – and hence good maps – in the early 19th century.\n\nIn New England, astronomy has always been open to talented amateurs. Though most stargazing takes place on university campuses with equipment from wealthy donors or the government,…\n\nAmateur stargazers have plenty of opportunities to watch the partial solar eclipse on Aug. 21, 2017. Some are at or near the historic observatories described below. If you know of another historic observatory in New England, please mention it in the comments section.\n\nLeitner Family Observatory\n\nOver the centuries Yale’s role in astronomy has teetered from leadership to also-ran. In 1807, Yale professor Benjamin Silliman founded meteorite science when he determined the Weston Meteorite was a rock that fell from space.\n\nYale established its first observatory in 1830, when Sheldon Clark donated the largest refractor in the United States. For the next decade, Yale was the country’s top institution for astronomy. In 1835, for example, the first American sighting of Halley’s Comet was made from the Yale observatory.\n\nYale fell behind in astronomy by the 1850s, but in the late 19th century William Elkin further advanced meteor science by accurately measuring the speed of meteors from the observatory. The building was demolished in 1893.\n\nA new observatory, the Loomis Tower, was built in 1923 and named for Yale mathematician Elias Loomis. It had the largest polar telescope in America, but the telescope was moved to Bethany, Conn., in 1957. In 2008 the Yale observatory was renamed the Leitner Family Observatory, presumably after a gift from Austrian billionaire Wolfgang Leitner.\n\nThe observatory hosts a planetarium show every Tuesday evening. Afterward, its telescopes are open for viewing planets, star clusters and nebulae. It will also be open at 1 pm on Aug. 21 for viewing the partial solar eclipse.\n\n355 Prospect St., New Haven, Conn.\n\nCalais Observatory\n\nAll that remains of the Calais Observatory in Calais, Maine are two granite stones upon which scientific equipment was mounted more than 150 years ago.\n\nThe historic observatory dates to the mid-1800s and was in ruin by the late 1890s. Located in Meridian Park, on the grounds of the former Calais Academy, the observatory played an important role in putting Calais on the map – literally. The United States undertook a coast survey in 1830 to map and establish precise longitude and latitude coordinates for locations throughout the country. The Calais Observatory was built as part of that effort.\n\nVisitors today will know it only by the two stone pillars that remain and a NOAA plaque commemorating its historic significance.\n\nNorth and Lincoln Streets, Calais, Maine\n\nMaria Mitchell Observatories\n\nMaria Mitchell discovered a comet from a rooftop in Nantucket in 1847 and became the first woman astronomer in the United States. She went on to found the astronomy department at Vassar College. After her death in 1889, her niece, Lydia Hinchman, wanted to continue her legacy. She founded the Maria Mitchell Association, which in 1908 built an historic observatory on Vestal Street in Nantucket to house the 5-inch telescope given to Mitchell in 1859.\n\nHinchman wanted the observatory to do real astronomy as well as educate the public. She consulted a professor from Harvard, preeminent in astronomy since Samuel Williams went behind British lines to watch a solar eclipse in 1780. Hinchman was advised to install a photographic telescope and hire an astronomer to specialize in photographing asteroids with variable brightness. The professor’s assistant, Margaret Harwood, was chosen for the job, which she kept for 45 years. Harwood analyzed 419 variable stars in the Milky Way over 50 years, published a catalogue of 74 asteroids and discovered an unusual variable star called DF Cygni.\n\nA second observatory, Loines, was built in 1968 and 1998. Its two domes house a refurbished antique 8-inch Clark telescope and a new 24-inch research telescope.\n\nThe observatory offers summer internships for undergraduates and many educational programs for the public, including a solar eclipse party on Aug. 21, 2017.\n\nMaria Mitchell observatories, 3 Vestal St. and 59 Milk St., Nantucket, Mass.\n\nShattuck Observatory\n\nThe Shattuck Observatory, part of Dartmouth College, traces its roots to 1854 when it was constructed with funds from the college and Dr. George G. Shattuck, Class of 1803.\n\nThe historic observatory is the oldest science building on the college’s campus. The observatory’s most famous director was astronomer Edwin Brant Frost, who became a pioneering physics researcher.\n\nToday the observatory is relatively simple compared to state-of-the art telescopes, but it is still used for instruction. Part of the facility, which is located on Observatory Road, is opened for public viewing on Friday nights during the college’s summer term.\n\nThe historic observatory will not be the site of public eclipse viewing at the college. Students and members of the public are invited to the college Green from 1:15 to 4 p.m. on August 21 to take part in an eclipse viewing gathering. The physics department will have safe telescopes and eclipse-viewing glasses to share.\n\n15 Observatory Rd., Hanover, N.H.\n\nLadd Observatory\n\nSelf-taught astronomer Benjamin West observed the transit of Venus on June 3, 1769 at Brown (then Rhode Island College), long before the Ladd observatory opened in 1891. West’s observation gained international attention and won him honorary degrees from Harvard and Brown.\n\nPlanetary transits became the specialty of the Ladd Observatory, named for Rhode Island’s two-term governor, Herbert Ladd, who donated the money for the building.\n\nIt also sent out time signals, but discovered in 1973 that no one was listening so it ended the practice.\n\nThe historic observatory was originally located at the highest point in Providence, known as Tin-Top Hill (supposedly because it was a dumping ground for tin cans). Then the border of Providence changed, so it’s now on the second highest point in the city.\n\nH.P. Lovecraft had access to the observatory between 1906 and 1918 and wrote astronomy articles for Providence newspapers about his studies there.\n\nToday, the Ladd Observatory is a museum listed on the National Register of Historical Places. It is closed in August 2017, but will be reopened to the public on Tuesdays from 8-10 pm, weather permitting, beginning Aug. 29, 2017.\n\nTo watch the partial solar eclipse on Aug. 21, there will be portable solar telescopes beginning at 1 pm on the Brown University Main Green, weather permitting.\n\n210 Doyle Ave., Providence, R.I.\n\nStellafane\n\nStellafane, Latin for shrine to the stars, is a hot-pink clubhouse on the summit of Breezy Hill in Springfield, Vt. It was built by amateur telescope makers in the early 1920s. A local hardware store owner was said to have donated the hot-pink paint.\n\nSince 1926, amateur astronomers and telescope makers gather for the Stellafane Convention on the property, now a National Historic Landmark. Today it is the longest running astronomical convention in the world, attracting thousands of amateur telescope markers from all over the world. The convention is usually held over the weekend of the new moon closest to the height of the Perseid meteor shower. In 2017, it was held a month early because so many attendees were heading south and west to watch the total solar eclipse.\n\nStellafane started on Aug. 12, 1920, when artist and explorer Russell Porter held a class on how to make telescopes. Porter worked for a machine company nearby; of the 14 men who attended, most worked for the company. The lone woman was a schoolteacher. Porter taught the class how to make Newtonian telescopes, and they decided to form a club.\n\nAn asteroid has been named after Stellafane, and craters on the moon and Mars after Porter, who helped build the Hale Telescope at Palomar Observatory, then the world’s largest.\n\nJordan Road, Springfield, Vt.\n\nImages: Leitner Family Observatory By Daderot. – Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=1853907; Loines Observatory By Versageek – Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=4793051; Calais Observatory By Magicpiano – Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=28026705; Ladd Observatory By Michael L.

They evolved during the 18th century into places for the practice and teaching of medicine by trained professionals. Nurses, like Louisa May Alcott, for a long time had little or no formal training.\n\nOver time, hospitals became centers of medical innovation and research. They developed specialties and affiliated with medical schools. During the 19th century, lunatic asylums sprang up to take care of mentally ill people outside the family.\n\nAfter the Civil War, the number of hospitals grew rapidly in the United States, to 4,400 by 1910. They got larger, cleaner and more professional.\n\nNew England’s oldest hospitals reflect that evolution. One early hospital gave wine to poor people. One took in the insane. A woman who also wrote hymns started one. And one of the oldest hospitals has a unit named after a woman who gave birth to a president in another of the oldest hospitals.\n\nHere, then, are six of the oldest hospitals in New England, one in each state.\n\nState Hospital, New Haven\n\nThe old State Hospital is Connecticut’s first and boasts many other firsts. It published the first nursing textbook in 1879, produced the first x-ray in the United States in 1896 and used chemotherapy as a cancer treatment for the first time ever in 1942. It also, for the first time in the U.S., allowed healthy newborns to stay in their mothers’ rooms in 1946. Barbara Bush, by the way, gave birth there to future U.S. President George W. Bush that year. In 1975, Lyme disease was identified and named at Yale-New Haven Hospital.\n\nNow called Yale-New Haven Hospital, it was founded in 1826 by the General Hospital Society of Connecticut. It opened in rented quarters, but founders raised enough money by 1833 to build the 13-bed State Hospital designed by Ithiel Town. East and west wings were added.\n\nDuring the Civil War, the U.S. government leased the building for use as a military hospital. Fifteen hundred beds were set up in the building and in tents on the grounds to treat 25,000 U.S. Army soldiers during the war. Yale-New Haven Hospital has been designated a military hospital in every subsequent war.\n\nThe Yale-New Haven Hospital is not only one of the oldest hospitals in the country, it is one of the biggest. Today it has a 1,541-bed hospital, the 168-bed Smilow Cancer Hospital, the 201-bed Yale New Haven Children’s Hospital and the 76-bed Yale New Haven Psychiatric Hospital. It also serves as the teaching hospital for Yale School of Medicine and Yale School of Nursing.\n\nMaine General Hospital\n\nMaine Medical Center in Portland is now the largest hospital in Northern New England. It has 637 beds serving Maine, parts of Vermont and New Hampshire. It was founded as the Maine General Hospital through the efforts of the Maine Medical Society and the state Legislature. Now it serves as a teaching hospital affiliated with four university medical schools.\n\nDoctors founded the Maine Medical Association 20 years earlier to quash the practice of homeopathic and alternative medicines. The group also had concerns about the lack of a general hospital in Maine. The Legislature granted land and funds for the institution, which opened its doors in 1874.\n\nMaine’s doctors had lobbied for the Maine General Hospital. A Maine Medical Association founder, Dr. Gilman Davies, pronounced, ‘the Maine General Hospital is the child of the Maine Medical Association.’\n\nLike the Yale-New Haven Hospital, the Maine Medical Center has a connection to the Bush family: the Barbara Bush Children’s Hospital. Once the teaching hospital for Bowdoin College, it now has affiliations with Dartmouth, St. Joseph’s, Tufts and the University of Southern Maine medical schools.\n\nThe Boston Dispensary\n\nOne of the five oldest hospitals in the country, the Boston Dispensary was founded in 1796, 60 years after the start of Bellevue Hospital in New York and Charity Hospital in New Orleans.\n\nThe Dispensary was New England’s first hospital, and it took care of poor people. It was founded by Boston’s civic leaders, including Paul Revere and Sam Adams. Oliver Wendell Holmes received his medical training there, as did other prominent physicians such as James Jackson and Henry Bowditch.\n\nDoctors took care of patients at the Dispensary in Boston’s South End or in their homes, and gave them medicine and wine, if they felt it necessary. Clinics were established throughout the city, and eventually so was an evening clinic for the working poor, which was partially funded by employers.\n\nSubscribers supported the Dispensary by paying $5 a year for a ticket, which entitled them to recommend two patients to its care. The Massachusetts Historical Society has a ticket signed by Paul Revere.\n\nThe Boston Dispensary over the years affiliated with other medical institutions, including Boston’s Floating Hospital for Children, Tufts University’s medical and dental schools and the Pratt Diagnostic Clinic. In 1968 those affiliations became formal in a merger resulting in Tufts New England Medical Center, now Tufts Medical Center.\n\nPortsmouth Cottage Hospital\n\nPortsmouth Cottage Hospital admitted its first patients in 1884, nearly a century after the Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical School opened its doors in 1797.\n\nHarriet Kimball, the daughter of a Portsmouth pharmacist, provided the drive to start Portsmouth Cottage Hospital. She also published poetry and hymns. Kimball founded the hospital as a charity, with some funding from the City of Portsmouth.\n\nThe hospital opened in the large house in which a famous writer, Thomas Bailey Aldrich, once lived. That house now belongs to the Strawbery Banke Museum complex.\n\nIn 1989, five years after Portsmouth Cottage Hospital opened, fundraising for a proper hospital building began. A 2-1/2 story brick building opened in 1895 and expanded until 1962. That year, the hospital moved to a new building next door.\n\nIn 1983, the for-profit hospital chain Health Corporation of America bought it and opened a new campus. HCA renamed it Portsmouth Regional Hospital. HCA since settled fraud charges with the U.S. government totaling $2 billion, then the largest fraud settlement in history.\n\nConcord Hospital, also founded in 1884, still serves as a charitable hospital. It started with a gift of $60,000 from George Pillsbury, father of Pillsbury Co. co-founder Charles Pillsbury. George named it Mary Pillsbury Hospital as a 50th wedding anniversary gift to his wife. It admitted its first patients in 1891.\n\nButler Hospital, Providence\n\nRhode Island’s first hospital has the unusual distinction of being a psychiatric hospital. Butler Hospital for the Insane was founded in 1844 with a donation from industrialist Cyrus Butler. It also received financial support from Nicholas Brown, Jr.\n\nThe hospital’s first superintendent, Dr. Isaac Ray, toured the asylums of Europe before Butler received its first patients in 1847. Ray reported his findings in Europe in the American Journal of Insanity. People now consider him a founder of forensic psychiatry.\n\nToday, Butler Hospital is affiliated with Brown’s Warren Alpert Medical School. It also serves as the flagship of the university’s acclaimed department of psychiatry.\n\nIf you thought Rhode Island’s first general hospital would be a philanthropic project of the Brown family, you would be right. Rhode Island Hospital started with a bequest from Nicholas Brown, Jr.’s nephew, Moses Brown Ives.\n\nThe hospital was officially dedicated on Oct. 1, 1868.\n\nMary Fletcher Hospital, Burlington, Vt.\n\nThe first hospital in Vermont opened its doors in 1879 in Burlington, thanks to the generosity of Mary Fletcher.\n\nMary was born in Jericho, Vt., to Thadeus and Mary Fletcher in 1830. Thadeus was a successful businessman who left a fortune when he died. Young Mary was the last of the family’s five children, and by 1876 she had outlived her siblings and her parents. Though she suffered from tuberculosis, Mary, who was never married, worked to complete the philanthropic dreams of her parents.\n\nDeploying the family’s wealth she established the Fletcher Free Library and the Mary Fletcher Training School for Nurses. Working with her doctor, Walter Carpenter, she spent more than $200,000 buying land and constructing and equipping the Mary Fletcher Hospital, which she named after her mother. She would die in the hospital, in 1885.\n\nThe hospital has merged with other institutions over the years, but part of the original hospital is still working today as part of the University of Vermont Medical Center.\n\nThis story was updated in 2022."
