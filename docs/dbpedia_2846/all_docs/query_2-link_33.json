        "text": "BROWN, Jr., Eugene (Gene) R., age 78, of Kettering, OH passed away on March 5, 2024. Gene was born on January 12, 1946, to Eugene R. and Mary M. (Hunkeler) Brown in Dayton, OH.\n\nHe graduated from Chaminade High School in 1964, he attended the University of Dayton for a short time, then joined the United States Navy as a Photographer’s Mate and Air Crew Member. After discharge, he worked at WHIO-TV as a commercial photographer from 1968-1977. Gene made a career change in 1977 when he became an investigator at the Montgomery County Coroner’s Office. He retired in 2002 as chief investigator after 33 years of service.\n\nGene was a man of many interests. He became a certified wildlife rehabilitator specializing in the rescue of orphaned raccoons and squirrels. He raced inboard hydroplanes as a member of the Dayton Motorboat Racing Association. He also became a hot air balloon pilot, flying with members of the Dayton Lighter-Than-Air Society. More excitement included the Dayton Buckeye Model A Ford Club (of course he had 2 Model A’s), Vintage Iron Motorcycle Club (yes! he had those too). Rounding out activities was competing photographically in the Tripod Camera Club and playing accordion at the Carillon Brewery during Friday lunch hours. This is the short list of his amazing life."
