        "text": "DURHAM - Ruby Luquire Brown, 99, died Sunday, February 19, 2017, at her home in Duke Park where she had lived since 1948. Mrs. Brown was born in Durham and was the daughter of the late Eugene A. Luquire and Cleo Small Luquire. She was preceded ineeath by her husband of 57 years, Charles Vertis Brown, and two brothers, Eugene Luquire and Algie Luquire. She is survived by her children, Councilman Charles V. Brown, Jr., and his wife, Suzanne, of Denver, CO, Councilman Eugene A. Brown, and his wife, Signe, of Durham, NC, and Bonee B. Hood of Topsail Beach, NC; brother, David Luquire, of Burgaw, NC; grandchildren, Braxton Hood, Richard Hood (Erika), Brian Brown, Christine Johnson (Bradley), Cody Brown, and Nicholas Brown; great grandchildren, Lennon Browneeleanor and Nolan Johnson. Mrs. Brown was educated in the Durham public schools. She was employed as a bookkeeper for Baldwin???s Department Store in Durham as well as being a homemaker. Ruby was a member of St. Paul???s Uneed Methodist Church. She had been an active member of the Exchangette Womens Club. For many years she voluneered at the Red Cross Blood Drive and was an election precinct worker. She also enjoyed fishing and family gatherings at Topsail Beach. Perhaps it was one of her granddaughters, Christine Johnson, who summed her up best: ???On Sunday afternoon, I said goodbye to my grandmother. She passed away peacefully at 99, in the home that her husband built for her in Duke Park. Ruby Brown was a force. She made and accepted neexcuses for herself or anyoneelse. She loved dancing, the beach, and cooking with her family. She valued hard work, meaningful conversation and honesty. She said exactly what was oneer mind and always stood up for what she believed in. I treasure all the memories I have with Nonee, she was an ineedibly proud, strong woman filled with kineess, compassion, love aneempathy\" The family would like to thank her wonderful caregivers, Daisy Thomas, Phyllis Burrell and Janella Wilson. We are also extremely grateful to Ruby???s niece, Joan Luquire, who gave her so much love and care as well as her daughter-in-law, Signe, and granddaughter Christine. Ruby would have been 100 years old in 5 months. She lived a long, rich and fulfilling life and will be missed. Mrs. Brown???s remains will be cremated and interred at St. Paul???s Uneed Methodist Church."
