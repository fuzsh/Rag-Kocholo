        "text": "Paul Ross Eberst Jr. of Warren passed away after a short illness on November 8, 2019 at the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nPaul was born in Columbus, Ohio October 8, 1945 to Katherine Elizabeth McCann and Paul Ross Eberst.\n\nHe grew up in Columbus attending St. Christopher Elementary and graduating from St. Thomas Aquinas High School. Paul enjoyed good friends and his many cousins. He loved football and was raised on Woody Hayes and the Ohio State Buckeyes as well as Jim Brown and the Cleveland Browns. He remained loyal to that upbringing throughout his life. He also enjoyed being out on the water and boating on the Ohio River.\n\nAfter graduating from High School, he moved to Warren. He worked as a bartender and eventually for Klaben Ford where he was affectionately known as Pauly. He was respected at work and always willing to help not only his customers, but the people he worked with. He considered himself “technologically challenged” and with humor appreciated help in remembering his passwords. He retired from Klaben in January of this year.\n\nPaul is survived by his daughter Heather, who was the joy of his life. He loved sharing stories of Heather’s travels and adventures. He was most proud to share with everyone her engagement earlier this year. Along with visiting Heather and sitting on the beach, Paul was happiest returning to Columbus to spend time with his family.\n\nIn addition to his daughter Heather Ho (Michael) he is survived by his sister, Laura Nadolny (Ted) and brother, Carl Eberst (Rhonda) as well as nieces, nephews and other family members. His passing left a void in our hearts. We love him and we will miss him."
