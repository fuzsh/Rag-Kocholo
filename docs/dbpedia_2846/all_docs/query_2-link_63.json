        "text": "Nicholas Brown,\n\nBefore either of the replica sailing ships came to town this summer, a little bloodhound of a ship named Rude (pronounced, Rudy) called at Portsmouth's State Pier. While Providence and the Jeanie Johnston pull our gaze upward at their towering rigs and backward at centuries passed, Rude is all about seeing in the opposite direction: down, into the once invisible depths beneath the ocean's mute, reflecting surface.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) hydrographic survey ship Rude had a quiet stay in Portsmouth. The 90-foot Rude and her crew of four officers and seven \"wage-marine employees\" (federaleze for \"Crew\") were in the area to complete underwater survey work at the harbor entrance. Collecting data about the shape and depth of the inshore sea-bed is a large part of her mission, but is by no means the only part.\n\n\"We're good at finding stuff,\" said the Rude's commanding officer, Lt. Cmdr. Tod Schattgen, matter-of-factly.\n\nThis tightly-packed, immaculately maintained ship and her crew have found all sorts of things. In addition to pinpointing previously uncharted reefs and ledges, and finding shipping channels skewed by violent storms, it was the Rude that located the rock struck by the liner Queen Elizabeth II in Vineyard Sound. It was also the Rude that located the wreckage of TWA Flight 800 off of Long Island and John F. Kennedy Jr.?s aircraft off Martha's Vineyard.\n\nSonar is the eye the Rude and her crew use to see what has, until recently, been locked and lost in murky mystery since ... well, forever. Charting is a science, and the array of engineering and science degrees held by most members of the Rude's crew reflect the technology now brought to bear in the art of underwater mapping.\n\n\"Basically, we're a ship of button mashers,\" said Lt. Cmdr Schattgen, who has a degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Missouri (yes, he's a long way from home) and has been with NOAA for 17 years.\n\nA concerted effort at mapping this country was begun by Thomas Jefferson, according Lt. Cmdr. Scattgen. The Continental army did survey work on land and was asked if it could use the same trigonometry used to produce maps to make nautical charts. That question led to the formation of what was known as the Coast and Geodetic Survey (CGS), from which NOAA evolved in 1970. Geodetic refers to earth-centered measurements, according to Lt. Todd Haupt, Rude's executive officer (XO).\n\nThe tools used to make charts in Jefferson's time - a weighted-line and sextant - hadn't changed much until the advent of sonar in the middle 20th century. In an unending effort to find and destroy each other, both submarines and submarine-hunting surface ships carried single beam sonar during World War II - similar to the depth-finders found on most pleasure boats today. Side-scan sonar came along in the 1980s. It sees a much wider swath of bottom than the single beam pulse. Side-scan sonar is used primarily in bottom searches, looking for wrecks and large things lost, like machinery washed off a barge in a channel.\n\nThe Rude's crew uses multi-beam sonar, the most advanced type now, for their hydrographic survey work. This technology uses 120 sounding beams and creates an almost three-dimensional image of the bottom in astounding detail. While looking at an image of yet another airplane nose-down on the bottom of Long Island Sound, the lobster traps plopped unknowingly around it were crystal clear, complete with sonar shadows that gave the whole scene, pitch-black though it actually was underwater, a late-afternoon look on the computer screen.\n\nComputers are the other part of the equation that adds up to useful data, and the Rude is full of them. The sonar sees, of course, but what it sees must be interpreted first by computers and then by trained human eyes. This ship and crew's unique capability is \"our ability to sort through the data,\" said Lt. Cmdr. Schattgen.\n\nTheir mission is to \"acquire, digest, correlate, process, and finally communicate data,\" said Lt. Haupt, \"and to compile it into something useable. The nose-down airplane - \"They're usually nose-down. It's the weight of the engine\" - just looked like a \"something\" the first time the Rude towed its torpedo-like \"fish\" over it at seven-knots. The crew thought, \"Hmmm, what's this?\" So they turned the ship around for another pass. It was only when the angle was just right that the strange shape suddenly became the unmistakable silhouette of an aircraft standing on its head.\n\nWhile the tools for charting have changed dramatically, the need for experienced eyes to interpret collected data remains. In addition to savvy computer specialists, the Rude also carries divers aboard. \"Sometimes we have to put an eyeball on it,\" said the captain.\n\nIf shipboard technicians cannot identify something painted by sonar, divers are sent down to visually inspect the thing.\n\nWhen the Rude departed Portsmouth - just prior to Providence's arrival - she steamed down to Portland, Maine, to search for a 39 cubic-yard dredge bucket lost off a barge last winter near that busy harbor's entrance. The U.S. Coast Guard asked NOAA to assist in this search because the private firm hired by the dredging company to find the massive bucket was unsuccessful. The Coast Guard had to be certain that the lost bucket posed no danger to ships entering Portland's shipping channel.\n\nThe Rude located what it thought was the bucket with her side-scan sonar on the first day of the search, but the crew could not be sure, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that their contact was in fact the bucket in question - there's a lot of stuff down there.\n\n\"We go overboard on accuracy,? admitted Lt. Cmdr. Shattgen during our conversation in Portsmouth the week before. So the following day, the Rude's dive team was sent down to check out the sonar contact. It turned out to be the clam-shell bucket they were looking for, lying 64-feet down and posing no threat to safe navigation.\n\nNOAA's primary customers are ship pilots and other commercial deep-draft mariners for whom precise charted depths can make a world, and millions of dollars, of difference. In some ports, a difference of one-foot of available depth can make or break the economic viability of certain bulk transport companies.\n\nModern nautical charts are the product of a partnership of government agencies with the common goal of providing the means for the safe navigation of U.S. waters. The Army Corps of Engineers is responsible for dredging and maintaining federal channels. The Coast Guard is responsible for aids to navigation (buoys) in those waters - (among a host of other responsibilities, of course). Using ships like the Rude and smart crews, NOAA produces and constantly updates about 1,000 charts to cover the coast of the United States today.\n\nWhen the Rude finds something that mariners should know about immediately, that information is relayed to the Coast Guard and can be broadcast over the marine radio in a matter of hours. The Coast Guard would also publish the information in a Local Notice to Mariners so that a vessel's navigator can update onboard charts. Less pressing new information discovered by NOAA's fleet of survey ships is incorporated into the appropriate charts? next edition annually.\n\nThe ocean may be the last earthly frontier, but it is still very much a frontier. Even with high-tech gadgets like Global Positioning Systems and electronic charts, navigation remains a science with many murky variables. The work being done by ships like the Rude and her crew put the voyages made by ships like the original Providence and Jeanie Johnston into sharper perspective.\n\nNicholas Brown is a free-lance journalist, boat carpenter, and Navy veteran."
