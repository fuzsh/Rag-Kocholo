        "text": "Historical note:\n\nThese papers all relate to the family of Sarah Helen (Power) Whitman (1803-1878), the renowned Providence poet and fiancé of Edgar Allen Poe. The bulk relate to her father's Power descendants, and her mother's immediate Marsh family. Whitman was an avid genealogist, and believed that her and Edgar Allen Poe shared an Irish royal ancestry through the \"Po'er\" family.\n\nAlthough Whitman had great pride in her Power ancestry, her relationship with her father was strained at best. He left Providence in 1813, when Sarah was only ten years old, and spent the next twenty years estranged from his wife and children, leaving them in difficult financial circumstances. He returned to Providence in 1835, but even then maintained a separate residence, which must have been a scandalous situation in the town's small community of elite families. Toward the end of his life, he became one of the closest associates of Thomas W. Dorr, the leader of the Dorr Rebellion of 1842, for which he served time in prison.\n\nNicholas Power Jr.'s parents were Nicholas Power (1742-1808) and Rebecca Cory, who had the following children:\n\nNicholas Power Jr. (see below)\n\nRebecca (d.1860), m. Joseph L. Tillinghast 1798.\n\nSarah, m. David R. Williams of South Carolina, 1796\n\nMary Ann (1777-1840), m. William Blodgett\n\nNicholas Power Jr. (1771-1844) married Anna Marsh in 1798. Their surviving children were:\n\nRebecca Matilda (1800-1825), m. William R. Staples, 1822. Had son William (1824-1829).\n\nSarah Helen (1803-1878), m. in 1828 John W. Whitman (1799-1833). No children.\n\nSusan Anna (1813-1877), never married.\n\nThe source of much of this information was a discussion with scholar Noelle Baker, who is working on a collected edition of Whitman's works. We can expect that her research will soon be published with accurate citations, superseding this present unreliable anecdotal account.\n\nReturn to top\n\nScope and content:\n\nThis collection includes genealogical records, family correspondence regarding land inheritance and other papers. Sarah Helen Whitman, the renowned poet and Poe fiancé, compiled these papers and is represented by several letters addressed to her, as well as several genealogical pieces in her own hand.\n\nReturn to top\n\nProvenance:\n\nThis collection was apparently in the possession of Sarah Helen Power Whitman at the time of her death in 1878, as she was the last surviving member of her family. All of Whitman's papers then passed on to her literary executor and close friend, Mrs. Charlotte Dailey, who in turn left the papers to her two daughters Miss Charlotte K. Dailey and Maude Dailey Chace. They donated this small collection of Power family papers to the R.I.H.S. in 1909, but retained a larger collection of Whitman's personal papers, many relating to Edgar Allen Poe. These other papers were broken up and sold at a much later date; the bulk ended up at the University of Virginia and the John Hay Library at Brown University.\n\nReturn to top\n\nProcessing note:\n\nThis collection was pasted into a scrapbook circa 1910. The page numbers from the scrapbook are still used, although the items were removed and placed in individual folders circa 1975. The original numbering is erratic, so many folders can appear to be missing, but all items from the original accession list remain in the collection.\n\nReturn to top\n\nInventory:\n\nFolder 1.
