        "text": "age 71, passed away peacefully of natural causes at his home Sunday morning, March 29, 2020. He was born in Providence, RI on July 19, 1948 to the late Dante E. and Mary (Corsetti) Boffi. Dante leaves a loving wife, Suzanne Jean D’Arc (Champagne) Boffi. They were sweethearts for 50 years and married for 49 wonderful years. Dante was blessed with two children and four grandchildren. His son Dante J. Boffi and his wife Denice; his daughter Wendy M. (Boffi) Jivoin and her husband Jerome; his grandchildren Alessandra and Mia Boffi, Sofia and Jameson Jivoin. Dante is survived by his younger brother Dr. Bryan V. Boffi and his wife Donna and his three nephews Jonathan, Christopher and Nicholas. His three Brothers-in-law, Victor, Richard and Dennis and two Sisters-in-law, Helene and Louise, blessed him with many wonderful nieces and nephews, and still counting…\n\nDante earned his Bachelor’s Degree in Psychology at Brown University. He later earned a Masters Degree in Child Development and Family Relations and his Masters of Business Administration (MBA) from the University of Rhode Island. Dante was a leader in mental health innovations for the Department of Behavioral Healthcare, Developmental Disabilities and Hospitals. His talents were then used to lead the Providence River Relocation Project as Director of Transportation. He was a driving force for projects such as Providence Place Mall, Jamestown Bridge construction and enabled new hotels to be erected and events such as Waterfire to take place in the city that he loved. Dante closed out his career at the Department of Administration and continued to shape the State of Rhode Island for the better. Dante was also a member of the Knights of Columbus of Warwick Rhode Island.\n\nDante was a devoted family man and his wife; his children and grandchildren were his entire world. He exposed his family to places, people and cultures that have enriched their minds and souls. Dante loved to travel and his adventures with Suzie and the family are the stuff of legend. His big heart and beautiful mind will be missed but never forgotten. Thank you for sharing your Wonderful Life with us.\n\nA private service will be held at NARDOLILLO FUNERAL HOME & Crematory in Cranston Rhode Island for immediate family. A Celebration of Life will be held to honor Dante once the world recovers from this virus. In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions may be made to St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, 501 St. Jude Place, Memphis, TN 38105."
