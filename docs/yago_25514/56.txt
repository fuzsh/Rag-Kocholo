After the liberation the King could not return to Belgium with his family because of the so-called Royal Question. This had to due with the fact that Leopold III had refused to go into exile with his government when the Germans invaded Belgium. He remained in Switzerland until 1950 (photo left: Prince Boudewijn, Prince Alexander and Prince Albert).

Leopold III was not popular with the Belgian people, and they never forgave him for marrying Lilian Baels after the untimely death of his first wife the beloved Queen Astrid, mother of the late King Boudewijn and the current King Albert.

After the return of Leopold III to Belgium the King was to relinquish his right to the throne in favour of his eldest son Boudewijn.

Prince Alexander studied medicine for a couple of years but ended up going into trade. In the 1960s his predilection for fast cars and speeding caused many a headache for his half-brother King Boudewijn.

But Prince Alexander reconciled with the royal family and regularly attended official events.

In 1991 Prince Alexander married LÃ©a Wolman. They kept their marriage secret for seven years because Princess Lilian, Alexander's mother, was against the relationship. The couple had no children.

Prince Alexander died Sunday afternoon from an acute pulmonary embolism.
