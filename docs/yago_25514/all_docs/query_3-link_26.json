        "text": "The Jordanian royal wedding proved to be a power summit for international royals. Kings, queens, princes and princesses from around the world gathered in the grounds of Zahran Palace in Amman to witness Crown Prince Hussein of Jordan, the eldest son of King Abdullah II and Queen Rania, marry glamorous Saudi Arabian architect Rajwa Al Saif.\n\nKing Philippe of Belgium was joined by his daughter and heir, Princess Elisabeth, who is studying at the University of Oxford. King Willem-Alexander and Queen Máxima of the Netherlands were at their elegant best, while Queen Margrethe II of Denmark was represented by her son and daughter-in-law the-then Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary.\n\nRead More\n\nThe Princess of Wales sparkles in rose pink Jenny Packham at Jordanian royal wedding banquet\n\nThe Prince and Princess of Wales bowed and curtsied to King Abdullah II and Queen Rania of Jordan as they arrived alongside other royals for the lavish banquet at Al Husseiniya Palace, following Crown Prince Hussein’s marriage ceremony\n\nAmong the more surprising guests was Queen Jetsun of Bhutan, who was joined by her sister-in-law Princess Euphelma. The queen recently joined her husband at the Coronation of King Charles III and Queen Camilla, but the Bhutanese royal couple aren’t known for jet-setting. The Sultan of Brunei was accompanied by his son Prince Mateen of Brunei, considered one of the world’s most eligible royal bachelors, who, like the groom, studied at Sandhurst.\n\nThe British Royal Family was represented by the Prince and Princess of Wales, and Princess Beatrice and Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi. The royals did not announce their attendance in advance, perhaps in a bid not to overshadow the bride and groom on their wedding day. William and Kate and Beatrice and Edoardo all stayed for the glittering evening reception that followed, with the princesses both donning diamond diadems in honour of the occasion.\n\nAs the glow of the wedding begins to fade, Tatler celebrates some of the most memorable royal guests."
