        "text": "Anthony Ritossa\n\nAnthony Ritossa\n\nChairman, Ritossa Family Office & Founder of Ritossa Global Family Office Investment Summits\n\nPublished Dec 4, 2019\n\nUnder the High Patronage of His Highness Sheikh Ahmed Al Maktoum, with gratitude to Mohamed Al Ali Distinguished Grand Ambassador for the 10th Anniversary Ritossa Global Family Office Investment Summit.\n\n“World’s Largest & Most Exclusive Gathering of Family Wealth, Representing US$4.5 Trillion Investor Wealth Convened to Discuss the Rise and Rise of Family Wealth.\" - Sir Anthony Ritossa\n\nSir Anthony Ritossa welcomed the presence of our 600+ global leading family offices and ultra-high net worth individuals. These included Royals, Sheikhs, Private Investment Companies and Sovereign Wealth Funds. With a representation of $4.5 trillion+ in investor wealth, our delegates gathered to discuss \"The Rise and Rise of Family Offices.\" Together they explored global opportunities, succession planning, philanthropy suggestions, and family governance.\n\nSir Anthony Ritossa hosted the first Summit's private workshop for families from the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) and overseas to share their family journeys, and how to best build a winning mindset entitled \"Growing Your Human Capital.\"\n\n“I believe that, fundamentally, we all want to be the best version of ourselves – within our families, our relationships with others and, ultimately, our wealth. There is a revolution unfolding on the balance sheets of the world’s corporations that holds a lesson for families with wealth: The Explosion of Intangible Assets. I am very pleased to have kick-started the first of many similar workshops to come.”- Sir Anthony Ritossa\n\nA decade ago, the most business-savvy conferences of the season in Dubai were always the Hedge Fund related events. Now and in its place, Sir Anthony Ritossa's Summits are genuinely the \"World's Largest & Most Exclusive Gathering of Family Wealth.\"\n\nThese gatherings aimed squarely at the new masters of the universe, the private investment offices, are held in an environment of grounded affinity, unique to Sir Anthony Ritossa.\n\n\"There's an understanding that those with the most resources have the most responsibility for improving the world. For this reason, I carefully curate my own private Family Office events attracting similar-minded prestigious families from all over the world. I spend a lot of time getting to know our selected attendees. The waiting list is long, and I make sure that every participant is a perfect fit, that they share similar core values with the other members.\" - Sir Anthony Ritossa\n\nDelegate Soundbites\n\n“We would like to thank you for organizing such an amazing workshop and gathering of individuals.” - Francesco Lombardo, Veritage.\n\n“I would like to thank your organisation around our presence at the summit. We made a lot of valuable contacts and partnerships”. - Gergo Szoke, Centrum Circle.\n\n“Thank you, Anthony, for an outstanding gathering and for your support.” - Mimoun A. Assraoui, RIF TRUST.\n\n“Dear Anthony, Thank you so much for an absolutely incredible summit. The hotel was first class, the topics were outstanding and the people in attendance were among the most interesting I have ever met. It really is the best Family Office Conference I have ever attended.” - His Highness Prince Hermann of Leiningen, Royal Bank of Scotland.\n\n“Thanks for an incredible conference, really enjoyed meeting great people and speaking as well, thrilled to see the continued impressive growth of the ecosystem thanks to all your hard work.” - Aneel Ranadive, Somacap.\n\n“I enjoyed meeting many of your guests from diverse backgrounds and hear their unique perspectives on how they view the evolving business, and investment landscape. I must congratulate you, and your entire team for organizing and inspiring an immaculate event.” - Ambassador Javed Malik.\n\n“Thank you so much for organizing this great summit, please accept my sincere gratitude for lending your platform to discuss one of the worst and most prevalent crimes.” Dr Joanna Rubinstein, Childhood International.\n\n\"I just wanted to say what a fantastic event you held. I met some wonderful people there and will be working with many of them. Also, with quite a few I think we can help accomplish some of the UN goals and help charities further.\" Matt Hawkins, CUDO Ventures.\n\n\" I wanted to thank you again for your team’s hospitality and commend you on the quality of the venue, programming, speakers, and curation of attendees. I look forward to building relationships with a number of fellow family office investors and entrepreneurs that I had the privilege of connecting with over the course of my stay in Dubai.\" Sanin Mody, Ojas Capital, LP.\n\n\"I just wanted to send you a short note to thank you for your support and to congratulate you on a very successful event. Everyone I have spoken to was happy and fount it to be very useful.\" Sidney Wheatley, Private Office of H.H. Sheikh Mohamed bin Salman bin Abdulla bin Hamad Al-Khalifa from the Kingdom of Bahrain.\n\n\"Thank you so much for taking the time to organize and host the event in Dubai. To date we received interest from over a dozen investors who love the global Method Inc. play.\" Natalie Spencer-Clair, Method Homes.\n\n\"Congratulations and really well done to you and your team, in delivering an exceptional Global Family Summit. You can feel very proud of your achievements and you were all so very delightful and wonderful to work with.\" Ian Halliday, Consul General Dubai and General Manager, Middle East Africa.\n\nSir Anthony Ritossa embraces his 11th Global Family Office Investment Summit in Riyadh, March 23-25, 2020, excited with Saudi Arabia’s new economic direction; diversifying its economy away from oil, and applauding its growing private sector.\n\nHi-tech Transformation in Saudi Arabia\n\nAs the country continues on its path towards a brighter, more innovative future, it is clear that technological advances will play a key role in creating this new and improved Saudi Arabia. In the years to come, technology will revolutionise the way we do business in Saudi Arabia, with cutting-edge developments such as artificial intelligence (AI), robotics and biometric identification all changing the world of business as we know it.\n\nAs Saudi Arabia embraces the digital era, businesses cannot afford to fall behind the curve. Future success is already largely dependent on the early adoption of new technologies, and companies of all sizes will put digital innovation at the very heart of their operations if they wish to stay relevant going forward.\n\nKeeping it personal at Sir Anthony Ritossa’s Family Office Investment Summits\n\nWhile new technologies will prove critical to the future success of all businesses, large or small, we must not forget the importance of cultivating human relationships with our families and partners. It is for this reason that Sir Anthony Ritossa honours the value of bringing together similar-minded Thought Leadership in a private setting at the Ritz-Carlton, Riyadh March 23-25, 2020.\n\n\"It's a global gathering for like-minded leaders. Being part of a family office myself, understanding what is essential to families and corporations, and including this in the conference agenda, creates a unique environment and a lovely ambience.”- Sir Anthony Ritossa, Chairman, Ritossa Family Office, and Host of the Ritossa Summits\n\nPartnership Information\n\nPlease contact Vanessa Eriksson at vanessa@ritossafamilyoffice.com to enquire on partnerships tailor-made to your specific needs and requirements.\n\nEsteemed Riyadh Guests of Honour, and Speakers\n\n100+ Esteemed Guests of Honour, and Speakers from around the world, some of which include:\n\nH.R.H.
