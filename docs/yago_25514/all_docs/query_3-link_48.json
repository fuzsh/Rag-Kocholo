The Dutch Royal House previously confirmed that the Princess of Orange will “attend the festivities surrounding the wedding” with her parents Queen Maxima and King Willem-Alexander.\n\nQueen Rania and King Abdullah II of Jordan’s eldest son will marry his fiancée Rajwa on June 1. In addition to the Dutch and Belgian royals, Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary of Denmark, Crown Princess Victoria and Prince Daniel of Sweden and Crown Prince Haakon of Norway will be among the royal guests."
