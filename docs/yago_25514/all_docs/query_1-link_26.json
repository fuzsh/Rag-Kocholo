        "text": "Princess Delphine among Belgian royals attending Brussels event\n\nBelgium’s entire Royal Family were present at the Church of Our Lady of Laeken on Thursday morning for the annual mass ceremony held in memory of their lost loved ones. The sombre occasion marked the first time King Albert II, Queen Paola and Princess Delphine have appeared together in public.\n\nThose in attendance at the Notre-Dame de Laeken church included King Philippe, 61 – the eldest child of King Albert II – and his wife Queen Mathilde, 49.\n\nThey joined King Albert, 87, and Queen Paola, 84, to sit in the front row.\n\nKing Phillippe’s sister, Princess Astrid and her husband, Archduke Lorenz, also sat alongside them for the service.\n\nIn the second row sat King Phillippe’s younger brother Prince Laurent and his wife, Princess Claire.\n\nPrincess Lea - widow of Prince Alexander, son of King Leopold III and Lilian Baels – also attended the mass, alongside Princess Delphine, 53, and her husband James O'Hare.\n\nThe location of the service is particularly poignant as its crypt is where members of the Royal Family are buried.\n\nNormally the service that commemorates the lives of deceased members of royalty is attended by the most senior members of the Belgian Royal Family.\n\nThe tradition of paying tribute to the deceased members of the monarchy dates back to February 17, 1935.\n\nAt this time, a mass was held to commemorate the death of King Albert I, who had died a year earlier at Marche-les-Dames.\n\nREAD MORE: ‘Never say never!’ Prince Andrew COULD return to public life\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Read our Privacy Policy\n\nFollowing the death of Queen Astrid on August 29, 1935, it was decided tribute would be paid to all the deceased members of the Royal Family on February 17.\n\nDue to COVID-19 measures last year, the traditional mass ceremony could not take place.\n\nInstead, members of the Royal Family visited the Royal Crypt at different times.\n\n2022’s offering marked the first time the whole family has come together in public.\n\nDON'T MISS\n\nPrince Harry's home 'is and always will be' the UK, court hears [INSIGHT]\n\nEugenie and Beatrice feel weight of 'toxic' Prince Andrew [REVEAL]\n\nKate & William experience 'conflict' due to George, Charlotte & Louis [REPORT]\n\nPrincess Delphine was officially recognised as the daughter of King Albert II in 2020, after being born out of wedlock.\n\nThe Princess won her battle in court to be officially recognised as his child and was reconciled with her father.\n\nThe King confirmed her parenthood on January 27, 2020 in a press release, and Delphine was recognized as a princess of Belgium and granted the new surname of Saxe-Coburg in October 2020.\n\nLast summer, Princess Delphine attended the National Day parade but her father Albert and his wife Queen Paola were not present.\n\nAfter Thursday’s ceremony, members of the Royal Family took a brief moment to greet some royal watchers who had gathered outside.\n\nSome of the royals were presented with flowers and gifts.\n\nAmong the people being remembered at the service was likely the Grand Duke Jean of Luxembourg, who died in April 2019.\n\nHe was very close to the Royal Family of Belgium, being the brother-in-law of King Albert."
