        "text": "The Belgian royal family gathered in Brussels on Tuesday for an annual service remembering their late loved ones, with some lovely jewels worn for the occasion.\n\nKing Philippe and Queen Mathilde of the Belgians led the royal party at the annual mass, which was held on Tuesday at Our Lady of Laeken in Brussels. The mass is timed to coincide closely each year with the anniversary of the death of King Albert I, who died in a mountaineering accident on February 17, 1934. The King and Queen were joined by his parents, King Albert II and Queen Paola, as well as his brother and sister-in-law, Prince Laurent and Princess Claire. Philippe’s half-sister, Princess Delphine, attended with her husband, Jim O’Hare.\n\nThere were several extended members of the family in attendance, too, including Princess Léa (widow of King Albert’s late half-brother, Prince Alexandre of Belgium); Archduke Carl Christian and Archduchess Marie-Astrid (son-in-law and daughter of King Albert’s late sister, Grand Duchess Joséphine-Charlotte of Luxembourg); and Prince Nikolaus of Liechtenstein (husband of Princess Margaretha, the younger daughter of the late Grand Duchess Joséphine-Charlotte).\n\nThe brooch, which looks to me to be an Art Deco piece, features a pair of lovebird parrots on a perch. The piece is set with diamonds, with small sapphire, ruby, emerald, and citrine accents on the birds themselves. The jewel has been in Mathilde’s collection since at least 2017, and it wouldn’t surprise me if it were yet another of her antique auction acquisitions."
