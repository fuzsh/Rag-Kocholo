        "text": "Members of the Belgian Royal family gathered at Notre Dame Church in Laeken yesterday to attended a mass held annually in memory of deceased family members. For this event, Queen Mathilde wore a new rounded headpiece covered in the same charcoal fabric as her high collared blouse. The textured fabric works surprisingly well on the design (and is well made- there’s not a pucker to be spotted here) but oh, how I wish it had a covered crown. I can’t get behind these doughnut designs.\n\nDesigner: Fabienne Delvigne\n\nPreviously Worn: This headpiece is new\n\nPrincess Marie-Esméralda, (younger half-sister of King Albert) wore a navy straw based headpiece trimmed with navy and cream feathers, placed on the back of her head. Her sister-in-law, Princess Léa, wore a simple navy bow, also placed on the back of her head (see the video clip below).\n\nPrincess Margaretha of Liechtenstein (King Philippe’s first cousin) wore a sequinned calot hat wrapped in a a swath of dotted tulle. She also placed the design WAAAY back on her head… perhaps to downplay its disco vibe? I thought it was a strange choice for a memorial event such as this.\n\nDesigner: unknown\n\nPreviously Worn: I believe this hat is new\n\nLet’s face it- this isn’t the strongest group of hats we’ve reviewed. What elements here do you like?\n\nPhotos from Getty as indicated; Photonews, Photonews, Photonews and Photonews via Getty\n\nThe Belgian Royal Family gathered today in the Cathedral Saints Michel et Gudule to bid farewell to Queen Fabiola. For this funeral, Queen Mathilde wore a new black fabric-covered headpiece that circled her head.\n\nQueen Paola wore a delicate veil in black Brussels lace.\n\nPrincess Astrid wore a headband trimmed with a stacked, double silk bow topped with a swath of dotted net tulle.\n\nPrincess Maria Laura wre a wide black felt headband while archduchess Elisabetta, wife of Prince Amadeo, wore a small black pillbox hat with rounded crown and grosgrain ribbon trim around the hat. Princess Luisa Maria was the only grandchild of King Albert and Queen Paola who did not attend the funeral (presumably, she was not able to leave her studies in England).\n\nPrincess Claire wore a charcoal grey hat which was simply trimmed with a wide ribbon around the crown. The flat brim of this hat was slightly upturned around the edge and the straight sided crown was gently domed at the top.\n\nPrincess Louise wore her first hat for this important family event. Her mottled grey felt cloche was trimmed with a petite bow at the back.\n\nPrincess Léa, widow of King Albert’s late half-brother Prince Alexander, wore a beautiful black lace veil. Princes Marie-Esméralda (younger half-sister of King Albert) wore a Victorian inspired black hat with net tulle trim. The back of the hat, which folded upward, was trimmed with several black satin bows.\n\nYou can see hats worn by royal cousins from Luxembourg and Liechtenstein at this post and hats worn by representatives of other royal houses at this post.\n\nPhotos from Patrick van Katwijk, Patrick van Katwijk, Olivier Polet, Pool/Luc Claessen, Patrick van Katwijk, Christophe Licoppe, Pool/Luc Claessen, Didier Lebrun, Albert Nieboer, Patrick van Katwijk, Didier Lebrun, Christophe Licoppe, Pieter Jan Vanstockstraeten, Didier Lebrun, Didier Lebrun, and Didier Lebrun, all via Corbis\n\nHere are all of the Belgian royal hats we saw this year (click on each photo to link its original post with larger views of each hat):\n\nPrincess Léa and Princess Marie-Esmeralda (#2 and 3)\n\n1. 2. 3.\n\nPrincess Maria-Laura (#4 and 5), Archduchess Elisabetta (#6) and Princess Astrid\n\n4. 5. 6. 7. 8.\n\nQueen Paola\n\n9. 10.\n\nPrincess Claire and Princess Louise (#15)\n\n11. 12. 13. 14. 15.\n\nQueen Mathilde\n\n16. 17. 18. 19.\n\n20. 21. 22. 23.\n\n24. 25. 26. 27.\n\n28. 29. 30. 31. 32.\n\nDo any of these hats make your list of favourite royal hats this year? Is there one you want to nominate for your least favourite hat of 2014?\n\n*Update: Belgian royal hats worn on December 12 and December 13 have been added to this list.\n\nMembers of the Belgian Royal Family attended an annual Mass at Église Notre-Dame in Laeken, Belgium yesterday to commemorate the lives of deceased Royal Family members. Queen Mathilde wore a new chocolate brown felt calot style hat with a large spray of leaves on the side. This is not a colour we have seen her wear very often and I thought it was a great millinery look for her\n\nDesigner: unconfirmed. Likely Fabienne Delvigne\n\nQueen Paola wore a tall classic black rounded pillbox hat. The way she wore this new hat, back on the crown of her head, allowed her white hair to create the most marvelous contrast with the hat and I thought she looked very, very chic.\n\nPrinces Marie Esmeralda (younger half-sister of King Albert) wore a wide navy blue fabric headband was trimmed with a large medallion on the side. I suppose I like it, although I would have love it if it had been a full-blown pillbox hat. Princess Margaretha of Liechtenstein (niece of King Albert, the daughter of his sister Grand Duchess Josephine of Luxembourg) wore what looked to be a sedate, flat black pillbox.\n\nPrincess Léa (wife of King Albert’s late half-brother Prince Alexander) wore a wide headband in light brown fur. I am not usually a fan of headbands of any type but I must admit that this one, paired with a matching wrap and Léa’s flowing blonde hair, was ski-bunny glamour at its best.\n\nWhich one of these royal hats was your favourite? You might want to compare the hats worn at this same event last year.\n\nPhotos from Patrick van Katwijk via Dutch Photo Press"
