        "text": "Adele’s impressive songwriting credits, long list of music awards, and consistently sold-out tours are testaments to her widespread fame. Since her debut in 2007, no one can deny she is one of the best vocalists of our time.\n\nBefore Adele became a powerhouse musician, she honed her skills during her childhood in London, UK. Adele held a deep passion for singing and refining her vocals from the age of four, which eventually led her to the BRIT School for Performing Arts and Technology. She spent her school years diving deeper into music creation, learning songwriting and guitar. Soon enough, her pathway to success was well within reach.\n\nFollowing graduation, Adele took the next step toward securing a solid record deal. She quickly landed a recording contract with the UK’s XL Recordings in 2006. Her 2007 single “Hometown Glory” provided a sneak peek of what Adele was capable of. New listeners couldn’t deny her strong, powerful singing range as she belted out her best on the breakthrough track.\n\nHer rise began earnestly when “Chasing Pavements” hit the radio waves in 2008. It slid smoothly onto the UK charts and set the tone for her debut album 19. Adele’s signature sound made waves in mainstream media. She had the voice, songwriting skills, and full-fledged potential to become the next certified phenom.\n\nBecause of 19’s undeniable versatility, Adele earned two Grammy awards for Best New Artist and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance in 2009. The stakes were high for the songstress’s follow-up projects, but thanks to Adele’s staple work ethic and natural talent, she tackled her next era with grace.\n\nIn 2011, Adele stepped away from her usual ballads with “Rolling in the Deep,” delivering pop-friendly, blues-inspired beats. As the single soared in popularity on the radio and internationally, so did Adele’s star status. Her sophomore studio album 21 dropped in 2011, bringing with it multiple smash hits. With “Rolling in the Deep,” “Someone Like You,” and “Set Fire to the Rain” all topping charts, Adele became the first female artist to have three simultaneous singles in the Billboard top 10. At the next year’s Grammys, Adele took home all six awards she was nominated for, becoming the only woman to ever do so other than Beyoncé.\n\nAdele entered 2015 with more Grammys and renewed vigor under her belt. After nearly eight years since her official debut, the artist was ready to take on her title as one of this generation’s greatest popstars. She effortlessly segued into her next project by releasing the smash hit “Hello.” The single’s nostalgia, regret, and wistfulness weaved their way into listeners’ hearts and laid the groundwork for her next album 25.\n\nWith the help of “Hello” and Adele’s impeccable vocal range, 25 was one of the best-selling albums in 2015. It was no easy feat, especially with other top-notch artists like One Direction, Justin Bieber, and Rihanna also releasing new music. However, Adele’s presence pushed forward and remained steady on the worldwide charts.\n\nHer most recent LP 30, released in 2021, continued to take the world by storm. Adele broke new ground as she sang about motherhood, depression, and divorce. It was a candid look into the artist’s private life, unveiling her struggles during the past six years.\n\nLike Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Celine Dion, and Britney Spears, Adele joins the long list of artists who have made themselves comfortable at The Colosseum at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas as performers-in-residence.\n\nAs Adele’s discography grows, so does her popularity. Her breathtaking voice, devotion to her creative development, and work on upcoming albums keep her at the top of her game.\n\nAdele continues to tour and perform live. Like Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Celine Dion, and Britney Spears, Adele joins the long list of artists who have made themselves comfortable at The Colosseum at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas as performers-in-residence."
