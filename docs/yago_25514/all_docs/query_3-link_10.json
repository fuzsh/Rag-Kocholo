        "text": "Queen Máxima’s life\n\nMáxima enrolled at the Catholic University of Argentina after completing secondary school. After graduating, she worked in New York from 1995 to 2000. She met the Dutch Crown prince at a party in the Spanish city of Sevilla and moved to Brussels less than a year later.\n\nIn 2001 Máxima Zorreguieta officially became a Dutch citizen on her birthday. Princess Máxima and Prince Willem-Alexander married on 2 February 2002 at the Beurs van Berlage in Amsterdam. the church ceremony occurred at the Nieuwe Kerk. Due to his part in the regime of Jorge Videla, her father was not welcome at the wedding.\n\nThe newly married couple moved into a house on Noordeinde square in The Hague and, in the spring of 2003, moved to villa Eikenhorst on De Horsten Estate in Wassenaar. They have three children: Princess Amalia (7 December 2003), Princess Alexia (26 June 2005) and Princess Ariane (10 April 2007).\n\nQueen Máxima’s work\n\nOf course, a dedicated, passionate king requires an equally dedicated queen. As King Willem-Alexander’s spouse, Queen Máxima assists the king in fulfilling his tasks as the head of state. In addition to his formal tasks the king is committed to the people of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. He has a unifying, representative and stimulating role.\n\nQueen Máxima fulfils countless social tasks both within the Netherlands and abroad. She also has representative responsibilities, such as representing the Royal Family at official events throughout society. She is also a member of the Council of State.\n\nMáxima and Willem-Alexander have always tried to provide as normal a life as possible for their three children and have therefore also pulled their weight as parents of school-age children. Máxima helped out at school during lunch breaks and was available to check children for headlice just like all the other parents."
