        "text": "International royals have arrived in Amman ahead of the Jordanian royal wedding of Crown Prince Hussein of Jordan and his wife-to-be, Rajwa Al-Saif. King Abdullah II and Queen Rania of Jordan, the proud parents of the groom, are poised to host representatives from at least 10 foreign monarchies and imperial families in what is sure to be a lavish day of celebrations.\n\nIn an exciting turn of events, William and Kate have arrived in the country ahead of the royal nuptials, despite not previously confirming their attendance. The Prince and Princess of Wales were spotted strolling across the lobby of a five-star hotel in Amman on Wednesday night. Prince William and Crown Prince Hussein are both graduates of Sandhurst.\n\nCelebrations will started last night with a banquet hosted by King Abdullah II. Today, the couple will marry in the gardens of Zahran Palace – the venue of King Abdullah II and Queen Rania’s wedding in 1993 – before travelling to the modern Al Husseiniya Palace, where the newlyweds will receive guests before an evening banquet. The dress code has yet to be confirmed but it is expected there will be some glittering crown jewels on show.\n\nFormer King Juan Carlos, 85, and his wife Queen Sofia, 84, are expected to represent their son King Felipe VI. King Philippe of Belgium will be joined not by his wife Queen Mathilde but by his daughter and heir, Princess Elisabeth, who is studying at the University of Oxford. Another crown princess poised to attend is Princess Catharina-Amalia of the Netherlands, who will join her parents King Willem-Alexander and Queen Máxima. Both future queens also recently attended the Coronation reception at Buckingham Palace. Representing Queen Margrethe II of Denmark, who has battled health issues since the start of this year, will be her son and daughter-in-law Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary.\n\nJapan’s Princess Takamado, whose late husband was a cousin of the former Emperor Akihito, will attend with her daughter Princess Tsuguko of Takamado. In a touching moment, Prince Sébastien of Luxembourg, a contemporary of Crown Prince Hussein at Sandhurst, has also been given an invitation.\n\nThere will of course be a smattering of Jordanian royals. Crown Prince Hussein’s glamorous parents (recently returned from the King and Queen’s Coronation) will be joined by their three children, Princess Iman, 26, Prince Hashem, 18, and Princess Salma, 22. Princess Iman’s new husband, Jameel Alexander Thermiótis, is expected to join them.\n\nWith the date of the royal wedding upon us, here are the international royals who have confirmed so far…\n\nThe Prince and Princess of Wales\n\nKing Juan Carlos I and Queen Sofia of Spain\n\nPrincess Elisabeth and King Philippe of Belgium\n\nCrown Princess Victoria and Prince Daniel of Sweden\n\nKing Willem-Alexander and Queen Máxima of the Netherlands\n\nPrincess Catharina-Amalia of the Netherlands\n\nCrown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary of Denmark\n\nCrown Prince Haakon of Norway\n\nHisako, Princess Takamado of Japan\n\nPrincess Tsuguko of Takamado\n\nPrince Sébastien of Luxembourg\n\nYang di-Pertuan Agong Al-Sultan Abdullah Ri’ayatuddin Al-Mustafa Billah Shah and Raja Permaisuri Agong Tunku Hajah Azizah Aminah Maimunah Iskandariah of Malaysia"
