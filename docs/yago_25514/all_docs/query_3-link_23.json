        "text": "HOUSE OF SAXE-COBURG AND GOTHA\n\nThe House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (in German, Haus Sachsen Coburg und Gotha) is a German dynasty, in particular, the line of the Saxon House of Wettin that ruled the Ernestine duchies, including the duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.\n\nAlthough the House of Coburg reaches back in history to the 1400s, we start our family tree in the latter half of the 18th century with Franz Friedrich Anton, the sixth Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld (from 1826 on, the house was called Saxe-Coburg and Gotha). Through the first marriage of Ernst, Franz Anton’s eldest son, to Luise Princess of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg, the house acquired considerably more territory and importance. The descendants of Franz Friedrich Anton were at the top of several European monarchies. Members of their successor families are currently heads of government in many countries: Belgium through the descendants of King Léopold I, and in the Commonwealth realm through the descendants of Prince Consort Albert. Due to anti-German sentiment in the United Kingdom during World War I, King George V of the United Kingdom and Ireland changed the name of his branch from “Saxe-Coburg and Gotha” to “Windsor” in 1917. The same happened in Belgium, where it became “van België” or “de Belgique.”\n\nKINGDOM OF BELGIUM - HOUSE OF SAXE-COBURG AND GOTHA\n\nBelgium became independent in 1830, after the Belgian Revolution, in which the Southern Provinces rose up and separated from the United Kingdom of the Netherlands.\n\nBelgium’s independence was proclaimed by the then Provisional Government. The members of the National Congress favored the creation of a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy by a vote of 174 to 13. In 1831, Baron Surlet de Chokier was appointed Regent by the National Congress, whose members ultimately designated Léopold Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha as their first King of the Belgians. Prince Léopold swore allegiance to the Belgian Constitution on 21 July 1831 and took an oath that made him king on the front steps of St. Jacques-sur-Coudenberg Church at Coudenbergh Place in Brussels. July 21 is now celebrated as Belgium’s National Day. All of King Léopold’s successors owe allegiance to the Constitution.\n\nThe following lists all of the Belgian monarchs since 1831, when King Léopold I ascended to the throne, after Belgium declared independence from the United Kingdom of the Netherlands in the 1830 Belgian Revolution.\n\n“Episode of the Belgian Revolution of 1830” or “Episode of the September Days of 1830 on the Grand Place of Brussels”\n\nGustave Wappers (1834), Museum of Ancient Art, Brussels\n\nIn addition to linguistic and religious conflicts that arose out of two hundred years of separation, there were social discrepancies between the northern and southern provinces in the United Kingdom of the Netherlands. Unemployment in the south was high, and workers became frustrated. Even liberal bourgeois and Belgian patriots disapproved of the reactionary politics of Willem I King of the Netherlands.\n\nWhen King Willem I tried to reconquer the lost provinces after the new kingdom was founded, King Léopold I’s Belgian troops, backed by French military forces, came away the winner. The Dutch withdrew, but it was another eight years before they truly accepted Belgium’s independence and signed the Treaty of London.\n\nLéopold I King of the Belgians\n\nLeopold\n\nLéopold I, King of the Belgians (since 1831)\n\n(Coburg, 16 December 1790 – Laeken, Brussels, 10 December 1865)\n\nLeopold (Leopold Georg Christian Friedrich) was the youngest son of Duke Franz Friedrich Anton and Duchess Auguste Karoline Sophie of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. Leopold was appointed colonel of a regiment in Russia because of his relationship and finally reached the rank of lieutenant general in the Imperial Russian Army. He excelled in negotiating and diplomatic duties. In 1816 he married Charlotte Augusta, Princess of Wales, who was to become Queen of the United Kingdom. But she died after one year of marriage on the birth of a stillborn son. The widower Leopold stayed in London, neglected the offer to become King of Greece but accepted to become the first King of the Belgians, following Belgium’s independence from the Netherlands in 1831. Thus he was the founder of the Belgian line of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. His children included Léopold II, King of the Belgians and Carlota, Empress of Mexico. And he was a maternal uncle and adviser of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom.\n\nPrince of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, Duke of Saxony\n\nPrince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Duke of Saxony (since 1826)\n\nCharlotte Augusta\n\nPrincess of Wales\n\n1\n\n(London, 7 January 1796 – Claremont House, Esher, Surrey, 6 November 1817)\n\nCharlotte Augusta was the only child of George, Prince of Wales and later King George IV and Caroline of Brunswick. Had she outlived her father and her grandfather, King George III, she would have become Queen of the United Kingdom. She was the only legitimate grandchild of King George III who was very interested in offering her an education suitable for her succession to the throne. She decided against Willem, the Hereditary Prince of Orange, and instead married Léopold I, Prince of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. To the great distress of her husband and the British population, she died in childbirth at the age of 21.\n\nPrincess of the United Kingdom\n\nPrincess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Duchess or Saxony\n\nLouise\n\nQueen of the Belgians (since 1832)\n\n2\n\n(Palermo, Sicily, 3 April 1812 – Ostende, Belgium, 11 October 1850)\n\nLouise (Louise Marie Thérèse Charlotte Isabelle) was the eldest daughter of the future King of the French Louis-Philippe I and his wife Maria Amalia of the Two Sicilies. Louise was a member of the reigning House of Bourbon. On her father’s side, she was a descendant of Philippe Égalité, Philippe d’Orléans, Regent for Louis XV, Madame de Montespan, and of Louis XIV and Philippe I, Duke of Orléans – both the sons of Louis XIII. On her mother’s side, she was a descendant of Maria Theresa of Austria and Catherina de’ Medici. When her father succeeded to the throne, under the name Louis-Philippe I, King of the French, Louise became a “Princesse d’Orléans” at the age of eighteen. When she married King Léopold I, she became Queen Consort of the Belgians as the second wife of King Léopold I. Louise is an ancestor of the present King of Belgium, of the Italian Royal Pretender (Prince of Naples), the Grand Duke of Luxembourg, and the present Prince Napoléon – head of the Imperial House of France.\n\nMademoiselle d’Orléans (Princess of the Blood)\n\nPrincess of Orléans (since 1830)\n\nLéopold\n\nLéopold II King of the Belgians (since 1865)\n\n2\n\n(Brussels, 9 April 1835 – Laeken, Brussels, 17 December 1909)\n\nLéopold (Léopold Louis Philippe Marie Victor) wanted a kingdom rivaling other European countries and used his marriage with a Habsburg archduchess to give it more prestige. He was responsible for making the Congo a colonial empire, allowing him to accumulate enormous private wealth while the population of the Congo had suffered indescribably. Under his reign Brussels became a contemporary capital, as he commissioned parks and impressive buildings.\n\nPrince of Belgium\n\nPrince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Duke of Saxony\n\nDuke of Brabant (since 1844)\n\nLouis Philippe\n\nCrown Prince of Belgium\n\n1\n\n(Laeken, Brussels, (24 July 1833 – Laeken, Brussels, 16 May 1834)\n\nLouis Philippe (Louis Philippe Léopold Victor Ernest) was a year old when he died of sinusitis. He was not titled Duke of Brabant, as this title was not yet invented for an heir apparent. His younger brother, Léopold succeeded him as crown prince, and later succeeded their father as Léopold II, King of the Belgians.\n\nPrince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Duke of Saxony\n\nPhilippe\n\nCount of Flanders (since 1840)\n\n3\n\n(Laeken, Brussels 24 March 1837 – Brussels, 17 November 1905)\n\nPhilippe (Philippe Eugène Ferdinand Marie Clément Baudouin Léopold Georges) was the second surviving son of Léopold I, King of the Belgians and his wife Louise d’Orléans. He was the heir presumptive to the Belgian throne until the birth of his nephew who later died in 1869 when he regained his position. In 1866, after the abdication of Alexandru Ioan Cuza, Prince of Romania, he was offered the throne of Romania but he refused. In 1867 he married Maria Luise, the daughter of Karl Anton, Prince of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen and his wife Josephine, born Princess of Baden.\n\nPrince of Belgium\n\nPrince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Duke of Saxony\n\nMarie Charlotte\n\nThe Empress of Mexico (since 1864)\n\n4\n\n(Laeken, Brussels, 7 June 1840 – Meise, Belgium 19 January 1927)\n\nCharlotte (Marie Charlotte Amélie Augustine Victoire Clémentine Léopoldine married her second cousin Maximilian, Archduke of Austria, the younger brother of Emperor Franz Josef of Austria. While her husband served as governor of the provinces of Lombardy and Venetia, the couple lived in Italy, but they lacked real power. So Maximilian finally accepted to take the throne of Mexico while supported by French troops in action and to build up a second Mexican Empire. But soon the French troops withdrew and Carlota left Mexico to search for help in Europe – in vain. Her husband failed at the end and was executed. Carlota suffered a profound collapse and never returned to Mexico.\n\nPrincess of Belgium\n\nPrincess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Duchess of Saxony\n\nArchduchess Charlotte of Austria\n\nPrincess Royal of Hungary and Bohemia (since 1857)\n\nLéopold II King of the Belgians\n\nCHANGE OF SUCCESSION\n\nIn 1869, Prince Léopold, heir apparent and Léopold II’s only son, died from pneumonia at the age of 10 after falling into a pond.\n\nUpon his death, Léopold II was succeeded by the heir apparent, his nephew Albert, whose eldest son would later succeed him as Léopold III.\n\nAlbert I King of the Belgians\n\nKing Albert I and Queen Elisabeth of the Belgians, received by Pope Pius XI, about 1926\n\nKing Albert’s Family\n\nLéopold III King of the Belgians\n\nLéopold, Hereditary Prince of Belgium and Princess Astrid on their wedding day, 1926\n\nBaudouin, King of the Belgians\n\nBaudouin, King of Belgium and Queen Fabiola\n\nCHANGE OF SUCCESSION\n\nBaudouin died a highly esteemed king, who served Belgium and its people for a period of 42 years. He always felt responsible for his subjects and was a popular head of state. He formed the King Baudouin Foundation to improve living conditions and social welfare for Belgium’s people. Half a million people came to pay their respects at his funeral, even Queen Elisabeth from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. As he and Fabiola did not have any children, the crown passed on to his brother Albert, the Prince of Liège and heir apparent.\n\nAlbert II King of the Belgians\n\nKing Albert II and Queen Paola of Belgium\n\nPhilippe becomes new Belgian King as Albert II abdicates\n\nPhilippe King of the Belgians"
