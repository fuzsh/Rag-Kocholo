        "text": "When Levi Duchman and Lea Hadad, members of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement, were married in front of more than 1,500 guests at the Hilton Abu Dhabi Yas Island hotel on Sept. 14, there was one moment so notable that it went viral on Instagram: a video of the Hasidic groom dancing joyously with his friend, Abdalla Almaazmi, along with other Muslim and Jewish men.\n\nThe video is notable, in part, for what it symbolized: The growth of the Jewish population in the United Arab Emirates, especially since 2020, when the country signed the Abraham Accords, a landmark deal that normalized relations between Israel and several Arab countries.\n\nRabbi Duchman, 29, has served as a rabbi and Chabad emissary in the United Arab Emirates since he was 21. He estimated that since the signing, the number of Jews living in the Emirates has risen fivefold, to about 10,000.\n\n“To bring my family, my parents, our heritage, our traditions and to share this with the local population, this was so special,” said Rabbi Duchman, who grew up in Brooklyn and studied in Chicago and Manchester, England. Ms. Hadad, 27, was born in Brussels and has lived in Quebec and Tel Aviv, where she met Rabbi Duchman. She has now joined him in Abu Dhabi."
