The commercial truck industry is vital to our nation’s economic well-being, touching nearly every aspect of our lives – from the food we eat and clothes we wear to the lumber for our buildings and homes and the nuts and bolts that hold our cars together. That’s why Heavy Duty Trucking produces the industry’s best read magazine, reaching thousands of fleet executives responsible for the operation of our nation’s commercial trucks – from the pros who manage thousands of vehicles to the hands-on owners of small fleets. HDT’s editorial experts are educators who focus on relevant issues – issues that impact fleet operation, equipment asset management and future business decisions – providing up-to-date information to allow fleets to make informed purchase decisions.
