        "text": "A Word From Our President\n\n\"Networking occurs when our members get together even though they're competing out in the field. Here, they’re talking about what works, what doesn't, what's been good for them, and what hasn't been so good. They suggest things that others might try if they haven’t tried them before. I don’t know of any industry that possesses a stronger family atmosphere from that perspective than the trucking industry.\"\n\n- Gary Langston, IMTA President + CEO"
