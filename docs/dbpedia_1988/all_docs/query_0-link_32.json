        "text": "So I will go ahead and start my build thread even though the full on build will not be for a couple of more months.\n\nI am kind of bored with my Nova so I decided I would build a Mustang. Originally I was thinking about putting a MArk VIII 4V into a V-6 SN95 and build a sleeper. Then I decided I like the Fox bodies better so that is the direction I am going.. So a couple of months ago I was perusing CraigsLlist and I found a 93 Mark VIII up in DC for $400. I figured why not , at $400 I will make my money back scrapping everything and selling the engine. So I have a total of about $550 into the car counting the fuel to go get it up in DC. I have already made back about $500 scrapping the body and selling various things from headlights to tail lights and mirrors.\n\nHere are a couple of pics of the donar car and its deconstruction\n\nI still have the entire rear axle, and drive shaft. I have just been busy with work and a few other things to get around to trying to sell the rest of the stuff.\n\nI retired from the Navy 6 1/2 years ago. Still work on the Carriers as a contractor, and I do vinyl graphics on the side so sometimes time is really short.\n\nAfter the first of the year I should have the rest of the cash to continue with the project.\n\nMatt\n\nI still have the entire rear axle, and drive shaft. I have just been busy with work and a few other things to get around to trying to sell the rest of the stuff.\n\nI retired from the Navy 6 1/2 years ago. Still work on the Carriers as a contractor, and I do vinyl graphics on the side so sometimes time is really short.\n\nAfter the first of the year I should have the rest of the cash to continue with the project.\n\nMatt\n\nAnd he helps me with my 4V swap, and wiring my buddies 2.3L turbo swapped beetle. lol\n\nYes the project took an extreem left turn.\n\nIt is a 66 F100. Needs new fenders and door repair. Got it down to Suffolk and pulled the bed liner out and the bed needs more work than originally anticipated. the frame is in good shape though. We will start pulling it apart after thanksgiving and see better what we are going to need. There is a junkyard about 2 miles from where we bought the truck that has our fenders we need.\n\nhere are some of the planned mods\"\n\nCrown Vic K-member, 4V Teksid Mark VIII engine, IRS (probably from Mark VIII ots of body work and fresh paint.\n\nThe owners father also had this behind the barn\n\nThe right side needs a new door, fender, and quarter repair. the left side only needs the quarter repair. No wheels on the car so I could not look underneath it. He said he is not interested in selling right now, but I think after we get done with the truck we will take it back up to let him see it and hit him up for the Mustang again\n\nMatt\n\nHe said it belonged o his brother and was parked there back in 1970 when his brother died, hence the sentimental value. I think once I can show him what we are doing with the truck he may let us buy it. It will be a crap shoot though because I can not get under it to check the underside. I will probably offer him twice scrap value and take a chance\n\nMatt\n\nI hit up pick n pull today for there Tool Kit member half off sale. I picked up the Crown Vic( Actually Grand Marquis) front cross member and suspension for the front, and a complete Mark VIII rear suspension for the back of the F100 build. Next up is to start getting the body off of the frame and get the IRS/IFS mounted.\n\nWe got luck with the grand Marquis and the engine was already out of it so dropping the K-member was relatively easy.\n\nI also grabbed the aluminum drive shaft from the mark VIII, so now I have two of them.\n\nMAtt\n\nIf the frame on the F100 turns out to be as solid as you hope it is, the IRS and the k-member should be fairly easy fab-ups. I'm looking forward to seeing what kind of mounting brackets you make for the IRS. I have access to a 69 Ranger that I might do something with next."
