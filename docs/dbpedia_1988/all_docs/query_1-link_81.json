        "text": "The Dodge Boys have had little to celebrate about lately so the news that Truckin Magazine named the new Ram their 2009 Truck of the Year is certainly welcome.\n\nWhy are we still writing about trucks?\n\nHere at LotPro.com, it has always been about cars and more cars. The advent of high gas prices last summer was cause for celebration. With any luck, pickup trucks would revert to their proper place as a means of transport for farmers and construction workers, while gas-guzzling SUV’s would die a quick death. Unfortunately, the credit mess caused the entire automotive world to come crashing down on itself and at the end of the year, the Ford F-150 was still the best-selling nameplate in the U.S.\n\nThat being said, it seems like we have spent an inordinate amount of time writing about the new F-150, while the Dodge Ram has languished in the shadows. So when the new pick-em-up from Auburn Hills received Truckin’ Magazine’s TOTY award, we figured “what the heck”.\n\nSo here, in all its glory, is the news release from Chrysler:\n\nAUBURN HILLS, Mich., Jan. 6 / -- The game-changing all-new 2009 Dodge Ram continues to win praise by consumers and media. The all-new Dodge Ram was named 2009 Truck of the Year in the current issue of Truckin' magazine.\n\n\"It's an honor to have Truckin' magazine recognize our all-new 2009 Dodge Ram with this significant award,\" said Scott Kunselman, Vice-President Jeep(R)/Truck Product Team, Chrysler LLC. \"This award speaks loudly about the design and capability of our Dodge Ram along with its benchmark interior and unmatched ride and handling.\"\n\n1994 Ram\n\n\"Overall, the sleek design represented the most dramatic change in Ram design since the '94's love-it-or-leave-it big-rig look, and we think it's a hit,\" said Bob Ryder, Senior Tech Editor, Truckin'. \"The Dodge Boys have really done their homework on this one. The quality of materials, including wood trim, chrome accents, and leather, is miles ahead of the previous generation, and really makes the Dodge look luxurious.\"\n\nRam Box\n\nThe all-new 2009 Dodge Ram includes the first-in-segment RamBox(TM) cargo management system that includes versatile, weatherproof, lockable, illuminated, drainable storage bins, pickup bed dividers, a 2-foot bed extender, and a cargo rail system with sliding adjustable cleats. The 2009 Ram also includes the first-in-segment coil-spring, five-link rear suspension fitted to a solid rear axle providing ride and handling not found on any other pickup truck. A new 5.7-liter HEMI(R) V-8 engine with fuel-saving MDS technology provides more horsepower (390 hp) and torque (407 lb.-ft.) and its best-in-class aerodynamics -- .387 Cd -- helps improve fuel economy and performance.\n\nIn addition, the all-new 2009 Dodge Ram includes first-in-segment, factory-installed 4-inch dual exhaust styled dramatically into the rear bumper, first-in-segment store-in-the-floor storage bins with nearly twice as many bins (42) than the previous model (26) and 35 safety and security technologies. Standard features include side-curtain air bags and Electronic Stability Program (ESP) which includes all-speed traction control, trailer sway control, hill-start assist and anti-lock brake system (ABS). Significantly upgraded interiors with segment-first surround-sound audio system and live SIRIUS Backseat TV(TM) round out the interior.\n\nRecently, the all-new 2009 Dodge Ram 1500 Crew Cab earned 5-star ratings for driver- and front-passenger protection in a frontal crash, the highest ratings in the U.S. government's safety crash test program.\n\nIn addition to winning Truckin' magazine's Truck of the Year, the all-new Dodge Ram has picked up several key awards since its introduction:"
