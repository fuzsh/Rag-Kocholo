I will try and call Firebird today and see if they are aware of the show.\n\nI went to FFF too, there werent any flyers at their booth, and Honestly dont remember Mata Jr. being there.. I saw Brandon, Dan, Bob and the new guy.. I think he's a pirate. I hope the show is a go and it is a good time just dont want to see anyone getting screwed. I was approached about a booth at this show, but it was pretty pricey for a show I haven't heard of before. Hope to see you all there.\n\n-Chad\n\nStreetdreams1 +1y\n\nYou guys can check out our last coverage in Hawaii.\n\nhttp://www.truckinweb.com/events/1013tr_streetdreams_showdown_hawaii_2010/index.html\n\nJon Mata Jr where there shooting coverage for Truckin and Minitruckin\n\nI had ask Jon Mata about doing a show in AZ and if i can use both logo's in the event upcoming and he said it was ok to use it.\n\nIm not just taking logo's to make the show better,i had ask them before about the logo,and the rest of the logo's in there been approved by the owners of there company.Im just showing you that we are in there website for coverages already,so i got approved from Jon Mata for the Truckin logo.I know its my first time doing an event in AZ and i just want to make the best of it,and if its good try a tour on the west coast and back to Hawaii for the end of the year show."
