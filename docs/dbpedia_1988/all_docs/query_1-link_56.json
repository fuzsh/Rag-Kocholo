Founded in 1971 and based in Boyertown, PA, we're the hosts of the annual Macungie Antique Truck Show and publisher of Double Clutch Magazine. We've long been known as: \"The place where family, friends and antique trucks come together!\n\nA heartfelt thank you goes out to all that made our 2024 National Meet in Macungie an all time record setter. Yes, there were 1027 trucks on the field, but it's the people and their affection for this old iron that makes our annual event \"The Greatest Truck Show on Earth\". Check out some of these links or our 2024 National Meet if you missed this event and mark your calendar for 2025. Still many more events this summer- check out our calendar for listing!\n\nCheck out our National Meet in Macungie on Dennis Gage's My Classic Car right here.\n\nListen to a podcast from America's Radio with ATCA Director Michael Yarnall and find out more about our organization and what we're all about. **"
