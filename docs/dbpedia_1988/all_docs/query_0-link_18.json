        "text": "The Rebirth of Slick\n\nMINI MOVEMENT (#MINIMOVEMENT) IS SOMETHING I STARTED THREE YEARS AGO WITH THE GOAL OF ENCOURAGING YOUNG PEOPLE TO GET INTO THE MINI-TRUCK LIFESTYLE, WHETHER BY BUILDING, BUYING OR SIMPLY GOING TO LOCAL MINI-TRUCK SHOWS TO SHOW THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE COMMUNITY. Also, we wanted to keep the love alive for people who are already into these great trucks. I personally grew up during the pinnacle of the mini-truckin’ craze, and it had a big positive impact on my life. I always thought little Ford couriers my cousins built when I was a kid were so much cooler than the full-size trucks that I was seeing everyone else modify, and I was hooked. I’ve stuck it out since the beginning, even when they all seem to disappear from my area.\n\nI wanted to find a way to bring them back and shed some light on the ones that are still around, so I started the Mini Movement in my hometown. There were absolutely zero minis riding around here three years ago, but now there are at least 10 minis on the local streets, and more being built every week. It seems to keep growing, and not just in my area. From what I see, the mini-truck scene is growing everywhere!\n\nI ALWAYS THOUGHT LITTLE FORD COURIERS MY COUSINS BUILT WHEN I WAS A KID WERE SO MUCH COOLER THAN THE FULL-SIZE TRUCKS THAT I WAS SEEING EVERYONE ELSE MODIFY, AND I WAS HOOKED."
