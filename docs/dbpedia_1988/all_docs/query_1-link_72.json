        "text": "Back in the day (late 1970's to mid 1980's), when I was doing work for Street Rodder magazine (monthly Modeler's Corner column and various 1/1 scale event and car features), the guys across the hall at McMullen Publishing world headquarters would occasionally run model car pickup features. Here is one of them (I'll cover two others at a later time).\n\nThis was a simple project combining Monogram's '55 Ford F100 Pickup and their 1955 Ford Panel Delivery kits.\n\nThe idea was to show what a \"Styleside\" full pickup box might have looked like had Ford introduced it to the market in 1955 instead of as they actually did in 1957. The pickup box fenders were trimmed from the Panel Delivery kit body and matched to the cab of the pickup. The pickup bed itself also came from the Panel Delivery. The inner walls of the pickup bed were measured and cut from sheet styrene.\n\nThe rest of the kit was box-stock Monogram, except for the paint. It was the factory 1978 (or 1979?) Ford Bright Green solid, as featured on the 1/1 scale Bronco, and sprayed from a Tempo brand factory color touchup can. The graphic pattern was masked off on the hood, cab sides, and tailgate, and sprayed with a Paasche airbrush. The entire model was then oversprayed with c. 1962 (really) Pactra Pearlustre paint from a can.\n\nHere are a few more photos from a recent photo session....thanks for looking. TIM"
