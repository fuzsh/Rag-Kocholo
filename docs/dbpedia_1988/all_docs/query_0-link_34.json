        "text": "2018\n\nIt's been a while since our news and updates page has been , well, updated. To help with that for 2018 and beyond, the TBM team has a new Social Media Director who already has on Instagram, Facebook with more to come. With her assistance, we are moving forward faster than ever! So without further babbling, here are TBM's 2018's big plans, some of which are already in motion.\n\nFIRST, we have a newly designed (Generation 2) T42-T43 Interface module. It's stronger and more resistent to the elements.\n\nSECOND, we are proud to carry PCS transmission control systems to expand our 6L80/90 product offerings. And to commemorate the occasion, we have finally tackled the GEN III and older SBC engine 6L80/90 conversion with two projects-because you voted for it! Our 2004 Pontiac GTO with 24x LS2 and 6L80 transplant and our 1999 Chevy Silverado 24x LS2-6L80 swap! We will be incrementally introducing all of the components needed to run not only your Gen III full size trucks, but also your older C/K GEN I/II SBC-BBC Vortecs AND 6.2L Diesels! Stay tuned.\n\nTHIRD, we are revisiting our roots: the GMT360 truck platform (SSR, Trailblazer, Envoy, Ascender, Rainier, Bravada, 9-7X), GMT355 (Colorado & Canyon), and GMT365 (Hummer H3) and planning to expand out product line offering to keep these vehicles running faster and stronger than ever against the competition. We have already extended our 6L80/90 transmission conversion systems to cover the full 2002-09 production model years and all factory engine families (LS V8's and Atlas I4-5-6). Trailblazer 1SS's trims will be able to once again upgrade to the Driver Information Center with the re-release of our add-on kit. What's up our sleeves for the rest of 2018? LT Direct Injection conversions! Stay tuned.\n\nFOURTH, learning from GEN III 6L80 projects we are working on a compact 6 speed automatic transmission solution that will allow you to have to have a beefy solution for your older vehicles stuck in the last millenium. Imagine 6L80/90 level of performance, fuel economy and durability, WITHOUT having to cut apart your floorpan??? And guess what. You don't have to have a Chevy engine to do it because we're going to make it available for Buick, Oldsmobile, Pontiac AND small black Ford (Windsor) engine bellhousing patterns. E-mail us for more information and how to order.\n\nLAST, BUT NOT LEAST: SEMA 2018-VEGAS! We will be an exhibitor this year!\n\nMarch 2018\n\nWell we didn't win THROWDOWN '11 Irvine,California...not enough time to iron out all the wrinkles, but we met some great people and had fun.\n\nMore importantly, we were the long distance champs!! ProjecTHROWDOWN was put together in less than 2 months (up to and including the day of the event), driven cross-country (38 hours non stop), beat like a new drum, and DIDN'T break a thing!\n\nMost importantly, we gained a LOT of learning lessons that will translate into better products and services for Trailblazer SS's. If we get the opportunity to come next year, we'll be prepared and WILL win!\n\nBIG thanks to Nordstroms Automotive, Wayne Jones Performance Engineering, EBC Brakes, ColdAirInductions.com, SuspensionMAXX, and Classic Tubes. No way would we have been able to get it done without their sponsorship.\n\nTBMSport is honored to have received an invitation to the inaugural 2011 Truckin' (magazine) Throwdown!! (3/5/11)\n\nTruckin magazine presents THROWDOWN, where once the tire smoke clears one truck owner will be named\n\nChampion of the performance truck world.\n\nGood Morning Enthusiasts,\n\nCongratulations, by reading this, you are the owner/builder of an elite performance truck and we'd like to officially invite you to this year's THROWDOWN.\n\nWere seeing the trend of custom trucks move towards performance with owners wanting to see a return on their investment and we want you to be a part of the revolution by participating in the only truck-specific performance shootout.\n\nTruckins THROWDOWN is a one-day event that will push your truck to its limits by competing against other high-performance hot-rods with beds in the following tests:\n\n0-60-0 mph acceleration/stopping\n\n1/4-mile performance\n\n600-ft slalom\n\nTechnical, multi-turn autocross course\n\nStyling competition\n\nAnd new for this year, were working with the facilitators of El Toro Marine Base to let use a 2.25-mile road course.\n\n-Event coverage and features will be appear in a late Summer issue.\n\n-Video features for each truck and video footage of the event will go LIVE on Truckinweb.com\n\nHere is a link to last years THROWDOWN, which really was just us having fun, but it was such a huge success, we turned into a bona fide event."
