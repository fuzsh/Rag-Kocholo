I would like to add some sound proofing to my truck.

Has anyone done this?

What materials did you use?

Where do you install it to get best results?

Taking a more redneck approach to this, here are some links to alternatives to Dynamat, b-quiet, and raammat, etc.

This was probably the best starting point. The recurring theme is roofing and sound deadening go hand-in-hand .

These folks have very mixed opinions about using all kinds of other materials.

Here is an adventurous combination of mats on an old Ferrari resto.

Finally, the Truckin magazine website has some photos of an install:

I'm curious about the Peel n Seal route. I'll try it on my old Subaru first when I get a chance - roof and doors perhaps.

Well...Click here for a site that explains a bit more about what you are getting into.

I used Brown Bread in my 02, and it's every bit as good as Dynamat, and less money.

I have never used the spray-on stuff in a truck, but I used it (Rockford Fosgate brand) on the dishwasher at home, I put several coats inside the front door, and all around the outside. It helped a quite a bit, but I would stay with the stick-on/roll-on type applications. I just couldn't justify the money for an experiment on a home appliance

It seems pricey for what it is, but if you use enough of it, and in the correct places, it will not only increase the clarity and volume of your stereo, it will reduce road noise, exhaust drone, and a host of other unwanted noises.

That's my $0.02 anyway.
