        "text": "“And there’s the Victoria Memorial, built as a memorial to Victoria.”\n\n–David Dimbleby (Author)\n\n· Victorian Era:\n\nThe Victoria Memorial is one of the most popular historical landmarks of the Joyful City Kolkata, called “The Crown of Kolkata”. It is a magnificent building made of white marbles, was dedicated to Queen Victoria (1819-1901), which was built between 1906 and 1921, during the British rule in India.\n\nFirst of all it has to be known that Queen Victoria was. Queen Alexandrina Victoria was the queen of the Great Britain and Ireland of the United Kingdom since June 20, 1837 until her death. She adopted the additional title of Empress of India on May 1, 1876. Known as the Victorian era, her reign of 63 years and seven months was longer than that of any of her predecessors.\n\nAfter the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the British East India Company, which had ruled much of India, was dissolved, and Britain’s possessions and protectorates on the Indian subcontinent were formally incorporated into the British Empire. In the 1874 general election, Benjamin Disraeli was returned to power. He passed the Public Worship Regulation Act 1874, which removed Catholic rituals from the Anglican liturgy and which Victoria strongly supported. She preferred short, simple services, and personally considered herself more aligned with the Presbyterian Church of Scotland than the Episcopal Church of England. Disraeli also pushed the Royal Titles Act 1876 through Parliament, so that Victoria took the title “Empress of India” from 1 May 1876. The new title was proclaimed at the Delhi Durbar of 1 January 1877.\n\n· History:\n\nFollowing the Queen’s demise, in January 1901, George Nathaniel Curzon, the 1st Baron Curzon of Kedleston (later The 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston), the erstwhile Viceroy of India, suggested the creation of a fitting memorial. Lord Curzon conceived the idea of constructing a colossal and grand building with a museum and gardens where one and all can have a glimpse of the rich past of the British Indian Empire. The Prince of Wales George V, later King George V (May 6, 1910), laid the foundation stone on 4 January 1906, after that, in 1921, the memorial was opened to public.\n\nThe Victoria Memorial was funded by Indian states, individuals of the British Raj and the British government in London. The princes and people of India responded generously to Lord Curzon’s appeal for funds, and the total cost of construction of the monument, amounting to Rs. 105, 00,000, was entirely derived from their voluntary subscriptions. The work of construction was entrusted to Messrs. Martin & Co. of Calcutta.\n\n· Design and Architecture:\n\nThe architect of the Victoria Memorial was William Emerson (1843-1924), president of the Royal Institute of British Architects. The design is in the Indo-Saracenic revivalist style which encompassed a blend of British architectural style with that of Egyptian, Venetian, Deccan, Mughal and other Islamic styles. The building is 338 feet by 228 feet (103m x 69 m) and rises to a height of 184 feet (56 m). It is constructed of white Makrana marble, brought from Jodhpur and Rajasthan. Scottish physician and botanist Sir David Prain and Lord Redesdale were entrusted to design the vast garden areas covering 64 acres while the garden gates and the bridge of the north aspect were designed by Emerson’s assistant, Vincent Jerome Esch. In the gardens at the Victoria memorial, on Esch’s bridge, between narrative panels by Goscombe John, there is a bronze statue of Victoria, by George Frampton. Victoria is seated on her throne, wearing the robes of the Star of India. In the paved quadrangles and elsewhere around the building, other statues commemorate Hastings, Charles Cornwallis (1st Marquess Cornwallis), Robert Clive, Arthur Wellesley, and James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie. Approaching the Victoria Memorial building from the south, visitors pass the Edward VII memorial arch. Upon the arch is a bronze equestrian statue of Edward VII by Bertram Mackennal and a marble statue of Curzon by Frederic William Pomeroy. The garden contains statues of dignitaries such as Lord William Bentinck, Governor General of India (1833–1835), George Robinson (1st Marquess of Ripon), Governor General of India (1880–84), and Rajendra Nath Mukherjee, a pioneer industrialist of Bengal.\n\nAtop the central dome of the Victoria Memorial is the 16 ft. (4.9 m) figure of the Angel of Victory. Surrounding the dome are allegorical sculptures including Art, Architecture, Justice, and Charity and above the North Porch are Motherhood, Prudence and Learning. The forms in the museum like the great dome, clustered with four subsidiary, octagonal domed chattris, the high portals, the terrace and the domed corner towers speak of a splendid richness in architecture.\n\n· Museum:\n\nThe Victoria Memorial has 25 galleries. These include the royal gallery, the national leaders’ gallery, the portrait gallery, central hall, the sculpture gallery, the arms and armoury gallery and the newer, Calcutta gallery.\n\nThis grandiloquent structure presently houses a museum of British India memorabilia like a large collection of oil paintings and water colours by famous European artists like Charles D’oyly, Johann Zoffany, William Hadges, William Simpson, Tilly Kettle, Thomas Hickey, Bultzar Solvyns, Thomas Hickey, Emily Eden and others. Besides these, the Memorial also houses the largest single collection of the works of Thomas Daniell (1749–1840) and his nephew, William Daniell (1769–1837). It also has a collection of rare and antiquarian books such as the illustrated works of William Shakespeare, the Arabian Nights and the Rubaiyat by Omar Khayyam as well as books about Kathak dance and Thumri music by Nawab Wajid Ali Shah.\n\n· The Royal Gallery:\n\nThe Royal Gallery displays a number of portraits of Victoria and Prince Albert, and paintings illustrating their lives, by Jansen and Winterhalter. The oil paintings are copies of those in London. They include: Victoria receiving the sacrament at her coronation in Westminster Abbey (June 1838); Victoria’s marriage to Albert in the Chapel Royal at St James’s Palace (1840); the christening of the Prince of Wales in Windsor Castle (1842); the marriage of Edward VII to Princess Alexandra (1863); Victoria at the First Jubilee service at Westminster Abbey (1887) and the Second Jubilee service at St. Paul’s Cathedral (June 1897). Victoria’s childhood rosewood pianoforte and her correspondence desk from Windsor Castle stand in the centre of the room. Edward VII presented these items to the Victoria Memorial. On the south wall hangs the Russian artist Vasily Vereshchagin’s oil painting of the state entry of Edward VII in Jaipur in 1876.\n\n· Calcutta Gallery:\n\nIn the mid-1970s, the matter of a new gallery devoted to the visual history of Calcutta was promoted by Saiyid Nurul Hasan, the minister for education. In 1986, Hasan became the governor of West Bengal and chairman of the board of trustees of the Victoria Memorial. In November 1988, Hasan hosted an international seminar on the Historical perspectives for the Calcutta tercentenary. The Calcutta gallery concept was agreed and a design was developed leading to the opening of the gallery in 1992. The Calcutta gallery houses a visual display of the history and development of Calcutta from Job Charnock (1630–1692) of the English East India Company to 1911, when the capital of India was transferred to New Delhi. The gallery also has a life size diorama of Chitpur road in the late 1800s.\n\nThe Memorial’s grandeur at a height of 200 feet (184 ft upto the base of the figure of Victory, which is again 16 ft high) is accentuated by the serenity that engulfs you in its corridors. The groups of figures above the north porch represent Motherhood, Prudence and Learning. Surrounding the main dome are figures of Art, Architecture, Justice, Charity etc.\n\nThe vastness and splendour of Victoria Memorial can be comprehended from the fact that it has been divided into different divisions like the garden, library and others for maintenance and also houses a host of valuable articles like the dagger of Tipu Sultan, a cannon used in the battle of Plassey, rare books that date back to 1870, valuable manuscripts like the Ain-i-Akbari by Abul Fazal, rare postage stamps and Western paintings to entice the visitors to this awesome monument.\n\nIn 1943, during WWII, the Calcutta was the victim of Japanese bombing. To protect the Memorial from air raids bombing damage, it was camouflaged by painting black.\n\nOver the years the memorial has not only emerged as one of the most famous tourist destinations of Kolkata but has also remained a favourite spot for family and friends apart from holding a special place for lovebirds. As night falls, lighting of the Victoria Memorial makes it look even more mesmerizing."
