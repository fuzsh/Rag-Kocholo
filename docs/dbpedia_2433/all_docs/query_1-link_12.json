        "text": "This list of tallest buildings in Kolkata enumerates high-rise buildings and skyscrapers in Kolkata and its metropolitan area. Kolkata is currently home to around 800 completed high-rise buildings,[1] and many more high-rise buildings are under construction. The 42, which was completed in 2019, is currently the tallest building in Kolkata and East India with a height of 260 metres (853 ft) consisting of 65 floors.[2]\n\nKolkata's high-rises are primarily concentrated in and around Chowringhee, which is the central business district of the city, EM bypass area and Newtown-Rajarhat area. Tata Centre, the 18-storied building which was completed in 1963 was the city's first skyscraper at 79.2 metres (260 ft). When Chatterjee International Center (24 floors) was built in 1976, it became the tallest office building in the city and also the tallest of its type in all of Eastern India with a height of 91 metres (299 ft). Everest House (21 floors) (84 metres (276 ft)), built in 1978, is also located in Chowringhee. Apart from the central business district, the region of B.B.D. Bagh and Babughat also have several high-rises. The Salt Lake City and Rajarhat New Town regions (which already have several high-rises) have undergone a massive construction boom, with hundreds of high-rises completed and under construction. The city got its first residential high-rise in 2004 when the 'Peak' block was opened in Hiland Park. It has 28 floors with a height of 86 metres (282 ft).\n\nThis created a new idea of constructing residential high-rises in addition to office or commercial buildings. In 2008, South City Towers (36 floors), at a height of 117 metres (384 ft), were completed near Jodhpur Park in South Kolkata which became the first 100 metres (328 ft)-plus buildings of the city. Again in October 2013, Towers 2 and 6 of Urbana topped out at a height of 167.6 metres (550 ft) and 152.4 metres (500 ft), respectively and were the tallest buildings in the city until The 42 topped out in 2019 at a height of 260 metres (853 ft), becoming the tallest building in the city as well as in Eastern India. All these developments have changed the skyline of the city. Currently Kolkata has around 60 completed high-rise building whose height is over 100 meters and many more high-rise buildings are under construction. There are plans to extend the Urbana society to the group of buildings, 3 new towers are coming up in Urbana phase 2 with a height of 147 m each.\n\nThis lists ranks buildings in Kolkata that stand at least 90 metres (295 ft), based on standard height measurement. This includes spires and architectural details but does not include antenna masts. Only completed buildings and under-construction buildings that have been topped out are included.[3]\n\nRank Name Image Height Floors Year Building type 1 The 42 260 metres (853 ft) 65 2019[4][5]
