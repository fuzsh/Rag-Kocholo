        "text": "Introduction:\n\nViceroy of India Lord Curzon created an idea for the Victoria Memorial, one of the most significant historical sites in Kolkata. Victoria Memorial is an iconic landmark of the proud city of Kolkata. There is a lot of history associated with this name. It is a beautiful monument and museum. The white building on the green grass stands tall in the heart of Kolkata. There is so much beautiful green grass, and plants around this building that will fascinate you. The chirping of various birds can be heard in this beautiful garden. Sitting in this Victorian garden will make you feel at one with nature.\n\nHistory of Victoria Memorial:\n\nQueen Victoria was the Empress of British India. She died in January 1901. After she died, Lord Curzon thought of building a huge memorial to Queen Victoria. He proposed the monument to be a royal building with a museum. The foundation stone of the monument was laid on 4 January 1906 by the Prince of Wales. It took 15 years to build this memorial. Then the building was officially inaugurated by Edward VIII and Duke of Windsor. The memorial was opened to the public in 1921. Some of the Queen's personal belongings were displayed in this gallery. The cost of building this memorial came from the funds of Indian princes and native states. But a small part of the funding also came from the British government in London. After India's independence in 1947, many additions were made to the memorial.\n\nArchitecture of Victoria Memorial :\n\nIn terms of design, the design of the Victoria Memorial is taken from the Taj Mahal. There is a main central dome, four smaller domes, high portals, octagonal domed chatris, corner domed towers and terraces. The memorial is 200 feet tall, including the \"Angel of Victory,\" which is perched above the main dome at a height of 16 feet. On top of the central dome, the \"Angel of Victory\" is suspended on enormous ball bearings that revolve in response to the wind. The central dome is surrounded by four allegorical sculptures: Art, Architecture, Justice, and Charity. Just above the front fa√ßade or north porch, three further allegorical sculptures are positioned: Motherhood, Learning, and Prudence. All of the allegorical sculptures were created in Italy and transported there. White Makrana marble from Jodhpur in the Indian state of Rajasthan was used in its construction by Victoria Memorial. Vincent Esch, the supervising architect, helped him. The heritage monument's architecture is built on an Indo-Saracenic revivalist style with a blend of Egyptian, Venetian, Deccan, and Islamic influences. Messrs. Martin & Co. of Calcutta received the commission to build the memorial. At the memorial gardens' main entrance, two enormous marble lion statues stand for might. A few feet from the garden grounds' main entrance is a massive bronze statue of the Queen Empress. Sir George Frampton created the bronze statue in England, and it was shipped all the way to India. A statue of Lord Curzon is placed in front of the Victoria Memorial. The structure is 337 feet by 226 feet and rises to a height of 183 feet.\n\nModern Victoria Memorial:\n\nToday this grand historic building is one of the top museums in Kolkata. There are about 25 galleries here.

Currently, this property is under the responsibility of the Ministry of Culture. A sizable collection of artefacts, mementos, and works of art that illustrate India's colonial history are kept in the Victoria Memorial.
