        "text": "Kolkata: Recreating the nostalgic magic of the bygone era, a new residential project is now being built here on the lines of the iconic Victoria Memorial’s facade.\n\nA joint venture between the Das family, who owns the land near B T Road in Noapara, and real estate major Jain Group, the ‘Dream Victoria’ premium housing project’s facade, arches and columns would be reminiscent of Victoria Memorial.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“The architecture would be aimed at recreating how old Calcutta looked like in the days of the ‘Bhadralok’ culture. Victoria Memorial is the best structure symbolic of those daysÂ so our project would also be reminiscent of the monument,”Â Jain Group’s executive director Rishi Jain told PTI.\n\nHe said the building’s facade would be made of whiteÂ marble and its arches would also be designed on the lines ofÂ the Indo-Gothic architecture, whose construction was completed in 1921.\n\nHaving a built-up area of more than 3,30,000 sq feet,Â the project is expected to be ready in the next 3-4 years atÂ an investment of over Rs 80 crore. It will have more than 200Â flats.\n\nJain said white marble pillars would guard each cornerÂ of the building while the pathways, water body and the gardenÂ would also be in the Victorian style. Designed by British architect William Emerson,Â Victoria Memorial’s structure is a mix of British and MughalÂ elements as well as incorporates Venetian, Egyptian, DeccaniÂ and Islamic architectural influences.\n\nAdvertisement"
