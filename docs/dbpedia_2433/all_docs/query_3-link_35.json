        "text": "Architectural Style of the Museum\n\nThe Victoria Memorial Museum Building’s chief architect and designer, David Ewart, created a fanciful castle-like structure that has been described as Scottish Baronial in design. Ewart’s structures reflect the Romanesque and medieval styles of Europe, with a combination of Tudor and Gothic features.\n\nThe massing and interior articulation of the building are influenced by the Beaux-Arts style, which stressed symmetrical, axial plans.\n\nThe architecture was intended to mirror the Centre Block of Canada’s original Parliament Buildings, one mile due north of the museum’s site.\n\nDespite the influence of European styles, the building designed by Ewart is firmly rooted in Canadian reality. The museum is one of the first public buildings to incorporate into its design animals and plants that are found in Canada. These are found in windows, exterior walls and interior embellishments, in addition to the two carved moose heads that guard the main entrance.\n\nExterior Stone\n\nRough Stone\n\nMost of the façade\n\nNepean sandstone from Campbell Quarry, Nepean (now Ottawa), Ontario\n\nAbout 5% of the stone was replaced in 1995 to 1997 with stone from Les Carrières Ducharme, Havelock, Quebec.\n\nSmooth Stone\n\nDecorative elements\n\nWallace sandstone from Wallace Quarry, Wallace, Nova Scotia.\n\nSteps and Landings\n\nStanstead granite from Stanstead, Quebec.\n\nTIMELINE History of the Museum\n\n1842\n\nMuseum Origins\n\nCreation of the Geological Survey of Canada. In the ensuing decades, the survey’s researchers explore not only the geology of the former Province of Canada, but also collect specimens of flora and fauna.\n\n1856\n\nMuseum Origins\n\nIn 1856 Sir William Logan, the first director of the Geological Survey, is authorized to “establish a Geological Museum at some convenient place which shall be open at all seasonable hours to be public”.\n\n1880\n\nMuseum Origins\n\nThe Survey opened a museum in its headquarters in Montréal, and so Logan is considered by many to be the founding father of Canada’s national museums. The Survey moves to Ottawa’s Byward Market in 1880.\n\n1882\n\nMuseum Origins\n\nThe Survey hires its first naturalist, John Macoun, a 51-year-old botanist. Macoun would lead the development of the first natural-history collections for the museum.\n\n1901\n\nBuilding Construction\n\nParliament authorizes commencement of the construction of the Victoria Memorial Museum in 1901 under the direction of chief architect David Ewart. The building is to be a tribute to Queen Victoria, whose 64-year reign ended in that year.\n\n1903\n\nBuilding Construction\n\nIn 1903, Supreme Court Justice William Stewart’s 3.6 hectare (9 acre) cow pasture is chosen on what was then the outskirts of Ottawa. It is located exactly one mile south of Parliament Hill.\n\n1905\n\nBuilding Construction\n\nWork begins on a massive new building formed out of local sandstone. Three hundred Scottish stonemasons are brought across the Atlantic to work on the building. The contract is to cost $950 000 (the value at the time; figure not adjusted for inflation to today).\n\n1910\n\nBuilding Construction\n\nThe core construction of the museum is completed. Work continues in the interior, with staff preparing the displays of minerals, fossils and birds.\n\n1911\n\nFamous Tenants: National Museums’ Birthplace\n\nThe National Gallery of Canada displays its art treasures on the building’s fourth floor\n\n1912\n\nOpen to Visitors\n\nThe Victoria Memorial Museum Building opens to the public\n\n1913\n\nOpen to Visitors\n\nOn January 20, Canada’s first fossil gallery opens. In July, the first dinosaur to ever be displayed in Canada is rolled out. The dinosaur—a hadrosaur named Edmontosaurus regalis—still captivates visitors in the museum’s current fossil gallery.\n\n1915\n\nBuilding Construction\n\nBecause of unstable ground, the building started sinking before it was completed. In 1915, 24 metres (80 ft.) of the museum’s tower is removed because the foundation cannot hold the weight.\n\n1916\n\nFamous Tenants: Parliament\n\nIn 1916, the building becomes the emergency headquarters of the Canadian government after the Parliament Buildings are consumed by a great fire. The government stayed for four years.\n\n1919\n\nFamous Tenants: Parliament\n\nWhen former Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier dies in 1919, his body is lain in state in the museum’s auditorium.\n\n1920\n\nFamous Tenants: Parliament\n\nThe Parliament of Canada leaves.\n\n1927\n\nMuseum Origins\n\nThe National Museum of Canada and the Geological Survey are formally separated into distinct entities by the federal government. They remain in the building together.\n\n1956\n\nFamous Tenants: National Museums’ Birthplace\n\nThe National Museum of Canada is divided into two branches: the National Museum of Natural Sciences, dedicated to natural history, and the National Museum of Man, representing human history.\n\n1957 -1989\n\nFamous Tenants: National Museums’ Birthplace\n\nThe National Museum of Man occupies approximately half of the museum building until it leaves for to its present location in Gatineau, Quebec, a few years after becoming the Canadian Museum of Civilization in 1986. It is then renamed the Canadian Museum of History in 2014.\n\n1959\n\nFamous Tenants: National Museums’ Birthplace\n\nThe Geological Survey of Canada leaves the building, relocating to Booth Street in Ottawa. The National Gallery of Canada also leaves, relocating to a new building in downtown Ottawa.\n\n1960s\n\nFamous Tenants: National Museums’ Birthplace\n\nArtist Clarence Tillenius completes his landmark dioramas, which depict iconic Canadian mammals in habitats across Canada. The dioramas remain on view to this day.\n\n1967\n\nFamous Tenants: National Museums’ Birthplace\n\nThe fourth national museum has its start at the building: an offshoot of the Museum of Man, the National Museum of Science and Technology—now the Canada Science and Technology Museum—is created and opens at its present location in Ottawa.\n\n1969–1974\n\nBuilding Construction\n\nThe Victoria Memorial Museum Building continues to sink until 1969. The museum is closed for stabilization against sinking, infrastructure upgrades and new galleries. The work costs $6 000 000 (the value at the time; figure not adjusted for inflation to today).\n\n1990\n\nMuseum Origins\n\nThe National Museum of Natural Sciences becomes the Canadian Museum of Nature. It becomes the sole occupant of the museum building after the Canadian Museum of Civilization (previously National Museum of Man) leaves for a new building of its own.\n\n1995–1997\n\nBuilding Construction\n\nThe exterior of the museum’s heritage stonework is cleaned and repaired.\n\n1997\n\nBuilding Construction: New Research Facility\n\nThe Canadian Museum of Nature opens a new research and collections facility in Gatineau, Quebec. This building consolidates the museum’s administration, laboratories, science experts and national collections of fossils, plants, minerals and animals under one roof.\n\n2004–2010\n\nBuilding Construction: Renewal\n\nSignificant construction and renovation work on the museum begins. This is the most comprehensive renovation of the historic building. Interiors are gutted, an interior steel skeleton is installed, new building and climate-control systems are added, additions are constructed and new galleries are installed. The federal government provides $216 million in funding for the building (the value at the time; figure not adjusted for inflation to today), while corporate support and donations fund the new gallery content.\n\n2010\n\nBuilding Construction: Renewal\n\nThe renewal of the museum is completed and the entirely renovated museum building is celebrated on May 22—International Day for Biological Diversity. Queen Elizabeth II dedicates the new glass tower in June. It is called the Queens’ Lantern for both Victoria and Elizabeth II."
