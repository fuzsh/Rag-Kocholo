        "text": "History of Victoria Memorial Kolkata\n\nVictoria Memorial is located in Kolkata. This creation was totally built with marble. Victoria Memorial was built between 1906 and 1921 as a beautiful memory of Queen Victoria. Now it becomes a museum and tourist destination of Kolkata. It is situated at the center of Kolkata. It has a large garden with an area of 64 acres (260,000 m2). On the death of Queen Victoria in January 1901, The 1st Baron Curzon of Kedleston suggested creating this building.\n\nCurzon said,\n\n“Let us, therefore, have a building, stately, spacious, monumental and grand, to which every newcomer in Calcutta will turn, to which all the resident population, European and Native, will flock, where all classes will learn the lessons of history, and see revived before their eyes the marvels of the past.”\n\nVictoria Memorial is made up of with Makrana marble-like Taj Mahal. There is a story behind the bronze fairy at the top of the building. It was created to provide the supercilious weather vane. However, it stopped rotating long years back.

Different types of birds and flycatchers used to take their bath at the water bodies. In summer Kolkata raises its temperature at around 45 degrees. So the crowd is a little low in summer. Apparently, the crowd is 50 times more than summer. We went there with a bucket of food and snacks.

There is also a ship model which is very beautiful. Then we went upstairs. That place is also full of historic things. This gallery is full of pictures of the British empire which looks so pretty. The oil painting is beautiful at that time.\n\nLight and Sound Show\n\nAfter completing the visit to the museum, we came back to the garden again and occupied a sit to enjoy the light & sound show of Victoria which is very popular and beautiful.
