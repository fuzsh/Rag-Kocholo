        "text": "One could hardly imagine a time more exciting for an Indian architect to start a career than at the close of the 1940s, when India had just gained freedom from colonial rule. In many places around the world this was the time when enormous funds were invested in new and often very novel urban developments that were to provide, for better or worse, the model of metropolitan life for the generations to come. By that time, it was generally believed that architecture and urban planning have the power to shape human habits and inspire worldviews. This was also true for India, and at this particular moment it was crucial for decision makers and for the designers to decide on what style and what planning philosophy should they stake. What should the background image of the new Republic of India be, what values should be put through, what goals should be proclaimed? In my presentation, I am going to focus on these decisive years of modern architecture in India and on its major figures.\n\nBuilt within the new capital of British India, the Imperial Record Office: now the National Archives of India is considered an important representative example of culmination of imperial architecture. An integral part of a city of the Empire that continues to this day as democratic India’s capital, the building’s design and construction raises questions on the nature of architecture in one of the most significant British capital city building projects in the subcontinent. In pre-existent scholarship, the architecture and urban environment of Imperial Delhi has predominantly been accepted as a product of the past, as a ‘garden city’ with neoclassical expression. The proposed paper would share the process of generating new knowledge about this structure, carried out through documentation and investigations of the materials, fabric and construction along with the analyses of space planning and design. This brings forth unique aspects that testify the actual development of architectural...\n\nColonialism has played a huge instrumental role in the formation of civilizations in modern times. Although born of mercenary motives and exploitative measures, the phenomenon of colonization greatly impacted the built environment of the colonized area- not just in terms of the culture, languages, genetic make-up and government of the people, but also the town layout and the architecture that they experienced daily. As a result of this, there is an architectural similarity between the habitat of the colonizers and that of the colonized people. Thus if we explore the city layout, workers’ housing, railroad charts during the period of industrialization and Victorian Era in London, we shall find it very similar to that of colonial Bombay. After all, Bombay, as a British colony, is the younger architectural sibling of Victorian London.\n\nModern architectural heritage has various tangible & intangible values associated with them. It is the cultural significance of and the association of these values, which makes it heritage. Like ancient architectural heritage, the post-independence architecture of India has a potential association of values of cultural transformation, social & technological development, innovation, tradition & lifestyle. This paper attempts to explore the various values of the post-independence architecture of India, which makes it an integral part of the nation's cultural heritage. The period under consideration is five decades after independence (1947 to 2000)for this research. Cultural significance of the architecture of this period has been explored through the history of modern architecture of India and the significant modern architecture in the broader setting. For a comprehensive understanding of the cultural significance from a global perspective, there is a brief discussion of the values considered by major organisations involved in the recognition & protection of 20th-century heritage. In light of the broader spectrum of values associated with the architecture of this period and the cultural significance of the post-independence architecture of India, the values associated with the significant modern public buildings of this period have been identified."
