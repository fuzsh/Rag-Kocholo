Presently it is a museum and a popular historical place in Kolkata under the Ministry of Culture.\n\nThe ninth oldest museum of the world and largest in India, the Indian Museum is located in the city of joy - Kolkata. The foundation stone of the Indian Museum was laid down in the year 1814 and has been a centre of multidisciplinary activities ever since.

It is an absolute must to visit this historical place in Kolkata.\n\nFort William is situated in Kolkata on Hooghly River, on its eastern bank. The fort got its name from King William III. It was set up in the year 1696 by British East India Company. It is spread over a distance of 70.9 acres. This huge construction took nearly ten years to complete and had two floors. It comprised of wings and an inner Bastille where prisoners were hauled which is why it was known as 'the black hole of Calcutta'.\n\nSt. Paulâ's Cathedral has been set up in Kolkata, West Bengal. Its foundation was laid in 1839, and it was completely constructed in the year 1847. It has been recognized as the largest cathedral in Kolkata. The cathedral is wonderfully decorated during Christmas and New Year's Eve and huge masses of people swing by the place to enjoy its overwhelming beauty. It is the first church of its kind to be built in the British Empire making it a landmark historical place in Kolkata. It is said that this cathedral was built three times before the one which stands today came out.\n\nSprawling over forty acres of land on the west bank of the Hooghly River, Belur; the Belur Math in Kolkata is a place of pilgrimage and also the headquarters of the Ramakrishna Math and Mission. People from all over the world, irrespective of the religion that they believe in, visit the temple to enjoy the tranquillity and serenity that it imbues.\n\nThe Writers’ Building, located in the capital city of Kolkata, is a secretariat building of State Government of West Bengal.

This historical place in Kolkata is considered to be among the longest cantilever bridges in the world. Also known as Rabindra Setu, it connects Howrah and Kolkata. It carries daily traffic of over 100,000 vehicles and countless pedestrians and is as historic as it is grand. The opulence of the bridge, however, comes alive in the night time as it is all lit up. You can also take a ferry ride as it runs between Kolkata and Howrah, from the launch ghat. The view of the city from the ferry, especially in the night, is priceless, to say the least.\n\nNeveh Shalome Synagogue is situated in China Bazar in Kolkata and was established in 1831 by Shalom Obadiah ha - Kohen.
