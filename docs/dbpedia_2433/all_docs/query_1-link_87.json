        "text": "The reason behind the building of a monument of this grand a scale is indeed an interesting one. This stunning creation is the brainchild of Lord Curzon and was created to commemorate the twenty-fifth-year reign of the Queen over India. The Queen had become the figure head of India after the Revolt of 1857 and successfully ruled over the country until her death in 1901. Lord Curzon wanted that the monument that would be dedicated to her should be stately, spacious and large, with a beautiful garden. In fact, the funds for the construction of the Victoria memorial were raised from the people of India. A sum of 5 lakh rupees was raised, and the result is this awe-striking monument, that is a literal feast for the eyes. King George V and the Prince of Whales laid down the foundation stone for the memorial in 1906, and the memorial was finally opened to the general public in 1921.\n\nThe chief architect of the Victoria Memorial is William Emerson, the president of the Royal Institute of British Architects. He has tastefully lent an Indo-Saracenic style of architecture to the monument, while drawing inspiration from Egyptian, Venetian, Mughal and other Islamic styles at the same time. The 184 feet high building is constructed with Makrana Marble of white colour that was brought all the way from Jodhpur, Rajasthan. The vast gardens that surround the monument, and are spread over a sprawling 64 acres, were designed by botanist Sir David Prain and Lord Redesdale.\n\n1. Victoria Memorial Gallery: The gallery is open from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM from Tuesdays to Sundays. The entry fee per head for Indians is INR 20, while for foreigners, it is INR 200. School children up to class XII in uniform and army personnel do not have to pay any entry fee. 2. The Gardens: The gardens are open on all days from 5:30 AM to 6:15 PM. The entry price per head is just INR 10, while yearly ticket costs INR 1,000 for senior citizens above 60, and INR 2,000 for others. Note that garden ticket does not entitle entry into the museum.\n\nThe gardens of the Victoria Memorial are home to a myriad of sculptures. A bronze statue of Queen Victoria on a bronze throne welcomes the visitor at the entrance of the memorial, while a walk around the garden reveals other statues like those of Edward VII, Curzon, Hastings and Dalhousie. Allegorical sculptures like Motherhood, Architecture, Learning and Justice can also be found here. Spread over 64 acres, the gardens are presently maintained by 21 gardeners and are a favourite destination for morning walkers.\n\nVictoria Memorial holds a light and sound show called as Son-et-Lumiere from October to June. This interesting show does not showcase on Monday, Holi festival, national holidays and also remains closed from July to September.\n\nTickets: INR 10 (Bengali), INR 20 (English)\n\nTimings:\n\nOctober - February: 6:15 PM - 7:00 PM (Bengali), 7:15 PM - 8:00 PM (English)\n\nMarch - June: 6:45 PM - 7:30 PM (Bengali), 7:45 PM - 8:30 PM (English)\n\nWith over 25 galleries, including the Royal Gallery, the National Leaders Gallery, the Sculpture Gallery, the Portrait Gallery, the Central Hall and the Calcutta Gallery, the Victoria Memorial has a commendable and worthy collection of works of rare and antique books. These include the illustrated works of Shakespeare, the Arabian Nights and other books on music and dance. The monument is indeed a treasure trove of outstanding and noteworthy collections of paintings, weapons, textiles, artefacts, stamps, etc. A variety of enriching and informative exhibitions take place here from time to time, along with many other events such as illustrated talks and celebration of important days. A permanent show, Son-et-Lumiere, is regularly held here. Another show titled: Pride & Glory- the Story of Calcutta, which was designed as a venture with Bengal Chamber of Commerce, is also currently held here in both Bengali and English. The show timings are as follows: 1. October to February Bengali: 6:15 PM to 7:00 PM English: 7:15 PM to 8:00 PM 2. March to June Bengali: 6:45 PM to 7:30 PM English: 7:45 PM to 8:30 PM You can follow the link http://www.victoriamemorial-cal.org/exhibition/perpage/0/en to stay up-to-date with the latest events and happenings."
