        "text": "The Victoria Memorial in Kolkata, India is a lovely and historically important building. I was really excited to visit the Victoria Memorial though, when I did, I found making photos to be challenging.\n\nSadly, following a range of terrorist bombings, photography inside some important civic and religious buildings in India is no longer permitted.\n\nI'm going to assume that this is because by making photographs you have a detailed, visual record of where to place a bomb.\n\nPretty simplistic, don't you think?\n\nWhile it might be possible to restrict photographers with professional equipment, it's near impossible to stop folks making photos with their smartphones.\n\nWhatâ€™s more I guess those good folk who made the rules haven't heard about Google Earth.\n\nI was unable to photograph the interior of this spectacular building, one that spoke to the splendour of former British Rule.\n\nIt's such a shame that enthusiast photographers are unable to record much of the beauty, majesty and mystery of this wonderful structure.\n\nFortunately, while security was tight during my visit to the Victoria Memorial, I was able to photograph the exterior of the building without any trouble.\n\nI did so by wandering the extensive grounds and photographing the outside of Victoria Memorial from several angles.\n\nThe image at the top of this post illustrates one of my favourite photos from the day.\n\nWhile the building itself is largely backlit, the shadows it cast provided an interesting reflection that repeats the shape of the main dome and surrounding towers.\n\nOf course there are many approaches to recording a place or event, including the following:\n\nThe architectural and documentary photographer records for posterity.\n\nThe artist interprets creatively.\n\nThe tourist records important moments and memories from their own life's journey as a kind of visual record.\n\nThis record helps protect against the vagaries of memory and allows us to share our experiences with others.\n\nSo, as you can see, banning photography is not without cost and there's much that is lost through the implementation of such draconian policies.\n\nIn some countries authorities seem to be more concerned about video cameras.\n\nThe trouble is that DSLR and mirrorless cameras sold today include video capabilities and this fact may provide the security guard on duty with yet another reason to challenge your right to photograph the site.\n\nWhether you use, or even know how to use, the video capabilities on your camera may be a moot point.\n\nStay Happy By Doing Your Research\n\nI'd heard about the security issues in India, following several bombings by groups that are commonly referred to as extremists. However, I didn't realize that the response was so severe and so widespread.\n\nFrankly, as I travel primarily to photograph, there would be many places that I simply wouldn't visit if I knew I wouldn't be allowed to photograph there.\n\nThat would certainly be my loss but, given my mission in life is to share the beauty of our world and its people with an ever wider audience, I'd say I wouldn't be the only one to miss out.\n\nIf photography is the primary reason you travel you may want to research your planned destinations to ensure you won't be banned from making photos there.\n\nIt may still be worthwhile making the trip, though it might mean you have to adapt and photograph the location or city in question differently than you otherwise would.\n\nIs Travel To India Right For You?\n\nUnless you travel in 5-star comfort India is a very difficult country in which to travel.\n\nNonetheless, the people, culture, temples and landscapes of this large and diverse country provide the enthusiastic photographer with fantastic opportunities to make truly memorable images of India.\n\nI've been to India on four or five occasions and it never fails to excite me. I've been really sick on each trip, but that hasn't stopped me. It's just the price you sometimes have to pay to experience life at such a profound and expressive level.\n\nGlenn Guy, Travel Photography Guru"
