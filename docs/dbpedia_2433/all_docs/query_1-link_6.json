        "text": "Kolkata served as the capital of the British Raj, which extended over almost all of present-day India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, except for small holdings by other European nations such as Goa and Pondicherry, from 1772 to 1911. Many of the structures built in the colonial era still stand, interspersed with older buildings. The city has been the seat of power in the state since its inception. While the government is yet to take sufficient action to restore and manage these heritage buildings, take a stroll down the lanes and spot a few incredible structures.\n\n1. Fort William\n\nViceroy Hotel\n\nThis was the first British building in Kolkata. It was named after King William III and constructed between 1696 and 1706. After the attack by the Nawab of Bengal - Siraj ud Daulah - in 1756, the British decided to relocate their fort to present day Maidan. The reconstruction of the Fort cost the British Empire a dear Rs 2 million pounds. It is now owned by the Indian Army. Civilian entry to the Fort is restricted but there's an incredible view from the ghats of the Hooghly with great ice-cream to go with the view!\n\n2. Writer's Building\n\nWikimedia\n\nOr Writer's, as the residents of the city call it, was the office of the writers during the British rule. It then served as the office of the Chief Minister till 2013 when the building had to be closed down for restoration. The original structure of this iconic building was designed in 1777 by Thomas Lyon and over the years, various additions have been made to it. Step carefully here, as the building is falling apart.\n\n3. Marble Palace Mansion\n\nWikimedia\n\nBuilt in 1835, it houses one of the most impressive private collections of statues and collectibles. The mansion built by Raja Rajendra Mullick takes its name from the marble walls and floor. The zoo, situated within the premises, is the first zoo of India. Need more motivation to visit? Entry is free provided you have a permit from West Bengal Tourism.\n\n4. Raja Ram Mohan Roy Memorial\n\nrammohunroymemorial.in\n\nThe three-storeyed building was purchased by Raja Ram Mohun Roy around 1815 from a Francis Mendes for Rs 13,000. It was then called Simla House as the area it lies in is called Simla. Roy never lived in this house and after his death, his sons and their families lived on in this house till the 1960s when the house was taken over by vandals. In 1972, the Ram Mohun College acquired the building with adjacent properties and established the memorial.\n\n5. Belur Math\n\nWikimedia\n\nA seat of spirituality and the headquarters of a monastic order set up by Sri Ramakrishna. Swami Vivekanada, the foremost disciple of the 19th century saint, spent the last years of his life here after establishing the Math. The place where he took Samadhi still stands within the premises. A separate temple facing the river is for the saint's equally revered wife, Ma Sharada.\n\n6. Girish Chandra Dey & Nakur Chandra Nandy\n\nYummraj\n\nOne of the oldest sweet shops in Kolkata is truly worth the visit. It was established in 1844 by a father-in-law and a son-in-law duo and despite the passage of time, their fame and fanfare has not reduced in the slightest. Sweets from this shop are a must at every sweet-lover's special occasion - even Abhishek Bachchan's wedding to Aishwarya Rai. Other patrons include Satyajit Ray, Uttam Kumar and PM Narendra Modi.\n\n7. St. Thomas School, Kolkata\n\nUrban Pro\n\nThe St Thomas School is the oldest in Kolkata and the second oldest school in the country! It was established in 1789 in Kidderpore. It is also the largest school in Kolkata with three football fields, two basketball courts and a children's playground along with a church. An Engineering College is also run by the school management on the same campus.\n\n8. Jora Sanko Thakurbadi\n\nBCCL\n\nThis house requires no introduction in Kolkata or for anyone connected to Bengal. India's first nobel laureate, Rabindranath Tagore, was born here. It is now the Rabindra Bharti Museum and rarely without the touch of poetry with events held here almost all through the year. Key days to visit include Tagore's birthday, death anniversary and the Aban Mela.\n\n9. 1/1 Bishop Lefroy Road\n\nBCCL\n\nSatyajit Ray's residence is also nothing less of a pilgrimage for aspiring filmmakers. The street was renamed to Satyajit Ray Dharani in February this year. The house was earlier called Calcutta Mansion when Ray purchased it in 1970. It is the first building on the street. Many other historic structures lie along this road like the Bhawanipore cemetery - where one can pay their respects to the \"Father of Indian boxing\" Paresh Lal Roy. Netaji Bhawan also lies on the same road. Athenaeum Institution has purchased the earlier Ray residence.\n\n10. Eden Garden\n\nOmni Pundit\n\nIndia's largest cricket stadium by seating capacity and the most-loved cricket destination in India has seen jubilation and tears alike over the pages of cricket history. It is also the second-largest cricket stadium in the world! The stadium was built in 1864 and named after the 'Garden of Eden' in the Bible. Over the years, Eden Gardens has been called \"Colosseum for cricket\".\n\n11. St. Paul's Cathedral\n\nWikimedia\n\nSt. Paul's Cathedral is an Anglican cathedral of the Church of North India - a united church which is part of the Anglican Communion - in Kolkata, West Bengal, India. It is the seat of the Diocese of Calcutta, and the incumbent bishop is the Rt. Revd. Ashoke Biswas. The building itself stands on the \"island of attractions\" in Kolkata - beside the Victoria Memorial, Nandan, Rabindra Sadan theatre complex, and the Birla Planetarium.\n\n12. Metibruz\n\nWikimedia\n\nOr Matiaburj, as it was originally named by Wajid Ali Shah when he was exiled from his own home in Oudh. Shah tried to recreate the magic of his Lucknow home in Kolkata as well and was able to build a second Imambara at the heart of Metibruz. In recent times, Metibruz is known for being the largest kite manufacturer in the world as well as for the weekly local market which is the largest of its kind in India.\n\n13. National Library\n\nBCCL\n\nThe halls of India's largest library have been claimed to be haunted by generations and why not?! There is surely more an eerie leaf in the 250-year-old building. Located far from the heart of the city, at Belvedere Avenue, around 30 kms off Kolkata, the National Library is not just a literary sojourn but also a ghost-buster's delight.\n\n14. Star Theatre\n\nstartheatre.co.in\n\nBuilt in 1883, this is among the first commercial cinema halls in Kolkata. The first Bengali motion pictures were screened here and despite a fire that nearly destroyed the building, most of it has been restored by the Kolkata Municipal Corporation. The interiors are quite contemporary despite the building's heritage appearance. Plays are still staged here on two days of the week.\n\n15. Clive House\n\nVictorian Web\n\nThe hunt for the oldest buildings of Kolkata comes to a halt at Clive House, which many contend is the oldest building of the city that still stands. The house was bought by Lord Clive after winning the Battle of Plassey and parts of it still stand. It is believed to have been garrisoned at a point, Damdama, as it is called in Hindi, is believed to have lent the modern name Dum Dum."
