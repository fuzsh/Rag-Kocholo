        "text": "1.3K\n\nAre you looking for the most beautiful monuments in Kolkata (formerly known as Calcutta)? Then this post is for you!\n\nOften nicknamed “the City of Joy”, Kolkata was the capital of India until 1911 when it was moved to Delhi, and it’s my favourite metropolis in the country.\n\nWith its rich history and old-school taxis, exploring the streets of Kolkata feels like taking a trip back in time. There are plenty of stunning monuments here – Colonial buildings, temples, churches, mosques – you name it. I couldn’t stop gazing at all the BEAUTIFUL architecture during my two visits to this city.\n\nSo, if you’re a cultural type of traveller or would like to see some of the most beautiful places in Kolkata, this post has got you covered! From Kolkata’s most spectacular colonial buildings to its most famous temples and other landmarks, here are 21 monuments in Kolkata that are worth checking out.\n\nMost Beautiful Monuments in Kolkata\n\n1. Victoria Memorial\n\nThis enormous marble building is one of the most famous landmarks in India. It was built in memory of Queen Victoria, who was empress of India from 1876 until she died in 1901.\n\nThe Victoria Memorial was completed in 1921 and you will find a museum inside that showcases artefacts that once belonged to the queen as well as a collection of paintings and manuscripts.\n\nIf there’s one monument that you cannot miss in Kolkata, then it’s this one! Strolling around Victoria Memorial’s beautiful gardens was one of my favourite things to do in this city.\n\n2. Writer’s Building\n\nThis stunning, 150-m long colonial building was built in a neo-classical style in 1777. Its original purpose was to house the junior clerks (called writers) of the British East India Company, but it’s now the seat of the State Government of West Bengal.\n\nWriter’s Building was the city’s first three-story building, and it’s one of the most important historical places in Kolkata.\n\nIt’s good to know that you cannot enter this monument, but it is worth admiring from the outside.\n\n3. St. Paul’s Cathedral\n\nThe Anglican St. Paul’s Cathedral is one of the largest and oldest churches in India. It was completed in 1847, but it took eight years to build.\n\nYou will find plenty of memorials and relics inside the church. This includes a black cross and other relics that commemorate the Bangladesh War.\n\nSt. Paul’s Cathedral is one of the most impressive colonial buildings in Kolkata, and it’s just a 10-minute walk from Victoria’s Memorial.\n\nTip: Check out Kolkata’s planetarium too while you’re there. It’s next to St. Paul’s Cathedral.\n\n4. Dakshineswar Kali Temple\n\nThis beautiful Hindu temple is located on the banks of the Hooghly River. It was built by Rani Rashmoni, an Indian businesswoman and a devotee of Kali, in 1855.\n\nAccording to the legend, Rani was planning on going on a pilgrimage to Varanasi, but the night before leaving, she dreamt that Kali asked her to build a temple instead, and so she did.\n\nIt’s good to know that you can’t bring your camera or phone inside the temple complex. You will have to leave these in a locker before entering. There is a pond on the left side of the entrance that offers good photo opportunities, though!\n\nTip: A visit to Dakshineswar Kali Temple can easily be combined with a visit to Belur Math (#21 on this list). There’s a ferry that connects both places.\n\n5. Metcalfe Hall\n\nConstructed in British Imperial style in the 19th century, this building was named after Charles T. Metcalfe, Governor-General of India. It initially housed the Calcutta Public Library, which was founded by Metcalfe.\n\nToday, however, you will find a museum housing plenty of artefacts connected to Kolkata’s culture inside Metcalfe Hall.\n\n6. High Court\n\nEstablished in 1862, the Calcutta High Court is the oldest high court in India and it’s huge! It was designed by architect Walter Granville and modelled after the Cloth Hall of Ypres, Belgium (that’s where I’m from!).\n\nThis beautiful building is set in a bustling area, and you will find some of the other monuments in Kolkata that are featured on this list nearby.\n\nAlthough I don’t think you can go inside (I didn’t try, as it’s a court), it is worth seeing the exterior.\n\n7. Howrah Bridge\n\nKolkata’s oldest bridge – the Howrah Bridge – opened in 1943 and replaced a pontoon bridge (floating bridge) that stood in the same location.\n\nThis is one of the most famous landmarks in Kolkata and it’s interesting to note that it’s one of the longest cantilever bridges in the world.\n\nTip: The best way to see Howrah Bridge is by crossing the river on a ferry. These are cheap (around 6 INR and leave regularly).\n\n8. St. John’s Church\n\nSt. John’s Church was completed in 1787, making it one of Kolkata’s oldest churches.\n\nThis church was built on the city’s former burial grounds. Although most of the graves were relocated, the grave of Job Charnock, who is regarded as the founder of Kolkata, can still be found on the church’s grounds.\n\nThis church used to be nicknamed “the stone church”, as it was built from a combination of brick and stone, which was a rare material at the time.\n\nInside the church, you will find the famous painting “Last Supper” by Johann Zoffany, among other artefacts.\n\nMake sure not to miss the room on the right side while you’re here, you will find more artefacts there. I would have missed it if the guard didn’t stop me.\n\n9. Black Hole Monument\n\nThe Black Hole Monument can be found on the grounds of St. John’s Church (#8 on this list). When I first heard its name, this monument was kind of a mystery to me – the Black Hole?\n\nThe Black Hole was actually a dungeon in Fort William where a tragedy took place on the 20th of June 1756. That night, British prisoners of war were held here by troops of the Nawab of Bengal who attacked Calcutta.\n\nIt’s said that 123 of the 146 prisoners died in this dungeon due to suffocation and heat exhaustion. However, the exact numbers are unknown and more recent studies have shown that 64 people were imprisoned in the Black Hole and 21 survived.\n\nThe Black Hole Monument commemorates the victims of this tragic event.\n\n10. Town Hall\n\nKolkata’s Town Hall is located in the heart of the city. It was built by British architect Colonel John Garstin and completed in 1814.\n\nThis beautiful monument flanked by tall columns was the place where balls, concerts, receptions and public meetings were held during the British era. Today, however, you will find a museum and gallery depicting the history of Kolkata inside.\n\n11. General Post Office\n\nKolkata’s General Post Office was built as a post office for the British East India Company in 1868. It’s set in a beautiful building with a domed roof.\n\nApart from posting your package or buying stamps, you can also visit a museum displaying artefacts and stamps inside this building.\n\nThe grounds on which the General Post Office stands are where the first Fort William once stood. The place where Kolkata’s Black Hole (#9 on this list) was can be found in a nearby alley.\n\n>> Read: 11 Monuments in Jaipur You Cannot Miss\n\n12. Royal Insurance Building\n\nThe Edwardian-style Royal Insurance Building is located right next to the General Post Office (#11 on this list).\n\nEstablished in 1845, this was one of British India’s first insurance companies and this building was built as their Calcutta office in 1902. Back in the day, Indians couldn’t buy insurance, though, and only British nationals could get insured here.\n\nApart from being home to Royal Insurance, this building also housed other companies and continues to do so today.\n\n13. Nakhoda Mosque\n\nNakhoda Mosque is one of my favourite monuments in Kolkata. This beautiful mosque was completed in 1926 and it’s the largest one in the state of West Bengal.\n\nIts architecture was inspired by the mausoleum of Mughal Emperor Akbar in Agra. It consists of three domes, two big minarets and an additional 25 smaller minarets.\n\nYou can visit the Nakhoda Mosque inside, but make sure not to be there during prayer time if you want to enter it. Visitors are not allowed inside at that time of the day.\n\n14. South Park Street Cemetery\n\nI’m not sure if a cemetery counts as a monument, but I still think South Park Street Cemetery is worth mentioning in this post.\n\nThis cemetery was built in 1767 and it used to be known as the “Great Christian Burial Ground”. It’s home to numerous graves belonging to British soldiers and their families.\n\nAlthough the cemetery closed in 1790, burials still took place here until the new Lower Circular Road cemetery was built in 1840.\n\nToday, South Park Street Cemetery is often called the most haunted place in Kolkata. So, this is definitely one of the more unusual places to visit in this city (and one of my favourites).\n\n15. Tipu Sultan Shahi Mosque\n\nThis famous mosque was built in 1832 by the son of Tipu Sultan, the ruler of Mysore, in memory of his father. It consists of four minarets and 16 domes, and it can be visited inside.\n\nThe Tipu Sultan Shahi Mosque is close to the Esplanade metro station, in the heart of Kolkata. You will find Shaheed Minar (#18 on this list) nearby.\n\n16. Glorious Dead Monument\n\nThe Glorious Dead Monument is the most famous WWI memorial in Kolkata. It was built in 1924 and commemorates the British and Indian soldiers who died during the war.\n\nThis memorial used to contain plaques with the names of the fallen soldiers, but these were removed and can now be found in the nearby St. John’s Church (#8 on this list).\n\n17. Magen David Synagogue\n\nBuilt in 1884, this beautiful synagogue is the largest of the five synagogues in Kolkata. The Magen David Synagogue was built by Elias Joseph Ezra, who was a member of the most influential Jewish family in Calcutta in the late 19th century.\n\nCalcutta once had a vibrant Jewish community – in the late 18th century, Jewish merchants from Aleppo and Baghdad started settling in this city.\n\nAfter India’s independence in 1947, however, the majority immigrated to Australia, Canada and the U.K., and only an estimated 20 to 30 Jews still live in Kolkata today. For this reason, the synagogue is now maintained by the Muslim community.\n\nTip: Make sure to check out the other synagogue on these grounds too. You will need to climb up a staircase in the corner of the “garden” of the Magen David Synagogue to do so.\n\n18. Shaheed Minar\n\nOriginally known as the Ochterlony Monument, the Shaheed Minar was erected in 1828 in honour of Major-General Sir David Ochterlony, a commander of the British East India Company.\n\nIn 1969, however, this monument was rededicated to the martyrs of the Indian freedom movement, and was renamed “Shaheed Minar”.\n\n>> Read: 17 Things NOT to Do in India\n\n19. Tagore’s House\n\nTagore’s House is also known as Jorasanko Thakurbari and it was built in 1785. This is the ancestral house of the famous poet and Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore.\n\nToday, this house was transformed into a museum dedicated to the life and works of this poet. You will find plenty of artefacts remembering Tagore here, along with his study room and more.\n\nAlthough it is a beautiful monument, this wasn’t my favourite place to visit in Kolkata due to some of the security guards not being very friendly. It’s good to know that you also have to pay an extra fee of 50 INR to take pictures, but can’t take any pictures inside…\n\n20. Indian Museum\n\nThe Indian Museum was built in 1814 and it’s one of the largest museums in India.\n\nNot only will you find plenty of interesting artefacts here, but this museum is also set in a beautiful monument full of massive halls and collonaded pavilions.\n\nYou will find a large collection of armour, antiques, skeletons, mummies and Mughal paintings in the Indian Museum, and it also hosts temporary exhibitions.\n\n21. Belur Math\n\nBelur Math is the headquarters of the Ramakrishna Order, a religious Hindu organization that was founded to spread the teachings of Vedanta – a Hindu philosophical tradition – and to improve the social condition of Indian people.\n\nThis organization has 208 centres all over the world, mainly in India, Bangladesh and the U.S.A.\n\nThe Belur Math complex consists of multiple buildings including the Sri Ramakrishna Temple, Swami Brahmananda Temple and Swami Vivekananda Temple.\n\n2 Famous Monuments in Kolkata that Weren’t Mentioned (+ Why)\n\nFort William\n\nThis is the second Fort William, which was constructed after the Nawab of Bengal attacked the previous one in the 18th century.\n\nI wanted to visit Fort William on a Tuesday afternoon, but turns out you can only visit it on Sunday mornings after filling in a request. The rules are pretty strict as it’s the property of the Indian Army.\n\nMarble Palace Mansion\n\nAlthough the Marble Palace is a beautiful 19th-century neoclassical monument, it cannot be visited right now and you can’t take pictures of it either.\n\nIt’s private property and the guards are very strict. When I was there in 2023, there were construction works and it was closed to the public.\n\n🇮🇳 The Travel Resources I use for India\n\nBy purchasing through the following links, you can support me at no additional cost. 💜\n\n🏨 Booking & Hostelworld: To find the best hotels, hostels and guesthouses\n\n🚃 12GoAsia & Bookaway: To book trains and buses in advance\n\n🛺 Ola: The best ride-hailing app for India\n\n🛫 Skyscanner: To find the cheapest flights\n\n🏕 GetYourGuide & Viator: To book great tours and activities\n\n💰 Heymondo: One of the best-reviewed travel insurance companies (get 5% off with this link!)\n\n📋 Don’t forget to check if you need a visa to visit India.\n\nMonuments in Kolkata: Final Thoughts\n\nThere you have it – a list containing 21 of the most beautiful monuments in Kolkata.
