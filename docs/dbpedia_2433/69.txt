Victoria Memorial Kolkata: Historical Background

The Victoria Memorial is a striking reminder of the British Raj, which lasted from 1858 to 1947. During this period, India was under British colonial rule, and the country underwent significant changes in terms of governance, architecture, and culture. The memorial was built to honor Queen Victoria, who reigned over the British Empire from 1837 to 1901, during a time when India was an integral part of the empire.

The idea for the Victoria Memorial was conceived shortly after Queen Victoria’s death in 1901. Lord Curzon, the Viceroy of India, proposed the construction of a grand monument in her honor, and the foundation stone was laid in 1906. The architectural design for the memorial was undertaken by Sir William Emerson, an accomplished architect of the time, who combined elements of Indo-Saracenic and Renaissance styles to create a unique and awe-inspiring structure.
