        "text": "Rosalind Chao Traditional Chinese 趙家玲 Simplified Chinese 赵家玲\n\nTranscriptions Standard Mandarin Hanyu Pinyin Zhào Jiā líng Wade–Giles Ch`ao Chia-lin Yale Romanization Chau Jyalin\n\nRosalind Chao (Chinese: 趙家玲; born September 23, 1957) is an American actress. Chao's best-known roles have been Soon-Lee Klinger in the mid-1980s CBS show AfterMASH, Rose Hsu Jordan in the 1993 movie The Joy Luck Club, the recurring character Keiko O'Brien on Star Trek: The Next Generation and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine in the 1990s, and Dr. Kim on The O.C. in 2003. She also played Hua Li, Mulan’s mother, in the live-action 2020 remake of Mulan.\n\nEarly life\n\nChao was born in Anaheim, California. Chao's parents ran a successful pancake restaurant, Chao’s Chinese and American Restaurant, across the street from Disneyland, and employed her there from an early age. She attended Pomona College in Claremont, California, and later USC, graduating in 1978.\n\nCareer\n\nChao's parents were instrumental in her decision to pursue acting; she began at the age of five in a California-based Peking opera traveling company at the instigation of her parents who were already heavily involved, and during the summers they sent her to Taiwan to further develop her acting skills.\n\nAs a child she played the daughter of a laundry owner (played by James Hong) on the 1970 episode of Here's Lucy entitled \"Lucy the Laundress\".\n\nDeciding not to pursue acting, Chao enrolled in the communications department at the University of Southern California where she earned her degree in journalism. However, after spending a year as a radio newswriting intern at the CBS-owned Hollywood radio station KNX, she soon returned to acting.\n\nHer big break was with the role of Soon-Lee, a South Korean refugee, in the final episodes of the TV series M*A*S*H. Soon-Lee married longtime starring character Maxwell Klinger (Jamie Farr) in the series finale \"Goodbye, Farewell and Amen\", the most-watched U.S. sitcom television episode of all time as of 2021. Chao continued playing the character in the M*A*S*H sequel: 1983's AfterMASH, her first role billed at co-starring status.\n\nChao regularly portrayed the Japanese exo-botanist Keiko Ishikawa O'Brien on both Star Trek: The Next Generation and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine with eight appearances in the former and nineteen in the latter before DS9's end in 1999. In 2010, a preliminary casting memo for The Next Generation from 1987 was published, revealing that Chao was originally considered for the part of Enterprise security chief Tasha Yar.\n\nIn August 2018, Chao was cast as Mulan's mother in the 2020 live-action retelling of Mulan. In 2019, Chao was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences citing her contributions to critically acclaimed films The Joy Luck Club and I Am Sam.\n\nPersonal life\n\nWhile working in theatre at the Mark Taper Forum, Chao met Simon Templeman; the couple would eventually marry. They have two children, a son and a daughter.\n\nFilmography\n\nFilm\n\nYear Film Role Notes 1980 The Big Brawl Mae 1981 Spider-Man: The Dragon's Challenge Emily Chan 1981 An Eye for an Eye Linda Chen 1983 Going Berserk Kung Fu Girl 1987 Slam Dance Mrs. Bell The Tribulations of a Chinese Gentleman Lianhua 1988 White Ghost Thi Hau 1990 Denial Terry Thousand Pieces of Gold Lalu Nathoy/Polly Bemis 1992 Memoirs of an Invisible Man Cathy DiTolla 1993 The Joy Luck Club Rose 1994 North Chinese Mom Love Affair Lee 1997 The End of Violence Claire 1998 What Dreams May Come Leona 2000 Enemies of Laughter Carla 2001 The Man from Elysian Fields Female Customer Impostor Newscaster Uncredited I Am Sam Lily 2003 Freaky Friday Pei-Pei 2005 Life of the Party Mei Lin Just like Heaven Fran 2007 Nanking Chang Yu Zheng 2009 The Rising Tide Narrator 2012 Knife Fight Kate - Focus Group Moderator 2015 Stockholm, Pennsylvania Dr. Andrews 2017 Tragedy Girls Mayor Campbell 2019 Plus One Angela The Laundromat Gu Kailai 2020 Mulan Hua Li Magic Camp Lorraine Uncredited 2021 Together Together Dr. Andrews The Starling Fawn\n\nTelevision\n\nYear Film Role Notes 1970 Here's Lucy Linda Wong 1 episode 1972 Anna and the King Princess Serana 1 episode 1973 Kung Fu Dancer 1 episode, uncredited 1976 ABC Afterschool Specials The Kurmese Ambassador's Daughter 1 episode 1977 The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries Lily Episode: \"The Secret of the Jade Kwan Yin\" Kojak Grace Chen Episode: \"The Summer of '69: Part 1\" 1978 The Incredible Hulk Receptionist Episode: \"Married\" 1979 How the West Was Won Li Sin Episode: \"China Girl\" The Ultimate Imposter Lai-Ping Television film Emergency!
