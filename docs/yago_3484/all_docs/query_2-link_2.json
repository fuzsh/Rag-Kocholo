        "text": "Real world article\n\n(written from a production point of view)\n\nRosalind Chao (born 23 September 1957; age 66) is an actress who played Keiko O'Brien in Star Trek: The Next Generation and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. She appeared in eight episodes of Next Generation and nineteen episodes of Deep Space Nine. She also played a Pah-wraith (possessing Keiko O'Brien) in the Deep Space Nine fifth season episode \"The Assignment\".\n\nBefore being cast as Keiko in the episode \"Data's Day\", she originally auditioned and was considered for the role of Natasha Yar, according to a 1987 studio memo. [1] Her costume from \"Data's Day\" was later sold off on the web. [2]\n\nLife and career[]\n\nChao was born in Anaheim, California to Chinese parents (unlike her Star Trek character who is a Japanese national), who were performers at the Beijing Opera before immigrating to the United States where they opened a successful pancake business. She began acting at the age of five.\n\nShe earned a journalism degree at the University of Southern California, however, after a year as a radio newswriting intern at the CBS-owned Hollywood radio station KNX, she returned to acting.\n\nChao has been married to actor and fellow Next Generation guest star Simon Templeman since 1989. They have a son and a daughter.\n\nShe has remained friends with her Star Trek \"husband\", Colm Meaney and attended his wedding in Beverly Hills on March 15, 2007. At Grand Slam XV, Meaney said \"It was lovely having my TV wife at my wedding\". [3]\n\nTelevision[]\n\nHer first credited screen role was in a 1970 episode of Lucille Ball's series, Here's Lucy, entitled \"Lucy the Laundress\" (directed by Herb Kenwith). Her first major acting role was in the 1972 television series Anna and the King, in which she played Princess Serena.

Wendy Schaal, Anne Haney, and Noble Willingham appeared in recurring roles and William Sadler, Jerry Hardin, K Callan, David Graf, Biff Yeager, Eve Smith, Armin Shimerman, Leslie Bevis, Paul Willson, and Danny Nero played guest roles on this show.\n\nChao also had recurring roles on other popular series, such as Diff'rent Strokes, in which she played Miss Chung, and Falcon Crest, in which she played Li Ying (starring Robert Foxworth, with Concetta Tomei and Jill Jacobson, directed by Reza Badiyi).\n\nIn the 1980s, Chao guested on series such as St. Elsewhere (starring William Daniels, Norman Lloyd, Ed Begley, Jr., and with Kavi Raz, Jennifer Savidge, France Nuyen, and Alfre Woodard), The A-Team (starring Dwight Schultz, with Jeff Imada, directed by Robert Bralver), Max Headroom (starring Matt Frewer, with Concetta Tomei, George Coe, Andreas Katsulas, W. Morgan Sheppard, and Charles Rocket), Beauty and the Beast (starring Ron Perlman, with Keye Luke), Tour of Duty (with Lloyd Kino), and Miami Vice (with Bob Gunton and James Saito).\n\nIn the 1990s, aside her Star Trek role, Chao mostly played one-time guest roles on television, which included episodes of Thirtysomething (with David Clennon), Murder, She Wrote (with Daphne Ashbrook and Wayne Péré), Chicago Hope (starring Jayne Brook), and ER (with Lily Mariye and Bob Minor).\n\nIn the next decade, Chao had recurring roles on 10-8: Officers on Duty (with Jeff Kober, Albie Selznick, and Karole Selmon), Six Feet Under (with James Cromwell, Joanna Cassidy, Danny Goldring, Andy Milder, Abby Brammell, and Ellen Albertini Dow), and The O.C.
