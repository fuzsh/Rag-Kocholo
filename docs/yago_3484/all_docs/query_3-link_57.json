        "text": "The English seem to have a special way of talking with God. In David Hare's highly acclaimed play, four men--an inner-city rector, a curate, a bishop, and a lowly cleric--question their personal faith and resolve as they run up against the established hierarchy in this 1990 post-Thatcher-era examination of the Church of England. The perfectly voiced British actors Martin Jarvis, OBE, and Jared Harris (\"Mad Men\") lead an outstanding ensemble in giving a lively, theatrical feel to this solid adaptation. Audio drama is at its best when projecting aural intimacy and intensity. When these characters take on such hot-button issues as gay marriage, women in the priesthood, and abortion, the play seems as relevant as it did during the time it was written. B.P.
