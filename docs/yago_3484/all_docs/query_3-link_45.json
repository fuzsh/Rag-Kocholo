        "text": "The Templemans of Merriott\n\nEarliest Mention in Merriott Records – the 17th Century\n\nThe Templeman family appeared from the earliest times in the Parish Registers, as well as being mentioned in the Hearth Tax Rolls for 1664-5. Most of the males seem to have married outside the Parish. By the middle of the 19th Century there are very few mentions of the surname in Merriott; only one in the records of the 20th Century. Some of the Templemans were well-to-do, owning land. Templeman’s Lane is presumably named after the family.\n\nThree Templeman males are mentioned in the 1685 Monmouth Roll of Rebels: (see also: The Monmouth Rebellion)\n\nTempleman, John, of Merriott rebel in Monmouth’s army and not taken(CP); proposed for pardon; rick of wheat confiscated Jan. 12 (TB); pardon of all treasons, April 14 1686 (CSPD, J2, II, 404)\n\nTempleman, Richard, of Merriott rebel in Monmouth’s army and not taken (CP).\n\nTempleman, Thomas, of Merriott rebel in Monmouth’s army and not taken (CP).\n\nThe Somerset Record Office holds the following items:\n\nDDSP/1693/5 Inventory for Thomas Templeman of Merriott, dated 1693.\n\nQ/SR/98/82: Examinations. Evidence is given by Wilmont Pitcher of Merriott that she is with child by William Tempelman the younger of Merriott, Girthwebb (?) weaver, who had carnal knowledge of the informant’s body in Crewkerne field. Dated 15 November 1658. A later piece:\n\nQ/SR/98/25: Calendar of prisoners in the common gaol at Ilchester to appear before the Quarter sessions on 12 April 1659 taken by William Lacy, High Sheriff of Somerset. Prisoners include: William (? Wilmont) Pitcher of Merriott, Single Woman. Dated: 1659.\n\nQ/SR/111/2-3 Information and Examinations. Evidence given by John Templeman, Robert Lawrence and Simon Templeman, all of Merriott, in a case concerning the alleged theft of faggots by Ames Lawrence, of same. JP: Edward Phellipps. Dated 10 June 1668.\n\nQ/SR/303/132: Examination and confession. Evidence given by Elizabeth Annly, formerly in service with John Templeman of Merriott, in which she confesses to having taken items of clothing from her master’s house and hidden them in a hedge. JPs: Adam Martin, John Rodbard. Dated 10 Sep 1735.\n\nThe National Archives has the will of John Templeman, husbandman of Merriott, dated 22 Nov 1586.

The vicar wrote the following:\n\n” NB John Templeman obtained my permission to make a vault beneath his pew for the internment of his brother Richard Templeman, and likewise had a faculty from Wells for that pew and vault adjoining the 7th… (illegible) pillar on the right hand as you enter the Church for which privilege he paid me five guineas.\n\nNB No sooner had Mr Templeman been indulged in his wishes respecting the pew and vault than he raises his pew about a foot higher than the other pews in the same direction, which has much obstructed my seeing the congregation – I observed to him the impropriety of his elevating his pew, as no such grant was given him in the faculty – to which he replied he would raise it and I might do my worst. In consequence of this impertinence I had the pew lowered to the size of those before & behind it. NB The pew behind Mr Templeman’s between it and the door has no concern with the faculty – but belongs to the Parish at large.”\n\nMALES – 24 FEMALES – 25\n\n4 October 1724 Bernard Templeman\n\n5 February 1783 Francis Templeman\n\n24 April 1705 Giles Templeman\n\n11 May 1710 Giles Templeman\n\n8 June 1717 Giles Templeman\n\n6 April 1781 Giles Templeman\n\n31 May 1783 Giles Templeman\n\n12 October 1724 John Templeman Snr\n\n29 June 1758 John Templeman\n\n5 December 1791 John Templeman\n\n19 March 1737 Nicholas Templeman\n\n18 February 1726 Richard Templeman\n\n19 May 1772 Richard Templeman\n\n5 February 1793 Richard Templeman\n\n3 May 1729 Robert Templeman\n\n29 October 1779 Robt Templeman\n\n8 June 1759 Thomas Templeman\n\n4 February 1773 Thomas Templeman\n\n19 January 1779 Thomas Templeman\n\n1 November 1703 William Templeman\n\n1 August 1741 William Templeman\n\n6 February 1780 William Templeman\n\n5 January 1785 William Templeman\n\n5 June 1794 William Templeman 5 June 1781 Alice Templeman\n\n8 April 1791 Ann Templeman\n\n21 March 1735 Dorothy Templeman\n\n13 January 1706 Edith Templeman\n\n28 October 1733 Eliz Templeman\n\n2 January 1731 Fortune Templeman Leckey?\n\n15 January 1731 Fortune Templeman\n\n6 October 1765 Fortune Templeman\n\n3 May 1711 Joan Templeman Wife of Will\n\n22 August 1731 Joan Templeman\n\n15 June 1764 Katharine Templeman\n\n26 October 1712 Lydia Templeman\n\n7 March 1798 Martha Templeman\n\n19 January 1701 Mary Templeman\n\n28 May 1719 Mary Templeman\n\n17 January 1730 Mary Templeman\n\n9 January 1741 Mary Templeman\n\n8 March 1749 Mary Templeman\n\n12 April 1758 Mary Templeman\n\n14 February 1812 Mary Templeman\n\n12 November 1705 Sarah Templeman\n\n17 February 1717 Sarah Templeman\n\n19 May 1769 Sarah Templeman, widow\n\n15 March 1792 Sarah Templeman\n\n1 January 1748 Susannah Templeman\n\nTEMPLEMAN in Merriott in the 19th Century\n\nMARRIAGES\n\nMALES – 1 21 May 1801 William Templeman m Ann Higgins (Crewkerne) [Witness: John Higgins] FEMALES – 3 10 December 1804 Mary Templeman m William Rendall (Hinton St George) [Witness: Hannah Murly]\n\n10 November 1818 Mary Templeman m John Barnes\n\n19 September 1822 Sarah Templeman m Samuel Brown * Note: I believe this Sarah is daughter of Robert Templeman & Mary Brown,\n\nbapt 29 May 1876.
