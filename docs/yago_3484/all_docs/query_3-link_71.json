She was unlike any other women I had ever met.\n\n“She was beautiful. She was bright. She was witty. She was down to earth. She was fun. And she had eyes made of magic.”\n\nDo Richard Branson and Joan Templeman have children?\n\nBranson and Templeman have a daughter named Holly who was born in 1981 and a son named Sam who was born in 1985.\n\nDuring an interview with Piers Morgan Branson said the pair also had a daughter named Clare Sarah, who died when she was four days old in 1979.\n\nHolly fullfilled her childhood dream of becoming a doctor and now holds a posistion at her father's company.\n\nSam is an actor and the co-founder of a production company called Sundog Pictures"
