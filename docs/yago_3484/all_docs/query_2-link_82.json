        "text": "It was today, September 23rd, back in 1957, that Star Trek: The Next Generation and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine actor - and on-screen wife of Colm Meaney - Rosalind Chao was born.\n\nStar Trek fans know Chao as Keiko O’Brien. She joined the cast of Star Trek: The Next Generation in the season four episode “Data’s Day” and eventually moved with her on-screen husband over to Deep Space Nine, where she stayed through the end of the series.\n\nOutside of Star Trek, Chao has had an extensive film and television career, with acting credits spanning more than four decades. Some of her most notable roles include the film The Joy Luck Club, the TV series The O.C., and most recently, her role as Hua Li, Mulan’s mother in the live-action Disney remake of their hit animated film Mulan.\n\nPlease join me in wishing Rosalind Chao a very happy 63rd birthday."
