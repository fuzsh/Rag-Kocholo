        "text": "Transitioning from ubiquitous and wearable computing research to business practice\n\nThe research communities of ubicomp and ISWC researchers have been anticipating various trends, such as wearable technologies, hands-free interfaces, bring-your-own device, and navigation systems, by more than a decade ago. Prototypes once evaluated in user studies with 20 students get downloaded as an app, activity recognition algorithms can be sourced in chipsets, and hardware prototyping platforms become available as smart thing infrastructures. Whereas consumer-focused industries may benefit from these trends more directly, also professional domains in industry are starting to adapt ubicomp and wearable technologies.\n\nIt is the goal of this panel to collect use cases of successful transitions from research to practice, to understand the challenges of moving from research to product, and to identify open research question yet to be solved.\n\nThe panel brings a number of experts from the fields together to discuss"
