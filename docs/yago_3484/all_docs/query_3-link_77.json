        "text": "Rosalind Chao or Chao Jyalin (趙家玲 Pinyin: Zhào Jīalín) is a Chinese American actress born in Anaheim, California.\n\nHer birthday is somewhat of a mystery. Different sources give 1956; September 23, 1957; September 23, 1959; or September 29, 1964.\n\nHer parents were amateurs in Beijing opera singing, and Rosalind Chao was in some small roles of some operas as a girl. She started shooting commercials at 7. After she graduated from Pomona College, her TV career began.\n\nChao played as Keiko O'Brien (née Ishikawa), a Japanese botanist, in Star Trek: The Next Generation and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, the founder and teacher of a school, the wife of engineer Miles O'Brien, and a mother of two.\n\nChao also appeared in both the television series M*A*S*H and its spinoff, AfterMASH. She first appeared in M*A*S*H during the last several episodes of the series as Soon-Lee, a Korean woman who fell in love and married Maxwell Klinger. In AfterMASH, she and Klinger moved to America where Klinger went to work for his former Commanding Officer, Colonel Potter.\n\nChao plays one of the eight main characters in The Joy Luck Club. However, her favourite role is a minor one in What Dreams May Come, where she played flight attendant Leona, the physical manifestation of the protagonist's dead daughter.\n\nChao has also guest-starred in The West Wing as Jane Gentry, and several episodes of The O.C. as Dr. Kim.\n\nRosalind Chao is a mother with her husband Simon Templeman.\n\nExternal Links"
