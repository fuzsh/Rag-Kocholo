She didn't have many lines... as she was playing a patient that was waiting for Dr. Sloan to construct her a new voice box.\n\nAnd of course Mary McDonnell of nuBSG was on the show again!\n\nSpeaking of Rosalind, many may not be aware that she married Klinger on M*A*S*H, which is also one of my favorite all time TV series.\n\nResistance is Futile\n\nSpeaking of Rosalind, many may not be aware that she married Klinger on M*A*S*H, which is also one of my favorite all time TV series.\n\nResistance is Futile\n\nActually, Rosalind Chao's character on M*A*S*H married Corporal Klinger, and not the actual actor who played him.\n\nI also recently watched a documentary called Nanking in which Ms. Chao was one of the actresses who dramatized the horrific invasion of the Japanese army into Nanking China in 1937.\n\n^Actually, Klinger was a Sergeant at the time.\n\nAnyway, I missed her on Grey's Anatomy, but yeah I did notice her on M*A*S*H not too long ago\n\nWhen I submitted my post I was thinking that some people may think that she had married Jamie Farr, who played Maxwell Klinger. I meant to clarify it, but never got around to it. Thanks for doing it for me\n\nAm I the only one who was disappointed when Sloan successfully restored her voice?\n\nI was holding out hope that Keiko would finally shut the hell up..."
