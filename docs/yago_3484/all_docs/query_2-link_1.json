        "text": "Along with Michael Dorn, Marc Alaimo, Jeffrey Combs, John de Lancie, Jonathan Frakes and Tim Russ, she is one of only seven actors to appear in at least ten different seasons of \"Star Trek\": Raumschiff Enterprise: Das nächste Jahrhundert (1987) Seasons Four through Six and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (1993) Seasons One through Seven.\n\nWhile auditioning for the part of Keiko O'Brien on Raumschiff Enterprise: Das nächste Jahrhundert (1987), she was up against actress Patti Yasutake, who also auditioned for the role. Rosalind eventually got the role, and Patti got the part of \"Nurse Allysa Ogawa\" on the same show.\n\nWhen I leave Los Angeles to do something, that's when I notice how into \"Star Trek\" and how loyal to the shows' actors the fans are. The fans will notice me on the street and ask me questions about Keiko's personal relationships, especially the female fans. They're very concerned, because they want her to maintain her career. They always talk to me about that. It's very funny.\n\nWhen they offered me the role as a regular on Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (1993), I was actually pregnant with my first child and I was also getting ready to do Töchter des Himmels (1993). So I had to say no to the producers at that point. I wanted to be able to spend time with my husband and with my first child right after he was born. And I did. I really think it worked out well for everyone.\n\n[on filming a scene in the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (1993) episode, Time's Orphan (1998)] We were shooting at Griffith Park, when we were doing the picnic scene. I had some speech to make, and I noticed people talking behind the camera, which was very unusual because the \"Deep Space Nine\" crew was very professional. And I noticed people moving around. It turned out that a rattler had been, like, this far away from me, as we were shooting. And nobody cut and had me move! Colm [Colm Meaney] just got up and got out of the way, they got the kid out of the way, and nobody said word one to me! Can you imagine?"
