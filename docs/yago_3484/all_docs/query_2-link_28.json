While on set, Brennan intervenes after finding flaws with the actorsâ performances, not to mention the filmâs total disregard for science. Then she discovers that the prop cadaver being used is an actual murder victim, forcing her and Booth to launch an investigation that has real-world consequences in the land of make-believe. Meanwhile, Booth is offered a job on the studio lot, and embarrassing information is revealed about Camâs past.\n\nThe Same as Air\n\nWillis and Rox arrive at a road-rage accident that has caused multiple serious injuries; Elliot doubts his ability as a doctor when he's sued for his role in the death of the SWAT officer involved in the drug bust-turned-shootout."
