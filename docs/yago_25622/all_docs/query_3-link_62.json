        "text": "Michel Boudrot, born probably at Cougnes, near La Rochelle, France, in c1600, came to Port-Royal in the late 1630s and married Michelle Aucoin at Port-Royal in c1641. Michelle was sister of Jeanne Aucoin, wife of fellow colonist François Girouard. Michel Boudrot served as one of the first syndics (similar to a present-day mayor) of Port-Royal. In 1684, he was serving as lieutenant général civil et criminel du Port-Royal, or general representative of the King for justice, at the colony's capital. In August 1688, he gave up his post as lieutenant général because of his \"great age\"; he was 88. He died not long afterwards. His wife Michelle, two decades his junior, lived until December 1706, when she died at Port-Royal, age 85. She and Michel raised 11 children. Their four daughters married into the Robichaud, Thériot, Bourg, Babineau, and Poirier families. Their seven sons, all born at Port-Royal, created families of their own:\n\nOldest son Charles, born in c1646, married Renée, daughter of Antoine Bourg and Antoinette Landry, at Port-Royal in c1672. They had eight children before she died. Charles remarried to Marie, daughter of Jean Corporon and Françoise Savoie, probably at Port-Royal in c1686. Charles and his family settled at Ste.-Famille, Pigiguit, in the Minas Basin. In all, Charles fathered 20 children, including eight sons who married into the Rivet, Corporon, Sonnier, Vincent, Hébert, Brassaud, Doiron, and LeBlanc families. Charles's daughters married into the Trahan, Babin, Thibodeau, Bugeaud, and Girouard families.\n\nJean, born in c1655, married Marguerite, daughter of Jacques Bourgeois and Jeanne Trahan, at Port-Royal in c1676. They settled at Chignecto, but Jean died a few years after his marriage and fathered no sons. Jean's daughter married into the Arseneau family.\n\nAbraham, born in c1657, married Cécile, daughter of Charles Melanson and Marie Dugas, at Port-Royal in c1686 and remained at Port-Royal, where he was a prominent merchant and an erstwhile spy for Acadia's Governor Villebon during King William's War. Abraham fathered six children, including three sons who married into the Landry and Broussard families. His daughters married into the Gaudet, Mius d'Entremont, and Bourg families. Abraham died by c1703, when Cécile remarried at Port-Royal.\n\nMichel, fils, born in c1659, moved to Chignecto and married Marie-Madeleine, daughter of Thomas Cormier and Marie-Madeleine Girouard, at Chignecto in c1690. Michel, fils fathered seven children, including four sons who married into the Caissie, Gaudet, Belliveau, and Hébert families. His daughters married into the Chiasson, Lambert, and LeBlanc families.\n\nOlivier, born in c1661, married Elisabeth, also called Isabelle, daughter of Claude Petitpas and Catherine Bugaret, at Port-Royal in c1686 and also remained at Port-Royal Olivier died by 1690, when his wife remarried. He fathered only a single son, who probably died young.\n\nClaude, born in c1663, married Anne-Marie, daughter of Pierre Thibodeau and Jeanne Thériot, at Port-Royal in c1682 and moved to Rivière-des-Habitants in the Minas Basin. He remarried to Catherine, daughter of Jean Meunier and Marguerite Housseau, probably at Minas in c1700, and remarried again--his third marriage--to Madeleine, another daughter of Jean Corporon, and widow of Bernard Doucet dit Laverdure and François Leclerk dit Laverdure, at Port-Royal in August 1735. Claude fathered 21 children by his first two wives, including nine sons who married into the Hébert, Préjean, Comeau, Aucoin, Doiron, Thibodeau, Gautrot, and Doucet families. His daughters married into the Hébert, Aucoin, LeBlanc, Daigre, and Doiron families. Claude died at Grand-Pré in March 1740, in his late 70s.\n\nYoungest son François, born in c1666, married Madeleine, daughter of Jean Belliveau and Jeanne Bourg, at Port-Royal in c1692 and remained for a time at Port-Royal with two of his older brothers. He fathered nine children, including three sons who married into the Dugas, Petitot dit Saint-Seine, Melanson, and Belliveau families, and perhaps into the LeBlanc family as well. His daughters married into the LeBlanc, Michel, and Dugas families. François died at Port-Royal in September 1733, age 66.\n\nBy the early 1700s, then, Michel Boudrot's many sons could be found at Port-Royal, Chignecto, Grand-Pré, and Pigiguit, where their children grew up and had children of their own. Soon after the British gained possession of the colony in 1714, Boudrots spread out even farther from the family base at Port-Royal. Some of them left peninsula Nova Scotia and moved to Île St.-Jean, today's Prince Edward Island, and Île Royale, now Cape Breton Island, probably to escape British authority. In August 1714, Charles dit Charlot, a navigator and shipbuilder, son of Abraham of Port-Royal, received permission from French authorities at Louisbourg to settle on Île Royale; he and his family were counted at Port-Toulouse, now St. Peter's, Cape Breton Island, in 1717. He died there nine years later. Other Boudrots were counted at Port-Toulouse in the same census, including Charles dit Charlot's brother Michel dit Miquetau, a navigator and shipbuilder, and their uncle François, a shipbuilder. François dit Manne, Charles dit Charlot's brother and a shipbuilder as well, moved to Île St.-Jean in the early 1720s and then on to Port-Toulouse by 1722, where he joined his brothers. One of Michel, fils's sons, Claude le jeune, a navigator, moved from Chignecto to Port-Toulouse by 1724, and then moved on to Tracadie near Havre-St.-Pierre on Île St.-Jean in the early 1730s. Other Boudrots from Port-Royal and Chignecto also settled at Port-Toulouse. Their cousins from Minas and Pigiguit went to the Maritime islands as well. By the early 1750s, Boudrots could be found not only at Tracadie but also at Port-La-Joye, Havre-St.-Pierre, Grande-Anse, Anse Pinnet, La Traverse, Rivière du Nord-Est, and Rivière-du-Moulin-à-Scie on Île St.-Jean, and at Port-d'Orléans and Louisbourg on Île Royale.\n\n[For more of this family in pre- and post-dispersal Acadia and Canada, see Book Three]\n\nBy 1755, descendants of Michel Boudrot could be found in nearly every major Acadian community: at Annapolis Royal, Grand-Pré and Pigiguit in the Minas Basin, Chignecto at the head of the Bay of Fundy, and on Île St.-Jean and Île Royale.\n\nLE GRAND DÉRANGEMENT\n\n[For the family's travails in the Great Upheaval, see Book Six]\n\nLOUISIANA: WESTERN SETTLEMENTS\n\nBoudrots, three of them, were among the earliest Acadians to seek refuge in Louisiana. They came from Halifax via Cap-Français, French St.-Domingue, with the Beausoleil Broussards and reached New Orleans in February 1765. After a short respite in the city, they followed the Broussards across the Atchafalaya Basin to the Attakapas District and helped created La Nouvelle-Acadie on the banks of Bayou Teche:\n\nJean Boudrot, age 25, wife Marguerite Guilbeau of Port-Royal, age 19, and son Jean-Charles dit Donat, age 4, followed the Guilbeaus to the lower Mississippi valley. Jean and Marguerite had no more children in Louisiana. Jean died at Attakapas in c1768; he was only in his late 20s. Jean-Charles dit Donat was his only child and carried on the line in the Attakapas District.\n\nAnne Boudrot, age 55, widow of Charles Bourg of Île St.-Jean, came to the colony with five children, two sons and three daughters, ages 18 to 12, all born on Île St.-Jean. Evidently Anne and her three youngest children retreated to Cabanocé on the river in the autumn of 1765 to escape an epidemic that killed dozens of their fellow Teche valley Acadians. By the late 1760s, however, Anne had returned to the upper Teche to live with married daughter Gertrude, who had remained there; Anne's sons followed her back to the prairies and settled in the Opelousas District, where two of her other daughters also settled.\n\nDescendants of Jean-Charles dit Donat BOUDREAUX (c1763-1807; Michel, François, Michel)\n\nJean-Charles dit Donat, only son of Jean Boudrot and Marguerite Guilbeau, was born at Halifax in the early 1760s, though a Louisiana church record hints that he may have been born in Boston. Donat was still a boy when his father died at Attakapas. He grew up as an only child in the Attakapas District, raised by his mother and stepfather, Simon LeBlanc, who also had come to Louisiana with the Broussards in February 1765. Donat married Anne-Dorothée, called Dorothée, daughter of fellow Acadians Charles Comeaux and Anastasie Savoie of the Opelousas District, in c1785. Donat and Dorothée, a native of Opelousas, settled along upper Bayou Vermilion, at the northern edge of the Attakapas District. Their daughters married into the Blanchet, Broussard, Langlinais, and Mouton families. Donat died at this home on the upper Vermilion in June 1807; he was only 45 years old. Dorothéeremarried too Jean-Louis Langlinais of St.-Servan, France, who became one of her daughter's father-in-law. Donat's sons settled in Lafayette and Vermilion parishes.\n\n1\n\nOldest son Jean-Baptiste, called Jean, born at Opelousas in March 1788, married Marguerite, daughter of fellow Acadian Marin dit Capuchon Mouton and his first wife, French Creole Marie-Josèphe Lambert, at Attakapas in October 1804; Marguerite was the sister of Jean's brother-in-law, Salvator Mouton. Jean and Marguerite settled at Bas Vermilion, or the lower Vermilion, south of present-day Lafayette. Their son Jean Léon was born in St. Martin Parish in October 1805, Joseph Drosin, called Drosin, in October 1807, François Onésime, called Onésime, in July 1810, Charles Sosthène, called Sosthène, in June 1813, Symphorien in April 1815, Toussaint in October 1819, and Sevenne was baptized at the Vermilionville church, Lafayette Parish, at age 13 months in May 1830. Their daughters married into the Blanchet, Broussard, De Franc, Roy, and Suzanne families. Jean's succession record was filed at the Vermilionville courthouse in November 1841; he would have been 53 years old that year. In October 1850, the federal census taker in Vermilion Parish counted 19 slaves on Widow Jean Boudreaux's farm in Ward One of the parish's Western District, next to Sevenne Boudreaux; these probably were Marguerite Mouton's slaves.\n\n1a\n\nDrosin married Adélaïde, daughter of fellow Acadians Charles Duhon and Élisabeth Broussard, at the Vermilionville church, Lafayette Parish, in February 1826. Their son Euclide was born in Lafayette Parish in July 1827, Edgard was baptized at the Vermilionville church, age 7 1/2 months, in October 1834, and Sevenne le jeune was born in May 1843. They also had a son named Jules. Their daughters married into the Melançon, Mouton, and Servat families. In August 1850, the federal census taker in Lafayette Parish counted 5 slaves--3 males and 2 females, all black, ranging in age from 50 to 10--on Drauzin J. Boudreaux's farm next to Euclide Boudreaux in the parish's Western District. In July 1860, the federal census taker in Lafayette Parish counted 7 slaves--3 females and 4 males, 3 blacks and 4 mulattoes, ages 70 to 1, living in a single house--on Drauzin Boudreaux's farm next to Chs. Marin Mouton and near Augustin Boudreau, probably his uncle.\n\nEuclide married Onésima, also called Lisemène, daughter of Onésime Baudoin and Marcelitte Dartes, at the Vermilionville church, Lafayette Parish, in April 1847. In August 1850, the federal census taker in Lafayette Parish counted a single slave--a 24-year-old black male--on Euclide Boudreau's farm between Drauzin J. Boudreau and Bélonie Bodouin in the parish's Western District. Euclide died in Lafayette Parish in August 1853; he was only 26 years old; his succession record was filed at the Vermilionville courthouse that month.\n\nEdgard married Elmire or Elvira, daughter of French Creole Jean Dartes and his Acadian wife Marie Mouton, at the Abbeville church, Vermilion Parish, in February 1854. Their son Marcus was born near Abbeville in January 1859, and Séverin in September 1862. Edgard may have remarried to fellow Acadian Émilie Guidry. Their son Euclyde was born near Abbeville in September 1866.\n\nDuring the War of 1861-65, Sevenne le jeune, a resident of Vermilion Parish at the time of his enlistment, may have served as a corporal in Company A of the 8th Regiment Louisiana Cavalry, raised in Rapides Parish, which fought in Louisiana. Sevenne le jeune married Euphémie, daughter of fellow Acadians Onésime Melançon and Marie Prejean, at the Youngsville church, Lafayette Parish, in February 1867 (according to local records, the marriage was not civilly recorded until February 1869).\n\nJules married cousin Marie Azélima or Angelina, daughter of Placide Montet and his Acadian wife Azelie Duhon, at the Youngsville church, Lafayette Parish, in June 1865. Their son Philippe Mozart was born near Youngsville in October 1868.\n\n1b\n\nJean Léon married Pauline, daughter of Hippolyte Mallet and Céleste Fabre of Baton Rouge, at the Vermilionville church, Lafayette Parish, in August 1828. Their son Jean Léo was baptized at the Vermilionville church, age 3 months, in September 1829, Marcel at age 5 months in April 1833, and Dupréville at age 14 months in January 1835.\n\n1c\n\nFrançois Onésime married Anastasie, daughter of fellow Acadian Jean Trahan and his Creole wife Césaire Baudoin, at the Vermilionville church, Lafayette Parish, in April 1830. Their son Onésime, fils was born in Lafayette Parish in March 1834, and Théosime was baptized at the Vermilionville church, age 5 months, in March 1836. François Onésime died by November 1840, when his succession rwas filed at the Vermilionville courthouse; he would have been age 30 that year.\n\nOnésime, fils may have married fellow Acadian Ezilda Broussard and settled near Abbeville, Vermilion Parish, in the late 1850s.\n\nDuring the War of 1861-65, Théosime, called Théorime in Confederate records, may have served in Company K of the Consolidated 18th Regiment and Yellow Jacket Battalion Louisiana Infantry, which fought in Louisiana.\n\n1d\n\nCharles Sosthène married Anastasie, daughter of fellow Acadians Éloi Broussard and Marguerite Thibodeaux, at the Vermilionville church, Lafayette Parish, in August 1831. Their son Charles Sosthène, fils was baptized at the Vermilionville church, age 2 1/2 months, in October 1834. Their daughter married into the Guidry family. In November 1850, the federal census taker in Vermilion Parish counted 8 slaves--3 males and 5 females, all black, ranging in age from 40 to 1--on Sosthènes Boudreaux's farm in Ward Four of the parish's Western District. Charles Sosthène, père died near Abbeville, Vermilion Parish, in June 1856, age 43.\n\nCharles Sosthène, fils married fellow Acadian Elisa Prejean and settled near Abbeville, Vermilion Parish, by the mid-1850s. Their daughter married into the Hardy family. In 1860, the federal census taker in Vermilion Parish counted 3 slaves--2 males and a female, all black, ages 27, 15, and 2, living in 1 house--on Sustain Boodro's farm in the parish's western district; this probably was Charles Sosthène, fils. Charles Sosthène, fils died near Abbeville in December 1868; the priest who recorded the burial, and who did not give any parents' names or even mention a wife, said that Sosthène died \"at age 34 yrs.,\" so this was him. Did he father any sons?\n\n1e\n\nSymphorien married Joséphine, another daughter of Éloi Broussard and Marguerite Thibodeaux, at the Vermilionville church, Lafayette Parish, in April 1834. Their son Théosime was born in Lafayette Parish in April 1835, Théodule in April 1839, Symphorien, fils in March 1841, and Jules in June 1843. Their daughters married into the Lemaire and Trahan families. In October 1850, the federal census taker in Vermilion Parish counted a single slave--a 40-year-old mulatto male--on Widow Eyfroyin Boudreaux's farm next to Sevenne Boudreaux in Ward One of the parish's Western District; these probably were Joséphine Broussard's slaves.\n\nDuring the War of 1861-65, Théosime, called Théorime in Confederate records, may have served in Company K of the Consolidated 18th Regiment and Yellow Jacket Battalion Louisiana Infantry, which fought in Louisiana.\n\nThéodule may have married Carmelite Lemaire and settled near Abbeville, Vermilion Parish, in the early 1860s. Their son Emmard was born in October 1866.\n\nSymphorien, fils may have married fellow Acadian Clémence LeBlanc at the Abbeville church, Vermilion Parish, in July 1865. They settled near Youngsville. Their son Phineas was born in December 1866.\n\n1f\n\nIn October 1850, the federal census taker in Vermilion Parish counted 5 slaves--3 males and 2 females, all black, ranging in age from 18 to 1--on Sevenne Boudreaux's farm between Widow Eyfroyin Boudreaux and Widow Jean Boudreaux in Ward One of the parish's Western District. Sevenne married Euphémie Roy probably in Vermilion Parish in the early 1850s. Their son Sevenne, fils was born near Abbeville, Vermilion Parish, in May 1856, and Charles Sosthène le jeune in May 1861. They also had a son named Eraste. They were living in Lafayette Parish in late 1862. Their daughter married into the Bernard family. During the War of 1861-65, Sevenne, a resident of Vermilion Parish at the time of his enlistment, may have served as a corporal in Company A of the 8th Regiment Louisiana Cavalry, raised in Rapides Parish, which fought in Louisiana.\n\nEraste married Carmelite, daughter of fellow Acadians Clet LeBlanc and Marcelite Bernard, at the Youngsville church, Lafayette Parish, in September 1870.\n\n2\n\nLeufroi, baptized at Opelousas, age unrecorded, in July 1789, married Marie, daughter of fellow Acadians Jean Charles Hébert and Madeleine Robichaud \"of Vermillion,\" at the St. Martinville church, St. Martin Parish, in January 1808. They settled on the upper Vermilion. Their son, name unrecorded, died 6 days after his birth in November 1808, Jacques Leufroi, called Leufroi, fils, was born in St. Martin Parish in November 1809, Eusèbe or Eugène in January 1814 but died at age 7 in February 1820, a son, name unrecorded, died at birth in March 1816, a son, name and age unrecorded, died in January 1820, Moïse was born in February 1820, a child, perhaps a son, named unrecorded, died a day after its birth in February 1823, Duclise, also called Euclide, was born in Lafayette Parish in February 1825, and Ursin in May 1827. Their daughters married into the Brasseaux, Clavel, Frederick, Guidry, Sonnier, and Templet families. In September 1850, the federal census taker in Lafayette Parish counted 3 slaves--2 males and a female, all black, ages 40, 35, and 17--on Leufroy Boudreau's farm in the parish's Western District. Leufroi died in Lafayette Parish in July 1866; the Vermilionville priest who recorded the burial, and who did not give any parents' names or even mention a wife, said that Luffroy died at \"age 84 yrs.,\" which would have made him older than brother Jean. Four of Leufroi's sons survived childhood, but only two of them created families of their own. They settled in Lafayette Parish.\n\n2a\n\nDuclise married Azelia or Zilia, 16-year-old daughter of fellow Acadian Treville Thibodeaux and his Creole wife Madeleine Constantin, at the Vermilionville church, Lafayette Parish, in December 1846. Their son Jérôme died in Lafayette Parish, age unrecorded, in November 1847. Duclise died in Lafayette Parish in January 1859, age 33. His family line probably died with him.\n\n2b\n\nUrsin married Oliva, daughter of fellow Acadian Olivier Guidry and his Creole wife Marie Meaux, at the Vermilionville church, Lafayette Parish, in December 1848. Their son Genus was born in Lafayette Parish in November 1851, Alexandre was born in May 1855, and Paul in December 1866.\n\n2c\n\nJacques Leufroi died in Lafayette Parish in January 1869. The Vermilionville priest who recorded the burial, and who did not give any parents' names or mention a wife, said that Juffroy, as he called him, died \"at age 60 yrs.\"; Jacques Leufroi would have been 59. Did he marry?\n\n2d\n\nMoïse died in Lafayette Parish in March 1870. The Vermilionville priest who recorded the burial, and who did not bother to give any parents' names or mention a wife, said that Moïse died \"at age 50 yrs.,\" so this was him. Did he marry?\n\n3\n\nAugustin, baptized at Attakapas, age 2, in June 1795, married Scholastique, daughter of fellow Acadians Joseph Hébert and Marguerite Trahan, at the St. Martinville church, St. Martin Parish, in April 1812. They settled on the upper Vermilion. Their son Augustin, fils was born in St. Martin Parish in May 1813 but died at age 15 in March 1829, Joseph Clairville was born in January 1815, a son, name unrecorded, died in May 1816 only 5 weeks after his birth, Sylvanie was born in April 1817, a child, perhaps a son, named unrecorded, died at age 9 months in November 1823, Norbert was born in December 1825, Désiré was baptized at the Vermilionville church, Lafayette Parish, age 2 months, in June 1832, and Onésime A., also called O. A., was born in January 1834. Their daughters married into the Baudoin, Mouton, Picard, and Vincent families. In July 1860, the federal census taker in Lafayette Parish counted a single slave--a 7-year-old black male, on Augustin Boudreau's farm near Drauzin Boudreaux; one wonders if this was Augustin, Drauzin's uncle; if so, Augustin would have been in his late 60s.\n\n3a\n\nJoseph Clairville married Adeline, daughter of fellow Acadians Onésime Mouton and Tarsille Hébert, at the Vermilionville church, Lafayette Parish, in April 1836; Adeline's brother was husband of Joseph Clairville's sister. Their son Antoine was born in Lafayette Parish in December 1838, and Victorin in March 1843. Their daughter married an Hébert cousin.\n\nAntoine married cousin Ursule, daughter of fellow Acadians Eusèbe Lessaint Hébert and Carmelite Hébert, at the Vermilionville church, Lafayette Parish, in July 1860 or 1861. Their son, name unrecorded, died in Lafayette Parish in April 1863 9 days after his birth. During the War of 1861-65, Antoine served probably as a conscript in Company B of the Crescent Regiment Louisiana Infantry, raised in Orleans Parish, which fought in Tennessee and Louisiana, and Company C of the Consolidated Crescent Regiment Infantry, which fought in Louisiana. Antoine enlisted in the Crescent Regiment at Camp Pratt, near New Iberia, in late August 1862 and remained with his company until the summer of 1863, when he reported sick at the Confederate hospital in New Iberia. (A daughter had died in Lafayette Parish, age 5 months, in October 1862, a few weeks after his enlistment, and his wife died in April 1863 probably from complications of giving birth to a son, who also died, so this may have been a factor in Antoine's illness; it certainly would have affected his morale.) He returned to his company, which changed its designation due to consolidation with another unit in November 1863. Antoine remarried to Apolline, daughter of Louis Sellers and Belzire Baudoin, at the Youngsville church, Lafayette Parish, in August 1866.\n\n3b\n\nOnésime A. married Azélia, daughter of Don Louis Langlinais and his Acadian wife Azelle Trahan, at the Vermilionville church, Lafayette Parish, in January 1859. They settled near Youngsville. Their son Israël was born in September 1861, Félix in October 1862, and Aristide in March 1870.\n\n3c\n\nNorbert married fellow Acadian Adalise or Ordalize Mouton and settled near Youngsville, Lafayette Parish. Their son Pierre was born in August 1859, and Adam in April 1861.\n\n4\n\nYoungest son Louis, called Don Louis, born at Attakapas in January 1801, married Marie Madeleine, Adeline, Azeline, Celine, or Zeline, daughter of fellow Acadians Joseph Landry and Marie Melançon, at the St. Martinville church, St. Martin Parish, in February 1820. They settled on the upper Vermilion. Their son Euclide died in Lafayette Parish at age 13 days in April 1829, a child, perhaps a son, name unrecorded, died 6 days after its birth in September 1834, Dema was born in October 1835, Numa was baptized at the Vermilionville church, Lafayette Parish, age 3 months, in April 1838, and Étienne was born in August 1843. Their daughters married into the Broussard, Dubois, Galtier, Landry, LeBlanc, and Taylor or Teller families. In September 1850, the federal census taker in Lafayette Parish counted 3 slaves--a male and 2 females, all black, ages 50, 47, and 10--on Donlouis Boudreau's farm in the parish's Western District.\n\n4a\n\nÉtienne's succession record was filed at the Vermilionville courthouse in September 1861. He would have been only 18 years old that year and probably did not marry. He does not appear in Louisiana or Confederate wartime records. Still, one wonders if his death was war-related.\n\n4b\n\nDuring the War of 1861-65, Numa served in Company C of the 8th Regiment Louisiana Infantry, raised in St. Martin Parish, which served in Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania--one of General R. E. Lee's Louisiana Tigers. Numa enlisted in June 1861, and, except for a bout of illness later that year which sent him to a Richmond hospital, he was with his company in all of its many marches, campaigns, and bloody battles until the summer of 1864. Wounded in action at the Battle of Monocacy, Maryland, in July 1864, he fell into enemy hands. The Federals sent him to the general hospital at nearby Frederick, Maryland, and then on to Baltimore and Fort McHenry, where he was still in the hospital in late November. Recovered sufficiently from his wound, in early January 1865 the Federals sent him to the prisoner of war camp at Point Lookout, Maryland, and held him there until the following March, when he was paroled and exchanged at Aiken's Landing, Virginia. After General Lee surrendered at Appomattox Courthouse, Virginia, a few weeks later, Numa returned home as best he could. He married Élodie, daughter of Raphaël Segura and his Acadian wife Carmelite Broussard, at the Youngsville church, Lafayette Parish, in September 1865. In August 1889, Numa, now in his early 50s, served in the honor guard at the funeral and reburial of Lieutenant Louis Edmond LeBlanc of his company. Lieutenant LeBlanc had fallen at the Battle of Malvern Hill in July 1862 and was buried on the field by his comrades, who carved his name and unit into a wooden headboard. Amazingly, over a quarter of a century after the young lieutenant fell, the caretaker of the nearby Federal cemetery, while exploring in the area, discovered the timed-worn headboard and the lieutenant's remains. The LeBlanc family returned their loved one to his home on Bayou Teche, and hundreds of people attended the lieutenant's re-interment in St. Michael's Cemetery at St. Martinville.\n\n~\n\nNot until the 1770s did another Acadian Boudreaux settle west of the Atchafalaya Basin. He came to Louisiana from Maryland as a young orphan in February 1768 and lived on the river for a time, but when he came of age, he chose to set down roots in the Attakapas District.\n\nDescendants of Augustin dit Rémi BOUDREAUX (c1755?-1830; Michel, Charles, Jean-Baptiste)\n\nAugustin dit Rémi, son of Pierre Boudrot and Anne Hébert of Minas and Pigiguit, was, according to a Spanish census, a 13-year-old orphan when he came to Louisiana from Maryland with the Breau clan in February 1768, but he may have been older. He followed the Breaus to San Luìs de Natchez, far up the Mississippi in what is now Concordia Parish, but he did not remain there. After 1769, when the Spanish released the Acadians from the isolated settlement, he left the river and moved to the Attakapas District, where he married Judith-Philippe, daughter of fellow Acadians Charles Martin and Rosalie Trahan, in c1777. In the early 1800s, they were living at \"Arcoquisson.\" Their daughters married into the Boone and Prejean families. Augustin dit Rémi remarried to fellow Maryland exile and cousin Madeleine, daughter of Olivier Benoit and Susanne Boudreaux, and widow of Amand Martin and André Favron, at the Opelousas church, St. Landry Parish, in July 1815. Augustin dit Rémi died in St. Landry Parish in June 1830; the Opelousas priest who recorded his burial said that Rémi was age 85 when he died; his successions were filed at the Opelousas courthouse in August 1822 and October 1830. Three of Rémi's four sons, all by his first wife, created families of their own.\n\n1\n\nOldest son Pierre, by his father's first wife, born at Attakapas in January 1779, probably died young.\n\n2\n\nAugustin, fils, also called Augustin dit Rémi, from his father's first wife, born at Attakapas in April 1782, married Françoise, daughter of German Creoles Michel Ritter and Marie Louise Stelly, at Opelousas in August 1805. They settled on the upper Vermilion, at the northern edge of the old Attakapas District, and then near Grand Coteau in St. Landry Parish. Their son Augustin III was baptized at the Opelousas church, St. Landry Parish, age 8 months, in October 1811, Evariste was born in September 1813, Joseph was baptized at the Grand Coteau church, age 6 months, in November 1822, Onésime A. was born in March 1824, and Treville in June 1826. Their daughters married into the Burleigh, Caruthers, Miller, Prejean, Richard, Robin, Savoie, and Stelly families. Augustin, fils died in St. Landry Parish in February 1835, age 53. His succession may have been filed at the Opelousas courthouse in May 1850. In October 1850, the federal census taker in St. Landry Parish counted 40 slaves--19 males and 21 females, all black except for 2 mulattoes, ranging in age from 60 years to 6 months--on Widow Augn Boudreau's plantation; these probably were Françoise Ritter's slaves. Augustin, fils's five sons settled near Grand Coteau, and most of their lines survived. A grandson settled near Church Point on Bayou Plaquemine Brûlé.\n\n2a\n\nAugustin III married Sarah, daughter of Robert Burleigh and Marie Teller, at the Grand Coteau church, St. Landry Parish, in February 1832; Sarah's brother had married one of Augustin III's sisters. Augustin III died near Grand Coteau in February 1847; the priest who recorded his burial said that Augustin died \"at age 40 yrs.,\" but he was 36. His succession record may have been filed at the Opelousas courthouse in May 1850. His family line may have died with him. In October 1850, the federal census taker in St. Landry Parish counted 5 slaves on Widow A. Boudreaux, Jr.'s farm next to William Burleigh near Grand Coteau; these probably were Sarah Burleigh's slaves.\n\n2b\n\nEvariste married first cousin Marie Arsènne, called Arsènne, daughter of his uncle Jean dit Rémi Boudreaux and Marguerite Caruthers, at the Grand Coteau church, St. Landry Parish, in April 1835. Their son Evariste Jean was born near Grand Coteau in October 1837. Their daughter married into the the Thibodeaux family. Evariste, père died near Grand Coteau in August 1839, age 26; his succession was filed at the Opelousas courthouse in May 1841, the same month that Marie Arsènne remarried to Anglo-American William Fisher at Grand Coteau.\n\nEvariste Jean married Marie Ozea, called Ozea, daughter of fellow Acadians Jean Benoit and Marcellite Lebert, at the Grand Coteau church, St. Landry Parish, in January 1860. They settled near Church Point, then in St. Landry but now in Acadia Parish. Their son Jean was born in December 1860. During the War of 1861-65, Evariste Jean served in Company K of the 29th (Thomas's) Regiment Louisiana Infantry, raised in St. Landry Parish, which fought at Vicksburg, Mississippi. A daughter was born in May 1864 while Evariste Jean was at home waiting for the exchange of his regiment, which had been captured at Vicksburg the previous summer. Evariste Jean died near Church Point in June 1868; the Grand Coteau priest who recorded the burial, and who did not give any parents' names or mention a wife, said that Evariste died \"at age 28 yrs.\"; Evariste Jean would have been 30; his succession, naming his wife, was filed at the Opelousas courthouse, St. Landry Parish, in March 1869. One wonders if his death was war-related.\n\n2c\n\nJoseph married German Creole Joséphine Marks at the Grand Coteau church, St. Landry Parish, in January 1842. Their son Joseph, fils was baptized at the Grand Coteau church, age unrecorded, in November 1843 but died 10 days after his birth, and Joseph Edgar, perhaps called Edgar, was born in August 1850. Their daughters married into the Bertinot, Boutte, and Darby families. In October 1850, the federal census taker in St. Landry Parish counted 6 slaves--4 males and 2 females, all blacks, ranging in age from 60 to 2--on Joseph Boudreau's farm. One wonders if this was Joseph, son of Augustin, fils. In 1860, the federal census taker in St. Landry Parish counted 5 slaves--3 males and 2 females, all black, ages 60 to 13--on Joseph Bodreau's farm; this probably was the same fellow who held the 6 slaves 10 years before.\n\n2d\n\nOnésime A. married Joséphine, daughter of Alexandre Castille and Joséphine Stelly, at the Grand Coteau church, St. Landry Parish, in October 1845. Their son Onésime A., fils was born near Grand Coteau in August 1850 but died at age 7 in October 1857. Their daughter married into the Mouton family. In October 1850, the federal census taker in St. Landry Parish counted 13 slaves--11 males and 2 females, all black, ranging in age from 50 to 15--held by Onézime Boudreau & Co.; this may have been Onésime A., père, who died near Grand Coteau in May 1854, age 30; his succession was filed at the Opelousas courthouse the following month. Except for its blood, did his family line survive?\n\n2e\n\nTreville married German Creole Marie Azéma, called Azéma, Marks at the Grand Coteau church, St. Landry Parish, in August 1846. Their son Treville, fils was born near Grand Coteau in July 1847, a child, perhaps a son, name unrecorded, died at age 3 months in February 1849, Ernest was born in December 1853 but died at age 7 1/2 in April 1861, Alberd was born in August 1855, and Félix in April 1857. Their daughter married into the Stelly family. Treville died near Grand Coteau in August 1860; the priest who recorded the burial, and who did not give any parents' names or even mention a wife, said that Treville died \"at age 31 yrs.,\" but he was 34; his succession was filed at the Opelousas courthouse in October.\n\nTreville, fils may have married Anglo American Victoria Dwyer. Their son Adam was born near Breaux Bridge, St. Martin Parish, in June 1868.\n\n3\n\nJean dit Rémi, also called Arsène, from his father's first wife, baptized at Attakapas, age 2 months, in May 1784, married Marguerite, daughter of Anglo Creole William Caruthers and Elizabeth Bickham of North Carolina and New Jersey, at the St. Martinville church, St. Martin Parish, in September 1806. They settled at the northern edge of the old Atakapas District, at the time a part of St. Martin, now Lafayette Parish, in an area along the upper Vermilion that the Acadians called Beaubassin, east of Carencro and south of Grand Coteau. A child, perhaps a son, name unrecorded, died at age 1 month in St. Martin Parish in June 1810, Jean Symphorien, called Symphorien and also Cyprien, was born in May 1811, Julien in January 1815, Pierre Onésime, called Onésime, in December 1818, and Joseph Dupréville near Grand Coteau, St. Landry Parish, in April 1821. Their daughters married into the Boudreaux, Fisher, and Richard families and perhaps into the Robin family as well. Jean dit Rémi died near Grand Coteau in December 1841; the priest who recorded his burial said that Jean died \"at age 55 yrs.,\" but he was 57; his succession had been filed at the Opelousas courthouse the previous January. Two of his four sons created families of their own and settled near Grand Coteau. His oldest son's line was especially vigorous.\n\n3a\n\nSymphorien married Marie or Mary, daughter of Robert Burleigh and Marie Teller, at the Grand Coteau church, St. Landry Parish, in December 1832. Their son Dupréville was born near Grand Coteau in October 1833, Damonville in December 1835, Jean Symphorien in September 1839, John Raphaël, called Raphaël, in June 1842, Joseph Lichy in October 1843, Félix in May 1849, and John in January 1853. Their daughters married into the Ledoux and McClelland families. In 1860, the federal census taker in St. Landry Parish counted 10 slaves--5 males and 5 females, all black, ranging in age from 50 to 1, living in 2 houses--on Symphorien Boudreau's farm; one wonders if this was him.\n\nDamonville married Anglo American Eliza or Elila E. Jones or Johns in a civil ceremony in St. Landry Parish in May 1860. During the War of 1861-65, Damonville served in Company K of the 3rd (Harrison's) Regiment Louisiana Cavalry, originally called the Prairie Rangers, raised in St. Landry Parish, which fought in Louisiana and southern Arkansas; the Prairie Rangers were, in fact, the headquarters guard for Major General Richard Taylor, commander of Confederate forces in South Louisiana during the last two years of the war. A daughter was born near Church Point, then in St. Landry but now in Acadia Parish, in March 1863, when Damonville was with his company. Damonville remarried to Célestine, daughter of fellow Acadians Augustin Jeansonne, fils and Céleste Pitre, at the Opelousas church, St. Landry Parish, in February 1869.\n\nDuring the War of 1861-65, Raphaël served in Company B of the 18th Regiment Louisiana Infantry, raised in St. Landry Parish, which fought in Tennessee, Mississippi, and Louisiana, and as a corporal in Company F of the Consolidated 18th Regiment and Yellow Jacket Battalion Infantry, which fought in Louisiana. Raphaël enlisted in the 18th Louisiana at Camp Moore in May 1861, served on detached service as a pioneer in the spring of 1862, and was captured at Alexandria, Louisiana, in May 1863. The federals held him briefly, releasing him at Grant's Island, near Mobile, Alabama, later in the month. Raphaël married Corinne, daughter of fellow Acadians François Louis Pitre and Félicia Pitre, at the Opelousas church, St. Landry Parish, in December 1868. They settled near Washington, north of Opelousas. Their son Francis Thomas was born in September 1869.\n\nFélix died in Lafayette Parish in July 1864, age 15. One wonders if his death was war-related.\n\n3b\n\nOnésime married Marie Mélicère or Melissa, daughter of fellow Acadians Jean Savoie and Modeste Préjean, at the Grand Coteau church, St. Landry Parish, in May 1837. Their son Joseph Émile was baptized at the Grand Coteau church, age unrecorded, in April 1838. In October 1850, the federal census taker in St. Landry Parish counted 13 slaves--11 males and 2 females, all black, ranging in age from 50 to 15--held by Onézime Boudreau & Co.; one wonders if this was him. In 1860, the federal census taker in St. Landry Parish counted 2 slaves--a 26-year-old black male, and an 8-year-old black female--on Onejime Boudreau's farm.\n\n3c\n\nJulien was supposed to have married Joséphine, daughter of fellow Acadians André Préjean and Joséphine Breaux, at the Vermilionville church, Lafayette Parish, on 2 July 1838, but the wedding did not take place. Julien died near Grand Coteau three days later, evidently too ill to attend the ceremony, age 23; his succession was filed at the Opelousas courthouse in August.\n\n3d\n\nJoseph Dupréville may have died near Grand Coteau in August 1841. The priest who recorded the burial, and who did not give any parents' names or mention a wife, said that Dupréville, as he called him, died \"at age 30 yrs.\", but Joseph Dupréville would have been age 20. He probably did not marry.\n\n4\n\nYoungest son Benjamin, by his father's first wife, born at Opelousas in April 1789, baptized at home and then by the Opelousas priest in June 1794, married Iréné, daughter of Philippe Lacase and Geneviève Carrière, at the Opelousas church, St. Landry Parish, in February 1817. Iréné's family lived in the Bois Mallet, near present-day Eunice, St. Landry Parish. Their son Benjamin, fils had been born in St. Landry Parish in March 1812, and another Benjamin, fils, a twin, in October 1817. Iréné died after giving birth to the twins. Their daughter married into the Guilbert family. Benjamin remarried to stepsister and cousin Céleste, daughter of André Favron and his Acadian wife Madeleine Benoit, probably in St. Landry Parish in c1818; Céleste's mother Benjamin's father's second wife. Benjamin and Céleste's son Louis was born in St. Landry Parish in August 1818. Benjamin, père's succession record was filed at the Opelousas courthouse in December 1822; he would have been age 33 that year. One wonders if any of his sons created families of their own.\n\n~\n\nTwo Joseph Boudrots came from France in 1785 and settled west of the Atchafalaya Basin. One was already married when he came to Louisiana, and the other did not marry until after he moved from the river to the Attakapas District:\n\nDescendants of Joseph BOUDREAUX (c1755?-1790s; Michel, Claude?, François?)\n\nJoseph, only son, perhaps, of Jean-Zacharie Boudrot and Marguerite Hébert, born either at Minas or aboard ship in c1755, followed his family to Virginia later that year, to England in 1756, and to France in May 1763. After the death of his father in April 1765, Joseph, now age 10, went to live with Joseph Célestin dit Bellemère, husband of Marguerite Boudrot. Joseph's stay with the family was brief. Joseph Bellemère died at St.-Servan in August 1767, age 39, and Marguerite Boudrot followed her husband to the grave the following month, at age 30, leaving behind three young children. Joseph was still only 12. He may have been the Joseph Boudrot who married Marie-Françoise, daughter of fellow Acadians Germain Semer and Marie Trahan of Grand-Pré and Le Havre, at St.-Martin-de-Chantenay, France, in May 1785. Marie-Françoise, sans Joseph, crossed from France aboard L'Amitié, the fifth of the Seven Ships, in 1785 and followed her 16-year-old brother, Grégoire-Dominique, to the Attakapas District, where they settled near their older brother, Jean-Baptiste Semer, who had come to Louisiana in 1765 and who they had never met. When Marie-Françoise sailed to Louisiana, she was pregnant with son Antoine. For some reason, husband Joseph did not accompany her to Louisiana aboard L'Amitié, but he was in the colony by the summer of 1788, when their second son was conceived. Joseph died by August 1796, when his wife remarried at Attakapas. He and Marie-Françoise had at least three sons, two of whom settled in St. Landry and St. Martin parishes. In the 1850s, a grandson moved farther out on the prairies and settled along Bayou Plaquemine Brûlé.\n\n1\n\nOldest son Antoine, born at Attakapas in February 1786, married Marie Émelie, daughter of fellow Acadians François Savoie and Apolline Luce Potier, at the Opelousas church, St. Landry Parish, in August 1812. They settled on the upper Vermilion, at the far northern edge of the old Attakapas District. Their son Antoine, fils died 8 days after his birth in August 1817, Joseph Arvillien, called Arvillien, was born in St. Martin Parish in September 1818, Louis Deterville near Grand Coteau, St. Landry Parish, in August 1820, Placide was baptized at the Grand Coteau church, age 3 months, in January 1823, Alexandre Aladin, called Aladin, was born in February 1825, and François Gerasin, called Gerasin, in March 1827. Their daughters married into the Benoit, Boone, Cormier, Meche, Prejean, Richard, Savoie, and Thibodeaux families. Antoine, père died near Grand Coteau in February 1836, age 51; his succession was filed at the Opelousas courthouse in September 1849.\n\n1a\n\nArvillien married German Creole Marie or Mary Mayer at the Grand Coteau church, St. Landry Parish, in November 1840. One wonders if they had any sons.\n\n1b\n\nPlacide married Marie Rose, daughter of fellow Acadians David Babineaux le jeune and Marie Éloise Préjean, at the Grand Coteau church, St. Landry Parish, in April 1844. Their son Osémé was born near Grand Coteau in July 1847 but died at age 1 1/2 in April 1849, Simon was born in January 1853, and Ursin in November 1855. Their daughters married into the Miller and Savoie families. Placide died near Grand Coteau in January 1860, age 37; his succession was filed at the Opelousas courthouse in September 1865.\n\n1c\n\nAladin married French Creole Mélanie Meche at the Grand Coteau church, St. Landry Parish, in May 1846. Their son Alexandre was born near Grand Coteau in January 1847, Gustave in August 1848, and Placide le jeune in August 1850. Aladin remarried to Marie Oliva, daughter of Noël Olivier and Louise Daigle, at the Grand Coteau church in July 1853. They settled near Church Point, then in St. Landry but now in Acadia Parish. Their son Apollinaire was born in April 1855 but died at age 6 in October 1861, Napoléon was born in August 1856, Firmin in January 1858, and Antoine Clément in January 1862.\n\nAlexandre, by his father's first wife, married Marie Lastenie, called Lastenie, daughter of fellow Acadian Jean Baptiste Thibodeaux and his Anglo wife Elizabeth Smith, in a civil ceremony in St. Landry Parish in May 1868, and sanctified the marriage at the Grand Coteau church, St. Landry Parish, in July. Their son Alexandre Lasty was born near Grand Coteau in March 1869.\n\nGustave, by his father's first wife, married Eugénie, another daughter of Jean Baptiste Thibodeaux and Elizabeth Smith, at the Grand Coteau church, St. Landry Parish, in November 1868. Their son Lucien was born near Grand Coteau in May 1870.\n\n1d\n\nGerasin married Émelie Venable at the Grand Coteau church, St. Landry Parish, in February 1848. Their son François was born near Grand Coteau in April 1849 but died the following June. Gerasin remarried to cousin Marie Émilie, called Émilie, daughter of fellow Acadians Jean Savoie and Modeste Préjean, at the Vermilionville church, Lafayette Parish, in April 1855. Their son Gerasin, fils was born near Grand Coteau in December 1862. Gerasin, père died near Grand Coteau in December 1863, age 36; his succession was filed at the Opelousas courthouse, St. Landry Parish, in December 1870. One wonders if his death was war-related.\n\n2\n\nLouis, born at Attakapas in May 1789, may have died young.\n\n3\n\nYoungest son Joseph, fils, born at Attakapas in c1790, married Félicité or Félice, daughter of fellow Acadian Sylvain Broussard and Félice Guilbeau of Grand Pointe, at the St. Martinville church, St. Martin Parish, in October 1816. They settled at Grand Pointe, on the upper Bayou Teche in St. Martin Parish near present-day Breaux Bridge. Their son Joseph Osémé, called Osémé, was born at Grand Pointe in September 1817. Their daughter married into the Cormier family. Joseph, fils died at Grand Pointe in December 1837, age 48. He fathered only one son, but the son created a large family of his own and remained in St. Martin Parish.\n\nJoseph Osémé married Céleste Émilie, Ameline, Amelina, Émilia, or Melina, daughter of fellow Acadian Michel Onésime Cormier and Céleste Dupuis, at the St. Martinville church, St. Martin Parish, in December 1838. Their son Joseph le jeune was born in St. Martin Parish in January 1848, Omer in June 1853, Martial in February 1855, Sylvain in December 1855[sic], Ulysse in March 1859 but died at age 1 1/2 (the recording priest said 3 1/2) in January 1861, and Hippolyte was born in October 1860. Their daughters married into the Cabrol, Comeaux, Dubois, Duhon, and Wiltz families. In November 1850, the federal census taker in St. Martin Parish counted 10 slaves--7 males and 3 females, all black, ranging in age from 50 to 1--on Ozémi Boudreau's farm. In June 1860, the federal census taker in St. Martin Parish counted 29 slaves--20 males and 9 females, all black except for 4 mulattoes, ages 36 to 1--on Ozémé Boudro's plantation not far from Nicholas Cormier. In July 1860, Osémé also held 2 slaves--both males, both black, ages 30 and 22--on a farm in western Lafayette Parish. Osémé died in St. Martin Parish in December 1861, age 44; his succession was filed at the St. Martinville courthouse later that month.\n\nDescendants of Joseph BOUDREAUX (1767-1838; Michel, Charles, Denis)\n\nJoseph, son of Charles Boudrot of Île St.-Jean and his second wife Marie-Madeleine Bourgeois, born at St.-Servan, France, in May 1767, came to Louisiana in 1785 aboard La Bergère, the second of the Seven Ships from France, in 1785 with his older half-sister Cécile, widow of Charles Richard. Joseph (called Jean for some reason on the ship's embarkation list) probably followed his sister to Ascension, on the Acadian Coast above New Orleans. During the late 1780s or early 1790s, he crossed the Atchafalaya Basin to the Attakapas District, where he married Élisabeth- or Isabelle-Apolline, called Apolline and sometimes Zabelle, daughter of fellow Acadian Pierre Trahan and Marguerite Doiron, in November 1792. Apolline was a native of Belle-Île-en-Mer, France, and had come to Louisiana aboard Le St.-Rémi, the fourth of the Seven Ships. They settled in the northern part of the Attakapas District. Theirs daughters married into the Landry and Simon families. Joseph died near Vermilionville, Lafayette Parish, in December 1838; the priest who recorded his burial said that Joseph was age 68 when he died, but he was 71. Most of his sons settled in Lafayette Parish, but one of them moved to the New Iberia area, then in St. Martin Parish, in the 1840s. Some of his grandsons settled in Vermilion Parish.\n\n1\n\nOldest son Joseph, fils, born at Attakapas in February 1796, married Ismene, Lisemaine, Lismene, or Lise Marie, daughter of fellow Acadians François Labauve and Éloise Hébert, at the St. Martinville church, St. Martin Parish, in May 1815.

Their daughters married into the Bouquinet, Broussard, Desmarets, and Thibodeaux families. Joseph, fils died in Lafayette Parish in April 1834; the priest who recorded his burial said that Joseph, fils was age 35 when he died, but he was 37. Five of his sons married and settled in Lafayette Parish.\n\n1a\n\nJoseph III married Marie Sylvanie, called Sylvanie, daughter of fellow Acadians François Bourg and Seraphie Landry, at the Vermilionville church, Lafayette Parish, in 1836. Their son Cleopha was baptized at the Vermilionville church, age 3 months, in July 1839 but died at age 4 1/2 in August 1843, Jules Désiré was born in October 1850, Anatole in January 1852, and Louis Amédée in September 1854. Their daughters married into the Broussard and Seaon or Seeon families. Joseph III remarried to Marie Eulalie, daughter of Joseph Nunez and Marie Tarsille Toups, at the Abbeville church, Vermilion Parish, in November 1856. Their son Joseph William, also called Martial, was born in Lafayette Parish in October 1858 but died at age 1 1/2 in February 1860, Albert was born near Youngsville in September 1860 but died at age 8 months in May 1861, and Adam was born in April 1862. In July 1860, the federal census taker in Lafayette Parish counted 8 slaves--5 males and 3 females, all black, ranging in age from 40 to 11, living in 3 houses--on Joseph Boudreau's farm next to Widow Edmond Boudreaux. Was this Joseph III? If so, the widow next door would have been his aunt by marriage.\n\n1b\n\nRosémond married Angeline, daughter of fellow Acadian Felonise Hébert, at the Vermilionville church, Lafayette Parish, in March 1837. The priest who recorded the marriage did not give Angeline's father's name. Rosémond remarried to Élizabeth, daughter of Louis Lormand and Marie Fremaux, at the Vermilionville church in April 1842. Their son François Dorcili, called Dorcili, was born in Lafayette Parish in August 1843 but died near Abbeville, Vermilion Parish, age 10, in March 1854. Their daughters married into the Broussard family. Rosémond died near Abbeville in May 1854; the priest who recorded the burial, and who did not bother to give any parents' names or even mention a wife, said that François Rosémond died \"at age 36 yrs.,\" but he was 34. His family line, except for its blood, may have died with him.\n\n1c\n\nSeville married Marie Lise, called Lise, daughter of fellow Acadians Valéry Broussard and Marguerite Landry, at the Vermilionville church, Lafayette Parish, in June 1849. Their son Valéry was born in Lafayette Parish in March 1850, and Joseph le jeune perhaps posthumously in December 1851. Seville's succession was filed at the Vermilionville courthouse in December 1851; he would have been age 22 that year.\n\n1d\n\nJean Clairville married Marcellite, daughter of fellow Acadians Louis Hébert and Marie Eurasie Mire, in a civil ceremony in Lafayette Parish in April 1852. Their son Louis was born near Abbeville, Vermilion Parish, in March 1853.

Their son Jean Alcide was born in Lafayette Parish in February 1857, and Théodule near Abbeville in July 1858.\n\n1e\n\nThéodule may have married ____, daughter of fellow Acadian Édouard Broussard, and may have been the Théodule Boudreaux who died \"at the home of Mr. Edward Broussard, his father-in-law,\" near Abbeville, Vermilion Parish, in February 1854. The priest who recorded the burial did not give Théodule's parents' names or his age at the time of his death.\n\n2\n\nPhilemon dit Edmond, also called Aimond, Aymond, Emon, Emond, and Euphémon, a twin, born at Attakapas in April 1798, married Élisabeth or Isabelle, also called Zabelle, daughter of Jean-Baptiste Simon and his Acadian wife Marie Madeleine Aucoin of Grand Prairie, at the St. Martinville church, St. Martin Parish, in January 1821. They settled on the upper Vermilion. Their son Béloni, also called Honoré, was born in c1824, Edmond, fils was baptized at the Vermilionville church, Lafayette Parish, age 6 months, in June 1838, Sevenne was born in May 1843 but died at age 14 1/2 in March 1858, and Sosthène was born in July 1849.

In August 1850, the federal census taker in Lafayette Parish counted 3 slaves--2 males and a female, all black, ages 24, 18, and 16--on Edmond Boudreau's farm not far from François Boudreau in the parish's Western District. Philemon dit Edmond died in Lafayette Parish in February 1853; the priest who recorded his burial said that \"Emond\" died \"at age 50 yrs.,\" but he was 54; his succession was filed at the Vermilionville courthouse that month. In July 1860, the federal census taker in Lafayette Parish counted a single slave--an 18-year-old black female, on Widow Edmond Boudreaux's farm next to Joseph Boudreau; this was Isabelle Simon's slave. The Joseph Boudreaux next door probably was her nephew by marriage.\n\n2a\n\nBéloni married Eugènie, also called Arminie, 14-year-old daughter of fellow Acadian Pierre Trahan and his Creole wife Marie Marcellite Sellers, at the Vermilionville church, Lafayette Parish, in July 1843. They settled near Youngsville. Their son Nicolas was born in April 1847, Jules in September 1856, Albert in March 1859, and Jean Baptiste in January 1863. Their daughters married into the Broussard and Hébert families. Béloni's succession was filed at the Vermilionville courthouse in June 1868; he would have been age 44 that year.\n\nNicolas married cousin Louisianaise, daughter of Manuel Armentor and his Acadian wife his Acadian wife Méranthe Trahan, at the Youngsville church, Lafayette Parish, in September 1867. Their son Cleopha was born near Youngsville in May 1870.\n\n2b\n\nEdmond, fils married fellow Acadian Belzire Thibodeaux at the Abbeville church, Vermilion Parish, in February 1858. Their son Edmond Duplessis was born near Youngsville, Lafayette Parish, in November 1858, Arthur near Abbeville in April 1860, and Alphee in January 1862.\n\n3\n\nYoungest son François, born in St. Martin Parish in October 1807, married Marguerite, another daughter of Jean-Baptiste Simon and Marie Madeleine Aucoin, at the Vermilionville church, Lafayette Parish, in December 1824. Their son Symphorien was baptized at the Vermilionville church, age 4 months and 20 days, in October 1827, Sifroi was born in October 1839, Adrien in August 1842, Joseph in February 1845, Jean near New Iberia, then in St. Martin but now in Iberia Parish, in October 1845, and Robert Baube in Lafayette Parish in October 1849. Their daughters married into the Baudoin, Broussard, Hébert, and Sellers families. In August 1850, the federal census taker in Lafayette Parish counted 5 slaves--2 males and 3 females, all blacks, ranging in age from 25 years to 2 months--on François Boudreaux's farm next to widow Charles Baudoin and not far from Edmond Boudreau in the parish's Western District. François's succession was filed at the Vermilionville courthouse in November 1853; he would have been age 46 that year.\n\n3a\n\nSymphorien married Marguerite Azéma, called Azéma, daughter of fellow Acadians Charles Theriot and Scholastique Poirier, at the Abbeville church, Vermilion Parish, in April 1856. Their son Simon was born in Lafayette Parish in July 1857, Désiré near Youngsville in May 1859, and Lifroi near Grand Coteau, St. Landry Parish, in September 1861. In 1860, the federal census taker in St. Landry Parish counted 10 slaves--5 males and 5 females, all black, ranging in age from 50 to 1, living in 2 houses--on Symphorien Boudreau's farm; one wonders if this was him.\n\n3b\n\nDuring the War of 1861-65, Adrien served in Company E of the 26th Regiment Louisiana Infantry, raised in Lafayette Parish, which fought at Vicksburg, Mississippi. He died at Vicksburg probably from disease in April 1863, age 20.\n\n3c\n\nAccording to a succession record filed at the Vermilionville courthouse, Lafayette Parish, in February 1866, Syphroy Boudreaux \"died at Port Hudson[, Louisiana,] in 1863.\" Sifroi, son of François, would have been age 23 during the Siege of Port Hudson. One wonders in which Confederate unit he was serving during the campaign and what killed him.\n\n3d\n\nJoseph le jeune married Amelie or Amelia, daughter of fellow Acadians Éloi K. Broussard and Rose Hébert, at the New Iberia church, then in St. Martin but now in Iberia Parish, in September 1865. Their son Adrien was born near New Iberia in July 1866, and Joseph, fils in February 1868.\n\n3e\n\nRobert Baube married Euphémie, daughter of fellow Acadian Aladins Vincent and Azema Trahan, at the Youngsville church, Lafayette Parish, in February 1868.\n\n~\n\nBoudreauxs from the river and upper Bayou Lafourche moved to the old Attakapas District during the early antebellum period:\n\nDescendants of Joseph-Alain BOUDREAUX (1781-?; Michel, Charles, François)\n\nJoseph-Alain, third and youngest son of Amand Boudrot of Pigiguit and his second wife Frenchwoman Marie-Perrine Nogues, born probably at Plouër, France, in c1781, crossed to Louisiana aboard La Ville d'Archangel, the sixth of the Seven Ships, with his father, mother, and four siblings. His parents chose to settle not at Bayou des Écores with the majority of their fellow passengers but on upper Bayou Lafourche. In late 1795, Joseph-Alain was living with his older half-brothers at Assumption, where he married Marie-Jeanne, daughter of Frenchman Lambert Billardin or Villardin of Morlaix, France, and his Acadian wife Marguerite Daigre, in October 1803; Marie-Jeanne's mother was an Acadian Daigle. Marie-Jeanne had come to Louisiana aboard Le St.-Rémi, the fourth of the Seven Ships. During the late 1810s or the 1820s, Joseph-Alain crossed the Atchafalaya Basin to the old Attakapas District, where he remarried to Rosalie, daughter of fellow Acadians Firmin Landry and Scholastique Thibodeaux and widow of Henry Leonard Ransonet, at the St. Martinville church, St. Martin Parish, in October 1827. Neither of Joseph-Alain's sons by his first wife created families of their own, and he may not have had sons by his second wife, so this line of the family probably did not survive in the Bayou State.\n\n1\n\nOlder son Clément Henrique, by his father's first wife, born in Assumption Parish in December 1810, may have died young.\n\n2\n\nYounger son Léon Eustache, by his father's first wife, born in Assumption Parish in November 1815, died at age 2 in May 1817.\n\nDescendants of Olivier BOUDREAUX le jeune (1788-?; Michel, Claude, Michel, Olivier)\n\nOlivier le jeune, third son of Simon Boudreaux and Monique Dupuis, born at St.-Jacques on the river in July 1788, crossed the Atchafalaya Basin when he came of age and settled in the old Attakapas District. He married Susanne, also called Suzette Anne, daughter of fellow Acadians François Breaux and Silesie Dugas of Bayou Vermilion, at the St. Martinville church, St. Martin Parish, in August 1811. They settled at Anse la Butte on the upper Vermilion between present-day Lafayette and Breaux Bridge, and at nearby Grand Pointe on upper Bayou Teche near Breaux Bridge, before moving out to the prairie of western Lafayette Parish, where they ran a large plantation/vacharie. Their daughters married into the Breaux, Broussard, Daigle (German Canadian, not Acadian), Dugas, and LeBlanc families. In August 1850, the federal census taker in Lafayette Parish counted 32 slaves--18 males and 14 females, all black except for 1 mulatto, ranging in age from 45 to 1--on Olivier Boudreau's plantation next to Drauzin (probably A. D.) Boudreau in the parish's western district. In July 1860, the federal census taker in Lafayette Parish counted 43 slaves--22 males and 21 females, all black except for 7 mulattoes, ages 63 years to 7 months, living in only 5 houses--on Olivier Boudreaux's plantation between Françious Breaux and Ozémé Boudreaux. Three of Olivier's four sons created families of their own and settled in Lafayette Parish; two of the lines survived. Olivier's middle son, A. D., became a prominent planter, cattleman, and political figure in Lafayette Parish.\n\n1\n\nOldest son Valéry, born in St. Martin Parish in September 1812, married Marie Sylvanie, also called Azélina and Celphanie, daughter of Ursin Patin and his Acadian wife Marie Aspasie Guidry, at the Vermilionville church, Lafayette Parish, in February 1832. Their daughter married into the Doucet family. Valéry's succession record was filed at the Vermilionville courthouse in February 1845; he would have been 33 years old that year. He may have fathered no sons. In August 1860, the federal census taker in Lafayette Parish counted 6 slaves--2 males and 4 females, all black, ranging in age from 42 to 2, living in a single house--on Mrs. Valéry Boudreaux's farm; these probably were Marie Sylvanie Patin's slaves.\n\n2\n\nOlivier Rosaime, born in St. Martin Parish in March 1817, may have died young.\n\n3\n\nAurelien Drosin, called Drosin and A. D., born in St. Martin Parish in November 1818, married Azéma, 17-year-old daughter of fellow Acadian Charles Martin and his French-Canadian wife Caroline Daigle, at the Vermilionville church, Lafayette Parish, in June 1842. They settled on the prairie a few miles west of Vermilionville. Their son Charles Alphonse was born in Lafayette Parish in May 1848, Alexandre Olivier, called Olivier, in August 1850, and Valéry le jeune in October 1857. They also had an older son named Simon le jeune. Their daughter married into the Butcher family. In August 1850, federal census takers in Lafayette Parish counted 3 slaves--a male and 2 females, all black, ages 52, 18, and 15--on Drauzin Boudreau's farm next to Olivier Boudreau's plantation in the parish's Western District; these probably were A. D.'s slaves. In June 1860, the federal census taker in Lafayette Parish counted 6 slaves--3 males and 3 females, all black except for 1 mulatto, ages 65 to 3--on Drozin A. Boudreaux's farm; this probably was A. D. When war broke out in 1861, A. D. was colonel of the Lafayette Parish militia and secretary of the parish's Committee of Vigilance. During the War of 1861-65, A. D. served as captain of Company K, 2nd Regiment Louisiana Reserve Corps, a local unit raised in Lafayette Parish that fought prairie Jayhawkers. After the war, his neighbors still called him \"Colonel.\" By the early 1870s, his plantation/vacharie contained 300 acres near present-day Scott. In August 1874, during Reconstruction, the Colonel became president of White League Club Begnaud No. 2 in Lafayette Parish. He was still alive in April 1896 when two of his farm hands, Alexis and Ernest Blanc of France, murdered neighbor and kinsman Martin Begnaud at nearby Scott Station (Begnaud, a prominent merchant in Scott, was a brother of one of the Colonel's daughters-in-law).\n\n3a\n\nSimon le jeune married Céleste, daughter of German Canadian Joseph Daigle and Élise Dupré, at the Vermilionville church, Lafayette Parish, in May 1866. Their son François Osmar was born in Lafayette Parish in March 1867 but may have died at age 2 1/2 (the recording priest, who did not give the parents' names, said 11 months) in September 1869, and Laurent Dupré was born in April 1870.\n\n3b\n\nCharles Alphonse married 19-year-old Mathilde Pellerin probably in Lafayette Parish in c1875. Their son Adolphe Charles was born near Scott, Lafayette Parish, in June 1880.\n\nAdolphe Charles married Roselia, called Rosa, daughter of Jean Castex and Alice Landry of Mermentau, Acadia Parish, in the early 1900s. (Rosa's father, born in France in March 1837, immigrated to Louisiana in 1855. He married Rosa's mother in a civil ceremony in St. Landry Parish in April 1861, and sanctified the marriage at the Grand Coteau church, St. Landry Parish, in February 1862. Neither the parish clerk nor the Grand Coteau priest who recorded the marriage gave the couple's parents' names.) Adolphe and Rosa settled at Mermentau, where they ran a general store. Their son Mark A. was born at Mermentau in c1908; Castex M., called C. M., in c1910; and James Louis, called Jimmy, in c1918.\n\nJames Louis married Adeline, daughter of Léonce Cormier and Zelma Istre. Jimmy, Adeline, and three of their four children--James Louis, Jr., age 16; Deborah, age 14; and Cynthia, age 10--died in an automobile crash on U.S. Highway 90 east of Jennings, Jefferson Davis Parish, on Christmas Day 1965. Oldest daughter Yvette, who was not with her parents and siblings on that fateful evening, was the family's only survivor.\n\n4\n\nYoungest son Zéphirin, born in Lafayette Parish in June 1828, married Célestine, daughter of French Creoles Alexandre Delhomme and Delphine Bergeron, at the Vermilionville church, Lafayette Parish, in July 1855. Their son Alexandre Olivier le jeune was born in Lafayette Parish in May 1856, Louis Didier in c1860 but died at age 2 in December 1862, Jean Didier was born in July 1861, and Evariste in October 1866. In June 1860, the federal census taker in Lafayette Parish counted 4 slaves--3 males and a female, all black, ranging in age from 55 to 13, living in 1 house--on Ziphirin Boudreaux's farm. During the War of 1861-65, Zéphirin, in his early 30s, served as a corporal in Company A of the 18th Regiment Louisiana Infantry, raised in St. James Parish, which fought in Tennessee, Mississippi, and Louisiana, and as a private in Company A of the Consolidated 18th Regiment and Yellow Jacket Battalion Infantry, which fought in Louisiana. He may have been a conscript. A daughter was born in August 1864 when Zéphirin was with his unit in the Red River valley. He survived the war and returned to Lafayette Parish. He is buried in St. John the Evangelist Catholic Cemetery, behind the cathedral in Lafayette.\n\nDescendants of Louis Clairville BOUDREAUX (1823-; Michel, Claude, Étienne, Marin, Étienne)\n\nLouis Clairville, called Clairville, oldest son of David Valentin Boudreaux of Assumption Parish and Marguerite Riche or Richet of Pointe Coupee Parish, born in Lafourche Interior Parish in February 1823, married Marie Adèle or Odile, daughter of Christophe Trosclair and Marie Borne, at the Thibodaux church, Lafourche Interior Parish, in December 1842. He moved his family from upper Bayou Lafourche to near Pattersonville, now Patterson, St. Mary Parish, in the early 1850s. Their daughters married into the Dartes, Korn, and Trosclair families. Two of Clairville's younger brothers, Furcy and Étienne Frédéric, followed him to lower Bayou Teche just before and immediately after the War of 1861-65.\n\n1\n\nOldest son Louis Rodolphe was born near Paincourtville, Assumption Parish, in May 1849.\n\n2\n\nJoseph was born near Pattersonville, now Patterson, St. Mary Parish, in October 1853.\n\n3\n\nJames David was born near Pattersonville, now Patterson, St. Mary Parish, in August 1855.\n\n4\n\nAdam A. was born near Pattersonville, now Patterson, St. Mary Parish, in April 1860.\n\n5\n\nCharles Carlos was born near Pattersonville, now Patterson, St. Mary Parish, in September 1868.\n\n~\n\nOther BOUDREAUXs on the Western Prairies\n\nLocal church and civil records make it difficult to link many Boudreauxs in the western parishes with known lines of the family there:\n\nJoseph Boudreaux married Edvise Holin, perhaps Hulin, place and date unrecorded. Daughter Marie Adelema married Endville, son of French Creole Jacques Arnaud, in a civil ceremony in St. Landry Parish in April 1845.\n\nJoseph Boudreaux married Carmélite Boudreaux, place and date unrecorded. Their son Joseph, fils was born in Lafayette Parish in December 1840.\n\nCharles Boudreaux married Marie Silvanie Boc, place and date unrecorded. Daughter Apolline was born in Lafayette Parish in December 1841.\n\nPierre Béloni Boudreaux married French Canadian Marie Primeaux, place and date unrecorded, and settled near Abbeville, Vermilion Parish, by the late 1840s. Their daughter Aglaé was born near Abbeville in October 1850, son Ursin in December 1852, and daughter Émelia in January 1855.\n\nIn November 1850, the federal census taker in St. Landry Parish counted a single slave--a 12-year-old mulatto female--on Saintville Boudreau's farm. Who was Saintville Boudreaux? Clairville? Damonville? Dupréville? Seville? Treville? One of the ...villes.\n\nOlymphe Boudreaux died in St. Martin Parish in May 1851, age 6. The St. Martinville priest who recorded the girl's burial did not give any parents' names.\n\nAn unnamed child of Joseph Boudreaux died near Grand Coteau, age unrecorded, in August 1851. The priest who recorded the burial did not give the child's mother's name, so one wonders which Joseph Boudreaux the father may have been.\n\n______ Boudreaux married Anna Harrington, place and date unrecorded. Their son Charles was born near Abbeville, Vermilion Parish, in September 1852.\n\nCéleste Boudreaux died in St. Martin Parish in May 1854, age 34.

Was she Céleste, daughter of Olivier Boudreaux and Susanne Breaux, born in Lafayette Parish in September 1824?\n\nLéon Boudreaux died near Abbeville, Vermilion Parish, in December 1854. The priest who recorded the burial said that Léon died \"at age 40 yrs.\" but did not give his parents' names or mention a wife.\n\nJean Clerville Boudreaux married Marie Anesia Dubois, place and date unrecorded. Son Jean Alcide was born in Lafayette Parish in February 1857.\n\nRosalie Boudreaux married Villery Landry at the Pattersonville church, St. Mary Parish, in April 1857.

The priest who recorded the burial did not give the child's mother's name, so one wonders which of the many Joseph Boudreauxs the father may have been.\n\nValérie Boudreaux married Alexandre Louis, son of French Creole Godefroi Pellerin and widower of Madeleine Isida Judice, in a civil ceremony in Lafayette Parish in December 1858. The parish clerk who recorded the marriage did not give the couples' parents' names.\n\nIn 1860, the federal census taker in St. Landry Parish counted a single slave--a 13-year-old black female--on Mary Boudreau's farm.\n\nIn 1860, the federal census taker in St. Landry Parish counted 11 slaves--4 males and 7 females, all black, ranging in age from 45 years to 8 months--on Mary E.

Son Arthur was born near Brashear, now Morgan, City, St. Mary Parish, in December 1861.\n\nEulis Boudreaux married Emelia Hébert, place and date unrecorded.

The parish clerk who recorded the marriage did not give the couples' parents' names.\n\nWilly Boudreaux died in St. Martin Parish in July 1867. The St. Martinville priest who recorded the burial, and who did not give any parents' names, said that Willy died \"at age 8 mths.\" Was he Oscar William, son of Treville Boudreaux of St. Martin Parish?\n\nÉloise Boudreaux, wife of Joseph Savoie, died near Grand Coteau, age 47, in October 1867. Her succession, naming her husband, was filed at the Opelousas courthouse in November.\n\nJulien, fils, son of Julien Boudreaux and L'Ange McJolly, married Estelle, daughter of Aurelien St. Julien and Joséphine Broussard, at the Vermilionville church, Lafayette Parish, in December 1867.\n\nMathilde Boudreaux married Alcide L., son of perhaps French Canadian Pierre Bertrand, in a civil ceremony in St. Landry Parish in July 1868.

The parish clerk who recorded the marriage did not give the couples' parents' names, so one wonders which of the hand full of Symphorien/Syphorien Boudreauxs this might have been. Their son Willis was born in St. Landry Parish in September 1870.\n\nLisia, daughter of Edgard Boudreaux, died near Abbeville, Vermilion Parish, at age 4 in June 1869.

The priest who recorded the marriage, true to form, did not give any parents' names.\n\n.\n\nTwo Boudreaux families that emerged in St. Landry and Lafayette parishes during the antebellum period cannot be linked by area church and civil records to any of the other Boudreauxs in the area:\n\nDescendants of Jean BOUDREAUX (?-?)\n\nJean Boudreaux married Clotilde Kemper or Kenterre, place and date unrecorded. They had at least one son, who settled in St. Landry and Lafayette parishes. Jean, père died perhaps in St. Landry Parish before October 1824.\n\nJean, fils married Éloise or Louise, daughter of Acadians Augustin Dugas and Marie Duhon, at the Grand Coteau church, St. Landry Parish, in October 1824; the priest who recorded the marriage noted that both the groom's and the bride's fathers were deceased at the time of the wedding. Their son Jean Théogène was born in Lafayette Parish in February 1832, and Joseph Hermogène in May 1836. Their daughter married into Simon family.\n\nJoseph Hermogène married Marcellite, daughter of Jean Baptiste Simon, fils and his Acadian wife Célestine Granger, in a civil ceremony in St. Landry Parish in July 1853, and sanctified the marriage at the Opelousas church, St. Landry Parish, in May 1856. They settled near Church Point, then in St. Landry but now in Acadia Parish. Their son Jean le jeune was baptized at the Opelousas church, age 2 months, in August 1856, daughter Mélanie born in April 1859, son Joseph Cléopha in July 1861, and Gulpha David in March 1864.

They had at least one son, who settled in Lafayette Parish.\n\nGustave married Louise Phelonise, called Phelonise, daughter of Charles Washington Campbell and his Acadian wife Céleste Préjean, at the Vermilionville church, Lafayette Parish, in November 1858. They settled near Youngsville. Their son Jean Joseph was born in August 1859, Gustave, fils in September 1861, and Charles Edmond in September 1868.\n\nLOUISIANA: RIVER SETTLEMENTS\n\nFollowing close behind the Boudrots who went to the Bayou Teche valley in 1765 were four other Boudrots who came to Louisiana from Halifax that year. They settled at Cabanocé/St.-Jacques on the river above New Orleans where 20 Acadians from Georgia had settled the year before:\n\nJoseph Boudrot was counted at Cabanocé in April 1766, age unrecorded, with an unnamed woman and an unnamed girl in his household, so he must have reached the colony in 1765 with a wife and daughter whose names have been lost to history. He may have been the Joseph Boudreaux who married Rosalie, daughter of fellow Acadians Joseph Babin and Osite LeBlanc and widow of Benjamin LeBlanc, at Ascension, just upriver from St.-Jacques, in May 1806. The priest who recorded the 1806 marriage said that this Joseph was son of Joseph Boudrot and Anne Blanchard and a native of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\nOlivier Boudrot, age 37, a widower, and his son Simon, age 12, also arrived in 1765. At age 39, Olivier remarried to Anne, daughter of fellow Acadian Pierre Gaudet and Marie Belliveau and widow of Michel Dupuis, at Cabanocé in October 1767. They had no children. Olivier died at St.-Jacques in November 1782; he was only 54 years old. His son Simon carried on the line at St.-Jacques.\n\nÉlisabeth, also called Isabelle, Boudrot, age 43, came to Cabanocé with husband Étienne LeBlanc, age 43, and seven children, ranging in age from 21 to infancy. They, too, remained on the river.\n\nDescendants of Simon BOUDREAUX (c1753-1824; Michel, Claude, Michel)\n\nSimon, son of Olivier Boudrot and his first wife Anne-Marie Dupuis, born probably at Minas in c1753, escaped the British roundup at Minas in the fall of 1755. His family fled to the Gulf of St. Lawrence shore, but British forces eventually captured them and held them in Nova Scotia as prisoners of war. Simon came to Louisiana from Halifax in 1765 with his widowed father and married his stepsister, Monique, daughter of Michel Dupuis and Anne Gaudet, his father's second wife, at St.-Jacques in May 1774, and there they remained. Their daughters married into the Boudreaux, Breaux, and LeBlanc families. In the late 1800s or early 1810s, Simon's married sons crossed the Atchafalaya Basin and settled on upper Bayou Teche. Two of them returned to the river, but the youngest, Olivier le jeune, remained on the Teche. Simon died in St. James Parish in March 1824; he was 70 years old. Two of his grandsons settled in Ascension and St. James parishes, another on upper Bayou Lafourche.\n\n1\n\nOldest son Simon-Pierre dit Simonet, baptized at St.-Jacques, age unrecorded, in December 1778, married Céleste, daughter of fellow Acadians Jean-Jacques Babin and Marguerite Landry, at St.-Jacques in April 1800. They lived for a time at Grand Pointe, on upper Bayou Teche in St. Martin Parish, but returned to the river. Their son Casimir was born at St.-Jacques in May 1801 but died at age 2 in August 1803, Simon Casimir, called Casimir, was born in October 1808, Olivier Gédéon at Grand Pointe in June 1811 but died at age 9 in September 1821 and was buried at Ascension, and Jean Baptiste Adélard, called Adélard, was born in St. James Parish in April 1817. Their daughters married into the Daigle, LeBlanc, and Melançon families. Simonet's sons settled in Ascension, Assumption, and St. James parishes.\n\n1a\n\nCasimir married Marie Henriette, called Henriette, daughter of fellow Acadians Éloi Landry and Madeleine Melançon, at the Convent church, St. James Parish, in February 1835. They lived on upper Bayou Lafourche before returning to the river, where they settled near the boundary between St. James and Ascension parishes. Their son Jean Baptiste Simon was born in January 1844, Joseph Landry, called Landry, in May 1846, Joseph Eugène in April 1848, Joseph Trinidad in February 1850, Simon in June 1852 but died at age 15 in October 1867, and Joseph Émile, called Émile, was born in July 1855 but died at age 5 1/2 in February 1861. Their daughters married into the Bergeron, Krieger, and LeBlanc families and perhaps into the Thomas family as well.\n\nJean Baptiste Simon married Elisa or Eliza, daughter of fellow Acadian Arsène Bourgeois and Augustine Arceneaux, at the Donaldsonville church, Ascension Parish, in April 1866.\n\nJoseph Landry married Lutetia, daughter of Marcellin Junot and his Acadian wife Coralie Babin, at the Donaldsonville church, Ascension Parish, in May 1868. Their son Joseph Lucien, called Lucien, was born in Ascension Parish in February 1870 but died the following July.\n\nJoseph Trinidad married Philomène, daughter of Manuel Aleman and Marie Falcon, at the Donaldsonville church, Ascension Parish, in February 1870. Their son Joseph Simon was born in Ascension Parish in December 1870.\n\n1b\n\nJoseph Baptiste Adélard married Joséphine, daughter of fellow Acadian Narcisse LeBlanc and his Creole wife Joséphine Senette, at the Plattenville church, Assumption Parish, in June 1838. They settled on upper Bayou Lafourche.\n\n2\n\nMichel, born probably at St.-Jacques in c1783, married Théotiste, daughter of fellow Acadians Jean Théodore Bergeron and Théostiste Foret, at St.-Jacques in January 1807. They lived for a time at Anse la Butte on the upper Vermilion River, between present-day Lafayette and Breaux Bridge, before returning to St. James Parish. Their son Michel Ursin, called Ursin, was born in St. James Parish in January 1815. Their daughters married into the Chauvin, Melançon, and Mire families. In September 1850, the federal census taker in St. James Parish counted 7 slaves--3 males and 4 females, all black, ranging in age from 60 to 4--on Michel Boudreau's farm in the parish's Eastern District. In June 1860, the federal census taker in St. James Parish counted 7 slaves again--4 males and 3 females, 3 blacks and 4 mulattoes, ages 70 to 3, living in 2 houses--on Michel Boudreau's farm in the parish's Left Bank 4th District; one of Michel's slaves, a 3-year-old mulatto male, was recorded as \"insane.\" Michel died near Convent, St. James Parish, in October 1864; he was 81 years old. He had only one son, but the son created a family of his own and remained in St. James Parish.\n\nUrsin married Marie Justine, called Justine, daughter of fellow Acadians Étienne Melançon and Marie Louise Lanoux, at the Convent church, St. James Parish, in November 1838; Marie Justine's brother married one of Ursin's sisters. Their son Ursin Saturnin, called Saturnin, was born near Convent in February 1840 but died at age 2 in May 1842, Joseph Audressy, called Audressy, was born in September [1845], M., perhaps a son, in December 1849, and Michel in October 1852. Their daughter married a Lanoux cousin. In June 1860, the federal census taker in Ascension Parish counted a single slave--a 22-year-old mulatto female--on U. Boudreau's farm in the parish's Fifth Ward.\n\nAudressy married cousin Phelonise, daughter of fellow Acadians Cyprien Bourgeois and Amelie Landry, at the Gonzales church, Ascension Parish, in February 1867; they had to secure a dispensation for third to fourth degree of consanguinity in order to marry. Their son Joseph Cyprien was born near Convent, St. James Parish, in January 1868, and Paul Michel in June 1870.\n\n3\n\nOlivier le jeune, born at St.-Jacques in July 1788, married Susanne, daughter of fellow Acadians François Breaux and Silesie Dugas, at the St. Martinville church, St. Martin Parish, in August 1811 and settled in St. Martin Parish.\n\n4\n\nJean-Baptiste, born at St.-Jacques in April 1793, died at age 1 in August 1794.\n\n5\n\nYoungest son Antoine, born at St.-Jacques in October 1795, also may have died young.\n\n~\n\nIn July 1767, a 12-year-old orphan, Marie, daughter of Benjamin Boudrot, reached Louisiana from Maryland with the family of Amand Richard. They settled with other Maryland exiles at St.-Gabriel d'Iberville, on the Acadian Coast above New Orleans, where Marie married cousin Amand, son of fellow Acadians Paul Hébert and Marie-Josèphe Melançon, in September 1776. Amand also had come to Louisiana from Maryland in 1767 and probably had known Marie from childhood. Two of their grandsons became prominent men in Louisiana affairs: Paul Octave Hébert served as governor of Louisiana in the early 1850s, and Paul Octave and his first cousin Louis Hébert rose to the rank of brigadier general during the War of 1861. Marie died near St. Gabriel in August 1847, a widow in her early 90s.\n\n~\n\nAnother contingent of Maryland exiles--a large extended family led by brothers Alexis and Honoré Breau of Pigiguit and Port Tobacco--reached Louisiana in February 1768. With them were three Boudrots:\n\nBrigitte, age 36, daughter of Pierre Boudrot of Pigiguit, came to Louisiana with husband Basile Landry, age 41, and their two daughters, ages 12 and 2. They, along with other members of the Breau clan, were compelled to settle at San Luìs de Natchez, far up the Mississippi in what is now Concordia Parish. But they did not remain there. They crossed the Atchafalaya Basin to the Attakapas District in the 1770s.\n\nMarie-Madeleine, age 35, Brigitte's sister, came to Louisiana with husband Joseph Landry, age 38, and three children ranging in age from 13 to 3. They, too, went to San Luìs de Natchez, where Joseph died in c1771. Marie-Madeleine remarried to Pierre-Sylvain, son of fellow Acadians Pierre Cloistre dit Clouâtre and Marguerite LeBlanc, probably at San Gabriel on the river below Baton Rouge, date unrecorded.\n\nAugustin dit Rémi, son of Pierre Boudrot of Pigiguit, was a 13-year-old orphan when he came to Louisiana from Maryland with the Breau clan. He followed them to San Luìs de Natchez, but he, too, did not remain on the river. In the 1770s, he moved to the Attakapas District, where he married Judith-Philippe, daughter of fellow Acadians Charles Martin and Jeanne Comeaux of Annapolis Royal, in c1777.\n\n~\n\nThe great majority of Boudrots who came to Louisiana arrived a generation after the first of them reached the colony. These were Boudrots from Minas whom the British had exiled to Virginia in the fall of 1755, deported to England the following year, and repatriated to France in 1763; and also Boudrots from Pigiguit and Île St.-Jean whom the British deported to France in 1758-59. After enduring life in the mother country for a quarter of a century, they took up the Spanish government's offer to start a new life in Louisiana. Dozens of them, including over 20 families, reached New Orleans aboard every one of the Seven Ships of 1785. Only four other families--the Héberts, Trahans, Aucoins, and Bourgs--outnumbered the Boudrots on the Seven Ships expedition:\n\nMarguerite Boudrot, age 48, crossed on Le Bon Papa, the first of the Seven Ships, which reached New Orleans in July. With her were second husband Charles Landry, age 56, and seven children, ages 23 to 6. They went to Manchac, south of Baton Rouge, and remained on the river.\n\nFrançoise-Marie Boudrot, age 45, widow of Joseph Clossinet and Marin Dugas, crossed on Le Bon Papa with a Clossinet daughter, age 25, and a Dugas son, age 11. They also went to Manchac, where Françoise remarried to fellow Acadian Charles Daigle, widower of Anne-Marie Vincent, in February 1786. They then moved on to upper Bayou Lafourche, where she died in September 1798, in her 50s.\n\nAnne Boudrot, age 40, widow of Jacques Haché, crossed on Le Bon Papa with two daughters, ages 15 and 11. They went to Manchac and remained on the river.\n\nJean-Baptiste Boudrot, age 32, and wife Marie-Modeste Trahan, age 36, came to Louisiana aboard Le Bon Papa with three children--Marie-Félicité, age 8, Jean-Constant, age 6, and Marguerite-Marie, age 2. They went to the Baton Rouge area, where Jean-Baptiste remarried to Anne-Josèphe, daughter of fellow Acadians Pierre Henry and his first wife Marie-Madeleine Pitre and widow of Théodore Hébert, in February 1786, so his first wife Marie-Modeste died soon after the family reached the colony. In the late 1790s, Jean-Baptiste moved his family to upper Bayou Lafourche.\n\nPaul-Dominique Boudrot, age 22, and wife Marie-Olive Landry, age 18, crossed on Le Bon Papa with their infant son, Paul-Marie. When they reached New Orleans, Marie-Olive was pregnant; son Joseph was born probably at Manchac in early January 1786. The family left Manchac in the early 1790s and moved to upper Bayou Lafourche, where they had many more sons. Paul-Dominique's father Zacharie and younger brothers Charles and Benjamin-Hilaire crossed on a later ship, L'Amitié, and went to upper Bayou Lafourche.\n\nPaul-Marie, age 13, son of François Boudrot and Euphrosine Barillot, crossed on Le Bon Papa with his mother, stepfather Charles Broussard, and four step-siblings. He was counted with them at Baton Rouge in the summer of 1788, but he did not remain there. He followed his once-again-widowed mother to upper Bayou Lafourche.\n\nMarie-Adélaïde, a 5-year-old orphan, daughter of Louis Boudrot, crossed on Le Bon Papa with her maternal grandfather, Jean-Baptiste Dugas, her grandmother, and an aunt. They went to Manchac, but Marie-Adélaïde moved on to upper Bayou Lafourche, where she married twice, first to Eustache Carret, son of fellow Acadians Ignace Carret and Madeleine Clémenceau, in March 1796, and then to Jean Baptiste, son of fellow Acadians Grégoire Blanchard and Marie-Marguerite Livois and widower of Marie-Modeste Aucoin, in July 1813.\n\n.\n\nAnne Boudrot, age 38, crossed on Le Beaumont, the third of the Seven Ships, which reached New Orleans in August. With her were husband Paul LeBlanc, age 40, two daughters, ages 3 and infant, and a 23-year-old Trahan niece. They went to Baton Rouge before moving to upper Bayou Lafourche.\n\nFrançois-Xavier Boudrot, age 25, and wife Marguerite Dugas, age 26, crossed on Le Beaumont with no children. His widowed mother and four younger siblings sailed to Louisiana on a later ship, L'Amitié, and went to upper Bayou Lafourche. François-Xavier remarried and remained at Manchac, where he had more children.\n\n.\n\nÉlisabeth, or Isabelle, Boudrot, age 56, widow of Olivier Thibodeau, crossed on L'Amitié with her was a daughter, age 17. They went to Manchac, but the daughter moved on to upper Bayou Lafourche.\n\nTwo daughters of Pierre Boudrot and Madeleine Bourg of Île St.-Jean--Marie, age 30, wife of Christophe Delaune, age 34, and unmarried Céleste-Sibilias, age 20--crossed on L'Amitié, the fifth of the Seven Ships, with Marie's husband and two of their children, ages 11 and 1. Céleste married into the Guidry family at St.-Jacques and into the Augeron on upper Bayou Lafourche. Marie remained with her husband and children at St.-Jacques.\n\n.\n\nVictor Boudrot, age 55, and second wife Geneviève Richard, age 37, crossed on La Ville d'Archangel, the sixth of the Seven Ships, which reached New Orleans in December. With them were six children by both of his wives--Hélène-Marie-Rose, age 31, wife of Frenchman François-Pierre Le Lorre, age 30, who also came along, Joseph, age 27, Cécile, age 15, Geneviève-Sophie, age 11, Noël-Victor, age 9, and infant Anne-Jeanne--as well as Victor's stepdaughter Geneviève-Marguerite Pitre, age 17. They followed the majority of their fellow passengers to Bayou des Écores, north of Baton Rouge. Victor and Geneviève had no more children in Louisiana. Their younger daughters married into the Calegan, Clément, Navarre, and Silvy families and settled on Bayou Lafourche. Their sons also moved on to Bayou Lafourche, but there is no evidence that oldest son Joseph married.\n\n.\n\nVictor's first cousin Ignace Boudrot, age 36, and wife Anne Pierson, age 26, a Frenchwoman, crossed on La Caroline, the last of the Seven Ships, which reached New Orleans in December. With them was son Charles, age 2. They went to Bayou des Écores, where they had another son.\n\n.\n\nMost of the Boudrots who went to river settlements in 1785 moved on to upper Bayou Lafourche, but some of them remained on the river:\n\nMarguerite Boudreaux, widow of Charles Landry, died in Ascension Parish in December 1826, in her early 90s.\n\nDescendants of Ignace BOUDREAUX (c1748-?; Michel, Charles)\n\nIgnace Boudrot, grandson of Charles Boudrot and great-grandson of the family's Acadian progenitor, Michel, was born probably in British Nova Scotia in c1748. In August 1752, he was living at Grande-Anse on the south coast of Île St.-Jean with the family of his uncle Antoine Boudrot. In 1758, he was deported with them to France aboard the British transport Supply, which reached St.-Malo in March 1759; he was 10 years old, though he appears as age 8 on the passenger roll. Ignace lived at St.-Servan, near St.-Malo, from 1759 to 1772. In January 1772, now grown and a carpenter by trade, he secured permission from French authorities to work at Morlaix, where he became a member of the Royal Artillery Corps. He married Frenchwoman Anne Pierson in c1780. They moved first to the port city of Nantes and then to the Acadian enclave at Belle-Île-en-Mer, off the southwestern coast of Brittany, where Spanish officials counted them in September 1784. Ignace sailed to Louisiana in 1785 with his wife and 2-year-old son Charles aboard La Caroline, the last of the Seven Ships. They settled at the new Acadian community of Bayou des Écores, north of Baton Rouge, where his first cousin Victor settled. Anne gave him at least one more son in Louisiana. One wonders what became of them.\n\n1\n\nOldest son Jean-Baptiste, born in France in c1781, died in St.-Nicolas Parish, Nantes, in October 1783, age 2.\n\n2\n\nCharles, born in St.-Nicolas Parish, Nantes, France, in September 1783 and baptized by the Pointe Coupée priest who served the Bayou des Écores community in June 1792, may have been the Charles Boudreaux who died in Ascension Parish in September 1830; the Donaldsonville priest who recorded this burial, and who did not give any parents' names or mention a wife, said that Charles was 50 years old when he died; Charles, son of Ignace, would have been 47. Or he may have been the Charles Boudreaux who died near Labadieville, Assumption Parish, in June 1857; the priest who recorded the burial, and who also did not give any parents' names or mention a wife, said that Charles died at \"age 75 years\"; Charles, son of Ignace, would have been 73. One wonders if this Charles ever married. If not, this line of the family died with him.\n\n3\n\nYoungest son Louis, born probably at Bayou des Écores in September 1789 and baptized by a Pointe Coupée priest in May 1790, may have died young.\n\nDescendants of François-Xavier BOUDREAUX (1760-1798; Michel, Charles, Jean-Baptiste)\n\nFrançois-Xavier, called Xavier, second son of Antoine Boudrot and Brigitte Apart, born at Trigavou, France, near St.-Malo, in March 1760, crossed on Le Beaumont, the third of the Seven Ships, with his bride, Marguerite, daughter of fellow Acadians Claude Dugas and his second wife Marguerite Cyr. The couple had married at St.-Martin de Chantenay, near Nantes, in May 1785, only weeks before their ship set sail. Marguerite was a native of Boulogne-sur-Mer in Normandy. They settled at San Gabriel de Manchac, just south of the Baton Rouge District, where Marguerite died in August 1786 after giving birth to daughter Louise-Isabelle, who followed her mother to the grave two months later. Francois-Xavier remarried to Marie-Francoise, daughter of fellow Acadians Joseph LeBlanc and Anne Hébert, at San Gabriel in May 1787. Marie-Francoise was a native of St.-Servan, also near St.-Malo, and came to Louisiana aboard Le St.-Rémi, the fourth of the Seven Ships. Their daughters married into the Acoste, Tircuit, and Trosclair families. Francois-Xavier died near St.-Gabriel in February 1798; he was only 37 years old. Some of his sons and grandsons also died young, and only one of them may have married; they also settled in Iberville Parish, but none of the lines, except for its blood, seems to have survived.\n\n1\n\nOldest son Joseph, born near St.-Gabriel in July 1788, died at St. Gabriel, Iberville Parish, in June 1810. He was only 22 years old and did not marry.\n\n2\n\nJérôme, born near St.-Gabriel in June 1791, married Marcellite, daughter of Ger"
