        "text": "Date and place of birth\n\naround 1365, Venice\n\nDate and place of death\n\naround 1430, France\n\nFamily\n\nMother: Born in Venice to a bourgeois family from Forli in Romagna (Italy).\n\nFather: Tommaso da Pizzano, born around 1318 in Bologna (the noble family originated from Pizzano, a small place in the vicinity of Bologna), died 1387 in Paris.\n\nMarriage and Family Life\n\nBorn in Venice, Christine de Pizan spent the first years of her life in Bologna. She travelled at the age of four with her mother and brothers to Paris where her father had become a physician and astrologer at the court of Charles V. Her two brothers, Paulus and Aghinulfus, returned after the death of their father to take up their Bolognese inheritance. At the age of fifteen, Christine married Etienne de Castel (b. 1346, d.1390), a promising young royal secretary. Three children resulted from this marriage, but the names and destinies of only two are known. A daughter, her firstborn child, entered the Royal Priory of Poissy as a companion to Charles VI’s daughter, Marie, in September 1397. It is not known when she died. Her oldest son, Jean, born around 1385, would become a royal secretary like his father. He married Jehanne Coton in 1416. He was twelve in 1398, when he travelled to England to be a companion to the son of John Montagu, Earl of Salisbury. He was back to Paris in 1402 and may have been one of the copyists of his mother’s texts. Later he wrote a poem, Le Pin (1422-1424), which echoes them. Jean de Castel died in 1425. Nothing is known of the third child mentioned in the autobiographical narrative in L’Advision Cristine.\n\nEducation\n\nChristine’s father taught her or had her taught the rudiments of Latin as well as how to read and write in the vernacular. In one place she describes the education she received as mere crumbs from the table of learning. Nevertheless, even as a child, she was spending enough time at her lessons for her mother to complain that it was keeping her from engaging in household tasks. Once she had emerged from financial troubles caused by her husband’s death, she began to write poetry and turned to a solitary life of study. She regretted that during the lives of her father and husband she had been too preoccupied with household duties and with bearing and caring for her children to have paid proper attention to the knowledge they might have transmitted to her. From this period, she began to acquaint herself with all the ancient history and philosophical poetry that was accessible to her. Boethius’ Consolation of Philosophy, Dante’s Divine Comedy, Ovid’s Metamorphosis, as well as the history of Troy and the ancient history up to Julius Caesar were important early influences.\n\nReligion: Catholic\n\nA French narrative of the Passion of Our Savior made at the request of the queen of France in 1398, the Passion de Jhesu nostre sauveur, known as Passion Isabeau, is sometimes attributed to Christine. Her texts of piety were among the most appreciated in the 15th century (Oroyson Nostre Seigneur, illustrated by a Man of Sorrows). The layout of the first manuscripts of her Epistre Othea are based on the model of a glossed Bible, and the religious meaning this text gives to mythological stories reveal a temptation to be a word of authority in the field, but Christine never crossed the line and kept away from the religious controversies of her time. When she had to flee from Paris in 1418 under threat from the Burgundians, she retired in an abbey somewhere in France, possibly as a nun.\n\nTransformation\n\nIn her allegorical, rhymed, universal history, Le Livre de la mutacion de Fortune Christine describes herself as being transformed from a woman into a man after the death of her husband. Having been widowed, she found herself in a parlous economic position, with debts owed by her husband for property that had reverted to the crown. She had great difficulty gaining access to money owed to her, and at one point she found herself involved in cases in four different courts. This experience made her bitterly aware of the misfortune of being a woman and of the difficulties facing widows. Yet she overcame her tribulations, initially finding her voice as a courtly poet. After being commissioned to write a history of Charles V she turned to writing in prose and produced a series of important political and early feminist works.\n\nFamiliarity with Aristotle transformed her understanding of the causes of women’s parlous social status. She came to recognise the deleterious influence of opinion and set out to oppose the misogynous claims of philosophers and poets from Aristotle to Jean de Meun and Matheoleus. In The Book of the City of Ladies she no longer represents herself as transformed into a man but proposes that the women who accept male lies concerning their nature are like the fool who believed that he had been transformed into a woman, having been dressed in women’s clothes while asleep.\n\nShe became her own scribe, editor, and producer of manuscripts, which encompassed all the contemporary genres.\n\nContemporaneous Network(s)\n\nAlthough her poetic self-image casts her as lamenting in solitude the loss of her husband, Christine’s patrons, friends, and acquaintances included many members of the extended royal court, clerics, intellectuals, and particularly women. Valentina Visconti, wife of Charles VI’s brother, Louis of Orleans, was an early patron, and the queen Isabella of Bavaria (later known by the vocalized form of the name, Isabeau) also paid her for various works ultimately commissioning the luxury collection, Harley 4431, now in the British Library.\n\nChristine calls Anne of Bourbon/Montpensier a friend whom she loved. Anne, the daughter of Catharine de la Marche, duchess of Castres, had been Mary of Berry’s sister-in-law and after being widowed as a result of the disaster of Nicopolis, she married Isabeau of Bavaria’s brother, Louis. Another patron, Charles d’Albret, was also related to Isabeau, suggesting Christine’s close connection with members of the nobility associated with Isabeau’s court. In her dedicatory epistle to the Livre du debat sur le Rommant de la Rose (1402), she calls herself chambermaid to queen Isabeau, which implies official functions rewarding her advice. The distribution to princes and lords of her Epistre à la reine (1405), which supports the political role of the queen, shows Christine acting as a propagandist of Isabella’s peace policy.\n\nWorks/Agency\n\nThe diversity, quantity, and quality of Christine’s oeuvre is outstanding, not simply for her time but for an intellectual of any time. She was not merely an author, but also the scribe, designer, and publisher of many of the early manuscripts of her works. She was a courtly poet, debating the nature of love and the dangers to both men and women of foolish love, seduction, and disappointment in works such as Cent Ballades, Le Livre du debat de deux amans, Le Livre des trois jugemens, Le Dit de Poissy, Le Dit de la pastoure, and Le Livre du duc des vrais amans. She was a critic of men’s treatment of women and of their misogynistic literary representations, and a defender of women’s moral and intellectual equality with men, who argued in Le Dit de la rose, L’Epistre du dieu d’amours, Le Debat sur le Roman de la Rose, L’Advision Cristine, and Le Livre de la cité des dames that men and women are different bodily forms of one species, equally endowed with immaterial souls, who should be as equally valued and benefitted as men. She produced hybrid works combining mythological, historical, allegorical, and political elements such as L’Epistre Othea, Le Livre du chemin de longue estude, Le Livre de la mutacion de Fortune, as well as more conventional works of history and political advice in Le Livre des fais et bonnes meurs du sage roi Charles V, Le Livre du corps de policie, Le Livre de paix, and Le Livre des trois vertus, unusual in being a mirror for princesses and other women. She compiled a practical manual of warfare, Le Livre de fais d’armes et de chevalerie, bringing to non-Latinate knights the classical knowledge of Vegetius and Frontinus, and intervened in the political events and crises of the conflict between the Burgundians and Armagnacs in L’Epistre à la reine and Lamentacion. She wrote works of spiritual consolation, Sept Psaulmes allegorisés, Oroison Nostre Dame, Epistre de la prison de la vie humane, and Heures de contemplacion sur la Passion de Nostre Seigneur Jhesucrist, while her last work, celebrating the achievements of Joan of Arc, is one of the earliest and most important sources of the prophetic mission that Joan had appeared to fulfill.\n\nFor reasons of economy but above all to ensure the correction of copies of her texts in the absence of copyright and to keep control of their distribution, Christine launched her own private copying workshop. It involved a mastery of book production, writing styles, and rules of page layout at a time before the invention of the printing press. The fifty extant original manuscripts produced under her supervision, more than any other medieval writer, testify to its effectiveness. These manuscripts were not sold but ‘given’ on special occasions, mainly for New Years Eve, in expectation of reciprocal reward. The copies intended for princes were illustrated with miniatures painted by the best illuminators in Paris, some named after her works (Othea Master, Master of the City of Ladies and the newly baptized “Maître de la Pastoure”). Among the border decorators she employed was an “enlumineresse,” Anastaise, praised in the Cité des dames. The author portrait often placed at the opening of her books highlights Christine as an authority figure. It imprints on people’s minds to this day the moral image of the solitary “lady in blue” in her study. The traditional scene of handing over the book to a patron served as a reminder of the gift and called for reward and consideration in return. In the Harley manuscript, a vivid view of the queen’s ceremonial chamber is thus emphasized as a site of female, regal authority. Christine also gave instructions for cycles of images: the Epistre Othea, conceived as an illustrated text, was enhanced by a hundred miniatures, which are part of the work. She renewed compositions (the wheel of Fortune, the unclassical Perseus mounted on Pegasus, Death as a deity, the “sons” of the Planets) that were influential over centuries, revealing her as a brilliant iconographer.\n\nAt least one of her ballads, Dueil engoisseus, was set to music by a contemporary, the Flemish composer Gilles Binchois (b. ca. 1400, d. 1460).\n\nContemporaneous Identifications\n\nAs one of the first readers in France of Dante, Petrarch and Boccaccio, but also as a correspondent for academics such as Jean de Montreuil, Jean Gerson and the Col brothers, Christine de Pizan is part of the milieu of French pre-humanism. Guillebert de Mets, in his nearly contemporary description of Paris (1434), mentions her as having written treatises in Latin and French.\n\nReputation\n\nThe high status of her patrons—who included the dukes of Orleans, Burgundy, and Berry—and value of the gifts that she received in recognition of the manuscripts that she presented to them, attest to Christine’s excellent reputation as a producer of luxury books during her lifetime. After her death, she did not completely disappear from view and was memorialised by Martin le Franc in 1441 as equal to Cicero in eloquence and to Cato in wisdom. In many instances, her works lived on without her authorship being acknowledged. Between 1488 and 1549 various printed editions of Fais d’armes et de chevalerie appeared in French and in English translation, but the preface was removed in order to make the author pass for a man. The Epistre Othea was similarly printed in both languages. The Livre des trois vertus was printed in French and Portuguese, the Cité des dames and Corps de policie appeared in English in 1521, a Dutch translation of Cité des dames was printed, and in 1549 a prose version of the Chemin de long estude de Dame Christine de Pise appeared. In 1478, the English translation of her Proverbes moraux was one of the earliest works printed by Caxton. Between 1549 and 1786 she came to the attention of various bibliophiles, but it was only in 1786 that Louise de Keralio-Robert republished a biography, due to Boivin, and in the second and third volumes of her Collection des meilleurs ouvrages françois: composés par des femmes, dédiée aux femmes françoises edited sections of a large proportion of Christine’s works, many of which had previously only existed in manuscript. So it appears that Christine ‘of Pisa’ was never completely forgotten. She was known to 19th century historians for her history of Charles V and testimony on Joan of Arc and appreciated in the beginning of the 20th for her verses after Roy’s edition of her poetry. Since then, despite the disparaging and misogynistic judgement from Gustave Lanson, who in his Histoire de la littérature française of 1920 calls Christine an “unbearable bluestocking,” her reputation and influence have grown. Simone de Beauvoir mentioned her, though somewhat dismissively, in The Second Sex. Now, due to the hard work of many female and a few male scholars, modern editions and English translations of most of her works have become available; the most famous today being the City of Ladies. Nevertheless, the widespread recognition she deserves for the important place that she occupied in the history of European political thought has not yet been attained.\n\nLegacy and Influence\n\nThe Livre des fais d’armes et de chevalerie is one of the earliest European texts on the laws of war, to the point that Christine de Pizan has been presented as the “mother of international law.”\n\nChristine entered contemporary popular culture in 1979 after being given a place at Judy Chicago’s Dinner Party.\n\nThe international Christine de Pizan Society has held important conferences dedicated to the discussion of her life and works since 1992.\n\nHonoré Champion published a collection, Etudes Christiniennes.\n\nHer works, particularly those relevant to the status of women, are now taught in many university courses.\n\nCurrent Identification(s)\n\nHistory, political philosophy, feminism, art history, poetry, literary theory, paleography\n\nThe richness of Christine’s work now justifies a new field of research at the crossroads of literary studies, codicology, political philosophy, gender and art history, the so-called “études christiniennes.”\n\nClusters\n\nMany dedicatees of Christine’s works were knights and male rulers (seneschal Jean de Werchin, constable Charles d’Albret, the dauphin Louis of Guyenne, Duke Jean of Berry, etc.), especially for her manual of warfare. She seems to have had a direct influence on orders of chivalry founded for the defense of women and of widows threatened with spoliation and verbal abuse (in 1399: the Green Shield or Ordre de la dame blanche à l’écu vert by marshal Boucicaut and Charles d’Albret; in 1401: the Cour amoureuse of King Charles VI, founded by the Dukes of Bourbon and Burgundy, of which Jean de Castel was a member), including her own Order of the Rose in 1402, whether fictitious or not. But her educational role with this male readership does not seem to have withstood the upheavals of the end of the 15th century, and by the beginning of the 16th her Dit de la rose bothered a male reader at the English Court, most probably Henry VIII himself.\n\nLater, European queens, princesses, and duchesses, from Isabelle of Portugal, wife of Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, Anne of France, daughter of Louis XI, Marguerite of Burgundy, Louise of Savoy and her daughter Marguerite of Navarre, to Elizabeth I of England, variously disseminated or knew some of Christine’s works, owned “City of Ladies” tapestries, and represented themselves as prudent monarchs, in line with the representations of noble queenship that she had developed.\n\nAs late as the 17th century, there is evidence of Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle having access to the Queen’s manuscript, while in the 18th century, female descendants of the Cavendish/Harley line, which possessed this manuscript, were prominent as friends and patrons of intellectual women, including Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, Elizabeth Montagu and Elizabeth Elstob.\n\nLouise Keralio-Robert was the first to seriously analyse and edit selections from her works.\n\nSearch Terms\n\nCharles V of France, Charles VI of France, Charles VII of France, Isabeau of Bavaria, Louis of Guyenne, dauphin of France, Louis of Orleans, Cabochien revolt, Burgundian/Armagnac conflict, Joan of Arc, Romance of the Rose, courtly love, defense of women.\n\nReferences in existing schemas\n\nBlanche of Castille was one of the queens regent praised by Christine in her Cité des dames. The 1521 English translation of the Cité des dames appeared during Catharine of Aragon’s campaign for her daughter’s right to rule.\n\nPrimary (selected):\n\nPizan, Christine de. 1886.
