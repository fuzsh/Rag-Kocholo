        "text": "Biography\n\nFuad was born on 16 January 1952. He ascended the throne on 26 July 1952 upon the abdication of his father King Farouk I following the Egyptian Revolution of 1952. Farouk had hoped that his abdication would appease the revolutionaries and other anti-royalist forces, and that his son could serve as a unifying force for the country. However, the infant king reigned for less than a year until 18 June 1953, when Egypt was declared a republic. Fuad II was the 11th and last monarch of the Muhammad Ali Dynasty, which had ruled Egypt (and later Sudan) since 1805. His name is sometimes spelled Fouad.\n\nFuad was less than a year old at the time of his accession to the throne, thus he was never formally crowned. Upon Farouk's abdication, the now former king was exiled, and the new King Fuad left Egypt with him and his family. The Council of Regency headed by Prince Muhammad Abdel Moneim formally represented Fuad in Egypt during his absence.\n\nAfter being deposed, Fuad was brought to Switzerland, where he was raised. He later emigrated to Paris where he married and had three children before returning to Switzerland after his divorce.\n\nMarriage and children\n\nIn 1976, the former king married Dominique-France Picard (nee Loeb, born 1948), the daughter of Robert Loeb and his wife, Paule Picard. She converted from Judaism to Islam and assumed the title Queen Fadila of Egypt. The couple had three children before they divorced in 1996.\n\nTheir children are:\n\nHRH Muhammad Ali, Prince of the Sa'id (born 5 February 1979). Married Princess Noal Zaher, daughter of Prince Muhammed Daoud Pashtunyar Khan on 30 August 2013.\n\nHRH Princess Fawzia-Latifa (born 12 February 1982).\n\nHRH Prince Fakhr Eddin (born 25 August 1987).\n\nIn May 2010, he recorded a television interview with \"ON TV\" talking about his visit to Egypt, and how he felt about the Egyptian people, and their view of his late father.\n\nTitles and styles\n\n16 January 1952 – 26 July 1952: His Royal Highness The Prince of the Sa'id.\n\n26 July 1952 – 18 June 1953: His Majesty The King."
