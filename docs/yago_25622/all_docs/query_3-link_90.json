        "text": "Land Tenure and Family Conflict: the Honor of Vendôme, c. 1006-1040\n\nIntroduction: The editor of the cartulary from which I have translated this text dates the following narrative to \"c.1032\". This must be seen as a very rough approximation. More recent scholarship will have undoubtedly better specified the date and circumstances under which the county of Vendôme passed from its 'native' dynasy into the hands of the counts of Anjou. Cf. Bernard Bachrach, Fulk Nerra, the Neo-Roman Consul, 987-1040 (Berkeley, 1993) and Dominique Barthélemy, La société dans le comté de Vendôme de l'an mil au XIVe siècle (Paris: Fayard, 1993). At this point I have not bothered to check the editor's date(s) against these more recent historians.\n\nTEXT:\n\nHow the Honor of Vendôme Came into the Hands of Count Geoffrey\n\nJust as we believe it has been made manifest in the record of the notice of many predecessors, after Bishop Rainald, son of Count Bouchard, the honor of Vendôme remained in the hand of Fulk, count of the Angevins. Furthermore, Fulk had married the sister of the dead bishop [ie., Elisabeth], with whom he produced no sons and only one daughter [Adela]; this inheritance belonged to this daughter by right of the closest heir [cui jure propinquioris heredis hereditas ipsa proveniebat]. While he was still alive the dead bishop had delivered this daughter of count Fulk - indeed, his own granddaughter - to a certain powerful man [cuidam potenti] with whom she was married for a long time [Note 1]. She [Adela] had four sons by this powerful man [Odo of Nevers], of whom the firstborn was named Bouchard; having received the county after the death of her grandfather, the bishop, she delivered it to her father, Count Fulk, so that he might raise the boy and preserve the honor, which came to the son from the mother, forever for the boy. And Count Fulk raised the boy until he was able to rule wisely, and then he delivered the honor to the boy. When the boy had received his inheritance, he, with the advice of consul Fulk, who had acknowledged and raised him, subjected the entire honor to the testimony of men who knew how the honor had existed under the hand of his ancestor, the bishop, and [who knew] which [parts] had come from ancient gifts or distraint, and how those parts that had been invaded by whomever might be returned to his lordship so as to conform to the domainal holdings of the bishop [a loose translation to preserve the sense of the passage]. So when he came to the forest of Gastines and saw that it had been eradicated in many places and invaded by many plunderers, Bouchard ordered the houses built by these invaders to be burned and ordered, as is only just, the fields that they had sown to be harvested for his own profit. Afterwards this the honor of which we speak [ie., Vendôme] was given to Count Geoffrey, son of Count Fulk and uncle of the boy, with the consent of the mother, her son, and Henry, king of the French. Count Geoffrey received the honor from the king through this agreement, namely that the mother and the boy would hold it from him; and this was the arrangement for the rest of the boy's life. Not long after he had died, it happened that his father died, and so his mother along with another brother, named Fulk, returned to her father and her brother, Count Geoffrey. And the count [Geoffrey] restored the honor to his sister, who substituted her remaining son [Fulk l'Oison] in the honor in the place of his dead brother; this was done such that he would do service [serviret] for the whole honor, even though she would retain half of it. And after the mother and son had been coexisting in the divided honor [for some time], the son began to commit many crimes against his mother. When she could no longer endure this, the extremely sad mother began to consider how her son, a rebel against his mother, might be disinherited of his honor, which belonged to her from it origin. For it did not seem fitting that he who dishonored his mother should possess through her the honor of the inheritance. On account, therefore, of the injuries [molestias] which he had suffered from her son, she sold that half of the honor which she had retained to Count Geoffrey, her brother, and humbly indicated to him how much she had had to endure from her son. Whence consul Geoffrey commanded his nephew to come to him, and the count zealously began to heap abuse on him with words and exhortation concerning the evil which he had inflicted on his mother. But the nephew would not correct his behavior towards his mother; rather, he built fortifications and castles [munitiones et castra] against his lord and uncle, and assailed that part of the honor which he had obtained from his mother with grave injuries. On account of all this, and according to the law concerning rebels and desertors [juxta legem desertoris et rebellis], his lord, Count Geoffrey, deprived him of the honor which he held from the count. Then Geoffrey marched through every part of the county, subjugating it to his lordship, and whatever had been seized or plundered by anyone he restored to its fulness, so that it equalled what Bishop Rainald had formerly possessed. And when he had come to the forest of Gastines, he saw it destroyed by new buildings and filled with the labor of those who had encroached upon it on whatever occasion. Geoffrey discovered whatever had been devastated or seized through the testimony of forestors, who had known [agnoverant] the forest during the time of Bishop Rainald, and restored everything to his own lordship. For that reason he took and held in his hand and lordship the houses, the cultivated fields, and whatever he found in this forest according to the model made in the time of the aforesaid bishop.\n\nNOTES:\n\n1. The principals of the story are as follows. Rainald, bishop of Paris, was the son of Bouchard the Old, count of Vendome (Bouchard the Old was dead by 1005). Fulk Nerra, count of the Angevins, was count between 987 and 1040. Fulk's first wife was Elisabeth, daughter of Bouchard the Old of Vendome; Elisabeth married Fulk before 990 and was dead (burned at the stake for adultery) by 1000. Fulk and Elisabeth had a daughter named Adela, who went on to marry Odo, the second son of Landry, count of Nevers, and Matilda, daughter of Odo the Great, count of Burgundy. Adela and Odo had four sons: Bouchard the Bald, Fulk l'Oison, Guy, and a fourth whose name is unknown. Fulk Nerra married a second time, to Hildegard, by whom he had Geoffrey Martel (born 1006). Thus Adela and Geoffrey Martel were half-siblings. Although Geoffrey Martel only became count in 1040 when his father died, he had been exercising comital lordship in Anjou and the Touraine in his father's place for many years prior to this date. Translator's note: I have not had time to verify the genealogical information provided by the abbé Métais in his edition of the cartulary. I do not stand by his now-dated dates or genealogies. For further and/or better information, one might well consult Bernard Bachrach, Fulk Nerra, the Neo-Roman Consul, 987-1040 (Berkeley, 1993).\n\nSOURCE:\n\nCartulaire de l'abbaye cardinale de la Trinité de Vendôme, ed.
