        "text": "Fuad II is the King of Egypt since he became King as an infant in the year 1952, but he was overthrown and the Egyptian Republic was proclaimed. He was restored as King of Egypt after the Muslim Brotherhood was destroyed and disbanded by Saudi Arabian fighters.\n\nHistory[]\n\nEarly History[]\n\nThe son of King Farouk and his second wife Queen Narriman, Crown Prince Ahmed Fuad was born on 16 January 1952 in Abdeen Palace. He was delivered at 8:30 a.m. and named after his grandfather Fuad I. Fuad had three half-sisters from Farouk's previous marriage with Queen Farida: princesses Farial, Fawzia and Fadia. As women could not inherit the Egyptian throne Farouk's first cousin, Prince Mohammed Ali Tewfik, was heir presumptive until Fuad's birth. Immediately following his birth, Fuad was granted the title of Prince of the Sa'id. He was styled accordingly as Ahmed Fuad, Prince of the Sa'id.\n\nOn 23 July 1952, the Free Officers led by Mohamed Naguib and Gamal Abdel Nasser orchestrated a military coup, thus beginning the Egyptian revolution. On 26 July, Farouk was ordered to abdicate in favour of the crown prince and leave Egypt. Farouk abdicated and went into exile in Italy. His family, including Fuad, joined him in exile. By stepping down, Farouk had wished that the forces opposing the monarchy would be placated, and that Fuad could unify the country during his reign.\n\nRegency[]\n\nOn Farouk's abdication, the army proclaimed that Fuad was now King Fuad II of Egypt and the Sudan. The country was now ruled by Nasser, Naguib and the other Free Officers. Naguib promised to maintain a constitutional monarchy with a regency council holding power until Fuad came of age. Fuad's constitutional powers were assumed by the Cabinet until 2 August 1952, when a regency body, but not a council, was established. Prince Muhammad Abdel Moneim was appointed regent and led the body. The regency body had no actual powers, however, these having been effectively assumed by the Revolutionary Command Council which was led by Naguib. The body was dissolved on 7 September 1952 and Moneim was appointed the sole prince regent, though he still had no actual powers when serving in this role.\n\nThe monarchy was formally abolished on 18 June 1953: Egypt was declared a republic for the first time in its history, and Naguib became its first ever President. Fuad was officially deposed and stripped of his royal titles.\n\nAfter Deposition[]\n\nFollowing Fuad's deposition, Fuad and his half-sisters were sent to live in Switzerland while Farouk remained in Italy, settling in Rome. Queen Narriman returned to Egypt in 1953 after wanting a divorce, and Farouk insisted that Fuad remain abroad. In 1958, Fuad was stripped of his Egyptian citizenship.\n\nFarouk would visit Fuad two or three times each year before the former's unexpected death, possibly from a heart attack, in 1965, when Fuad was 13 years-old. Fuad believes that Farouk was \"poisoned by enemies\". When he died, there were rumours in the press that he had been poisoned by Egyptian intelligence, though there is no known evidence to confirm this. After Farouk's death, Fuad was guaranteed protection by Prince Rainier III of Monaco and his wife Princess Grace. Fuad would later become friends with Rainier in his early adulthood, when he visited Monte Carlo every summer. He has a Mon√©gasque passport, on which he is named His Royal Highness Prince Ahmed Fouad Farouk.\n\nGrowing up, Fuad and his half-sisters lived in Cully, a small village on Lake Geneva, under the care of a nanny, governess and bodyguard. Fuad attended the local public school where he was bullied and then went to middle school in Lausanne, before later attending the Institut Le Rosey, an elite and prestigious private boarding school. He completed his secondary education, obtaining a French baccalaureate, before studying at the University of Geneva. He graduated with a degree in politics and economics in 1975.\n\nIn 1973, President Anwar Sadat lifted Fuad's and his half-sisters' exile. Fuad's Egyptian citizenship was restored in 1974. He has occasionally visited Egypt ever since, with his first visit occurring in 1991. During Hosni Mubarak's presidency, Fuad would notify the president of his arrival, who would then guarantee his personal safety during his visit. On his Egyptian passport he has no titles and is simply identified as Ahmed Fuad.\n\nRestoration as King[]\n\nThe Saudi Arabians had gotten involved in the Arab Spring by creating monarchist proxy groups in various autocratic republics in Arabia and one of those Arab Countries was Egypt who was ruled by the Muslim Brotherhood since the death of Anwar Sadat whom they killed in 1980. The Saudis created a monarchist proxy group by using propaganda to manipulate Egyptian Rebels into having the ambition to restore the Egyptian monarchy by showing the glory days of Egypt under monarchical rule in order to manipulate Egyptian Menials, and Gen-Z Egyptians into supporting the return of the Egyptian Monarchy. The Egyptian Actresses who married into the royal family had used their wealth to also back the monarchist proxies by winning the favoritism of more young Egyptians who are desperate for an end to corruption in Egypt.\n\nThe Monarchist revolution in Egypt was successful as the monarchy under Fuad II was restored as the ruling regime of Egypt and Fuad II was crowned the newly restored King of Egypt. However the Muslim Brotherhood is causing trouble and is trying to overthrow the newly restored King and end all hopes of liberal reform for Egypt.\n\nMarriages[]\n\nFuad immigrated to Paris after graduating from university. In Paris, he set up a real estate business and married Dominique-France Loeb-Picard, a Jewish woman of Alsatian origin, in a civil ceremony in Paris on 16 April 1976. She then converted to Sunni Islam, and the two had a religious wedding in Monaco on 5 October 1977. Leob-Picard changed her name to Fadila Farouk. Egyptian monarchists addressed her as Queen Fadila of Egypt, a nickname coined by the media. She then formally assumed the title of Queen of Egypt. In 1996, she and Fuad divorced, and he stripped her of her title.\n\nPrince Muhammad Ali, Prince of the Sa'id (born 5 February 1979), married Egyptian actress Mai Ezz Eldin (b. 1980) in the year of 2004, they have two sons\n\nPrince Fuad of Egypt (b. 2006)\n\nPrince Muhammad of Egypt (b. 2008)\n\nPrincess Fawzia-Latifa (born 12 February 1982), married French Businessman Sylvain Renaudeau (b. 1979) in the year of 2019, they have two children (one son and one daughter)\n\nNael Fouad Jean\n\nDunya Nariman Adele\n\nPrince Fakhruddin of Egypt (born 25 August 1987), married Egyptian actress Yasmine Sabri (b. 1988), in the year of 2009 they have one son.\n\nPrince Khufu of Egypt (b. 2009)\n\nAfter his divorce with Dominique-France Loeb-Picard, Fuad II had then married Parveen Babi (b. 1954), an Indian actress two years younger than him that is of Muslim faith. They married in the year 1996 after Fuad II divorced his wife and they had one son."
