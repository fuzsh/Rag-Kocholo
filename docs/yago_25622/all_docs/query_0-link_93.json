He was overthrown in the 1952 military coup d'état and forced to abdicate in favor of his infant son Ahmed Fuad, who succeeded him as Fuad II. He died in exile in Italy.\n\nHis sister Princess Fawzia Fuad was the first wife and Queen consort of theShah of Iran Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.[4]\n\nContents\n\n[hide]\n\n* 1Early life and education\n\n* 2Reign\n\n* 3Overthrow\n\n* 4Exile and death\n\n* 5Marriages and affairs\n\n* 5.1Children\n\n* 6Hobbies\n\n* 6.1Coin collection\n\n* 6.2Style\n\n* 7Titles, styles and honours\n\n* 7.1Titles\n\n* 7.2Honours\n\n* 7.2.1National dynastic honours\n\n* 7.2.2Foreign honours\n\n* 8In popular culture\n\n* 9Ancestry\n\n* 10See also\n\n* 11Further reading\n\n* 12References\n\n* 13External links\n\nEarly Life and Education[Edit]\n\nKing Farouk was born _His Sultanic Highness_ Prince Farouk bin Fuad atAbdeen Palace, Cairo, the eldest child of Sultan Fuad I of Egypt and Sudan (later King Fuad I), and his second wife, Nazli Sabri on 11 February 1920.[5][6]King Farouk of Egypt was of 10/16 Circassian (bilineal), 3/16 Turkish(bilineal), 2/16 French (matrilineal) and 1/16 Albanian (patrilineal) descent.[7][8][9]\n\nIn addition to his sisters, Fawzia, Faiza, Faika and Fathia,[10] he had two half-siblings from his father's previous marriage to Princess Shwikar Khanum Effendi.\n\nBefore his father's death, he was educated at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, England.\n\nReign[Edit]\n\nUpon his coronation, the 16-year-old King Farouk made a public radio address to the nation, the first time a sovereign of Egypt had ever spoken directly to his people in such a way:\n\n“\n\nAnd if it is God's will to lay on my shoulders at such an early age the responsibility of kingship, I on my part appreciate the duties that will be mine, and I am prepared for all sacrifices in the cause of my duty.... My noble people, I am proud of you and your loyalty and am confident in the future as I am in God. Let us work together. We shall succeed and be happy. Long live the Motherland!\n\n”\n\nFarouk was enamored of the glamorous royal lifestyle. Although he already had thousands of acres of land, dozens of palaces and hundreds of cars, the youthful king often travelled to Europe for grand shopping sprees, earning the ire of many of his subjects. It is said that he ate 600 oysters a week.[11] His personal vehicle was a red 1947 Bentley Mark VI, with coachwork by Figoni et Falaschi; he dictated that, other than the military jeeps which made up the rest of his entourage, no other cars were to be painted red.[12] In 1951, he bought the pear-shaped 94-carat Star of the East Diamond and a fancy-coloured oval-cut diamond from jeweler Harry Winston.\n\nA banquet organized on the occasion of the wedding of King Farouk I and Queen Farida of Egypt. The persons appearing in the photograph are (from left to right):\n\nPrincess Nimet Mouhtar (1876–1945), Farouk's paternal aunt;\n\nKing Farouk I (1920–1965), the groom;\n\nQueen Farida (1921–1988), the bride;\n\nSultana Melek (1869–1956), widow ofHussein Kamel, Farouk's paternal uncle;\n\nPrince Muhammad Ali Ibrahim (1900–1977), Farouk's 2nd cousin once removed.\n\nHe was most popular in his early years and the nobility largely celebrated him. For example, during the accession of the young King Farouk, \"the Abaza family had solicited palace authorities to permit the royal train to stop briefly in their village so that the king could partake of refreshments offered in a large, magnificently ornamented tent the family had erected in the train station.\"[13] The ironies of history also meant that the Abaza family's own Wagih Abaza was in the Free Officers movement that removed the King in 1952, later becoming governor of sixgovernorates in post-Farouk Egypt.[14][15][16]\n\nFarouk's accession initially was encouraging for the populace and nobility, due to his youth and Egyptian roots through his mother Nazli Sabri. However, the situation was not the same with some Egyptian politicians and elected government officials, with whom Farouk quarreled frequently, despite their loyalty in principle to his throne.\n\nDuring the hardships of the Second World War, criticism was levelled at Farouk for his lavish lifestyle. His decision not to put out the lights at his palace in Alexandriawhen the city was blacked out because of German and Italian bombing was deemed particularly offensive by the Egyptian people. Owing to the continuing British occupation of Egypt, many Egyptians, Farouk included, were positively disposed towards Germany and Italy, and despite the presence of British troops, Egypt remained officially neutral until the final year of the war. Consequently, Farouk's Italian servants were not interned, and there is an unconfirmed story that Farouk told British Ambassador Sir Miles Lampson (who had an Italian wife), \"I'll get rid of my Italians when you get rid of yours\".[_citation needed_] In addition, Farouk was known for harbouring certain Axis sympathies and even sending a note toAdolf Hitler saying that an invasion would be welcome.[17]\n\nFollowing a ministerial crisis in February 1942, the British government, through its ambassador in Egypt, Sir Miles Lampson, pressed Farouk to have a Wafd or Wafd-coalition government replace Hussein Sirri Pasha's government. On the night of 4 February 1942, British troops and tanks surrounded Abdeen Palace in Cairo and Lampson presented Farouk with an ultimatum. Farouk capitulated, and Nahhas formed a government shortly thereafter. However, the humiliation meted out to Farouk, and the actions of the Wafd in cooperating with the British and taking power, lost support for both the British and the Wafd among both civilians and, more importantly, the military.\n\nFarouk declared war on the Axis Powers only under heavy British pressure in 1945, long after the fighting in Egypt's Western Desert had ceased.\n\nOn 17 October 1951 the Egyptian government got Parliamentary approval to cancel the 1936 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty. As a result, the British forces in the Suez Canal were considered occupation forces and king Farouk was declared \"King of Egypt and Sudan\". This title was not recognised by many countries, and Egypt entered diplomatic debates as well as internal political unrest.\n\nFarouk is also reported as having said \"The whole world is in revolt. Soon there will be only five Kings left — the King of England, the King of Spades, the King of Clubs, the King of Hearts, and the King of Diamonds.\"[18]\n\nOverthrow[Edit]\n\nFarouk was widely condemned for his corrupt and ineffectual governance, the continued British occupation, and the Egyptian army's failure in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War to prevent the creation of the state of Israel. Public discontent against Farouk rose to new levels.[_citation needed_] Finally, on 23 July 1952, the Free Officers, led by Muhammad Naguib and Gamal Abdel Nasser, staged a military coup that launched the Egyptian Revolution of 1952. Farouk was forced to abdicate, and went into exile in Monaco and Italy where he lived for the rest of his life.[_citation needed_] Immediately following his abdication, Farouk's baby son, Ahmed Fuad, was proclaimed King Fuad II, but for all intents and purposes Egypt was now governed by Naguib, Nasser and the Free Officers.[_citation needed_] On 18 June 1953, the revolutionary government formally abolished the monarchy, ending 150 years of the Muhammad Ali dynasty's rule, and Egypt was declared a republic.\n\n_\n\nKing Farouk Seven-Piece EmpireBedroom Suite crafted by the Parisianébéniste_, Antoine Krieger\n\nThe Egyptian government quickly moved to auction off the King's vast collection of trinkets and treasures,[19] including his seven-piece bedroom suite that was inspired by Napoleon and Josephine's suite at the Château de Malmaison.[20]Among the more famous of his possessions was one of the rare 1933 Double Eagle coins, though the coin disappeared before it could be returned to the United States. (It later reappeared in New York in 1996 and was eventually sold at auction for more than seven million dollars.)[21]\n\nThe 94-carat Star of the East diamond and another diamond bought from Harry Winston had not been paid for by the time of the King's overthrow in 1952; three years later an Egyptian government legal board entrusted with the disposal of the former royal assets, ruled in Winston's favour. Nevertheless, several years of litigation were needed before Winston was able to reclaim the Star of the East from a safe-deposit box in Switzerland.\n\nExile and Death[Edit]\n\nFarouk I with his wife Narriman and their son Fuad II in exile in Capri, Italy(1953)\n\nFarouk fled Egypt in great haste, and his abandoned possessions—including a huge collection of pornography—became objects of curiosity and ridicule.[22]\n\nOn his exile from Egypt, Farouk settled first in Monaco, and later in Rome, Italy. On 29 April 1958, the United Arab Republic, a federation of Egypt and Syria, issued rulings revoking his citizenship.[23] He was granted Monegasque citizenship in 1959 by his close friend Prince Rainier III.[24]\n\nFarouk was thin early in his reign but later gained weight, reaching nearly 136 kg (300 pounds)—an acquaintance described him as \"a stomach with a head\". He died in the Ile de France restaurant in Rome on 18 March 1965, collapsing at his dinner table following a characteristically heavy meal.[25] While some claim he was poisoned by Egyptian Intelligence,[26] no official autopsy was conducted on his body. His will stipulated that he be buried in the Al Rifa'i Mosque in Cairo, but the request was denied by the Egyptian government under Gamal Abdel Nasser, and he was buried in Italy. The funeral service held in Rome was attended by his mother, Nazli Sabri.[27] King Faisal of Saudi Arabia stated he would be willing to have King Farouk buried in Saudi Arabia, upon which President Nasser said that the former monarch could be buried in Egypt, but not in Rifai' mosque. The body of King Farouk returned to Egypt on 31 March 1965 at night and was secretly buried in the Ibrahim Pasha Burial Site in Imam El Shafi' area.[28]\n\nKing Farouk I Tomb in Refaii mosque, Cairo, Egypt\n\nDuring Anwar El-Sadat's presidency, the remains were moved to Al-Rifa'i Mosque.[_citation needed_]\n\nMarriages and Affairs[Edit]\n\nFarouk I with his wife Queen Faridaand their first-born daughter Farial (c. 1939)\n\nFarouk was married twice, with a claim of a third marriage. His first wife was Safinaz Zulficar (1921–1988), the daughter of Youssef Zulficar Pasha. Safinaz was renamed Farida upon her marriage. They were married in January 1938,[29] and divorced in 1948, producing three daughters.\n\nFarouk's second wife was a commoner, Narriman Sadek (1933-2005). They were married in 1951, and divorced in 1954, having only one child, the future King Fuad II.\n\nHe also had many affairs, including one with British writer Barbara Skelton. While in exile in Italy, Farouk met Irma Capece Minutolo, an opera singer, who became his companion. In 2005, she claimed that she married the former King in 1957.[30]\n\nChildren[Edit]\n\nName\n\nBirth\n\nDeath\n\nSpouse\n\nChildren\n\nPrincess Farial\n\n17 November 1938\n\n29 November 2009\n\nJean-Pierre Perreten\n\nDivorced 1967 Yasmine Perreten-Shaarawi (b. 1967)\n\nPrincess Fawzia\n\n7 April 1940\n\n27 January 2005\n\nPrincess Fadia\n\n15 December 1943\n\n28 December 2002\n\nPierre Alexievitch Orloff\n\nMichael-Shamel Orloff (b. 1966)\n\nAlexander-Ali Orloff (b. 1969)\n\nKing Fuad II\n\n16 January 1952\n\nDominique-France Loeb-Picard\n\nDivorced 1996Muhammad Ali, Prince of the Sa'id (b. 1979)\n\nPrincess Fawzia-Latifa (b. 1982)\n\nPrince Fakhruddin (b. 1987)\n\nHobbies[Edit]\n\nCoin Collection[Edit]\n\nKing Farouk amassed one of the most famous coin collections in history which included an extremely rare American Gold Minted 1933 Double Eagle coin[31] and (non concurrently), two 1913 Liberty Head nickels.[32]\n\nStyle[Edit]\n\nThe ostentatious king's name is used to describe imitation Louis XV-style furniture known as \"Louis-Farouk\".[33] The imperial French style furniture became fashionable among Egypt's upper classes during Farouk's reign so Egyptian artisans began to mass-produce it. The style uses ornate carving, is heavily gilded, and is covered in elaborate cloth.[34]The style, or imitations thereof, remains widespread in Egypt.\n\nTitles, Styles and Honours[Edit]\n\nStyles of\n\nFarouk I of Egypt\n\n_\n\nReference Style\n\nHis Majesty\n\nSpoken Style\n\nYour Majesty\n\nAlternative Style\n\nSir\n\nTitles[Edit]\n\n* 11 FEBRUARY 1920 – 15 MARCH 1922: His Sultanic Highness_ Prince Farouk of Egypt\n\n* 15 MARCH 1922 – 12 DECEMBER 1933: _His Royal Highness_ the Crown Prince of Egypt\n\n* 12 DECEMBER 1933 – 28 APRIL 1936: _His Royal Highness_ the Prince of the Sa'id\n\n* 28 APRIL 1936 – 16 OCTOBER 1951: _His Majesty_ the King of Egypt, Sovereign of Nubia, Sudan, Kordofan, and Darfur\n\n* 16 OCTOBER 1951 – 26 JULY 1952: _His Majesty_ the King of Egypt and the Sudan\n\n* 26 JULY 1952 – 18 MARCH 1965: _His Majesty_ the King Farouk of Egypt\n\n* France: Grand Cross of the Order of the Legion of Honour[38][39][40]\n\n* Iran: Knight Grand Cordon with Collar of the Order of Pahlavi[41]\n\n* Monaco: Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Saint-Charles[39][42]\n\n* Spanish Royal Family: Knight Grand Cross with Collar of the Royal Order of Isabella the Catholic[39][43]\n\nSeller Information\n\nSeller\n\nsellinghisstamps (499)\n\nRegistered Since\n\n11/30/2016\n\nFeedback\n\n100%\n\nStore\n\nSelling His Stamps\n\nItem Location\n\nCalifornia, United States\n\nShips To\n\nUnited States\n\nPostage Calculator\n\nSelect Country\n\nQuantity\n\nReturns Accepted\n\nNo"
