        "text": "Metis 1700 - 1707\n\nMetis\n\n1700 - 1707\n\nJESUITS DECLARE HOLY WAR\n\nThirty three Indian Nations descend on Montreal.\n\nThey came to request that the French not involve them in their\n\nsquabbles with the English.\n\nThe French begin their 40 year war of genocide against the Fox Indians.\n\nThe Metis are reported to be swarming throughout the West.\n\nThe French establish a Policy of Non-Exploration into the\n\nIndian Territories for the next 10 years.\n\nThe Metis and Coureurs des Bois, however, continue to\n\nconduct expeditions into the North and South West.\n\nThey are in the process of nation building.\n\n1700\n\nWhen we read the birth, marriage and death records for the next 50 years, as recorded by the Jesuits, we note that most considered unions between the French and French Metis with savage pagans (un-baptized women) are usually ignored and the children are considered as bastards. Many Jesuit would not even marry or baptize the children of such unions. They often referred to the savages, country wives as slaves. The Jesuits did not consider that a marriage between two people and God as celebrated by the community as a valid union. They however would except a baptism by a non-priest especially if the parties involved were influential.\n\nTypical Metis and Coureurs des Bois (runners of the woods) clothing in the early 1700's. They also smeared their faces with grease and paint, like the Indians, as a protection against mosquitoes and black flies. Some estimates put the engages (Voyagers) as 400 to 500 each year and the Coureurs des Bois as 2,500 to 3,000 to say nothing of those Metis in the field.\n\nThe Ojibwa are reported to be trading to the Hudson Bay at this time.\n\nLouis Thomas Joncaire de Chabert (1670-1740) is with Father Bruyas and Sieur de Maricourt at Fort Ononage.\n\nIllinois, Mississippi voyage (II)-Louis Michel Duhemme dit Terrin born 1671 son (I)-Jean Duhemme: Hueri of Flevre, source (see Relation of the voyage of the R.P. Jacques Gravel S.J. in 1700, country of Illinois of the Mississippi, edition shea, 1859 P.11). He had one recorded son (III)-Francois Duhemme who married Marie Charlotte Guignard, a.ka. Dinhargue a Basque.\n\nPierre Charles Le Sueur (1672-1704) of La Pointe, Ojibwa Country (Madeleine Island, Wisconsin) reported copper mines in the Upper Mississippi.\n\nPierre Sidrac Dugue dit Laf, sieur de Boisbriant (Boisbriand) (1675-1740), was at Fort Biloxi, Louisiana, across the bay from the present-day city of Biloxi (Harrison), Mississippi, with his cousins, the Le Moyne brothers, as part of the French plan to secure the mouth of the Mississippi River for France. This was to establish the end link of forts, stretching back to New France, to cut off further English and Spanish expansion to the Mississippi..\n\nDuring the period 1700 to 1716, the Fox (Ojibwa) became the only Algonquian speaking Natives to war against the French, being provoked by the Jesuit; many said. Jean Baptiste Le Moyne sieur of Bienville (1680-1768) explored the Red River of the North, this year. This is probably the Red River of the Dakotas, but could also include the River of the North into Manitoba.\n\nFort Michipicoten, Ojibwa Country, on Michipicoten Bay, Lake Superior is believed built about this time. Fort L'Huiltier is establishing about this time at the confluence of the Minnesota and Green Rivers called the St. Peter's and Verte Rivers at this time. It is destroyed by 1739 and rebuilt, being named Fort Verde.\n\nFather (I)-Jacques Gravier (1651-1708), a Jesuit on the Mississipi, with the Illinois, encountered the sick Louis Du Hemme, of Riviere Du Loop and Augustin from Point of Coste de St. Michel in Canada. Pierre Chabot of the Island of Orleans is also sick.\n\nFort Pimitoui is closed as a result of the French closure of the fur trade.\n\nFort Saint Jean, Acadia is built this year.\n\nJanuary: Fort Mississippi, Louisiana is built 40 miles (64 km) upstream.\n\nJean Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville (1680-1767) explored the Red River.\n\nApril: Jean Penicaut, a boat builder on the Minnesota River at the mouth of the Blue Earth at the new Fort L'Huillier near Mankato, Minnesota, encountered 7 traders (Coureurs des Bois or Metis) who wintered near the Fort this season. The Jean Penicaut party included d'Iberville and nineteen men. Louis Junchereau, dit St. Denis/Denys (1674-1744), is at the mouth of the Mississippi River with d'Iberville. (d'Iberville is likely Pierre Le Moyne (1661-1706).)\n\nThe French built Fort St. Croix on the St. Croix River, Wisconsin (western Lake Superior 75 miles SW La Pointe) is 40 leagues from the mouth of the river and is abandoned by 1755. The Metis build Fort Portage De L'Isle on Winnipeg River, just below Terre Blanche Portage. Fort Michipicoten is built on Michipicoten Bay, Lake Superior. Fort Mattagami on Lake Mattagami, (Ontario) is built as an outpost of Fort St. Germain.\n\nThe Ojibwa term muskig was adopted by the Metis as muskeg and crept into common usage to describe a unique type of terrain.\n\nOjibwa tradition suggests that the Yankton Dakota, at this time, occupied much of the prairies near the Red River of the North. North of the Yankton lived the Kenisteno and the Assineboins. The Ojibwa are also known to be among these peoples.\n\nRimouski St. Octave de Metis Mission is established this year.\n\nPierre Du Roy (LeRoy) (1676-1743) is claimed to be the first settler in or near Fort Detroit, New France (Michigan), 1st married 1703 at Fort Detroit, New France (Michigan) to Marguerite Ouabankikoue (Ouankikove/Ouabankiknove), Miami, died October 31, 1732, others suggest she had 6 children which questions the second marriage, 2nd marriage in 1705 at Laprairie to Marie Angelique Faye Lafaillette. It is noteworthy that the Detroit area was the location of a Metis Settlement long before the French established their Fort and was likely preceded by an Indian settlement.\n\nAugust 13: Quebec, Quebec, birth, (III)-Louis Durand, Metis, son (II)- Louis Durand, Metis, b-1670 and Elisabeth Agnes Michel dit Taillon (1682-1718); married January 22, 1725, Sorel, Marie Anne Dumay.\n\nAugust 22: St. Augustin, Quebec, birth, (III)-Laurent Dubeau, Metis, son (II)-Laurent Dubeau, Metis, (1672- 1731) and (II)- Francoise Paule Campagna (1683-1717).\n\nSeptember: Pierre Charles Le Sueur (1672-1704) and 24 French arrived from the mouth of the Mississippi at Nicolas Perrot's Island Post of Isle Pelee, above Lake Bon Secours or Lake Pepin. They wintered here, trafficking in furs and other merchandise. They traded with the Cioux, Mententons, Mencouacantons, Ouytespouy, and some other Cioux of the soil.\n\n1701\n\nFort Detroit, New France (Michigan) or vicinity, birth, (II)-Alexis Bienvenue, died Detroit, New France (Michigan) October 13, 1763 son (I)-Francois Bienvenue aka Delisle or DeLisle, born 1663, died September 29, 1751, is believed by some to frequent Fort Detroit before 1700. His wives include Genevieve Laferiere, and 2ndmarriage 1708, Marianne Lemoine: Alexis married January 17, 1740 (III)-Elisabeth (Josette) Bouron who died May 30, 1758 Fort Detroit, New France (Michigan) daughter (II)-Joseph Bouron.\n\nPierre Francois Xavier de Charlevoix (1682-1761) contends that the Outagamis became fierce savages about this time because of ill treatment by the French for the next twenty years, and formed an alliance with the Iroquois as enemies to the French and with the Dakota; a numerous Nation. This second alliance has rendered all navigation of the upper Mississippi almost impracticable.\n\nFort Detroit, New France (Michigan), marriage, Edmond Roy dit Chatellereau de Ste Anne b-1665/75 son Michel Roy Chatellerault and Francoise Hobbe Aube; married, Marie Anne Janvier daughter of Jean Janvier and Dorthie Dubois. Possible marriage Ste Anne De le Perade, Champlain, Quebec but Edmond was in Fort Detroit, New France (Michigan) 1701 being hired by Jean Bochart along with Michel Roy de Ste Anne and Pierre Roy de Ste Anne. To add to the confusion their son Michel Roy (1701-1761) married 1728 Marie Angelique Perot Perrault\n\nFort Detroit, New France (Michigan) or vicinity death Jean Fafard leaving his widow Marguerite Couc who married 1705 Fort Detroit, New France (Michigan), Michel Masse.\n\nFort Detroit, New France (Michigan) or vicinity birth Alexis Bienvenu dit Delisle son Francois Bienvenu dit Delisle\n\nFort Detroit, New France (Michigan), birth 1701 to 1703 Theresa Tonti is assumed to be the first recorded child born at Fort Detroit, daughter Alphonse Tonti, Baron of Paludy (1659-1727) and Mary Ann Picote de Belestre born February 9, 1673 Montreal died September 11, 1714 Montreal daughter Peter Picote de Belestre and Mary Pars.\n\nThe Green Bay, New France (Michigan), Region is reported swarming with Coureurs des Bois (Metis), going unchecked by the French as they are banned from trading Lake Superior because of the Jesuits. The Peoria People blamed the Jesuits for the drop in fur value and killed Father Jacques Gravier, Jesuit.\n\nOnly twenty five Wendat remained at Michilimackinac, New France (Michigan), and (I)-Antoine Laumet de La Mothe sieur de Cadillac (1658-1730) wrote that he hoped the obstinate resident priest, Father (I)-Etienne Carheil (1633-1726), a Jesuits, will die in his Parish without one parishioner to bury him. He said, of the Jesuit conduct, that it smelled of seduction a hundred yards off. The Jesuits are not allowed to establish a mission at Fort Detroit, New France (Michigan). Father Constantin De L'Halle, killed 1723, a Recollect, is invited and he built the first church on July 26 and called it Ste. Anne. The Jesuit would conspire towards Cadillac's demise and this subversion would be long remembered by the native peoples.\n\n(I)-Antoine Laumet de La Mothe sieur de Cadillac (1658-1730) claimed that no one had ever visited this part of the country, Fort Detroit, before himself. This was an absurd statement to make as he was fully aware the Metis and Coureurs des Bois had been everywhere before him. There is also reason to believe some were living among the Indians who had villages near this place. He likely made this statement so that the Jesuits could not lay claim to having made a mission with the Indians in this area and therefore had a right to attend to Fort Detroit. It is noteworthy that this was historically the lands of the Fox (Ojibwa) Indians.\n\nMadame (III)-Marie Therese Guyon Cadillac, born April 9, 1671, joined her husband on September 10 with five of their thirteen children at Fort Detroit, New France (Michigan). Guyon had married (I)-Antoine Laumet de La Mothe sieur de Cadillac (1658-1730) June 25, 1687 Quebec. (II)-Antoine Laumet, and (II)-Jacques Laumet were two of the older sons. The intent of Fort Detroit, New France (Michigan) at this time, by King Louis XIV (1643­1715), is to get rid of the Coureurs des Bois (Metis) or to curb their activities. The King had to admit that all attempts to date had failed and their numbers continued to grow. A number of canoes of the Alphonse Tonty (1659-1727) party had defected to the Coureurs des Bois; so strong are the pull of freedom and free trade. One hundred and fifty disgruntled merchant investors in Mackinaw, New France (Michigan), protested their loss of business and are offered shares in the Compagnie de la Colonie du Canada.\n\nSome thirteen hundred delegates representing 33 different Nations from all tribes, from the Atlantic to Lake Winnipeg (Lake Bourbon) and beyond the Mississippi, met in Montreal, Quebec, to enter into a peace treaty, to remain neutral in any future conflict between the English and French. The French are just beginning to appreciate the vast country and how immense it really is.\n\nThe British and French war of 1701-1713 appears to have had little impact on the Western interior. The French retain control of the Bay of the North, and Fort Albany, James Bay (Ontario) remains in the hands of the English. The Hudson Bay Company is effectively insolvent, with no significant activity and no dividends are recorded from 1691 to 1717. Charles Junchereau de Saint Denys (1665-1703) is granted the rights to establish tanneries at Michilimackinac, Mississippi Valley and Cairo, Illinois.\n\nThe Hudson Bay Company reported that the French Canadians discontinued official expedition into the Country of the Cree and Assiniboine. This new French policy encouraged the Metis to gain control of the Louisiana Territory. The evolution of New France maps suggests that the Metis continued to explore the North West over the next ten years despite the French policy of non exploration.\n\nThe colony of Louisiana consisted of 180 men capable of bearing arms, 2 French families with 3 girls and 7 boys, and 6 Indian boy slaves. Most are around Fort Louis de la Louisiane at Mobile, Louisiana, Alabama. It is noteworthy that the Indian wives and slaves are not included in the count. It is also noteworthy that, at this time, marriages with Indian women were not allowed, and Metis offspring were not recognized by the church.\n\nThe missionaries abandoned the Cahokia Indian and Metis Village in upper Louisiana (Illinois) and moved to Kaskaskia (Illinois), both on the Mississippi River.\n\nFebruary 11: Levis, baptism Guillaume Marchand born 1693 (slave) esclave panis, achete par (II)-Louis Marchand (1693-1749).\n\nMay: Pierre Charles Le Sueur (1672-1704) left Fort Mahkahto under the command of D'Evaque, a Canadian (Metis), and twelve Frenchmen and returned to Fort Mobile (Mobile, Alabama) with 24 Frenchmen.\n\nApril 13: (II)-Jean Francois DuBois alias Brisebois (b-1668) is recorded as a voyager to the west.\n\nApril 17: Kaskakia, Illinois, birth (III)-Pierre Baillargeon dit Durivage, Metis, son (II)-Antoine Baillargeon dit Durivage and 1st Marie Aco or 2nd Domitilde Ch8ping8a.\n\nMay 25: Louis Chouet, a.k.a. Lagiroflee, soldier in company of Cabana captain, son Jean Chouet and Marie Magdeleine Magdile, departed for Fort Detroit, New France (Michigan), but gave his property to Mary Magdeleine Delisle in the event of his death.\n\nMay 27: (III)-Rene Godefroy (Godfroy) (1675-1748), Monsieur de Linctot, (II)-Louis Gateau, alias Gastineau dit Duplessis, Sieur de Ste Anne (1674-1750) and (II)-Jean Baptiste Giguere (ancient voyager, out of Montreal, Quebec) (1660-1750) are listed as voyager's West, and his brother (II)-Jean Giguere (1663-1711) is also listed but no specific year and date of travel is given.\n\nMay 27: Mathurin Rivard Feuilleverte engage west, source Lyle Trottier.\n\nMay 27: (II)-Jean Lemire (1676-1754) is listed a voyager West.\n\nMay 29: Louis Badeillac, a.k.a. Laplante, arrived Fort Detroit, New France (Michigan) in the first convoy.\n\nJune 1/5: (I)-Alphonse Tonty (1650/1659-1727) Captain of the Company, the brother of (I)-Henri de Tonty (1649/50-1704), the Italian, second in command Fort Pontchartrain du Detroit, New France (Michigan) with (I)-Antoine Laumet de La Mothe sieur de Cadillac (1658-1730), Jesuit Father Vaillant, Recollet Father Constantine, Dugue, Chacornacle and 100 Men (50% soldiers) with twenty five canoe went to build Fort Pontchartrain du Detroit, New France (Michigan) traveling via Fort Michilimackinac. This long out of the way route is alleged to be taken to retrieve a Cadillac cache of 198 pots of brandy which are hidden in the woods near the Post and to pick up a cannon, muskets and munitions. These had been seized from unauthorized Coureurs des Bois (Metis) and really belonged to Montreal merchants. (I)-Antoine Laumet de La Mothe sieur de Cadillac (1658-1730), under command of (I)-Alphonse Tonty (1659-1727) - the brother of (I)-Henri de Tonty (1649-1704), the Italian, established Post Pontchartrain d'etroit, drawing many of the personnel from the Jesuit mission of Father (I)-Etienne Carheil (1633-1726), the Jesuit of Michilimackinac. He used 100 Algonquian, 50 Frenchmen and 50 soldiers to build the Fort. He named this Fort, Pontchartrain d'Etroit (also known as Fort Ticksarondis). He reported that about six thousand Indians are camped about the Fort. (I)-Antoine Laumet de Lamothe Cadillac (1658-1730) would later claim that he invited the Indians to Fort Detroit, New France (Michigan) and most authorities in France are well aware that he makes less than honest claims. He would also claim that they were the first ones in this region, and that his wife, (III)-Marie Therese Guyon born 1671, and Tonty's wife were the first white women in this region. This was also a bold unsupported claim.\n\nJune 4: Charles Juchereau de Saint-Denys (1655-1703) is granted the rights to establish tanneries in the Mississippi Valley, at Michilimackinac, New France (Michigan), and at Cairo, Illinois Country.\n\nJune 28: Jean Baptiste Gigulere died April 18, 1750 departed Montreal, Quebec, for Fort Detroit, New France (Michigan) having made a present of his propertyin event of his death to Louise Maignan whom he married on January 22, 1704, in Montreal, Quebec upon his return. His brother, Robert Gigulere, born January 28, 1663 and died December 10, 1711 Montreal, Quebec is also at Fort Detroit, New France (Michigan).\n\nJune 28: Engage west (III)-Francois Marie Trottier-Bellecour (1679-1744) son (II)-Antoine Trottier-Dusruisseaux (1640-1706) and Catherine Lefebvre (1648-1705), source L. Trottier\n\nJune 28: (II)-Mathieu Perrin, also Garao, alias Garaut, Gavahau and Perrin de Louarget (1664-1742,) born Bout de I'lle, Montreal, Quebec and departed Montreal, Quebec as engage (Voyager) to the West. (II)-Mathieu Garno is the father of (III)-Oliver Garno (born 1706), alias Garneau and, Perrin de Louarget.\n\nJuly 10: Jean Francois Volant sieur de Fosseneuve born 1670 went to Fort Detroit, New France (Michigan), as a hunter and married June 6, 1701, Marguerite Godfroy.\n\nJuly 24: (I)-Antoine Laumet de Lamothe Cadillac (1658-1730) arrived at Fort Detroit, New France (Michigan). He selected this location hoping to prevent the Indians, Metis and Coureurs des Bois from trading with the English.\n\nSeptember 5: Robert Reaume, brother Charles Reaume, (III)-Joseph Trotier dit Desruisseaux (1668-1709 or 16) and Toussaint Pothier dit Laverdure are engaged to escort Francis Mary Picote de Belestre and equipages, Mrs De Lamothe Cadaillac, Mrs Alphonse Tonti and their children from Montreal, Quebec, to Fort Detroit, New France (Michigan).\n\nSeptember 6: Pierre Cardinal (1665-1719) arrived in Fort Detroit, New France (Michigan) son Simon Jacques Cardinal (Cardinault) and Michelle Garnier (Grenier).\n\nSeptember 31: Mathurin Rivard Feuilleverte engage west, source Lyle Trottier.\n\nOctober 7: Fort Detroit planted its first French wheat.\n\nOctober 24: Montreal, Quebec, marriage, Jean Deslanders and (II)-Madeleine Galarneay, Metis, died July 16, 1716, Montreal, Quebec, daughter (I)-Jacques Galarneau born 1642 and Jacqueline Heron born 1645 epouse May 9, 1706, Montreal Jean Picard; Madeleine 1st. married August 8, 1691, Quebec, Quebec, Joseph Langevin, 2nd marriage October 24, 1701 Montreal, Quebec; Jean Deslandes, 3rd marriage November 3, 1715, Montreal, Quebec, Jean Baptiste Joly.\n\nOctober 31: Quebec, marriage, Jean Metivier to (II)-Genevieve Couturier, Metis, died March 24, 1715, Quebec, daughter (I)-Jacques Couturier b-1646, and Catherine Annennontank, Huronne, b-1649.\n\n1702\n\n(I)-Francois de Beauharnois de La Chaussaye, Baron de Beauville (1665-1746, is appointed Intendant New France (1702-1705)\n\nKaskaskia, Illinois, marriage Jean Gauthier to Marie Suzanne Capciouekoue, Indian.\n\nPierre Le Moyne d' Iberville et d'Ardillieres (1661-1706) departs the Louisiana Territories, never to return, and is assumed to have died or was killed..\n\nMobile, Louisiana, birth Claude Jousset, Creole Metis son of a Canadian and unknown woman.\n\nCharles Junchereau d-1704, son Nicolas Junchereau established a trading post at the mouth of the Ohio River near future Fort Massac.\n\nA considerable number of French Metis had settled at Cahokia in the Mississippi Valley. This was an established place long before Kaskaskia. Most of the inhabitants of the French fort at Kaskaskia took Indian wives to form the nucleus of the Village of Kaskaskia, Illinois.\n\nPierre Cardinal (1665-1719) and Francois Dauphin/Daupin, sieur de Laforest (1649-1714) are with Charles Junchereau de St. Denis on his venture on the Mississippi. They were accused of trading illegally on the Mississippi by Boishebert. The concession at Fort St. Louis was revoked, and Francois Dauphin/Daupin, sieur de Laforest (1649-1714) was recalled to New France but continued to trade illegally with Pierre LeSueur (1672-1704). The claim apparently did not stick, as he replaced (I)-Antoine Laumet de Lamothe Cadillac (1658-1730) at Fort Detroit, New France (Michigan), in 1710.\n\nEurope is again at war. The Sac and Fox attack Fort Mahkahto (Ouabache) at Blue Earth River (Minnesota), killing three of his 16 men. D'Evaque Pierre Charles LeSueur (1672-1704) is forced to abandon the Post and returned to Louisiana. They encountered Charles Juchereau, sieur de St. Denis/Denys de Beaumarchis (1655-1703), son Nicolas Junchereau de St. Denis de Beauport and Marie Therese Giffard, with a concession in the Ohio Valley to establish a fort at the mouth of the Ohio River (Ouabache (Cairo, Illinois)). His thirty five men party were in eight canoes. Members of his party included: Charles Denu Detaillis, Nicolas Laberge, Paul Teyssier, Francois Legardeur de Mutrecy, Nicolas Le Moyne sieur de Leau, Alexis Legay, Gabriel Philippe sieur de Manteville, Pierre Cardinal, Paul Groust, Reverand Jean Mermet and Francois Marie Bouet. Juchereau had plans to establish a tannery at the mouth of the Ohio to process buffalo skins. This business venture ended in tragedy, as most contracted and died from malaria. Sieur de St. Lambert takes command of this Post in 1703, upon the death of Juchereau. The Indians on the Fox-Wisconsin waterway demanded and received tribute for the use of their trade route. Some suggest Juchereau was responsible for Michilimackinac, Green Bay, Wisconsin River and the Mississippi River.\n\nFort L'Huillier is operating this year with 12 men near Blue Earth on the Minnesota River, but the site is believed abandoned later this same year.\n\nOnanguisse, a Potawatomi Chief, threatened to trade with the English speaking people unless the French established better trade. The establishment of Saint Michael's Mission in the south west corner of Lake Superior, Ojibwa Country, occurred this year. The French complained this year that the Metis (Coureurs des Bois) are also swarming throughout the Western Country.\n\nFort Louis at Mobile, Louisiana- a supply ship, arrived with 23 women for marriage, along with 75 soldiers, of which 30 died shortly after their arrival.\n\nThe frontier villages were mostly made from stakes, driven into the ground as closely as possible and the spaces filled with mud or mortar. The roof was made of tree bark or split rails. Sawing lumber or log cabins at this time was too labor intensive.\n\nThe Jesuit (I)-Sebastian Rale (Rasles), (1657-1724), a Jesuit, a rigid and unbending man, and a missionary of the Abenaki, wrote that the Abenaki are ready to lift the hatchet against the English speaking peoples. He would die, not a martyr, but as a soldier. Another Jesuit of the time wrote that the priests abhorred the sending down of the heathen to commit outrages against the English speaking peoples, saying it is more like committing murders than managing a war. Mostly women and children are being targeted and killed. A ten year, Jesuit inspired war against the English and Coureurs des Bois (Metis) would commence. The Jesuit war is really a war of French Roman Catholic vs. American Protestant, as America is peopled with all nationalities of Europe including thousands of French Protestants.\n\nFort Detroit, New France had constructed a picket line palisade enclosing 1 arpent of land, about 800 feet in length, rising 12 to 15 feet to defend against the Indians. There were no women in the fort at this time.\n\nMadam Cadillac and Tonty's wife arrived in the spring of 1702.\n\nFort Detroit, New France (Michigan) planted Indian corn that grew to 8 feet tall, and each soldier (50 men) were required to plant 1/2 acre garden for their own use and the citizens planted 60 arpents of wheat. Wild grapes, fruit, berries and nuts were also harvested.\n\nMarch: Fort Detroit, New France (Michigan), and vicinity is estimated to contain 6,000 people, mostly natives.\n\nMay 13: (IV)-Francois LeGardeur (b-1675), sieur de Mutrecy Repentigny listed a Voyager to the Mississippi.\n\nMay 18: (II)-Jean Francois DuBois alias Brisebois (b-1668) is recorded as a voyager West.\n\nJune 16: Engage west (III)-Francois Marie Trottier-Bellecour (1679-1744) son (II)-Antoine Trottier-Dusruisseaux (1640-1706) and Catherine Lefebvre (1648-1705), source L. Trottier\n\nJune 26: Quebec, Quebec, birth, (III)-Marie Louise Dubeau, Metis, son (II)-Laurent Dubeau, Metis, (1672- 1731) and (II)- Francoise Paule Campagna (1683-1717).\n\nJuly 5: (I)-Father Francois Pinet (1661-1704) departed Tamarous or Arkinsa for Cascaskias (Kaskaskia, Illinois). It is noted that many Frenchmen are at Kaskaskia, Illinois and some have married to Indian women.\n\nJuly 12: Paul Chevalier and wife Campau arrived in Fort Detroit, New France (Michigan).\n\nJuly 16: (II)-Louis Gateau, alias Gastineau dit Duplessis, Sieur de Ste Anne (1674-1750), is recorded as a voyager West. Also (II)-Jean Baptiste Gatineau, alias Gastineau dit Duplessis (b-1671), is listed as a voyager West. Also listed is (II)-Pierre Gouin (1679-1761) Voyager West.\n\nJuly 16: Charles Daze arrived in Fort Detroit, New France (Michigan).\n\nJuly 18: Fort Detroit, New France (Michigan), Arnauld Bertrand, merchant arrived Fort Detroit, New France (Michigan).\n\nAugust 30: Father (I)-Etienne de Carheil (1633-1726), a Jesuit of Mackinac, complained to (I)-Louis Hector de Callieres (1648-1703) Governor of New France about Michilimakina. He wrote: \"The infinite multitude of evil acts, acts of brutality and violence; of injustice and impiety; of lewd and shameless conduct; of contempt and insults. The infamous trade in brandy where they go from village to village with prodigious quantity of brandy in barrels, without any constraint.\" His complaints are not just directed at the Metis, Coureurs des Bois and Voyagers but at the soldiers and commandants of the forts and posts. He said: These places are turned into brothels.\n\nThe soldiers keep open house for all women of their acquaintance, they gamble, they scorn to observe-the feast-days. They have no intercourse with the missionaries (himself). They are hostile to the fathers (again himself). We now have no power. The Voyageurs, the only authorized traders, conspire with the Coureurs des Bois and the soldiers against the Missionaries. These fugitive Voyagers, go about seducing the women, in all the cabins where they lodge; or they go to visit them, entertain them, caress them, solicit them, and purchase the enjoyment of their bodies. These men justify the women's presents as, who would pound the corn, do the cooking, cut the wood, do the laundresses, make shoes, garters and pouches, and other articles.
