        "text": "Family life\n\nFerial’s father Farouk was a very strict parent during their exile, requiring the sisters to get permission for even trivial things such as haircuts and wearing nail polish. Her father only gave her permission to teach at a sectarian[clarification needed] school[which?] in Lausanne if she kept her identity a secret.[2]\n\nFerial lived the majority of her life before her marriage outside of Montreux, where she taught typing and French literature. Later when she married, she and her husband operated a hotel in the area.[2]\n\nIn 1966, Ferial married the Swiss Jean-Pierre Perreten, at Westminster, London. Perreten was the son of a Swiss hotelier and converted to Islam to make the marriage possible. He took on the name Samir Cheriff as part of his conversion.[2] They had one daughter, Yasmine Perreten-Shaarawi, in 1967. Ferial and Perreten divorced shortly after their daughter's birth. Ferial did not remarry. Perreten died in 1968.[2] In 2004 Yasmine married 'Ali Sha'arawi, who is the grandson of Huda Sha'arawi, an iconic Egyptian author and feminist.[2]\n\nAfter Ferial’s mother Queen Farida died in 1988, she and her two sisters were prompted to file a lawsuit against the Egyptian government over their ownership of a royal palace in the Nile Delta. The sisters believed that the land and property belonged to their mother and that with her death, they were the rightful owners of the property. However, the Egyptian court ruled against them because their parents' divorce had voided their mother's claim to the land even before all royal property was taken over during the revolution.[2]"
