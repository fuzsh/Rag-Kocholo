B)\n\nH\n\nHypatia\n\nGuest\n\nQueen Nefertiti\n\nWhat make-up can do for an old queen\n\nAugust 15, 2003\n\n\"A very strong individual indeed\" . . . the experts' reconstruction of what are believed to be the remains of Queen Nefertiti. Photo: AFP/Discovery Channel\n\nIs this Nefertiti? Two months ago a team of Egyptologists led by a British scientist, Joann Fletcher, of the University of York, announced that a neglected mummy collecting dust in a nondescript tomb was that of ancient Egypt's most famous female ruler.\n\nIn an effort to confirm her identity, two British experts have applied their forensic skills to digital X-rays of the skull.\n\nUSA Today reported on Tuesday that Damian Schofield, of the University of Nottingham, and Martin Evison of, the University of Sheffield, created a 3D computer mesh of the skull then placed a series of markers to designate where tissue would be added.\n\nNext they added facial muscles to give the face its full depth and contour. Finally a graphic artist added skin texture, eye colour, lips and the crown.\n\nNeither scientist knew in advance the identity of their \"victim\". Their speciality was the reconstruction of human faces from skulls for murder cases in which the victim is unknown.\n\nThe scientists said their reconstruction did not prove the skull belonged to Nefertiti. But they were surprised at the similarities with Nefertiti's bust, which was made during her lifetime and is displayed at the Egyptian Museum in Berlin.\n\nDr Fletcher, whose claims have been disputed by other archaeologists, said she was impressed by the final picture. \"I was bowled over by it, to be honest. The face is that of a very strong individual indeed. She has such a beautiful profile. She is stunning.\"\n\nNefertiti, which means \"the beautiful woman has come\", was one of ancient Egypt's most powerful women. Not only was she the wife of the pharaoh Akhenaten , she co-ruled with him. Her tomb was found near that of her stepson Tutankhamen, the teenager who ruled Egypt in the 14th century BC.\n\nTo see the picture reconstruction of Nefertiti see link:\n\nhttp://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/08/14/...0588526484.html\n\nLast edited by a moderator: Jan 17, 2005\n\nH\n\nHypatia\n\nGuest\n\nScientists reconstruct Mummy face believed to be Nefertiti\n\nIndiantelevision.com Team\n\n(14 August 2003 2:00 pm)\n\nBOSTON: Discovery has released the digital facial reconstruction image of the mummy believed to be Nefertiti.\n\nIt was in June that indiantelevision.com reported Discovery's announcement that Egyptologist Dr Joann Fletcher's had perhaps discovered and identified the mummy believed to be that of ancient Egypt's stunningly beautiful Queen Nefertiti.\n\nThe Queen was the Egyptian co-regent of Pharaoh Akhenaten during the late XVIIth dynasty some 3,000 years ago. Discovery funded Fletcher's expedition, which blended archaeology and state-of-the-art digital technology to locate and identify Nefertiti as part of the network's new initiative, Discovery Channel Quest. The Nefertiti special Nefertiti Resurrected will air in September around the world.\n\nAn official release informs that Discovery and London-based production company Atlantic Productions assembled a team of experts to create the facial reconstruction of the mummy. The experts used digital x-rays that were taken by the expedition team in February 2003 in royal tomb KV 35 in the Valley of the Kings.\n\nExperts included Dr. Damian Schofield, a forensic animation expert from the University of Nottingham; Dr. Martin Evison, a forensic anthropologist from Sheffield University; and a facial animator specialist from Aims Solution, Ltd. The scientists were not informed of the mummy's possible identity.\n\nThe Nottingham-Sheffield team have worked on many other forensic visualisation projects, including modelling the injuries and rebuilding the faces of murder victims. Through their joint work they have developed a number of new techniques for generating more representative facial reconstructions using advanced computer graphics technology.\n\nDr. Schofield said: \"The facial reconstruction team worked blind, with no knowledge as to who our mummy might be, throughout the project to ensure objectivity. When told who the mummy might be, we compared our reconstruction to the known images of Nefertiti and saw remarkable similarities.\"\n\nDr. Evison added: \"Facial reconstruction from the skull is too imprecise to offer unequivocal proof of identity. However the resemblance of our reconstruction to the historic portraits of Nefertiti is quite striking and would have been unavoidable.\"\n\nH\n\nHypatia\n\nGuest\n\n'Nefertiti Resurrected' on Discovery 7 September\n\nIndiantelevision.com Team\n\n(7 August 2003 3:30 pm)\n\nMUMBAI: As far as historical significance goes, this could well rival the discovery in 1922 of the tomb of the Egyptian boy-king Tutankhamen.\n\nOn Sunday, 17 August, Discovery will present a two-hour special to American viewers chronicling the expedition, including the discovery, of what is believed to be the remains of ancient Egypt's stunningly beautiful Queen Nefertiti (also Tutankhamen's stepmother). The programme will also attempt to recreate the compelling story of one of the great figures in Egyptian history.\n\nKicking off in India the next day (18 August) will be a massive multimedia campaign to promote Nefertiti Resurrected . The campaign will continue in the lead up to the show's premiere in India on Sunday, 7 September.\n\nIn the US, promos for Nefertiti Resurrected had thousands of \"missing\" posters featuring a silhouette of a bust of Nefertiti being plastered on telephone poles in 11 US markets. Print ads were run in People, Time, Entertainment Weekly, Oprah's O Magazine and Harpers Bazaar, along with heavy rotation on Lifetime. There will also be actresses dressed up as Nefertiti walking around New York, Los Angeles and Washington DC closer toward the launch date along with 'Found' posters plastered in eight markets, a Mediapost report says.\n\nSpeaking to indiantelevision.com about the channel's new initiatives, Discovery India managing director Deepak Shourie said the plan was to increase the India-specific programming on the channel. Currently, Discovery has one hour of India-centric programming that airs every Saturday with a repeat on Sunday.\n\nShourie also drew attention to Atlas HD, an ambitious series of 30 two-hour, documentary specials on countries created specifically for high definition television (reported on indiantelevision.com in February). $65 million is what Discovery has budgeted for the series over the next five years.\n\nThe first episode is on India and is scheduled to air on Discovery and its HD service in 2005. The second episode is on China.

Discovery funded Fletcher's expedition, which blended archaeology and state-of-the-art digital technology to try to find and identify Nefertiti as part of the network's new initiative, Discovery Channel Quest.\n\nThe first stage of the expedition took place a year ago. Fletcher a member of the University of York's Mummy Research Team, first visited the secret side chamber in tomb KV35 in Luxor's Valley of the Kings, the ancient royal burial ground.\n\nAn expert in mummification, specialising in the study of ancient Egyptian hair, Fletcher was drawn to the tomb by her identification of a forgotten Nubian-style wig favoured by royal women in the XVIIIth dynasty during the reign of Akhenaten, which had been found near three unidentified mummies.\n\nDiscovery and London-based Atlantic Productions filmed Fletcher as she examined the mummies, one of who bore a striking profile and swan-like neck comparable to the famed beauty Nefertiti, despite malicious post-mortem blows to her face.\n\nFletcher found physical links to the late queen including the clear impression of the tight-fitting brow-band she once wore (which identifies this individual as royalty), a double-pierced ear lobe, shaved head, and physical damage echoing the attacks on her statues and other representations. In addition, it was unusual for royal mummies not to bear identifying marks, suggesting that these mummies, although royal in status,\n\nwere intentionally deprived of ways to enter afterlife according to Egyptian belief. That would fit historical knowledge about Nefertiti's role in the Amarna period's religious revolution, later overturned by the powerful,\n\ntraditional priesthood.\n\nEarlier this year in February a multidisciplinary team of scientists -- funded by Discovery -- returned to KV35. They further studied the methods used to embalm the mummies, and while examining the mummies discovered a ripped-off right arm, bent up pharaonic style with its fingers still clutching a long-vanished royal scepter.\n\nThey also used cutting-edge Canon digital X-ray machinery to examine the mummies on the spot. The evidence, including jewelry within the smashed-in chest cavity, appeared to confirm Dr. Fletcher's original assessment of the identity of one of the two adult female mummies (the third is of a young boy)\n\nahmedtayeb\n\nNewbie\n\nJoined\n\nNov 18, 2003\n\nMessages\n\n7\n\nKing Farouk I and Queen Narriman (Second Wife) Wedding Photo\n\nKing Ahmed Fouad II, The son of King Farouk I and Queen Narriman, living in his Palace in Switizerland.

His ex-wife \"Quen Fadila\" aka Dominque Picard, was evicted from her luxurious Paris flat for not paying creditors (it was in the papers). And she's been after him for money for years (she claims that he is hiding it from her). Anyway, according her, she and her children (who are adults now) are supported by Arab and Morrocan Princes.\n\nKing Ahmed Fouad II claims he has no fortunes but I do not believe that. He usually says that to newspapers because he wants to attract the Egyptian Government attraction especially that his sisters took the government to the court beacause they demanded their mother's (Queen Farida) confiscated palace..\n\nI have read the memoirs of king farouk I, although he died in debts but he offered his children a palace in Switzerland as well as Monaco passports.\n\nQueen Nazli, lived a terrible ending with her sister becasue they were thrown out by Farouk I who deprive them from their wealth because Queen Nazli was after the marriage of her daughter to Riad ghali who was a christian while the Queen and the princess were sunni muslim and later changed their faith, which was a big scandal in Egypt and affected the monarchy reputation.\n\nQueen Nazli was the first to call king farouk I to tell him in his exile, the monarchy is gone! and replaced by a republic.\n\nThis is a link to the website of the House of Egypt The Royal House of Mehmet Ali\n\nLast edited by a moderator: Aug 3, 2008\n\nhrhcp\n\nRoyal Highness\n\nJoined\n\nSep 14, 2003\n\nMessages\n\n1,937\n\nCountry\n\nCanada\n\nSean.~ Posted: Nov 19th, 2003 - 1:32 pm\n\nMohamed Ali the founder of modern Egypt, He took Egypt independance from the Otthman Empire.\n\nMohamed Ali was the Ottoman viceroy of Egypt and the ancestor of the present claimant. His debts were high because he was trying to develop the country. Also, Egypt was part of the Ottoman Empire until 1914 (only nominally after 1882). It was then declared a British protectorate, and Britain gave it independence in the early 1920s. However, it wasn't full indpenendce in the sense as that we know it. An onerus security agreement allowed for the presence of British troops to remain in the canal (despite the back and forth Bevin-Siddiqi agreement). It wasn't until the Free Officers took over that Egypt attained full independence.\n\nWasn't it the intervention of the USA in the late 1940's to early 1950's that gave Egypt its independence and with it own control of the Suez Canal ?\n\nAs I recall it, this intervention came just prior to a full blown invasion by British as well as troops from France who had been talked into contributing by the English.\n\nThe reading I've done seems to indicate that this action heralded the respective beginning and end of diplomacy on the world's stage by the Americans and the British.\n\nOT while we're on the topic of the waning of British power, it was around the same time that Newfoundland got spun off ....the Brits were broke going into the second world war, and even more broke thereafter.\n\nhrhcp\n\nRoyal Highness\n\nJoined\n\nSep 14, 2003\n\nMessages\n\n1,937\n\nCountry\n\nCanada\n\nSean.~ Posted: Nov 19th, 2003 - 3:00 pm\n\nEgypt's first punishment came in 1955 when the West refused it military aid, even though Egyptian outposts in Gaza were being attacked by Israel at the time .....forced Nasser to negotiate an arms deal with the Soviets (Czechoslovakia).\n\nThen, in 1956, the US withdrew a 56 million dollar loan offer ...towards upgrading the Aswan High Dam ...(the Soviet Union would eventually help fund the project).\n\nNasser responded to all this by nationalizing the Suez Canal ...Thus along with Israel (who the colonial powers used), Britan and France launched a tripartite attack on Egypt in Oct. 1956. The invasion was a failure. It was condemned by the UN, the Soviet Union, and perhaps most notably, by the US.\n\n.... invasion was inimcable to American ....supported anit-colonial struggles with the goal of modernizng the the Third World so that the latter could provide markets for American investment and trade. Thus it could hardly come out and support what was a blatant imperialist invastion. .... the invaders were forced to pull out (remember, France and Britan owed the US for the Marshall Plan).\n\nThanks, Sean.\n\nThe details are of interest. I didn't realize there was a Phase One (1955). I sort of knew about Phase Two from the back end, knowing that the Russians had funded the Aswan Dam.\n\nI hadn't realized that the attack was followed through on. I take it there were a few Russian advisors who assisted in make the invasion a failure?\n\nWas it actually hinted to the Brits about their dependence on the Marshall Plan ? Who was the President - Ike? and the Secretary of State- Marshall ? lots of credibility for those two to say a lot in a few words.\n\nChristian\n\nps: \" inimcable\" means unsuitable or similar ?\n\nahmedtayeb\n\nNewbie\n\nJoined\n\nNov 18, 2003\n\nMessages\n\n7\n\nKing Ahmed Fouad II and his sister princess Fadia (Died)\n\nKing Ahmed Fouad II with his two princess sisters in Paris\n\nKing Ahmed Fouad I, Father of King Farouk II and Grandfater of King Ahmed Fouad II\n\nKing Ahmed Fouad I\n\nPraying on the Coffin of Princess Fadia in Egypt before Burial\n\nKing Fouad Funeral\n\nprincess Fadia Coffin before Burial\n\nKing Ahmed Fouad II wedding in Monaco\n\nEgyptian C\\rown Prince Ahmed Fouad II\n\nEmpress fawzia and Shah of Iran\n\nAttachments\n\neg4.jpg\n\neg5.jpg\n\ndiwan6.jpg\n\ndiwan4.jpg\n\neg6.jpg\n\nspe1.jpg\n\neg10.jpg\n\neg7.jpg\n\nfrons.jpg\n\nimper.jpg\n\nLast edited by a moderator: Jun 20, 2006\n\nahmedtayeb\n\nNewbie\n\nJoined\n\nNov 18, 2003\n\nMessages\n\n7\n\nQueen Nazli\n\nRoyal Banquet, Queen Nazli, Princess Fawzia and Feryal, King Farouk II and Queen Farida\n\nKing Fouad I\n\nPrincess Fadia Birthday\n\nKing Farouk I\n\nAttachments\n\nspe3.jpg\n\nspe2.jpg\n\nspe5.jpg\n\neg9.jpg\n\nrecre_farouk.jpg\n\nLast edited by a moderator: Jun 20, 2006\n\nPoppy\n\nNobility\n\nJoined\n\nSep 5, 2003\n\nMessages\n\n441\n\nOriginally posted by Sean.~+Nov 19th, 2003 - 3:55 am--></div><table border='0' align='center' width='95%' cellpadding='3' cellspacing='1'><tr><td>QUOTE (Sean.~ @ Nov 19th, 2003 - 3:55 am)</td></tr><tr><td id='QUOTE'> <!--QuoteBegin-ahmedtayeb@Nov 18th, 2003 - 7:23 pm\n\nRoyal Princesses\n\nQueen nazli, Princess Fawzia and princess Farial\n\nPoor Nazli.
