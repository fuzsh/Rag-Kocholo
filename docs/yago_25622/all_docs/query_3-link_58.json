        "text": "A memorial service was held for family and friends on Sunday, February 10 in the Water’s Edge Room at the IBM Center in Palisades. After Jean-Christophe and Kim spoke, Beatrice’s daughter-in-law Rita read a remembrance from Beatrice’s niece Nathalie, representing her family in France.\n\nPalisades Library Board of Trustees president Mary Ellen Ledwith closed the ceremony by announcing that the Board has created a ‘memories’ page on the Library’s web site that will be called ‘Thank You, Beatrice.’ The site is a way of documenting and sharing our stories and memories. See www.rcls.org/pal.\n\nSecondly, Harriet Hyams, Palisades’ resident for over 25 years, and painter, sculptor and stained glass artist, generously offered a gift of stained glass windows to the Library in memory of Beatrice. The Board accepted this gift, feeling it was a wonderful way to recognize Beatrice’s contributions to the Library and community. Harriet’s gift includes her time and services related to all elements of design and production. The Board has appointed an Oversight Committee for this project. Materials and installation costs will be the responsibility of the Library. Funding will be supplied by the Library’s Friends of the Library Account. Harriet’s beautiful work can be seen on her web site www.harriethyams.com.\n\nMany have asked about ways to honor Beatrice’s memory. In lieu of traditional gifts, Beatrice’s family requests donations in her memory be made to the Palisades Library that she loved so much. Please make checks payable to Friends of the Palisades Free Library, 19 Closter Road, Palisades, New York 10964.\n\nIf you have any questions about these activities, please feel free to contact Mary Ellen Ledwith, President, Board of Trustees, Palisades Free Library, at meledwith@aol.com."
