Biography

She was born to a Jewish family in Paris as the daughter of Robert Loeb and his wife Paule Madeleine Picard. When a student of 29 she wrote her doctoral thesis at the Sorbonne on the Psychology of Women in The Book of One Thousand and One Nights.[2]

Engagement and marriage

At Monaco's royal palace, she met and began her courtship with HM King Fuad II, whom she married on 16 April 1976 in Monaco. Although she married Fuad II after the loss of his throne, she was still styled Her Majesty Queen Fadila of Egypt by monarchists.[3] The marriage ended in divorce in 1996, and since 1999 she is styled Her Royal Highness Princess Fadila of Egypt.[4]

Divorce and financial difficulties

The marriage was dissolved in 2008 with the style and title removed by Fuad. In 2002, her Paris apartment was taken from her due to her outstanding debts.[5]
