        "text": "by Elise Spenner\n\nWhat were you up to during high school? I know from scrolling through your Twitter feed that you worked at a tennis club. What else were you doing?\n\nThat’s right. I was. I was getting fired from a tennis club for juggling tennis balls at the front desk. Very auspicious start to my career. Other than that, I think I had a, I don’t know, a pretty conventional high school experience, right? I got good grades. I did a year of ASB. I hung out in parking lots at night because that was the only place to hang out. But there’s a lot of common threads that lawyers have that I didn’t. I didn’t do debate club; I didn’t do mock trial, things like that. I always really love to write. I loved my English classes, which I guess sort of steered me in the direction of a career like this one. But I’m definitely not one of those folks who grew up knowing that they wanted to become a lawyer, or a journalist, which I guess I’ve ended up doing both.\n\nWould you say that your first love was really writing more than law or anything else?\n\nOh, yeah. I always loved writing. When I worked as a lawyer, that was my favorite part about my legal career, and obviously, as a journalist, I get to do even more of that. So it’s fortunate, right, that I found a niche, I found a path that allows me to do both.\n\nDid you have any really good English teachers that gave you good advice and really set you on this course?\n\nAbsolutely. It’s a little bit earlier than high school for High School SCOTUS, but my seventh grade English teacher, Karen Bach, really imparted to me a love of writing and always encouraged me to put more into it. To not just accept that there was a certain level of effort that could get you a certain grade and you could move on with your life; you can be done with your homework for the day. She encouraged me to put more time in it. To work at it all the time. She’s retired now, but my mom still sees her in the grocery store every once in a while. She always asks how I’m doing, and she’s always really happy to learn that I ended up on a path that allows me to do this.\n\nI know that — and this is skipping past college a bit — you’ve interned for some politicians. Did you ever consider a career in politics or government? Was that even an option for you?\n\nYeah, I mean, if you spend some time in D.C., it’s almost impossible not to want to work in that space. D.C. is such a young person’s town. Most of the folks who are working on Capitol Hill are young people — wildly underpaid young people, but that’s a that’s a topic for a different day — and living there after college you meet so many interesting folks who really believe that their work can make a difference. And some of them are right, and some of them will eventually be proven wrong. But the energy in a place like that is really exciting. Ultimately, I decided to move on from D.C. and go to law school, not because I didn’t want to be there anymore, but because I felt like I had reached a limit of what I felt like I could do as a non-lawyer. I knew I wanted to work in a space that touched in politics and policy, and I watched so many lawyers do their work every day and just thought, “Well, I can’t do that right now. I haven’t been to law school. I’ve gotten as far as I think being a 22-year-old with a BA will take me.” And so that’s why I moved on to law school from there.\n\nWere you still one of those people, leaving DC and going to law school, that believed that what you were doing was going to make a difference? Or had you abandoned that idealistic point of view?\n\nBy the time I left D.C., I was less idealistic than I had been when I arrived, and was still far more idealistic, I guess, than I am today. Which, I don’t know, seems like a fair enough balance. I think being in D.C. helped me understand — again for that year between college and law school — what I could accomplish, what people can accomplish, what success in progressive politics and policy could look like. But I also understood for the first time that D.C. wasn’t like watching the West Wing when I grew up — that was a TV show, not a documentary, it turns out.\n\nYou go on to Harvard Law, and I want to touch on this a bit. From what I understand about Harvard is that it is a breeding ground for the next generation of the clerks, the advocates, the judges. Were you part of that system — one of the people that was trying very hard at law school to get ahead and make their name in the legal world?\n\nYou’d have to ask my law school classmates. There are very few people, I think, who go to law school with the express intention of not becoming a lawyer afterwards. There are people like me who get there and discover that maybe there are limitations to that path for them. There are people who after practicing law, obviously, for a while, decide to move on to a different path. But to a certain extent, you kind of have to buy into law school to make your investment of time and money worth it, at least at first. And then also it’s just such a small, insular world that it can be really hard, especially in your first year of law school, to not completely get a poison-brain perspective about the rest of the world. Your whole life is studying and trying to get some good grades, so that you hopefully get a good job after your first year of school. And this was also in the tail end of the recession, where you’ve heard stories about how coming out of Harvard Law School in the 2000s you would have a dozen job offers. And now you were still getting job offers, but you weren’t having them thrown at you. You had to do some work for them — which probably is good for everyone to have to do some work for a job — but it was like a high-stress environment. And so I certainly did not go into law school as cynical about the state of the legal system as I am now. It takes a while for that to set in.\n\nSenator Whitehouse told me that he did everything he could to avoid the law school rat race. How do you think your classmates at law school remember you?\n\nI think that’s a good observation. And I’ll come back to that. I didn’t try out for the Law Review. Don’t think I was going to make the Law Review, even if I haven’t tried it out. But I was able to figure out by the end of my first year of law school that legal academia probably wasn’t for me. The same thing with clerkships which is something closely associated with the legal academic job market. I don’t know that my grades were good enough to get a sweet, sweet clerkship, but even if they had been, I was able to figure out again that that path wasn’t right for me. But I want to emphasize that it didn’t come naturally to me, and it doesn’t come naturally to a lot of first year law students who see all of these potential opportunities before them, these doors that could be open to them. And there’s so much unknown potential on the other side of this. I think a big part of any level of education — college, law school, professional school, whatever — is learning to accept that you’re going to close some of those doors, on purpose, and that’s going to be okay. Because you’re focusing on the right one for you.\n\nI’ve interviewed a lot of very successful people that are lawyers/journalists/judges, and it’s very easy for me to internalize that there’s very much one way that you should go to achieve that success.\n\nI think it’s important to understand that what I thought my long-term career might look like when I applied to law school in 2009 is not necessarily what seems like the best career path for me in 2017. And that’s okay. Because I’m not necessarily constrained by the choices I made eight years ago, 10 years ago, whatever.\n\nI’ll not make you talk about law school more. How did you find yourself practicing law, and then what turned you off from that career path?\n\nI think for me, there were parts of being a lawyer that I really liked. I don’t want to suggest that going to law school was necessarily the wrong choice for me, or that I was never destined to become a lawyer. I don’t think that at all. It’s more just that I felt like a real sort of pull towards more of a career in writing. And to be fair, the most rewarding writing I feel like I’ve done is in the career that I’m in now — writing that relates to the law. I don’t know if I could do my job effectively if I hadn’t been to law school. So it was less running away from the law, but rather was running towards something else. And I talk to a lot of people, especially young lawyers, who are dissatisfied with their career and who want to do something else. And I mean, I very much sympathize with the perspective of doing something where you don’t feel like you belong, you don’t feel like it’s right for you. That’s awful, whatever the case may be. But the guidance I always had or that the guidance that I can offer is like “It’s great if you don’t want to be a lawyer, but what you have to find out is what you want to do instead. Because “not a lawyer” is not a career or profession. You have to find out what the other thing is that you want to do.\n\nHow did you figure out that that was journalism like that? You liked to write, but why was it journalism instead of academia or, I don’t know, writing novels?\n\nLet’s see. So as I shifted towards writing, this was like 2014, 2015, so this was before Facebook was just like a giant cesspool of QAnon conspiracy theories and anti-vaxxers. When people could actually interact on it and post on it in mildly productive ways. I found myself being one of those people who would write like two-paragraph statuses about some politics article that I read. And I got a lot of positive feedback on it. I’m not saying that people would be like, “Wow, Jay, your Facebook status is so great.” But they would talk to me about it, there would be a conversation; there would be a debate; people would engage with it in a way that like I hadn’t experienced previously, and I felt like that nudged me into trying to write in a longer format.\n\nSo for about a year while I was practicing law, I wrote just like my own blog. I’m sure that the audience was my Facebook friends and my mom, basically. It was mostly just writing for myself, trying to figure out what worked, what I liked writing about, what I didn’t like writing about, different formats, different subjects. And that blog did not make me famous, but it gave me a lot of practice in terms of finding my voice. And then from there, eventually, I started occasionally pitching freelance stories again, while I was still working full time as a lawyer. But that’s how, in my experience, you build a career like this: one freelance assignment rolls into another freelance assignment; suddenly you have a couple different bio lines. You can say “I’ve been published in a, b, and c publications.” Then more editors are willing to read your pitch, to hear you out. It only takes one to start building a career. You just have to, sometimes you have to really work for that first foot in the door.\n\nSo first, you were able to engage with this Facebook dialogue without that becoming all-consuming and getting negative feedback. And then secondly, you didn’t expect that your first blog post would go viral, which I think can often feel like the expectation or the desire for fledgling writers.\n\nYeah, I mean, I wasn’t on Twitter at the time. I was still in a life phase where Facebook was how I caught up with my friends from high school and college. And so it wasn’t like I was unleashing this for the masses on Twitter to read or something like that. It was definitely an audience of people who were familiar. But again, this was mostly work that I was doing for myself. I did it because it brought me joy and made me happy. I would get done with a long day of working at the office, and I didn’t always want to go write something, but I also realized that if I didn’t do that, the alternative career career path that I was exploring in terms of writing journalism, there was no other way to do it — other than to do the work. So that was enough to keep me typing even when I rather would have been doing something else.\n\nOn your blog, you wrote about everything. And I know when you eventually started writing for GQ, it was kind of the same — this eclectic mix of content. So how did you write about so many different things? Did you have a niche?\n\nYeah, like the cool thing about working at a publication like GQ is that you can try out a lot of different things. This was also late 2016, 2017, when suddenly, there was such a booming interest in politics, even from people who hadn’t really followed it previously. And everyone needed to become a politics writer to a certain extent, every publication needed folks who could meet this demand for this type of coverage. But again, the cool thing about GQ is, I could write about that, and then if something cool happened in a basketball game that night, I could also write about that. So again, it was a real blessing to be at a place where I could try different things. I could use different parts of my brain, and I didn’t feel like either got in a rut or felt like I was getting pigeonholed.\n\nI do think that a common piece of advice I’ve heard and that I would certainly give to other aspiring journalists, though, is find a niche. Find a beat. Find something where you can be the person that people want to read on this particular subject. I don’t really know how to reconcile the two things because I think there’s a lot of value to that advice. I guess maybe the way I try and do it is to say, “I’m glad that I got to be a generalist. And also it helped me settle on a beat eventually.” But I especially think that in the media economy where there is so much competition — it’s not just traditional publications who are writing anymore, Anyone can and should be a journalist — being identified with a specific topic, I really think is a strength.\n\nYou went from working as a lawyer to writing for GQ. Was it hard for you to realize that you were writing for an audience that was not professionally trained in the law or spent every single second enmeshed in the political world? Did you change your writing to fit that audience?\n\nIt was wonderful. I think part of the failure of political journalism, and especially legal journalism, is that it’s written by folks who are very inside the bubble in the world that they cover. And again, I think it’s especially problematic in legal journalism, when most of the people who are writing about this are lawyers — their natural inclination is to write for the people they know best, which is, by and large, other lawyers. And I think that so much of legal journalism is really inaccessible because of that. If you’re someone who’s not a lawyer, and you’re reading about the latest Supreme Court decision, you hit your first couple Latin phrases and as a reader, you have the reaction of, “Oh, this isn’t for me. This isn’t directed to me. This is for someone else.” And I think that’s a real failure because the law is a tool for the distribution of political power. The Supreme Court is a political entity wielding political power, and people should be as concerned about and informed of what the Court is doing as they are about what the President, the House, the Senate are doing. To the extent that there are features of legal journalism that make coverage of the Court and the judiciary less accessible to people who haven’t been to law school, that’s a real failure.\n\nYou talked about lawyers writing for and to other lawyers when their audience is non-lawyers. But does it not take a lawyer to be able to simplify something so complex into something that someone might actually be able to understand? How do you turn a very complex legal topic into something that an everyday person can digest without losing the main point?\n\nFor me, it involves reframing or reimagining, reconsidering what the main point of the case is. One of the guiding principles of how I try and write, and how Balls and Strikes tries to cover the law is: Court decisions should be evaluated based on how they affect real people’s lives, in the real world, not based on an esoteric academic debate about whether the reasoning was sufficiently faithful to a previous appellate court decision or a previous Supreme Court opinion. I mean, I think that’s interesting for appellate litigators and law professors who are putting their constitutional law syllabus together for the fall. But that’s not important for the person whose rights are being affected by the Court’s decision.\n\nTo take an example, if you’re a native person in Arizona, it doesn’t really matter how the Supreme Court arrived at its precise decision in Brnovich last year. What matters to you is that the Court has taken a step that the data shows makes it significantly harder for you to cast your vote and participate in democracy. Similarly, if you’re a person who may become pregnant in Texas, the precise procedural mechanisms of the way that Texas S.B. 8 arrived before the justices, the implications of the justices’ ruling, that doesn’t matter to you, right? What matters is whether or not you can obtain abortion care, whether you have this constitutional right to abortion that the Court has said exists and then has spent the last 50 years slowly and systematically hollowing out. That’s what matters. In my view, that’s what should be front and center in legal coverage, and when so much of this coverage instead focuses on procedural issues for obscure technicalities that really only lawyers can understand, that’s where I think legal journalism fails.\n\nWhat did you feel was missing in the legal establishment that made you think that Balls and Strikes was so necessary at this point in time and that made you decide to start the blog?\n\nYeah, one thing that struck me that I’ve written about a bunch now is one of the primary lenses through which people learn about what the court is doing is these articles that get written at the end of every term — the end of term recap. “The Supreme Court has been in session for the last nine months. What did it do? Here’s what you need to know.” And especially — or even — as the court moved further and further to the right, there’s such a strong tendency among members of the legal press corps to frame what’s happening as some wins for the liberals, some wins for the conservatives. “Supreme Court charting a narrow and sometimes unexpected court.” One headline from this last year in The Economist: “America’s Supreme Court is less one-sided than liberals fear.” You get this message from the legal press corps that the Court is sort of business as usual, that sometimes one side is winning, sometimes the other side is winning, and here’s how the score broke down this time. And that just badly obfuscates the state of the Supreme Court, and it misses out on critical context of how the body got to where it is today.\n\nFor pretty much all of the Supreme Court’s existence, I would argue it’s been a fundamentally reactionary institution. Especially for the last 50 years, since the end of the Warren Court, it’s certainly been a conservative institution. And for the past five years, since the confirmations of Justices Gorsuch, Kavanaugh and Barrett, suddenly we have this 6-3 conservative supermajority that has yielded the most conservative Supreme Court since the New Deal era. Like this is a seismic shift in the composition of and control of the nation’s highest Court, and for journalists to just recap each term like it’s a baseball game that had an exciting finish, I found that very frustrating. So I wrote a little bit about that in 2020. And again this past year. But what I try and bring in my writing, what I want Balls and Strikes to convey, is this critical context that you have to understand how the Court got to this point to understand the decisions that they’re handing down, and understand where they are likely to push the law in the years and decades to come.\n\nWhy do you think you were the person to do this reporting and start this site? What do you have to offer?\n\nLet me answer this question in two parts. First of all, again, I bring a certain opinion and a certain perspective to the way I cover the law, and the courts, and the Court. I don’t try to hide my perspective. I’m pretty open about that. I have been writing from this perspective since 2016, 2018 more regularly. This isn’t new for me. I also feel like I come from a sector of media, my time at GQ, that makes me comfortable writing about serious things in irreverent ways that sort of challenge sustaining power structures. For example, I think I would probably feel differently about Supreme Court journalism if I had worked at the National Law Journal then if I worked at an organization, and an outlet like GQ.\n\nAll of that said, I really want to emphasize that I don’t think there’s anything particularly special about me in doing this work. There are many commentators who have been very critical of the Court for a long time. Many of them now are partners, contributors here at Balls and Strikes. Like Elie Mystal at the nation. The crew of the 5-4 podcast: Peter, Michael, Rhiannon. But they’re also like, I don’t mean to couch either journalism or academia as a monolith. Professor Erwin Chemerinsky has been very critical both of the Court’s jurisprudence and also the way the Court as an institution wields its power. Writers like Mark Joseph Stern, Ian Millhiser at Vox, have infused their coverage of the Court with perspective. I would like to think that more journalists are responding to what’s happening at the Court and are willing to meet this moment. But there are still a lot, especially the highest profile journalists, who don’t, and that’s the sort of thing that I would like to see Balls and Strikes function as a corrective to.\n\nYou said “reporters meeting this moment.” Do you mean that they need to stop pretending that the court is nonpartisan and not being politicized? Or that they need to adopt a certain perspective?\n\nAt this point, talking about the Court as an apolitical or neutral institution, bringing that perspective to your coverage, it only benefits the people who currently hold power. Because if you portray it conservative-dominated Court as neutral, that benefits the Republican justices who are using their positions in the Court to implement conservative policy preferences, It gives the Court’s decision this imprimatur of neutrality and authority. I don’t know who believes that at this point. Realistically speaking, it’s not a coincidence that in the cases that are most important to the future of the Republican Party and the conservative legal movement, it’s 6-3 or at absolute best, 5-4 every single time. It’s hard for me to imagine a reporter looking at this and chalking it up purely to coincidence. And I can see that there’s a certain school of thought that frames this not as a difference of political or policy preferences, but as the difference of you know, jurisprudential methods, right: It’s not that the six Republican-appointed justices favor Republican policy preferences, it’s that they espouse a certain methodology that leads them to these outcomes that just so happen to align with conservative policy preferences.\n\nAnd to me, that’s just a distinction without a difference. And I’ll take it back to what I was discussing earlier about how I think legal journalism should center the way the law affects people living their everyday lives. If you’re a person of color who’s going to have a hard time casting a vote in the next election. I don’t really give a shit if that decision was a “faithful” application of textualism, right? That’s cold comfort to someone who is being slowly written out of participation in functioning democracy, and I think reporters do a disservice to members of marginalized communities when they attribute results to something that sounds neutral and bloodless like that.\n\nDo you worry that at Balls and Strikes you’re talking to people that have already accepted what you’re saying: that the Court is politicized? We are progressives, we are liberals, and it sucks. And then nothing’s really changing. What’s the answer then?\n\nYeah, I mean, I would wager that most of the people who read Balls and Strikes broadly agree with the perspective that Balls and Strikes brings to legal journalism. But in my view, there’s a real value to that. There’s a value in being a person who has this perspective on the Court. And you look at establishment media outlets, and you just don’t see that reflected anywhere. And you feel that there’s something important going on, and that nobody else sees it. I think there’s a valuable service and role that a site like Balls and Strikes can play in terms of giving a voice, giving a platform to people who think that way. I think there’s value in an outlet that starts from the premise that law is not neutral, and judges are not apolitical and that it’s okay that that’s the case. An outlet that accepts that premise, and that acknowledges that one does not have to believe this overarching myth of the legal profession.\n\nWhat’s the long term goal? Is there an answer?\n\nI think it’s like Schoolhouse Rock 101, right? Three co-equal branches of government — the executive branch, the legislative branch and the judicial branch. The way that those first two branches typically get covered by establishment media is completely away from how the judicial branch gets covered. It stems from this idea that by virtue of being lawyers, by having been to law school, by thinking like a lawyer, that they’re special and different. They’re not, especially in the policy perspective, that they’re not trying to implement their preferences. They’re trying to make a legal argument — again, as if that can be divorced from how a legal policy affects people’s lives. I think a more successful version of political media and political journalism would be treating the judiciary, covering the judiciary with the same level of skepticism and critique as it treats members of elected branches. Judges are not subject to elections. But they’re also not less political than members of Congress or presidents just because they have life tenure and wear a robe to work.\n\nGQ showed you that you can be irreverent about these topics and not only approach them from an esoteric legal perspective. But I can sometimes slip from irreverence to joking about these things that are so scary and so serious. How do you think we avoid growing overly pessimistic but not having too much irresponsible levity about something that is so important?\n\nI’d like to think about that for a second. I think one thing that’s a real challenge of that dynamic that you just outlined is the distinction between looking at the current state of our politics, right now, in March of 2022, with an evenly divided Senate and a narrow Democratic majority in the House, and a Democratic president who’s facing the first midterm election after his election. It’s hard to look at that and to think about how meaningful Court reform is ever going to happen. That has to be separate and apart from thinking about how the country can get there eventually. I think it’s really important to understand that momentum for this stuff doesn’t get built overnight. And the salience of the Court in people’s lives has increased dramatically, I think, over the past five years. If you look at the polling numbers — favor, disfavor or support the pose for confirmation of judicial nominees — there are a bunch of judicial nominees with some support, some oppose, and some don’t know. If memory serves, Amy Coney Barrett, everyone had an opinion on her nomination. There was no one who didn’t know. There was no one who didn’t understand the stake, and who didn’t have a feeling one way or the other. I think the longer this Court continues to be an engine of anti-democratic politics and policy, the more momentum it will generate for a broader understanding that the current structure of the Court, the way it works now, is not tenable.\n\nI was talking to a friend who’s a professor recently. We were talking about the long term arc of the Court. There’s a bill to expand the Court right now to 13 justices. There are other proposals to reform the Court, reform the judiciary. And we talked about where we think those are going. And he had such an interesting perspective. He said, “I think the Court is going to look fundamentally different in 15 years because I think this generation of law students, college students, young lawyers, people who are coming up simply are not going to accept the status quo.” The word he used was untenable. This just isn’t gonna work. Which, it’s hard to be more specific about that in the moment, right? But it was a theory, basically, that this 6-3 Court is on a collision course with the amount of hyper-conservative, regressive decisions that people will accept or tolerate. And again, I understand how difficult it is, in this precise political moment, to think about a future in which significant reforms are possible, but that doesn’t mean that’s not going to happen. It just means it might not happen by the end of next month."
