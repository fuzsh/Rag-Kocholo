        "text": "The Convergence of Music, Technology and Liberal Arts\n\nThe Bachelor of Science in Music Production & Recording Arts degree is designed for students who wish to study the intersection of music and technology in the context of the liberal arts. This includes disciplines such as songwriting, composing music for film and video games, audio engineering and music production, post-production audio, music business and entrepreneurship, and performing in commercial music genres. Elon’s MPRA program prepares students for a wide variety of careers in the music industry, graduate studies in music technology, or related fields.\n\nThe guiding philosophy of the Music Production & Recording Arts degree program is to bring together the rich historical, aesthetic, and theoretical foundations of music with the stylistic and technological implications of modern music production and recording techniques, preparing talented students to be competitive in the market place of the 21st Century.\n\nElon MPRA Alumni and Student Music Videos\n\nTo give you an idea of the variety and quality of the work our MPRA students and graduates create, here is a playlist of some of the songs written, produced, performed, or engineered by alumni or current students in our program.\n\nMusic Production Facilities\n\nElon’s Music Production & Recording Arts program is housed in a new facility at Arts West, next to Scott Studios and the Art Department. Our MPRA facility includes four production studios for recording, editing, mixing, mastering, and teaching.\n\nRecording Studio A\n\nStudio A features an API 1608 32-channel analog mixing console with dual-layer automation (analog mix and DAW control), with PMC TwoTwo6 nearfield monitors. Our primary DAW is Avid Pro Tools HDX. Studio A’s tracking room can comfortably track as many as 12-16 musicians at once. It includes an isolation booth and eight 8-channel Hear Technologies Hearback personal monitor mixers.\n\nFor more detailed information about our outboard compressors, EQs, and preamps, view the equipment list below:\n\nFor further details about our microphone collection view the mic locker inventory below:\n\nRecording Studio B\n\nStudio B features a Solid State Logic (SSL) Matrix 2 32-channel analog mixing console with dual-layer automation (analog and DAW control), with PMC Result6 nearfield monitors. Our primary DAWs are Avid Pro Tools HD Native and Logic Pro X. Studio B is used as a teaching and learning space for microphone technique, signal flow and gain structure and a place for students to practice the fundamentals of music production and audio engineering before moving to Studio A for higher level recording projects.\n\nStudio C – Live Room\n\nStudio C is a large live room used for tracking larger groups for either Studio A or Studio B control rooms. The Elon Electric Ensemble and Techtronica also rehearse in Studio C. Other uses of the studio include teaching live sound and a meeting space for Limelight, Elon’s student-run record label. Many analog and digital mixing consoles are available for use in Studio C, including our flagship live console, Avid’s Venue S6L.\n\nStudio D – Dolby Atmos, Post-production & Mastering\n\nStudio D is a our new mixing, mastering, and music production studio featuring an Avid S6 48-channel digital mixing console with Dolby Atmos 7.4.1 surround sound designed by world-reknowned studio designer John Storyk. The studio includes a classic modular analog synthesizer in the style of Robert Moog’s creations of the 1960’s-70’s.\n\nMPRA Computer Lab\n\nThe department also has a fully equipped music technology lab featuring full size, 88-key semi-weighted MIDI keyboard controllers, and a sound isolation booth. The lab also houses 18 27″ iMac digital audio workstations with a second 22-inch flat-panel monitor, Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 audio interfaces/mic preamps and ShuttlePro. The stations run Pro Tools, Logic Express, Sibelius, GarageBand, Studio One, Ableton Live, Auralia and other software tools relating to audio production, ear training and music theory.\n\nAdditional Music Facilities\n\nThe Department of Music is housed in the Center for the Arts, a 75,000-square-foot facility boasting numerous concert Steinway grand pianos; McCrary Theatre, a large, fully equipped theatre and concert hall; Yeager Recital Hall; and modular practice rooms and studios. Historic Whitley Auditorium houses a new Casavant pipe organ and a Steinway grand piano.\n\nFor photographs and more information, visit the Facilities portion of our website.\n\nThe Music Production & Recording Arts program also partners with the School of Communications, giving students access to additional recording and production facilities.\n\nMPRA Curriculum\n\nStudents work closely with experienced faculty who are established composers, recording engineers, producers, performing musicians, and music scholars. The curriculum creates a solid foundation in both musicianship and technology, with courses such as music theory, aural skills, applied instrument/voice lessons, performance ensembles, the physics of sound, introduction to music technology, critical listening, studio techniques, music business, and postproduction. Students then build upon these experiences by selecting a concentration that best suits their interests and career goals:\n\nMusic Production – emphasizing songwriting, singing and performing, composing for film and television, etc.\n\nRecording Arts – emphasizing audio engineering, technology, live sound production, mixing, etc.\n\nWithin Elon’s Music Production & Recording Arts degree program, the concentrations, course offerings, and opportunities to combine minors in other fields such as cinema production, business, computer science, and arts administration, offer flexibility for students to customize their curriculum to best suit their learning goals and career plans.
