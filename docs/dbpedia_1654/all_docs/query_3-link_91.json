        "text": "Leadership Blueprint.\n\nRemain Strategic\n\nEnsure my work - and that of my executive team - is strategic. All of our activities need to be aligned with the overarching strategic plan (OGSM) of the larger organization. Any individual that reports directly to me will have a set of measurable tasks during a specific time frame.\n\nBe Persistent & Work Hard\n\nSuccess is a marathon, not a sprint; never give up.\n\nAccept Accountability\n\nHold myself accountable to the highest standards of behavior. The litmus test for every action will be \"Would I be comfortable with the details of my decisions being placed on the front page of a newspaper?\"\n\nEmbrace Responsibility\n\nAppreciate and embrace the responsibility that comes with being a leader. Always realize that many people depend on me.\n\nValue Meetings\n\nEmbrace the importance of team meetings and individual one-on-one meetings. These meetings are not a nuisance or distraction - they are the day-to-day manifestation of leadership.\n\nCreate a Top Team\n\nCreate a team of \"A\" players. My goal is to hire, retain and promote only the best. If someone is not an \"A\" player, my job is to turn them into an \"A\" player or help them find another role where they have a better chance to be an \"A\" player. I will hold my team accountable to the highest standards of performance and behavior.\n\nTreat Direct Reports as Adults\n\nTreat direct reports as bright, capable, responsible adults. Treating employees like inferiors and micromanaging is the ultimate form of disrespect and poor leadership."
