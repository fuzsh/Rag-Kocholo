MUSC 251 or Instructor approval. (This course satisfies Social Science and Speaking Intensive.)\n\ncross listed: EDUC 170, MUSE 170\n\nMUSC 171: Music, Health, and Wellbeing\n\nMusicians learn essential life skills as they prepare for performance. Goal-setting, self-assessment, and navigating performance anxiety are essential skills for successfully navigating both music and life. Utilizing Social Emotional Learning and Mindfulness, students are able to explore their own skill-building while learning how to teach others to develop self-awareness, social-awareness, and responsible decision-making. Connections are made to solo performance, ensemble music-making, social justice/impact, and expanding music education beyond the traditional model of large ensembles. Through self-reflection, focusing on empathy, and broadening an understanding of the impact of music, students emerge with both personal skills to better navigate their own musicianship and an awareness of how to teach these skills to others. No prerequisites. (This course satisfies Social Science.)\n\ncross listed: MUSE 171\n\nMUSC 180: The Theater of Rock\n\nIn this course we take a close look at what rock performers do onstage. How do they present themselves? What does their clothing convey? What do their gestures suggest? How are their props significant? Are they \"being themselves\" or are they performing a different persona? How important is their performance to our perception of the music they play? Utilizing methodologies from the field of Performance Studies, we survey the history of rock 'n' roll starting with early performers such as Little Richard, Elvis Presley, the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Jim Morrison, and Jimi Hendrix. We note the emergence of glam rockers in the early 70s such as David Bowie and Marc Bolan as well as shock rockers like Alice Cooper and Kiss. We also consider groups that seem to be just \"being themselves\" onstage like the Grateful Dead and the Allman Brothers. Other performers we study may include Michael Jackson, Madonna, Prince, Amy Winehouse, and Lady Gaga. Finally, we consider rock performance in the COVID era: Zoom and other forms of online delivery. Students have a chance to examine and write about their favorite music performers in class presentations and papers. No prerequisites. (This course satisfies Humanities and Domestic Pluralism.)\n\ncross listed: THTR 180\n\nMUSC 206: Concert Choir\n\nLake Forest College Concert Choir focuses on choral repertoire written for mixed-voice ensembles, from all genres and time periods. Concerts include collaborations with other ensembles such as the Lake Forest College Sylvan Singers, Chamber Choir, Orchestra, and Concert Band. Students of all ability-levels are welcome. There are no formal auditions and but membership in this ensemble is contingent upon a voice-placement hearing held at the beginning of the semester. This course may be repeated for credit.

(This course satisfies Creative & Performing Arts.)\n\nMUSC 217: World Music Survey\n\nSurvey of music of the world's peoples: music in the cultures of Africa, Asia, and Latin America; the social and cultural roles of music. No prerequisite. (This course satisfies Humanities and Global Perspective.)\n\nMUSC 218: Music of Brazil: From Samba to Pop\n\nMoving from studio recordings of samba and pop artists to field recordings of indigenous musicians, we explore the musical practices of Brazil throughout the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. As we delve into the contours and contexts of music scenes across the spectrum from bossa nova to hip hop, we begin to unpack what motivates musicians to create song as well as the meanings that these musicians and their listening audiences derive from such processes. Students garner essential knowledge about musical expressions in Brazil, including, but not limited to, Carnival, capoeira, country (sertanejo), folk (maracatu, afoxé, forró, repente, samba-reggae), gospel, MPB (música popular brasileira), hip hop, choro, samba, bossa nova, and Afro-Brazilian sacred music (Candomblé and Congado). Moreover, the goal of learning about these genres is not only to develop keen playing and listening skills, but also to hone skills in cultural understanding, collaboration, and empathy. To understand how Brazilian music is a site for racial justice, community, and historical struggle is to begin to develop a clear-eyed view of how Brazilians inhabit the social fabric of humanity in striking and meaningful ways. Learning activities entail lectures, class discussions, guest demonstrations, and student presentations and projects that incorporate creative analysis, writing, and invention. No prerequisites. (This course satisfies Humanities and Global Perspective.)\n\ncross listed: LNAM 218\n\nMUSC 220: Songwriting: Form & Analysis\n\nParticipants are guided through a history of popular American song forms. The course begins by analyzing, composing, and critiquing simple field hollers, chants, or nursery rhymes. Then we analyze classic blues forms, Tin Pan Alley songs, country & Americana, rock, pop, and hip-hop songs. Following each analysis, participants compose original songs based on what we’ve gleaned from our analyses. Original songs are then critiqued by the class. Participants are expected to be able to write accurate chord charts, lead sheets, or accurately represent music in graphic form. Prerequisite: Private lessons in Songwriting Workshop (MUSA 111-20) or permission of the isntructor. (This course satisfies Creative & Performing Arts.)\n\nMUSC 221: Speakers and Phones Workshop\n\nThrough extensive production and critique, the Speakers & Phones Workshop fosters artistic growth among beginners and experienced creators. The Workshop doesn’t depend on access to expensive recording equipment and studios. We use our memories, our bodies, our voices, musical instruments, pen and paper, apps, our smart phones, tablets, laptops… whatever amateur or professional sound-generating and recording equipment participants own or can get ahold of on their own. We edit and polish our audio creations and then distribute them online in attention-grabbing ways. Participants are encouraged to work from their strengths and to push beyond their comfort zones in order to create audio work that ranges from music to sound collage to spoken word to storytelling to journalism. No formal training is required. The only prerequisites are the ability to hear, a willingness to work hard, an open mind and ready access to either a computer or a smart phone. (This course satisfies Creative & Performing Arts.)\n\nMUSC 222: Grateful Dead and American Culture\n\nMore than fifty years after the band's founding, the Grateful Dead looms larger than ever. From Haight-Ashbury acid-testers to visionary entrepreneurs, the band that grew up and out of the revolutions of the tumultuous 1960s found a way to mix everything from roots music to free jazz to rock into an \"endless tour\" that put them in the Fortune 500. The Grateful Dead provided a cultural soundtrack for not only the 1960s, but also the paranoia of the Watergate years, the Reagan-soaked 1980s, and on to the jam-band present. This course will focus on the band's performance of authentic \"Americanness\" throughout its half century run. We'll listen to their music, and also to their fans, enthusiasts, and scholars. We'll understand the various subcultures that separate the sixties and now, and in doing so, offer answers to this key question: Why do the Dead survive? (Elective for English, Theater, and Music) (This course satisfies Humanities.)\n\ncross listed: THTR 206, ENGL 251, AMER 202\n\nMUSC 223: Brazilian Music, Language, Culture\n\nThis introductory course is designed to develop the student's ability to comprehend, speak, read, and write basic controlled patterns of the Portuguese language. Brazilian music is used as an important tool to reinforce aural and written language acquisition as well as to provide specific cultural context through the examination of historical, social, and political elements of the music. The course draws from comparative linguistics to enhance student learning by making explicit connections between Portuguese and other Romance languages (French, Spanish). No prerequisites. (This course satisfies Global Perspective.)\n\ncross listed: LING 223, PORT 223, LNAM 223\n\nMUSC 225: Intro to Electronic Music\n\nDesigned for beginners in electronic music composition, the course provides a hands-on introduction to digital audio workstations.

No prerequisite. (This course satisfies Humanities and Domestic Pluralism.)\n\ncross listed: AMER 227, AFAM 227\n\nMUSC 237: Hip-Hop Music Producers\n\n(Hip-Hop Music Producers: American Music in Black, White, and Gray.) In this course we examine the role of the hip-hop producer. We learn the origins of hip-hop deejaying and music production and follow its development into sampling, digital collage, and producer-as-hip-hop-auteur. By digging into the sources of various samples, we learn about the history of American popular music production. In addition, we put the music created by hip-hop producers into historic context. There is no such thing as music production separate from identity. Because hip-hop is the dominant musical form of our time, and because it's widely viewed as a form of black music, we study it to flesh out American musical identity. In-class time consists of listening, lectures, discussions, quizzes, and midterms and final exams. Homework consists of readings and listenings. No prerequisites. (This course satisfies Humanities and Domestic Pluralism.)\n\ncross listed: AFAM 238\n\nMUSC 251: Music Theory I\n\nBasic elements of tonal harmony including triads, seventh chords, figured bass, harmonic progression, voice leading, and four-part writing.

This course charts the development of music and sound in film, from these deep roots through the mis-named silent-movie era and on to the great film composers of the twentieth century and today. Students will learn the fundamental elements of a film score, investigate how a film composer works, and develop a vocabulary for describing and assessing film music. No prior knowledge of music or film history is necessary. (This course satisfies Humanities.)\n\ncross listed: AMER 266, CINE 266\n\nMUSC 267: Disney, Music and Culture\n\nWalt Disney created an empire both influencing and being influenced by society and culture since its inception. Disney films, music, propaganda, media, business practices, and merchandise have been imbedded into popular culture.

A major element of this course will involve viewing Disney films and analyzing critically based on the lenses mentioned above. The evolution of how Disney utilized music will also be examined at length. Cross-listed with American Studies. No prerequisites. (This course satisfies Domestic Pluralism and Writing Intensive.)\n\ncross listed: AMER 272\n\nMUSC 268: Music and the Mind\n\nIn this course, we wrestle with fundamental questions regarding music and the human experience. Why does music exist? How did it evolve in the human species? What, exactly, does it do to us, as listeners and as practitioners? How does music change our brains? Is there really such a thing as a \"Mozart Effect?\" What new promises are there for therapeutic uses for music? Music's presence in the human species is clearly puzzling. While many scholars have speculated a reason for its existence, there is no definitive answer as to why we make music. Nevertheless, we do make music. There is not a single human culture on Earth that has no music. Some of the books we will be reading include Musicophilia, The Singing Neanderthals, and This is Your Brain on Music. Note that this is a course that requires students to give oral presentations. No prerequisites.
