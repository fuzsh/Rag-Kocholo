        "text": "Flutist Amy Porter has been praised by critics both for her exceptional musical talent and her passion for scholarship. Through a versatile and distinguished career as a concert performer, she has become one of the most skillful and creative muses for composers of our time.\n\nFrom her prolific performances of Michael Daugherty’s Trail of Tears to her October 2022 performance at Carnegie Hall celebrating Lukas Foss’s centennial with the Buffalo Philharmonic, Porter’s accomplishments speak for themselves.\n\nThe multifaceted Porter is also an acclaimed professor of music. Recipient of the Henry Russel Award in 2006, Amy has served as a mentor to developing musicians at the University of Michigan and leads an intensive residency at local colleges and universities for the study of flute performance. Her Flute Studio specializes in exercises, audition materials and advice, as well as performance techniques for the next generation of flutists.\n\nSince 2020, Amy has hosted her popular “PorterFlute Pod” podcast and her AOS-Wellness.com website offers her Anatomy of Sound™ curriculum. Building on Anatomy’s workshop success, the new AOS-Wellness.com website offers courses in peaceful breathing, yoga and meditation, along with channels on movement, meditation, wisdom, practice, and breathing. Through these platforms, Porter highlights the importance of self-care as a direct path to a successful musical career.\n\nShe is the Founder of VoiceBox 3-D LLC as an innovator, producing “My Breathing Buddy” lung/ribcage/diaphragm simulators, combining her talents in music education with a drive for business, mentoring with UM Innovation Partners. Touchless teaching will be more popular with the new toolboxes from VoiceBox 3-D and Anatomy of Sound™.\n\nMoreover, in an effort to create holistic experiences for orchestras, presenters and their respective audiences, Amy offers mini-residencies alongside her performances. There, she can connect 1:1 with her colleagues and audiences to support, inspire, and reinvigorate musicians and music listeners.\n\nWinner of the 3rd Kobe International Flute Competition and the Paris/Ville d’Avray International Flute Competition, Ms. Porter has served on international juries around the world, including the 6th Kobe competition. She has been heard in recital on National Public Radio; on PBS’s Live From Lincoln Center; and featured on the covers and as a writer for the magazines Flute Talk in the USA and The Flute in Japan. Her popular study guide on the early 20-century German composer Sigfrid Karg-Elert elicited the following comment from the Spanish Flute Society: “Strength, beauty, a captivating and seductive force, sensitivity, perfection and a sense of humor characterize the impressive American flautist Amy Porter.”\n\nShe has won praise both as a recording artist and as a chamber musician. Corinna da Fonseca-Wollheim, in her New York Timesreview of the CD In “Translation: Selections from J.S. Bach’s Cello Suites” on the Equilibrium label, applauded Ms. Porter for her “gleaming, lyrical reading.”\n\nAs a member of Trio Virado, with violist Jaime Amador and guitarist João Luiz, she recently recorded the upcoming second CD “Scaramouche” , to be released in 2024. Previously, they recorded “Mangabeira,” a CD featuring works by Piazzolla, Brouwer, Hand, Assad, and Luiz, about which Ken Keaton wrote in American Record Guide: “They [Trio Virado] present a set of performances that are unfailingly strong, expressive, and imaginative.”\n\nFormerly a member of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, Ms. Porter is Principal Flute of North Carolina’s Brevard Music Center, where she performs as soloist, chamber musician, and orchestral player.\n\nBorn in Wilmington, DE, Ms. Porter graduated from The Juilliard School and pursued further studies at the Mozarteum Academy in Salzburg. She plays a 14K white gold flute with rose gold engraved keys made for her by the William S. Haynes Co."
