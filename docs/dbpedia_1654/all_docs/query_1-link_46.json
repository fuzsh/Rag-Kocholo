A budding journalist in 1923, Lucile Morris Upton wrote stories of the Ozarks.

In November of 2002, however, they were all combined under the newly-created United States Department of Homeland Security. Prior to entering his academic career, Dr. Suttmoeller worked in law-enforcement and had many encounters with far-right extremists, namely, white supremacist, and sovereign citizens (a political movement of people to oppose taxation and question the legitimacy of our government).
