You and I have been friends for almost forty years now.\n\nWe’ve donned hip waders and walked together in the whitewater of your beloved McKenzie River. We’ve walked the woods and hills of the Goldstream Valley. One snowy afternoon, in the crepuscular winter light, as we hiked up the mountain above Cynthia’s and my house, you told me at length about your idea for a sprawling book that would somehow encompass the whole earth with the same intensity and specificity as Arctic Dreams. A few years later, while you were working on that book, Horizon, we spent several days in my wood-burning cabin studio listening to, discussing, and studying the scores of all the Beethoven symphonies. We’ve worked together on several creative projects over the years, and we’ve enjoyed one another’s company all over this continent.\n\nBetween our times together, we’ve sustained a running conversation. From time to time, you’d call me to read a passage you were working on, anything that had to do with music or sound. I remember a long discussion about the subtitle of your book Field Notes: The Grace Note of the Canyon Wren. It always felt good to be of some small help to you, and we both relished exploring and discovering the equivalences between our work. How many times over the years have we said to one another: “You and I are doing the same work, in different disciplines.”?\n\nThat work is usually solitary. But knowing that you were there in your studio doing your work, made my work in my studio a little less lonely. The oriole nest that you gave me, with the long strands of cassette tape woven into it, is a cherished talisman, always close at hand. And whenever I leave my studio with unfinished work on the table, I always bow and back out of the room, the same way that you bow and back out of yours.\n\nSomewhere along the way, you and I began calling each another “Brother.” Both of us came from troubled families, and over the course of our lives we’ve re-created our own families of people with whom we share ties deeper than blood. You, dear Brother, are the heart and soul of the family I have chosen. I’ve relied on you to give me courage and insight, to help me remember what matters most.\n\nA few years ago, you and I sat on the terrace of Cynthia’s and my apartment in Harlem, taking the afternoon sun, rambling in the easy conversation of two old friends. “You don’t have to answer this now,” I said. “But at some point, I’d appreciate a little direction. I need you to tell me: What should I do when we’re no longer able to sit side by side?” You smiled, chuckled, and said: “Oh, that’s easy, John. I can answer you now. Just keep doing what you’re doing.”\n\nYou made your home in the rainforest on the west slope of the Cascades to protect a beautiful stand of trees from clear-cut logging. You lived and worked there for fifty years. Until the fire came. It’s cruelly ironic that your forest has now been logged to salvage the charred remains, and that you who spoke so eloquently about the changes we are making to the earth, passed your final days as a climate refugee.\n\nIn one of our last conversations, you said to me: “We will all pass away. It’s the earth that is precious.”\n\nI understand, and I feel the same way. But you too, Barry, are precious to me. Your love, your faith, your devotion to the work, and to the earth, have sustained me all these years. And I promise you now that I will continue my own devotion to that work for as long as I live.\n\nRest well, dear Brother. Know that I love you. And I always will.\n\nJohn Luther Adams discovered a unique musical world grounded in space, stillness, and elemental forces while living for almost forty years in northern Alaska. In the 1970s and into the 1980s, he worked full time as an environmental activist. But the time came when he felt compelled to dedicate himself entirely to music. He has become one of the most widely admired composers in the world, receiving the Pulitzer Prize, a Grammy Award, and many other honors. In works such as Become Ocean, In the White Silence, and Canticles of the Holy Wind, Adams brings the sense of wonder that we feel outdoors into the concert hall. And in outdoor works such as Inuksuit and Sila: The Breath of the World, he employs music as a way to reclaim our connections with place, wherever we may be. Since leaving Alaska, JLA and his wife Cynthia have made their home in the deserts of Mexico, Chile, and the southwestern United States.

I grew up in the north and Alaska is the north. Tough women.\n\nBut if you’re going to be an animal, it matters which animal. It’s one thing to be a weasel, another to be a wolf. If you pick wolf, you most likely have Barry to thank. Loyal to their pack, smart, resourceful, survival-oriented, and good-looking as well: what’s not to like? Well, there’s being slaughtered from helicopters. That doesn’t happen to weasels. There is that.\n\nWe were already great fans of Barry’s work. Of Wolves and Men (1978) was a breakthrough, as was Arctic Dreams (1986). To meet Barry was to feel we were entering a sphere where a language was spoken that had been fading away—the language of our inseparable connection with the natural world—yet here was a speaker who was renewing it. Barry was a prophet in the wilderness, not that he would have called it a wilderness. A lonely speaker then—he must often have wondered whether anyone was truly listening—he is an essential speaker now. Though many of his contemporaries in the seventies and eighties may not, by and large, have understood the urgency of his message, the young people of such worldwide movements as Extinction Rebellion grasp it very well. Every breath we inhale comes from Nature; kill it and we kill ourselves. The oceans are the lungs of the planet, and the northern oceans are the key to that system, a system that has made Earth a Goldilocks planet for eons.\n\nNow that the man-made Sixth Great Extinction is upon us and the Arctic is melting, the centrality of Barry’s writing is self-evident. We lose our connection with the matrix that sustains us at our peril, and that peril is approaching faster than once anticipated. Let us hope that Barry Lopez will not prove to be a singer of the loved and the lost. The loved “blue marble,” the loved wild—if they are irreparably lost, so will we be. Reading Barry’s work—rereading it—is to remind ourselves how very great—and how immeasurably stupid—that loss would be.\n\nThank you, Barry.\n\nMargaret Atwood, whose work has been published in more than forty-five countries, is the author of more than fifty books of fiction, poetry, critical essays, and graphic novels. In addition to The Handmaid’s Tale, now an award-winning TV series, her novels include Cat’s Eye, short-listed for the 1989 Booker Prize; Alias Grace, which won the Giller Prize in Canada and the Premio Mondello in Italy; The Blind Assassin, winner of the 2000 Booker Prize; Oryx and Crake, short-listed for the 2003 Man Booker Prize; as well as The Year of the Flood, MaddAddam, and Hag-Seed. She is the recipient of numerous awards, including the Peace Prize of the German Book Trade, the Franz Kafka Prize, the PEN Center USA Lifetime Achievement Award, and the Los Angeles Times Innovator’s Award. In 2019, she was made a member of the Order of the Companions of Honour for services to literature.\n\nBack to Top | Subscribe | Donate\n\nAnna Badkhen\n\nDEAR BARRY,\n\nIn early summer, we spoke about the American Academy of Arts and Letters and its role as an agent of betterment of the world. This felt an extension of our conversation about what kind of a needful reassessment and goodness a writer must bring about, how we can—soberly, responsibly—counter despair. I am too solitary to make any kind of generalization about writers, but I imagine, or maybe hope, that it is a question about which all writers think, or at least all writers worth their mettle.\n\nPerhaps because I have known hunger and have witnessed starvation, I have always felt writing was not enough, that I also must feed people. So this year, because of the pandemic-imposed distance, I have been making jam. I don’t know if the jar I mailed you and Debra made it in time, but while I was wrapping it, I thought of you talking about a writer’s role onstage in Portland, Oregon, a year ago, during that conversation we had in public. I was watching all the people in the audience who came to hear you, who later stood in line to have you sign their copies of Horizon. Every one of them had responded to your work’s example (or challenge, or encouragement) to listen, to foster attention and astonishment and respect, to develop—or at least to imagine—an emotional vocabulary against depravity. I have no idea who any of those people were, or how they go about their daily lives; I do know that they look up to you, that you set an example, and in this way, through their attention to your encouragement, the world is changed, is changing.\n\nDear Barry, on my desktop is a photograph a friend took from a fishing dock on the east bank of the Euphrates, in Falljuah, at sundown, in September 2003. It is a photograph of a boy jumping off the railing of the dock. The boy reminds me of Lazarus in the Caravaggio painting, the way he bridges the two chiaroscuro banks; he also makes me think of flight, his wings two-thirds of the way to an upstroke, tips pointed like an albatross, and the sun skims a benedictory doubled flare off his shoulder blade. And directly underneath him the river ripples in two concentric circles that I think are pursed there in the middle to keep him in the air, to hold him aloft.\n\nThat evening in Fallujah, before my friend and I met this boy, I filed a newspaper story about a bombing, by the US military, that destroyed a farmhouse not far from the fishing dock, and killed and wounded members of the family that lived in it; two of the wounded were brothers, eleven and nine years old, Hussein and Tahseen. And yet—and yet—that very same day, there was this bird boy, a fisherman’s son, taking flight over the eternal river, glowing, pushing all shadow out of the frame. This is what you teach your readers to see, how we steady the heart and indeed how we soar, no matter the shadow, and in such light. Gratitude.\n\nAnna Badkhen is a writer and essayist who has spent most of her life in the Global South.

I am trying to time my breath to the breath of the whale. Because the distance between us is so great, I can only rely on my sight. The whale surfaces, and I breathe out as I watch the white blossom of steam dissipate. And then I breathe in and hold my breath as the whale sinks below the ocean’s surface. We do this several times, until I finally get it right. This time, as I hold my breath and the whale sinks, I feel all of the air on the cape become pressurized, and the whole world begins to experience what that whale is going through. It is not just me; the whole world is becoming the whale.\n\nAnd then I experience a strange shift in my breathing: when I close my nose and mouth, I don’t actually stop breathing; channels open up to various parts of me, the breath travels out my legs, out my arms, into each organ, into each hair. I become intoxicated with the new movement of my breath, how it illuminates all parts of me. I see with great clarity that my new life has to do with breathing through language, that when Charles Olson uses the word field, he is thinking of breath functioning like a gravitational field in which language, as mass and energy, experiences a similar form of concentration and attenuation. I understand this as a teaching delivered to me within the universality of the dream.\n\nThe distance between me and the whale collapses. The whale begins to concentrate its breath, and I mine. The whale draws in its breath for one last time and rises out of the ocean, but not as a breach from which it will crash back into the water. Instead, it is sounding, a kind we don’t know about, a reverse-sounding in which it starts swimming through the air and into the sky. It is using its whole body to measure a new depth of something it had long wished to know. It crosses a threshold into that condition described in a gospel: When the inner and outer are one, and the above is like the below . . .\n\nThe whale rises vertically now, hundreds of feet above the ocean, passing where I stand on the Foulweather cliff. As it comes level with me, it pauses to look at me with one eye. Its entire being radiates what can only be described as love and something like selfless autonomy. Its huge eye, luminously dark, reflects the world around us, the coastline of Oregon, a line of pale spume, now in great tension, land and sea, earth and sky. I have the strange feeling I have when I look into the eye of a horse, that it is seeing me, all of its body feeling the energy of my body as an expression of who I am. And simultaneously, it is seeing every movement to the horizon, measuring the states of equality within that one uninterrupted field of its perception. We are beyond language now. The whale continues upward. And when I lose sight of it, I wake gasping for breath. As the whale had slowly risen into the sky, I had slowly breathed out every last bit of air I had in me.\n\nI knew the whale was Barry, and that this was a dream of his journey into the next dimension, a dream for which I was simply and miraculously a conduit to that huge spirit of his, and thus a dream to share with all. I walked out on the porch, so grateful for this new cycle of breath, drawing in the air pouring across the meadow and off the pines into my own lungs, felt the illumination of that breath. I thought of how Barry embodied Keiji Nishitani’s observation: “‘Illuminating insight’ does not stop at mere contemplation. It is integrated with the deliverance of all beings in time from the universal suffering of the world.” I felt that selfless vow in the whale’s eye.\n\nIn Barry’s words, he was here: “To help. I am a traditional storyteller. This activity is not about yourself.”\n\nIan Boyden is a writer, translator, and visual artist.

Barry Lopez and Richard Nelson had both spent a lot of time among native people in Alaska. Barry for Arctic Dreams and Dick for Hunters of the Northern Forest and Hunters of the Northern Ice, and they were talking about the potential awkwardness of being observers and outsiders to the cultures they were trying to learn, which must be a professional problem for both anthropologists and journalists.\n\nDick said, “You need to learn how to hang out. It’s an attitude toward time. You can study people in the culture who know how to do it, which we mostly don’t.”\n\nAnd I asked, “So what did you learn?”\n\nBarry squared his shoulders, slid a hand into each pocket of his jeans up to the knuckles, his palms flat against his thighs, in a perfect, physical embodiment of just hanging out. He composed a poker face and then faintly raised his eyebrows in a way that said, “Hey, I’m here, don’t have a program, open to possibilities.”\n\nDick laughed and said, “Exactly.”\n\n…\n\nI had trouble with the sentence describing Barry’s physical attitude and, as I was trying to write it, thought, “Barry would have nailed this.” He was—painful to be using the past tense—a gorgeous maker of sentences. And I think it had to do with his Jesuit education that he had a moral language in which to talk about writing. I’ve heard him speak of the integrity of the sentence.\n\n…\n\nHere is what Barry told me of how he began as a writer. It’s such a good story it might not be strictly true:\n\nWhen Barry finished his master’s degree at Notre Dame, he moved to Oregon and rented a cabin in the woods with the intention of becoming a writer. It was just before the emergence of graduate programs in creative writing at universities. In those days, every drugstore had a magazine rack, and they always contained a magazine called The Writer’s Digest, which printed tips for writers and lists of markets for magazine articles, potential ideas for articles, expected word lengths, and how much they paid per word. Barry bought a copy in his new town while he was getting groceries and went back to his cabin, unpacked, stored the groceries, and began to read. Water for the cabin was supplied by a well and pump, and very soon the pump ceased to function. What you gonna do, the song goes. Barry took the pump into town, and a guy in the hardware store showed him the stock of pumps and explained the pros and cons of each type very clearly. Barry went home, wrote an article on how to buy a water pump, looked over Writer’s Digest, and decided to send the piece to a magazine called Popular Mechanics, which could also be found on the drugstore rack. Popular Mechanics took the piece and paid him fifty dollars. He was in business.\n\n…\n\nAnother occasion. A summer day in Sitka. Dick Nelson is taking us out to Saint Lazaria in his Boston whaler. Saint Lazaria is an island, an old eroded volcano, about eighteen miles out from Sitka harbor, facing onto the Pacific, a nesting place for northern birds and one of the wonders of the earth. I think it can no longer be visited on foot—it is so dense in summer with bird life—but Dick had managed to get us permission to go ashore and talked to us on the way out about what we’d see—colonies of thick-billed murres, the duck-sized black and white birds that fill in Alaskan waters the niche filled by penguins in the Antarctic; brilliant clown-faced tufted pufflins, and smaller birds, pigeon guillemots and rhinoceros auklets. The trip there in summer is itself an amazement, Baranof Island rising steeply out of the sea, rafts of sea otters in the kelp beds around smaller islands and sea lions sunning on the rocky shores, bald eagles soaring overhead, humpbacked whales breaching and blowing. We had binoculars, were taking in as much as we could and occasionally just looked at each other, shaking our heads in wonder. Dick got us ashore which was a bit tricky but we scrambled up a stair-like rise in the basalt As many as 75,000 birds, I have read, breed on the island at a given time in the season and suddenly we were in the middle of it. One walked cautiously. Dick had it in mind to show Barry a spotted lily endemic to the island. We mostly gawked at the teeming life. They were birds I had never seen before or seen only from a distance and they were everywhere and we were decidedly in their living quarters. The racket of bird cries was intense and over a small rise we saw the source of it. In one crevice of rock, perched in its nest, was a fledgling bald eagle, and it was driving the other birds crazy to have this predator in their midst, especially the puffins and the storm petrels and the gulls—glaucous-winged gulls with silvery mantles. They were harrying the young eagle relentlessly, dive-bombing toward the nest and veering away and calling out sharply. The eagle seemed to ignore them and kept hunching his shoulders as if he were contemplating the idea of flying. It had never occurred to me what the young at the top of the food chain had to grow up enduring. Barry said later, when we were heading back to town, and saw those powerful birds commanding the air overhead that it was as if, to be a prince, you got sent to one of those awful English boarding schools that specialized in hazing the young. But at that moment on the island we were just taking in the spectacle. It is another visual memory I have of him, Barry on a ledge of volcanic rock raising both fists in the air and pumping them, as if to say, “If this isn’t the heart of life, what is?”\n\n…\n\nHis mind. At a conference—I no longer remember where; it might have been in Sitka, might have been at a gathering of writers in Washington DC sponsored by Orion—Barry gave a talk that stayed in my mind. He began by saying something like: “I want to say what I’m about to say very carefully because I want to talk about the value of prejudice.”\n\nI haven’t kept my notes. I remember he spoke of the photograph of a black girl in Little Rock, Arkansas being escorted by a Federal officer who was enforcing the desegregation of a school through a crowd of white people who were screaming at her, their faces disfigured by anger and hatred. What had struck him, he said, was the rage on the faces of the white children who were imitating their parents, who had been taught a style of feeling by their community. He talked about the way frugal members of a family could talk for years about the fecklessness of the more open-handed members of the family and the way the openhanded members of the family could talk about the stinginess of the frugal ones. He talked about the antipathy in Alaska between Athabascan and Inuit peoples, said cultures begin in geography, that the culture of cities had to do with density and diversity, so that they should be easy places to cultivate cultural diversity and cultural tolerance, but that that kind of cultural relativism was different from the actual living out of the values of a given culture given to a particular geography when there is so much evidence of violence there like an electric third rail in the relations among peoples. I don’t remember him drawing a conclusion. What struck me was the fearlessness and earnestness of his description of the dilemma he was turning over in his mind.\n\n…\n\nHis prose. “I slow the car, downshifting from fourth to third, with the melancholic notes of Bach’s sixth cello suite in my ears—a recording of Casals from 1936—and turn east, away from the volcanic ridge of black basalt.” This is the beginning of “A Reflection on Snow Geese,” an essay about his visit to the Tule Lake National Wildlife Refuge on the California-Oregon border. It was published in Crossing Open Ground in 1988. The refuge is one of the places on the Pacific flyway to see migrating birds by the thousands—snow geese, Ross’s geese, Canada geese, whistling swans; and hundreds of thousands of ducks in immense flocks—mallards, gadwalls, pintails, lesser scaups, cinnamon teal, goldeneyes, wheels and wheels of them rising out of the marsh at dawn or settling into it at dusk, and the essay is a place to see Barry at work.\n\nDownshifting is a typical move, a recommendation to slow down and pay attention. And naming the exact version of the Bach cello suite is a Barry move. Someone passionate about all species on earth was also passionate about being specific. The movement of the essay belongs to the genre of nature writing Barry had taught himself: first the wonder, then the science, and then in his work—and this where the cello suite returns as an ecological theme—an implicit argument that the fusion of beauty and science in what we are seeing ought to draw out of us a kind of moral wonder. I looked again to see how he does it in this essay:\n\n“What a visitor finds startling is the great synchronicity of their movements: long skeins of white unfurl brilliantly against blue skies and dark cumulonimbus thunderheads riding the towering wash of winds. They rise from the water or fall from the sky with balletic grace, with a booming voice like rattled sheets of corrugated tin, with a furious and unmitigated energy. It is the life of them that takes such hold of you.”\n\n…\n\nThe last time we talked at any length we talked into the night, drinking wine. It was during the time when he was finishing his work on Home Ground. He had been doing a series of readings and he seemed tired and a little strung out and I had the sense that Barry’s feeling for what he was trying to do in Home Ground burned in him like a fever. I think he must have been trying to talk out the ideas in the introduction he needed to write for the book. He and his partner Debra Gwartney had conceived the book along with the editor at Trinity University Press Barbara Ras. The idea was to get a couple dozen writers from all over the continent to compose a dictionary of words used to describe the North American earth. I had a small hand in it, so I am not entirely disinterested but I do think it is one of the most delicious books I know about the English language and about American geography.\n\n“Honor” was another word Barry was inclined to use—“honor” as a verb, or as a verb that he felt urgently needed to be turned into a noun. He thought that he and Deborah were assembling a record of the way that language honors the land by representing over time the exactness and immense variety of the human attempts to name what we see. He wanted to believe that honoring the land would draw honor out of us and our behaviors. That night as we talked his impulse seemed to me messianic. It is a lot to ask of words and the way we use them. But it was a part of Barry’s discipline and self-discipline as a writer to ask it, and it is part of what I admire so much about his work. It mattered to him intensely—the difference between a “wharf” and a “pier,” between an animal’s “den” and its “lair.” And he was inclined to think that, for humans, the welfare of the earth depended on seeing clearly enough to honor those distinctions in the way that the distinctions themselves were ways of seeing that honored the earth.\n\n…\n\nOut of curiosity I looked to see what words and/or what things Barry had assigned to himself when he was editing Home Ground. Here is the list: acre-foot, blind creek, desert, ice volcano, mudslide, pitch, refugium, sand, scarp, shinnery, soil, strike valley.\n\nI wondered why he had chosen the—it would seem—fairly boring term acre-foot to elucidate. In his entry he begins by discussing folk measurements—“ stone’s throw,” “a day’s ride,” “two thumbnails to the left of the highest peak there”—the kind invaluable for orienting one birder to another’s find, measurements, he observes that, though they are not precise, are accurate. And then observes that acre-foot joins “two once-imprecise folk measurements to create a term that, apparently leaves nothing to interpretation. It’s exactly 43, 560 cubic feet of water—a single acre, one foot deep.” Folk measurements: well, a foot must have begun as a rough measure, human feet varying in length, and an acre in medieval England was the amount of land a man with a couple of oxen could plow in a day. And—Barry’s mind—he concludes the note this way: “Given the behavior of water, however, such precision is rarely dead accurate, which accounts for the enduring wisdom behind the use of folk measurements.\n\nAnd while I was at it, I consulted what he had done with sand. He begins with a definition. Definitions always look easier to come to than they are: ‘loose aggregations of mineral grains, mostly quartz, created by geological forces that include plate tectonics and erosion.” The next sentence is classic Lopez: “Wind and water sort this hard detritus so efficiently into masses of like-sized particles that we are able to speak of a sandbar (as distinct from a gravel bar) and other discrete forms, such as a mudflat, which is made up of same-sized particles of clay or silt.”\n\n…\n\nThis morning I think about the fever of the cancer that took Barry and the fire that burned through his property just months before his death, and about the cool and clarity of the landscapes and habits of mind he was drawn to. There was a mix in him of fire and ice that is going to continue to be his gift to us.\n\nRobert Hass was born in San Francisco.

And the rediscovery of the manifold ways in which our lives can be shaped by the recovery of a sense of reverence for life.” — Barry Lopez\n\n“I am perfectly comfortable being in a state of ignorance before something incomprehensible. And it’s in that moment that you’re driven to your knees and you believe—I wouldn’t call it religious. It’s just what happens when you open up again to the extraordinary circumstances of being alive.” — Barry Lopez\n\nIN 2015, Barry and I were invited to do an onstage conversation at the Key West Literary Seminars. We loved the idea of it but hated the given title, and ended up talking on the phone for most of an hour, trying to arrive at a word that felt home-language to us each. The suggested word, spiritual, we felt utterly threadbare. Barry’s preference was reverence, a quality that ran deep in his life and words. But mine was not. We arrived, at last, at numinous. A word whose linguistic root is the act of nodding, a physical, embodied yes.\n\nWhat his life was.\n\nWe first met at a meeting Orion Magazine held at Ghost Ranch in New Mexico, in 2008, though I’d read his books from the start. One of Barry’s great gifts, and so my great luck, was his gift for friendship. Its entrustment runs through every one of the books—in friendships with persons, with plants, animals, orange-eyed mullet, ice. But his affections weren’t given blindly. They were forged of the give-and-take of conversations and relationships in which, whatever the differences, both debaters knew themselves taking the same side. The side of reality, respect, awe, balance, justice; the side of life. These qualities shone out from him, too. We began talking at that meeting, in a walk under moonlight, and didn’t stop.\n\nIn 2010, I was poet in residence at the H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest, ten minutes from the Blue River, Oregon, house that Barry shared with his beloved poet-wife, Debra. Barry broke his strict work schedule and took me—in a Toyota truck old enough to vote though not to drink—onto forest roads up the mountain, then down to a wild hot spring half-hidden under the river’s edge. He showed me wild ginger, and how to notice, in each of a Douglas fir cone’s sturdy bracts, a running mouse shape disappearing headfirst deeper into it, delving the dense nutrition of hidden seed.\n\nA self-portrait, that.\n\nThe last time I saw Barry in person, in 2019, the hay bales in Toby’s Feed Barn in Point Reyes, California, were crowded with an audience of over three hundred, come to hear him read from Horizon. He asked for a copy of my introduction, so he must have liked it, pages that must have burned in the Blue River studio lost to last summer’s fires. It described Barry as being akin to the Very Large Array astronomical observatory, outside Albuquerque, New Mexico—but with his telescopic listening turned earthward, to the earth’s denizens, beings, landscapes, icescapes, stories.\n\n“What comes before affects what comes after.” This basic principle of existence, forest ecologists call “legacy.”\n\nBarry’s words, acts, loves, curiosities, ethics, and judgments; his humility in asking essential and basic questions; his stories directly and gorgeously told; his physical, moral, and personal courage—these living gifts, now become legacy, take on the force of evolution, along with Barry’s raised alarm at our immediate, indecent emergency of climate and biosphere and species’ extinction; along with his hopes for, and ceaseless work toward, the earth’s and our psyches’ long-term repair. He knew these things are not separate.\n\nFew people live through and live out so completely their yes, inside the furnace of the world’s burning.\n\nBarry, no words can hold the loss so many feel of your passing, or the gratitude for your life. I summon, today, from your basket of legacy, your lifelong refusal to entirely despair. Your persistent belief that we might yet live up to the grace of this incomprehensible world and not its darkness, mustered by a man who knew what it is to doubt, to despair. You kept working, kept serving. That helps me. It will continue to help me do what this moment asks: miss you rightly. Miss all the losses rightly, and go on.\n\nJane Hirshfield’s ninth poetry collection, Ledger, a book centered on the environmental crisis and issues of social justice, appeared from Knopf in March 2020.

It is the suitcase that makes the idea portable, the pyx that allows the divine—Dante’s Commedia, Goethe’s Faust—to be slipped into a pocket.”\n\nBarry and words were inseparable and intertwined. His quest for the right word is what drove him. He took the greatest pleasure in finding a word that connected perfectly with his thoughts. He also took pleasure in offering his words to artists who made books using them. He loved to see how an artist’s book gave flight to his words.\n\nWhen he shared this with me, we laughed together over the word pyx. It’s the name of the container that holds the wafer served at communion. We laughed because it also can score forty-five points in Scrabble—with a mere three letters. The perfect word.\n\nCharles Hobson is an artist who uses books as an expressive medium. He has created more than forty artist’s books, including four using Barry’s words: Apologia, 1997, Anotaciones, 2001, The Near Woods, 2006, and The Mappist, 2005. The quotation in the text is from Why I Love Books, The Artworks of Charles Hobson, Bolinas Museum, Bolinas CA, 2002.\n\nBack to Top | Subscribe | Donate\n\nPam Houston\n\nLOOK, he was always saying, listen.\n\nThe last time I saw Barry was at the Berkeley Book Festival, in 2019, where he told a story about sitting in a strip mall in Alice Springs, Australia, with a Pintupi man. Barry was explaining to the man the distinction our culture makes between nonfiction and fiction, the factual truth versus the emotional one. The man listened carefully, thought for a moment, shook his head, and said, “that wouldn’t work for us.” Then he said, “the distinction we would make is between an authentic story and an inauthentic story. An authentic story is about all of us, all the people. An inauthentic story is only about the one who wrote it.”\n\nI put this story in my pocket, with another I heard Barry tell about a word an Inuktitut speaker in Yellowknife shared with him: Isumatuq. Storyteller. The person who creates the atmosphere in which the wisdom reveals itself. And in that same pocket, I added something else Barry said when we were teaching together at Pacific University, that we are pattern makers, that if our patterns are beautiful and full of grace, they will have the power to bring a person for whom the world has become chaotic and disorganized up from their knees and back to life.\n\nTriangulated, these three seem sufficient to construct a writer’s life.\n\nBarry and I were both victims, as children, of serial sexual abuse, and for each of us it was the fleeting glimpses of the wild world available in our respective suburbias—the hot Santa Ana winds, in his case, the blossoming of dogwood forests in mine—that suggested we might one day come fully alive. We recognized this about each other instantly the first time we met, years before either of us would write or speak aloud about those traumas.\n\nIn 2013, when Barry told his story in the heart-stopping essay, “Sliver of Sky,” I learned we had even more in common, that, as adults we had chosen remote homes bordered by rivers and ridgelines to keep us safe; that our childhood terror had, somewhere along the way, mostly metamorphosed into compassion; that, though the abuse had left us utterly disassembled, we had put ourselves back together, thanks to some of those patterns provided by grace.\n\nWhen I heard Barry died on Christmas night, I regretted, for a minute, that we never talked about these things, and then I decided maybe we hadn’t needed to. We’d talked instead about the lady in Arctic Bay, Nunavut, who sold us the warmest hats we’d ever owned right off her kitchen table, or the boat that did or didn’t flip in House Rock Rapid in the Grand Canyon, or a crab named Sally Lightfoot, or eight hundred narwhals running south at the mouth of Kangiqtualuk Uqquqti (formerly Sam Ford Fjord), or how we might try to live now, here at the edge of total climate collapse, how we might best try to take care of each other.\n\nThose were a few of our authentic stories, and in giving them to each other we invited wisdom, or wonder, or laughter, or at least some clear evidence of our survival.\n\nLook, he was always saying, listen, here are the ways you can still be in love with the world.\n\nPam Houston is the author of the memoir, Deep Creek: Finding Hope in the High Country, which won the 2019 Colorado Book Award, the High Plains Book Award, and the Reading The West Advocacy Award, and more recently, Air Mail: Letters of Politics Pandemics and Place, coauthored with Amy Irvine.

I find myself onstage with Barry Lopez, the beloved icon whom I’ve never met until this week. Our moderator asks a friendly opening question, and I reply with something fast and funny. The audience breaks into laughter.\n\nThen Barry speaks and instantly I’m brought to attention and humbled all at once. This is a rare chance, his gentle and deeply thoughtful answer might be saying, to share something sustaining that will leave all of us with something important before we disperse. We’re beings of weight, of responsibility; let’s use this invitation to speak with intimacy, so that maybe this entire community can be brought a little closer to its better self.\n\nIt was just the voice of conscience and rigor I’d met for decades already on the page. Reading Barry, I’d always imagined someone who was part priest and part explorer. The light within was what guided him, and the light without was what he wished to bring us to. Grace and discovery were the engines, and better action was the destination.\n\nIn one of his collections of fiction, I’d read a piece that begins with the narrator on retreat in a monastery high above a California resort town and beach; at some level, that was how I always saw this uncommonly searching and self-questioning soul.\n\nBarry was accompanied, that week in Key West, by one of his radiant daughters, Stephanie, so I could also see the warm companion and counselor in him. But what moved me most was to realize that the man and the writer were of a piece, inseparable; both were committed to the undistracted penetration that makes for a kinder world. Waking us up was a large part of what he was doing.\n\nThat would always be an invigorating goal, but as the world rushes towards ever more diversion, more forgetfulness, and more carelessness, Barry’s special gifts—of patience, of meticulous care, and of sobriety—come to seem more and more bracing. In my mind he was traveling widely, to forgotten places across the globe, with a searchlight, like some archaeologist of the inner landscape, hoping to remind us of what we could be. Working, in effect, to bring us back to our senses.\n\nNine years on, Barry and I met again on that same stage in Key West, and this time I was ready. I wouldn’t enjoy many chances, ever, to engage in a real talk in public that would have the closeness of a conversation in private; it’s not often one can share what one cares about most and know that someone else will listen, understand, and respond in kind.\n\nIn a crowded greenroom, Barry took me aside and said quietly that he was very sick. But that was not something we need to worry about. He had deposited in his New York editor’s office a large book, with instructions that she not read it for now. I couldn’t find the words to tell him that I had sent a link of our first talk onstage to that same editor, the only such gift I’d inflicted on her in thirty-one years of friendship.\n\nToday, a writer who was in the hall that day sends me the news that Barry is gone, along with a link to an interview that reminds us both that Barry will never really be gone. In it he describes being invited to deliver a lecture at an Athenaeum in New England and asking his host what Emerson had sought when he had done the same.\n\n“Elevation,” came the answer. That part, I felt, Barry had mastered long since.\n\nWe’d met only three times in person when we converged in Key West in 2015. But after I’d gone onstage to say a few words and returned to my seat, Barry smiled, patted me warmly, and said, “I’m so proud to be your friend.” As ever, he was giving me a model for what I would wish to write to him.\n\nPico Iyer is the author of fifteen books, most recently Autumn Light and A Beginner’s Guide to Japan.\n\nBack to Top | Subscribe | Donate\n\nSonora Jha\n\nIN THE SUMMER OF 2017, I was awarded the Barry Lopez Fellowship for a monthlong writing residency at Playa’s Summer Lake in Oregon. My first thought was that I didn’t deserve it because I didn’t exactly write about the environment, and Barry Lopez would surely have wanted someone who was doing that kind of writing more directly. I had written a novel set in the stories of farmers losing their land and their lives in India, and I was now struggling to write a feminist memoir. I was told that yes, all of this would be the kind of work that was supported in the award instituted in the name of a writer with a staggering legacy of work that connects the physical landscape and human culture.\n\nEvery single day of that residency, I swam in a large pond, walked on the vast, dry bed of the lake that presented a surface and a quake of the kind I had never felt beneath my feet, and gazed at sunsets that melded into playa’s horizon in strips and hues of color I had never witnessed in my life. I wrote this quote from Barry Lopez on a Post-it note and pasted it on my desk:\n\n“If stories come to you, care for them. And learn to give them away where they are needed. Sometimes a person needs a story more than food to stay alive.”\n\nI was putting my body into spaces and sensations it had never experienced before. I was pushing past my discomfort in the writing that was pouring forth in my memoir, stories that carried anger and shame. These two situations could not be unrelated. I wondered whether I should write to Barry Lopez, to thank him for the fellowship, for his immense writing, for my writing. I hesitated, thought it meaningless, and so I never did.\n\nI am feeling the sadness, the beauty, and the weight of all of it now.\n\nSonora Jha, Ph.D. is the author of the forthcoming How To Raise a Feminist Son: Motherhood, Masculinity, and the Making of My Family.
