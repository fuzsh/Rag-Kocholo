        "text": "“Intelligence and emotional generosity... unerring sense of line and gift for highlighting important themes... She brought passionate intensity to a program of disparate works, from Franck’s familiar Sonata in A and a Bach partita that sounded characteristically like the ruminative thoughts of the composer in measured reflection, to a sonata by Corigliano... Her vigorous reading of a soaring solo passage in the Corigliano... had members of the audience quietly craning their necks forward as if in hope of bathing a little deeper in her exceptionally warm tone.” - Washington Post\n\nA passionate teacher and performer, Amy Beth Horman has enjoyed an active solo career as soloist and recitalist throughout the US and Europe. She made her debut with the National Symphony at age 15 performing the Tchaikovsky Concerto. Ms. Horman welcomes students of all ages, including those as young as elementary school age. Students of Ms. Horman have been selected for the Junior Division of the Menuhin Competition, the Boris Goldstein Competition, featured on From the Top and recipients of the Young Arts Foundation. Ms. Horman is also the creator and host of “Beyond the Triangle,\" a podcast focused on the art of raising young classical musicians. A graduate of the Paris Conservatory of Music (CNSMDP), Ms. Horman received her first prize at age 15 and then was chosen that same year for Conservatory's 3rd Cycle program in the studio of violinist Gerard Poulet. Previous teachers include Jody Gatwood (National Philharmonic Orchestra Concertmaster Emeritus) and Patricia Hurd (Wolf Trap Opera Orchestra, Washington Ballet Orchestra)."
