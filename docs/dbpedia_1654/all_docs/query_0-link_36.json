We offer our clients a tremendous value, because of our highly competitive billing rates and the many services which we offer without charge. Serving franchise clients is a priority for our firm.

That is why we focus on practical, cost effective solutions.\n\nWe back up our advice with franchising’s largest and most successful dispute resolution team. Our litigators have represented franchisors in courts and arbitration tribunals throughout the U.S., taking advantage of briefs, pleadings, and strategies which have withstood challenges in earlier cases.\n\nSpeaking Engagements"
