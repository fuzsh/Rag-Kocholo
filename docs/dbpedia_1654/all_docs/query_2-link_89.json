        "text": "The Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights has selected Rochester attorney Amy Bach’s “Ordinary Injustice: How America Holds Court” as the winner of the 2010 RFK Book Award.\n\n“Ordinary Injustice” details the everyday failings of the American justice system.\n\nAccording to the center’s website, Bach’s “well-researched and reported work argues that because those affected by the American justice system’s failures tend to be poor or minorities, these individuals are often overlooked, and because problems are so pervasive, they’ve become invisible to defenders, prosecutors and judges.”\n\nJohn Seigenthaler, chairman of the Robert F. Kennedy Center Book Award, said in a release that Bach “has given us a keenly insightful and profoundly disturbing exposition of the flawed and failing culture of the nation’s administration of justice. Her detailed and documented account, enhanced by her own professional experience as a lawyer, presents a damning indictment of those within the system whose insensitivity, indifference and ignorance endanger the very ideal of justice under law.”\n\nIn a Dec. 21, 2009 interview, Bach told The Daily Record the book took eight years to complete. Its genesis was a series of articles on civil rights she worked on for The Nation magazine and her experience with a Georgia public defender who plead 48 people guilty in little more than one day.\n\n“I had many, many ideas for different chapters. That’s one reason the book took so long — was to figure out which stories I wanted to tell,” she said.\n\nHer four stories represent four different, but similar, problems with defense attorneys, prosecutors and judges. The research into systemic failure was extremely difficult, Bach said.\n\n“It was so hard,” she said. “The problem with ordinary injustice is that the facts have never been investigated in the first place so, in order to figure out that something has gone wrong, you have to go back and do the initial investigation. Then, since [it’s] about a pattern, you have to show a pattern of lapses.”\n\nThe winning entries and finalists — “Lift Every Voice” by Patricia Sullivan, “American Radical” by D. D. Guttenplan and “Why Cant U Teach Me 2 Read” by Beth Fertig — were chosen from nearly 80 submissions. Dave Eggers was awarded Distinguished Honor for “Zeitoun.”\n\nThe RFK award was founded in 1980 with the proceeds from Arthur Schlesinger Jr’s best-selling biography, “Robert F. Kennedy and His Times.”\n\n-"
