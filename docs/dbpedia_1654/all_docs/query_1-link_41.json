        "text": "Oregon’s 147th commencement, set for Tuesday, June 20, will welcome an alumna as its speaker for the main celebration.\n\nAmy Bowers Cordalis is a mother, fisherwoman, attorney and member of the Yurok Tribe. She is the co-principal of the Ridges to Riffles Indigenous Conservation Group, a nonprofit representing Indigenous tribes, organizations and people in natural and cultural resource matters.\n\nCordalis graduated in 2003 with a bachelor’s degree in political science and a minor in environmental studies.\n\n“The University of Oregon provided me with an invigorating academic experience, rich cultural activities, and a supportive community that allowed me to exercise self-determination,” she said. “I was able to explore different parts of myself through being on the cheerleading team, singing in the gospel choir, working at the Cultural Forum planning the folk festival, sailing, and being active in the Native American Student Union.\n\n“All the while, (I was) studying politics and environmental studies, developing lifelong friendships, building confidence in myself and an understanding of the world. This empowered me to serve my community, river and the country. I am forever grateful to the University of Oregon.”\n\nCordalis has served her Tribe as general counsel and was a staff attorney at the Native American Rights Fund. Her family is from the village of Rek-Woi at the mouth of the Klamath River in Northern California. Since colonization, every generation of her family has fought for Yurok rights.\n\nHer family’s Supreme Court case, Mattz v. Arnett, reaffirmed the status of the Yurok Reservation as Indian Country, laying the foundation for the exercise of the Tribe’s sovereignty and the enjoyment of its federally reserved water and fishing rights.\n\n“Amy has made a significant impact in her community and for her Tribe,” said Kris Winter, the UO’s interim vice president for student life. “Amy embodies what it means to be a part of the University of Oregon community, and we are excited she will be sharing her experiences and aspirations with our most recent graduates.”\n\nCordalis continues her family legacy by focusing her work on Klamath River restoration, including dam removal, water rights and fisheries issues. She also is the author of a forthcoming book, “Child of Big Water, Indigenous Resistance, Resilience and Stewardship: A Family Story Behind the World’s Biggest River Restoration Project.” Among other successes, she was named one of “100 Ducks who Made a Difference” in Oregon Quarterly magazine’s 100th anniversary issue, where she was included in a list of alumni, students, faculty members, staff and friends making significant contributions to Oregon and the nation.\n\n“I am really looking forward to connecting with my fellow UO grads and their families and friends,” she said. “I could not be more excited to share some words of wisdom and thoughts for their bright futures.”\n\nThe commencement celebration will begin at 9 a.m. Tuesday, June 20, in Autzen Stadium. Graduates who want to participate in the celebration must RSVP with their attendance and estimated number of guests.\n\nThis year’s main celebration will be livestreamed. To learn more about commencement, to find the link to watch the livestream, or to view information about the school and college ceremonies, visit the commencement website.\n\nUO employees interested in volunteering can sign up on the volunteer form."
