No Change.\n\nWe help communities, including the institutions that serve them, reshape how the criminal justice system works using high-quality data.\n\nOur work began back in 2011, and since then we’ve established ourselves as the leading experts in creating high-quality criminal justice data standards, developing comprehensive system-wide measures, building state-of-the-art data platforms, and engaging communities in data-driven change.\n\nToday, we engage with local communities—including prosecutors, courts, police, and the public—to make high-quality criminal justice data transparent and accessible, leading to greater system accountability.\n\nOur Solutions\n\nWhether your goal is to improve data, use data, or make data available to the public, we can help.\n\nNo matter where you are on your data journey, we will meet you right where you are.\n\nOur Commitment to High-Quality Data and Robust Standards\n\nOur approach to measuring the system in a transparent and accessible way is rooted first in using high-quality data for measurement and ensuring a standardized approach to that measurement.\n\nWe can’t accurately measure the system without first ensuring the data used is high-quality. To learn more about our approach to high-quality data, read what it means to us and explore how we established our measures.\n\nWe’re passionate about developing and sharing data standards and best practices for all facets of the criminal justice system. To learn more, check out how we help inform legislation, dive into our comprehensive assessments of current quality, and see how we’ve partnered with others to help create data standards.\n\nOur Story\n\nMeasures for Justice was founded in 2011 on the back of founder and CEO Amy Bach’s book, Ordinary Injustice: How America Holds Court. After spending years in courtrooms across the country, she realized that most people had no idea what was happening in their criminal justice system due to the lack of available data and transparency. Measures for Justice was created to solve that problem.\n\nToday, we’re the leading experts in creating high-quality criminal justice data standards, developing comprehensive system-wide measures, offering state-of-the-art data platforms, and engaging communities in data-driven change."
