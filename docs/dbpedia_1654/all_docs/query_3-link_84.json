        "text": "Preparing future innovators and thought leaders with state-of-the-art science communication and career development training.\n\nApply now for the 2024-25 Sustainability Leadership Fellows program!\n\nThe SoGES Sustainability Leadership Fellows program provides innovative training for early career scientists to effectively communicate science to the media and public, professional development skills and techniques, and strategies to build meaningful careers that incorporate engagement and interdisciplinarity. The competitive program accepts 20 advanced PhD students and postdoctoral scholars each year from across campus interested in communicating their sustainability-related research.\n\nEach cohort of Fellows begins the year with in an intensive two-day science communication workshop. During the academic year Fellows participate in six formal training sessions led by local and University experts on a range of topics including conflict management, interacting with policy-makers, data visualization, and time and workload optimization. Fellows also take part in additional skill building and networking opportunities throughout the year, including an evening with the University Provost. At the end of the program, Fellows are able to elegantly deconstruct, define, and communicate their research within the framework of broader global environmental sustainability challenges using cross-disciplinary and integrative thinking.\n\n\"I loved participating in the Sustainability Leadership Fellowship. I still regularly draw on the tools from the science communication training, and the time management training changed how I think about tracking my time – and how I advise my own students on how to do this! \"\n\n\"The SLF program has truly been transformative to my career. Now several years out from participating, I regularly engage with media, present to diverse general public audiences, provide feedback on policies, and manage a busy schedule. The SLF program gave me the tools to navigate and succeed in this work.\"\n\n\"The SoGES fellowship has instrumentally shaped my career trajectory by offering invaluable skills, knowledge, networking opportunities, and insightful perspectives as an early career researcher.\"\n\n\"My experience as an SLF helped me land my dream job working as a Scientist at a major environmental non-profit. I used the communication skills I learned as an SLF throughout the application and interview process, and I rely on the toolkit I developed during the SLF program every single day on the job. Being able to clearly communicate about not only my specific work, but also larger environmental issues and how everything fits together, has enabled me to do work that I absolutely love and to have a much bigger impact than I could’ve without those skills.\"\n\n\"The SoGES fellowship made me reflect on what my goals as a scientist were, which helped inform my transition out of an academic environment. I recently started a new job in the private sector as a Climate Change Analyst: I continue to do climate and sustainability science, but at a faster pace, on a larger team, and with a more applied focus. SoGES helped me realize I was looking to make this change, and provided me with tools and skills that have served me well in my new role.\"\n\n\"As I've been preparing for my defense, I've been using many of the skills I gained through the program. It was one of my favorite things about my experience at CSU and allowed me to meet many interesting and smart people, from different disciplines, who I would not have met otherwise.\"\n\n\"The program taught me to explore using accessible and inspiring language to communicate about complicated topics in science, including my own research.\"\n\n\"The SLF program adds a critical, but often missing, component to the toolkit for scientists. As graduate students, we receive vigorous training in the technical aspect of being researchers, but we rarely get taught how to communicate our science to the general public. The SLF experience fills this gap by offering valuable workshops led by subject matter experts. After completing my fellowship, I am confident that I can deliver an impactful and engaging account of my research to any type of audience.\"\n\n\"...this Fellowship truly stands out above all others because of the passion of our organizers. As a Fellow, I consistently felt that I was everyone's top priority; I knew that I could depend on any member of the SoGES team to provide me support and honest advice at a moment's notice. Thanks to each of you for making this such a rewarding and life-changing experience!\"\n\n\"This program has helped me learn how to better communicate with non-scientists so that they can understand my science and I can understand ways that it's important to their life.\"\n\n\"This program gave me the invaluable gift of clearly communicating my work and passion in a way that both scientific and non-scientific audiences can understand and appreciate. I am truly grateful to be a part of the SoGES Family\"\n\n\"The skills I gained during the program definitely helped in writing my proposal package. I also think that simply being a part of the program was a boon to my CV.\"\n\n\"The SoGES Sustainability Leadership Fellows program gave recognition and legitimacy to my work.\"\n\nPrevious\n\nNext\n\nTraining Program\n\nThe Sustainability Leadership Fellow training curriculum is a mix of workshops, trainings, networking, and professional development opportunities. Fellows are invited to participate in a large number of cross-campus public and private events with the School during their Fellowship year in addition to the regularly scheduled trainings.\n\nCore curriculum:\n\nScience Communication Workshop: A two-day intensive workshop at the beginning of the year led by Alda, science communication specialists. The workshop incorporates renowned journalist trainers that educate Fellows on effective science communication to media and the public, and to effectively address global sustainability challenges in a landscape of increasing digitization and information accessibility. At the end of the workshop, Fellows are able to elegantly deconstruct, define, and communicate their research within the framework of broader global environmental challenges using cross-disciplinary and integrative thinking.\n\nTraining sessions: During the year, Fellows attend six additional trainings with experts on a variety of career development and leadership topics, curated to be timely and relevant to the cohort, and can include: time management, storytelling, science and policy, online media, interviewing techniques, proposal and grant writing, talking science with skeptical audiences, data visualization, working on interdisciplinary teams, running effective meetings, and more.\n\nAdditional professional development: Fellows have additional professional development opportunities throughout the year, including a communication drill with the CSU Provost, and networking events with visiting scholars, past Fellows, and special guests.\n\nChristopher Joyce\n\nScience Correpondent, NPR\n\n“…I’ve been impressed by the scientific sophistication of the students and by their unmitigated enthusiasm for learning communication skills.\n\nI knew Diana Wall had an outstanding reputation as a scientist, but she also seems to have a knack for finding and motivating the sharpest young minds in the country.\n\nIf my own kids asked where they should go to become articulate environmental scientists, I’d send them to her.”\n\nProgram Application\n\nThe School opens an application for Sustainability Leadership Fellows each February with a March deadline for the following academic year. Applicants should be advanced PhD students or early career postdoctoral fellows at CSU conducting research relevant to sustainability science and with strong motivation to improve their communication and leadership skills. Join our mailing list to be notified when the application opens.\n\nSoGES co-leads ANGLES – a network of universities in the United States and Canada engaged in leadership development for graduate students in sustainability – whose mission is to grow the capacity for collective leadership and impact on sustainability by accelerating and improving leadership development in graduate education.
