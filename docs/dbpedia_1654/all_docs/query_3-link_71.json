        "text": "Our history:\n\nIn September 2015, Dr. Bert C. Bach requested a meeting with English professor and Poet-in-Residence, Dr. Jesse Graves to discuss what kinds of support would most benefit students of writing at ETSU. Planning for events began immediately, resulting in the very first Spring Literary Festival the following semester in April 2016. The program has hosted some remarkable events through the first six years of the program, most that we would never have dreamed of without the BCB Initiative. We hosted US Poet Laureate and Pulitzer Prize-winning Kingsport, TN native Charles Wright in October 2017; future US Poet Laureate Joy Harjo in April 2018; Jefferson Award-winning novelist Silas House in April 2019, along with many other celebrated authors in those early years. The BCB has hosted dozens of writers since 2016, with many hundreds of students and community members in attendance, and has developed meaningful partnerships with organizations on campus and beyond. What began with Dr. Bach's question, \"What do our writing students need?\" has resulted in several ongoing programs, such as the annual Spring Literary Festival, Fall Residency, and 3 Emerging Writers series, alongside new partnerships like the Black American Writers' Series, the Young Writers' Workshop, and a continuing TEDxETSU license for the Creative Writing Society."
