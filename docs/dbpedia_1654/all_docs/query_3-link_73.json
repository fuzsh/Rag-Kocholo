        "text": "Heather Wesp, M.S., began her career at Montcalm Community College in 2003 as a full-time biology instructor and has stayed in the position ever since.\n\nShe has taught a variety of biology courses including Biological Science, Anatomy and Physiology, College Biology II and Nature Study. Her current favorite class to teach is Environmental Science.\n\nHeather grew up in Michigan and enjoyed summer vacations at campgrounds all over the state. She attributes her love of science to those nature-filled family trips.\n\nShe earned a bachelor’s degree from Hope College in Holland, Mich., where she majored in biology and doubled minored in chemistry and German. She then completed a master’s degree at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Ariz., where she focused on animal behavior and morphology. Her college experiences helped her decide that teaching was the perfect way to combine interests in science and the desire to help others\n\nWhen Heather isn’t at work, she loves to spend time with her dogs, Callie and Lulu, and do just about any outdoor activity including hiking, biking, kayaking, camping and others. She also very much enjoys traveling and exploring the world – from the amazing beauty of Michigan’s Upper Peninsula to the grand national parks here in the U.S. to the thrilling novelty of places such as Australia and Africa.However, she also enjoys working in her yard and a quiet evening at home soaking in the beauty. Heather also volunteers with the Montcalm County Animal Shelter and has been a Big Sister (through Big Brothers Big Sisters) for more than 10 years.\n\nTore Skogseth, M.A. is a Student Success Counselor at Montcalm Community College.\n\nHailing from the foothills of the Norwegian mountains, this thunderous bearded Norwegian left the fjords of Norway for the cornfields of Michigan (following a brief interlude between soybean fields and refineries in Southern Illinois). When he packed his suitcase for his big move, it was filled with CDs, with just a few clothes used as padding... In a life filled with detours, he finally found his destination here at Montcalm Community College, where he started as a Student Services Assistant in 2001 and returned as a counselor in 2010. In between these stints at MCC, he also spent time at Alma College and GRCC, but it is here, in the middle of nowhere, MI, he now feels at home.In an educational career marked by false starts, he still considers his greatest accomplishment to be his Associate in Arts, which he earned at Lincoln Trail College in Robinson, IL, in 2001. He earned both his Bachelor of Arts in Family Life Education in 2004 and his Master of Arts in Counseling in 2007 from Spring Arbor University. He is a Licensed Professional Counselor in the State of Michigan and has worked as a counselor at MCC since 2010. His love for music is one of his major driving forces. He has an eclectic taste – his music collection keeps growing – but if you ask him, there never was (and never will be) a band greater than The Beatles. He does feel a similar reverence to Motorpsycho, his hometown heroes from Trondheim, Norway, who combine the power of hard rock with the improvisational nature of jazz creating new uncharted territories, yet relying more on psychedelia and old school heavy metal than the traditional jam bands. His top five list of bands and artists are rounded out by David Bowie, Rush, and Opeth, with King Crimson and Steven Wilson/Porcupine Tree bubbling right underneath the surface (ask him tomorrow, and he may have a very different answer).When the urges overcome him, he can be found noodling on one of his guitars or his keyboard – or exploring one of his music authoring apps on his iPad. His favorite meditative state is going full-on zen with a LEGO set, completely tuning everything else out to focus on the bricks in front of him. He also makes a point to solve the New York Times daily crossword puzzle every day.He also loves reading and movies, and if he feels extra social, you might find him playing card and board games. He is also starting to own up to being an avid TTRPGer in the past. While he hasn’t picked that back up yet, you should never say never – if you feel adventurous, ask him if he still can hear the Call of Cthulhu …\n\nBill Bishop, M.B.A., came to Montcalm Community College as an adjunct instructor in 2004 and joined the faculty full-time as a Business Instructor in 2013.\n\nBill truly loves being part of this institution. He especially enjoys staying connected with former students, hearing about their successes, and witnessing personal growth and development in rewarding careers cultivated during their studies at MCC. His areas of instruction include Accounting, Taxation, Business and Management. Bill serves as the Department Chair of MCC’s Accounting, Business, and Criminal Justice Studies, and is the co-advisor of the college’s Business Professionals of America (BPA) Club.\n\nHaving lived in West Michigan his entire life, he received his Bachelor of Science in Business Administration - majoring in Accounting and Business Administration - from Aquinas College and a Master’s in Business Administration (MBA) from Ferris State University. Prior to joining MCC, Bill worked for more than 25 years with a variety of companies in Michigan, Indiana and Ohio as a consultant, controller and Chief Financial Officer.\n\nBill and his wife have three sons, six grandsons and four granddaughters. Activities he enjoys include hunting, gardening, reading and playing bass guitar. However, those activities pale to his favorite joy of fishing, and it does not matter the location. He is equally at home on the many small local lakes, wading a trout stream, or making an off-shore run to Lake Michigan or Saginaw Bay for the best that Michigan has to offer.\n\nAmy Zdanowski, M.A., joined Montcalm Community College in 2018 as the college’s Career Advisor. Driven by a genuine desire to make a difference, Amy finds immense joy in helping individuals define their interests, explore opportunities, and ultimately pursue their dreams.\n\nEarning a Bachelor of Arts in Criminal Justice from Saginaw Valley State University propelled Amy into her first professional job working with youth. Building upon this foundation, she pursued a Master of Arts in Professional and School Counseling from Central Michigan University. In turn, Amy brings 21 years of school counseling experience to her role as MCC’s Career Advisor.\n\nAmy’s dedication to her profession extends beyond her daily responsibilities, as she actively contributes to the field through her involvement in professional organizations. Serving on the board of the Michigan Career Development Association and the National Career Development Association’s Global Connections Committee, Amy remains at the forefront of career advising trends and innovations.\n\nIn addition to her role at MCC, Amy is a newly published author of a book designed to help parents kick-start their teen’s career exploration journey, further solidifying her dedication to enhancing career development resources and strategies.\n\nAmy’s enthusiasm, coupled with her wealth of experience and expertise, makes her an asset to MCC’s community and beyond.\n\nSara Rittersdorf, M.A., is a full-time Chemistry Instructor at Montcalm Community College. She first came to the college as a dual-enrolled high school student and found her way back here several times for part-time jobs throughout her college years.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, she received her Bachelor of Science in Chemistry, a Minor in Math and a Secondary Education Teaching Certificate from Michigan Technological University. She went on to earn a Master of Arts in Science Education from Western Michigan University and a Master of Science in Applied Statistics from Michigan Technological University.\n\nBefore joining MCC full-time in August 2021, she spent 11 years working in the K-12 school systems primarily as a math teacher, but she also taught chemistry. During her first two years as an educator, she worked in Arizona. She especially loved this time in her life because she was a quick drive to Las Vegas or the Grand Canyon and could visit on a whim.\n\nSara has been married to her husband, Ryan, since 2011. They have four children together: Addison, Miles, Elliot and Amelia. They also have a house full of pets including three dogs, one bunny and two cats. She loves to spend time with her family touching base about their day, watching “Lego Masters,” doing puzzles, or playing “Ticket to Ride” with them.\n\nWhen asked who she admires most, Sara said her parents. She said they have always worked hard for what they have and live a simple life keeping their focus on family.\n\n“I want to foster an environment where the students trust me to guide them in their knowledge and skill development in becoming successful maternity and pediatric nurses,” shared Nicole Kalinowski, RN who joined Montcalm Community College in August as a full-time Nursing and Allied Health instructor.\n\nWith 14 years of RN experience, Kalinowski holds the knowledge and hands-on expertise to successfully guide students in the field of nursing. She knows firsthand the challenges of being a nursing student in a rigorous program, stating that it took discipline, determination and dedication to make it through.\n\nA graduate of Rockford Public Schools, Kalinowski earned her Associate of Science degree from Grand Rapids Community College, and both her Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Nursing degrees from Grand Valley State University (GVSU). Finally, she earned her Master of Science in Nursing from Michigan State University with an advanced practice degree as a Clinical Nurse Specialist with an education emphasis.\n\nFortunate that she chose this path of nursing, Kalinowski has been able to work in various roles in the field, including serving as a bedside RN for adults and pediatrics, working in emergency medicine, and working as a nursing supervisor, an advanced practice RN and clinical nurse specialist, and now a nursing instructor.\n\nBesides teaching at MCC, Kalinowski has taught at Grand Rapids Community College, leading nursing students in clinicals. She knew, even growing up, that she always wanted to be a teacher, but instruction has also had its challenges.\n\n“As an instructor, you put a lot of pressure on yourself to make sure your students are going to be successful and safe nurses,” Kalinowski said. “You want your students to learn and do well, but you can only bring them so far, and then the rest is up to them.”\n\nAn active mother residing in Cedar Springs, Kalinowski has worked for Corewell Health (formerly Spectrum Health) for more than 20 years, having served in leadership and currently serving as a clinical nurse specialist in a pediatric emergency department. As a college student, Kalinowski had the realization that the best nurses were the ones who were the best teachers for their patients.\n\nEven with the challenges that come with working in various roles in the field of health care and nursing, Kalinowski said it has all been worth it because nursing is a rewarding career.\n\n“You are always learning, you are challenged daily, and you literally make a significant impact on the lives of the patients you care for and the community you serve. You’ll never feel a greater sense of appreciation than you do as a nurse.”\n\nMichelle Gibson, Ph.D., is a full-time Biology Instructor at Montcalm Community College since 1999. Michelle thoroughly enjoys her position. “I like to make science fun and understandable,” she says. A pet peeve of hers, however, is when a student asks if she’s going to talk about “anything important” during an upcoming lecture. Michelle asserts that nothing unimportant would be worth lecturing about.Michelle graduated from Northern Michigan University with a Bachelor of Science in microbiology with minors in chemistry and physics. She went on to receive a Master of Science then a Ph.D. from Michigan State University, both in Animal Science.Michelle grew up on a farm with her three brothers, her sister, and her parents. She remains close with her family and spends much of her free time with them. The people Michelle admires most in the world are her parents, remembering how hard they worked for the sake of her and her siblings.Next to her family, Michelle spends time with her livestock and pets, claiming to have owned just about everything except a horse. She also enjoys gardening, reading, completing puzzles and riding her bike. A few of Michelle’s favorites are the Christmas movie “Love Actually”, ice cream, and the song “When You Say Nothing At All” by Ronan Keating. A bucket list item for her is to shake the hand of a president. Her life motto is, “be kind.”Michelle shares some facts about herself:\n\nI have a Korean sister and a Vietnamese brother.\n\nI can dress out chickens, dissect anything including cadavers and shovel any kind of manure out there, but can't kill an animal.\n\nI believe that Mother Nature will always, always win.\n\nI can't sing, but I really wish I could.\n\nTricia Yonker, B.A., is an Early College math instructor at Montcalm Community College.\n\nShe found out about the Early College Algebra 2 position while attending a professional development course at the Ionia County Intermediate School District with Dean Gage, who teaches economics, government and political science in the Early College program. When she started at MCC in August 2014, she taught both sections of Algebra 2 and both sections of science. She now teaches both sections of Algebra 2 and fulfills some administrative duties.\n\nThe skills she brings to her job are attention to detail and organization, anticipation of student needs and gaps in learning.\n\nYonker continued her higher education at Cornerstone University, Rochester College, Madonna University and Calvin College. She graduated Summa Cum Laude from Cornerstone University in May 2004 with a Bachelor of Arts in Secondary Education with a major in Mathematics and minor in General Science.\n\nHer teaching career started at Barry County Christian School in Hastings, in August, 2004, where she taught all of the secondary sciences and Algebra 1 through pre-calculus until May 2011.

Zach attended MCC’s Early College program and now attends GVSU. Tori and Titus attend Saranac Community Schools.\n\nYonker enjoys spending time with her family and attending her children’s sporting events. She also loves to garden and spend time outside.\n\nThe person she admires most is her mom.\n\n“Even with all the physical difficulties that came with being a paraplegic, she was often full of joy,” Yonker said.\n\nOne day she would love to visit the Grand Canyon and Zion National Park.\n\nHere are some of fun facts about Tricia:\n\nShe was seven when her mom became a paraplegic.\n\nShe graduated fourth in her class and valedictorian from Saranac High School.\n\nShe attended five schools in the process of earning her bachelor’s degree.\n\nShe chose some unusual classes for her General Science minor: ornithology, geology, environmental science, and astronomy.\n\nHer favorite place to visit in the state of Michigan is Mackinac Island.\n\nAndrew Nielsen, B.A. is an advanced manufacturing and welding technologies instructor at Montcalm Community College.\n\n“I am a huge believer in see one, do one, and teach one,” Nielsen said. “I like to teach the theory of what we are going to accomplish in the lab, head to the lab, show the students how to accomplish the task and then let them try it, let them fail, but fail forward. I believe you learn more from failure than success.”\n\nHe graduated from Belding High School in 2003. After graduation, he attended Olivet College where he played football and baseball and earned his Bachelor of Arts in Management in 2008. After that, he spent five years in the North Dakota oil fields. He decided he wanted to return home and study metal fabrication.\n\nThrough an apprenticeship with Greenville Tool and Die, he started his journeyman certification courses at MCC in 2017. Nielsen earned an Apprenticeship Training Certificate in welding from MCC in 2020, with high honors, and now teaches welding, machining and automation classes on MCC’s Greenville campus. He is also an AWS Certified Welding Inspector.\n\n“I really enjoy the ‘a ha’ moments that you see in students as they are practicing through the modules, and suddenly, something clicks, and they are creating desired results,” Nielsen said.\n\nAside from his work at MCC and the North Dakota oil fields, he also worked in grounds maintenance at Candlestone Inn & Golf in Belding and at the Double R Ranch in Smyrna doing horse trail guides, campground maintenance, canoe running and golf course maintenance.\n\nHe and his wife, Bridget, have been married for almost seven years and reside in Rockford. They have two sons, Lincoln and Roman. He likes to travel around Michigan and the United States, mostly hiking trails through mountain ranges. He can’t wait until his children are old enough to ride motorcycles and ATVs around Michigan’s awesome trails.\n\nJason Becker and Jody Collier are two people he admires. Both gentlemen have worked hard in their trade and are now valuable resources of information on YouTube and podcasts. They are both lifelong learners and give back to the welding community by freely sharing their knowledge.\n\nIf he hadn’t gone into teaching, Nielsen said he was close to becoming a heavy machine operator. He said it would be awesome to drive bulldozers, front end loaders and cranes.\n\nNielsen feels that his work ethic and integrity are the best skills he brings to his job.\n\n“I show up, do what I say I’m going to do, (or at least give it my best shot) and try to learn something from the task,” he said.\n\nVisiting Alaska and driving a monster truck are two things on his bucket list, and he said doing both at the same time would be ideal.\n\nHis personal motto is “Stuff happens. Deal with it and try to find the best way to overcome it.”\n\nHere are some other fun facts about Nielsen:\n\nHe holds a couple of top five individual rushing records at Olivet College.\n\nHe is left-handed.\n\nMinus 56 degrees Fahrenheit is the coldest weather he has been in.\n\nHe used to lead horse trail guides at Double R Ranch.\n\nThe most hours he has worked in a week is 140.\n\nDebbie Dawson-Gunther, P.E., M.S. MCC Automation & Industrial Technology Instructor maintains high standards for her students.\n\nDebbie Dawson-Gunther, P.E., M.S., enjoys “watching the light bulb go on” when her students understand a new concept.\n\nDawson-Gunther joined Montcalm Community College’s full-time faculty as its Automation & Industrial Technology Instructor in January 2019, after teaching as a part-time instructor at the college. Since then, she has revised automation curriculum while teaching automation classes and works in the skilled trades open lab on MCC’s Greenville campus. She also continues to revise technical programs to provide students with opportunities to earn industry credentials including Smart Automation Certification Alliance (SACA), American Welding Society (AWS), and National Institute for Metalworking Skills (NIMS).\n\n“An educator is responsible for creating an environment that is conducive to learning – a place where students are able to turn ideas, theories and concepts into practical skills,” Dawson-Gunther said. “In the technical arena, this environment must also provide students with foundational knowledge and the desire for lifelong learning in order to meet the changing needs in industry.”\n\nWith nearly 30 years of industry and teaching experience, Dawson-Gunther said she has had the unique opportunity to contribute to the shaping of society and the future.\n\n“As a professional engineer, I place an emphasis on my own professional development allowing me to enhance curriculum and provide service with the most relevant industry knowledge possible,” she said. “As an educator, I have developed and delivered relevant programs to meet both student and industry needs.\n\n“I maintain high standards for my students,” she said. “It is important that I help them learn how to learn, how to effectively solve problems and how to judge the long-range impact of their solutions and recommendations on society.\n\n“I challenge them in ways that will benefit them and provide a sense of accomplishment,” she added.\n\nSyreeta Drake M.S.N., is a full-time nursing & health careers instructors at Montcalm Community College.\n\n“Culminating the art of care and compassion thru the synergy of mind, body, and spirit” is Syreeta Drake’s nursing philosophy. Becoming newly tenured in January as a full-time nursing instructor at Montcalm Community College, Drake added that, “Skills can be taught, but caring and compassion, not so much.”\n\nThis is why Drake’s focus as an instructor is making sure her students can put into practice and apply what they learn, giving them a certain foundational knowledge to succeed.\n\nBeginning as an adjunct instructor in 2019, and then becoming a part of the full-time Nursing Faculty later that year, Drake said that she “took the scenic route” when referencing her own educational journey.\n\nDrake said she always wanted to teach, but it was after caring for her late mother through a traumatic experience and witnessing other nurses in action that she decided to pursue an education in nursing.\n\nShe enrolled in and completed the LPN program at Grand Rapids Community College (GRCC), and after six years working as an LPN, she returned to school to complete her Associate of Nursing degree. While continuing to work, she went on to complete an online Bachelor of Nursing degree at Western Governors University, as well as a Master of Science in Nursing Education.\n\nIt was at this point that Drake realized the significance and impact that nurses have in teaching, which became her focus.\n\n“Particularly in something like nursing, you can give people the benefit of all your wisdom, if they’re willing to listen and they’re not too hung up on who the information is coming from,” she said. “You can really impact lives.”\n\nDrake said she appreciates the culture at MCC where she has close relationships with her students and is able to support their learning needs.\n\nThe married mother of a son and daughter, Drake feels it is rewarding to see the “light bulbs” come on in her students after they have been challenged and she has helped them to translate knowledge into critical thinking and safe application that creates a competent and compassionate nurse.\n\nCurrently pursuing a post-Master’s certificate program in psychiatric nursing, Drake encourages those considering nursing to remember that they already have two precious resources to succeed – time and energy.\n\nDrake encourages students not to get discouraged by wait lists for nursing programs, and advises those interested in the field to always be in nurse mode, assessing situations and environments they are in and getting in the mindset and thought process of being a nurse.\n\nAn active member of several nursing organizations, including the Grand Rapids Black Nurses Association and the American Psychiatric Nurses Association, Drake is also an esthetician and a published author, working on her second book.\n\nWearing many hats, Drake continues to show compassion to those she reaches and instill a sense of compassion in those that she teaches.\n\nAs a mathematics instructor at Montcalm Community College, Brianne Lodholtz, M.A., focuses on helping her students build a strong foundation for success.\n\n“Montcalm Community College is a wonderful community-centered college,” Lodholtz said. “I love the small size and the personal attention that I can give to my students. Many struggle with math and I am able to work with them at a beginning level to set a good foundation for them to move on.”\n\nShe brings compassion and the ability to mathematically reach students at whatever level they are at so they can succeed.\n\nLodholtz has a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics and a Master of Arts degree, both from Grand Valley State University. She has also completed additional coursework at Central Michigan University and Clemson University.\n\nShe is married with two children – a daughter who is 12, and a son who is 7. She also has two chugs (chihuahua pug mixes) named Tank and Diesel.\n\nHer family is greatly invested in archery. She shoots a recurve bow. She also enjoys traveling with her family and hanging out with friends. Her family once traveled to Yellowstone and saw a lot of wildlife, including bears and moose. Traveling to Europe with her family is on her bucket list.\n\nHer personal motto is: “Treat others the way you want to be treated.”\n\nHere are some other fun facts about Brianne:\n\nShe has a cycle endorsement.\n\nShe has won eating contests.\n\nShe sometimes cries when she laughs.\n\nHer favorite movie is “Tommy Boy.”\n\nIf she wasn’t a math teacher, she would want to be a geneticist.\n\nDean Gage, M.Ed., is an Early College instructor at Montcalm Community College who teaches economics, government and political science.\n\n“What is most fulfilling for me is to see students learning new things and watching them develop a thirst for lifelong learning,” he said. “I also enjoy helping students and watching them become better citizens.”\n\nGage was born and raised in Saranac and graduated from high school there. He has a Bachelor of Science degree in Public Administration, Social Studies and Business Education with secondary certification from Grand Valley State University. He also has a Master’s in Education from Ferris State University.\n\nGage and his wife, Julie, have been married for 27 years. They have three grown children - Alicia, Jacob and Sydney; and three grandchildren - Huxley, Kade and Kinsley. They also have a dog named Sunny.\n\nGage and his family enjoy camping at their seasonal lot at Coldwater Lake near Mt. Pleasant. They call their camper a rolling cottage. Gage also enjoys golfing, fishing, hiking, reading, cruising around in his boat and playing basketball.\n\nThe person he admires most is MCC Emeritus Dean of Arts and Humanities Dr. Gary Hauck, who still teaches a variety of credit and noncredit courses at MCC.\n\n“He has been an incredible inspiration to me and has encouraged me to be the best person and teacher I can be,” Gage said. “He has done so much in terms of motivating me in my continual quest to grow and learn.”\n\nGage believes his patience and his adaptability are the best skills he brings to his job.\n\n“I also allow my students to have their own voice,” he said. “My students are not going to think like me most of the time and I need to allow them to build upon their own values and beliefs rather than influence them to take my point of view.”\n\nSomeday he would like to visit the Holy Land. He would like to explore the roots of his faith and the locations where events in Scripture took place.\n\nHere are some other fun facts about Dean:\n\nHe has coached basketball for 24 years and currently coaches boys’ varsity basketball for Saranac.\n\nHis first teaching job was teaching construction.\n\nHe touched the shoulder of Magic Johnson as he was walking through the State Capitol.\n\nHe sang in the choir that performed in the 1982 Lowell Showboat with quest star Pearl Bailey.\n\nHe plays the drums.\n\nKristen Diehl, M.Ed., is Montcalm Community College’s Computer Information Systems Lab Coordinator and also teaches within our business and computer departments, starting with MCC in 2006. She serves as the Computer Science Department Chair and the Co-Chair of the Assessment committee. She holds a Bachelor of Science in Small Business Management from Ferris State University, a Master’s in Education from Aquinas College and has MBA coursework completed with Walsh Collage. “I bring over 10 years of work experience in the automotive industry with me to my position at MCC,” Diehl said. “This experience, coupled with my educational background, allows me to present material in engaging and effective ways.” Diehl married her husband, Vern, in 2011. Their blended family of five children (one boy and four girls) range in age from 13-26. They also had their first grandchild, a girl, born in 2020. In her free times she loves spending time with her family - traveling, playing games, attending sporting events. When asked what are her pet peeves she said, “When first annual is used instead of inaugural. When people don't follow proper performance etiquette at formal events (music and theatre performances, etc.).” Kristen’s motto is, “If you care about an outcome, get involved with the decision-making process.
