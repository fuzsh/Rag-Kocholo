        "text": "Editor’s note, February 2024: In the two and a half years since Rolling Stone rolled out the all-new, fully revamped version of our 500 Greatest Songs list in September 2021, artists like Beyonce, Lana Del Rey, and Taylor Swift have all released classic tracks. So we’ve updated the list. We kept the update light; the 2021 list covered many decades of popular music, and was the result of a vote among more than 300 artists, writers, producers and industry figures; this update covers three years, from 2021 to early 2024.\n\nIn 2004, Rolling Stone published its list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. It’s one of the most widely read stories in our history, viewed hundreds of millions of times on this site. But a lot has changed since 2004; back then the iPod was relatively new, and Billie Eilish was three years old. So we’ve decided to give the list a total reboot. To create the new version of the RS 500 we convened a poll of more than 250 artists, musicians, and producers — from Angelique Kidjo to Zedd, Sam Smith to Megan Thee Stallion, M. Ward to Bill Ward — as well as figures from the music industry and leading critics and journalists. They each sent in a ranked list of their top 50 songs, and we tabulated the results.\n\nNearly 4,000 songs received votes. Where the 2004 version of the list was dominated by early rock and soul, the new edition contains more hip-hop, modern country, indie rock, Latin pop, reggae, and R&B. More than half the songs here weren’t present on the old list, including a third of the Top 100. The result is a more expansive, inclusive vision of pop, music that keeps rewriting its history with every beat."
