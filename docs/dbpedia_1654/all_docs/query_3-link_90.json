        "text": "VALERIE COLEMAN\n\n​\n\nCAREER ASSESSMENT\n\n​\n\nMy path as a performing artist, composer and entrepreneur is a growing legacy that has a global reach and the potential to create an historic impact within the music of this era. It is fueled by an engine of dedication and tireless work in not only building one of the premiere ensembles in the world, Imani Winds, but in the body of works born from the combined disciplines of performance and composition. Along the way, noteworthy milestones have been accomplished, from a Grammy nomination for Imani Winds’ debut album, Classical Underground, featuring a few works from my pen that are currently in radio rotation nationally, to being honored in an exhibit within the Classical music section of the Smithsonian African American History Museum in Washington, D.C. New milestones have marked the second phase of my career after retiring from my ensemble, including being listed as “One of the Top 35 Women Composers” by the Washington Post, and the “2020 Classical Woman of the Year” by American Public Radio’s Performance Today radio series. I am honored to be the first African American woman to be commissioned by the Philadelphia Orchestra, and also the first for The Metropolitan Opera.\n\nMy career in performance began in earnest with the genesis of Imani Winds in 1997. I was a graduate student at Mannes College of Music at New School University and was firmly on the path of an orchestral career from studies with Doriot Anthony Dwyer, Principal Flutist of the Boston Symphony, Leone Buyse, Associate Principal of the Boston Symphony, Judith Mendenhall, Mark Sparks former flutist of the Baltimore Symphony, and Julius Baker, retired Principal of the New York Philharmonic. When I arrived in New York to begin graduate studies, I paid the rent by coordinating kid’s birthday parties at the 63rd street YMCA and generating a meager income as a freelance musician who was new to the scene. The inspired concept and name of \"Imani Winds” came to me during that time and gave courage to seek out others to form an intercollegiate chamber music ensemble.\n\nThe vision I offered to them was (and is) to share our diverse cultural experiences through musical interpretations, represent performance excellence in diversity, become role models for younger generations, and advocate for composers of color. In search of founding members, I was delighted to reconnect with clarinetist Mariam Adam, an old friend whom I met while studying at Aspen Music Festival’s orchestral program in 1995. We both had shared a love for chamber music, as did the other future members of Imani Winds who were students at Manhattan School of Music and The Juilliard School.\n\nRecognizing the ensemble needed momentum and cohesion, I began a chamber music concert series at The Good Shepherd Church in the Lincoln Center area. Between efforts of handing out flyers on the corner of 69th street and Broadway before every concert, making blind phone calls to management, setting up booths at arts presenting conferences with freshly baked brownies, visiting churches throughout Harlem, and Upper West Side on Sundays to make announcements and building a snail-mailing list, the series went from an attendance of 5 people to 150 within the year. That year of hustle proved pivotal as hard work become the glue that brought the group together and kept it together. Our performance repertoire increased as did our ability to connect beyond the stage, and we gained a devoted following of music lovers who were also sympathetic to hard working underdogs. Today, my experiences and unorthodox methods in building a world class ensemble inform my teaching philosophy as both performer and composer. I believe in the critical values of time investment and empathy as necessity for building excellence in musicianship. I know firsthand that a sustainable career comes from the grit of being hungry enough to create your own opportunities, creative ingenuity leads to effective marketing, sacrificing comfort zones leads to possibilities, and exploration can cultivate a definitive repertoire base for which you are known.\n\nAlthough I did not consider myself to be a composer back then and for many years to come, it was the original works from my pen and that of horn player Jeffrey Scott that created distinction from other woodwind quintet groups and would define the ensemble’s voice for 21 years. The determination to achieve a high level of performing and going beyond the stigma of inherent bias drove the ensemble to an intensely dedicated rehearsal schedule. To measure progress, we entered competitions to get a realistic view of standing, while rehearsing became a near full-time job. The result was winning competitions like Concert Artists Guild, Artists International, and The Bowers Program, a young artist residency at Chamber music Society of Lincoln Center (CMSLC), formerly known as CMS Two. There were a few solo and chamber competitions that yielded career milestones regardless of close outcome, such as reaching the semi-finals of the Jean-Pierre Rampal International Flute Competition in Paris, and Fischoff National Competition of South Bend, Indiana. The latter two led to recurrent residency engagements over the span of five years and garnered a favorable first real review from a major news source, the Los Angeles Times (https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2005-apr-19-et-imani19-story.html).\n\nAs a Bowers Program fellow, Lincoln Center became a second home to me, I am grateful that CMSLC members Bruce Adolphe and clarinetist David Shifrin became mentors who introduced me to the possibility of artistic directorships with a chamber music society from both the curative standpoint of both performer and composer. I became a teaching artist for Lincoln Center, in residence with the public school system in New York City, while being on the faculty of The Juilliard School’s Preparatory division, instructing young musicians of African and LatinX heritages through their Music Advancement Program. It was during that time that I began to build a close relationship with the Carnegie Hall organization through Classical Connections, a young artists fellowship from the Association of Performing Arts Professionals (APAP). My group auditioned and joined the “Neighborhood Concerts” roster, where we cut our teeth in learning stage communication by providing regular performances in Carnegie’s Weill Concert Hall and Zankel Hall, as well as in communities throughout New York City’s 5-borough region. I would later serve on the APAP Classical Connections advisory board from 2013 – 2015. Other board service during that time included National Flute Association (NFA) convention chair selection committee , NFA New Music Advisory (2012-2015), Composers Now (2016 – current), Composers Concordance, and others.\n\nThe art of chamber music performance and its many facets have been a passion and way of life for me for over two decades, and it is a remarkable blessing to be able to explore the concepts of building a legacy of repertoire. To celebrate Imani Winds’ tenth anniversary, I created the Legacy Commissioning Project, designed to build a base of modern repertoire that is inclusive of underrepresented composers and their cultural standpoint. The project continues to this day and has engaged composers of Classical, World, and Jazz genres, including Wayne Shorter, Stefon Harris, Jason Moran, Paquito D’Rivera, Henry Threadgill, Courtney Bryan, Reena Esmail, Jessie Montgomery, Palestinian composer Simon Shaheen, and many others.\n\nThrough the support of competitions and orchestras like Hartford Symphony, Orchestra 2001, Interlochen Symphony Orchestra, and the Notre Dame Symphony Orchestra, I was fortunate to have the opportunity to compose and perform in my first concerto for wind quintet and orchestra to modest acclaim. Touring an average of 250 days (about 8 months) a year within a full-time chamber ensemble left room for little else, but somehow glimpses of sunlight shone through, outlining the potential of solo work as a hybrid artist. That spark initially came through in receiving the Edward and Sally van Lier Fellowship Award, housed by an organization now known as New Music USA, (formerly known as “Meet the Composer”). The award made possible my Carnegie Hall debut as a hybrid artist, a performance that featured both solo and chamber works from my pen. A diverse body awards and nominations came along the way like MAP Fund award, Academy of Arts and Letters, and ASCAP Award for ensembles, alongside successes in grant writing. My first grant as a commissioner was awarded from Mary Flagler Cary Trust, to commission Jazz pianist Jason Moran to create a new work. The Flutist Quarterly published a feature on my career as a flutist and member of Imani Winds. Meanwhile, Imani Winds steamrolled full speed ahead with touring, conducting both individual and ensemble clinician activities, masterclasses, and performance lectures within 49 states and 4 continents. These activities were the main vehicle for my teaching development, but I discovered there was never enough time to share a deeper foundation to students who sought us out, so I took a leap of faith and created the Imani Winds Chamber Music Festival in 2010.\n\nFor the first 3 years, the festival was housed at the Juilliard School and CMS Lincoln Center. Year by year, the number of applicants increased as I maintained both flute and composition studios. Within its early years, the festival infrastructure and expenses, including guest artist fees, marketing, and scholarship support, were well sustained with a business model that was solely reliant on a tuition-based revenue. There were 80 applicants recruited from touring and 55 accepted in the first year.\n\nBy the third year, our number of applicants increased to 160 and out of that, 72 were accepted. Applicants to my flute studio represented\n\nroughly one third of all applicants each year. The studio maintained 14-18 flutists. Most paid full tuition. By the fifth year, the number of applicants was just shy of 200, consistently representing over 100 music institutions from around the world, with strong, consistent representation from the top music schools like Frost School of Music, Eastman, Peabody, Cincinnati Conservatory, The Juilliard School, Curtis Institute, Cleveland Institute, Oberlin, Conservatorio de Música de Puerto Rico, Mannes, and Manhattan School of Music. There was international representation from the Cairo Conservatory, Conservatoire Nationale Superior of Beirut, and McGill University. Woodwind musicians from the armed forces, mostly Air Force and Army were among our recurrent constituency, as were Frost School of Music’s own Stamps Woodwind Quintets, both classes of 2015 and 2019. I was grateful to have worked directly with Juilliard School’s admissions staff to develop the festival in partnership with the institution, but by year four, the success of the program and the near 40% diversity applicant pool and enrolled constituency of African diaspora/LatinX students drew attention from other conservatories like Oberlin, Mannes, and Manhattan School of Music, who generously offered to house IWCMF. In year four, the festival moved downtown to Mannes and has been housed there ever since.\n\nA respectable number of successful alumni have come through IWCMF, several of whom created their own summer festivals and arts engines, such as flutist Julia Barnett of the American Prize Finalists Duos Flautas Frescas, Chamber Music America grantee Adelante Winds, flutists Darwin Cosme, Shia Cardona and Flor Cruz Longoria - the founders of the Puerto Rico Flute Symposium, Tyler Austin - founder of the Maryland Wind Symposium, Alex Weiser of Kettle Corn Music, and Adrienne Baker, flutist and co-creator of Castle of Our Skins. Others have enjoyed orchestral careers like Francisco Joubert of the Louisville Orchestra, and Alex Davis of Detroit Symphony Orchestra, careers in academia like Emlyn Johnson, Professor of Flute at Missouri State University, Brian Allred - Assistant Professor of Flute at University of Wisconsin – Eau Clair, and Matthew Taylor, Assistant Professor of Composition at Middlebury College, and careers in touring like Guy Mintus, composer, and jazz pianist. IWCMF alumni have all kept close contact with one throughout the years, creating a network of support to one another. Now going on its eleventh season, my brainchild of IWCMF was and continues to be one of my most gratifying conceptions.\n\nWithin the second decade of the millennium, I had built a successful community flute studio in Washington Heights, with a yearly enrollment average of 12 post graduate aspiring professionals and hobbyists. In 2017, I created a community chamber music program of post-graduate IWCMF alums, musical theatre composers, and public-school band teachers, while providing flute instruction for Ithaca College through its NY Immersion Program. The University of Chicago had employed me and my colleagues for two years as visiting professors from 2016-2018, and I immensely enjoyed providing flute instruction to non-music majors and working regularly with composition students under the leadership of Augusta Reade Thomas. The queue of commissions began to grow, as well as a steady stream of invites to be the featured guest artist and clinician for flute festivals and collegiate flute studios around the country, where I would perform solo recitals of my works, give masterclasses on standard flute repertoire, and adjudicate young artist competitions. My early guest artist invitations came from the Mid-Atlantic Flute Fair, New Jersey Flute Fair, Kentucky Flute Festival, Ohio State University, University of South Carolina, Virginia Polytechnic Institute, and Texas Women’s University, the latter of whom did a tribute concert of my works as a part of the visit, which became a regular theme in touring as a soloist and in Imani Winds. In 2016, my group had the honor of premiering Lansing McCloskey’s Hardwood for wind quintet, a work that was commissioned by The National Flute Association at the Las Vegas convention. By that point, Imani Winds had recorded five albums, and I was also fortunate to perform on several albums by jazz artists, Chick Corea, Wayne Shorter, Steve Coleman, Edward Simon, and the Brubeck Brothers.\n\nIn spring of 2018 (after 21 years), a realization came that it was time to fly from the nest I had created. It was a risk as there was uncertainty of fiscal sustenance. The opportunity to reshape my career seemed daunting, but little did I know that the decision to retire from Imani would create an explosive upward trajectory, starting with the honor of becoming a faculty member of the Frost School of Music at the University of Miami. While going through the process of onboarding for my new faculty position at the Frost School of Music, I had the honor of being heavily featured at the 2018 National Flute Association’s convention in Orlando.\n\nAlong with being a featured gala artist, I performed my Requiem Milonga on the Healing and Remembrance Concert, gave a presentation and performed my Wish Sonatine for high school students through the diversity committee, performed Janice Misurell’s Sometimes the City is Silent on the New Music Advisory concert, participated in a panel on motherhood for musicians, and served on the adjudication panel for the Annual High School Competition. The finalists premiered my new work commissioned by the NFA, called Fanmi Imen, which I later performed in the Friday night gala concert.\n\nJust a few months later my new concerto for wind quintet and orchestra was set to premiere at Carnegie Hall on November 2nd, 2018 with American Composers Orchestra. Representing the first of two commissions from the Carnegie Hall organization that semester, Phenomenal Women was written for Imani Winds and was inspired by iconic women: Maya Angelou, Olympic Gold medalist from Flint, Michigan Claressa Shields, Michelle Obama, mathematician Catherine Johnson, and Serena Williams. I had dreamt of creating and performing it prior to making the decision to retire, so it was bittersweet to see the work find its own success without having performed in it but made all the sweeter as my 5-year-old daughter was able to sit quietly in the audience watching a concert for once, because her mother sat next to her instead of on the stage! It received a successful review from The New York Times, and subsequent programming by Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, and Albany Symphony. The Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. then decided to commission an orchestral-only adaptation of it for Orpheus Chamber Orchestra, which premiered at the historical venue later in the season on June 1, 2019.\n\nTwo weeks after the premiere of Phenomenal Women, I was fortunate to return to Carnegie Hall for the premiere of the second commission. Revelry, for chamber ensemble debuted on November 14th, 2018, and was performed by the ensemble in residence, Decoda Ensemble. In between the two commissions from Carnegie Hall in the fall of 2018, I visited my hometown of Louisville for a week, to be inducted into my old high school’s Hall of Fame. It was a special moment to be able to perform Francis Borne’s Carmen Fantasie Brilliante as soloist with The Louisville Winds (a community ensemble of high school band directors throughout the region) followed by a weeklong residency at the University of Louisville, where I conducted flute masterclasses, and gave private instruction to the flute studio of Kathleen Karr. During the residency, I was honored to bring with me the Stamps Distinguished Fellows Woodwind Quintet class of 2019 for their very first tour, where they visited and performed at the top high school music programs, performed live on Louisville’s classical music station, WUOL, and on television during the NBC affiliate WAVE-3 morning show with local celebrity host Dawn Gee. It was truly an honor to work together with Stamps coordinator Jodi Levitz and mentor Professor Robert Weiner in organizing their trip. I would later discover that my professional activities could be a resource to the ensemble for which I now mentor and also to the woodwind program. Prior to the pandemic, we had planned tours in San Francisco (in conjunction with my working with the San Francisco Symphony), Seattle (the Seattle Symphony), and in New York under the auspices of the New York Philharmonic. My collaboration with the Philadelphia Orchestra is an example, where I have invited students to meet the orchestra members and listen in to their recording sessions via zoom. Further contributions to the school included serving on the Performance Committee, as well as the School Equity and Diversity Committee.\n\nThroughout the years, my performances, compositions, activities in mentorship and sheer determination have all been sourced from being raised in West Louisville, Kentucky. My family home is just three blocks away where Breonna Taylor was shot and killed, and 5 blocks away in the opposite direction of where Muhammad Ali was born and raised. The poverty, shootings, and seemingly insurmountable struggles of the area all reflect within my works and performances, but from that, there is also an inexhaustible light of hope and determination to survive despite setbacks that would have otherwise vastly overweighed success. The result is that my flute and music creations unapologetically stand for creating empathy for the human condition, its internal and external struggles. My purpose as an artist is about producing that which can heal and transform the listener through messages of community and empathy.\n\nThe 2018-2019 season featured a Colorado tour, with flute masterclasses at Colorado State University, CSU Boulder, and University of Northern Colorado, ending with a solo recital at the Colorado Flute Fair, where I was fortunate to be the headline artist. My composition, Portraits of Langston, was recorded and released on the album, Portraits by the McGill brothers, Demarre and Anthony with pianist Michael McHale, featured Academy Award winner, Mahershala Ali narrating the work, produced by Jim Ginsburg and Cedille Records. I had just ended a full summer of performing at Chamber Music Northwest, where the premiere of Shotgun Houses, by David Shifrin and Harlem String Quartet was given. The 3-movement work was a homecoming of sorts, depicting the early life of Muhammad Ali, leading up to his Olympic Gold match in Rome, 1960. The work allowed me to create a memorial to him and our shared neighborhood of West Louisville. In spring of 2019, work was recorded on the album, “Clarinet Quintet for Our Time” featuring David Shifrin and Harlem Quartet during my residency with the Phoenix chamber music society.\n\nLater in the spring, The Philadelphia Orchestra and Maestro Yannick Nézet-Sèguin welcomed me to perform with them for the 2019-2020 season announcement event. Weeks later, I had the honor of performing recitals as the headline artist for the Mid-South Flute Festival at the University of Memphis, and then the same for the South Carolina Flute Festival. It was during the South Carolina Flute Festival, that I suffered an unexpected family loss of two relatives which put me in a state of deep grief during most of the spring semester of 2019. Months later, traveling became welcome balm as I made two trips to Madison Wisconsin within the span of three weeks to be the featured artist for the LunArts Festival and Women’s National Music Festivals in which both programmed tribute concerts of my works. However, it was the homecoming to the Boston University Tanglewood Institute as a visiting guest artist later that summer that proved invigorating. The Boston University alumni magazine featured an interview of my career and training at BUTI within a two-page article that promoted the visit. It was an honor and delight to instruct students in composition, flute, and chamber music, but it was made all the memorable when Frost School of Music faculty Dean Shelly Berg and clarinet professor, Dr. Margaret Donaghue joined me for a donor event, where we performed original works from my pen. While visiting BUTI, I was also invited to join Metropolitan Opera star Ryan Speedo Green in a conversation at Tanglewood Music Center, hosted by the Boston Symphony Orchestra event Shoptalks at the Tanglewood Learning Center.\n\n​My second season as Assistant Professor at Frost brought about new performances starting with my debut recital, Starry Night. I will be forever grateful to my colleagues Dean Berg, Professor Svetoslav Stoyanov, Dr. Margaret Donaghue for taking the time to collaborate, and special guests Alicia Hall Moran, and Amanda Harberg for such a truly a memorable occasion. I am also very grateful to Ross Harbaugh for inviting me to take on a leadership role that fall in organizing the Frost Chamber Players. The season began anew in 2019, with two concerts: a hurricane relief event and “Opus Yemaya”, featuring the works of women composers, with the collaborative contribution of 14 faculty members from Instrumental Performance, Vocal Performance, Keyboard and Piano department, and Music Theory & Composition. The early spring installment was themed, “Música Cámara de Latinoamericana” with 15 faculty members involved. These performances provided Frost Music Live with updated performance content to use during the pandemic, highlighting faculty collaborations. A week after the debut, the orchestral version of Umoja was premiered by the Philadelphia Orchestra in Verizon Hall from September 18-21st, with a subsequent performance at Carnegie Hall on October 4th. The work received positive review from the Philadelphia Inquirer.\n\nThe year also began with receiving a grant award from Chamber Music America’s Classical Commissioning program to create a new theatrical work for oboe/english horn, bass, and narrator for the group, OBOEBASS! The number of scheduled residencies increased that year, as well as invitations to flute festivals, chamber music societies, and high scale commission offers. I was fortunate to do hybrid artist residencies at Oberlin Conservatory and Virginia Polytechnic Institute, composition masterclasses at Yale University and Boston University, flute masterclasses at University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, and University of Memphis, and a musicianship masterclass at the Young Arts Foundation. It was an honor to be the headline artist for The Raleigh Area Association Flute Festival, The Long Island Flute Club Fair, The Mid-South Flute Festival at the University of Memphis, and the New Music Flute Consortium festival, featuring a tribute concert of my music performed by Conor Nelson and the flute studio of SUNY Purchase. The festival was based around a new work, Amazonia for flute and piano commissioned by a consortium of 64 flutists from around the country and enjoyed a simultaneous coast-to-coast premiere between flutists Carol Wincenc and Amy Likar of the Oakland Symphony.\n\nDue to the arrival of Covid-19 the remaining engagements of the season, which included a residency at Centre College with the McGill/McHale Trio, University of Michigan, a return to Phoenix Chamber Music Society, and Boston University Tanglewood Institute were all cancelled. I am grateful that some were salvaged through postponement, including headline artist engagements for the Florida, Texas, Portland and Seattle Flute Festivals, in addition to a return to Chamber Music Northwest to celebrate David Shifrin’s final season as Artistic Director with performances of Debussy and a repeat performance of the complete Bach Brandenburg Concerti. Instead, many festivals and events shifted gears to virtual platforms. I was fortunate to be a featured artist for the Puerto Rico Flute Symposium, providing a virtual masterclass and performance. I also had the honor of being the plenary speaker for the League of Symphony Orchestras and was also offered a second commission from the Philadelphia Orchestra to create an anthem of solidarity. The new work, Seven o’ Clock Shout, was created in the span of two weeks and premiered in a virtual gala event with Wynton Marsalis, comedian/actor Steve Martin, violinist Nicola Benedetti, and Maestro Yannick Nézet Sèguin.\n\n.\n\nYear three at Frost School of Music brought more engagements on the national stage, this time through the medium of virtual masterclasses, competitions, and panels, ending with being awarded with the \"Provost Award for Excellence in Experiential Teaching\" . The season began with serving on the panels for the Arsht Center “Heritage Project” for the episode “Songs of Freedom”, and Women Band Conductor’s Symposium, and College Music Society. Interviews and content recording sessions were given with Flute Specialists, Inc., New Music Box, the blog I Care if You Listen, flute magazines The Flute View, the Pittsburgh Symphony, Minnesota Orchestra, the Philadelphia Orchestra, and the Orchestra of St. Luke’s. I was honored to be invited to give lectures to the woodwind students of Rice University Shepherd School of Music, composition masterclasses at Boston University, flute masterclasses at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and University of Oregon, and chamber music masterclasses at Ball State University.\n\nOn the Frost School of Music home front, I was appointed Director of Chamber Music, invested with the task of designing a world class chamber music program and serving as a horizontal leader helping to build a connection between departments. Despite limitations of a pandemic-adjusted lifestyle, the chamber music program was able to organize an assignments system, integrate the silos of courses that hindered collaboration into a singular course, and with faculty representation from each Classical based program, launched a chamber music concert season featuring the industry’s premier ensembles through the platform of Frost Music Live. The chamber music program also initiated a faculty webinar series on rehearsal techniques, comportment and technology, created campus pop-up concerts, and organized hybrid masterclasses in Gusman Hall that featured guest artists from around the world interacting with Frost students through the hall’s state-of-the-art camera system. The chamber music program was the first at Frost to host virtual events within this capacity and it made quite an impression on the guest artists who conveyed excitement around the innovation. The fruits of effort shone through with an article feature in the nationally recognized Chamber Music Magazine, in which the program's first artist-in-residence was highlighted alongside photos and depictions of the program's varied activities.\n\nConnecting students to high profile organizations is one of the ways I enjoyed contributing to my department, and I have been blessed to have the opportunity to virtually bring students with me to recording sessions with the Philadelphia Orchestra, where they have met members of the orchestra, watched them rehearse, and record both standard repertoire and original works from my pen. Perhaps the biggest contribution towards student chamber ensembles was the engagement of the inaugural chamber music artist in residence, Alicia Hall Moran, who is an expert on stage comportment, artistry and performance mindfulness. The future is truly bright for the Frost School of Music chamber music program as it continues to build community, a commitment to repertoire diversity, career development, and building a culture and reputation of chamber music performance excellence on a national scale. I am passionate about helping students to discover the many possibilities within chamber music and how important it is to their careers, so it was with much pride to see one of my woodwind chamber music ensembles, Khaos Winds, launch into the professional arena, and to also witness the genesis of the HMI Brass Quintet, in cooperation with the Brass program.\n\nAs one of the designated leaders meant to direct the Frost School of Music to focus on innovations, it was an amazing honor to have the opportunity to work with my brilliant colleague Dr. Jeffrey Buchman as he transformed one of my original works into an informative experience through the innovative augmented reality Magic Leap technology. Wish Sonatine was an ongoing experiment that engaged a team of specialists, including Dr. Edmund Abaka, a specialist on the Middle Passage from the English department and Dr. Kim Grinfeder from the School of Communication, making the project a true collaboration between University of Miami schools.\n\nIn the area of publications, I have been extremely fortunate to have published several works through Theodore Presser, International Opus and my own publishing company, V Coleman Music. Most of my works are a vehicle for social citizenry and empowerment, like Danza de la Mariposa (2012) depicting the strength of women, “Wish Sonatine” (2014) recounts the history of the Middle Passage and was commissioned by Virginia Polytechnic Institute, and “Fanmi Imen”, a work based on Maya Angelou’s poem, Human Family. All these works are frequent repertoire choices for collegiate auditions nationally and my solo and chamber works are among the most performed modern works in the world. In the interests of creating a family legacy, I have now taken a turn towards building an estate through my publishing company, V Coleman Music. After having my music sold by respected publishing houses for over two decades, the importance of being able to maximize revenue from licensing, royalties, and permissions has come into focus in order to become an active humanitarian and patron of the arts. My priority is to give back to the place where I was raised, and hand the legacy of V Coleman Music down to my daughter, and future generations. I have taken measures to buy back my complete catalog from International Opus, including Umoja, a work that was named in 2001 as one of the “Top 100 Great American Works” by Chamber Music America. It has since been featured in other incarnations, such as band, string quartet, flute choir, and most recently orchestra, with subsequent performances by the New York Philharmonic, Carnegie Hall’s National Youth Symphony, The New York Youth Symphony, and The Boston Symphony Orchestra. Within the sphere of composition, my dream is also to create a lasting legacy of works written within an academic home, while providing opportunities and training for hybrid artists. Mentorship is of significant importance and I was honored by composer Gabriela Lena Frank for the invitation to be a mentor for the Gabriela Lena Frank Creative Academy, and to composers Missy Mazzoli and Pulitzer Prize winner Ellen Reid for the opportunity to serve as a mentor for the Luna Composition Lab. One of my current mentees is a 14 year old African-American composer living in Brooklyn. She has already had works premiered by the New York Philharmonic and the New World Symphony.\n\nIt is such an incredible, humbling honor to be counted amongst the faculty at the Frost School of Music. It is an exciting place where creativity and potential for students, ideas, and initiatives can thrive. I am grateful to have the opportunity to witness its growth and grow alongside it, while supporting students and faculty. As a performer-composer, my career path continues its upward trajectory away from Frost, allowing me to focus fully on becoming the best version of myself as a citizen artist, mother, wife, and scholar. This new season brings a new commission with the Metropolitan Opera New Works Program for the creation of a new opera, the Philadelphia Orchestra for a third commission, the Sphinx Foundation in conjunction with co-commissioners Carnegie Hall and New World Symphony for a new work for strings orchestra, and a new residency at The Juilliard School's Music Advancement Program through American Composer's Forum Bandquest® program. Amid a pandemic, I am beyond grateful to have a performance livelihood on a national scale as well, as the headline artist for the Florida Flute Association Flute Fair and Texas Flute Festival next season, alongside residencies at the University of Michigan, Coastal Carolina University, and the Hartt School of Music at the University of Hartford. This pandemic summer brought featured digital appearances for the Austin Flute Fair, UC San Diego Flute Workshops, Boston University Tanglewood Institute, Portland and Seattle Flute festivals, and flutist Amy Porter’s Anatomy of Sound Workshops.\n\nThe influence and words of instructors and peers is a sacred charge. It can either empower or hinder a musician’s development, determination and belief. I learned this firsthand as a student in facing the stigma and ‘otherness’ of not fitting in to the profile or mold of traditional composers by professors in composition, while performance icons like Julius Baker and Leone Buyse embraced and believed in me as a flutist. I remind myself of their investment every day, while doing whatever I can to create room within academic institutions for aspiring performer-composers and multidisciplinary artists.\n\nMy goals as an instructor and colleague are and have always been to cultivate belief and a culture of musicianship and community amongst students, where they feel empowered to give themselves permission to truly make music. It is an honor to build new paths in academia. It is of fervent hope that my colleagues past, present, and future continue to find value and potential in my development as an impactful educator and collaborator."
