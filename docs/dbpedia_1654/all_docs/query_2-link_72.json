Amy has performed as a soloist for the Oregon Bach Festival, Staunton Music Festival, Bach Choir of Bethlehem, Washington National Cathedral, Washington Bach Consort, The Thirteen, Folger Consort, Reading Choral Society, Washington Master Chorale, and New Dominion Chorale, and as a recitalist for Dumbarton Concerts (upcoming), Music on the Lake, and the Chautauqua Institution. She created the role of Sebastian in Scott Ordway’s opera, The Outer Edge of Youth, her recording of which was acclaimed by Opera News (Critic’s Choice), Gramophone, and BBC Music Magazine. Other stage roles include Pamina (Die Zauberflöte), Bastienne (Bastien und Bastienne), Papagena (Die Zauberflöte), Johanna (Sweeney Todd), La Statue Animée (Pygmalion), Josephine (H.M.S. Pinafore), Elsie (The Yeoman of the Guard), and Ms. Jessel (The Turn of the Screw). Amy won first-place in the Audrey Rooney Bach Competition (Kentucky Bach Choir) and the National Society of Arts and Letters’ Winston Voice Competition, and was a prizewinner for the Lyndon Woodside Oratorio-Solo Competition (New York Oratorio Society) at Carnegie Hall, the Annapolis Opera Competition, the Bach Vocal Competition for American Singers (Bach Choir of Bethlehem), and the Franco-American Grand Concours Vocal Competition."
