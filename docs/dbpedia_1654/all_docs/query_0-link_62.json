The Business of Practicing Law: The Work Lives of Solo and Small-Firm Lawyers takes up the timely question of legal advertising and solicitation in shaping lawyers’ professional identities. Her book with co-authors Cynthia Fuchs Epstein, Bonnie Oglinsky and Robert Suate, The Part-Time Paradox: Time Norms, Professional Life and Family and Gender was among the very first to cast a sociological gaze on policies and practices around work-family balance. In current research, Seron is studying the timely issue of indebtedness on law students’ career paths. Her current work also has taken a comparative turn. In dramatic contrast to law, engineering remains a white, male bastion. With Susan Silbey (MIT) and Brian Rubineau (Cornell), this project presents new insight into the remarkably persistent gender gap in engineering. Building on this, Seron has recently given talks in Europe and Australia exploring “The Changing Landscape of Women in the Professions: Why Women Study Law and not Engineering.”\n\nDavid Onek\n\nDavid Onek is host of City Visions on San Francisco NPR-affiliate KALW.

He writes and produces all of his stories, using a journalistic style that captivates radio audiences based on his personal experiences. His upbringing allows him to relate and understand a prisoner's situation and allows him to be the voice of the otherwise voiceless, while at the same time being objective in his reporting. Since coming to San Quentin in 2012, Greg has become a reporter featured on KALW public radio. Greg co-produced the Live Law, a storytelling event, on December 5, 2015, which was published by KQED. Greg recently co-produced and directed Artistic Rebirth, another live storytelling event co-hosted by CNN's W. Kamau Bell. In 2015 Greg headed the hospitality committee for the TEDx San Quentin event. After years of anti-social behavior, Greg was convicted of murder and received 65 years plus 2 life sentences. Since his incarceration Greg has applied himself in various self help programs which has helped him to comprehend the harm his crime has caused. One group in particular was \"No More Tears,\" which brought him face to face with mothers of young men who have been murdered. This group opened his eyes to see the ripple-down effect that crime can cause. Greg says that when he looked into the eyes of a mother who lost her child it moved him to the point to where he knew he never wanted to cause harm to anyone. Pursuing a college degree has also been a cornerstone of his rehabilitation. Education has given Greg a sense of purpose and self worth. Greg continues to transform his life away from the destructive behavior he once participated in. He has developed an interest in mentoring youth in hopes of detouring them from the path to prison. When Greg sets out to do radio stories or produce live storytelling events, his goal is to give the incarcerated men a platform to express themselves, as well as give the public an accurate account of prison life, while dispelling many of the perpetuated myths seen on television. Prison life isn't glamorous, in fact it's the total opposite. Life in prison is actually the end result of negative behavior. Greg's message is clear that anyone can change before you get to prison. And if you do end up here, trust that change is inevitable. Greg has served over 21 years behind bars.

If you listened to the latest episode of Life of the Law, you know I’m a radio reporter interested in legal journalism. Before I dive into how I found myself in upstate New York trailing the life of Homer Marciniak, here is a bit about me. I grew up in the South, splitting my time between Mississippi and Louisiana. My hometown, Natchez, Mississippi was right on the Mississippi river – I’m talking Huckleberry Finn right on the river. I left Natchez for boarding school at Louisiana School for Math, Science, and the Arts. I stumbled into radio journalism in college at my school’s station, KLSU. I also worked at the student newspaper, The Daily Reveille. Packing my VW Jetta to the brim, I left the South in my rearview mirror for Berkeley. “Going Federal,” was my thesis for UC Berkeley’s Graduate School of Journalism, a two-year professional program with various media concentrations. I found this story at the end of my first year, and I was laughably clueless to the depth and complexity of this legal issue. It was around May 2016, and I was gearing up for an internship at KALW in San Francisco, finishing the last of my class projects when a nasty bit of insomnia took hold. I’ve never been great at sleeping, and it gets worse when I’m stressed. After two hours staring at the dark ceiling, I got up and absentmindedly went to the Internet. I ended up looking through the press releases from various FBI field offices. The Buffalo office had one about a comic book collector allegedly murdered for his collection. I was captivated: Comics, a supposed murder, and a man named Rico charged with Racketeering, which is also known as a RICO charge. When school started in August 2016, I knew this would be my thesis, but I didn’t know it would be about prosecutorial discretion. I hadn’t ever heard that term. I owe a lot to my editors, teachers, and peers for their endless support. I worked on this story in my Advanced Audio class with Snap Judgment executive producer Anna Sussman and help from the Investigative Reporting Program. UC Berkeley’s Graduate School of Journalism gave me a travel grant to cover my reporting costs for this story. I flew to upstate New York, rented a car, learned that batteries don’t work as well in the cold, and talked to everyone. Then when I got back, I started cataloguing and editing the audio, and about four months later, I had a thesis.\n\nMedill Justice Project -4 posts\n\nThe Medill Justice Project, founded at Northwestern University in 1999, is an award-winning national investigative journalism center that examines potentially wrongful convictions, probes systemic criminal justice issues and conducts groundbreaking research.

He’s currently the radio instructor at the Salt Institute for Documentary Studies in Portland Maine, and has also worked as the managing editor of the Texas Observer magazine, an editor at the national radio show Weekend America (APM), and as a news reporter at the Austin NPR station KUT-FM.
