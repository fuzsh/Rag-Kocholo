Have an account? .\n\nAmy Adams is best known for films like \"Enchanted\" (2007) and \"Arrival\" (2016).\n\nAccording to critics, her highest-rated movies are \"Catch Me If You Can\" (2002) and \"Her\" (2013).\n\nBut critics didn't love \"Serving Sara\" (2002) or \"The Wedding Date\" (2005).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdams' lowest-rated film is \"Serving Sara\" (2002).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 4%\n\nSummary: In \"Serving Sara,\" attorney Joe Tyler (Matthew Perry) works with Sara (Elizabeth Hurley) to get back at her husband (Bruce Campbell) and his new girlfriend Kate (Adams) during their unexpected divorce proceedings.\n\nAlthough \"Serving Sara\" is a comedy, reviewers thought the laughs were few and far between.\n\n\"Romantic comedy ought to have some romance and laughs, but this extraordinarily flat effort has neither,\" Hank Sartin wrote for the Chicago Reader.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe actress voiced Polly in \"Underdog\" (2007).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 15%\n\nSummary: After a lab accident, a beagle (voiced by Jason Lee) becomes a crime-fighting superhero overnight. With his newfound powers, Underdog defends his home of Capitol City and falls for Polly Purebred (voiced by Adams).\n\nThe majority of film critics thought that \"Underdog\" was cute but too formulaic.\n\n\"At just over 80 minutes it feels not so much like a proper film as a piece of extended filler for slow afternoons on Disney's TV channels,\" James Rocarols wrote for BBC.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe was Kathryn in \"Cruel Intentions 2\" (2000).\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 17%\n\nSummary: In the prequel to \"Cruel Intentions\" (1999), Kathryn Merteuil (Adams), the daughter of a wealthy socialite, attends an upscale prep school and plays mind games with her new stepbrother Sebastian Valmont (Robin Dunne).\n\nThe direct-to-video prequel was originally meant to be a TV series.
