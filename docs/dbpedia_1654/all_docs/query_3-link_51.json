        "text": "CU Boulder to offer music production concentration beginning in 2025 (Daily Camera)\n\nOur College of Music will offer a specialization in music production beginning in the fall of 2025, creating a path for students seeking a non-traditional music career. Dean John Davis says a degree with an emphasis in music production opens up hundreds of potential occupations.\n\nMore: Liberal arts microcredentials on the rise (Inside Higher Ed)\n\nDean John Davis describes how today’s music students want more than a traditional music education. To help meet that demand, the College of Music has developed a set of microcredentials in recent years.\n\n“Song of Pueblo”—a musical journey of Pueblo’s cultural history—receives full-orchestra premiere (CPR/KRCC)\n\nPerformed by El Pueblo Ensemble and our CU Boulder Chamber Orchestra last fall, “Song of Pueblo” tells the history of its namesake city and the surrounding region in music and images. Learn more about our American Music Research Center’s Soundscapes of the People: A Musical Ethnography of Pueblo, Colorado project.\n\nNew takes on a traditional tune: Jazz program arranges, records 3 styles of ‘Pomp & Circumstance’\n\nJust in time for the 2024 commencement ceremony, the College of Music’s Thompson Jazz Studies Program provided this year’s graduates with new takes on the timeless rendition of Sir Edward Elgar’s “Pomp & Circumstance” theme. The traditional graduation march was reimagined by Associate Professor of Jazz Studies Paul McKee in three distinct, captivating styles: Latin jazz, New Orleans funk and big band swing! More college high notes\n\nLouis Saxton named Spring 2024 Outstanding Graduating Senior\n\nAt the College of Music’s commencement ceremony on May 9, we celebrated the remarkable accomplishments and indelible impact of undergraduate cellist Louis Saxton.\n\nIt was hardly a typical four years for Saxton: His freshman year was 2020, coinciding with pandemic lockdowns. And in 2021, Saxton was onsite when shots broke out at the Table Mesa King Soopers; he fled from the tragic violence, only to return the next day to play Bach’s Cello Suite 1 in G Major to offer a degree of healing. Through it all, Saxton relied on the spirit of solidarity, strength and kindness that he experienced at our College of Music—to great success.\n\nA two-time graduate competition winner\n\nLast fall, violinist Rinat Erlichman won first prize in the 2023-24 Bruce Ekstrand Memorial Graduate Student Performance Competition.\n\nA few months later, in early spring, Erlichman performed Jean Sibelius’ Violin Concerto in D minor, Op. 47—accompanied by Postdoctoral Lecturer Barbara Noyes—to become the graduate winner of the College of Music’s annual Concerto Competition (Louis Saxton was the undergraduate competition winner). To enjoy the winners’ performances with the CU Boulder Symphony Orchestra in the fall, visit cupresents.org.\n\nGrad student brings first statewide Jamaican Choral Music Symposium to Boulder\n\nMention Jamaican music to most Americans and the pop sounds of reggae usually come to mind. But there’s much more—the wonderfully rich harmonies of choral music, hundreds of rarely heard sacred songs and folk songs that deserve more exposure.\n\nThis spring, O’Neil Jones—a DMA student in choral conducting and literature—brought those sounds to Boulder, elevating the history, language and musical elements of Jamaican choral music. More student high notes\n\nJoshua Russell named 2024 Distinguished Alumnus\n\nAt the College of Music’s 2024 recognition ceremony in May, we welcomed esteemed music educator Joshua Russell (PhD ’07) back to campus to present him the College of Music’s 2024 Distinguished Alumnus Award! With degrees from Indiana, Shepherd and Northwestern universities—before earning a doctorate at our College of Music—Russell exemplifies what it means to be a universal musician: Beyond his earned expertise in classical, jazz and contemporary musical styles, his research interests include musician health, teacher education, string education and psycho-social/cognitive development in musical learning and teaching.\n\nReflecting on his College of Music experience, Russell recalls the significant impact of his mentors and peers in shaping his career trajectory.\n\nColorado Music Hall of Fame announces 2024 Induction Class (Central City Opera)\n\nWe’re thrilled that lyric soprano Cynthia Lawrence (MM ’87)—who studied with the late Professor Emerita Barbara Doscher—will be inducted into the Colorado Music Hall of Fame on June 29, along with the Central City Opera’s late conductor/artistic director John Moriarty and Keith Miller, a former CU Boulder football player turned opera singer who sang in the College of Music’s opera chorus.\n\nAlso of note, soprano Christie Conover (MM ’10)—who serves as opera production assistant for the College of Music’s Eklund Opera Program—will appear in the CCO’s production of “Street Scene” this summer in the role of Rose. Scott Finlay, who also attended our College of Music, currently serves as CCO president + CEO.\n\nAlumnus Dylan Fixmer—composer with a cause\n\nDylan Fixmer’s (BME ’10) variegated and prolific career aims to inspire empathy and advance community engagement. “I want music to have a purpose,” he says. Indeed, Fixmer’s recently premiered Violin Concerto—which aims to increase support for the unhoused—generated critical raves, a radio broadcast and more.\n\nFixmer not only found life as a composer, but he found a way of writing music with a purpose. “I’m not sure I’d ever want to write a piece of absolute music,” he admits, referring to a composition that is simply a collection of melodies with no storyline or subtext. Instead, Fixmer creates for a reason. More alumni high notes\n\nUpholding the impact and legacy of composer George Crumb\n\nAssociate Professor of Music Theory Emeritus Steven Bruns and the late, renowned composer George Crumb—who passed away two years ago today—shared a close, long-lasting professional relationship and a deep friendship that began in 1992. Bruns—who retired this spring—reflects on his 40-year career (37 years at CU Boulder including serving as associate dean, 2006-19) and on his role as Crumb’s archivist and biographer.\n\nBruns and Crumb each served as faculty members at the College of Music—Crumb, from 1959 to 1964; and Bruns since 1987.\n\nRemembering Fauré—a century later\n\nThis spring marked a milestone for Professor of Musicology Carlo Caballero who—along with his academic partner Stephen Rumph, professor of music history at the University of Washington—co-hosted the Fauré Centennial Festival in Boulder.\n\nFestival events comprising this major, global gathering of CU Boulder faculty and student musicians—alongside panelists from France, Canada, Israel, Brazil, the United Kingdom and the United States—included an impressive number of presentations, concerts and premieres.\n\nBuilding relationships through music making\n\nThe Grammy Award-winning Takács Quartet is not only internationally recognized for its impressive artistic achievements, but also its members’ many community engagement activities—including a new partnership with El Sistema Colorado (ESC) for the 2023-’24 academic year. The partnership comprises “mirror/mentoring” activities, side-by-side rehearsals, roundtable discussions and interactive teaching/coaching sessions. ESC students and their chaperones were also guests of the Takács Quartet on our campus. Shares Harumi Rhodes, the quartet’s second violinist: “We are grateful to work alongside the wonderful ESC teaching artists already in place—many of whom are College of Music students or alumni—to create a user-friendly curriculum that emphasizes building relationships through music making.”\n\nMore: What did the beginning of time sound like? A new string quartet offers an impression (NPR)\n\nOn NPR’s Morning Edition, the Takács Quartet—ensemble-in-residence at our College of Music—discusses Nokuthula Ngwenyama’s “Flow.” The quartet commissioned the composition and gave it its world premiere in November 2023 and then toured it across the country—including on-campus performances.\n\n5 Classical Music Albums You Can Listen to Right Now (New York Times)\n\nMore faculty high notes Incoming faculty\n\n“A Boulder treasure”—Celebrating the inspiring, illustrious career of longtime CU Presents Executive Director Joan McLean Braun\n\nJoan McLean Braun built CU Presents into what it is today: The home of all performing arts at the University of Colorado Boulder, with 500 events a year spanning from opera and concerts to Shakespeare and theater. Braun, born and raised in Boulder and an alumna of the university, was appointed the executive director of CU Presents in 2001 and retires this month (June 2024) after an influential 30-year career at CU Boulder.\n\nMore: Director who built CU Presents to retire after 30 years (Daily Camera)\n\nSenior House Manager Rojana Savoye named 2023 Chancellor’s Employee of the Year\n\nWe’re so proud that longtime Senior House Manager Rojana Savoye was selected as one of just four recipients of the Chancellor’s 2023 Employee of the Year award! Savoye is deeply deserving of this campus-level recognition. For more than two decades, she has maintained positive public relations with CU Boulder patrons, presenters and co-workers; managed and enforced operational policies and procedures within the College of Music; and hired, supervised and mentored student ushers.\n\nFortepiano refurb a labor of love\n\nIt was a long time coming. Piano Technician Mark Mikkelsen—who, for more than eight years, has supported the care and maintenance of the College of Music’s fleet of 160 pianos, 2 harpsichords and an organ—was thrilled when the opportunity arose to rebuild, refurbish and restore one of two fortepianos donated to our college by the late Douglas Taylor and his wife, Avlona, as an in-kind gift in 2019."
