His words read as gloriously as his music sounds.’ Tim Carter, author of Oklahoma! The Making of an American Musical ‘These letters offer fascinating glimpses into some previously unseen corners of the personal and creative lives of one of America’s greatest songwriters. Eisen and McHugh provide a gilded frame for the source material in the form of expert glosses and annotations. The result is a new kind of Cole Porter biography.’ Jeffrey Magee, author of Irving Berlin’s American Musical Theater\n\ni\n\nii\n\nYALE UNIVERSITY PRESS NEW HAVEN AND LONDON\n\nCopyright © 2019 Cliff Eisen and Dominic McHugh All rights reserved.

By and large, the closer details of his activities and personality have been overlooked in favour of broad biographical tropes that were established during his lifetime and have been repeated without much refinement or challenge. This is true of even the best authorized and unauthorized biographies: Richard Hubler’s The Cole Porter Story, as Told to Richard G. Hubler (Cleveland, 1965); George Eells’s The Life that Late He Led: A Biography of Cole Porter (New York, 1967); Robert Kimball and Brendan Gill’s Cole (New York, 1971); Charles Schwartz’s Cole Porter: A Biography (New York, 1977); William McBrien’s Cole Porter: A Definitive Biography (New York, 1998); and Stephen Citron’s Noel & Cole: The Sophisticates (New York, 1993).* Accordingly, in assembling this volume of Cole Porter’s correspondence we had specific aims and priorities – as well as several challenges. Our goal was not to write a biography but rather to assemble as much of Porter’s extant correspondence as possible, alongside complementary primary sources such as diaries and newspaper articles, and to place the letters in context through a succinct connecting commentary. Fans of Porter’s famously witty and wordy songs may be struck by how brief and to the point\n\n* Two additional works are fundamental to Porter research and Porter biography: Robert Kimball, The Complete Lyrics of Cole Porter (New York, 1983); and Don M. Randel, Matthew Shaftel and Susan Forscher Weiss, eds, A Cole Porter Companion (Urbana, IL, 2016). viii\n\nP R E FA C E\n\nmany of his letters are, and this quality dictated our decision to explain the significance of much of the material. Additionally, part of the challenge was the requirement to guide the reader through the disparate threads of Porter’s letters, including business letters to his publishers (such as Max Dreyfus at Chappell), accountant (his cousin Harvey), secretaries (among them Margaret Moore and Madeline P. Smith) and attorneys (John Wharton and Robert Montgomery); working letters about his songs to the book writers of his shows (especially Bella Spewack and Abe Burrows) and arranger (Albert Sirmay); and miscellaneous letters to his fans, actors starring in his musicals (such as Clifton Webb and Ethel Merman), his lovers and his friends. For each of these, but particularly the last two categories, Porter adopts a slightly different tone or diction depending on who he is writing to. For example, his tone of voice in writing to his long-term gay male friends Monty Woolley and Charles Green Shaw is often noticeably exuberant, flirtatious and flamboyant, whereas in writing to his female friends such as Jean Howard he usually adopts a gently charming and affectionate manner. While most of his love letters have apparently not survived, there is a special character to those that have: a particular sincerity and anguish to the sequence of notes (written in French) from Porter to the dancer Boris Kochno in the 1920s, and an almost paternal concern in the letters written to the marine Nelson Barclift in the 1940s. Even before considering the implications of the facts and details contained in the letters, these nuances speak volumes about Porter’s character and offer both the scholar and the general reader new insights into an important historical figure who is at once familiar and yet curiously distant. Of course, the details are where the true surprises lie. For example, we learn that Porter – famously born into a wealthy family and married to a rich divorcee – spent most of his adult life worrying about money, so much so that he often had to weigh up whether the consequently enormous rise in taxes would make it financially crippling to take on certain musical projects. Thus while we might have expected the affluent Porter to have written his songs and musicals without ‘needing’ the money, in truth the opposite was the case: he sometimes sacrificed his financial stability for his art. The letters also illuminate his relationship with his wife, Linda: he describes falling in love with her during their early acquaintance, and while he openly engaged in sexual relationships with numerous men during his marriage to her, the ix\n\nP R E FA C E\n\nparticular depth of feeling he had for Linda, and his anxiety over the emphysema that threatened her well-being, is striking. With respect to Porter’s professional activities, too, the letters offer perhaps unexpected revelations. Letters to the librettists Bella Spewack and particularly Abe Burrows, on the musicals Kiss Me, Kate and Can-Can, highlight Porter’s concern to collaborate with them on details, rather than expecting Burrows and Spewack simply to slot his songs into their stories. His exchanges with Johnny Green and Saul Chaplin, co-musical directors of the movie High Society (1956), similarly show his attention to detail about melody, arrangements and tempi. Twenty years earlier, the extensive diary Porter kept during his experiences writing the movie Born to Dance (1936) offers a window into the songwriter’s excitement and frustrations on encountering the working practices of Hollywood, so different from those of Broadway. Two other sets of diaries, from the mid-1950s, document the lavish cruises Porter undertook with his friend Jean Howard as a distraction following Linda’s death in 1954. And his especially rich correspondence with one of his most loyal friends, Sam Stark, who appears to have retained almost every note or letter he received from Porter, charts the composer’s rise and fall during the last two decades of his life. The letters to Stark reflect the years in which Porter went from being one of the most prominent figures in American culture to dying in seclusion in 1964, six years after he had abandoned his work following the amputation of his right leg, finally bringing an end to the constant pain caused by a serious horse-riding accident in 1937. His death is described in detail by his secretary Madeline P. Smith in a poignant letter to Jean Howard that closes the book. These and many other episodes are brought to life throughout this volume, mostly in Porter’s own words. Of course, the content of the book has been dictated by the availability of material. The Cole Porter Trust – which has been extraordinarily supportive of the project – holds a rich selection of material from the mid-1940s to the end of Porter’s life, but has only selected earlier material in its possession. At Yale University, the Porter papers include a relatively small selection of letters from across the composer’s life, the highlights of which are perhaps the love letters to Kochno and Barclift; even smaller is the Porter collection at the Library of Congress, though it includes useful materials relating to his first attempts at writing musicals and to the later shows Can-Can and Silk Stockings. The x\n\nP R E FA C E\n\nmany gaps left by these main collections forced us to work particularly hard in tracking down further materials from the collections of the recipients of Porter’s letters, whether from friends (Katharine Hepburn’s papers at the Margaret Herrick Library and the Douglas Fairbanks Jr. papers at Boston University) or collaborators (the Arthur Freed and MGM collections at the University of Southern California, the Richard Lewine papers at the New York Public Library and the Bella Spewack papers at Columbia University). (To aid the reader, footnotes indicate important biographical and other factual information; endnotes are used to annotate sources.) Although many gaps nevertheless remain – and readers should not expect a detailed account of every event in Porter’s life or analysis of his works – the commentary (understandably more extensive for Porter’s earlier years, for which fewer letters are known) uses newspaper reports and other available sources to fill in as far as possible some otherwise unaccounted-for details of Porter’s life and times.

He used to drive me a couple of miles out into the rolling Indiana countryside and rein in his horse at the top of a rise. He would point with the end of his buggywhip at a large, rather bleak gray building. “That, Cole,” he would say, “is the place you will end up.” It was the county poorhouse. I was only eight in those days. Getting home from such a gruesome sightseeing, I would rush to my mother Kate for comfort. She would hug me, saying indignantly, “Cole, don’t listen to a thing he says!” ’1 Porter’s brief account is a fair summary of his family’s dynamic during his childhood. His grandfather, James Omar Cole (1828–1923), had inherited a considerable real-estate and mining fortune from his father, Albert Cole. According to some sources, James Omar was the richest man in Indiana. A ‘tyrant’, as Cole Porter later described him,2 he had firm ideas concerning what his grandson should study and where, and what sort of career he ought to pursue: he wanted him to go to school in Indiana, at a military academy or business school, and possibly to pursue a career in law. James Omar’s daughter Kate (1862–1952), Cole Porter’s mother, stood up to him at every opportunity, even in her marriage (9 April 1884) to the less well-off Samuel Fenwick Porter (1858–1927), who subsequently went on to become the leading druggist in Porter’s home town, Peru. Kate not only wanted her son (born 9 June 1891) to attend an East Coast school, as she had, but also encouraged him to pursue his musical and theatrical interests. These were apparent early on. In 1901 the Peru Republican reported that ‘Bills are out announcing the appearance of Porter’s greatest show on earth which will exhibit in Frank Bearss’ yard next Friday. The circus is owned 1\n\nT H E L E T TE R S O F C O L E P O RTE R\n\nand controlled by Master Cole Porter’ and that ‘Miss Emma Bearss took her sister Desdemona, and Cole Porter and Kathryn Kenny to Longansport Tuesday afternoon to see Buffalo Bill.’* When Porter was six he studied piano and violin, later travelling on a weekly basis to nearby Marion, Indiana, to take lessons at the Marion Conservatory of Music. Porter’s father, Samuel, is a shadowy figure. He appears not to have been involved in the disagreements between Kate and James Omar, but at the same time there are hints in the correspondence between Porter’s mother and the headmaster at her son’s school, the Worcester Academy, that he was ‘disgusted’ with Cole.† This animosity was apparently lifelong. In 1905, Porter enrolled at the Worcester Academy in Worcester, Massachusetts. Founded in 1834 as the Worcester County Manual Labor High School, it was intended, as the original prospectus states, as ‘a school for the education of youth in languages, arts and sciences; for promoting habits of industry and economy; and for inculcating the principles of piety and virtue’;3 in 1846 it officially became Worcester Academy.4 During Porter’s time there the principal (1882–1918) was Daniel Webster Abercrombie, who between 1905 and 1909 was in regular correspondence with Porter’s mother, Kate.5 His correspondence details the boy’s progress, his health, and above all Abercrombie’s affection for Cole: 13 May 1905: Daniel Webster Abercrombie to Kate Porter My Dear Madam: As regards music lessons, he could take a lesson a week either on the piano or violin, but it would not be best for him to pursue both at the same time. He would not have time enough for practice, and there would be too great diversion from his regular school work, and too great tax upon his time and strength. There is a school piano available to him for practice but I would\n\n* Peru Republican, 28 June 1901, 5, and 23 August 1901, 4. Emma Bearss was a member of the prominent Bearss of Peru, a family with close ties to the Coles; her grandfather, Daniel R. Bearss, was married to Cole Porter’s maternal great-grandfather’s daughter Emma. In 1834, Daniel R. Bearss and Albert Cole were among the first to purchase property on the Peru canal, and Bearss later became a director of the Indianapolis, Peru & Chicago and Wabash Railroads. † See below, p. 8. 2\n\nF RO M P E RU, I N D I A N A , TO B RO A DWAY, 1 8 9 1 – 1 9 1 9\n\nadvise him to take the violin as practice on that can be done in his own room; however, we occasionally allow a boy to hire a piano and have it in his room to practice out of study hours. I should be entirely willing to have him do this . . . Competent instruction on both piano and violin can be had in Worcester.\n\n19 September 1905: Daniel Webster Abercrombie to Kate Porter My dear Mrs. Porter:I am grateful to you for the kind suggestions of your letter and I shall give them weight and shall try to keep Cole from entangling himself with too many interests. I saw at once that he was a delicate rather than a robust boy and with that in mind I questioned whether he would be able to stand up under school work and music too, the latter, however, may be a source of recreation to him and so not provide a drain upon his time and strength. I am delighted with the boy. He seems most ingenious and delightful in spirit and I am sure that we can look forward to only happy relations with him.\n\n15 January 1906: Daniel Webster Abercrombie to Kate Porter My dear Mrs. Porter:I was very much concerned about his physical condition at the end of last term, and he is not today in the condition I wish he were in or he should be in. He has been subject to colds since coming to us, and they wear him down and exhaust him. My heart ached for the little fellow when I saw him starting home Christmas. I wondered if you could feel that we had taken any care of him, and yet I had tried to be unfailing in my observance of his condition and in my advice and help. He is very careless and runs around uncovered, and is careless about his swimming the pool, going out immediately, improperly clothed . . . He is interested in his work, studies well for so young a boy, is full of play at the proper time and spirits of the proper sort . . . The boys like him. He loves the boys and is fond of them all. He is wise in his companionship, pleasant to everyone and discreet as to whom he admits to the inner circle. 3\n\nT H E L E T TE R S O F C O L E P O RTE R\n\nPorter intended to return home for the summer of 1906, but his departure was delayed by a camping accident, as reported in the Peru Republican: SUSTAINS BROKEN LEG COLE PORTER MEETS WITH A DISTRESSING ACCIDENT. Popular Young Peruvian With a Number of Classmates on an Excursion and While Making a Bed in a Hay Mow Falls Through a Hole. Cole Porter’s summer of ideal recreation and instruction was brought to a sudden termination last Saturday by a painful though less serious accident than might have been expected from the circumstances. Cole is a student at Worcester Academy, Massachusetts, and instead of returning home to Peru for the vacation immediately upon the close of school, started with his teacher of athletics and a party of fifteen schoolmates for a yachting cruise along the New England coast, provided with suits of oil skins and all the paraphernalia necessary for learning practical seamanship. Landings have been made for canoeing and camping and all sorts of outing experiences. The party has been having a wonderful time in the Maine woods and Cole has been writing home that he was developing a prodigious muscle and becoming as strong as Samson. The boys were having the time of their lives and had established a camp on Bibber’s Island in Cascoe Bay, which was poetically christened “Camp Wychmere.” From this point, side trips into the wilderness have been made and it was in returning to camp from one of these, a canoeing trip on Lake Sebago, that the larking young men decided to top off their list of unusual doings by sleeping in a hay mow. It was a hilarious experience for the city boys but resulted disastrously for one of their number. The hay slipped with their weight and carried Cole down an opening to the barn floor below, he striking a scaffolding in the fall. A fracture of the leg a few inches above the ankle joint resulted. It was a mercy and a mystery that no more serious injury was received. 4\n\nF RO M P E RU, I N D I A N A , TO B RO A DWAY, 1 8 9 1 – 1 9 1 9\n\nHe was taken by trolley immediately to a hospital in Portland where medical attention rendered him as comfortable as possible. The broken limb was placed in a plaster cast and Cole himself wrote that he was suffering scarcely at all. S. F. Porter, his father, upon receiving the news, which came by letter Wednesday, started at once for Portland and will bring his son home to convalesce.6\n\nBefore his return to Worcester in the autumn, Porter participated in a concert at a local church: ‘At five o’clock Sunday evening a vesper service consisting of song and instrumental music was held at the Presbyterian church. In addition to the congregational service a special program was rendered in which Mrs. Anna Constant Shutt, of Washington, D. C., gave a number of organ selections in the exquisite style for which she is noted. Cole Porter played a violin solo with organ accompaniment, a slumber song by Johnson. His management of the violin is a delight. A vocal solo by Mrs. E. H. Griswold, sung splendidly, was an important number on the program.’7 Abercrombie’s correspondence with Kate Porter resumed the following winter and addressed in particular Cole’s relationship with other boys at the school as well as his academic progress: 17 January 1907: Daniel Webster Abercrombie to Kate Porter My dear Mrs. Porter: Cole’s record is unsatisfactory not because he does not do good work, but because he does not quite do the work that he is competent to do . . . I have talked to him several times last term and this term in regard to doing his best all the time. He always responds to me delightfully. I think he knows my affectionate regard for him and my warm interest in him. I caution him steadily in regard to his associates. He does not go with bad boys but he goes with those considerably older than himself who while they do not exactly pet him yet show their kindness toward him in a marked way. I believe it is better altogether for a boy to associate with his equals in age, as a rule, and I have so told Cole . . . if Cole should identify himself in personal relations with the boys of his own class, and there are some delightful boys in the class and it is 5\n\nT H E L E T TE R S O F C O L E P O RTE R\n\na strong class, it would be far better for him, but his cuteness and brightness and versatility commend him to older boys. This is the only undesirable tendency that I see in Cole.\n\n28 March 1907: Daniel Webster Abercrombie to Kate Porter My dear Mrs. Porter: That I write is in strictest confidence . . . While I feel very kindly toward Karl Mertz, he is not a boy with whom Cole ought to become intimate. His traditions and ideals are far different from Cole’s, and from those that Cole has always lived among, and your feeling in regard to Cole’s passing his vacation with him at Atlantic City is very wise . . . I cannot tell you how deeply I love your son, and how careful I have been to try to pour the good of the school into his life and save him from the objectional [sic] that is found, and must always be found, among boys and among men.\n\n14 April 1908: Harry Ross* to Kate Porter My dear Mrs. Porter: We quite agree with you in what you say in a previous letter in regard to our responsibility for keeping Cole at work. He has never fallen low in his work; and our worrying is not at all along that line, but rather that he is inclined to attempt a good many things and is not very strong physically . . . I wish you might have seen him in his portrayal of the character “Bob Acres” in the play of the “Rivals”† which the juniors gave last term. It was very finely done and worthy of [a] much more experienced hand in stagecraft. This was one of the things which we allowed him to go into beyond his studies, but that is now past and I think there is nothing special to draw him away this spring term.\n\nPorter was home again in the summer of 1908, at which time Abercrombie wrote to Kate Porter about the coming academic year:\n\n* Daniel Webster Abercrombie took a sabbatical leave from July 1907 to June 1908. During that time Harry Ross was acting Principal of Worcester Academy. † Richard Sheridan’s The Rivals, a comedy of manners first performed at Covent Garden, London, on 17 January 1775. 6\n\nF RO M P E RU, I N D I A N A , TO B RO A DWAY, 1 8 9 1 – 1 9 1 9\n\n20 July 1908: Daniel Webster Abercrombie to Kate Porter My Dear Mrs. Porter: I wish I might see Cole during the summer, and I may find time to write him. I am very deeply interested in his welfare. I want this coming year to be a very different year in his life from last year as regards getting down to his work. He will be in my class for the first time, and I shall try through my contact with him there to inspire him to concentration and to steady purpose in work to use a hunter’s phrase, he “scatter his fire”. Sociality is such an element of his nature, that proves a weakness to him instead of a strength. He gives too much of his time and self to others, he saves too little for the definite purposes which bring him to school. He is an able boy, who is very popular. Do you think that one may be too popular? Proverbs say that “beware when all men speak well of you”. Some of us need have no such caution but Cole should. You cannot doubt the spirit in which I am writing. I know no other way to show my friendship in a boy than by my frankness, though frankness is often misunderstood, even by elder persons than boys, but believe me, that what I have written is from the heart, out of the deep seated purpose to help Cole. I can help him and will if he will allow me to. Please give him my best love.\n\nIntending to apply to Yale University, during the late summer of 1908 Porter – who had failed the Classics portion of the Yale preliminary examinations – received additional tuition in Greek from Alfred E. Dame, a Worcester Academy faculty member. But when he re-took the entrance examination, Porter failed in algebra: 26 September 1908: Daniel Webster Abercrombie to Kate Porter My dear Mrs. Porter: You will be pleased to hear of Cole’s success at Yale this last week, though unfortunately he failed in Algebra which last June he passed. I think it is a very narrow point of view which they hold at Yale in such matters. A boy who passed Algebra in June ought not to be put to the necessity of another examination in September. If he knew enough Algebra shown by their own test in June, the fair assumption is that he knew enough in September, but according to Yale’s cranky ways, the [sic] have conditioned 7\n\nT H E L E T TE R S O F C O L E P O RTE R\n\nhim in Algebra, although they passed him in it last June. I shall write to Yale and try to get the condition removed, though I doubt my success.\n\nOne of the more revealing letters in the Abercrombie–Kate Porter correspondence dates from March 1909, Porter’s final year at the Worcester Academy. In it, Abercrombie explains a drop in her son’s grades – which he attributes to the boy’s increasing engagement with his music to the detriment of his other studies – and reacts to what Kate Porter apparently described as the ‘disgust’ of Porter’s father with his son. This letter is one of the few sources to document the antagonism between Cole and his father: 6 March 1909: Daniel Webster Abercrombie to Kate Porter My dear Mrs. Porter: Your note is received. Are you not more disappointed than the facts warrant? If you will compare Cole’s report for the first half of this term with last terms [sic] record you will find that he has tow [sic] A’s and one A- for the first term, which is an advance and that one of his marks namely, his mathematics, has dropped from B- to C so his studies about balance. There is a decline, however, in his deportment from A- to B-. I was not in the Faculty meeting when his name was marked for deportment and on referring to the slips on which the comments of the teachers are preserved, I found an explanation of Cole’s deportment mark which is D- these words, ‘Irregular, room disorderly, doesn’t study alone, Piano in study hours.’ From the last words I infer, of course, that he has been playing his piano in study hours. I would say that probably these comments are fully deserved and yet I don’t think that you ought to be greatly disappointed, and I certainly don’t think there is any justification whatever for his father being disgusted, or suggest bringing him home.\n\nPorter composed a number of songs at Worcester Academy, including ‘Fi, Fi, Fifi’, ‘The Bearded Lady’, ‘The Tattooed Gentleman’ and ‘Class Song – 1909’, none of which survives.8 And despite his low grades at times, he had considerable academic success as well. In June 1908 he was awarded the Dexter Prize for excellence in declamation, and in 1909 he was the class valedictorian. Nearly thirty years later, in 1934, a classmate of Porter’s, R. P. Robinson, wrote to him with news of their mutual friends and recalled the 8\n\nF RO M P E RU, I N D I A N A , TO B RO A DWAY, 1 8 9 1 – 1 9 1 9\n\npoem with which Porter had concluded his valedictory address: ‘You to the right, and I to the left / For the ways of men must sever. / And it well may be for a day or a night / And it well may be for ever.’* In June 1909, Porter again failed the Greek section of the entrance examinations to Yale. Two months later, on 20 August, Abercrombie wrote to Edmund Scott, a tutor at Worcester Academy: ‘I think I have never had a boy’s failure disappoint me more than Cole’s. This also to me appears a lack of sincerity and of real work in the boy. I have been greatly distressed in mind ever since hearing of Cole’s failure. He has done great discredit to his teaching but he needs a great many hard bumps before good sense will come to him. He ought to have been a great credit to us . . .’ It is not out of the question that the experience of his final year at Worcester soured Porter on the Academy. Barely six years later, in February 1916, three years after Porter had graduated from Yale, Abercrombie wrote to Meylert B. Mullin†: ‘I thank you very much for your kind note which reached me this morning, with its enclosure of the item about Cole Porter. What a genius he has for such work. I haven’t laid eyes on Cole since he graduated from school. I think I have not heard from him. His alienation from the school is very sad to me, and without explanation. I don’t understand it. It is one of those little tragedies of my life for which I find no explanation and which always bring me real sorrow . . .’9 Porter’s difficulties with the entrance examinations notwithstanding, he enrolled at Yale in the autumn of 1909, where he majored in English and minored in music. Over the course of four years he took classes in English, French, German, Latin, history, philosophy and biology.10 Yet much of his time was spent on musical and theatrical activities. He joined the Yale Glee Club, the Whiffenpoofs, a small, a cappella singing group established in 1909,‡\n\n* Robinson also remembered a debate on 13 March 1909 at which, according to records at Worcester Academy, ‘[Porter] successfully argued the judge into believing Uncle Sam should not establish a Parcel Post System, chief point being that Uncle Sam could not compete with the Express Companies in handling big parcels.’ McBrien, Cole Porter, 27. † Mullin (birth and death dates unknown) was a fellow alumnus of the Worcester Academy. ‡ See Rev. James M. Howard, ‘An Authentic Account of the Founding of the Whiffenpoofs’ at https://web.archive.org/web/20110718040120/http://www.whiffenpoofs.com/storage/ Whiffenpoofs_History.pdf. Porter also regularly attended the ‘Pundits’, a group organized by William Lyons Phelps, the Lampson Professor of English at Yale, where students were given dinner and lectures on artistic topics. See McBrien, Cole Porter, 34. 9\n\nT H E L E T TE R S O F C O L E P O RTE R\n\nand was a regular participant in the Yale Dramatic Association, for which he composed two of his earliest shows, Cora (1911) and And the Villain Still Pursued Her (1912), for both of which only the lyrics survive.* By his own account, Porter also composed more than three hundred songs at Yale,11 of which only eighteen survive, including ‘Bridget McGuire’, ‘Since Dolly’s Come to Town’ and ‘Antoinette’.12 His football songs, ‘Bingo Eli Yale’, ‘Bull Dog’, ‘A Football King’ and ‘If I Were Only a Football Man’, were especially popular. An article in the New Haven Register for 12 September 1911 takes special note of them while at the same time promoting a common, if in Porter’s case untrue, trope about self-taught ‘genius’, though perhaps in this instance tongue-incheek: ‘. . . there are several new songs this year and among them two by Cole Porter, of Peru, Indiana, a member of the junior class in the academic department and one of the best entertainers who has ever been at Yale. This year his songs are “Bulldog,” and “Eli,” and he wrote the music and words . . . Mr. Porter had no musical education but had natural ability along this line. Some of the peculiar and distinctive features of his work have been explained by the fact that he spent several years in the mountains of Roumania, and heard many strange birds while up there.’ In 1912, Porter composed his first surviving show, The Pot of Gold, which premiered at the Delta Kappa Epsilon on 26 November 1912. A significant correspondence with the author of the book, Almet F. Jenks Jr. (1892–1966), documents the genesis of the work: [Summer 1912]: Cole Porter to Almet Jenks13 Westleigh on the Mis-sis-sin-e-wa, Peru, Indiana My Dear Almet: As for “Manalive,” don’t you think it offers very little: All talk. I have tried in vain to get “The Dead City” without success. I shall keep on trying but it looks very hopeless. * Kimball, The Complete Lyrics of Cole Porter, 11–18. The performance of And the Villain Still Pursued Her on 24 April 1912 was noted in The Yale Literary Magazine 77 (May 1912), 319: ‘Memorabilia Yalensia . . . The Dramatic Association. On April 24th, held its annual smoker at the Lawn Club and presented a burlesque musical comedy, entitled, “And the Villain Still Pursued Her,” by T. G. Thomas, 2nd, 1913, with lyrics and music by Cole Porter, 1913.’ A later performance was given at the Yale Club in New York on 10 May 1914; see the Yale Alumni Weekly 21 (May 1914), 837. 10\n\nF RO M P E RU, I N D I A N A , TO B RO A DWAY, 1 8 9 1 – 1 9 1 9\n\nOne thing, the idea of Manalive himself might be excellent if applied to Yale. We must have this show such that the audience can comprehend the plot and no drunken DKE crowd would travel to Beacon House. I do hope you will be obvious and uninteresting. Otherwise we will suffer defeat, for my music was never the result of inspired imagination. I have written the following songs-“She was a fair young mermaid” “I want to be married” “If I were only a football man” “My Salvation Army queen” All I can ask is that you dash off a scenario and send it to me so I can work on opening choruses. Also tell me whom you select for different parts, and I can write fitting songs the more easily. Don’t forget color. We must have lots of that. Be naif and I can join you. Goodbye. Devotedly, Cole\n\n[Summer 1912]: Cole Porter to Almet Jenks Almet, My Dear: I am delighted I received a letter from you in which you showed a descent from the ethereal. As for the title The pot of gold being trite, I think it is truly wonderful. A title is good only when it means nothing until the fall of the final curtain, and you must admit that in this case, the final curtain must fall. As for the caste [sic], it seems rather large, but I suppose you consider it necessary. Of course with so many, rehearsals will be exceedingly difficult. Then, too, a chorus girl is worth more than a small useless part. I love your two Russian Nihilists. I got the blank after one of the names. Of course, you will be Turnesky in your own inimitable way. I am trying to write a talking mysterioso song for you and your fellow conspirator. As soon as you finish the conversation between the Nihilists on which the plot is formed, write it to me and I will convert it into a recitatif. As a matter of fact I have written your motif already. It combines the splendor of Wagner and the decadence of Strauss. 11\n\nT H E L E T TE R S O F C O L E P O RTE R\n\nYou speak of three acts. I beg you--Don’t! Three would be either interminable or choppy. Remember what a change of costume and scene means! It is a terrible thought always, and if possible try to condense your action to 2 acts. Another thing (Forgive Me) Dink Stover was altogether too short. It gave one sensation but not perception. Please write this play a long one, for we can easily cut parts if we time it and find it soporific. I wish we could make this play a little masterpiece in its own foolish way. Take it horribly seriously, and I will join you. It really is important, for after all it can never happen again. The minute you finish it send it to me. I have a great deal to do when I return to college, and I must have most of this play in black & white by Oct. 1st. And another-“I wonder where my old girl is now” Write me here until Sept. 6. Then my address will be Shelbourne Farms, Shelbourne, Vermont, care of V. Webb, until Sept. 10. After the wedding at Garrison, the 11th, I go to Humphrey[‘]s. You will be there too & we can finish things up. As soon as college opens I shall begin rehearsing songs, & by the second weak [sic] you can begin. If you have written the opening of the first act, send it at once. Also write me the caste [sic] again, with the names of each member more plainly so I can use them in verses of songs. You have no idea how delighted I am that you have gone at this play so hard. We ought to open a few eyes. Goodby, Almet, & thank you. Devotedly, Cole Aug. 234d [!]\n\n[Autumn 1912]: Cole Porter to Almet Jenks My Dear Almet: I received the first act, the episode and the note. Needless to say, I am delighted with the first act. The plot is excellent, the characters delightfully drawn, and most of the lines pertinent and witty. 12\n\nF RO M P E RU, I N D I A N A , TO B RO A DWAY, 1 8 9 1 – 1 9 1 9\n\nI have written down the Overture. It begins with the motif–Chlodoswinde’s yearning for Larry; then follows the waltz representing her pangs on finding him false, ending in the motif of supreme happiness, which appears again at the end of the play. Following this come’s [sic] Larry’s love song. Then a thing in 5/4 time introducing the foreign influence on the hotel, modulating into a death march representing the monotony and decadence of the place. This is connected with the opening chorus by a movement which grows more excited as it progresses. The opening chorus is the Rainbow song, which can be sung by guests who depart at the end of it. At this, the bell-boys sing: “Bellboys” If you get done soon enough (& by that I don’t expect you to tear it off) I can have incidental music, an overture, an entr’acte, combined motifs, melodrama, etc. Perhaps I sound altogether too serious about it, but I feel that it is up to you to show New Haven a little of that brain. You have no idea how much is expected. You have a reputation. I have written a song for Anstruther (Arnold) called “My house-boat on the Thames.” “My houseboat on the Thames” Then a thing which can be stuck in some opening chorus or finale-“Exercise” I rather fear for the Episode. It seems to me that it would take nearly as long to prepare this scene as to go at once to the 2nd act, but perhaps I am wrong. However, we can talk that over on returning to college. Tell me, who do you cast for Penton? Will Jack Blossom be a good Harrison? I can never thank you enough for accomplishing so much and such good work. Would it be possible to have the second act take place in the lobby also? Goodbye, Almet. Write me if anything drastic happens. Devotedly, Cole\n\n[September 1912]: Cole Porter to Almet Jenks My Dear Almet: I received your letter answering in regard to the change of scene and the Episode. 13\n\nT H E L E T TE R S O F C O L E P O RTE R\n\nOf course I was delighted to hear from you that the second set doesn’t require a switch, and I think your idea of contrast is wonderful. I feel duty bound to tell you how much work I have done because you must believe me enjoying the wilds of Maine. The truth is that I have manuscripted practically all of the first act. Immediately upon reaching New Haven Humphrey [Parsons] is going to try to persuade Dave Smith of the Music School to orchestrate it for about ten instruments. As for getting together, I wish we could dine someplace Friday night and go through the memebers [sic] of each class and pick out ability. Don’t you think we could confine the chorus to bell-boys and feminine guests? I shall leave the caste [sic] almost entirely to you, but of course those who can’t sing can’t have songs. You have no idea how grateful I am for your play. I think we ought to get an awful lot of satisfaction in seeing it well done. I can begin rehearsing songs Monday night, and you ought to begin getting separate parts typewritten as soon as you return. I have had to insert arrows indicating the approach of certain songs, at which points the conversation must “lead up,” but otherwise there are practically no changes. I am so anxious to see you and talk over the whole thing, having thought of so little else during the past fortnight. It’s a great shame about the Episode, but I really do believe you should disown this attractive child of your brain. Finish that second act. I can do nothing until you do. You see my only means of making the songs relevant is by writing verses which give the idea of belonging to the person that sings them. We shall meet very soon, but until then farewell. Devotedly, Cole Sunday. We leave for New Haven tomorrow. Let me know the minute you arrive. late September, 1912\n\nIn 1913 and 1914, even after his graduation, Porter continued to be active at Yale events including, in January 1913, writing and delivering an essay, ‘The New Hotel of America’, at the Scroll and Key, a ‘secret’ 14\n\nF RO M P E RU, I N D I A N A , TO B RO A DWAY, 1 8 9 1 – 1 9 1 9\n\nsociety founded at Yale in 1842 and consisting of fifteen prominent seniors:* It seems only fitting when the Taft Hotel is about to celebrate its first birthday to immortalize the celebration by writing an essay on the New Hotel of America. Of course every town in the country with a sense of decency has a new hotel in these days. You may travel to the little city and look for the shabby hotel whose plush parlors you used to dread, only to find instead a wonderful skyscraper on the main street making all the early Victorian shops about it fairly black with rage. The minute you arrive, the native who meets you begins booming the hotel to the skies. You are told with hushed awe of the interior decoration, and of the vulgar display of bathrooms. Then after leading up gradually, he ends by giving you the prize package – he mentions the grill – for there is always a grill. This is perhaps the most typical feature of the New Hotel – the grill – a low-ceilinged, rotingly ventilated cellar where the piece de resistance is rarebit, where the vintage is Budweiser all of which is accompanied by an orchestra from Long Branch taking the name of Robert E. Lee in vain. With the coming of the new type of hotel, we have lost the dear old American plan – the famous gorge – the delight of the really hungry – which required no imagination to satisfy the appetite. Do you remember\n\n* Members of the Scroll and Key have included George Shiras (1832–1924, U.S. Supreme Court Justice), Cornelius Vanderbilt III (1873–1942, Brigadier General during World War I), Dean Acheson (1893–1971, Secretary of State under President Harry Truman), Dickinson W. Richards (1895–1973, winner of the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1956), Gilbert Colgate (1899–1965, chairman of what is now Colgate-Palmolive), John Hay Whitney (1904–82, publisher of the New York Herald Tribune and from 1957 to 1961 U. S. ambassador to the United Kingdom), the philanthropist Paul Mellon (1907–99), the 1972 Democratic Vice-Presidential candidate Sargent Shriver (1915–2011), John Lindsay (1921–2000, Mayor of New York, 1966–73), Watergate Special Prosecutor Philip B. Heymann (1932–) and A. Bartlett Giamatti (1938–89, commissioner of Major League Baseball, 1989). Many years later, in August 1964, Porter’s biographer George Eells wrote to Dean Acheson concerning Porter. Acheson, who for a time had been Porter’s room-mate, replied on 8 September: ‘I have just seen your letter of August 12 in which you ask for any recollection of Cole Porter’s musical promise while we were at Harvard Law School together. So far as I know Cole never studied law at Harvard, but music. A group of Keys men, including Cole, Laurason [sic] Riggs, and myself took a house for the 1915–1916 year at 1 Mercer Circle. Cole and Laurason were writing, “See America First,” which opened in Providence and died there.’ Yale University, Porter Collection, Box 49, Folder 301. 15\n\nT H E L E T TE R S O F C O L E P O RTE R\n\nthe days when a heavily betrayed waiter used to place your plate on the table and then encircle it with little bathtubs – the whole giving the impression of a sun surrounded by a myriad of satellites? And will you ever forget the old menu that revelled in its number of vegetables, and gloated over its variety of pie? But those have passed now, and in its stead, we are presented with an aesthetic European plan menu wearing a cover on which is painted a lady in an impossible décolleté gown rising out of a glass of champagne. But these abuses which beset us are as nothing compared with the architectural evil in the typical New Hotel. And of course, New York is blamed again, when really the whole trouble lies with the owners of the hotels in our little towns. Every little village hotel owner decided to imitate the innocent metropolis to a T. As a result of this we see such a spectacle as the Hotel Taft which completely demoralizes the effect of a New England college campus. But we rejoice to say that our American taste shows signs of improvement. This is a new era of hotels in America. Perhaps in a few years we shall return as graduates and refer to the dear old days when the Taft stood there.*\n\nA lost and apparently otherwise unknown work by Porter, The Kaleidoscope, is documented for 30 April 1913;† on 22 October he sang at the Boston Yale Club14 and in March 1914 he gave a piano performance at the WaldorfAstoria for the New York Yale Alumni Dinner.15 Also in April 1914, Porter and his Yale classmate T. Lawrason Riggs (1888–1943), with whom Porter soon after collaborated on See America First, produced Paranoia, or Chester of the Yale Dramatic Association at the Hotel Taft in New Haven.16 And in\n\n* The Taft Hotel, opened in New Haven on 1 January 1912 at 265 College Street, beside the Shubert Theatre (where many musicals by Porter and others had out-of-town tryouts), was built on the site of the New Haven House, which had been demolished in 1910. Named after President William Howard Taft, the twelve-storey hotel was at the time the tallest building in the city. It survived until 1973 when it was renovated and reopened, in 1981, as the Taft Apartments. See http://www.patriquinarchitects.com/history-of-the-taft-hotel-in-new-haven-ct/ (accessed 9 August 2018).

The noise and jollity rose to a crescendo as the committee’s stage programme began with coffee. Then followed three hours of very amusing business, in which figured several graduate monologue artists, a Princeton dancing act, and a Mexican play put on by Cole Porter, ’13, who was assisted by an all-star cast including Woolley, ’11;† Johnfritz Achelis, ’13; Laurence Cornwall, ’12; and three very delightful undergraduate Dramatic Association actors.’17 Several months before We’re All Dressed Up, on 22 September 1913, Porter had enrolled at the Harvard Law School. One of his assignments – a fictitious brief, whether made up by him or assigned is unknown – describes the following situation: Defendant and his friend Brown were standing on a street corner waiting for a car when Brown said to Defendant, “Tell me what you know about the murder in South Boston.” Thereupon Defendant spoke the following words intending that only Brown should hear them. “I see from the morning paper that Exum is strongly suspected of the crime. Much evidence tends to show that he is the guilty man, but from the facts stated in the newspaper there is not sufficient evidence to warrant saying he is guilty. Still I would suspect the rascal anyway. My friend Smith says he is guilty and I believe him.” The truth was that there were two morning papers and one of them charged A. B. Exum with the crime and the other the plaintiff. Jones and Brown did not know the plaintiff and both had A. B. Exum in mind. A. B. Exum was in fact guilty. One person in the crowd, waiting for the\n\n* Kimball and Gill, Cole, 27, cites an undated and unsourced letter by Riggs describing the show’s revival at a later meeting of the Associated Western Yale Clubs: ‘Apparently we were a success because a few years later the reunion was in Cleveland, and we were again asked to assemble the show . . . For this occasion Cole wrote Cleveland. He wired the words to us in New York and we learned them on the train.

The plaintiff now sued the defendant for slander. The defendant demurred but was overruled and brings the case upon appeal.18\n\nIt seems likely, given the names of the plaintiff and defendant, A. B. Exum and X. Y. Jones, as well as the name of the ‘lawyer’, Coram W. McAfee, C. J., to say nothing of the almost comical scenario, that the entire brief is Porter’s work. And it apparently did not bode well for his legal career, which ended in the autumn of 1914 when he transferred to the Harvard School of Music. According to an interview he gave in 1939, ‘One day I was at a party and I played a piece I had written and the dean of the Law School said “Porter – don’t waste your time – get busy and study music.” ’19 In the spring of 1915, Porter was contacted by the literary and theatrical agent Elizabeth Marbury (1856–1933)* about songs for a show that would eventually become his first Broadway musical, See America First. Several telegrams that Porter sent to his mother describe his meetings with Marbury and one, to his grandmother Rachel Cole (see below), may be an attempt, however circuitous, to impress his otherwise sceptical grandfather:\n\n9 April 1915: Cole Porter to Kate Porter20 CHECK ARRIVED LAST WEEK[.] THANK YOU[.] GOT OFFER TO WRITE JUNIOR LEAGUE SHOW FOR NEXT YEAR[.] COULD NOT ARRANGE MEETING WITH COMMITTEE UNTIL MONDAY NIGHT[.] WILL COME HOME AS SOON AS POSSIBLE[.] MEETING MISS MARBURY TOMORROW AFTER-NOON[.] LOVE . . .

Miss Marbury, who is known from coast to coast, and is a recognized authority on matters theatrical, was the one who first induced Mr. Porter, who was graduated from Yale only last year, and is now taking a special musical course at Harvard, to “write for the profession.” “It may seem that I am making a large order for the young man,” she went on, “but I am convinced that Mr. Porter is the one man of the many who can measure up to the standard set by the late Sir Arthur Sullivan.

COLE.\n\nThe subject of Porter and Riggs’s musical was topical in the 1910s in particular: the ‘See America First’ movement, apparently founded in Salt Lake City in 1906, was taken up by President Taft in 1911, as the New York Times reported: ‘President Taft today promised a committee appointed by Gov. Crothers of Maryland that he would write a letter indorsing [sic] the “See America first” movement.’ A ‘See America First’ convention was held in Baltimore that same year, and in 1912 the Secretary of the Interior linked the development of national parks to the movement: ‘There is no scenery in the Old World grander or more inspiring [than the national parks], and as new roads are built giving easy access to all parts of every park, and inns and lodges are constructed, the American people will gradually learn that the now common phrase, “See America first,” has more than a merely patriotic significance.’ Less than two months after the opening of See America First, a bill was presented to Congress to centralize the administration of the National Park Service.26 Porter’s See America First, however, was not longlived, closing on 8 April after only fifteen performances. The Evening World described it as ‘an achievement that college boys might have done in the way of entertainment’, while the Evening Sun called it ‘the worst musical comedy in town. Don’t see America First.’27 For Riggs, the failure of See America First was devastating. Shortly after it closed he wrote, ‘I spent the fall of 1915 in Cambridge, working on the book and lyrics of a comic opera, “See America First,” with Cole Porter, 1913, who did the music. It was presented in New 21\n\nT H E L E T TE R S O F C O L E P O RTE R\n\nYork during the winter, but failed dismally. Owing to the fact that the composer and I consented to a complete transformation of the piece to meet the capabilities of its interpreters and the supposed taste of the public, we suffered, in addition to our disappointment, the unsatisfactory feeling that nothing had been proved as to the worth of our efforts. But we are wiser as well as sadder, and for myself I have done with attempts at dramatic composition, so far as I can foresee.’28 For his part, in a 1953 interview Porter said: ‘I’ll never forget that night . . . when my first show closed . . . As they dismantled the scenery and trucked it out of the stage alley, I honestly believed I was disgraced for the rest of my life.’29 While the ‘See America First’ movement encouraged both patriotic and aesthetic values, it was also exploited, sometimes in convoluted ways, by American businesses. This may have provided Porter with what was probably his first commercial work and advertising opportunity,* a campaign by the Sherwin-Williams paint company, ‘Brighten Up America’: The February magazines are showing the first ads of the SherwinWilliams Company’s “Brighten Up America” spring campaign. The company was especially fortunate in their selection of a slogan and design, which includes Uncle Sam. They could hardly have chosen an idea for their campaign which is more up-to-the-minute and timely. For many years the Sherwin-Williams Company has used the slogan “Brighten Up,” and this year simply tied it up with the word “America” in order to help in the big movement in which all the paint companies are interested to preach to the American people the gospel of the economy of painting. It has been an acknowledged fact that the American people, in spite of their prosperity and expenditure of money, are not spending it to purchase paint for their houses as much as they are for luxuries. They don’t think of paint as a necessity or an economy. The Sherwin-Williams “Brighten Up America” campaign is intended to waken the American people to the foolishness of neglecting such an important matter as house painting . . . [A] unique feature of the campaign is a song which the Sherwin-Williams Company is publishing, called “Brighten Up,\n\n* Further, see below, pp. 445, 456–7, 482. 22\n\nF RO M P E RU, I N D I A N A , TO B RO A DWAY, 1 8 9 1 – 1 9 1 9\n\nAmerica!” The music is by Cole Porter, a graduate of Yale University, who made such a name for himself in writing songs of Old Eli that he is now a professional song writer, having many songs accepted for musical comedies, and his opera, “See America First,” was produced on Broadway last winter. This song will be given out by S.-W. agents and dealers and will be featured in some of the spring campaign ads. The agents who are putting on Brighten Up parades will run lantern slides advertising the event the night before in their local movie picture houses. One of the slides will show the words of the “Brighten Up America” song in order to get the audience singing while the pianist plays the tune.30\n\nPorter’s song – if in fact it was written and published – is apparently lost.31 Porter’s activities in early 1917 are not well documented, although at least one of his war-related performances was noted in the New York Times on 1 February: ‘Several Men to Have Wings in Big War Charities Entertainment. The Angel choir which is to take part in the big entertainment for Mrs. Gertrude Atherton’s and three other big war charities under the direction of Miss Elsa Maxwell* on Feb. 15 at the Century Theatre is growing . . . Miss Laurette Taylor will dance the fox trot with Preston Gibson, and Miss Mimi Scott will sing a song, “I’m Looking for You,” with Cole Porter.’32 Beyond participating in fund-raising events, however, Porter may also have been thinking about volunteering for the war effort, as did many of his Yale classmates, encouraged by an article published in the Yale Alumni Weekly the previous autumn: ‘Call for American Hospital Workers in France. The demand for workers in connection with the American Ambulance Hospital in France was never greater than at present. Drivers are needed in the Paris service, which is comparatively simple; and also for the field service, which is more serious business. Yale men who care to take on an experience of six months or more in this work may correspond directly with William R. Hereford, Headquarters, American Ambulance, 14 Wall St., New York City. There is also need for hospital orderlies. These men wait on and care for the wounded, serve their meals, lift them, help the convalescents to walk, etc. The need of * Elsa Maxwell (1883–1963) was a professional hostess, gossip columnist and radio host who, to some extent, hitched her star to Porter and to her friendship with him and his wife Linda. In 1957 she published How to Do It, or The Lively Art of Entertaining, the title of which is a play on Porter’s ‘Let’s Do It, Let’s Fall in Love’. 23\n\nT H E L E T TE R S O F C O L E P O RTE R\n\nsuch workers is so great that the New York office not only pays for board and lodging while in the service, but defrays passage money New York to Paris and return for those who cannot afford to pay their own. In the case of ambulance drivers, the applicant pays his own passage, though board and lodging are provided these when once arrived in France.’33 Porter registered for the draft on 5 June 1917 and in July sailed for Europe on the paquebot ‘Espagne’ to work for the Duryea Relief Organization, which was founded in France in 1914 by the expatriate American writer Nina Larrey Duryea (1874–1951) to aid war survivors and refugees. A programme survives for a concert that Porter gave on board on 17 July, possibly the concert described by one of his shipmates, Albert Le Tarte, who in an article published in the Brunswick Record in August 1917 noted that ‘a composer [was] with us also, by the name of Cole Porter, who rendered several of his own compositions’.34 A few months after his arrival in France, Porter himself had an open letter describing his time there published in the Peru Republican for 5 October: Letter from Cole Porter at the Front. A very interesting letter from Cole Porter, who is personal aid to the president of the Duryea Relief party now at the battle front in France, written to his mother, Mrs. S. F. Porter, of this city, gives interesting and valuable first-hand glimpses of the war and his own work. He gives a description of the latest German infernal machine, the caterpillar, a string of burning torches shot from the ground to hit the French airplanes. We are permitted to copy parts of the letter: Dear Mother: An awfully cheery letter arrived from you today (September 4) dated August 13. Life here continues to offer great surprises. For instance, yesterday I went to inspect the village of Fresnoy. As I was walking along the road of the town I passed the entrance of an abri (shelter in case of air raids). But it looked so much better than most of them that I opened the door to it. I peered down the steps (they are usually about twenty feet below the surface) and there, at the bottom stood a woman of about sixty years smiling up at me. She asked me to come down, which I did, and found an immaculately clean room, a dirt 24\n\nF RO M P E RU, I N D I A N A , TO B RO A DWAY, 1 8 9 1 – 1 9 1 9\n\nfloor swept to a polish, and this was her home. She told me her story – how she was all alone in the world, her husband and her son having been killed, but, until the Boches had come, she had lived in her brick house, on her farm, with thirty cows (she had prizes for cattle on her walls in the cave). Then, the invasion. She fled, but was taken prisoner, sent to Prussia to work, grew ill and was returned to France by way of Switzerland, went back to her home at Fresnoy, found it had completely disappeared, and she happened on this German abri as the only shelter she could find. Of course it was an astounding adventure she’d had, but the amazing part was her gaiety and her charm. I love this French race. They’re so attractive, so amusing, so wonderfully brave, and so simple – just like children, all of them. So, we being without a cook, and I being tired of opening canned beans, asked her if she could cook. And she said, “Oh, Monsieur of course I can cook.” So I said, “Pack up your things and jump in the motor.” So here she is, this extraordinary old sport, living in the house with us, working like a Trojan, and cooking delicious omelettes, rabbit chops and compotes. And she has forgotten her trouble and we’ve forgotten ours! Last night being very clear and calm, I went out to the aviation camp with the commandant of this canton, to see a glimpse, at least, of the only attractively exciting side of the whole war. I stood there and saw sixty aeroplanes rise, one by one, and make for St. Quentin. Before each aviator mounted his plane he would come up to his captain, shake his hand, and cry, “Au revoir, mon Capitaine!” and run off to his job. It was very, [sic] touching, mother, to see all this and to know that nearly every night one of these aeroplanes either never returns or else fails and kills its occupants. A little later we saw three German caterpillars. The caterpillar is the newest German atrocity. It consists of a string of burning torches which is shot from the ground. It rises quickly and if it hits the French aeroplane it wraps itself about it and burns the plane and the accupants [sic] in the air. The French are completely “up in the air” about it. They fear it as nothing else and they can’t understand how it is made. I spent today in Erchen, and tomorrow I go to Amiens. I’m gradually getting awfully well acquainted with this country in the zone-des-armees, and I’ve worked so hard over my Ford camion that it runs perfectly. I know “Sammie” will be glad to hear that I really am developing into quite a mechanic. 25\n\nT H E L E T TE R S O F C O L E P O RTE R\n\nA letter from headquarters today says that the reports from the French officers here in charge were pleased with the thoroughness and the speed of my inspections. I’ve interviewed over a thousand people and on finishing up here they want me to take charge of an inspection tour in the Vosges Mountains. Arnold Whitridge* is a captain on Gen. Pershing’s† staff. I have seen him. I am so glad that your garden has been such a success. I can see you eating those delicious things now. Oh, I’d love to run out to Westleigh for about two weeks and then bring you back to France with me. I like my job and my health was never better. Lots of love to all of you. Affectionately, COLE. Roye-sur-Somme.35\n\nIt is far from clear what action Porter saw in France, or for that matter what his duties might have been. Although he himself claimed to have been with the French Foreign Legion and to have studied at the École d’Artillerie at Fontainebleau,36 there is no concrete evidence to back up his assertion. A letter to Monty Woolley from September 1918, however, mentions gas attacks and gas masks: September 1918: Cole Porter to Monty Woolley37 Mont Don’t waste any time in going to the bank & trying to find out about my finances. I’m worried simply because I can’t understand it all. They shot gas at us this morning + I got panicky. I hate these masks. Forgive me for writing so often. Please send me some good books. I may die - I’m so bored. But don’t tell.\n\n* Arnold Whitridge (1892–1998) was a fellow student of Porter’s at Yale and later a professor of history there; see his obituary in the New York Times for 2 February 1989 (https://www. nytimes.com/1989/02/02/obituaries/arnold-whitridge-ex-professor-at-yale-and-an-author-97.html). † John Joseph (‘Black Jack’) Pershing (1860–1948) was commander of the American Expeditionary Force on the Western Front, 1917–18. 26\n\nF RO M P E RU, I N D I A N A , TO B RO A DWAY, 1 8 9 1 – 1 9 1 9\n\nPorter’s reputation for pranks and fabrications somewhat casts at least a shadow of doubt on whether this letter is entirely serious. According to George Eells, an authoritative biographer of Porter’s, Monty Woolley, possibly the composer’s closest friend, reportedly said that he recalled ‘Porter strutting up and down the boulevards in uniforms ranging all the way from a cadet’s to a colonel’s. Porter . . . had more changes than Maréchal Foch, and wore them with complete disregard of regulation.’ Similarly, the annual report for the Yale class of 1913 states that ‘Classmate Cole A. Porter has joined the American Aviation Forces in France although nobody seems to know in what capacity.’38 Nevertheless, Eells quotes an official war record, though without identifying his source: Porter had left the Duryea Relief Organization by January 1918 and was attached to the American Aviation Headquarters on the Avenue de Montaigne in Paris; on 20 April 1918 he enlisted in the ‘First Foreign Regiment at the Central Recruiting Office of the Seine, matriculation list no. 12651 – Detailed for pay and rations to the 32nd Field Artillery Regiment – Given the rank of Candidate as a foreigner to take his place August 22, 1918 – Detailed for pay and rations to the 15th Artillery Regiment – Arrived and enrolled in the 1st Battery on September 20, 1918 – Detailed to the Bureau of the Military Attaché of the United States on January 23, 1919 – Discharged on April 17, 1919, by the depot of the 26th Light Infantry Battalion at Vincennes – Stated, at the time, retiring to Paris, 9 Rue Gounod – Stricken from Controls on April 18, 1919.’39\n\n27\n\nC H A PTER T WO\n\nCOLE PORTER IN EUROPE, 1918–1928 On 30 January 1918, while still on active duty, Cole Porter attended the wedding of socialites Ethel Harriman and Henry Russell at the Paris Ritz, where he met Linda Lee Thomas (1883–1954), who six years earlier had divorced Edward R. Thomas (1875–1926), owner of the New York Morning Telegraph. Two months later, Porter wrote to Monty Woolley, describing his life in Paris and, most significantly (though not without a feint to the contrary), his genuine infatuation with her: 25 March 1918: Cole Porter to Monty Woolley1 Monnnnnnnt; I know you will be happy to hear this: I’m spending most of my evenings with Li’l Ole Marise, dont le pere [sic] est corse et la mere [sic] est corse mais, pour un [sic] raison quelconque, n’est pas corse de [sic] tout.* Its [sic] considered rather dangerous seeing her too often, as her ideas as to finance and the value of a dollar aren’t at all clear.

The New York Times for 7 October 1919 reported that: ‘ “Hitchy-Koo, 1919” is a Hit . . . The music and the lyrics are the work of Cole Porter, who has made a particularly clever job of the lyrics and a good, tinkling one of the music.’ Shortly afterwards, on 19 December, Porter married Linda Lee Thomas: ‘MRS. LEE THOMAS TO WED. Kentuckian to Marry Cole Porter, Composer, in Paris Today. According to private word from Paris by friends of Mrs. Lee Thomas, formerly the wife of Edward R. Thomas, she is to be married today in that city to Cole Porter, a composer.

Mrs. Thomas was formerly Miss Linda Lee, daughter of William P. Lee, a banker of Louisville, Ky., and was famed for her beauty . . . Mr. Porter is a Yale graduate, and his home is in Peru, Ind. He began composing music and lyrics for operettas and comic operas after his graduation. He wrote the music for “See America First” and also for “Hitchy Koo,” for Raymond Hitchcock, last October.’* Around a week later Porter wrote to Monty Woolley about an outing with Linda, including a cryptic reference to ‘our song’ (that is * New York Times, 18 December 1919, 13. Not all of Linda’s friends were happy with the match. The art historian Bernard Berenson (1865–1959), a friend and lifelong correspondent of Linda Porter, held out little hope for the marriage. In August 1921, shortly after the Porters’ trip to Egypt, he wrote to the well-known art collector Isabella Gardner describing Linda as ‘. . . a lovely creature, whom both the Duke of Alba and Prince Beauvais were in love with but couldn’t marry because she was divorced.

They came to us on their honeymoon, and I saw their future in the blackest terms.’ Source: privately owned; see McBrien, Cole Porter, 73. 32\n\nC O LE P O RTE R I N E U RO P E , 1 9 1 8 – 1 9 2 8\n\nPorter and Woolley’s) and a first reference to Sergei Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes, which for personal reasons – including Porter’s friendship with Diaghilev and his affair with Diaghilev’s amanuensis, Boris Kochno – was shortly afterwards to play an important role in his life: Christmas 1919: Cole Porter to Monty Woolley* Xmas 1919 I thought of you last night, Mont – t – t.

And you’d die at the Boutique, the second one. Its [sic] by far the funniest thing I’ve seen . . .†\n\nThe Porters honeymooned on the Côte d’Azur, the Italian Riviera and Sicily, and travelled frequently during the next several years. In February 1921, while in Egypt,3 Linda Porter made two short notes on the flyleaf of her copy of Arthur E. P. Weigall’s A Guide to the Antiquities of Upper Egypt (London, 1913): 28 February 1921, Luxor: Lord Carnarvon and his expert, Howard Carter, are digging at the Valley of the Kings – have discovered nothing so far . . . Visited Winlock working with the Metropolitan near Deir-el-Bahiri.‡\n\n* This handwritten note is part of a cache of letters and telegrams from Porter to Monty Woolley, privately owned in Pittsburgh, which featured on an episode of Antiques Roadshow (http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/roadshow/season/16/pittsburgh-pa/appraisals/cole-portermonty-woolley-letters-ca-1940--201106A28/). We have been unable to track down other items in the collection. † La Boutique fantasque, based on music by Gioacchino Rossini, arranged and orchestrated by Ottorino Respighi, had been premiered by the Ballets Russes at the Alhambra Theatre, London, on 5 June 1919. ‡ George Herbert, 5th Earl of Carnarvon (1866–1923), was the financial backer of Howard Carter (1874–1939), who discovered the tomb of Tutankhamun (r. c. 1332–1323 bc) the next year, on 26 November 1922; see T. G. H. James, Howard Carter. The Path to Tutankhamun (London, 2012). The Egyptologist Herbert Winlock (1884–1950) headed up the Metropolitan Museum’s excavations of the mortuary complex of Mentuhotep II (2010–1998 bc) at Dier-elBahari, beginning in 1911; see his Excavations at Deir el Bahari: 1911–1931 (New York, 1942). 33\n\nT H E L E T TE R S O F C O L E P O RTE R\n\n6 March 1921, Tel-el-Amarna: Presented Lord Carnarvon’s letter to Mr. Peet who invited us to come over after lunch and see the excavation which he is making for the exploration fund. Had a delightful time. They live in an old house reconstructed by the Germans who were working there after the war. They have uncovered part of the old city. You can see the ground floor of the villas and the plan of gardens, old furnaces, bathroom, etc. – very interesting – they discovered some beautiful old glass (which we didn’t see) and some pottery – Are now digging near the Rock Tombs – Mr. Newton, the architect, Mr. Guy and a young photographer whose name I didn’t catch.*\n\nThe Porters’ interest in Luxor in particular may have been piqued by Weigall’s description: ‘In or near the Valley are the tombs of all the Pharaohs . . . from Amenhoteph Ist to Rameses XIIth, with rare exceptions. The tomb of Tutantkhamen [sic] has not yet been found.’ That summer they took a chateau in Antibes, inviting friends and acquaintances to visit them there, among them the Mendls,† Gerald Murphy and Picasso.‡ Some years later Porter wrote to Bella Spewack, author of the book Kiss Me, Kate: ‘. . . we rented the Château de la Garoupe for two summers – 1921 and 1922 – and enjoyed every moment. But in those days we were considered crazy, and it was before the days anyone went to the Riviera in the summer, as the weather was considered too hot.’§ In May 1921, Porter wrote to his friend Monty Woolley, complaining about his silence in a serious but good-natured way:\n\n* The location of Linda Porter’s copy of Antiquities of Upper Egypt is not presently known. A description of it, and a transcription of her notes, is in CPT. † Elsie de Wolfe (Lady Mendl, 1865–1950) was an actress, interior decorator and author of The House in Good Taste (New York, 1913); her husband Sir Charles Mendl (1871–1958) was British press attaché in Paris. A profile of Lady Mendl was published in the New Yorker for 15 January 1938; it makes one mention of Porter: ‘Her first theatrical coaching was in Paris with Victorien Sardou of the Comédie-Française, and one of her pet friends in the theatre today is Clifton Webb. Jean de Reszke wouldn’t believe she couldn’t carry a tune till she sang him a hymn to prove it, and Cole Porter and his jazz are now her favored companions.’ ‡ The artists Gerald Murphy (1888–1964) and Pablo Picasso (1881–1973). The expatriate Murphy and his wife Sara (Sara Sherman Wiborg, 1883–1975) were close friends of the Porters during the 1920s; in 1923, Murphy collaborated with Porter on the ballet Within the Quota. § See pp. 388–9. 34\n\nC O LE P O RTE R I N E U RO P E , 1 9 1 8 – 1 9 2 8\n\n2 May 1921: Cole Porter to Monty Woolley4 Mont It has ceased being decent. I’m very serious. Do you realize that not one word has come from you since December & this is May? And has it entered your great domed head that we are old friends? This is my final cry for help. And the thing I regret is that even if you continue this conspiracy of silence, I know that the day when we next hit N.Y. I shall be more anxious to see you than anyone else. But, mind you, I resent it. And if ever in the future, we do meet again, once I corner you, I’m going to be so damned remote that you will leave the interview firmly convinced that I had completely forgotten your existence. I shan’t tell you my thoughts as it would obviously bore you. But I do want yours. So if you’ve an atom of energy left, won’t you sit down + hammer out a letter. It could be done. Won’t you contemplate it? Goodbye Mont-t-t Co-l-e\n\nThe Porters arrived in New York later that year and during their regular stays there during the 1920s, Linda was involved in the art scene and with cultural and philanthropic institutions. In 1920, Toys and Novelties reported on an exhibition of Bakst dolls at Knoedler’s – an art dealership founded in New York in 1846 – which included ‘several portraits, among them one of Mrs. Felix Doubleday and another of Mrs. Cole Porter’,* while the Annual Report of the American Museum for Natural History for 1921–3 lists among * Toys and Novelties 17 (April 1920), 91. Linda Porter had patronized the Russian-born artist Léon Bakst (Leyb-Khaim Izrailevich Rosenberg, 1866–1924) as early as the mid-1910s; a portrait sketch of her by Bakst, dated 1915, survives at the Evergreen House Foundation, Evergreen Museum & Library, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore. Linda Porter’s patronage lasted until at least 1925 when the New York Herald Tribune (European Edition) reported from Paris that ‘The exhibition of works of Léon Bakst will terminate in a few days at the Galerie Jean Charpentier, and a group of American friends of the late painter, headed by Mrs. Cole Porter, has made up a purse by which M. Bakst’s sixteen-year-old son, who inherits much of his father’s talent, will go to the Beaux-Arts. The fortune accumulated by Bakst was exhausted by the support of fourteen Russians, elderly people, after the revolution’ (25 November 1925, 2). In Paris, Bakst is also likely to have socialized with the Porters through their mutual acquaintance Diaghilev, for whose Ballets Russes he designed both sets and costumes. 35\n\nT H E L E T TE R S O F C O L E P O RTE R\n\nits annual members ‘By payment of $10 annually . . . Porter, Mrs. Cole.’ A headline in the New York Times for 31 December 1922 runs ‘SAYS AMERICA FAILS TO APPRECIATE ART’ and continues: ‘Joseph Pennell, the veteran artist,* yesterday afternoon made a strong plea for greater recognition of modern artists, in an address at the Anderson Galleries. The occasion was the hanging of pictures for the fourth exhibition of the New Society of Artists,† which will have its varnishing day on Tuesday at the Anderson Galleries . . . The members of the Varnishing Day Committee are: . . . Mrs. Cole Porter.’5 In January 1923, the New York Times also reported that ‘Mrs. W. K. Vanderbilt, Mrs. John W. Garrett and Mrs. Cole Porter are members of the Reception Committee for the lecture of Leon Bakst, in French, at the Plaza on Tuesday morning, Jan. 30, on the art of dress. The proceeds will go to the Brooklyn Music School Settlement.’‡ For his part, Porter appears regularly to have kept in contact with fellow Yalies and in 1922 he wrote songs for a sketch accompanying a Yale alumni production of George Bernard Shaw’s Caesar and Cleopatra, as the New York Times for 21 December, p. 18, reported: ‘YALE MEN IN SHAW PLAY . . . Bernard Shaw’s “Caesar and Cleopatra” is to be presented this evening by the Yale University Dramatic Association at the Heckscher Memorial Theatre. A smoker for the players will follow afterward at the Yale Club, and * Joseph Pennell (1857–1926) was known not only as an artist but also as an author, including a travel book, The Jew at Home: Impressions of a Summer and Autumn Spent with Him (New York, 1892). Virulently anti-Semitic, he described German and Russian Jews as ‘the most contemptible specimen of humanity in Europe’, Polish Jewish towns as ‘a hideous nightmare of dirt, disease, and poverty’, and he said of Russian Jews that ‘They like dirt; they like to herd together in human pigsties’ and that ‘they like to make money out of the immorality of the Christian. They are simply a race of middlemen and money-changers.’ † Organized in 1918 as American Painters, Sculptors and Gravers, the society was renamed in 1920 as the New Society of Artists; it held exhibitions at the Wildenstein Galleries, 1919 and 1921; the Anderson Galleries, 1922–5; the Grand Central Art Galleries, 1926; the Brooklyn Museum, 1928–9; and the Whitney Museum of American Art, 1932. At various times it was patronized or had associations with Marcel Duchamp, Dashiell Hammett, Georgia O’Keeffe, Leo Stein, Alfred Stieglitz and Virgil Thomson; like the contemporaneous Society of Independent Artists, founded in 1916, its purpose was to mount exhibitions at which all artists were welcome, with neither jury nor prizes. The fourth exhibition of the New Society of Artists took place from 2 to 27 January 1923; a copy of the exhibition catalogue survives in the Seattle Art Museum Libraries. See Joshua C. Taylor, The Fine Arts in America (Chicago and London, 1979), 157. ‡ The Brooklyn Music School Settlement was founded in 1909 as an arm of the New York Music School Settlement; see https://www.brooklynmusicschool.org/history-culture-brooklyn-music-school. 36\n\nC O LE P O RTE R I N E U RO P E , 1 9 1 8 – 1 9 2 8\n\na sketch, the book for which was written by George Chappell and the music by Cole Porter, is to be staged by the alumni at the smoker.’ In 1925 he contributed to Out O’ Luck, produced by the Yale University Dramatic Association and directed by Monty Woolley.
